TRANSCRIPT
========================================
say that lightly it is an honor to see a lot of you a lot of faces I remember and this is old stomping grounds for Becky and I we pastored for 16 years in Logan Ohio so we brought our Buckeye passports and uh we're we're legitimates so it's nice to be back and uh nice to feel that Lake Effect I do have news for you that it is spring in other parts of the world and just in case you never got the memo yet uh it's a is there something about the lake effect wind you don't forget you know it's just just kind of nice um we are we are honored to be here uh with Brother Sam and uh family and and the church and churches around and uh it is uh always special to come and talk about the Christian family and uh this is something that's very dear to our hearts and uh trust that something that said today will be a help to you and I'm going to say a lot so chances are statistically uh you're probably going to get something that you can take away and uh I'm I'm hoping uh hoping in that so you have a a set of notes you should have a set of notes between you and uh if you want to make notes on that certainly welcome to everything that I'm going to say is public domain so you can if you're recording this and and Brother Sam has the he's going to have all the Powerpoints so I'm going to go fast I normally speak at 150 words a minute but I gust to 220. uh so today I'm going to be moving uh a lot I'm going to put a lot in and by the third session you're going to kind of be looking at me all side but you will have all of this information okay and all the Powerpoints so don't lose me by trying to make notes on everything you will have the resource and be able to take it with you as I'm going to refer to lots of things and this is this is uh I think going to be very practical for you so before we begin uh and and do anything any further let's let's have a word of prayer and uh we're going to start with this scripture and we're going to use it as a basis here in Jeremiah chapter 31 and one maybe we could have you stand just out of respect to the word [Music] Jeremiah 31 and 1 at the same time saith the Lord will I be the God of all the families of Israel and they shall be my people Lord we feel privileged to read that today because we believe Lord when you made that statement through the Prophet Jeremiah you are actually looking at us and now in the name of Jesus Christ we commit this day into your hands and pray that you would Breathe upon it that Lord you administer to every heart every soul every family that's represented here today Lord even the singles that are gathered Among Us lord it's it's a good environment a good uh good instruction for everyone to hear and so Lord we pray for your anointing we pray for your presence to be here today and Lord this is your day we give it to you like an offering and just say Lord consume it and breathe Upon Us in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated all right page one in your note page two in your notes here but let me give you a little intro because I got to qualify uh the fact that I'm I'm qualified to do this number one I'm married and I'm honored to have uh my wife with me here today this was at the White House in 2019 uh uh sister Trump wanted us to come and see the decorations there and uh so we had a good connection in the White House and uh that we we had this picture made now I also am a family man and when we got married we decided to stick with boys and so uh when Lucas got married he's the last of our boys when he got married we decided uh to have a pitcher made and so this is the one we're not ashamed to show so this is all of us here and on the right is my father-in-law brother fulture he's 96 years old and uh I figure we'll have to shoot him because he he just doesn't want to cross over but uh we are we were honored to have uh all of this picture taken so here's the breakdown here's Andrew and Rebecca on the left and uh with their uh children and Peter and Rachel in the middle Steve and Sarah and then Lucas got married however this is my pride and joy in life here and I'm just dying for somebody to invite me to come and speak on grandchildren because I have one rule for grandchildren raising grandchildren is give them whatever they want that's that's how we do it so they are a great joy in our lives and we we appreciate them very much now so that gives me my right to speak about families today because we've been there done that got the scars to show it but let's look on page two if you don't mind here and I appreciate Brother Sam uh doing the the notes Here everything that we're going to talk about today is on the notes and there's some things on the PowerPoint that are not in these notes here so uh you you should have it pretty pretty handy and uh and I I was I was revising this up to about eight o'clock this morning so the PowerPoint is going to be just a shade different it's going to have more stuff in it than what's in the notes here but again you can have the PowerPoint I have to say this just as these few introductory notes here I'm not a miracle worker okay these are principles a lot of the principles are general principles so I'm not going to talk about your children and your household maybe except charity and Nathaniel I know those kids but uh these These are general principles that you can apply so you can glean from this what you can and brother Branham says and then Jesus came it's the darkest hour that the family has ever seen take note of the year it's 66 almost 66 years ago to the day almost 66 years ago it's The Darkest Hour the family's ever seen look at the families broke up there's more divorces in America alone than there is in the whole rest of the world put together divorces on the Rampage and where has uh the honesty and the sincerity and the Womanhood of our American women gone to so here's a 20th century Prophet speaking the 20th century families and letting them know that divorces run rampant 66 years ago and he's got an insight there and he's actually very accurate number two by virtue of our births we are citizens of two kingdoms those kingdoms are diametrically opposed to one another so the things that we believe are not the things that are held in esteem in our culture and vice versa so therefore you have to learn uh to uh to navigate through this world that's challenging enough for all of us but here's the great challenge if you have children you have to teach those children to navigate in a world that's rapidly changing and falling apart so everything about this world is falling apart in in number three Psalm 34 Comey children and hearken unto me and I will teach you the fear of the Lord God's original Masterpiece was not a church the first thing that God did in the Book of Genesis was have a family right have a marriage have a family that's the first thing and so it it looked like this there was a family uh in the Garden of Eden and at the center of that family was a marriage that was the essence before there were pillars of fire before there was prophets before there was Commandments there was a family and there was a marriage and before we got past chapter three and four we had an attack on that marriage and family and so this is this is a construct of God this is his idea and this is his design and so therefore naturally Satan is going to fight that in every way the family really belongs to God your children belong to God and as soon as you begin to realize that you don't own them but you're an ambassador to them the better off you'll be in Psalm 127 we'll deal with this this afternoon except the Lord build a house slave though they labor in vain that build it and accept the Lord keep the city The Watchmen wake but in vain so the the whole Essence is is that when we when we are concerned about family and I assume you are because you showed up or you want to have one uh there there is a desire in our hearts to do it the right way to do it God's way and if you're going to do that you're not going to get that information from the cosmos matter of fact let me ask you this question where do you go today where do you go to get good information about raising your children what what resources do you use back in back in the day I remember we had a radio station that was on and Dr Dobson used to be on I've done a half hour program a day he's not a voice anymore tell me who are the voices today that you would listen to that uh and and he we we listen to him on that radio program and he had some good things to say he had some truths that he had embraced and shared and uh you know there was a couple of others that were doing similar things but where do you go today what personality can you identify today outside of your pastor pastors who are here where do you go internet how's that going man that's a free-for-all right that's a zoo out there try to find something sensible or moral out there or something you can't you don't have to filter and you don't have to pray over five or six times before you show it to somebody because it I mean it's it's just it's crazy and it's getting crazier where do you go well we go back to the Bible yeah naturally duh sorry and you you you we go to the message but you're I mean there's no there's no family series in brother man's Ministry right there's no raising teenagers 101 in the message now it's there it's there and a lot of what you're going to hear from me is from there and from the scripture but you got to look for that and ministers are anointed to look for that a little bit differently than you would like we were talking last night at supper there's a great little teaching brother Branham has at the beginning of indictment well naturally you're not going to kind of go to and the message indictment for family instruction right I mean that kind of doesn't click but for ministers now it's a little bit different because you know we we uh you know find those things but where do you go there's a dearth of information good information out there and so that's why and I'm not saying this for the wrong reason that's why every imitation that I'm taking this year to travel is from last year's invitations I can't keep up with uh the imitations I was in Hungary last weekend last last week I was in Hungary recently um it's been less than two weeks and the ministers who showed up over there all came to me at one of the meals and they sat down with their address books and they said we want you to come to our country we want you to be here there is nine different countries represented uh in the meeting there and I'm not saying that for the wrong reason I'm just saying that there are cycles of need that the people of God had you're a blessing despite what everybody says about you you're a blessing and uh and I like these sessions because it's the only one where you can drink coffee and get kind of get away with it right if you can eat donuts in church I can drink coffee so so it's it's a it's a need that that people have and you're here because you you even if you're doing a lot of things right and a lot of you are doing a lot of things right we can probably do things a little better and we can learn a little bit more because you're facing a really challenging time to raise children and so that's why you have to make sure that you understand you're an ambassador to your children a representative of the kingdom of God and those children are not yours you have them on loan for a season and I'll guarantee you take it from me I know what I'm talking about they'll go we tried to bribe our kids with everything we had within us to stay because we love our boys and we wanted them to stay tractors cars tools money whatever it was but the smell of perfume always wins I mean it it it you're gonna lose the battle number four the principles apply even though they might be Old Testament or they might be biblical or whatever else or brother Brown's day the principles work you have to learn to identify principles in scripture and apply them it's just like uh in number four it says they're General Rommel and my uncle actually fought against General Rommel in World War II in North Africa he he was successful and so successful because he studied the tactics of Robert E Lee and even though the the deserts of North Africa were very different than the fields of Antietam uh he was successful because he applied to principles that's your challenge as well the Christian family by definition and we're going to deal with this a couple of different times is a family who places Christ at the center of all they do and the secret of a good family is disarmingly simple you cultivate the family's relationship with Jesus Christ and then there's no phase of family life there is no problem we face that is outside the influence of the Holy Spirit and everybody says amen by definition and this is mine a Christian family is a group of people who are related to each other through marriage birth or adoption and are committed first and foremost to the person and the work of Jesus Christ Faithfully witnessing to the love power and forgiveness of God and they have that as a theme but as for me and my house will serve the Lord so we're not talking about having a house we're talking about developing a household for God wherever that is number six there may be no tomorrow but we train anyway part of our leadership and stewardship responsibility is to equip the new generation as well as partis anticipating the challenges that exist before us that's the challenge and that's a real challenge number seven our responsibility is his bride is to live for Christ to please him and our responsibility as parents is to utilize all the resources and opportunities at our disposal to spread the message of Hope to begin a faith to become a faithful witness of the truth and to inspire Challenge and equip those who believe to shine as lights in the present world and the place we're going to start is your own household all right now here's a quote we're going to use this several times today brother Banner made this statement and I love this statement he said now we've got to think of our young people this is 1962 I think it is we got to think of our young people and we got to think of others that's coming on behind us these young people and a place for our children our daughters we don't want them out in the world in these things we want them girls raised like their mothers and it's going to automatically happen because you're in the message that's not what he says this is an intentional proactive unpurposed decision that parents make and we've got to make arrangements for that who's got to make arrangements does he say the holy spirit's going to make it rain the holy spirit's got this all worked out and he's going to come into your house and make this happen he doesn't say that he said we've got to make arrangements for that we don't know how long tomorrow is right we didn't think our boys would grow up and and eventually get married we still we we still remember all the homeschooling years right and we we never thought that they would be where they are today but we've got to make arrangements for that even if we uh we think there's no tomorrow and and that's what brother branham's handing us as parents and as leaders in her household he's handing us that responsibility to uh to think about how you want your daughters raised it's not going to automatically happen your children are not born with respect they're not born with an understanding of the Commandment that says honor your father and your mother they're not born with us with a with a a Godly conscience there's things you're going to do in their lifetime that's going to help shape their understanding of things and their perspective and so brother I am saying you gotta you gotta look at this realistically if we don't want our young people if we don't want our daughters uh to be raised like the world but we want them raised like their mother we got to make a decision all right so this is the way I translated that to my boys I said if you want to have a home where your wife can stay home and homeschool your children if you want you know what you're going to have to do you're going to have to smarten up and do good in school and get yourself a degree or a job or a skill that allows you to be able to bring home enough bacon so that your wife has the option to stay home if she wants you understand me there's a decision you guys got to make prior to having children that's going to allow your wife to be able to raise your children at home like you were raised at home you don't have to but if you're going to do that there's a decision you got to make when you're 12 13 and 14. so I encourage all my boys when they were 12 13 14 they get serious about trying to find yourself to track that God has for you what path do you think God wants you to be on what what uh what has God put in you what gifts and talents has God put in you and you want to lean that way you want to you want to develop those talents because God put them in there for a purpose because you know what if you don't do that and you you decide that you're going to play a bunch of video games here in your part in your spare time and uh you know idle your days away you're going to have to marry a wife who's either come from some really wealthy father or she's going to have to work one or the other because in most cases in most parts of the world it takes about a salary and a half to feed a family today I said it takes about a salary and a half to feed a family unless unless you really get focused and tracked and you're in the will of God and use the talents God's given you develop those and if you're going to be a a teacher be a really good teacher if you're going to be an engineer be a really good engineer if you're going to uh you know whatever you're going to do you've got to think about your wife and then think about your children so these decisions don't happen when we when we're on our way to the hospital to deliver our first child these decisions are made when you're 12 and 13. you get it so my job as a parent is to sit down with these guys before they're shaving and to say hey buddy you know what you got to think about this and you're going into high school you got to think about this you don't have a choice everybody with me so that's what that's what brother man was talking about here and uh you know our interest is not in uh politics our interest is not in trying to reshape the culture uh we're not Bill Gothard here we we're we're just trying to track our kids in the perfect will of God and so this is really important here so this is the structure you know in terms of New Testament this is the structure that God determined for us and uh this is the way that that things are right I mean this is not brother Barry's rules or brother Sam's rules this is God's rule that children obey their parents and the Lord for this is right it's a really interesting uh to let your kids know that there's a blessing when you obey you know they think it's all rules and regulations but it there's a blessing involved when they obey and at the center of that household is this relationship the relationship between Christ and his bride which is a type of the relationship between husband and wife and I will tell you something if you want to have a successful home and raise your children well this relationship is the primary one and this is the one you have to keep your eye on all the time we're going to talk about this later this evening in number three but this is the one that you've got to always keep your eye on and I've told my boys for years I never made a vow to you guys so you know what you can come and go but I made a vow to one person in this world and I've got to make sure that I stay focused on that relationship no matter what happens and no matter what season of life I've I've made a vow to one person and if we have differences we've got to resolve them if we if we are going to be strong in our household we her and I we've got to work at that we got to stay together because every other relationship in the house revolves around that one relationship everybody okay all right so one of the most successful uh series that I ever did was called shalom in the home and it's uh it's a 20-something uh thing that I did uh you're welcome to look at it and I kind of had some of these things broken down but I used this scripture uh to to uh form a foundation for that series and in Zechariah Chapter 8 Zechariah is a fantastic book A lot of it has to do with prophecy but Zechariah also told the people who were in captivity that when you go back to the land when you go back here's how I want things done God told them he said this these are the things that I want you to do when you go back to the land of Israel again you've been out for 70 years I'm going to allow you to go back now and this is what I want you to do he says again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem into the house of Judah and fear ye not so I I I determined that this is the amount of time now you're going to go back to Jerusalem now you're going to go back to the house of Judah speaky every man here's what I want you to do these are the things that ye shall do I love it when God tells us this is what I want you to do or you know when brother Branham says I want you to pray this way I think that's great because it takes the burden off right what am I what am I supposed to say now and brother Brandon says say pray this way I think it's great here's Zechariah saying this is what you're going to do when you go back to the land and for you now when you go back to your household this is the thing you shall do number one speak every man truth to his neighbor the Cardinal or the primary characteristic of your household will be identified as a people who speak truth number two you will execute or govern and in the Hebrew that means govern the Judgment of Truth and peace in your Gates within your household we're going to Prior prioritize two things that is truth and peace shalom in our gates so we're going to strive for being honest with one another and we are going to strive for establishing shalom in the home is that okay so that's where I got that series and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against these neighbor and love no false oath for all these things do I hate uh saith the Lord so this was the foundation and establishing or governing my house based on truth and peace are two real challenges because we live in a very dishonest world and we also live in a world that is anything but peaceful and your kids are not experiencing peace so it's a it's a real challenge in Jehovah Jireh brother Branham said now lot being greedy now by the way I know I'm going fast but I'm still doing foundational stuff here if we have time we'll take a little break okay and and just a little stretch break so just bear with me here as we go through this brother bam said now lock being greedy he looked down there and he saw the great things already built up in Sodom when lot looked at Sodom and here's brother Ram describing what was in his head he didn't have to walk with God Alone he didn't want by the way read what it says not what I say because I I sometimes I go too fast he didn't want to walk with God Alone he wanted to mix up with the world great businessman influence in the city make a few extra dollars those are those things are not evil in themselves he got a good position there but he was backslid now he said that's the church carnal but he's talking about a lot now as a as a father and a husband and he got down there mixed up with the world where perverts and everything else was and took his daughters down there his wife and put them right in the midst of a bunch of bunch like that so he he's got these intentions here a good position a good salary influence in the city good businessman not evil in itself but where he chooses to do this is going to have an effect on his family so I will tell you something that where you go to church matters where you decide to live matters you all don't need to be here or there or there or my place but you need to be somewhere where your family is ministered to that's the will of God and you've got to be in a place where uh even even if it's not as good a business or even if it's not as wealthy a position or whatever else you've got to make a decision because where you are is going to influence the generation that God's given you to raise and your wife and we know that's true about Sodom so here again is that quote taken signs of Jesus and again we're going to come to that make an Arrangements uh making arrangements for the future generation I gotta ask you this how many of you have daughters let's see your hands wow wow honey we are odd Sam you don't have daughters do you Lord willing you might have daughters in law someday now that's a treat and when you have daughters and a lot of potential for grandchildren arrives and that's way better I say that grandchildren are a reward for not killing your own don't laugh so David says in Psalm 78 I will open my mouth in a parable and I will utter sayings of old which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us watch now we will not hide them we will not hide them from their children showing to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his strength and his wonderful works that he has done for he's established a testimony in Jacob and appointed Allah on Israel which he commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children you understand what he's saying if there's anyone in the world who's going to pass on a legacy of the exploits of our God it's going to be you and you're commanded to pass them on to your children and to your children's children this is what I refer to as an intergenerational responsibility to teach your children and mold their thinking that number one our God is not dead He's Alive who knows that better than you and you know it because somebody told that somebody shared that with you and and brother random uh you know In Our Lifetime we've listened a lot to the stories and the testimonies and even people who were alive uh in the day when brother Branham was here and all the tapes and so forth tell us of the exploits of our God right you're that that's not given to you just so that you can say well amen and then go home and forget about it you have a responsibility now to teach your children and your children's children I just started a little bible study with my grandchildren and I think it's great and I said I said to them you can ask whatever question in the world you want you can start whatever subject you want it doesn't matter at all and we're kind of gonna kind of we're gonna kind of do it with just me and them and sister Becky obviously if she wants to join in but this is an opportunity for me to pass on to them some of the things that I know and I've heard and I've experienced and by God's grace now they're starting actually to come with me on the mission field I took William uh to Africa in December and he had a fantastic time he's 10 years old nine years old and came to us in Africa I'll show you pictures tomorrow and it was just fantastic to have him there with me you know and it was just great and and see some of the wild animals and the uh the work that's being done we went out in the village there with the Maasai people and it was just a life-changing experience for him and you know what that's nice and you're all saying Oh but you know what that's my responsibility to pass on to my children's children the exploits of our God God is real he's alive and he's doing things in other parts of the world even if even if we don't always see it or hear it on CNN uh it's real nonetheless God is still alive and God's moving right God's preparing a bride for the rapture amen so therefore if we want to make a household for God we've got to consciously make a place where the holy spirit's always welcome if you look at your job description as a parent you will find certain responsibilities there but you'll find other things that are not there number one that's not there is a savior you are not the savior of your children you cannot save them you cannot fill them with the Holy Ghost right if you look at God's job description it's on there and it's not on yours but you know what I found out I have to do is to create an atmosphere where the holy spirit's always welcome and then when he decides to pass by he can deal with my children's Hearts through our Bible study through our home school through our family dinners or whatever else on our vacations that God can deal with our children because because we have created an atmosphere that he's always welcome I got to make sure I don't include anything in our household or our household activities that would grieve the Holy Spirit we want him on our side we want him in our house right the second thing is that we want to have a place that is separate from Sodom so like Allah had a door between Sodom and his family we also want to create a barrier between Sodom and its effects and influence and our family is everybody okay so that means we're going to be proactive in watching who comes in and whether they come in on a wire whether they come in on a wave what do they come in in a beam you follow me whether they come in in a text no matter how they come in we're going to be putting a door we're going to be proactively looking at a a separation between us and Sodom in other words at our front door Sodom stops we're going to pray in our household we're going to have family meals together anybody ever heard of that we're going to have family devotions we're going to have preparation for church and all of those things Sodom stops at our door and if you don't do that Sodom will find a way in for sure thirdly we're going to find a place where preparations are made to leave this world now remember the first Exodus when the children of Israel were going out of Egypt for the first nine plagues it was pretty interesting I mean they went to church and they looked out over the waters there or look out over the land from Goshen and they saw water turn to blood cattle falling over flies right thick as thick as anything and they went home after church it went oh nobody fell asleep in those Services Brother Sam I mean that was exciting but the last plague was different the last plague was where Moses said now all of you including you in Goshen you go home now and apply the token in your house you've got to clean your house you've got to get dressed a certain way you got to prepare a meal a certain way because now we're going out of here so that was a time they took the message home and applied it at home is that all right I believe we're living in a similar time I believe it's no good not good enough for you to just go to church and say Amen or come to this and say amen and say thank you brother Barry you got to go home and apply this in your house because that's where preparations are made this is not just about brother Branham this is not just about uh you know church and what we do at church thank God for church and all of that but but this is about you going home and applying things and looking at your house and saying would the Holy Spirit approve this house as a place to visit and a place that's cleared for this family to go that's what you have to ask yourself and sometimes you just have to look at yourself in a an unbiased way in order to do that now today brother Branham said our great problem that we believe to be juvenile delinquency really is parent delinquency a home delinquency so look at it this way the generation of young people that we have today are not the problem they're a symptom are we okay our and here's why our people got away from the things they should have stayed with aha now I'll tell you what it's really really good to hear that before you get away from things you should stay with because it's really hard to get the genie back in the bottle once that Genie is out it's really hard to get that back in if you decide that you're going to have TV in the house just to watch the news it's going to be really hard for you to get that out if you're going to say we're going to stop attending church on Wednesday because we all have homework and we have an early uh schedule on Thursday mornings it's going to be really hard for you to get that back in again you're going to have a lot of whining and complaining if you ever decide to do that you know what you're better off not doing that in the first place I'm listen listen uh I'll leave town after this is over Okay so just let me let me say what I'm supposed to say here the church got lukewarm the children got out out into the world and anything talks about Hollywood here and he said Satan got one jump up by bringing it right in the house and that's Satan's way hey hey who knew Satan was actually planning Satan was looking at this generation and said you know what if they won't go to the movie theaters then you know what I'll bring it in at her house all right if they won't have it in their house I'll put it in their pocket ah so someone's looking at this situation here who knew and as a result our culture has become different our culture has become different our culture is influencing the world and how we do things and it's really important for us to recognize that and boys are different than girls and don't let anybody tell you don't let some social scientist tell you that they're not they are they absolutely are I remember one time years ago when my boys were um they were at the age where you could force them to go into a mall that is an age and that age does End by the way and we walked in we said you know while Mom was doing something we said hey let's go into a closed store here's a clothes store let's go in and I was looking around and saying where's where's the men's section where's the men and boys section and she said oh sir we don't have one it's all it's all clothes for anybody I said well answer this one question for me where's the door so there are a lot of things that are a lot of things that are changing but it's Satan's way of gradually getting in so brother Branham brother Branham found this brother banham found this in if you look in your notes there I'm on page four right in the middle recognizing your day in the past 75 years he said men has gone from a horse and buggy to an astronaut and he said why he turned away from his faith in God and turned it over his senses and his ability as a human being he quit trusting God he trusts himself in other words he trusts Google because that's where we get all of our information right when you want to know something else where you go right I do I mean unless there's something important if it's something really important I'll you know I'll study and search God if I'm if I'm stumped I'll call Sam and then he says now this is this is in the 60s here like this Infidel woman what's her name and it's Madeleine Murray O'Hare who was the woman single-handedly who decided that she did not want her child to hear prayer in the schools and single-handedly and she's an Infidel and an Infidel by definition is somebody when they die they have to put on their gravestone all dressed up and nowhere to go this Infidel woman what's her name in Washington they where they changed all this and Murray's Murray and somebody in the audience shouts it out she said as long as we've got an army and a Navy we don't need old Jehovah and he said I don't care what we've got it's Jehovah or nothing to me let the Army Navy sink as it will but Jehovah will remain forever Cal Thomas did an interview with her in 1970 and asked her why are so many people afraid of you and she said this was this was written by Cal Thomas I'll never forget her reply she said I'll tell you Mr Thomas why some Christians are afraid of me they're not sure that what they believe is really true and if they were sure I wouldn't be a threat to them at all you know what that is that's Believers doubting their weapon and brother Braham said you can't do that right you can't do that and so therefore you know this this is the culture this is the culture pushing back and for you that think that uh you know right-sided conservatives in our country were the majority and they were uh making an in making a difference now I've got news for you that's not the way that things are today and so therefore uh again now Brother Band says in influence he said Uzziah he said he loved the outdoors he was a herdsman he liked to see things grow and his mother was a daughter of Jerusalem they were a Believer and he said the boy had been raised with good influence and that's a good way to bring up a child in the way it should go so that is that is correct that is right and you know your children watch you and watch what you do and they copy after you because you're setting an example before them I mean I I remember when my boys were old enough to figure out they'd lean up from the back seat of the car and they'd say wow dad your the number on the speedometer is way higher than the number that's on the signs on the road wow shut up sit down so they did a poll among teenagers I mean the two most fearful words in the human language now are studies show right I mean there's all kinds of studies now I got some studies here that I want I want to show you but I'm very careful about that all right but they did a poll among teenagers and this was related to college and 91 of teenagers responded and said there are no moral absolutes so they they coined this phrase now called situational ethics that in the situation this could be right for you but it might not be right for you so whatever the city whatever your situation is I remember a girl telling my wife and I uh our boys were involved in a little 4-H club locally in our town when we were in Ohio and it was a horse club and we were involved in that for a couple of seasons and this girl was saying that uh or one of the parents was telling us that they had a girl in their school who uh she wanted to get pregnant and have a baby and uh we were like really you know not married and they said yeah because she had a hard life and she was abandoned by her family and she didn't have any siblings growing up so she wants to have a child in other words it's okay for her it might not be right but that doesn't matter in her case in that situation it's okay and that's called situational ethics well when you open the door to situational ethics really everyone what does does what's right in their own eyes right I mean that's that's the end result of that and you know what that brings right we we know where that's taking us 65 percent of kids said that Satan doesn't really exist he's only a symbol of evil that's all he's only a symbol of evil something you see in movies 61 percent agree if a person is generally good or does enough good things for others during their lifetime they will earn a place in heaven that's our kids today 50 and here's the scary one 50 percent of young people who claim to have an experience with God deny the Same by graduation you know why because there's an atmosphere in most colleges and unfortunately even good colleges and Christian colleges where they seek to influence or attempt to sway the beliefs of students coming in there and this is not this is not hidden this is not something that's unknown and and so therefore we're we're dealing with an atmosphere or a mindset or a world view if you like and some of you uh some of you guys are in college right and this is not a stretch for you guys I mean this is this is something I I was I was absolutely um appalled several years ago when one of my sons was in college and he was given an English essay to write and he brought home the topics that he could choose from I I mean I'm still not over it and that was 20 years ago maybe 15 years ago I'm still not over it the topics that professor gave him to write and I said we're paying for this and and he's asking you to write about subjects and one of them was killing a horse stomping a horse to death with your feet and the other ones I can't even repeat to you they were so horrible and he eventually wrote he came to me and he said Dad these are the choices I had to write an essay about and I I I said I I couldn't do that I I mean I just I couldn't do that and he was a freshman in in college and eventually he wrote an essay about why he couldn't write an essay about these essay topics and you know he's he's he got his Doctorate after all so it didn't it didn't influence him but he had to be willing to stand up he had to be willing to stand up and say that's nuts that's nuts and say it in a nice way because you don't want to have the professor say well huh all right so let's look at this this morning let's focus on four things here okay these are four fences of protective discipline things that you want to put around your kids and your family and let's talk about these okay just in a in a general and a quick way here number one you have to answer the question who holds your child's heart who is it in life that holds your child's heart is it their friends is it social media who holds your child's heart do your do the grandparents hold your child's heart and they're disrespectful to you I know a case where I know a case where the mother holds the child's heart the children's heart just tell them to hang on a sec we'll get it in a minute unless it's for me if you want me to get it she holds a child's heart and she has influenced her children away from the father and said well he's not strong enough he's not smart enough he doesn't have a degree he's done this he's not that he's done something else and now those children have become teenagers and those teenagers are rebelling because they've been taught to reject Authority and disrespect their parents right now she's finding out she can't handle them and she says to her husband well why don't you take care of this he's calling me to find out how he can handle it my answer is not a short answer because now we can't say all right apply a b and c here and it'll take care of the problem we're talking about a marriage issue first right and we're talking about a foundational issue of putting a protective fence around your kids here and who holds a child's heart you had to be very careful about your child's heart and and what influences they are enamored with then of course the media is an issue we all have to deal with right and I'm going to deal with that uh in in our in our second part here uh about who captures your child's imagination and what it is that really draws them who controls their desires or what controls uh their desires in life and who sets the course who sets the course in life now it's really interesting that Solomon I mean they must have had the internet back in that day because he's he has a really interesting scripture here that's not very often talked about the drawing is of anybody know recognize this drawing of this artwork Narcissus narcissus is from where we get our term narcissistic okay and somebody if somebody's a narcissist they're very focused on themselves very enamored with themselves they kind of don't know that anybody else is in the room at all so they'll look at things in a very narcissistic way narcissist narcissus was a fictional character who one day looked at his reflection in the pool and he got so enamored with his face and his reflection because mirrors weren't a big deal back then that he just kept looking at this image until he died okay that's the mythological character Narcissus and so he looked at this true reflection of himself and became really caught he fell in love with an image of himself okay so I put that up there because the Proverbs says as in water face answer at the face so the heart of man the man so in other words in a real way when you look in a mirror or a pool and you see a reflection you're getting you're getting what's really there right you're getting a true reflection of what's there it's not it doesn't change it's it's a it's a real reflection of what's looking into the mirror is what's coming back Solomon says in the same way that when a person looks in a mirror and sees their true reflection so I can tell you what's in the heart of your child by the people they hang around with that's what the Hebrew language is telling us here if I want to know what's really going in my child's heart tell me what it is they're in love with tell me what it is they're fascinated with let me let me look and see who they hang around with who do they want to be with do they want to be with church kids do they want to be with some boy in school do they want to hang around or listen to you know hard music all the time tell me what's in their heart I can tell what's in their heart by who they're associating with and sometimes we have to face the fact that even our children are not a good influence on other children and this is what Solomon is kind of striking Us in the face with is that what what what we're looking at what we're involved with who we associate with is a true reflection of something that's on the inside as in water face answers to face so the heart of man to man you put somebody together and allow them to hang around with somebody that's reflecting something that's going on in that child's heart so that's why we have to we had to be very careful be very observant and brother Brown said your life will impress your children and influence your children by the example you set and I think it's a good thing that we put every effort we can before our children as Godly Parents to make an example and to be an example again be certain of God I want to thank this radio station which is broadcasting this service I sure would love to be close to where this radio station was I believe that the influence that music puts upon our children it would pay every Christian throughout radioland that this radio reaches to keep their radios tuned to such a station as this tonight because it brings the right kind of influence through music and through preaching of the word to our children it actually sets them in a better environment wow here's brother Brandon promoting social media there's two things we learned from this when you find a good source latch onto it but if it can be an influence for good put the wrong thing on the waves now it becomes an influence for evil things because we're dealing with the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right and brother Ram's remarking this hey they're actually broadcasting they're streaming this is this is early prehistoric streaming because they got a radial reception unit there and they're streaming this through the radio waves who cares right it's getting out there and he's acknowledging that hey this is a good influence mark this is something wow too bad we don't live closer to here this is a good thing and so if it can become an influence for good remember it can become an influence for not so good and and you've got to pay attention to that you've got to be proactive because your kids are not automatically going to gravitate towards the good things as parents you've been around longer you have seen more and you've seen the influence of these things on people's lives and so therefore Brother Bear I'm saying man I'd like to have I'd like to be aware of this radio station actually broadcast because this this hey this is the kind of thing you can turn on leave on and help create a good atmosphere in your house it's got some good stuff on here everybody okay so they asked president this question and it's a great question he said what activity should our pre-teen children participate in we all know the answer to that right Instagram how should we go about helping them select their Associates wow people back in that day had questions about this stuff too one activities should our children participate in all right now let's look at his answer his answer is great he said keep them in Christian company as long as you possibly can if it's a girl keep her with Christian girls Christian boys vice versa if she's old enough to go with a boy see that she keeps with the right kind of boy and discourage her to any boy otherwise or boy to a girl discourage that as children get older once they get past 10 and 12 you can't use physical discipline really effectively after around that age because you Foster a spirit of rebellion in children after roughly after that age are you say are you without resources after that age absolutely not because what I want to what I want to do before they get to age 10 or 12 is begin to develop a relationship with them so when we lose the ability to do any kind of physical corporal punishment to them my relationship is going to help me in the times when I can't touch them hey I don't pick on my boys now if they'll beat the pulp out of me but I have a relationship and I lean on that relationship a lot and and there are times when I can you know they can be all Brave and mouthy and when they get in a group but I'll pull them aside one-on-one and I say hey really what's going on tell me what's happening here you know what you said was not right and when I get them one-on-one that's a different story and in most cases that's going to save you more than trying to physically discipline them in an age when that's not appropriate I also tell them I hold a checkbook in the car keys so deal with it but brother Branham is saying here that you need to be involved here so I asked George and Rebecca years ago and uh about some things that happened in brother Graham's household and I wanted to know things that brother Branham told his daughters for instance about uh the courtship years and and how did they react to boys coming around because brother Ram's family was obviously well known popular and I wanted to know what did Brother man tell you as girls single girls about how to deal with uh you know uh those years and and and they told me a story one time a brother Branham was in this is not on tape all right but brother Branham uh was was out of his household and when he came back he saw Rebecca and a school friend out in the backyard playing volleyball with two boys and they were just going back and forth over that message volleyball I mean that's that's the safest thing in the world and ironically at the same time Rebecca was talking with George she kind of had Orion George and George had his eye on her and George had talked to brother Branham about that so they were kind of sort of semi-officially kind of going together okay and brother Mann comes back and he looks at he looks out the back door and he sees the four of them out there kind of like two couples playing message volleyball he calls Rebecca in and he says Rebecca what what's what's going on and she tells him and he says well what do you what would you think if the neighbors looked over and said hey you're you're kind of associating with George and now these boys are over here she he said he said that wouldn't look so good would it and she said not and he said send the rest of them home send them home brother man goes on to say if she's going with an unbeliever try to encourage her to go with a Believer and vice versa make your internet powerful enough for everybody to get on at the same time increase your bandwidth that's not what he says make your home nice make your home a place where your daughter or son will not be ashamed to bring their company before their father and mother and into their house and make home so happy that they'll be pleased in their home to stay there the first line of defense for what activity should our pre-children preteen children be involved in is in your home you got to make your home a certain way you've got a uh you've got to get involved in this uh whole process of making your home a place that people they like to come to and if you've got daughters and you want to have the boys come to the house so you can keep your eye on them you know a pack of boys it's food food is always the key right all you need to do is just open it up and you know they're there they're right there this is not brain science brain surgery science folks all right let's take a break and we're going to take a break before we get into this because this is I think really important on social media and I wish I had this in your notes it's going to be on the the thing here but can we do five minutes just stretch more coffee okay five minutes let's do this we good three testing one two three all right so if you want to make your way back let's let's look at this let's tackle this subject obviously I cannot and will not be able to tackle all of this subject here but it is a real big part of your kids lives so we want to deal with this subject on social media just as a portion of our study here you don't have any of this in your notes so what I'm going to do is I'm going to email this these three PowerPoints to brother Samuel brother Nathaniel brother Trevor and uh so you you you guys can nothing is copyrighted so you can spread these around if you want if you if pastors want to do that okay and if you're if you're here you know and you're that's not one of your pastors I might be glad to email that or see bro Sam be welcome to do that okay this is an interesting phenomena because number one thank you number one brother Brandon said nothing about this because this didn't exist in his day and number two none of us got a chance to vote on this whether we're our lives are all going to be dominated by the internet I never got a chance to vote if I had a vote I would vote against it being such a overwhelming influence in the world today and so what I'm gonna I'm gonna read you some things here and I want you to follow me as best you can and I've I've edited this and edited this but I have put the links for all of it on the bottom here so you can look this up and you can look at the whole article and I've edited it because I don't want to read you to death so some of these statistics here are changed because if this was written a month or two ago it's all different now the numbers are different it's incredible how exponentially fast these numbers grow it's incredible now I have a son who is a data scientist he works with big data with a big company in a big city and he's a he's an expert he has a degree in this Advanced field of study because there's so much data now that's generated in a given day I will tell you that one-third of the world's population one-third of the world's population is on Instagram every day one third of the world's population what I'm going to focus on primarily here is the influence that Instagram specifically has on girls so this is not brother Barry's thoughts what I'm giving you here is evidence-based in other words this is stuff that I've tracked down and talking to my sons my sons are one of them's an engineer one of them's uh as a doctorate in in he works with one of the leading uh firms in in out of Washington that does intervention for um look you don't have enough time here is job description because it takes me a while to even come up with all the words but intervention in terms of computer and cyber issues in the world and Nations that are attacked in in a in a digital way and all the rest of it and I have another one that's involved in finance and marketing and another one who's Big Data and you know so these guys we talk about this when I and I I know where to go I'm not I'm not a great researcher but they are and I know where to go to find information and analysis and statistics that I can trust as a matter of fact one of my sons was in a meeting with uh Bill Gates who was the former not Bill Gates Bill um the guy who's the former Defense secretary and uh he was in a meeting small meeting of 15 people in in a meeting with the Secretary of Defense a couple years ago and he texted me and he said Hey Dad I'm in the room with this with this guy got any questions yeah hello and uh he I asked him a question about Israel and he said hang on he said someone in the room is asking that question right now hang on so he texted me the answers here now no I'm not allowed to tell you what he told me but uh so all I'm saying to you is that I get I get this information very carefully but I want to be evidence-based here social media and we're going to reduce this to SM okay is a big part of many teens lives 2018 Pew Research Center uh did a survey of 13 to 17 year olds and found that 40 percent are online almost constantly and 97 percent of 13 to 17 year olds 97 so we can pretty much say that's just about all of them use a social media platform such as YouTube Facebook Instagram Snapchat and so forth but what impact so now scientists and social scientists and educators are coming up with data that suggests there is an effect of all of this internet usage all of it is not negative all of it is not necessarily bad but there is an effect and that's what's important now you got to think about this you think about this in terms of your family your daughter and what what this could do and then you got to think about well what should I do about this problem and I'm going to give you four points that you can consider four or five points you can consider and it's a very simplistic response to this but social media can use can negatively affect teens distracting them disrupting their sleep exposing them to bullying rumor spreading unrealistic views of other people's lives I said unrealistic views of other people's lives comparison is the mother of jealousy oh honey we had a lovely vacation this year we were on the shores of Lake Erie and it was just wonderful that little that little tent that we had I mean it was just and having a fire oh it was so nice and it was just nice to have the kids around us and so forth until they get home and look on Facebook and look at you mean the Browns had a vacation in Hawaii this year and we went on a dumpy little tent out by the lake and froze our feet off huh thanks a lot it was okay until we saw the comparison right so when a girl portrays herself as being popular lots of boys around and a young girl looks at that 13 years old and says wow I'm missing out duh I need to dress like this in order to have pictures like that now it's not like only a few of them are on there 97 percent are on there a 2019 study of more than 6 500 12 to 15 year olds in the U.S found that those who spent more more than three hours a day using social media might be at a heightened risk for mental health problems and studies also observe links between high levels of social media use and depression and anxiety symptoms greater social media use nighttime social media use and emotional investment in social media such as feeling upset when prevented from logging on you mean we can't have our phones on in church were each linked with worse Sleep Quality and higher levels of anxiety and depression wow that's interesting how teens use social media also might determine its impact social comparison and feedback seeking by teens using social media and cell phones was linked with depression I did recently I did a series in our church and it was called living above your cares and uh I think that was the name of it and it's four or five Services it's called living above your cares it was about the subject of anxiety and I was shocked because I was thinking I was telling bro Sam I was thinking well you know this might be good in a general sense you know to have and then I I could not believe the response that I got internationally from people around the world who were listening to this and I was talking specifically about anxiety and the pressures associated with that and the feelings people have associated with that and I was amazed but I'll tell you what else I was amazed at 95 percent of the people who wrote to me and either wanted more help or were greatly helped by the series were men and not young men middle aged men I was shocked I had no idea that people uh that that brothers were feeling this way and I had an altar call one day in my church at the end of this little series I had an altar call and there was one woman came up and the rest were all men I I was just I was amazed at that how big of a problem this actually is and in addition older adolescents who use social media passively what's this older adolescents who use social media passively so this would be above 17. just viewing other people's photos reported declines in life satisfaction so just by scrolling through and looking at people's pictures ruin their day this had the effect of saying well I'm really missing out I don't get to travel Now isn't it true though that you kind of put your best pictures up there I mean is isn't that true so you don't you don't say this honey you look terrible today you're you're absolutely you look like you just got out of bed you know you don't say hey let's get it let's get a selfie here while we're arguing like them that's not what we we're looking at my kids my goodness you look like you're just home from the orphanage here and go you need to get a shower you smell bad by the way stop let's get a picture of that sometimes and I I did this this week to a young lady I said you do realize that everybody's lives are not perfect right because she's responding to me about how she's looking at this on social media and looking at these kids with you know babies and oh how how great life is I said they are putting selected images up there right but yet the science tells us that even older adolescents who you would think would know better they're being affected by just scrolling and looking at pictures studies of undergraduate college students showed that the longer they use Facebook the stronger was their belief that their that others were happier than they were and because of teens impulse Natures impulsive Natures experts suggest that teens who post contact on social media are at risk of sharing intimate photos or highly personal stories and this can result in teens being bullied harassed even blackmailed because they often create posts without considering consequences or privacy concerns and you know what they'll say when you say something they'll say hey I got this you don't understand right I had a I have I was presented with the situation a little while back where um there was a a situation where two kids and now in school the kids had to have a phone or a device in order to communicate with the teacher in order to get lessons this is a small country School but every kid had to have a device that was connected on a network to be able to interact with their classmates and with the teacher otherwise you didn't get any curriculum you didn't get any any assignments you didn't get any results of your I mean it was all done based on the phone so give the kids two or three seconds and they figured out a way to communicate with one another and do all kinds of things right maybe two or three seconds sometimes less and and they're they're communicating back and forth and this one girl started to stalk this boy in my church and I mean this was a problem and I listened to that situation the parents told me about it and I said I will guarantee you that girl little girl's been abused and they were saying well this has never been said and I said I'll guarantee you that little girl's been abused and and she was wanting to confide in this boy and and so forth neither one of them were older than 12 years old and I said you gotta you can't you gotta go cold turkey with this I said you cannot say we'll just be friends and we're going to continue to I said you've got to cut that off and just last week the mother wrote me and said you know what it just came out that that girl was abused by her uncle when she was like seven or eight years old and she's looking for an audience and she's finding that audience in this other little boy in her class and hey he's dealing with with something very complex here right he's she's telling him some things that need to be reported to her parents and the pastor and the and the authorities right but kids are going this way they're not going this way they're going this way because that's what you do now you go this way everybody understand all right so let's look very quickly at some things that we could do with our kids number one protecting our teens you need to set some boundaries or limits kick scratch bite resist yell scream Panic your kids still need to have some boundaries and you need to talk to them about how to avoid letting social media dominate their lives and interfere with things like sleep School meals Etc and encourage a bedtime routine and I think this is important that avoids social media Electronic media and keep cell phones and tablets out of their bedrooms good luck but I think that's a good piece of advice because they don't need to sleep with their phone you can monitor your teen's accounts you to me you have to make a very tough decision about whether or when your kids are going to have a phone I get it and I'm not saying that you shouldn't have it because it's here it's like tubeless tires it's here and you're not gonna you're not gonna pray it away let's be realistic but you're going to have to be proactive to get on top of it as best you can now I will tell you as best you can you're still behind the eight ball because no matter how much you know and I don't don't think I'm being critical of you but no matter how much you know your kids know more than you do no matter how much you think you know about monitoring your kids phone activity or online activity your kids are way ahead of you they're moving at the speed of Youth and all they need to do is meet one kid on the playground who will update them on how to get around everything you put in place I'm just telling you that you might not believe me but it's true anyway but you need to let your team know that you'll be regularly checking their social media accounts on their phone and you should follow through with that and do it some of you are laughing sound no brother Barry my kids I'll tell you what your kids are your kids and uh you'd be surprised you'd be surprised explain what's not okay to your kids you need to explain what's not okay this these are the boundaries here that you're going to discourage your teen from gossiping spreading rumors bullying damaging someone's reputation online or otherwise and talk to your teen about what's appropriate and safe and give them examples and show them this is what's okay and this is what's not okay you should encourage the old-fashioned way of talking to someone in person remember that you guys are laughing you ever done it especially if your kid is vulnerable to social anxiety disorder meaning that oh I couldn't say anything face to face I could you know the number one phobia in the world the number one phobia there are all kinds of them spiders falling off Heights right there are all kinds of them then you know what the number one is public speaking having to stand in front of a more than one person and say something I was out of the room when they gave out that one but that is the number one phobia so you know what you want to do you want to encourage that in the right way I say it this way you want to disregard your children's fad and lean towards the bent do you know what that means you're the first person I've ever seen in the congregation say that all right a fad is something your kids get into because everybody's into it you know what it's the thing that excites them right now and Grandma comes along and finances that and you know we're all my my kids it was baseball cards right they got into baseball cards and here comes grandma with the checkbook sure let's buy whatever you want they have you know five thousand dollars worth of baseball cards and so forth and then a month later where are the baseball cards oh they're gone I sold them for 50 cents to someone in school that's a fan don't worry about The Fad don't Finance fads they're gonna be they're here they're gone right watch for the bent your child has a bent a bent is that innate ability or Talent OR gift that God gives them that is going to lean them a certain way and it's identifiable even at a young age I wish I had the picture but I do have a picture my wife took it of one of my boys who was in the crib in a one-piece sleeper okay so we're talking that age with tools and vacuum hoses in the crib with them he didn't want teddy bears he wanted tools and vacuum parts in his bed and then he would he'd go right off to sleep because he was comfortable with tools you know what he is he's an engineer and now he's an engineer he always said Dad I want to drive a tractor like from five or six I want to drive a tractor I said we should have called you John instead of Peter John Deere and he said I just want to drive a tractor and and I said Pete you you you're you're smart you could be more than that you could be a an engineer I don't want to be an engineer working an office I want to I want to drive the tractor I just want to be on a tractor somewhere and so one summer and I we I believe very strongly in mentorship you know and putting the kids involved in something to see if they want to do it for the rest of their life and I said tell you what we're going to do we're going to give you a job get you a job this year on a crew that lays water lines for upcoming housing projects and they they do you know buckets and and dozers and everything else and so we got him a job and he's working at this job with a bunch of guys shows up every day and I went there every day I made him his lunch and I brought him lunch every day and you know the guys on the crew were hey Mr Coffee how you doing you know and and you bring more than one lunch you know we look at Peter eating his lunch every day you know and uh so you know this this was a daily routine and one day Pete comes home and he says to me hey Dad I'm the only one in the crew who's not a felon laughs really oh yeah great I said well I gotta ask this question how do you fit in he said well I told him I got a speeding ticket one time and they're like all right Pete that's good enough you're one of us really at the end of summer though you know what he said man that was great he said I was on the Digger the whole time and he said it was great but he said I think I'll go to school and he became he's now a master engineer and uh signs the documents himself he's in management at Duke power and uh you know he's just a very successful guy but that's that's his bent in other words I didn't put that love for that in him that's his bent we'd go to a grad station uh gas station and when we when these guys were little and that we'd pull up and Pete would say I'll put the gas in Pete's out there and he's got the nozzle in he's changing the oil he's lifting the van pushing rotating tires that's what juicy he loves to do right that's his way I got to hold him back from doing major mechanical renovation on the van just because we're getting gas right that's that's his way and Andrew says Andrew says Hey Dad I'll pay so I give him the I give him the cash he goes in the gas station he comes out hey Dad there's a guy in there who has horses and he lives down the way and he's got a horse farm and he's got three or four kids and he invited us to come down I told him we probably could be all right he said we'll go down there and I realized Andrew look we're just getting gas you just you were supposed to just pay for gas but you know what he is he's a people person right he's a people guy and he just he just knows how to he's he had no knew no strangers he'd go up to anybody I mean when he was in high school he took judges our district judges out to lunch to learn what it was like to be a lawyer and and that's that's just because I believe in mentorship and he'd he was thinking about law school and so he'd call he'd he'd look on uh and ask me who's the who's the district attorney in Montgomery County and I'd say well so and so he'd look it up in the phone book remember those and and he'd call them up and say my name is Andrew Coffey or my name is Andrew Coffey and I'd like to take out the and he would he'd go to lunch with them and sit down talk with him he's just that kind of a guy now Peter wouldn't do that as a result Andrew got Peter to do all of his work but Peter made Andrew do all the public speaking in school you know all right so anyway encourage face-to-face contact it does still work and then we need to talk about social media we need to talk about habits and ask your teen how he or she is using social media and how it makes them feel and remind them that it is full of unrealistic images all right what social media will do to girls gaming will do the boys I'm not here to talk much about gaming except this is Grand Theft Auto 3. I don't know anything about Grand Theft Auto I don't have any games on my my kids hate my phone because my grandkids they'll come in and they'll say Papa can we use your phone and then they'll give it back to me in a few minutes because there's not there's nothing on it and uh and so I'm not I'm not the only when we we're homeschooled our kids so the only the only two things we ever have ever in our lives and we decided we made a decision early in life and we were not going to do computer games the only two things we ever had in our family history was Pac-Man you know that back then in DOS yeah yeah be quiet over there with you and then the other thing was Oregon Trail and we turned Oregon Trail into a field trip right so they were in school the whole time they were playing and didn't know it anyway I don't so I don't know anything about games however one of the largest most popular games games that are out there is Grand Theft Auto and according to the research it's based on what's called inverted morality so in order to win in order to succeed at this at this game you have to do you have to kill and hurt people okay so the way that you kill and hurt people is you do something that's inverted in a moral sense in order to achieve success so you have to accumulate weapons and ammunition in the game the way you do that is you find a policeman in the game and shoot him or kill him and take his guns and ammunition so you can shoot and kill other people now that's upside down right and and if we had the numbers of people who play this game it's unbelievable but that's what's called inverted morality now the game was purposely invented with inverted Morality In other words if if if this is good and this is bad it's like this now this is good okay now the Bible says woe to those that call evil good and good evil who substitute Darkness for light and light for Darkness who substitute bitter for sweet and Sweet for bitter here's an article about this inverted morality very just one screen we now live for the most part in a culture with an inverted morality for Christians it might surprise you but you are now considered evil for your views the good described in the Bible for those who see God is now considered Evil by the culture around you if you think there are any sins that are wrong the inverted culture around you will ridicule you for your Antiquated beliefs inversion has happened slowly but it's fully in place now that's one little short edited paragraph out of that whole article uh by this fellow here and it's just it's just incredible how calculated this is who knew that Satan was actually planning to do an end run around everything that was moral and turn it upside down get away with it and sell billions sell billions you know what he said why are you showing this because you're raising kids in a in a world and in a generation that considers this very normal I got invited to go to Europe last year to talk on family issues and the reason is is because the pastors over there got together and they realized the conversations of their own children were changing and they were saying why do people say something about homosexual marriages and why what's the big issue what's the what's this the stink about homosexual gay people and so forth and the pastors realize we've lived in a world where that's always been considered normal that's in the textbooks that's in school that's in daily life and they realize if we don't do something to reach this generation of kids they're lost it's so pervasive now when you go there they'll tell you it's America's problem but we're feeling it over here they're much more liberal over there than than we are here but it's a huge Global issue and you better not say anything against it and what we're looking at is this inverted morality it is a real problem all right can I go a little further and say this for some reason or another The Wall Street Journal picked up on this and found documents that were stored in Facebook or meta and they got their hands on documents that actually proved that Facebook knows all about the negative effect of social media on kids and Facebook owns Instagram and YouTube right I think and they don't okay do you own YouTube Google Google owns YouTube and and Facebook actually knows and documented the fact that there is there are repercussions there there's damage associated with constant use of these apps and we're going to do nothing about it somehow or another Wall Street Journal got a hold of this and it's called the Facebook papers okay now you can go find it the link is on the bottom of the screen and you'll you can Google this really easy and you'll find it there the Facebook files and you can find it this is one paragraph Facebook Inc knows in acute detail that its platforms are riddled with flaws that cause harm often in ways that the company fully understands and that's the central finding of a Wall Street Journal series based on a review of internal Facebook documents including research Reports online employee discussions drafts of presentations to Senior Management so somehow or another they got they tapped into this and found it and then did a series on that here's one of the Articles right here I have it printed out and I quote from it and you can go you can go find this and and let me give you one paragraph here from this researchers inside Instagram and owned by Facebook have been studying for years how it's photo sharing app and that's what it was designed for for facial photo uh photo photo use affects millions of young users and repeatedly the company founded Instagram is harmful for a sizable proportion percentage of them most notably teenage girls more so than other social media platforms so of all the social media platforms this one has the potential to be more damaging Facebook consistently played down the app's negative effects including comments to Congress and hasn't made its research public or available to academics or lawmakers who ask for it so Facebook is basically saying uh yeah we we do know but they're not giving out information and so forth they're now they're become much more tight-lipped about it all right so let's dig in just for a moment here right and I just stay with me I only got a couple of screens left here but you say okay what's the what's the deal with Instagram in 2010 users were introduced to Instagram a social platform that focused on body image and lifestyle so it was mainly just for kids to be able to take images of themselves a recent report reviewed by The Wall Street Journal stated more than 40 percent of Instagram users are 22 years old and younger and 2.35 billion users log on the Instagram in the U.S every day that's not in the U.S compared to 32 that's in the world each day compared to 32 percent of teen Facebook users so kids are going to under 22 are gonna uh proportionately use Instagram a lot more than they are Facebook you're giving away your age when you use Facebook apparently I don't have it I don't have either one of them and I I don't want them but I'm just telling you what what it says well while Instagram launched with the idea that consumers could use the platform for connecting and sharing photos with friends it began to take on negative aspects of the web and Adolescence we're starting to report anxiety depression even Suicidal Thoughts especially for girls after thorough internal study Facebook concluded these emotions were tied to Instagram specifically not social media in general but specifically where's this where's this problem area where what group are we talking about here is what the study looked at and they they narrowed it down to specifically Instagram more specifically 32 percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies Instagram made them feel worse one-third now here's what's here's what's sad okay the next this this part and the next screen teenagers have the ability to consistently check on their status right they can they can see are we still popular how many friends do we have how many they're they're not really friends right they're virtual friends so when they fall down and they need somebody to hold their hand that's not they're not there when you need somebody to babysit your cat they're not there hey when you have your birthday they're not there bringing you a present or your cake right friends friends real friends in life are different I know I'm over 30 but friends in life are different but a lot of kids feel like I have a I have 1500 friends but they're not there to say happy birthday or they're not there to put their arm around them when they go through a tough time right so it would be good to sit down and Define for your kids what a friend really is a friend sticks closer than a brother the Bible says right and you should develop some friendships by doing this put your phone down and talk to that person haha in one such study 40 of Instagram users who reported feeling unattractive said the feeling began on the app on Instagram so when they started to feel unattractive now they now they're dissatisfied with how they look their weight and so forth the feeling began on the app almost seems like this app has a mind of its own we call that a Spirit by the way yet Instagram's researchers conveyed that those that had negative psychological effects of the platform were not logging off so that was their response they're not why don't they just shut it down why don't you just turn it off or delete the app now watch what it says adolescent girls reported they knew the app was causing anxiety but they didn't have the inner strength to turn it off or delete the app altogether referring to the app as an addiction or habit let me see it again how many of you have daughters ask them what they're doing on their phone ask them what they're doing with their friends because now all of a sudden listen in in a story brother random tells he talks about these parents and so forth and they provided their kids with this with that something else and he said but you know the wrongest thing they did the wrongest thing was not to evangelize their kids because you know what's going to help your kids overcome this is a relationship with Jesus Christ and a new birth you're not going to pray social media away you're not going to convince your kids that you don't need a phone and you don't need to be connected you can talk to your kids about boundaries and things that you need to put in place and proper responsible use and transparency and all and and those things are good and I'm not discouraging that at all but you have a culture out there that is overwhelmingly pressing your kid to participate be one of us and friends to a teenager is everything and you've got to be proactive in that but I will tell you something you will only be able to hold their hands so long they need a relationship with Jesus Christ and you know where they will see the benefits of a relation and the fruits of a relationship with Christ more than anywhere else is in you and your influence as a Christian in your life in your conduct as a Christian and your example as a Christian in your household is going to do more to influence your children than anything that they'll get on a PowerPoint you understand what I'm saying because kids now they they look and file information so quickly I mean it's there you know you know move on move on move on move on move on and a little of it registers they're doing school on it they're doing uh their social life is all on it uh they're traveling on it uh you know I mean everything takes away their banking is on it everything is on it all together everything's a QR code and everything's a link and everything's you know so and so they're continually continually and more continually exposed and bombarded by all of it there hey as parents you cannot say it doesn't matter it does will it affect them it will not all of it not all of them would be suicidal but I will tell you that a lot of them will look at it and say wow I have a miserable life and it's be it's because they're looking at things that are simply what other kids are doing now let me see if I can if I can get this to work here I I embedded it but I really don't know if I can this is a oh come on me me and Technology hello I just came to the end of the internet you know what we're going to do we're going to move right on that is a one-year-old sorry I must it must not be connected I'm sorry I didn't do that that's a one-year-old who in The Opening screen of that it's a very it's a viral YouTube one that has this one-year-old girl she's on an iPad and she's going like this she's moving Pages page page page and it's it's got all kinds of images on it and she picks up a magazine and she's going like this on the on the magazine and then she's that computer doesn't work so she goes back to the iPad and does this and there's all kinds of activity and she goes back to the magazine and she's got her one finger one-year-old she's got a finger like that and she's going like this on a magazine broke my heart when I saw it I thought wow because what what we're looking at here is not an evil one-year-old we're looking at where the culture is actually going and the culture is is in is on purpose they're doing something to draw that younger generation in because that's a guarantee that they have they have a future right for this whole process Let Me Tell You Folks as Christians we don't need to be passive about this whole thing and I would encourage you not to be passive about it you had to be proactive in your household and say as for me and my house we're going to serve the Lord and in this area too so you know what Mom and Dad we need to sit down and make some ground rules even if the ground rules are very basic like we're going to have no Electronic media at night when we go to bed we're going to go to bed and our kids don't need to have a connection with the entire Cosmos while they sleep so you know what we're going to put the phone here and we're going to let you sleep all right that might be that might be one thing I don't you I mean you have to sit down and think about this okay I don't have kids at home so you don't you have to think about this because what I'm telling you is that someone else is thinking about your kids if you're not somebody else is this is not some random all of a sudden we wake up in this e-world this has been planned and I'm not a conspiracy theorist I just know that Satan is more than just a figment of our imagination we live in the God we live under the influence of the God of this evil age in this world and we live in Satan's Eden so as as if you want to have a Christian family you're going to have to say it's from me and my house we serve the Lord and we're going to create an atmosphere where the holy spirit's always welcome so you know what you you got to roll up your sleeves and think about this you need to do your research you need to ask other parents you need to uh you know incorporate things even if it's just a baby step at a time because once you let the genie out of the bottle it's really hard to get it back in So if you've got kids that don't have phones yet you need to be really thinking about their access to social media here's how we're going to do it here's how we're going to plot this and and you need to be thinking about that because this is a huge and it's going to become Huger as we go on because exponentially it changes if I brought you statistics next week they'd be different because it's when we're talking about a third of the world's population hello we're talking about major influences here and now they're beginning to figure this out I brought this along this book right here and uh this is this and I'm I'm promoting it I'm just saying that this was one that was very interesting the title is the collapse of parenting and it's by Dr Leonard Sachs and uh he he makes an astounding observation he's not in the message all right he's not don't don't shoot me but but he makes an astounding observation that there's been a huge transfer in our culture in our time there's been a huge transfer of authority and respect for authority from parents to children so now it's up to the children what they want let the children decide let them do what they want to do this is how they learn to make decision and so he said in our culture there's been this huge transfer of respect and respect for authority to children now children essentially are calling the shots I have to have a phone because all my kids all my friends have a phone and there's there's in a sense the the role of parents and the authority of parents is essentially undermined in our society and it's brought all kinds of repercussions and is just extraordinary how accurate he actually was and it's extraordinary to see how brother Branham talked about this in the 60s in the 60s and talking about the breakdown of motherhood and fatherhood and so forth so let me remind you again that this quotation brother bran says we got to think of the others that's coming on behind us these young people and so forth a place for our children our daughters we don't want them out in the world in those things like that our daughters we don't want them out in the world things like that we want them girls raised like their mothers and and who's going to make arrangements for that your pastor is going to make arrangements for no the Holy Spirit no he doesn't say that Jeffersonville is going to make decisions now no we've got to make arrangements you have to get fathers you have to get involved fathers you got to take your girls out for a date fathers you got to take your girls out to Olive Garden or somewhere else that the ordinary probably wouldn't go and and make your daughter feel special because if you don't make her feel special somebody else will you don't pay your attention and tell her how beautiful she is and encourage her and so forth if you don't do that somebody else is going to do it and you should be her prince you should be her hero you should be the guy that makes her feel special and you should be the guy and I told my sons I said hey I got two granddaughters I told Andrew I said if some dude shows up at the door and wants to get involved with my granddaughters I said I'll let you stand there first but behind you I will have a weapon I'm just warning you I will have a weapon we're not streaming this right some knobhead who comes along and says I'll look after her Mr Coffee yeah right knucklehead go get a job look on page six of your notes there I have a message this is me I have a message on behalf of all young Godly men to all you parents raising girls today I have a message on behalf of all young Godly men to all you parents raising girls today in less than ideal conditions with little or no outside support sodom's at the door hold a standard High be courageous and strong help turn these young girls into sisters who have a respect for God and his word who knows how to labor with a husband as he serves God who can handle the duties of a home and manage manage it on one income help her to choose character in a man and may she not compromise her virtue for popularity I have a message for people who are raising girls today you should encourage that girl to seek character and to seek a young man who can get a job hold a job in a sister who recognizes that but I will say this that it's unfair for us to say that the girls have to be this our young men need to be trained to get a job to work and be responsible and finish the job and to be able to save money and to be able to stop buying toys and invest in their future and invest in their family's future and to be able to uh you know learn how to how to fend for themselves and to be proactive and to be on fire for God and to be in a place where God wants them to be in their teen years and 18 years and in their career they need to be thinking in the future they need to be thinking about the wife and family they will eventually have they need we need to encourage our young men to be that way because when you talk to girls today teenage girls at winter youth retreat or somewhere like that they'll say well there are no and there are no good guys well you know what that's not entirely true but I will say to the guys all right guys this is what the girls are saying and they'll say well the girls got their head in romance novels and romance stuff on on the internet and they're all uh Instagram Fanatics and everything else they're all concerned about their parents and so forth and I'll say girls what do you think of that and and going back and forth you know what there's a lack of there's a lack of a very simple thing that God told us we're going to take with us when we leave here and that's character children are not automatically born with character they learn character they develop character in life guess who's going to be the primary coach for that the Bible tells us in Proverbs chapter 4 get wisdom get understanding proverbs 4 7 wisdom is the principle thing therefore get wisdom with all thy getting get understanding Proverbs 16. how much better is it to give wisdom than gold is anybody unclear all right how do we do it brother Barry here we go Proverbs 29 the rod and reproof give wisdom there's a thing called discipline in Scripture and it doesn't hurt for you to teach your young man and your young lady that discipline still matters and they need to practice a discipline in their life and discipline in their stewardship saving money conducting myself in an appropriate way to be able to control myself in social media and all the other things that require a little discipline in our world because they live in a world where discipline has disappeared so in our house this is what we prioritized in our house and I'm just telling you giving you a little insight in our house we made sure that faith and spiritual issues were number one we go to church it doesn't matter who's visiting it doesn't matter uh what's going on around us you know we go to church sure we we we keep God first and and that's that's simply what that means that was a that was a priority secondly we develop a Biblical order we find out what the Bible requires of us we want to know what pleases God and we're going to try to apply that in our house so that God can see that and bless our household as a result of it thirdly we're going to handle our finances like Christians so we are going to pay our tithes we're going to put God first we're going to try to do what we can to be out of debt we're not streaming right but we are recording too bad I will tell you something I insist that if I'm going to marry a young couple they go through at least one session of pre-marital council at least one okay and what I've learned over my years is that one of the things that we need to do is teach young people about finances you know why because credit is available credits available and oh my you're sure we're recording now right I'm only kidding I'm not only a steward over my money and what God gives me but I'm a steward over my time I'm a steward over my children the steward means that somebody's handling something that's not theirs but they're given charge of it for a season money my children I don't know my children we have them for a Time stewardship matters and this is a priority in our household also that we're going to have standards and boundaries and discipline in our household that are appropriate and what I how I explain this is that we have a ladder of responsibility a ladder of responsibility meaning that for kids as they grow they're allowed to climb up the ladder which gives them more freedom if they can handle the height they're at they can stay there but if they're irresponsible with that level of Freedom they've got to come back a notch all right so we're going to let you go on a Boy Scout trip my guys were all in Boy Scouts pre-gay Boy Scouts okay I want to want to be they all have their Eagle Scout as a result of them being involved in that which we we're homeschooled so we wanted to have them involved in some other wholesome things to do I became I was I held every position in The Scouting organization except scoutmaster I was a cub master chaplain Assistant Scout Master I've done everything in discounting movement except be a scoutmaster but I did that because my boys were there so rather than just send them I went with them so when they had a camp out guess who was there and when they had an event I was there because I was part of the staff right I was part of the group so I saw what was going on and I was with them for the vast majority of their years at The Scouting they all went through they all got their Scouts Eagle Scout which is the highest honor in scouting and as a result of that uh you know I was able to share with them and then if there was something going on or something funny happening we I could observe it we could talk about it I could say something to the scout master or whatever else uh you know those were I was I was privy to it in other words I was a witness of what was going on so there were there were wholesome basically Back Then There Were wholesome things and they were they were good for our boys so they they went through that and and the the discipline and the standards and all the rest of it that were in place uh you know that was a part of our upbringing for them and and the ability for them to learn to interact with other kids and get along and all the other things that go with that but there has to be boundaries in that you have to establish boundaries for kids and and the Bible has a lot to say about out boundaries here the other thing that we're going to prioritize is that we resolve differences because they're going to have to resolve differences when they get older they're going to have to do it at work they're going to have to do it in their own marriage and lastly we're going to learn to do whatever it takes to create and maintain a godly atmosphere so these are the priorities for our house okay brother Branham said about job he said he got kind of worried he had a bunch of children and they were worldly mingling with the world and all parents know what a feeling that is when your children your very heart begins to mingle with the world now let me stop for a minute because I I'm a I'm a student of the Hebrew language the Biblical Hebrew language I don't speak it but I wanted to know when God made a statement what did he really mean what did he really what was he really saying and that's that's just me but I often was puzzled by this idea that job was offering as sacrifices for his children and they hadn't sinned he offered sacrifices in case they sinned right that's essentially the message in that in that first chapter of job and Satan says well hey you know I mean he's covered he's got protection I can't get out of it you take the covering off take the protection away and I'll I'll make them I'll make him say something different and and I wondered I wondered about this this principle or the reason that job was actually making sacrifices continually for his children in case they sinned and in the Hebrew language it it describes something that you'll understand right away that job knew his children were raised in this message and there were job's children and you know what job's my father and I've been at all the camps and I've Been Everywhere been around this message all my life you know what I got a little I got a little liberty here I can dabble in this dabble in that after all my dad is job and I can venture outside the lines a little bit and you know what that is that's a spirit of entitlement and that's what the Hebrew identifies they feel like well I'm in the message all these years and my dad's brother Sam and I got you know we go to all the meetings and brother Sam's well-known person he believes the message you know what and I'm not picking on you guys but I am I say this to my guys all the time just because your brother Barry's Sons doesn't give you this the the right to feel entitled to some special blessing that you don't need to toe the line or something else so you know what he's doing he's offering sacrifices in case that Spirit of entitlement gets a hold of my kids and they feel like well I can cozy up with a girl and I can do this and you know what we've always been around the message we're well known we're pretty popular that's a spirit that's gone nowhere that spirit is still here and there's a lot of young people today who feel very much like you know what I've never missed a day at church and we go to all the camps and we don't have any tattoos and you know we know who brother Branham is and all the rest of it God owes me something let me tell you God doesn't owe you anything and the moment thank you the moment you start to feel like I'm entitled to certain blessings and I'm entitled to certain benefits here just because I'm around the message you better hope that somebody's offering sacrifices for you somewhere and brother Branham said they were out dabbling in the world they were worldly mingling with the world and job knew where that was coming from this sense of entitlement and he knew that my goodness they're not sensing the need of sincerity themselves they're not sensing the need of their own sense of waywardness and they're drifting here and the cultures promoting that and it's so easy and so forth and so job is you know is a wiser person he's looking at that and saying my goodness I better I better do what I can here brother Graham says he talks about Billy Paul and he talks about he says we don't have a Christian School in in our in our town he says in the worldly children out there and I said I thought of sending my boys to school and and my board is school and everything he said get drilled into him and all the other things there that brother bam is concerned about as a parent he he's not he's not missing the point he is he is understanding that this this is actually a real issue this is actually a real issue now let me just for a moment here just for time brother Branham said we have such a juvenile crime wave Across the Nation he said but really I think it started in the home and I think parents begin to let go and if the child has been raised up in a good old-fashioned Godly home I don't say it would be all over certainly not but it would certainly give that child the right kind of influence we need to stop right there and say Lord let me be determined to create the right kind of atmosphere in my household Lord if my children even are grown and gone or grown let me do what I can to make things right and let me be a vessel that I can influence my grandchildren because I have an intergen generational responsibility let me do what I can to influence my household my offspring my third generation fourth generation whatever let me be that way I don't want to be that statistic I don't want to be that that parent that brother braham's talking about here I think our responsibility is clear I I think our mission is clear and if you want to have a Christian family it isn't going to automatically just happen it's going to be the result of things you decide of things you do and the sooner we do things God's way the better off your family is going to be let's pray Heavenly Father we've said lots of things Lord there's lots of principles we discover and find in the scripture and the message Lord to teach us good things but Lord I know that we are called not to be just hearers but Lord may we model and demonstrate and teach and instill these things in our kids even when it's not easy even when it requires a sacrifice and a challenge in our part help us Lord I pray as we move through these cycles of life and realize Lord that we have a world whose views are very hostile to ours and in very subtle ways try to capture the imagination and the hearts of our children I pray you'd help us to be discerning I pray you'd help us to be wise and I pray you'd help us to use all the resources available to stem the influence of the culture around us we love you Lord and we thank you for your word and what it teaches us have your way now we pray bless our fellowship in Jesus lovely name amen and all God's people said I don't want to be a parent all right one reminder before we give it to Brother Sam this question box over here or see me I'd love to be able to hear from you and questions or things you think I'm not going to talk about okay but Sam great questions here I'm going to deal with in a minute but just uh on the on the Fly anybody got anything that they want to say complaints criticisms want your money back um anything at all Floors open I've answered all your questions yeah when am I coming back I I was in Hungary two weeks ago I was at home last week I wear a name tag when I come home to my church and then I'm here this weekend I'm in Iceland the next weekend and then you know I mean it just goes on and on so uh five years or so I can be bought but I'm only kidding I we'd love to have brother Samuel down our place and um you know I just I felt bad that it's about a ratio of seven to one I think but uh I I wanted to come up for a while and glad to be here so I appreciate the opportunity but I do not know when I'm coming back that's for sure and comments I was in Vancouver a month ago I revise the whole thing I I redid it for him and I was slow getting it to him because I revised the whole thing and it's not necessarily new principles but it's new data as I like to be based on the data you know like and say well this is the way it's trending or moving well that changes very quickly so yeah yeah but it requires a lot of keeping up you know and then I talk to parents I listen to you know I talk to my boys I I talk to different people who are good at this you know and listen to what's what's being said and anything else comments sister yes yes um I I think I think you could summarize it and how to make your home more more welcoming and pleasant for the Holy Spirit um there's lots of different things that you can do but uh you I could summarize it and say you have to apply the token so in the early in the first Exodus when you look at that they they were told to go through their homes and to clean it and get out everything that didn't belong anything that would be considered defilement in that home and get it out so it could be books it could be music um it could be anything along that line anything that you wouldn't do if the Holy Spirit was sitting next to you that's kind of the approach you know and they had to they had to purge uh foods that didn't belong like 11 11 is a type of sin they had to purge all of that out and um you know they so I mean your your phone has probably a fair bit of 11 on it right so we're not just talking about physical stuff here you know music um the the things that you listen to things that you watch uh it's all so accessible now you know it's also available and uh then I think you know you have to we all have disagreements for instance in our house and a disagreement can be Grievous to the holy spirit so you know how you disagree and how you resolve differences is a big issue and uh you know if you find yourself disagreeing a lot grieving the Holy Spirit a lot you probably need a conversation with your pastor or somebody about you know dealing with that if you've got rebellious children that's going to drive the spirit of God away um you know there's there's all kinds of things when you start to look at it but I guess you know they say when you're going to sell your house you need to do a curbside view or something what do they call it a curbside appeal so you drive by and look at it and say if I was going to buy this house what would I do to improve the look of it so that just driving by and looking at it from the curb what's appealing and what's not okay now you're probably not going to do that because every doodad you got in your yard you put there and you bought it some you know junkyard sale I'm not saying you but but if you get somebody to say drive by my house and tell me what you see that's kind of an unbiased look you know you want to have somebody give you a curb appeal look so okay uh based on the message you know what what is the message focusing on what is what is that and then you can also even talk to your children and say like my my boys are good thinkers and they were you know as they were getting older is are there things about us that we should not have here or things we shouldn't be doing as there are things someone you trust that you could talk to and say is there some way we can improve our home life our appearance everything it all matters it all goes into the mix the devil is in the details very often and and sometimes it can be little things I remember one time dealing with a girl she was at an altar in Montreal and she was at an altar praying and praying and praying and you know trying to get this breakthrough and in the spirit and she I mean it was almost midnight and she was still there at the altar and finally I went to her and I I just said you know Sister um the only thing I can tell you is that if just let just let the Holy Spirit comb back in your life and see if there's anything there that you need to get rid of in your life or anything that's holding the holy and then she stopped me right in the middle she said it's the books and I said what do you mean she said oh and she it was like it lifted off to her immediately she knew she had there was a series of books that were in her closet that she was reading and she had them in there because she was hiding him she didn't want her mother to see him and and so forth there's a youth meeting and um so she just it just it just dawned on her when it dawned on her it released her you know and she just got up and walked away Victorious and happy and went home and got rid of the books and that that free it's sometimes a little thing that you've had around so long that it doesn't really even seem to count but it did does that help anything else if if I had to do things differently my boys I would have girls that's not true I'm only joking because girls squeal and God knew what I could handle and what I couldn't so hey you come up behind me and squeal you're you're gonna get a knock in the head so um if I had my time back the raising my boys how long you got that's a great question my wife would probably be a good one to answer that one uh you know I ask them I'll give you their email addresses you want to ask them um you asked them me and you can talk later okay what did they say wow give him a 20. will you huh yeah we I mean you know it it's we worked at it it's it's not automatic and I think that's a lot of a lot of the um uh the reality that people need to uh Embrace is that it's not automatic it's the devil is not going to leave you alone say oh man they're served they're in the message I can't do anything with them that that's not true he's gonna he's gonna go after you even more so because you're set up as a Target you know and uh what would I do differently man no one's ever asked me that question before um no no there's just so many things can you identify something yeah appreciating every stage and age more every phase they go through uh that I'm saying that because your your voice is not real caring in here but my my mother-in-law always used to say me enjoy them when they're little enjoy them when they're little when when they're little or feel like killing them you know I mean because they're they're doing stupid all the time and we're thinking wow this is so frustrating we don't sleep you know I mean it was just terrible right and uh but now now I caught myself telling my one of my sons a little while ago enjoying while they're young enjoy them while they're young because it changes it changes so fast and they're they're pushing to be you ever ask a seven-year-old how old are you seven almost eight now you ask me how old I am never mind but they're wanting to be old so they're they're they're they're pushing to grow up and and you know you're wanting to grow up you know do this yourself and there's just so many demands when they're little and I think you get impatient with that but uh man I I do anything to have them back under my roof and you know live in living there I sure would in in many many ways what else we we you know I mean we had a lot of fun we did a lot of fun things and did trips and we did you know we fished and we traveled and I took him on the mission field all over the place and they I took them you know many many countries in the world sometimes just me and me and one of them or me and two of them or whatever and uh brother Bill Sanchez is here we he just reminded me of he was interpreter when I took Andrew and Peter they were quite young uh 14 15 years old to Honduras you know and and he still remembers that and and uh you know they've just been everywhere and uh that's that was a great blessing you know to be able to do that I'd like to do more of that um ah man I'll have to think about that do you know anything else you could add to that I mean I that's a great question and I'm I'm not really sure of all the answers there um these are really great questions and we might get a little bit more time here as a father how would you deal with a daughter that refuses to go out with you for lunch or for dinner or on a date no matter how many times you've tried as a father the definition of insanity foreign is to try to do something over and over again and expect the same results right you know is that it different results you do the same thing over and over again if she's refusing excuse me to go out uh with you then don't ask her out I would try another way because she's got a love language that's different than what you're trying to do so you know just say hey I saw these flowers today I bought these for you hey you know have a wonderful day and just do something like that or write her a note or um you know in some way show affection and try to learn what what way affects her it may just be a compliment it may just be a gift it may just be a physical touch you know putting your arm around her and just say hey you look great today and that may be it some girls would love my granddaughters love to go out on a date with their dad and um you know that's really special to them but that's that's their language you know that's the way that they relate so you just have to keep exploring but if this way doesn't work don't keep trying to do it do something different that's that's what I would do now whoever asked me about camp ekon I want to talk to you after this is over okay I don't know who you are but I want to talk to you because I have a story about came back on So You Know Who You Are um should a Christian be involved in National politics um and and or voting and seeing the negative path that the nation is going should we teach our children to be involved and vote for candidates who support positive Christian values my goodness we need people who have good Christian values in office I said we need to have people who have good Christian values in office and if you can vote for somebody who has good Christian values and and uh see them elected that'd be great brother Branham voted I could show you the quote if you want it and he voted for Nixon and uh uh brother Branham was not a politician you know he didn't play the political game or anything like that but um I I newly became an American citizen a couple of years ago and so I was eligible to vote and I did and uh was proud of it uh I you know to me it's all in God's control but I remember this when brother Brown talked about Madeleine Murray O'Hare who we mentioned earlier and how she changed laws within our country that are the effect of those laws are still Rippling down through our time and she did that by herself you know and got support brother random asked the question back then he said where were all the ministers who should have been crying out in the wilderness where are they all he said everybody stayed silent nobody said a thing he said the preacher should have been up there first saying things about that and defending prayer and they didn't do it so I'm not a campaigner or a politician person at all but I could show you in the Bible where uh we we we should be conscious of what goes on in our little world and I I don't have time but we could I could show you that maybe later on how do you approach an older younger adult as an oxymoron isn't it it's like airplane food or Microsoft Works or death benefits how do you approach an older younger adult that indulges okay I'll handle that one we'll do that one a little bit differently and my son is a good boy and a Christian and we homeschool and it is grueling experience to get them out of bed in the morning he wants to do better can you give tips tell him to go to bed earlier um you know if he's if he's plugged into Netflix for two hours after he goes to bed uh it could be a Cause right I mean it could be something like that but uh if if there's no medical reason or anything like that uh teenagers do you know physiologically need more sleep but you know I I would be saying hey um you know in in our in our house here uh this is the way we would like to we'd like to structure set it up this way it's our responsibility school is not our not our decision it is the government's decision that every child should go to school if you were in a public school you couldn't show up at school at three o'clock in the afternoon and say okay I'm here let's start if you were working on a job you couldn't roll in at 10 30 and say all right so school is not just academics school is training for life and so uh therefore in in a sense what you're looking at is a shift of authority who's got the authority here the child is calling this shot right as a as a parent as a boss as the head of the house I think you need to probably you know Let's uh let's make some decisions here we're going to abide by it you might want to work with your young person and say hey we're not trying to make this like Stalag 13 but we're you know we do have an order in our house and we're going to ask you to respect this we'll respect you and we'll you know come to a decision here but if in the real world this is how things work and so uh this is how we're going to do it here wow for girls what's the appropriate age to continually dress them in skirts and dresses the same question for boys I have a very clear answer on that don't dress Boys in skirts and dresses I don't know if you missed that part this morning um sorry I don't mean to make fun I remember I remember years ago when one of our boys was invited to be in a wedding and they they were going to have the ring bearers they were at that age and their ring bears were going to wear shorts in the in the wedding and I I remember you know it was a decision that I made and I I thought you know they're old enough to know that difference when they're I think brother Brandman used the word toddler I think and he said you know when they're crawling and toddler and so forth he said you know the the dress distinction was not that important but as soon as they get old and conscious of the fact that what they're wearing is is different you know that's a that's an appropriate age and when you say like you know an appropriate age that's different for for kids like some kids are aware at an earlier age than others it's just like some kids go through puberty a little bit earlier than others boys generally go later than girls and and so on so sometimes it's a matter of judging the child and and looking at their uh their attitude about it and you know how they're able how they respond to that but um I I don't know that there's a definite number of an age there uh that you could you could say that all right one more if your child uh if your children are homeschooled and they would like to do Sports and extracurricular activities like music piano and guitar and so forth how do you balance keeping them in a Christian Fellowship while not Sheltering them and that's that's a great question and there's there's a lot there like um there is a just there's now more Alternatives uh available now to homeschoolers and it's not just stay at home and use you're you're excluded from every activity in the world there's lots of kids now who educate at home and are in school for labs they're in school for sports they're in school for music they're in school for band they're in school for this and that and uh I think as a parent you got to be careful about how much you involve your kids because you know they're in they're in that environment and you've gotta you gotta monitor that you got to make a decision about that um about how much you want them involved in those things in the world and just because it's popular and just because we're doing AP classes you know advanced placement and all of that that doesn't mean that's necessarily the will of God for kids because if a child is graduating from high school at 11 years old and now they're the next step is college a lot of the 11 year olds are not ready really for college and uh you know so you you you gotta you gotta really think about that and you know there's uh Bao online Bible Way Academy online my wife is a teacher she's one of the instructors and Bao and she'd be glad to answer any questions you might have about that but that's a community of message kids they're just message kids from all over the world uh New Zealand Australia and Europe and Canada and U.S and uh that is a registered I mean that's a regular school they do it online she teaches for two different academies my wife does and one of them is the bao and it's all message kids so it's a nice community and they have uh I do devotionals sometimes for them and all the kids around the world are plugged in I can see them on my screen and uh it was Jason Watkins did the last one uh their last devotional and uh it's operated out of the U.S and it's a very incredible School excellent teachers and they have uh music I got some parents of students here and they do music they do activities they do programs they do drama singing and all kinds of things and they can do it online now you know it's pretty neat uh all the stuff they can do online so uh you don't have to have your kids enrolled in a public school to do some of that extracurricular activity uh there are other avenues now that you can do that but uh if if you have a question related to that my wife is here she's uh I I consider her to be an expert in that area uh in home education online education which is different uh than just doing a course on the internet uh online learning is a different animal altogether and she's considered to be an expert in that and uh so and we've also homeschooled four of our boys and uh so forth so she's got the scars to prove a lot of that stuff so I'll defer homeschool questions to her and you're certainly welcome to pick her brain because she's got a lot of information good suggestions and some alternatives for for that but Bao online is a good community of message believing kids that uh that are something worth looking at if you're if you're interested in that okay let's let's jump in because we're going to run out of time here Proverbs chapter 24 uh the scripture says through skillful I mean I'm I'm on page eight uh in your book here through wisdom is in house build it and by understanding it is established by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious Pleasant riches a wise man a strong yea a man of knowledge increases strength for by wise counsel Thou shalt make thy War and in the multitude of counselors there's safety here it is in the Amplified version I like this do skillful and godly wisdom as a house a life or a home and a family so a house is a generic term for what goes on inside the building okay biblically speaking and by understanding it is established on a sound and good foundation that's your part your part and by knowledge shall its chambers of every area be filled with all precious and pleasant riches and a wise man is strong and is better than a strong man A wise man is better than the strong man and a man of knowledge increases and strengthens his power for by wise counsel you can wage your warn in the abundance of counselors there is Victory and safety brother Brandon prayed help us this morning Lord to take Corrections from the spirit and the word that we might prepare ourselves as we move away from the doors this morning determining our heart to live a better life than we have in the past I think that's a great prayer to start what we're doing here today this afternoon so I've mentioned this already we're coming back to the definition here just as just a refresher uh Christian family is a group of people who are truly related to each other through marriage birth and adoption and are committed first and foremost to the person on the work of Christ Faithfully witnessing to the love and power and the forgiveness of God you can fill in these blanks here I left those blank in your in your booklet there um my house is a place where the holy spirit's always welcome it's a place that's separate from Sodom and it's a place where preparations are made to leave this world all right we're going to look at four pillars of corrective discipline and this is going to focus this afternoon for a little bit here on the subject of discipline and this is a kind of a disappearing art uh in our in our culture because as I've said there's a massive shift to giving kids Authority and to give and being passive when it comes to discipline um and it does not work in the long run it does not work and even in the short run it doesn't work and therefore there are different types of discipline I am I will tell you out of the gate I'm not I'm not soft towards anyone who is abusive to their children and we should get this out of the way that I don't think that making your kids drink vinegar and hurting your kids marking your kids causing excess pain for your kids any kind of verbal physical or emotional abuse is abuse and you have to be very careful today in our world because the word abuse is thrown around a lot more freely and you can get in trouble very quickly if you want to spank your kids in the parking lot of Target because they got a camera on you and I have a brother in my church who's a management person a Target and I will tell you they have cameras and uh you you need to be very wise in relation to discipline and how you do it because uh you can get in trouble real quick and you can make somebody mad and the tide can turn very quickly on you so in our world today there's a lot of people who are against what I'm going to tell you and you have to yet yet you have to fulfill the Mandate given to you as parents because you're acting uh as a representative of the kingdom and in the Kingdom there are no spoiled brats right okay so if there's no spoiled brats in the Kingdom thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven right thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and so therefore our actions should be a reflection of what goes on in the Kingdom okay and you had to be mindful of two things at the same time you're living in a fallen world and uh there's there's you have an enemy here in this world that would like to Corner you and intimidate you and stop you from doing the right things and the biblical things in our world we have an enemy Prince of the power of the air but we also have a boss who's watching us and uh he's given you those children he hasn't given those children to uh your pastor he hasn't given the children to the Sunday school teacher he hasn't given those kids to your the kids teacher he's given those kids to you and so you have to take the initiative to raise the kids in a Biblical way so let's look at this spiritual discipline is first of all a discipline of the heart and that's that's mainly I would say how God deals with us that you can hear something and be under conviction and God wants you to change and or repent and or adjust because it's in the word right many times like you coming here you're hearing things that you realize oh wow you know what I hate it but he's right and you realize I we've been kicking that can down the road we need to change that about our household we need to tell our you know deal with our kids over this subject that's a discipline of the heart and you're doing it because the word says not because brother Barry does that not because my pastor tells me that I'm doing it because the word says so we we make changes based on Bible and message principles and the ultimate aim and that's that's what God does he disciplines us to create or Foster a better relationship between you and him so you want to create a better relationship between you and your kids but ultimately your kids in Christ okay so yeah how how we do that is important so Hebrews 12 says he have not resisted unto blood striving and this is a chapter about discipline here and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as children my son despise not thou the chastening of the Lord hold on to that word chasten nor faint when thou art rebuked of him despise not it's easy to despise the chastening of an elder of a father or mother but he says despise not thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth so this is God's way this is the process of going through adoption and that's another story in itself but the word chasten here it it is the Greek word Padilla and this is um this is a really important word and it means so chastening now means the whole training and education of a child which relates to the cultivation of mind and morals and employs for this purpose commands and admonitions reproof and Punishment it also includes the training and care of the body so when we talk about chastening our children it is everything that's involved in shaping them into the adult they're supposed to be the the formation you were talking about formation here we're trying to remove bad ideas and put in good ideas we're trying to remove bad habits and put in good habits we're trying to take out immoral thoughts and and expose them to good moral principles and we employ everything we have in order to do that so when you chasten your children this is a an ongoing long-term training and care of themselves because they they need to learn about how to conduct themselves in public they need to learn how they they should talk and respond to adults they should learn how to look after their clean up their room um all right listen I remember one time we were going somewhere and I was I was I had all the boys with me they're all still small and I remember walking down the sidewalk and I was going into a store and they were kind of piling in on top of one another and you know pushing ahead of their mom and everything else I said hey hey stop stop dupids come out here and I had them sit down on a bench and I said what if somebody was looking at us and how you're acting you're acting like a bunch of monkeys on steroids and I said how would it how would it how do you think people would look at us and say wow we're just a bunch of ramshackle kids and then you know they were dressed poorly and everything it wasn't a formal thing that we were doing but you know I said it is important for us to to present ourselves in a in a better way than what we're doing here and I'm not just talking about dress here but I'm talking about your conduct and how you're treating one another and you know I mean I was there first I had to handle first no you know I'll kill you hey I said you know the Bible says in Timothy that Paul told Timothy be thou an example of the Believers in word and conduct and faith and so forth be thou an example of the Believers doesn't say be thou an example to the Believers it says be an example of the Believers so in other words what that means is that I could be able to go around among this room in a room full of Believers and say Here's what the message produces in a set of parents you would be an example of the Believers who are parents and I should be able to go to my boys and say here's an example of a good Christian family here's what this boy should look like and I said are you acting that way and I I we I set about to put in print in place some of these principles here uh that we're talking about here so whatever you can do what everything that's involved in the training and education of children that might be homeschooling everybody's not a homeschooler but that might be homeschooling it might be having devotions every day in your household it might be uh you know uh take you know thinking about vacations and doing that better and whatever it is giving your kids an allowance and helping them set a budget a real simple budget this is for God this is for long-term savings this is for spending and do something real simple uh you know with their money because they're going to learn that that's a life principle they're going to learn whatever is involved in the training that's what the scripture tells us that we should do number two whatever in adults also cultivates the Soul by correcting mistakes and curbing passions hey that's still needs to be taught we as adults there are things that we still are learning and number three instruction anything that increases virtue anything that increases virtue is a good thing think about what what what uh you know of examples of that anything that increases virtue is a good thing is needed in our society so families had to make a decision about what we allow our kids to do what are kids going to participate in so we're going to monitor especially in the early years we're going to monitor their friendships we're going to look at their dress their music their media their choices that they make in relation to that and then their choices and relationships because we want to encourage them to find uh to find a good mate we're going to encourage them to look for character and you know all of those things are are going to be upcoming and so we're going to establish these priorities here and help our kids to learn to make those good decisions part of it is how we do make those decisions ourselves and in Psalm 101 David says I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way and a will will all win will Thou come unto me I will walk within my house of the perfect heart man that's a great goal Lord help me to walk in my house with a perfect heart that's not a Heart full of anger all the time that's not a Heart full of uh you know leave me alone don't bother me that's that's walking within a perfect heart so I'm always looking at my family a certain way and in order to do that in order to walk within your house in a perfect way there are things that you're going to have to learn and adjust and be committed to in order to accomplish that in your house and and in the Hebrew language these words I'm just skipping here because I want to go quickly these are our words here for parent teacher tutor instructor father in the Hebrew language you'll see on the right hand side and you had trust me with this about the Hebrew language many of these words in the Hebrew letters look similar and that's intended in the biblical phraseology that's intended so there's not much difference between a parent and a teacher and a father and a tutor and an instructor and a tutor all of these words are in a sense they're they're constructed or composed with the same thought process from God okay that's the point and if we added another one here father God or Elohim you will find that those letters are almost identical as well I don't have that I didn't have that screen but if you added a fourth one here so our our God is a father we know him as father right we know him as tutor we know him as a guide and those letters in his name are very similar to the letters that are in your job description brother as a parent father teacher tutor instructor so God has placed an attribute of a teacher instructor guide in the heart of a father to help lead that family because if you don't that family is going to stray I was in a country recently where they had a pastor early in the arrival of the message in the early message years and uh lo and behold the people who came to the message in that Nation not a big nation not a lot of people but the people who came into that message community that environment didn't stick around Long kids got to be 17 18 years old and they all drifted off they're all out in the world now and lo and behold without any significant growth in that church they found out that the pastor was committing adultery with somebody in the church and as a result the Holy Spirit couldn't really honor his ministry and his ministry to the people and as a result the people never broke through to a real New Birth and so when the pressures and the influences of the world became too strong they just drifted away you know what the problem was the problem was at the top you say well those are bad kids well you know what those kids might have had a better Fighting Chance and a better atmosphere because brother Graham said the atmosphere brings the birth right so he's destroyed the Atmosphere by his sinful condition and we got to go right to the top in order to correct this he's gone there's another young man who's there and doing a great job he's he's doing a great job and I was there and ministered and man just the Holy Spirit moving in that assembly and I thought wow this this is what this needs because now young people really getting something in these in these services in the meetings and the environment here and families growing up and you see backsliders coming back into it again what's the difference we got a different headship right all right bring it down to scale your family who's God going to deal with first in your household when it comes to Authority and responsibility for what goes on who's he going to deal with first not your kids he's going to deal with the father so God has two ways of getting your attention as a dad number one he's going to deal with your job if God wants to get a man's attention he'll kick the legs out from underneath your job and all of a sudden the man is left floating because hey that's who I am right it's not really but a lot of times we spend a lot of time at work so that really gets a man's attention what do I do now and the second thing that the way that he's going to deal with a man is through his spouse and when something goes wrong with the spouse that man knows it right and he has he prays a little bit differently when there's something wrong with his job or his spouse for a woman God will deal with her a little bit differently one of the things that he'll do is affect the relationship the spouse and when there's problems between husband and wife that wife will pray a little bit differently than she normally does and then also with her children something goes wrong with their children a woman is really affected by that because God puts something in the heart of a mother that is not like anything else I mean men don't have it I don't care what you say men don't have the same feeling towards their kids that women have God put that in there in the heart of a woman I remember our neighbor we have a neighbor next to us and they're not Believers at all but they have one little child and then they had we're having another child she was expecting and this child died at 26 weeks just one day it's fine next day it's dead in her womb they don't know why and it just happened it was devastating obviously for for them and you know uh she had to give birth to the child and they asked me would I do the funeral because they don't have a church and they asked me would I do the funeral and so the coffin is this big right big as a shoebox and so we went to the funeral and graveside we just had a graveside and I was there and uh it was me and two of them and and the funeral home director that's always there and we're just sitting in the middle of this big field and they were they were sitting there so I just pulled up a chair and I I gave him a couple of scriptures you know and we were just I was just talking a little bit about um you know not trying to fret over why this happened you know and all the other parts of it but I said in the Indian tradition in the Lakota tribes I said they have a an understanding they said I I told her this I said now this is not biblical but I said I'm just telling you what their tradition is and I said that in among the Indians they believed that when a woman gives birth or mothers a child into the world the Indians believe that there is actually a little part of that mother in the child so when that child goes through life it carries a certain something of her in life you can never forget that you know you can never separate that that's something that uh the Indians believe that a mother actually imparts something to her child but the child also imparts something in the mother and there's a there's a almost like a deposit that's the way they describe it this is Indian lore and I said that's why when we lose a child it is so devastating for a mother because it's almost like a part of her has died a part of her was in that child and some of your moms are looking at me shaking your heads in the green because there's something if something happens that a child it's like it happened to me and and vice versa there's just some vital connection that God makes between a mother and child that is different than how it is for a man I told the husband I said John you don't feel this and I don't feel this about my children but your wife does feel this and she agreed with that and it's it's a heartbreaking thing because a mother feels it in a different way than what husbands would and it is a uh you know it's a it's a very real thing when it comes to you know heaven heaven that uh connection with with their children for sure now let me just let me just go on number two if if the first thing is correction by the word or spiritual correction the second thing is the verbal and it's actually getting the heart and soul and the mind working in the same direction so all right we know what the word says but are we actually going to do that I told you to go clean up your room well all right we know that's what the word says remember Jesus gives the parable he says there were two sons and one of them the father said would you go and uh you know clean on just paraphrasing go and do an errand for me and the son says no I'm not going to do that but he goes and does it anyway after a while he goes and does it anyway and he says to this other son you go and do this Aaron for me and he says sure I'll do that Dad and never does because their heart and mind is not are not working in sync until they come in sync and so the son who was told what to do actually did it now we've got them kind of lined up okay so it's the actual getting the heart and the soul in the mind working in the in the same direction so brother random says Lord tender our hearts so that we'll know how to behave ourselves and act correcting ourselves and bringing the members of our body into discipline to the word so it's one thing to hear the word and you can be hearing the right thing but not doing the right thing so you want to pray and this is what brother Ram is praying here that we will correct ourselves and bring our bodies into discipline of the word that we might know how to live in a way that pleases God does that make sense so that's what we're that's what we're to do and that's what we're to do with our children so this is not new in Deuteronomy chapter 6 hero Israel the Lord your God is one Lord now watch what he says I use this passage a lot interestingly enough Jesus quoted out of Deuteronomy more than any other book in his Earthly Ministry in his teaching Deuteronomy is a great book there's lots of lessons in here and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart this is instructions going into the into the kingdom going into the promised land thou shall love the Lord with thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these worship words without command thee this day shall be in your children's heart no vinehart so it's got to be in your heart before you teach it to anybody it's got to be in your heart before you show anybody else okay you understand what he's saying you're the father you're the leader here but it's got to be in your heart first and then you can influence your children then he says in seven and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children oh yeah what does diligently mean it means this we're going to sharpen the word diligent is the Hebrew word for sharpen you know how you sharpen the knife you know how you're sharpen something you do this you rub it takes a little while you're gonna rub it get yourself an edge You're Gonna Keep rubbing it until it gets nice and sharp then you're going to use it and guess what don't then guess what after a while it gets dull you know what we're going to do then we're gonna take it back and sharpen it again that's what that's what Moses is telling the people there now she'll teach them diligently unto thy children so we're going to teach our children the principles and you know what they're going to grow a little they're going to feel like now we know everything we're going to take it back we're going to we're going to whittle away a little bit more right then they become teenagers then they know everything all right raising teenagers is kind of like trying to nail Jello to a tree it's really hard but he says you've got to have this in your heart first and then you're going to teach your children over time and we're not going to do it just once we're going to do it over and over again we're going to teach them when we go in the nine house Thou shalt talk to them when I sit us in nine house and when I walk Us by the way and when they'll lie is down when they Rises up there's two words in the Hebrew for talking for speech and they're like this one is the formal way that God spoke to prophets and Prophets spoke the say of the Lord thou shall repent Israel or perish right that's the way Prophet spoke and that's the way God speaks to Prophets this other kind of speaking here is not that the other kind is casual conversational everyday talk that you would have with your family so you don't say and I do this for fun to my grandchildren all the time but I didn't say to my boys Thou shalt thus saith the Lord Thou shalt come before me right now kneel and repent lest thou be smitten from the Earth you don't go into the Butcher and say thou shalt produce six pork chops for me lest thou die right we don't talk that way I mean you shouldn't this is not that this is Thou shalt talk of them you know what everyday conversation round the table this is like hey you know what we include God in everything we do our conversation is christ-centered but it's not it's not condemnation it's not formal it's just hey this is Who We Are this is what we are we're Christians so you know what you got a test coming up we'll pray we got a financial problem let's pray we dad is in the in threatened to lose his job you know all these Chinese people walking around the plant all of a sudden let's pray how do Christians handle Financial stress how do Christians handle a job layoff how do Christians and we just bought a van and how do Christians communicate with one with another so he's he's not saying that you need to have this distance from your children you've got to be where they are you want you want to talk to them right where they are and you want to communicate with them in that way now I love this statement here this kind of became the basis for men's meetings but look here brother man was talking about Elijah and Elisha and the transition between Elijah and Elijah Elijah the prophet who had the mantle of God came and laid it across Elisha the farmer to see if it would fit him you know why Elijah Elijah picked Elisha anybody know what quality did Elisha have that Elijah saw in him he was a farmer brother Branham said Elijah Elisha knew how to plow in a straight line and that's what Elijah saw and he said if he could plow in a straight line it means he could handle the word straight he could preach it straight that's what he said so he goes and he throws this mantle over Elisha and brother man said it took him about 10 years to get altered to fit the mantle now God usually puts us in the shop and trims us up but he didn't alter the robe to fit Elisha he altered Elisha to fit the robe and that's what he does today he Alters us to fit the robe not the robe to fit us wow sometimes we want to make the robe fit us but we can't do that sometimes your kids want to get married they're like I'm 16 been a bridesmaid not married yet hello dad let me go with this guy right unless you live in Arkansas or West Virginia hey it doesn't matter you can be older and we want to make the rope in other words we want to do things faster than what we're ready for but God's actually shaping you to fit a responsibility a job a commission that he's got for you if you're meant to be a father you'll be a father but you've got to let God deal with you until then right and and this is this is that this principle is applied in lots of different ways but he says you've got to be altered yourself for that robe it's God's robe and he made it perfect and he's going to bring us into that realm to make the robe fit us wow so God's actually shaping you as a parent even and as a Christian to fit the role that he has for you and your job is to help fit shape those children because there's a role for them to play later right so when we talk about my boys you know when you're looking at the bent you're looking at the the gifts and talents that God's put in there uh you know it's one thing for me as a parent to see that bent in my child but you want them to see that the trouble is God's put it in them and they look at it as very normal that's the way I am that's who I am but you know what they got to recognize ah this is what God's called me this is probably what God's put in me and this is how I can serve the body this is how I can be effective in the Kingdom this is how I can I can do this for the rest of my life you know and they need to kind of recognize that that's God shaping them for the role that they have and as a parent you don't want to be doing the opposite and say my goodness you're a loser you'll never amount to anything yeah that listen you should just quit now or why don't you why don't you just you know go uh wash dishes at Wendy's or something because you'll never amount to anything or you're let me tell you the way that you dress and conduct yourself you'll never find a good man you'll never you'll never amount to anything you'll never be a mother like your mother was and yeah you're shaping somebody today our problem brother random said is that what we believe to be juvenile delinquency is really parentalinquency and our people got away from the things that they should have stayed with and you got Hollywood put down lots of movies and television uncensored and we've come a long way from that but you understand that there's there's pressures there's somebody trying to shape your child's mind and thinking even if you're not so you got to be Uber conscious of the fact that no influence in your child's life is actually an influence you understand what I'm saying there is no such thing as no influence in your child's life because the moment you you abnegate from that responsibility the moment you step back from that responsibility and say well you know what we go to a good church Bruce Sam's our pastor and you know we have good Sunday school and everything else so uh as a parent I can kind of zone out and I can go fishing and I don't really need to worry about that and let my let my wife raise him let uh the pastor raise them let the Sunday School teachers raise them and so forth and they have good buddies and all the rest of it the moment you abnegate that responsibility you exempt yourself from that responsibility somebody's right there to influence them in the wrong way and all kids need a father and a mother to work together to help raise those kids in the best way they possibly can and you know what the irony is you can be doing really smart good things but you have no guarantee how your goods are going to come out you can be doing all the right things and your kids will come out Squirrely and you can make all kinds of mistakes and have your kids come out right figure that out you you know what you know what you need to do you need to just throw yourself at the mercies of God if you're a parent here today and you're bringing up kids today I think about my grandkids today you know I got six of them and they're coming up they're all young and they're coming up and I think my Lord Jesus I pray that uh you know God will put influences in their life that will help them in the way that my kids had influences in their lives and and and you know help them shape them move them in a certain direction give them a love for for God and I will tell you this even if you're a lousy parent and you're not you're not good at praying out loud and all the other things there if you teach your children to have respect for the Bible that will go a long way if you don't do anything else teach them to have respect for the Bible because that's something that they will come back to that's something that they'll never forget the third thing that we want to talk about in relation to discipline is this whole idea of behavior and it's a discipline of the will so now we're kind of getting down here to the ground level and this kind of discipline behavioral discipline is focused on consequence oriented discipline if you do this and you can have this and this is this is in the sense it's a Biblical thing that Samson if he didn't give away his secret then he would have strength but the converse is also true and you say well that's Old Testament in Galatians 6 be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap I have a a friend of mine who is a good brother he's a song leader in the church a really good brother sincere served the Lord a lot of years but in his worldly days he was out and went with a girl and contracted a sexual disease the disease is incurable and he's not married and he's at you know middle age and he's not married he's repented of that sin a long time ago but you know what you reap what your soul and a lot of kids will think well you know when I'm in Christ everything is gone everything's forgiven hey this I I'll tell you as a as an individual some of you have seen my testimony I have a lot of memories and a lot of scars of things that happened to me because I wasn't raised in a message environment I wasn't raised in a message home and did things out there that I wish I had never done and you reap what you sow and so when it comes to the Natural side of life it's really a good thing for you to teach your children that in terms of behavior you're going to reap what you sow if you step have money and you blow all your money on bubble gum and um what are they deadheads what do they call them Airheads I said you are nothing but what you're feeding on and there's going to come a time when you're going to wish you had a few of those bucks instead of a you know cavities and air your airhead and you're in other words you're gonna reap what your soul you teach kids that principle on a small scale and they realize okay you know what I gotta think I gotta think about this in our home and I'll let you in how we did it in our home we had three ways you could get spanked these are the three ways we made sure our children understood this very clearly here's the three if you tell a lie you're eligible for spanking there ain't no discussion you're going to get spanked when you tell a lie you know why because God loves the truth and we're supposed to put away lying and I'm going to help you remember so when you lie to Mom or you lie to somebody you know what you're in trouble that's number one that was a guaranteed path to spanking the second one was the destruction of property if you take your brother's toys and you break them up and he didn't give you permission to break them up duh then you're gonna have a consequence for that because you know what in real life if you steal somebody's car and Smash It Up there's a consequence for that yeah and there are things that you need to know about things that are not yours and you have to learn to ask permission you have to learn to get a you know a right to do something everything in the world is not yours in a way I'm glad my boys have moved out in one small way because now I have my own wardrobe but still complete my boys would come in hey socks yeah Dad got new socks guys hey and I I come in every one of them walk out with a pair and like hello and you're laughing listen I I bought a speaker yeah I bought a speaker from my desk a little bold speaker I could put on my desk you know what I did I bought five and I put them on the desk one at a time how many are there now one and it's not like hey thanks Dad it's like hey that it's in our house you're laughing I don't know why you're laughing the other thing is disrespect so telling lies destruction of property and disrespect are three sure paths to spanking in our house and that includes rolling the eyes because that's a sure sign somebody disrespect you right all right guys we're going to have a family meeting and we want you to we want to talk about cleaning your room here we go again or you know some someone of the boys wants to you know do something with a girl or you know we're gonna do a sleepover we just we never did sleepovers in our house I'm not telling you what to do not at all I'm not here to do that but I'm just telling you we never did that in our house had sleepovers and uh you know if if the boys came to us in debt how come we can't do that how come we can and I'd say well that's just I've always been our house ruled you know we've seen we've I and I've we've personally seen some examples there it was not good and we don't have any control really when they have a lockdown and they got you know you have no adult supervision or very little and so we're not going to do that everyone else does I'm in Christian company here I better not the Bible says children obey your parents in the Lord in all things so there's a consequence for disrespect and I mean you know when your boss comes to you on the job and he says hey guys it's time for inventory oh goodness see I hate inventory go away will ya yeah how's that going to go so we've we find not only with the boys but we find this with the girls as well that that God puts in place teachers in your lives to help teach young women things that they're going to need to know because they're going to need to know them and so Paul says speak to other things which become sound Doctrine the age of men be sober and so forth and three the aged women likewise that they being Behavior has become a Holiness not false users and so forth that the pastor May teach the young women to be it's not what it says that the fathers May teach the Young no it's the aged women who are supposed to teach young women to be sober love their husbands love their children be discreet shaper Chase keepers at home and so forth and in all things look if if Mom mom has her black belt in Facebook and she's on it you know 75 percent of the day you're teaching your daughter something hello I'm just saying I'm just saying what it says here and there are things that you you do show by example and and they're just they're just really important and you can fall back on scripture all the time because uh it's scripture scripture is given by God for as by inspiration it's breathed by God and it is profitable for this idea of reproof and Recreation correction and chastisement as we already Define and correction here in instruction and righteousness so that the man of God may be perfect so we have a scriptural boundary here that we want to stay Within and these are not my rules these are these are God's instructions to us and so we want to be mindful of that because we're just trying to keep the Holy Spirit welcome here in our household I I was I was somewhere recently and I could tell you this lots of stories like this but I was somewhere recently oh um there was some some event like a um public thing like uh almost like the county fair or something it wasn't a county fair but you know something like that where lots and lots of people are around and this mother and father were there in the head of little guys probably three right and I was I happened to be standing right in front of this family and the mother was saying um Johnny come over here and and stay with your mother and father come over here he doesn't listen right two or three times Johnny come over here and finally she raises her voice to a place where he he he huh can I help you yes that's the way he was come over here be with your mother and father and then he just kind of goes like this that makes us step back she said come over here be with your father now I'm standing right here right I'm um I wish I I would have took out my phone and recorded it because I knew where this was going and he's he's just making steps back he's just looking at her you know what now that's what two-year-old kids do that's what they're wired for right I mean they don't know anything else right so they're they're doing this and I I'm I'm all ready to you know stand back ma'am I got this I've raised four of these Rascals you know just look the other way ma'am I'm ready to just let them have it right because hey I've been there done that right I know how this works and I know where this is going but you know what and the father he kind of you know he's he's just going off like this and she's doing it again Johnny come over here and he's doing the same he's just looking at her he's not like he's he's not hearing her he's looking at her and doing this and you know what she does she just kind of looks at me because I'm right here right and she's looking at me she just goes and just walks off like that and lets the kid go his own Direction I thought the kid you look the other way I'm going to take the mother and just [Applause] this kid's about three and he is controlling this situation my blood pressure goes up 15 points as I'm thinking my goodness huh my heart so the last thing is the physical if number three is working on the will this is for the wound do you get that sister charity all right we're good we can go on he that spareth his Rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasing him be times spear means to avoid the duty Hey listen what is Pleasant about discipline what is Pleasant about disciplining your children nothing and have you ever tried to tell your kids this hurts me more than it hurts you one time one of my boys said well Dad be easy on yourself don't don't do that I had another another one of my boys whenever you get in trouble whenever he got in trouble and he knew it was coming he had this way of quivering [Laughter] it was the hardest thing to do not to laugh I say stay right there and I go in the other room and I'd be laughing away I come all right now he he got out of more lickens by quivering withhold not thy Cur with whole not correction from the child it doesn't work to change this verse it just doesn't work we we look at this word rod and you got to win interpret it right in the Hebrew it means it's it's a staff the Brand's the club it it is the Implement of a shepherd and a Shepherd kept things moving in the right way he guided with that Rod he he kept things under control with that Rod you can keep things under control without being a controller is that all right if you're a controller we got to have a different conversation but a Shepherd did that with his Rod his Rod was whenever his Shepherd showed up with his Shepherd staff the Sheep didn't go hey whoa whoa whoa whoa hey relax buddy relax with that thing didn't David said that Rob and thy staff they comfort me you know I got somebody looking out for me I got somebody looking after me and this is what that actually means so you're you're you're not withholding the correction but you're doing in a way that your child is not rearing back from you you know when you go to your child and and uh all the you know all of a sudden you see them and you put your hand out they're not like whoa hey hey relax there buddy hmm so we establish boundaries and this is biblical this is important the Lord's instructions for parents is that they teach a child boundaries chasing thy son while there's hope less not thy Soul spare for his crying and let not thy Soul spare for his crime because when children learn that they're going to use it every time matter of fact they're going to use whatever works to get out of a spanking and boundaries help a child see that life is not about pursuing what he wants but surrendering to the Lord and following him boundaries are set with conditional love will teach children boundaries that are set with unconditional love will teach children to surrender to the Lord because they trust that God knows what is best and will bring through contentment let me ask you this in your Christian experience if the Lord if the holy spirit's ever corrected you have you wound up hating him because he did no consistently whenever the Lord corrects us we love him more we say thank you Lord I never knew that Lord forgive me for doing that wrong and that I mean when it's done right that's the response right that's the reaction so you have to craft this discipline in a way that your children don't hate you and they're looking at you saying wait till I go to school and tell the counselor I can tell you stories and and this is this is biblical hast thou not made a hedge around about him that that Satan had asked God about his house and about all that he has on every side uh my people are destroyed Hosea chapter 4 for lack of knowledge and that is discernment and understanding my people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee thou shall be no priest to me saying thou has forgotten the law of thy God and I will also forget thy children and so therefore the the imparting and the uh given given the child the the knowledge and the uh the knowledge of where those boundaries are is really important the rod and reproof give wisdom but a Child Left to himself bringeth his mother to shame the rod physical discipline and reproof his correction give wisdom so notice it's not all spanking and it's not all lecturing you need both but you need both you get me you understand what I'm saying you can't just do the physical part without explaining why this is happening and you're you're saying hey this is this is not my rule this is you you lied you told a lie and you know what this is how God feels about lying and and uh you know you you just you just can't do you can't do that in life and and there's a consequence for certain things and so therefore we're going to we're going to help that child understand the reproof side but the rod is is something that is going to help them remember and so you can't take one away one away and expect to have balanced discipline here because a Child Left to himself brings his mother to shame now in your book here on page 21 just so you got the reference here I put this in because this is seven Jewish parenting principles inspired by experience and in the Jewish culture based on scripture these are seven things that are uh that are sensible and that's the reason I put them in it's not all they'll say the Lord here but like number three talks about respect and if you look at the paragraph it says if your children exhibit should Spa sometimes which is rebellion then you're in good company children are not naturally inclined to treat their parents with respect and hence the fifth commandment thou shall honor thy father and thy mother my father-in-law is 96 years old and we still we still are my wife and I we we believe in this fifth commandment honor your father and your mother and that's not just for little kids looking at their parents that's a lifelong principle recently my wife answered asked me a question she said what would happen to my father if I died what would you do I told her I said I'm committed to you whether you're alive or dead and I said therefore I would treat him no differently whether you're here or not because he is your father and I'm still under the fifth commandment whether you're here or not I wish my boys were here to hear that because we want to have a Seaside old folks home in Ireland and retire there but anyway go to number six that's what I was going to say number six be a mentor we are our children's teachers of right and wrong based on the Divine blueprint for mankind set for mankind in the Torah the first five books of the Bible let me read it again we as parents are our children's teachers of right and wrong based on the Divine blueprint set for us in the Bible perhaps this is best seen in the connection between the Hebrew words parent and teacher Moray an instructor horah these are the words I put up on the screen here and how we want them to live we must first model well that's consistent with what we've been talking about right so if you read down through the rest of that number six there don't do it the rabbis very often told parents to teach their children to swim huh because swimming is teaching a child to survive in an environment they're not comfortable in this is not my natural environment so we're going to teach them to swim and they're going to be thrown into this environment that they're not comfortable in and survive parenting is the act of putting your child in environments that's not natural in other words it's not your home so that they can survive and interact with the world around them that's the idea so I've seen homeschooled families who where they mothers and fathers are so protective and they so isolate their kids that when their kids get out they're like I'm going to be eaten alive by something out here everything is evil everything is going to hell and they don't know how to interact they don't do well in relationships they don't do well in work they don't do well in anything outside the house because we're outside of our comfort zone throw them in the pond that's what the rabbi said put them in an environment that then now they have to learn to cope in an area that's not comfortable not normal and learn to survive in that atmosphere and that's a that's the principle behind how Jewish people would uh react to training their children so in other words you know when I talked about the Boy Scouts the pre-gay Boy Scouts because my boys are have no connection with scouting anymore they don't Trail life is is an option that you can do today but they have no connection with Boy Scouts and but it was an environment where now they had to get along with these other kids and they had to build a tent together they had to build a fire together they had to chop down the tree together they had to kill a bear you know or whatever they had to do whatever and and they had they had to do that but we didn't just throw them into the lake and not teach them how to swim we I was there with them helping them coaching them along you know and we chose this troop this group this group because we knew the leader and we you know we we thought we did anyway and we we were you know side by side with them there but we're in a sense we're teaching them to swim in agricultural terms it's called hardening off right so when you go to a if you raise a plant from a Seedling and it starts to sprout you don't take it out and put it outside right away and leave it outside you harden It Off right hardening it off means we're going to take it out for an hour a day and put it back inside and then next day we're going to put it out for a couple of hours and bring it back inside next week we're going to put it out for all day and we're going to bring it back inside and then eventually we're going to leave it overnight outside we're going to harden it off we're going to acclimatize that child to the environment or we're going to harden off that plant to the environment it's going into so while your kids are little you're obviously going to keep him inside you're going to expose them very little but over time we're going to experience them a little expose them a little bit more are we okay sometimes your kids get good exposure by going to Sunday school in church talk about hardening off maybe I shouldn't have said that did I just say that and what you're doing is you're helping them to cope in an environment that's not normal it's not theirs and this is the when you read that and number six there that's what the rabbis actually told parents to do to put your kids in an environment where it's not normal and natural and let them uh you know adjust learn to adjust and cope and survive in that environment if it's all Rod they become submissive but unemotional your kids will become submissive yeah I'll do whatever it needs to take in order to not get the spanking and I'll say I'm sorry say your tell your brother you're sorry I'm sorry thank you for really meaning that but if it's all reproof it's all they can become defiant of authority and you know what they're they're just going to lie their way through whatever they need to lie through to avoid the punishment and if we don't have both this scripture applies if iron be blunt and he do not wet the edge then must he put to more strength if you're chopping wood with an ax and the ax becomes blunt the only way you're ever going to chop that wood is to hit it harder if iron be blunt and you do not wet or sharpen the edge wet is sharp in the edge then he must have to put more strength do you understand what he's saying the only thing you do is hit it harder but wisdom is profitable to direct means to succeed wisdom is profitable in order to succeed and to be right or give success to be right and proper so you understand what Solomon is actually saying it's great verse if iron be blunt if your kids are rebellious and you're spanking them and you know what there's no amendment of behavior at all you're only gonna I mean unless you figure out a way to do this you're gonna have to just hit him harder hit him more often and you know what that's going to accomplish nothing but wisdom will help you have success in the discipline of your children does that make sense so it's not all rod and it's not all lectures it's not all Bible studies but we're going to kind of do both because that will give us the advantage to instill wisdom in our children it's not easy brother man said when you go out here and say well I'll mingle around a little bit in the world he said God gives you a whip and God will give you a real old-fashioned spanking for you for it and I'll tell you that if you had more of it in the natural today we'd have better children God wants his household straightened out these days you know you can say to your kids Hey listen you could lose that privilege and you can you can you know make you come back down the ladder unless that you're you're willing to uh unless you're willing to comply here and uh to listen to what we're actually saying now if you don't mind let me uh there's a there's a lot here that we could we could actually say but uh if can I have a few more ah it's 2 30. just getting wound up no no no no no no we need coffee more coffee the ee kind am I am I help I mean is this making sense at all and where are we we don't really mean that no uh we can talk about fathers here we can talk about it and and uh how many of you here are empty nesters huh bless your hearts yes and no now Sister listen we need to Define empty nesters okay okay let's take just a little short break five minutes okay we'll come back thank you we know that he's a he's a father and uh God wants us to be mindful of this part of our Lives I just want to say this uh some of the questions and comments have been really great and I wish I had time actually to deal with them a little bit more uh do you spank for Tantrums that's a question do you spank toddlers for Tantrums I'm not here to tell you how that you should discipline your children you know like physically you can talk to your pastor about that um I I know this that um how you physically handle your child matters and there are some children you'd never need to physically handle your child you might have a daughter and you look at her sideways and she knows you're not happy that's all you need to do I never had daughters but um you know I I'm not I'm not here and I'm purposely not going to tell you what what weapon you should employ to because some people they don't understand discipline unless it means some object that they use to inflict pain on their kids and I uh I've seen too much of that go go go wrong a lot of times you know you can you can employ a time out uh in in the world if you rob a store the judge is going to sentence you to time out right and timeout is not a bad thing especially if the family is doing something else if you've got to go to bed early and everybody else is up in the in the in the living room having a good time timeout hurts and uh when our intent is not to hurt our children it's the it's the rod and staff principle and so we're going to teach them are going to uh use that rod in a right way what forms of discipline would you use for disrespect once a child is too old to spank and you had to be really careful that you know where that line is about spanking your kids but uh if your child has a phone that's a great disciplinary tool if your child drives that's a great disciplinary Tool uh there there are things that they might not be welcome to participate in with the family uh they might not be able to go out with their friends after church on Sunday uh go to a restaurant with the other young people or whatever you you had to think about this and you had to think about what works but I will tell you this in all of the forms of discipline and all the discussion of discipline you have to be consistent consistency is the key and I know when I cross the line this is going to happen and you know what I better watch it because Mom and Dad are going to be there and don't don't let your kids play off mom against dad you know and go to Dad and Dad says you're going to get it when we get home you're going to get it and then you go to the kids go to Mom and say that that has been mean to me he hates me he hates me oh he doesn't hate you we love you we love you and I won't let him I won't let him say yeah a little rascal you tell me what school the kids went to to learn that that's intuitive they know how to do that so don't do that and if there's a discussion there you know I mean if there's some sort of a disagreement mother and father should get aside without the kid in front of him and say did you tell him this or did you say this and let's agree on what we're going to do here because that behavior is unacceptable that violates one of our family principles here and you know what we're gonna we're gonna put a stop to that but decide that between you and then come back and whoop the Daylights out of them if you need to no I'm only kidding I'm only kidding now here's a question that I think is is really important is competition healthy um like message Sports huh um playing on Sunday I I'm I guess I'm over 30. you know I'm old school when it comes to playing on Sunday and I I'm I'm pretty conservative about what we do on Sundays uh so I I don't I don't go that way but you know that's you you again your family you have to uh you know determine what's what's right but I don't think that Sunday uh extends only to the end of the service Sunday doesn't go to the last song is over it's a it's a day we set aside from the normal business and Affairs of life is competition healthy yes absolutely yes I was listening to a story the other day about a fellow who was um young fella and the coach had told him the phys ed teacher had told him hey next week a week from today we're going to have a race we're going to run a race and we're going to give away Awards and um you know it's going to be for everybody in the class 36 uh something like fourth graders so this boy was I mean he was training he was running and practicing and preparing for the race and the day came finally coach lined him up Ready Set goal and they all ran in the race and he came in second tried his hardest and came in second and at the end of the race the coach came along and had 36 first place ribbons and gave him out to all the kids and he went home and he said I don't want to go to that school anymore he said the coach lied to us and he said we he said I trained and you know trained for that race and he said and there was one kid they had to do four laps around the track for the race and he said one kid who did one lap walking and then quit and he got a first place ribbon and that boy had problems with that after that experience for a long time now I'll tell you what I this this whole idea of you know women uh men becoming women and getting into sports and all of this stuff without you know no no one fails because we don't hurt anybody's self-esteem and all of that Hey listen you know what I'd preach that too if I could find it in the Bible and it ain't in there that's baloney that's Holiness around that's baloney and it's it's not true it's not a healthy thing so uh I'm I guess I'm old school on that sorry all right let's talk a little bit about fathers okay is that all right so sisters don't tune out here because you've got to be the elbow that elbows your husband and say wake up stupid this is for you July 13 2009 this was in Time Magazine we need fathers to step up to realize that their job does not end that conception that's what that's what makes you a man is not that what makes you a man is not the ability to have a child but the courage to raise one and everybody said this is so funny because you don't know who said this he went on to say on every in the same speech on every single significant outcome related to short-term and well-term long-term success short-term well-being and long-term success children from intact to parent families outperform those from single parent households longevity drug abuse school performance and Dropout rates teen pregnancy criminal behavior and incarceration and in all cases the kids living with both parents drastically outperform the others but here's the reality the top line is the percentage of families that are one parent families more than any other Nation on Earth we have more money more facility we have more education we have more benefits of any other Nation on Earth practically and yet we are raising more children in one parent families than any other place on Earth for decades the share of U.S children living with a single parent has been rising accompanied with a decline in marriage rates and rise in births outside a marriage children young people now are getting married later in life the average age for girls is 25.8 years and the average age for boys is 27.2 years that means that they are not trusting marriage they're waiting longer you know why because they're probably working with somebody who's paying alimony payments because of divorce and they're looking at that saying I don't want to do that so I'm going to live together with somebody before we have uh marriage here because uh that seems safer and I don't have to pay alimony if it doesn't work we're going to split it seems to be more logical they're looking at it from a non-biblical logical point of view okay let me tell you something you need to teach your kids this intimacy never precedes commitment in the eyes of God commitment precedes intimacy how many of you have ever been to a youth retreat when are youth retreat and you're all you're all married right I mean that's what it's for eign did I just say that should I not have said that we teach this all the time to the kids because it's really important you get this to your children intimacy never precedes your commitment to that person but a commitment comes first I remember one time I was talking about getting married to my wife I was sitting in the kitchen with my sister and two brothers two brothers are serving the lord my sister is not and she uh I was talking about you know the wedding and going away it was just a day or two before I left to go get married and she was sitting there eating something and and I said you know at the altar I said that would be the first time that I kissed my wife and I just kind of went out she goes she spit out all the food she said run that by me again I said that'll be the first time I kiss her is at the altar she said really I said yeah she said what if you don't like the way she kisses I said you know I said you either believe this message or you don't one or the other but especially on this issue there's no halfway and I said that's what the message teaches the Oddball 1964 many other places brother Brandon said the first gift should be when you lift the veil and whenever I marry somebody in my church and I'm already married when I perform the marriage ceremony of somebody in my church and we're now polygamous all right uh but when Sam just got that so I I always ask them before I do the wedding I always ask them is this the first kiss at the altar because I want to know and I said to my sister I said we've never kissed and she said she just couldn't get over that and I said you know that's what that's what brother Bram taught that's what the message teaches and uh you know what I said I believe I believe that God will take care of that and he did brother Branham he he talks very clearly about that that incident when he was going down a hotel room now I had somebody who got this story directly from Brother Branham and brother Brandon when he tells it publicly like in this here where and this is the story where he's going down the hallway in the hotel and people are you know drunk and naked and they're falling around on the floor and she says whoopee this is life you know when brother ran told a story in private he told it much more graphically it was pretty bad it was pretty bad and he was disgusted at this because they were so Twisted away from what was morally acceptable even in that day and he said but that's what breaks up homes and that's what spoils children that's what makes neurotics and teenage delinquency is when mother motherhood and fatherhood motherhood and fatherhood are broke and let me tell you it you you are the people who are uh to me are called to uh fix that which is capable of being broken if it's broken and to be able to make sure that it's done right your attitude toward Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your attitude towards Christ will make a great impression on what your children will be your life you live before your family guess who he's talking to here he's not talking to kids right your life you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be wow if you say well I thought that was all up to the Holy Spirit Well uh now you got your money's worth because the Bible said he'd visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children to the third and fourth generation there was a a brother one time who lived in California and was one of the members of the board of the Full Gospel businessman's Association brother Branham went and visited the vineyard because many of them were wine vineyard owners you know many these guys out of California and because that's where demishekarian lived and so forth and this one brother uh had brother random come and visit the the vineyard and showed brother Branham all these places and he said the Lord has really blessed me he said look at all of this that's done and he was he was not bragging or anything it wasn't a bad thing and brother random looked at all of it and when he came to the end of the tour and was leaving he shook his hand he said brother he said this is all really wonderful but he said the reason you have all of this is because of what your father did to serve the Lord you are blessed because of what your father did so I say it like this when my boys leave my house I want their let's say this way I want my ceiling to be their platform as high as I go and as high as I bring them I want them to be able to start right there and go forward not have to go relearn Christianity again and come all the way down here I want to live a life in such a way that when they leave they can just they've come this high with me they can just go right on you get you understand the principle that I don't want them to have to spend time going back to say well what does the message teach about this or that you know and now they have to have their own experience but I want them to be able to continue to raise their children live their life be married in such a way that they take off from where I left them my ceiling becomes their platform that's what's important because the Bible said he'd visit the iniquity of the parents on the children all right let's apply that you ready let's apply that here we go I'll tell you a story once upon a time there was a family of wayward church members who had once been active but lost all interest and had fallen away from church there was a father and three sons Jim John and Sam the elders had talked to them about their lost condition and the preacher visited and many Brethren talked to them about their lost condition and tried to get them to come back to church but all this did not seem to do the least bit of good until one day all the boys were out in the pasture and a large rattlesnake bit John and he became ill the doctor was called and after examination he pronounced John to be in a very critical condition and he said about all we can do now is pray the father called the preacher and told him of John's condition and he asked the preacher to pray for John's recovery and this was his prayer o wise and righteous father we thank thee for thou and thy wisdom has sent this rattlesnake to bite John in order to bring him to his senses he has not been inside the church for years and it is doubtful that he is in all that time felt the need for prayer now we trust that he that this will prove a valuable lesson to him and that it will lead to genuine repentance and now father wilt thou send another snake to bite Sam and another one to buy Jim and another big one to bite the old man we have all been doing everything we know for years to restore them but to no avail it seems therefore that all our combined efforts could not do what this snake has done we thus conclude that the only thing left that will do this family any good is rattlesnakes send us bigger and better rattlesnakes in the name of Jesus we pray you weren't expecting that story Jesus takes a lot of time in talking about the father because he's in this role of son and suffering savior and refers to his father many times but he assures us that this is a father who's focused on one thing and that's what's best for you so if you ask him one thing he's not going to give you something else if you ask him for an egg will he offer a scorpion If he if if he then being evil know how to good gifts give good gifts unto your children and that's not an evil thing but you're not God how much more shall your heavenly father give the spirit to them that ask him so there are there are attributes here about father God that he wants to see in us and he develops in US so this is this is pretty good a traditional role of a Hebrew father in the Old Testament and this you think about Joseph you know who was uh the surrogate father for Jesus here he had to give their son they had to give their son three basic things spiritual instruction the Shema hero Israel the Lord is one that was the first thing that the Hebrew uh fathers and Sunday school teachers taught their children is it's called the Shema and that was the first thing and a knowledge and a respect for the Torah the law and give his son an occupation to teach him how to work to teach him how to be responsible and then thirdly to be an ambassador into marriage to show his sons and daughters what a good marriage could be like that was the responsibility of Hebrew fathers it's really not that different for us I mean we can summarize a lot of what I've said today in those three principles let's apply it now specifically a prudent man says Solomon foreseeth the evil and hideth himself but the simple passed on and are punished that's a really really great proverb how many of you have come to a better appreciation of the Proverbs today some of you have I can take the muted Applause I mean wow I thought these were Believers saying a prudent man this is a verse written about Farmers this is a farming verse and it means that a prudent man is one who sees afar off okay see the definition on the bottom he's shrewd and he sees something far off not here yet but he sees it far off in other words a farmer when he harvests his crop at in the fall he can sell everything and make a huge profit he can buy himself a new Ford F-150 truck with the uh you know the extended by golly mirrors out there that flash when you turn on the blinker and you know and ride down he he can spend all of his money he can sell everything but you know what a prudent man sees that the spring is coming so I know I'm going to have the plant in the spring so he's going to withhold a portion of his seed so he can invest the seed in the ground without death this is what Solomon is writing you can sell it all yeah but a prudent man foresees the evil planting season is the evil you know what it's not here yet we're in the Harvest but I know Spring's coming so I'm Gonna Save a little for this spring planting because then I can plant without debt and if the crop fails I haven't lost anything does that make sense that's Prudence in the Bible so I see it a far off not here yet but it's coming how many of you have daughters let's see in your hands again the evil is coming you know what it is you know what it is the wedding it ain't here yet but you know what I see it down the road if I don't kill that guy before we get to the wedding it's down the road you'd be smart to lay aside a little for that even though it's not here how many of you have kids in college or had kids in college it helps to put aside a little bit even if they're if they're still at home in school grade school because the evil is coming you understand this is what Solomon is telling us that a fool the simple pass on and pay the price for that they're punished by having to pay the price because they did not prepare for what was inevitable so when you think about fathers now when you think about looking at the big picture I had four boys and we wanted them to have some sort of post-secondary Education whether it was a skill you know how to how to fix a car or whether it's to build a bridge didn't matter but we wanted them to have something outside of high school because you're going to need that so we foresaw that and put away funds for that particular time what we did was believe it or not I'm that old that I can say that sister Becky's grandfather uh a lot of 25 of his income for all the preachers in the family tree it's a bunch too many but he a lot of 25 and we got a check from him every month for 25 dollars because we were in Ministry full-time Ministry and we decided to take that 25 and just lay it aside because we knew one day that uh boys would need to go to school they'd need to go to college of some sort and by God's grace we were able to put them all through college one of them had a bit of debt because he was uh you know in school a little bit longer and so forth but for the most part all of them have multiple degrees and we did it by by just putting that away and leaving that because we knew the day would come and I didn't have enough income to really set aside any uh kind of uh deduction at that particular point so we just accumulated that money for that and by God's race we were able to accomplish something later on and so therefore uh you know a prudent man and that's what a father should be we should be looking at this not for the now but we should be thinking about things uh a little bit up the road and a wise son hears his father instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke and so forth and all of these principles here uh apply he that begeteth a fool doeth it in his to his sorrow and the father of a fool hath no joy so there there's a a lot of there's a lot of warning in the sense in scripture about uh making sure that you instill that wisdom pass along that Insight uh to your kids as they grow I remember Brother Band said when I was a little boy I always like horses and I said I'll tell you you won't go wrong as long as you love nature because God's in nature and I was thinking about that when I was a little lad that's what I liked my father was a writer he's a good writer what a sh he said what a shot with a revolver he'd make those big Stone Marbles and he'd roll them out like that have two guns shoot one knock the marble in the air and burst the marble before it hit the ground with the other gun now he said I couldn't hit a wash tub like that he said it didn't laying still but I still like the outdoors and I used to want to be like my daddy I just love my daddy I remember his daddy wasn't exactly an upright man I mean but you know what that's how strong that relationship is without trying that's a boy just looking up to his father and a girl looking up to his father and he said he wasn't a Christian until a little bit before he died and I led him to Christ he was Irish through and through and a real Drinker and no matter what he did I didn't care what he did he's my daddy anyhow brother Branham one time took Billy Paul up in Chicago and went to the Bowery the Bowery was where the drunks hung out and he walked down the Bowery and he looked at these guys laying on the ground and he said Billy he said here except for the grace of God I would be here too if it wasn't for the grace of God and brother Branham knew he was an acoa that's an adult child of an alcoholic that's a real thing I am an acoa I'm an adult child of an alcoholic and brother Branham said to Billy Paul except for the grace of God he said this is where I'd be and then he looked at him again and he said except for the grace of God here's where you'd be also because he was the adult grandchild of an alcoholic because I'm an acoa an adult child of an alcoholic I had to break that cycle like brother Branham broke the cycle Billy Paul was not that way there's a tendency there's a real predisposition for addiction in an acoa and but for the grace of God in the Holy Ghost you would probably very easily go down that road unless you break the cycle I didn't break the cycle on purpose it was by God's grace that the cycle got broken because I realized if I didn't I would be setting my boys up for failure you understand what I'm saying there are things that that you're faced with like brother Branham said this is the way that he was and he said I loved him anyway so there's something in him even in his Brokenness Mr branham's Brokenness brother bam still looking up to with admiration not the bad parts not the murder and so forth but not the bad parts but you know what that's still dead and that's how powerful that is even when he's doing the wrong thing it's still a powerful thing and listen Young Folks whenever it gets to a place that you have to call your dear Mother and Father no matter what they've done when it comes to a place and they're not Mother and Daddy just the old man the old woman he said that's when you've taken one of the greatest backsliding states that you'll ever take you'll never know what your mother means to you and a father until you hear the squeaking of the casket as a going out the door I'll tell you what I wish I had my mother back to ask her some questions about things that I now I know now she knew you realize he said them gray hairs in his head he said you helped put them there you think about your parents so I'm saying this to you not to ruin your afternoon but I'm saying this to you because you're still breathing and you no doubt some of you have made real mistakes real tangible mistakes and sometimes the correction for those mistakes is just simply to go to your child and say I'm sorry I messed up and I need to make something right it might be to your wife it might be to your children it doesn't matter but I know that there are kids alive today that live waiting for their parents to Simply say I'm sorry I didn't get it all right I was too controlling I was too unforgiving I was too strict I was to this or that and a lot of kids are just waiting for that word to come from you can I go a little bit further so this got my attention Little David No Doubt this is the message perseverance no doubt raised in a lovely believing home with his father this is David David the shepherd his father Jesse a great man of God stop really really can anyone here tell me what might have qualified Jesse to be a great man of God what oh yeah I'd say you had faith a lot of people had faith in the Bible too and brother Brown doesn't call him a great man of God what he was the father that God chose to put David in in his house oh yeah the next king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart who does God choose to have raised that boy Jesse what in the world made him a great man of God I mean I don't know of any Giants he slew I don't even know that he ever sung a special in church I don't know that he did anything tangible that's recorded in scripture at all i i i that caught my attention because here's brother Ram calling him a great man of God some of you are reading on furiously let me spare you the stress sorry should I you are right over there charity is a daughter we never had oh isn't that cute she gets her own special day when she comes to our house and all right anyway Jesse rape man of God no doubt gathered all those boys around at night had family prayer before they went to bed probably read the schools and talked about great Jehovah how he opened the Red Sea sorry for the long sentence and a great prophet Moses brought them out following the pillar fire and all these things and I created faith what made Jesse a great man of God you know what he did he had devotions every night oh here's all these boys now they're young right they're all these boys and they're all they're all kind of uh you know at the end of the day and and uh Jesse says all right everybody time for bed let's go let's go get everybody get cleaned up we're gonna go to bed oh Dad tell us a story all right all right what one do you want to hear tell us about Moses going across the Red Sea all right guys sit down take your seats and he'd get up there and he'd be up on the on the chair and he'd say Moses stood there and held up his hands and he spoke to the Sea and it opened up there and why cry speak and all you know the the Egyptian Horsemen had come across and he he would probably dramatize that and David's sitting there wow I love this story creates a faith in David that when it comes time for David now and he's out looking after the father's sheep and he sees a bear he's like a New York City fireman on 9 11. he's running into trouble not away from it you ever see those firemen running into trouble running into those buildings on 9 11. here's David he sees the baron he's running after that he's running after the bear and he's got a slingshot and he he says he says I'm a son of God I'm a son of Israel under the Covenant and goes after that bear and you know what he's got he's got an anointing by a prophet that says he's going to be the next king of Israel so you know what he just has no fear because he knows that if God said that God's going to make it come to pass even if that bear eats me that bear is going to have to spit me out because I'm going to have to come back on my feet again because a prophet said this is what's going to happen and he's got faith to pursue that bear in the same way that the Bible says he ran out on the field and through that rocket Goliath and nobody in their right mind is going to throw a rock at Goliath and attempt to hit him in the head unless they got a promise that they're going to be a king of Israel one day and that's what he did where did that come from from sitting at the feet of Jesse and Jesse dramatizing Moses going across the Red Sea and looking back and seeing all those Egyptians in the water that created faith and faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord and David got to thinking of that of course he was the smallest and they put him out to watch a few sheep and one day the lion came in and got one and he thought now he says what am I going to say to my father about this sheep and missing here and he recalled he remembered my father read from the Scrolls and told me God was a great God to deliver his people and he would bless Israel and was with Israel and all that circumcised in the Covenant and I'm one of them I'm one of them and God's blessing is upon me and I have a right one of my father's sheep is gone and I'm going after that sheep and he grabbed these Little Shepherd's thing shot and he brought that sheep back by killing the line he was perseverant and what was God doing training him and a bear came in and one day his brothers brought something to eat he brought his brothers something to eat there and there was Goliath there and he says why don't he go out there why don't somebody go after that guy and I imagine he was thinking my father I know that if you care that much about those Lambs there how much you care about the people that are called by your name he said now they're in conflict and they're afraid and they got very perseverant and took Goliath out with that slingshot and won the Victory and they believed in what he was trying to achieve it was the will of God the word of God in the plan of God you know where it began it began at devotions in his father's house so Jesse was called a great man of God I'm just saying what the tape say you think you're not a preacher you're not a special singer you don't play drums you don't really do much that's identifiable in the church but if God gave you kids and you know a couple of basic stories you now have the potential to become a hero in the eyes of your kids you have the potential to become a hero you don't need to be a prophet you don't need to have a great super spiritual mind you know what you need to do you just need to accept the responsibility that God's put in your hands and to influence those kids towards the kingdom that makes sense some father is saying well I can't pray I can't tell a story hey it's interesting I brother rap crook is rap ever been over here to minister okay you should get him I'm not telling you what to do but you should give he's in my church this weekend let me tell you he's a great guy great young man and I had no rap very well and travel with him around the world and so forth and he came to our church and did a Sunday morning service and it's uh the titles call him boiling frogs in Babylon and if you want to go back to part two and uh he it was it was fantastic he was talking about what he does for devotions with these kids it changed the lives of many of the men in my church it was absolutely amazing and he talked about uh you know getting the uh the three wise men following the star and you know and he was just doing this as a as a devotion and uh he was he was saying that uh he got his kids all dressed up with blankets like the three wise men and he got himself a a flashlight and he turned it upside down as a lantern and he said we're just following hey these kids following around the house you know turn off all the lights and they're walking by the star they're following the star and uh he's walking around like this and his wife was dressed up with another sheet and she was King Herod where are you going to worship this child you know and uh they they had to give an answer to the king and so he said then you know we went through the house and we found the baby Jesus had a doll and found the baby Jesus and and he said man he said the kids they want me to do that one over and over and over again well he was telling me that and he was telling the church that and it was I mean there was just one example and it was a really great uh illustration of how you can hold devotions because there's two ways of talking in the Bible maybe you've heard that today and and one of them is now children thou shall sit down and listen patiently I'm going to read the future home of the Earthly bride and the Heavenly bridegroom page one paragraph one thou shall listen on the pain of death hey your four-year-old ain't gonna do that right they're not there and I have one brother who after the service was over I mean we were so happy it was just such a blessing and he had one brother who's an engineer in in our church he's a civil engineer and he's I mean I don't know if you know any Engineers or how they think but they they think like this a goes here all right there's no discussion ego's here B fits perfectly into a whether you like it or not and if it's not perfect we're going to go back to a and fix it so B fits perfectly C comes after that don't give me D give me c and D comes out and that's a as an engineer that's how they think right I'm not going to ask do we have any Engineers here because I think we probably do but this brother has two children two girls one is two one is four and I said to him on the way out of church I said how'd you enjoy service today he said it's life-changing it's been life-changing he said let me tell you how we do devotions he said my kids have three different story books for devotions they're all picture Bibles and he said at the end of the day we'll address at bedtime I'll say to them all right let's have devotions pick a story that you want to read so they'll just pick any one of the three Bibles and open it up to anywhere and say read this one Daddy and he said I used to say to my girls we haven't read the one before that are you sure you want this one yes yes that's what we want but we haven't read Jonah first we have to read the one before it and he said we'd get in a shouting match and everybody go to bed crying and my wife would say what kind of a man or a father are you you know and he said you know he said it was like I was born again when I heard that sermon he said I could just I could read it was hard for an engineer but he he actually now he does that he reads whatever they open up to he said yeah that's a good one let's read them you know what he's being he's being a great man of God because he's influencing his kids at the age level they're at and bringing them up in the way they should go and he says we don't wait till bedtime until everybody's tired and cranky he says we do it when they're feeling okay even if that's kind of my time to relax he said we do it then because the kids are intentive they're happy Daddy's home and so forth we do it he said we'll do it kind of different random times of the day in other words you brother braham's not telling us here that there's a strict pattern or order in your house you've got to find what works in your house you've got to find what works with the kids of your age right you know I look at these guys over here you're not you're not you're in big bodies but you're still young guys and and you know you parents had to deal with these guys at this age right here so you know um there's a there's a way that you uh you you deal with that because the Bible says you know fathers provoke not your children under wrath right you know why that's there you know why that's there in the Bible because you can provoke your children to Wrath you can do that it's just like Paul wrote in Ephesians 4 grieve not the Holy Spirit we're by your seal unto the day of redemption you know why he wrote that because you can you can grieve the Holy Spirit so he says provoke not your children under Wrath so let's do a demo in order to have a demo you got to have a dummy I mean a volunteer a volunteer hello volunteer let's just say that this is my son your name is Zion wow what a great name so let's say that Zion comes home from school and he says to me and I'm just home from work and he says ah dad uh I just wanted to ask you something here now he's not being arrogant or anything but he says uh hi on the camera all the boys in school have decided for a month that we're going to wear a temporary tattoo yeah you can take it off after a month but we're all going to do this tattoo thing for a month and I just kind of wanted to know if that'd be all right and there's two ways I can answer him right and the Bible says now provoked on him to wrath provoke not your son around so I can answer them this way a what a tattoo you got to be kidding me a tattoo what kind of training do you think we've given you all these years a tattoo can you understand where tattoos come from they come from Hell which is where you're going if you have the tattoo now go to your room foreign that's one way and you know what when I talk to him like that you know what he's doing he's in his in his Spirit he's backing up he's he's wanting to escape there's another way I can answer him tattoo really you listen we don't do tattoos now this is not my rule this is not my comment about tattoos here but let me show you what scripture says about tattoos and about you know putting markings on yourself and it's here in the Old Testament and then we follow it through here and look at some things that brother Graham said and you know what when I talk to him like this you know what I'm doing to him I'm discipling him a disciple as one was taught it may seem like the most stupid thing I've ever heard but nonetheless he's asking that question because he has enough confidence to come to me and he doesn't know the right answer he doesn't know the right response that's why he's doing that so he's not barging in and saying I'm wearing a tattoo and you can't say anything about it he's not doing that he's just asking me he's kind of feeling me out here when that happens I have an opportunity to disciple him and I can easily turn him off or I can teach him that's what it means when it says that you shall not provoke him to wrath because God does not want you to turn him away God wants you God wants you to take advantage of those opportunities even when something really squirrely gets asked or something funny goes on because you may be you might not know it but you may be a Jesse who's got a David and your answer might affect him in a great way because now if I tell him that about an ashoman scripture and he's got a half an ounce of holy ghost in him he's got to make a decision now do I go back to the school and tell the boys what the Bible says or not so now he's challenged in a new way and you know that'll be something you know son you don't have to do that you don't you don't have to do that in order to be accepted among the bunch here and and here what are you going to tell them you could ask I could ask him what are you going to tell him when you go back to school and he says he says to me oh how did I see that you know I don't want to I don't want to introduce the wrong thing and I don't want to give a set of precedent here I don't want to tell the boys and I'll do anything that they do so now he's got to go back to school and say I'm not going to do a tattoo 30 boys in the class 29 of them got a tattoo and one doesn't why not what are you going to say I'd ask him what are you going to say now he's got a new challenge right do you understand I'm drawing him into that process that's the idea I'm drawing him in now because now he's got a decision to make and he's got uh you know a really uh important uh precedent that he sets in relation to his testimony and his uh among his peers that's a different thing than asking Dad when you go back to your peers and you start to say hey guys you know what I'm talking to my dad about this and showed me a Bible verse back here and and uh well that's Old Testament well you know what we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so we're not Jews but you know what the moral law still applies so you know what and now all of a sudden he's got a man you got a little room here to have a conversation right them am I making sense here we are again Jehovah Jireh 1957 well Jesse brought six of them and might have said haven't he got another one Samuel Mighty got another one oh yes I got a little one that's a naughty fellow out here hurting some sheep and I'm sure he wouldn't look as good as a king now here's what's interesting about that Samuel didn't know who was to be the king he only knew out of what household they were coming he didn't know who was the king Jesse didn't know who was the king Samuel didn't know the brothers didn't know David didn't know David's not out there in the field saying I know I'm going to be king I know I know he doesn't know he's going to be king no one knows he's going to be king finally God anoints David to be the King right here's the way I understand that you and I can cut open an apple and count the seeds don't worry I'm not going to shout at you I saw you leaning back you and I can cut open an apple and count the seeds only God can look at the seed and count the apples I don't know what's in there you understand Only God Can Count the seeds Only God Can Count the apples that come out of here I can look at his life but God looks at the future that he has in mind for this young man or a young daughter whatever else and we can look at the Apple and count the seeds but only God can look at a seed and say out of that is going to come this many apples am I making sense so therefore the Bible says in the New Testament if any provide not for his own especially of those of his own house he hath denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel that strong language that's pretty strong language to be a denier of the faith and what's worse than an infidel only a fool says in his heart there is no God tell me what's worse than an infidel this is pretty strong language and in order to really understand the verse you got to understand some of these words here very briefly to provide If any man provide not for his own it means to perceive beforehand Remember The Prudent man foresees the evil remember that someone who provides for his family if he fails to do that he fails to perceive or foresee how to take care of something when something is provided for him to use to take care of the situation in other words if we go backwards here If any man provide not for his own listen you fathers that are here God knew you needed a strong message in this last day to counter the effects of laodicea and social media and all the other garbage that's out there God and gender discussions hello I don't know about you but I never woke up on a Saturday and spent my day wondering about what gender I was we went fishing but now I mean these kids are in a turmoil because they they're they're being taught you don't really know what you are really biology was really lying to you really how silly is that anyway God knew you'd need a strong message to be led by to believe and to pass on to your children raising kids in such a messy world right in a morally corrupt world you needed a strong message that's sent a clear signal in this last day and God sent it if you don't provide for your own by giving what God has provided you are actually denying the faith and worse than an infidel you refuse you're rejecting something that's offered God says I know you're living in laodicea duh I placed you here I could have placed you in any other age but I placed you here and you know what I knew what it would be like in laodicea I knew what it'd be like in 2023 so therefore I gave you this message for you to be able to counter the effects of this crazy world and to be able to establish light and peace and shalom in your home in the last days and you ain't going to get it anywhere else Google is not going to give this to you teachers are not going to give this to you in a secular environment the government is not pulling for you to raise your kids in a Godly way they're passing laws that are contrary to what we believe in our time they're protecting Sodom in the passing of many laws in our time here and and it's just God knew you'd need a strong message and for us to turn away from that or to not provide what God's accepted you know what you're worse than an Infidel that's what he's saying all right that's not my words that's a scripture God says look I know you're there but I got something for you I got something really good for you this is going to work nothing else is going to work but this is going to work apply this in your home apply this token in your home and watch what happens and God's willing to bring you to the edge of impossible and then tell you to make one more step and do it by faith in the last day and apply the word of God and watch what happens and God will bless you hey it's a walk of Faith now to do this and we'll talk about that tomorrow morning here but I will say this that this is exactly what this verse implies that God knows the evil is present all around you and this is what you need to counter that go ahead and take it and if you don't take it God goes like this what else can I do I sent the best I reserve the best message for the last day and I sent it and Vindicated it clearly and now the people don't want it now they're making websites against it hello what more God's got to be doing this thing what more can I do we ought to be thanking God for this message we ought to be thanking God that God allowed this message to be given to us in English in your mother tongue you ought to be grateful that this message is so accessible to you that you can have it at your fingertips and on your phone and you can have it wherever you are whenever whenever you need it and wherever you are in the world this message is available to you now I can't help but say this can you imagine how much Farrell would have paid for air conditioning in his chariot I mean we got it pretty good imagine imagine if you had a recording of Jesus teaching in a temple one day whoa I'd be all right imagine if you had a video or YouTube of Elijah among Karma they'll be all right Fire coming right more hits than Taylor Swift they say she sings I don't know imagine imagine if you had imagine he had a video of an interview with the Apostle Paul in the dungeon Paul is writing to the Philippians whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are wholesome whatsoever things are of good report think on these things he's in the prison I've been in that prison you know that in Rome or sorry in in Athens Greece no I travel too much in Rome there is a mammer team prison and prisons back in that they were just really a hole in the rock and they put a lid on top of it and they lowered somebody down with a rope if they didn't throw them down they just lowered them down with a rope and it'd be all kinds of Critters down there and bad water and things like that it's not a nice place and years ago when brother Brandon went to Rome they lowered him down into that prison and he prayed he took time to pray and he said this is the place and it is the only place on Earth we know where the first and last Church age messenger ever stood together and brother Rand said this was the prison and I went in that prison one time as when I was in Rome and I went down there and you know I mean it's it's just a hole in the ground but it is that place and you can't stand up in it I have a picture of me somebody took in in the prison and you can't stand up so it's not six feet tall and uh it's it's literally just a hole in the ground but imagine imagine if if somebody had a phone and interviewed an interview with Paul and and asked them who are you writing to oh the Philippians what are you writing to them and have wouldn't or how about if you had a man how about if you had a clip of Martin Luther going up to the church in Wittenberg and here I stand wow or you happen to be one of the guys who was with John Wesley and he's riding through the countryside his horse steps in the hole breaks his leg Wesley lays hands on the horse gets back on the horse and rides off and holds the meeting I'd be all right but you know what God reserved for you he recorded everything that Prophet said captured it preserved it cleaned it up wrapped it up and gives it to everybody and you can hear exactly what he said with the passion and the enthusiasm and the Vigor of almighty God coming across to us how we should value this message no other generation no other generation in 6 000 years ever had the privilege that we have to be able to have this message in our hand and God says and they're not going to use it they're not going to use it to raise their families by they're not going to use it to live by they're not going to use it to to know God they're not going to use it to understand the opening of the word and the Mysteries that were concealed in the Bible all these years God must be going like this what more can I do that's why this is such a powerful verse if a man provide not for his own fathers don't think that you don't have resources you have the greatest resource that God could have given to any generation is to take some of those stories and some of those recordings and just play those stories for your kids and brother Branham you know going across the field going to pray for a man right and he says as a minister he's a game warden but he's a minister and he's going across the field to pray for that man you know what he does he takes off his gun belt leaves it in the front seat of the truck because now he's going as a minister he's taken off the mantle of a ranger and he's going across now as a as a minister pray for a man is over there and all of a sudden he sees the bull and more importantly the bull sees him and you know what he does he apologizes to the bull how many prophets do you know that have ever apologized I mean that's what that's what happened I'm just saying what he said and he appalled sorry Mr Bull he said I Disturbed you and I didn't know you were here and he he stops like that Sydney Jackson said after that event was over and brother Branham walked off that field walked outside the fence he jumped over the fence and he looked back and saw that bull he sat on the ground and cried like a baby for about 30 minutes it was so nerve-wracking for him to stand there in the in the presence of a killer Bull with nothing between me and the bull no fence no no protection at all he's completely relying on the presence of God in order to protect him and he jumps over the fence that presence lifts he said he cried like a baby for 30 minutes now has anybody here gotten any inspiration about telling a story to their kids the last 15 minutes Jesse a great man of God no doubt told his children's stories I know men and women brother Brown said that didn't teach their children and wasn't Christians the very thing of not leading them to Christ was the wrongest thing they could ever do besides the other not to lead them to Christ you can't have a correct Union without it the fellowship is broken my goodness can I just switch for a moment and let me I want to just I want to just switch here for a moment and bring up this just this little bit of part three just for a moment because in this part three and we obviously are not going to have time to to do this what's our time frame here what what did you is it for 4 30. huh your kids are meant to grow towards independence you're raising them not to stay you are raising them to be independent you are raising them to to have their own house and their household for God you there comes a point where you have to let them go now all of you are not there and most of you are learning and and interested in hearing about how do I keep my kids close how do I monitor them how do I observe them closely and so forth but I will tell you that whether you want it or not there will come a season where they will they will go and I will also tell you too that it's important for you to understand that God puts that in a young man to want to leave and cross over that mountain and see what's on the other side and establish his own household for God God put something in a young woman to want to have her own family and to be able to raise children and to have her own household and have a husband who loves her that's not evil what you need to prepare for is how they leave how they leave is what's important you want them to leave with your blessing and you want them to leave with a sense of approval that Mom and Dad are okay with this even though they might not be happy because that's not that was not their plan I could read just quotes here where brother Branham says our plan was that Rebecca he said about Rebecca that she would stay and be a secretary and live and you know live at home and work in a trailer in his backyard he said that's what we wanted my wife and I that's what we wanted for our lives well you know what that's really nice but that's not what Rebecca wanted she wanted to get married and have her own household right and so sometimes our our desires for our children are different than the desires for uh within the within the children themselves and so then what happens next what what do we do now this is just my wife and I my wife and I are at that at this stage now so it's a it's a new phase and we're we're learning now because there are a lot of adjustments we we've raised uh boys and and kids all of our Lives we've homeschooled we've you know our home was very Central everything we did and uh everything we did we included him in it so what do we do now there's a really great article it's in your notes here and uh it is out of um what's called World magazine that's not worldly it is a Christian magazine and that magazine is now online you can go find it I think it's world.net I think but you can find it and he wrote this article called We are family now since you're turning 23. this is the article in its entirety and you can find it there it's worth reading it's very good it's written in 2000 uh but for a paragraph or two here he wrote as children grow up and begin to have children of their own whereupon they grow up to have children until both the Earth and Heaven are indeed filled with a particular couple's large posterity the family is God's invention so that was the intent that God wanted to have an earth populated with good children and he protects that principle in the Ten Commandments since our dependence is on him like a helpless baby to a loving parent and we are to address him as our father since his relationship to us in Christ is as loving and intimate as that between a groom and his bride the church is called the bride of Christ that doesn't mean it's not in the message here but I thought it was very well written he said although the family is the basis of culture as any Anthropologist will say today parents often find themselves having to protect their children from their own culture they are the basis of culture but we find ourselves protecting the children from the culture that they're living in instead of helping parents to teach children to control themselves and to act morally and mature into adults our society in its entertainment industry at Schools and Government often seems to undermine parents and be at war against the children you have this dichotomy you have this this conflict that's inherent here that what I'm teaching them at home is not what they're hearing outside and and and this becomes a frustrating cycle because the kids are they look up to teachers as authorities they look up to uh Educators and and the people who are leaders and coaches and so forth they look at them as people who they know the difference and they're telling me something different than what my parents are telling me so we have a we have an inherent conflict and as a result of that kids are actually they're actually staying home longer with their parents not necessarily because that's a good thing but because they're scared of marriage and the statistics bear that out it's back on the rise again so let me skip C.S Lewis wrote this and said interestingly God is not so much offended that we want too much as by the fact that we are satisfied with so little God is not so much offended that we want too much as by the fact that we are satisfied with so little he offers us the highest of Adventures in our Christian Life and we settle for the stale mediocrity of lukewarm routines I ain't just going to church and it's Sunday so we'll go and it's Wednesday so we'll go for parents the counterpart to this idea is that most mothers and fathers actually want too little for their children they settle for success in the world's terms but God would have us aim higher not like an ambitious stage mother pushing her child uh my only talented children into the spotlight but watch like a fine Jeweler making the best possible use of each bit of gold and silver and precious stone that he has my children are Priceless treasures and I want God's highest and best for them that's C.S Lewis sometimes we can settle for too little and think well you know what he's not smoking and drinking and he doesn't have any tattoos or metal sticking in his body so you know what on the curve he's okay Hey listen we're not people who judge things by the Curve we should be praying for our children and we should be proactively encouraging our children hey seek God's best and and and not be satisfied with just what everybody else is doing and they're doing this over in this church over here so it must be okay you need to find that path that God has ordained you for as God's put you here for a purpose and you need to seek that with all your heart and just let God lead you into that into that place that God is going to use you for hey we should be encouraging our kids to do that not just like uh some some uh leftover somebody swept Along by the flow of things and by the crowd Hey listen God wants great things for your children God wants great things for your family you need to open up your mind to the possibility of that and ask God Lord do whatever it takes in our family here change me change my wife change whatever is necessary in order for our kids to step on that platform and keep going and Ascend the place that you have for them May nothing in this household be a hindrance to God fulfilling that part there is a a principle and climbing mountains and I've I've been here I've been near the base camp of Mount Everest and there's lots of people who pay 70 000 Plus in order to climb Everest doesn't take a huge amount of skill to get to the base camp and then to get to a couple of the other stages that are there but from 26 000 feet to the peak is what is referred to as the death zone and if you're going to die you're probably going to die there all you need is a wind shift and it could be over in climbing Everest and that's why they call it the death zone you don't climb all the way up to 26 000 feet look at your Sherpa guides and say hey we got this we're good you can go back now you need you need them at this particular point when you're this high you need them right there I was at Everest and I uh just to let you know how dangerous this is I was I was flying from Darjeeling in India to uh Kathmandu Nepal which is the Nepal is the country where Everest is and and Kathmandu is the capital and so we had to fly over Everest to get there okay we got it's all mountains in that area and you got to fly over the top so the pot we were in a in a big jet and the pilot comes on this is 1978. something there and the pilot comes on and he says well folks he said today is a rare day uh we have a clear sky there are no clouds today said so that means we're going to we're going to try to fly over the top of Everest and let you see the Peak from above so whatever side of the plane you're on it doesn't matter you're going to be able to look out and see the sides of Everest as we go over the top here and he says this this is a rare thing because it's always cloudy it has its own weather pattern and it's a rare day so he says so we're gonna we're gonna approach the mountain now from the south and then we're gonna go over the top and so he he revs up the engine you can hear it he revs up the end just a big jet now and the plane starts to do this number like one of my sons when I was disciplining him and it starts to quiver and shake like that and he's just trying to fly this thing and then he goes yeah like this and he said sorry folks can't do it he said we'll try this again he said there's so much wind and force coming up the side of this mountain he said that it's pushing the plane back so we can't do it and he said let's try it again you know it's like a lottery ticket right not a plane ticket and he does the same thing goes up to the mountain and starts to do this thing and shake and quiver and you can hear the rattling in the plane and he says yeah he comes on he says no we can't do we're going to have to go around so he makes us sweep around and comes down lands in in Kathmandu it is that powerful it is that dangerous up there and it looks really pretty right all the pictures there looks really pretty it's a very very dangerous place you do not want to let your guides go the last three thousand feet you've managed to climb 26 000 you don't want to let your guides go and neither do you want your guides to say you know what you're in pretty good shape you guys have done pretty good up to 26 000 feet why don't we uh hey we'll see you when you get down uh hello now is when we really need you in some of these articles that are written here this is the sad thing about a lot of teenagers and young people today they're being taught to make these decisions on their own you're now in what is referred to in those teen years the death zone because there's a lot of Temptations out there that are not really been dealt with in any other age and there are subtle traps that Satan is laying out there and you know what you need good guidance you need good leadership you need Sound Advice in that time period when they're getting married when they're establishing their own households when they're buying their first house and when they're all of a sudden now making contractual agreements to have a credit card and have death and to be able to sign for a loan and all the rest of it you know what they need they need good advice right then they need good advice and it's the last three thousand feet before they establish their own household and their own place for God they absolutely do need that during that time you don't want to you want to encourage your your teenagers don't dismiss the help that God's put in your pathway what before this thing is over you want to make sure that you incorporate all the wise counsel and advice you possibly can while you have that advice and don't dismiss it it is absolutely it is absolutely imperative for you making the right decision during that season of life Greg Harris wrote no I'm sorry let me go back just one screen Greg Harris wrote walking with the wise is a lifestyle not a program he's referring to Proverbs 13 20. He that walketh with the wise shall be wise but a companion of food shall be destroyed if you want to be wise hang around with wise people for young people it's really important for them to find mentors and that's what I was talking about this morning that I encourage my sons if you're thinking about law find somebody who practices law and talk to them so that you can understand what practicing law really is like or working on a construction team or working in a hospital being a volunteer and pushing a broom and see could I go in the hospital every day and smell that could I go into hospital every day and listen to people hollering because they're in pain would I be able to do that well in theory and on a website that might be neat because you know they look at the dollar signs but in reality people are called to do a particular job like that you need to immerse yourself in here and and get a look at what that really is and a lot of times you talk to kids and they're in college how long have you been in college three years what are you studying I really don't know mystery 101. hey save your money get a job save your money all you're doing is prolonging adolescence most times adolescents already know what they're doing and it's a shame to be in college and spending that much money continuing to do what they don't know what they're doing now there are exceptions here some of you are looking at me funny girl walking with the wise is a lifestyle not a program it includes walking working together eating together playing together worshiping together studying together and this is where God placed the responsibility for child training and education and it works very well in aiming children at God's highest and best Targets in life that's what I want for my children God's highest and best I don't want my children to be merely counted among the redeemed or the reformed I want them to stand with the reformers understand what he's saying now that's what I want from my children God's highest and best I don't want my children to be merely counted among the reformed I want them to stand with the reformers brother random taught us that God will use whatever you give him I think it's a great thing to teach your children give everything you have to God at an early age give them your wallet give them your car keys give them your hands give them your mind give them your eyes give me your mouth and let God use whatever he wants to use because then you can stand among the reformers now I wanna I wanna just uh for a moment just talk about the scripture here Psalm 128 David writes blessed is every man that feareth the Lord that walketh in his ways for thou shall eat to labor thine hands and happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee and he's speaking of a man here and I we can easily show that blessed is every man that fears the Lord thy wife shall be as a fruitful Vine by the sides of thine house I don't know if you've ever seen a a Vine that will grow like uh I've been in in Ireland and England Scotland many times and you see those Vines creeping up the side of a brick building Stone building and it's amazing how how they've survived and done that for hundreds and hundreds of years in our country you see Vines growing up vinyl siding figure that out what nourishment are they getting out of vinyl siding right but Vines do three things they cling they cluster and they repeat Vines will cling they'll cluster together and then it'll repeat and do it again and David is David is saying and God is telling him blessed is a man that fear of the Lord his wife is going to prosper she's going to continue on she's gonna she's gonna grow she's gonna continue to become what God wants her to become and thy children watch like Olive plants around the table really it's interesting about Olive plants and I'll give you the short story in the hard Rocky dry soil of the Middle East any kind of plant doesn't grow easily so if you want to have an olive tree you've got to take a little plant little sapling and put it in the ground and water it and nurture it intend it and prune it very carefully because it'll dry out and die really quickly it takes about 15 or 16 years for a little plant to really put down roots in the Middle Eastern soil and survive on its own it actually takes about that long 15 or 16 years but once it gets established for the next 40 Years it'll produce and after 40 Years it'll slow down hello when a man fears the Lord his children will be like Olive plants and you're going to have to tend to them for 15 16 17 18 years or so because they're going to need to a little help in standing on their own but there will come a day when they will stand on their own and you know what over the next 40 years you'll probably get some grandchildren that's the fruit you're looking for right that's the fruit we were looking for to have gr you know to see that to see that young tree now produce on its own now to develop its own life and have its own family tree that's the idea you want your children to grow and become that Family Tree on their own and he says and behold that thus the man will be blessed that fear is the Lord in other words that's the right fruit of a man who fears God he has children and he has children's children and the the tree grows the family tree grows that's the idea and that was God's intent in the first place is to have a family tree that spread well beyond just that initial family but it would have lots of branches to it and the Earth would be filled with all of those children that God intended for us to have how many can say Amen now let me just I'm going to skip here and I realize that you're being very patient and very uh very gracious here but I know it's the afternoon and I want to give you one more quotation this will be my last quotation it's going to take me 45 minutes to get read it but no I'm only kidding brother Branham will All Sons and Daughters of True born-again Believers be saved that's the question I need you to watch what he says now okay and I'm wrapping up so just bear with me a little bit no brother no they sure won't they'll have to be born again just like their father and mother was born of the spirit and that's what makes a man a new person in Christ is when they're born again so just because they live in your house doesn't mean that their bride in the same way that if you went and stood in the forest it wouldn't make you a tree right I said just because your children are raised in your house doesn't make them believers in the same way that you stood and if you went and stood in your garage you wouldn't be a car right you got to be born a car in order to be a car you got it so he says you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be thou and the household shall be saved and you pray and commit your children to God and hold on unto God and believing they will be saved what else can you do because you you're not their Savior and you can't guarantee their salvation or their Eternal Destiny that's never been in your hands right so you can really just pray and commit them to God and trust that God will take care of the rest and he says I just went through that experience with my Rebecca so now he tells this personal story now I want you to watch the story he said just committed to God and when she got and I'm editing this okay just for time's sake when she got to that little teeny stage and she was going with some girl we first went out there and this is out in Arizona run over to some girl's house taking music lessons and I came by one day brother Mann came by where she was taking lessons and he said and here the girl was sitting there at the piano playing rock and roll well he said that was just enough for me so I told her to stay away from F from over there and she said well it's the only place I got to go to take music and he said now every kid goes through that practically every kid goes through that age he said we got to think their thoughts so now she's being imagine now she's this is a prophet and and even though it's her father now she's she's saying things like this back to him so then a few days after her mother got after her for something and she sassed her and he said now that's not Rebecca at all she took off and slammed the door and almost knocked things off the wall and went to school and I thought my initial reaction was I'll take my belt off right that was his initial reaction but I thought wait a minute I got to thank 18 year old thoughts you know what he's you know what he's going through he's going through another stage Trevor what page are you on there is on page 30. this whole quote is on page 30. so you can you can read and meet us started crying and said I I know and I said I know you've done all you can do and I've done all I can do but now if it's out of our hands we got to take another step because you know what these are not kids anymore these are not little kids she's 18 years old well look honey now you got to listen to me and I it's hard for you to do this I'm your husband people drive across the nation they get a few words of advice I understand that I know but he said now Becky never did that to me and when her mother said something and she slammed the door and she said you expect me to sit here and be a Wallflower all my life and blam me she slammed the door and went out that was the devil so now you see the the tension here right see the tension in this in this situation here and it's just kind of landed on their lap they've raised her the best they could and brother man tells experiences with Rebecca in the early years how she cried for those first two years until the angel said pray for her and so forth he explains all of that but now here we are at a point where she's just throwing seemingly throwing all that back at her parents and he said and I took midi for about an hour and I said meaty take your hands off you can't deal with this like you used to deal with this now we have to deal with this differently and she said me that's my kid and I said brother mam said isn't it mine too if she was dying this morning you'd have to commit her to God for her Eternal Destiny why can't we commit her to God now for her Earthly Journey so you understand now he's switched he's making a switch it's not easy now for a father to make a switch like this with his daughter but he's realizing we you know what we've turned a corner here boys and this is now a little bit differently we've got to think a little bit differently it would be unfair for us to treat her like a 12 year old she's not and so we gotta well you know what we gotta face the music here we got to face the reality that this is how it is and sister media said me not say anything to her and I said I never said that but we'll quit scolding her we'll just advise her she needs a buddy and you're the one to be her buddy you and I we're her parents so they're moving into a different phase now this relationship and he said these kids today need a buddy so we got down there in our knees and we committed it to God and I said I know she's 18 years old and a girl that age will think about boys and we've kept her in and I never wanted to see her get married I want to put her in the office and do the work I want to see her filled with the spirit and walk like that we all wanted that well Rebecca didn't right we've raised her all we can and put her in the hands of God and commit her uh you know back to God and I said that's when she then when she does anything say Becky darling mother don't want you to do that but I'm your pal I'll stick by you and let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her it might be the wrong woman you got to be making sure that you're the relationship holds you in the time you can't apply the physical restrictions what what's what's going to hold this thing together now it's the relationship that's it he doesn't have secret weapons here he doesn't have uh you know he can't he can't you know pull the toys out of a room or something else it's a relationship that's going to hold this thing together that's it committing this to God and sometimes you know what folks that's what we're down to when it comes to your teenage children your older kids sometimes that's all you've got is your relate your relationship with God their relationship with God and my relationship with that child and he says now if you don't give her the right kind of love somebody else will step right in there and give her the wrong kind of love and you be that woman that does that loving honey that sounds kind of crude and I'm common we're common to one another because we're husband and wife but we never let that happen we must remember at this we must excuse me remember this is in the name of the Lord and so she said all right we got down committed at the Lord and said I'll said we take our hands off it and that afternoon she came in and she said well I guess you're going to say I can't go over there this is the last screen and Meaty said no I never said anything about it you know mother don't want you to do that you know would like to kill your your daddy when you heard when he heard you up there playing the boogie boogie music and never what it was with that girl he didn't want you to do that and we don't want you to do that but Becky we just committed it to the Lord and I want you to know that we love you whether you do whatever you do we still love you that is unconditional love my love for you does not be depend on your behavior hey aren't you glad that Jesus Christ doesn't love you based on your behavior he loves us unconditionally so now in this relationship in this household Grace is introduced in a way it's never been introduced before and now unconditional love is being practiced here and she hollered and said well I'm going anyhow and said all right dear all right I'll have supper for you when you come back and she never did go and she never has been there since not long after that she met George George is a Christian and the rest is history so sometimes it's not being stronger sometimes it is just being wise let's close our notes and let me just tell you a little story and then we'll quit you know when it comes to fathers and it comes to raising kids hey there there are just lots and lots of challenges and some of you that are here today you might be hearing all of this and saying uh where can I sign up to quit how do I get out of this and I I will tell you this be rest assured of this that if you're raising children today I want you to know this I'll be praying for you because we need to be praying one for another and in your church you need to come to church and say Lord bless my family and bless every family in this church and help us to do our very best at leaning on your word and leaning into the leading of the Lord that we can raise our kids and because all churches is a group of families that have come together right so whenever you do anything to strengthen the family you strengthen the church because that's all churches a bunch of families so sometimes you know it's it's not the great big things it's not one great big thing it's not some extraordinary thing a lot of times it's just the little things that make a difference in your child's life and uh I remember you know in Ohio county fairs are a big deal right yeah some of you folks that have eaten just a little too many elephant ears are looking at me saying Amen brother Barry amen and uh in Hocking County we had a County Fair and uh that's not Hocking County by the way but we had a county fair and my our boys were in a 4-H club and sister Becky was the queen of 4-H back in our day because I was to Scouts what she was to 4-H so the boys were in 4-H and they learned a bunch of stuff and she was the den mother of uh 4-H for a little she she participated and went to all the functions and so forth and we got involved in a horse Club believe it or not a horse club now I didn't know the first thing about horses but my in-laws thought the best thing that my boys could use in life as a horse my in-laws thought that I didn't think that but my in-laws were convinced that that's what they needed now I didn't know anything about horses and I still know very little matter of fact I didn't even know what side was the hairiest side of a horse do you know what side is the hairiest side of a horse the hairiest the side with the most hairs anybody know what side of the horse has the most hair the outside you're right see mostly didn't even know that so my parents my in-laws one day they roll up in our yard up in Ohio when we lived in Logan they rolled up in the yard and they were pulling a horse trailer and had a Welsh racking Pony in the back of it and they said here you go guys and I said I'm having nothing to do with that horse that's your horse I'm having nothing to do with it they knew less about horses than I did and I had to look after that horse until it died I mean it was we were we were close buddies by the time we've done it was a great Pony it had been raised in a family that took it to shows and when I when I talk about 4-H shows we're talking about running barrels anybody know what running barrels is or uh Showmanship right simple stuff parading around the parade field and running barrels or doing trots and different things you know just real basic stuff in horsemanship and that's what we did in the Hocking County Fair and every year we'd go up and do that in the Hocking County Fair a lot of fun kids enjoyed it I did the work but they enjoyed it matter of fact if if Now by now you know my kids Andrew would dress up in the cowboy hat in the vest and walk around like this you know Peter would be over there shoveling the muck out of the Stalls and you know loved it and uh we'd go out there with all the kids and they had everybody segregated in the different age groups and these were all little kids now seven eight nine ten years old and uh in the group was a little down syndrome boy and his name was Danny kalamanus Danny had Down syndrome so he was a hefty young guy but he was only about 10 or 11. he's a big guy and very nice little boy but very very simple just in his way and and we all knew Danny and when Danny uh participated in the county fair uh he he was always in his own class he was in the handicapped class and he was the only kid in the handicap class so in every uh event that he participated in guess who won Danny and uh and I I remember you know at the end of the day when they give out the trophies he'd have the big trophy and he'd be so proud he'd be holding his trophy and they'd all sit on the fence and they'd take a picture for the newspaper and Danny be holding his big trophy first place and best in his class and so forth and he had a big smile on his face and a big white Stetson hand I can still see him and he was just so proud he'd smile and you know get his picture made and be in the paper every year he won and you know what we all I mean that was just a fact of life but what was really touching about that story was every year we'd see Danny's Family drive up and the father would be there and he just he just kind of a guy you know what I don't even know his name I know him only as Mr kalamanas and he'd get up he'd Park his truck and come around the back and open it up take the horse out and get a bit of hay feed the horse and get his saddle get his tack out and put it on the horse and get it ready make sure it had a bit of water and he would he would then walk it over to the stall and you know get get lined up with all the other kids that were there Danny would do this Danny would he had he had a new vest on every year he had a new vest in his boots and his stets in half and he wouldn't bend you know he didn't want to wrinkle anything and he was just he just like he was so proud to be there so happy to be there finally at the fair and and everybody's you know looking at him and he was just so so delighted you know and we love Danny I mean he's a great guy and and because Danny was was down syndrome he couldn't take the horse by himself right he couldn't ride off and do barrels by himself so his father would take the reins and he was allowed to do this and he'd take the reins and he'd run like this and run the barrels and run around and and Danny as he was riding around the ring Danny would hold on to the reins and lean back and he'd he'd squealed I can still hear him he'd squeal like in the air as he was so happy to be moving fast you know and he's just moving along in a truck but his father would come along like this and he'd stop and I'd see I can still see him and he would stop in the dust had just come up you know in the in the ring and he'd be covered in Dustin and he'd go around the next barrel and go around the next barrel and he's just he was just doing that with Danny and he had sweat on his face and was just turning muddy and then he would do Showmanship and he'd walk the horse down with Danny on it and walk back and Danny would be so happy so proud being on the horse and and all afternoon his father ran that horse for Danny and then at the end of the day when they were giving out trophies Danny would have his trophy like this and he'd sit on the fence and he'd be so happy first place and I'd look over and here's Mr calamans and he'd be over here in the back of the truck and he'd take off all the gear wipe down the horse give him a little bit of water give him a little bit of hay wipe down the horse get him in the trailer lock it all up he's sitting the cab of the truck and he just wait until Danny was done and he uh he did that without ever coming around and saying I'm Danny's father I'm I'm Danny's father and I I honestly I'm ashamed but I don't even know his name and uh he he did that year after year after year and and made sure that Danny had the best experience and everything that he needed in order to participate in everything he needed in order to be included in the group he did all of that and we never knew his name and I thought to myself many times and I've told the story many times forgive me but I thought to myself if I could be a father like that who sacrificed so unselfishly and so caringly for his son that he never got any Fanfare and he never got any promotion he never got any acknowledgment at all but he just did it because he loved his son so much and just wanted his son to have that good experience of being in the fair winning the trophy and stuff like that and I thought wow Lord help me be that kind of a father that you know what it's not necessary that people know me but Lord let my boys Excel let them let them receive the benefits of the sacrifice and and let them grow and become what you want them to become and I often often thought about that story and often thought about because I can still see him in my mind's eye and I thought foreign if ever there was a person who who just exhibited the real attributes of a loving father who got nothing in return seemingly got nothing in return it would have been Mr kalamanas and he just did it so faithfully and so consistently and did it only because he loved his boy if I could be that kind of a father I think that'd be a good thing I think that'd be a good thing and you think about how sometimes it's it's an easy thing to just kind of go through the motions and do the normal things but when you think about how he must have viewed his son and how he loved him so much that he was willing to sacrifice and embarrass himself in front of everybody by running around the field like that and so sweaty and Dusty and everything else and it didn't stop him at all he just he just did he did it for Danny and I think about how the Lord loved us and did what he did for us and so embarrassingly and so unhesitatingly did it not for his own welfare but he did it because he loved you and I'm thinking wow if that's what we're talking about when we talk about the attribute of a father Lord Give Me That kind of a heart for my for my kids and for my grandkids and help me do whatever I need to do whether nobody understands and whether nobody agrees but let me do let me say I'm sorry let me make things right let me work the extra hour let me go the extra mile let me do what's necessary to make sure that I'm fulfilling the role he has described I will assure you that none of this what we've talked about today happens automatically you don't just because you're in the message doesn't mean your home is foolish shalom it doesn't matter that your your children are going to turn out right that listen you're you're foolish if you believe that that's going to happen automatically just because you're a believer in Malachi 4. it doesn't happen that way you you had to be willing to invest you have to be willing to sweat you had to be willing to do the unselfish thing you had to be willing to go the extra mile sometimes you got to go to the Cross first just because somebody needs to go to the cross sometimes you just gotta you just gotta bring the family to a place of prayer and forgiveness and and and uh you know humility sometimes you just got to bring your family to the to that place first because somebody needs to do it and you know what buddy you're the leader you're the father here and God's going to look to you first and it isn't right for a woman to take that place in the household even if the father doesn't sometimes a woman is forced into positions like that but I will tell you if God's going to deal with that family he wants to deal with the man and buddy we should be present we should be present enough to say Lord if you've got to do something in our family Lord use me use me as a vessel here and I think men got to be willing to step up to the plate and and not necessarily be some sort of a superhero like Hollywood portrays but I think you got to be a little bit like Mr kalamanus who's willing to say whatever it takes whatever it takes willing to do it let's pray Heavenly Father we are so thankful that your word contains so many wonderful truths that now we can enjoy with Revelation and understanding and you have made your will and your purpose so clear for us I I thank you for that Lord we enjoy things that other ages only thought about and probe death but now you've made your word so clear to us in the name of Jesus Christ I pray for these families that have been through this today and I I just asked that you would impart something in their hearts that they might embrace the role of Mom and Dad fatherhood and motherhood in a healthy way and influence their families and their grand families towards the kingdom there are a million ways to do it wrong but you have a way and we want to embrace that way and in the name of Jesus Christ I commit this people down to your hands I thank you for ministers that have such a desire that they would want their people to hear things like this Lord and I I just ask that you would help them to apply it with lots of Grace be willing to forgive and move on and Lord help us to have that willingness to say whatever it takes in whatever way we can make the Holy Spirit pleased to dwell in our home and Lord give us the strength to do that we love you and we thank you and ask your blessing now upon every family that's represented here may you bless them and enrich them in the name of Jesus Christ we pray foreign
