[35:44] fill your scripture to us nahim the
[35:47] first chapter in the seventh verse the
[35:49] Lord is good
[35:51] a stronghold in the day of trouble
[35:54] and he knoweth them that trust in him
[35:57] amen may God bless his word he may be
[35:59] seated tonight the Lord is good a
[36:02] stronghold in the day of trouble and he
[36:05] knoweth them that trust in him so
[36:07] tonight just for a text I want to take
[36:09] trust in him who will not leave you amen
[36:11] there's a there's a day of trouble
[36:13] around us there's a time of uncertainty
[36:16] for the world around us but we have an
[36:18] anchor amen we have we have a soulless
[36:21] we have we have something that we're
[36:23] looking to we're not we're not just
[36:24] hoping for it but we see a reality that
[36:27] this word is coming to pass before us
[36:29] and and we see all the negative parts of
[36:32] the of the prophecies coming to pass and
[36:34] that just reassures us as a believer
[36:36] that there is somebody going to fulfill
[36:38] the positive side of that prophecy that
[36:41] will trust in him in the day of trouble
[36:43] and he will be their Refuge you know I
[36:45] think many times the devil will try to
[36:47] get us um our eyes off of how Victorious
[36:51] we really are
[36:53] and it seems to be in this age and just
[36:55] visiting with different Believers and
[36:57] different ones and seemingly like last
[36:59] year maybe somebody that was on top of
[37:01] the mountain this year was just going
[37:02] through a gloomy patch or a valley and
[37:05] you know we have those times and we have
[37:07] those trials but we can never forget who
[37:10] we are in this world we can never forget
[37:11] where we're going after this that it's
[37:14] real easy to get caught up in just a a
[37:16] Monday to Friday grind and and and to
[37:19] forget who you really are and and the
[37:21] devil's real quick to remind you that
[37:23] you know you're just flashed and you're
[37:25] going to make a mistake and you're going
[37:27] to fall and you're not you're not you're
[37:29] not really doing what you're called to
[37:30] do but I think it's time to kick the
[37:33] devil out of our space I think it's time
[37:35] to kick the devil out of our home and
[37:37] out of our joy and out of our our
[37:39] Victory I believe that the the prophet
[37:41] of God said that we are his victory so
[37:44] in order for us to to take ourselves out
[37:46] of that Victory we're declaring that God
[37:48] is Not Victorious because we are his
[37:51] victory I believe that each and every
[37:52] one of us here tonight are the victory
[37:54] of Christ that he paid for on Calvary so
[37:57] if we take ourselves out of that we have
[37:59] now limited God to say that he wasn't
[38:01] enough or his sacrifice was enough but I
[38:04] know as Believers here tonight we're all
[38:06] in one Accord that it was enough to pay
[38:08] the penalty it was enough to pay the
[38:10] price but we've got to recognize that
[38:13] the day we're living in his whole his
[38:16] whole plan is resting on our success
[38:19] so he's not going to leave us but he's
[38:21] going to see us through all the way to
[38:23] the end I think we just need to remind
[38:25] ourselves we're trusting not in our own
[38:28] ability or in our own Merit but we're
[38:30] trusting in the one who said he would
[38:32] never leave us he'd never forsake us
[38:34] he'd never he'd never go away from us
[38:36] he'd never make us walk alone but he
[38:38] would be with us even in us to the very
[38:40] end amen I I believe that sometimes we
[38:43] we can put a good face on uh for the
[38:47] church member or put a good face on for
[38:49] the Sunday morning but many of us will
[38:51] fight private battles that no one else
[38:53] will ever know about him many times
[38:55] you'll you'll find yourself having to
[38:57] battle within yourself that that maybe
[38:59] your pastor doesn't know about or maybe
[39:01] your spouse doesn't know about her uh
[39:03] maybe your mama doesn't know about it
[39:05] but you're having an internal struggle
[39:07] within it but it's important to know
[39:09] where your trust is in you know if our
[39:12] trust was in the bank we'd be in bad
[39:14] shape today if our trust was in the
[39:15] stock market we'd be in bad shape if our
[39:18] if our trust was in in our own ability
[39:20] to do it we'd be in bad shape but our
[39:22] trust is in him who will not leave us he
[39:25] made us a promise he would not leave us
[39:27] in the day of trouble but he would be
[39:30] there to comfort us and to guide us and
[39:32] to lead us and when he the spirit of
[39:34] Truth has come he will lead us and guide
[39:36] us into all things and that includes
[39:38] Victory joy and overcoming power and
[39:41] quickening power and and a Rapture is
[39:44] included into all things I believe
[39:47] that's our goal that's our Strife but if
[39:49] we're not if we're not if we're not
[39:50] focusing on that the devil will take our
[39:52] focus and put it on very temporal things
[39:55] and we'll be kicking sand around
[39:57] wondering if we're really called or if
[39:58] we're really a Believer if we take our
[40:00] Focus off of this word so tonight I just
[40:03] want to encourage us a little
[40:04] not alone in your struggle but the devil
[40:07] would like every one of us to think that
[40:09] we're isolated in our anxiety or
[40:11] isolated in our depression and we're the
[40:13] only ones going through that but but the
[40:15] Bride of of Christ is being attacked
[40:17] more than ever in this day and age but
[40:20] we have a promise that we will overcome
[40:22] we will overcome cancer we will overcome
[40:25] anxiety we will overcome that depressive
[40:28] Spirit we will overcome diabetes we will
[40:30] overcome the the cares of this world we
[40:33] will overcome the fog of laodicea we
[40:36] will overcome by putting our trust in
[40:39] him who has already overcome he already
[40:42] overcome death that's the greatest
[40:44] weapon that Satan has is death itself
[40:47] and he already overcame it so for trust
[40:50] is in him whoever came it's not about
[40:52] how I can make it or if you have the
[40:54] ability brother Paul to make it but our
[40:56] trust is in him that's already made it
[40:58] he's already overcome he's already
[41:00] showed us away but but but I think in
[41:03] the scripture I was asking a brother
[41:04] some time ago I said is there someone in
[41:06] the scripture that you feel that maybe
[41:08] fought private battles that that maybe
[41:10] the people around him weren't privy to
[41:12] he said David immediately I said I was
[41:14] thinking the same thing yeah they even
[41:16] fought many battles but yet we can find
[41:18] so much courage in David's David's
[41:21] revelation of who his trust was in now I
[41:24] didn't give the the boys the scripture
[41:26] back there but you can just you can just
[41:28] take them and and and and maybe uh read
[41:31] them in your own time we're going to go
[41:32] through them pretty pretty fast just to
[41:34] encourage our faith but David knowing
[41:38] who his God was knowing that he was
[41:40] nothing without his God he he knew that
[41:42] he would fail or he would fall short or
[41:44] he was a nobody before God came and
[41:47] called him but God anointed him to see
[41:49] him in his age I believe God anointed us
[41:52] to see God in our age to see him
[41:55] manifested in his word he was he was
[41:58] anointed for that brother man was saved
[41:59] now listen closely do as David did put
[42:02] your future in his hand how what am I to
[42:05] know to know what to do brother Brandon
[42:07] put your future in his hand no matter
[42:09] what comes or goes trust him
[42:12] he is the word now no David said his
[42:15] time is in my hand trust in him all the
[42:19] time always trust in him he knew who
[42:22] held the future David did that's the
[42:24] reason he could say this there is only
[42:26] there's only one holds the future that's
[42:29] God so he holds the future why don't you
[42:32] let him hold you I think that's a pretty
[42:35] encouraging word from the prophet of God
[42:36] if he holds tomorrow why don't you let
[42:39] him hold your circumstance you're going
[42:40] through tonight he already has overcome
[42:43] on the other side so we'll start with
[42:45] Psalm 62 in the first verse truly my
[42:48] soul waiteth upon God from him cometh my
[42:50] salvation he only is my rock and my
[42:53] salvation he is my defense I shall not
[42:55] be greatly moved my soul wait thou only
[42:58] upon God for my expectation is from him
[43:01] he only is my rock and my salvation he
[43:04] is my defense I shall not be moved in
[43:08] God is my salvation and my glory the
[43:10] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[43:12] God trust in him at all times somebody
[43:15] say all times
[43:17] ye people pour out your heart before him
[43:20] God is a refuge for us Selah Psalms 37
[43:24] the first verse fret not thyself because
[43:26] of evil doers neither be thou envious
[43:28] against the workers of iniquity for they
[43:30] shall soon be cut down like grass and
[43:32] wither as the green herb trust in the
[43:35] Lord and do good so shalt thou dwell in
[43:37] the land and verily Thou shalt be fed
[43:39] Delight thyself also in the Lord and He
[43:42] Shall give the desires of thine heart
[43:44] commit thy way unto the Lord trust also
[43:48] in him and he shall bring it to pass
[43:51] Psalms 56 and 1. be merciful unto me o
[43:54] God for man would swallow me up he
[43:56] fighting daily oppresseth Me Mine
[43:58] enemies with daily swallow me up for
[44:00] they be many that fight against Me O
[44:02] thou most high what time I am afraid I
[44:05] will trust in thee somebody say trust in
[44:07] thee in God I will praise his word and
[44:11] God I have put my trust I will not fear
[44:13] what flesh can do unto me every day they
[44:16] rest my words all their thoughts are
[44:18] against me for evil they gather
[44:19] themselves together they they hide
[44:21] themselves they mark my steps when they
[44:24] wait for my soul shall they escape by
[44:26] iniquity and thine anger cast down the
[44:28] people o God thou tell us my wanderings
[44:31] put thou my tears into that bottle are
[44:34] they not in thy book when I cry unto
[44:36] thee then shall my enemies turn back
[44:38] this I know for God is for me and God
[44:42] will I praise his word and the Lord will
[44:44] I praise his word and God have I put my
[44:47] trust I will not be afraid somebody say
[44:49] I will not be afraid what man can do
[44:53] unto me that vows are upon me o God I
[44:56] will render Praises unto thee for thou
[44:58] Hast delivered my soul from Death will
[45:01] Wilt not thou deliver my feet from
[45:03] falling that I may walk before God in
[45:05] the light of the living Psalms 9 and the
[45:08] ninth verse the Lord it also will be a
[45:10] refuge for the oppressed a refuge in
[45:12] times of trouble and they that Know Thy
[45:14] Name will put their trust in these and
[45:17] we say trust in thee for thou Lord has
[45:20] not forsaken them that seek thee Psalms
[45:22] 118-5 I called upon the Lord in distress
[45:25] and the Lord answered me and set me in a
[45:27] large place the Lord is on my side I
[45:31] will not fear somebody say I will not
[45:33] fear what man can do unto me the lord
[45:37] taketh my part with him that helped me
[45:39] therefore shall I see my desire upon
[45:41] them that hate me it is better to trust
[45:44] in the Lord than to put confidence in
[45:46] man it is better to trust in the Lord
[45:48] than to put confidence in princes
[45:50] Proverbs the third chapter in the fifth
[45:52] verse trust in the Lord with all thine
[45:54] heart and lean not unto thine own
[45:57] understanding proverbs 30 and 5 every
[45:59] word of God is pure he is just Shield
[46:01] unto them that put their trust in him
[46:04] Isaiah 57 and the 13th verse when thou
[46:06] Christ that that companies deliver the
[46:08] but the wind shall carry them all away
[46:11] vanity shall take them but he that
[46:13] putteth his trust in me shall possess
[46:16] the land and shall inherit my Holy
[46:19] Mountain Isaiah the 26th chapter that
[46:22] will keep him in perfect peace whose
[46:23] mind is stayed on thee because he
[46:26] trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord
[46:29] forever somebody say forever for in the
[46:32] Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength for
[46:34] he bringeth down them that dwell on high
[46:36] the lofty City he layeth it low he
[46:39] layeth it low even to the ground he
[46:41] bring it even to the dust the foot shall
[46:43] tread it down even the foot of the poor
[46:45] and the steps of the needy there's just
[46:48] some scriptures that you can there's
[46:49] plenty more to go through but there's
[46:51] some scriptures you can encourage
[46:52] yourself our trust is in him who will
[46:55] not fill us he will not leave us he will
[46:57] not forsake us he doesn't forget about
[46:59] your need he knows exactly where you're
[47:02] at but your trust has got to be fully in
[47:04] him because he's going to require of you
[47:06] to walk by faith right Mark the 11th
[47:09] chapter will say have faith in God we've
[47:12] got to walk by faith now if we could see
[47:15] every step if we could see if it was
[47:17] paint by numbers or paint by color or
[47:19] whatever they call it we we would be
[47:20] able to see what's coming but God
[47:22] requires the believer to walk by faith
[47:25] alone to take him at his word and to say
[47:27] he's not going to leave me out to dry
[47:29] he's not going to leave me hanging but
[47:31] he's going to come in my day of trouble
[47:33] he will be a soulless for me I believe
[47:36] the God we serve is more than able to
[47:38] overcome any circumstance that we're
[47:41] going through life any circumstance that
[47:42] we're going through in our mind but our
[47:44] trust has to be in his ability to
[47:47] overcome it not in my ability to to out
[47:50] preach the devil or your ability to out
[47:52] praise the devil or to outrun the devil
[47:54] you're never going to outrun him you're
[47:56] never going to out argue them you're
[47:57] never going to out talk them but your
[47:59] trust has got to be in the one that is
[48:02] already overcame him
[48:04] we've been given a promise in this hour
[48:06] that we would be a Rapture Ready bride
[48:09] that we would be the Fulfillment of
[48:11] these things that were prophesied our
[48:13] trust is not in our ability to do it our
[48:16] trust is in that heat already paid the
[48:18] price for us to go through into that
[48:20] Victory we are his victory I think that
[48:23] should be a fridge quote that everybody
[48:25] should have on their windshield we are
[48:27] the victory of Christ we are the reason
[48:30] he died we are the reason he gave his
[48:32] life we are the reason he took a cross
[48:35] We Are The Reason by his stripes he paid
[48:38] for our healing we are the reason that
[48:41] he said not my will but thine be done O
[48:44] Lord you see the self-sacrifice he had
[48:46] to put his trust in his own word
[48:49] my will but thine be done my that's the
[48:53] hardest thing for us to do is to say not
[48:54] what I want or not what I think or not
[48:56] the direction that I want to lean to but
[48:58] let Thy word have the preeminence in my
[49:01] life that is what God is requiring from
[49:04] us in this time we're not going to make
[49:06] it by any other way we've got to look
[49:08] only at the word it's got to strike the
[49:11] lens it's got to be the right anointing
[49:13] in the right time the right season we
[49:15] are walking in a perfect Prophet a
[49:18] prophet's age under a perfect prophecy
[49:20] we aren't perfect people
[49:22] but not in our own ability in whom we
[49:25] have put our trust he is perfect in all
[49:28] his ways lean not unto thy own
[49:30] understanding but put your trust in him
[49:32] they that know the name of their God put
[49:36] their trust in him I'm thankful that
[49:37] we're not curious about who God is
[49:40] we have more information about God than
[49:43] any religion has ever had throughout
[49:45] history we're not curious about who God
[49:47] is or what he has in store for us but we
[49:50] know who we're putting our trust in we
[49:53] know all about it we can we can recite
[49:55] the Ten Commandments from just a little
[49:56] child and we can tell you all the ins
[49:58] and outs of the scripture we know the
[50:00] character of God and his character is to
[50:03] be a refuge his character is to be a
[50:06] savior his character is to be a redeemer
[50:08] his characters to be a Healer his
[50:10] character is to save the lost and heal
[50:13] the sick and go after the broken that's
[50:15] the character of the God we're putting
[50:17] our trust in we're not putting our trust
[50:19] in somebody that might do it or maybe
[50:21] has the power to do it but we know our
[50:24] God
[50:25] and they that know their gods shall do
[50:27] exploits in his name they trust in him
[50:31] I would say trust in him
[50:34] there's nowhere else that I want to put
[50:36] my trust we've already been spoken for
[50:38] to overcome in this age
[50:40] the devil would like to tell me that I'm
[50:42] not gonna make it that I'm not gonna
[50:44] overcome but I'm not putting my trust in
[50:46] what the devil said brother Paul I'm
[50:48] putting my trust in him who already
[50:51] overcame who said I would make it who
[50:53] said that I would be an overcomer who
[50:55] said that I would take his word in
[50:57] fullness in this hour when I read that
[51:00] that quote and it says you were
[51:01] predestined to receive him in this age I
[51:04] put mine in there I put my trust in that
[51:07] when I read out of the church age book
[51:09] that says she will be a perfect bride
[51:12] she will be an invincible Army I put my
[51:15] name next to that quote I put my trust
[51:18] in him who I know
[51:20] remember brother Bosworth would say uh
[51:22] brother Brandon would would speak highly
[51:24] of brother Bosworth and he would say
[51:25] that uh uh don't put trust in your
[51:28] doubts for their unreliable
[51:33] but trust your faith
[51:35] put your trust in God
[51:37] don't rely on your doubts tomorrow you
[51:40] might have a doubt about something else
[51:41] tomorrow you might be questioning about
[51:42] another direction or if you get down
[51:44] that trail with the devil he'll have you
[51:46] questioning about your your own name and
[51:48] you won't even know where you were born
[51:49] but trust in the one thing that we know
[51:52] that there is a God and he is for me
[51:54] think about David going through his
[51:56] trials and there he was in a cave
[51:58] writing these Psalms in the dark and and
[52:00] persecuted on every side and there he
[52:02] was anointed to be the king of the land
[52:04] but he was forced into it came by his
[52:07] own character he could have taken Saul
[52:09] at any time but by the character of
[52:11] Christ in him he said I will not take
[52:13] him until it's time
[52:15] thank you
[52:16] and David writing these Psalms
[52:19] in the in the middle of despair
[52:21] now it's easy for us to praise the Lord
[52:23] when when the when when it's the last
[52:26] service of our meetings and the Saturday
[52:28] night and and the Lord's just Sweeping
[52:30] in the anointings here and
[52:32] but it's a lot harder to praise him on a
[52:35] Tuesday evening when you're by yourself
[52:37] and there's despair on every side
[52:39] and there's there's your enemies
[52:40] seemingly uniting against you and and in
[52:43] your mind even you might feel trapped
[52:45] and you think how am I ever going to get
[52:46] out of this situation that's when we're
[52:49] Overcomers that's when we praise the
[52:51] Lord that's when you reach down deep and
[52:53] you realize who your trust is in your
[52:55] trust is not in the church your trust is
[52:58] Not In a Pulpit your trust is not in a
[53:00] pastor or a Pew or a a microphone your
[53:03] trust is in him who will not leave you
[53:06] nor forsake you there's going to be
[53:08] moments in time when you can't get a
[53:10] hold of mama there's gonna be moments in
[53:12] time when you can't get a hold of your
[53:13] daddy or you can't get a hold of Pastor
[53:15] you've got to know where your trust is
[53:18] in it's in him who said he would never
[53:20] leave me he would never forsake me and
[53:23] he already told me that I will overcome
[53:25] on the other side I see a dark shadow
[53:28] over you coming into this prayer line
[53:29] but I see you healed on the other side
[53:31] he already spoke a word over his bride
[53:34] we've just got a follow in step with
[53:36] that our trust is in his word
[53:38] our trust is in what he's already
[53:40] promised us it's not based upon our
[53:43] worthiness
[53:45] he thought you were worth it enough to
[53:48] give his worthiness for it
[53:49] oh brother bam says oh I'm not excited I
[53:52] know exactly where I'm standing I know
[53:54] exactly what I'm talking about oh if I
[53:56] could only express my feelings if I
[53:58] could only tell this audience what it
[53:59] really means to be setting under the
[54:01] anointing of this rock Christ Jesus
[54:02] already paid for your judgment Warrior
[54:05] sickness took your sorrow and settled
[54:07] the question before God are you scared
[54:10] to put your trust in him
[54:13] that's the question the prophet asked
[54:15] are you scared to put your trust in him
[54:19] you don't have to be judged you don't
[54:20] have to think you're self-worthy you'll
[54:22] never be worthy but Christ was worthy in
[54:25] your stead that paid the price not
[54:27] trying to redeem something you can't
[54:29] redeem it because you ain't got the
[54:30] money to but God had the money and he
[54:34] sent Christ and settled the bill and
[54:36] redeemed you from your sickness and your
[54:38] sorrows and your worry and your sin and
[54:41] your backsliding he sent the money which
[54:43] was Christ Jesus and deposited it on
[54:46] Calvary on galgotha's hill and tonight
[54:48] every one of you is free if you'll just
[54:52] believe it now to me I think we can take
[54:54] that quote to the bank tonight every one
[54:57] of you is free from your disparity if
[55:00] you'll just believe that he already paid
[55:02] the price
[55:03] my God to think that we would we would
[55:06] somehow diminish the value of Christ's
[55:08] Sacrifice by by looking it through our
[55:11] own lands or what we're worthy of or how
[55:13] we feel that we can do this but it's not
[55:15] by your own worth it's by putting your
[55:18] trust in him that paid the price already
[55:20] for you he already overcame the
[55:23] circumstance that you're in but the man
[55:24] would say you just can't lose when you
[55:26] become a Christian I love this quote
[55:28] just can't lose just trust in him and
[55:32] whatever the way it goes just keep your
[55:34] sales set to his Spirit he will guide
[55:36] you into the harbor it'll all be all
[55:39] right thank you
[55:41] I don't know I know but sometimes it's
[55:45] good to hear the words it'll all be all
[55:47] right you know sometimes we get so
[55:49] worried about what's going to happen in
[55:50] this situation or what's going to happen
[55:52] and then what about and what about and
[55:54] what about sometimes you just need to
[55:56] hear a sure word of Prophecy saying
[55:58] it'll all be all right just put your
[56:01] trust in him it'll all work out you'll
[56:04] come out on top just put your trust in
[56:07] the one thing that cannot Fail You I
[56:09] Will Fail you your own self will fail
[56:12] you but put your trust in the one thing
[56:14] that will not fail amen it's never
[56:17] failed it's never lost it's never
[56:19] retreated he's never had to back up on
[56:21] his word he's never had to change his
[56:22] mind about a thought he will come
[56:25] through he will be there in the time of
[56:28] trouble in your day of trouble he's
[56:30] there and your time when you feel like
[56:32] you're all alone and there's nobody
[56:33] around to hear you he's there when you
[56:36] feel like nobody knows the anguish and
[56:38] the pain that you're going through he's
[56:40] there
[56:41] trust in him who has never left you even
[56:44] when you were running as hard as you
[56:46] could from him he never left you he was
[56:49] there all the time
[56:51] waiting patiently alive my what a God we
[56:55] serve to think that he would come down
[56:57] for us you know the devil spends a lot
[56:59] of time telling us how unworthy we we
[57:01] are and it's true but it just makes me
[57:03] appreciate my God that much more to
[57:06] think that he would come for a sinner
[57:08] like me to think that he would come for
[57:10] for a slothful person like me slow in
[57:12] faith and weak of heart but God would
[57:14] come and give me a revelation in this
[57:17] hour that I will take a body change and
[57:20] I will be gone in the moment of a
[57:22] twinkling of an eye to think that God
[57:24] came down delivered that personal
[57:25] revelation to you my despite what the
[57:29] devil's already put on you
[57:31] but God thought you were worth it
[57:33] put your trust in him who will not leave
[57:36] you
[57:41] [Music]
[57:46] the man would say
[57:48] I never try to trust my own wisdom
[57:50] because I have none I'm so glad that I
[57:53] do not if I had some maybe I would try
[57:55] to trust in it but the Lord just seemed
[57:57] fit that I didn't have any so I just
[57:59] have to trust in him and I believe it
[58:01] would be good if we all just tried that
[58:03] a while don't you think somebody say
[58:05] Amen just don't take your own ideas
[58:08] about a thing but rest solemnly upon
[58:10] thus saith the Lord don't try to reason
[58:13] it because you can't reason it if you
[58:15] can reason it out and see just exactly
[58:18] how it's going to be it would not be an
[58:20] Act of Faith anymore
[58:22] right don't try to reason it out but
[58:25] walk by faith he's never left us he'll
[58:28] never forsake us trust in his word that
[58:31] he's going to see us it'll all work out
[58:33] it'll all be okay the message shalomi
[58:35] would say look up and shine with the joy
[58:37] of the Lord to know that you've been
[58:39] privileged your eyes have come open and
[58:42] see this day trust in him for the future
[58:45] you've seen him vindicate his word in
[58:47] days past he that Vindicated his word in
[58:50] days past and made all these other
[58:51] things happen just exactly to the hour
[58:53] that we're living everything exactly to
[58:56] the seventh Angels message both showed
[58:58] it in heaven and in Earth and made it
[58:59] known three ways so there would be no
[59:01] slip up remember he promised he'd come
[59:04] again Hallelujah that word will be a
[59:06] Vindicated God's promised word with 2
[59:10] 000 years of waiting he will arrive on
[59:13] time
[59:14] somebody say all the time
[59:16] he will arrive on time don't be weary
[59:20] he'll be there
[59:22] my
[59:24] how many times have we gotten weary
[59:26] wondering if the Lord knows where we're
[59:28] at wondering if the Lord knows the
[59:29] circumstance we're going through and the
[59:31] conversation that we just have with the
[59:33] prophet of God through the spirit of
[59:35] discernment would see you in your
[59:36] situation and he would say don't be
[59:38] weary he'll be there he will arrive
[59:42] right on time he's never been late for
[59:45] an appointment but he's always right on
[59:47] time
[59:48] so we say all time oh he's an on-time
[59:52] God yes he is he may not come when you
[59:55] want him to but he'll always be there
[59:57] right on time he's an on-time God he
[1:00:01] knows your circumstance he knows the
[1:00:03] situation you're in he knows the battle
[1:00:04] you're fighting and he'll be there right
[1:00:07] on time
[1:00:08] don't worry he'll be there to think
[1:00:11] about it if we could just realize who we
[1:00:14] are in this time in this generation in
[1:00:16] this age we would be an invincible Army
[1:00:19] if we would just recognize where our
[1:00:21] help comes from our help does not come
[1:00:23] from brother so and so or Apostle
[1:00:25] so-and-so or pre-so and so our help
[1:00:27] coming from the Lord and my trust is in
[1:00:30] him who will not leave me nor forsake me
[1:00:33] nor cast me down nor forget about me nor
[1:00:36] no not know where I'm going or the steps
[1:00:39] I'm taking he's right there with you at
[1:00:42] all times now think about it like if if
[1:00:45] we were in a fight brother Paul
[1:00:48] and I had you at my side
[1:00:50] I'd be a little more bold
[1:00:53] you know if if me and Brian got an
[1:00:55] exchange I might not be as bold but with
[1:00:57] you on my side
[1:00:59] it's two verse one
[1:01:01] I mean brother Paul we can take on the
[1:01:03] world
[1:01:04] but you see one of Paul's not there
[1:01:06] then I feel alone
[1:01:08] and I feel that it's just me going
[1:01:10] through the battle you know when I was a
[1:01:12] kid I had an older brother and as long
[1:01:13] as older brother was there any of my
[1:01:15] friends my age older brother could take
[1:01:17] care of them
[1:01:19] older brother could take care of them
[1:01:21] and as long as he was there the
[1:01:23] confidence was there you can run your
[1:01:26] mouth and you could do what you wanted
[1:01:27] and you could you could pick fights and
[1:01:29] you could as long as older brother was
[1:01:31] there
[1:01:32] you know then you grow up a little bit
[1:01:33] and we we used to play basketball a lot
[1:01:35] and as long as Jamal was there we'll
[1:01:38] take your team up he can dunk
[1:01:41] but then one time Jamal doesn't show up
[1:01:43] for a game
[1:01:44] and you've done talked your trash
[1:01:50] but you see how confident we are when we
[1:01:52] know we've got backup
[1:01:54] but see when the Devil comes to us we
[1:01:57] feel like we're all alone we feel like
[1:01:58] it's just us and him on the court and
[1:02:00] it's us and him
[1:02:02] but we've got to recognize where our
[1:02:04] trust is my trust is not in my ability
[1:02:07] to defeat the Devil my trust is in in
[1:02:10] the ability that I have to surrender
[1:02:12] myself to he who has already defeated
[1:02:14] the devil he is with you even in you in
[1:02:17] the time of trouble when you're standing
[1:02:19] Toe to Toe with the devil you don't have
[1:02:21] to wait for Big Brother to show up he's
[1:02:23] already there he's already standing
[1:02:25] behind you he's already in the fight
[1:02:27] he's already on your side and he's
[1:02:30] Mighty in battle
[1:02:31] he's never lost one and with that you
[1:02:33] know it used to be when your little your
[1:02:35] friend might might come up against you
[1:02:36] and he'd be real tough until he saw Big
[1:02:38] Brother behind you
[1:02:41] before you know it he's backing up and
[1:02:42] before you know he's running away now if
[1:02:44] you didn't see the Big Brother behind
[1:02:45] you might think you did it
[1:02:47] but you see the devil is exactly the
[1:02:49] same kind of coward when he sees that
[1:02:52] blood when he sees that blood that
[1:02:54] already defeated him that ripped his
[1:02:57] stinger out of him that ripped every
[1:02:58] victory that he had out of him he will
[1:03:01] tuck his tail and run every time we just
[1:03:04] have to resist the devil and he will
[1:03:06] flee right James would say uh submit
[1:03:09] yourselves therefore to God resist the
[1:03:12] devil and he will flee from you not
[1:03:15] maybe flee resist the devil and he will
[1:03:18] flee
[1:03:19] once the devil sees you're not giving up
[1:03:22] he'll tuck his tail and he'll Run for
[1:03:25] the hills why because he knows that he's
[1:03:28] already been defeated by the one that
[1:03:31] you're trusting in where your trust is
[1:03:33] anchored he's already been cast down
[1:03:35] he's already been overcome he's already
[1:03:37] been kicked out he knows that he hasn't
[1:03:40] got the goods to overcome that but he
[1:03:42] wants to see if you know it he'll take
[1:03:45] as much ground as you can give him he'll
[1:03:47] take it he'll take every possession that
[1:03:49] you'll let him have he'll he'll take
[1:03:51] every Victory from you that you'll give
[1:03:53] over to him but I say in this time in
[1:03:55] this hour it's time to draw a line and
[1:03:58] say not one more inch devil I'm not
[1:04:00] giving up one more inch of my ground I'm
[1:04:02] not giving up one more inch of my
[1:04:03] household of my faith of my victory of
[1:04:06] my overcoming life I will take it back
[1:04:08] by force we must resist the devil and he
[1:04:12] will flee now this word resist means to
[1:04:14] withstand the force or effect of so it
[1:04:17] does not mean that she won't be hit
[1:04:19] it means that you have enough to
[1:04:21] withstand the force or effect of what
[1:04:23] the devil is bringing against you when
[1:04:25] she recognizes who she is she will be an
[1:04:29] invincible Army Invincible does not mean
[1:04:31] immune from Attack Invincible means that
[1:04:34] you're greater than whatever attack can
[1:04:36] come against you I say as a Church of
[1:04:38] the Living God we are greater than
[1:04:40] whatever the enemy can throw against us
[1:04:42] because we know where our trust is he
[1:04:46] that is in me is greater than he that is
[1:04:48] in the world our trust is in him that
[1:04:51] will not leave us
[1:04:53] it will not forsake us we can withstand
[1:04:56] anything that the devil throws against
[1:04:57] us why because it's him on the inside
[1:05:00] it's it's him in her doing the Greater
[1:05:03] Works my goodness
[1:05:06] I don't believe that a person just
[1:05:07] happened to be here by chance now just
[1:05:10] think when you come to the world
[1:05:11] everything had to be for prepared for
[1:05:13] you or pre-prepared rather for you I
[1:05:15] don't hardly understand
[1:05:17] that how we that we could think that a
[1:05:19] God that could prepare all these good
[1:05:21] things for us
[1:05:23] listen to this
[1:05:25] to think that a God that could prepare
[1:05:28] all these good things for us
[1:05:30] and we could not put trust in him
[1:05:33] that if he brought us in this chaos that
[1:05:35] we're in now and prepared the good
[1:05:36] things of life for us here how much more
[1:05:39] can we trust him to prepare the things
[1:05:41] that is to come see the Eternal things
[1:05:43] yes it seems very strange brother babe
[1:05:46] said how we can put our trust in him
[1:05:48] that he put us in this age
[1:05:50] but then we fail to put our trust in him
[1:05:52] that he's going to see us out of this
[1:05:54] age that he's going to see us out of the
[1:05:55] chaos that were in a of the destruction
[1:05:57] that our life has maybe become he will
[1:06:00] see you through you've got to recognize
[1:06:02] where your trust is some men trust in
[1:06:04] chariots some men trust in horses but I
[1:06:08] trust in the Lord my God who has never
[1:06:10] failed me he's never backed up he's
[1:06:13] never retreated he is mighty in battle
[1:06:15] if our trust is in him he will do the he
[1:06:19] will do the slaying for us we've just
[1:06:21] got to show up and collect the spoils my
[1:06:23] trust is in that kind of God my trust is
[1:06:25] in the kind of God that when we come in
[1:06:27] here on a Thursday night we sing the the
[1:06:30] songs of Zion and we say Here I Am to
[1:06:32] Worship here I am to bow down my trust
[1:06:35] is in the god that will come down and
[1:06:37] inhabit the praise of his people and
[1:06:39] while he's inhabiting that praise he's
[1:06:41] also taking care of the situation that's
[1:06:43] in your life he's taking care of the
[1:06:45] suicide demon he's taking care of that
[1:06:48] anxiety that you're fighting he's taking
[1:06:50] care of that that blood pressure issue
[1:06:52] he's taking care of the issues you're
[1:06:54] fighting in life while he's inhabiting
[1:06:56] the Praises of them that trust in him
[1:06:59] that's the God we serve he didn't come
[1:07:02] just out with no ammunition in his gun
[1:07:04] but he showed up because he's Mighty in
[1:07:07] battle
[1:07:07] every devil runs when they recognize the
[1:07:10] anointing of our God am I to think we
[1:07:12] don't have to wait on a big brother to
[1:07:13] come but he's already come my message is
[1:07:17] to clear he is here living amongst his
[1:07:20] bride fighting on her side he is
[1:07:23] fighting for us

[1:07:27] fighting we just got to put our trust in
[1:07:29] him he will take care of it
[1:07:32] don't weary
[1:07:33] he's an on time God my that's hard for
[1:07:36] us
[1:07:37] but it's true he's an on time God and

[1:08:34] faith can take his holy stand on the
[1:08:36] Rock of Ages and Pierce an Eagle Eye

[1:10:09] substance of things hoped for the
[1:10:11] evidence of things not seen by it the
[1:10:13] elders obtained a good report we
[1:10:14] understand that the world was made out
[1:10:16] of things that does not appear how God
[1:10:19] before there was even an earth here just
[1:10:21] spoke the word and dust and dirt and
[1:10:23] rocks and corrosions come into existence
[1:10:25] because God said I can see his word
[1:10:27] flying from his lips going out that in
[1:10:30] that Darkness Yonder and the atoms begin
[1:10:33] to break and the world come into
[1:10:34] existence that same God
[1:10:37] somebody say the same God

[1:10:57] heart that Jesus is going to make them

[1:11:05] Jesus has promised it and he's good to
[1:11:08] his promise granted father take away all
[1:11:11] the gloom and doubt and let the Holy
[1:11:13] Ghost Reign supremely heal everyone and
[1:11:16] save everyone for we ask it in Christ's
[1:11:19] name amen and now if that same spirit
[1:11:23] that was upon him to be the Redeemer in
[1:11:25] that age that we have accepted now the
[1:11:28] promise in this last day that would take
[1:11:30] place if you become part of that word
[1:11:34] you are redeemed with him because the
[1:11:37] same spirit that dwelt in Christ is
[1:11:39] dwelling in you quickening your life to
[1:11:42] this age and it'll also in the end time
[1:11:44] Quicken your mortal bodies resurrect
[1:11:47] them bring them up again that takes the
[1:11:49] Gloom away when we look at that and that
[1:11:51] is the truth amen
[1:11:55] direct quotes from a prophet there's no
[1:11:58] there's more no more sure source that we
[1:12:00] could go to than direct quotes from a
[1:12:02] prophet of God to tell us
