jesus lord your everything to us you're our master [Music] you're our savior my sweet jesus oh god how we thank you in this moment lord lord jesus lord just ask these next few moments lord as we just step aside lord the toils of the day knowing that lord that this is lord what's most important father things that god that transpire and take place right here in these moments can affect the outcome of things that we're thinking on for tomorrow lord questions we have oh father will you just come lord speak to our hearts tonight minister to every life according to what lord thee would have need of lord lord you see each of our needs lord my need and the need among the congregation tonight lord we just invite you that you would come and be the speaker tonight lord anoint our ears to hear lord father we want to give ourselves to you lord unreserved we ask that you'll just come in a special way tonight tonight amen just the worship i just certainly appreciate each and every one of you just so good so good to see you amen i just i love coming i love coming to the house of god and seeing god's people amen i love you i just appreciate you just such a a moment you know just just to step aside just to be encouraged in the things of the lord tonight i want to just look here in matthew chapter 6 and i want to just continue to look at prayer at the thought that we were looking at and we've been dealing with some things as the lord has been just directing us in some of the sunday services as well but i want to just go here tonight back into that same thought on prayer is prayer is in matthew chapter 6 verse 5 hear the lord jesus it says when thou prayest thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men verily i say unto you they have their reward but thou when thou prayest enter into thy closet when thou has shut thy door pray to thy father which is in secret thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly i'd like to just read that verse again when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut the door pray to the father which is in secret thy father which seeth in secret shall reward thee bless the reading of the word as you're being seated tonight i want to read hero from a quote of the message of blind bartimaeus and we just to lay this a little background of things that we'll kind of look at here tonight graham said you know there's something about getting along to yourself many people never pray until they come to church many people think that's the only place to pray is a church the bible said for men to pray everywhere lifting up holy hands then when we get by ourselves we'll usually pray different than when we would if we prayed in the church it's the secret prayer that jesus spoke of saying enter ye into a secret closet and close the door when you have did so pray to your father who sees in secret he that seeth in secret shall reward the opening and when we're praying like that there seems to be something to the prayer that takes all the hypocrisy out of it it seems like that we get in a better connection with god to get along there's been many times in my life as perhaps in your life that you just have to get alone once in a while with jesus now let me just pause here a moment in just reading this we realize and i that as we have made a statement and we experienced this there's times that i can tell you of just just whether i've come out of the presence of the law just been studying things sometimes it just it's just things you just begin to meditate on and it doesn't matter where i'm at i had him visit me and you have to i trust whether you've been right in the store maybe you've been on the job and his presence will come to your life and it just overwhelms you that's a moment between you and the lord because i want you to see this here here when we look at this that it's it's even in those times those are precious times and those times are they they don't take away from the times of us getting alone where we have to make a decision and get a loan just as much as those times where we have to meditate on the things of god and i don't want to say the words have to but to recognize the privilege it is to meditate on the things of god as a matter of fact god some of the very instructions that he gave to joshua in the opening chapter was to meditate on those things and you know meditation is part of prayer as well meditation is part we're taking the word you begin to think on that word and brother bran tells us and we're witnesses of that i am and i know you are as well where the presence of god will just sweep by our life and it's just something so precious about that in meditating on the things of god how god will come by and he'll open things to our life and we know that in this time that you and i are in that satan has every ploy and every trap of everything that he can do to try to ensnare our meditation or in other words have our minds so occupied upon other things because he knows the power of that of meditation in the things of god and i want to just say it in this manner that as we're looking at this in prayer brother branham made this statement and let me reread that he says it seems like that we get in a better connection with god to get alone and there's many times in my life as perhaps in your life that you just have to get alone once in a while with jesus i took my car and drove down the road and just studying and after i got to the highway where it was free or off on some country road till i would become so filled with his mercies and goodness until i i just stopped the car and held the will and wept like a baby he said that's being alone many times i've climbed up in the mountains where every man thought everyone that was with me that i was going hunting i'd go up there and sit down on a rock and just look up to the sky until looked like that my whole innermost being become filled with something that you could just feel everything of the world seemed to pass away for those precious hours along with god and it's there that when the great revelation and inspiration comes is when we're alone with god we take more time on that i'm sure that we live a better life and more victorious life in christ if you've been filled with the spirit of god you have received of the victory of calvary you've received of the victory of the resurrection there's been a triumphing in our life we have experienced of that same life of the mighty conqueror manifesting himself in our life above every sin above unbelief to where our lives have been illuminated by his victory and our lives daily express his victory we were people who were once bound but we've been set free we've been delivered because it wasn't my victory it's accepting that victory and that victory has come to me and brought me into that victory but then to think that the privilege now what's afforded to you and i is that our lives can be lived in such a victorious way if we just have these times alone with god all right see this is why when you begin to realize why the devil will battle everything right he'll battle prayer the most i hope you hope you're with me now i'm going to go to some places here tonight it's not that it's not that he he he he minds about you reading the word but he'll battle you most when it comes to prayer that's where he sets his targets that's where he sets his guns now i want you to think of this scripture if we can if i read that scripture once again in matthew chapter 6 and verse 6 when thou prayest enter into this is now the responsibility this comes to the worshipper for you and i to enter that means to enter means we leave one and go into another we're leaving one place and going into another now let me just say to enter in and then to close notice shut the door this comes to you and i and sometimes the place of trying to enter in and close the door sometimes your we have so many thoughts about us so many things going on around in our life but the very thing that we have need of to make sense of everything else and deal with everything in life is to enter in into prayer amen amen is to enter in and shut the door god won't enter in for us god won't shut the door for us we have to do that and notice pray to the father which is in secret showing that you and i have a privilege by an access to come into his presence let me say this to you tonight as as believers of this end time message that have been born of the spirit of god to recognize of what this message has brought you and i too to a place of access before the throne of almighty god that you and i might come with boldness it's because of the redeeming work of the blood of the lamb that deals with sin in our life it deals with condemnation it takes away all the things that are between us and god to bring us back into fellowship with god once again that's the privilege we have amen in the presence of almighty god that we can stand there in his presence with a real confidence oh my so to enter in it's to go into it's to shut it's to close check and shut things off to close it off once you think how paul would write this many places we could speak about this access that we have but i'm just going to read a few places brother bradley or paul tells us in romans 5 1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of god so it is by the lord jesus christ it is by the holy spirit it is by the word that we have access unto god amen now notice as it writes in song of solomon chapter 2 verse 14. here is the bridegroom speaking to the bride amen oh my god that first part right there it speaks of a confidence an undefiledness a blamelessness oh my god he's seeing his own life reflected in the bride oh my dove thou art in the class of the rock the secret places of the stairs stairs speak of access this dove has access into the presence of almighty god privileges that you and i have been afforded by almighty god amen notice let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice so first he wants to look upon our countenance our person our face you know why because it's been his very countenance his very person that has brought a change in our countenance he wants to behold himself so don't be in a hurry let me just let me just look on you amen let me see your accountant don't don't get in such a hurry let me see your countenance and then let me hear your voice oh my gosh let me hear you that voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is come it's his redeeming work now think brother branham said it like this in the message supernatural prayer is not a perhaps prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to god prayer is not get down and shut your eyes and thinking about your washing or your work you're doing say lord help me and john and he'll miss jones and so forth that's not prayer that's repeating some words now every one of us can identify with this and we don't have to go back in the past this is a battleground i said this is a battleground right here so the word the holy spirit speaking through the prophet is not condemning us but he's letting us know you're not going into the full access right there's a lot of things on your mind and you might be spending time in prayer but you're really not getting anywhere or really getting into prayer there's just so much that you are thinking about now watch watch how the wisdom of the holy spirit how to combat this because if you left right now or clicked off right now you just say well there's just no hope no what's the wisdom of god at work here david said teach my hands to all right is that right i'm gonna fight a battle gotta fight a war then teach my hands to war teach me how to battle this because we are all faced with the cares of this life we are all faced with the burdens of this life sometimes the things we're looking at and trying to make sense of her how's this going to be burdens that we carry and you can't escape that i can't escape that we can't just go live in a monastery somewhere or you know just go in some community and live in some park and sing kumbaya every night we can't do that we rub shoulders with the world every day is that right we have things we have to attend to every day in our life as much as you would you know you and i like it and even for myself as a minister of the gospel i realize that i have more time i'm recountable and responsible to give myself to prayer into reading but there's also natural things of life that i have to attend to there's a cares in the church i have to attend to and yet with all of those things that god that you and i can fellowship over or experience we we sense this part of how there's things that can come to want to bombard our lives but the holy spirit is letting us know that's not prayer yes but here's the encouragement are you hearing me you know just sometimes you don't just click out this is real teaching coming right down to where meek goes on the bones but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you're in the presence of god and you're moving to them in the deepest of sincerity now what's the battle plan here first it's a worship o jehovah how i love you amen hallelujah your time in prayer let me just let's just say lay it out in a time frame let's just say if it's an hour you might have to worship 45 minutes well brother samuel but if i've got all that in my mind i don't feel like worshiping it's called a sacrifice of praise you're worshiping not about how you feel you're worshiping him amen right come on now i would just say it like this i'm not gonna worship my feelings i'm not going to worship my thoughts i'm not going to worship my doubts i'm not going to worship those things i'm going to worship almighty god i'm going to thank him for what he's done i'm going to thank him for where he brought me from i'm going to thank him for his blood that's why brother adam can tell us if you want the holy spirit to come in a service sing songs about the blood amen oh how much more inside of a time of prayer you begin to fellowship about health it was on the road to emmaus that they were talking about him amen they didn't understand what was going on as a matter of fact they thought he that he didn't fulfill what was said about the redeemer but what it was they were talking about it and he drew near how much more is a child of god that's been redeemed by the blood of the lamb that knows the grace of god that can talk about the goodness of god how much more will he not come to you amen blessed be the name of the lord yes oh my hold to come into an atmosphere so first worship old jehovah how i love you you might have to put on some music put on some music and many times i pray with music on instrumental music right matter of fact i probably got as much intermittent mental music because i got other music and i got a lot of music but it's very important we're talking about a battle plan amen come on now we're we're the children of god we have not been made to walk as the tale we have been made the head amen taking our authority in our position we're talking about sons and daughters of god coming into manifestation then we have to take our authority in these little things for him that the thou has been faithful in little things i will make thee ruler over greater than amen amen is that right we don't despise the day of small things amen amen oh my it's worship o jehovah how i love you you see it then after the worship of prayer then you come with a sincere heart asking yes amen he said if you abide in me and not go out from behind the curtains in the world today and run around and try to get back in the curtains tonight if you abide in me and my words abiding you otherwise if you're like aaron's rod that's pulled up to the shekinah glory by the golden pot of manna i want them and i just want to emphasize this here i'm going somewhere otherwise if you're like aaron's rod that's pulled up to the shekinah glory by the golden pot of manna where you can eat at any time and your soul is refreshed and blooming and yielding your abiding if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will it will be given to you amen i just wanted to remind you remind us the manner that fell that manner as it fell and came down upon the dew the manna they were together a certain amount and partake of that manna there for the day that was their food god provided them it was a heavenly food it wasn't earthly it came down from heaven amen so they had a need and god already had everything covered right now that manna remember god told moses when that manna fell the very first morning he told him go get an omer and i want you to take of that manna and i want you to put it in that golden omer and when you take that i want you then to take that golden armor and i want you to take it and place it into the holiest of holiness there before the ark now let me say this it wasn't the manna itself that made the difference it was the place the manna was right you see this is why as we've looked and some months ago and really narrowing that down the holy ghost is a holy ghost it's the manna of god but the holy spirit can fall upon our flesh and that's all it does after a period of time that experience rots away and gone it can come upon our spirit right is that right and stimulate intellectually and and you say intellectually intellectually if you study the word it means emotional too we believe in being emotional but emotional is not what i i don't preach it but i believe that you understand so we recognize that there's got to come a falling of that manna inside of the soul or rather that which will change that life to where that life is no longer the same you wouldn't matter what goes on inside of that life it doesn't matter they're a christian from that day forward trials can come tests can come but they're a christian from that day forward i mean a believer tests and trials can come in other words the manna never gets more meat why because of the place that it is so it matters the place where the manner is now where the place where the manor was that manna was kept that every priest every man that entered into the of the priesthood could come back into there and take and be a partaker of that original manner that felt which is a type of the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost amen that god has provided not a lesser experience but the same experience of the holy ghost that they had and let me tell you if it acted that way in the book of acts it'll act that same way right here you know you can't change it it'll produce the same answer how can a man be filled with the holy clothes and not full of the joy of almighty god you might run you might shout you might but one thing about it your life will be different from that moment on because there's manna that's come to the innermost place in your life you've got to reserve an original manner a life that's holding there now with that thought think about in our lives where we live in a three-room house body spirit right and so brother branham i'm just going to refer to this i'm not going to ask you to read it with me i'm just going to refer to this but brother adam would we deal with how within the three courts you come into the outer court there's a preaching of the word that's called the kitchen right and brother brand will tell us i want you to catch the things he's saying here he said that ministering of the word is not only for the sinner but it's for the holy ghost believer too so we all even though when a life has passed into the holiest of holies by the new birth you still have to come to the kitchen to eat and that's why brother man said the church is for the preaching of the gospel of jesus christ not only does it bring conviction to the sinner and open up the way for the journey into the holiest of holies but that word is also that you and i might be sustained might be fed might be encouraged might be helped in our journey so we all have to make visits to the kitchen amen and just by looking in the natural we know where it's at in our house i don't think there's any question there now after the kitchen you have the party right the parlor or brother would call it sometimes the sitting room or when you and i might call it the living room anyhow the place where you sit down in some comfortable chairs so it's a little bit more comfortable now into the fellowship of believers and fellowship with believers is very important amen let's say oh brother samuel you know i just get along fine with me in the lord that's good but don't be selfish you're part of the holy spirit that part in your life as a believer is to go with the rest of the bomb right amen is that right that's why we come together where paul would write for the saking forsaking not to assemble ourselves together as the manner of some are right is that right because it's coming together it ain't about me all right it ain't about you it's about the body right amen you see when we live our lives for ourselves we live a selfish life right i'm talking about the parlor a time of fellowship we need fellowship with one another is that right fellowship the bible tells us iron sharpeneth iron we need the fellowship you need that time of getting together it thrills my heart when i see in the congregation where lies and families and different ones getting together in fellowship that thrills my heart why because i know that is a promise in the word and it's necessary amen amen it's necessary it is a part of the body of jesus christ and anybody who misses that is missing an integral revelation of the body of jesus christ are you with me even as i read to you some months ago the very opening statement in the message shalom where brother adam commends the people right there when he preaches the first message shalom in the trailer park there and he commends him for doing what he said i see some of you have brought your lunches together so that you can stick around and have fellowship with one another he said oh that thrills me we need one another that's right is that right so we need the kitchen we need the fellowship of the saints of one another we need that right and and fellowship is there where it's a part where we are speaking back and forth with somebody and we are we not only are we encouraging but i want to be encouraged amen and sometimes it isn't necessarily we go and sit down with somebody else and say all right encourage me but i don't know how many times whether i've talked with you know calling somebody who's sick on the phone or or you know sitting down with a group of brothers and you know just something is said i'm not talking about somebody taking a text and preaching in fellowship i'm talking about just something that's sad that just encourages me and it ain't about maybe a deep revelation but to see the working of the spirit of god in another person's life brother that sets me on fire fellowship is necessary amen oh boy i'll tell you we could is this the stream is rolling right now it's the devil's duty to cut you off from fellowship that's right message thirsting for life brother brown tells us the hounds of hell he said it's after you it's trying to chase you down he said what it is when you get to feeling a little bit of indifference towards somebody or the body of jesus christ he said that's the hounds of hell trying to chase after you let me tell you something we're all going to experience hurt and we're not all going to think a lot that's what makes it a paradox that we can fellowship as brothers and sisters of light precious faith are you hearing me i know that i could sit down and i could talk with maybe uh you know a number of my buddies for a long and long enough time and you know there might be little points of difference i i can't think of any that would be right now but i can tell you there might be little things but that in itself is not going to hinder fellowship unless i let it right amen hurt can cause you to isolate yourself the devil's ploy and trap is to try to get something said and then what you end up doing is pulling yourself out and saying i don't want to get hurt again but the greatest place you can go is to god in prayer and recognize what that mortal said you're immortal too and there's been people you've offended people i've offended people you've heard and people offered but in all we need the grace of almighty god i say let us cast down and move back into the parlor and stop isolating ourselves away because you need all three courts you can't just live in the holiest of holies and say i ain't going out there to the holy place to fellowship you can't do that that's right amen are you hearing me you can't just say well i'm gonna live here i ain't going back out to the outer court the outer court is the kitchen where the preaching and the hearing of the word comes a lot packed in this like a little suitcase like this and ends up packing up but then brother graham tells us from the kitchen to the parlor now he says the bedroom is that place of rest after the toil of a weary day always alone in that room rested now i'm just going to tell a little something on myself and i don't care i i like taking a nap in a recliner on sunday afternoons but if you told me i had to sleep in a recliner i can't do it overnight i had to a couple times with my back but i don't like doing it i just can't i'm not one of them guys that just go like this and go to sleep it gets to that point let's just stay up i might as well just start listening and doing it it's it's just we're not gonna waste time but it's something about now i'm just saying this ain't something spiritual you're gonna go unquote but there's something about the bedroom it's a place in the bedroom that's made for rest right now i know they make all kinds of different bedrooms now i mean when we went to look at houses you know some years back and i got to looking at houses and things like that i looked at the people that were building the house i said the people that want to buy these houses must hate one another they looked at me and said well sir this one has so many square feet i said but your room's downstairs i said look at the rooms downstairs then upstairs i said the bedrooms got their own living rooms and things in them i said people look like they hate one another and want to get away from one oh i see what it is sir you're a communal person i said i don't know what you're gonna what that means i said but i know this right here the bedroom is pinned in to have a living room up there right yeah are you hearing me so what i'm trying to get to is that a bedroom it's got a bed now you know we might have our dressers and everything else but the bedroom what's the purpose of the bedroom rest right and we need rest jesus said come unto me all you are heavy laden and weary and i will give you rest tapioca for your souls is that right amen the holy ghost is that rest that comes from god that brings a rest to a life to where we're no longer laboring under the load of sin are you hearing me tonight it brings a rest in our soul of peace with almighty god but to recognize that that is a place of rest we must have the kitchen we must have the parlor and we must have the place of rest they all work together in a christian life grant said i went into those old homes and i see the mothers they'll come out of the out of the bedroom with a little old checkered apron on wiping her eyes crying and praying it's a secret place a meeting place alone with god it's isolated oh he said the prayer room in my house he said is the bedroom and when a man ever takes his life out of these other places into that consecrated place with christ now think of this statement when a man ever takes his life out of these other places into that consecrated place with christ we have to go to those other places we we need let me just say very clearly we need to be feeding on the word amen we need to be feeding on the word because it's through feeding on the word that you can find things that god will begin to speak to our life it'll begin to put us in motion for things to pray about and to ask how we begin to see a reflection coming forth in our own life it's necessary the kitchen it's necessary of hearing the word of god let me just be very clear but if you're only coming to the kitchen and hearing the word and not going into the parlor and fellowshipping and then not going over into the place of rest you're missing it amen we have to take our lives out of these other places into that place this is not just a spiritual event that takes place although it is very it's the applicable part to that of the new birth but it's how we live in our lives whether we like it or not we have to we have to rule our own spirit right amen right the holy ghost doesn't do away with your human spirit right the holy ghost coming only does what nehemiah did in jerusalem it puts on the bars the gates the lots it puts that it keeps every gate in its rightful place but restores it under the rulership of the living god and under our charges sons and daughters of god right the fish gate was the fish gate the sheep gate was a sheep gate none of those gates change when nehemiah returned back to jerusalem but now there comes the right order the right things are coming through them they are built back up and that's why in our lives here with through our spirit sometimes oh my our spirit can get so weary our spirit can get so discouraged but you see this is where of entering in and shutting off the things of the world that holy place was a place where that where incense was offered up the prayer of incense everything tied together but it's to that veil when aaron would go into that holy place the veil would drop behind him it dropped and he was shut off it was a type of a life being shut off from the things of the world right there's there's one only one place that we can dwell to be shut off from the things of the world we all understand you can't do away with the things of the world as far as saying well i'm not going to worry about my job i'm not going to even i'm not going to go to work you don't go to work remember the bible said the man don't work he don't eat that's simple so paul was letting it be known no we got to go to work right oh brother say now i could be more spiritual if i didn't go to work no you can't you'll be as spiritual as your walk in god in the calling that god has called you in let every man abide in the calling wherein he was called amen is that right don't let the devil tell you that but you can make every use and every opportunity of every moment that you have that's right and i would say it like this there's things that sometimes we come into and we have to ask god teach us lord this is something new anybody ever been in of things where it comes about your life that all of a sudden you've got a routine and all of a sudden some things come in and oh there goes a routine and you know that routine being busted ain't a day thing it ain't a weak thing it ain't a month you don't know how long and you're looking at it now you can look at the routine and be defeated with it come on i'm preaching now you can look at that and say oh my goodness i got to get back to that instead of saying i got to get back to that this is only part of it say god help me within this allotment right here that i can live and walk in victory and extract from you lord and give myself to you of what you're calling for because you see what happens if satan can get us focused on the breaking of our routine then he's got us in a place we don't even have confidence to enter in prayer and that lack of confidence has nothing to do with sin it has everything to do with us feeling down about ourselves that's true oh my is to get shut off from the things of the world and to commune with him you know every one of us want to grow all right amen is that right i'll tell you what i i love reading quotes charles spurgeon you know i remember read charles virgin there his devotions and things like that powerful man i mean when they talked about charles purgin being a prince of preachers and things charles spurgeon was a man of prayer all right let me tell you something right now our prophet the messenger to this age was a man of prayer amen that's exactly right in me here's what charles spurgeon said no man can progress in grace if he forsakes prayer well i'm eating good in the kitchen but the eating in the kitchen is to give you strength to go to the park and in the parlor it ought to encourage you and they're you to take your life on over into that place of rest to get along with god you see as we look at this with time prayer itself let me just let me just try to bring this together here there's a quote that i've been reading to you and i've preached from this quote here uh a few services but i want to take a few words here in this quote we know that as the scripture has said that we read in matthew 6 6 that enter into the closet enter into that to that secret place in other words there's times where we do have to get along there's times as i said before that we've witnessed that where god has visited us i remember when i was teaching school even my goodness i'd have kids you know out here and we've been taking them into the restroom and things like that and i'd have to hey somebody go get my notepad over there i'm just sitting there writing notes and things just coming in that moment and sometimes in the middle of teaching i would just talk but i say that you've experienced that too but this is still the time that we have to take and get along with the lord is to see the value of it that's what i trust that god is just just just to rekindle and revisit some things in our life to see the value of it as a matter of fact brother branham would say it like this of that great thing that god has placed into the care of our hands prayer has been placed into our care jesus would get alone you know that from the scripture he would get alone go up into a mountain alone to pray jesus even when it came to the time in matthew 26 you read of getting ready to go to calvary he takes some with him is that right right but then he goes on up a little higher all right a little further i'll tell you none of us have come to a place like jesus came to at gethsemane spiritually i realized we have to die is that right but i'm talking about to wear that even in the midst of the agony is his sweat but turned to blood we've never come we've never come into that place a matter of fact brother brahm tells us in that conference every demon out of hell was gathered around it was like that arena where samson was at and all the demons that were were gathered there the demons that that had ever made that had ever come upon and influenced men upon the earth every one of them demons were gathered around right trying to you know looking upon what the decision is going to be he prayed three times right three times he prayed and he prayed a prayer that very much like you and i pray at times when we have a test or a trial we have something that comes up brother branham put in souls in prison now he prayed to dodge the cross all right aren't you glad that that prayer wasn't answered right right right come on young people there's some prayers you pray but aren't you glad that god didn't answer them prayers come on older people aren't you glad right we prayed them sincere but aren't we glad that god didn't answer them because reserve what we want to reserve are you hearing the young people what we always want to reserve that might be something we're praying about but let it be in all things god the number one thing is your will that's what i want i might be disappointed temporarily but i know when you're making on your will there's a blessing there's joy there's satisfaction amen reality substance amen longevity there's groundedness in that and he went up to pray and pray alone brother branham would say it like this and i've read this one to you he said if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him three-room house all right so to stay in contact with the spirit that was in it see how god's so convincing he had to spend much time in prayer there's a lot of things we can spend on all right you hear me now a lot of things we but you know what you only spend it's just like when i talked to brother herb the one time i asked brother herb i said what in the world what makes things different with all these antiques brotherhood told me he said ah he said out here at james he said you know people up here don't really look after the things you know you know i don't know if everybody's wanting to cheat cheat something or what he said when i go to kentucky he said i'm emptied up by eight o'clock in the morning they were waiting on him at 5 30 in the morning i said what makes a difference right what makes a difference i mean it ain't because you're from kentucky what makes a difference he said it's the value that the person places upon it that's right and that's what makes the difference it's the value you know that's why you know well one person can say i would buy this pair of shoes and other ones say i ain't spending that much money on them shoes you see the value is in the eyes of the beholder let me just stop here tonight jesus spent much time in prayer there's things that we're going to we're going to spend time on in life and there's things that we have to do in life right but we want to make sure that our life and the time is not spent or taken up with other things and leaving jesus in the corner with dirty feet we're going to spend what do you mean by spin brother samuel it'll cost us it'll cost us a little bit of sacrifice here and there it'll cost us some things it'll cost us some time away but it's the value the value of getting along with god and every one of us that are here there's things that you it seems like seasons of life sometimes that comes about sometimes there's things where just brother brown said in invisible union he said like they say in the south of course i'm speaking home right here we know what that's like like when brother benny talked about being washed up i said we knew what you were talking about man all right what brother graham said you said you heard the saying in the south when it rains it floors or it rains like cats and dogs you know what that means sometimes there's seasons and things in life that comes in our life that sometimes it's things yes we're unprepared for maybe it's things that you have to address at your house that you didn't even prepare on addressing you have to take care of them then there's other things sometimes it comes along like i told the young people before when i was in when i was going to college and in school i remember i told my dad i said you know what i met him one day at bob evans and i said for lunch i said you know what i'm done done now my dad never said boy you know he used wisdom here's what he did he said you can do that if you want but he said let me tell you my experiences with ford and gm and he went down through all the things because at that time they were really hiring for some good money you say brother samuel what was your objective in that i said you know what i'm tired of looking at research papers i want to spend more time listening to the message and here's what he told me he said you can either go that route he said i know what you want how god it so touched my life this this message the lord jesus that's who it is means everything to me all right it gave me life gave you life didn't it amen i just want more i just want more they told me you go down this path but if i went that path then i'm subject to all these other things but i i didn't want to i didn't want to go through this time where i'm like my mind i got to think about this paper and think about this and think about that and think about this do you know what i found and i know some of you heard this over and over but it won't hurt hearing it again you take a message like restoration to the bride tree three hours and 22 minutes it was three cassette tapes because i didn't have one of the mp3s at the time it took me weeks to get through that message going back and forth to school in my off times different times that i had well i could listen to another message there but i just kept a message right there in the car and going back and forth to the bgsu satellite college about 15 minutes in the car but it wasn't about quantity that's right it was about the wallet and there's things that god spoke right then in those messages that i can still and still bring right back in such a reality and so what am i saying things come about sometimes in our life but don't let that get you down that's right even sometimes when you have to make certain changes maybe in career or go to school or you got other things that come about don't get occupied with that but make the most of every opportunity amen take time and i'll tell you this right now i can tell you this by experience that if you put god first you'll come out on top amen if you give yourself to the lord you just give yourself you watch what god will do within your life they'll come those other times that you have longer spaces of time all that runs it runs the same way with pastoring i found it year after year there's certain times sometimes i look for certain months to come and where did months go we must gotten more months added into this calendar year but the value we're going to spend our time on something amen just ask yourself the question what i'm giving myself to is it worth it what's it doing for my life let's see the schooling like i'm speaking to some of you brothers and things like that that's went to schooling you went to schooling but it's like i've told the young people told my boys i hope it's all right i told my boys i said you you either set your priorities right right now or when you get older you have jobs that will control you and take you away from the things that you want to do you want you want god to be first in your life you want to be there to influence your family have prayer with them be able to sit down with your your children when you have them i want you to be able to do that that's your responsibility then you've got to take ownership of things right now because why that way the priorities of serving god being in the house of god you've taken care of first things first it's a season that's right but we'll get through seasons it's just like right now the snow beautiful snow we'll get through it for all you that don't like snow but in the meantime after after this it'll be springtime again amen all right it's just a season right a season and that's how our lives but every season is important every season is important and in every season god is working and there's things that even through these things right now that we look at and sometimes we're saying i just get this out of the way no no no just say god what i'm to learn from this right here not only for my natural life but also in my walk with you teach me lord jesus i pray father tonight lord as we've just come together here lord step aside from the toils of the week and the day lord jesus every one of us we live in a three-room house and every one of us lord things that we have to attend to in the kitchen parlor but oh god may we not forsake the bedroom may we not forsake that place of rest but may we lord i pray as your prophet told us lord jesus spent much time with prayer to stay in fellowship in the spirit lord help us tonight god i ask that if there's lord for every one of us that's here i'm asking the lord that you would just just convey even more the value of prayer there's situations we can be looking at my goodness we can think it's going a certain way but father prayer changes things you said ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it lord may we live faithfully in the kitchen may we live faithfully in the parlor fellowship with brothers and sisters a light precious thing and may we all god live faithfully in the bedroom that place of rest sometimes lord where we have to take our lives we've been in the kitchen for a while we've got to take our lives into the parlor and sometimes we've been there and we we have to take our lives out of the kitchen in the parlor and over into that bedroom i think it's tremendous how your prophet said it that way because it's an entering in as you told us lord jesus in matthew 6 6 [Music] help us lord i pray to take our lives out of these other courts that may god we live by the influence of the supernatural may we stay so in fellowship with you to lord that communion in that that unction lord the sweetness that accompanies getting in your presence the fragrance oh god help us father i pray [Music] lord jesus this is a desire oh god among every one of our hearts lord you spoke to us [Music] lord jesus there's not a heart lord that in here tonight lord that god that anyone should be hanging their head but they should look to you and to know that you've made a way you made a way into the holiest of holies lord through and by the veil of the flesh through your blood you made a way that a person can live a victorious life you've made a wave lord god we can walk the sons and daughters of god and live victoriously lord it's when we get outside and we we fail to take our lives out of the kitchen and out of the parlor [Music] into the bedroom that's that's where we miss victory help us father i pray help us to put first things first lord help us to invite you lord no matter lord what things might come about lord how things sometimes run in season but may we we just want to invite you oh god direct us in this season speak to us in this season lord teach us lord in the season

us what prayer does for our life lord and lord we want to as we've spoken lord be more fellowship one with another lord we love being fellowship lord the devil always tries to take our time away for prayer and take our time away from being with one another in christ i pray lord jesus that you'd help us may we remember these things tonight when the times come to make decisions about how we spend our time lord and whether we make a sacrifice to pray or make the sacrifice of time to spend time with one another we may remember the words that we heard tonight lord jesus may it anchor in our soul lord jesus and change our walk change the way we we plan out our day the way we plan out our week lord we ask for lord i ask for myself and my family lord for all my brothers and sisters be with us
