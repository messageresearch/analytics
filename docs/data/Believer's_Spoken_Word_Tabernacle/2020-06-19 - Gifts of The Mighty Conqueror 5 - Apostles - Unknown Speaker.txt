you we just thank God for His mercy and I just so good to see you this evening just so thankful to be in the house of the Lord we certainly are are in unique times and I just want to say to the church I really appreciate even those that are streaming that are not able to be here tonight I just really appreciate even how that we've been able to approach even here in these past weeks and even where different ones if there's something that's come up where there's been some contacting and someone's been diagnosed with it not here in the assembly but I appreciate where people have taken it and said hey I'm just gonna I'll be at home streaming during the time and so we appreciate that and that's that's what we have to do during during these times to tell you the truth it big goes much much deeper than just Corona I'd appreciate that if it's just the flu right now I'm not giving people excuses stealing from church you know someone's got a toe ache and someone's got no I'm just we're just we got a responsibility that we have before us and we've we've had that for you know at different times and I just so appreciate that and how everyone's really taken that responsibility and trying the best we can to social distance and everything else and I so appreciate that nobody's walking around with a tape measure man I appreciate that I'm so glad I'm not getting phone calls about brother Sam your brother Richard was four foot seven inches from so-and-so no I'm so glad about that because we we definitely did we don't need that and in this time that we're living in we certainly you know need to as we take everything and try to remain calm and and directed within our walk and everything that we're doing so we just we just love the Lord tonight don't you love him amen does he mean more to you tonight Amen let's just go to the Lord in a word of Prayer and the needs that you have and special requests we just want to just take them before the Lord tonight Heavenly Father what a privilege and an honor it is Lord that we can call you our Father and to know that Lord it's not just words but that's a personal revelation we're your offspring Lord we've been changed we've been transformed by you you've touched our lives whoa God it's a paradox Lord that we can't explain but we know we're not the same Lord you're everything to us Oh God this word that you've sent to us Oh God just so illuminated our hearts Lord we just tonight as we come to your Lord we know we're living Lord in trouble sometimes you never you never said that would be easy as a matter of fact Lord how that I think Paul would even encourage the church and exhort them and tell them how that through much tribulation they inherit the kingdom of God you said Lord that in this world we'd have much tribulation but in you we have peace and that's the truth Lord this world it's fallen apart [Music] this framework oh god what's up on this earth but all father what a promise that we have that the meek shall inherit the earth how that the earth itself is groaning and travailing Oh God we're longing for deliverance and lord I pray tonight that you'd come you just speak to our hearts those that are new visible those are in the invisible audience God we ask that you'll minister to every heart into every need father you see those means behind it then uplift at hand the written request and the unwritten ones Lord and we asked your God that the same angel of the Lord that God you would go to your children tonight Lord minister to their needs Lord you know their address Lord you're the same age of the Lord that even after a meeting is over after the prayer has been pray you still come around through neighborhoods notice your prophet with jealousy said the age of the Lord he can't get to it all at once or sometimes you'll come around a day a week the time after that meeting but Lord it's a promise that we're holding to and we thank you O God before that deposit of faith in our hearts where we can just take your word and just rest on and say Papa said it he meant it to me there was nobody else he made sure that promise was placed in there for my need oh god how we thank you we know you to be that detailed that mindful we just asked now may your spirit just come just just bring it over us Lord take us the Lord I pray minister to our needs Lord tonight if there's one year that don't know you're in the invisible audience that would hear it Lord may their heart be so touched your God it'll have to be more than a man you know have to be you father but you know each and every one of your children Lord and you're not loser one so father we just ask that may you come help us Lord right now if there be anything Lord that we've said or done or fought in any way that would be out of line forgive us Lord we're standing in need of you Lord God we're here to serve we're here father to receive from you we heard of Lord give you worship Lord may you just come now father we pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's open our Bibles to mark chapter 16 and we want to begin reading here familiar passage and scriptures to the church but these are still the general orders it's the last Commission to the church verse 14 afterward he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at meat and upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to would like to by the help of the Lord to continue on with this are the gifts of the mighty Conqueror but I'd like to look at the that of the ministerial gift out of the apostles and begin to look at that here tonight because we know that brother Branham would make it very very clear to us and we'll see different things that as we go through it a lot of familiar ground but to recognize that in inside of Christ here the great diamond of God you find that here in his ministry you'll find that of an apostle you'll find that of a of a teacher you'll find that of the Prophet that was spoken you'll find that of even in the Ministry of the Lord Jesus there will be times that will come forth that are very pastoral and then there are times that are very evangelistic of an evangelist so all of them as brother Bramblett said in him was all of them and yet though all that were within him yet how that when this Great Commission is given we we do not read of in this in these words here of of the words here of pastors or evangelists or any of those words but all of that it comes down to God has a way of setting all of these things forth when they're needed God doesn't give anything until it's needed that's how it is even in our life sometimes we can get ahead in our thinking and our thought about something and wanting but remember God always prepares you for what he has for you at that time there's always things that are unfolded at that moment and that happens all the way through our natural life and all the way in through our spiritual life God is preparing us for what even that would be coming and what that he has called us to and I look at this in the scripture of how that they were they were set forth by the vindicated word that was now present in them there was no longer just them walking with Jesus but now that same word was vindicated personally inside of them not just to see him that he was raised from the dead but to know that with a living reality that so changed their lives and his life now living on the inside of them they it was a reality to them of who he was personally to them so what they were going forth with was a testimony of a personal experience and that's exactly I think of how you know brother Brandon would would would speak of how that a man who feel called to preach he said you know a person might look and say well I don't know what to say he said just say and tell somebody how your candle got lit because that's ultimately what it is it's it's the it's the experience of a living God and so when we look at this thing they came out in this time with a very boldness of the lion they had went into the upper room they were cowards but now they come out with a boldness of the line they've got a message that they're gonna proclaim a message that they're going to roar forth and so to think of it that this was to begin at Jerusalem Jesus said in John 20:21 he said to them peace be unto you and as my father hath sent me even so send I you and he speaks in Acts chapter 1 verse 8 you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you that that there are qualifications that go along with the ministry and I'm not going to focus upon those tonight but there is one thing that qualifies not only for the ministry but for every true believer and that is to be endued with power from on high because the Holy Ghost is not a separate person from God it's not a separate person from the Lord Jesus it is God the Lord of glory come down and take upon a body of flesh in order to bring you and I back to himself that we might receive the life that we were intended to have before the fall you see when we see this here in the scripture notice as he said and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost parts of the of the earth now I want you to notice even if Jesus would would would express this here you see God don't leave anything unfinished he ain't like us start one project and we leave that project and go to another one and then we leave that one and going God don't leave things unfinished he finishes what he starts is that right so now when the Lord godwyn he has he has appointed that remember that the covenants be adducts and all of these things were spoke through the Old Testament and there we find it within Isaiah is so much that that is wrote and placed within there as well as all throughout the Old Testament that salvation was coming to the Jews it would speak not only of salvation coming that the Messiah there was to be a visitation but it also goes into deal with where God Himself will finish that work with 144,000 because remember the gospel first was to be preached to the Jews because this is where as our salvation and how that that he would come and remember when we look at this there is a finishing up even now of the mystery of God the Holy Ghost gospel among the Gentiles in the forming of the bride of Jesus Christ his body his bride now this was the mystery that Paul would talk about these are things that though you and I by God's grace we can see it wrote in Isaiah it's rope for clearly there of that hidden mystery of the Gentile bride but it is not something that the Jews were seeing and recognizing at that time and remember they rejected his visitation just as the God turned from the Jews to the Gentiles we also realize that when God is finished with the Gentiles and we're living in the finishing time there's and there's no more there's not another age after this age there's not another message that's to come there's not another outpouring of the Holy Ghost for the Gentiles this is the finishing time and after God has done with the Gentiles win the last bride member has been called amen that the bride is raptured she's lifted from this earth she's changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and we go to the wedding supper there will not be another Gentile saved are you with me and it turns them to the Jews oh my and so without laboring upon that and coming into that think of how you know that Jesus or the angels when they were looking at Jesus ascends up and they were standing there and they were gazing you know when you gaze on something you're you're looking on it's not just like you somebody says hey look at this picture they aren't uh-huh no no you gaze on it you're looking at it but evidently they needed to make sure that was not what they were to be focused on they could see him go they could see him be received in a cloud but there was work to be done and in order for that work to be done they had to get back to Jerusalem because that's where the Holy Spirit was going to be poured out there's no way that they could accomplish it in their own humanistic way you can be ever so great in the mind but it is not the mind of man that defeats the enemy the enemy can outfox any man let me just tell you right now the precepts the foundations of this world I'm talk about the system now that is even present is based on reasoning and reasoning never brings peace amen that's why there's got to come something greater than reasoning now when we look at this in the word remember we've been reading from in Ephesians 4 and it speaks the one of the very first phrases here in the scriptures Ephesians 4:11 it says and he gave some apostles this is very first that's the very first mention now as we going down if we would read on down through the scripture but I'm not going to for sake of time tonight there is one purpose when we when you read down through that of Ephesians 4 even though every one of these gifts they are all from the same diamond but they are all diverse they all have their part and it's just like when we look at it that as we've been you know looking at that in the body and how Paul would express that the hand itself is used to reach out and grab something but the hand cannot chew the food the hand does not process it but the hand has a part in it this is why when brother branham is talking about the word going out he mentions up some brothers one had found a lot of oil 25 million dollars worth and brother Brent said that brother brother family he said he has dedicated that to the work of the Lord to send out missions Betty says another one has and they come up with the white now these listen now these are believers now he said they come up with a way they can actually I'll somehow you know dehydrate the blood or freeze it and they're able to draw things out of it they had developed a way and a means to do that but out of that a great patent and a lot of money come out of it but he also was designating the money to sin brothers overseas you see God God works we're not it's not separate we all a God has intended that we work together so that things would be accomplished so we're we're depending on him whether it's through the hand whether it's through the arm the feet were depending on him now brother Brandon would say it like this here here when he deals with Apostle he said now for the perfecting of the church God has said in the church apostles and he says you say apostles now I don't know how would people ever want to change their name and call themselves missionaries instead of apostles I don't know but a missionary and an apostle is exactly the same thing same word one that is sent a missionary is an apostle so so an apostle is a missionary it's one that's been sent and when a man feels led of God and sent of God to go to Africa India that makes him an apostle or a missionary which ever way you want to call it let me just keep on doing read a few more places but the RAM goes into another place he says now in the baptism of the Holy Spirit go to the second paragraph there that's the first highest call a missionary and he says you say an apostle is a missionary absolutely go look in the dictionary and find out what the apostle means it means one that is sent they says what a missionary means one who sent the same thing the highest order is a missionary who travels the Seas for the Lord Jesus he goes on to say not one who makes out you know like he's an apostle but he stays home you see but one who really is a missionary an apostle now I'm only going to cover one avenue of this tonight but notice he goes on and he deals without you know you're in the will of God that you have to be when you're a missionary so it doesn't mean that brother Ben's not saying in what somebody says I'm a missionary well you must be in the will of God that's not what he's saying you must be in the will of God in order to be a missionary and if God has called you to be a missionary you're in the will of God is that right because the General Orders go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature he says now a missionary is a very fine word but I got a better word for it you're an apostle now what does the word apostle mean it means one cent he goes into this again and now in the next letter next paragraph so missionaries prophets evangelists teachers and pastors make up the church apostles prophets they call so as long as you're a missionary or an apostle you're one cent of God to a mission hallelujah there's a mission so when we look at that there is a purpose now I want to just think of this here let's look at this in Hebrews three Paul would pick this up and he would speak of the Lord Jesus and he says wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house so then there had to be one to bring this gospel to you and I and the end the end the first that of the apostle here is Jesus Christ he is the Apostle and high priest of our confession he is the one who was sit Isiah calls in Isaiah I think it's Isaiah 51 when you look at Isaiah 51 it would seem as though that that Isaiah is writing of himself or God would even be referring to Isaiah and yet Isaiah was his servant but he's speaking of his servant Christ the branch he's speaking of the Ministry of the Messiah that it would be that very servant that would bring back that of Israel back home he's the apostle he's one that has been sent let me just say it when we look at this here he is one who is sent now look how the Apostle look how the Lord Jesus when he comes he was not received among the religious people he wasn't received among them now there was a remnant that was waiting that was looking there were those who were waiting on the coming of the Messiah but when he came he went among the outcasts as a matter of fact the Pharisees had a problem with it because they said in Luke 15 this guy is friends with wine bidders and publicans but how are you gonna win them if you don't friend them come on somebody you gotta you gotta gain favor before you can ever drop anything how long do I have to wait for favor I'm getting to the end of this day I just gotta say something right now you wait until God as you say something God might not have you say nothing to that person are you with me we are under strict order do not cast your pearls before swine if you test the water and somebody seems like it's a little bit of me you give a little more see if it's a little bit more opening but we're not in the business of trying to cram that's not what an apostle does then listen now as a believer even where God has called us out from the world and God has sent you and I to be a witness God never called you and I to cram anything that man I gotta make somebody see it we can't make nobody see this truth you can't make nobody I don't care how well you can explain it I don't care how well you know the words the Greek of the Hebrew that is not what turns the heart it takes God to come down and turn that heart is that right a man who said in the church all the time and brother Ram talk to you about here he was he was watching the Sun come up and the Sun preached a message to him and he repented and give his life to God think about Jesus talked about the prodigal think about what the Ministry of the Lord Jesus here was a ministry that was coming to seek and save that which is lost well if something is lost at one time it was found is that right yet had I belong he come to seek and save which is lost so now it's got to be a ministry the Ministry of the son of man is to recover redeem what belongs to one now here the Lord Jesus look at this look how this is declared here's the Apostle and high priest of our confession in Luke 4 and right after he's been baptized with the Holy Ghost here God stepping on the inside the Bible says in Luke 4:17 there was delivered unto Him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal up the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind said it liberty them that are bruised he's on a mission he's on a mission Jesus did not come here without a mission he came here to do the will of him that sent him he was on a mission a missionary an apostle he was on a mission let me just say this to you right now when God speaks to your heart how brother Brandon would place it like this God calls you out of where you were in the world and now you're walking in a land as a sojourner as a stranger is if God calls you out like an apostle you've been sent by God to be a witness you used to run around and have all sorts of things and whether you ran around or not you had all sorts of worldliness in your life come on now you had a love for the world but God calls you out of the world here we still walk in the world maybe you walk in the same job but being called out of the world doesn't mean you left your job he calls you out of that old sin nature like he called Abraham away from his kindred away from that old sin nature God is calling out his children like he sent Moses down to Egypt he said say unto Pharaoh let my son go that he might serve me this is not the Son of God this is the son of God this is what the word speaks to the flesh can feel good but the word comes to give authority to the inside man that says raise up look at this mission to preach the acceptable year of the Lord this is recovery this is to redeem this is to come back to your they knew what this meant in Israel it meant to come back into your inheritance the land that belonged to you the bondage you had sold yourself in to come back out of that bondage come back to your land come back to your rightful inheritance that's what this was announcing it was announcing this is the acceptable year or has it would be place the Jubilee year and after this Jubilee year there would be seven Sabbath they would have to wait then of 49 years and to the fiftieth until the next Jubilee King is was a sounding out that's why the gospel calls out let him that hath an ear here it sounds out so he closes the book he gives it to the minister and sit down in the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears how many times they had had that read but they never had that exclamation point put after it what brought the exclamation point this day is this scripture that has just read fulfilled in your ears God was present in Christ any time God comes on the scene he's the one that brings the exclamation point to the word here he was the Lamb of God think of it the Holy Ghost has not even been given I want you to think of this in the earthly Jim journey when he comes to the River Jordan here John John would not have known him had the Holy Ghost not pointed him out he looks like anybody else let me just say it like this if there was a lineup of ten people of who could be the Lamb of God Jesus might not have made the lineup are you with me you say why did you say that ko City is not about these eyes recognizing it you don't see with these eyes you see with these eyes down here remember these eyes will deceive you these eyes will say there's a hook oh we're outnumbered but these are down here said there's more with us unless these eyes get an on to here you'll never see the kingdom of God is that right it just becomes who's watching who am i around but I wonder who I'll see if I go to the store I wonder who about to do that you're looking with these eyes but when you've got these eyes on the inside you're no longer worried about who you see right here you have met the author of life and your desires and nature's have changed brother and the only thing you desire is to please him he was the Lamb of God the true atonement on earth how much you think of this Jesus here right after the Jordan he didn't just walk to Calvary there was a Ministry of three and a half years but the true atonement was on earth are you with me not only will see the provided sacrifice and he was to become our high priest but to think now he was not going to become a high priest after the order of Aaron no they just keep on dying and passing on and those are in Institute's of orders and everything that this one is going to be after the order of Melchizedek this is who it is the same one who met Abraham the same one come down and become our sacrifice while he was in his earthly ministry in his own corporal body what he did in that body what he did in that body is the same thing that he does in his earthly mystical body that of believers of children of God that are our makeup this body and are born by his Spirit the same way that he acted in that body is the same way that he acts in this body you asked me he said the works that I do shall you do also it's the same Jesus in a redeemed bride body Jesus said it like this and this this has to be the testimony of each and every life every apostle every missionary every witness of God he that sent me is with me the father hath not let me alone sometimes you might feel alone but he ain't left you alone he said though I'm with you always you may not seem like you've got the answer right then but just wait he still leads his children for I do always those things which please him now notice in Luke 4 let's continue here in Luke 4 when the Sun was setting and all day that had any sick with desire divers diseases brought them unto him and he laid his hands on them and healed them and the devil's also came out of many crying out and saying thou art the Christ the Son of God and He rebuking them suffered them not to speak for they knew that he was Christ and when it was day he departed and went into a desert place and the people sought him and he came unto him and stayed him that he should not depart from them and he said unto them I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also for therefore am I sent this is the Apostle and he preached in the synagogue's of Galilee now Matthew 10 look where when the Lord Jesus here is is because called disciples there has been every one of these disciples and here they are of the 12 disciples notice in just this account in Matthew when he had called unto him his 12 disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease and it goes through the names of the Twelve Apostles are these salmon who's first called Peter Andrew his brother James the son of Zebedee and John his brother Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and Matthew the publican James the son of Alphaeus and lobbyists whose surname was thaddaeus simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him who Judas was part of the original apostles they come and follow me he had an apostle ship he was sent out with the rest of them and noticed and what I want you to catch here under this watch the leadership in the direction because God is the one who calls now remember with Judas you know in a mind and I just want to to lay that in you know it could look in the scriptures say well Judas yeah he's an apostle he's one that you know that that turned him down but remember gifts and callings are without repentance a man that can sing a man that can Rider a woman what have you they'll give an account for that gift where everyone will give an account let me just bring it on down for the gifts and talents that God has put within your life you give an account on what you do with them brother Branham came up to preach behind a man that had just been whistling in different bird language hello he came up behind it and I wonder him you know man if if we didn't have this on tape and it happened maybe in a message Church somebody's like man that's carnal brother branham came right up behind it he said did you hear how he's sung the gospel in that bird language he whistled it chirped it out you know what he came around and said he said there is a part in that for that to be expressed just like those who sing songs those who preach the gospel he goes on he says whatever that God has called you to do bill it hmm it may not be a song I'd request a lot but under his leadership and this is under his leadership in direction this is what the Ministry of the Lord Jesus he comes to lead his church notice in verse five he sins that these twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not in the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not don't go there right now but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel so now he's sending the Apostles for what get after the lost sheep of Israel that's what an apostle is gone for this is not just to say very clear the work of the ministry it's not an occupation we'll bring it down to your life for a beer Christian it's not an occupation it's not something you punch in and punch out it's got to be that you are called to it and man it becomes a burden on your heart to please him to live for him a man is together the lost sheep of the house of Israel and as you go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is a hand heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast out Devils freely you have received freely give provide neither gold nor silver nor brass in your purses nor scrip for your journey neither two coats neither shoes nor yet States for the workman is worthy of his meat you know what he's letting them know I'm sending you I'll take care of you whom God sins he takes care when God leads you somewhere the grace of God that leads you that will keep you that's the beauty of it if you've knocked down the door you'll have to knock down the doors to keep it open but God has led you there you can rest it don't mean the trials ain't going to come if domaine tests aren't gonna come that's what knowing the will of God does it gives you stability when tests and trials come your way and situations come against you you have something to say I know that God has sent me this way hallelujah hallelujah that applies to all of our lives and into whatsoever city or town you shall enter inquire who in it is worthy and there abide till you go hence and when you come into a house saluted and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you so in other words and an apostle apostles not coming here into the church apostle is one who is sent and they're coming into areas where there is no church that's why Paul could say as apostles we are made spectacles unto men unto angels and unto others we're men as Paul would say in Corinthians they deem us as fools they cut Paul Paul would go stand before great learning men and he would speak the gospel not that the whole crowd was going to come sometimes it would be worn out of there the gospel is not about a crowd the Gospels about the lost sheep and if the house be worthy let your peace come upon it but if it be not worthy let your peace return to you you think about that in Philip I my goodness when Paul was in a you know in a strait he and Silas but think about God had been there in that situation because the Philippian jailer God sent him there and it did not you know look what was going on in Philippi but God had him there so that Philippian jailer could hear the gospel and when he received the gospel notice peace came upon his house the word found him worthy he welcomed the word in what must we do to be saved brother Branham takes that up in the message the house he said we're so busy telling people what you shouldn't do and don't do this and don't do that he said telling what they ought to do what belief if you really believe sin will flee it just takes simple faith in the word God you said that I believe it and you accept that more where it comes I accept that you stand on that you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words when you depart out of that house or city shake off the dust off of your feet verily I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Day of Judgment than for that City that's true wonder even and how the message has come over the years it's coming there were certain cities the message came right into and yet right in the midst of that city no churches newspapers attacked it didn't go on and on but that don't mean all the city was against it there was some elect so much subtle that it could be spoken just like Nathanael could say what good can come out of Nazareth the city you're from whoa you might have a bad reputation but you get called from another country glory be to God Oh mah good ordained to eternal life now let me just let me move on here into this into this part how that Paul would go on in Romans 10 just get down there with me for just a moment in Romans 10 twelve familiar Scripture there's no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved now then how shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher how shall they preach except they be sent all he said how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things but they have not obeyed the gospel not all have obeyed the gospel for Isaiah said Lord who has believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and their words unto the ends of the world now here in Romans 11 13 Paul would express for I speak to you Gentiles in as much as I am the apostle of the Gentiles I magnify mine office this is one of the few places where Paul is affirmatively declaring what God has revealed to him personally his position his in the economy of God now these assertions because there were many others who were coming around and saying this and saying that but you know it was more than Paul just saying this Paul wasn't a braggart Paul was not that kind of a guy as a matter of fact Paul would have the testimony in first Corinthians 59 I'm the least of the Apostles and I'm not me to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God Paul knew it was God's grace he knew it was the grace of God that he was standing there by Paul was not looking at it that he wasn't worthy of God's grace he just saying God how God has ordained me to be an apostle I wasn't even me to be an apostle but God called him to be an apostle things that involves life in the past that could have seemed so detrimental but God had called him to be an apostle brother when God speaks it supersedes uh understand I believe God keeps his hand upon a man's life I believe God watches over a man so that there are qualifications that are met met within the ministry but think of Paul's life Paul when he could look back and say I'm not even worthy of this right here but you know it was that very attitude that wouldn't allow Paul to be used by God because the very moment a person thinks they're worthy and can do something that's the sure son they're not usable this is why when God would reveal himself to Paul Paul would would account of this in acts 20 acts 26 15 when he's in here he is recalling this account as he standing there who art our Lord and he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutors rise and stand upon my feet for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make the a minister and a witness both of these things which thou has seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles unto whom now I Cindi to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that is in me this is a purpose is sent with a mission now notice how Paul the countess would go with an Apostle Paul would declare he says in verse 17 of Romans 15 I have therefore wherever I may glory through Jesus Christ in those things which pertain to God well I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ hath not wrought by me to make the Gentiles obedient by word and deed through mighty signs and wonders and I want you to just just to hang on to that for a moment through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit of God so that from Jerusalem and roundabout electrum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ notice from Jerusalem yay so have I strived to preach the gospel not where Christ was named this is an apostle this is a missionary now listen an apostle can be sent in may be there's a church and how that they invite they invite this man in to come and minister and this is a denominational Church and that man brings the gospel of Jesus Christ even though here they are as a church but it brings them into a reality with wisdom if God leads him to go right into that a prophet has come then so be it but in many times those are things that will be shut down quickly but this is why Jesus could say be wise as a serpent and harmless as a death is getting them to see that this is Scripture God can send a man in just like that when it's a mission and he's done that an apostle missionary sent it right in somewhere as Church will start right up from there others where an assembly our church or churches that there will be they'll be completely converted they will come to the light of the gospel some of them when they leave their denominations you know even if some of the testimonies we've out here the denominations takes a hold of their churches and kicks them out but as the pastors and those of the assembly that will go with them and they go with them to walk on into the light they go an apostle one who has sent there's an omission notice Paul Paul is going to preach the gospel where it's not named remember when brother Jason DeMars stood here back is over a year ago December of 2018 I think it was and brother Jason going going among in those air in those areas among the Arabs and in some of those countries and even in certain ones where just couldn't even name the country because of going in there and all of the tightness around it it's not going it's not it's not just going in there just like myself going to preach a meeting somewhere he's going in there that's an apostle my brother Jason's never said that to me but you just look at how God has put the burden on his heart and then how the word has come to direct those things and lay that right in God has to have somebody equipped for that first we can say oh my I sure would like to go there you got to make sure it's not your imagination you need to know that God has called you and I know God had called me there not where Christ was named notice in verse 21 but as it is written to whom he was not spoken of they shall see and they that have not heard shall understand once you think of this here look at this example when Paul would go as an apostle paul would enter in and we find this is something I want you to just to look at this for a moment in the scripture you find you back in acts 8 without reading it the church here the church is just moving forward I mean they've just God has just done such a marvelous work just the outpouring of the Holy Ghost signs and wonders are being done souls are being added to the church but God says this has got to get out this has got to get out God's not trying to create a communal environment let's let's all get out let's let let's all let's build a housing division and let's all just live together then what God's trying to do we are we we live in Christ but notice God permits the very one were reading about who at that time was named Saul he permits havoc and persecution to come against the Church of the Living God and the Bible says they were scattered gone allowed him to be scattered but God utilized that persecution because the Bible says they went everywhere preaching the gospel sometimes God will take us take situations just like that you utilize them for his glory God is always in control it's always in our hearts God looking for an opportunity what would you have me do right now when this opportunity this is taking place this is going on you find Paul let me just try to just just wrap this up here tonight but Paul here he comes he's right here in in Corinth and in acts 18 verse 7 he departed fence and he entered into a certain man's house named Justice one that worshipped God whose house joined hard to the synagogue and Crispus the chief ruler of the synagogue believed on the Lord with all his house and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by vision be not afraid but speak and hold not thy peace God would have never told him don't be afraid if he wasn't afraid God wouldn't have told him speak if he didn't feel like speaking no more and I don't want you to hold your peace here's why for I am with thee and no man shall set on me to hurt thee for I have much people in this city that City right there Paul felling and by the scripture know that he felt like giving up many have believed yeah there's been those whose belief but he's letting Paul know don't you leave here right now you see an apostle a missionary there under the direction of God how long do I stay I have your orders I have your orders and he stayed there under a call of God because there were many people I have much people did you notice what God called him they're my people I've redeemed them I shed my blood they were in my mind before the foundation of the world they were covered over with all sorts of things Paul went in address that but they were God's people they needed to hear the gospel they are all sorts of conditions about their life but the devil could tell him you're not even worthy but God would call to them and bring them home and he continued there a year and six months teaching the Word of God among them who had him stay there God did for what purpose there was a need after the people had come in there was a need to teach them the Word of God that's another aspect of an apostle and we'll stop there tonight God will go for one God will send for one piece one person God might have you in the job you're in now for one person the department you're in now for one person one day he stopped he said I must need to go by Samaria he was sent to Samaria and there was a woman this appointment was already arranged in the mind of God she walked away from that well a different person that day she met him he was led to that moment Paul led in another place you know as you read in the book of Acts sometimes they don't know where where do we go God do we go into Asia right now and Paul the Bible said he has saved tested it should we go here November 1 in the Macedonian in Macedonian garb garb you understand it's the native things that would stand out this is Macedonia and it says come to us Paul knew by that dream that vision do not go into Asia go to Macedonia that's where the sheep were at that moment there were sheep in Asia but everything is in God's time it's in God's time God is the one who is orchestrating and leading it and this is what as an apostle just one Avenue is one who is sent it's a missionary and another part of us were looking at here and we're just closed tonight it's one who comes and he sets things in order to see that a church is established Apostles very important Jesus himself picks it up in Revelations 21 and the Foundation's even of that New Jerusalem is built upon the 12 apostles the body of Jesus Christ Paul picks it up in in Ephesians it's built upon that foundation of the apostles and the prophets not the men but the revelation of Jesus Christ the true doctrine of the word foundation is very important I tell you I'm grateful to God for a word that is coming this day aren't you glad that the word come to you now you might say but the same thing I was born and raised in a message pew but aren't you glad the word came to you it's more than just well I've always said I've always been in this church or I've always been around the message but it's where he comes to you he comes to you and he makes himself known personally to you that you're included in Calvary you've been included in the resurrection because I live you shall live awesome he comes to deliver a personal message in that tremendous in the tremendous how that God would come right down and he brought somebody across your weight some of you you know I can't say this but some of you that were not even around the message didn't even know anything about it but somebody shared it with you somebody was obedient to the Lord somebody shared this good news aren't you glad that it came to you aren't you glad that they yielded and shared this word look what it's done in our lives oh oh how accountable how accountable that we are may God help us to be as yielded as the person was that surrendered and gave us our first tape our first book or told us come see we're commissioned by God a trust these things become a little bit more clear just more as we're just laying it and just trying to teach this these things to see that part and that's necessary everything every one of these parts and within our lives every one of us has a part and nobody can take your place if these ain't just good words it's the absolute truth nobody can take your place but I say Lord Here I am what if what I have I give it to you I don't have much but I give it to you Lord I'll give everything I give all mall Lord to be used by you we're called to be witnesses now you may not be a missionary I may not be a missionary to you know as it's been said to Ecuador it might just be the next door right and may not be to all out there and might just be to your family but remember wait on the Lord wait on God because sometimes remember like with Paul it wasn't that Paul that God didn't have sheep in Asia it wasn't the time God said go here first then come over and then they came around we never go wrong when we're seeking his leading maybe you're out fishing with your relative or you're out hunting with them or you're out you know in those times you just pray in your heart I could better close I just keep going here but you pray God giving me give me something Lord is there something I could say to a lord is there something I could express to him something you had had me to say God is faithful he's faithful you're loving tonight let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're just so appreciative we're so thankful o God that you became my lord we're so thankful Lord that you sent Jesus all to be our perpetuation oh god to make a way for us you became flesh you shed your blood send it on high as you rose from that grave on that Easter morning and

some of them Lord the scripture said it made him so mad that they went and got as the Bible said lewd fellows to cause a riot and say it say all these things against Paul against Jason and all those bring false accusations against him it was stirring and how did that opposition was against him God there was a burning reality there is a flame that was not lit by man all the unbelief that was around couldn't distinguish it they were set by you because you had sheep that were there you lingered you were merciful even throughout that time still Lord God even when Paul was carrying forth that gospel to the Gentiles yet there were times Lord as a ministering to the Jews we know that there were Jews and that in those times Lord Paul Peter would even speak to some of them Lord they were
