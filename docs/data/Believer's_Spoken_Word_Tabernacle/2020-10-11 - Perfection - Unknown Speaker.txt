lord amen you love him this morning so good to be gathered together once again god has made a way for us to be here and um we just thank god that he's just keeping his hand upon us and um i want to say brother brian already mentioned it but we just wanted to welcome sister lily's mom glad to have you here with us amen and certainly take our greetings back whenever you you go back may god richly bless you it's good to have you here i also want to make mention um in this time i want to say thank you for as you're coming in the church and walking into the sanctuary thank you for wearing the masks i've noticed that some of the time when i wasn't ministering and i was able to see as i've come in come back through here how you've been coming in in that manner if you haven't i would ask that you would um i want but i want to say thank you and i just the the things that we we know uh with this one thing about this with this virus and um i don't like talking about it no more than you do but ignoring it doesn't make it make it go away and ignoring it isn't faith ignoring it is wishful thinking but we realize that for all of us the inconveniences and everything that it has been all around us uh everywhere you go and so forth but i i personally believe that as we've looked more at this and you see certain sometimes positions and this is my right and this is this and this is that i really wonder is god permitted all of this to really test and see is our character really got all the greenness out because it doesn't mean that we go along with everything because we always agree with it or see it but as the scripture said give unto caesar that which is caesar's and this is certainly not an infringement upon our religious liberties and uh things like this inconvenience oh yes i i mean i think about when i had to it was in a doctor's office with one of our sons the one day and my had to wear the mask you know as you're in there the whole time and usually with the store you know you're in and out with the store real quick i just whether it's mask or no mask i'm kind of a purpose guy i'm like on the swat team when i go into the store to shop i'm not there just to window browse you know even if i'm going to look at a tie go to the clearance rack nothing on clearance rack leave i mean it's just i'm done you know so um but i remember you know we were sitting there and i we you know sometimes you have to sit for a longer time and and i just remember that that particular day when uh you know after i come out of there and i come home and i know some of you as medical professionals and i know i know our middle son benjamin he has to wear it the whole time when he's at work with food when i came out of there my goodness i felt so you know i just seemed like i couldn't get my bearings back through the rest of the day and uh but you know we i just want to say thank you for for doing that thank you for through the time just you know letting everything you know our differences and feelings just i'm just thankful to god just that we can lay all that aside because satan doesn't matter he doesn't care what he can do or what he can use he'll use something that is so insignificant to try to bring division and these are things in this hour i believe that the word that god has sent to you and i it's to sharpen our discernment it's to catch him as brother branham would put it recognize the devil at every one of his tricks so i i want to say thank you for those as you're coming in and i just want to encourage you if you haven't been please do that uh and while after dismissal and then when we're out here these are things that the deacons even had brought to my attention even while we're out here uh you know trying to social the distance or whatever we're doing all of this and trusting lord because of all the sanitation that goes into this building after a service you're not going to get every germ that's why with everything we do we trust the lord and so um you know i just i i believe with all my heart we can just just say lord just just help me just leave me i know there's been different ones um and and i certainly don't want anything to be a lacks or carelessness on our part uh with anything it would you know uh so we just we want to do the best we can i understand you do everything you can and it's like with everything we've seen our president last week and where he was at with everything i mean if that was the tightest probably you could get there's other brothers pastors that's come down with it they don't have any idea how in the world did they come down with it because they followed everything um but yet that's what we want to do all that we can do but we trust the lord and so i know i'm just thankful that god has allowed us we've not had any interruption and i was that right there goes not to myself or to the deacons i think you for following uh the guidance and for the direction uh that's been been given because we just our objective we i want to be in the house of god i i mean i i wouldn't care if they said you got to wear a brown paper bag and preach through it i don't care i want to be in the house of god i'm not going to let that get my attitude in a wrong way well i tell you bless this is why we just want to give we want to give place and just say lord i'm this is the purpose i'm not going to be sidetracked i'm going to stay with a focus and an attraction on you and that's what that's our that's our objective here we just want to try to do that so i'm just asking why as you enter the building when you exit the sanctuary and then exit the building please uh have your mask on and then when you get outside then you know you can take it off i guess if you're not going to socially distance but don't don't come up to somebody to me or anybody else and uh without even if you've got a mass don't try to see how many cavities i've had personal space i love you brother samuel we ought to be able to chew one another's bubble gum it's got to be the right flavor and i'm the first guy to chew it let's say ain't what the quote says then you pray for god to help me grow to that place amen well we just love the lord let's just turn our hearts right now to the to the word as we would look into the word if you'll stand with me i want to go to romans chapter 8. so okay uh romans 8 verse 1. let's just read a few verses of scripture here and to and this morning what i want to deal with the thought that we want to look at in opening in this in this chapter um is perfection just the simple word perfection in verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death notice it was the law of the spirit of life that makes us free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now let me before i have you standing let me just read a quote where we we stopped in on this on thursday night and brother branham reading coming here he says now there's many he's talking about behind the veil being in christ there's many that pretend to be in there and let me just comment on this pretending is where a person knows that everything and their life is not where it ought to be but they're acting as though it is pretending is not a life that is in journey are you with me so here brother brown brings that through there's many that pretend to be in there there's many that's warring themselves and trying to live right and trying to press in i don't know about that but if they are in there it's just as easy to live a christian life as it is to live any life because you're in christ and nothing else but just so full of the holy spirit leads you and guides you and directs you and why sure you'll make mistakes and fall but you can't stay down because no more than you could make a stock of corn or a sycamore tree you can't do that jesus said by their fruits you shall know them you have everlasting life amen so let's look at that here this morning and that thought of perfection and let's just pray together dear heavenly father as we come to this portion lord of the service oh god we are just looking to you this morning that you will come you'll deliver the word to our hearts break every yoke lord god fill every heart lord refill our lives lord heal the sick that's among us lord move in a very special way lord as we're gathered here and those that are gathered by way of the internet we ask lord all these things for the glory of god in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you as you're being seated amen i want to when we look at this this thought here we we recognize that in our life um there must come an end to all strife in other words to uh any warring or trying as brother branham words it in that quote of warring or trying to live right there's got to come uh to where it's not striving where to do and and act right but there comes an absolute there comes an uh an anchor on the inside that so completely changes our desires our nature by placing the love of god within us and when we look here in the scripture as it speaks in that final verse of scripture we read that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the righteousness remember the law itself was glorious the law itself was not sin the law the law itself as paul would write it's holy but the law what we're speaking of the righteousness of the law it now takes the focus off of the law and places it to whom is the very author of that law of that word his righteousness because that's where the law comes from it comes as that which is scripted out of the very righteousness of god himself just like on the back of a package of a seed the words that are there are a script that describes the very life that's inside that seed no matter how big or how small those words describe the life that's in there so the the writing there of the law it was it was the script it's holy because it was that which was which would describe or to uh to describe the very righteousness of god himself so it's his spirit the law giver himself the author that thereby he places that law in our hearts so that our whole being is wrapped and dedicated to the word of god by the holy ghost now in matthew 5 verse 20 you know when jesus remember when he's standing here upon the earth here in the temple of his humanity oftentimes here the scribes the lawyers remember scribes and lawyers as they would come to him pharisees they would come and they would try to ensnare him ask him questions what's the greatest commandment and they would go on and on and yet here jesus now speaking to the disciples he says in matthew 5 20 i say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and pharisees you shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven now think about it this statement that is made it takes into account the impossibility that even if a man is hitting the law right on the dot it's still it does not gain entrance into the kingdom of heaven so then it's speaking there's got to come a righteousness now if god's asking or requiring this then this is something that god is drawing our attention to he's drawing their attention to it not to condemn them but to show them there is there is a greater reality or to take them from a shadow and a type to the actual anatype or the reality he goes on to say that how that the pharisees in those he says you know they love them that love they love those who love them he says you know everybody is going good with them hey they love them but anybody crosses them look out and this is where he says there's got to come a greater righteousness to where that you even love those who hate you or as he would say in other places pray praying for them that despitefully use you i'm telling you this takes a greater a greater measure i'm not just talking about where something is not said well i didn't say i didn't say a wrong and unkind word to this person no no this is deeper it deals with within the heart because remember malice is an altogether what comes out here malice is what will come out of here and that's why if we entertain things or allow things to dwell in our life even after we have been fully converted that's where the grieving of the holy spirit comes in and that's why we need the spirit of god to move down within our life brother and sister all along it's been him that has brought us to his south and brother and sister when we stand on the other side it'll be because of his grace that has brought us home hallelujah and let's just face it sometimes we can't even see things the way we need to see it but thanks be to god as a child of god god is mindful to come and let us know and say you can't feel this way and we don't just all of a sudden turn the switch okay i'm not going to feel that way no but we ask god lord lord cleanse me lord forgive me for feeling that way entertaining that thought what is that that's working it's the righteousness of god now notice here you see in at the end of this chapter here the lord jesus comes to this place on what righteousness will exceed the righteousness of the pharisees remember let me just just make another point here remember on this of the pharisees these were people you cannot put your finger on their life and say you ain't doing this no no they were doing everything outwardly but the manner in which they did it you see there's a difference it was a righteousness but it was a self-righteousness self-righteousness you can sniff that out like crazy self-righteousness is it brings a condemning dogmatic attitude that's what self-righteous does it brings a looking down your nose and because you're looking at something well i'm doing this that's not the righteousness we're talking about we're talking about a righteousness on the inside that you recognize i didn't put this there god put it there doesn't mean that we they're not talking about compromising with sin i'm talking about a righteousness that on the inside could look and it's not looking at what i've done or what i do but it's looking at the grace of god and to know that god's grace that has been applied to my life what god did for me you do for anybody and if there's something somebody's not seeing and we see they're not seeing it we know that god is able to guide them we've got confidence that that's my brother that's my sister that's the son of god that's the daughter of god and we've got confidence that they can be led by the holy ghost matthew 5 48 jesus said be you therefore perfect man that's a big call even as not not that some way not not part of the way not a little bit but even as to the same degree as your father which is in heaven is perfect now if i ask all throughout this congregation is anybody in here perfect in one way you couldn't raise your hand but if we're talking about his lies his life coming in you that's different we can say we are perfect in him but as far as perfect in myself but i'm always hitting the mark every day every no that's not the perfection i'm talking about we're talking about the perfection of his life so the high calling paul would write about is is god's own perfect life his righteousness coming in us by the baptism of the holy ghost it places us in him it's the perfection of his own life that life that was within that blood cell now it comes upon you and this is where paul would write and testify the life i now live see he lived a different life before paul lived the life remember pharisee of the pharisees you weren't gonna touch that guy's life that guy was right on the mark but notice there is a life he received that was contrary to the life he was living this life he said the life i now live so he lived a different life in the past this life he said i now live by this power of divine revelation what was that the the i live by the faith of the love of god who gave himself for me see what the love of god coming in by divine revelation it presents to you and i a life that has been surrendered a life that is sacrificial a life that has been given and when that revelation of jesus christ is come into our hearts what does it do it brings forth a sacrificial life from you and me sacrificial now let me say sacrificial according to the word according to the word so here paul comes in second corinthians 5 21 and paul would write you know within this measure and he would say for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him this is god's work becoming the righteousness of god is not your work it's god's work he presented he came an order that we might come into the righteousness of god his spirit come into you and i he has provided he is jehovah jireh hallelujah this is why paul would write in hebrews chapter 6 verse 1 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god in other words paul was saying a cycle of repentance where it's the same thing you need to go on see it's a call let us go on so if the call is let us go on to perfection there is a place of perfection for you and i that we can come to paul being a messenger the prophet in that age he is gifted as a prophet to have eyes that catch up into the realm of the word and see there is a place just like when moses was standing there and god could say moses come here there is a place by me a place by me god sends his word and his word reveals christ and reveals there is a place by him a place where we can come to perfection listen you're perfection where i'll never make a mistake that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a perfection of his lies not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward notice faith towards god is it necessary faith is necessary he that cometh to god must first believe that he is and he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him is that right of the doctrine of baptism is it necessary to repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ sure it is all of those are necessary step but they're dead works and of laying on our hands even praying for the sick paul says great glory we're going to keep we're laying on hands on the sick and the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment paul is not doing away with any of that and he says and this will we do if god permit so there's got to be a start it's just like we see new ones coming in here there's got to be a start there's got to be that which is presented the gospel presented that lives might move into that place of repentance to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ but with the objective to go on to perfection which is to be filled with the holy ghost perfection is not coming to a church that preaches the perfect word amen come on we've received the perfect interpretation in this hour that's not enough just to come where it's at you've got to receive the direction of the word see what the word is saying there is a place of perfection the word reveals that place it unfolds the path the promise the path of glory you shall surely find it unfolds that pathway to be sons and daughters of almighty god hallelujah you see perfection speaks of completion when you see this in the scripture it speaks of completion completion completion remember the bible says as god in the days of creation god labored for six days he labored for six days and remember there he renters in the seventh day has gone all his works were finished in six days he entered into that seventh day we could really preach here on the seventh seal and these things you see with the time we're living in the hour we're living in and to recognize we're not living under a word of justification we're not living under a word of sanctification we're not living under word of just baptism of the holy ghost we are living under the word where it is that of the son of man reproducing himself the fullness of christ coming in to a bright body this is the end time where god promised that in the sounding of the seventh angel's message that the mystery of god what is the mystery of god it's the outpouring of the holy ghost that god making up his body down through the ages feet legs hear the torso on up it's the spirit of god not man not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the lord how is the body the bride body how has it been built it's been built by the word and it holds upon the same pedestal as the original masterpiece abraham election right isaac love jacob grace joseph perfection that's the pedestal of which the body wrestles we're resting in the elective love and grace of his perfection this is our rest you see this is the ground we're standing on i didn't choose myself he chose me i love him because he first loved me not by works that i've done but by the grace of god i'm standing here we have received grace that we might serve him acceptably and it is not my perfection it's his perfection inside of me glory so it's the hour that we're living and we're not preaching uh when we are here and remember the inspiration on the word does not just take us i want to say this in the right measure it just doesn't take us to where many of the nominal christians they simply or can just they'll look back to calvary but remember they failed to recognize there that god who became flesh he is present to identify what he did there in you and me because just to put it back there it it it leaves out that he's the same it leaves out the same life it leaves out the purpose which is redemption it takes us into that place of perfection now so we recognize that the bride of jesus christ i believe i'm speaking to a portion of her she's standing on her feet are you with me she's born of his bone life of his life come on adam's bride didn't come from somewhere else adam's bride came from him when is the bride of jesus christ come sup the word from his life right bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life she is his perfection in bright form [Music] his achievement his workmanship hebrews 9 11 christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building perfect tabernacle yet it was made in the likeness of sinful flesh but it was not authored through sex neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once unto the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us this is the beginning of the creation of god notice hebrews 10 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then they would would then they not then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have had no more conscience or desire of sin they covered it was forgiveness but the desire was still there you're with me this is why paul as he goes on hebrews 7 19 for the law made nothing perfect righteousness of the pharisees could not put a finger on their law on their life but that righteousness does not gain entrance remember they crucified jesus by their own righteousness paul picks it up in romans they sought not the righteousness of god by faith they sought it by works and seeking it by works they failed oh my yes this is why as god as he deals with our hearts deals with our life the righteousness of god listen you can't make yourself good enough i wish i could preach a long time on this that doesn't mean that you just sat around with your arms crossed and well you know just to have to be god to do it no it's faith in his word and applying that to your life and watch it take effect faith what does it faith faith god will testify of his work hebrews 9 13 for if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of the heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctified to the purifying of the flesh see all this was tight all of this was right in the old testament and what was given there was types that would speak of the redemptive work uh through calvary through the lord jesus christ now where it's no longer a type but it becomes the antitype the heifer was burnt was taken was killed burnt without the camp ashes were mixed in clean water had to be a clean man to bring it right right had to be one to catch that revelation that's beyond the camp come on it cannot be just a man you see this is why if people limited to the body of jesus christ well that's the clean man he came and paid the price but remember through that he sanctifies other vessels that then threw their lives through those seven stars in his hand they themselves come into that place to let you and i know let's go beyond the camp it calls us what out of tradition out of dogma out of creed it calls us out of our own thinking what is it there's a voice that that star receives god spoke to the messenger in this hour and what does it do it reveals the godhead it reveals jesus christ it reveals there is a place beyond the camp of our thinking in him see somebody goes beyond and comes back to tell us what's there how much more look at that how much more shall the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to god purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living god see the spirit of god is calling to that of the scriptures you know i'm pulling from here is out of the hebrews paul is dividing the law in grace he's letting him know that just coming to church he's letting him know just dead works and i'm let me i believe in coming to church but just things that are are just you've went through things you've come along and mine doing pretty good and my no no we don't want dead works let's go on to perfection to where it removes from your works to christ in you working amen amen amen dead works is reflected at what took place around cadiz barnea they walked around the same mountain for 40 years why god didn't make them do that that was their own belief unbelief will keep you growing in circles what must i do throw it down that's simple oh i need hands laying on you don't need hands laid on you you need to have faith in the word and say god i lay it down see many times that's why people don't get deliverance they've got faith in the man talks about a a lady who's in and it's a faith in his faith i think his faith is our victory who smokes cigarettes oh he said she'd come to the altar and cry god i need to be free of these cigarettes he said we would pray with her he said you'd see her about a week later she'd about knock you down with cigarette breath but it got to a time in her life she got struck with cancer brother brown said then about that time he said he went to pray for he said we went to pray for he said she got down to business he said what she did notice it wasn't that god gave her faith brother brown says she changed her faith from in the branham tabernacle changed it from in william branham and she put it where it needed to be in the beginning in jesus christ the ministry the prophet all of that is to point you to one person and that's jesus christ [Music] [Applause] god hallelujah men but our faith is in god not the man his person amen hebrews 10 21 and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near how many knows we need a high priest still when he changes his garments from lamb to lion that's when we'll change until that very moment we need the lamb we need the lamb interceding on our behalf it's not just about what we do wrong not just about mistakes that's such a very limited small minut view but the working of the high priest is to minister those things on our behalf or in other words minister to you and i what he has already done and what lays in you and i and you and i begin to recognize oh that leaf is in me oh that bushel of apples is in me and then we go to him and say lord be it unto me according to thy word and what are we doing we are confessing what his word has confessed and he is the high priest of our confession is that right so now this is why let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water paul was not speaking of that this body paul speaking of the washing of water by the word that loosens us from that first nature amen it takes the old man out by what watching of regeneration renewing of the holy ghost it's one and the same it's the sovereign work of the holy ghost you see this is why when the seed of the word is on the inside uh you know there's a there there is only one thing that can quicken that seed and that's the holy ghost but in order for the holy ghost the quickening power to come there must be the right filter a filter of justification will not quicken the seed all right it is any work of the holy ghost person feels relieved oh my sins i praise god that's a wonderful thing you see the the filter of just sanctification by the blood it will not in this hour it will not quicken the blood it will not quicken to see it's got to be the word that matches the word on the inside amen that's why a message of just oh praise god the restoration of the gifts it will not quicken the seed oh brother samuel you ought to see how so-and-so is so gifted and mind what they can do in the message a prisoner brother ram said don't you ever judge your life by how much demonstrations and all this that you can do you judge it by the fruits that is brought forth by their fruits not by their healings not by their preaching not by their speaking in tongues not by their prophesy not by anything else but by their fruits you shall know them is that right so then we find it's got to be a filter one more what kind of filter must it be it must be a word filter this is why god once again why god would send a message in this hour because a denominational filter it can it'll still allow sin to remain there a person brother bran brings us down the message perfection he said they can be free of desire but if it's still nature it's still condemned so you can take a person and say well i ain't never desired to look at this or do this or do that i never but by nature you're still condemned right by nature many of the people can exhibit many of the virtues that peter would write of by the spirit of god but it's not by natural exhibition of patience and long-suffering no no these these virtues that peter writes about the spirit of god these are virtues that are not virtues that come out in times of peace they are virtues that come out in times of war in times of adversity in times where it gets awful hard on this guy but this is where the light shines the brightest anybody raising your hand say god let it be times of war in me lord let it be times and no you ain't being truthful and we're not saying that we don't want to say oh god bring on the trout no no no but yet we know that it's in those times of adversity is where growth takes place and we need that but you see this is something that we look at this here that this filter it has to be that there is a word that the spirit of god is able to travel through that word so that here as as we would take that word in it comes down into our soul what does the word the preaching of the word brings the holy ghost not just quoting the preaching the preaching of the word the inspiration of god it brings there the holy ghost on the scene and that heart on the inside it's drawing it's drawing what is it it's a son or a daughter of god that's been there the whole time but you need a filter a real word filter because only a word filter will allow the quickening power of god to come down and quicken your life this is why we've been summonsed by the voice of god vindicated by god amen we've been summoned to god by his voice god had a vessel in this earth behold i sent unto elijah one who could go beyond the camp god took him beyond the camp to do what called you and i out of the camp amen amen call us into a real relationship a real union with jesus christ because the truth be known there's nothing else that will satisfy a son and daughter of god i could preach this to her go out here he can go out on the internet and people can say i'm gent i'm fine but through a real son and daughter of god there's something about it they're drawing on that word and say god take me higher lord take me deeper lord take me deeper and you lord i want to go higher this is why paul comes around in colossians 2 9 for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and you are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power known as complete perfection where in him in whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of this flesh once again he's speaking of the nature that nature there's been a circumcision right amen circumcision requires a sharp knife butter knives won't do it won't do it match that you know those sharp things that you you know put the cake icing on and make it you know all nice and that won't do it it's got to be a sharp knife when they crossed into the land told joshua make sharp knives why the circumcision is a sign not so much to god it was a sign to them to know him in the covenant and everything that god has said i have access to i'm identified in the covenant that's why that faith when it's recognized by god he seals you with the holy ghost praise the lord by the circumcision of christ buried with him in baptism wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of god who hath raised him from the dead so we walked with him in the waters of baptism identified with him in his death burial and resurrection what that you through faith the operation of god not my operation not a church operation but the operation of god you see this is why he comes and he speaks to your heart this is why he appears in these services this is why he comes by his word why it's to bring forth the operation of god a pastor can do it a church can do it but him coming can cause your faith to rise to a place to say he's the same he's speaking to me these are my promises and i say if there's anything if there's uh listen to me if there's unconfessed sin and you know it's unconfessed don't expect god to move over top of that you've got to confess and repent and separate yourself amen somebody help me preach now that's faith in god we could pray for you for a month of sundays but if there's unconfessed sin god ain't crossing over that you don't want that you don't want that because if god crosses over unconfessed sin and does that for you you'll continue in that same way and that is not perfection god wants you to be free amen amen walking in liberty this is why paul's he would go on first corinthians 1 verse 30 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us wisdom he is our wisdom not our wisdom he is our wisdom he is my righteousness he is my sanctification he's the oil in the dove he's the oil that moves out of my life when sticky situations come he's the oil that moves out of my life when it's not saying entrap but there's a life there's an oil on the inside it's not coming somewhere else it's an oil on the inside that purifies what does that the perfection of his life it's the perfection of his life that says go make that right right it's the perfection of his life it says drop that amen attitude when is that it's a perfection of his life if he listen to me how could he how could he have been the lamb of god and not fulfill every part of the word he couldn't have done it so because it was god come down and dwell in that body and that same god living inside of you and i he will not let one part go unnoticed in our life if there's something a little slacking he'll bring us right in step when is that that's perfection amen colossians 3 3 for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ in god when christ who is our life he is our life he's everything he's our all in all see this is deeper than just somebody saying i love god amen truly they can love god but if it's still the world in their life and they're dwelling there in that part and still everything else then it's not the love of god dwelling in them it's them loving god by their spirit their intellect this scripture is he is our life in other words he's not just something that's out here this is where he's at everything revolves around him amen should i take this job revolves around him everything comes through him he is the north star of our life amen amen praise the lord glory be to god notice this is the promise when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory you see guard god clear back in the time of the exodus what was it that released the people from egypt many signs and wonders were done right but signs and wonders didn't release them signs and wonders were not just there to build faith but the signs and wonders were there for god to show himself now moses god through moses ministry it was god declaring never mind my man couldn't do this but what did that do it hardened pharaoh's heart god revealing himself making himself known so much to where you know pharaoh would say oh his god is god and i'll call him to take away the pledge see it was known there is one in egypt greater than all the gods of egypt but did it soften pharaoh no it hardened him amen but it led up to the night of the exodus god said take a lamb slay the lamb put the blood on the doorpost eat the lamb inside your dwelling and when i see the blood amen i will pass over you when i see what was the blood the blood was now the indication where they had received the word here come a ah they had a delivering sign of circumcision but moving on there in the word the blood had to be applied the blood being applied now death could not come in to that amen hole who it would come after is the firstborn but the blood spares the life of the firstborn it wasn't enough just because they were first born but you had to be away that the firstborn could escape judgment oh my i'm just going to stay focused here how can we get off and preach on that on strength but it had to be a blood and this is what god has said when i see the blood you see listen to me the holy ghost and this is for everyone to apply this remember the holy ghost just does not come and baptize somebody and put them into the body of christ if they're not applying the word amen that's contrary to scripture take the lamb slaver bud jesus said if you love me keep my commandments you keep my commandments then my father and i will come and make our abode you can't expect the holy ghost if you're not applying the word amen so what is the blood you say i can't apply the blood yes you can jesus said my words are spirit and life it's not that blood that blood chemistry went right back into the ground from calvary it wouldn't matter if you had a little vial of that blood it couldn't do nothing for you right now it paid the debt but now the blood is now represented and tied in to the spirit because the blood itself was shed but now the spirit comes to sound out a jubilee call and let you know there is blood on the mercy seat there is blood that has a cone for you you can come back to your inheritance they were in the field slaving away they did not see the blood on the mercy seat but there was a priest that rode throughout the land and the sounding was synchronized with the blood that was offered so the blood the sounding of the voice the light the life the word it is god coming and when we take the word what is the blood it is the spirit revealed word that's why pentecost don't get anywhere they think pentecost is just coming and getting under an emotion it takes the word the word brings atmosphere genesis 1 the word brings creation the word comes with purpose the word comes with vision the word comes with clarity is that right you see the word has got to be applied amen i'm encouraging you by the spirit of god that no matter where you are new middle old no matter where you are you cannot expect god to do anything for you if you're not willing to apply the blood that's right don't let them in the message be medicine on the shelf humble yourself and take it if it says take one pill every 12 hours humble yourself and take and be right on the mark i'm going to set a timer for this here what is it you're putting value you've got to want you've got to want the holy ghost you've got to want to be united with god amen it's not it's not god being angry it's god trying to let you know let's go on to perfection let's stop making the same footprints around the same mountain let's go on to perfection let's stop coming to the altar and repenting for the same thing let's go on to perfection what must i do lay [Applause] [Music] for by one offering look how paul places this for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified now paul's not speaking just of where a person comes to sanctification to where the desires leave their life that's sanctification but he's talking about sanctified sainted ones those who are full of the holy ghost what does that mean i mean i don't have to have another offering i'm identified with my offering here here he is seated on the mercy seat of god on the throne of god he is seated in power until all of his enemies it be made manifest that every enemy is under his feet he's seated in power though we see not all things but yet he's already amen and when you and i have been raised in him by the holy ghost we are seated sons and daughters of god as the prophet would put it sin is beneath you hallelujah it's beneath you by one offering we are kept clean right we're kept clean by one offering because the life of our sacrifice has come inside of you and i you see remember when god when god was speaking in ezekiel when he was speaking there in uh jeremiah paul picks it up in hebrews where it says the days shall come i will make a new covenant not as the covenant i made with my father the fathers ended the whole day when i took them by the hand and let them out of egypt but this covenant i will make with them i will write my laws into their mind i will i will write them i will play them in the mind i'll put them upon the tables of their heart and i will be their god what i will be that visible living reality that's pulsating in their life where it was before in the old testament they had the law here and the blood here but god is saying this will be one jesus said i and my father are one lawgiver dwelling in that of the lamb the law would have killed us brother brian but there was a lamb standing there to intercede on our behalf so now it's no longer two heavens and earth have joined together mercy and grace have met for what now the issue of his life which is the lawgiver himself which is the righteousness of god it's issued forth to the believer you have his law his life his nature that portion of him that belonged to you from the for the foundation of the world this is your inheritance and joshua has divided to you your inheritance first john 3 4. john writes whosoever committeth sin that word committeth means a practicer from nature or desire practices sin transgresseth also the law for sin is the transgression of the law so when john's not writing not he's not talking about a mistake he's talking about practice verse 5 and you know that he was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin you see the ministry the ministry that's sounding out this is why trumpets this is why down through the ages after revelation is given it starts getting off there's a sounding going on but that sounding doesn't bring certainty hallelujah because why it becomes it becomes man blowing his ideas and it doesn't gather people to christ it gathers people to the man gathers it to the idea gathers it to the organization and in that there is no power i'm not talking about miracles inside i'm talking about the power of a life that the pardon brings hallelujah that's what i'm talking about hallelujah it comes with that he comes to take away that's why the gospel when the gospel is sound he can hack an ear in every one of the church ages he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit not the church it's not a church revelation not a group revelation not a collective revelation this is an individual revelation let him hear what the spirit says it's astounding what is the sound they do it's a sounding of the the atonement himself that is sounding through that ministry calling the people into that place of redemption all respond no because not all are sons and daughters of god there are some as in every age they're saved they gone for that i don't look down on that right because no more than i can look up or look down my nose look where we're at no it's god's grace i didn't do this it's not that i just did and no i didn't bring myself here neither did you but to recognize why we are where we're at and be able to respond and to hear the word of god is because we were a seed of god all along what is that grace grace it would have bypassed us long time ago oh by the time you know my mind it when your mind caught it was that that's the seed on the inside god don't set down in your flesh body he done sat down in your spirit he sets down in that which belongs to him that's that soul that's at sea gene that's a germ of god that's the one that can receive melchizedek that's the one who recognizes him it's the inner man on the inside you know what i'm talking about your flesh and spirit still gives you trouble come on your flesh and spirit will still echo the words of the liar well you're not one of them you're not this so you're not that you'll never be there you never but you see there's a token that's come to your life a perfection that you can stand there and say i've already received a voice that has roared in my life that says you belong to me you're mine what is it he's claiming his property [Applause] and just as the roar claims that so the roar will claim this body [Applause] i tell you what man i don't know what to do brother william i feel like i'm back in africa maybe i need to come down here and dance a little bit but i'm saying you're in the flesh absolutely a son of god that's making his flesh be obedient to the word a son of god that says let me borrow your feet i need to dance a little bit a son of god that says let me boil your hands i need to clap a little bit a son of garbage says let me bother your mouth i need to shout a little bit what is it it's the son and daughter of god rejoicing in the glory we had with him before the foundation of the world a perfection of his life let's just stop here i won't be able to lay that other point in perfection but somehow i make so many mistakes i hear the prophet of god in the message believing god he said don't ever get your eyes or your thinking as though that you're ever going to perfect this he said before this can ever be perfected when is this going to be perfected at the change of the body it first must be the spirit of god on the inside that will bring it in subjection maybe i'm just a simple guy by the way maybe i'm not real you know i know people think well this guy's got a master degree that'll make me smart that just means because i relied on god a lot that ain't to puff me up i'm just that this is how i feel it shows there are thoughts there are things that will come right at this it doesn't mean oh my i'll come to a place i'll never have a thought of hatred arise no don't try to perfect this that's when you get down and discouraged but bringing in subjection when it starts to rise there's a new king in the kingdom there's a new king in the kingdom that says not in my reign and it isn't like we're saying oh god but i wanna no on the inside what does it do it's a son of god we're no longer covered over by darkness but it's in those moments where the greatness of his power displays that you know it's him and him alone amen what is that it's perfection it's no longer your struggle or my struggle it's no longer what i'm trying to do it's not even about how many days can i attach together oh my five days no this perfection goes beyond the keeping of days keeping of sabbaths and new moons it comes into a place to where our soul is in eternity body is still in time soul is in eternity body is still in time this is why the body can get sick but the soul that soul can no more die than god could die that soul is sealed away perfection listen you don't know sometimes the battles that i go through but if that perfection of his life is seated there it's not just that you're free from the desires of the world but it's where he is your life your desire is to please him amen as a matter of fact if something gets out of line or whatever you'll feel like what why don't seem like it just seems like something's missing you know what that is it's a spirit of god as it moves there in your life what's he doing he's calling you back because remember you shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god we were not made to walk in this life and say well i'll just live things by my own life no we were made that our life might be regulated and under the control and the leadership of the holy spirit and this is where his grace comes in you see that's not our perfection if we look at it in terms of our perfection we would think man i never wrong i never have to be corrected no no it's the perfection of his life that will respond to the perfection of him who is the word because it is not the word and the spirit two separate things it is the word and the spirit wrapped up inside of you it is perfection his perfect life and if you don't have that this morning i'll tell you the whole the whole ministering of the word is an invitation for you to receive them we don't receive it by law it isn't it isn't a preacher saying i tell you you must receive the holy ghost jesus said you must be born again but it was not in a manner of that of law to where you come with the slave mentality he's letting it be known this is a necessary requirement for one to even see the kingdom of god for one to enter the kingdom of god but brother brown will tell us at the ending of the message of the token he said he comes in by love he said love brings courtship love brings marriage he said just as simple as this right here he said if you can just say from your heart lord he said i let everything of the world go but some of you understand i'm sitting in church right now look you could kick everything else out at home but if you don't kick it out here it'll come right back but right here the power of god is able to do a work here that when you get home what you have applied the word here it'll take care of itself at home it'll be right in line with what you have come in line with the word right here and falling in love with him bill brown said he comes in by love he said you make that that place and say lord i'm done with the unbelieving i apply the word to my life lord jesus i want you to have the preeminence i want you to have the center most seat in my life and brother braham says you watch he goes on to sing we love him because he first loved us he said you sense that sweet tender soft feeling coming into you right now that is the holy ghost what is it it's surrender in love where you come to the place to say this man love brings courtship into where you finally come to a place say i want to spend the rest of my life with this man the rest of my days matter of fact you know like my mom you know her my my my papo brown as she and my papa brown told my dad when they he was talking with them about getting married he told my dad he said is that the face you want to wake up and see every morning he said cause we don't believe in divorce see what courtship does it's him ruling to your heart he's one to your heart and you say it's the man i want to wake up and see every morning i want to see jesus when i wake up i want to see jesus through the day i want to see jesus at night i want to see jesus what is it it's the desire for union and when that union takes place oh sure there's tests there's trials there's disappointments bill abraham said he's broken my heart many times but i love him for it it's where he seats in perfection don't you love him let's go our heads i'm going to pray we're going to pray together god knows your need he knows your heart but we realize this service we're not just it's not just been a service that we come to like it's not no service we come to just to come to fulfill time but god would speak to our hearts if that would be your earnest request today just let it be known to the lord maybe there's another need upon your heart maybe a need upon your heart to say lord help me lord jesus help me to be more insensitive maybe there's something where you've kind of went astray not that you went out into the world but maybe there's things that got kind of off target in your life you got a little cool you got a little cold and then the enemy slips in and starts condemning you and pointing out every kind of accusation listen what should i do i'll tell you what the word invites us to do he said if we confess our sin he's faithful and just to forgive us the bible points out that we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous he is the prophetion for our sins and not our sins only but the sins of the [Music] world i wonder how many would like to be remembered in prayer this morning as we go to the lord in prayer god bless you god bless you let's pray together let's pray together and let's just not pray together let's believe together let's believe let's really listen really believe [Music] lord jesus behind these hands our honest hearts those lord that are right there in their living room that's right here as well father i ask right now lord that you would just minister to that need in a special way father that hand going up it defied gravity want god to have faith to say lord i believe it's you i believe lord there is perfection that you are calling me to other hands the lord would go up lord i want to come back into fellowship they hadn't lost their covenant but maybe they're out of fellowship with you lord i pray heavenly father that whatever that need is lord god may every heart be so inclined with love the love of god you're calling you're cooing you're bidding you're drawing you're wooing to our hearts lord may they just open up and lord god as they're praying in their hearts they make their petition known i asked the lord god that you would just move down for their lives in a real special way father fill those with the holy ghost that need that lord that need that perfection lord in their life to be brought into that perfection of the blood cell to where lord jesus you hear our voice
