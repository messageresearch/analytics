I thank you amen amen we I want to just say thank you Lord amen thank you for his Mercy amen you know I so appreciated last night and I want to just say uh for brother Shane and putting all that together and all of the labor that went in with the musicians young people coming together and there was a lot of time that I know that they spent throughout the week and times leading up to that as well as the arrangement for it I I enjoyed it amen uh I really enjoyed it it was something that I I do believe that we we will definitely be doing again and uh I just uh I so I enjoyed it in many ways I enjoyed it in one way that I just opened in prayer and that was it I just got to enjoy I so appreciate that of the the burden and I want to just say say that once again that brother Shane we really appreciated it really appreciated that amen and all of the the testimonies that were shared um they were all so so important and so impactual and I I couldn't help but you know there are things that uh I grabbed brother Randy last night he he grabbed me we we were standing there and I said um he said I'll see you tomorrow night I said yeah I said yep I said said we'll be here tomorrow night and and we were talking about last year when brother Trevor was here and and um brother Randy said I got so much tonight he said all I need is a pull pit you know it's just things that how God so inspires our hearts you know and I I want to just say I really the things I was praying even this morning and I thought about that testimony that sister Stephanie was given and I I looked at that and I thought Lord how when the statement she was making about remember her neighbor and how he was so obstinate hearing her streaming and not just the streaming of the of you know the services but just was really well not a real likable person but this is to me what I what I what was the key it it wasn't so much the outcome out of that I rejoiced in what I rejoiced was is what was caught in her heart is Lord take the chip off of my shoulder you see sometimes we're so interested in praying about change this other person and God said they're there to irritate to rub oh because you know a pearl can only be made when you put a grain of sand in that oyster and then that irritation it just keeps on covering that you know and uh I don't believe that we are to be we're irritants to one another we're brothers and sisters but I believe that you know God knows what he's doing when he brings us together you know it takes I said it like this I'm not the speaker this morning but you know what it takes a real commitment and a responsibility to have a home church right it does because it's like a family you've got to work through things you've got to look you've got to be able to look past things you've got to be able to work with one another we're living in an age right now an age that absolutely takes no responsibility for anything and wants no commitment least a little bit of problem see you we're living in that kind of a time but I'm thankful there's a resource for each of Our Lives to say Lord I don't in myself have the answer but you're the answer he's the answer you know some times in the midst of our moments when we we get frustrated remember frustration itself is not the result of seeking the Lord frustration is the result of us not seeking him because when you seek him you're you're coming to a place of committal even in your heart and your spirit and you're letting God move for your heart move for your life and prepare you so that you can see him in the answer that he has for your life God is so good so good and I I just I want to say I'm so grateful to have uh the emans here with us brother Trevor sister Anna May uh brother Azariah and of course brother Zion I don't know where they're at they've been on all sides of this platform but I appreciate the brother Zion and brother Azariah they made the trip up here on Friday after getting off work to be a part of last night and and Saturday and so I really appreciate that amen really really appreciate that and we just want to pull on the gift of God God knows what we have need of I'm this is the god that we know if it's just one need that God would call this service for God will do it God doesn't need crowds all he needs needs is available hearts and I believe we've got we've come here this morning because we're we're a needy people Lord I have needs there's may be questions I have there's things that I need unraveling that only you can go down and unravel I'm glad he's that kind of God aren't you I'm glad he's not looking at like we do sometimes with fishing line and we say cut it start fresh but God can go down and unravel everything in our lives and what's powerful he don't tell you or me do it he comes and does it as we'll just yield to him let's just invite him say Lord I invite you right here to my Pew come set by me matter of fact Lord right here in my heart help me Lord I just want to open my heart to receive you Lord not try to figure it out just let the word come in and let the word just transform let the word just take effect in my life Lord As we sing this song again as brother Trevor come and I that Thank You song um I really appreciate brother Trevor I've I've to me I've I've been uh I really enjoy his ministry I really enjoy the gift I enjoy all the uniqueness that God has and I tell you in this even in the past few years we've seen a lot of diversity within gifts right here in our assembly and I think the one one thing when you all that you see is when it all comes down to it if you can see Jesus through every gift that's amen and I want to say I really appreciate that with with brother Trevor and so we just want to without any further Ado I want him to come have his Liberty also tonight at 5:30 the youth service amen could we just stand brother Paul go ahead and lead us Grace you have given us oh I could never repay but from my heart I would like to say that I I thank you thank you Jesus oh thank you I thank you Jesus for for the grace that you have given us oh I could never repay but from my heart I would like to say that I that I thank [Music] you we want to say thank you oh thank you Jesus for the grace that you have GI us I could never rep but from my heart I'd like to say that I I thank you [Music] amen it's an amazing grace that he's given to us amen and that's what we're thanking him for amen what an amazing grace you can be seated for a moment I just thought maybe I'd sing a another song here if that'd be all right almost now we haven't practice this in some time but we'll have the general idea of a song anyhow amen I just felt this song is um I've sang it a few times it's always been an encouragement to people and just thinking here kind of in the New Year time and and it's so cold you know that there is coming a land that we're going to where will be much closer to 70° fahit than whatever the temperature is this morning but not only that not just that it will be a wonderful time physically but that there will be so much more because it will be everything that is the heart of God for us that's the way it will be because God wants us to be comfortable it won't be Zer degrees because God wants the best for us there's so the the the love the joy the peace the no tears all of that is coming and it's coming because an its expression of God's heart glory to God that he has for each one of us and to me that's what I I feel that this song is is just saying is that we're almost home just keep going it's going to be worth it amen you [Music] disappointed are you desperate for hell know what it's like to be tired and only a shell of yourself you start to believe you don't have what it takes cuz it's all you can do just to move let's finish the [Music] race but don't forget what lies ahead almost home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone oh with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pra blessing on we are almost homeall this road will be hard but we win in the end simply because of Jesus and us it's not if but when so take joy in the journey even when it feels long oh find strength in each step Heaven is cheering you on we are all most home brother it won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone oh with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing we are almost home almost home almost home oh oh I know that the cross has brought heaven to us but make no mistake there's still more to come when our flesh and our bone are no longer beet where we are right now and where we're meant to be when all that's been lost is made whole again when these tears and this pain no longer exists no more walking we're running as fast as we can consider this our second way almost home brother won't be long soon all your burdens will be gone oh when with all your strength sister run on your free hold up your head keep pressing on we are almost whole almost whole almost oh oh we are almost home amen amen amen we have something to be excited about we have a land we're going to this isn't just toiling this isn't just trying to do right there's a land we're headed to there's a goal in sight we're almost home friends amen thank you musicians appreciate you all very much enjoy the spirit of the Lord that we feel together if you would we'll just get into the the the preaching of the service now we'll just stand with me and we'll turn on our Bibles to the Book of Genesis Genesis chapter 1 and verse one in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth amen very simple very basic this is how all of it started I mean we got we got nothing else if we don't have this okay and so then we start to understand though that that there was a there was an action but there had to be a Cause right I don't want to get too philosophical here but God we you don't do anything you know you don't you don't pick up a bottle of water unless first you think I would like to take a drink of water there was a desire there first before the action came all right so then God so God has this action of creating the heavens and earth and creating everything and so we can begin to say so but we should be able to find in scripture the why amen so turn now to Genesis 2 and verse 18 Deuteronomy 218 the Lord God said it is not good that man should live should be alone I will make him and help meet for him so God decided Adam was alone and he didn't want Adam to be alone why didn't God want Adam to be alone how did God this is a tough one I know but how did God know and the word know can be very playful but how did God know that it wasn't good for Adam to be alone well brother Trevor he's God he kind of knows stuff but but but it's deeper than that right it's deeper than that he just intellectually knows he can see oh it wouldn't yeah I mean I've kind of played out the scenarios and Adam Adam will do much better if there's someone with him versus being alone is that it or is there something inside of God that knows do we begin to find the reason of Genesis 1:1 here in Genesis 2:18 let's also turn to Deuteronomy I'll let you be seated here in just a moment Deuteronomy 318 the Lord he it is that doth go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed okay one more here Hebrews chapter 13 and verse 5 and it says let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he hath said so here we have the writer of Hebrews which we believe to be Paul quoting Deuteronomy 31 I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so even in a new testament era we still believe this is surprise surprise a promise that God has for us it's not just Old Testament this is New Testament it's not just any Testament it is because of the purpose of God's creation amen I want to speak to you on a subject a very one-word title of alone it is not good that man should live alone can we just go to the Lord in prayer father as we look to your word as we look to uh to you Lord we want to understand you more father we want to know your heart oh God and then father we want to after looking at that just a little bit father we want this mirror lord of the word of of who you are Lord we want to then compare our lives in that image because we're created in your image and father we want to be uh Lord we want there be to be no Distortion in the image as we look in you at you in the mirror Lord we want the edges to be clean and clear Lord Jesus we we want the picture to be a a perfect reflection of your life and your heart your desires Lord may they be our desires s the way you see others may we see others the same Lord the way you love may we love father we want to know you that we might become you oh god father we know that you don't leave us to this on our own and our own strength and our own devices but Lord that your spirit has come you've given us a new birth Lord that we might seek to that and be changed Lord by by a a a new birth Lord by by coming in the same way in the flesh that you came oh God and so Lord I pray that that if there's anyone here that has not experienced that new birth father may you move on their hearts Lord Jesus to to die to self and to be born again in in you father fill us with your spirit Lord we give this service to you and we ask Lord that you would give utterance Lord for the word in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we'll set the timer as I always say not because I actually adhere to it but at least it tells me how bad I'm doing amen that's it's comforting to know that the preacher at least has something flashing red at him um to tell him lunch is being served soon but um at least I feel that way I don't know so amen so alone it is not good that man should live alone Genesis 1:26 God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air over the cattle over the Earth over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so so God creates and you know he creates a world he creates heavens and earth he he creates this this planet that we live on and then he begins to divide the land from the water and he he puts a uh he puts a a a well there's light and then at some point in time he even puts that light into the Sun and into the stars and the various places and he begins to develop all of this and then he puts fish in the in the seas and and birds in the air and he puts animals on the ground and he creates mosquitoes for some reason and you know and they were perfect at one time don't really know how that worked but we're going to find out we're almost home um and what a perfect mosquito is and how its purpose and and all of that will be very uh enlightening someday to us um if you should care to to want to know about that but um you know uh and and and so and so and so God you know and then he comes to Kangaroos and he stops creating is that true okay he comes to elephants and he stops and he says it is good wasn't enough yet was it man there was mosquitoes there was Birds there was kangaroos there was elephants and we had a a little Zoo going on in the Garden of Eden and still wasn't enough for him God was not yet satisfied why was God not yet satisfied right it could only be because the the the actual purpose of his creation had not yet been expressed the the action of Genesis 1:1 that it hasn't been complete it hasn't completely yet satisfied the desire that was in the heart of God that he was Express that the action come because of something inside that he wanted there was a desire on the inside of God though God was look God was awesome God was everything he was Alpha Omega he was a toz everything that was cool everything that was wonderful everything that was you know right I and holy and awesome God was it I mean if you wanted somebody that was it God was it and yet he still creates he creates and then he gets to Kangaroos and he still creates it's not enough yet the desire hasn't been satisfied but he gets to man and he creat creates man in his own image and after he creates man he steps back and says it is good it's good and then he stops he didn't stop after kangaroos but he stops after man the you know look I can I can I I want a drink of water I I take a drink of water now I've stopped why because the desire has been satisfied so God's desire for man for for his Fellowship has now been satisfied the inside of God who knows that it's not good for Adam to live alone it's not just knowledge it's not just his for knowledge to play out scenarios and figure out well it'll go better this way because I'm Eternal and I just I know things you know but no God knew at a deeper level than just knowing things he knew it on a desire higher level that it's not good for him to be alone on this Earth because he because the very Act of me creating him is expressing that I do not want to be alone so I know that if I wanted to express someone Adam will want to express someone Adam will want to have someone there to impact and to know are we is this okay are we are we together here now now now I'm I'm not I'm I'm I'm saying things that aren't you know written out in scripture but I am saying things that are revealed plainly by scripture if you just think about it for a moment so we as we said here God said it's not good that man should be alone I will make a helpmate for him so so there's this God knows this he knows that man is going to want someone to be with and he knows this because he knows he was not content being all of it yet he still creates and didn't stop at kangaroos all right he wanted man so so God creates man and so then we can begin to recognize here and like I said this Genesis 2118 like it is it is almost the predicate like you know creation comes and if and and our first couple of chapters of of Genesis our beginning story we we we it's like okay that's that's the beginning right amen that's and this is in the beginning God did this right okay so this is the beginning but then we get to the why which is actually before the beginning yes sir right and so so that man should not live alone is a is God showing in natural type what he is Desiring in the spiritual and Supernatural realm we have the natural we have the supernatural so so Genesis 218 then becomes the predicate upon which the entire word of God is based upon is that man does God is saying in type and a natural I don't want man to live alone because I didn't want to live alone and because I didn't want to live alone I am now creating so that I can put a man there and give him dominion and make him like me in the natural so that I can show to everyone the plan that what I want from them is I want to live with them I want to bring them to my home I want them to have someone they can choose I'm even going to allow for evil because when I allow for evil I can fully Express all the love that I am because without evil and without being able to pull someone out that you know look if I was just perfect it would be easy to love me I'm sure it's fairly easy to love me anyway but but you know I mean my wife married me it must not have been that hard so God even allows for evil so that he is able to express the full the full power of his love GL the length and depth and breadth of his love is allowed to be expressed and the God and but but but so now we have to stop for a moment and we say Okay expressed because that's a word we're going to use this morning that God now is is Desiring not merely you know because he's like look I'm it I am just awesomeness yes he is and God realizes and you forgive this little bit of humor here for just a moment but because I don't really feel like God realized this exactly but we have to just try to conceptualize it in human terms but and God realizes I am so awesome but nobody knows absolutely and he realizes cuz this is exact this is where we're going so you like I said you forgive me if this feels a little irreverent I I don't mean it to be but I mean it so that we can identify ourselves with that because that will be very important and so God is like you know it's so sad here right because I'm I'm awesomeness and nobody knows and how many of us would like to be awesome half of the people okay how many never raised their hands in church okay that's what I thought okay same people all right um so so God God recognizes that that that who he is when we say he wants to express himself there has to be an object there to receive the expression is that right so so someone has to know someone has to be there to receive the expression or the expression is meaningless I I did a little uh I did a little devotional on on on the light of the world right around Christmas time and and I was we were doing a Bible study uh with brother Diego's group and and and I was as I was going along these lines of the light of the world you know that God was light and then he creates a sun you know and but if the sun like if you never actually witness the light of the Sun what good is the light is it really light if you don't see amen so that light then those those you know if we break it down into science and all that we understand that it's you know it's it's a light it's it's it's waves and you know beams and whatever it is and it's been a long time since I've been in seventh grade so you know um but you know we were it's light waves and they hit us but if those light waves never hit us right what good is it there's there's even this is the coolest thing ever like well one of the coolest things ever there's a lot of cool things but sliced bread and all that but but but but there's a there's a science project that was done that talked about like like light coming through and and and they had two holes and they set up this science experiment and they had two holes that that light would come through maybe brother Samuel has preached on this already I don't know but no okay oh say so there's two there's two holes that they would let light through and then they would track how the particles of light would go through these holes so they set up the source they set up the receiving end of what was to receive that source and they allowed two slots for light to come through and when both of those slots are open the light travels through both of them equally when they close one of them it is not it you would think well the light's just going and it's going through both of these holes and then they close one of them and so the Light Just Hits and bounces off and goes through this one that's kind of what we would think happens that's not what happens it it'll blow your mind what actually happens is when that is closed the particles go through that one you see if there's nothing there to receive it if there's nothing there to receive the expression Hallelujah then what's the point of the expression now I know it's a scien experiment that just will blow your minds and everybody's looking at me going there's no way he said that right telling you what you can look it up on Wikipedia I don't remember the name of the study but you know you look for light and I don't know we'll we'll tell you tonight I don't know it's there okay so you have to you have to begin to recognize that in order to be anything truly there has to be something to receive the expression right is that all right so how many wanted to be awesome okay a few more people have decided to be awesome okay there has to be someone that can receive that expression of your own awesomeness it is not good that men should be alone because if you are alone what are you unexpressed it was rhetorical but thank you Pastor I feel right at home now when the pastor is answering my rhetorical questions amen amen if you were sitting right there it would feel just so perfect it's exactly where my pastor sits and answers my rhetorical questions so so there has to be you you and we all we all recognize like we want to express and we want people to receive our expression but we struggle sometimes when we do Express and it's not received the way we want to be received then we react to that and sometimes the way we react to that is to shut down the expression Factory they're not receiving it I they don't get me right so I'm going to stop being me apparently how do we know who you are how do you know who you are oh now it just got all deep and stuff there's only one way you can know who you are you have to express yourself and that expression has to then impact someone else and they are able to say you're awesome you're kind of a jerk and then you wouldn't have to stay that way and sometimes as we express ourselves and then we recognize it's not really being received well there's well there's really two Poss well there's three possibilities one you have a problem two they have a problem three you both have problems it's probably three and that's and then we then then where Grace comes in because we have to recognize I need to have Grace for their problems to not like my expressions and then realize well but if I have to have Grace for their problems I really hope they have Grace for me and you know this this goes all you know abundance of Grace and love is really nice and then when we have Grace and love what are we doing well we're expressing Grace and love and then life becomes just so much easier as it comes so much more graceful and lovely that's how that works anyway we going to we're going to move on now here so that I don't take up too much of that timer time um and so so brother brandham now he I want to Pivot into what what really is it what it is what is alone or maybe even what is not alone and so we can recognize that God is is God himself has expressed and he's expressed attributes to be created so that he could dwell not alone right everybody followed that line of thinking right so it's in God it's in God's nature not to be alone so then it would follow then that everywhere God is it there's not there there's there's not there's there's more people right so then the opposite so so we could then say well but then and so if Heaven is where God Is Right not just some place above the clouds like we thought when we were five and we thought you know Grandpa was looking you know on a big white fluffy Cloud looking down over us and how cute that was and everything it's not heaven heaven is with God right Heaven is cuz we you know cuz I mean how many of you are seated in Heavenly places already all right and I'm not I am not saying that we're not that Jesus is not physically coming to take us to a somewhere different physical place but if we can be already seated with him in Heavenly places then that must mean that that a that a large attribute of Heaven is being with him because we are all because by the cross our our relationship has now been reestablished with him and we can very literally although not physically you understand that differentiation I hope that literally we can be with him even though not in our physical bodies right right amen so because of the Cross so so if being if if if being with God and there's always going to be others there then part of Heaven is that there there're always they will never be alone there will always be people so then the opposite of that then the opposite of Heaven which we know would be hell what would be the properties of hell we would find that it would be the opposite of the properties of heaven and if he Heaven has properties of you're never alone then hell would have properties of always alone always alone yes sir now brother Brandon will go into this quote here now brother Brandon in the message Souls that are in prison now and this is kind of the basis this Vision that he has as he's you know his legs have been shot and he's bleeding and he's dying on this Hospital table and and and the basis kind of of of this sermon um that he's going to preach in 1963 entitled Souls that are in prison now and if you listen to it you find that you know he's he's saying you know man is the door closed we hope it's you know we don't believe that it is but it's a very man in the altar call like man that would that must have been an altar call of altar calls I mean people are you can hear it on tape they're crying out to God and and a very heavy heavy sermon and it's kind of based on this Vision that he begins to describe and we'll read this quote together now after the vision struck me I was so weak and I had lost all that blood I thought I was sinking into an endless eternity many of you has heard me tell this before sinking into an endless eternity first I was going through like clouds and then through darkness and sinking on down down down the first thing you know I got into the regions of the lost and in there I screamed I looked and there just everything there was no Foundation to it I could never stop falling for eternity looked like I was going to fall there was no stopping nowhere and then what a difference it was from the vision I had here not long ago of being in glory with the people the contrast what is he contrasting falling and not falling no he's contrasting there's no one here and I was in glory with people and brothers are hugging me our precious brother sisters are hugging me my our precious brother there's there's people there it's wonderful but falling through hell there's no people there but in this as I was falling falling I screamed for my daddy of course just being a kid that's what I would do I scream for my daddy my daddy wasn't there I screamed for my mother somebody catch me there was no mother there I was just going and I screamed then to God there was no God there there was nothing there and after a while I heard the most mournful sound that I ever heard heard and it was the awfulest feeling there is no way even a literal burning fire would be a pleasure to the side of what this was now those Visions has never been wrong and it was just one of the most horrible feelings I ever had he was falling through all hell alone so yes the falling part must not have been good the Blackness the clouds the the even there's bees beings there that he would talk about that that would be making these mournful noises and you'd say well but okay he wasn't really alone there was hey the there's there's beings there just like you're still alone because there's no expression right right there's no one receiving your expression there's no one you can cry out to and talk to well you're alone so contrasting with Glory that there's people there you're rejoicing together you're there there's something that's been accomplished together there's some shared uh there's shared substance that you have together and it's a wonderful time and hell is the opposite of that where there's no people and you're just falling and there's no God there right and we begin to understand like I'll just just for a moment segue into this for you know brother brandham preaches and it's one of kind of the the doctrines that we would say of this message is that there is no eternal hell right and and a lot of people have issues with that you know Pentecostals and Baptists and different things they take real I mean it's just it's kind of weird that they take issue with that you'd think that'd be kind of merciful um and and so you'd think people would latch on to that I would think but but what it really comes down to is when you're a legalist and when you have a Works spaced religion that you're that you're a part of and you're trying very hard to please God um through your works and everything else and then you realize there's a group of people who aren't trying very hard on in this life um trying to please God then bless God I need them to be punished be and me rewarded because I did stuff and they didn't and it's not merely enough that I be rewarded they need to be punished as well and that must be that's I don't know any other explanation as to why Christians would would reject the idea of of no eternal hell but it even goes deeper than that when we recognize what brother Brenham is saying Hell is right here and what he'll say I believe later on in this sermon what hell is is is it's it's Eternal separation from God not and not that it itself is eternal but that but that God is and you won't be with him right so so so so it comes down to something we begin to recognize that hell isn't actually a punishment for those things that you've done wrong but hell is actually the choice that you have looked at God in the face and you said I know who you are I know what you want I I I know I know all about you but you know what I want to I do not want to be with you because brother brandham says God never sends anyone to hell you go there on your own you go over every roadblock that he puts in your way but ultimately he honors the choice that you have of do you want a relationship with him or don't you so you you and and here is here is where you make the choice we make choices in Edens Adam and Eve made a choice in the Garden of Eden we are in Satan's Eden and Eden is a place of choice you make choices of which tree to be with in an Eden and we are living in Satan's Eden and The Time Is Now for us to make the choice of which one do we want to be with and so we make you can make the choice to be with him or you can make the choice not to be with him and if you look God in the face and say I don't want to be with you I know all that you are and I but you know what I just don't want it then God says well God doesn't say fine then I'm going to send you to hell to burn that's not what God does you know the farmer you know we have the parable of the tears and the the wheat and the tears right and the chaff and you know the farmer he gets the he gets the grain and then he burns the wheat have you ever seen this Harvest process you know happen you know where they they gather all the wheat and it's like this is wonderful it's like okay well we have all this chaff and we have all these tears and you know we need to get rid of them they're kind of taking up some room so here we go here's the fire and we throw them in there and like an afterthought right like they don't there's no ceremony you know where it's like it's harvest time it's time it is now time for the for the burning of the tears and then they you know they start having a song and dance around the fire as they and rejoicing as all these things burn no it's it it doesn't matter this is the thing that matters that is not the thing that matters it's this thing we're rejoicing over thisise the a the atheists want to ascribe a whole bunch of anger to God that isn't there it is just Choice it's it's we I have set things up I do not desire to be alone I have create I have made it so that there that that you may have a choice to receive my love or not and those who accept the in the The Proposal that I have given to you to be my bride will come and be with me in the wedding chamber and those that have not I will honor their wishes if they want to be alone they can be alone and brings heaven and hell down to again Revelation or Genesis 2:18 is the predicate on which all of this is hanging in that it is not good for man to be alone which tells us that God did not want to be alone so the idea of the whole thing is do you want to be with me or not it comes down to love it comes down to relationship with him am and what that does is it re it rewrites our entire thinking and that's what this revelation of this message is doing for us when we begin to understand what he's telling us about hell here and there's no eternal hell and hell isn't just a burning place where God punishes you but it's actually just the state of being alone without God and that is the choice that you're making we begin to understand but then if I'm making the choice that I love him and I want to be with him even though I fail that's not the issue the issue is is H is has the love came into my heart and has it changed me because the power of that love is there to bring me into a new birth and to fill me with his Spirit to give me that those qualities and those properties that he wants to instill inside of me am amen so then it's it's like well am I there or not that's the issue and it has nothing to do with the daily minutia of all of the works that we try to do and all the failings that we we look at and we we we stress over and we obsess over and it's none of those things now if we love him we want to please him but that's what it comes down to like why don't I please him enough well maybe I should fall in love with him more hallelujah amen Lord so one of the chief characteristics of hell is being alone and I hope this isn't too dark here but we're we're headed somewhere here so so one of the chief characteristics of hell is alone being alone being with Christ and others in glory is one of the chief characteristics of heaven so then we begin to we begin to ask ourselves then how am I if I understand this then how am I expressing that which which one of those am I tending towards in my life life am I tending towards an expression of being alone or am I tending towards an expression of being with others and that could be an indicator of whether or not you're Desiring you know more hell-like Properties or you're Desiring more heaven-like properties to just you know say that very plainly you know so we can ask ourselves you know am I tending towards being alone because there's there's a lot of ways these days that we can be alone you knowy just a moment here got a text it's from my son I think that was before church hopefully okay no that's funny someone's streaming and it is the double slit experiment that I was talking about thank you brother Leonard anyway what else do we have here oh I'm sorry I forgot you all were [Music] here brother that's right [Laughter] good um anyway oh what what you were saying this got really uncomfortable here we'll go back to the timer and we've all we've all talked about it we've all maybe even experienced it you know Thanksgiving at home and everybody's in the living room together on their phones watching their Netflix on their Facebook and their Tik toks and their Instagrams and their Pandoras and their Disney pluses and and and of course as we all know all of these things are evil and from the pits of hell kind of don't that that's right me too much there brother some of these are on my phone I mean yes and no and but and and I'm you know this sermon isn't saying like get all these these These are the apps that this that the minister this morning has decided that are terrible and that none of you as if you're a Believer you wouldn't have any of these apps on your phones now there are some apps that I could put up on this screen that I could say if you were believer you would not have this app on your phone those apps exist right but as a Believer who loves God you're going to have discernment on what what things could I do what what will what will is there benefits of any of these things or are they just completely no and some of them are just like like brother I'm going to have to have you explain to me how the process of discernment worked for you to tell you that that app was okay on your phone I just don't get how that's going to be profitable now there are some of those I I do I do wonder about Tik Tok but we're not going to get here and preach and preach brother Trevor's doctrines okay you know and we could have had Snapchat and we could have had all kinds of different things up here and all kinds of different apps hang on I just got a not I'm just kidding I don't have a notification and some of these are social platforms forms you see brother Trevor they're social so we're not actually being alone that's right that's right you don't brother Trevor you're not recognizing the friends that I have in my phone come through I have friends on in through there how you know and so I'm not I'm not alone and and and I will say like I I thank God that there are especially for our young people I thank God that there are ways in which that you can use technology you know to to to be able to connect in some ways with other youth but it the but it would be a sad sad sad use of Technology if you were to sit in your bedroom connecting with other message youth that are in your phone but their message Youth and if you never came out of your room but the some total of your existence and your experience and your connectedness with those other good little message kids in your phone were never coming out of your phone and going to a camp or a banquet or a Sur or a function or a whatever I would tell you you actually you not only are you alone unfortunately you're alone and don't even know it like you're the lead DEA of alone which is a problem so I thank God that there are ways that we can use these things to benefit Our Lives because you can get to know someone better and then the next thing that your function that you're at you have some shared conversation you have some things that's wonderful but if it stayed alone if it stayed in your phone you know if you're at a if you're dating one another you know you get to that point and you've met whatever that means you know and then you say hey let's go out and you go out and then you sit across from the table from one another and and then you Converse on the phone because that's what you're used to like she's so pretty but I just don't know how to say anything to her so cuz this is what I'm used to this is how I talk to her 95% of the time this is how that that the relationship is going and so then well can I just sit there and look at her and she's pretty and I'll just keep texting her because that's what I'm used to yes that's very sad that's a problem right and so if you can begin to recognize what's happening in our age and what the devil you know like I said we're living in Satan's Eden and what the devil would like to do is he would like to push you into the state of being alone because he's preparing his children for his environment and God himself is preparing his children for his environment and so the devil would like to take all of these things to push you into that and then and even you find the fruits of that though we have social networks and people have thousands of friends in their phones and they're more connected than they ever have been they're also more depressed scientifically proven study after study that says it's not working right why isn't it work it's no absolutely it is working it's doing exactly what the spirit of this age has influenced these creators to to to do and so if you get if you if you don't recognize the trend that's trying to pull you into Al loneness I mean how how sad is it to sit there in your bedroom and watch Netflix for hours upon hours upon hours who are you right no one knows because you're not expressing that's good because the slits of your life are all closed there's no one there to receive who am I brother Trevor well I could tell you if I was around you you and the things that you were doing were impacting my life if there was expression from you I could tell you how awesome you were if you were a jerk or not you know there were things in your life you could clean up if there were man you're you know I like being around you you know all right kind of need that right we'll just we're here and we're talking about media and things like that so we'll just talk about video gaming and things like that and also the apps have a lot of the apps have this kind of thing you know you've got your thumbs up you've got your powerups you've got your achievement unlocked how do you feel we'll just say guys because this is definitely more of a guy thing but sisters if you're into the video games and such you can you know your Candy Crush Saga or whatever I don't know like you that's probably terrible but whatever it is like how do you feel when you get this little bling you know BL bling it's like o just sounds good and it says achievement unlocked and you're like yes I have done something I have do you know how long it takes like do you know the percentage of the population of the world that gets to the what is it is it the gold sorry z i shouldn't use you like this but you know like it's just such a it's an example you know you you you know you've done the thing that like it's so hard to do and you have done it and you feel like I have achieved I got the gold thing you know I I I was um on our Pilot's forums and there was this they were discussing um because I work for this group of pilots and they were discussing that this this one kid he he he basically beat Tetris it was something that no human has ever done they thought only AI could do it and this kid did it and when the game finally flaked out because that's how you knew it you beat it because it stopped processing because it actually wasn't coded to ever get any further than that wow and and the kid beat this thing and then it glitched out and he was just like and the kid's like in tears and he's shaking my goodness can't believe this happened it's like my mom's at the store I just I can't even tell anybody just you know and there's like 10 minutes of video of this kid just sitting there just freaking out because of what he has achieved what has he achieved absolutely nothing if the game wouldn't have glitched out and told him you achieved he wouldn't have achieved right that's why we have things like thumbs up that's why we have things like achievement unlocked or the little BL bling tells you you've done something good and it gives you this little jol and you're like woohoo I've achieved and if you didn't have that you would never know you achieved so they have to embed in these things they have to embed things to tell you you have achieved because if you if they wouldn't have you wouldn't play the game because you would realize I haven't achieved anything so they have to literally tell you you have achieved so that you can know you have achieved wow you know Ben I want to ask you something um are you a house Builder he's not a house Builder I think why don't but I I don't I don't understand why you just wouldn't identify as that though you mean you've never expressed that you're a house Builder like if we wanted to say Ben was a house Builder like at some point in time he would have to achieve the status of billly it's like he knows he's not a housebuilder right because there is nothing tangible that can say he has achieved anything he's never expressed it there is no manifestation of that expression in any way and I'm not saying that it's always tangible but you know I mean there's not like I I hope I am impacting your lives right now but I don't like it would be harder for me to find like there's no house that's built per se but I hope that the word of God is being built in your house and and that in your lives and that you're recognizing who you are and coming closer to him and and that the church body is being developed and drawn closer to him by it there is an there has to be an impact when we're expressing and if we have to be told that you have an ACH you have achieved something you you really haven't there should be evident fruit oh my now we're somewhere in the Book of John of of the things and the characters and qualities in your life and if that's not found anywhere we'd say who are you and if Ben were to say I'm a house Builder and we'd be like I'm not so sure about that cuz there's no houses right so maybe sometimes in your life you've you've asked the question who am I and I'll tell you something a lot of times what we do when we want to find out who we are is we go and we go we get alone I gotta find myself you know a lot of times we try to do that in somewhere where there's nice weather you know people go to California to find themselves a lot there's a lot of nice weather there you know let's be comfortable while we're alone trying to find ourselves and when what are you going to find when you look inward to find yourself what are you going to find let's let's like God knew he was awesome God knew he was all of it God knew he was righteous God knew he was holy did he just continually wander through the vast expanses of Eternity trying to find himself no when God wanted to find himself and you again you you forgive me for putting God in very human fleshly tangible terms but God to show that he was loving created God did not needing achievement unlocked you have created no he didn't need that he could look he could see the fruit of who he was being expressed out before him and impacting others to know I he looked and said he didn't say achievement unlocked he didn't have to he said it's good amen I look at what I have done and I know who I am and I know that I am good right are we together now are we are we here so so the act of being alone when you begin to draw yourself into places and times when you're alone now and you might say well brother Trevor you know we'll get off of this slide here and you you look look brother Trevor you know Jesus went and got off by himself a lot was he going to be alone no Jesus had periods of time where he would where he would oh and we're going to get into this tonight so help me Jesus not too right now and he had periods of time where he would detach from the people around him to get alone with the father right yeah to develop he needed he needed things from someone he needed to be enriched he needed his Spirit to to be strengthened right so Jesus didn't just go to be alone to find himself he went to fellowship with the father and that's a very different that's a very different alone thing and so so what we begin to find you know is that we begin to look at it and we we begin to see are our lives mirroring what our future eternity is going to be are we being drawn into expression of ourselves as God himself expressed himself or are we being drawn into Al loneness into you know even even getting into bitterness because you know no one gets me well what is there to get you know with Ben's like I'm a house Builder like but no one gets me no one recognizes the raw talent that I have inside it's just so aggravating that no one gets me because I try to tell them and I have all these books you know and I've looked and I man I know how to frame a house and I try to talk to other builders and they don't seem to get what I'm trying to say and no one gets me so I I'm just you know what I'm going to do I'm just going to stop talking to all those people who say they're Builders because they're obviously not like me because no one gets me as a house Builder that I literally am not even though I think I am because I read a book one time I'm just going to stop I'm just going to shut that thing down cuz nobody's worthy of me and we like we do this in various ways in our lives not house building I get that it's a metaphor you connect the dots you put your life in there you begin to look in the mirror and you begin to say hey God where have I done this where have I said these people don't get me whatever even that means I tell you what what it is we are getting you man if you've read a book about building house houses and then you're talking about it with people who have built houses and you say they don't get me no they get you they know exactly who you are you are someone who believes he is a house Builder because he has read a carpentry book they get you loud and clear man because they the fruits are known the expression is known and when you begin to say no one gets me you you go to your parents to say no no one gets me and the parents are like hey it's an emotional time here we want to be supportive we want to help we really do we love you so we don't want to you know we we we don't want to be harsh you know it's it's it can be tough though and you're like no one gets me and then we're like honey we love you and you're just like stalling for time because you're like how do I say this I don't like what is it um what is it exactly you want them to get right well no one understands how I feel yes we do we understand you feel very down right now we get it loud and clear you are absolutely expressing everything that's with inside you outwardly and that can be a problem if you're not willing to be honest with yourself maybe you need to look at what me is because we all see what me is and if you don't see what me is and the IDE the re the way you see what me is is by looking at what me is doing because the scripture says even a child is known by his doings all right so my some of us you know we can be alone in a whole room full of people and the problem is is that we think people should you know should react to me in a specific way and they don't react to me in a specific way but the people on social media react to me in a specific way that I like because I can you know put a filter on me come on brother and I can't do in real life or it's a lot harder and people react to me and they give me thumbs up and hearts and you know I L ysms I love you so much um because it's so easy to do right it's so easy to be i i l ysm it's not that easy but it's sort of easy to type that you know and just tell someone how much they're so appreciated and Valu Val for their filtered you know photo of themselves or their food picture something like that you know um we don't have to get personal though um so so but what we need to begin to recognize again is like that the reason I want to bring this out is the spirit of this age is to try to bring you into being alone and is giving you Avenues to feel rewarded for being alone that's good and not it and and it doesn't have to be that and you think well but no one else like they don't get me they don't know who I am and it's like well maybe you should develop who you are a little bit right that's that's the harsh thing that we have a hard time saying to our children you're welcome parents um um because I'll leave tomorrow um you know and and but but maybe maybe you should be honest with yourself and say well who am I like who who really am I how am I being perceived and then look in the mirror what am I doing have I built a house or not because if I haven't built a house maybe I shouldn't be I'm a house Builder yet if I haven't done anything if I haven't you know but I'm such a nice person it's like really because I've never seen you smile you know it's like the um what's the what's the uh Joe teenager you know if if uh it's a little story that I read one time about Joe teenager and it's you know he was the greatest person you know had had a heart full of gold only nobody knowed it cuz he never let on if you imagine you know his funeral and somebody eulogizing him he like oh he was such a great person like people knew people knew Joe teenager they knew that underneath his disrespectful attitude and his constant frown and all of these things that he was just he had a heart full of gold like no he didn't cuz he never expressed it why wouldn't God Express who he was God wanted to express who it is who he was God wanted God knew he was awesome and wanted to express that out that others might know and if we're children of God if we're the family of God if we're the body of Jesus Christ filled with him filled with his Spirit born again in the same way that Jesus was born the first time was the first born among many Brethren when we have a new birth we fall into the same line and into the same birth that he himself had yes sir amen oh and and so that's so powerful and so if that if that then was God expressing himself and we have quotes but we also have like five minutes so we're we'll try to get through some of those but not all of those but if God him if God is then going to express Jesus because God God knew knew he even had to express himself physically so that he might be perfectly known how who he would be in the physical so God his his very thoughts and his very heart was to express himself in his creation not just by his creation but in his creation so God expresses himself in Jesus Christ that he could now impact the lives of each and every one of us that we might know who he is not just have heard about him not just have been told about him but that he would walk down the street Among Us in human flesh that he might impact our lives and what does it look like when God impacts lives through a body of Flesh well we know what that looks like but God through his his plan through his mind was not to just come and walk on the the streets of Galilee and through Jerusalem and walked down Hallelujah Avenue but he went to a cross so that he could further Express his love that says I know you can't do it so I'll die and make a way for you to do it but he didn't stop there because that wasn't even enough just to to cleanse you from your sins but then he goes down into a grave to rise again that he might pour himself upon All Flesh Hallelujah amen because it would be a sad oh come on now it would be a sad thing if the expression physically of Jesus Christ the the the physical expression of the characters of God stopped in 30 ad but God said no I don't need I want everyone from here on out every single age I want them to f physically know the expression of the character of God in human flesh so if you want to identify not as a housebuilder but as a Christian as one who has the qualities and the presence and the life of Jesus Christ in your body then it would begin to express itself from the inside of you outward Hallelujah now that doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye you've got there's a lot of thing you know there's a lot of me that's getting got out of the way so that I can express him yes sir that's it yes sir and sometimes there people like I don't get you it's like well it might be just they don't want to get you cuz there's so much of you in the way and maybe there's things about you that hey they just got to I got to work on this I got to pray about this I got to peel these things back amen if no one likes having you around wow it might be you maybe that's something we can take before God yes good because God didn't make you to live alone God made you that you might be in that that you might be a a bearer of his own characters and qualities of his his own life his own his own everything that he wants you know God wants people to get him and the only way you're going to do that is when we see him in the lives of all the Believers and so as God expressed himself through Jesus Christ he's now wanting to express himself by giving you of his New Birth by giving you of the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that he might Express himself in human flesh again today and if you want to testify that I am a Christian I am I am a believer I am born again then that must be expressed because that's what God does because to be with God is to express yourselves to others to be without God is to be alone and not express yourselves to others so think about that for just a moment how lonely hell will truly be because there you will be alone and I've got a quote where brother it's so man it's the it is the most terrible quote I just read it again in there in the in the back room I thought God how terrible is is this truly you will be conscious for whatever time you are in Hell falling alone you will like the worst part is not the falling the worst part is conscious that I am alone there is no one around that I can express myself to and you think well I'll just sit and read a book no you won't there won't be a book there there won't be a party in hell with your with your buddies you're not going to smoke a cigar with the devil in hell that's not that's not a thing that's what you know all the drinking people at work say but that's man that's not what it is and I think that is I that to me is one of the most terrifying things I do not like to be alone you know if I'm alone let me be asleep man right right but hell won't be that cuz I'll be conscious it'll be like I'm asleep but I'm conscious I can't do anything and I can't impact anyone and no one can impact me right that's right I don't want that and God saved me from that not only has he saved me from that so I don't have to experience that but what he's actually saying is is I don't want you to have that I want you to have me I want you to have relationship I want you to never be alone because I said I'd never leave you I'd never forsake you I said that in the Old Testament I had it requoted in the New Testament I do not want you to be alone I long to be with you hallelujah thank you Jesus I want to be with you too I never want to be alone oh God and and and and furthermore God it's not that I just I just you know hey can I be with you me and you will just hang out for the rest of Eternity I mean that might be nice I can't even think of your name right now though what's your name brother Brian me and Brian we're gonna hang out in heaven is that cool you want to do that you think you're going to get sick of me ever in heaven what's that not in perfect bodies good answer good answer not when all the Trevor's out of the way I won't get sick of you not when all the Brian out of the way but but so so to be but to think through that right now like though like I don't even know him oh I don't want to get on tonight too much right but so do I want to be with him all the time but I know Jesus Christ right I know his qualities because they've been expressed and I want to be like I value him amen and I want to be with him and if I want to be with him then I want others to be with him if if I want others to be with him I better I better be expressing who he is to everyone else I better let his Spirit come into me so fully and I just I am so sorry there's so many amazing quotes that I'm just not going to get to don't say things like that I've been preaching for an hour now I'm on 22 of 67 that's that's a lot God's secret mystery he had before the world began began back part of God's mind there was something he was trying was going to achieve he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a Moon Star atam molecule anything he was God but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love do you have love inside of you how do we know it's got to be expressed in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer all these great attributes that we see already expressed they were in God would we know this even through prophetic Insight would we know that God was all of those things if he had not yet expressed them no we wouldn't so God has already expressed these things and because he's expressed them we can know them and through prophetic Insight we can have all of these things identified and made known to us now God had to reveal himself and his attributes into this person called Christ in order to take death upon himself as Jehovah he could not die so he had to create himself a body and no woman could produce that body so his own character amen excuse me when I think of it his character projected the lovely person of Jesus Christen truly who he was was his character your character is who you are no woman could bring it Moses jocked Rebecca all these other women none of them could produce this type of character because it was come through sex by a fallen people but God projected his own body his Dwelling Place the reason he was the son of God cuz nothing else could project it but his own Divine character projected this Tabernacle to express himself in and yet he took himself away from the great thing that he was at his birth he could have come with a full Angel salute he could have come with the Chariots and angels of heaven but he come by way of a barn that's his love bringing himself down to the lowest now you study that character a little bit and then look at yourself and I look at and and when we say that now we have the context to understand what's going on here it's not to just go and get in your room and you know be a little bit introspective and who am I really well I believe I'm loving and good kind and you know I mean I stepped on that cat the other day but you know I really I'm really I'm kind no no no when you're looking at yourself look at the expression how are you expressing it amen but that's what he was that's who he was and that's why he was to save you so if you're going to look at yourself we look at the expression of Christ and we know what he was who he was and why he was and if you want to know who I am who am I what am I why am I look at your expression and if you don't like what you see then maybe that's something you should take to prayer instead of just being well nobody gets me so I'm just going to go alone find some friends in my phone who will like me for who I am filtered he become you that you might become him he took your load of sin now he was God's word expressed glory and if your perception of what's wrote in here doesn't match what you saw in Jesus Christ you got the wrong perception right little call back to Wednesday night come follow me he says what an opportunity that could have been Peter James or John one of them see the kid had been trained and brought upright been presented to Christ to use him all the potentials that he had in him you see you may have potentials Ben you may have the potentials to be a house Builder but you're not a house Builder until those potentials are expressed probably educated Young Rich influence where he could have presented the gospel yet turned it down what a rational thing was for that young boy and some of us are looking for purpose in our lives because that helps us to find out who we are and why we are what is my purpose what am I supposed to do well it may be presented to you and you may be turning it down because it doesn't fit the fantasy that perhaps you've created you know about being a um oh I'm trying to think of the world word you know um a marine biologist who works with whales at SeaWorld and that would be a cool job you know that like 10 people in the world have and so it's really kind of Niche and really hard to get that job but maybe you have you know ever since you were a four-year-old girl and you went to SeaWorld and you thought those those whales were the most amazing things ever and you wanted to dedicate your life to studying marine biology so that you could become you know someone who works with these whales and you're like that's who I am and then when you realize like you you know it's hard to get a job that only 10 people in the world have and you weren't selected as one of those 10 people and then you feel like I have who am I I have no purpose but maybe it's because the fantasy that you had of what your purpose was wasn't actually what your purpose from God was and maybe like the Rich Young Ruler your purpose is being presented to you even maybe right now that as someone who can who can who can project the lovely characters of Jesus Christ in your own life and through your own family and into your own you know your own marriage into your own children into your own you know workplaces and all of these things and and you can begin to and you think well that won't be rewarding I won't be splashed by saltwater and I don't know what else how you know I won't have a whale that loves me I'm trying not to really like I'm just try try not to make it sound stupid it's not stupid 10 people love their jobs that's great um and and and good for them but but but but there's opportunities presented to you and perhaps like the Rich Young Ruler you're you're turning down the very purpose that God has for you because God truly knows the potentials on the inside of you and you don't recognize that when you begin to allow God to to to when you allow yourself to get some of these fantasies out of the way and some of these things that you know you think people should be getting but they're not getting but they actually are and you just don't like how they're getting it and if you got some of those out of the way and allowed the purpose that God had for your life to begin to be expressed from the inside of you in the gifts and qualities and the uniqueness that God absolutely has placed on the inside of you and you begin to allow that to be expressed and then people actually begin to get that and then you're like whoa somebody got somebody got what I what I was trying to express here and it was so rewarding and so fulfilling and it's the best thing ever and a whale jumping in front of me could have never touched that although I thought that was going to be the greatest thing now I wonder why I ever even thought that because now the God of all creation is beginning to express himself through my life and I'm humbled by the fact that that one who was it who was awesome has has dained to come and put himself on the inside of me to express to someone else that they might be able to stand out of the muck and pit of sin that they might be able to come out of their misunderstandings and all of the problems that were facing in their lives to recognize the source of all of it can come and do the same thing on the inside of them and suddenly you begin to see who you are what you are and why you are and it's the most wonderful thing this Rich Young Ruler when he turned down the opportunity because he saw himself his fantasy was I'm going to be a rich man for you Jesus and Jesus said sell everything I just want you I don't want your riches I don't need your fantasy I don't need who you think you are cuz I know what's in there cuz I placed it on the inside and you have haven't been expressing it but through me you'll be able to express riches that you don't even understand right [Applause] nowall and this is what God has for you this is what God wants for you it's to express the awesomeness that he is through your very life but not that you're just some you know robot that you know or some puppet that God like I want you to say hi to the people and you're like it's like well that's not enjoyable God cuz you're just pulling the strings and I wave my hand no God wants to use you because he created you a specific way he put gifts and callings that are you in your life he doesn't just want puppets he doesn't just want robots he wants people like him that that man you like let's understand what we mean by that he wants people like him that aren't him they're attributes of him they're expressions of him but they are uniquely their own do do we understand that difference that that you are not you like when you give your life to Christ it's still your life yes sir he's using it that's it because you've yielded to him right but he's using what you are he's not just saying don't nothing just become empty brother brandom tells us not to do that you don't go to an altar and just try to become empty no but you say God this is who I am take all of me and use me because I am someone because you are someone and you created me in your image so then I am someone sir and I still have identity but I'm yielding all that my identity is not to erase my identity but that you might use my my identity oh my God Hall sir and I love that yes sir Hallelujah okay let's let's talk for a moment about this man and and I'm sorry I'm I'm going to I'm going to quit here I'm going to quit but just for a moment I want to talk about this man this man that had that had not fed Lazarus maybe it's even the same man brother brandham tells us this Rich Young Ruler and he pulls down his Barns and he builds bigger ones him and his barns good time yes sir it's just me and my bigger barns having a good time all alone and then he dies he doesn't look at Lazarus begging out in front and he finally dies and he goes down and there he is and there he is in in the regions of the Lost and we know the story he he screams out Father Abraham send Lazarus here to just put a cool water on my tongue and he's like yeah man there's a Chasm there he's like well let me go back and tell my brethren sorry you can't do that send Lazarus to tell my brethren he's like man they got the prophets let them hear them brother Brenham says then listen Adam he wants to be an evangelist then the call that Jesus had given him to follow him and to be a soul winner as a Young Man returned to him again he remembered it that he had five brothers and back on Earth he didn't want them in that place he said send Lazarus then back to my brothers not to come this way in other words accept the call of follow me but he said they they won't do it he said yes if one raised from the dead like Lazarus and and you and goes back and tell them the the you see it shows after we die you're still conscious he remembered Abraham said Son remember in your days you still remember you don't lose your memory you remember and you will know all the purpose and all the potentials that you had in your life that you chose not to express for him that you that you decided to to to squelch and to to to to that those those desires those rutes that those purposes that God placed inside of you and gifted you with and you wanted you just wanted to impact the world and be so sobody sobody so great but yet you never did and you sat in your room and you watched Netflix and you'll know while you're there alone like you were in your room that every purpose that you had in life you should have done and that you could have done and that it would have been amazing it would have been way more than whatever the Netflix special was that's really just not that amazing can we be honest it's time to not be alone musicians why don't you come God doesn't want you to be alone Hallelujah God wants you to live a rich full wonderfully expressed life but the only way that anybody the the only way that it can be expressed is when it impacts others and that means and and so so if we I don't I don't know what all to take from this sermon maybe but what I'm I'm trying to bring out to you is to look into to your life and watch those times that you are tending towards aing to being airing towards aloneness because that's not what God is looking for there are times and I'm I'm not I'm you know I'm not being extreme here or absolute saying if you're ever in your bedroom you know on social media for an hour that you know what are you doing just sitting there in hell I mean come on like let's go go witness to somebody I'm you know I'm I'm not being that extreme I I right okay we all understand that but that to look at the progression of your life to look at what God is doing in your life to look at what PE how people are responding to the things and events and the the expressions of your life and then to and to then check them with the word and say is this is this lining up with what I what I what I believe who of who I am and what people experience of who I am are those the same things because God went to Great Lengths so that people would know who he was and he wants you he wants you to be off the couch at times he wants you to come out of the bedroom he doesn't want you to experience aloneness and if you find yourself drifting towards Al loness he he's not looking for that in your life he wants more out of your life for sure but he wants you to have more out of your life because when you drift into Al loneness and I I get that some of us are more solitary and some of us are introverted and some of us are extroverted and God wants to use your extrovertedness God may even need to tone down your extrovertedness come on somebody we can look at the mirror a little bit and and and God maybe wants to turn up your introvertedness just a little bit you know and and say hey maybe you know it would be good that you talk to people [Music] but over in glory we're going to be with others over in glory we're going to be with him so why would we wait why would we wait to to experience what glory is if we're already seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus then aren't we there with one another aren't we there try wouldn't we want to to pull others into that and so God has great purposes for you he gave you purpose and reason and meaning there's a who there's a what and there's a why of your life and if you aren't finding that in Jesus Christ or you're sitting there going I don't even know then I would encourage you to take seriously what we've talked about this morning and and take it to prayer and begin to analyze who you are meditate upon the scriptures and meditate upon your own desires God you've I know you've created me in a certain way and what is Fant Y in me in my life and and what is actually the gifts and callings that you've put there because God if there's a gift I I want to develop it I want you to be able to have full control of it these these young men that that that have gifts and in music and and have blessed our lives and that that look that there's an impact of these young men upon this whole church and not even on this whole church there's people that couldn't go to Service uh this morning because of cold and snow and now they're impacting people watch watching but how is it that that happened it wasn't because they sat in their room and looked at their phone all day but what it was is they recognized that there was a gift in their lives and they submitted themselves to the call of God and the the the the necessities of that gift and they practiced and they developed and they learned and they they grew and God has things in your life that he's looking for you to develop and grow and to practice and [Music] you know is it brother Shawn right was it Shane God has been dealing in brother Shane's life and then he comes to the pastor and says I'd like to hold to I'd like to do a worship thing and he's devel and we don't know what I don't know what that gift is but I know it's a man who stood up and said I want to try and maybe I'll fail and maybe it'll be you know two people will want to sing and one Tes and it'll be 15 minutes and kind of embarrassing that we all came out maybe I tell you what there's a sermon in my life that I told the pastor I was like look we should listen to a tape cuz this is going to be 5 minutes and I'm going to be done and I was scared cuz I didn't feel like I had something there I didn't have there to give but God used the gift amen and there are times when you're going to do well and there's times when you're not going to do so well and there are times when God's just going to come and show you like look see what see what I just did for your you in your life that you know that wasn't you you know that was me but I've given you a glimpse of the potential of what I've put inside of you and God is is willing and wanting to give you glimpses of who you are and the potential that you have if you're willing to give those things to him but it it's it's we don't just we don't just SED through Down the River of Life in the boat friends like God is God is asking us to be intentional and to be purposeful and to examine Our Lives to be used for his good glories and pleasures and and I can tell you that being alone is not one of those things Heavenly [Music] Father Hallelujah Lord we we love you Lord because father you didn't want us to be alone and you've created us Lord to be relational you put something inside of us to love you and I'm so thankful father you put us something inside of

give inspiration and oh Lord to show potential that's there that's being untapped and unutilized Lord God and Lord to know Lord just to know father that you just desire to be with us Lord God how that
