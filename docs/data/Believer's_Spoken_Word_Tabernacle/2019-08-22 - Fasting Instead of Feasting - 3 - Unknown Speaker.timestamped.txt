[32:56] right sister Lily god bless you amen and
[33:00] just pray for safe travels amen for her
[33:03] well First Samuel chapter 14 and we'll
[33:06] just ask the help of the Lord to try to
[33:10] bring it together verse 24
[33:17] and the men of Israel were distressed
[33:21] that day for Saul had adjourned the
[33:24] people saying cursed be the man that
[33:28] eateth any food until evening that I may
[33:34] be avenged on my enemies so none of the
[33:39] people tasted any food and all they of
[33:43] the land came to a wood and there was
[33:45] honey upon the ground and when the
[33:48] people were come into the wood behold
[33:49] the honey dropped but no man put his
[33:52] hand to his mouth for the people feared
[33:54] the old but Jonathan heard not when his
[33:58] father charged the people with the old
[34:01] wherefore he put forth the end of the
[34:04] rod that was in his hand and dipped it
[34:06] in a honeycomb and put his hand to his
[34:09] mouth and his eyes were enlightened then
[34:13] answered one of the people and said thy
[34:15] father
[34:15] straitly charged the people with an old
[34:18] saying cursed be the man that eateth any
[34:21] food this day and the people were faint
[34:24] what a condition
[34:28] then said Jonathan my father hath
[34:31] troubled the land see I pray you how
[34:36] mine eyes have been enlightened because
[34:40] I tasted a little of this honey amen may
[34:45] God bless you bless the reading of the
[34:47] word as you're being seated I just
[34:51] wanted to just just drop right back into
[34:56] the channel where we were at here last
[35:00] Thursday and we've been dealing with
[35:01] this thought for me
[35:03] fasting instead of feasting and we know
[35:06] that there is a blessing in fasting but
[35:11] this that we're looking at is where they
[35:14] were withheld or withholding from eating
[35:20] what was in season and also a time when
[35:25] there was a war going on and to know
[35:28] that God when you think of how God has
[35:32] so prepared for us what we have need of
[35:36] and sometimes we say this and we don't
[35:39] always I'll just say I don't believe we
[35:42] always take it into heart to recognize
[35:44] all the preparations that God has for us
[35:47] brother Branham would tell us even how
[35:49] God would know the type of landscape
[35:52] that you like the type of colors of
[35:54] flowers and all those things and God
[35:55] would actually make sure that those
[35:58] things were here for us and then to see
[36:01] how that God within every one of the
[36:04] feasts that God gave Israel God gave it
[36:08] and ensured that what was needed to be
[36:10] brought to that feast that it would be
[36:12] ready it would be in season it would be
[36:15] in harvest everything would be right on
[36:17] time and God knew exactly when Israel
[36:20] was coming into this time here of war
[36:22] God knew exactly what they would have
[36:25] need of this was a season where the
[36:28] honey was dropping it was a time where
[36:32] there was as sustenance that for the
[36:35] people of God within that time but I
[36:37] want you to I want to draw your
[36:39] attention here
[36:40] to a place within the scriptures the
[36:42] very opening Scripture we read here and
[36:45] the whole the whole part where it says
[36:48] of this fast was called not to eat what
[36:51] they should have been eating and we see
[36:54] the case that people were distressed the
[36:56] people were faint they weren't able to
[36:59] fight like they should have been
[37:01] fighting and the whole thing that it
[37:03] came down to you know there's sometimes
[37:06] a word that may not seem as big but yet
[37:09] it can be a very big word and where it
[37:12] comes down to is that saul had adjourned
[37:15] the people in verse 24 cursed be the man
[37:18] that eateth any food until evening that
[37:20] I may be avenged on mine enemies so the
[37:24] whole purpose of this fast was not about
[37:27] the rest of the Israel this whole
[37:30] purpose of this fast was about soul and
[37:34] you find over and over under Saul's
[37:37] leadership and that this is a reflection
[37:40] of where the heart of the people were in
[37:43] that Saul himself was a choice of the
[37:47] people where they wanted a king like the
[37:50] other kings like other nations they got
[37:53] their eyes off of the Living God and
[37:56] they got their eyes on other nations and
[37:58] so then from that it all comes forth
[38:02] that their choice was a choice based on
[38:05] their own desires and it was based on
[38:08] selfishness so when we look at this and
[38:12] just to bring it down into the practical
[38:14] measure one of the things that we always
[38:17] and always must deal with and ever be
[38:20] mindful of is always bringing self in
[38:24] line with the Word of God and this is
[38:28] why there is a need it's not just an
[38:31] option but there must be a new birth our
[38:35] life must be born again of the Spirit of
[38:37] God because then there's a change of
[38:40] nature that sets forth there is a
[38:43] quickening power there is that authority
[38:45] then to bring into subjection the other
[38:48] outer to realm
[38:50] of the body and that at that of Christ
[38:52] might be reflected through our lives it
[38:55] gives us as the scripture says power and
[38:58] that's exactly what the Holy Ghost does
[39:00] and so when we recognize this that even
[39:04] within that as believers we need to feed
[39:08] upon the Word of God all the way through
[39:11] the scriptures Jesus would say man shall
[39:13] not live by bread alone but by every
[39:15] word that proceedeth out of the mouth of
[39:17] God and here were the Pharisees within a
[39:20] time they they had the scriptures they
[39:22] had the Psalms they had the writing of
[39:24] the prophets they had all of that and
[39:25] here Jesus brings them back to a place
[39:28] that Moses had of God now we know the
[39:31] bread of God is nothing different from
[39:34] the Word of God but the bread of God is
[39:36] the very Living Word of God that is
[39:39] promised in this hour and there's no way
[39:42] that we can actually be sustained being
[39:45] overcomer
[39:46] without the Living bread of life and
[39:48] that what God has promised then God
[39:51] supplies that Living bread for you and I
[39:54] for this hour
[39:55] and so when we look at this I want to
[39:58] just go into the scriptures here in to
[40:01] Matthew chapter 16 verse 18 and this is
[40:04] a familiar scripture where the Lord
[40:07] Jesus is he expresses here the term of
[40:11] the church and he says I say unto thee
[40:14] that thou art Peter and upon this rock I
[40:17] will build my church and the gates of
[40:21] Hell shall not prevail against it now if
[40:25] we recognize the very the very premise
[40:28] and foundation of the Church of the
[40:31] Living God is that it is it is founded
[40:35] and it is built by the Lord Himself and
[40:39] it cannot be without him providing what
[40:43] is needed in order to bring forth that
[40:46] church now to think of this God has
[40:49] already provided when the scripture says
[40:52] if from the Book of Psalms and then Paul
[40:54] picks it up in Hebrews a body hast thou
[40:57] prepared for me it was not just speaking
[40:59] of better the corporal body of the
[41:02] Jesus Christ but it was speaking of the
[41:04] body the mystical body of believers the
[41:08] attributes of God that were in God sons
[41:11] and daughters of God I believe I'm
[41:12] talking to you tonight that we're in the
[41:15] mind of God before the foundation of the
[41:17] world and God's desire was to dwell
[41:20] within his body which is his wife
[41:23] which is his church which is that which
[41:25] is from his mind his choosing which he
[41:28] took from his own side so here the Lord
[41:33] Jesus is here giving this term and you
[41:35] know I just say it like this I know
[41:37] sometimes it's been a term that
[41:39] sometimes has seemingly been looked down
[41:42] upon but this is a scriptural term
[41:44] there's a lot of churches but there's
[41:46] one Church of the Living God
[41:49] amen there's one Church of the Living
[41:51] God and this is exactly what the Lord
[41:54] Jesus is speaking of and there's only
[41:57] one way into this church you can't join
[42:00] it you've got to be born into this
[42:04] church there's nobody that shakes our
[42:07] hand to get into it but it is Christ
[42:10] Himself the chief Shepherd who baptizes
[42:13] us into this body by his own spirit so
[42:19] now to look at this just the word and
[42:22] the term church here it is notice how
[42:25] it's broke down into the parts here it's
[42:27] a gathering of citizens called out from
[42:31] their homes into some public place and
[42:34] assembly the second part of it and
[42:37] assembly of the people convened at the
[42:41] public place of the council for the
[42:44] purpose of deliberating now I'm not
[42:46] gonna deal on it tonight but there is a
[42:48] reason we have come here and that's for
[42:51] deliberating this we're not here by
[42:52] accident we are here tonight
[42:54] intentionally
[42:55] it isn't just something we came here
[42:57] tonight and said well you know I'll just
[42:59] stagger in here tonight and you know I
[43:01] don't got no place else better to go
[43:03] there it is intentional now you might
[43:06] maybe you're a person that maybe there's
[43:08] something that struck your heart maybe
[43:09] it's your first time you've ever been
[43:11] here but I'll tell you right now
[43:12] not here by chance tonight there is
[43:15] nothing here by chance and as believers
[43:19] listen now has believers when that grips
[43:21] our heart the purpose of God then our
[43:24] lives are no longer to live in a manner
[43:27] of haphazard we're looking for the will
[43:30] of God and the things that we do are
[43:33] intentional it is deliberate
[43:35] we are deliberate about coming to the
[43:38] house of God
[43:40] we're deliberate about reading the word
[43:42] we are deliberate about praying we are
[43:45] delivered this is not accidental
[43:48] we are intentional in what we're doing
[43:51] [Applause]
[43:54] to deliberate to reflect to see
[43:57] ourselves in the word and to take a
[43:59] reckoning to take an account of our
[44:02] lives we're not here by chance in a
[44:05] Christian sense it says it's an assembly
[44:08] of Christians gathered for worship in a
[44:11] religious meeting it's accompanied the
[44:13] next part a company of Christians or of
[44:16] those who hoping for eternal salvation
[44:18] through Jesus Christ observe their own
[44:21] religious rites and hold their own
[44:23] religious meetings and manage their own
[44:25] affairs according to regulations
[44:27] prescribed for the body for orders sake
[44:30] those and once you just look at this one
[44:33] those who anywhere in a city a village
[44:37] constitute such a company and are united
[44:40] into one body the whole body of
[44:45] Christians scattered throughout the
[44:46] earth and the Assembly of faithful
[44:49] Christians already dead and received
[44:50] into heaven so to recognize that here
[44:53] tonight we are gathered together in this
[44:56] village of Sheffield tonight or this
[44:59] city we have gathered here as as a body
[45:02] of believers we are not gathering here
[45:06] in vain we have not come here with the
[45:08] purpose of just to be seen or to see one
[45:11] another it's just in that but we have
[45:14] come here tonight
[45:15] we our desire is to hear from God
[45:18] we are here to worship Him this is not a
[45:23] self-centered affair we are not here
[45:26] tonight just to see I'm going to see
[45:28] what God will give me tonight it might
[45:30] be your time and opportunity to give
[45:33] back to God a man after all we are
[45:38] priests unto our God kings and priests
[45:42] so to think of it here we are gathered
[45:44] together as a little body and many other
[45:46] little bodies brother Jonathan their
[45:48] last night as they were gathered
[45:50] together and others that are gathered
[45:52] together little assemblies little
[45:55] outposts like it was in the time of
[45:57] Egypt you know no matter what church or
[46:00] outpost City you went to in Egypt when
[46:04] you receive the grain you are not
[46:06] receiving it from another man you are
[46:09] receiving it from Joseph it was it was
[46:12] totally identified that you are
[46:14] receiving it from Joseph and our Joseph
[46:17] is the Lord Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost
[46:20] that is given as the leadership of the
[46:23] church of the living god he is the
[46:26] tzafenat paneah
[46:27] the revealer of the secret things it is
[46:30] him that holds the stewardship and the
[46:33] counselor life he is the milk ascetic
[46:36] that is in our myth and he is revealing
[46:38] himself and revealing the secrets of our
[46:42] lives so we're not here just for a
[46:46] gathering we have gathered here to meet
[46:50] with our Lord Jesus
[46:51] that's what church is to us now notice
[46:56] how that David you know would take this
[46:58] I I loved reading you know how David's
[47:00] held what David's expressions were in
[47:03] Psalms 23 verse 6 surely goodness and
[47:06] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[47:10] life and I will dwell in the house of
[47:14] the Lord forever now I understand that
[47:18] many of these scriptures that we can
[47:20] read we do understand that it was
[47:22] speaking in a type of the house of God's
[47:25] building that was coming his body where
[47:29] we would be baptized in by one spirit
[47:32] but remember here it does not do away
[47:35] with the gathering in the house of the
[47:38] Lord as a matter of fact all the way
[47:40] through and even in the admonition in
[47:42] the coming of the Lord
[47:44] we are admonished to come to the house
[47:47] of God it is the house of correction
[47:51] whew so here's what David said I will
[47:55] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[47:57] Oh Psalms 26 verse 8 Lord I have loved
[48:02] the habitation of the house and the
[48:05] place where thy non ur dwelleth verse 12
[48:07] my foot standeth in an even place in the
[48:11] congregation's will I bless the Lord I
[48:15] don't know about you but this don't seem
[48:17] like anybody who's coming to see and
[48:19] wonder who's wearing water anything else
[48:21] David said I've got one purpose I want
[48:24] to dwell in the house of God and when I
[48:26] come in the congregation of God I am
[48:28] going to bless the Lord I'm gonna raise
[48:31] my hands I'm going to enter into worship
[48:34] oh my Psalm 65 verse 4 blessed is the
[48:39] man whom thou chooses and calls it to
[48:43] approach unto thee that he may dwell in
[48:45] that courts aren't you glad that he
[48:47] shows you aren't you glad he's drawn you
[48:50] and I to this place he's done that my
[48:54] foot no look at this we shall be
[48:58] satisfied with the goodness of the house
[49:01] even of the holy temple now I want you
[49:06] to look at this here in psalm 66 verse
[49:08] 13 I will go into the house with burnt
[49:14] offerings I will pay thee my vows which
[49:21] my lips have added and my mouth has
[49:25] spoken when I was in trouble you know
[49:29] many times were asking and we're looking
[49:31] to God we come upon situations but you
[49:34] know David is declaring I'm going to go
[49:37] to the house of God and I'm not just
[49:39] going to wait then to offer a praise but
[49:41] when I get into the house of God I am
[49:44] going to worship
[49:45] Tim because he has been with me when I
[49:48] was outside of the house of God glowing
[49:51] about my daily business I am coming here
[49:54] and I'm gonna declare Lord you are
[49:57] faithful Lord thank you for helping me
[50:00] Lord
[50:01] thank you for encouraging me Lord thank
[50:03] you for dropping food my way thank you
[50:06] for giving me strength the Lord never
[50:11] knew you I will offer unto the burnt
[50:14] sacrifices of fatlings with the incense
[50:17] of rams I will offer bullets with goats
[50:21] salem so this this right here this man
[50:26] come into church by the name of David
[50:28] was not one who was a leech this was not
[50:33] one who come that just wanted to see
[50:36] what can they give me I wonder what they
[50:40] can give me
[50:41] I wonder what brother Samuel study well
[50:43] if you were in prayer and your walking
[50:46] with God you realize your walk with God
[50:49] and your prayers it has an effect and
[50:52] deter and actually causes what is
[50:55] studied and brought within this service
[50:57] it's about a relationship outside of
[51:00] these walls Amen it's that Lord I got a
[51:05] need I want to hear from you tonight
[51:09] and I'm gonna bring a sacrifice of
[51:13] praise sometimes it's a sacrifice
[51:18] because you don't feel like it come on
[51:22] somebody but you know it's a time to
[51:25] come and to offer now y'all know what
[51:27] I'm talking about it's our time that
[51:29] we've all got apart when we come to the
[51:32] house of God right here
[51:33] we all got apart now how might as well
[51:37] go ahead and preach right now because I
[51:39] know sometimes our old stinking flash
[51:41] gets in the way and says well you know
[51:43] brother Brian and them you know they I
[51:45] mean they'll really be able to sing and
[51:47] you know the musicians they'll get up
[51:49] there I know my brother and sister you
[51:51] know they're always right there at the
[51:52] door you know I know that they're just
[51:54] really gonna they're gonna be the ones
[51:56] that's going to bring an effect with
[51:58] the service but you see when you realize
[52:00] that you have a part in the service and
[52:04] you might say but you don't know how I
[52:06] feel tonight but when you think about
[52:09] how Paul and Silas felt when they had to
[52:12] and that moment begin to just think upon
[52:15] the goodness of God they begin to sing
[52:17] the songs of the Lord and the presence
[52:20] of God come down brother
[52:22] it brought liberation that night if
[52:24] anybody would have not felt like
[52:27] worshiping they didn't but they didn't
[52:30] worship because they felt like it
[52:32] they worshiped because the Living God is
[52:35] worthy of their worship that's why they
[52:39] were worshiping it would be to God
[52:45] well my David said Psalms 84 verse 10
[52:49] for a day in night courts is better than
[52:53] a thousand Omaha I'd rather be a
[52:56] doorkeeper in the house of my god than
[53:00] to dwell in the tents of wickedness and
[53:06] brother brandon picks that scripture up
[53:08] and brother brandon works it from
[53:10] doorkeeper to door mat now you know what
[53:15] a doormat is a good doormat is something
[53:17] so people can lock their feet on it now
[53:21] I've had doormats in my house they ended
[53:23] up in the garbage because they followed
[53:25] me through the house when I'm going to
[53:27] go wipe my feet they clung to my feet
[53:29] and they followed me all through the
[53:30] house but I want something that's
[53:32] grounded when I go to get my shoes off I
[53:37] can rub them on that ground I can pull
[53:40] them off its rounded and possession its
[53:43] able to handle that rubbing and those
[53:46] shoes can be deposited oh my I tell you
[53:50] blessed God the how our hearts are to be
[53:52] so established and position that one's
[53:55] this comes or that comes or this is said
[53:58] or this idea we are so positioned in
[54:01] Christ that we can say I would rather be
[54:04] a doorkeeper at door
[54:06] in the house of God to dwell in the
[54:08] tents of wickedness the Bible is true it
[54:15] says offenses shall come home I'll you
[54:23] know David thinking like this and David
[54:26] was not he did not see what you and I
[54:29] see and half tonight David was rejoicing
[54:33] on the law thou shalt not thou shalt not
[54:38] David said I'd rather be there now you
[54:45] want
[54:46] look how important this is brother
[54:47] Branham he goes into this in an
[54:49] uncertain sound I know this is simple
[54:51] but look how the Prophet would relate to
[54:53] this you believe there's places that
[54:55] there's atmospheres believe I'm talking
[54:59] about here we are in Ohio again he said
[55:02] I think tomorrow night we're going to
[55:03] have some auditorium or something but I
[55:05] was glad to get to come to the church I
[55:08] like the church I think that brother
[55:11] Sullivan in the event of travel as I
[55:13] found that the best meetings as always
[55:15] in churches I hope I'm not superstitious
[55:17] if I am I don't know it but then when
[55:20] you go into these places where they have
[55:22] amusements and gambling and dances and
[55:24] it just looks to me like there's just
[55:26] little devils sitting around everywhere
[55:28] you know they just kind of a habitation
[55:30] for they just stay there and then you've
[55:33] got to go in and take about five nights
[55:34] to preach all them out you know before
[55:37] you can get the meeting started but in
[55:39] the church house
[55:40] I believe the angels of God encamped
[55:42] around because of saints gathering there
[55:49] the angels of God just don't go up and
[55:52] down their own and say oh there's a
[55:53] church let's go there know the angels of
[55:57] God are here tonight because of you
[56:02] because of saints of God that are
[56:05] gathered here rather this ground I don't
[56:08] know what it was know that it probably
[56:09] was a swamp being in Sheffield I don't
[56:11] know what it was and this church and how
[56:14] you know it was used there by the UPC
[56:16] for all those years but brother when God
[56:19] in has led us to this place and the
[56:22] light that God has sent to us in this
[56:25] hour this message this revelation of
[56:28] Jesus Christ whether this place has
[56:30] become like Bethel was to Jacob a place
[56:34] where we meet face to face with the
[56:36] Living God and lives are changed it's a
[56:40] place where they access into the throne
[56:42] of God and the angels of God are
[56:45] ascending and descending on the ladder
[56:48] of God it is a place that God had
[56:52] sanctified by his presence and his
[56:57] presence is in you the angels of God are
[57:08] here tonight
[57:09] I always think oh brother branham when
[57:14] he told the story about all those
[57:15] Usher's and how he walked down to the
[57:18] platform of Houston brother Brandon
[57:21] gives the numbers sister methi said
[57:23] there wasn't that many Esther's in the
[57:26] meeting
[57:26] she said what it was he was looking in
[57:30] that unseen realm and the angels of God
[57:33] lined it right down there that the
[57:36] Prophet could walk onto the platform
[57:41] this is a promise of glory this is a
[57:46] promise of God you realize that when
[57:48] Elijah was standing there with the hazeh
[57:51] and even remember Gaza was all destruct
[57:54] about what was going on and Elijah told
[57:56] him he said Lord open this man's eyes
[57:59] that he can see the aims of that the
[58:02] heelside Ruben said the hillside was
[58:04] filled with angels you know brother bran
[58:06] told us he'll I should didn't see the
[58:08] Angels but Elijah knew the word and he
[58:11] confidence here what God had said in the
[58:14] word that the angels and TAS around
[58:17] about those who have had that serious
[58:19] name he didn't tell him but he had
[58:24] confidence in the word because he knew
[58:27] the god of the word the angels of God
[58:32] are here tonight because saints are
[58:36] gathered here
[58:36] it's a noted place for God where he
[58:40] comes and meets with his people well he
[58:44] says that's always seemed kind of good
[58:47] to me to be in a church she said I liked
[58:49] it better it seems like a home you know
[58:51] he said it's where we just fellowship
[58:53] together and have things in common now
[58:56] the scriptures here and Hebrews chapter
[58:59] 10 verse 23 I want you to notice these
[59:02] words let us hold fast the profession of
[59:06] our faith without wavering for he is
[59:12] faithful that promise and let us
[59:18] consider one another to provoke unto
[59:22] love and to good works no doubt every
[59:28] one of us we'd like to be able to we
[59:30] want to provoke insight on to love and
[59:33] good words there's a lot of other
[59:35] provocation that goes on that not not be
[59:39] but this is the kind of provoking that
[59:42] we want to do but you know in order to
[59:43] do that it requires self to be put in
[59:48] the background
[59:50] sometimes when you maybe don't oh you
[59:53] know I don't feel like you know singing
[59:55] tonight or I don't feel like going
[59:57] tonight or I don't feel like this
[59:59] tonight right and you go ahead and you
[1:00:01] push through that you don't know that
[1:00:04] you're very you're very being here can
[1:00:08] be an actual encouragement to somebody
[1:00:11] else
[1:00:14] examples brother brands standing here
[1:00:16] and the devil has been telling him
[1:00:18] nobody loves you
[1:00:20] nobody cares for you but the brand says
[1:00:22] I get gloomy I got to fight them
[1:00:24] temptations he said but then he says I
[1:00:26] look out here and I see people that come
[1:00:29] to the house of God they stayed over to
[1:00:31] hear the word and he says so I put that
[1:00:34] right back in the devil's face and say
[1:00:39] yes there are people who love me and
[1:00:42] they love this word you see it wasn't
[1:00:45] just about they love brother Branham but
[1:00:47] brother Branham was looking at and I
[1:00:48] believe this is where you and I in our
[1:00:50] hearts is is that it's a seeing that
[1:00:52] people that the Lord I want people to
[1:00:55] love the Lord it's not me it's the Lord
[1:00:59] and we love the Lord in the right way
[1:01:01] then we'll love one another the right
[1:01:03] way amen so let us provoke one another
[1:01:08] unto love and good works not forsaking
[1:01:11] the assembling of ourselves together as
[1:01:15] the manner of some is but exhorting one
[1:01:21] another and so much more than much the
[1:01:24] more as you see the Day approaching this
[1:01:27] word forsaking it means to forsake to
[1:01:31] leave to abandon to desert to leave in
[1:01:35] streets helpless totally abandoned
[1:01:38] utterly forsaken it you know what that
[1:01:42] is I'm not caring for when you forsake
[1:01:47] something it doesn't matter whatever
[1:01:49] happens to it happens to see there's no
[1:01:52] burden now I just felt like this this
[1:01:56] admonition is given by Paul the first
[1:02:00] church age messenger there are things
[1:02:02] that Paul was seen as the rest of them
[1:02:05] were seeing that even as that Antichrist
[1:02:08] spirit was creeping in among the
[1:02:11] churches they were seeing this and Paul
[1:02:15] was identifying this that this was
[1:02:18] something that believers who need to be
[1:02:20] admonished on that I know that we might
[1:02:22] look at that and say well if they're
[1:02:24] believers they
[1:02:26] they shouldn't have to be admonished on
[1:02:27] it huh I will agree in the sense that it
[1:02:30] ought to be something within our heart
[1:02:32] that we desire to be in the house of God
[1:02:35] I believe that and I also believe that
[1:02:39] there's times that as we walk here in
[1:02:41] this life that we can get distracted
[1:02:44] with other things but the Holy Ghost he
[1:02:48] will not lose one he will see to it that
[1:02:52] every blessing that he has determined
[1:02:55] for our lives that we don't miss it
[1:02:59] he might have to whip us correctness and
[1:03:02] whatever more but he will get us where
[1:03:05] we need to be oh my so Paul was already
[1:03:10] witnessing these things where there were
[1:03:12] those who were not assembling they had
[1:03:15] begin to break away you know and you
[1:03:18] know when we look at this brother round
[1:03:19] takes this up here in Christ the mystery
[1:03:22] we're familiar with this I want you to
[1:03:23] think of this for a moment because I
[1:03:25] just don't look at the things that are
[1:03:26] spoken I look at the placement of it
[1:03:28] here it is Christ the mystery with
[1:03:31] brother Branham would identify as the
[1:03:33] seventh seal message which Idiot's
[1:03:35] Christ in you and me it that is the
[1:03:39] coming of the Lord in our life that
[1:03:41] makes us ready for the corporal coming
[1:03:44] this was the promise when the body has
[1:03:48] come to completion that cry steps in to
[1:03:52] be fully manifest I don't think there's
[1:03:55] one of us here tonight that would say
[1:03:56] well I don't want him to be fully
[1:03:58] manifested in me but on the contrary we
[1:04:01] would desire and say Lord I want you to
[1:04:03] have the preeminence in my life show me
[1:04:09] Lord if there's any hindrances so here
[1:04:14] the Prophet picks this up and you know
[1:04:17] he says now you've got tapes on it tapes
[1:04:20] on what we believe you got tapes on
[1:04:21] discipline in the church and how we be
[1:04:23] say behave ourselves in the Church of
[1:04:25] God how we got to come here together and
[1:04:29] sit together in heavenly places don't
[1:04:32] stay home
[1:04:36] here is the key if God is in your heart
[1:04:42] that's the key right there if God is in
[1:04:45] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[1:04:48] them doors to open out yonder to get in
[1:04:51] here to fellowship with your brothers if
[1:04:54] you don't don't feel that way then I
[1:04:58] tell you it's time you've got to breathe
[1:05:03] so you mean if I am NOT wanting to come
[1:05:07] to the house of God and fellowship with
[1:05:10] brothers and sisters
[1:05:11] you mean that how to get the prayer yeah
[1:05:13] you need to get to brand and say God
[1:05:15] give me a real experience let the love
[1:05:20] of God comes down in my heart and if
[1:05:23] I've got cold sing then revive me send
[1:05:26] the revival fire and break every hold
[1:05:30] Lord all the distractions of the enemy I
[1:05:33] know the devil has told a lie
[1:05:35] but it's not important for us to go to
[1:05:39] church but I'm telling you believers go
[1:05:42] to church I read to you last week God
[1:05:45] goes to church Jesus goes to church the
[1:05:50] Bible said in the Book of Luke he was in
[1:05:52] the synagogue as was his custom you want
[1:05:57] to know where Jesus was when it was
[1:05:58] church that church that's where Jesus
[1:06:01] was
[1:06:04] Jesus didn't all of a sudden say well I
[1:06:07] got the scrolls and I'm the word made
[1:06:08] flesh we don't got to go to the
[1:06:10] synagogue little Morton or he would have
[1:06:12] been up breaking that word but now it's
[1:06:14] coming to the fulfillment of it that you
[1:06:17] are a dwelling place and the dwelling
[1:06:19] places of God still come together and to
[1:06:23] worship and deliberate amen we come to
[1:06:29] identify what side that were wrong we
[1:06:32] come to hear from God we come to receive
[1:06:35] from God we come that the Holy Ghost
[1:06:37] might move among us and that the gifts
[1:06:40] are present that there's healing of the
[1:06:42] sick that deliverance and opening of
[1:06:45] eyes of the blind we come here with the
[1:06:47] real purpose don't stay home have jobs
[1:06:57] in your heart oh my cuz we're in the
[1:07:04] last days where the Bible exhorted us
[1:07:10] see this is now the scripture was always
[1:07:13] an exhortation down through the ages but
[1:07:16] in this age we see the Day approaching
[1:07:23] we're not looking a far-off brother
[1:07:26] we've arrived this place is in a mess
[1:07:30] it's Ana chaos we have received our day
[1:07:33] and it's message it's time to get out of
[1:07:36] here much more as we see that day
[1:07:44] approaching to do what what's up brother
[1:07:48] BAM place is here to love one another
[1:07:50] with Christian love and divine love to
[1:07:55] assemble ourselves together in heavenly
[1:07:58] places and Christ Jesus
[1:08:00] and love one another this will all men
[1:08:02] know you are my disciples when you have
[1:08:04] loved one for the other
[1:08:06] stay right together so coming to the
[1:08:09] house of God
[1:08:10] maybe I'm just simple so coming to the
[1:08:14] house of God
[1:08:15] to be with the other saints of God and
[1:08:17] the Fellowship around the word is a
[1:08:20] display of divine love I love you but
[1:08:26] this Holy Ghost said through John don't
[1:08:29] let us just love in word but in deed
[1:08:33] oh my faith is not wavering but your
[1:08:39] faith must be displayed by your works if
[1:08:44] your wife's don't declare that faith
[1:08:47] that you are looking and expecting his
[1:08:50] coming then something's wrong
[1:09:00] do we have differences yeah you mean we
[1:09:05] don't all think alike well then how in
[1:09:12] the world can we all come to the same
[1:09:15] church because of him because our focus
[1:09:21] is not on one another I don't have a
[1:09:30] glass of water up here but brother bill
[1:09:32] shared this one with me nothing I mean
[1:09:33] almost a year ago or so I don't know
[1:09:35] maybe it's longer than that but here was
[1:09:37] a woman getting ready to leave church
[1:09:41] pastor there are nothing but a bunch of
[1:09:44] hypocrites there's this and this and
[1:09:46] this and this and this so the pastor
[1:09:49] said Oh before you leave I want you to
[1:09:53] take this glass of water and you have to
[1:09:54] use your imagination I want you to take
[1:09:56] this glass of water and that glass of
[1:09:58] water was filled to the brim so why
[1:10:01] won't you to do I want you to walk all
[1:10:03] the way around this church and I don't
[1:10:04] want you to spill one drop of water
[1:10:07] so here she goes she's careful she makes
[1:10:13] it all the way back I didn't I didn't
[1:10:17] drop her drop the pastor said that's
[1:10:21] right now why was that because I was
[1:10:26] focusing on this that's it that's it
[1:10:31] what are we here to focus on come on
[1:10:39] somebody you see it's what we're here to
[1:10:42] focus on that woman she was focused on
[1:10:45] the right thing but you see as far as in
[1:10:48] the water but that's how it is to be
[1:10:50] when we come to the house of God it's to
[1:10:52] be focused on the Lord the Bremen goes
[1:11:00] into that council there within within
[1:11:03] everything you know but and he deals
[1:11:05] with you know you think a brother's a
[1:11:07] little wrong do you think the sister is
[1:11:08] wrong you say Lord don't let me never
[1:11:10] have the root of bitterness springing up
[1:11:11] cause it will affect him see who's it
[1:11:13] about not you him it'll take the Christ
[1:11:17] right out of my life
[1:11:18] that poison acids of malice and jealousy
[1:11:21] and hatred that will just take the Holy
[1:11:23] Spirit right away from you Christ in you
[1:11:27] the hope of glory
[1:11:27] it will run him from the tabernacle here
[1:11:31] it'll kill the Spirit of God drive it
[1:11:33] away from here it'll hurt your pastor
[1:11:35] it'll do everything don't you do that
[1:11:37] you just lacks that much closer together
[1:11:40] take the buckle as the brother testified
[1:11:43] a minister here the other night how
[1:11:45] about having a buckle seeing it in a
[1:11:47] vision that buckles on the whole armor
[1:11:49] of God just pull around
[1:11:51] tighten up move right up close to one
[1:11:53] another love one another
[1:11:55] anyhow talk nice about one another say
[1:12:00] nice things about one another and then
[1:12:02] God will bless you
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:06] [Applause]
[1:12:09] it's easy to say nice things
[1:12:13] about nice people it's easy to say nice
[1:12:17] things when everybody agrees with you
[1:12:22] but when it comes time for this right
[1:12:25] here you see it's not what I figure the
[1:12:27] Devils on sums up no no no the real
[1:12:29] reality is now it's time for an
[1:12:32] expression out of our lives no we want a
[1:12:37] whole order I want to walk on the water
[1:12:39] Lord I want to heal the sick lord I want
[1:12:40] to do this and what I want to do this
[1:12:42] but remember Jesus also exhibited the
[1:12:46] forgiveness of God come on somebody
[1:12:50] he had Judas was right there with him
[1:12:54] and he never treated Judas different it
[1:13:00] wasn't anything you could say oh yeah I
[1:13:02] think I know the guy now yeah I know the
[1:13:04] guy I can tell I got Jesus looked at him
[1:13:07] nope nope they questioned themselves but
[1:13:17] you see what what this is that this is
[1:13:20] not out of order brother random by the
[1:13:22] Spirit of God is bringing this these are
[1:13:24] things that could cause people to want
[1:13:27] to separate from assembling together
[1:13:32] someone so did this so and so did that
[1:13:34] who's that about that's about you it's
[1:13:38] about you the Bible says love covers a
[1:13:43] multitude of sins now watch how brother
[1:13:46] branham deals with this do you know
[1:13:47] reasoning oh I'll tell you with it this
[1:13:50] outside realm we deal with reasoning and
[1:13:54] you have to battle with reasoning now
[1:13:58] reasoning comes in all sorts of shapes
[1:14:01] and sizes reasoning can come you know in
[1:14:04] a matter of well you know what I'll tell
[1:14:05] you what it's just not gonna be
[1:14:07] convenient for me to be in the house of
[1:14:09] God on Thursday nights I'll tell you
[1:14:11] what I do I'll make sure I catch brother
[1:14:13] so-and-so service on Wednesday and that
[1:14:15] way I fulfilled my duty that ain't your
[1:14:18] church home this is your church home
[1:14:22] if that's what God's declared in your
[1:14:24] life come on somebody if God has
[1:14:27] declared that in your life is to
[1:14:30] recognize that hey you've got a duty
[1:14:32] I've got a part to be here
[1:14:37] reasoning oh man we could deal with this
[1:14:41] a lot reasoning and just deliberating on
[1:14:46] things well you know I think we need to
[1:14:48] do this you know we don't want anything
[1:14:49] to affect you know the children we want
[1:14:52] to give the children we do it and want
[1:14:53] to make them not love the Lord Jesus we
[1:14:56] how about the interesting just say Lord
[1:14:58] I want the love of God to so flow
[1:15:00] through me that they are so captivated
[1:15:03] with you that it's not a worry about oh
[1:15:06] I can't the problem of this and I can't
[1:15:07] take this from them and I can't do this
[1:15:09] and I can't do that why would you let
[1:15:11] the devil put fear in your heart the
[1:15:15] Bible says that good you they and their
[1:15:18] offspring shall be there with them and
[1:15:21] the promise is through the book of songs
[1:15:25] it's important in this hour let's not
[1:15:29] let's cast down reasoning
[1:15:38] I'll tell you this right here when it
[1:15:40] come down than my boys you know we
[1:15:43] looked at the one time we were going to
[1:15:45] let him play t-ball or a baseball or I
[1:15:47] don't know what it was a little league
[1:15:49] ball I'm not against that but you know
[1:15:53] what happened we got to looking at it
[1:15:55] you know what it was
[1:15:56] he's on Thursday nights so guess what
[1:16:01] you went prayed about it nope I don't
[1:16:03] have to pray about it didn't need to
[1:16:06] pray about it
[1:16:07] well you're the pastor you could change
[1:16:09] the day of service that would be selfish
[1:16:11] and in changing for myself this is where
[1:16:17] God has set on this day that we would
[1:16:21] have service on Thursday I can guarantee
[1:16:24] you if we moved it on Wednesday to
[1:16:27] accommodate lives or Tuesday the devil
[1:16:30] would see to it that the activities were
[1:16:32] planned on that day you've got to make a
[1:16:35] decision as for me and my house we will
[1:16:40] serve the Lord I'm going to make a
[1:16:46] decision for the Lord I tell you God
[1:16:52] will bless you for it
[1:16:54] [Music]
[1:16:56] what's wrong with the RAM says in first
[1:16:58] thing for life
[1:17:00] he says this wolf and the deer come up
[1:17:04] this wolf if he can catch a little deer
[1:17:06] out to itself that's the one they work
[1:17:08] on he said there's a lesson if he can
[1:17:11] catch a deer away from the herd then he
[1:17:13] that's what the devil wants to do talks
[1:17:16] about you know young ladies what what
[1:17:18] counsel its simplicity what counsel you
[1:17:22] young ladies he wants you to go out with
[1:17:24] a boy that's not a Christian to you
[1:17:27] young men he wants you to go out with
[1:17:29] some little painted Jezebel that's not a
[1:17:31] Christian there he wants to break you up
[1:17:34] that's what he wants to suck his teeth
[1:17:36] into you the death was only using them
[1:17:39] much a puppet as he used the serpent in
[1:17:42] the garden once he did what he did he
[1:17:46] let her go come on somebody it was only
[1:17:50] a puppet and then Satan's the biggest
[1:17:54] trick that Satan has is to get somebody
[1:17:58] isolated off to themselves now
[1:18:04] understand this you can be in a big
[1:18:06] crowd of people and you still be
[1:18:07] isolated have walked down malls and
[1:18:12] places and shopping places and there are
[1:18:14] people that I'm having excused and I'm
[1:18:16] bumping elbows with and yet I feel so
[1:18:19] all alone you know why there's nobody
[1:18:22] there there's nothing there that I can
[1:18:25] fellowship with but I love to be around
[1:18:30] believers then I can fellowship with it
[1:18:34] we've got things in common brother we've
[1:18:38] got a message that God has sent to you
[1:18:40] and I Oh now the real genuine Holy Ghost
[1:18:44] in this hour we can fellowship around
[1:18:47] this word it's changing us oh my
[1:18:54] this little deer what's how brother man
[1:18:56] goes on to put this this little deer
[1:18:59] will get out to itself away from the
[1:19:02] herd that's the one the wolf works and
[1:19:07] to you old man or woman when you
[1:19:10] separate yourself from believers notice
[1:19:12] when you separate yourself from
[1:19:16] believers people say I can stay at home
[1:19:19] and be just a good a Christian as I can
[1:19:23] at church you can't nor the RAM quotes
[1:19:29] the scripture you forsake to assemble
[1:19:31] yours no don't forgive forsake to
[1:19:33] assemble ourselves together and that
[1:19:35] much more as you see the time to come in
[1:19:37] if you're a Christian here it is again
[1:19:40] if you're a Christian you love to stream
[1:19:47] maybe my maybe it's the Apple device I
[1:19:51] don't know many if you're a Christian
[1:19:54] you long to go where other Christians
[1:19:58] are and fellowship with other Christians
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:03] if you're a Christian so you cannot stay
[1:20:08] away from church and live the same life
[1:20:12] you can't do it he said because it's
[1:20:14] like I'm hungry but I'll never go to the
[1:20:15] table I'll never eat I ain't going to do
[1:20:18] it you've got to go and feed on the word
[1:20:21] of God and fellowship with one another
[1:20:26] two parts feed and fellowship personal
[1:20:35] differences
[1:20:37] we have them
[1:20:41] some people like maybe this they like
[1:20:45] this song this people like we've got
[1:20:46] personal differences but in order for
[1:20:50] unity in order for unity it's going to
[1:20:56] require setting aside personal
[1:21:00] differences I'll tell you where personal
[1:21:04] differences become damnable is when
[1:21:07] personal differences become Dogma you
[1:21:12] say how do you know when it becomes
[1:21:13] doubler a self-righteous critical spirit
[1:21:17] enters and it becomes dogma that's where
[1:21:24] it begins to break and the very thing
[1:21:26] that a person say I want this and I want
[1:21:29] that and they don't recognize the very
[1:21:31] spirit that is motivating their life is
[1:21:34] the very thing that they're not wanting
[1:21:36] and yet here they are being formed into
[1:21:38] that same thing that's deception
[1:21:43] deception personal differences so in
[1:21:48] order for unity
[1:21:51] it requires us to be able to lay aside
[1:21:54] differences for a common vision and that
[1:21:58] common vision we come we come together
[1:22:00] for and that's for the edifying of the
[1:22:02] body of Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] what's our brother branham words this he
[1:22:08] says we need one another more now than
[1:22:12] we did need each other than we ever did
[1:22:15] meet each other is now brother Samuel I
[1:22:19] don't need you well I need you I need
[1:22:24] you I'm not talking about I need you so
[1:22:27] I've got somebody to preach you that's
[1:22:28] what I'm talking I need you I need your
[1:22:32] prayers your fellowship when you look at
[1:22:39] this statement when you get yourself
[1:22:41] singled out from the rest of them making
[1:22:47] yourself a list a little different you
[1:22:52] don't want to associate with them
[1:22:53] because they believe this
[1:22:55] and don't want to associate with that
[1:22:58] you're getting on dangerous ground right
[1:23:02] then keeping away from church so what's
[1:23:09] what's going on here
[1:23:10] is this somebody doing it no it's it's
[1:23:13] them the person making themselves
[1:23:17] different
[1:23:20] they're the ones putting up walls now it
[1:23:24] can be wall wear it so on so offended me
[1:23:28] this one offended me this offended me
[1:23:30] and this are this friends listen
[1:23:33] offenses are real but you've got to have
[1:23:36] discernment to recognize it is the
[1:23:40] devil's objective to try to cause you to
[1:23:43] forsake to assemble together let me just
[1:23:48] tell you something right now
[1:23:49] you see patterns many times that can
[1:23:52] follow within people's lives families
[1:23:54] and whatever more it becomes a pattern
[1:23:57] they can come to church for a year and
[1:23:59] then they're in another church then
[1:24:01] they're at this church then they're
[1:24:03] districts it's a pattern
[1:24:04] the problem isn't churches the problem
[1:24:09] is the people you know why that is it's
[1:24:14] the enemy getting in there and it starts
[1:24:17] to form themselves and make themselves a
[1:24:20] little different it's not God listen
[1:24:24] God's not an isolationist he's a
[1:24:27] separation Asst and the kind of
[1:24:30] separation that God has is here Jesus
[1:24:33] was in the world yet not of the world he
[1:24:37] walked among sinners yet he did not put
[1:24:40] take of their sin it was a separated
[1:24:44] life Jesus didn't say I can't go against
[1:24:46] you no you want members and you this and
[1:24:49] you guys are filthy once you all get all
[1:24:51] sanctified and cleaned up and you know
[1:24:53] you really get a good experience then I
[1:24:55] can begin to associate with you that
[1:24:58] ain't how Jesus approached it brother he
[1:25:00] came to give life and to give life more
[1:25:03] abundantly the Pharisees had a lot of
[1:25:06] religion but nobody was attracted to
[1:25:09] their self-righteous religion there
[1:25:15] ought to be an attraction in our life an
[1:25:19] attraction isn't holding up a message
[1:25:22] book it's that that same message is
[1:25:24] living of Jesus Christ it's living in
[1:25:27] our lives
[1:25:29] he's the attraction in this hour
[1:25:33] watch this find the one of your choice I
[1:25:37] know this is simple find the one of your
[1:25:40] choice you mean every church is not a
[1:25:42] cookie cutter you mean every one of them
[1:25:46] don't look like Brandon Tabernacle you
[1:25:49] mean they don't in me God's not a cookie
[1:25:52] cutter God well he said find the one of
[1:25:55] your choice saint jesus same holy ghost
[1:26:05] same gospel but gods are got a variety
[1:26:09] and so God would even say you know what
[1:26:13] there'll be one that you like there'll
[1:26:15] be certain things about that it'll just
[1:26:17] it'll fit right there then it's not just
[1:26:20] about what fits you it's about coming
[1:26:23] into that vision it's about recognizing
[1:26:27] God speaking personally to me right here
[1:26:29] the stewardship of my life is being
[1:26:32] unfolded amen now look at this here let
[1:26:36] me just
[1:26:36] I'm trying trying to get down here look
[1:26:39] at this look can I have just a few more
[1:26:40] moments brother BAM goes on again here
[1:26:43] he is he's talking about you know the
[1:26:47] different churches he's out in the
[1:26:48] middle of having meetings and he says
[1:26:50] here the second paragraph you visitors
[1:26:52] here now that's out of town that's been
[1:26:54] here there's some mighty fine churches
[1:26:56] around town here he's got a mighty nice
[1:26:59] church up here and these other two
[1:27:01] ministers here I suppose cooperating
[1:27:02] I've never met back here and there's
[1:27:04] some mighty fine churches and we want
[1:27:06] you to attend one of those Church some
[1:27:08] of those churches in the morning and the
[1:27:09] Church of your choice
[1:27:13] Oh variety and if you're a member of
[1:27:17] some church why you stand at your post
[1:27:21] of duty tomorrow yes and I want to
[1:27:25] appreciate brother Glen for making this
[1:27:27] meeting on Sunday afternoon too close
[1:27:28] because it shows a real fellowship and a
[1:27:31] real Brotherhood among men and we want
[1:27:33] every person to stand at their post of
[1:27:35] duty at their church where that's your
[1:27:37] place that's your duty to be there if
[1:27:42] you help pool I'll get through a quicker
[1:27:44] but I don't think we're quite finished
[1:27:46] with the subject I've always tried to
[1:27:49] make it a custom to close on Sunday
[1:27:53] afternoon with my service on Sunday
[1:27:56] afternoon and after we get the gospel
[1:27:57] tent we'll do the same thing be closed
[1:27:59] up on Sunday afternoon after the Sunday
[1:28:01] afternoon service and have no morning
[1:28:03] service so that people can attend their
[1:28:05] own church sounds to me like the Prophet
[1:28:08] was interested in people being in their
[1:28:11] home church amen he was interested in
[1:28:17] that that he would make sure there was
[1:28:19] no conflict so they could get in their
[1:28:22] own church why that's their post it's
[1:28:26] like if you're supposed to man the
[1:28:27] artillery well you know there somebody
[1:28:30] else will get in there you know they'll
[1:28:31] get somebody else no you're the man they
[1:28:33] artillery it might be you're pulling
[1:28:37] within this service right here that it
[1:28:39] brings the presence of God down in this
[1:28:42] service oh brother Samuel what about if
[1:28:46] I want to go on vacation what no these
[1:28:48] we're not talking about not going on
[1:28:49] vacation we're not talking about that
[1:28:51] it's against visiting other churches
[1:28:53] that's not what that's not what's being
[1:28:55] said here what's being said is be at
[1:28:58] your post of duty it let it be something
[1:29:02] in your heart that you recognize I have
[1:29:05] got to be there this is service times
[1:29:08] and I service in the morning I'm gonna
[1:29:10] be there in the house of God not just
[1:29:14] because we're coming to a church but
[1:29:16] we're coming to meet with God
[1:29:21] we feel that every person is duty-bound
[1:29:24] to attend some church and belong to some
[1:29:31] church as a Christian where do you go to
[1:29:34] church
[1:29:35] oh we just visit Oh floater
[1:29:43] there's a quote floater ramblin rolling
[1:29:48] stone moving from pillar to post come on
[1:29:53] friends there there up to be a place
[1:29:56] notice you find a church of your choice
[1:29:59] and you belong to that church you had
[1:30:03] pinned that church you get in that
[1:30:06] vision of that assembly you know it's
[1:30:08] just like this of a person comes my lord
[1:30:11] a person comes and they say you know
[1:30:14] what I'm gonna make this right here you
[1:30:16] know what I'm gonna make this my own
[1:30:17] church brother Simon I think there's
[1:30:18] some things you need to do this and I
[1:30:20] think you need to do this and I think
[1:30:21] you need to do this and I'm gonna tell
[1:30:23] you I think you need to go on past us
[1:30:31] because this this church black brother
[1:30:34] Jonathan's church is led by the Holy
[1:30:36] Ghost it's the same God a sovereign God
[1:30:41] and remember this now when brother
[1:30:43] Branham member when he walked out of a
[1:30:44] Baptist Church many people look at that
[1:30:46] and say he wasn't going to ordain women
[1:30:48] ministers that is true but brother
[1:30:50] Graham said the reason I gave up my card
[1:30:53] is because the Baptist Church where I
[1:30:55] was going gave up their local
[1:30:58] sovereignty to where it became a control
[1:31:03] how fair but to recognize it's not a
[1:31:06] control out there but the Living God
[1:31:08] that's directing and leading the Church
[1:31:11] of the Living God the pillar fire the
[1:31:13] angel of the Lord is right here to
[1:31:16] direct the Church of the Living clock
[1:31:18] all the way into the rapture if I go by
[1:31:23] the way of the grave God's got another
[1:31:25] vessel that the same age of the Lord
[1:31:27] will use a little
[1:31:29] keep marching many people say well I
[1:31:38] stay home and read my Bible I'm just as
[1:31:42] well-off wonder if they got Hebrews 10
[1:31:46] in there
[1:31:46] I mean wonder I'm just a list of the
[1:31:51] message what if they had what did what
[1:31:53] did they do with the part well everybody
[1:31:55] ought to have a pastor I know I know how
[1:31:59] things get reasoned out but notice he
[1:32:02] said no the Bible said we shouldn't
[1:32:05] forsake to assemble ourselves together
[1:32:07] we've got to do that we've got to stand
[1:32:11] together and all the churches I'm trying
[1:32:17] not to be brother Andrew a favorite
[1:32:19] preacher tonight I am closer tray tables
[1:32:27] are up Sitra up everything's ready for
[1:32:29] landing

[1:32:33] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath
[1:32:35] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:32:39] in heavenly places in Christ program
[1:32:45] would take that scripture and he talks
[1:32:46] about he says I'm prayed up
[1:32:48] you're prayed up he said here we are as
[1:32:50] Saints baptized in the Holy Ghost
[1:32:53] he said when we come together and all he
[1:32:55] said we sat in heavenly places he said
[1:32:58] what a meeting we have he said how many
[1:33:00] ever been in a meeting like that I've
[1:33:03] been there he said you don't want to
[1:33:05] hardly leave why it's there in heavenly
[1:33:08] places brother bran picks that up right
[1:33:14] up there Scripture imposition of a
[1:33:16] believer in Christ now the fellow said
[1:33:18] how can be a Christian and stay home
[1:33:20] just as well no you can't no you've got
[1:33:24] to meet together with the rest of the
[1:33:26] body we're by the sample you know you've
[1:33:28] got streaming you might want to be
[1:33:31] careful if you can be in the house of

[1:33:37] you the marriage supper of the lamb you

[1:34:03] rest of the body he has blessed us
[1:34:04] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:34:07] Jesus
[1:34:08] let me just read just to just a couple
[1:34:11] of things here
[1:34:11] dicey time closing here fine thing was
[1:34:16] of this fine thing that I ever have to
[1:34:18] happen to me is when I can come to the
[1:34:21] house of the Lord I can be so tired and
[1:34:26] wore out and upset that probably covers
[1:34:32] all of us here tonight and only can bite
[1:34:34] us in the back here beside me I can be
[1:34:37] tired wore out and upset but just let me
[1:34:44] get to the house of the Lord where all
[1:34:47] the saints are gathered and pray then I
[1:34:50] go to feeling better right away there's
[1:34:56] something soothing about it and it's not
[1:35:01] frankincense in a diffuser it's the Holy
[1:35:05] Ghost and that's being diffused from
[1:35:09] Locke the real it's since your oil it's
[1:35:13] just moving through it has a way to
[1:35:15] bring peace it has a way to soothe you
[1:35:23] walk into that door back there brother
[1:35:25] Carlos standing right there you might
[1:35:28] have to look down the scene but he
[1:35:31] stands right there to say God bless you
[1:35:34] at that big old smile welcome to the
[1:35:37] house of God brother bill standing there
[1:35:41] brother Gomez standing there welcome to
[1:35:43] the house of God
[1:35:47] what is that that's doorkeepers Omaha
[1:35:52] that's a different message then I'd go
[1:35:55] to feeling better right away there's
[1:35:57] something soothing about it something
[1:35:59] all he says don't you just think so
[1:36:01] rather something that just soothes and
[1:36:03] seems to iron out all the wrinkles and
[1:36:07] you're just satisfied in the presence of
[1:36:15] the Lord that same presence that we have
[1:36:20] been invited into that same presence
[1:36:24] that goes with us he said I'll never
[1:36:26] leave you nor forsake you that same God
[1:36:29] who made a way that he can come and
[1:36:32] dwell within our lives
[1:36:36] every day as a prophet told us we are
[1:36:40] the Temple of the Living God he said God
[1:36:43] goes to church God lives in you God
[1:36:46] warships every day how does it God
[1:36:50] worship in our lives by us letting him
[1:36:53] have the right away and he expresses his
[1:36:56] life through us
[1:36:58] it's worship it's adoration back to the
[1:37:04] Living God circumstances like that of
[1:37:09] where we read here with Saul things can
[1:37:11] come we can feel tired we can feel wore
[1:37:14] out we can feel upset
[1:37:16] you can get cold but you can also say
[1:37:21] Lord I'm gonna tighten up the bottle and
[1:37:24] that tightening up of the buckle is ask
[1:37:27] him say Lord I need a fresh refilling of
[1:37:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:34] you know what I mean a fresh refilling
[1:37:38] David asked the Lord he never asked the
[1:37:40] Lord for salvation he said restore to me
[1:37:43] the joy of thy salvation if there's
[1:37:47] cares and things of life and there are
[1:37:49] there is such a compounding of demonic
[1:37:52] oppression upon this age this is an
[1:37:56] erotic age Satan every one of his guns
[1:38:00] is upon you as the believer but let me
[1:38:06] just tell you no weapon formed against
[1:38:09] you if God be for us and he is then who
[1:38:15] can be against us God just comes down

[1:44:15] whoa
[1:44:20] I trust tonight before we bow our heads
[1:44:24] in prayer you recognize the great
[1:44:28] responsibility that placed within our
[1:44:31] hearts our lives to find that of a home
[1:44:37] church I believe I'm looking at here
[1:44:40] tonight you've found a place that God
[1:44:44] has identified to you but I want you to
[1:44:48] understand and know that what God has
[1:44:52] identified to you and how he speaks to
[1:44:56] you personally I want you to understand
[1:44:58] he values your worship he values you
[1:45:03] being here as a believer priest not just
[1:45:07] to be here in the in these pews but it
[1:45:10] is being here
[1:45:14] it's showing yourself sacrificing and I
[1:45:21] know there's times situations arise but
[1:45:25] friends listen we all know that really
[1:45:27] in our heart and I'm just I'll encourage
[1:45:30] you tonight as your pastor and those who
[1:45:33] are streaming don't let that take the
[1:45:37] place if you can be in the house of God
[1:45:38] be in the house of God you what you
[1:45:42] don't know is sometimes the extra effort
[1:45:45] and the sacrifice that you make god
[1:45:46] bless the sacrifice you might be going
[1:45:51] through the biggest trial or might be
[1:45:53] going coming into one of the trials of
[1:45:54] your life and I'll tell you one of the
[1:45:57] wonderful promises that God spoke to us
[1:45:59] through the Prophet in this hour
[1:46:01] he said you show me a man or woman
[1:46:03] that'll put God first and everything he
[1:46:07] said I'll show you a man or woman
[1:46:08] that'll come out on top despite whatever
[1:46:11] the devil can put on it
[1:46:13] God made that known to you and I through
[1:46:16] the messenger in this hour amen
[1:46:20] I don't really believe that to be true
[1:46:21] I've proved that but I've got to keep on
[1:46:24] you got to keep on it isn't just one
[1:46:27] enough we check it off and say what did
[1:46:29] that know it's constant but you know
[1:46:33] what
[1:46:33] he's just falling in love with him the
[1:46:37] more you fall in love with him then the
[1:46:40] things that he asked of us and it's a
[1:46:42] delight to be in the house of God and as
[1:46:45] I said tonight if you find in your heart
[1:46:47] you find a little coldness that's
[1:46:50] growing in there just let God remedy
[1:46:54] that
[1:46:54] if you find that you're missing that
[1:46:57] fire of God all together and it's just
[1:46:59] something it just comes and goes it
