as he is as the scripture says amen to know as we are known amen by revelation amen trust that's your desire tonight not come to gather together just to perform a religious ritual amen some sort of uh you know uh just a religious work but we believe in a god who speaks amen a god who can be contacted a god who's a god whose angel walks the aisles amen his spirit broods over his people we can touch him and amen and more importantly he can touch us tonight amen and give to us what we have need of god bless you it's always such a pleasure to be with the folks here believer spoken word tabernacle just my home away from home and you know me and i know you and it's just wonderful to have the relationship that we have the love and the unity as as just believers of this message so we appreciate appreciate my hero brother samuel amen uh invited me to be here with you and trust the lord using him in a mighty way i believe he's down at the youth camp this week right amen so god bless you all let's stand and go to the reading of the word so i don't want to keep you long tonight i just want to take a real simple thought tonight something lord's been dealing with me on and trust it'll be a blessing as you bear with me tonight i'm not my best voice about a week ago i got home from a preaching trip overseas and and we came home a little bit under the weather and and still feeling a little jet lagged tonight so i appreciate brother nathan riding along with me his job is to get me home tonight alive so i can preach as hard as i want tonight and somebody else is driving home so praise the lord for that amen so just covet your prayers tonight god will just help us uh james chapter five if i didn't say already and we're going to read verses 16 to 18 there little thought tonight on like passions like passions you love the lord tonight yes amen you got to help me preach tonight praise the lord brother if you uh could turn my monitors up just a little bit it'll help my throat tonight as well james chapter 5 verses 16. of course a very familiar reading of scripture here's where we get the scripture for you know the anointing of oil and uh uh one of the one of the the rights sort of that we observe in the church for praying for the sick but i i think there's just a there's a wonderful little phrase here james uses this phrase like passions that really has a special meaning to me and it's something that's just opened up to me recently so we asked the lord to help us to bring it out james says confess your faults one to another and pray for one another that you may be healed for the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years in six months and he prayed again the heaven gave rain and the earth brought forth her fruit so the great miraculous work that elijah performed james using it to show the power of the prayer of a believer but he wants to insert this phrase in here he wants to have this little reminder for all of us that this great thing that was done was done through a man of like passions amen so this this scripture this this picture of the power and the authority of a believer would not be complete without those like passions god help us to bring it out tonight heavenly father i just thank you lord for these lovely people father and certainly we have a friendship here lord and a love lord and a burden that we want to be a help lord to this assembly lord as as we do your people everywhere lord but especially dear friends and father there's just there's there's nothing quite like standing at the beginning of a of a service lord for a minister lord where we're so faced with our insufficiency lord but we we freely confess lord our our frailty as as human beings lord we're not capable lord although we'd have the we'd have the heart to do it lord but we're not capable father of of of addressing the the very real needs that people of god are facing father in our own humanity we don't have the power lord to to help one another or certainly we would we wouldn't withhold it but but father we don't look to a man or a man's ability tonight father not the intelligence of a man to put a sermon together nor the intelligence lord of a human being to receive that sermon and and dissect it lord and interpret it but father tonight we know that you must be the speaker and father you must also be the interpreter lord and and father we're totally trusting we know upon the the the the holy ghost to come amongst us lord take complete control of these earthen vessels father for we're men and women of like passions lord but father if your holy ghost could have the preeminence we know lord that you could do great things lord that you could speak to hearts that you could just meet the need father tonight and that's what we're desiring father that we could just get out of the way and you could come in father and use use lord the foolishness of preaching father to bring us a little bit higher into you father into a closer fellowship into a greater revelation may it be so father for we dedicate ourselves to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you as you're seated tonight amen i love this little quote uh brother brandon says uh that it just sort of sets the direction of my thought for tonight he says unworthy is right lord it's brother branham in prayer in one of his his messages he says unworthy is right but if you were looking for holy hands tonight where would you find him for we've all sinned and come short of the glory but oh how we're encouraged to read in the scripture that elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are it wasn't his morals but it was what you had called him to be and what he did with the gift that you give him amen what a what a beautiful thought elijah being a man of like passions elijah it wasn't who elijah was it wasn't the substance of his humanity his merit you know his abilities that god was able to use but it was just the gift that god put in him and a man of god being able to get out of the way and great things could be done amen it's a powerful scripture when you just begin to when you when you when when that element of it opens up to you it's talking speaking here of course like we said of of one of the great works of elijah's ministry just one of the great just outwardly supernatural things that a prophet performed in his life when you know when when when when by prayer he he literally he literally held back the powers of nature and and and withheld the rain from entire land and amen and then with praying again he could restore it just on command you know uh showing absolute power over the natural realm and over over the patterns of weather and just these big you know uh these these cosmic forces of the earth you know were subject to the man elijah and and and and so james is is drawing on this example to show us the power of a believer but but but but but he's doing it in a way not to just explain how great elijah was that's not james's intention here it's not to say look at look at how powerful you know the prayer of elijah was because elijah was a prophet and elijah was this great man but but he wants to make sure that it's very clear that this man that could do this is a man who was subject to the same passions the same humanity the same feelings and and and and just human element that you and i are subject to he was he was a he was a man of like passion so and and it's showing that uh that not how great elijah was but how great a thing god could do through a man that was just like you or me amen that's very powerful to me you know it's you know uh it's showing that in spite of all the great miracles that elijah performed and and we've had an elijah ministry in our day and we can we can talk about supernatural we could talk about great things that were done and healings and miracles and and and and great power and the ex even the exercising of that third pull that adoption authority all these things that we've witnessed were were things that were done through human beings just like you or me amen because uh uh because you know uh elijah was not uh an angel from heaven he wasn't some angelic being he wasn't like a a super spiritual class a person you know that he just never he never you know he just lived up in a realm that was way above you and i no it's not the way it was he was he was a regular guy he was a he was a man he was a human being and and that's that's that's something that's so important for us to remember you know because we have this this tendency in our human nature uh where where we look at we look at what god has done in the past we look at saints of old or we look at people that we look up to or ministries that have come before us or messengers or or or or miracle workers and and all the great things that god has done when in with the benefit of hindsight we look back at those great miraculous works and and we just sort of put them on a pedestal in our mind we we just have that tendency of human nature of of of make these saints of the bible and saints of the history of the church we we make them into just larger than life figures we we turn them into legends we turn them into we put them way up here somewhere as as something that was so powerful you know that that nothing like that had maybe been done before and nothing nothing like it that will ever be done again you know that's just sort of our attitude toward it but but you know the bible wasn't written for legends that's not what this bible was written for to take things that god did in the past and say well you know god used to heal and he used to deliver and he used to do the supernatural and he used to do marvelous works and and men of god used to have authority and sons and daughters of god used to have an effective prayer that that's not what it's about and amen in fact commandment number one in the bible is you're not going to have any idols before me so anytime you take another human being or the the life of another person or the things that that are performed in some other ministry as soon as you take those things and then put them up in a realm somewhere where you cannot attain to that place and to where to where it's something that we can't attain to you've just made an idol out of a work of the lord amen because you put that between you and god somewhere out of reach amen you're not supposed to do that amen just like paul and barnabas you know but it's in our human nature we see that with paul and barnabas they go to a certain city and they raise up a crippled man and they heal him and all immediately all the people rush in and say oh we got to worship these guys because one of them is you know i think mercury and another one's jupiter or something we gotta we gotta worship these guys these are these are super human people you know these are these are some kind of demigods or something and and that was that's just the natural human response to to do that but paul and barnabas they begin to you know wail and rip their clothes they say don't don't worship us we're men of like passions don't don't don't worship us we're we're just here to prove that there's a god who can do these things amen amen so we find that the bible is not the story of who god used to be and what he used to be and the things that god used to do you know and he used to he used to be a certain thing and neither is the message the story of what god used to be if you think this message is about what god did in prayer lines 60 70 years ago and you know the the miraculous things that were that happened in the life of a of a prophet and it's just all about you know hunting stories and things like that and and well if you weren't born back then i'm sorry i guess you missed it no that's not what the message is about amen but the by the message is not for legends the bible is not for legends but these things are showing us amen to prove to you that anything is possible to any human being that is surrendered to god amen when brother branham brought this message it brought an excitement to people those of you maybe that that remember though those early days of the message what was the cry what was the the watch word what was what were people what was the passion on people's hearts was to say to to say look bible days are here again anyone ever heard that one bible days are here again this is not a god of history amen but but but brother bran's ministry was showing to us this is a real and living god who can do the same things he used to do so the god of peter is here that's what the message says paul's god is here elijah's god is here amen to will and do amen amen so so the they're put in there not to make you know some uh not to make an idol out of a human being but to show you what's possible in a life that's surrendered to god so elijah is not just who we should admire elijah's who we could be amen well you well you know of course you may not have the gift of prophecy like elijah had it might not be your ministry you know to to to perform the miracles like like elijah mir perform but but yet you can know elijah's god that's the that's the real point of it that there's a real living god that can be that can do the supernatural in your life and can be sufficient for you the way that he was for elijah amen amen brother brahm said god uses man and man only amen and god doesn't use machinery god doesn't use groups of men no sir god doesn't use organizations he said god always uses individuals amen that means god didn't come to build a church on what william branham did for the lord or what elijah did for the lord he didn't come to build a group around that or an organization amen but elijah's god came to draw individual humanity to himself and say look uh elijah's ministry proves i am a real god then if i'm god then serve me amen if i do the supernatural then serve me believe me if i've proven that i'm a healer then i'm here to heal you if i've proven i'm a deliverer i'm here to deliver you i'm here to be your comforter i'm here to be a god that speaks not an idol not not uh you know not a god of history god uses individuals amen but but it's a beautiful thing to have to have like passions everyone knows what that means it means you know we have like passions so we we feel the same things we feel the same things uh we go through the same we we experience life in a similar way so maybe the circumstances of my life are not the same as yours and yet we can understand one another we can relate to one another because we have like passions we feel the same and and we find that human beings are very emotional creatures we're very emotional but we're very similar in our emotions we can understand one another in our emotions thank the lord you know uh you you ever you where you want to see the just the emotional side of humanity i think the best book of the bible for that is the book of psalms because psalms is a book of expression it's a book where the psalmists you know are are writing some poetry or the or a song or lyrics which are expressing something that's down in their heart and it just it really shows the like passions of humanity to me you know because the psalms are so powerful in expressing the things that they express they express sorrow they express you know guilt they express joy they express peace they express these things in a way that you or i can identify with that and yet when you think about the writer of the psalms i think many times about about king david and how how alien his life is to the human experience that you and i are living to the experience of somebody in in the year 2022 living in america and lay out a cn dispensation it's a it's very different you know to think about you know i don't have any servants at my house it would be nice sometimes but i don't you know i don't but i don't have a you know i don't have people that work for me and they labor for me but here's david he's a monarch he's he's got absolute authority over a kingdom he's got hundreds of servants at his beck and call he's he's he's moving armies around the map and and and he's got this military power he's got all these different things i only have one wife at home but david had at least eight so clearly he was living a very different experience than what i'm accustomed to you know and here david you know he's living in a he so he's living this life of just absolute authority you know the head of a kingdom and he's living in the bronze age david never had an iphone dev david never got on facebook david never paid you know played a a a candy crush on his on his iphone and you know checked his tweets and he never he never experienced the world the way that you and i are experiencing it's a different society it's a different time it's a it's a totally different human experience and yet you can read those psalms amen and and and they can be so real and so relevant to what you're feeling amen until tears just begin to run down your eyes and amen it's showing that it's showing the universal experience of a human heart that's crying out for god it's a beautiful thing to have like passions of humanity to have to know that there's things below the superficial level you know of the conditions that we're living in and the lifestyle that we're used to and the technology around us and all those things way down below that is something so real and so fundamental to being a human being that it just flows from your heart amen when when david says all have mercy upon me oh lord for i am in trouble you can relate to that because you know what it is to be in trouble you know what it is to cry out to god say god i'm in a mess right now but but god my heart is crying out for a living god somebody who can get me out of where i'm in amen when he says show me thy ways o lord teach me thy past and that that scripture means so much to me there in psalms 119 i remember reading that as a young man and just that desire that dave is expressing saying god i want to know you i want to understand you i want to have fellowship with you teach me your ways teach me let me understand you show me lord oh that means so much to me as a young man it still does but i remember tears just running down my face reading that scripture because david's speaking the very expression of my heart when he says my soul longeth even fainteth for the courts of the lord my heart and my flesh are crying out for the living god amen then you and i can feel that passion because to be human is to yearn for god to be human is to yearn for god everyone yearns for god and some people press it way down and try to drown it out with worldly pursuits and pleasures and things like that but to be human is to feel these feelings is to yearn for this god the living god amen it's a beautiful thing it's showing the like passions of humanity and i i'm building to something with this i know that it's simple but it's very powerful actually because it's very fundamental to just who we are and what we are but to be human is to yearn for god that's why brother branson said no wonder people today will crawl on their knees you know they'll touch stones and rub crosses and because something in the human soul is crying out for something that they can't find amen it's the deep calling to the deep and if there's a deep calling there has to be a deep to respond amen there has to be as sure as the warm sun bathes across the fields amen but and down somewhere beneath invisible to the human eye brother brown said there's vegetation there's life that will spring forth when that sun comes over that field as sure as the sunlight of god he said baze into the human heart there's a little hidden something there that men can't explain and it's calling out amen isn't that so true and so beautiful amen to just to be a human is to have that little voice that little tug that little vibration on the inside saying i i'm crying out for god amen you know you might be you somebody might be here under the sound of my voice you know and uh under my ministry tonight and and and your life maybe is not really focused on god you're just in a condition of your life that where you know it's just not your top priority not that you're not a trying to be a good person and sincere and go to church but you know you've got a lot of other things going on in your life and maybe spiritually you're not where you're supposed to be amen and yet and yet when the word is being preached and when you when you come to church and and the people begin to worship and you come into that atmosphere and you're hearing the word and and the and ministers are casting the net and even though your life isn't where it's supposed to be maybe you're maybe you're not actively searching for god but you feel that little tug that familiar little that that little impulse on the inside what a beautiful thing that is amen what what a work of grace that god would put that down in your heart that little seed amen that little that little bit of potential that's crying out for a living god saying god i'm really not satisfied with just some religious death i'm really not satisfied to just lie here in this earth and and be like the rest of the earth but i know there's a life on the inside i don't fully understand it but it's but i feel it i feel it because i'm a human being and to be human is to yearn for god there's a light passion on the inside i can identify with the preaching of the wire because something on the very inside of me belongs to that that's me it's calling me it's pulling me it's drawing me that's beautiful friends amen amen that's that seed of god and we've found that there's a light in the message of the hour there's a light in this open word that can bring that little seed dancing and and bursting and shouting to life there there's a quickening power that that goes with this word this is not just a letter word but it's a spirit word it's a spirit message it brings an atmosphere it brings a light that we can bask under until that that little hunger for god that little something can grow and grow and grow into something great amen because it's a seed and a seed represents potential it represents potential you know like the lily brother brandon preached about some of his easter services and things that little lily you know that starts out it starts out as a seed and it's way down you know in the like our water lilies it'd be way down in the dirt somewhere in the mud and mire on the bottom of a of a pond you know some stagnant pond and and and you know that seed will lay down there in that earth and when you look at that seed and this would describe some of you where you've been in your life and where you started with the lord because when you look over that seed you could pass through you could dig through that dirt you wouldn't even you would probably miss it with all the petal pebbles and little twigs and things and mulch you wouldn't even be able to distinguish that seed from the rest of the earth around it but it's got a potential that the earth doesn't have it's got a potential the rest of the world doesn't have amen but and so you know that seed will lay there and lay there and lay there and it'll be nothing more than dirt maybe for years until until it comes into that right atmosphere it might be that one little sunbeam will just bounce down the granules of that dirt all the way down and somehow it finds its way down to you know deepest darkest lorraine ohio somewhere and just and it'll hit that little seed and you know and and that seed will just come into that atmosphere and it may not even understand what's happened to it all it knows is it just felt a real warm you know just something a real warm presence come over it you know it's not always you know it's not always when a seed gets quick and it's not always some explosive event it doesn't blow a crater you know it's not some great explosion many times but it's just a little it's just a little awakening a little something a little tug on the inside just a little like that but it begins to quicken and once it's quickened you'll never hold it back then amen all of a sudden everything changes all of a sudden it's not conden content to stay down there in the earth so it it starts to dig and push and it begins to fight against the dirt that's all around it and it doesn't even know which way's up or down you know it just but something in it makes it push and it pushes and shoves and fights and it's getting it's just dirty and you know it's it's it's filthy with with all that dirt down there on the bottom of that but it'll push and push and push and suddenly there's a breakthrough amen and it comes it breaks through into another realm amen why because there's a law on the inside that what that little human what start just that little desire amen grows into a fight it grows into a war pushing out and and fighting until it comes to a breakthrough but you know it'll have a breakthrough but suddenly it's under water it'll have a breakthrough but it finds itself underwater you know and as that begins to it begins to push and stretch and grow and we find that the currents will come through that water and it'll push that little seed this way and it'll push the little lily that way you know and back and forth and just tossed around by those waves and things and currents you know and all that pressure the water is pushing down on it and you know it but it can't hold that seed back you know because it just it's got to push there's a law in it it's gotta it's gotta it's gotta strive and and grow and stretch and push and and so something on the inside of it that same desire that quicken it amen causes it to fight through the mud causes it to break through causes it to swim against the current and suddenly it comes out and takes that first brush that first breath of fresh air you know comes out into the open sunshine and amen then it can come into blossom and it can just it could just give of its savior like brother branham said and you know it it becomes a beautiful thing but you know because it all started with that just that desire that that little common human potential down on the inside that crying out for a living god it's that same law of the seed in a christian life and it'll push out and it'll it'll come out there and just just just just stretch out on top of that water and come to its rest come to its maturity brother brown said that's the overcomer he overcame the mud he overcame the things of the world and now he freely gives himself out everyone can look at him his life you can't put a finger on it why he's a real overcomer you can't say anything about him now amen you say well he came out of the mud but he's not in the mud now glory he's on top of it you can't point at what he was what is he now he's on top he's on top what a beautiful picture of the overcomer of the potential of a seed amen but you know we find that the the the struggle for a lot of christians and the the real challenge for a lot of christians especially young people but i think we all go through a cycle of feeling this way amen uh that that that we're all at different stages of the lily you know in our life and and sometimes you got somebody who's really just they're in a battle in their life and they're really pushing through some things looking for a breakthrough something like that then you look over the pastor or or the elder in the church or somebody that you look up to or look at brother branham or the ministry or something you know and we're looking at other christian people and and it seems like their lives are so far beyond ours that it's just way out of reach you know because oh that's a real lily me i'm not so sure me i'm not so sure you know and that's the way that it is with christians we're all at those different stages you know you could preach this sermon in different places and you might preach to one that's still a seed and it's never been quickened and you look at their life and it's no different from the the the rest of the worldly people around them it's just indistinguishable from the dirt of this world and then you find that others they have a quickening they've had a quickening in their life some some kind of a just a a a a spiritual awakening and so but they're fighting you know they got a lot of filth and a lot of a lot of dirty things in their life that they're just fighting through and pushing through and you know they don't they don't maybe see god's plan because it's just a real early days of just pushing through that darkness not maybe not always knowing where you're going you know some people come to a breakthrough but then you know you might have had a breakthrough in your life but you came to church tonight and if you're honest with your with with uh with me tonight you'd say well brother nathan i just feel like i'm drowning i know that i've had experiences with god i know that i know there's been a growth of my life but right now i'm really under a lot of weight and i just feel like i'm drowning and i just feel like i'm just tossed to and fro and all the currents of laodicean life and all you know i'm just i'm just i'm just going with the flow sometimes i think maybe brother nathan i'll give up not just be a weed but you'll never be a weed because if the life on the inside is a lily the potential that's in you is to be a lily so you might give up and try to say well i'm just going to go with the flow i give up i'm just going to let it toss amen after a while you'll find that you won't be happy there amen like brother biscuit said one time you ever tried to throw in the towel and you couldn't find the towel but because there's just something in you that's different from everything around you but that's the stage of life you're in then you're looking at say oh you know but look at brother so and so he's he's on top you know and he he's just in full bloom and i can smell the fragrance of his life and so maybe he's a lillian but but i'm not hey man but here's what you got to realize when that little seed was laying there dead in the ground that was a lily when it was pushing its way through all that muck and mud it was still a lily when it broke through into that water and had to swim against the current and and and lay under the pressure of all the weight of that water that's still a lily amen and that one that's up there on top that you and i look to and we say wow they're just their life is so far beyond that one day they were where you were at amen they were down nailing laying in the earth unconverted but they were a lily and when they were pushing through the the the filthy things of this world in their life when they were battling some of these things that was they were a lily they were lily to swim against the current they were lily that pushed out they were lily hey man it's still a lily every stage of the journey but the great lie that satan puts on christian people is we get to comparing ourselves to one another which we should never do and we compare ourselves to one another and say well that brother he's on top of this and he's so far beyond me there but you're of the same substance you're still a lily you're not a different something you are a human being and they're a human being and the same god that brought them to the top can bring you amen amen because you know we just got to get real about it amen there are things in my life i'm not on top of sometimes and there's things in your life you're not on top of it either amen it's because we're all lilies we're all growing and pushing and striving and trying to come to a fuller blossom in our life amen but the great lie that satan tries to tell us is because you don't look like somebody that you're idolizing you're not that you're not a lily like that are but there's a lie there's no difference in what you are the difference is the stage of life that you're at but it's that same law of that seed same law of who you are same law of potential working amen so we so we find that we find our security not in comparing our life to one another not in comparing our religious works or our religious excellence or where we're at in the stages of christianity and where you're at in the cycle that's not what really we're looking at but we find rest in knowing amen that if you're that you're a human being and i'm a human being and there's places maybe you look to me and i look to you but we recognize that the same god that interceded for this humanity can intercede for your humanity same god that that was that was was real for elijah the same god that that brought him out will bring you out amen the same one that that will bring one to blossom will bring another amen by the same law because it doesn't have anything to do with the humanity it has to do with the seed glory be to god amen you think oh my you know uh like the scripture says we all walked according to the course of this world we all had our conversation with the lusts of our flesh we were all by nature the children of wrath well except for you brother bill you were never by nature the child of wrath brother richard you never had your conversation according to the nature of this world right you were just born a deacon no we find that a human being is a human being and as much as we're all different and your tastes and your personality and your characteristics are different from mine and there's great diversity in the kingdom of god but as much as there is all that when you get right down to the core of it a human being is a human being is a human being you say well brother nathan that that's pretty simple i i get that have you learned to draw comfort from that that's why i really want to that's what i really want to bring out tonight if the lord just helped me brother braham said the greatest enemy i've got is william branham this is really a an amazing statement actually he said the greatest enemy of god is william branham he's the one that gets in god's way he's the one that gets lazy wow he's the one who gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do it he can do something about it and when he does it shoves god right out of the picture that's pretty relatable actually amen but he says but when i can get rid of that guy when i can get to a place that he's out of the way then god can come over and do things that william branham knows nothing about that's when god can use you that's when he can use any of you he can use anybody when we get out of the way he can use anybody when we get out of the way this is a powerful thing for you and i realize friends because look at the guy that he's talking about has to get out of the way he's talking about william branham a man who was born a prophet he came into this world a prophet from birth he was called you know for a great calling he had a gift in his life he was born a prophet his life was foretold in malachi 4. amen he was a forerunner he was known of god he was his ministry was prophesied in the scripture this you know what he is to you and i but he had to be put aside so if william branham had to be put aside for god to be able to use him how much more are you and i gonna have to get out of the way and you know sometimes what getting out of the way means it means getting over yourself amen stop harboring so much on your insufficiencies and your frailties and oh i can't do it and god choose someone else he chose you because of those things amen that's the whole point of it really is that you and i do not possess within ourselves the power to be what god has called us to be but he can use anybody he can use anybody that will get out of the way and a majority of the problems in our christian life is because we won't get out of the way and we think that we know something about it and that we can just fix it all just right amen but he can use anybody when we get out of the way amen oh my you've got to get out of the way brother braham said you know people get in their head today you know like if god was would do anything he'd have to do it by an angel and send an angel down from heaven and let him do it he said god doesn't send angels man is god's servant he said and elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he was not an angel he was a man he was so human and he had the same ups and downs as you and i had that's what god uses amen we get to the place sometimes where you say god you know if you're going to do something in my life you're just going to have to send an angel from heaven and you know and give me a word of prophecy and you know and you're just going to have to do something supernatural lord because i can't do it i can't be what you want me to be you're gonna have to do more lord and just you know stay right in god's way with that attitude amen but when you can get out of the way say god i know that i'm nothing but i know you you're you're something you you can you can use nothing you can make you can make something out of nothing hey man i know that i'm weak but your strength is made perfect in weakness i know that i'm insufficient but your grace is sufficient for me amen it takes a change of attitude amen to realize that because we look at our humanity as a some great obstacle for god it's really a twisted form of pride when you think about it you say god you can't use me because my humanity is so powerful you know my weakness is such a big deal you don't even know god how big my problems are how weak i really am you're just gonna have to send an angel amen and see the way that we we get about it till we just we begin to lift up our humanity to the point where god can't use you but it comes to a place of acknowledging our your humanity and say god now you come in and use me anyway god you come in and and be my strength anyway god i'm i want to get out of the way i want to get over myself hey man i don't want to have this this twisted pride that would just magnify my failures to the point where i don't believe that you can you can be in me what you were in every other human being knowing that god well god just say that oh god you know you can't use me you can't you can't be real to me like you were to elijah you can't be real to me like you were to brother branham you can't be real to me like you are to pastor samuel god i know that that because of who i am and because uh but but was an elijah human being subject to like passions wasn't brother brandon a human being subject to like passions isn't the pastor a human being amen he is subject to like passions but see if god can do something in one human being he can do it through any human being through any human being but you've got to get out of the way amen to think that elijah here riverband said he was a man subject to pat like passions with the same ups and downs that's what really gets us you know it's great you know we're up one day and that's wonderful you know you're just ready to go out of church on sunday morning you're ready to fight every devil in hell and then monday you swing back down this way a little bit and all of a sudden it's all over you know but elijah had the ups and downs moses had the ups and downs brother branham had the ups and downs that's just being a human being but their lives are proving to us that in spite of ups and downs in spite of being human flesh in spite of like passions god can use a human being it's a really beautiful thing you know i know that it's simple but i think it's something we're all struggling with if we're really if we're really honest about it you know because here elijah you think of the story elijah and we know that elijah got frustrated we know that elijah got discouraged in his ministry and things he gets to the place he's dealing with so much rejection so much loneliness and things and gets to the place where that jezebel religions run them down into hiding somewhere and you know you know the picture oh god just take me and i'm not making fun of elijah i just relate to him a lot you know so dramatic oh god just take me that's it god i can't take anymore just take me you know you somebody else and i thought when i when i went and just uh refreshed myself on the scripture and studying this thought it actually really struck me his reasoning saying god just take me now my ministry's over everything you know everything's falling apart just take me because he says i'm no better than my father's that's that hit me that hit me so hard brother sister and because i i just pondered that from home and i thought well why would he be brother bill why would elijah be more than abraham was what did it what was it that made him think he would be more than isaac more than jacob more than the human beings that they were maybe elijah's looking at his own ministry and the message that he's carrying and he was under he was under a misconception because of the message that he was carrying he thought that he should be more than he was and then when he could be confronted with his humanity he just you know he gets real dramatic with god like we do sometimes he throws up his hand say god take me i'm no better than my father's and then and he wasn't he was the same humanity amen it's quite beautiful and then god comes down you know and brings a word of encouragement like i'm trying to bring you tonight and i thought it's quite powerful you know here he he takes his servant aside and you and i might have come now and said don't worry elijah listen you know i know things are tough right now next sunday you're going to go back and there's going to be 10 000 people in your church you know and all those kings everybody that rejected you you're going to get the last laugh and all those kings and emperors are going to start inviting you to their courts again to prophesy and things and and i'm going to take your ministry back to where it was and all this discouragement that you're dealing this is just a temporary setback i'm going to come down i'm just going to move it out of the way for you that's not the encouragement that elijah gets no the lord comes down and he says elijah here's what i got for you buddy you're not alone i've got 7 000 people that are in the same shape that you're in they're battling the same thing that you're battling they're going through the same thing that you're going through you're not the only one elijah i got 7 000 more just like you amen what a beautiful thing you know that's very real friends you know we find it around this message this message a lot of people around this message are dealing with great loneliness you know because uh it doesn't it's not something that draws the whole world uh many of us are sitting here have have parted ways with family you parted way with dear friends to stay with the word of god you know the pain of rejection you can identify with those things it's very real to us but look at our example look at brother branham who was a man of like passions you know he came to a place in his ministry where he got he got to you talk about rejection he knew what it felt like because here's a man you know i was listening to one of his sermons in sierra vista arizona and it just i i was like wow it's just struck me like never before now here's a man who who had a healing ministry that was famous around the globe i mean he prayed for kings and congressmen amen and dignitaries he was renowned he was world famous brother branham preached meetings talk about big crowds brother brown preached meetings where tens of thousands of people came to the lord in one service that's where he had been that's a that had been the heights of his ministry and now where do you find him you find him in the backside of the desert in sierra vista arizona in a house with a little handful of people maybe less than we have here tonight amen and it really looks pretty grim looks like his ministry is declining to the point where it's like why not just quit but that's not that's not the example our elijah sets us amen and i just i i when i think about i i just can't get over it how he's sitting there and he's got every right to feel discouraged and he is feeling discouraged he is feeling you don't think so go listen to the evening messenger go listen to these sermons around that time that where that pain of rejection here he's in a little house in sierra vista you could count the number of churches in the whole state of arizona that would have him preaching their church on one hand amen and here's a man who's feeling the pain of that rejection an evening messenger he's talking about you know when it looks like the message and the messenger is just about defeated he said don't worry that's when god steps in but here's a man who under the opening of the word amen he's not discouraged he's a real hero of the faith he's he's set in an example of a human being that can feel discouraged but not let it change his confession because he's sitting there in sierra vista arizona he's not preaching defeat he's preaching victory day he's preaching the victory of the believer in christ he goes to sierra vs again he preaches the message shalom says don't worry about the darkness the light has come hallelujah he's resting on that how many times you know brother bram shared that story and over and over about you know oh you know i preach what paul preached and that there was that whole group of people said brother we're resting on that i was one of those people i was in that vision i'm resting on this message i'm resting on this word but to think that elijah's resting on me resting on his message because it was a comfort to brother branham to thank you know he's preaching i think it was in the seals he stops in the middle he says look you aren't even understanding what i'm preaching he's looking at a whole congregation of people just like but he said there's coming of people who he said you're not getting it but there's someone coming who will get it amen amen and and here we are and brother ram's not even here to see it that we're here and we get it the holy spirit is revealing it the ministry has turned the corner into the opening of the word and these great revelations are being unlocked to the bride of jesus christ that was his rest to know that no brother brown you're not alone i've got seven thousand i've got a seventh age bride i've got oh i i i've got a people amen who are just like you they won't bow the knee to jezebel religion they won't bow the need to denominational spirits they'll never denominate they won't cut off god's revival they won't compromise on the word no they will believe they will rest their lives on what you preached sister of if brother branham and i know i'm a little jumbled up with this tonight just speaking from my heart if brother branham could take comfort in knowing that he wasn't alone in what he believed then surely there's some comfort in there for you and me to know that you're not the only one feeling the pain of rejection you're not the only one feeling lonely you're not the only one going through the struggles that you're going through to believe this message amen to battling against this laodicean world you're not alone i'm not alone thanks be to god but there are men and women of like passions amen that can identify with where we're at that's how brother branham was a man of like passions he's very clear about it you know a lot of people just are not comfortable with the humanity of the prophet they don't like you to bring it up they don't like you to dwell on it don't like you to point it out but to me it's the most beautiful thing about this message is to look at the humanity of elijah and what god could do through our elijah in spite of that humanity when he says you know and standing in the gap he says could you imagine a person getting so indifferent he could almost walk up watch a blind man walk off a cliff and laugh he said that'd be a bad thing but he says to my brethren world over i want to make this confession i humbly say that's just about what i was doing wow don't just take this as fa don't just you know don't just let this go in one ear and out the other this is a man of like passions revealing his humanity to you it's part of the message it's not a side note it's not a it's not an auxiliary thing it's it's it's fundamental to this message a man who said i had a lot of hard battles he said maybe i'm scarred and all cut up on the inside from fights you and i know what it's like to be scarred because my lot that the lord gave me wasn't to kiss babies and marry the young and bury the old but it was to hold that two-handed sword on the battle of the front brother bam said i've been cut deep many times that's not a that's not a superficial statement there's a reality behind that you've been cut and it's not an imaginary thing you're going through battles you've got struggles you've been in trials and they're not they're not imaginary they're real the things that you're going through tonight are real the struggles in your life are real they're real and yet you know he battles on he sets the example what a hero to feel those same things and yet persist and yet carry this message forward oh friends it gives us hope to think that man a man could go through what brother branham went through to have very dear friends turn their back on him to just feel that pain and rejection and discouragement and watch his ministry diminish down to just handfuls and keep going then it means i could keep going you could keep going we could keep believing this thing he continues on and just just showing his very heart here and this is where i really relate to these things he says you know and i being a nervous neurotic type of person that i am and knowing that i was insufficient at the beginning you mean brother branham felt insufficient the guy that spoke storms out of existence and things yeah he felt insufficient for the job he says as many have complained that had to do it he said it was hard but i thought god why didn't you call somebody that could have done it that's our elijah that's our prophet saying god why didn't you call somebody that could have done it amen so when you find yourself in that very condition with the lord say god you should have called somebody else this message is not for me i love it but i can't live it amen this is too much for me lord this time it's really too much i just can't bear this i can't handle this trial that i'm oh my brother branham himself feels this way amen and yet carries on to the end a man of like passions amen you know that's how we feel sometimes like we just we're not enough like we don't belong we get that impostor syndrome you know where you just feel like well you know i i could put on a good front i'll do my best to just make sure everybody thinks i got it all you know got everything figured out and then you know but eventually they're gonna discover eventually they're gonna figure me out that i'm a fraud that i'm an imposter that i'm not i'm not whatever you know i think i think everybody else in the church brother nathan you know i think they're real christian people and they really you know this message really for them and but i'm just doing my best and i'm really going through some things and i'm trying not to let anybody see it you know but eventually the cover's gonna i'm gonna blow my cover i'm just gonna mess up for the last time and everybody's gonna figure me out and then they'll finally kick me out of church but that's how we feel that's how we act sometimes that's how you know on the natural side of it i battled that really hard in school it's kind of where the lord showed me this lesson you know because you know you get to a certain place where things get a little hard all of a sudden and you're up against some challenges and things and you're looking around at everybody else and saying it doesn't seem like everyone else is struggling so maybe i'm not supposed to be here maybe this isn't for me maybe i'm not who i thought i was well you go along long enough you find out everyone else is feeling the exact same way and in fact millions of people like when it comes to school you know you might struggle a little bit struggle with some classes and think oh boy there's just no way it's not me then you get to thinking i got to think of one day you know they've been sending people to school for a long time that means probably millions and millions of people in this world have stood have been in the exact position that i'm in felt exactly like i'm feeling and graduated anyway so if they could do it then probably i could do it too because i'm because i'm just a normal human person amen and on the spiritual side that's exactly what it is is to realize that what you're going through amen is like what i've gone through and like what another one has gone through and the people that we idolize went through that same thing it's not something it's not some new alien experience it's not you know you're not some special test tube case you know like i'm the first one that's ever had this trial so now we'll really find out if god is really enough for this you know because this is a this is a real this is a real original one brother nathan it's not that we're not that original we're not that unique amen you're not that special amen but but but that's how we are as human beings we just we just say oh you know nobody understands nobody's ever been and nobody can really relate to what i'm going through really hey man really but it's that that's just that human nature just like jacob wrestled with who he was jacob felt like a fraud here he's wrestling and struggling with himself and you think of all that jacob had to wrestle with or all that jacob had to be discouraged about jacob was a fraud it wasn't just feeling like a fraud he was a fraud he came he was born under the name of a fraud amen and his whole life his whole his whole status with the lord was built on a lie because he was a hypocrite he it was all it was a deception when isaac's hands got crossed it was always supposed to imagine living with the knowledge it was always supposed to be esau and that's how we live as christians we say ah it should have been this one it should have been that one god you should have chose someone else amen because here i'm a jacob and i'm i'm dealing with this first nature and this this humanity that i'm carrying around and i just think i'm a fraud and here jacob he's wrestling with that just just wrestling with that so much not knowing that it was going to be written in the scripture jacob have i loved and esau have i hated amen that's the way it is for you and i brother sister god's hands didn't get crossed up when he chose you he knew exactly what he was doing amen it wasn't a deception why because you've had a name change you're not jacob anymore you're israel what was a fraud what was a deceiver now it's called bless now it's called royalty amen that's it's a whole new thing amen but we still wrestle with that humanity but you know you go along in life long enough to gain a little bit of perspective and i was sharing this with some young people recently you know how that uh how that you know i i'm old enough now to to have the the benefit of perspective where you know there were a lot of esau's that i grew up with you know just front row christians young people you know that looked like they were on fire for god and had everything put together and were living you know lives of religious excellence people that you looked at and said they'll never be a problem that you'll never have to worry about that one amen then you you go along in life a little bit and some of those esau's not here anymore some are out in the world some of them are atheists some of them just living lives as filthy as they could be but you thought they were an esau but then you talk about some jacobs some people you never would have held out hope for some people that you would have just written off people that had no advantage in their life no no reason to serve the lord nothing really to stand on no home life no good church no not under good ministry or whatever the situation was and now you look at their lives today they're the strongest ones in the church amen what is it jacob i loved esau have i hated it's what god can do in humanity doesn't matter the quality of the humanity but it's his deity amen can overcome the humanity his choosing his election his grace the law of the seed is able to overcome these things friends so we wrestle and wrestle but eventually you've got to stop wrestling just let the lord touch your life and it changes your walk changes your confession changes your attitude the way that you talk about yourself amen god didn't get crossed up when he chose you he knew exactly what he was doing he's going to take you and multiply you like jacob like israel he'll multiply you he'll use you to fulfill his promise he'll do things in your life you didn't even know were possible some of you lived a full life you're in your late middle age or or an elderly person there could be things just around the corner in your life potentials that are in you that have not been unlocked and you just be amazed what god can do with you with just a more greater surrender more of our humanity laid down it's never over it's never it's it never stops it's a god that just multiplies and multiplies and uses his people uses human beings brother brahm said we know we make mistakes but you mustn't look at that this is one of my favorite this is my life quote really you mustn't look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them i don't know about you but when i read that quote a little something just goes it's not compromise it's grace knowing that you'll always have mistakes because your idea i know your idea is the same as my idea and our religiousness that you know we got to come to a place where we live such great super spiritual lives until it's been 20 years since the last time you messed up you haven't made a mistake you can't remember the last time you made a mistake no brother brown said you're always going to have them amen another thing i've shared with the young people you know is that you know there is a balance between law and grace because some people go so far out on grace they turn it into a disgrace we know that there has to be a life you know behind the name there there's got to be a you know if you're a seed it'll manifest itself with a christian life and christian character we know all those things so we know there's a balance between law and grace but i'll tell you this and i know that i've preached you here before amen if you want to find that balance you've got to start with grace because if you don't start with grace you'll never achieve the balance amen you've got to start with grace amen that's what this quote is telling you it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them stumbling and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real servant if he stumbles he gets back up if he wobbles god pulls him right back in the path he said god's obligated to him and here's the beautiful words knowing that he's just a man or a woman amen amen that's what we're preaching tonight he knows you're just a man or a woman he understands those like passions but he's obligated to that person as long as they're in the path of duty what a beautiful quote so that's why if you stumble don't get out in the ditch you know and throw yourself a pity party and say well god you should have chose somebody else it was never for me anyway no you get back up and you stay in the path of duty stay in the path of duty a lot of times you know the real devil that gets you down you know the devil trip you up on temper or on lust or on some something you know he'll come in your life and and that that devil will trip you up for a moment but then condemnation moves in and condemnation don't get in a hurry condemnation will stay there for a week or a month or until you kick it out condemnation nation will come on the heel that mistake and condemnation is the real one that will put his foot on your neck and grind you into the dirt and amen and just keep you there where that failure happened but you don't have to stay under condemnation you don't have to carry it not for one step past a genuine repentance but godly sorrow brings you to a repentance and repentance takes you to salvation not to be repented of not to be sorry anymore but to get back up in the path of duty and keep walking and god's obligated to you in that path because he knows you're just a man or a woman so a man or a woman that'll keep going with god in spite of their humanity in spite of their mistakes and knowing that stumbling falling don't have one thing to do with it god is obligated to that person god's not obligated to a person who can climb up to some spiritual super state of existence where they're living a life of sinless perfection what a lie that that image is but it's someone who will walk in grace who will take the blood that was shed for them who will walk out under the under under the forgiveness of sins under the under the justification of the bride will identify themselves with christ and stay in that path of duty duty will take you where your emotions fail amen there's places in your life you know the emotions not there the real zeal the real passion just that human passion fails you maybe tonight you know you had such a rough day at work you didn't even feel like going to church but you stayed in the path of duty and duty took you to church even when your attitude was rotten and god's obligated to you there that's why he's speaking to you tonight amen oh my amen stumbling and falling don't have one thing to do with it you say brother nathan i got failures i do too so let's fail forward fail forward just keep going because we've got a future we've got a future you know we think of that many times we just we just look in the past you take peter you know when we look at peter we read the book of first peter ii peter we see that beautiful picture of a pastor of the church an elder a leader a bishop you know and this great just this loving man this gentle soul talking about love and character and you know the stature of a perfect man all those things and and you know and here's peter you know he was he was had so much power in his life that he would walk down the street and his shadow would cast over people and people would be healed just by just by coming into contact with his shadow you say oh wow that's a real that's a real christian life but what about back when he was in a boat somewhere cussing and and and and being irreverent with a temper what about when he was cutting an ear off and what about all the times jesus had to shake his head and say oh peter you know what about what about all the what about in the back room where he just couldn't quite see peter uh paul he just didn't quite have paul figured out and they were having a real you know moment of intense fellowship in a back room somewhere in jerusalem what about all those times of his life you can't just look at peter at the very end when he's come to the capstone of his ministry and say oh that's a real christian but but but what about the god that took peter from the boat amen to the pulpit what about all that in between what about all that human life friends you can't throw peter out based on his mistakes because he had a future and i'm telling you you've got a future so don't throw this humanity out don't throw these because of these like passions don't just give up and say god it must not be for me no it's the same god that was with them is with you is with me keep waiting for that key amen keep waiting for the key you know wherever you're at in your life there's men and women men and women of god that are living overcoming lives today and they know exactly where you're at exactly where you're at they've been exactly where you're at friends amen you think preachers don't struggle with things oh you know preachers but preachers don't have fear preachers don't worry you know preachers don't have anxiety and complexes and things like that yeah i wish you know we named our we named our little girl her middle name is juniper there's a reason for that because we all get under that juniper tree and we all get a little dramatic with the lord and we all get to place we say god just just take me this is too much amen you know there are people that can understand people that have been there you look at somebody whose life you're intimidated by you know as a young christian we get intimidated by christians because they're living a life that feels so far beyond where we're at but if you just you ever work up the courage say brother i'm dealing with this sister i'm dealing with this would you pray for me you'll find out they got something in their past they'll they've been right where you're at you talk about oh you say well you know but but but but i got this thing in my past you know and you know other people you know i've been through some really rough things that most people most people don't understand they can't relate to they've never been there you know and i just i'm carrying all this baggage from my past and you think brother branham didn't understand that you know brother brandon back in the 19 it was the 1930s i think he made a very horrible mistake he instead of listening to what the lord was directly leading him to do he listened to his mother-in-law right and he paid a horrible price he had to he had to sit there in a hospital and watch his wife pass away watch his little baby with those little baby eyes crossing with the pain that she was suffering before the lord took her that was a horrible thing a horrible price that he paid that happened back in the 1930s brother branham was still bringing it up in the 60s brother ray was just preaching on this recently it just struck me so much here brother brown you think it didn't bother him you think he didn't keep him up late at night many times and you know he this is a man who understands what it is to to have something in your past and you feel like you just can't get over it you're not alone in that brother branham knew what that was he knew what it was to struggle with the he knew what it was you know close his eyes probably and see his little baby's face because of his mistake it's a man who could understand that but you know what from that day every little cross-eyed baby brother brandon prayed for was made whole you see the power of like passions we think that god can only magnify our successes and god can only multiply our victories but god can take your mistakes he can take your your failures he could take the moments where you were too low where you failed the lord god can take that and turn it around into a victory that's the kind of god i serve that's the grace of god that's where the fervent prayer of a righteous man comes from because when a righteous man kneels down to pray for a brother he can relate to what that brother's going through because it's a because it's a man that's been through some things and that that becomes the fervency behind the effectual prayer that's why we still believe in prayer lines that's why we call one and up we call one another up and and pray for one another and we don't just call every we don't just call up to heaven for everything we have need of we pray for one another why because you can get in that channel of compassion yeah amen and you say oh that brother's gotta he's got back problems and i've been through some real back problems that brother's going through a family situation i've been through a real familiar situation so i can feel for that brother and god can work through things the places where you messed up the places where you failed god those places that you thought you thought god how could you ever make something beautiful out of this god can he can make all things beautiful in his time he can turn it around and he can use that to give you a burden for someone else and he can do great works of deliverance through through your baggage to york because he knows how to use human beings he's no stranger to like passions no stranger to humanity he's an expert in taking flawed humanity and doing supernatural things taking our natural you know just our natural demeanor and doing the supernatural that's what god specializes in glory be to god that's how brother branham operated how many times do you know like when the blind man came to him in mexico you know and he stood there and he didn't just you know he didn't just act pentecostal and jump off the platform and slap him on the forehead and start screaming no he stands there he begins a fellowship with the humanity of this blind man he begins to say oh you know he must be going through some cold nights i wonder if my jacket would fit him because i know that he's poor and his and he's and he's he's he's spending nights in the cold oh you know his feet he must be walking everywhere that he goes he must be in he must have pain he must he must be suffering i wonder if my shoes would fit him see how brother brahms slows down and just takes the time to enter in by compassion enter into those like passions that fellow human experience that that that that similar humanity he begins to open up a channel there brother braham says where divine love where divine love is extended sovereign grace comes in you know that you you know the teaching that's how he would operate he'd take somebody in the prayer line you know he wouldn't just pray for them sometimes but the holy spirit would take him all the way back say you know when you were a little girl you were in a car accident now you've got this nervous condition but it goes all the way back to that trauma that you have in your past god understands your trauma and a brother or sister you know that you can open up to and they can understand you that that same compassion can begin to build god can do the supernatural through that the fervent effectual prayer of a righteous man the beauty of it is it's it's a man of like passions it's another human being they're proud they got problems just like you got problems they've got a history they've got a pass just like you've got to pass they've got baggage they've got trauma just like you've got trauma and yet this mighty god can take take this flawed humanity amen and open up that channel of compassion and do the supernatural in one another's life i think it's beautiful friends i i i apologize if it's just too simple tonight but to me it's such a beautiful thing to be a brother a sister to be a man or a woman of like passions to to be a human being living under heaven and live in this experience that we're living as sons and daughters of god having compassion one for another understanding one another relating to one another you know if we would operate in that channel of understanding more often we wouldn't see church splits we wouldn't see drama we wouldn't see all the problems that we've seen if people would stop and say well that brother you know what is it that makes him that way that sister you know that's given me a hard time what is it back in her past that caused it to be like this brother brandon i was just listening to quote earlier today in the great commission he says you know if you want to be a blessing and and get a blessing he said when a man's done you wrong he's a in other words like not a not a misunderstanding or something as somebody actually just did you wrong he did you evil he said don't you mention that he said you take that brother to the throne of god her sister he said you stand shoulder to shoulder with them in the presence of god and say god you know here my brother's done me wrong he's absolutely done me wrong and he said but you begin to you begin just pray for that person and he said god will let you see what he's been through and he said you know and before long you'll start feeling sorry for that man and he said when you get down to earth again oh my you'll just stand shoulder to shoulder he said there's no mortal can stand in the presence of god and condemn another mortal amen if you really know what it is to carry these human these the the weights of this humanity when you've been through the struggles of a human being trying to live for god friends how could we come into the presence of god and condemn someone else who's going through the same experience but but god is a god who can let us understand one another and could fix all the problems can just cover over all the love can cover a multitude of sins if oh my when we just wake up to the fact that we're all men and women of like passions just normal flesh and blood beautiful amen the fervent prayer comes from that he knows you're just a man or a woman he knows you're just a man or a woman could i have a few more minutes you know when he called philip you know brother brahms talking about he said behold an israelite whom there's no guile he said that's the way that god is he knows you he knows what you are he knows what you're made out of he understands you hallelujah hallelujah he understands you in the patmos vision he's talking about you know there in revelation 10 you know that that white wigged one with the flaming eyes of judgment you know he's talking about this great judge this great you know uh uh what the revival should call it you know the angry god like sinners in the hands of an angry god god the judge god who who who brings you know a judgment god who who who brings the final verdict over humanity you know this the judge but he said i want you to notice something about those eyes those flaming eyes he says when he was on earth they were dim with tears like a man those eyes that we see flaming in judgment but those eyes were once on earth they were deemed with tears like a man before he cried at the grave of lazarus he's full of sympathy he was god clothed in humanity but behind that humanity brother brahm said he had something behind him that could look right down into the heart of a man and know all about him friends it's not eyes of judgment burning over you it's a god who not only loves but he understands he understands he's the sympathizing jesus he knows where you are why because he chose to pitch his tent with us and be a human being jesus is a man of like passions jesus felt the pain of hunger brother braham said he he couldn't suffer in spirit he had to become flesh to feel the pain of sickness to feel the temptation of lust he felt the temptation of want the temptation of hunger and he felt the power of death and he said and jesus took that to make intercession for us for he knows how it feels a kinsmen redeemer who knows how it feels he said when you get sick he knows how you feel when you're tempted he knows how you feel he knows how you feel to think you know this is something that you know growing up at church didn't teach me this was never revealed to me till later in life you know it just it just still just opened up to me one day that that man that walked up calvary's hill you know that jesus that took that cross you know and felt that pain felt the crack of that whip that was beaten was bloodied you know what those bloody feet just stumbling up that hill under that great weight finding out knowing understanding what it is to carry a burden be weighed down that one who would see people who were his precious friends dear friends would turn their eyes and pretend they didn't know him or even spit in his face understand he understands rejection he understands pain understands the burden he understands it and that god you know that carried that cross up that hill that wasn't god came and made a little puppet out of flesh and walked it up calvary's hill and hung it on a tree that was god who became flesh so god felt the crack of the whip god felt the blood running down his brow god felt the weight of the cross god felt the pain of rejection god cried out said why why why is this happening to me it's a god that understands god that understands amen a man a human being just like you and i man of like passions what a beautiful thing what a beautiful thing and brother braham says notice he said when you're discouraged that's when the devil can really pour it on you but when you can cast that aside he said god doesn't want you to be frowning god wants you to be happy the human heart was made to be happy why because god made that human heart he knows what it is to be sad he doesn't want you to be sad he doesn't want you to be under your christian life to be a great burden he doesn't want you to be weighed down with all these things it's a god that understands he said you come unto me my burdens light my yoke is easy i'll give you rest amen only a god who understands could offer that to you whatever you're going through whatever issues in your life that you came to church with tonight wherever you're at whatever you're dealing with whatever your struggle jesus knows all about your troubles jesus knows how beautiful amen let's all stand tonight amen amen you're not alone you're not alone let's sing that song jesus knows all about our troubles
