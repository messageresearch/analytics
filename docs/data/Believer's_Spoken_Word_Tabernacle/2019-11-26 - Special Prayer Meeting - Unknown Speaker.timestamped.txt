[0:00] the hand of God that was upon the nation
[0:04] and how that God had established that
[0:06] they they were completely focused upon
[0:08] that when the whole Proclamation was
[0:11] signed and put in place by George
[0:12] Washington but I look at this scripture
[0:15] here and and I my you know my heart just
[0:19] drawn to it and we many times will refer
[0:22] to it of how that there was only one who
[0:24] turned to give things but within the
[0:26] Scriptures it speaks of how that they as
[0:29] lepers they were standing afar off they
[0:31] were not even worthy to be in the place
[0:34] of where Jesus was they couldn't even
[0:37] come into that village because Leppert
[0:39] leprosy itself was a spiritual condition
[0:41] or it was actually it's a physical
[0:43] condition when it's in it and it deals
[0:45] with a lack of a proper diet but we
[0:48] understand that leprosy when we also
[0:50] look at it it's a spiritual condition
[0:52] there is nothing and nothing that could
[0:55] actually turn that around when leprosy
[0:57] hit in that was that was the curse there
[0:59] was nothing turning that around except
[1:01] God and so here they are standing out
[1:05] that was just like you and I there is no
[1:07] way that we could ever bring ourselves
[1:10] into the economy of God but God took
[1:13] notice of us and there was that part of
[1:16] himself that moved within our hearts to
[1:19] recognize him think of this when he
[1:21] walks in they say Jesus have mercy on us
[1:25] they didn't ask for his justice they
[1:28] asked for his mercy because anything
[1:31] that has come our way it's because of
[1:33] the mercy of God every healing every
[1:36] deliverance every prayer the baptism of
[1:39] the Holy Ghost there are eyes being open
[1:41] it is the mercy of God that has come our
[1:44] way
[1:44] and so when we we look at it when Jesus
[1:47] he says to them he says go show
[1:50] yourselves under the priest I want you
[1:51] to look at this he never he never even
[1:54] said or laid his hands on them and said
[1:57] you're well but he said go show
[2:00] yourselves to the priest now that was an
[2:03] act in that cleansing ceremony that
[2:06] where they were to go and and and and
[2:08] let the priest pronounce them clean you
[2:11] see what had happened though
[2:12] word had already been spoken and the
[2:15] word itself packs the power to bring the
[2:18] cleansing to that life it held the
[2:20] authority to take where cells themselves
[2:23] were in such a rotten in of vile
[2:25] condition but the word would bring order
[2:28] to that life the war the word would
[2:31] actually reverse the course of death and
[2:34] leprosy in that life and turn it around
[2:36] he never he never even said you be thou
[2:39] whole he said go show yourselves to the
[2:42] priests because the word itself as the
[2:44] Bible said God sent His Word to heal his
[2:47] people so it is the Word of God that is
[2:51] just like you know when brother Branham
[2:52] would tell us in power transformation
[2:53] and I believe it's very much a key even
[2:56] for the hour we're living in brother
[2:58] Graham would talk about he said
[2:59] sometimes even the person or the vessel
[3:02] he said maybe that has preached that
[3:04] word or delivered that word he said it
[3:06] was never that vessel that transforms
[3:08] you it is the word he said see it even
[3:11] shows even in that situation it is the
[3:14] word that does the transformation it's
[3:16] not the man who does the preaching it is
[3:18] the word that does the transformation so
[3:21] we know it all brings our confidence
[3:23] back in the word and I'm grateful for
[3:26] that aren't you he says go show
[3:27] yourselves under the priest and it shall
[3:29] come to pass it came to pass that as
[3:31] they went they were cleansed they had
[3:35] they had to obey the word their hearts
[3:38] just immediately when it was spoken by
[3:40] the way they went and in their obedience
[3:42] the simple obedience just to accept what
[3:45] was already said it's finished they were
[3:49] cleansed has they obeyed from their
[3:52] heart they were cleansed as they went on
[3:53] their way and the Bible says that man
[3:56] one of them verse 15 and one of them
[3:59] when he saw that he was healed he took
[4:04] not he just didn't know the rest of them
[4:07] knew they were cleansed but he took
[4:09] knowledge of the healing in his body and
[4:12] it was something about it that was more
[4:14] than the rest or the other nine the
[4:16] other nine it wasn't that you know they
[4:18] weren't glad about it but for him he
[4:21] took knowledge of the
[4:22] and the greatness of what it take place
[4:25] in his life you know how it is sometimes
[4:26] you know and maybe a person can just
[4:29] come and they you know when things start
[4:31] going bad in their life oh they want
[4:33] Jesus but but after things start going
[4:35] good then they forget about Jesus they
[4:37] they um they you know they'll come to
[4:39] church when things are going bad or
[4:40] having a but we're having a hard time
[4:42] where it's a good place to come but it
[4:44] ain't only the time you come when you're
[4:45] having a hard time you you come here in
[4:47] the times when you're on top of the
[4:49] mountain you come here in the times when
[4:51] you're in the valley in the lowest
[4:53] Valley but in it all we recognize in our
[4:56] life it is Jesus Christ that has brought
[4:59] healing to our lives if it wasn't for
[5:02] him we would still be without the camp
[5:05] but because of the blood of Jesus Christ
[5:07] it has already been shed for us and the
[5:10] Holy Spirit went to us and said you can
[5:13] come in now you are brought in there is
[5:16] a cleansing that is went for you to
[5:18] change the course of what was leprosy in
[5:21] your soul now we are pronounced clean by
[5:24] the blood of the Lamb oh I'm so glad
[5:26] about that I told you I'm just gonna
[5:27] just just pick just a few moments but I
[5:30] don't want to get too wound up here on
[5:31] this but it's so hard on any part of the
[5:33] Word of God not to get wound up you know
[5:36] in the good the Lord the word of the
[5:38] Lord is so good it's so rich because
[5:40] this is this is about me this about you
[5:43] a man if not for the grace of God we
[5:46] were only looking into the village we
[5:49] didn't even as Gentiles we didn't even
[5:51] have the promises of the covenants and
[5:53] of the adoption we were on the outside
[5:56] looking in but here he said here when we
[5:59] came when he came there's something
[6:01] about it in us like the woman who had
[6:04] the issue of blood it was just like than
[6:06] when they if I can just touch the hem of
[6:07] His garment I shall be made whole it was
[6:10] just like the one that you know could
[6:12] could look at there and say that son of
[6:15] David you know have mercy on me blind
[6:17] bartimaeus caught who he was and it
[6:19] released to him the reality of who he
[6:22] was and the effect upon his life his
[6:25] eyes were healed and to think about the
[6:28] woman who you know had the daughter at
[6:30] home she you know here she approached
[6:32] she was agreed she said thou son of
[6:34] David and Jesus said to her he said it
[6:37] is not meet to take the the bread and
[6:40] give it unto dogs see at present
[6:43] remember when Jesus came as the Messiah
[6:45] it was not unto the Gentiles at that
[6:48] time it was coming the Bible says he
[6:50] came to confirm the promises that were
[6:53] made unto the circumcision but when he
[6:55] came they rejected him but think of this
[6:59] woman does not even meet for him to take
[7:01] the bread intact cast it to dogs but
[7:03] what did she do she said but Lord does
[7:09] not the dogs eat the crumbs that fall
[7:12] from the master's table Jesus put it out
[7:15] here and dogs and she even got Lord she
[7:19] submitted herself to the word and you
[7:21] know brother Ram was taken he said now
[7:23] how many of you in here tonight
[7:24] he said you you would you take a crumb
[7:27] he said or do you have to have a slice
[7:29] he said but if you can take a crumb ease
[7:32] and Jesus is after crumb seekers because
[7:34] you can take a crumb he said you've got
[7:37] everything that's in the whole loaf and
[7:39] you know brother promise will come to
[7:41] pass amen
[7:43] oh my to humble ourselves to the word
[7:45] you know to think of this Jesus he never
[7:48] when he looked at their condition they
[7:50] were in leprosy but Jesus was able to
[7:53] who had Mabel to move and call them into
[7:56] where they needed to be look at this he
[7:58] says when they and one fell down the one
[8:01] of them when he saw that he was healed
[8:03] he turned back and with a loud voice
[8:06] glorified God he didn't send Jesus a
[8:11] text he didn't send Jesus a tweet he
[8:14] didn't even send Jesus a thumbs up I
[8:17] like it on Facebook he let it be known
[8:19] with the loud voice he glorified God
[8:22] because he knew there is no one that
[8:26] could do this but Almighty God he was
[8:29] confident that God was in Christ that's
[8:33] how it is in this generation
[8:36] it's confident that God has made himself
[8:38] real through his word of promise in this
[8:41] generation like brother Paul was singing
[8:43] I wanna
[8:44] thank you for letting me see this last
[8:46] day mystery and to know that my name is
[8:50] on the book they meant the seals they
[8:53] have been revealed and and my name is
[8:55] found there it's to reveal you are
[8:58] always with me your name your life was
[9:02] always secure you know it behooves us to
[9:05] look at that and to consider look he
[9:08] looked at his healing and he realized
[9:10] hey this is tremendous what God has done
[9:14] and he returned back to glorify God oh
[9:18] my
[9:19] I believe I'm talking to people tonight
[9:21] that do that I believe I'm talking to
[9:23] people and I flew like me and like this
[9:26] were lepers but the grace of God were
[9:29] spoke to our hearts and we can see in
[9:31] our life I once was a leper but I've
[9:34] been healed amen
[9:36] I watched what's without the camp but
[9:39] now through him by the blood of Jesus
[9:41] I've been brought nigh
[9:42] amen and when he saw that he was healed
[9:45] he turned back and and with a loud voice
[9:47] glorified God and fell down on his face
[9:53] at his feet giving him things I think
[10:00] that's tremendous he just didn't he gave
[10:02] him things it was you know and a giving
[10:04] of things there's times we say thank you
[10:06] there stand and sometimes I I think we
[10:08] all can agree thank you so many times
[10:12] when we when it comes to speaking
[10:14] expressing it to the Lord you don't even
[10:16] feel like that that's that's enough
[10:18] words sometimes I said Lord forgive me
[10:20] but all I can say it only thing I got
[10:22] vocabulary is thank you but from my
[10:24] heart you you you know what my heart is
[10:26] saying I'm so grateful for your grace
[10:29] Lord and for your mercy Lord for what
[10:31] you've done he fell on his face at his
[10:33] feet giving him things and I like this
[10:36] and he was in verse 16 a Samaritan
[10:42] you see sometimes it's necessary to know
[10:46] the background we know not everybody the
[10:51] people don't have to know our background
[10:53] but it's important this would be
[10:55] included that this was a Samaritan this
[10:58] is one who was looked down on then was
[11:01] looked as an outcast
[11:02] it was everything but Jesus let it be
[11:05] known he was a Samaritan he returned and
[11:08] gave things he wasn't somebody born with
[11:13] a silver spoon in his mouth as Gentiles
[11:16] we were not born with a silver spoon in
[11:17] our mouth we did not know anything about
[11:20] the covenants but God knew about us
[11:23] mm-hmm and Jesus said were there not ten
[11:27] cleansed but where are the nine there
[11:31] are not found that returned to give
[11:33] glory to God save this stranger and he
[11:38] said unto Him arise go thy way thy faith
[11:41] hath made thee whole there's just so
[11:44] many so many wonderful things within the
[11:46] Word of God that it deals with in our
[11:49] lives of giving things and so many
[11:52] things that was we find in God's Word
[11:54] and I'm not going to I'm not going to
[11:56] read it but it's just so many things
[11:58] that are even right here before me of
[11:59] where God admonishes us through Apostle
[12:04] Paul and and and different ones to give
[12:07] things David would write about even his
[12:09] expression and giving thanks unto the
[12:11] Lord because in every part of our life
[12:14] even in being able to wake up in your
[12:16] right mind we ought to say thank you
[12:18] Lord you you here and you've walked
[12:21] through another day in Satan's Eden
[12:24] thank you lord
[12:25] his grace has kept you he's given you
[12:29] strength when when when you felt that
[12:31] you were at the lowest yet he come and
[12:33] encouraged you thank you Lord he's
[12:36] provided when we didn't know which way
[12:38] to turn thank you Lord in all of these
[12:41] things of how that God's still moving
[12:43] word and transforming lives thank your
[12:46] Lord how that God has come in the midst
[12:49] of the test and of the trial it not to
[12:52] remove the tester trial but just to let
[12:54] us know hey what I said in the beginning
[12:57] then I'll never leave you no forsake you
[12:59] I am with you even to the end of the age
[13:02] I'm in it I'm here I've always been here
[13:06] whether you felt it or not I'm here with
[13:09] you thank you Lord amen
[13:13] growl repeat Oh God thank you Lord Jesus
[13:15] I'm glad that he's with me
[13:18] aren't you glad he's with you even when
[13:20] I don't feel him even when the
[13:22] circumstances are not circumstances then
[13:25] I feel like shouting but he's still with
[13:28] me over and over I tell you I got a
[13:31] little beside myself when I we were over
[13:33] there and right before administered it
[13:35] brother Jim Shumate sit on that net
[13:37] that's Sunday night and the Lord just
[13:39] began to turn my direction back in the
[13:41] office on that Sunday evening and I
[13:43] started to preach on on Joseph in and
[13:45] dealing with some of the some of those
[13:47] parts within Joseph and tests and trials
[13:49] and and you know how God just put all
[13:51] that together and I begin to look at
[13:53] things in the scripture and you find
[13:55] over and over in the scripture the Bible
[13:57] says the Lord when he went into prison
[13:59] the Bible says the Lord was with him
[14:01] when he went into the lowest dungeon the
[14:04] Bible says the Lord was with him I don't
[14:07] believe those things are just mentioned
[14:10] neither does God want us just to well
[14:12] you know you just you just you just know
[14:14] that just that's a given God had that
[14:16] wrote in the book of Genesis chapter 39
[14:18] for Samuel Browning for 2019
[14:21] he had it wrote there so that I could
[14:23] look at it that even no matter what
[14:25] situation is to know that he said in his
[14:28] word I'll never leave you nor forsake
[14:30] you when you're even in a situation that
[14:32] doesn't look pleasant it doesn't look
[14:34] good you don't feel like shopping but I
[14:36] am with you you let us know I'm with you
[14:40] aren't you glad about that thank you
[14:43] lord thank you lord

[15:08] faithfulness his mercy once again amen

[15:19] testimonies and I know there may be some
[15:21] songs to be sung and then I want to read

[23:34] need the same
[23:37] and I say that because there's many we
[23:40] could we in our own looking at things
[23:43] sometimes we could look at things in
[23:45] differences and say well this need well
[23:48] this isn't maybe as high as this need
[23:49] but I'm glad that Jesus looks at all
[23:52] these needs and it moves through our
[23:53] heart the same way in every mean it's on
[23:57] a person's heart has special meaning and
[24:01] I'm glad that the Lord Jesus when we
[24:04] bring a need to him he doesn't say but
[24:11] I'm glad he expresses himself same for

[50:46] many testimonies there
[51:00] Thanks so about I forget I think it was
[51:05] the last prayer meeting that we had I
[51:09] brought it before the church just to
[51:12] keep me in prayer it was about two weeks
[51:14] before the wedding that I started having
[51:18] these dizzy spells and any fast kind of
[51:24] head movement I'd get dizzy I bend down
[51:28] to pick something up and I'll get dizzy
[51:30] I mean just even going down the stairs
[51:32] at work I'm looking where I'm going and
[51:36] then the minute I pick up I head to open
[51:38] the door it kind of gets black in front
[51:41] of me and I grab ahold of something but
[51:44] the worst part of it is when I go to bed
[51:47] at night and I turn from one side to the
[51:49] next
[51:50] that's when it feels like I'm gonna on a
[51:53] rollercoaster ride like I get real real
[51:55] dizzy and it just disturbed my sleep and
[51:58] I was really uncomfortable and I
[52:03] mentioned that at work people at work
[52:06] say that yeah it's vertigo and they know
[52:09] people that go through the similar thing
[52:12] and they have to get a checked out and I
[52:16] just got really scared and I and I knew
[52:18] that I was praying and I claimed my
[52:20] healing but I I was I was so fearful at
[52:23] the same time and I know that faith
[52:26] moves mountains but fear brings that
[52:29] mountain back and I knew that I needed
[52:32] help from the believers I needed someone
[52:37] to stand with me and believe with me and
[52:40] I came and I I mentioned it before the
[52:43] church we prayed and that night I went
[52:47] home and there was no disease spells
[52:49] then I went to bed and I moved from one
[52:52] side to the next
[52:53] it didn't feel like I was on a roller
[52:54] coaster ride no more and I got up the
[52:57] next morning and I praise God and I
[52:59] worshiped him and I sang at work and I
[53:02] was so happy and then just like you know
