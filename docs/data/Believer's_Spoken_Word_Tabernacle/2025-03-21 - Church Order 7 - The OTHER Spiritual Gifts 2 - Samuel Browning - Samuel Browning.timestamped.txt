[28:24] drove up here and got in time you know
[28:26] for for service so I I really really
[28:28] appreciate that as well and um so it
[28:31] just kind of saves me a trip so I don't
[28:32] have to sit behind the
[28:34] board but anyhow it's good to be
[28:36] together isn't it amen and I know you're
[28:39] saying hurry up come on I'm ready to sit
[28:40] down it's Thursday it's Thursday come on
[28:43] 1 Corinthians 12 and verse one Paul said
[28:46] now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren
[28:49] I would not have you ignorant I love
[28:51] that I'm glad God wouldn't have us to be
[28:54] ignorant aren't you you know that you
[28:57] were Gentile and carried away unto these
[29:00] dumb Idols even as you were LED
[29:03] wherefore I give you to understand that
[29:05] no man speaking by the spirit of God
[29:08] calleth Jesus a curse and that no man
[29:12] can say that Jesus is the Lord but by
[29:16] the Holy Ghost and then verse four and
[29:19] we went through these last week there
[29:20] are diversities of gifts but the Same
[29:23] Spirit there are div differences of
[29:26] administrations but the same lord and
[29:29] there are diversities of operations but
[29:32] it's the same God which worketh all in
[29:34] all but the manifestation of the spirit
[29:38] is given to every man to profit with all
[29:41] or to profit all may God bless you bless
[29:45] the reading of the word bless the
[29:48] service to our hearts and you know
[29:50] brother brandham would um he when having
[29:54] a meeting
[29:55] with uh the Brethren and he did that at
[29:58] different
[29:59] times um with uh taking sides with Jesus
[30:02] is one of those meetings that he had
[30:04] with the Brethren brother Bram was
[30:07] really disclosing his heart in that
[30:09] service and um there's things that
[30:11] brother Bram is saying in there in that
[30:13] message taking sides with Jesus that so
[30:16] much pertains to the family so much
[30:18] pertains to the local body and um he is
[30:22] speaking of how he's just come out of uh
[30:25] ministering on the restoration of the
[30:27] brid how how many of you remember that
[30:29] message and brother Bram is speaking of
[30:31] that of how that there had been such an
[30:33] in-depth study that had been done uh by
[30:37] himself and he had studied how the early
[30:39] church and just watched how they were
[30:41] and that's where brother Bram was able
[30:43] to draw from that out of the book of
[30:45] Acts because you know the book of Acts
[30:47] is 28 chapters but it doesn't mean that
[30:50] was 28 days you know many times when we
[30:53] talk about writing writing a book of
[30:54] Acts you realize that if you ever have
[30:57] uh in any time in your devotions uh
[31:00] sometimes I've switched back and forth
[31:01] from year to year sometimes I've done it
[31:03] in chronological and you know you you
[31:06] get one verse in in the book of Acts and
[31:08] then it Springs you over you're in the
[31:09] book of Corinthians for for the next
[31:11] week and a half and then all of a sudden
[31:13] it brings you back in the middle of that
[31:14] chapter of Acts because that's really
[31:16] how it was it wasn't just all one thing
[31:18] in a chapter there was so many things
[31:21] happening within there from all of those
[31:23] different letters that Paul wrote and I
[31:25] I like to say it in that way where it
[31:28] wasn't 28 days because there was a lot
[31:30] of events that took place in the book of
[31:32] Acts there was um differences between
[31:34] Brethren there was a lot of Supernatural
[31:37] that took place uh there was also there
[31:39] was churches and lives being established
[31:42] and and God working to uh establish the
[31:46] work in many different local places and
[31:49] how that then would come about churches
[31:51] where Paul would write of that and so
[31:54] with that this is where brother Bram
[31:56] even in his burden was seeing of how
[31:58] that the desire would be to have local
[32:01] outposts or places to we that this
[32:05] message there would be churches
[32:07] established that would be able uh to
[32:09] take the people on after their lives had
[32:13] been committed to the Lord through the
[32:14] meetings and so this is where he even is
[32:17] speaking you know in regards to uh the
[32:19] Brethren there and then he says even to
[32:22] fathers and he says you know we've got
[32:24] to make arrangements for our children
[32:27] that are coming behind us because we
[32:28] want to see this continue on now we know
[32:32] that God's word's Eternal and you can't
[32:34] stop God's word but it's something that
[32:37] must be in our hearts that Lord God
[32:40] gives us the grace and also sometimes
[32:43] God has to kind of stir us a little bit
[32:45] to help us to see that things aren't
[32:48] just going to happen but God works
[32:52] through instruments he works through man
[32:56] man is his agent that that God has
[32:58] chosen and yet we we don't need to it's
[33:02] not us reaching for things or trying to
[33:04] make things happen but it's simply
[33:06] staying within the continuity of what
[33:09] God desires to do in each season of time
[33:13] this is why that uh you know with things
[33:16] that uh I just was uh speaking and a a
[33:18] brother had had asked me to listen to a
[33:20] few different things and look at it
[33:22] because you know sometimes you can have
[33:24] and and sometimes I think uh when you
[33:27] know uh a person's can get in and
[33:29] they're looking at prophecy and they're
[33:31] wanting to make this fit and make this
[33:33] fit and and uh you know take this and
[33:36] they'll they'll take something that
[33:37] brother Bram has said and then they'll
[33:39] go way out here and and then you're
[33:40] looking and saying how did we get way
[33:42] out here from what brother brand said
[33:45] and so just simply I I sent back to the
[33:47] brother I sent just what come to me
[33:49] there on Friday I just sent back to him
[33:51] and I said look look what it says in
[33:53] Daniel when it said Daniel was stirred
[33:55] by the spirit of God and he understood
[33:57] by the book books of what time and hour
[34:00] so I said what was what what it what was
[34:03] was already in the books and that's what
[34:05] you recognize that in the message of the
[34:08] hour that when when the prophet of God
[34:11] being that of of the true prophet of God
[34:14] it was not him that was you know looking
[34:16] at Eisenhower and looking at kusf and
[34:19] saying oh I I wonder what could be here
[34:21] and I'm going to preach something that's
[34:23] so deep that when people leave out here
[34:24] they go wow that's deep but what did it
[34:27] do to me
[34:29] you see these are things that that's not
[34:31] what the prophet of God did as a matter
[34:34] of fact it wasn't something that he was
[34:35] trying to do it's God alerted
[34:40] him are you hearing me see the same way
[34:43] if we can catch this I'm going to go
[34:45] into some things here tonight once again
[34:47] you can see the parallel the way that
[34:49] God will work with these nine spiritual
[34:52] gifts that always have to be tested
[34:55] proven judged
[34:58] God the way that we can test it and
[35:00] operate it and prove it as well yes it
[35:02] has to be by the word but when it
[35:05] operates in its Purity it'll operate the
[35:09] same way that it operates through that
[35:12] of a
[35:13] prophet because you'll find that a lot
[35:15] of these gifts it over overlaps and how
[35:18] that it will it will work and operate
[35:20] the same way and I say that with this in
[35:22] with this with this in mind that it is
[35:24] not the prophet that was trying to
[35:27] figure things out but it was God
[35:29] alerting him to the hour and all of a
[35:31] sudden here he catches this of of of
[35:34] clay and he's catching those names those
[35:36] things are are standing out to him and
[35:38] right away the spirit of God announces
[35:41] for that of Daniel's image we are in the
[35:44] two big
[35:45] toes so it wasn't something that you
[35:48] know that brother Bron was trying to you
[35:49] know like a like a puzzle and trying to
[35:51] put together it's the season that we're
[35:55] in and God has a man man on the scene to
[35:59] catch the word of God for that hour
[36:03] that'll catch a people and a people will
[36:05] be come under that word and be prepared
[36:08] for that hour you know the more that we
[36:11] can look at it that in that way it it
[36:13] should give us a real rest and that's
[36:15] what the word as the word is continually
[36:18] being unfolded and what we would call
[36:22] Revelation Revelation never produces
[36:25] anxiousness right
[36:28] but real Revelation it's peace because
[36:30] what Revelation is it is God's will
[36:34] being sovereignly revealed which is
[36:37] Faith it brings a settl it brings a
[36:39] confidence within our lives so there's
[36:41] always things that we can check within
[36:43] it and there's nothing that within it
[36:45] that we ever have to press and and you
[36:49] know to try to uh get into and and move
[36:52] into but God has everything right in his
[36:54] season and in his time and so I want you
[36:57] just to catch where brother randam is
[36:59] saying this let me just read maybe a
[37:01] quotation to begin brother Bram says in
[37:04] each local church there's nine spiritual
[37:06] gifts that's given to the people and
[37:09] that's what you know of 1 Corinthians 12
[37:11] speaking in tongues interpretations gift
[37:13] of Prophecy wisdom knowledge so forth
[37:16] those gifts go into the church every
[37:19] member of the body of Christ is subject
[37:23] to any of those gifts at any time see
[37:27] it's not that a person is born with a
[37:30] gift of speaking in tongues no the five
[37:33] ministerial offices is What is pre is
[37:36] for ordained by God but the nine
[37:40] spiritual gifts any member in the body
[37:43] of Christ is subject to
[37:46] him it's subject it can move right
[37:48] through this right brother BR says it
[37:50] can happen on one tonight and never and
[37:53] never again so it it is every member of
[37:56] the body of of Christ is subject to any
[37:59] of those gifts at any time God gives
[38:01] them and they work through the members
[38:03] of his church this is what I love
[38:05] they're all working together for one
[38:08] purpose to the perfecting of the body of
[38:11] Christ that's when everything is held
[38:14] within its continuity not only with the
[38:16] nine spiritual gifts no matter if it's
[38:18] uh any ministering any special singing
[38:21] anything we do even things that may not
[38:23] even be seen or known by anything else
[38:26] by anyone else but it is with one
[38:29] purpose for the
[38:31] body that's that's the labor that we
[38:33] have is for the body of Believers it's
[38:36] not it's not you know that that my part
[38:39] or your part you mine's any less yours
[38:41] any greater we all have a part to play
[38:44] Within this that's right and you know in
[38:46] order for that to be achieved it really
[38:49] it requires you and I and we'll always
[38:51] be tested within it on whether and how
[38:54] much that we are are willing cuz in
[38:56] order for you Unity you we've got to be
[38:59] able to be able to agree uh to disagree
[39:02] in order for Unity it it requires us to
[39:05] be able to lay aside our own opinions
[39:07] about things our own thoughts our own
[39:09] feelings for for a greater cause and
[39:12] that cause is for the body of Jesus
[39:15] Christ and so that's a very that's a
[39:18] very foundational point that Paul is
[39:21] working with among the Corinthian Church
[39:24] is to recognize it's about the body
[39:27] right it's not about your gift or or or
[39:31] what God would work through your life
[39:33] it's not about that it's about the body
[39:35] and so Paul working with them to help
[39:38] them to see that and to understand as
[39:41] well is that you know God is Sovereign
[39:44] in all of his ways God will use any
[39:48] whatever gift that that that he sees fit
[39:51] to use in his time and God might use it
[39:55] in one situation and there's another
[39:57] situation that is very comparable and
[39:59] and looks like wow God I'm going to
[40:02] expect God to use that gift over here
[40:04] God may not do that at all because when
[40:06] it all comes down to it if we're really
[40:09] really grasping what when the
[40:11] supernatural comes Among Us and
[40:13] something is said it's judged it's
[40:16] proven it comes out exactly just right
[40:18] on the mark then what that should do is
[40:21] not cause us to seek after that person
[40:25] but to recognize that God who gave that
[40:28] word is the same God that lives in my
[40:30] life am he's the same God that's with me
[40:33] at all times so it doesn't make us
[40:36] dependent on a gift it just causes our
[40:39] faith to rest in the Living God Amen how
[40:43] many of you think you know sometimes
[40:45] with prophecy and sometimes with things
[40:47] that's been spoken you know there's
[40:49] things where God can call it out like
[40:51] brother B said here uh there'll be a
[40:52] person com in tonight you know and
[40:54] tongue's interpretation was given and
[40:56] and they'll be in a green scarf and goes
[40:58] through all those things and then
[41:00] sometimes there's things that even can
[41:01] be years and years down the road brother
[41:04] brandham was stopped by a man and you'll
[41:06] find this in the message and and I have
[41:08] it tucked away in other places but
[41:10] brother Bram is stopped and he's trying
[41:12] to get to brother brandham and he he
[41:14] finally he gets to brother brandham and
[41:16] he says how do you spell your last name
[41:18] and brother brandham tells him and and
[41:20] he said your first name and and brother
[41:22] Brown tells him and he said Mama it's
[41:24] exactly right he said this is exactly
[41:27] right and what had happened is 255 years
[41:30] before brother Bram showed up on the
[41:31] west coast tongues and prophecy had went
[41:34] forth and they had wrote it on a piece
[41:37] of paper and they showed the paper to
[41:39] brother brandham it had been judged and
[41:42] then you know even when you look uh this
[41:44] is a little bit off but even the Book of
[41:46] Mormon I have that Book of Mormon of
[41:48] when you look within there of even
[41:50] wherein by that prophecy struck and it
[41:53] announced there will be one that will be
[41:55] coming with a Ministry by the name of
[41:58] William
[42:00] brandham but it's also very very
[42:03] important to know this is
[42:06] why what separates us and should
[42:09] separate our lives from being
[42:11] Pentecostals by
[42:13] denomination and that is we are
[42:16] believers we follow the word I hear what
[42:20] you're saying I can hear things and this
[42:22] hits and that hits but I want to know
[42:24] what you're teaching right because the
[42:27] Bible said it's known by their
[42:31] fruit but you know balum spoke things
[42:35] that was right on the money that's right
[42:37] is that right he got caught up and he
[42:39] spoke things that was right on the money
[42:41] but what made balum and error is for his
[42:46] teaching my my my my my so you know this
[42:50] is why that within everything God gives
[42:53] us such a Grace to be able to operate
[42:55] and to and to catch the leading of the
[42:58] holy spirit because I I think that
[43:00] within you know for the most part within
[43:03] hearts and lives you know it's wonderful
[43:06] to see the Supernatural and to sometimes
[43:10] when you can see that of a display but I
[43:13] want to just say it to you in this way
[43:15] there's no there really is no greater
[43:17] display of the supernatural than what
[43:19] God has done in your life amen you know
[43:23] sometimes the things that you don't even
[43:24] feel like when there's nothing taking
[43:26] place and yet God is working in your
[43:28] life because you know you can be healed
[43:32] but if God carries long enough you get
[43:33] sick again right but when your character
[43:36] has been molded and sometimes that's a
[43:38] silent work that's taking place and when
[43:41] that character is being shaped and being
[43:43] molded remember after all it's your
[43:45] character that God's going to
[43:48] Rapture and that's what's important so
[43:50] let's look here just a little bit in
[43:52] another another step here in the word we
[43:55] looked at last week the word of wisdom
[43:58] and then we want to look here tonight at
[44:00] the word of knowledge the Bible said to
[44:03] another the word of knowledge by The
[44:06] Same Spirit so when we look at this of
[44:09] the word of knowledge I want to just
[44:11] start in here with some scriptures when
[44:13] we look at in Proverbs 2:6 it says for
[44:17] the lord giveth wisdom and out of his
[44:20] mouth cometh knowledge and understanding
[44:23] he giveth Daniel said giveth wisdom unto
[44:26] the wise and knowledge to them that know
[44:31] understanding you see God I'm just say
[44:35] it in this way God's not going to waste
[44:37] his time God's going to make himself
[44:40] known among people who will believe
[44:43] it are you hearing me this is why Paul
[44:46] said that tongues is for the
[44:48] unbeliever right that's in the scripture
[44:51] but prophecy is for the believer because
[44:54] the believer will believe it yeah right
[44:57] and like Paul said they'll come in and
[44:59] they recognize when their heart has been
[45:01] deserted and they'll say God is with you
[45:05] now of course somebody could say well I
[45:07] don't I don't believe in that or they
[45:08] could turn around from it you know
[45:09] because it's it's exposing their life
[45:12] but I I want to say it in this way these
[45:14] are things that comes from God this is
[45:16] not Impressions no amen it's not a
[45:21] feeling about something it's it it is
[45:24] this with the word of knowledge it is
[45:27] something that is solely what God is
[45:29] doing that's how it is with every one of
[45:31] these nine spiritual gifts that's what
[45:34] the prophet would tell us over and over
[45:36] even where the Pentecostals got in
[45:38] trouble they came under
[45:40] Impressions and Impressions can seem so
[45:43] real right Impressions can seem can feel
[45:48] just like it's it's right on but this is
[45:50] the thing that is different is when it
[45:53] is not our thought because knowledge it
[45:57] deals with that of understanding
[45:59] intelligence it's not our thought the
[46:02] Bible said oh how great Paul said is the
[46:06] depths of his knowledge of his wisdom
[46:09] and who can instruct
[46:13] him right Hey listen look there was
[46:17] there was a man by the name uh um now I
[46:21] can't remember who was the one that just
[46:22] slipped my mind I was going to say
[46:23] Zephaniah but that ain't the one but
[46:25] remember he came and he grabbed a hold
[46:27] of the horns and Michael was standing
[46:29] there and he grabbed a hold of it and
[46:31] said well you know by this you're going
[46:33] to push on Ahab you're going to push
[46:35] them all out and and Micah Micah didn't
[46:37] even get carried away with what they
[46:38] were doing he knew where he was standing
[46:41] on the word of God you see what it was
[46:44] it was someone that was coming under an
[46:47] impression and through that listen it
[46:50] was let me just tell you then Wan the
[46:52] dud there was a great workup in that
[46:55] meeting yeah are you hearing me I mean
[46:58] it would have been a great workup the
[47:00] music would have been right everything
[47:02] would have been G it was what was it
[47:04] doing moving upon the
[47:07] emotions and they were they was going to
[47:10] prophesy just exactly according to Ahab
[47:13] but that's not how prophecy works it's
[47:16] not us dictating to God how to fulfill
[47:19] his word neither the word of knowledge
[47:22] it is God sovereignly dropping down and
[47:25] it's spoken out
[47:27] it's
[47:31] God
[47:34] so this is why I mean many things we
[47:36] could say within it but let me just give
[47:38] you a few places here and I want you
[47:40] just to watch how brother Bram is going
[47:42] into this he says now he says you know
[47:45] if we're trying to learn how to write
[47:46] the check for
[47:48] healing well now it might would do
[47:50] something it might he might do something
[47:53] that would speak to you of something
[47:54] that has been and it has to be the
[47:57] spirit of Prophecy or a gift of the word
[48:00] of knowledge that would go back down
[48:03] through life's journey and find
[48:05] something down through there and bring
[48:07] it back to your memory then you'd say
[48:10] that would be something that youd know
[48:11] comes
[48:12] supernaturally so notice that even
[48:16] within this you find how close that that
[48:18] is in working of Prophecy and and a word
[48:21] of knowledge brother BR says in my new
[48:24] ministry the ministry has not been my
[48:27] Ministry to lay hands on the sick it's
[48:30] been to make by a Divine gift to bring
[48:32] the presence of the Lord Jesus in
[48:35] Presence by a discernment of spirit
[48:37] which is called in the Bible a gift of
[48:40] knowledge and in doing so it makes him
[48:43] manifest before the people and then they
[48:46] receive him as their healer that settles
[48:48] it now let's just look at this for a
[48:50] moment here is brother Bram standing
[48:53] here in this realm he doesn't know this
[48:56] person person that's coming up here on
[48:59] the
[49:00] platform right he doesn't know them and
[49:03] here they come up on the platform and
[49:06] and not only not only is a situation
[49:10] discerned but even many times their
[49:13] address is called
[49:14] out right is that right things that the
[49:18] holy spirit is so is so punctual to call
[49:22] to call out within that now I'm going to
[49:24] ask you whose intelligence was that
[49:27] that whose knowledge was that see this
[49:31] is why brother BR could say he said oh
[49:33] he says I hear you saying amen out there
[49:36] he said but down in here I hear coming
[49:39] out here you're saying it's psychology
[49:42] oh my so people were saying amen here
[49:45] but down here they were calling it
[49:46] psychology you see they were looking at
[49:48] it as being mind reading and to the
[49:50] Natural mind it's like how is this done
[49:53] but you know if they only read the Bible
[49:56] right it was through the life of the
[49:58] Lord Jesus and all the way back down
[50:01] through the Old
[50:02] Testament that's the kind of God we
[50:04] serve we're not talking about a god
[50:07] who's coming to manage current crisis
[50:10] we're talking about a god before there
[50:13] ever was a
[50:15] devil it was already set the end from
[50:18] the beginning before there was ever any
[50:21] hurt any wound any mistake anything he
[50:24] was already God and he saw the end from
[50:27] the
[50:29] beginning and God has committed himself
[50:32] by his word and God would allow a
[50:35] prophet to be lifted up even to where
[50:38] how many times when you hear the prophet
[50:40] and he'll say it in this way I love this
[50:41] particular quote he says oh I I I see
[50:44] you praying near your bed and and you're
[50:46] praying about this situation and I hear
[50:49] your prayer in a land called prayer
[50:53] Hallelujah you see sometimes we think
[50:55] our prayers are not going anywhere but
[50:57] there's a land called prayer Hallelujah
[50:59] some of you older ones you remember when
[51:01] I preached on that years ago the land
[51:03] called prayer where here when go that
[51:05] and listen we're experiencing we're
[51:07] getting ready to experience the effects
[51:10] of that land called prayer we have many
[51:12] times but we're getting ready to
[51:14] experience it when all of the prayers
[51:16] that's been offered up and looking for
[51:19] the coming of the lord it's going to be
[51:21] poured out upon our lives in Rapture the
[51:24] Fulfillment of every prayer it has not
[51:27] went wasted or unheard but it's all
[51:29] going to come in its season and its
[51:32] time this is why prayer is so important
[51:35] there and God allowed a prophet to tap
[51:37] in to that land called prayer and hear
[51:39] what that person was praying and then to
[51:42] announce them that your answer is
[51:46] here even to be able to
[51:49] take with Bud Southwick and his
[51:53] situation with his brother who was an
[51:55] epileptic case
[51:58] couldn't get free and notice the Lord
[52:02] would speak to the prophet and said he's
[52:05] going to he have this color shirt he
[52:06] have this kind of shirt yeah when he
[52:08] comes you get that you take that shirt
[52:10] and you throw it in the fire right you
[52:13] remember that I'm a witness brother
[52:14] brother Eddie bisc tells that and and
[52:16] here what God brought God brought a
[52:18] Deliverance to brother Bud's brother he
[52:22] was
[52:24] free now where did that knowledge come
[52:26] come
[52:28] from because to you and I it would not
[52:31] seem to make sense oh I take the I take
[52:33] the man's shirt off and throw it in the
[52:35] fire but God knows what he's doing the
[52:37] the symbol and all of those parts within
[52:39] it and I'm just saying to you what
[52:41] knowledge is that it's not the knowledge
[52:43] of
[52:44] man God lifted the prophet up and had
[52:47] him to speak those things in that time
[52:50] it was a gift of knowledge being
[52:54] manifested through that of a prophet
[52:57] so what you'll find as we're going
[52:58] through these nine spiritual gifts
[53:00] you'll find that each one of these nine
[53:02] spiritual gifts there's been a lot of
[53:04] these things that's already been been
[53:07] it's it's it's been uh exemplified or
[53:09] shown or manifest through that of a
[53:11] prophet to me it's only fitting you know
[53:13] why CU it shows what it is in its
[53:17] Purity now a prophet it don't have to be
[53:20] judged he's born a prophet I've read
[53:23] that to you over and over the prophet
[53:25] said nobody sets before a prophet but
[53:29] when it operates as one of the nine
[53:31] spiritual gifts it's got to be
[53:34] judged Hallelujah that's where and I've
[53:36] read this to you but I think it's good
[53:38] to remind us as we're on it this is why
[53:40] brother Brandon would say that statement
[53:42] over and over and talk about how the
[53:44] latter Reign Brethren got it all mixed
[53:47] up because somebody gave a prophecy and
[53:50] all of a sudden they laid hands on him
[53:52] and said you're a prophet brother BR
[53:55] said that's an error right it's a gift
[53:57] of
[53:58] Prophecy right and it's got to be judged
[54:02] see that err and how that all started
[54:04] when you hear Brother R talking about
[54:05] that latter rain that's what was going
[54:07] on those are things that was taking
[54:09] place in that hour in that time now
[54:11] watch how brother Bram says this once
[54:13] again he says I've seen Lots called
[54:16] discernment and I don't believe in but I
[54:19] know there's truly a Discerning spirit
[54:20] of God the gift of knowledge that calls
[54:24] and speaks and it's perfect every time
[54:28] and we're earnestly contending for that
[54:30] that faith that was once delivered to
[54:32] the Saints now when brother BR says it
[54:34] would that's perfect every time we're
[54:37] talking there in that of not only on the
[54:40] prophetic realm of where the Prophet is
[54:42] standing and you'll never find one
[54:44] you'll never find one discernment that
[54:46] was wrong right you'll never find one
[54:49] that was
[54:50] wrong it was everything was hitting
[54:53] right on the dot you know why said
[54:56] because I've never trusted in
[54:59] myself I've trusted in him there because
[55:03] we're talking about a
[55:05] prophet now if it could hit perfectly
[55:09] through that of a
[55:10] prophet could God not hit perfectly
[55:13] through a
[55:14] body you could say well it's got to be
[55:17] judged that's true that's what helps to
[55:19] keep things perfect right is that it's
[55:23] judged and if something slips out of the
[55:25] line here here or there like the prophet
[55:27] said then we get that evil spirit out
[55:29] from among us and we go
[55:32] on now this is why think of this this
[55:35] word when when Paul would write of this
[55:38] and he would say if I come to you
[55:39] speaking with tongues what shall I
[55:41] profit you except I speak to you either
[55:44] by Revelation or by knowledge or by
[55:47] prophesying or by Doctrine and Paul goes
[55:50] in bringing on that distinction of sound
[55:53] and and you know except that give a
[55:55] distinction in the sound how shall it be
[55:57] known what is piped or heart for if the
[55:59] trumpet give an uncertain sound who
[56:01] shall prepare himself to the battle now
[56:07] this scripture how fitting for Paul to
[56:09] place this right here because this is
[56:11] where brother bham himself when he begin
[56:14] to really bring things down in the
[56:16] Tabernacle and you hear Brother Bram
[56:18] I've read to you different quotes where
[56:19] different ones would say say this very
[56:22] phrase and it and and and brother B
[56:24] Echoes it right there at the Tabernacle
[56:26] when he not only does Church order but
[56:28] then when he comes around in question
[56:29] answer 64 he said there were those when
[56:32] brother bradam started speaking on how
[56:34] that these gifts should be in such
[56:37] reverence and they should hit right on
[56:39] the money and he they said brother Bram
[56:42] you're putting us on the spot and
[56:43] brother BR says don't you think I'm on
[56:45] the spot every single night on the
[56:47] platform this is why brother BR says in
[56:49] church order 1963 he says we don't want
[56:53] anything but real and genuine in other
[56:55] words God don't just give us something
[56:57] and say just take care just have this
[56:59] and I'll give you the real after a while
[57:01] no we want
[57:03] real we want genuine we just don't want
[57:06] to have something to say we have
[57:07] something we want to have real and have
[57:09] genuine I'm quoting his words with on
[57:12] that because a lot of different things
[57:14] can can come in with that and I I thank
[57:17] God for the grace that he's given us
[57:18] here within this assembly but I believe
[57:21] God wants to give us more grace and I
[57:24] believe when we look here in the
[57:25] scripture that this if if think about it
[57:27] brother caros you've been in the
[57:29] military and others that's been in there
[57:30] you listen for certain sounds to know
[57:32] what to do you don't you don't hear a
[57:35] certain sound brother Gomez you were in
[57:36] the military too right he can't hear
[57:41] me somebody piped the trumpet to
[57:47] him what a scripture what a point to say
[57:50] it
[57:52] on I'll get it afterwards but you know
[57:56] we we we at least we kind of know a
[57:58] little bit about this that you you you
[57:59] hear certain things and you know what to
[58:01] do like if I were to hear certain things
[58:03] they had tapes you know that when my
[58:05] brother was stationed in fort Fort Riley
[58:07] Kansas they had tapes and you know those
[58:09] neat little things and I think my dad
[58:11] bought some of them you know with this
[58:12] thought in mind and and you know you're
[58:14] playing them I don't know what they mean
[58:15] but they have a meaning to those who are
[58:17] trained to that and that's the same way
[58:20] it is with the nine spiritual gifts it's
[58:23] not just things in general it's not just
[58:25] things things that just left up in the
[58:27] air but God is specific to give you and
[58:30] I Direction amen just as he is with his
[58:34] word it's not something that's back and
[58:36] forth and you know well I don't know
[58:38] where we're standing and I don't know
[58:40] maybe this or maybe that this is why
[58:42] that like the prophet said to his fire
[58:44] as like a minister if it's not solid in
[58:47] your heart and you know what you're
[58:48] preaching don't get up and preach it
[58:51] until it is solid with
[58:54] you sometimes that gets you know kind of
[58:56] convulated or mixed around with or they
[58:59] they think they know it listen you
[59:00] better know where you're standing when
[59:02] you're approaching the word of God we
[59:04] can't stand here and say well it might
[59:06] be this or it might be that there's got
[59:08] to be an absolute and that absolute
[59:11] comes by when the word has been revealed
[59:13] then the people can rise in
[59:17] confidence this is why the spirit of God
[59:20] would take things laying right down
[59:22] through the word and a person could say
[59:24] well brother R says this over here and
[59:26] says this over here but God supplies a
[59:28] gift to be able to tie those things
[59:31] together so that they're not they're not
[59:33] conflicting but it actually works
[59:36] together when the spirit of God gets a
[59:38] hold of
[59:40] it and it brings
[59:44] stability now this word of knowledge
[59:47] let's look let's look here in second
[59:49] Kings chapter 6 I'm going to give you a
[59:51] few examples here tonight second Kings
[59:53] chapter 6 verse 8 here's Elisha the the
[59:56] Bible says the king of Syria wared
[59:58] against Israel and took counsel with his
[1:00:01] servants saying in such and such a place
[1:00:03] shall be my Camp so the king is is is
[1:00:06] telling his subjects of Syria we're
[1:00:09] going to Camp here and the man of God
[1:00:12] sent unto the king of Israel saying
[1:00:15] beware that thou pass not such a place
[1:00:18] for thither the syrians are come down
[1:00:21] and the king of Israel sent to the place
[1:00:24] which the man of God told him and warned
[1:00:26] him and saved himself there not once nor
[1:00:29] twice therefore the heart of the king of
[1:00:32] Syria was sore troubled for this thing
[1:00:35] and he called his servants and said unto
[1:00:38] them who's the
[1:00:40] Spy who's the double
[1:00:44] agent who's working here for the other
[1:00:48] guy you know who's go who's working for
[1:00:51] Israel and verse 12 one of his servants
[1:00:53] said none my Lord O King but he Elisha
[1:00:56] the prophet is in Israel and tth the
[1:00:59] king of Israel the words that thou
[1:01:02] speakest in thy bed
[1:01:04] chamber amen what was it it was a word
[1:01:08] the word of knowledge beware they're
[1:01:11] coming at this advancement and God
[1:01:13] through the word of knowledge gave a
[1:01:16] gave an issue to that of the king of
[1:01:19] Israel and he was able to defeat the
[1:01:21] enemy cannot God do the same thing for
[1:01:24] you and I God can direct that word
[1:01:26] coming right down and let us know this
[1:01:29] is where the enemy is preparing his
[1:01:33] attack oh God help us not just to wonder
[1:01:36] when a message is being preached and
[1:01:38] what we're looking at because listen
[1:01:40] friends sometimes the things that God is
[1:01:43] saying I've never ceased to see it the
[1:01:45] things that sometimes God is saying
[1:01:47] right now it's what's coming down the
[1:01:50] road amen God working to stabilize us
[1:01:54] this is why yes I'm thankful for the
[1:01:57] word you know I love when the word comes
[1:01:59] and my understanding to shout in it but
[1:02:02] remember when it touches my life it's
[1:02:04] something that God is speaking to my
[1:02:06] life to give
[1:02:08] direction you say wait a minute brother
[1:02:10] Samuel you're talking about the word of
[1:02:14] knowledge how do you think a preacher
[1:02:17] preaches brother brandham even tells us
[1:02:19] he said God will drop down knowledge and
[1:02:23] anoint that man and that man can begin
[1:02:26] to minister that word to where you can
[1:02:28] begin to see it's a finished work what
[1:02:32] is it it's God working through through
[1:02:34] through his body it's called moving
[1:02:36] right while the word's going to going
[1:02:38] taking place oh aren't you glad you know
[1:02:41] that's why we don't have to sit in our
[1:02:42] seats and you know bite our fingernails
[1:02:44] and run to the bathroom and wait for the
[1:02:45] end of service for God to do something
[1:02:48] we know that God is a god of his word
[1:02:51] and God can come right where the word is
[1:02:53] coming forth and fill with the Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost burn out sin burn out desire and
[1:02:58] give answers to our lives that's the
[1:03:01] kind of God we
[1:03:03] serve the Lord now notice notice how the
[1:03:06] prophet puts this Elisha seen where that
[1:03:09] King was going he was going to do and he
[1:03:11] sent to the king of Israel and said now
[1:03:13] don't go down that way because they're
[1:03:15] laying down there waiting and watch that
[1:03:18] same Prophet after going down to Dothan
[1:03:22] the angel of the Lord never showed him
[1:03:23] about the syrians coming out and
[1:03:25] covering the City over for God had
[1:03:27] another way for that ain't that
[1:03:29] incredible I mean you you can see it in
[1:03:31] your Bible right down the very next
[1:03:33] passage and God has told him here's the
[1:03:35] king HEI coming right here over here
[1:03:38] coming right there coming right there
[1:03:40] then he goes down to
[1:03:41] Dothan and gazel wakes up you know gets
[1:03:44] the espresso machine going pours in the
[1:03:46] beans everything you know and all of a
[1:03:48] sudden he's not ready to face the day
[1:03:50] and he had had his cup of coffee and to
[1:03:51] see all of those mountains filled with
[1:03:54] the Enemy oh dear lord what are we going
[1:03:58] to do and Elisha gets out there sleeping
[1:04:01] his eyes and said you got the coffee
[1:04:02] going
[1:04:04] yet right now God could have showed
[1:04:08] Elisha they're going to surround the
[1:04:10] city they're going to do this Elisha but
[1:04:13] you see sometimes the way God works it's
[1:04:16] all in his sovereignty God is not
[1:04:20] working that we become dependent on a
[1:04:24] gift
[1:04:26] right Hallelujah but a gift is only to
[1:04:29] make known his
[1:04:32] presence his care for our lives but to
[1:04:35] build our faith as a matter of fact it
[1:04:38] was Elisha and brother Bram tells us he
[1:04:41] said Elisha didn't even see those angels
[1:04:43] on the mountain he said what it was he
[1:04:45] said Elisha had confidence in the word
[1:04:48] that was spoken that the angel of the
[1:04:50] Lord encampeth around about those that
[1:04:51] fear and love him Oh my he was able to
[1:04:55] see God's word is true so he can stand
[1:04:57] there and say God open his eyes you know
[1:05:00] what the opening of his eyes would have
[1:05:02] been it would have been then the word of
[1:05:04] knowledge he would see and understand
[1:05:08] this is what's given peace to this man
[1:05:10] right here Elisha had a true knowledge
[1:05:14] of God and it gave him peace even in the
[1:05:18] midst of all that he was looking at and
[1:05:21] that's before he even had his coffee
[1:05:25] God don't show his servants all things
[1:05:29] but he shows his servants just the word
[1:05:32] of knowledge as much as they have need
[1:05:35] to know it lays in God's power not in
[1:05:39] the power of man though man be blessed
[1:05:42] but yet God is the father and the ruler
[1:05:46] overall my wife and I were talking here
[1:05:48] just the other day it might have been
[1:05:50] last week now that we're talking about
[1:05:52] it she she'd been listening to that
[1:05:54] message I had been telling y'all to
[1:05:55] listen to questions and answers God
[1:05:57] being misunderstood and she said you
[1:05:59] know I said I listen to that and hear
[1:06:00] how that somebody asked brother Bram
[1:06:02] they sent him a note and said brother
[1:06:04] Brandon would you pray that God will let
[1:06:06] me find my
[1:06:08] keys you know I few people came to mind
[1:06:11] that lose their keys you know and uh you
[1:06:14] know brother Bram talks about that I you
[1:06:15] wonder how many requests brother Bram
[1:06:17] got like that he told us how many
[1:06:18] requests he got can you imagine if God
[1:06:21] would have left his Prophet here oh my
[1:06:25] his cell phone would have getting blown
[1:06:27] up Lord can you tell me where brother
[1:06:29] brother R can you tell me where my keys
[1:06:31] are at brother R can you tell me how the
[1:06:32] crops are going to come out brother Ram
[1:06:33] can you tell me this brother B can you
[1:06:34] tell you know what it would have been a
[1:06:36] bride that was leaning on the
[1:06:41] man and would have been but remember
[1:06:44] Rebecca was to be brought back to Isaac
[1:06:47] and what God manifested was only the
[1:06:50] sign of who it came from hallah are you
[1:06:53] with me listen friends all of us I'm
[1:06:55] talking about all I'm not talking about
[1:06:56] people I'm talking about all of us can
[1:06:58] you imagine because it could be it can
[1:07:00] become a tendency it's very easy in our
[1:07:02] humanness because we're made to rely
[1:07:06] we're made to rest we're made to trust
[1:07:10] right God help us if somebody lets us
[1:07:14] down God help us I mean but you see God
[1:07:17] doesn't want us relying on a gift or a
[1:07:21] man you know God don't even want you
[1:07:23] relying on the gift of your pastor
[1:07:25] that's right there's 's an element of it
[1:07:26] you have to trust that God is moving
[1:07:28] down through that gift to speak and give
[1:07:30] what you have need of but then taking
[1:07:32] that word and living by that word and
[1:07:35] applying it to our lives to know God
[1:07:37] that's what I have need
[1:07:39] of so then it is in US telling God what
[1:07:42] to do it's God giving direction to us so
[1:07:45] it operates this word of knowledge it
[1:07:47] operates in the same way watch watch how
[1:07:50] that brother Ram goes into this he says
[1:07:52] where Pentecost failed he says God
[1:07:54] forsaw placed in set of certain things
[1:07:56] to happen and therefore he could take
[1:07:58] the prophets with the gift of knowledge
[1:08:00] and for show them what was going to be
[1:08:02] and they could speak it because it's a
[1:08:05] word of knowledge that God gives to his
[1:08:08] Prophet right how many where brother
[1:08:11] brandham here he is God's
[1:08:14] Prophet but you just couldn't go up to
[1:08:16] brother brandham and say brother Bram
[1:08:17] can you tell me
[1:08:19] this you
[1:08:21] couldn't this is why brother brand when
[1:08:23] I've given an example over and over with
[1:08:24] that little that lady that had that
[1:08:26] problem where she had went out on her
[1:08:28] husband and he had done the same thing
[1:08:30] too she brother Bradon didn't know what
[1:08:32] was going on in her life and he said
[1:08:34] when the angel of the Lord comes back to
[1:08:35] the house I'll send mey to get you you
[1:08:38] see so it wasn't just something we can
[1:08:40] just call up at any time or work up at
[1:08:42] any time and and even and it wasn't even
[1:08:44] it wasn't even something to wear that
[1:08:46] different ones you know even where
[1:08:48] brother bham they wanted him to come to
[1:08:51] Germany and to pray for the stash Cliff
[1:08:54] baby they had a they had a military G
[1:08:55] jet waiting on him but he says just a
[1:08:58] moment sister St let me go see what
[1:09:00] father says about it because surely God
[1:09:03] could have raised that little boy up how
[1:09:05] many did he did he raise up healed the
[1:09:08] blind
[1:09:10] eyes I tell you sometime when we get
[1:09:13] through the other side I think God I
[1:09:15] want to I want to shake sister stads
[1:09:16] Cliff's hand right because when you see
[1:09:21] as she her little baby was taken on home
[1:09:24] to be with the Lord
[1:09:26] and she questioning herself I must not
[1:09:28] have had faith I must not have been you
[1:09:31] know had a real good faith in brother on
[1:09:34] the contrary he said you had great faith
[1:09:37] because even when God made the decision
[1:09:40] to take your little baby you have stood
[1:09:43] firm with your
[1:09:45] testimony amen so to think that even it
[1:09:48] wasn't just something that could you
[1:09:50] know take place and just happen and you
[1:09:52] know but everything was in God's timing
[1:09:55] in God's way and and notice brother says
[1:09:58] a vision is God by a word of knowledge
[1:10:02] dropping to the person to foresee
[1:10:04] something or tell something that has
[1:10:06] been or something that'll be he goes on
[1:10:09] and says in the Hebrew series what is
[1:10:12] prophetic it is just his knowledge he's
[1:10:15] the chief attorney he the judge and he
[1:10:19] speaks to the lawyer some of his wisdom
[1:10:23] and that's the prophecy that that can
[1:10:25] foretell because he knows what it's
[1:10:28] going to be so here here is the judge
[1:10:32] and he's able to speak to the
[1:10:35] lawyer we've not we've not got a
[1:10:38] second-handed
[1:10:39] revelation this is not a man who's
[1:10:42] winning in prob but a prophet is one who
[1:10:44] is caught up by God he's an eagle that
[1:10:48] is caught up here's the written word but
[1:10:51] he's caught up into the thoughts of God
[1:10:54] and comes back down and he gives to you
[1:10:56] and I the prophet is a Divine
[1:10:59] interpreter of the word it's a gift of
[1:11:02] knowledge what does it bring it brings
[1:11:04] subtleness it brings understanding this
[1:11:07] is why brother BR said you think Isaiah
[1:11:09] cursed a people like that no but by
[1:11:11] seeing a vision which God had already
[1:11:13] knew before the foundation of the world
[1:11:15] by for knowledge and Isaiah looked in
[1:11:18] and seen what was coming and Isaiah
[1:11:21] reported what God had said before the
[1:11:23] foundation of the world for this word
[1:11:26] here tonight is only what God said
[1:11:29] before the world was created and with a
[1:11:31] prophet and it's called a gift of
[1:11:35] knowledge now remember remember the
[1:11:38] thought within this that it'll operate
[1:11:41] in the same way now God's not through
[1:11:44] one of the nine spiritual gifts God's
[1:11:47] not coming down with a gift of knowledge
[1:11:49] as one of the nine spiritual gifts and
[1:11:51] is all of a sudden going to give some
[1:11:54] sort of a you know uh like where a
[1:11:56] prophet is caught up and he catches the
[1:11:58] interpretation of the word but God comes
[1:12:00] down to deal with situations that are
[1:12:03] present within our lives things that are
[1:12:07] alt together not altogether written in
[1:12:09] the word now you might say well brother
[1:12:11] Samy you said moments ago that God will
[1:12:13] come down and anoint that with knowledge
[1:12:15] well the prophet said that and a
[1:12:16] minister will speak but he's not just
[1:12:19] taking he's taking what's written but
[1:12:21] God is the one who creates and gives you
[1:12:23] a vision so that you can begin to see
[1:12:25] yourself as a whole
[1:12:28] person it's God that begins to give that
[1:12:31] and and you begin to see yourself in the
[1:12:34] word that I am healed it's made so real
[1:12:38] as a matter of fact I love how brother B
[1:12:39] said it he said if you can get a vision
[1:12:41] in front of you of a perfectly whole
[1:12:44] person then walk step by step by step
[1:12:48] until you become that person that's what
[1:12:50] the word does look on the counter on the
[1:12:53] other side What did the what did the
[1:12:55] nine the the 10 spies they had a word
[1:12:59] right and it was knowledge of Earthly
[1:13:02] knowledge look how big the Giants are
[1:13:03] look how the cities we're nothing we're
[1:13:06] in no comparison and that knowledge
[1:13:08] brought
[1:13:09] fear and all they saw they already saw
[1:13:13] themselves defeated we
[1:13:15] were in our own eyes as
[1:13:18] grasshoppers that Vision was a vision of
[1:13:21] defeat but Caleb and Joshua come back
[1:13:24] and here and stabilizing the people of
[1:13:27] God was to bring a vision of Victory now
[1:13:31] let's look here in the scripture let's
[1:13:32] go over to Second Kings I and I I could
[1:13:35] have just put it up there but I just
[1:13:36] want to refer to it and you
[1:13:40] can we can jump down through here just a
[1:13:42] little bit in 2 Kings chapter
[1:13:45] 3 and verse
[1:13:50] 14 here's a here's another situation
[1:13:56] that has come about and here is
[1:13:59] Elisha you have some that have gotten in
[1:14:02] trouble and they don't even know
[1:14:04] remember jehosaphats went along you know
[1:14:06] with uh out there you know uh and and
[1:14:10] and and and as he's he's lined up with
[1:14:12] with the wrong company and he goes out
[1:14:15] there and and they're out there without
[1:14:17] water right now look at the mercy of God
[1:14:22] they don't know how to get out of that
[1:14:23] fix they're in sure and they need they
[1:14:27] need the wisdom they need the knowledge
[1:14:31] of God what do we do in this situation
[1:14:34] let me tell you friends let me just say
[1:14:36] it to you like this
[1:14:38] sometimes that's the greatest thing we
[1:14:40] could do instead of trying to find and
[1:14:43] make things happen on our
[1:14:45] own are you hearing me I'm just speaking
[1:14:48] from my heart tonight because we can try
[1:14:50] to do things on our own and let me just
[1:14:52] tell you if you've already gotten a fix
[1:14:55] you got to come to a spot to say I'm in
[1:14:56] a fix God I need
[1:14:58] help I need help don't try to well I'll
[1:15:01] do it on my own you're listen you ain't
[1:15:03] proving nothing to
[1:15:05] nobody you ain't proving nothing to
[1:15:07] nobody and stop trying to show off for
[1:15:09] the devil cuz that's all it is just
[1:15:11] wanting to get on your flesh that oh I'm
[1:15:12] going to do this and I'm going to do
[1:15:14] that we do have the most powerful
[1:15:16] message but God has not just given us
[1:15:18] knowledge the first thing he sent down
[1:15:21] was wisdom that's what the message came
[1:15:23] by
[1:15:25] cuz we can have a lot of knowledge but
[1:15:26] we can get in trouble with that
[1:15:27] knowledge without wisdom governing it so
[1:15:30] we don't want to Lord I need your help
[1:15:32] they at least right here they could call
[1:15:35] out and they went and got one they got a
[1:15:39] man and by the name of Elisha we need
[1:15:42] help in this situation God I need help
[1:15:45] oh God may we have that kind of humility
[1:15:47] Lord I need help however you're going to
[1:15:49] speak to my heart however you're going
[1:15:51] to direct it Lord whether it's going to
[1:15:52] come through an answering prayer well
[1:15:54] I'm listen to a message right across the
[1:15:56] pull pit or God will it'll come down and
[1:15:59] anoint someone it'll be proven out
[1:16:01] judged received and that answer will go
[1:16:03] forth but any rate God I need
[1:16:09] help you know brother brandham walked a
[1:16:12] long time by his knowledge when he was
[1:16:14] as a Trapper well Bill brandham you're
[1:16:17] not lost you're not lost you know right
[1:16:20] where you are you know right where you
[1:16:22] are hi Mr mountain lion you know right
[1:16:25] where you are he come back around hi Mr
[1:16:27] Mountain Li you know right where you are
[1:16:28] Bill brandham you're a good Trapper hi
[1:16:30] Mr Mountain Li he's hi Mr Mountain line
[1:16:33] how many times he kept seeing that
[1:16:34] mountain line over and over that he
[1:16:36] killed and then finally he got to a
[1:16:39] place I'm
[1:16:41] lost listen friends that story not only
[1:16:45] pertains to when someone needs a real
[1:16:48] surrender in their heart to God but it
[1:16:51] also pertains to us sometimes cuz we can
[1:16:53] get lost in a swil of things of events
[1:16:58] that takes place in our life that gets
[1:17:00] us so turned around but we can look into
[1:17:04] the message of the hour there's one
[1:17:06] thing that this message showed us was
[1:17:09] humility oh God I'm lost and all of a
[1:17:12] sudden those clouds cleared and he could
[1:17:14] see that line he started walking with
[1:17:15] his hands up he caught a hold of that
[1:17:17] line because he knew at the end of it is
[1:17:19] where my wife and my little boy is at
[1:17:23] and this is where heing them Elisha is
[1:17:25] not the one who got into this but
[1:17:28] Jehoshaphat did and with the company and
[1:17:30] them not going out and seeking God as
[1:17:32] they ought to but now they started
[1:17:34] seeking God man I'll tell you I wish I
[1:17:38] had time just to preach on that just a
[1:17:39] little bit can you imagine what the
[1:17:41] devil got on their shoulder and said
[1:17:44] look at you you went off without prayer
[1:17:45] you really think that God's going to
[1:17:47] answer you now you went off without even
[1:17:50] praying this proven out this has been
[1:17:52] nothing but your reasoning your thoughts
[1:17:54] and you thought you had everything lined
[1:17:56] up you you know what the devil was
[1:17:57] trying to do he was trying to th their
[1:18:01] call for
[1:18:03] help but they there was enough enough
[1:18:07] about that that there was a call that
[1:18:09] said we need to hear from God and God
[1:18:13] gave the word of
[1:18:14] knowledge and what he told him is you're
[1:18:16] going to have to dig this Valley full of
[1:18:19] ditches true you don't have to put the
[1:18:21] water in it the same one that was with
[1:18:24] in that rock that followed them he'll
[1:18:26] fill it up but you dig it out you see
[1:18:29] sometimes it's it's us getting rid of
[1:18:31] our own
[1:18:33] self digging out and here God filled it
[1:18:36] up you know what it did not only did
[1:18:38] they give them water to drink from but
[1:18:41] the very water that they were sustained
[1:18:43] by God caused it to look as though that
[1:18:47] for the enemy turned and ran in defeat
[1:18:51] that's
[1:18:53] right amen Hal
[1:18:55] what did that the word of
[1:18:57] knowledge going on over to chapter
[1:19:00] 4 here's a widow hey these are these are
[1:19:04] serious situations these are situations
[1:19:07] it's not written in chapter five of what
[1:19:09] to do when the creditors coming for your
[1:19:13] children it's not written in the word so
[1:19:16] here she calls for
[1:19:19] Elisha hey there's a need my children
[1:19:23] they're getting ready to be taken and
[1:19:24] the Creditor coming and all of these
[1:19:26] things are are are happening and she
[1:19:28] says in verse one thy servant knowest
[1:19:31] that my thy servant did fear the lord he
[1:19:34] had a testimony and the Creditor has
[1:19:36] come to take take unto him my two sons
[1:19:38] to be bondman and Elisha said unto her
[1:19:41] what shall I do for you tell me what
[1:19:43] thou Hast in thy house and she said
[1:19:44] thine handmade hath not anything in the
[1:19:47] house save a pot of
[1:19:49] oil
[1:19:50] Hallelujah I wonder how many times she
[1:19:53] walked by that pot of oil and little did
[1:19:55] she know that the Deliverance that she
[1:19:57] had need of was already in her
[1:20:01] house let me just tell you the
[1:20:03] Deliverance that you have need of is
[1:20:06] here the Deliverance you have need of if
[1:20:08] I can take the words of a prophet out of
[1:20:11] one in a million one in a million he
[1:20:13] said healing is in you
[1:20:17] already it's laying within there already
[1:20:21] it's right there God has given to you
[1:20:24] what is
[1:20:26] needed Hallelujah to drive back the
[1:20:30] Creditor for your
[1:20:32] family God told him what to do go go
[1:20:36] borrow many vessels how many just go
[1:20:39] borrow as many as you can get and
[1:20:41] finally they filled they closed the door
[1:20:44] they filled every one of them up and
[1:20:47] then they went back to him and said
[1:20:48] we've done what you said do what do we
[1:20:50] do now the word of knowledge said go
[1:20:53] sell it and when you sell it you'll be
[1:20:56] able to pay the creditors and you'll be
[1:20:58] able to live off that oil
[1:21:01] Hall I wish I could preach right there
[1:21:04] for a
[1:21:05] while my my my my my God is so good
[1:21:08] isn't
[1:21:09] he you see what did that the word of
[1:21:13] knowledge came right down and gave
[1:21:16] that's right knowledge for this
[1:21:17] situation this why brother brand says a
[1:21:20] prophet is also a gift of knowledge it's
[1:21:23] like an attorney who studies the books
[1:21:25] and when you got to hire an attorney to
[1:21:27] app plead your case he's only taking
[1:21:29] what he knows and you're paying him for
[1:21:31] what he knows to present your case
[1:21:34] before the judge and now a gift of
[1:21:36] knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which
[1:21:39] goes up and finds out these things that
[1:21:41] are to come and brings them back down
[1:21:45] but they must compare with the Bible and
[1:21:46] with the book and if they're out of the
[1:21:48] book then then they're not received
[1:21:51] because the judge judges by the book you
[1:21:53] see so it must be on the word now how
[1:21:57] how is a prophet let's look at this how
[1:22:00] is a prophet judged by the
[1:22:02] word right by the word he's not judged
[1:22:05] by signs and wonders he's judged by the
[1:22:07] word is that right because balum had a
[1:22:10] lot of true bam had true signs and
[1:22:12] wonders but how do you judge
[1:22:15] him Moses said in Deuteronomy 13 He said
[1:22:19] when that when that man what he says
[1:22:22] comes to pass and this and that he said
[1:22:24] but if he seeks to lead you away from
[1:22:26] the word it's a false
[1:22:31] prophet now so there's emphasis and
[1:22:33] we've we've seen this just give me just
[1:22:35] a just a few more moments we've seen
[1:22:37] emphasis of things and brother Paul Paul
[1:22:41] had to deal with that in in in in
[1:22:43] Corinthian in the Corinthian Church and
[1:22:46] brother BR says and hearing him he says
[1:22:47] the world's Dying For Love that's the
[1:22:50] fountain that God's got open look I want
[1:22:52] to ask you something the greatest of all
[1:22:54] gifts that's in the local body and we
[1:22:56] put so much emphasis on speaking with
[1:22:59] tongues or interpretations and the first
[1:23:01] is wisdom the next is knowledge how are
[1:23:05] you going to operate knowledge when you
[1:23:07] haven't got wisdom to operate it with if
[1:23:10] you haven't got no wisdom you can't
[1:23:12] operate your knowledge if you haven't
[1:23:15] got knowledge you won't know how to have
[1:23:18] peace you've got to put first things
[1:23:21] first not on evidences upon the spirit
[1:23:25] and upon God now when you I want you to
[1:23:29] think of this in this manner here how
[1:23:31] wisdom and knowledge just just moving
[1:23:34] and working together like brother Bram
[1:23:36] was bringing this right here with you
[1:23:38] got to have wisdom remember brother Bram
[1:23:40] tells us in the one place he said he
[1:23:42] said you know how they were doing with
[1:23:45] the gifts and you know and just the way
[1:23:47] things were being done and brother BR
[1:23:49] said not having no control over it he
[1:23:50] said but you've got to have wisdom to
[1:23:53] know how to control it
[1:23:54] right it just like this brother Bram
[1:23:57] when he says this and you remember this
[1:23:59] in Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:24:01] when brother Bram was standing there and
[1:24:02] he gives us a little bit of an Insight
[1:24:04] that really really the whole way that
[1:24:07] he's wanted uh to be able to do it the
[1:24:10] whole time is one on-one with people and
[1:24:13] and frankly he tells us in that in that
[1:24:15] paragraph he said he said because
[1:24:18] there's many times where there's things
[1:24:20] you cannot disclose out here publicly
[1:24:23] because he said if you did it would
[1:24:25] cause Penitentiary
[1:24:27] offenses because things being unfolded
[1:24:30] now what is it knowledge but you've got
[1:24:33] to have wisdom to operate with that
[1:24:36] knowledge it just like when Paul if you
[1:24:39] think Paul just for a moment when he
[1:24:41] Paul was boy he was in a hot place and
[1:24:44] here was Pharisees and Sadducees you
[1:24:46] know how they they had got Paul and he
[1:24:48] he stands out there in the temple and
[1:24:50] Paul stands up he surveys his
[1:24:52] congregation he realized he got some
[1:24:53] Pentecost
[1:24:55] got some Baptist here and so let me just
[1:24:58] see here well there's about 80 Baptist
[1:25:00] and 20 Pentecostal and Paul got up and
[1:25:03] said who believes in eternal security
[1:25:06] right there he just split that
[1:25:08] congregation he's already got people
[1:25:10] that's going to stand up for him you
[1:25:12] know what Paul said Paul said I'm one
[1:25:14] who believes in the resurrection right
[1:25:16] away he already got people on his side
[1:25:18] that was wanting to Stone him what was
[1:25:20] that
[1:25:22] wisdom it was knowledge on what to say
[1:25:25] at that moment this is why he said don't
[1:25:27] take no thought what you shall
[1:25:30] say right there's a wisdom that God
[1:25:33] gives within those times even how did
[1:25:35] Paul he never pulled his Roman citizen
[1:25:38] passport Visa whatever you go he never
[1:25:40] pulled that out all the time hey I'm a
[1:25:42] Roman citizen hey I'm a Roman citizen
[1:25:44] but when the Holy Spirit urged
[1:25:47] him and they threw him in that
[1:25:49] Philippian jail he pulled it
[1:25:52] out is that right he had knowledge of
[1:25:55] what he had and it was wisdom that said
[1:25:57] pull it out right now see wisdom
[1:26:00] operating with knowledge that's why when
[1:26:02] God is sent in this hour like we were
[1:26:04] looking at last week and you look over
[1:26:06] in the Book of Revelations and the
[1:26:08] prophet will always take us there with
[1:26:09] that gift here is wisdom let him that
[1:26:12] hath wisdom count the
[1:26:14] number of his name you see because
[1:26:16] wisdom has come to bring stability to
[1:26:20] the Church of the Living God and wisdom
[1:26:24] bring with it also
[1:26:27] knowledge it gives understanding now you
[1:26:31] look at the effect brother brah says you
[1:26:33] can't have peace without knowledge it's
[1:26:35] it's it stabilizes this is why you look
[1:26:37] at Solomon's kingdom Solomon prayed for
[1:26:40] wisdom and he prayed for knowledge God I
[1:26:43] don't know I don't know how to lead
[1:26:44] these
[1:26:45] people and God gave him according to his
[1:26:49] request and he says I'm also going to
[1:26:51] give you what you didn't ask for right
[1:26:54] you see he was putting the emphasis on
[1:26:56] the right things and because the
[1:26:58] emphasis was on the right things God
[1:27:00] said I can trust you with these other
[1:27:03] things and what was the result there was
[1:27:05] peace there was peace in Solomon's
[1:27:07] kingdom right there was peace within it
[1:27:10] because there was wisdom that was
[1:27:12] residing there it's the same same thing
[1:27:15] that will even take place when the
[1:27:17] scripture said the Earth shall be filled
[1:27:18] with the knowledge of the glory of the
[1:27:20] Lord as the waters cover the sea even
[1:27:22] when it comes in the Millennium how the
[1:27:24] knowledge will cover this time during
[1:27:28] that time of the Millennium brother
[1:27:30] Brown says it like this Jesus never
[1:27:32] gathers with people just to be gathering
[1:27:35] Jesus never does did anything Loosely
[1:27:38] and I think that's the trouble with the
[1:27:39] church today we take too many of the
[1:27:41] things of God Loosely and I perceived
[1:27:44] that this is a Pentecostal Gathering he
[1:27:47] said you're my brothers and sisters but
[1:27:48] the Pentecostal people are too Loosely
[1:27:51] with the gifts that's in the church and
[1:27:53] that's the reason God can't respect them
[1:27:56] you just let them go any old way and
[1:27:58] they should be governed and put in order
[1:28:03] and brother Bram goes on here how that
[1:28:05] you know we find you know uh uh
[1:28:08] interruptions in the meetings and and
[1:28:11] things like that and and how that things
[1:28:13] you know are are taking place I don't
[1:28:15] know what is happening here he says we
[1:28:17] find those interruptions and then you
[1:28:19] find that and it's just it the misuse it
[1:28:21] causes a damper to be thrown on the
[1:28:24] meeting and he says we so misuse these
[1:28:26] things just letting it go
[1:28:30] freelance I looked that word up cuz I've
[1:28:32] heard that word freelance before you
[1:28:34] know what freelance is it means it's not

[1:29:40] this land today that's never been
[1:29:42] exceeded we don't lack power we lack
[1:29:46] knowledge we lack
[1:29:51] Faith oh my let me just let me finish
[1:29:54] fin on this
[1:29:57] here I want you to watch how even in
[1:30:00] brother bram's meetings I'm going to
[1:30:02] skip down to
[1:30:04] this and I want you to see this many
[1:30:08] many places in questions and answers
[1:30:10] brother Rams asked a question how am I
[1:30:12] supposed to show my wife that I really
[1:30:14] care for her and yet stay with the word
[1:30:17] by but still having a question like this
[1:30:19] said why don't you practice what you
[1:30:22] preach or believe so the man's been he's
[1:30:25] he's asking brother Brandon my wife how
[1:30:26] do I how do I how do I show her that I
[1:30:29] really care for her and stay with the
[1:30:31] word and yet she this is what she says
[1:30:34] why don't you practice what you preach
[1:30:35] or believe and brother Brown goes into
[1:30:37] that and he begins to give the direction
[1:30:40] for for this brother and and saying you
[1:30:42] know well if if you're not not living
[1:30:44] the right kind of life you know your
[1:30:45] your wife's got a right to say that but
[1:30:48] he told her he said but he tells the man
[1:30:50] he says stay in love with her and let
[1:30:52] her see Jesus in
[1:30:55] you now how does she how does how does
[1:30:58] one see Jesus in US you got to stay
[1:31:00] close to
[1:31:02] him you got to stay close to him brother
[1:31:04] BR says how do we win our loved ones by
[1:31:06] staying loyal to what we believe is that
[1:31:10] right now many of these questions that
[1:31:13] you look at this in questions and
[1:31:14] answers that brother Brandon would be
[1:31:16] asked I look at how that just so struck
[1:31:18] my heart of how that here it would not
[1:31:21] even be something on a private interview
[1:31:23] but it would be just the word of
[1:31:25] knowledge would come down and with
[1:31:27] wisdom on how to operate within those
[1:31:31] situations that would give Grace to to
[1:31:34] those individuals such as you know
[1:31:36] brother Bram when he was you know being
[1:31:37] asked you know different different times
[1:31:39] different questions like this within
[1:31:41] marriages one's a Believer and one's not
[1:31:43] and and this and and brother bandam you
[1:31:45] know is is is just letting them know
[1:31:47] don't be contentious about things but be
[1:31:50] you know staying in love and staying
[1:31:52] sweet and and he's talking about you
[1:31:54] know well if he ask you to go to that to
[1:31:56] the church you you can go get it you can
[1:31:58] eat a crumb but you know you just you
[1:32:00] stay with what you believe if anything
[1:32:02] goes against that grain don't don't go
[1:32:04] along with that what is it because she
[1:32:06] could because the wife or the husband in
[1:32:08] any one of these situations they could
[1:32:11] have just pulled out statements that God
[1:32:14] had opened to them and could have
[1:32:17] obliterated their spouse and done it all
[1:32:21] you know it have been like I do this in
[1:32:23] the name of Jesus
[1:32:24] I take your head off in the name of
[1:32:26] Jesus I do this in the come on Friends
[1:32:28] some of us when we first started serving
[1:32:30] the lord we took some people's heads off
[1:32:32] by the knowledge that we had but God had
[1:32:36] to give us wisdom because it was wisdom
[1:32:39] to know when and how to release our
[1:32:41] knowledge how to operate all of those
[1:32:44] things even how brother brandham worked
[1:32:45] with you know his his his his
[1:32:47] daughter-in-law Lois in the house and
[1:32:49] things like that and her you know her
[1:32:52] and and and and Billy you know and how
[1:32:54] everything was how that God gave the
[1:32:56] gave such knowledge and such wisdom and
[1:32:58] so I just want to you know maybe just
[1:33:00] close it out in this way here tonight
[1:33:03] this example with Paul and I'm not going
[1:33:04] to have you read it but you remember
[1:33:05] when Paul was on his way to
[1:33:08] Rome and Paul had told him don't don't
[1:33:12] let loose from here because there's
[1:33:13] going to be a serious there's going to
[1:33:16] be there's going to be we're going to
[1:33:17] suffer the ship's going to suffer loss
[1:33:19] there's going to be some things but they
[1:33:21] went ahead anyhow
[1:33:24] because they
[1:33:25] believed those of the ship and what they
[1:33:29] knew they followed them they got out
[1:33:33] there and you know this you know the
[1:33:34] whole story and where everything got
[1:33:36] to they thought they were going to die
[1:33:39] but Paul came up the angel of the Lord
[1:33:41] met him and he said the angel of the
[1:33:44] Lord whose servant I am amen and Paul
[1:33:47] goes in to let them know we're going to
[1:33:49] make it we're going to come up we're
[1:33:50] going to crash up an island but we're
[1:33:52] going to make it
[1:33:54] and he let them know further on down in
[1:33:56] there because there were some men that
[1:33:58] wanted to try to escape but they
[1:34:00] prevented their escape those men didn't
[1:34:02] even know what they were trying to where
[1:34:03] they were trying to escape from was
[1:34:06] actually their source of safety
[1:34:09] right and Paul told him said except you
[1:34:11] abide in the ship you'll not
[1:34:15] survive there's no other place of safety
[1:34:19] amen but in Jesus
[1:34:22] Christ amen you look at the storm you
[1:34:25] look at the situation but the word of
[1:34:27] knowledge says just abide in the ship
[1:34:30] don't don't jump ship just abide in the
[1:34:32] ship because why this storm too
[1:34:35] Hallelujah shall
[1:34:37] pass you love him
[1:34:39] hallah let's pray Heavenly
[1:34:43] Father lord it's you that give sense and
[1:34:50] understanding to your word father
[1:34:54] now
[1:34:55] Lord I pray tonight Lord as we just
[1:34:58] taken just a a few moments here tonight
[1:35:01] Lord to look at this lord of the word of
[1:35:04] knowledge Lord we see it operating there
[1:35:09] among the
[1:35:11] prophets and I'm I'm thankful God you
[1:35:13] would give us an
[1:35:15] example because what you would do is you
[1:35:18] just don't leave
[1:35:19] something for us to
[1:35:21] guess but you have given such an example
[1:35:25] that Lord the way that this would be
[1:35:28] operated through the prophets it would
[1:35:32] just it would come with your desire to
[1:35:34] be that perfect within one of the nine
[1:35:38] spiritual gifts it's true Lord that
[1:35:41] within this of the nine spiritual gifts
[1:35:43] it's always got to be tested it's got to
[1:35:46] be judged it's got to be tried we can
[1:35:48] see Lord so many of the closeness Within
[1:35:51] These different things when I know no
[1:35:53] doubt the Lord as the brothers and
[1:35:55] sisters setting here right now no doubt
[1:35:56] there's things that comes back to their
[1:35:58] mind of even certain quotes that I've
[1:36:01] read them already and things that
[1:36:02] they've heard through the message where
[1:36:05] your Prophet would tell us there would
[1:36:07] come that and say tell so and so to move
[1:36:10] away from the river there's going to be
[1:36:11] a flood that's coming and this and this
[1:36:13] and this all of those who live in that
[1:36:16] Basin get away from it Lord what would
[1:36:18] that be it'd be the word of
[1:36:21] knowledge oh it be that of prophecy
[1:36:24] that's true but it would be the word of
[1:36:26] knowledge not something that would be
[1:36:29] interpreting the word but it would be
[1:36:31] like that of
[1:36:32] Elisha when the king of Syria was coming
[1:36:35] down to try to entrap Israel but father
[1:36:39] you had a man by the name of elishah
[1:36:42] that Lord that you would make yourself
[1:36:46] known to and he would be able to give
[1:36:48] them warning of what was coming Lord to
[1:36:52] me it gives us comfort
[1:36:54] it gives us Comfort to know that Lord
[1:36:56] that you are indeed God of your word
[1:36:59] you're watching over it Lord father in
[1:37:02] every one of these just like with that
[1:37:04] of the word of knowledge Lord It's that
[1:37:07] that you
[1:37:08] use in your own sovereignty Lord I pray
[1:37:12] that God that you would help us maybe
[1:37:15] here tonight Lord with just some of the
[1:37:17] examples that was mentioned here tonight
[1:37:20] father may we be able to Lord reach up
[1:37:23] to you maybe there's Lord a life a heart
[1:37:26] maybe there's a need that's here tonight
[1:37:28] that would just say Lord I'm reaching
[1:37:30] out to you Lord I I need I need help
[1:37:33] Lord I need strength Lord I I I I need
[1:37:36] leadership I need Lord I need the wisdom
[1:37:39] and knowledge of God I need your
[1:37:41] leadership Lord father maybe there lord
[1:37:44] it's in a situation that was kind of
[1:37:46] like that that Elisha experienced maybe
[1:37:49] with the widow woman Lord maybe it's
[1:37:51] like that experience Lord where they
[1:37:53] were out there in the desert without any
[1:37:55] water and become parched but father in
[1:37:58] every one of these situations we've Sal
[1:38:01] here tonight many more we could have
[1:38:03] went into Lord but with Paul through
[1:38:06] Elisha we see your love and your care
[1:38:10] father how that God that you are
[1:38:12] watching out for us as your children
[1:38:14] even Lord when we have went away
[1:38:18] sometimes Lord and went on our own
[1:38:20] thinking about things but God you and
[1:38:23] your Mercy would reach out to us Lord
[1:38:27] and father we thank you dear God for
[1:38:29] that tonight we ask that Lord for each
[1:38:31] of these needs that's been among us
[1:38:33] tonight Lord those that have been
[1:38:35] written those that are Unwritten Lord
[1:38:37] father we lift him before your throne
[1:38:39] right now Lord in prayer dear God I ask
[1:38:42] that you'll meet and minister to each
[1:38:44] one of them Lord I pray that God that
[1:38:47] father as we have looked in upon these
[1:38:49] things tonight Lord Jesus the emphasis
[1:38:54] Lord that we
[1:38:55] desire where any emphasis to be placed
[1:38:58] is upon you father Lord we thank you
[1:39:02] knowing that God you've placed these
[1:39:05] gifts in the local body like your
[1:39:08] Prophet tells us Lord that it's for one
[1:39:11] purpose the perfecting of the body of
[1:39:14] Jesus Christ Lord Jesus we want to be
[1:39:18] completely Lord under the word of God we
[1:39:21] want to just stand Lord Jesus
[1:39:24] our hearts Lord open and available to
[1:39:26] you Lord we the thing Lord what cries
[1:39:28] from our hearts Lord is Purity Lord the
[1:39:32] desire to know that God that you would

[1:40:08] Supply Lord you give Lord just exactly
[1:40:11] what we have need of it when we have
[1:40:14] need of it we've seen that with Elisha
[1:40:16] Lord he was a man that was in contact
[1:40:18] with you you told him about where the
[1:40:20] syrians were going to be but you did not
[1:40:23] tell tell him how the syrians were going
[1:40:25] to come down and try to find him and
[1:40:28] surround the city you didn't tell him
[1:40:32] that he didn't need to know that but
[1:40:35] Lord it showed when that
[1:40:39] happened he didn't fall
[1:40:42] apart Gesa did but Elisha didn't Elisha
[1:40:45] didn't say God why didn't you show me
[1:40:47] this you you've always showed me you've
[1:40:49] showed me this but Lord there's to me
