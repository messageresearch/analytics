Amen as you're turning in your Bibles tonight if you would to Psalms 32 I'd like to go back there tonight and just want to make mention to you here that we had mentioned about a fellowship after church on Sunday there at brother Richard and sister Maria's and if the weather was permitting and we just went ahead the weather just really doesn't seem to be cooperating and so we'll just postpone that off and we have some different fellowships that are actually planned out that we have set aside and some of the upcoming times so we'll get that information to you and I know brother Richard and sister Maria they had asked me just to to share that you know depending on the weather maybe in an upcoming Sunday if if it works out after everyone has eaten and things like that to be able to come over and and I know for the young people and everyone to come over for a little bit of fellowship we'll just keep you posted on that but as far as this coming Sunday that's been canceled so you just want to make you aware of that let's look here in the word of the Lord and I want to say I certainly appreciate that special tonight amen really really appreciate that amen Psalms 32 let's look at verse 7 we'll just we'll just start there tonight thou art my hiding place thou shalt preserve me from trouble thou shall compass me about with songs of deliverance Sayla look at this I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine I be not as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding whose mouths must be held in with bit and bridle lest they come near unto thee many sorrows shall be to the wicked but he that trusteth in the Lord mercy shall compass him about be glad in the Lord and rejoice you righteous and shout for joy all ye that are upright in heart amen let's continue tonight looking at that thought on looking through the prophetic limbs and just like you may God bless you as you're being seated just like you to draw your attention to back there into the verse verse eight and recognizing that the prophetic itself is never as never left and has never gone from the Church of the Living God because the promise that the Lord Jesus had made is that when he went away that he said I will send the Spirit of Truth back to you and he will lead and guide you into all truth and he'll bring to room to your remembrance the things whatsoever that I've said unto you so we we recognize that when we look here at the promise and to see that that God's faithfulness and I trust that we can look at that tonight and look into the word and you notice that in in verse eight as we were reading there this is not a maybe but it is I will I will instruct you on or the word there meaning I will cause you to act circumspectly or in wisdom to have good success I will instruct the gods not interested in failure he's not the god of failure Amen that's that's not that's not an attribute of God whatsoever and if we're born of God and attributes of God and that doesn't lay within that attribute of God and this is God's desire that that within the he will instruct us and that he would teach us in the way in which we would go and and that word I thought I was begin to look at that word teach and looking over it here within the in the Hebrew as it's mentioned it deals with directing like like a flow of water or we're in that an arrow would hit its mark God's interested in and there would be a flow and I look at that and to see what God is saying that the instruction is not something that would just remain as though a letter and it's something you can move away from but you see God instructs us in his word and we give ourselves to the instruction and the wisdom of the Lord and to realize that that real wisdom of God is not something that is it that is just confined to a letter but it is actually the very Spirit of God that when we can allow that word to have the right-of-way in our life it will produce just exactly what he said it will produce it's God's desire that the word itself would be able to flow through our lives and I think about when the word itself is flowing through our lives within the word there is not there is nothing impure but it as a matter of fact it is all purity and that word when it flows through in our lives it has the power within it to dissolve every doubt it has the power within it to cast out fear it has within it the power to stabilize and that you and I can begin to walk with even an expectation to to have something in a heart to say I'm looking for this to be fulfilled it flows through our life it's it's not just something that we hear but it's something that becomes a part of us and we become a part of it and so when we're looking at that word that I believe with all my heart that it's God's designed this words gonna hit the mark and let me just tell you something this word hitting the mark it's not left up to you and I for he and he never put any contingencies in here about you and I he said I will you see we're under his care we're under his tutorship were under his guidance he said I will instruct thee I will teach thee in the way that thou shalt go and they're wonderful to know that when you're walking in the will of God that that even if you should somewhat get out of the way that if you're walking in his will that God will bring you right back in line you know that's where the Prophet wouldn't instruct us and it said mistakes have nothing to do with it whatsoever he said as a matter of fact when you're walking in the path of duty and you said you would make a mistake he said God is obligated to bring you right back into the path of duty we could go down through the scriptures and show that of how many examples down through time of where different ones have made their mistakes but yet they but yet in the path of duty God would bring them right back in line we can look at Abraham's life and we don't even have to go any further but to see when God has made a promise it is God obligating himself to bring that word to pass hallelujah and then I look at this you know tonight as I go into that next part of it I will guide thee with mine I you know this word God here is one who is set to advise to give purpose to give counsel it's one who is ever present and this is what God is letting it be known that whether you feel me or not I'm present there to give you counsel to advise to unfold the purpose and the plan that I have laid for your life this is God's promise now I want to just just look here at a had a few of these scriptures here tonight if we could even kind of look at it there just a little bit and you think of how that you know even within in the scriptures you know in in in Psalms 25 verse 9 and 10 I know they may not have some of it up don't worry about it tonight in Psalms 25 9 and 10 the Bible says the meat he will guide in judgment and the meek will he teach his way I say God help me to be me because the meek shall inherit the earth and all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies the Bible goes on to say in Psalms 33 18 behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him and upon them that hope in his mercy in proverbs 3 verse 5 and 6 it says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding and in all that ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths glory what a what a promise that we have and you know God let it be known right here he says don't be like the horse don't be like the mule that that has to have a bribe a bit and a bridle whereby it is turned about from here and there but but rather walk and go about with a real understanding that's God's desire is that we would live and that we would go about with a real true understanding in our life and you know what understanding isn't about your mental faculties up here the real chief of it is is to understand his presence is to understand that he's the one speaking because remember your faith cannot be in your intellect your faith can not even be about what you can put together here is that God has spoken and even when you notice lack the brother man talks about the black brother we're in that he said he said to that man he said what if God told you to walk through a brick wall he said I would walk and I would be faithful to that because if God told me to do it when I got to that place that would be open for me faith is not sight faith does not need to see it as a matter of fact faith itself is a complete trust and reliance and what God has said a lot of things in itself can can happen that seem contrary but yet God is faithful now look at this you know within within the scripture I look at this things and you don't have to display a lot yet because then they'll get lost within that you don't have to do that and when I look at this within within the scripture I look back into st. John's 5 if you want to go with me to st. John 5:17 I realized that it's not there so let's just look in st. John 5:17 tonight if you just give me that scripture there that'll be fine you may have to turn with me a little bit tonight in the Bible evidently I sent him the wrong thing in st. John 5:17 look what Jesus sent here jesus answered him to send my father work as hitherto and I work therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father making himself equal with God then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now look at this channel that is opened up God God has got himself a son again are you with me just like it was there in the beginning in the garden God had a son there in the garden he was able to reveal and make things known to Adam and Adam was able to speak according to the very mind and the desire of his father and now when you look at here that God's desire this was not something that would just be confined to the Lord Jesus but it was God's desire that this would be restored and brought back - to the Church of the Living God for in that he said the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do what thing soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise so there's a channel that's open you know Jesus was not walking just by the letter but it was intact there was a channel that was open to where the word within that day that was promised within that hour of a messiah he was actually seeing it be fulfilled and there was a channel that he himself was moved in to see what the father one had done in that hour we would call that and know that to be divine revelation for the father look at this for the father loveth the son and show with him all things that himself doeth and he will show him greater works than these that ye may Marvel and that wonderful you see you have to walk in what God is showing you now you see what God is showing when we look at the will of God there are many things that are laid out within his word you think of even God's will there are many things that Paul would even talk to the church there and even in the book of Thessalonians where he would say that what is the will of God to know how to possess your vessel under sanctification and honor that was to know the will and and in order for more to be open you have to obey what God has already set forth because God's not going to add to what is not being followed but you see as we as we walk within his will his word that he opens then there's more that will unfold to us within that hour and this is exactly where the Lord Jesus I love the scrip sir in verse 30 he says I can of my own self do nothing do you realize that body itself of the Lord Jesus could absolutely do nothing it was not the man Jesus who healed anybody it was not the man who healed but it was God Himself that was dwelling behind that vessel this is where that the man who himself remember when the Lord Jesus moved and He healed his eyes and you know they're asking him you know who do you say is and and he turns to those Pharisees and he says hey but these things have never been done since the world was was begin he said it had to be that God is with him so he recognizes that it's God that has done the work oh my I can't amount cell do-nothing huh I'll tell you this right here if this is the testimony and it is and it was the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ then it is absolutely the testimony of each and every child of God I can of my own self do nothing I need him I need his strength I need him it's when we think that we can do something is when we get in trouble that's always every failure it's never been God has failed it's when we and ourselves get to relying upon our own self say lord help me not rely upon my own understanding but notice what he says here as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not mine own will but the will of the Father which has sent me if this would be applied when any thought comes to your mind or it would come to our mind there's been a lot of things we dismiss a whole lot quicker there have been a lot more things that we would not try to account as spirituality we would discount it and say that is not of God by judging is there virtue is there praise is there what is within this notice how he judged he said my judgment is just how can his judgment be just this was spoke of in the Book of Isaiah how can this be because he did not give himself to himself he gave himself to the father that dwelled within him in the message total deliverance I love the statement the Prophet makes here he said he himself was fully a man within his body but he said the inside was fully and completely God because that's the mystery God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself and the Prophet make goes on to make this statement in that same quote he said he could have been a man because he was a man but he chose to submit his outer parts to the inner of the spirit that dwelled within him and he did not walk by the outside he walked by the inside he could have been a man euros you could be a man you could be a woman you can live within a confinement to a natural realm of your first birth but when you are invited to be partakers of that new birth and you walk within that of the real born-again experience you're no longer confined to the census of this earth but you have been raised up out of those senses and you can choose to be a man you can choose to be a woman but when you are redeemed you no longer wants your own choice no longer do you want your choice anymore you want what he wants that's the real evidence of the Holy Ghost I said that's the real evidence of the Holy Ghost not if you can speak in tongues not even as the Prophet said your reaction to the spirit it's not the evidence but the real evidence is when that change has moved to the inside and Almighty God has so realigned and he has changed your very desires on the inside to where it is Christ that has been made alive to you it's so much deeper than just living a clean moral life but it actually becomes what Christ Himself is the very theme and heartbeat of your life it's more than belonging to a church it's something you realize I'm a part of him this great I nine this great eye of Jehovah Jesus was looking through this eye we talked about that the last time when Simon came up and he he could say well your name is Simon you're the son of Jews he talked about when he identified him Nathanael and the famous said when did you know me I knew you before Philip college here I saw you what was he looking through he was looking through the eye of Jehovah he was looking through this eye that were reading about tonight it was not the natural eyes of the virgin born body but there was within him he was ordained to be able to look through the eye of God glory be to God and the prophets the prophets themselves think of it the prophets that lived down through time and how they were moved in the spirit house how that Isaiah himself would be lifted up in the spirit to think of this when Isaiah prophesied that a virgin shall conceive that is against the normal thinking that had never been done there was nothing there was no scripture as far as all this had been done before there was nothing that had been based upon that but Isaiah was anointed within that he was raised up as the prophet put it like this he raised up out of his senses and when Isaiah prophesied I'll tell you when you read Isaiah 53 you don't read something that is coming in a future tense but it says it like this he was bruised he said we were healed it was already finished in the mind of God when the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world I tell you what looking through the eye of God will do it'll let you see your healing it'll let you see your deliverance it'll let you see the rapture it'll let you see yourself in Christ that's what looking through the eye of God does not through mind not through my lens you'll never see yourself through my lens I can't see myself through your lens but I must be able to and it is only by seeing ourselves for his lens hallelujah God's eye oh my it's always been with the prophets down through the ages always been there the announcement of what was coming they could see ahead of time amen what was going to happen and I think of this within the scripture you know Abraham himself you know think of that that eye of God that's the same little white light that remember when Abraham wanted to know you how is this going to be how you gonna give him how is this going to be your saying I'm gonna have an air and the air is going to come forth out of my loins tell me how this is going to happen have all my how is the air going to come from the loins into manifestation how is the air gonna come from the loins into manifestation do you realize you and I has Paul said we were in the loins of Almighty God we were in the loins of God's mind and when God Himself became flesh we were transferred to the loins of Jesus and we were there we went to Calvary in him we died in him and we roles in him and Abraham said how is this going to be how would it be it is made possible through the Passover of the Lord Jesus Christ whereby that life would come forth after the shedding of the blood to bring you and I into our land of promise what's your love him tonight remember this wasn't something where Abraham is totally out of commission it's God coming down between the sacrifices and God said I will I will it's that white life that logos that pillar fire its Christ that came down there I think of this there's such an assurance within the Covenant of God's Word I want you to look here in the Bible in John 3 and maybe I just refer to this here when Jesus come he spoke to them and he let him know that except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God except he's born again he can't see the kingdom of God now I want you to think of this here just for a moment Nicodemus you know asked him the Christian how can a man be that is born when he's old how can he enter into the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answers to him and says except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so there's an entrance into the kingdom of God as a matter of fact remember when when Jesus stood here before Pilate Pilate in them were looking to him as though that he had an earthly Kingdom he was a king but he was not a king of an earthly domain he was not the king of this world but here was the king of glory come down in such humility and what the king or the Prince of this world were Satan had taken it by deceit here was one who was standing there that was laying a claim and was going to bring back what rightfully belong to Almighty God and what belong to the sons and daughters of God he's laying claim on it and he's letting it be known this kingdom this world is not my kingdom if it was my subjects would act like this world does but my subjects is not of this kingdom he's letting it be known he is the king of a kingdom and he has some subjects and he's standing here this kingdom of God you know the kingdom of God is not something that can be explained it can't be explained you you you you you would you would run yourself in the ground trying to explain it because it can't be explained the kingdom of God is not something of natural it's the very spiritual essence of the very person of Almighty God it's God's own life his word made power there's a kingdom and you know anytime that there's a kingdom you know where a person is a part of a kingdom you know you can you can tell what kingdom they're part of you can tell maybe what part of the world they come from you know I think you know we were here in Sandusky here if just a few weeks back and I know you know times past when we would go there into Sandusky and sometimes you'd see different ones you know how they maybe looked and now they're walking around you could tell just by the way they looked and the way they're walking around you said they're not Americans you could you could look at and say that's a foreign student right there you can just tell by the way that it is and listen let me tell you something just the way that the other countries can pick you and I out and say those are Americans there's a way that we walk and we carry ourselves come on somebody you see what it is it's this this reflection of this land that we are here a land of our first birth or Nativity but yet when were born again of the Spirit of God we receive the life of that other kingdom and we have been raised up out of darkness and translated as Paul said into the kingdom of his dear son and we're no longer under the rule and the Dominion of our first birth there has been a change of administration on the very throne of our hearts aren't you glad when that's when that administration has changed there are things that maybe under the previous administration you walked according to certain laws you walked according to the Prince of power of the air but when this new administration moved in when this new king moved on the inside you are no longer confined and bound by those laws but you yourself have been made free by the very spirit of Almighty God you are free from the law of sin and death you no longer walk by that way but you walk by the spirit because one greater one greater has set you free aren't you glad there was a strong man of the house but there was a stronger one that come in whooped him come on somebody there was a strong man in your house you couldn't get rid of that strong man but a stronger one came one day a stronger one came and overthrew that strong man and now the stronger ones on the throne who glory be to God think about this - I'm except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you know you and I both know that this term of being born again it's been I'll just say it it's been belittled it's been mocked it's been the value and the virtue within the word has been read to has been reduced not by God but men have reduced it to so many things over the time and now let me say this it's not the men but it's a spirit motivating I hope you're with me now it's a spirit that's motive in because you see Satan does not walk this he wants to keep this from the children of God he wants to keep this because he knows once that comes to a reality but a real true born-again experience is a liberation and it's setting me free and then there's something that you're called to that you realize I really can be free there is a real Liberty and then you can set your eyes on that you can set your sights on that and God Himself we'll bring you into the promise by building faith within your heart Satan doesn't want that you know why because he doesn't that reality when it moves into your heart it's that and it's that greater who went on the inside he's lost his Dominion come on somebody he's lost his Dominion but if he can reduce it to just church joining if he can reduce him just to believing come on somebody you see to believe is a wonderful thing and I think you always have to start out you have to believe right there's got to be something for you to believe in and how can you believe in and if you never heard but it's got to be brought to you so you can hear it and then believe in it and then that same God you've heard you believe in now become one with him but you see you can believe in something and never or believe on it and never become a part of it are you with me you can believe on it like like as brother Brent says like this simplifies with it well I believe it's the truth like he talked about Moses he said you know when you think about Moses down there in Egypt Moses could look upon all of that all of the bondage that was there within those who were bound of Israel and he could look at and say I believe like they do I do I believe that I believe God's going to send a deliverer I sure do I believe they're God's chosen people he believed all of that but there came a day that Moses himself made a decision he had to make a decision to become identified with them you see remember there was a time there was a window that Moses and Pharaoh were looking through they looked through the same window but they didn't see the same thing come on somebody Moses looked through that window and he saw people of promise Pharaoh looked through that window and he saw nothing but a people that was outcasts he saw people that there seemed there was no hope they were nothing but slaves but you see what Moses saw it brought him to a place to make a decision to where he would absolutely forsake the very riches and the treasures of Egypt he made a decision he made a decision not just to remain a sympathizer I know I'm preaching to a limited here on the Thursday night but I know there this goes to the whole church it's more than just being a sympathizer with truth but it ought to be something that within your heart better there to be a yearning to say Lord I want to be part of that and and if you're a part of that say Lord thank you for your grace Lord for including me and putting something within my heart that it's not just about coming to church let me tell you something it's easy to serve God it's easy to serve God when you're on the mountain come on somebody you see you can do that a lot of that with human strength you feel good but what about when you don't feel good what about when it's more convenient to stay home what about when it's more convenient to take the easier way come on somebody this is what shows what is really truly real Christianity on the inside because the road itself is not going to get any easier it's gonna keep getting harder but you know what your focus has an intellect child of God is never to be on the journey your focus is to be on Him who is waiting who is calling you it's drawing you it's to focus on him and press toward the mark of the high calling be a lot of discouragements there'll be a lot of you setbacks but you know what I'm focused on that we could go around this room tonight and everybody could talk about all their disappointments and everything else but you see when you have seen the kingdom of God you recognize this is something higher than you it's something higher than your church it's something higher come on some honey it's something higher this is something deeper than just recognizing God a sin a profit it is actually coming to the realization of he who sent the prophet and he who spoke for the prophet and has called us to himself it becomes deeper than just this deeper what does that be eye of God you see its to be united in the purpose of him he's invited us think about this he's invited us to share his life you see he was ready he could not invite us to share his life until he was in position come on somebody what good would it Darrin knew a boy to go and start talking to a girl he's not positioned to bring her into his life where he's established his position he knows who he is he knows where it belongs everything is positioned who had got quiet you see this is the pattern this is the pattern this is not a worldly pattern this is a godly pattern Jesus himself established and position and then he himself invites you in to share his life and in the sharing of his life he says I've already provided for you I know you're gonna get sick but I've already healed you I know you're gonna need times in your life where maybe the mind battles will get gray but my peace shall never leave you I know there'll be times where situations will arise in your life where you feel like you're no-count you don't think you can even make another step but my grace is sufficient my grace will carry you all the way through I'll tell you the truth of the matter is when we stand there on the other side I believe we're gonna recognize more than what we're seeing it right now that it's God's grace daily its daily it's him it's him it's been him and it will be him who you this is where except a man be born again he can't see it means understand the kingdom of God you know brother Graham said I like this and Satan's Eden he talked about how he says you know he came into where a man was preaching and he said you know this man he said was was preaching an intellectual gospel he was preaching in or in a place they said after he got done he said you know they see his crowd his crowd was really refined and really learned and and all of those things and and don't get me wrong there's nothing against of education and those other things like that but remember what Paul said you see in the book of Corinthians he said brethren you can see of yourself how that there are not many high noble and wise among you that are called you know how because not very many of them will be able to release and submit themselves to the working of God's power but let me just say it to you and I who are the weak who are the poor you and ourselves cannot come to the other place to the other side of the road what I'm helpless I I can't do anything there's no way I can do it no that's that's the wrong way as well but it comes to the place to recognize I can do nothing on myself but through him I can do all things that's realizing it in the right balance the Bible like the Bible says having absolutely no confidence in the flesh brother brems said it like this he said that man you know he said he asked some people at the end who would like to receive the Lord Jesus Christ he said finally he said a woman you know raised her hand and she said I want to do it and I want to receive him and program puts it down like this he says there's a scientific knowledge where they tried to make and under standing golf spa I want you to catch what he's saying they're trying to make the gospel simple let me just preach you for a moment you can try to water it down to try to get to a place I want them to understand it I want them to understand it now let me just say like this the Bible tells in the Book of Jeremiah God spoke to the pastor's within there he said you to minister this word and giving understanding to the word that has been given I don't believe that it just remains out here in mystery where we preach things of mysteries I believe that the same Holy Ghost that reveals the mystery can bring it right down into our lives he brings it right down into our homes to where we're not just fellowshiping about mysteries but we see it and apply it in our own life you understand to where the horse riders are not just looking at first seal second seal third seal fourth seal and on out but where it comes down to operation within our lives our discernment by the Spirit of God I believe that was on the heart so then was looking at this it's not making an understanding gospel you know I'll say it like this you know brother Branham made a prayer in the opening of souls in prison now I love this prayer brother Graham said I like this he said Lord he said I prayed tonight he said that you will give understanding to each and every one that's in here understanding to those that might be more increased and then to those who may not be that far along I just happen to believe and I know that God does that come on somebody you know what I want God to find me I want God to speak to me I don't want God to speak up here if I'm not up here I want him to speak right where I'm at you with me and you know it used to be like when you're in school you know and people 100 what client want math class you in general master what general math well class you in calculus hold dear Lord what biology you in biology which one you in oh I'm in AP Oh you know it gets a little status there but I'm glad that the real ministering of the Holy Spirit you don't give no status I'm glad he's there to minister to each and every one of us let me tell you something with each and every one of us as his children it wouldn't matter if there's two or three he said I'll be right there in the midst of you I will regard your needs what it is special and I'm minister to you as though within that service you think it was tailor-made for you and the other one over here will say that was right for me what is that that is a God who invests himself to minister to our needs according to our understanding I will agree there things sometimes that God speaks that it causes us to pray that I don't see but I need to see it it's something a battle stir me up and I'll say Lord Lord God open Maha's help me to see it Lord the way that I ought to say I agree with the Lord a man to it Lord but Lord open my eyes to it Lord God and God will do that sometimes you loving so to make an understanding gospel I don't believe that the gospel is something to be made complex I don't want you to leave out it here tonight and you will Eve out here scratching him what was that about I don't know but Wow what good does it do what good does that do I'm not here to waste your time but you see I can't mic and bring it down to that place but if I can give myself to God I don't care regardless of what men think whether men think you're here or there or whatever more this is about ministering to God's people it's about ministering to needs to encourage you along the way don't you love him for that to bring understanding to us but this type of understanding the prophets talking about is a watering down we're not trying to make the gospel to where it becomes all inclusive we preach Jesus Christ and remember as many as believed he adds to the church mm-hmm this is where but the RAM will say but you know he said the man said well you believe Jesus Christ well you're saved well the same brother Ram said but he failed to tell him these signs shall follow them to believe that is the scriptural identification of a believer these signs shall follow them that believe signs of all signs of life the signs of the Messiah the signs of Christ living through your life notice the rain picks it up out of John 5 he that heareth my word he said not just makes out to hear it but with his ears understands it anybody can hear it a prostitute can hear it and remain a prostitute a drunkard can hear it a lar can hear it and remain a lot but he that understand of my word and believe on him that sent me has everlasting life there you are no man can do that except God for ordained him aren't you glad that the word passed across your way and it didn't allow you to remain new gate allows you to remain in the Commission's you were in you know why this word you were magnetized to it and the word came by your way this is the water of the word and the spirit came with the word pack in the word right across your way and what did it do it removed the amnesia from your life to where you can really look and recognize that he is the Living God and I on this song I am his daughter and when you understand that you act like a son and daughter of God that's real understanding my brother Graham talked about the young fella out on the plantation notices in John 14 oh my John 14 here remember as Jesus himself I referred to this an opening part of the service but Jesus says it like this in verse 15 if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever if you love me keep my Commandments so the words that he's expression I trust that everybody's listening to me tonight if you with in your life you are looking and you are waiting on the promised to come into fulfillment in your life this is a prescription right here if you love me if you love me keep my Commandments what he's dealt with what he spoke to you on what he's ministering to you because remember he's not someone separate from the word he is the word is that right so if falling in love with him what is it doing he's drawing you to himself in obedience and the Bible tells us that he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey Him sarahott and here that has walking look at this beautiful reality here as we are walking in step with the word various prayer that is already going up for us then that wonderful as our lives are submitting to the word the Holy Spirit in agreeance with that word the Holy Spirit is making intercession for us oh my thank God verse 17 even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive the intellectual mind scientific cannot receive it because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you so the same God that stirs up that heart stirs up that life and speaks truth to a lot it draws it to that place in submission side mine let me just go on I'm just gonna skip some of those verses brother brown made his statement just like this if I might go out or something if it did turn this on I don't know if it did or not but I just thought I would the Lord Jesus what we just read here he made he made it known that this guiding I it was not going to be gone from the church but he made known right here in this scripture we read that the church itself would have the privilege of looking through that same guiding eye that Oh God his people to all truth you could look right through the book of Acts you could look all the way through and see that it was the guiding eye you can look through each and every one of the letters that Paul had wrote to the saints of God they were all gathered now it was the same guiding eye that was guiding his children now look at this brother Graham said it like this I like this statement it just sort of just really just turned me around as I'm just meditating on it brother Graham said oh like this he said jesus said lo I'm with you always even to the end and he said we're nearing the end how many believe that the sister sung about it - not looking any moment for him we're nearing the end we realize we've arrived we've arrived there's where we're at the end time what God has promised to do in this hour he has done and he is doing is that right so here within it Jesus he said as Jesus confirmed that guiding I being with him in the days when he revealed himself to the Jews before the ending of that church age for the Jews or their dispensation you say he was the headstone is that right he was coming at the end of those of those Church ages to the Jews at the end of that dispensation is that right the Bible prophesied of that in the Book of Psalms and here that that he that would the same that was the corner he's also made the head the Bible declared in that same verse of scripture that this is the Lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes it's God's doing it's him that started to work it's him that's moved it all the way through and it's him coming to Capet it is the Lord's doing but we can have a spell just on that tonight hey man it's God who leads you and I it's God who gives you and I the faith to actually believe it's God who moves on our behalf and then he turns around and we watch him perform his word and bring it to pass in our life there's no glory we can take in it the only thing we can say it is the Lord's doing this is God's doing it's God that inspired me huh how did you know to make that step God inspired me to do it how did he inspire me to do it I don't know it was a fearless day it was contrary to my thinking are you with me faith is not important with your thinking faith overrides and is above you see that's is where faith itself is sovereignly given by Almighty God Alleluia I believe it's just like this tonight but there are things that I can stand here and testify and you could too but you would have never thought you'd have had the faith to be able to do but God has sovereignly placed that faith in your heart and you know what that is that's part of that experience in your life to let you know that no matter what comes your way no weapon formed against thee shall be able to prosper that he himself sovereignly gives that faith and the same faith that's needed that you overcome with daily is the same God that will show up and give supreme faith for the changing of your body he's the same God it's sovereignty no wonder no wonder what's that song say that's why we praise that's why we seen that's why we give him everything if you don't know what you just heard it Goro Tomita God felt like David tonight but look at this brother brems said like this at the end of that church age for the Jews he said I want you to notice he manifested it look at this now he manifested it by looking through the eye of God the Lord Jesus manifested the promises that was determined and that was set for that hour he manifested it by looking through the eye of God think about Moses now look at this just in the natural the Lord that Moses himself could look at the promises he heard him right he heard his momma talk about him he could even read over it but you see he only knew it by looking through natural eyes and hearing it through natural years but what he was seeing and what he was hearing was seeds that was been sown you see first of all God has to sow those seeds within you of truth you know that's why brother Ram is saying looking to the unseen he said where people would come and they would speak to him regarding you know the Lord he said I'll tell you what he said I read his word when I was young he said I when I read he said I read his word he said I believed that he was a living God he said in believing he said one day I met him personally what do I tell you this becomes it becomes very simple if you're seeking for the baptism of the Holy Ghost if you're seeking for God to move in your life for goodness sakes give yourself to the word and watch the Spirit of God will move down right behind it but if you desire it if you want it if there's a craving within you you'll find yourself falling in love with him and that are saying God that's drawing you will step on the scene and he'll unite with you as you're falling in love with him over and over and over Hey man he manifested that promise by looking through the eye of God I just read that out of John 5:19 the son can do nothing but what he seeth the father doing he see if it's open before him he's he's seeing it it's it's open it's an open vision before him it's something that is open to him to recognize what the will of God is I believe this with all my heart let me just pull up on this I believe this you might call me crazy but I believe you're a believer you'll see right with it I don't believe God's will is meant to be mysterious you might have to fast and you might have to pray but when you brought in one you want to know what God's will is God don't play around and he don't hold things from you the thing that what really has to be when we're praying for God's will sometimes we're so busy trying to look out here instead of really trying to see it from the eyes of our heart we're trying to look at it from the eyes oh you say well those same they're walking by sight no walking by sight it's much deeper than just you're not natural eyes it's by your feelings and by your thoughts and all those other things but remember when you're seeking for God's will according to your word remember how we are to pray that God father thou art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven that right it is submission to his will now you know and I know as believers when we've submitted to his will has his will always been comfortable and according to our liking I'm afraid to say Amen really well really is it it's always it's always according to our liking it's not what we have to go through it's the joy that we get from his will because there are things that he can lay out before us remember the cross was not joyous the Lord Jesus prayed if it's possible let this cup pass from me nevertheless not my will that will be done aren't you glad that he didn't get his will aren't you glad he surrendered his will and his will what did it do it brought redemption for you am I the surrendering of his will brought Redemption then what will be the surrendering of our will as we continue to walk with him it'll be the redemption of the body amen oh ma we are able to look through that same eye and see what it is that his desire is because his eye will reflect his will will reflect his spirit will really reflect his word but we don't have to be anxious what what do I do the Bible said be careful for nothing don't be anxious knowing that when we are heart and we've submitted to God than what God's will is for our life God will make that known I'll just say like this you're able to stand on this word it's not God's design listen if God has so clearly vindicated his word in this hour of what is the truth and God hasn't run revealed it but he's vindicated to be the truth to where that you don't have to walk around wondering are you with me you don't have to walk around wondering is this the truth you don't have to walk around wondering do I have the Holy Ghost or don't I have the Holy Ghost you don't have to walk around with that there is a vindication by the word are you with me to where you can stand in the 40 then friends if that's how it is with God's Word then how much more in our own walk with God in our own lives whether it be jobs the church we go to or wherever that how much more if the same God is so clear about his word isn't this God clear about the same little little details of our life and the church said but somehow there's a disconnect but I'll say like this it ain't on God and I'll say what rights that we have to be able to look and say God just as clear as you are in this hour as clear as everything is your will is defined right here and laid out then Lord God this is a promise for me in this hour you love them oh I'm so thankful for that let me leave you here with just one verse of scripture here and we'll just we'll close out with this here in the book of Zechariah I want you just to look at think of this verse of scripture here in the book of Zechariah it speaks of how here Zechariah is brother L referred to he read out of chapter four last week but I want to just draw your attention to verse one and the angel that talked with me came again he came again aren't you glad he comes again he don't just come on top but he keeps coming he keeps coming aren't you glad that the Holy Spirit keeps speaking aren't you glad he keeps ministering to your life being looked the angel that talked with me came again what part was that maybe I was part fifty and look what the Bible says right here and waked me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep he wasn't asleep but he needed to be woke up his eyes was wide open but he wasn't awake he was awake to everything that was around here that was going on with the rebuilding or the lack thereof but he needed to be woke up so the angel that talked with him before that same angel came to him again let me tell you something God knows your address he ain't never lost it he knows exactly where it's at your the coordinates of your house where you live it's bookmarked in his GPS whoa Cole Ravena God it's laid right out in the promise of this hour he's got a bookmark to deliver right down to your life and he woke me as a man that is awakened out of sleep God begins to speak to him he lets him see this here of the candlesticks the branch he lets him snow with what he notice what he shows him the Bible goes on to say that with just in this portion again they angel asked him what are you seeing so he's awakened he's awakened and he sees this candlestick and asks him what are you seeing in verse 4 so I answered the angel that speak to me and talked with me and I said what are these my lord what are these you see this was not look look what look what humility Zechariah was not standing there with I got to know everything I got to know this if I am called a God and really spiritual and really elect electing about knowing at all elect is about recognizing his presence who is the supreme omniscient omnipresent omnipotent one are here with me so here's a Cariah he looks upon it all he sees assembles and then he asks the question what are these oma I believe this is this is the prayer of our life Lord what you're showing me what is this sword show me how to apply it in my life show me don't just walk out of the service and say wow that was a wonderful serve no no no the Lord show me heart personally you see taking what he is speaking and you entering in and praying and the Bible says he that entereth into his / closet that he that heareth and secret cieth in secret also and he will reward thee openly glory be to God what are these my lord and then God lets it be known to Zechariah not by might not by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of Hosts not just saith the Lord but the Lord of Hosts he he who is the captain of the army that is present the host of the Lord the host that which is ready to go to warfare aren't you glad that he is standing here on your behalf you might feel like you're all alone but all if your eyes could only be open to see to recognize that the Lord Himself is here and the angels of God are present the Bible says that the angels of God are encamped about those who love him and fear his name not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord let's just stop here one who is awakened by the Lord I believe with all my heart we look at this and we see lord help me to be living faithfully in the hour of my visitation it's easy it's easy it's easy to get caught up and a lot of things of this life but remember don't let the things of this life be the ambition let him let him let him be the one and in order in this age to be able to fulfill these promises it takes the eye of God and looking through the eye of God and what understanding is opened to our lives in our hearts as we are able to look through the eye of God it's not something deep and mysterious it's something very very simple well the Lord Himself can move just as he did for Zechariah and though you might be looking at something and how many sitting around this room tonight how many things have we looked at right here within the scriptures how many things have we listened to and we have heard right in the message and then all of a sudden it's like something just opens to you you're reading it well it wasn't that you were reading in and out before but all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just wakes you up and you're looking at the same words but you don't see it the same way now he's wakened you up like a man who was sleeping and you no longer see it as just printed letter you see yourself you see him you see his will made known for your life because we know that his word is his will but when he comes on the scene then the Holy Spirit takes ahold of that word and it takes the seals off of that word and he begins to show himself there in the word and he shows you and here you are and here we are oh my goodness I I never seen that before my lord just does something to you now your might and read it and you may not have been looking at it you might be pushing your shopping cart right down the middle store and you're a meditation on what you've been reading all of a sudden the eye of God breaks for you oh my goodness I see it lo I am with you always even to the end of the world don't you love him Oh Lord Jesus let us live let us be alive unto Him the promise of this hour let's bow our heads in prayer Lord Jesus what how we thank you tonight thank you for your mercy Lord we realize your grace or the more and more that we walk every moment every day that we live we're more and more aware of the need of your grace your mercy your leadership in our lives Lord Father how we we want to step aside and we want to give that inner man the right away I pray that Lord that you wouldn't help us so many times Lord we are were encompassed about with different pressures with different needs and things that we must attend to in this life but father may we Lord God awake may we not walk Lord as a slumber or as those like Paul said that sleep in the night but we are children of the day children of the promise oh god I pray tonight Lord Jesus then you just Lord have your way tonight upon each and every one of our hearts I pray the Lord that made God from the very depths of our life may you become more and more real to us Lord Lord help us and forgive us when the things and the cares of life Lord have started to take a priority and may we Lord God walk with the right priorities Lord where it's you above everything else or god help us so lord jesus we confess that lord god of our own selves lord there are times that there are things that seem Lord so overwhelming but we refuse the Lord to walk by our feelings our sight we realize the Lord God that our feelings and our sight all of those things can lie to us but faith can never lie help us Lord operate tonight lord help each and every one Lord God as your children Lord tonight may we Lord Jesus right here tonight may there be just lord azlok an awakening that moved upon Zechariah Granite Lord we pray father we give ourselves to you and we thank you Lord for your visitation again and again Lord to speak to a slide for if it was not you coming by our way Lord and waking us up Lloyd and making us aware of the hour of the time but bringing the word Lord down personal in our lives we'd miss it they'd go out of our head how many times Lord your prophet would say Lord help help him Lord they're gonna miss it Lord they're gonna miss it then he would call that name out or they didn't realize what was being spoken was for them Lord I'm thankful tonight that here we Lord said or stand here we are we realize Lord but what's being spoken this is for us but help us lord help us that our minds we would be woke to that place to realize this is me this is me this is for me he's speaking to me grant it Lord Jesus Lord God for every need for every life tonight Lord we commit it Lord into your hands asking all these things Lord for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen you know I shared that with you last time we spoke on this when my eyes begin to get bad and in school I didn't realize it I didn't realize that was what was happening when I started asking for people's notebooks and copying down their notes I didn't realize that's why I was squinting my eyes but all of a sudden one day I begin to recognize when some of the rest of my friends begin they get glasses and they begin to get things and I thought well that's that kind of strange my parents wore glasses but then I can remember when I begin to mention something just casually in conversation to my parents I said you know sometimes it's so hard to see the blackboard when I'm writing notes and that right there they took alert to that and they said I think we need to take you to the eye doctor and you know what I told you when they took me to the eye doctor for the joy they put them contacts in my eyes and I walked out of that optometrist office or the Doug there's things I could see that I couldn't see before assault trees or things that I thought was green lumps all along the way and I could see it as they got real close I could see the golden arches and knew they were even though they were fuzzy they were far away but I didn't know the exit for him but once those those were put on my eyes everything was channeled in through that lens the light that was reflecting off of all of those objects I could see it in great distinction it's all because of a lens that was put over my eyes to where I could see things that way and you know that's the same thing that God has given us as believers that I have God to be able to see him to see things for as it is and to be able to see ourselves don't you love him Oh glory to God glory
