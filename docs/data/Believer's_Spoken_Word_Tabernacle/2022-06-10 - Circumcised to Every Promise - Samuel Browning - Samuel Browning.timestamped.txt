[32:16] when i was born again it was a bad day
[32:20] when i was born again
[32:28] hallelujah
[32:30] amen that's where that's what the real
[32:32] joy of the lord is
[32:35] amen is our
[32:37] our new birth
[32:39] to see where that he's
[32:41] he's brought us from
[32:43] amen where he's brought us from
[32:45] throughout the journey that's where we
[32:46] draw strength from
[32:48] when we're going through a test when
[32:50] we're going through a trial
[32:52] things comes up
[32:55] you know brother branham just was
[32:57] reading here
[32:59] where he's talking about the sword of
[33:00] the lord
[33:02] he said you know he says i'm not afraid
[33:04] of the sword he said because the sword
[33:07] he said is actually
[33:09] his wings
[33:11] and he said so wherever whatever comes
[33:13] up whatever is in before us he said
[33:16] the word
[33:17] will cut away through it
[33:19] for us
[33:21] and that's a confidence that we have as
[33:23] a believer see there's a
[33:26] the bible tells us
[33:29] paul picks it up in the book of
[33:30] corinthians
[33:32] david writes of it
[33:34] in the book of psalms
[33:36] i don't remember the exact chapter right
[33:37] now
[33:39] but it speaks of how that we go from
[33:41] strength unto strength
[33:45] and it isn't us getting bigger but how
[33:47] do we go from strength unto strength
[33:49] that's the same chapter where david said
[33:51] how admirable how awesome how great are
[33:54] thy tabernacles oh god
[33:57] what's his tabernacles it's not these
[33:59] buildings
[34:02] it's these tabernacles
[34:04] our lives
[34:06] lives that are dedicated
[34:08] to his presence paul said no you're not
[34:10] your body is a temple
[34:12] of the holy ghost
[34:15] we go from strength unto strength tests
[34:18] and trials and things come our way but
[34:20] he gives us strength
[34:22] job said he
[34:24] puts
[34:25] strength in us
[34:28] and the joy of the lord is our strength
[34:32] we're not drawing from an an external
[34:35] resource to find our strength to find
[34:38] our joy
[34:40] the world
[34:41] remember the world has a joy
[34:43] right
[34:45] jesus said but the joy i give to you is
[34:48] not like that joy of the world
[34:50] because the joy of the world is
[34:52] fluctuates and it's based upon worldly
[34:55] things it can have a lot of joy and
[34:58] all of these things that are here job
[35:01] money family and all those things it
[35:04] have it's have its place but there's one
[35:06] real joy that no matter what everything
[35:09] else is going from we can draw strength
[35:12] from there
[35:14] this is this is that mystery where paul
[35:17] where the scriptures would tell us
[35:20] and brother brandon would pick it up to
[35:21] conduct ourselves with joy amidst the
[35:23] trial joy doesn't mean that we're
[35:25] skipping and we're running
[35:28] it's not telling us to act and pretend
[35:31] but we draw strength from knowing
[35:34] i'm not who i used to be
[35:36] i may not be who i want to be and what i
[35:39] ought to be but i'm not who i used to be
[35:41] we're drawing strength from the joy
[35:45] of the lord
[35:48] and so when tests when trials when
[35:50] situations come up
[35:52] we are able we have an access
[35:56] because the things of this world is like
[35:59] how do i say it
[36:02] you know sometimes well i'm going to go
[36:04] you know and do this or i'll go do this
[36:06] and i'll go those things are like it's
[36:08] like hypos
[36:10] it's like
[36:10] painkillers
[36:12] the painkillers don't deal with the
[36:14] symptom
[36:15] they only mask
[36:20] but all the joy of the lord
[36:23] it gives us strength because
[36:25] he's dealt with what was the real
[36:28] true
[36:29] symptom of every cause because remember
[36:31] when sickness comes it's already been
[36:33] dealt with
[36:35] right through the atonement sin and
[36:37] sickness has already been dealt with
[36:40] everything
[36:41] and where we can draw strength
[36:44] joy from him and this is why the prophet
[36:48] could tell us
[36:49] conduct ourselves with joy amidst the
[36:52] trials that he in his infinite wisdom
[36:56] allows to come to pass
[37:01] oh my what
[37:03] what a resource that we have tonight
[37:06] what a resource in him
[37:08] and i want to just tonight before we
[37:10] open
[37:12] the word of god and
[37:14] move into
[37:16] the pages of the word i want to
[37:20] have special prayer here tonight
[37:24] i know um

[37:28] that they're having a special
[37:30] prayer service there at

[45:31] wonderful sister miranda
[45:33] praise the lord
[45:35] i tell you that that testimony
[45:38] i know that'll go far beyond just just
[45:41] here because i know there's others that
[45:43] deal with that same issue i have dealt
[45:46] with it
[45:47] i did i just well i just was rejoicing
[45:50] just to hear what god has done amen he's
[45:53] so good at me
[45:54] he met he's faithful
[45:56] amen are just so wonderful i also want
[45:59] to say
[46:00] sister linda cavilo
[46:03] my aunt
[46:06] we just received the word today you know
[46:08] she just went last friday into rehab
[46:12] so she left the hospital where she had
[46:14] been at in cleveland
[46:16] in uh
[46:17] the double lung transplant
[46:19] that took place in the middle of january
[46:22] so she left from there to go into rehab
[46:25] last week
[46:26] they've already told her
[46:29] that lord willing
[46:30] next friday she goes home
[46:34] amen
[46:35] thank you so much
[46:36] thank you
[46:38] i tell you praise god
[46:42] i tell you the lord is so good
[46:44] you know just talking to her on the
[46:46] phone even the um the other day and just
[46:48] talking and praying with her
[46:51] and uh
[46:52] just how that god has certainly just
[46:54] brought her just a great
[46:56] a great way
[46:58] and
[46:59] you know it's some of the first times i
[47:01] went up there and seen her and that's
[47:03] before they ever put the trach in her
[47:05] the
[47:06] what appeared and what was right before
[47:09] me it didn't look good
[47:12] but you know even when i stood there in
[47:14] the midst of that time i said
[47:16] but god
[47:17] you made a promise
[47:19] and i refuse to look at
[47:22] these things that i see before me
[47:25] and i and you know god was just gracious
[47:27] and stand there and just
[47:30] just speak just speak what god put on my
[47:32] heart just to direct
[47:34] her faith and the promise because
[47:36] everybody knows at times sometimes i
[47:38] mean you think she's been in there
[47:39] saying i don't mean to keep you standing
[47:41] i'm going to let you be seated here in a
[47:42] moment
[47:43] but from january
[47:45] to this time in june
[47:48] that's that's five
[47:50] months
[47:51] she's been
[47:52] in a hospital and actually only two
[47:55] weeks in this other facility
[47:57] i tell you what i mean anybody knows i
[47:59] mean to me if i'm out of my house more
[48:02] than a day i want to get back
[48:04] let alone when you're in a hospital or
[48:07] anyplace else like that
[48:09] but i tell you what you know what
[48:13] it's been the prayers
[48:15] of the saints
[48:17] every time it's come and we continue to
[48:20] pray for her god will continue to
[48:22] strengthen her because she has she has
[48:24] grown very strong and i tell you it's
[48:26] just
[48:27] it's just wonderful just to see
[48:29] everything didn't happen right all at
[48:31] once you know
[48:32] and
[48:33] and i just think that
[48:35] i tell you probably even that testimony
[48:37] and sister anna's testimony i'll
[48:39] probably end up preaching on those
[48:41] things here and when as we get further
[48:43] into the promised land on our midweek
[48:45] services
[48:46] because sometimes the way that the
[48:49] promise comes to pass
[48:50] is not necessarily the way that we want
[48:52] it
[48:53] or expect it
[48:55] i'm sure that joshua didn't expect that
[48:57] he was going to be marching around the
[48:59] wall seven times for seven days but
[49:01] that's what god had in mind
[49:04] so one thing that sure the promise is
[49:06] sure
[49:08] amen let's just read here in the word
[49:10] joshua chapter five verse one
[49:14] and it came to pass
[49:16] when all the kings of the amorites which
[49:19] were on the side of jordan westward and
[49:21] all the kings of the canaanites which
[49:23] were by the sea
[49:25] heard that the lord had dried up the
[49:27] waters of jordan from before the
[49:29] children of israel until we were passed
[49:32] over that their heart melted
[49:35] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[49:37] because of the children of israel may
[49:41] god had a blessing to the word you may
[49:43] be seated and i just
[49:45] let you be seated i'm just going to keep
[49:47] on reading
[49:48] here in the scriptures
[49:52] and we
[49:54] we we we stopped with that scripture
[49:57] last week
[49:59] and what we were looking at is being
[50:01] fully identified with the living god
[50:04] and over and over we've seen in the
[50:06] scripture even the testimony that was
[50:08] coming out of jericho
[50:10] that because of you we have heard what
[50:13] the lord has done
[50:15] the people of god were identifying
[50:18] themselves
[50:19] with what god was doing now this was
[50:22] different from where you had the spies
[50:26] that had went over in the land
[50:28] and they had been walking
[50:31] all along the bible says there was a
[50:33] mixed multitude that came out of egypt
[50:37] the bible tells us that as paul would
[50:39] place it that all
[50:42] walked under the cloud
[50:44] all were baptized
[50:46] uh unto moses all came through the red
[50:48] sea all of these all of these parts as
[50:51] they were all walking all drank from the
[50:54] water from the rock
[50:56] but yet all of those parts
[50:59] were meant to be
[51:01] encouragements to build their faith
[51:05] for them to cross into their
[51:09] promise
[51:10] see everything that god does even within
[51:13] a service
[51:14] and as what god has done in this
[51:15] generation
[51:17] is it is done
[51:19] that it might become personal to our
[51:22] lives
[51:24] now
[51:24] if a life refuses to identify themselves
[51:28] with god well they're not going to get
[51:30] anywhere with god
[51:32] but in order to get anywhere with god
[51:34] you have to identify with him
[51:36] and to identify with him it means to
[51:39] obey him
[51:40] believe him
[51:42] walk in the light as he's in light as he
[51:45] is moving and dealing with our life we
[51:48] walk in that word that's identifying
[51:51] with with the word it's just like the
[51:53] holy spirit can come and as he does come
[51:56] into service and there's things that he
[51:58] can deal with in our life the flesh
[52:00] might want to pull back but this is
[52:02] where we need to let the inner man have
[52:05] the right of way
[52:06] and this is where we say amen to the
[52:10] word
[52:10] that means so be it we're identifying
[52:13] the word
[52:15] then the word itself will come and
[52:17] identify us
[52:19] so you know when the disciples they
[52:22] identified with the word the word was
[52:24] dealing with their life it was drawing
[52:27] them and as we were looking at that last
[52:29] week
[52:30] but yet they were not fully identified
[52:34] with the living god until the living god
[52:37] came
[52:38] and
[52:39] and dwelt inside of their lives and that
[52:43] happened at the day of pentecost when
[52:45] god imparted his life to them
[52:49] so you see we want to be identified when
[52:51] the word is coming forth we want to say
[52:53] man to the word not just not just as a
[52:55] routine but we're taking hold of that
[52:57] word and saying so be it to my life lord
[53:01] and praying over that word is that words
[53:03] coming forth in our life we want to pray
[53:05] as brother bannon put it very clearly in
[53:07] the message mighty god unveiled before
[53:09] us he said we must seek until that word
[53:13] is made real to us
[53:17] we're not seeking after uh
[53:20] something i'll hear a fathom we are
[53:22] seeking after the living god who is
[53:25] touching our life dealing with our life
[53:27] we're identifying with him and we're
[53:30] desiring that god will come and let that
[53:34] word be identified in and through our
[53:37] lives and then that's where
[53:40] god said they shall see that thou art
[53:44] called by the name of the lord
[53:47] because we can wear shirts that say the
[53:49] name of jesus christ and yet
[53:52] underneath that when it says name of
[53:54] jesus christ it could be every kind of
[53:56] life that you know swearing and walking
[53:59] in the world and doing everything else
[54:01] everything contrary so it's not just
[54:03] coming under or having a name on a shirt
[54:06] or saying that i'm a christian but we
[54:08] want with our profession we want a life
[54:11] that's behind that and that's where the
[54:13] holy spirit would speak and says let
[54:15] them that name the name of christ depart
[54:18] from iniquity if you are identifying
[54:21] yourself as a christian you also have
[54:23] authority to resist the enemy
[54:27] right you you are able to draw strength
[54:29] so don't let the enemy
[54:32] tell you that there is no strength
[54:34] available but there is strength there
[54:36] was strength available that came to you
[54:38] and i to repent of our sins do you
[54:40] realize when a person repents of their
[54:42] sins that there can still be everything
[54:46] in them that made them sin in the first
[54:48] place
[54:49] is that right if they were a smoker
[54:51] before they can still have that nicotine
[54:54] spirit on the inside but down deep there
[54:57] is a child of god that's desiring to
[55:01] identify with the word and say lord
[55:04] forgive me and they repent and now what
[55:07] is it doing they're receiving strength
[55:10] to repent and god continues to release
[55:13] strength as we walk in the word and the
[55:16] word comes and says get this out of your
[55:19] life take this out of your life and it's
[55:21] not us taking it out of our life but
[55:23] it's us saying amen to the word of god
[55:27] and saying lord
[55:28] let it pass out of my life i don't want
[55:31] that in my life what's happening we're
[55:34] receiving strength to look unto him and
[55:37] from there there comes strength then
[55:40] when that source of strength we've we've
[55:42] been receiving strength from comes to
[55:45] live inside of us and we can say like
[55:47] david the lord is the strength
[55:50] of my life
[55:53] oh glory be to god so we're not on a
[55:55] picnic we're on a battlefield
[55:58] so israel here in verse 1 as we were
[56:00] looking at that last week
[56:02] israel was in a place of of where they
[56:06] were uh identifying
[56:09] with
[56:10] with god and they were walking unlike
[56:13] the spies before them or the other the
[56:16] others that had come out that went over
[56:17] in the land and said we can't do it we
[56:20] can't take it but there joshua and caleb
[56:23] they were identified with the word
[56:26] they might have had to wait 40 years
[56:29] because remember what god spoke
[56:31] but that didn't diminish what god said
[56:35] when god told caleb
[56:37] through the prophet where your feet have
[56:39] trod in this ground i've given that land
[56:42] to you he might have had to wait there
[56:45] for 40 years but there's one thing about
[56:48] it during that time caleb was making
[56:51] ready
[56:53] no doubt maybe you could have passed by
[56:55] his tent you would have heard
[56:58] what are you doing i'm getting ready to
[57:00] take some giant's heads off
[57:04] he was sharpening the cutlery
[57:07] come on friends he was sharpening his
[57:10] sword he that promise was there it was
[57:12] certain to him
[57:15] he was identifying with the word and
[57:17] remember god said because joshua and
[57:21] caleb have identified themselves with me
[57:25] then god pulls back and says caleb had
[57:29] another spirit in him because he hath
[57:32] followed me fully
[57:36] following the lord a man to the word of
[57:38] god so be it and give ourselves to the
[57:41] word until that word itself is
[57:44] identified through our lives
[57:46] so i want to as we were looking at that
[57:49] it's a time of identification this is an
[57:51] hour a season of identification it's a
[57:55] time in an hour for the sons and
[57:57] daughters of god who are coming to full
[58:00] maturity coming to adoption to a
[58:03] position to a placement of what god
[58:06] started back there on the day of
[58:08] pentecost now coming into a place of
[58:11] adoption because it's time for rapture
[58:15] it's time and preparation for the
[58:18] wedding supper for the millennium and
[58:20] then into the future hope this is the
[58:23] hour of the manifestation of the sons of
[58:26] god we're not going to be sons and
[58:28] daughters of god oh when i get to the
[58:30] millennium you won't need it then right
[58:33] now is when we need it right now is
[58:36] where we need the holy ghost right now
[58:39] is where we need the grace of god right
[58:41] now is where sons and daughters of god
[58:44] become manifest in this hour under the
[58:48] very presence of almighty god this
[58:51] message in this hour brings us into our
[58:54] sonship
[58:59] so
[59:01] you know a time of identification
[59:05] this is the hour
[59:07] of being where god is fully identifying
[59:12] his people so i want to go now to the
[59:14] next few verses here
[59:17] in joshua 5 2
[59:19] at that time
[59:21] the lord said unto joshua
[59:24] make thee sharp knives
[59:27] and circumcise again the children of
[59:30] israel the second time
[59:34] joshua made him sharp knives and
[59:36] circumcised the children of israel at
[59:38] the hill of the foreskins
[59:40] and this is the cause
[59:42] why joshua did
[59:45] circumcise
[59:47] all the people that came out of egypt
[59:49] that were males even all the men of war
[59:51] died in the wilderness by the way after
[59:53] they came out of egypt now all the
[59:55] people that came out were circumcised so
[59:58] when they left egypt all were
[1:00:00] circumcised
[1:00:01] right that the man must be circumcised
[1:00:05] right
[1:00:06] when they left egypt they were
[1:00:08] circumcised
[1:00:10] but all the people that were born in the
[1:00:13] wilderness by the way as they came forth
[1:00:15] out of egypt them had not been
[1:00:17] circumcised for the children of israel
[1:00:20] walked 40 years in the wilderness to all
[1:00:22] the people that were men of war which
[1:00:25] came out of egypt were consumed because
[1:00:27] they obeyed not the voice of the lord
[1:00:32] unto whom the lord swear that they would
[1:00:34] not show the land which the lord swear
[1:00:36] unto their fathers that he would give us
[1:00:38] a land flowing with milk and honey and
[1:00:41] their children
[1:00:43] whom he raised up in their stead
[1:00:45] them
[1:00:46] joshua circumcised
[1:00:49] for they were uncircumcised because they
[1:00:51] had not been circumcised by the way
[1:00:55] now the bible says
[1:00:57] in verse 9 let me just skip to that one
[1:01:00] and the lord said unto joshua so after
[1:01:02] the circumcision has taken place here at
[1:01:05] gilgal this day
[1:01:07] have i
[1:01:08] ruled away the reproach of egypt from
[1:01:11] off of you
[1:01:13] i may not be able to get to this here
[1:01:14] tonight but i want you to notice he said
[1:01:16] to joshua make these sharp knives and
[1:01:19] circumcise them and after it's all said
[1:01:21] and done god is identifying it that it
[1:01:24] is i that have circumcised you it is i
[1:01:29] that have removed the reproach of egypt
[1:01:32] from off your life it shows what a
[1:01:35] precious thing it is when the word has
[1:01:37] been delivered and the word has been
[1:01:39] received then that word is handled with
[1:01:42] the hand of faith it is not the man
[1:01:44] doing it it's god behind the man doing
[1:01:48] it
[1:01:51] gilgal is a special place
[1:01:54] this is where they're at they've just
[1:01:56] crossed the river jordan it's a it's a
[1:01:59] special place it's a starting point
[1:02:03] every
[1:02:04] every
[1:02:05] christian
[1:02:06] must have a gilgam
[1:02:10] hallelujah
[1:02:12] must have a gilgal the gilgal is not
[1:02:15] just when we've given our hearts to the
[1:02:16] lord remember where they're at they've
[1:02:18] been identifying themselves with the
[1:02:21] living god
[1:02:22] and and and testimonies are being
[1:02:25] witnessed how god is opening the way
[1:02:28] taking down kings and taking down now
[1:02:30] look think of this
[1:02:31] god has taken down kings that were
[1:02:35] rulers and spiritual powers
[1:02:39] he has removed things from their life
[1:02:42] that they could have never removed
[1:02:45] how did that get removed from their life
[1:02:48] because they identified with the word
[1:02:51] when the word said go take bashan they
[1:02:54] moved with that word under the ministry
[1:02:57] of the prophet moses and as they moved
[1:03:00] with that word it was building faith in
[1:03:03] their life to cross the jordan and to
[1:03:05] come to this moment right here
[1:03:10] so
[1:03:11] they come to a gilgam they've crossed
[1:03:13] jordan but now there's got to be a a
[1:03:16] starting point
[1:03:18] brother brown how many times you would
[1:03:20] hear where brother brown said you've
[1:03:22] always wanted a place
[1:03:24] to set your foot right in the right in
[1:03:26] discernment a place where you could set
[1:03:28] your foot and start from and he would
[1:03:31] say
[1:03:32] tonight is your night
[1:03:34] he wasn't it wasn't mincing words
[1:03:38] it spoke to many that there's things he
[1:03:40] said that even i just was reading last
[1:03:42] weekend there are things of how god had
[1:03:44] dealt with an individual's life about a
[1:03:46] spiritual calling and brother brahm says
[1:03:49] yet you've never been able to receive
[1:03:51] that calling because you've never been
[1:03:53] spiritual enough to receive it he said
[1:03:55] what you're standing here for and you
[1:03:57] need is the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:04:01] because it's the holy spirit that puts
[1:04:04] confidence in our life and confidence is
[1:04:07] faith
[1:04:09] are you hearing me
[1:04:11] that's why staying in the presence of
[1:04:13] god to a believer that's why we must
[1:04:15] stay in the presence of almighty god
[1:04:18] when a person says well i'm getting weak
[1:04:20] the first question is if you're weak
[1:04:23] have you been in god's presence well i
[1:04:26] don't feel like praying well usually
[1:04:28] there's going to be many times our flesh
[1:04:30] does not and there's going to be as far
[1:04:32] as all of our mistakes our failures and
[1:04:35] you know i i should have done this and i
[1:04:37] didn't do this i didn't do that there's
[1:04:38] got to come a moment where you persevere
[1:04:42] beyond your feelings because your
[1:04:44] feelings will try to keep you out of the
[1:04:47] presence of god but that's where you and
[1:04:50] i must abide is in his presence because
[1:04:54] the the aaron's rod did not blossom and
[1:04:58] bloom and produce it out here in the
[1:05:00] outer court or even when it got close
[1:05:03] there in the inner court it had to go
[1:05:05] all the way and let me tell you
[1:05:06] something friends that's why every day
[1:05:09] of our life it is to be occupied in the
[1:05:12] holiest of holies we are changed from
[1:05:15] glory unto glory
[1:05:19] if we can be honest and really look in
[1:05:21] the mirror of the word the reason we're
[1:05:23] not advanced like we should is because
[1:05:25] we
[1:05:26] are not spending time in his presence
[1:05:28] like we ought to
[1:05:32] there's a lot of a lot of a lot of
[1:05:33] extraneous things that could try to come
[1:05:35] to take us away from his presence even
[1:05:38] things that we can say this is
[1:05:41] legitimate this is legitimate that's
[1:05:43] legitimate this is legitimate but it has
[1:05:45] to come down to where you take all
[1:05:47] things that are legitimate and say this
[1:05:49] is a legitimate reason this is a
[1:05:51] legitimate but you have to come to a
[1:05:53] place to where you recognize that all of
[1:05:56] these things here
[1:05:57] they cannot come before
[1:06:00] the presence of god
[1:06:02] because when you
[1:06:03] have your life before god's presence
[1:06:06] then all of these other things god
[1:06:08] orders it and directs you as it ought to
[1:06:12] be directed and those things do not
[1:06:14] become the focus of life but christ is
[1:06:16] the focus and he directs you through all
[1:06:18] those things
[1:06:20] gilga is a starting point in each of our
[1:06:23] lives and when when elijah
[1:06:25] with elisha it was a gilgam he received
[1:06:29] a double portion of the spirit
[1:06:32] and you see that gilgal itself is always
[1:06:35] a testimony of what god did one time
[1:06:40] he'll do again
[1:06:42] remember this was a moment
[1:06:45] that it was spoken when your children
[1:06:47] begin to say
[1:06:49] what mean these stones
[1:06:51] what does this mean so it's if there's a
[1:06:53] testimony whatever god did once he'll do
[1:06:56] the same again
[1:06:58] so this circumcision when we speak of
[1:07:00] this the circumcision
[1:07:02] i want to just say it this way it is the
[1:07:04] sign
[1:07:06] of the covenant that god made with
[1:07:08] abraham
[1:07:10] and through this circumcision
[1:07:13] they now
[1:07:14] were going to have a direct connection
[1:07:17] with the living god
[1:07:19] remember all this was a type of where
[1:07:21] you and i
[1:07:22] are at by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:07:25] so no longer were they just going to be
[1:07:27] identifying with it but now god himself
[1:07:31] was out of place just in now their faith
[1:07:33] i hope you understand what i'm going to
[1:07:35] say
[1:07:35] circumcision is god recognizing your
[1:07:39] faith recognizing i'm my faith
[1:07:42] circumcision is a type of the baptism of
[1:07:45] the holy ghost the new birth it's god
[1:07:48] recognizing our faith
[1:07:51] so what do what what is the seal the
[1:07:53] seal itself is the holy spirit the seal
[1:07:56] signifies ownership the seal signifies
[1:07:59] this belongs to me when god seals god is
[1:08:03] sealing a life that now reflects his
[1:08:06] mind
[1:08:08] a life that is followed walking in the
[1:08:12] scriptural pattern of his word like he
[1:08:15] gave to moses do this do that building
[1:08:18] the tabernacle and then when the
[1:08:20] tabernacle would come to completion then
[1:08:23] the presence of god would come down and
[1:08:26] god's presence coming down was a witness
[1:08:29] what i spoke to him in the cloud and he
[1:08:32] delivered it was from me and i'm here
[1:08:35] vindicating
[1:08:36] it oh brother sister not only did god
[1:08:40] vindicate this message night after night
[1:08:43] after night i'm my life is a vindication
[1:08:46] of this message
[1:08:48] your life's a vindication of this
[1:08:50] message a man's word won't act like this
[1:08:57] hallelujah
[1:08:58] so it's coming into a direct connection
[1:09:01] with the living god
[1:09:03] and god making a way for him
[1:09:05] now i want you to think about this
[1:09:09] in this circumcision here at gilgal i
[1:09:12] want to pick up on this
[1:09:14] out of the end time evangelism i don't
[1:09:16] have it posted there i just want you
[1:09:18] just to go with me
[1:09:20] brother brown would speak about how
[1:09:23] that so much
[1:09:25] where it spoke of
[1:09:27] there's so many decisions that's been
[1:09:29] made if you made a decision for christ
[1:09:31] now everybody has to make a decision
[1:09:33] right you are all forced to make a
[1:09:35] decision
[1:09:37] everybody
[1:09:38] but to recognize that from that decision
[1:09:42] then that's a confession that's a stone
[1:09:46] but there's got to be a cutting of that
[1:09:49] stone
[1:09:50] and the cutting of that stone is
[1:09:52] removing everything
[1:09:55] that is not what god had in his mind
[1:09:58] let me just say it this way you and i
[1:10:01] create our family albums
[1:10:03] as our children are born and as they
[1:10:05] grow we put all the pictures and things
[1:10:07] in there and now you can look back
[1:10:09] through their pictures and look back
[1:10:11] when they were younger and say
[1:10:12] i seen that there oh i see that there oh
[1:10:15] i see that there if you've got videos of
[1:10:17] him
[1:10:17] i seen that action back there now you
[1:10:19] see it back there
[1:10:21] but god
[1:10:23] before the foundation of the world he
[1:10:25] already had his family album created
[1:10:30] it was already created god already
[1:10:32] snapped a picture
[1:10:35] and not a picture when we in fallen
[1:10:37] bodies
[1:10:40] are you hearing me now
[1:10:41] but god he took a picture of the
[1:10:44] positive
[1:10:46] not of the negative
[1:10:49] are you with me the negative is what
[1:10:51] gets developed to match the positive
[1:10:54] god snapped a picture before the
[1:10:57] foundation of the world that's why job
[1:11:00] there he could say where was you
[1:11:03] before the foundation of the world when
[1:11:05] when the morning stars sang for joy
[1:11:10] who are those morning stars sons and
[1:11:13] daughters of god
[1:11:15] that we're doing what rejoicing in our
[1:11:19] salvation through the blood of the lamb
[1:11:25] that's something to shout about
[1:11:27] he made a way for me
[1:11:30] before i even knew i needed a way before
[1:11:33] you knew you needed a way he already
[1:11:36] made a way and decided in this
[1:11:39] generation he would reveal himself to
[1:11:43] you and i that i'm your waymaker i am
[1:11:47] your way
[1:11:48] [Applause]
[1:11:49] glory be to god
[1:11:51] so god calls that life by his word
[1:11:55] if the word is is being spoken and he's
[1:11:59] calling
[1:12:00] and he's speaking to that life
[1:12:03] there's decisions that are made
[1:12:05] but you see god don't want
[1:12:08] just a pile of rocks
[1:12:10] because they just become a pile but god
[1:12:13] has intended and ordained and purposed
[1:12:17] that our lives would be a living
[1:12:21] memorial
[1:12:22] a living witness
[1:12:24] that our lives would be dedicated to his
[1:12:27] presence
[1:12:28] that it would be god walking inside of
[1:12:32] our lives when we go whether to the
[1:12:34] factory or or the sister making biscuits
[1:12:37] at home it's god behind flesh it's god
[1:12:40] behind the skin let me tell you
[1:12:41] something this message is more than
[1:12:44] books and tapes
[1:12:46] it's more than just gods and a prophet
[1:12:49] it's to recognize it was god through the
[1:12:52] ministry of malachi 4 declaring his
[1:12:55] pathway his purpose that he desired to
[1:12:59] take on flesh in his body of believers
[1:13:03] and bring you an eye a real living
[1:13:06] experience
[1:13:10] and i'm saying like this god has stone
[1:13:13] masons and he he alone
[1:13:16] is the true stonemason
[1:13:20] because god does not want a pile of
[1:13:22] rocks
[1:13:23] right
[1:13:24] i mean you know how it is i mean there's
[1:13:26] things that i got out behind my shed
[1:13:28] i've got these stones out there that my
[1:13:31] parents had them at their house when
[1:13:32] they moved i took them said well i put
[1:13:34] them out behind my shed when i moved you
[1:13:36] know from i put them out there and you
[1:13:38] know what i've had to pick all they do
[1:13:40] is sit there i've had to pick them up
[1:13:43] and put them here and sometimes i get an
[1:13:45] idea oh maybe it would go good here and
[1:13:47] they're just you know simple little
[1:13:48] patio stones and you're really trying to
[1:13:50] figure out what in the world to do with
[1:13:52] them they're just sometimes they're all
[1:13:54] stacked up when i started planting
[1:13:55] tomato plants and things like that but
[1:13:57] you got to pack them around but you see
[1:13:59] god's desire is not to pack around
[1:14:02] stones
[1:14:04] because every one of us
[1:14:06] where we live in the communities we live
[1:14:08] the places we work and in our homes god
[1:14:11] doesn't want a pile here but god wants
[1:14:14] to so live inside of our lives he
[1:14:17] doesn't remove the reality that we're a
[1:14:19] stone he wants us to be a lively stone
[1:14:24] that just as the people were positioned
[1:14:27] in the land by divine inspiration god by
[1:14:30] divine inspiration wants to hew out his
[1:14:34] children cut away everything that is of
[1:14:37] the world everything that's unlike him
[1:14:39] that's what he does
[1:14:41] as a true stonemason
[1:14:43] and he comes right through the word
[1:14:46] godly god uses his vessels
[1:14:50] is that right god uses men god uses he
[1:14:53] uses his word but it's not the man
[1:14:56] because the man many times there's
[1:14:59] things that that man doesn't necessarily
[1:15:01] want to say
[1:15:03] there's things that he don't necessarily
[1:15:05] want to preach
[1:15:08] right sometimes it's a little bit easier
[1:15:10] when you go in somewhere and you don't
[1:15:11] know nobody than if you're at home and
[1:15:13] you know and you know everybody but
[1:15:15] regardless it's got to come by the
[1:15:17] inspiration of the holy spirit because
[1:15:19] let me tell you something we need
[1:15:21] liberty completely in our lives in order
[1:15:24] to obtain every promise of god there's
[1:15:27] got to be complete liberty in our lives
[1:15:30] and there won't be a church program
[1:15:32] bring it there won't be a soup supper
[1:15:34] bring it the only thing that brings real
[1:15:36] liberty is the cutting of the word of
[1:15:39] god as it comes to cut us free because
[1:15:43] the very thing that can be present in
[1:15:45] your life is the very thing that's
[1:15:48] holding you back from more of god
[1:15:52] and god coming to say
[1:15:55] let's move this out of the way
[1:15:57] oh i want it all out of the way don't
[1:15:59] you
[1:16:01] you know to be able to where god will
[1:16:02] come in and speak to our lives to quit
[1:16:05] this and quit that and what's acceptable
[1:16:08] it isn't that god making a do and don'ts
[1:16:10] list
[1:16:13] but i'll tell you what real grace is not
[1:16:15] disgrace
[1:16:18] the grace of god will come and bring
[1:16:20] correction to our lives the holy spirit
[1:16:23] is still a discerner he's still present
[1:16:27] to take stones instead of them being
[1:16:29] piled up and you got to pack them in and
[1:16:31] pack them out and pack them in and pack
[1:16:33] them out
[1:16:34] god don't want it piled up he wants
[1:16:36] lives that are on fire and pulsating
[1:16:39] with his life you say that's only for
[1:16:41] the pastor the preacher i don't know
[1:16:43] what kind of bible you've been reading
[1:16:45] out of but god has ordained for every
[1:16:48] one of us to be on fire with the holy
[1:16:51] ghost i just heard the prophet say this
[1:16:53] morning in the holy ghost series he said
[1:16:56] what the spirit of god did in the body
[1:16:59] of jesus christ it does the same thing
[1:17:02] in the body of the believer what the
[1:17:05] holy spirit has done in one person's
[1:17:07] life he won't act no different in
[1:17:10] another person's life
[1:17:16] this is what the prophet called end-time
[1:17:20] evangelism
[1:17:22] because it's evangelizing
[1:17:25] but it's in time in time
[1:17:28] evangelism is malachi 4 time
[1:17:32] when god said behold i send you elijah
[1:17:35] the prophet
[1:17:36] the coming of elijah the prophet
[1:17:38] remember
[1:17:39] he's coming with a direct word from god
[1:17:43] when elijah stood there that day and
[1:17:44] said i've done all this at thy command
[1:17:48] that ministry is a ministry that god has
[1:17:51] set to dissolve
[1:17:53] doubts
[1:17:55] where people are held between two
[1:17:56] opinions
[1:17:59] let me just address some of those
[1:18:01] opinions
[1:18:02] am i believer or was i just been around
[1:18:05] this for a long time let me tell you
[1:18:06] something you could not hunger and
[1:18:09] thirst for god if god didn't put that in
[1:18:11] you he didn't put that in you in a
[1:18:13] service here it was always in you and
[1:18:17] like somebody gets in the presence of a
[1:18:19] magnet that magnet begins to reveal
[1:18:22] there are properties there that are
[1:18:24] magnetized to this magnet and the great
[1:18:28] magnet of the holy ghost moving down
[1:18:30] through his word in a service what is it
[1:18:33] it draws upon that which is magnetized
[1:18:36] to it it might be bolted down now but
[1:18:39] there is liberating power to remove
[1:18:42] anything that'll hold you back
[1:18:51] if i send somebody to your house
[1:18:54] come on friends the bible said a good
[1:18:56] name is rather to be had than great
[1:18:57] riches
[1:19:00] you know how it is you find somebody's
[1:19:01] name and you want to say
[1:19:03] i knew somebody else by that first name
[1:19:04] what's their last name
[1:19:07] because it might been a thief robber
[1:19:09] crook
[1:19:10] come on now
[1:19:14] why in the world
[1:19:16] would we listen to the devil
[1:19:21] well the devil's telling me that because
[1:19:22] god let me tell you something god ain't
[1:19:24] never told nobody the promise ain't for
[1:19:26] you
[1:19:29] no sir
[1:19:31] matter of fact jesus said i will in no
[1:19:33] wise cast
[1:19:34] out you know what jesus said if you
[1:19:37] leave it's because you leave
[1:19:39] i ain't throwing you out
[1:19:42] sure
[1:19:43] you say what are you saying i'm telling
[1:19:45] you it's time to stop listening to a
[1:19:47] liar
[1:19:49] it's time to call the devil alive oh
[1:19:51] brother samuel he's back me down in the
[1:19:53] corner it's time to take the word and
[1:19:56] say boo back brother brandon told about
[1:19:58] a man he said the devil kept on coming
[1:20:01] at him he said that man took the bible
[1:20:03] and he said he started to realize he
[1:20:05] started taking the bible and just
[1:20:07] swinging it right there at the devil he
[1:20:09] said the devil kept coming and wanting
[1:20:11] to say it's not for you the days of
[1:20:13] miracles has passed he said but that man
[1:20:15] stood there and said but jesus christ is
[1:20:18] the same yesterday there forever he said
[1:20:20] i found out when i did that it backed
[1:20:23] the devil up he didn't get bigger he got
[1:20:26] he got smaller who's getting stronger
[1:20:28] you're getting stronger because you're
[1:20:30] tapped in to the source
[1:20:33] of almighty god
[1:20:37] oh hallelujah
[1:20:39] there's got to be a stonemason there
[1:20:41] that will shape our lives up
[1:20:43] call sin sin
[1:20:46] is that right it ain't to be
[1:20:48] disagreeable
[1:20:49] but it's to recognize
[1:20:51] that that god himself he makes a way
[1:20:54] that he himself might come and set down
[1:20:57] in that life that's what the sword of
[1:20:59] the lord is doing it's cutting away
[1:21:01] everything that is unlike him
[1:21:05] because you see jesus once
[1:21:07] wants character
[1:21:10] now the bible tells us in hebrews 4 12
[1:21:15] let me just try to get to a spot here
[1:21:16] tonight
[1:21:19] for the word of god
[1:21:22] is quick that means alive
[1:21:25] and it's powerful
[1:21:29] don't misunderstand me
[1:21:31] you know i believe in laying on hands
[1:21:33] i believe in prayer lines i believe in
[1:21:35] altar calls i believe in all that
[1:21:38] but i also believe
[1:21:40] that while peter yet spake these words
[1:21:41] the holy ghost fell on
[1:21:44] i i don't just believe that i am a
[1:21:47] witness that the word is powerful
[1:21:54] the word is powerful
[1:21:58] and sharper
[1:22:00] than any two-headed sword
[1:22:04] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[1:22:07] soul
[1:22:08] and spirit and of the joints and moral
[1:22:12] he gets right down into the nitty-gritty
[1:22:17] and is a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:22:19] intents of the heart now
[1:22:21] paul's not writing about a letter
[1:22:24] just a letter
[1:22:26] words wrote on the page although
[1:22:28] although being in contact with god
[1:22:31] you can be reading the bible
[1:22:33] you can be reading the message
[1:22:35] i'm talking about reading
[1:22:37] being in contact with god
[1:22:39] and it appears
[1:22:42] because you know what makes a difference
[1:22:44] you're in contact with god
[1:22:46] so when you're reading it you're not
[1:22:48] reading it as some foreigner you're
[1:22:50] reading it as one who is active in the
[1:22:53] covenant
[1:22:56] are you hearing me so you're not just
[1:22:58] waiting well i'm going to wait till i
[1:22:59] come to church that's when the word of
[1:23:01] god is alive no it is alive here but
[1:23:03] every day in your life let me say this
[1:23:05] to you it's not something outside of you
[1:23:08] the word of god is jesus christ himself
[1:23:14] what is the holy ghost the holy ghost is
[1:23:17] god revealed through christ in christ
[1:23:22] and now in the life of the believer the
[1:23:24] holy ghost and god are not separate
[1:23:27] people
[1:23:28] come on now
[1:23:30] that that mystery has been restored in
[1:23:33] this hour
[1:23:35] that it's not three persons it's the
[1:23:38] same god that was above us with us now
[1:23:41] in us
[1:23:42] so think of it the same word of god that
[1:23:46] brings discernment and that pierces down
[1:23:48] in our life that same word of god as we
[1:23:51] allow it to have preeminence now is a
[1:23:54] discerner through our lives
[1:24:00] giving us leadership and direction
[1:24:04] and you see that's that's what the stone
[1:24:06] cutter uses
[1:24:08] that's why when you come in
[1:24:10] we come and we sit down here
[1:24:12] we're coming to hear from god
[1:24:14] we come to say god if there's anything
[1:24:17] that's unlike you cut it away lord
[1:24:22] i'm not gonna make no excuses for it
[1:24:25] my flesh might get pinched a little bit
[1:24:27] but lord i don't want nothing holding me
[1:24:30] back
[1:24:34] it it cuts it it cuts off the surplus
[1:24:37] now remember i'm just laying this in
[1:24:39] here and lord willing we'll pick it up
[1:24:41] here next week but remember the
[1:24:42] scripture tells us in revelations one
[1:24:44] when when john would turn to see
[1:24:48] uh uh uh the voice that spake to me so
[1:24:51] the voice is speaking to him and now
[1:24:53] he's turned to see it and what john
[1:24:56] turns to sea
[1:24:58] he sees one
[1:24:59] walking in the midst of seven golden
[1:25:02] candlesticks
[1:25:03] one like unto the son of man in other
[1:25:06] words it's the same god now veiled in
[1:25:11] his body of believers his church
[1:25:14] right remember when when paul when he
[1:25:16] met paul on the road to damascus he said
[1:25:19] why do you persecute
[1:25:21] me
[1:25:22] and paul said who are you he said i'm
[1:25:25] jesus
[1:25:26] now paul wasn't persecuting the literal
[1:25:29] body of jesus but he was persecuting the
[1:25:32] body of jesus christ because it was the
[1:25:35] same jesus the same holy ghost now
[1:25:38] dwelling in a mini-membered body
[1:25:42] is that right
[1:25:44] and notice the characteristic
[1:25:47] of his seven-fold characteristic in the
[1:25:50] book of revelations and it speaks of the
[1:25:52] seven stars in his right hand seven
[1:25:54] messengers what is a star reflects light
[1:25:57] there's got to be the source of light
[1:26:00] it's coming from
[1:26:02] hallelujah what are they doing just
[1:26:03] reflecting that light so that we that
[1:26:06] are in darkness can find our way from
[1:26:10] darkness to light because the bible said
[1:26:12] that the path of the just shineth
[1:26:15] brighter and brighter and to that
[1:26:17] perfect day when you and i first started
[1:26:20] out in our journey it was not as bright
[1:26:22] as it is now in your life it's turning
[1:26:25] out a little dismal but it was light
[1:26:27] that was moving and as you keep walking
[1:26:30] the path of the just gets brighter and
[1:26:33] brighter and brighter until what until
[1:26:36] our lives are shrouded with the glory of
[1:26:39] almighty god
[1:26:44] oh hallelujah
[1:26:46] out of his mouth the bible
[1:26:48] said comes a sharp two-edged sword
[1:26:54] out of his mouth
[1:26:56] when's the last time you ever known
[1:26:57] anybody to handle a sword out of their
[1:26:58] mouth
[1:27:02] nobody but this is where his sword comes
[1:27:05] from
[1:27:07] and remember what jesus said
[1:27:09] he said man shall not live by bread
[1:27:11] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:27:13] out of the mouth of god
[1:27:16] not just naturally living because we can
[1:27:18] have everything naturally living and
[1:27:19] this is good and i got this lined up but
[1:27:21] we don't live by that
[1:27:24] we live
[1:27:25] by every word
[1:27:29] so that sword
[1:27:31] and not a sword that's coming out of a
[1:27:33] seminary
[1:27:35] he didn't say it's a sword coming out of
[1:27:36] some man's mind
[1:27:40] remember it can't be that way but it's
[1:27:43] got to be a sword that comes from him
[1:27:45] and remember the sword the sword is the
[1:27:48] word of god
[1:27:50] and the word of god is him his person
[1:27:53] his life so what is
[1:27:56] so what is coming from him is not
[1:27:59] something different from him
[1:28:03] amen he is here speaking revealing
[1:28:07] himself so it is the sword of the lord
[1:28:11] that comes to deal with our lives
[1:28:14] so you know this is what exactly what
[1:28:16] god doing in this last age when we look
[1:28:20] at this scripture he's revealing the
[1:28:22] heart secrets of men and women in this
[1:28:25] age which we're living because remember
[1:28:27] god listen now in part of the
[1:28:29] circumcision here
[1:28:31] god will not circumcise
[1:28:33] over top of sin
[1:28:36] are you hearing me now well god i've got
[1:28:38] this little habit you know i i look at
[1:28:40] women and i do this but you know i i'm
[1:28:42] pretty good about it it only happens
[1:28:44] every once every day god said it's got
[1:28:46] to be all cut away from your life you
[1:28:48] know what god wants to do god wants to
[1:28:50] look at it and say you've got to get to
[1:28:52] a spot till you really hate it and you
[1:28:54] when you hate something you're not going
[1:28:56] to make excuses for it
[1:28:59] you're not going to find favorite quotes
[1:29:01] to profit oh my you're not going to find
[1:29:03] favorite quotes to pop it up but what
[1:29:05] you're going to do is stand there as a
[1:29:07] real child of god i'm identifying with
[1:29:10] the word to say amen with the word of
[1:29:13] god i may not be there yet but i'm
[1:29:16] saying so be it lord
[1:29:20] [Applause]
[1:29:23] let's say now i'm ashamed that others
[1:29:24] will know well don't tell everybody then
[1:29:27] don't blame it all on facebook on
[1:29:29] facebook or book or whatever it's called
[1:29:32] there ain't no mediator between between
[1:29:34] you know your mama your daddy or your
[1:29:36] aunt and uncle hates your mediator
[1:29:39] there's one mediator between god
[1:29:41] [Applause]
[1:29:43] and his people and that's the man christ
[1:29:45] jesus
[1:29:47] [Music]
[1:29:48] it ain't going to some boxing a church
[1:29:50] and confessing your sins to some man
[1:29:53] cause a man can't do nothing about it
[1:29:57] but there is one
[1:30:00] there is one
[1:30:01] the man christ jesus where god came down
[1:30:05] in flesh though he was tempted he was
[1:30:08] tempted in all points like we are but
[1:30:11] he's overcome and he said i took the
[1:30:14] holy ghost in my life and i overcame and
[1:30:18] you shall to
[1:30:20] be of good cheer for i've overcome the
[1:30:23] world
[1:30:24] [Applause]
[1:30:26] in this age
[1:30:29] he's revealing himself as the mighty
[1:30:31] conqueror
[1:30:36] when the seals were tore off the book
[1:30:41] he reveals himself i'm the mighty
[1:30:43] conqueror
[1:30:44] i triumphed over satan's trinity death
[1:30:47] hell in the grave
[1:30:50] i've never lost a battle
[1:30:52] man has laid down my word in the face of
[1:30:55] conflict but i've never lost a battle
[1:30:58] there's never been one person that'll
[1:31:01] hang on to that word and stand there
[1:31:03] toe-to-toe with the devil and they'll
[1:31:06] keep with that word there's never been a
[1:31:08] defeat because the word can't be
[1:31:11] defeated
[1:31:15] our feelings will be defeated
[1:31:19] i felt this way when i was prayed for i
[1:31:21] don't feel this way no more that has
[1:31:24] nothing to do with the word of god
[1:31:34] i
[1:31:34] i'm trying to help you tonight that's
[1:31:36] what he's trying to do
[1:31:38] not trying to put people down he's
[1:31:39] trying to help us tonight
[1:31:42] we're walking too much on feelings
[1:31:45] well i don't feel this way i don't feel
[1:31:47] this way remember being led by the holy
[1:31:50] ghost doesn't mean that you always feel
[1:31:52] spiritual there are threes that god
[1:31:54] leads you and i that we don't even feel
[1:31:56] as spiritual and you come to find out
[1:31:58] you were right in line in tune with what
[1:32:01] god wanted to be done
[1:32:04] you know what gets in the way our own
[1:32:07] thinking
[1:32:16] oh my
[1:32:17] try let me just try to boy i'll tell you
[1:32:19] just trying to bring this down here
[1:32:21] lord have mercy
[1:32:24] where does time go
[1:32:28] you probably say brother samuel if you
[1:32:30] didn't make announcements i know that's
[1:32:31] one of the defaults as a pastor
[1:32:35] that's one of the things i wish i could
[1:32:37] get other brothers to come out here and
[1:32:38] make but i still got to get you out here
[1:32:39] at a good time
[1:32:41] but uh
[1:32:42] something we have to do in it
[1:32:45] but you see the word coming in our midst
[1:32:47] in this in this hour i
[1:32:49] let me just try to wrap this up here on
[1:32:51] this
[1:32:53] point here
[1:32:55] it's the word
[1:32:56] that god has sent
[1:32:58] to this hour
[1:33:00] god knew every circumstance that would
[1:33:02] be here
[1:33:05] he knew every reasoning devil that would
[1:33:07] be here
[1:33:09] and let me just tell you something
[1:33:11] god
[1:33:12] is more than a match
[1:33:14] and with god on your side you're more
[1:33:16] than a match
[1:33:19] that's why you always want to identify
[1:33:21] with god that's why you want to identify
[1:33:23] with him
[1:33:25] and that's not what he said in his word
[1:33:27] he said if you'll be ashamed of me
[1:33:29] i'll be ashamed of you
[1:33:32] is that right
[1:33:33] if they will be ashamed of me the son of
[1:33:35] man in this generation talking about
[1:33:37] right now then i'll be ashamed of you
[1:33:42] i'm not ashamed of him
[1:33:46] he's changed my life
[1:33:48] he's brought me through tests and trials
[1:33:50] oh he's put up with me much long
[1:33:52] suffering he's molded me he shaped me
[1:33:55] he's still where i'm not ashamed of him
[1:33:58] i'm not ashamed of this life it's the
[1:34:00] most glorious and grandest privilege it
[1:34:03] is to know jesus christ and to serve him
[1:34:06] i'm not ashamed of him i'm not ashamed
[1:34:09] when he comes in our midst and devils
[1:34:11] begin to tremble i'm not ashamed of him
[1:34:14] when the sick are healed i'm not ashamed
[1:34:16] of him when devils are put to flight in
[1:34:20] deliverance i'm not ashamed of him
[1:34:23] he is my help
[1:34:28] it's the same spirit this is the word
[1:34:31] it's the same spirit of jesus back in
[1:34:34] the church of the living god
[1:34:36] not just a portion of it
[1:34:38] like luther had
[1:34:40] to believe that just shall believe that
[1:34:43] was good
[1:34:44] but there's more
[1:34:47] there's more
[1:34:49] but now
[1:34:50] the spirit of god coming in the midst of
[1:34:53] the church
[1:34:55] to head the church off before judgment
[1:34:59] because we're at the end
[1:35:02] the bible tells us in revelations 10 the
[1:35:04] coming of this message is is is the
[1:35:07] finishing of the mystery of god the
[1:35:08] mystery of god is the holy ghost christ
[1:35:11] coming in the life of the believer
[1:35:14] behold i i send elijah to you before
[1:35:16] that great and dreadful day of the lord
[1:35:18] the coming of elijah the coming of a
[1:35:19] prophet is a sign of judgments at hand
[1:35:22] right
[1:35:23] and there was nobody to stand in on our
[1:35:25] behalf
[1:35:27] there wasn't any and i hope you
[1:35:28] understand what i'm saying there wasn't
[1:35:30] any organization or anything that was
[1:35:32] present that could stem the tide or
[1:35:35] bring deliverance to you and i
[1:35:37] in other words
[1:35:38] god couldn't find a man
[1:35:40] to make up the gap
[1:35:43] are you hearing me now
[1:35:45] god couldn't find a man as i said in the
[1:35:47] book of ezekiel one
[1:35:49] that would span the breach
[1:35:53] are you hearing me now now one brother
[1:35:55] branham that did that but brother
[1:35:56] branham yielded himself because he was
[1:35:59] ordained by the by the promise of the
[1:36:02] hour and christ came down in that
[1:36:05] yielded vessel and when he preached the
[1:36:08] message to preach it was christ
[1:36:11] identified i am present to tie my church
[1:36:15] back in to the every promise of god
[1:36:21] it was the son of man in a son of man
[1:36:25] are you hearing me now
[1:36:28] brother branham put it very simple
[1:36:30] in the message first seal
[1:36:33] and an unveiling of god it's the word
[1:36:36] in the man
[1:36:42] it's the head off before judgment what
[1:36:44] what's a heading off before judgment
[1:36:46] it's god it's god coming down to loosen
[1:36:50] and uncover everything that would hinder
[1:36:52] a life think of the woman at the well as
[1:36:54] we close
[1:36:55] as she was came to that well to get
[1:36:57] water like she normally did
[1:36:59] but god had an appointment that morning
[1:37:01] with her
[1:37:04] she knew now she knew more than the
[1:37:05] pharisees news that right
[1:37:07] she said she knew you know when it when
[1:37:10] it began to come
[1:37:11] she was able to identify
[1:37:13] we know when messiah's coming
[1:37:15] he'll tell us where we're to worship
[1:37:18] she was confident of that
[1:37:22] but she was still bound
[1:37:25] with sin
[1:37:27] she knew all about the promise of god
[1:37:28] let me just tell you beneath
[1:37:31] all of the darkness
[1:37:33] was a real believer
[1:37:37] down beneath there was a character
[1:37:40] that god himself the chief stonemason
[1:37:44] was coming and what was he going to do
[1:37:46] he was going gonna cut away everything
[1:37:50] that was unlike her mama you know what
[1:37:53] was happening the word was coming to
[1:37:56] bring judgment on those spirits that had
[1:37:59] held her in bondage
[1:38:02] and the prince
[1:38:04] of this world is judged
[1:38:08] and it's time now judgment begin at the
[1:38:11] house of
[1:38:14] god hallelujah
[1:38:17] where devils are brought from undercover
[1:38:20] where devils are cast out
[1:38:25] hallelujah
[1:38:27] oh glory be to god in the highest
[1:38:31] right while the words being preached
[1:38:33] listen friends we can cast them out
[1:38:35] right here we're laying on hands but
[1:38:37] even while the words going forth don't
[1:38:39] matter how it comes as long as it gets
[1:38:40] done
[1:38:41] those devils will leave but what's the
[1:38:43] main important part is once they leave
[1:38:47] get that place filled with the spirit of
[1:38:50] god
[1:38:59] oh brother samuel i used to be a
[1:39:01] drunkard but i don't drink no more what
[1:39:02] happened the devil went out
[1:39:05] i used to be bound with pornography what
[1:39:07] happened brother samuel a devil went out
[1:39:10] well i used to be bound with smoking
[1:39:12] high speed bound with luster i used to
[1:39:13] be about what happened a devil went out
[1:39:17] do you realize the power of the word
[1:39:20] that even when you repent
[1:39:22] and really repent repent isn't just
[1:39:24] feeling sorry for yourself because that
[1:39:26] ain't repentance
[1:39:27] that's called worldly sorrow
[1:39:30] oh i'm in a bad place oh i'm me on my
[1:39:33] i'm in such a bad place you ain't
[1:39:35] getting nowhere
[1:39:37] the bible said
[1:39:39] godly sorrow worketh repentance
[1:39:44] is that right
[1:39:45] you're repenting of your own do you
[1:39:47] realize that even right there the
[1:39:49] scripture is fulfilled where devils flee
[1:39:52] from your life
[1:39:54] are you hearing me the bible said that
[1:39:56] there were devils that went out and
[1:39:58] walked in dry dry clean places
[1:40:03] oh my
[1:40:04] god brother samuel what did that
[1:40:06] well not not your flesh
[1:40:08] but your belief in the word of god
[1:40:12] and now the same god think about it the
[1:40:15] simplicity to agree with the word and
[1:40:18] the word would come right down and cut
[1:40:20] that right out of the life and run that
[1:40:22] right out of your life by just
[1:40:24] identifying yourself with the word what
[1:40:27] will it do when you invite the god who
[1:40:30] delivers his word and cuts that out of
[1:40:33] your life to say god come down lord and
[1:40:37] feel my life
[1:40:50] this is why paul said in second timothy
[1:40:52] 4 8
[1:40:55] there's a crown of righteousness
[1:40:58] that's laid up for me you know what that
[1:40:59] crown of righteousness is
[1:41:02] it's a new body
[1:41:06] it's not the terrestrial
[1:41:08] it's the celestial
[1:41:11] it's the same body that peter spoke of
[1:41:13] that said there's a body reserved in the
[1:41:14] heavens
[1:41:18] it's the same body that's right there
[1:41:20] before the presence of god
[1:41:23] just like
[1:41:26] your state representative or senator
[1:41:29] or
[1:41:30] that might be bad taste in people's
[1:41:31] mouth but you understand what i'm saying
[1:41:33] they're up there in washington and
[1:41:34] they're supposed to be representing us
[1:41:36] right
[1:41:38] they're supposed to be representing
[1:41:40] our wishes and our desires
[1:41:43] let me tell you something
[1:41:45] but with that body there when the holy
[1:41:47] ghost it brings you and it ties you back
[1:41:50] in to that theophany to that body that's
[1:41:53] right there in heavenly places you know
[1:41:55] what's happening what's what do they do
[1:41:57] in washington when they pass certain
[1:41:58] things you represent them over there
[1:42:00] there's things past you and i end up
[1:42:02] receive well here we end up receiving
[1:42:03] either cursings or blessings or whatever
[1:42:05] it is but there ain't no such thing as
[1:42:06] cursing's coming from the prince of god
[1:42:08] the bible said there are spiritual
[1:42:10] blessings in christ jesus we receive
[1:42:14] blessings from the presence of almighty
[1:42:16] god
[1:42:18] we're identifying with that word there's
[1:42:20] a pulsation in our life do you realize
[1:42:24] even when we
[1:42:25] have come to a place we might have said
[1:42:27] around this message for a long time
[1:42:29] but when we finally recognize
[1:42:32] it's eagle food
[1:42:34] you know what eagle food is it ain't
[1:42:36] food where you're walking around here
[1:42:41] you know what eagle food is
[1:42:43] it's sustenance
[1:42:45] that gives us the nutrients to fly
[1:42:51] brother brad said when you recognized it
[1:42:53] was eagle food this message and left the
[1:42:57] other thing
[1:43:00] you just can't recognize oh man this is
[1:43:02] really good you have to leave the other
[1:43:04] thing
[1:43:06] oh boy
[1:43:07] i'm not even gonna go there but all them
[1:43:10] who love
[1:43:12] his appearing
[1:43:14] now his appearing is not his coming
[1:43:17] his appearing is his presence
[1:43:21] coming in the form of his word his life
[1:43:24] the holy spirit coming and making
[1:43:26] himself known
[1:43:28] that i am the same
[1:43:30] yesterday today and forever and we with
[1:43:34] this message is the witness of his
[1:43:36] appearing
[1:43:39] and to love his appearing makes you
[1:43:42] ready for his coming
[1:43:45] and we're loving his appearing showing i
[1:43:48] have representation on the other side
[1:43:51] then what does that make you i am a
[1:43:53] pilgrim and a stranger here
[1:43:57] oh glory be to god
[1:44:00] oh my
[1:44:02] oh let's pray
[1:44:07] heavenly father
[1:44:11] lord as we
[1:44:13] and over a few moments lord have taken
[1:44:17] to look into your word as you would

[1:44:48] may we as believers your prophet would
[1:44:51] take
[1:44:52] and he would speak
[1:44:53] two different messages
[1:44:55] hearing
[1:44:58] recognizing
[1:44:59] and acting
[1:45:01] upon the word of god
[1:45:04] lord when we have heard
[1:45:06] you speak to our lives here tonight
[1:45:10] then lord
[1:45:12] it wouldn't matter
[1:45:14] what would be around the life even
[1:45:18] well lord whatever spirit of torment
[1:45:20] maybe it's a disease an affliction
[1:45:24] maybe it's a habit lord

[1:45:29] it's something lord of unconfessed sin
[1:45:31] that's there
[1:45:33] but you're here
[1:45:35] to head that life off
[1:45:38] before judgment
[1:45:40] you're here
[1:45:42] to bring judgment on that spirit to
[1:45:44] loosen
[1:45:46] your children

[1:48:57] [Music]
[1:49:04] remember when stephen he stood there
[1:49:06] that day and he was ministering he was
[1:49:09] speaking
[1:49:10] he was speaking to
[1:49:15] very religious men
[1:49:19] but if peter began to speak to him
[1:49:21] this was their response
[1:49:24] the bible says they gnashed
[1:49:26] upon him with their teeth
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:30] you know what does that
[1:49:32] dogs
[1:49:35] when they start showing their teeth you
[1:49:36] know you better back up
[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:42] the word
[1:49:43] was exposing
[1:49:45] what was there
[1:49:48] that wasn't a character see beneath that
[1:49:52] what was happening
[1:49:53] gnashing out against this is why stephen
[1:49:55] could say
[1:49:57] your stiff neck means stubborn
[1:50:01] not willing to move
[1:50:02] and uncircumcising hearts and ears these
[1:50:06] are people
[1:50:07] who knew
[1:50:08] the letter well
[1:50:11] you quote one thing they can give you
[1:50:12] the one before it and the one after it
[1:50:18] but when the word came to them
[1:50:21] this is what it means to be
[1:50:22] uncircumcised to have a thick
[1:50:25] and dull
[1:50:27] sense
[1:50:29] over your life
[1:50:30] where you're not able to recognize
[1:50:34] the divine admonition from god
[1:50:37] this is why brother brown would pray it
[1:50:39] over and over god
[1:50:40] circumcised every heart and every year
[1:50:43] circumcise our hearts and our ears
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:47] that's what we want
[1:50:49] we know that the circumcision of the
[1:50:52] holy ghost is is is a one time it's it's
[1:50:54] there once that's done it's done you
[1:50:57] don't get born again and then reborn
[1:50:58] again and then reap you're born again
[1:51:01] but how that we need the circumcising of
[1:51:04] the holy spirit
[1:51:06] to remove anything that would be
[1:51:09] sense bound
[1:51:11] cutting away anything
[1:51:14] that's unlike him no wonder brother
[1:51:15] battle would say it over and over lord
[1:51:18] circumcise our ears
[1:51:20] our hearts lord
[1:51:22] [Music]
[1:51:24] in other words we could write it around
[1:51:25] writing a different way when brother
[1:51:27] adam would continue to pray over and
[1:51:29] over lord
[1:51:30] quicken us by your spirit to your word
[1:51:32] quicken us lord by your spirit over and
[1:51:34] over
[1:51:35] after the seals were opened brother
[1:51:37] brown continued to say that over and
[1:51:38] over and over and over in his opening
[1:51:40] prayer
[1:51:41] that's why we need

[1:51:46] get thick layer of skin well i've been
[1:51:49] in the message so long and i know this

[1:51:56] there ain't nothing no no no we climb
[1:51:59] higher and higher and higher in god
[1:52:04] that's where every other one before
[1:52:07] has failed
[1:52:09] because they put a limiter on god
[1:52:13] you know they got limiters on this
[1:52:15] microphone back there compressor
[1:52:17] on this
[1:52:19] go figure why

[1:52:25] volumes
[1:52:27] all the time and
[1:52:28] turn this down and turning that down and
[1:52:31] they have they have a device back there
[1:52:33] that takes and they can set it when i've
[1:52:35] got in here with them one-on-one and
[1:52:36] yelled and everything else they can set
[1:52:39] it
[1:52:40] to where it'll limit me
[1:52:42] so it doesn't oh pull down the volume oh
[1:52:45] turn up the volume i'll pull up that
[1:52:47] they've got that set back there
[1:52:50] but we don't want to put limiters on god
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:52:53] we don't want to put limiters on god we
[1:52:55] don't want to get it set to i tell you
[1:52:57] i've been in this so long no
[1:52:59] you know what
[1:53:01] if god terry's right here
[1:53:03] uh
[1:53:04] how many years will it be you know

[1:53:52] and so i think man i think i'm going
[1:53:54] along i think i'm yielding pretty good
[1:53:56] and then here a tester trial comes and
[1:53:58] and god takes that test or trial and
[1:53:59] what's he doing
[1:54:01] he's changing the limiters
[1:54:03] that i put on him
[1:54:06] i'm the one who's put limiters on him we
[1:54:08] put limiters on him
