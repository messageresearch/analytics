in a word of prayer before we go to the scripture tonight Heavenly Father Lord we come before you and we're asking for you to be our guide Lord tonight father come Lord anoint his father in the office you've called us Lord to be able to yield to you that you can come and speak to the people Lord you know in their needs Lord God and how to speak to us Lord we ask God that you would just have your way in service tonight Jesus Christ's name amen amen while you're standing if you could turn me in your Bibles to Exodus chapter 25. I want to begin reading verse 10. through 18. amen foreign verse 10 and they shall make an ark of shenton wood two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof Thou shalt overlay it with pure gold within and without shall they overlay it and shall make upon it a crown of gold round about Thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it and put them in the four corners thereof and two rings shall be on the one side of it and two rings on the other side of it Thou shalt make stays of shenton wood and overlay them with gold thou shall put the stains in the Rings by the sides of the Ark that the ark may be born with them The Stave shall be in the rings of the Ark and they shall not be taken from it Thou shalt put in the ark the testimony which I shall give thee and thou shalt make of Mercy seed of pure gold two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof and a cubit and a half the breath thereof and thou shalt make two cherubims of gold of beaten work shalt thou make them in the two ends of The Mercy Seat amen may be seated what I would like to speak on tonight is hid behind Badger skins when Moses was instructed to build the Tabernacle in the wilderness he was instructed how to make the curtains of the outer court and the inner court and the holies of holies and and the curtains were made out of goat's hair and different things and and they were colors uh different colors you know the outer curtain was of pure white and then they had curtains of blue and of purple and and so on but but the curtain that was made to hide the ark which was in the holies of holies was made out of badger skin and Badger skin Badgers they're a cantankerous animal and they stink and they can't really get along with one another very good and so you wonder why would God choose this Critter to make the take his skin and make this curtain that hid this Ark which we had just read was a beautiful thing it was overlaid with gold within and without the staves that carried it were overlaid with gold the cherubims that were on top were overlaid with gold The Mercy Seat was overlaid with gold it was a a very beautiful thing and this beautiful thing was hid behind something ugly it was hid behind Badger skin and there was nothing when you look at Badger skin there was nothing of it to be desired there was nothing beautiful about it that was the same way with the Flesh of Jesus Christ the Bible says there was no beauty that we should desire him brother Madam said the flesh that he walked around in was Badger skin it was the same skin that you walk around in you know he was a man in his flesh and his his flesh grew old his flesh grew tired his flesh grew weak in his flesh he went through everything uh the and tested in every way the Bible said such as knowing to man so there's nothing that you go through that Jesus couldn't understand because he walked around in the same flesh the same Badger skin that you're walking around in and that's what the badger skin represented it was a representation of the flesh that eventually the word of God which which what the ark represented was God's word and this iconic Glory was hid behind those Badger skins amen and uh you know uh Israel looked and wondered when God began to turn to the Gentiles how could God have mercy on such a sinful foul People Like Us Gentiles but what they they what they failed to see was the one that was back there in The Mercy Seat given the mercy amen and but God has always hid himself behind the veil God hid himself behind the veil in the days of Moses the mo the veil that he was hidden behind was the skin of Moses Moses flesh Moses came and he says you and God told him said you be God and let Aaron be your prophet he said you you'll be God and Aaron will do the speaking and uh so you know it was God that came down and met Moses in that burning bush and then God it was God in Moses bailed In the Flesh and they said that it's wrote in the scripture that the the glory that shined around Moses was so great that he had to cover his face when he came before the people what was it it wasn't Moses it wasn't his flesh it was what was living on the inside of the man amen God has always hit himself behind in every age he hid himself through the prophets coming on down through the Old Testament and then as we said hid in the flesh of Jesus Christ amen and uh he and the reason that that people couldn't see you know when Jesus walked on the earth the reason the people couldn't see that it was God was because of his flesh they looked and they saw this this stoop-shouldered man they saw this man that that that that was like any other man and they failed to see that it was that he was God in a man it was hid God had hid himself and God still hides himself in flesh today amen the the the Sinners of the world they can't see God in you because they look at your flesh people that you've known before you were changed they look at what you did and how you lived and how you were before you got changed before Jesus came into your life but once Jesus came into your life then it quickened that seeking of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world and there's something quick and if you had changed you but it changed you on the inside you still look like the same person on the outside nothing changed on the outside you still look like the same person you still walk the same way you may be still you know uh uh uh you you still look the same you got old and and you get tired and and you get feeble and you you get sick and they want well if you belong to God why are you getting sick why are you coming down with this disease it's because I'm living in this old pest house this Badger skin that's hiding what's going the inside deity veiled in human flesh amen all the glory of God was behind those Badger skin the Shekinah Glory of God you know the the manner we spoke of it on Sunday the manner that would come down Angel's bread and they would gather this man up and they could keep it uh and eat it for that day but they couldn't keep it over to the next day it would spoil but they took the Moses took and gathered manna that fell in the very first day and he took it behind and put it back there by the Ark of the company behind the badger skin and in the Shekinah Glory of God it never spoiled the same thing today the power of God the Holy Ghost that's come into your life and this economic glory is what is friends it's what's ripening the seed of God that's in you is the Shekinah Glory of God that dwells on the inside he's hid from the eyes of the wide is imprudent he's bailed himself in Earthen vessels as the Bible says amen in the I want to tell you somebody is bugging me to death foreign you know you the people look at you and they see maybe the way you dress and and they see what you know the sisters how they dress and how they have their hair and all this you know and they look at you you know and they say well we don't know what's matter with you that's because I can't see what's what happened on the inside of you they don't know you've been changed they're looking at the outside and they don't as we said before they don't see no change in that amen but now in in in when uh Solomon in the days of Solomon remember that he built the temple so in the days of David the the house of God was still behind bales of in a tent and David wanted to build a house for God he said I live in a nice house I want to build a house for God but God wouldn't let David do it but David laid down the plans of how he was to be built and the materials that were to be used and and how they were debated and and they got wood from certain places from Lebanon and and they they everything was was particular on how it was going to be done and then Solomon being the son of David and becoming King he was the one that actually built the temple but after they got this beautiful magnificent temple built guess what they did they not the old Badger skin from the from the Tabernacle in the wilderness and brought it into this beautiful Temple and it was still the old Badger skin that was hiding the Ark of the Covenant or the word Shekinah Glory of God they didn't change that why because it was a type and Shadow that was that that pointed on down through the age to when Jesus Christ God would come in flesh and it was not also pointing to that only but it was pointing at when God would be in the flesh of mankind and there was no Beauty in Jesus you know he cried like the man there's the deer cried at the tomb of of Lazarus just like a man but then he spoke and said Lazarus come forth and it was a God in the man that spoke and it was God's word that brought Lazarus forth from the dead again but they looked at him and you know he he allowed himself to be beaten and they shout the crown of thorns on his head and they spit on him and they tore out his beard and they blindfolded him and smote him and said prophesy and tell us who hit you they did all kinds of things to him and he just let him do it and he said will it vitamin God he wouldn't have just let him do it but it was God hid in that humble man that humble flesh God was hidden there and they didn't know it now Israel you know they were not allowed to go behind the veil remember the high priest was the only one allowed to go behind that veil of badger skin and go in there and he only went in there once once a year but he was the only one that was allowed to go in there and and remember you know if he went in there and had something wrong and they hadn't come under the blood of the sacrifice then he would die and they what they would do is they would tie a rope to his leg and there would be bells on the bottoms of His Garment and if they quit hearing them Bells they had to grab that rope and pull him out because that many was dead and they couldn't go behind to get him that's why they had the road but they couldn't go behind there they couldn't see it but by faith they knew God was back there now Satan is the accuser of the brother the Bible says he accuses you before God both day and night he also comes and accuses you to yourself he points out every fault you've got he points out every failure he points out every time you make a mistake everything you do wrong every sin that you commit Satan's right there at a point of finger and maybe sometimes you'll have somebody that that you know out there in the world to say and you know they're always there to say well I thought you were a Christian will get on there but they'll come around you and they'll try to push every button you got just to see how you're going to react and if you don't act the way that they think of Christianity said well I thought you were a Christian well how in the world they know what a Christian's supposed to act like they're not one [Applause] but see Satan accuses you and many times friends we get to feeling down on ourselves when we when we do something and then we realize I did wrong then we just feel so ashamed and we feel so terrible and we actually feel filthy and it gets into feeling we feel like we don't feel like a Christian anymore but by faith you know that it's still God living inside of you it isn't being it isn't because you're perfect in this flesh because you're never going to be perfect in this place when when you've got the Holy Ghost your flesh didn't get it right you got it on the inside in your soul but this flesh is still the same it remembers all the sin you ever done it remembers what things taste like it remembers what they felt like it remembers what they smelt like and Satan's constantly there to try to bring those things back to your remembrance you'd be driving down the road and see a big old billboard or something and the first thing you know you bring the click and goes back in time maybe about something in your life something you did or how you lived right and what it is is Satan trying to get you to dwell on them thoughts he's trying to get you to feel bad about yourself because that's his job he's the accuser of the brother friends I'm going to tell you tonight I'm not perfect I make mistakes I am a failure at times but I'll tell you God's living on the inside of me I might not be perfect on the outside but the inside is pure as perfect as can be and one of these days there's coming a day to when I'm going to receive a body change and what's on the insides of finally going to reflect onto the outside and I'm going to look like on the outside what I look like on the inside [Applause] and you will too don't get down on yourself you're just living in Badger skin Badgers I you know I read about him they're animals that a lot of times they live alone because they can't get along with one another brother Branham said the Bible said God had to give you a new spirit because the one you had you couldn't even get along with yourself [Music] Hallelujah and he filled you with the Holy Ghost Israel Knew by faith that he was back there it didn't matter what any of the Heather Nations said they knew he was back there by faith they couldn't go back there and look at him but they knew he was there and friends you know we we look and and there's there's you know the only thing you can look at to know that God's living on the inside of you is something's changed inside of you you don't have the same desires you used to have it's gone wiped out it wasn't nothing you could do yourself us if we try to change ourselves it'd be like somebody trying to pick themselves up with their own bootstraps you couldn't do it it took somebody else to come see man had sinned in the garden and when he sinned then it put him on the other side of the chasm on this side he was the son of God and in the sonship of God he was a little Creator he could speak and things would be but when he sinned it put him on the other side of the chasm and there was no way back but then God gave him a substitute and Abel spoke of it the blood of lamb and it was a substitute but the thing about it was all he could do was it was a covering for the sin it couldn't divorce the sin it couldn't annihilate the sin they they made sacrifices for the people in the in the Tabernacle in the wilderness they would make sacrifices for the people's sin the people would bring a sacrifice up there you know even in the time of Jesus they would bring in sacrifices up to the priests in the temple to make a sacrifice for their sin and he would make a sacrifice for it and then their sin would would we be covered but it didn't take it away it's still laid there they went out and would do the same thing over again bring back another sacrifice but God sent one remember in the Book of Revelations in Revelations chapter 5 it said they looked all through heaven and all through Earth we could find no man worthy to come and take the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and John began to weep why because if nobody was worthy to take the book then every name that was in that book would be lost because man had sinned and the book had went back into the hands of God amen that somebody had to be worthy to come and take the book and John began to weep and then a voice spoke and said weep not John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah had prevailed and John turned and he looked but instead of seeing a line what he saw was a lamb as if it had been slain bloody all right it was Christ and the Bible says he came and he died once and for all were cleansed he didn't just die for past sins he didn't just die for present sins he died for all sins that ever would be [Applause] when you come to Jesus and you give Jesus your life and you're filled with the Holy Ghost friends look you know the Bible says I believe it's in the Book of John it says if any man say he has a sin he's a liar all have sinned and come short of the glory of God we're all Sinners saved by grace but one came and took our place he became us he came down left the rim parts of glory and came down and became man hid himself behind Badger skin flesh of human beings and became us so that we might become him by grace and he shed his blood and friends let me tell you something he said it for your sins you know when you as I was saying when you got saved and and and and you took some received salvation that didn't just divorce all the sins that that you ever had committed but it took care of every one that you ever were going to commit we all make mistakes and as long as we're in these bodies we're going to make mistakes when you got the Holy Ghost it didn't change the desires of your flesh it just changed the desires of your heart and and see the inside man has got to bring this outside flesh into subjection the outside flesh it still has a desire for sin but the reason the reason that you're able to live the way you live is because the inside man that sin has been annihilated God sent down an agent from heaven for the Bible said it's called bleach it was the blood of his own son and When sin is purged and plunged beneath the blood of Jesus Christ it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness God don't ever even know it God doesn't even see it it's remembered no more except by the devil but you know why the devil can't remember it because brother Branham said when it's plunged in the blood of Jesus Christ it it it's gone from you he says and God takes it and throws it back on the devil and it stays on him until the day of judgment when he's going to be cast into the fiery pit that's why he can remember it he's the one that's got it he's the one that caused it [Applause] you realize that the same Holy Ghost it was in Jesus Christ is in you it's not a different spirit it's the same spirit the Bible says if the same spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwells in you it shall Quicken your mortal bodies it's the same spirit he died there he was on the cross a man crying out my God my God why is Thou forsaken me what had happened God had pulled back from him he had to die like a man and he died and took because he took on him the sins of the world he was sent to hell but his Spirit was sent back on the believer on the day of Pentecost the same Holy Ghost friends let me tell you something the same God that lived in Jesus is the same God that's living in you it's not a different spirit it's not a different God it's the same one [Music] what's inside of you is the power of God you've got power to overcome sin accuser the Brethren has been cast down the Bible says he doesn't have any more power over you don't listen to him you know the problem is people the Devil comes to talk to them and they they sit around and listen to him what does he do he comes and interjects a thought he can't read your mind but what he does he comes and interjects a thought into your mind because that's the Battleground that he chose and he puts a thought in there and then he stands back and watches to see what's your reaction to that thought's going to be many times you know what our reaction is before you know it we're gone way off on a tangent somewhere thinking on that thought remember what you did just the other day yeah yeah I remember it boy don't you feel awful yes I sure do friends you know something there are people out there that do those things that don't feel awful they don't feel awful about doing it they never feel no they never gel no conviction over it they don't feel any condemnation over it they just live that way thank God that we get to feeling bad about things we've done it shows Who You Are if you didn't feel bad about it friends something would be wrong with you but immediately when we realized we've done something wrong we want to say father forgive me Lord I'm so sorry God please cleanse me oh God deliver me from this I don't want it no more Lord set me free and that's what he came to do will set you free Hallelujah the Holy Ghost has come upon you it does the same things that it did in Jesus he said the works that I do shall you do also greater than these things and that's the King James version how it says it but what it means more of the same yeah you do Hallelujah praise God the witness of the Resurrection lives inside of you the witness that Jesus Christ did in fact rise raised from the dead the witness of it is because he lives in you people people don't see Jesus today oh they they see you know crosses and they see you know crucifixes and they see different things that man has made and they see their churches but that's not God that's not Jesus Christ Jesus never chose to be tabble-knackled in a building remember what he said to David what house will you build me because he doesn't dwell in a house he come to dwell in man he come to dwell in you Hallelujah if we can't have faith that we got the Holy Ghost how are we going to have faith to Rapture out of here it's by faith you know that God the Holy Ghost not because you're perfect and that's what a lot of people want they want they want something that all of a sudden makes them perfect they want something where there's no more fight no more battle brother Branham said before you got the Holy Ghost you were just floating along with the rest of the trash but when you got the Holy Ghost that's when the battle began that's when you got to battle this flesh that's when you got to battle Satan in your mind quit listening to him listen to God's word listen to what God's got to say about you there's coming an hour when the Church of God is going to rise in all of her beauty we're going to rise out of here in the Rapture one of these days you know Satan he always comes as he accused he's always trying to tell you you ain't going to make it look at what you've done you're not going to make it you're going to miss a rapture one of these days you're going to come come to church or you're going to try to get a hold of somebody on the phone and you're not going to be able to go to hold them because they're going to be on the Rapture and you're going to be left behind that's what he tells you that's what he tells me but I I got a secret for you the devil is a liar and you know something friends the devil don't even know who belongs to him the devil's got children but he don't know whose is his and whose belongs to God but I know that I belong to God don't you know it there's something happen to me that changed me from what I was changed everything I was changed every desire I had I can't explain it I can't explain the scientific facts of how it happened the song says it never comes and tries to tell you you're not saved but the song says but I was there when it happened so I guess I ought to know I was there when Jesus saved me Hallelujah I was there the moment that he forgave me and friends when he forgave me he didn't just forgive me and say okay now you're forgiven now so don't mess up because I can't forgive you no more no he says if any man sins we've got an advocate with the father someone to plead our case someone that took our place friends look that sins in the sea of God's forgetfulness amen you stand you know job they come and try to tell him he was a secret sinner that's why all these things was happening to him but what had happened was the devil had come up before God and God has said have you not considered my servant job there's none like him in all the Earth the devil said well he's rich he's got many possessions life is good you've blessed him you've got a hedge around him no wonder he serves you you take that hedge down and you let me touch his life for a minute you let me take everything he's got and I'll have him curse you to your face boy I tell you what I get to thinking about that and I say God please don't be bragging on me God was bragging on job the devil said I'll show you God said go ahead take everything he's got he sure did he took all of his cattle he took all of his his herd he took all of his flock he took all of his children he took every everything he had he was no longer a rich man he took his health God said you could do everything but you can't take his life and the devil did he took everything that job had but you know what job knew that he had made a sacrifice he knew that his sacrifice held true he knew that he wasn't a secret sinner he know that he had made a sacrifice for everything he had done and he knowed how he stood with God who was it to come and try to tell him he was a secret sinner there's a bunch of church people a bunch of people he went to church with you know there there's people that don't know how to live right but they know how to tell you how to live right it seems like in the 25 years I've been pastoring I've had people that don't got an ounce of a gift on their life to pastor but they know how to tell me to be a pastor they know how to tell me I should be what I should be doing well if you know so much about it why aren't you the one doing it I'll be the first one to tell you I don't know everything about it but I'm not the chief shepherd He is and he knows everything about it when people come to me for counsel I don't have all the answers there's many times I'm sitting there and they're they're going through and they're telling me something you know they're looking for an answer and I'm sitting there praying the whole time they're talking saying God I don't know what to tell them and when they get finished talking the Holy Spirit takes over and begins to talk through me and begins to tell them what they need and tell them and and bring to them the scripture the word of God that they need for that time I remember when I was first going to Pastor I asked brother brownie my dad I asked him I said look I've been with you many times when you've counseled people I said how do you always know what to say he said I don't he said but the thing about it is he said he he told me he said you know you remember when he said we had cattle and he said you know we didn't have running water in the barn you know I told you that I think on Sunday but in the summertime we had a hose and you know we you'd start stretching that hose out to the barn I forget how many yards the barn was from the house but it was quite a distance we had a couple of hoses put together and began stretching that hose out you know and that it you know today they make water hoses that say don't tangle boy I'm gonna tell you something when I was a young boy they Tangled yeah yeah they got kinks in them and everything else and my dad said you know when you'd get out there and no water came out of the hose what would you have to do I said I have to walk back and find the Kink and get the kink out of it he said that's the way it is between you and God he said there's a pipeline he said as long as you keep the Kinks out of it it'll keep flowing every molecule of sin that you commit goes back on the devil every molecule of it think about that faith is a substance so is sin but all the substance of sin goes back on the devil the chemical of the blood of Jesus Christ acts like it acts like a bleach you take a a drop of ink you know and you you put a drop of ink you know you put a drop of Ink on clothes and you can forget about getting it out it's there that stain's going to stay but you put a drop of ink into a bucket of bleach and what happens to it where does it go why can't you find it no more because the chemical compounds within that bleach totally annihilates that ink it don't matter how dark that ink is how black it is bleach annihilates it and that's the chemical makeup of the blood of Jesus Christ it totally annihilates your sin that's why you can say no matter what I don't care what you've done yesterday you still got the Holy Ghost in you today now I'm not talking about going out and willfully sinning I'm talking about the mistakes you make I'm talking about the times you know we talked on Sunday about complaining I'm talking about the times when something happened a situation happened before you know it you lost your cool and there's always somebody I thought you was a Christian it's always the devil sometimes he's in your thoughts sometimes he takes the form of Flesh but there's no more remembrance of sin against you When sin is confessed now if it ain't confessed it'll lay there but the moment you confess it it's gone somebody came up before brother Branham one time and you know they had and and and they said brother Brandon when you were Discerning and I would stand in front of you you didn't say nothing about what I had done president said I didn't see it they said well I did it but when I was in the prayer line before I got up here I confessed it and asked God to forgive me brother bam said that's why I didn't see it when you confess it it's gone the devil when he's exposed he loses his power over you the visible Union of the Bride brother Ram said you're standing there completely you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated to be a son and daughter of God and you're standing there washed your old book of sin of divorcements put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God you're The Virtuous bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless Son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he's Washed by the Water of his own blood that became flesh manifested that he might take you which was predestinated into the bosom of the father from the beginning the same as he was Hallelujah it's this old Badger skin you live in that's why your mistakes that's why you fail from time to time that's why sometimes you seem to slip it's because you're still living in Badger skin but what brings you around and brings it to your mind and makes you confess it it's the god that's living on the inside of you that's proof that he's living there because when he you know friends look God never brings condemnation it's the devil who works through condemnation God brings conviction which is something that that tells you what you've done wrong and gives you a way out of it a way of Escape the Devil comes around and condemns you and damns you and gives and you got no way out no way back but Jesus Christ made a way back amen Grace you're Justified brother I said you know what Justified means it means just as if you've never done it in the first place pure let's stand Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for the word tonight Lord and I pray Lord it's been a help to the people somebody needed it Lord somebody needed to hear it Lord I could raise my hand with them Lord I I needed to be reminded of it we're a man of weaknesses we're a people of weaknesses the Lord you sent Grace for us you sent Mercy for us you sent a cleansing agent the blood of your own son

come to their Jubilee they're going to come to their experience of the atonement and that scripture is written in Prophecy in Isaiah of when all the armies will surround Jerusalem that same scripture is a parallel to where you and I stand in Psalms 27 though a host should surround me foreign yet in this one thing will I be confident David what's your confidence tell us where's your confidence David could say well are they in my flesh what's your confidence David this one thing have I desired and that is that I will dwell in the house of the Lord David wasn't just talking about a building it was prophecy of a people that would desire to stay right in Harmony in Fellowship in the presence of God that sure things could arise but there is something that rises within our hearts Brother Brad tells us in a revelation series he said your sins are taken daily Before the Throne it rises from within this one thing have I desired and so my victory your Victory is based on the desire that's in your heart God Made A Way the Lord Jesus himself God coming down making a way that that desire could express and live in Victory so to me this this scripture when I read it and I don't just look at it that it's something for Israel to come to I believe it's applicable of how the Lord was speaking to us tonight we we are encompassed around with infirmity the enemy always has accusations but this is our stay keep your mind stayed on me your mind [Music] stay home [Music] sweet dreams if you'll just keep your last name only one more time for your mind staying on me [Music] and bye [Music] sweet
