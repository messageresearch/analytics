that's here you know Lord what needs to be spoken there's a thought Lord [Music] God as you would guide me as your servant around that thought but it's the thought that you come to express Lord [Music] so Lord I just give myself to you Lord foreign and this congregation for the glory of God in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah [Music] Amen in the good to be in the house of the Lord I want to invite you to the scriptures in John chapter 17 and just want to remind you of the fellowship dinner here after the service it's there at the Heritage Presbyterian Church there where we've I I don't want to say where we had the last one but it's where we've had most of them here it's right there across from the McDonald's and right by 58 most of you know where it's at if you don't the address I believe might be in the restroom if it's not on the bulletin board if it's not just see one of the deacons or someone and they can get it to you if you're not familiar or to follow someone there certainly looking forward to that little time for us to be able to come together and just to have a little bit of Fellowship together amen that's always good amen so also as we turn there I want to just uh ask you to keep in mind and remember here brother Joshua and sister Sharon brother Joshua he flew to Congo there on on Wednesday and um then um he and I he called me and we were uh over a video over what's happened so he's got a question why I wasn't there so being the brother that he is he turned it to me and I had to speak to the pastor but uh no they they just wanted to greet us and um so you know we certainly would love to have been able to go and just to support our brother and um you know and to see the Saints I would love to see the children of God and there's always been something in my heart very special for Africa and that was something from the very beginning when God got a hold of my life I can't explain it I know I've not been there a lot but it's just something God put very special in my heart and I just love all of God's children but we're just not able to go amen each and each and every place and you know we just want to go where God wants us to be and as we're there in the scripture brother Tom Sproles from uh down there in Bluffton he he texts me here on on Monday I believe it was Monday morning and he he asked me if I would share this testimony and I'm not going to read the full thing but it's just just a brief I'm going to hit just some of the highlights but as a brother Tom he's he's one that lost his son in a car accident at the end of June so they already had the two others that passed away and then right after I was there at the end of June spoke that Sunday morning and then that that afternoon as his son was in a car accident and uh he he passed away and um so brother brother Tom was was there within the service and um this is just he asked me to communicate this because he wanted me to tell it to you all he said thank you for yielding yourself he said I cried through the whole service and I was praying God let him call me out if you still hear my prayer every thought in my head he covered and after prayer a great sadness and depression lifted from me and he said I stopped by my boy's grave and it's the first time I didn't cry I have a peace and a smile that I'll see him again and he said I had a deep sleep Sunday night the first real good deep sleep in over seven months and there's more that you know they just had a situation there even in brother Tom's Family where his granddaughter was ran over by a semi uh just five weeks ago so now it's almost six weeks ago she said seven surgeries crushed pelvis two broken hips and the broken femurs his mom was in the hospital was septic and um then there's the other needs that's there with his um daughter-in-law and so forth but you know with all that situation brother Thomas he was just communicating with me he was praying and he was looking to God and the and what he put before God is Lord if you still hear my prayer let him call my name in the service and the Holy Spirit there were those that were there that here and right in the right in the midst of of ministering the Holy Spirit called him out right in that service last weekend and and then in the prayer line how God just lifted there that depression and all that he had had been with because it would be something where depression can come in very easily is that right but I'm glad that we serve the Living God I'm glad we're not without hope we're not without a help he never said sickness he never said things wouldn't come but he says when it does I will lift him from you and I'm grateful for that we've got a real absolute and a real anchor Amen in the Lord so we just wanted to share that with you brother brother Tom's request and he had asked that I would do that so we've done that to an extent we want to look here and I want to read just a few verses of scripture this morning amen good to have brother William back and good to see I think it was uh as uh different ones that are here and maybe I'm missing some that uh so if you haven't been here in a few weeks welcome back if you're a visitor oh no I go here well if welcome back God richly bless you we're good it's so good to be together isn't it amen and verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word that they all may be one as thou father aren't in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou has sent me and the glory which thou gave us me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I want you to notice the glory you gave me now what did the glory what was that Glory that came to him it was the glory of God and what did the glory of God do the glory of God manifested the Son of God revealing the glory of God I know it's kind of a play on words but that's exactly how the prophet said it it was the god of Glory revealed in the Son of God displaying the glory of God so what is the glory it's it's God's own life that is a coming and it's unfolding in that that that ordained and that predestinated life that of the Son of God so that same Glory I have given them that they may be one even as We Are One i in them now he goes to lay this out I in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me as thou has loved them amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I want to continue that thought on the Oneness with God working within you and I'm just going to refer to a few places once again here this morning as we try to launch back into the thought here within this of the Oneness with God and Jesus brother REM says Jesus prayed that the church and he would be one like he and the father were one that the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one and at that day we would know that he was in the father fathering him and he and us that together we were one what a union a Oneness that would be to see God in his church now I want you to catch this this Oneness is to see God in his church not that we have the physical uh characteristics that the Lord Jesus had you know brother Brian goes through that wearing the long Palestinian robe out of the beard it's not the outward image that God came to express God took the form of man in order to redeem man is that right and so the image that God is bringing back to you and I and to bring forth in our lives is his own image his own likeness in a many membered body all looking different different nationalities different likes right but remember said I like cherry pie my brother likes apple I like both right but see different but yet the Same by the indwelling of his holy spirit that's true Oneness so what a union a Oneness that would be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God that's the church that Jesus is coming for and that's when his prayer will be answered that we will be one and it is the only grounds of Fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church is the Oneness of himself in the people that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way that you can have those grounds is by a union to be United with him forever so that Oneness is himself in his church not a collection of ideas not a Doctrine but himself this is God's Oneness now notice our brother Bram steps into this and I've we've read from these this as well before this is God's Oneness this is like the cliff notes to it all this is God's Oneness when the spirit that you God agrees with this word and Manifest this word and makes this word power to act the same way it did there now the Holy Spirit comes Upon Our Lives to work to bring us into agreement with the word but it's not to stop there because we can agree this is the truth right but it's it's something that's deeper than us looking at truth as far as intellectually accepting it or by the mind but it's to recognize it's more than a Bank Of Truth it is the person of Truth himself because truth is not a Doctrine truth is not an idea truth is not an ism truth is the person of Jesus Christ revealed he said I am the truth the way and the life so now it it starts with an agreement because it can't go any further there has to be first an agreeance in the word and not only is that coming to the new birth but it also is the word working in our life of where it's us agreeing with the word amen so be it Lord and inviting him and it manifests this is what the spirit of God does within our life it manifests this word and it makes this word power to act the same way it did there so the Holy Spirit him coming into our lives what does he come for because think of it there's a lot of rain there's a lot of sun that can hit upon the Earth but the Sun never came to warm the Earth it never came in the rain just to fall upon the dirt but it's what is inside of that dirt it's the seed that's that's what that's what the light and that's what the water is for is for that seed that's in there so this is where it comes down the Holy Spirit comes for the seed that is there within the body of Believers that are laying down through time that's what the word has come for this is why down through the seven Gentile Church ages it has been the Seven Stars in his right hand meaning Authority and power of the godhead reflecting Jesus Christ as the mighty conqueror the triumphant one amen the one who paid the all-sufficient price our Kinsmen it's reflecting that light into the Church of the Living God that he is the way it's reflecting the trueness Beyond man's ideas and conceptions it reflects and it draws back to a place what God desires and that is a true relationship with his children that's God's desire so he manifests this word and he makes this word power to act the same way it did there and brother Bram goes on to say let's say it together Oneness with God is to have God's spirit in you agreeing with the word all the word the whole word and to make it manifested in power now in Hebrew or Ephesians 3 20 it says now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in US unto him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ throughout all ages world without in amen so unto him so almighty God so to think of it at all because it's all God at work Jesus was not a separate person from God but it was God come down himself to satisfy his own requirements right so when he came he did not come apart from the word but he became himself the word was now made flesh for what purpose for Redemption so when the word is made flesh it is for Redemption because even when that word is being made flesh it is an announcement to the children of God Redemption is on reconciliation is on restoration is here it's on to him be glory in the church by Jesus Christ so this is how that glory is coming down into the church now Colossians chapter 1 verse 17 and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in Earth or things in heaven I want you just just settle this here he paid the way for complete reconciliation where you and I are at right now if you have been born again of the spirit of God you have experienced a reconciliation with God's Own nature in you and there's a yearning there's a drawing there's a desire for more of God wordy what is that desire it's a desire to be clothed upon with that Tabernacle that is from heaven see the yearning when a person has been filled with the spirit of God it's a yearning for more of God that's what affects and influences the decisions in our life and as we walk more with God we begin to learn from our mistakes we begin to as a child of God we begin to grow and learn to realize that every decision is to be weighed carefully not by my feelings not by My reasonings but by the word of almighty God is that right now that reconciliation it leads to heaven but notice verse 21 and you now watch how Paul was writing this and you that were sometime alienated and enemies in your own mind in your mind by Wicked works now he's not talking about this matter up here but he's talking about that nature that soul that was there we were alienated from God even man could walk in the presence of God but remember when he would offer up the sacrifice he went right back out having the same desire in him are you hearing me why because that blood could not take away and dismiss what was against it and really deal with sin nature it only covered it so that man could come in the prince of God it spoke there was going to come a perfect covering where there would be a perfect cleansing bringing a perfect Deliverance that man could walk as a Son of God again with full Authority by freedom from the innermost in his life and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled see this is tremendous it ain't something he's doing right now he is making known I've already made the way I've already made the way of the way he has been opened up hallelujah it's already you know I've got all this against me he's already paid the price what do I do stop letting the devil lie to you amen throw it down cast it down I don't care what it is throw it down I don't care what happened to this throw it down are you hearing me now in the body known as yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight who's the you that's the real you that's the Son and Daughter of God that's what real repentance is it's repenting for allowing that old nature to have its place in our life are you hearing me well brother Samuel I never did it but repentance is repenting for allowing that old nature to have dominion in our life forgive me Lord for my sins what is it it's a worth of reconciliation let me tell you something when you've got God on your side all of Heaven is behind you if you can just respond to that word go beyond your feelings press beyond the barrier [Applause] Allelujah what is it it's a word of reconciliation to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel see verse 23 only manifest the work of Calvary in the innermost part of an individual's life are you with me because listen a child of God an elect an elect child of God listen they might backslide they might get away but you can never get away from God a matter of fact if you belong to God just heard the prophet again this week he said you backslide you'll be the most miserable person there is thank you Jesus make every backslider miserable God take peace from them when their hands on the pillow Rob them from peace Lord God let them find no peace outside of you brother Samuel you are not prayed that way I ought to pray that way because the value of that Soul one soul is worth more than ten thousand worlds I'd rather have their peace taken from them here than they miss the real peace [Applause] Hallelujah so to continue in the faith that that only becomes a manifestation of what is working that has come about in that life so God came down to re-establish a Oneness between God and man so I want to read here once again from the message Oneness and these are some points that I just feel upon my heart to really read in just to kind of drag my feet a little bit on here we could preach it but I want to just I want to lay these things in notice he says the expressed image come Jesus the immaculate one the lovely one oh I love that the fairest of ten thousand the lily of the valley the rose of Sharon oh the Morning Star what is he what did he come for oh he says to re-establish Oneness between God and man so it was all it was established there in the beginning but what broke that Union what broken is doubt the word of God doubting the word and that's why brother random over and over in this message he says when you doubt the word or you get away from the word you've broken your fellowship we could preach that all on all levels when you get away from the word I'm not just talking about the word as far as letter remember the word is the very character and nature of Jesus Christ when you get away from that right there Fellowship is broken and if you're a child of God and the Holy Spirit is there he's going to correct you you know why because he loves you his desire is to do for you and to work through your life Oh Glory now notice this he says all their towers of Babel and all their other things back there didn't work all their fruits of the gardens and everything else displease God what was all of that well that was all efforts of man that was all efforts of man remember Linda Brown says it so simply when Cain came before God he came with Adam's idea right he came with Adam's idea but Abel did not come with his own idea Abel came with God's revelation of himself so God came down and was conceived in the womb of a Woman by his own self and made himself a body and become Emmanuel God With Us now I know we're very familiar with this week a minute as listening to the message we can quote that and say you know Mary had nothing to do with it God didn't even borrow an egg and and you know his both sperm and egg of God because this was a tabernacle it could not be any kind of Mary we're very much versed within that but to think of the Simplicity of how that when we see that that God so placed his word to where there was nobody else that could fulfill this word outside of God himself and when God gives a promise he's obligating himself and what God makes it in such a way man could try at it man can probe at it but there's no way for man to achieve that promise but God made the promise and he made it in such a way that it'll take nothing less than deity so they had nothing to do with the woman God borrowed their womb let me say this clearly your new birth my New Birth has nothing to do with you or a man it has everything to do with God the best works that we could give God it will never stand in his presence why because he doesn't see himself he still sees you and I but when we can accept the provided way then it is God not seeing us not our works but he sees himself on display [Applause] what do I have to do accept it accept it well I've got to clean this up you can't clean your life up for nothing okay you're like a leopard with spots on the more you lick them the more they stand out [Applause] what must I do let the Holy Spirit move in there let the blood of Jesus Christ go to work I tell you what I do I start moving into that bloodstream I'd say yes Lord be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word that's what I'd start doing because remember the angel of his presence is troubling the hottest oh my the angel of his presence is what brought back the Red Sea it's the angel of his presence that came down at the pool of Bethesda it's the same angel of his presence that's right here this morning he's troubling the waters he's opening the word why so that you can have healing foreign Jew look at this he wasn't Jew nor Gentile but God he wasn't Jew are you hearing me he wasn't Gentile he was God that's pretty powerful isn't it there's a lot of different nationalities sitting right here this morning ethnicities however politically correct you want to make it put the spin you want to put on it but it still comes down into Jesus Christ coming in flesh I think like old Charles Johnson would sing that song Charles Johnson and the revivers he got there and he said you know they're talking about a black church and a Mexican church and a this church and of that church he said how many complexions do the Holy Ghost come in [Applause] it's God in a mini-membered body he never came to highlight a race he came to establish a new race a god race Hallelujah because the race that was already here was polluted but God came down [Music] people that's going to be called by my name they'll be born in my spirit they will bear my image [Applause] [Music] glory be to God in the highest and the Gentiles was just as much to him at any time only he tried to separate a Jew for a nation so notice how God what he was doing with the Jews he God was trying to separate you you find this principle all the way down brother Brown keeps working with this in the message Oneness how that Satan if you haven't listened to the message Oneness go back and listen to it if you've listened to it go back and listen to it if you listen to it go back and listen to it you get what I'm saying because when you recognize within this Satan his tactic against the New Birth has always bring been to bring a conglomeration of a collective effort or coming under one canopy but he does it outside of God's provided way and every time God comes down time and time again he'll bring a word he destroyed the Tower of Babel scattered the people for what purpose that he might deal with man individually On and On Through the scriptures here they would want to jump come together and God would come and bring a word that would bring separation for what purpose that God might deal individually with his people because the new birth is an individual experience are you hearing me now oh look you say that he he tried to do everything to get it back and the only way he can re-establish it was come back to an individual like he was at the beginning that's the way it is today to an individual not to a denomination not to an organization not to a group of people but to an individual to re-establish Oneness between God and man so the way God works in it building up his body is with individuals that are united with him and as we're United with him we are a part of the body of Jesus Christ right we're not a part of the body of Jesus Christ because we believe the message I'm gonna preacher now we're not a part of the body of Jesus Christ because we believe God sent a prophet come on I can give you quotes on it now but we are a part of the body of Jesus Christ because we have accepted the message we have acted upon that message and that message is Jesus Christ in flesh once again in your flesh that's the message anything outside of the Holy Ghost in you is not the message the message is Christ in you not on you in you [Applause] he paid the debt of sin now in order to get this Oneness here between God and man Jesus could not do it as long as he was here in a body of Flesh he had to become the complete sin offering to take away the guilt of the believer take it away so that the Holy Ghost could come into man and make man and God won us again let me just say this to you don't wrestle with your guilt are you hearing me now if we got to drop that down in first gear we'll do it and drive today don't wrestle with your guilt there's already been a blood that's been shed you don't have to wrestle with it any longer you just have to accept what he's already done how do I accept it lay your life down I lay it all down lord but the same I'm not worthy none of us were you could take the most righteous person in the world they weren't worthy and the righteousness could never make them Worthy [Applause] um Hallelujah there had to be something to re-establish and what could it be he said God's commandment is fulfilled could an angel fulfill it he has no blood could God have fulfilled it he had no blood but God did fulfill it is that right but notice could God he's talking about as a spirit God he is a spirit is that right and God became so here Spirit God became flesh and blood in order that he could pay the debt correctly and take away sin because that's the only way what was the only way that God become flesh and pay the debt so if that's the only way that sin could be taken away is by God becoming flesh and paying the debt then the only way that that debt paid can be fully realized and acted upon it'll take the same God who paid the debt who got up on the Easter morning for that same God to now be made manifest in your life and then that is a declaration this is the way Oh Glory that produces a total separation so the new birth itself is the achievement of almighty God now notice Colossians 1 18 we pulled from he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence now when you realize this brother Brian will continue to lay the sin and Christ the mystery that's another good message to get into and just to marinate on brother Samuel that message is three hours and 45 minutes long I know but ain't nobody said you got to sit down and listen to the whole thing at once right I mean you just take take and take some at a time take some at a time is that all right take some out of time come on I know I'm talking some people some good snackers in here we graze and then we live a little bit of this well I don't eat much well let's put it all together then let's put all the I don't eat much nibble here nibble there nibble hear a nibble there must have a lot of mice in the house or something is that right oh Glory how do we get on that but notice that we might have the preeminent that he might have the preeminence now notice but before as brother Brown works with this in the message it's key he talks about the threefold manifestation of God before preeminence could ever come which would be himself coming in to his church before that could ever be it would have to be the blood is said where God has revealed himself for who he is because you see when God manifests himself it's more than somebody's testimony about it it's more than you rehearsing somebody else's word it's more than quoting a word what you have seen is the Living God made manifest before you and when you see that you let let you know that's what God has for me that's why when God reveals himself like he did through the ministry of Malachi 4 it wasn't a show you say what was that it was the glory of God that was coming down and unfolding the word of God by the promise of God by the spirit of God and what did it do to the believer to you and I as a Believer it gets our attention to the rest they still talk about it oh what breaks Supernatural was done and brother asked me we're going to go out and we're going to do this and we're going to do that and we're going to do that look at them talk about him in their conferences sitting there with women with bobbed hair and you know earrings on they could ride him like a horse no Holiness whatsoever but what they want is the power and the manifestation but that Glory was not for that to turn the world Upside Down That Glory came to release and reveal Sons and Daughters of God once again that same Glory that was poured out that same message that would be spoken would now come and live in a many-membered body so he must reveal himself first that's why I believe in the Holy Ghost I normally believe because I'm born of it but I believe it's the absolute necessity of the hour I believe his presence is the absolute necessity Among Us why what was this preeminence that he might live in people and I'm just going to refer a few places pulling these out of Christ the mystery till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them now notice to express himself through them so it's God expressing himself through individuals but the individual can look different makeups but it's the same almighty God the same nature that's on display is that right now notice here it would be him revealed and expressed now I want you to notice this it would be that revealing of himself among the people that would actually make himself known or opening up the way now God has expressed this solemn desire to indwell man once again because remember man is his place of rest remember when Solomon here it was spoken by inspiration of how but God you know you built me a house but what house is or what house will you build me what house can you build me that I can come and dwell in but it showed that God even in the types that he showed that God himself would not only prepare his dwelling place in order to redeem you and I but through that Dwelling Place when God would become man remember it was a reconciling of God and man it was God on display and through that God would Express through that life of the Lord Jesus of what he intended every son and daughter of God to be to where that God God through him by the new birth would actually come back to his rightful position within the very heart of man in that controls in that control tower that has been God's desire all along so you saw me if you say well do the same y'all now I'm tired of hearing preaching on the new birth then something's wrong because the new birth what it does it's bringing God right back to his rightful position and when you recognize that in your life you recognize your source of authority your headquarters your your place of operation that everything in your life is to be based upon would be those sacred Sands of God's grace in your life if you can accept it when the New Birth has come into your life your soul has become a watered Garden of Eden it has become a choice of God's control tower where God and His man is pride is United together the rest of this Earth that's outside of the gates but it's brought subject to the god of Glory who's residing once again in his garden [Music] foreign notice this in here Genesis 3 14 and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this now I want you to watch this he's speaking to the serpent the upright Beast all right Thou Art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon by belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life why because he yielded himself to the wrong inspiration is that right it had been okay but he yielded himself to the wrong inspiration and became a Channel of death movie could preach Thursday night service right there but notice verse 15. and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seat so now he's no more addressing the serpent the upright Beast he's addressing Satan that nature I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel so this seed that would come because you realize the woman doesn't have a seed is that right but you know so God had to give her a seed but God giving a seed remember it was God himself now supplying that egg and that sperm it was God himself creating a tabernacle for himself to dwell in and like brother man said he said once God gives it to her it now is her seed oh my you see once God has given you the Holy Ghost it belongs to you now and you belong to it amen it's who you really are and it's that which you're trying to lay a hold on it's just it's so precious and it's I want to know more about him I I want to see more I want to know you know why you finally glory be to God in the eyes you have finally been reunited and acquainted with who you really are you are always a son and daughter of God but now you've been reunited with another nature your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and the Holy Ghost has come to tie you in to where the Bible you're carrying and you are not two different people but this you and the world have become one it's an expression then out of our life and it's for this First John 3 8. he that commit a sin that word committeth is Habitual is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning but notice here's the Habit breaker for this purpose the Son of God was manifested why why was the son of God manifested say it again that he might destroy the works of the devil so as he was manifest it came to do what crushed and bruised the head right he paid the price he was manifested to take care of the sin question are you hearing me now but he made a way through that manifestation that he could be manifested in your life to destroy the works of the devil that's what the Holy Ghost does when it comes in by the new prayer it destroys the works of the devil are you hearing me it's not just an anointing that comes on you and you leave out a church and you're the same person but it's an anointing that comes and it brings a transformation on the inside you're the same at church you're the same out of church you're the same in your home why you're a genuine article of God laughs Hallelujah that's why it takes a manifestation of God that's why this message produces nothing less are you hearing me it's the manifestation of almighty god notice in Romans 11 26 and so all Israel shall be saved watch how this is worded as it is written there shall come out of Zion the deliverer out of who out of Zion who's Ryan the bride is that right amen glory be to God think about it Ruth hands it back over to the Jews and what notice what design what this one this deliverer coming out of Zion will do remember when the bride is taken away in Rapture then he moves to do what deal with 144 000. not not the whole not all of Israel will be saved only that which is of the elect in the 144 000. is that right now notice when he comes Zion he will come and has shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my Covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins now notice when I so his coming comes to deal with sin when I shall come not a thought not an idea but when I the person shall take away their sins so his Mis revealing of himself what does it do it pulls upon the elect to recognize what belongs to him that's why to the elect the elect is not just running around Oh Glory to God what a healing Revival oh my this and oh my that look listen the bride she has all those things all right but that's not the focus of the hour the message of the hour it'd be awesome to study if you just go in and type I'd love to preach it sometime that's the message and you recognize within that the real message is getting under the blood of Jesus Christ you can know every quote you can know every vernacular and still not have the Holy Ghost brother Samuel that's awful hard you'll thank me someday for it foreign but you see if you don't have something in you that wants to align with the word you'll find somewhere where you can line up to as much as you want to be is that right see God's not in the business I'm making people bribe that's not bride he don't even make bride bride bride manifests that she's bride under what his presence the unfolding of himself are you hearing me I think it's wonderful to witness but I think we go to a different level if you're trying to pull people trying to pull them try to tug on them try to pull over them just be an example because you might be pulling and tugging on something that doesn't belong yeah are you hearing me remember in all of your pulling and talking it won't be you saying glory to God my wife made it because why because I pulled on her I tugged on her I put her down I shamed her I rebuked her I did this I did that I did that and God said well my Lord I wouldn't even have to go to Calvary if you did all that what's the greatest witness listen now what's the greatest witness the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil there is no greater power and witness than the manifestation of the glory of God in your life and His glory comes down and it helps us shut our mouth when we need to shut it preach with me now I'm already on to other parts now but we better come back to today the glory of God moving in our life a Oneness with the working of his holy spirit so notice I want you to look at this in Jeremiah 31 33 but this shall be the Covenant many places we could pull in the scripture but I want you to look at this one real close this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inner parts now think about this he's not just speaking this to Israel remember Paul would pick this up and apply it to us as New Testament Believers that it's God placing his word into our lives so let me read this I will put my law into their inward parts and write it in their hearts and I will be their God oh my that word I will be there Elohim will be the source of where all Direction comes from their life I will be the one that energizes death I will be the one that directs their life I'm the same one that directed Abraham's life where Abraham reproduced my faith so will my faith be reproduced through my body of Believers through a people that are Outcast rejected and despise that they themselves even have trouble looking and having confidence in their own selves but there is the grace of God that helps you and I to override our own will and submit it to him why that the faith of Elohim might be reproduced in our lives because we are not here because of our faith oh my faith my faith my faith your faith and my faith is no count without his faith [Applause] [Music] is that right yeah now think of this they shall be unto me my people and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me I like this this is out of Isaiah 2 Paul refers to it but from the least of them unto the greatest of them saith the Lord so don't matter what stature no matter what stature from the least to the greatest no matter who it is they all shall know me in the same way for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember their sin no more now how do I think about this because you and I brother William not that I have anything in my mind I can't recall anything but let's just say you wronged me sometime all right or I wronged you however way you want to put it in my mind I have to receive the grace of God to overcome that right I have to receive the grace of God I'm going to have to pray quite a bit that don't happen that don't mean that I don't have the Holy Ghost I might have to really pray uh I'm gonna say God help me and you know I'm looking at everything but notice in with still within it all there's things sometimes that things could come back in my memory of brother William did this right there's things no matter how you and I forgive one another but you know I do believe this woman heart there is a forgiveness that where it can take the actual pain out you say how can you preach that because I'm a man that preaches by experience I'm not one who preaches by reading the word I'm a guy I'm one who knows the power of almighty God I am not asking you to do something that I haven't already experienced in my own life and sometimes the experiences are maybe even easier than what people have because I have to look at a whole group of people sometimes even in other localities where I'm at are you hearing me but this is what I'm saying God looks at me he looks at you when we have really when there has been that creation on the inside he says I don't even know you ever sinned how can that be it's got to be there's somebody different on the inside that's what the new birth does oh my you and I sometimes can look back in our lives and we struggle because what in our memories in our human Spirit we remember our failures we remember our Falls we remember our shortcomings but God is in looking on the Flesh on the spirit he's looking at the soul Hallelujah and he says your sin and iniquities I remember no more it ain't God sitting there saying I want to forget I want to forget I want to forget I want to forget I want to forget I want to forget I want to forget no it's a new creation who is it it's the same one that spoke through the whole through the prophet and said you never sinned in the first place I'll tell you that runs deeper than your nationalities that runs deeper than you know whatever that I am European this or you're this or you're that it runs deeper than my family tree it runs deeper than well I wasn't born the right way or or this happened it runs deeper than that I think of how that brother Jim Ed's wife sister Dalton she battled with that part about you know being born as an illegitimate child she dealt with that and and battled with them with a scripture and brother random I've got the picture of the handwritten note and brother Brandon wrote to Sister you heard him address in the message anyhow but he wrote to Sister Dalton because someone had brought it to brother Brown I'm in an interview and he wrote on that letter he said sister Dalton he said don't you worry about that anymore he said because the blood of Jesus Christ it corrects it all Hallelujah that is the power of the blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] thank God for that Fountain that's open aren't you let me just try to move here just a moment here just a little bit further in the message why people are so tossed about trying to get down this quote for weeks now but I don't mean I'm going to go all the way through it but I'm talking about in the old times remember this is one of those messages why are people so tossed about a hidden life hidden life with Christ why some people can't live a Christian Life why things are up and down this is a bank of those messages just like that where brother Graham is dealing with it where people will come just to the outer court or they'll come just to the inner corn but never going all the way to a real christ-centered life now he says Ezekiel in the old times when the laws were put into the Tabernacle in the ark and he said Ezekiel you know he spoke of another time and he said there's two classes of people today them same classes that's trying to do something to save themselves each one says I'll go to church every Sunday it's very good I want to be religious that's very good that's still under a law but then the other by going to church and being good is not something that you do yourself it's something in you doing it for you the holy spirit in your heart [Music] aren't you glad you got something greater on the inside when that old flesh says hey you know what take it easy tonight just sit back man and turn it on and you can just you'd be right a partaker oh boy we're getting right down there aren't we but see there's something about it it says no I've got a part it ain't just about me I've got a part maybe my a man's my lick of fire uniting with the rest of the body brings more of the godhead bodily present that's a direct quote so maybe me being there come on now could actually it'll invite the prince of God and somebody that needs Born Again somebody that needs delivered somebody that needs heal I am a part of the body of Jesus Christ oh God now notice this these people that live inside here now what he's talking about is inside the holies of holies they're always fed up that don't mean you know sometimes we say it especially Southerners I'm fed up well fed up don't mean you're full it means you're just I'm aggravated and what that means is is aggravate don't altogether mean mad it just means I'm just a little bit flustered and FL we go on and on and on you know it just has to keep going explaining that I think most you get it here but that don't mean fed up that's not what he's talking about he's talking about where the Manna itself a man of being a type of the Holy Ghost because at that manner only when it fell out here they had to go gather it and when they gathered it remember they had to consume it because if they didn't it would develop maggots now think of it where did that Manna come from that developed maggots Out of Heaven from God well why did it develop maggots because it wasn't in the right place but when the Manna was gathered and put in that golden Homer and been taken into the holiest of holies it didn't matter how many days went by it was still just as fresh as when it fell in the beginning why because it was the place where the Manna was at the Mana can fall on the flesh it'll become maggot eaten after so many times it can fall on the spirit I'm talking about the man of the Holy Ghost and it'll become maggot eaten why because it's not in the right place there is a place of preservation and that preservation is God's provided Homer where God has provided that seed on the inside that could Tabernacle deity and it's just as fresh it's just as powerful oh people say oh today brother Samuel there's all kinds of things going on in the world today and sin is so much worse but let me tell you something the devil has not gotten more power than God and God don't need another message this message has full power full Authority and full Glory we don't need another way we just need God's provided way [Applause] once it gets in there you see the Revival don't run out don't matter test don't matter trial don't matter if it's gloomy outside don't matter if that the lights go out in your spirit there's a Shekinah on the inside no matter how much the wind blows you can't blow out Shekinah because that's God it's God's own life and you say This Little Light of Mine I'm going to let it shine it's not a life that you live it's God that lived that life the same God that Lit the light on the altar is the same God that Lit the light in your soul it's the same fire of God that you're burning by you say brother Samuel how powerful is that I'll tell you how powerful it is when they came to drag Elijah out they sent 50 and what happened fire came out and consumed they sent another 50. fire came out and consuming the devil said come on out here come on out in Egypt and the token issues fire out get out of here devil I don't want nothing to do with Egypt oh it's getting cold oh I got a fire burning on the inside of me it's a Holy Fire it's your kind of Fire oh glory be to God as I go to keep feeding on that word and I'm seeing myself I'm seeing more and more of him what is it doing it's creating there a Dynamo on the inside oh brother Sammy it's getting so cold the trials against all what are you feeding on right I said what are you feeding on you must have junk wood you need to get some real wood you need to be feeding on the right kinds of Faith you can't expect to live a Victorious Life and feeding yourself on news and all the other sorts of junk you'll never live Victorious because the son of man don't care about Fox News the son of man don't care about ESPN the son of man only cares about the word and asking God oh help me Lord give me strength and you sucking down all sorts of things and praying and asking God for strength shame on you I said shame on you we have access to a full course meal Hallelujah Lord have mercy some things just kind of trickle out don't you if you think about it enough but God knows what he's doing don't say house on me help me Lord hey friends that the thing's very very simple very simple it can be a diet it can be things that maybe he isn't even named out right here but if you feel your life with all other sorts of things and don't give the word of God preeminence in time how do you expect to get any closer to God man let me finish on this the heart is the Abode of God next paragraph there the heart is the Abode of God and in the Old Testament God dwelt In His glory over the ark hard is the ark and God dwells not in the head in the heart God's not known by theology God's known by not known by mental conception God's known by an old-fashioned Sanctified born-again experience that's in the human heart yet men and women will live a good life love God by mental conception but the real hiding place is in the heart hid with Christ love God by mental care how do you know it's a mental conception because it's never expressed out here love God by mental because that oh no tell me I love God well then the love of God expresses itself because I just say it from my own life the love of God when it was expressed to me and what it did in my life it didn't leave me where he found me my mental capacity wore out a long time ago there's been a lot of things mentally as far as I said I don't think I can take another step but the love of God moves me are you hearing me now now let me end with this one because that's the real hiding place when Christ the Holy Spirit comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament oh Lord I want to be like brother so-and-so no God made you how he wanted you to be that don't include maybe all the scars and everything else but all of the hurts and everything else it's an opportunity for Jehovah Rapha to manifest his strength through your life because the testimony through your life will become a witness and a testimony to somebody else but he is in you with your temperament your temperament is your makeup is your disposition right it's just like him you took me and my brother joy and myself we're we're no doubt no doubt probably different within our temperament brother William and I and on and on we can go brother Shane and I we can go on and on no doubt we're different in our temperament so you know what that means that God never meant and said Samuel I want you to make shame like your temperament nor did he say Shane I want you to make Samuel like your temper because that guy's an odd dude man you need to know you see what we're doing we're fighting the wrong thing that's right so where's the real war at right here that God would have a group of people in a many-membered body different temperaments and no doubt if we said everybody bring pie to the fellowship one bring chocolate pie one bring this one bring that what are you bringing well I just thought everybody would like that I wonder why you thought everybody would like that because that happens to be your favorite well I'm going to bring French silk because I think everybody would like that let me tell you what everybody would like it's apple pie that thick with crust on both sides that's me you understand that's me that ain't the Holy Ghost that's me but notice Let me just let me Paul let me close with this when the Holy Spirit he comes into your heart he is in you with your temperament he's living his own life through his own will through you let me go down the next next quote there sister Brianna same message so yielded you are pink he thinks the kind of thoughts he would think through you how many has ever had to say Lord forgive me I've had some thoughts go through Lord forgive me where does that rise from he that's within you right it arises from he that's within you have you ever spoke some words that you said you know what Lord God forgive me for speaking those words why because Christ in you says those are not the words that I speak are you with me yeah right so there's there's another there's another control on the inside there's someone who's greater than well my daddy was like this and we were always like this and we were far how about stop bragging on that first birth and receive the new birth how about resting and leaning on understanding that's true I can't help certain traits but I do not intend to rest on them but the same you are Browning but my first identity is a son of God Browning is not my first identity a Son of God that just happened to live in a body that has it has the surname of Browning for what for God to manifest his glory through my life that he's an overcomer through every stream that's in the Browning family well you mean the brownings have strains just like you do dirty laundry just like you do thoughts just like you do he knows the kind of works he would do through you you are yielded and resting home what a beautiful picture a consecrated Christian yielded Christ working through you I know I keep asking for more can I read one scripture familiar scripture you know I love this scripture right here but watch how Paul words this in Galatians 2 20. we're familiar with this I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I so there's a part of Paul that is crucified with Christ yielded dead to sin yet they can still look and say that's Paul remember some of them knew him as Saul of Tarsus remember even after his conversion they didn't want to give him a chance I know about this guy I remember this guy oh man I ran around where this guy was I knew what he was stay away from him he's a bad guy right y'all know what I'm talking about but nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh in an incredible how Paul writes of himself as different from the flesh you know why because he recognizes Who I Really Am I'm a son and daughter of God Paul had all that upbringing all that teaching all that all those things but that's not who I really am because Paul could never gain dominion over himself by just that knowledge but the Dominion came through the revealing of the Son of God in his life the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Who Loved Me and gave himself for me don't you love him just ran to skip on down to that and why we're not tossed about in paragraph 18 too for to me is Christ for for me to live as Christ and to die is gain not me that liveth anymore but Christ that liveth in me Christ Living in the individual soul surrendered Christ speaks through the lips thanks through the mind sees through the eye read this next one with me acts through the temperament he doesn't step over it he acts through it Paul Andrew James Peter we're all different is that right but it was the same God manifested in their lives they didn't look alike they all didn't have the same even the way that maybe they would speak they would Minister they didn't have the same likes about things but there's one thing about it the nature of God in them projected the word through their life might have been a different color of garment but it still was a life that lined up with the word of God it's him acting through your temperament acting through my temperament but what's important is it's him it's got to be him and that requires the Paradox of the Holy Ghost the sparrow hits Hallelujah hallelujah how many want to be remembered in prayer this morning Heavenly Father Lord you know each of our needs Lord you come and you speak to us in such a personal way and you minister to our lives and to our needs Lord father I pray Lord here this morning Lord not only for those that's gathered those that will stream and hear it by way Lord archive I pray for each one Lord that God made Lord every heart and every life may they recognize the Lord if they've not come into that place Lord of a real real experience with you I pray that God that may they press on Lord may they press into that may they seek until that word Lord is made flesh in their life to where that there is a satisfying on the inside may they not look for Lord great Dynamic displays but may they surrender their heart Lord just in prayer and Lord just even in this moment just turning it Lord all over to you father may they seek for you Lord oh God to where every every part of the life Lord is now Lord in subjection Lord to where that that of the life of God on the inside there has been a transformation Lord that has taken place may may Lord God take a hold of that to realize that just as God was manifest in Christ just as God was has been manifested once again in the end time lord through the message of the hour that same God desires to manifest himself through their life Lord God in a very personal a way that he would be Jesus Christ on this plane and I pray Heavenly Father Lord God you know even behind perhaps some of those hands there's that request and Lord God no doubt Lord behind hands there's that desire as well this Lord help me Lord I pray God as a yielded vessel Lord the Lord where it's not me it's not me trying to act out but oh that the mind of Christ but have the preeminence in my life to let me Lord God yield of yielding myself to you Lord I find it Lord as I've studied you know Lord and looked at many of the things to where that God even your Prophet would call things out by the spirit of God and would reveal some of the very conditions and medical conditions in people's lives things they were dealing with and he would say your whole trouble has been your makeup your temperament Lord God it was not that you were going to come down and change their temperament but father to see how that Lord that that had been placed in their life certain things that was as it's to be yielded to you but Lord God it could work against him Lord Lord when it's not surrendered in the right way into the right hands help us Lord I pray father help us Lord God we just desire that Lord with all of our hearts Lord oh God that through our minds Lord God that

Jesus wants to be let's just say Paul but he wants to be Paul the way Jesus would be Paul Jesus wants to be Ryan but he wants to be rhymed the way Jesus would be Ryan now you know we can try to we can look at a drama you can look at it look at a script you know sometimes it'll tell you in little italicized words when you're doing a drama to maybe speak boldly or to or the front it'll tell you what you need to do here in order to actually project that but you know what God comes to do is he comes to live that part of the drama through you and I Lord what do I do how do I how do I do that how do I do the little italicized words that's for me but Lord I don't that's me it's me I'm the one it's me in the drama I was in Isaiah I was in Jeremiah I was in Ezekiel on down and on down it was me all along it was me when he walked on the road of Emmaus he made it known it was him and Moses it was him all the way down it's no different today it's him and you it's him and me so it's not my trying it's not my efforts you know what it is if I wasn't so sweaty I'd do this I'd put this on but it's God taking a hold of a surrendered vessel and God putting it on my temperament everything and God acting through it Hallelujah don't you love him oh my let's just so let's surrender to him Lord I I want to surrender more take me deeper Lord Paul would write let us sink deeper into that garment put
