[36:15] congregation speaker lord it's just to
[36:18] come into that channel oh god

[36:49] for us lord
[36:50] lord we lay aside oh god the thoughts

[36:56] because lord in truth
[36:58] we can't change them on our own lord
[37:01] but father we can just the lord yield
[37:04] our lives as instruments to you
[37:07] you lord are able to change and take
[37:09] situations that seem and look to be
[37:12] impossible lord

[37:16] power but by my spirit saith the lord
[37:20] that this mountain shall be removed
[37:22] and lord we believe that oh god we just
[37:25] desire to enter into that channel let
[37:28] the lord the holy spirit just to have
[37:30] the right away so lord we ask them if

[37:42] unworthiness lord and we look to you o

[37:48] moment that our lives would be further

[37:57] lord among us in a special way god to
[38:00] every heart lord oh granted we pray
[38:04] father we love you and thank you
[38:06] in jesus precious name
[38:09] amen
[38:11] amen if you'll turn with me to first
[38:13] john chapter 2
[38:15] amen god bless you it's certainly good
[38:17] to be in the house of the lord and good
[38:19] to have visitors here with us
[38:22] amen
[38:24] trust you've just come to
[38:26] receive from the lord i want you just
[38:30] to just a few things to be aware of is
[38:34] we have a fellowship dinner that's
[38:35] planned for the 24th of this month
[38:40] sister soriano will be coming to visit
[38:43] us here
[38:45] and she'll be with us here for a week
[38:47] so she wanted to come and visit and uh
[38:51] i'm just so thankful that was one of the
[38:52] things upon our hearts that
[38:54] god would make that possible
[38:56] it's going to be different for all of us
[38:58] because we're used to seeing brother
[38:59] roell with her
[39:01] but you know
[39:03] i look at the part of it and i spoke to
[39:05] sister
[39:06] cindy at many different times
[39:09] leading you know when brother rowell was
[39:10] going through all of that and then even
[39:12] after
[39:13] and it's true uh but brother brown tells
[39:15] us he said it wouldn't be
[39:18] the ministry would not be what it is and
[39:20] that of a good man without a good woman
[39:22] to stand behind you
[39:24] and there's much much sacrifice that
[39:26] that went into that and so we just want
[39:28] to take that time that's why we even
[39:30] purposely we wanted another fellowship
[39:33] dinner
[39:34] but we
[39:35] really tried to work for it around that
[39:37] time so when she is here that you'd have
[39:39] an opportunity to to talk to her
[39:43] so if you talk beyond 10 minutes we're
[39:45] going to hook you away
[39:47] i'm not going to call nobody's name out
[39:48] now
[39:51] no but we want you to have time of
[39:52] fellowship with her
[39:54] you know things that you can say you
[39:56] know to her because they've certainly
[39:57] been brother roel and the ministry has
[40:00] certainly been a blessing to us here in
[40:02] the assembly and um
[40:04] also i want you just to
[40:05] keep in prayer brother nathan erickson
[40:07] will be standing in here this coming
[40:10] thursday
[40:11] for me and we'll be there
[40:13] leave out with
[40:15] paul benjamin are leaving out with me
[40:17] here after the service
[40:19] we have the services they started there
[40:21] yesterday and then we have services
[40:23] there monday through
[40:25] thursday
[40:26] a part that
[40:28] that we have and i certainly covet your
[40:30] prayers
[40:31] i really mean that i have a quote here i
[40:33] would read it but i don't for sake of
[40:35] time and
[40:36] you realize that that your prayers it's
[40:39] part of the ministry that god has given
[40:42] and and brother branham in this
[40:44] statement if i could if i would read it
[40:46] but he goes on to say he says it will be
[40:48] because of your prayers there will be a
[40:50] reward on the other side and i know
[40:52] we're not doing it for reward it's just
[40:54] it's to understand we're a part of this
[40:56] together
[40:58] if you would know me i'm i'm i haven't
[41:01] even left and i'm homesick already
[41:04] you say you're only going to indiana
[41:05] well i'm i'm a homebody
[41:08] god has a way of making you a pastor you
[41:10] know
[41:11] and i i just i
[41:13] so it's it just asks that you just pray
[41:15] for us that god will just
[41:18] move direct every part every service
[41:21] for his glory
[41:23] and i certainly appreciate that brother
[41:24] richard was telling me the other i'm
[41:25] going to tell this on brother richard
[41:28] this don't have anything to do with his
[41:30] age or anything like that but he's still
[41:32] a young man but he saw brother samuel he
[41:34] said i was already praying for you last
[41:35] week i said those prayers weren't in
[41:36] vain
[41:38] they weren't in vain because of the
[41:39] studying and the preparation and
[41:42] things you know that uh going into that
[41:44] and it's just been
[41:46] months just leading into this so
[41:48] we just i appreciate those prayers and
[41:51] um
[41:52] we just love you amen miss you
[41:55] so you only be one service but i miss
[41:57] you
[41:58] i already miss you
[42:00] right now i love you i love you in the
[42:02] lord and think about the privilege we're
[42:04] going to have to spend eternity together
[42:08] amen all the all the toils of this life
[42:10] will seem nothing when we get to the end
[42:12] of the way
[42:13] amen may god bless you richly first john
[42:16] chapter 2 verse 12
[42:18] i write unto you little children because
[42:22] your sins
[42:23] are forgiven you
[42:25] for his namesake
[42:28] i write unto you fathers
[42:30] because ye have known him that is from
[42:33] the beginning
[42:35] i write unto you young men because ye
[42:37] have overcome
[42:39] the wicked one
[42:41] i write unto you little children because
[42:43] you have known the father
[42:46] i have written unto you fathers because
[42:48] you have known
[42:50] him that is from the beginning and i
[42:52] have written unto you young men because
[42:54] you are strong
[42:55] and the word of god abideth in you and
[42:58] you have overcome
[43:00] the wicked one
[43:01] amen may god bless the reading of the
[43:03] word as you're being seated
[43:06] just look for his direction in here this
[43:09] morning
[43:11] and
[43:12] as we look here into this
[43:14] scripture as we were
[43:17] moving in this a few weeks ago
[43:19] i'd like to continue to speak on that
[43:21] thought i write unto you fathers
[43:24] and realizing that when john would
[43:27] write this under inspiration of the holy
[43:29] spirit
[43:30] that
[43:31] god is setting forth
[43:33] the the full counsel that would be in
[43:35] the body
[43:36] of jesus christ at that time and in the
[43:39] every every local body i think about
[43:42] this when i look at this scripture as it
[43:44] comes to me and i think about
[43:46] brother branham's burden when this
[43:49] message would come
[43:51] and
[43:52] when you know there was the chur there
[43:53] was the tabernacle there in
[43:55] jeffersonville
[43:56] where he could freely go and you know
[43:59] minister deliver the word of the lord
[44:02] he had some other open doors that he
[44:04] could go to you know
[44:06] even when brother branham was very very
[44:08] cautious he taught us a lot and this is
[44:10] probably maybe for ministers that
[44:12] certain areas you just be very sensitive
[44:14] and watch for even when brother branham
[44:16] went to jack brother jack moore's he he
[44:19] never just took a pulpit for granted or
[44:21] is just an open opportunity he said many
[44:24] times as he went there in those last
[44:25] services in 65 he says you know he says
[44:28] they
[44:28] it hasn't really struck brother
[44:30] jack and they really don't grasp what
[44:32] this message is
[44:34] but he but brother brother branham went
[44:36] there and he says you know i try not to
[44:38] speak things you know that would be of
[44:40] such depth or or different things like
[44:42] that when i go he says but then again he
[44:44] says however god will lead
[44:47] and that's what we ultimately look to is
[44:49] the leadership of the holy spirit and i
[44:51] say that with this mind you know there's
[44:53] probably not i don't know i don't want
[44:56] to just say this but there are some
[44:58] areas where sometimes we have maybe more
[45:00] churches than other other areas but i'll
[45:02] say this in this way when we look at and
[45:05] think that there are many many lives
[45:08] that i would say in this manner that we
[45:11] can look and say they are truly fathers
[45:14] in this message
[45:16] it's not that they're fathering children
[45:17] of their own seed because we've had that
[45:20] right we've had movements where they put
[45:22] out their teaching and all it is all it
[45:24] does is produce it produces the image of
[45:27] that individual
[45:28] and that's no different from you know a
[45:30] baptist producing a baptist pentecostal
[45:32] pentecostal so we don't want to be we
[45:35] don't want to be a reproduction or
[45:37] reproducing of ourselves we want we want
[45:40] christ to be reproduced in the lives of
[45:42] the people that's why every life every
[45:45] heart that would stand even behind the
[45:48] sacred desk of almighty god and and even
[45:52] in our homes we want our lives to be as
[45:55] eunuchs to where that life itself we
[45:57] have no seed or no agenda
[46:00] of our own our only ambition and our
[46:03] only desire is to see jesus christ
[46:06] glorified
[46:08] and that's the focus when it's all said
[46:11] and done
[46:12] and i i just say you know i think of
[46:14] different brothers that's went on home
[46:15] to be with the lord i think of different
[46:17] ones uh you know that we're with i think
[46:19] of my own uh my own dad there was so
[46:21] many different things that even on his
[46:23] uh you know this will be five years
[46:26] since he's passed it i remember speaking
[46:28] to him not knowing that it was going to
[46:30] be
[46:30] the last hours that i would actually see
[46:32] him but i i i spoke to him in that time
[46:36] and i said i'd come back from a i'd come
[46:38] back from a gathering and it was so
[46:40] pressed on my heart and i just told him
[46:42] i said dab i want to thank you i said
[46:45] for not only your stand for this message
[46:47] but more importantly i want to say thank
[46:49] you for the example that you showed what
[46:52] this message is
[46:54] i said that twice and it was the last
[46:55] times that i hugged my dad i didn't know
[46:57] it
[46:58] it would be that that particular day but
[47:00] i'm saying in this way thank god for
[47:02] fathers and i don't want to just leave
[47:04] it out there that it's fathers that it
[47:05] would be as far as ministers or i i want
[47:09] to bring it down to this right here and
[47:11] bringing it down to even in this even in
[47:13] this local assembly
[47:15] god desires that there are fathers and i
[47:18] believe we have some fathers
[47:20] fathers to where there's lives that are
[47:22] are balanced in the word of god it's not
[47:25] pulled this way or that way but are
[47:27] balanced able to see things to where
[47:30] growth is taking place looking at things
[47:33] and looking past things and able to be
[47:36] an encouragement to be an example to be
[47:39] a help and because as a father you've
[47:41] passed through some of those some of
[47:44] those pathways and and it's not just age
[47:47] that does it it's experiences and here
[47:49] here is what paul is writing or john is
[47:52] writing of that i write unto you fathers
[47:54] because you have known him and that word
[47:57] no it deals with i love how it splits it
[48:00] up and i referred to this to you before
[48:02] between the greeks the greeks was always
[48:04] about knowledge what they know and they
[48:07] could re they could put back out but
[48:09] that's not how the jews know it the jews
[48:12] look at knowing and this is how jesus
[48:15] and how john by the spirit of god was
[48:17] was impressing it that was to know
[48:19] something you do not actually know it
[48:22] until it becomes outworking in your life
[48:26] so what's it speaking of is you have
[48:29] known the father in other words there's
[48:32] a relationship there
[48:35] i don't know i don't know exactly how
[48:37] far i'll get on this this morning but
[48:39] you know the relationship that is the
[48:42] purpose of the gospel of jesus christ
[48:46] it's not rules it's not do's and don'ts
[48:49] i understand when god first gets a hold
[48:51] of a life there's things you're looking
[48:53] at when we don't do this and i don't do
[48:55] that remember those are all parts of the
[48:58] working of the holy spirit bringing you
[49:00] to awareness but the whole thing that
[49:02] it's leading to is a
[49:05] relationship
[49:07] with almighty god
[49:10] that's the power that's why
[49:13] that when god came down and became flesh
[49:16] is that he might pay the price break
[49:19] down the middle wall of petition what
[49:22] was between us and him that sin debt
[49:25] that was separating there from being a
[49:28] real union the holy spirit could move
[49:31] upon the lives it did the holy spirit
[49:34] moved even upon the lives of the
[49:36] prophets it would move upon them pull
[49:39] back it would move upon them pull back
[49:42] but now when he god himself comes down
[49:46] here at the river jordan
[49:48] now
[49:49] is an opening of what adam lost in the
[49:53] beginning upon whom thou shalt see the
[49:56] spirit descending and abiding upon
[50:01] there was the announcement that now that
[50:04] relationship of god like david would
[50:08] write where
[50:09] mercy and truth are met and hugged and
[50:12] kissed together it was writing of how
[50:14] that relationship was now going to be
[50:18] restored it would be god living in the
[50:22] life and the heart of an individual to
[50:24] where it's not what i know here but the
[50:27] knowing of it is that life living itself
[50:31] out through me
[50:33] [Music]
[50:35] and this is what this is why when paul
[50:37] would write of this and i i mentioned to
[50:40] this the last time and i just
[50:42] want to say this again it is in every
[50:45] assembly we see it no matter where you
[50:47] go there's going to be fathers there's
[50:50] young men there's children and that you
[50:52] can apply that and take it even out of
[50:54] the male aspect and place it within a
[50:57] congregation there's all different
[51:00] levels of maturity that is taking place
[51:03] and it's not up it's not up to you and i
[51:05] to walk around and say well that's a
[51:07] child and you know this one's toddler
[51:09] this no with this responsibility that
[51:11] every one of us have in this hour with
[51:14] cultivating what we have right here in
[51:17] our midst
[51:18] and it's not one who's above another and
[51:21] higher up but when you really recognize
[51:23] you know let me just say this as it
[51:24] comes some there can be a life that says
[51:27] well i'm a father and people ought to be
[51:29] following me that's not a father you
[51:31] might be you might have been around the
[51:33] message for a long time but a father is
[51:35] one who's able to condem sin
[51:38] it's where pride itself is is out of the
[51:41] way it's it's not about self like i have
[51:43] something i can really help this church
[51:45] and i can't no that's not a father but a
[51:47] father sees is able to be sensitive
[51:50] seeing the need knowing the time frame
[51:52] the age the things some of the even the
[51:54] things that a person would go through
[51:57] and how that they're able to move and to
[51:58] help them paul wrote of this to titus of
[52:01] how the older men were to help the
[52:03] younger men
[52:05] is that right that's right
[52:08] he also wrote how that you know the
[52:10] older sisters are to help the younger
[52:12] sisters
[52:14] i think we could pause here just for a
[52:16] moment to where it comes to reflection
[52:18] and say god am i doing my part
[52:21] because this whole assembly
[52:23] this this part god didn't put us
[52:25] anywhere else he placed us right here
[52:28] this now becomes a responsibility a
[52:31] burden of what can i do
[52:35] oh my
[52:36] i write unto you fathers and so we see
[52:40] that of the fathers as that of of one
[52:43] that you know is maturity then with
[52:46] equity and justice and judgment and and
[52:48] i i think of how that when i was looking
[52:52] here in the scriptures and i referred to
[52:54] this quote the last time out of the
[52:55] token
[52:56] where you'll notice how that it was
[52:59] jacob who gave the direction to the
[53:01] household to get yourself ready get
[53:05] prepared for the crossing jacob was
[53:07] actually making ready little did he know
[53:10] it but he was going to have a meeting
[53:11] with god
[53:13] he knew he was back in the place where
[53:15] god had visited him
[53:17] right and the god of bethel
[53:19] so now jacob takes that direction to
[53:22] give leadership to the household same
[53:24] way that joshua did when joshua called
[53:27] there of the heads of the tribe he gave
[53:30] direction to them concerning the
[53:33] application of the token and of the life
[53:36] it shows a responsibility that we have
[53:39] within our
[53:40] lives now i i want to read here from the
[53:44] scripture in joshua chapter 4 verse 21
[53:48] and here
[53:50] as paul
[53:52] or joshua would write here
[53:55] and he would speak unto the children of
[53:57] israel now this is after they crossed
[53:59] the jordan
[54:00] and he would say when your children
[54:03] shall ask their fathers in time to come
[54:06] saying what mean these stones
[54:11] so i want you to catch this this is a a
[54:14] supernatural working
[54:17] that these believers have been a part of
[54:22] there are many within here right now
[54:26] that they were some of those who their
[54:29] parents
[54:31] had said we can't go over in the land
[54:34] the land will just swallow them up
[54:39] but now after those 40 years had passed
[54:42] away
[54:43] those had died off that you know had
[54:46] stood in opposition to the word
[54:48] there there were those because there
[54:50] were some fathers who stood with the
[54:52] word
[54:54] you understand sometimes we get to
[54:56] looking at all the negative but there
[54:57] was some positive there as well
[55:00] the positive might not have been the big
[55:02] in number but god don't need numbers
[55:07] god only needs lives that are
[55:09] surrendered
[55:11] god can do more with one life that's
[55:13] surrendered than it can with ten
[55:15] thousand bodies
[55:18] it's a surrendered it's all of the
[55:20] surrendered effort notice when they
[55:22] would come across what a supernatural
[55:23] working here that has taken place let me
[55:26] finish reading it then you shall let
[55:28] your children know saying israel came
[55:30] over this jordan on dry land for the
[55:33] lord your god i want you to catch this
[55:36] this is what you're to let the children
[55:38] your children know when they come to
[55:40] that time and they ask this question
[55:43] this is what you're to say for the lord
[55:45] your god dried up the waters of jordan
[55:49] from before you
[55:50] in other words you wouldn't be here if

[57:02] responsibility i write unto you fathers
[57:05] that there is such a reality that jesus
[57:08] christ is the same
[57:13] it's not enough to have it on a tape
[57:14] case
[57:15] not enough to have it on the back of the
[57:17] book
[57:18] not enough that it lays inside of the
[57:20] bible but it's got to be inside our
[57:23] lives
[57:24] [Applause]
[57:25] it's gotta be god with skin on that
[57:28] jesus christ is the same
[57:33] that the people of the earth
[57:35] might know the hand of the lord that it
[57:38] is mighty you're catching this
[57:40] the hand of the lord
[57:42] god uh when you look in the scriptures
[57:45] the personification how god you'll see
[57:47] that the hand of the lord the army of
[57:48] the lord all of a saint what it shows
[57:50] this is god making contact with his
[57:53] subjects
[57:55] the word becoming flesh the word
[57:57] becoming visible the word becoming
[57:59] manifest and we know that the hand of
[58:02] the lord is his strength and his power
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:07] that it is mighty
[58:09] that you might fear the lord your god
[58:11] forever
[58:13] in other words no matter where you're at
[58:16] in your generation no matter what things
[58:18] that you've been through it still holds
[58:20] to be the same way he's the same lord
[58:23] jesus
[58:25] i know there's a lot of things that's
[58:27] rose up in this earth and in this world
[58:30] that we're living in it's a lot of the
[58:32] same spirits that everyone has fought
[58:34] there's a lot of different modes a lot
[58:36] of different media a lot of different
[58:38] ways it comes but let me say this there
[58:40] is no nothing that is too great that god
[58:44] won't part the way
[58:47] am you saying brother samuel we don't
[58:49] just say that listen in this home right
[58:52] here this is what just was writing to
[58:54] that you let god be the center of
[58:57] everything in your life daddy i've got a
[59:00] test today that's no big that's not too
[59:03] big for god i've got a situation at work
[59:06] that's not too big for god
[59:08] come on somebody
[59:10] oh daddy i feel like quitting no god's a
[59:13] mighty god god's a waymaker
[59:17] oh i'm rejected ruth felt rejected but
[59:20] god's a waymaker
[59:26] hallelujah i'm like esther but god's a
[59:29] waymaker
[59:33] you know what's showing them that he's a
[59:35] mighty god
[59:37] in the face of opposition he's a mighty
[59:39] god
[59:43] hallelujah
[59:44] oh my in other words this the word
[59:47] itself let me say it like this the word
[59:50] would be such a part
[59:52] of their lives if this was what in
[59:54] speaking in joshua 4.
[59:56] this is not where the word is a switch
[59:59] where we turn it on on thursday
[1:00:02] if you do when we turn it off and turn
[1:00:04] it back on on sunday that's not what
[1:00:06] that's that don't result because if that
[1:00:08] in itself the children will never ask
[1:00:14] the children you see when it says what
[1:00:16] mean if these things some of them would
[1:00:18] not even live close to gilgal
[1:00:21] you know what gilgal is beginning
[1:00:24] that the children must see they need a
[1:00:26] beginning they need an experience with
[1:00:28] god
[1:00:30] there's got to be a rolling away of the
[1:00:32] reproach of egypt so there to be such
[1:00:35] the presence of almighty god within that
[1:00:38] home that doesn't mean you're walking on
[1:00:40] the water let me just try to just try to
[1:00:42] move that don't mean you're walking on
[1:00:43] the water that don't mean that fish are
[1:00:45] being created and god can do what he
[1:00:46] wants because he's still god
[1:00:49] let me tell you something friends he
[1:00:50] i've seen him a provider we can look all
[1:00:52] around this assembly here and there's
[1:00:54] testimonies on things like that you
[1:00:56] can't limit god
[1:00:58] but let me just tell you let me just
[1:00:59] give you a little personal testimony
[1:01:01] when there's things that's done like
[1:01:02] that in my home i look around and not
[1:01:04] only during devotion time i'll i'll draw
[1:01:07] the attention to it but as i'm standing
[1:01:09] right there there was something that
[1:01:11] came up here you know in in a way and
[1:01:13] benjamin happened to be coming in the
[1:01:15] kitchen that evening and i had this
[1:01:17] paper is this all right
[1:01:19] i had this paper from my from my
[1:01:21] insurance company and i thought
[1:01:23] this says on here they're not going to
[1:01:24] cover my roof anymore it's over i
[1:01:26] thought well
[1:01:27] they're not going to cover that it's
[1:01:28] over 15 years old now mind you
[1:01:31] mind you
[1:01:32] i already had a guy that had come out
[1:01:34] because there had been a lot of damage
[1:01:35] on them roofs out where i live i didn't
[1:01:37] know i wasn't getting no drops i thought
[1:01:39] everything good
[1:01:40] they went and inspected it and there was
[1:01:42] wind damage all over my roof and hail
[1:01:44] damage
[1:01:46] now
[1:01:47] after it's already been approved and the
[1:01:49] roof and all that other stuff see i'm
[1:01:51] reading that paper forgive me i had to
[1:01:53] read it five times
[1:01:54] because i wasn't getting what it was
[1:01:56] saying
[1:01:57] i thought i was being penalized because
[1:01:59] they were paying for a new roof for me
[1:02:01] and i went from there and i wasn't even
[1:02:03] looking for a new roof but brian fit
[1:02:05] have been left up to me look i
[1:02:07] i got everything laid out in front of me
[1:02:09] here i'm looking at the regular services
[1:02:12] counseling here and meetings i have
[1:02:14] coming up that is on the back burner
[1:02:17] i'm just being honest we all do stuff
[1:02:19] like that right
[1:02:20] probably still got the same you know
[1:02:22] shower you're trying to fix you've been
[1:02:23] promising you're going to fix it anyhow
[1:02:25] we won't go there because we want this
[1:02:26] to be positive but you know what i'm
[1:02:27] saying and i stood right there and i was
[1:02:29] reading it and to realize here on july
[1:02:32] 1st
[1:02:33] they would no longer have covered my
[1:02:35] roof because it was over 15 years old i
[1:02:37] stood right there and i after reading it
[1:02:39] fifth time benjamin walked in there i
[1:02:41] said ben listen while i read this and
[1:02:43] i'm going to explain it to you and i
[1:02:45] went through and i said this is what i'm
[1:02:47] saying he's jehovah jireh
[1:02:50] even in daddy's ignorance
[1:02:54] my ignorance push it on back i can't i
[1:02:56] want that on my mind right now i don't
[1:02:58] want to even though it's not me putting
[1:02:59] it on but i don't want to interact with
[1:03:01] people right now and all these bids and
[1:03:02] i don't want to deal with that right now
[1:03:04] i'll get to that you know in july
[1:03:06] probably july come i kick it to august
[1:03:08] because there's things there i'll kick
[1:03:09] it to this month eventually i've been
[1:03:11] kicked in next year
[1:03:14] and didn't say i'll give you that
[1:03:15] example because it's important
[1:03:19] we are we are believers friends
[1:03:22] we expect and we look to god even when
[1:03:25] we don't realize things are taking place
[1:03:28] he's still jehovah jireh
[1:03:31] and you call that attention why there's
[1:03:33] going to be times in his life that what
[1:03:35] he's got to rely on is jehovah chara is
[1:03:39] my provider
[1:03:41] [Music]
[1:03:42] he's bigger than what my outlook is on
[1:03:45] things he's greater than what i can see
[1:03:49] it's pointing them to the care of
[1:03:51] almighty god if you'll just walk with
[1:03:54] god god said i'll bless everything else
[1:03:57] you won't have to focus on this and
[1:03:59] focus on that
[1:04:05] i know sometimes there's still things
[1:04:07] you know brother brian we gotta fix
[1:04:09] i thought he was gonna bless this and
[1:04:10] then well he does he blessed us with
[1:04:12] other brothers or we can say how do i
[1:04:14] repair this toilet
[1:04:17] come on now
[1:04:19] and i wasn't just taught my brother
[1:04:20] brian your brother drake it's before
[1:04:22] they got into being you know the
[1:04:23] plumbers and things like that
[1:04:27] those guys probably look at me if i call
[1:04:28] them about something oh man brother
[1:04:30] samuel this little simple abc thing here
[1:04:35] no i don't bug him too much
[1:04:39] so it's something that the word i want
[1:04:41] to say like this i'm writing to your
[1:04:43] father's what a charge
[1:04:45] that's what joshua was telling them
[1:04:47] these memorials that are here
[1:04:49] i want it to be such within
[1:04:52] your heart in your life
[1:04:54] to when it comes to that time they ask
[1:04:57] what does this mean
[1:05:00] something that just it just turns it up
[1:05:02] what does this mean
[1:05:04] now let me go to hebrews chapter 7
[1:05:06] and verse 5 and here the bible says
[1:05:09] verily they that are the sons of levi
[1:05:11] who receive the office of the priesthood
[1:05:13] have a commandment to take tithes of the
[1:05:15] people according to the law that is of
[1:05:16] their brethren though they come out of
[1:05:18] the loins of abraham but he whose
[1:05:20] descent is not counted from them
[1:05:22] received tithes of abraham and blessed
[1:05:24] him that had the promises and without
[1:05:27] contradiction the less
[1:05:29] is blessed of the better
[1:05:32] and here
[1:05:33] men that die receive tithes but there
[1:05:36] he receiveth them of whom it is
[1:05:38] witnessed that he liveth
[1:05:40] and as i may so say levi also
[1:05:43] who received tithes paid tithes in
[1:05:45] abraham
[1:05:48] for he was yet look where he was at he
[1:05:50] was yet in the loins of his father when
[1:05:53] melchizedek met him
[1:05:58] this was think of this god already had a
[1:06:02] lot of it in other words let me just
[1:06:04] step back just a moment this is where
[1:06:07] the predestination and sometimes i don't
[1:06:09] know why that seems you know to be such
[1:06:11] a hard difficult word it's in the
[1:06:12] scriptures
[1:06:14] but predestination is where we have we
[1:06:16] have to come back and you look back into
[1:06:19] the very foreknowledge of almighty god
[1:06:22] and as you look back into that of the
[1:06:24] foreknowledge of god this is where
[1:06:26] election steps in and foreknowledge only
[1:06:29] looks it directs to the destiny that's
[1:06:32] before us in other words
[1:06:34] my children came from my loins
[1:06:39] they were not outside of me
[1:06:42] god has an elect
[1:06:45] group of people
[1:06:46] listen there's going to be listen now
[1:06:48] there's going to be others saved not in
[1:06:50] the bride
[1:06:52] but there's going to be millions say
[1:06:54] matter of fact in the mother's day
[1:06:55] message brother branham makes this
[1:06:57] statement he said there'll be people
[1:06:59] there that you didn't even think would
[1:07:01] be there
[1:07:04] i could go through different testimonies
[1:07:06] as the brothers gave me things you know
[1:07:08] and then the things in the life there of
[1:07:10] brother branham as well and different
[1:07:12] i'm not going to do that but i'll just
[1:07:13] say it in this way you know it's not up
[1:07:15] to me or you to decide who's who and and
[1:07:17] whatever i'm glad about that
[1:07:19] our desire our job is just to go is to
[1:07:22] serve the lord in our lives just love
[1:07:24] him and let his loving life flow through
[1:07:27] us let me say this to you if someone is
[1:07:30] not ordained for for the election i
[1:07:32] trust that that life that moving through
[1:07:35] my life and your life would have such an
[1:07:37] effect on them that they would be all
[1:07:40] that god has them to be
[1:07:46] come on now
[1:07:48] brother bram said the man's a catholic
[1:07:50] man
[1:07:51] if he's trusting in the church he's lost
[1:07:55] but if he's trusting in jesus christ
[1:07:57] he's safe
[1:07:58] [Applause]
[1:08:00] now there ain't just one place i can go
[1:08:01] over and over throughout the message
[1:08:03] with that
[1:08:06] that's why oh my goodness this is why
[1:08:09] that you know when we're speaking to
[1:08:11] others
[1:08:12] i don't want to tremble them
[1:08:15] if there is something that's moving and
[1:08:17] i can see there's a little opening
[1:08:19] there's little things that we can give
[1:08:21] little things to see
[1:08:23] is there a hunger
[1:08:26] for more
[1:08:28] if there's not has the prophet told us
[1:08:31] from the scriptures
[1:08:33] let edom alone
[1:08:36] he said let the methodists alone.
[1:08:41] you've got to call for a cross jordan
[1:08:43] you go across jordan
[1:08:47] [Applause]
[1:08:49] you see what liberty that brings in our
[1:08:51] life then
[1:08:52] i mean we already have liberty if we've
[1:08:54] been born again but it takes away our
[1:08:57] own
[1:08:58] self-made homemade stress
[1:09:02] they're not seeing this and they're not
[1:09:04] saying this and here we are i'm gonna
[1:09:06] have coffee with them and we're so
[1:09:08] tensed up we're ding ding ding ding ding
[1:09:10] ding ding
[1:09:13] i'm getting my quotes prepared
[1:09:18] let me just tell you what happens the
[1:09:19] atmosphere of the holy spirit is killed
[1:09:22] right there
[1:09:26] what should i do just be available
[1:09:29] just be available
[1:09:32] if god leads you to say something then
[1:09:34] say something sometimes we feel i'm
[1:09:36] going to preach now sometimes we feel
[1:09:38] that it's the things that we say it's
[1:09:41] more than what you say it's the
[1:09:43] atmosphere and the way you live
[1:09:52] hallelujah
[1:09:55] i'll just give this testimony my brother
[1:09:56] aaron sister man to set in here
[1:09:58] when they first came over and they had a
[1:10:01] and we invited them over i don't know
[1:10:02] what year that was
[1:10:04] that's a long time ago
[1:10:08] i remember that chocolate cake we had
[1:10:10] that night though
[1:10:12] remember that one
[1:10:14] addie was in a carrier
[1:10:17] we came over that night now i'm praying
[1:10:19] in my heart
[1:10:21] because
[1:10:22] i i know that god's dealing with hearts
[1:10:26] i'm praying lord what do you want me to
[1:10:27] do well that night and they could
[1:10:29] probably tell you about this there's not
[1:10:31] that i know of not one scripture or not
[1:10:35] one thing that i made and approached
[1:10:36] them but there was testimonies and i
[1:10:39] said the lord directed this if the lord
[1:10:42] willing the lord made a way everything
[1:10:44] was about him i didn't do that purposely
[1:10:50] come on friends
[1:10:52] sometimes if we're not careful we'll
[1:10:53] feel like well i let the lord down no
[1:10:55] just yield the bible says take no
[1:10:57] thought what you shall say it'll be
[1:10:59] given to you
[1:11:01] if the word if you lay in the word the
[1:11:03] word itself is in here it'll come
[1:11:05] together
[1:11:06] [Applause]
[1:11:09] hallelujah
[1:11:17] [Music]
[1:11:18] he was yet in the loins of his father
[1:11:21] when melchizedek met himself the same
[1:11:23] approach
[1:11:25] of abraham
[1:11:26] recognizing melchizedek
[1:11:30] and once you think of this
[1:11:32] when all the slaughter they were coming
[1:11:35] back
[1:11:36] and here all those kings were gathered
[1:11:39] they were all gathered together kings
[1:11:41] remember kings are those of great highly
[1:11:46] influence
[1:11:48] everybody call them influencers now
[1:11:51] they were all gathered into king's dale
[1:11:53] on the web
[1:11:56] are you hearing me now
[1:11:58] so here all these kings all these
[1:12:00] influencers all these
[1:12:02] big people
[1:12:04] but abraham
[1:12:06] in the beginning
[1:12:07] went after lot with the right purpose
[1:12:11] the right motive to bring him back
[1:12:14] he was not there
[1:12:16] because of the riches or that someone
[1:12:19] could add to him
[1:12:21] abraham knew what i have no man has
[1:12:25] added it to me
[1:12:27] when god spoke to me and god called me
[1:12:30] and i wasn't you know i didn't see
[1:12:32] everything i didn't make all my steps
[1:12:34] right right away but where i am right
[1:12:36] now it's his leadership it's his care
[1:12:39] it's his blessing upon my life i have
[1:12:42] not rested are you hearing me on the arm
[1:12:45] of flesh i have rested on the one that
[1:12:49] spoke to me
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:53] and when he spoke to me
[1:12:55] he breathed into my life there was a
[1:12:58] strength there was a confidence that
[1:13:01] went beyond my reasoning abilities
[1:13:04] to leave the livelihood of god making to
[1:13:07] leave your kindred your family all these
[1:13:10] things to leave that but it shows the
[1:13:13] effect of the word as it impressed upon
[1:13:17] abram's life
[1:13:22] god starts are you hearing me now
[1:13:24] watch how god started with abraham
[1:13:26] abraham wasn't if i could say in this
[1:13:28] way at the moment when he left the ur of
[1:13:30] kandi he wasn't fully converted
[1:13:34] but you see it isn't just something you
[1:13:35] pick from over here pick it up and drop
[1:13:37] it down there god works
[1:13:40] i hope you're catching me now
[1:13:42] god works
[1:13:44] god works all along the step of the way
[1:13:47] just like when abraham abraham went his
[1:13:50] way he came under hard time came under
[1:13:52] pressure went down there into gorier you
[1:13:55] know the stories came back god never
[1:13:58] in any way notice god's presence pulled
[1:14:00] back
[1:14:01] but now god allows a situation and
[1:14:04] there's think of this now
[1:14:06] there is that which is present that
[1:14:08] would cause abraham to look back to the
[1:14:11] land i've got to get back to the land
[1:14:14] he knew
[1:14:15] that in the land there was acceptance
[1:14:18] that's what god gave originally if i can
[1:14:21] get back to the land and when he got
[1:14:23] back to the land the bible says the lord
[1:14:26] appeared to him
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:29] god didn't say
[1:14:31] well you did what i told you not to do
[1:14:33] so
[1:14:36] silence
[1:14:37] i'm going to give you the silent
[1:14:39] treatment now he did when he was down
[1:14:40] there guerrero because he can't talk to
[1:14:41] him when he's out of the will of god
[1:14:43] see the atmosphere was not right
[1:14:48] but you see what had been impressed upon
[1:14:52] his life and god knowing what's there
[1:14:54] god's got confidence in his word
[1:14:58] and sometimes when the actions
[1:15:00] themselves do not match but god looks
[1:15:04] beneath the actions and he said it's my
[1:15:07] word that's down there
[1:15:10] that's the same way in each of our lives
[1:15:13] we might as well preach our actions have
[1:15:16] not been a hundred percent right on
[1:15:19] come on friends paul said i gotta die
[1:15:21] daily but all along the journey
[1:15:24] god's desire is to bring us into that
[1:15:27] place that he's prepared for us
[1:15:30] [Applause]
[1:15:31] my but let me pause on that here this
[1:15:33] morning because we could just labor
[1:15:34] there but notice this same approach of
[1:15:38] recognizing melchizedek bestowing the
[1:15:41] the tenth the most choice part in other
[1:15:43] words what is this is this is that of
[1:15:46] which is the most of value to bestow
[1:15:49] honor upon let me say this that meeting
[1:15:52] that that abraham had there among all
[1:15:54] the other kings would be also reflected
[1:15:58] in his home
[1:16:02] i'm not talking about because he had his
[1:16:04] picture taken
[1:16:06] i'm not talking about because well he
[1:16:09] could just talk about about that event
[1:16:12] but abraham after meeting their
[1:16:14] melchizedek now god had appeared himself
[1:16:17] in there of a bodily form but notice how
[1:16:20] did now did abraham bestow this upon his
[1:16:24] children because abraham in his life and
[1:16:28] in his walk was to keep that christ
[1:16:30] would be the center of it all
[1:16:34] so it's not just something of a past
[1:16:37] it's not just a memorial but in order to
[1:16:40] look back to that memorial in other
[1:16:41] words where abraham's children
[1:16:44] grandchildren rise up and say i want to
[1:16:46] meet that same one papa that you met i
[1:16:48] want to meet that same one daddy that
[1:16:50] you met because melchizedek didn't stay
[1:16:53] on a plane
[1:16:55] preach with me now
[1:16:57] melchizedek the bible says he was the
[1:17:00] king and priest of that city jerusalem
[1:17:03] that was the earthly jerusalem the
[1:17:05] prophet picks it up in the message
[1:17:06] shalom he said what it was he was put
[1:17:10] out of the city the way christ in the
[1:17:13] last days has been put out of the church
[1:17:20] hallelujah
[1:17:22] our lives have been made a place for
[1:17:24] melchizedek to come and dwell
[1:17:27] our homes are made a place for
[1:17:29] melchizedek to come and dwell
[1:17:36] because that's the word the king of
[1:17:38] salem salem means peace but if you don't
[1:17:40] got the peace giver you have no peace
[1:17:44] hallelujah
[1:17:47] think of this
[1:17:49] levi let me come back to the to the
[1:17:51] statement there levi
[1:17:53] paying tithes to melchizedek
[1:17:55] just didn't happen in other words this
[1:17:57] spoke
[1:17:58] of what every one of the sons of abraham
[1:18:02] would do
[1:18:03] when they would meet god
[1:18:07] personally right
[1:18:09] now i'm on the job i'm going to just
[1:18:11] kind of trying to slow down but we'll
[1:18:13] see
[1:18:16] i want to just drive this point home
[1:18:19] it didn't just
[1:18:22] happen
[1:18:25] it just didn't
[1:18:28] well if they're elected
[1:18:30] well if they're predestinated
[1:18:32] you sound like god's a gambler
[1:18:35] shame on you
[1:18:36] god's not a gambler
[1:18:39] when god sets forth his word he's active
[1:18:41] with his word
[1:18:43] when god with his children he's active
[1:18:46] with his children
[1:18:47] god said i'm invested in my children my
[1:18:50] children are going to know my name my
[1:18:52] children are going to know my ways my
[1:18:54] children are going to know me
[1:18:56] [Applause]
[1:18:58] i'll text bomb their phone my children
[1:19:00] are going to know me
[1:19:05] no they need something for me they're
[1:19:07] going to know me
[1:19:10] they're going to know me in many
[1:19:11] different ways you see because i'm not
[1:19:13] only jehovah jireh i'm jehovah rafa
[1:19:16] [Applause]
[1:19:18] i'm jehovah's sitconu i'm jehovah shalom
[1:19:21] they're going to know me because all
[1:19:22] these things throughout their life and
[1:19:24] their walk they are going to know me i
[1:19:26] am going to manifest that i am the
[1:19:29] all-sufficient one
[1:19:35] it just didn't happen like with abraham
[1:19:37] god just didn't say and speak to abraham
[1:19:41] and then just say we'll put it on
[1:19:43] autopilot buddy and you just make it
[1:19:44] there no
[1:19:46] god dealt with and worked with and
[1:19:49] ministered to abraham
[1:19:52] [Music]
[1:19:54] sometimes let me just say this sometimes
[1:19:56] when we look at the word the word being
[1:19:59] impactful remember brother brahma will
[1:20:00] tell us like this he said you might have
[1:20:02] had a man he said that preached the word
[1:20:04] to you and that man no longer follows
[1:20:06] this word power transformation he said
[1:20:09] but remember it wasn't the man that
[1:20:10] changed your life it was the word of god
[1:20:13] that came forth it's the word that holds
[1:20:15] transforming power in it
[1:20:18] say brother samuel what he's saying that
[1:20:20] as a parent as believers as brothers and
[1:20:23] sisters we glorify in the lord jesus
[1:20:26] christ we know this word is effective
[1:20:29] the word is a seed that the sore went
[1:20:31] forth to sow it has within it the power
[1:20:35] of almighty god to bring it to pass in
[1:20:38] its season and it's time
[1:20:41] oh help me preach
[1:20:42] i might just have to water it a little
[1:20:44] bit i might have to water and say hey
[1:20:47] you want to go fishing tomorrow
[1:20:50] i would do too maybe you can call down
[1:20:51] there and get me out of some meetings
[1:20:54] you say how are you watering that right
[1:20:56] there because i'm watering it that seed
[1:20:59] by a relationship as well
[1:21:03] that's how god waters his word not
[1:21:05] everything happened in abraham's life
[1:21:07] right away but god was right there
[1:21:09] because it's the presence of god that
[1:21:11] brings the word of god to past i write
[1:21:13] unto you fathers
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:19] everything everything if you could talk
[1:21:22] with abraham and abraham
[1:21:24] repair
[1:21:26] appeared on uh good morning shalom
[1:21:30] if abraham appeared on there
[1:21:32] and you asked abraham abraham
[1:21:34] you know we got all these parenting
[1:21:35] magazines around and we got this one and
[1:21:38] we got that one and we got this and you
[1:21:40] know it tells them to do this and tells
[1:21:42] them to do that abraham what would you
[1:21:43] say the most important thing is i would
[1:21:45] say the most important thing is in
[1:21:48] everything let it be centered around if
[1:21:50] christ is a centered then let everything
[1:21:52] you do or say be set up and pointing
[1:21:55] with an expectation for their meeting
[1:21:58] with melchizedek because i can provide
[1:22:00] them with clothes i can provide them
[1:22:02] with a house i can provide them with
[1:22:04] water to drink but it will take him to
[1:22:07] provide the bread and the wine that they
[1:22:10] have needed to live victorious
[1:22:14] so what is it not putting the emphasis
[1:22:17] on the wrong things
[1:22:22] not putting the emphasis on the material
[1:22:24] things
[1:22:29] but the emphasis
[1:22:31] is on the spiritual things
[1:22:34] now listen friends these things that
[1:22:36] god's bringing them we're bringing them
[1:22:38] and they rejoice our hearts and even
[1:22:40] sometimes as they're cutting our lives
[1:22:42] but it ought to be things that we we
[1:22:44] want to take into our lives and really
[1:22:46] reflect
[1:22:48] and reflect and say god
[1:22:50] change me evaluate things it's in my
[1:22:52] life if my priorities are wrong
[1:22:56] if i've got the wrong order
[1:23:00] then let it be lined up everything that
[1:23:02] we're doing
[1:23:03] is focused upon that meeting with
[1:23:06] melchizedek
[1:23:09] well brother samuel i can't i can't
[1:23:11] cause them to meet melchizedek but you
[1:23:14] are missing me now
[1:23:15] before the lord jesus came that was a
[1:23:17] promise of the coming messiah isaiah 7
[1:23:19] 14 isaiah 9 6 on and on we can go with
[1:23:22] prophecies genesis 3 15 all those were
[1:23:24] prophecies right but there was also a
[1:23:27] prophecy that lay in the word that
[1:23:28] before and in the midst of that coming
[1:23:31] there would be one who would be a
[1:23:34] forerunner
[1:23:36] and the one who was a forerunner would
[1:23:38] receive the holy ghost
[1:23:41] in his mother's womb and what was the
[1:23:43] purpose to do prepare
[1:23:46] the way of the lord
[1:23:50] that's parenting
[1:23:52] i write unto you fathers that's also
[1:23:55] that's to every one of us as you work as
[1:23:57] we work in this assembly and others and
[1:23:59] listen listen i'll just say it like this
[1:24:01] okay
[1:24:02] i look at it i am not
[1:24:05] i know there can be pride that god lord
[1:24:07] i know there's no doubt there's still
[1:24:08] pride in my life that you're working out
[1:24:09] but let me just tell you something
[1:24:14] i want god to work and move
[1:24:17] through every individual
[1:24:20] and i'll tell you this right now my
[1:24:22] children it ain't that oh it's all got
[1:24:24] to come from me they they they they're
[1:24:26] they're with me but i believe that there
[1:24:29] are examples there's effects of this
[1:24:32] word all around
[1:24:35] brother samuel how do you feel i trust
[1:24:37] you feel the same way these young people
[1:24:39] when they come to my house i look at
[1:24:41] them as my children
[1:24:43] i don't care if i don't see them they're
[1:24:45] called out in prayer daily
[1:24:48] and if i find out where they work i'm
[1:24:50] going
[1:24:53] even when i find others i find out where
[1:24:55] they work and their backlash i just met
[1:24:57] one i usually walk on the trail uh out
[1:25:00] there at a certain park and i kept
[1:25:02] looking at this this one uh a lady i
[1:25:04] kept looking at her i thought who in the
[1:25:06] world that looks like mindy that looks
[1:25:08] like her

[1:25:26] certain kitchen somewhere you say you

[1:25:30] times and i didn't eat nothing but i
[1:25:32] found out that they worked there i'm not
[1:25:34] just trying to do something friends i
[1:25:35] didn't go there every day but sometimes
[1:25:38] what people need is a personal contact
[1:25:41] with jesus christ
[1:25:47] not just tracks not just tracks not just
[1:25:50] the bible they need the bible walking in
[1:25:54] flesh

[1:26:02] lives so you don't feel oh i didn't say

[1:26:06] come right out and say you must be born
[1:26:08] again oh i praise god i told them that
[1:26:12] no no god's trying to get us away from
[1:26:14] those
[1:26:15] condemnation of well i didn't say this
[1:26:18] and i didn't say this oh i must be a
[1:26:20] compromiser you're not a compromiser
[1:26:23] the word of god means everything to you
[1:26:26] [Applause]
[1:26:29] it's opening that channel
[1:26:39] we all listen friends we all learn and
[1:26:41] we're all here growing we're not here
[1:26:43] well i'm this and i'm no no we're all
[1:26:45] here to learn father every one of us
[1:26:48] every one of us lord

[1:26:53] continues to teach me how to be a better
[1:26:55] daddy how to be a better husband how to
[1:26:58] be a better pastor there's things that
[1:26:59] god has opened up and i thought good
[1:27:01] lord i was causing myself so much stress
[1:27:04] well maybe nobody else
[1:27:07] ain't been nobody else
[1:27:08] but i'll tell you you know what i'll
[1:27:10] tell you what it really about called i'm
[1:27:12] ready to do a praise break when those
[1:27:13] things happen like that and i see it you
[1:27:14] know why it's deliverance of self
[1:27:18] who did brother branham say is the one
[1:27:20] that gets in the way william branham not
[1:27:22] brother branham william branham
[1:27:25] was made to claire he never said brother
[1:27:27] branham gets in the way william branham
[1:27:28] gets in the way
[1:27:31] we can put our name there too
[1:27:35] now notice this the bible says in
[1:27:37] genesis 18 17
[1:27:39] our glory and the lord said
[1:27:42] now i want you to think back now to this
[1:27:44] we're looking at israel melchizedek
[1:27:47] and notice how god appears in genesis 18
[1:27:50] verse 17 and the lord said shall i hide
[1:27:53] from abraham that thing which
[1:27:56] i do
[1:27:58] saying that abraham shall surely become
[1:28:00] a great and mighty nation and all the
[1:28:02] nations of the earth shall be blessed in
[1:28:04] him
[1:28:05] for i know him now notice this i know
[1:28:09] him he's not just talking about like an
[1:28:12] acquaintance or you know me and brother
[1:28:13] joshua we met we met here some years ago
[1:28:15] how many years have been now
[1:28:17] seems like forever but how many years
[1:28:20] i mean that a good way
[1:28:21] i mean a good forever
[1:28:23] sometimes you know people five minutes
[1:28:24] seem like forever
[1:28:26] six years then what god's talking about
[1:28:29] with abraham
[1:28:30] oh that i just met him he knew him
[1:28:34] before the foundation of the world
[1:28:37] what he knew him he knew him now it has
[1:28:42] become into an expression i know
[1:28:45] him
[1:28:48] who's he talking about
[1:28:50] abraham
[1:28:51] his son
[1:28:53] his child
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:28:59] that he will
[1:29:01] command his children and his household
[1:29:04] after him that they shall keep the way
[1:29:06] of the lord to do justice and judgment
[1:29:09] that the lord may bring upon abraham
[1:29:12] that which he hath spoken
[1:29:14] of him
[1:29:17] now i want you just to think of this
[1:29:19] here
[1:29:20] just for a moment let me just
[1:29:22] i i wasn't going to pull this up but i
[1:29:24] want to just refer to it i'll probably
[1:29:26] pick it up again and the next time
[1:29:28] in genesis 12
[1:29:30] verse
[1:29:31] verse 1
[1:29:32] and the lord said unto abram get me out
[1:29:35] of that country and from thy kindred and
[1:29:37] from thy father's house unto a land that
[1:29:39] i will show thee
[1:29:41] and i will make the make of thee a great
[1:29:44] nation
[1:29:46] this is what i'm going to do
[1:29:49] i'm not asking your permission this is
[1:29:51] what i'm going to do this is what i know
[1:29:54] of you
[1:29:56] abraham might have been looked at and
[1:29:58] said this package
[1:30:00] you got the wrong house my wife's barren
[1:30:06] god said you can't rts this package
[1:30:10] i'm gonna make now did abraham
[1:30:12] understand that no
[1:30:15] but he had faith
[1:30:18] in the i am who was speaking
[1:30:21] it isn't that he understood how all of
[1:30:24] this was going to come to pass
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:27] understanding will come in its season
[1:30:30] and its time as we have need of it

[1:32:14] we'll sit down and talk about it
[1:32:20] catching you see all these things it
[1:32:22] isn't like oh let's lay it out what time
[1:32:24] should it be the times vary
[1:32:27] i don't know we're going to go here all
[1:32:28] the time the time is very but this is
[1:32:30] you say well how do i know that's why
[1:32:33] living close to your children
[1:32:36] that's why living close to your children
[1:32:39] a shepherd ought to smell like the
[1:32:40] sheep.
[1:32:46] absolutely
[1:32:47] i don't believe i'm going to preach i
[1:32:50] don't believe a pastor ought to be just
[1:32:51] a figure that shows up
[1:32:54] but i don't do it because well i just
[1:32:55] believe it that way i love and i'm not
[1:32:57] saying other brothers listen friends
[1:32:58] sometimes maybe a brother there are
[1:33:00] certain things they have to put in place
[1:33:01] maybe would say different things you
[1:33:03] understand don't put no judgment on
[1:33:04] anybody i'm just speaking right here to
[1:33:06] me i enjoyed that and i believe i'm just
[1:33:09] going to say i believe every other one
[1:33:10] does too you love being with the people
[1:33:12] of god there's nothing greater i love
[1:33:14] than fellowshipping with god's children
[1:33:17] especially you all there's no other
[1:33:19] place i'd rather preach and minister
[1:33:23] right here but it's to it's to get right
[1:33:25] down with it and you know when we're
[1:33:27] looking at things and we're talking with
[1:33:29] one another because let me tell you
[1:33:31] something you'll never help nobody if
[1:33:32] they don't know you don't love them
[1:33:41] i don't know where time goes do you
[1:33:44] don't worry we're not an eternity
[1:33:47] sometimes you think
[1:33:54] let me just refer let me refer to this
[1:33:56] right here
[1:33:57] in verse two and i will make of thee
[1:34:00] a great nation and i will bless thee and
[1:34:03] make thy name great
[1:34:05] and thou
[1:34:07] shalt
[1:34:08] be a blessing
[1:34:12] this word blessing
[1:34:16] it is a different word usage than
[1:34:18] blessed
[1:34:20] but blessing means the source of
[1:34:24] blessing
[1:34:25] god was speaking to abraham and let him
[1:34:27] know you are the channel that i'm gonna
[1:34:31] come into your household
[1:34:34] i am the vine you are the branches
[1:34:38] you are going to be the doorway that the
[1:34:41] blessings of god all that i have
[1:34:44] pronounced it's gonna come through your
[1:34:46] life it won't be not you doing it i will
[1:34:50] make i will make i will make so you open
[1:34:54] the door and invite me in and i do what
[1:34:58] you can i'm the one who brings the word
[1:35:01] to pass
[1:35:07] thou shalt be a blessing a source
[1:35:11] of life
[1:35:13] so now because of that then we when we
[1:35:15] read let me go back to verse 19 of
[1:35:18] genesis 18 for i know him he will
[1:35:19] command his children and his household
[1:35:21] after him that they shall keep the way
[1:35:23] of the lord to do justice and judgment
[1:35:25] and the lord that the lord may bring
[1:35:27] upon abraham that which he has spoken of
[1:35:29] him so
[1:35:31] there's going to be more channels
[1:35:33] that'll be sources of blessing
[1:35:38] right through abraham's life
[1:35:40] it didn't just happen it didn't just oh
[1:35:44] oh
[1:35:46] melchizedek who's melchizedek
[1:35:51] oh
[1:35:54] the prophet
[1:35:55] oh what's a prophet
[1:35:57] let me just say this and i'm not here to
[1:35:58] step on toes maybe it'll stomp on a
[1:36:00] little bit
[1:36:01] but if your children sitting here
[1:36:04] if they don't know
[1:36:05] about the message
[1:36:07] you didn't just bring them to sunday
[1:36:08] school or a youth meeting
[1:36:11] and drop them off
[1:36:12] it's your responsibility
[1:36:17] i'm preaching straight now
[1:36:20] i ain't saying you got to stand up in
[1:36:21] your living room you got to have a
[1:36:23] podium and you start preaching i tell
[1:36:24] what i'm saying
[1:36:25] but i'm saying that these are things
[1:36:27] right now that ought to be in the home
[1:36:30] hearing
[1:36:31] the message should not be a foreign
[1:36:33] thing
[1:36:35] it should not be a foreign thing where
[1:36:37] your your children know this is daddy's
[1:36:39] prayer time this is mama's prayer time
[1:36:43] are you hearing him he's not putting on
[1:36:44] a show it might not be a foreign thing
[1:36:50] again we can quiet now but that's all
[1:36:51] right
[1:36:52] that's all right
[1:36:54] it's a truth
[1:36:55] well you know if they want to know about
[1:36:57] it they can just they can just listen to
[1:36:59] a tape it ought to be something that
[1:37:01] that it should not be foreign in other
[1:37:03] words not just waiting till they come to
[1:37:06] the house of god
[1:37:11] we're talking about marriage oh i'll
[1:37:12] wait for brother salmon to go over you
[1:37:14] ought to be instructors on that as well
[1:37:19] watching over that well my this is
[1:37:21] that's a total difference
[1:37:23] you understand we are keepers my
[1:37:25] brothers and sisters i'm not talking
[1:37:27] about that in our perfection don't
[1:37:29] anybody just start hanging your head i'm
[1:37:31] talking about a responsibility that we
[1:37:33] have we must be intentional
[1:37:46] let me close with this
[1:37:52] your attitude
[1:37:54] towards christ out of the hebrew series
[1:37:57] will make a great impression on what
[1:37:59] your children will be
[1:38:04] now he didn't just say
[1:38:06] all that i say all that you say all that
[1:38:09] you well i no it's your attitude
[1:38:13] let me just say what attitude is
[1:38:14] attitude
[1:38:17] it's a way of thinking
[1:38:19] feeling that's reflected
[1:38:21] in a person's behavior
[1:38:27] church again
[1:38:31] man if i could just stay home tonight or
[1:38:33] stay home today you know
[1:38:36] i tell you yeah my
[1:38:38] my back's hurting me well usually mine

[1:38:43] times too i'm not making a lot of
[1:38:44] anybody's you understand because i know
[1:38:46] there's i know there's some right here
[1:38:47] that that set with it that
[1:38:50] very serious
[1:38:52] but you understand
[1:38:54] your children
[1:38:56] are only going to do what you do
[1:39:01] can i give you a little testimony here
[1:39:05] you know i've mentioned different things
[1:39:07] about brother ron spencer and you know
[1:39:08] brother ron dealing with stage four
[1:39:11] brother ron
[1:39:13] was going down there and there's been
[1:39:14] times on the sunday mornings when i've
[1:39:16] i've just felt led on my heart to text
[1:39:18] him on a sunday morning and right then
[1:39:19] there's a time of
[1:39:21] sickness and things and
[1:39:23] but here he was he was getting ready he
[1:39:24] had to go preach a meeting and i think
[1:39:26] it was a it was a saturday night service
[1:39:28] there brother sean martin's meeting
[1:39:31] he had to pull over on the road eight
[1:39:33] times
[1:39:35] and threw up eight times
[1:39:38] and they said
[1:39:41] you know
[1:39:43] are you sure he said i'm he said i'm
[1:39:45] going to stand there and preach he said
[1:39:46] because satan knows if all it takes is
[1:39:48] eight times for me to throw up and i
[1:39:49] won't come to church he'll make sure
[1:39:51] eight times will be
[1:39:55] brother say we're saying what are you
[1:39:56] saying i'm trying to show you this is
[1:39:59] not dna of spencer it was not dna of
[1:40:02] brother branham it's not your dna or my
[1:40:04] dna i'm talking about there are things
[1:40:06] that we've got to override our flesh
[1:40:12] our feelings brother branham said his
[1:40:14] flesh came to him and said your throat's
[1:40:16] a little scratchy tonight why don't you
[1:40:18] stay home brother brown says i rose up
[1:40:20] on the inside i promised brother neville
[1:40:22] that i would be there
[1:40:27] look we're only going to get whatever
[1:40:29] seeds we sow in
[1:40:35] let me just try to finish this quote
[1:40:36] we'll pick it up next time
[1:40:39] your attitude towards christ will make a
[1:40:41] great
[1:40:42] impression
[1:40:44] on what your children will be
[1:40:46] your life that you
[1:40:48] live before your family
[1:40:51] will make an impression on what your
[1:40:53] children
[1:40:54] will be
[1:40:57] notice the things that brother branham
[1:40:59] is dealing with
[1:41:00] it's the life
[1:41:02] that's lived
[1:41:04] before
[1:41:07] not just what we say
[1:41:09] but the life
[1:41:11] that's lived before
[1:41:14] and i can tell you
[1:41:16] this message will produce a life not a
[1:41:19] conforming
[1:41:21] you can conform to this message and
[1:41:23] still not have
[1:41:24] the real life
[1:41:28] this is not a conforming or reforming
[1:41:31] message
[1:41:33] it's a message from the throne of god
[1:41:38] listen god had a channel in this age
[1:41:41] like he had of abraham a channel that
[1:41:44] was ordained in the word that would be a
[1:41:47] channel that the source of blessing
[1:41:51] could move through
[1:41:54] to this age
[1:41:56] aren't you glad
[1:41:58] but now from that
[1:42:00] there's now there's channels that god
[1:42:03] has that has received of this life not
[1:42:07] just received books not just receive
[1:42:10] tapes not just receive knowledge of it
[1:42:12] but receive a change on the inside of
[1:42:16] their lives
[1:42:18] and are a manifestation of this word
[1:42:24] that's a source
[1:42:26] of blessing
[1:42:28] it becomes a channel
[1:42:30] for god to move through
[1:42:32] for god to work through
[1:42:34] our attitude
[1:42:37] will affect
[1:42:38] our children
[1:42:41] that's what lays
[1:42:44] the impression
[1:42:48] that's why not just the things that we
[1:42:50] do or we say
[1:42:52] but we
[1:42:54] do don't do as i say
[1:42:57] only
[1:42:58] but do as i do
[1:43:02] remember the little boy
[1:43:04] here's a little boy was walking
[1:43:07] he was doing this
[1:43:10] his daddy
[1:43:12] looked behind him and said
[1:43:13] what are you doing junior what are you
[1:43:15] doing
[1:43:16] he said daddy
[1:43:18] i'm just following your footsteps daddy
[1:43:20] was stumbling around drunk falling in
[1:43:21] the snow bank falling that snow bank he
[1:43:23] said daddy i'm just following your
[1:43:25] footsteps
[1:43:26] i can only follow the footprints that
[1:43:29] you make for me
[1:43:32] make sure every footprint is pointing
[1:43:34] till melchizedek
[1:43:36] if your life is heading this way this
[1:43:38] morning you don't have to keep going
[1:43:39] that way
[1:43:40] god is not here to bury you in oh i
[1:43:43] failed here i failed it that's not what
[1:43:44] god is doing
[1:43:47] let me tell you something esther you can
[1:43:49] arm yourself
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:43:53] armed with what with the baptism of the
[1:43:55] holy ghost
[1:43:57] and where the enemy has tried and said
[1:44:00] i'm going to slay all of your kindred on
[1:44:02] this day but here esther was moved
[1:44:07] if i die i die
[1:44:10] but i'm going to get to his throne
[1:44:13] there's a need
[1:44:17] mordecai told her mordecai said if
[1:44:20] you're not going to be the channel god
[1:44:22] ain't going to let his word be defeated
[1:44:24] he'll find another channel
[1:44:27] that's right in the word
[1:44:29] what did it do it rolls up esther
[1:44:31] realized wait a minute i am placed here
[1:44:34] for such a time as this
[1:44:37] [Applause]
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:40] if i perish i perish
[1:44:43] she went in and became a channel of
[1:44:46] deliverance for her people
[1:44:48] [Music]
[1:44:51] that one move
[1:44:54] hung haymon on his own neck
[1:44:58] that one move
[1:45:00] where he said i'm going to kill their
[1:45:02] children i'm going to get in the
[1:45:03] households i'm going to destroy one move
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:10] the very gallow he made
[1:45:12] little did he know he was going to be
[1:45:14] hung on that rope
[1:45:17] [Applause]
[1:45:19] what rose the boldness and the strength
[1:45:22] and the courage in esther the word of
[1:45:24] the lord
[1:45:26] that would remind her who she was
[1:45:29] and with that god's word is certain
[1:45:32] if you're not going to be a channel
[1:45:34] in other words this is why the scripture
[1:45:36] reads it deliverance shall arise from
[1:45:39] another place
[1:45:41] one way or another god's gonna deliver
[1:45:44] his people
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:48] so i say why not now
[1:45:51] why not us
[1:45:53] why not me
[1:45:55] why not right now
[1:45:58] let our attitude let everything rise
[1:46:01] let it rise within our hearts
[1:46:04] i write unto you fathers
[1:46:08] you see friends it's a moment it's a
[1:46:09] time to just pause and just to stop and
[1:46:12] just to think and consider because if
[1:46:14] you're headed this direction you don't
[1:46:15] have to keep heading that direction
[1:46:17] you said brother samuel how do i stop
[1:46:19] repent
[1:46:20] and really repent
[1:46:22] real repentance is not i'm in a mess boy
[1:46:25] i've got all this in my life look how my
[1:46:27] life that ain't repentance
[1:46:29] that's called worldly sorrow pitying
[1:46:31] yourself
[1:46:34] i've got to preach it as you bring it to
[1:46:35] me that's scriptural
[1:46:37] paul called that worldly sorrowing and
[1:46:39] there's times listen there's times where
[1:46:41] we get in our penny parties
[1:46:43] but that ain't repentance
[1:46:45] repentance is where there's a the bible
[1:46:48] said godly sorrow
[1:46:50] in other words you're looking unto him
[1:46:54] and you realize what he has done for you
[1:46:57] even when you have not acknowledged him
[1:47:00] that he has watched over your life he
[1:47:02] has kept you alive for this moment that
[1:47:05] you might have another opportunity to
[1:47:09] receive his grace
[1:47:13] [Applause]
[1:47:16] that brings godly sorrow to realize
[1:47:19] me
[1:47:20] little me lord jesus what you did for me
[1:47:24] now you're coming to the revelation of
[1:47:25] jesus christ it's starting to break the
[1:47:28] effects of it is starting to move what
[1:47:30] it's pointing and recognizing him
[1:47:34] who bore my shame
[1:47:43] jesus
[1:47:44] yes
[1:47:46] show us the father
[1:47:48] and it sufficeth us
[1:47:50] have i been so long
[1:47:53] with you
[1:47:54] when you have seen me
[1:47:56] you have seen
[1:47:58] the father
[1:48:02] oh how i love him
[1:48:04] how i adore him
[1:48:06] what condensation
[1:48:09] bringing us redemption
[1:48:12] that in the dead of the night with not
[1:48:15] one faint hope inside god
[1:48:18] gracious tender
[1:48:20] laid aside his splendor
[1:48:23] stooping to woe to win and save my soul
[1:48:29] hallelujah
[1:48:31] his presence
[1:48:32] and that in just something back 2000
[1:48:34] years ago that was acted out from the
[1:48:36] mind of god he's a messiah right here
[1:48:39] this morning the living god the holy
[1:48:42] spirit the same almighty god the father
[1:48:45] revealing himself in this hour to turn
[1:48:48] our lives and our hearts
[1:48:50] unto him
[1:48:56] and for every one of us
[1:48:59] that god man what's a complete
[1:49:01] relationship
[1:49:03] and for every life
[1:49:05] to think
[1:49:07] or we can stop
[1:49:09] and i believe it's i believe it's for
[1:49:10] our lives as a believer
[1:49:13] is to let our lives be examined by the
[1:49:15] word
[1:49:17] and say god
[1:49:18] if there's something not hitting the
[1:49:19] mark i'm not i'm not come here to be
[1:49:21] telled what a good guy i am right
[1:49:25] we've not been come to told
[1:49:27] we are short we want our shortcomings
[1:49:29] showed up
[1:49:31] right we're family here
[1:49:33] come on we're family we want the word of
[1:49:35] god to come down i want my shortcomings
[1:49:37] to be exposed
[1:49:40] because the same one who's exposing them
[1:49:42] he's a faithful father
[1:49:45] he not only deals with where we're at
[1:49:47] the prophet said but catch us where we
[1:49:49] need to be
[1:49:52] in other words he's not one who says
[1:49:54] what you did that defines who you are
[1:49:56] that's who you'll always be but i'm i'm
[1:49:58] no longer i no longer i've grown up and
[1:50:00] you get my kindergarten picture no
[1:50:01] longer matches me that ain't how god
[1:50:03] looks at things god don't put you in a
[1:50:05] box and say this is who you are
[1:50:08] but the word moses
[1:50:11] changes us
[1:50:12] shapes us there's things that we even
[1:50:15] look at differently right now
[1:50:17] than we did in the past
[1:50:20] you know why
[1:50:21] because of his grace
[1:50:23] no wonder david said i want to abide in
[1:50:25] your tabernacle i want to behold thy
[1:50:28] beauty of that character of that glory
[1:50:30] of thy person
[1:50:32] that i might inquire in your temple
[1:50:35] then i might say lord
[1:50:37] as you reveal on yourself lord
[1:50:39] change my life lord i give myself to you
[1:50:42] lord just continue to give ourselves to
[1:50:45] him
[1:50:47] i will make of thee
[1:50:49] i will make of thee
[1:50:51] i will make of thee
[1:50:54] god what do i have just be it just be a
[1:50:56] channel
[1:50:57] just be a channel
[1:50:58] just drink drink push out i'll do it
[1:51:01] it'll be me doing it
[1:51:04] oh don't you love him
[1:51:06] i'll tell you in this hour that's a
[1:51:08] thing that we can say is that lord
[1:51:09] beyond any words see god didn't just
[1:51:11] give us a word in this day
[1:51:14] he came
[1:51:16] he came
[1:51:17] the amen

[2:10:15] every one of those children
[2:10:18] sixteen seventeen brother samuel hi all
[2:10:20] i know is
[2:10:22] is she did it
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:25] and let me just say this
[2:10:26] i know it sounds like this is just
[2:10:28] continuing to preach and continue to
[2:10:30] preach
[2:10:33] [Music]
[2:10:40] but the lord jesus his presence
[2:10:44] means more to me
[2:10:46] than everything
[2:10:49] he could have gave me this or did this
[2:10:50] that
[2:10:52] his presence
[2:10:54] is what means everything
[2:10:57] you can give your kids everything in the
