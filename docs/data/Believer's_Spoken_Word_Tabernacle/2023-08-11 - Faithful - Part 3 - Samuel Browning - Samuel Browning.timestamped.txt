[38:33] back you know and and but I just I want
[38:36] to support that and so I want I know
[38:40] that just as we're there and I know
[38:43] there's a I know there's a work that God
[38:45] has to do and so it just be in prayer we
[38:49] have we have many of our young people
[38:50] that are there at least you know our
[38:52] boys and and a few others and I know
[38:55] some others that will be there and it
[38:57] wouldn't matter if it was our kids just
[38:58] alone but each one would need a real
[39:00] touch from God Amen and we just want
[39:03] them just just everything that I prayed
[39:05] for today is that God just take each and
[39:07] every one deeper because that's what we
[39:09] all need we want to go deeper in the
[39:12] things of God and so we just are are
[39:15] just looking to the Lord for that so
[39:17] just be in prayer for that for those
[39:20] meetings that that are there and I know
[39:22] they're they're already underway as well
[39:24] so
[39:26] in verse in verse 8. of job 23.
[39:31] job said behold I go forward but he is
[39:34] not there and backward but I cannot
[39:38] perceive him
[39:39] and on the left hand where he doth work
[39:42] but I cannot Behold Him he hideth
[39:45] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[39:49] see him
[39:50] but he knoweth the way that I take and
[39:53] when he hath tried me I shall come forth
[39:56] as gold
[39:58] and my foot hath held his steps his way
[40:03] have I kept and not declined neither
[40:08] have I gone back from the Commandment of
[40:10] his lips and I have esteemed the words
[40:14] of his mouth more than my necessary food
[40:19] amen may God bless you and bless the
[40:22] reading of the word as you're being
[40:23] seated
[40:26] as you know we're just continuing to
[40:28] pour over this and there's a thought I
[40:31] was going to just continue to move
[40:33] forward with some other points there
[40:36] within of the faithfulness but I feel
[40:38] very drawn in my heart and just since
[40:42] last last Thursday and just looking at
[40:45] things and just meditating and waiting
[40:47] on the Lord and I want to just kind of
[40:49] go back into where we had left off last
[40:52] week in dealing with Abraham but before
[40:55] we get there you know when situations
[40:58] and things like job has encountered uh
[41:01] that's here in a test or trial and when
[41:04] things come our way
[41:06] it's what do we do when situations arise
[41:10] that are unpleasant to us
[41:12] right sometimes those are Pleasant
[41:14] unpleasant situation sure it can be a
[41:16] sickness but you know it's things that
[41:18] when it comes back to it that you know
[41:21] the scripture said that we are sealed
[41:23] until the day of our Redemption and that
[41:26] that speaks of that authority of that
[41:28] seal of God there's nothing that can
[41:30] break that seal when God has come down
[41:34] and he's recognized that seal is God
[41:36] recognizing our faith and God himself
[41:39] seals it with his own personal seal it's
[41:43] his life and through that quickening
[41:45] power it's no longer just our faith but
[41:48] it's God's faith that has come to
[41:50] operate on our faith and so then our
[41:53] faith just is natural remember brother
[41:55] Brown would always take this with Faith
[41:57] and he would show us and over and over
[42:00] in the message he would say faith that
[42:02] self-justice said is just as common as
[42:04] you starting your car and you came to
[42:06] church tonight but you recognize there's
[42:09] a lot of things that you could talk to
[42:11] people I I we you know I heard of a
[42:14] young lady or a woman when we were at a
[42:16] restaurant and she was talking about all
[42:18] of her plans she was getting off at 3 45
[42:21] and you know she was going to go do this
[42:23] and go do that and had this plan for the
[42:26] weekend and just a lot of different
[42:27] family events and you know what there
[42:30] was no question in her mind whether they
[42:31] were going to do it or not there was
[42:33] faith but you see with our faith alone
[42:37] remember now think of the Statue of a
[42:39] perfect man it begins right there with
[42:41] faith but brother Brandon would tell us
[42:43] he says there are many people that have
[42:46] just even these virtues from their
[42:48] natural birth but we're talking about in
[42:52] the stature of a perfect man and the
[42:53] faith we're speaking of is not something
[42:56] that is given to us by our natural birth
[42:58] we're talking about that which comes
[43:01] from God which only his presence can
[43:04] bring into our life so it's not anything
[43:07] that we earn or we Merit but it is given
[43:10] by The Sovereign Grace of almighty God
[43:12] and that's why the basis when we look at
[43:15] everything from our walk and our journey
[43:17] and our life it all begins with faith
[43:21] everything that every every promise that
[43:24] is ever taken by God it's by faith and
[43:28] it's and we look at it and to know that
[43:30] you know as brother Ram said he says
[43:31] it's not the man praying for you that
[43:33] that brings the healing it's your faith
[43:36] in the finished work of Calvary so every
[43:39] gift of God true gifts of God are not to
[43:43] take away from the finished work of
[43:45] Calvary but every true gift of God is to
[43:48] put that reflection on the finished work
[43:50] that it's settled that it's over that
[43:53] your faith remember Paul said when he
[43:55] came among the people that your faith
[43:58] would not stand in the wisdom of man but
[44:02] it would rest in the power of God what
[44:05] God not only has has done but God coming
[44:08] and vindicating that word personally to
[44:12] the lives of the people so there comes
[44:15] to that place that our faith for every
[44:17] promise of God it's God moving in our
[44:20] lives I believe that every one of every
[44:23] person must have a true experience with
[44:26] God there's no exception of that and the
[44:29] new birth being born again is where then
[44:32] we are born of the faith of almighty God
[44:35] so then it's no longer us in our own and
[44:39] our self looking upon the word but now
[44:42] it is God's faith moving through our
[44:45] life to direct us to influence us to
[44:48] guide us that living reality that lifts
[44:51] us just from walking here in this sphere
[44:53] with these natural five senses and our
[44:56] five spiritual senses it gives us a
[45:00] Grace to be able to walk higher than
[45:03] what we've ever walked before and the
[45:05] truth of the matter is even with our
[45:07] faith and our walking God that when we
[45:10] look at our walk with God we we do not
[45:13] start out right away with a mature Faith
[45:16] but remember when you're born again when
[45:19] we're born again we grow and through
[45:22] that growing there's a maturing of our
[45:24] faith and I think back to when brother
[45:26] Branham was standing in on the wings of
[45:28] a snow white dove and you'd hear how
[45:30] Paul will speak of the faith and
[45:32] admonishing that that Faith would grow
[45:34] Owen would abound in the hearts of the
[45:36] people and brother Branham in the
[45:38] message on the wings of a snow white
[45:40] dove would say concerning the word that
[45:43] has been opened in this hour he said the
[45:46] visitation of those seven angels and
[45:48] what God has done and opened this word
[45:51] and he says like this it has led me to a
[45:55] faith I never had before so the
[46:00] revealing of the Word was God is
[46:02] revealing his word and I to me that
[46:05] makes a statement to you and I that it's
[46:08] not just all of a sudden just all at
[46:10] once we are changed by the new birth but
[46:13] there is a maturing of our faith and our
[46:17] walk with God that's why the stature of
[46:20] the perfect man is not let me get this
[46:22] then let me get this then let me get
[46:24] this adding to is simply increasing
[46:29] are you with me we come under the
[46:31] authority of the word for our day we are
[46:35] born of that message and of that word
[46:37] but it is God that's why in our life
[46:40] it's not that all of a sudden we've got
[46:42] patience well we've got all of that
[46:44] let's go up to Virtue no our patience
[46:46] continues to grow virtue continues to
[46:49] grow why we are a living breathing
[46:53] supernatural being of almighty God
[46:56] so there's a continual maturing and
[46:59] growing within our lives and so when we
[47:02] look at that ceiling of God coming back
[47:05] to that place of what do we do when when
[47:08] we're pressed and when hard times come
[47:10] and sometimes as I said we could stay a
[47:13] month of Sunday's trying to divide hard
[47:15] times but we you understand when it's
[47:18] something that comes our way that there
[47:21] is a pressure Upon Our Lives whether
[47:23] it's upon our mind our emotion our body
[47:27] whatever it might be maybe it's someone
[47:29] has offended you or someone has said
[47:32] something but what is it that you do
[47:35] when that comes your way you see even
[47:38] when you find that there seems to be no
[47:41] resolve what do you do when that comes
[47:44] your way job himself had a testimony by
[47:47] God's grace that he could say and this
[47:50] you know that that I've kept his way and
[47:53] I've not declined because job wasn't
[47:55] living by his Own Strength he was living
[47:58] by the strength of almighty God that's
[48:01] why the Book of Job is such a very
[48:03] important book it's the oldest book in
[48:06] the Bible it's it's that it's this even
[48:09] within this revelation we see it's laid
[48:12] out even in the hour that we're living
[48:14] in it's that which would speak just as
[48:16] God bragged on job it's the same way
[48:19] that God has continued to brag on every
[48:22] one of his children
[48:25] now I don't know about you but my hand's
[48:27] not up to ask God to brag on me
[48:30] because I you know in myself and I trust
[48:33] you would feel the same way you know I
[48:36] look at myself and all we can say is is
[48:38] that Lord I'm standing in need of your
[48:41] grace but God when job I'm sure job did
[48:44] not stand there and job see himself as
[48:46] far as in all of his elements as a
[48:49] perfect and upright man but God was
[48:51] looking at his confession and his
[48:54] confession was in the blood his
[48:56] confession was in the sacrifice and
[48:59] that's what God was speaking to was who
[49:02] that real man was down on the inside and
[49:06] that's what was coming out you see this
[49:08] trial itself job said when he had tried
[49:11] me I shall come forth as pure as gold
[49:14] this trial was not going to be something
[49:17] to overthrow job but it would be a trial
[49:21] that would absolutely manifest the glory
[49:24] of almighty God it would not be
[49:27] something that would draw glory and
[49:29] praise to job but it would be the glory
[49:32] of God that would be made manifest in
[49:35] job's life because job was standing by
[49:38] the strength of almighty God in this
[49:41] moment and that's why it's so imperative
[49:44] that we have the Seal of the Living God
[49:47] because no matter what comes our way it
[49:50] doesn't matter what takes place it
[49:52] doesn't matter you know what what what
[49:54] comes or goes brother Randall would
[49:56] speak of this in Abraham's Grace
[49:57] Covenant he said it doesn't matter who
[50:00] says what but here you are sealed until
[50:03] the day of your Redemption so it's a
[50:07] seal it's something that is keeping us
[50:09] there it is something that you and I are
[50:12] recognizing that God not only is certain
[50:15] but I am certain of where that I'm
[50:17] standing in God
[50:20] and that is and that has an effect Upon
[50:22] Our Lives
[50:24] I want to just I want to read here just
[50:26] a few of them referring to this quote
[50:28] once again out of three kinds of
[50:30] Believers and out of this you know I've
[50:33] read it I've referred this many times
[50:35] but this is really the basis for what
[50:37] we're speaking on on being faithful
[50:40] because it's something as we've looked
[50:42] at it here in scripture and we've just
[50:44] started to scratch it God himself looks
[50:47] at faithfulness in a very Highway
[50:50] that's the very that's the quality that
[50:53] God is looking for because when it
[50:56] speaks of those who come back with him
[50:58] from the wedding supper into the battle
[51:01] of Armageddon it says and with him come
[51:04] the called and the chosen who are called
[51:07] the faithful
[51:09] so when it's all said and done it's not
[51:11] anything about anything that we've done
[51:13] but it just simply speaks the faithful
[51:16] and let me just say have what a blessing
[51:18] it is to be faithful and that is to be
[51:21] faithful at all points it's faithful not
[51:24] only when we're in the house of God but
[51:26] faithful when we're not in the house of
[51:28] God it's faithful at all times why
[51:30] because God is not just the God of this
[51:33] building but God lives inside of your
[51:36] Tabernacle God walks in your shoes
[51:39] leather and God wants to make himself
[51:41] known through your life
[51:43] in my life and God uses the
[51:47] circumstances and the trials and the
[51:50] tests of Life are actually the grounds
[51:54] whereby that God is proving his word
[51:57] through the life of his believer it's
[51:59] actually through those things that where
[52:01] God himself is being made manifest
[52:04] through the lives of his people
[52:08] this this statement I keep writing
[52:10] reading it but it speaks so deep and I
[52:13] I'm certain that I can't even we can't
[52:16] scratch the surface of it but God knows
[52:18] what we need for just this moment that
[52:20] we're in
[52:21] the Bible would say or but brother Brown
[52:24] would say the trials Dusty Rhodes and
[52:26] hot son of persecution uh you know but
[52:29] the Loyalty of your heart uh he says the
[52:32] Loyalty of your heart is what beats that
[52:34] material till she is ready to go into
[52:38] the mold
[52:40] and God's children is made up correctly
[52:44] on his word for they are living examples
[52:46] and the word of God is living through
[52:49] them and the trial comes to shake you
[52:52] put you to the very bottom to see where
[52:54] you'll stand and they tested they tried
[52:57] every son that cometh to God so the
[53:00] Loyalty of your heart that's what beats
[53:03] the material
[53:04] I I know I don't have to ask the hands
[53:07] but as I said when we go through
[53:09] something that you are you go through
[53:12] you it's it is staying it is where our
[53:16] hearts are remaining steadfast in the
[53:18] Lord and not something that where we run
[53:20] away when a situation becomes difficult
[53:22] or it becomes hard
[53:24] right listen situations and things come
[53:28] that can try to bring Gloom over your
[53:31] life try to bring despair over your life
[53:34] the many times there can be just like we
[53:36] had out here today all of a sudden
[53:38] clouds came up and you think where did
[53:40] those clouds come from right you look on
[53:44] your weather forecast and there's no
[53:46] prediction of any rain coming and you
[53:48] wonder where did this rain come from
[53:50] where did these clouds come from and
[53:53] many times with tests and trials that's
[53:55] exactly what it is whether it's offenses
[53:58] whether it's sickness no matter what it
[54:00] is but what is it that actually beats
[54:03] the material is where we stand faithful
[54:06] in the midst of that time how do I stand
[54:08] faithful what does that visual look like
[54:11] does that visual look like that it means
[54:13] I'm skipping Every Beat of the way it
[54:16] doesn't mean that at all but it means
[54:18] that from within our heart we're looking
[54:20] to God even in the midst of Anguish and
[54:23] despair we're called calling out to God
[54:25] even when there's situations in front of
[54:28] us that God that there needs to be a
[54:31] move here Lord and we're looking at that
[54:33] and in the midst of that time we're
[54:35] asking oh God mold me shape me Lord take
[54:38] out of me Lord whatever Lord the purpose
[54:41] is within this I'll tell you what that
[54:43] is that's loyalty that's in our heart
[54:46] beating the material
[54:49] that even when you've prayed and you've
[54:53] asked God for certain things and he
[54:55] doesn't answer
[54:57] how do you respond
[55:01] do we draw back do we get well I don't
[55:03] know it just seems you know a little
[55:05] like that's all a testing
[55:08] because if God if he answered every time
[55:11] that we spoke to him we would become
[55:14] very spoiled
[55:16] but you see God God loves to prove
[55:19] he loves to prove his children
[55:24] God loves to show and uh my I just
[55:29] I just feel like I could go a million
[55:31] different ways here but I just want to
[55:33] follow what he wants here but God
[55:35] himself think of it of how that God
[55:38] desires to bring forth out of our life
[55:41] God wants to see himself reflected in
[55:44] you and me
[55:45] he works Upon Our Life remember our
[55:48] brother Bram talks about him taking that
[55:50] that medal and he beats it and he beats
[55:52] it and he beats it until he sees his own
[55:54] reflection in it
[55:56] the same way with tests and trials that
[55:59] we go through you know who's really the
[56:02] one that's actually being defeated in
[56:05] the midst of that and that's that old
[56:07] carnal sticky nature that surrounds us
[56:10] that's what's being brought and reduced
[56:12] to nothing that's why the scripture
[56:14] could say that the Excellency may be of
[56:17] the power of God and not of us in
[56:20] Earthen vessels God has placed his life
[56:22] vessels that are frail and that Frailty
[56:26] shows itself
[56:28] we're aware of our Frailty
[56:33] right
[56:34] and we see that but see in recognizing a
[56:38] Frailty it's through that moment that
[56:40] we're calling out to God in the midst of
[56:43] our Frailty you see the weaknesses this
[56:46] is why the prophet says don't make
[56:48] excuses for your weaknesses he said but
[56:51] submit them to the Lord in prayer give
[56:55] their God those weaknesses and he says
[56:57] God will pour himself in those channels
[57:01] and use himself
[57:03] these things only what do they do it
[57:06] exposes the humanity but that's not
[57:09] where we need to stop looking at it's to
[57:12] look to almighty God because it takes
[57:15] God to harvest God
[57:18] amen we are not being raptured by a word
[57:22] of a man we're not being raptured by a
[57:25] denominational thought we are being
[57:27] raptured by the thought of almighty God
[57:32] it's taking God to draw out of our lives
[57:35] and what is God doing he's drawing out
[57:37] himself
[57:44] when it's all said and done
[57:47] when it's all said and done oh God May
[57:49] our character reflect his
[57:52] and I want to just draw here just for a
[57:54] little bit
[57:56] we've read from this point here of First
[57:59] Corinthians 1 9 and I've referred to
[58:01] this many times God is faithful
[58:05] because we cannot even have a basis for
[58:07] our faithfulness without seeing him
[58:11] because there's no and and not only a
[58:13] basis but there's no faithfulness
[58:15] outside of God and God's faithfulness
[58:19] God's faith moving in our lives
[58:22] God is faithful
[58:24] and this is why that that it takes God
[58:27] moving Upon Our Lives because if it's
[58:30] not God moving on our lives then if it's
[58:33] man moving upon man then it's man being
[58:35] faithful to man
[58:38] is that right that's what every false
[58:40] ISM and Doctrine everything has been
[58:42] it's been man now conforming man to
[58:46] man's idea but that's the difference
[58:49] with the message of the hour it's not
[58:52] the man the ideas of a man this is the
[58:56] mind of Christ that has come down Among
[58:59] Us
[59:00] amen because a man could look at you and
[59:03] me and say no hope your situation or my
[59:06] situation or your need it's beyond
[59:08] unraveling but God showed listen to me
[59:11] through every disease that was conquered
[59:13] through every sickness with Georgie
[59:16] Carter with different ones even in their
[59:18] lives God showed that there's no
[59:20] situation that is beyond recovery
[59:27] Hallelujah
[59:30] God is faithful why did God do that why
[59:33] is all of that recorded it's recorded
[59:35] for you and I and not just recorded but
[59:38] that you and I can recognize that that
[59:40] he's the same God for me for my need
[59:43] right here in 2023.
[59:46] God is faithful
[59:49] because if we can't recognize that that
[59:51] God is faithful then we in ourselves do
[59:54] not have any basis to begin or to act in
[59:58] faithfulness
[1:00:00] God is faithful by whom you were called
[1:00:04] unto the fellowship of his son Jesus
[1:00:06] Christ Our Lord now the scripture would
[1:00:09] go on to say these many of these
[1:00:10] scriptures you're familiar with
[1:00:12] Philippians 1 6 being confident of this
[1:00:16] very thing that he which hath begun a
[1:00:19] good work in you will perform it until
[1:00:22] the day of Jesus Christ
[1:00:24] he will God continues to Faithfully work
[1:00:29] in our lives
[1:00:31] amen it's not something just overnight
[1:00:34] but he's working in our lives
[1:00:37] and that work in our life is even where
[1:00:39] the test and the Trials come in and the
[1:00:42] dying to ourself and through it all
[1:00:44] listen uh job even said it if I could
[1:00:47] come before his seat he said would he
[1:00:49] speak harshness against me no but he
[1:00:52] would put strength into me and that's
[1:00:55] where Peter said that God's will is
[1:00:57] after we had suffered a while that he
[1:01:00] would establish us and he would
[1:01:03] strengthen us
[1:01:05] so you don't come out of the trial
[1:01:07] weaker
[1:01:09] you come out stronger
[1:01:12] but not stronger you or me are not
[1:01:15] stronger in our own right but we are
[1:01:18] stronger in the Lord
[1:01:23] Hallelujah
[1:01:25] is recognizing more of him now notice
[1:01:29] being confident in this very thing that
[1:01:31] he which hath begun a good work and you
[1:01:33] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[1:01:35] Christ in Hebrews 10 35 the scripture
[1:01:40] says cast not a way therefore your
[1:01:42] confidence which hath great recompense
[1:01:45] of reward for ye have need of patience
[1:01:50] that after you have done the will of God
[1:01:53] ye might receive the promise
[1:01:57] after doing the will of God
[1:02:00] the promise doesn't come before that
[1:02:04] but you see doing the will of God it
[1:02:06] starts inwardly within our hearts
[1:02:10] because even as a person can say well
[1:02:13] I've done everything but you watch
[1:02:15] sometimes that sometimes that attitude
[1:02:17] or that thought it's as though they're
[1:02:19] trying to barter with God you don't have
[1:02:21] to barter with God you can't barter with
[1:02:24] God it is simply from your heart and let
[1:02:26] me just say it like this I think we've
[1:02:28] been saying it over and over if my heart
[1:02:30] isn't there yet and no matter what
[1:02:33] promise it is if it's the promise of the
[1:02:35] Holy Ghost whatever it's asking God lead
[1:02:38] me to the place Lord
[1:02:41] bring me to that place oh God
[1:02:46] amen
[1:02:47] because after all it's not you or me
[1:02:50] that's making anything happen
[1:02:53] it's not it's not us
[1:02:56] it's God sovereignly moving
[1:02:59] it's God's sovereignly performing his
[1:03:02] word is that right
[1:03:04] so you know it's just like you know it's
[1:03:08] a person said well I I need the Holy
[1:03:10] Ghost well it's true but it's not you
[1:03:13] getting it it's God giving it
[1:03:16] is that right so this is why when
[1:03:18] brother Graham could say in restoration
[1:03:20] the brighter he said you need healing
[1:03:22] you need Deliverance he said you need
[1:03:24] the Holy Ghost let him take you there
[1:03:28] let him take you there now how does that
[1:03:31] come in by surrender and to be
[1:03:34] surrendered is to become a lamb
[1:03:39] oh my my
[1:03:41] oh my notice you have need of patience
[1:03:44] that after you ever done the will of God
[1:03:46] you might receive the promise for yet a
[1:03:48] little while in he that shall come will
[1:03:50] come and will not Tarry
[1:03:52] now I want to go to Hebrews chapter 6
[1:03:54] verse 13.
[1:03:56] forgive us we were just a little bit
[1:03:58] short there on staff and uh Brianna's
[1:04:01] down there so
[1:04:03] Brianna does a tremendous job back there
[1:04:05] for us
[1:04:06] and we've had others there before too
[1:04:08] and notice this year in Hebrews 6 13 let
[1:04:11] me just read this to kind of to draw
[1:04:13] from here
[1:04:14] for when God made promise to Abraham
[1:04:17] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:04:19] swear by himself saying surely blessing
[1:04:23] I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will
[1:04:26] multiply thee and so after he had
[1:04:30] patiently endured he obtained the
[1:04:34] promise
[1:04:35] see this is why testing comes in
[1:04:38] in our lives this is why testing comes
[1:04:42] we all can remember this when even first
[1:04:45] coming to the Lord we are tested
[1:04:49] you're tested
[1:04:51] and sometimes no matter us or or others
[1:04:55] and you see here under that testing here
[1:04:57] we come right back what do we do go
[1:04:59] right back to to grounds that we're
[1:05:02] comfortable with
[1:05:03] not talking about before the New Birth
[1:05:05] has come
[1:05:06] testing it and you know what comes in
[1:05:08] fear wants to come in how are you going
[1:05:11] to do this how are you going to make
[1:05:13] this let me just say this to you any
[1:05:15] thought that comes in that produces
[1:05:17] anxiety never came from God
[1:05:24] that never
[1:05:30] because God said my thoughts concerning
[1:05:33] you are thoughts of peace
[1:05:36] and to bring you to an expected end
[1:05:40] it's knowing your rights knowing your
[1:05:43] grounds
[1:05:44] right and so when the enemy always wants
[1:05:48] to come and try to you know bring fear
[1:05:49] put us you know into certain ways in
[1:05:52] certain grounds and you know whether
[1:05:54] it's the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:55] whether it's a promise of healing
[1:05:57] whatever that promise is
[1:05:59] but remember here after patiently
[1:06:02] enduring he obtained the promise
[1:06:07] it's faithfulness
[1:06:09] before God
[1:06:12] and that's where that within this if we
[1:06:16] can see this even as we look at this a
[1:06:18] little bit tonight right now concerning
[1:06:20] Abraham because I believe Abraham listen
[1:06:23] Abraham Drew from from that Revelation
[1:06:26] that was in job's life
[1:06:28] and let me tell you how confident
[1:06:30] Abraham was of that Revelation when it
[1:06:33] was time to bury Sarah
[1:06:36] he went to the field to the cave of
[1:06:39] machpila is that right he went to
[1:06:42] Barrett because he knew Job was buried
[1:06:45] there
[1:06:46] right it's same thing that when Jacob
[1:06:49] was down in Egypt he said don't leave my
[1:06:51] bones here take me back there and bury
[1:06:53] me there when Joseph was up there don't
[1:06:56] leave my bones here take me back there
[1:06:58] and bury their why because he knew by
[1:07:02] Revelation that the promise of
[1:07:05] Resurrection was in Israel in the land
[1:07:09] that God had given Abraham that is the
[1:07:13] Promised Land
[1:07:15] is that right that's the promised land
[1:07:18] and they knew that by Revelation how did
[1:07:21] they know that by Revelation because the
[1:07:24] same God that inspired it and taught it
[1:07:26] to job is the same God that inspired it
[1:07:29] to Abraham
[1:07:33] Hallelujah
[1:07:36] the same certainty that Abraham spoke
[1:07:38] with and acted upon is the same
[1:07:41] certainty that job had in his life can't
[1:07:43] you see that even in this hour that
[1:07:46] certainty as a Believer as a son and
[1:07:49] daughter of God it did not come of our
[1:07:51] own accord it came because almighty God
[1:07:55] Elohim himself coming down and breathing
[1:07:59] upon his word and breathing across our
[1:08:02] life that is why Revelation is so
[1:08:05] important in our lives
[1:08:08] remember job did not have a written book
[1:08:11] to go by
[1:08:14] is that right
[1:08:16] they didn't have that but what they had
[1:08:19] was the revelation
[1:08:21] and brother Brandon would say it like
[1:08:22] this and I've heard but now I see he
[1:08:24] said then that's the more important
[1:08:27] thing
[1:08:28] it's not saying that the Bible is not
[1:08:30] important but it says recognized that
[1:08:33] what is more important than knowing the
[1:08:35] letter is to know the offer
[1:08:39] is to know it by Revelation and the
[1:08:42] prophet takes that up when he's even
[1:08:43] giving his own testimony regarding you
[1:08:46] know uh little Joseph coming on and he
[1:08:49] began to just pray and thank God about
[1:08:52] the man in the Bible called Joseph oh
[1:08:54] Lord what a man and it begins to speak
[1:08:57] about that of Joseph and what a faithful
[1:09:00] man he was and the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:01] spoke to him and let him know that he's
[1:09:04] going to have you're going to have a son
[1:09:06] and calling Joseph
[1:09:09] but God didn't tell him the in-between
[1:09:13] God did not tell him the depth of the
[1:09:16] test that he would come through
[1:09:19] but think about this
[1:09:21] I don't know I pondered on that many
[1:09:23] times I'm just looking just as I'm
[1:09:25] listening that and works as Faith
[1:09:27] Express of how that when uh you know
[1:09:30] even the doctors came out and it was
[1:09:32] little Sarah that came forth and what
[1:09:34] they said to him you must have not meant
[1:09:36] Joseph you must have meant Josephine
[1:09:41] you see it was testings
[1:09:45] but he said I couldn't get it out of my
[1:09:47] heart this is I love how the prophet
[1:09:49] says it here he said because it was
[1:09:51] written in my heart
[1:09:54] and that's why he kept looking for it
[1:09:56] even when the doctor said she can't have
[1:10:00] another baby
[1:10:02] now listen friends I I believe in the
[1:10:04] wisdom I believe in wisdom and let's
[1:10:06] pray over and look over things I don't
[1:10:08] believe in us trying to ramrod the
[1:10:10] things of God you understand
[1:10:12] I want to just kind of qualify that
[1:10:14] statement there sometimes there's things
[1:10:16] where we could take something on a
[1:10:18] ramrod something simply because of what
[1:10:20] we want but this was not what brother
[1:10:22] Branham wanted this was a revelation
[1:10:26] so the decisions were made by the
[1:10:29] revelation
[1:10:31] when they said you ought to have her
[1:10:33] tubes tied you can't you shouldn't have
[1:10:35] any more children he was not making that
[1:10:38] decision because of his own fleshly
[1:10:41] desire he was making that decision
[1:10:44] because of the Revelation that was wrote
[1:10:47] on his heart
[1:10:49] wow how powerful is the revelation of
[1:10:54] Jesus Christ when it is wrote in the
[1:10:56] lives of the believer when God writes
[1:10:59] this word down into the depths of our
[1:11:01] heart there's a lot of things that can
[1:11:03] come our way that seem to disqualify and
[1:11:07] take away but when God has put the
[1:11:10] stroke of his own life and wrote upon
[1:11:13] our life oh brother and sister that
[1:11:16] Revelation is what we march by
[1:11:23] and Joseph came
[1:11:27] but you see after it patiently endured
[1:11:31] but God notice in verse 16 I'm just
[1:11:34] trying to get somewhere when God willing
[1:11:36] more abundantly to show unto The Heirs a
[1:11:38] promise the inmutability of pardon me go
[1:11:41] to verse 16. for men very swear by the
[1:11:44] greater and an oath for confirmation is
[1:11:47] to them an end of all Strife wherein God
[1:11:50] willing more abundantly to show unto The
[1:11:54] Heirs of Promise the immutability of his
[1:11:57] counsel confirmed it by an oath that by
[1:12:01] two immutable things in which it's
[1:12:03] impossible for God to lie we might have
[1:12:06] a strong consolation who have fled for
[1:12:08] Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set
[1:12:12] before us which hope we have as an
[1:12:17] anchor of the Soul both sure and
[1:12:20] steadfast which entereth into that
[1:12:22] within the veil whether the Forerunner
[1:12:25] is for us entered even Jesus made a high
[1:12:29] priest Forever After the order of
[1:12:32] Melchizedek
[1:12:33] so that word that was spoken confirmed
[1:12:37] by an oath is now resting inside of the
[1:12:42] heart of the believer
[1:12:44] that same word that reality is now an
[1:12:48] anchor of the Soul
[1:12:50] why do you have an anchor what's the
[1:12:53] purpose of an anchor on a boat
[1:12:56] what's the purpose of it because it's
[1:12:58] not just when you're driving out in the
[1:13:00] lake or when they're just driving out
[1:13:02] into the going out in the ocean but it's
[1:13:04] at times When Storms Come
[1:13:06] it's also at times you know that many
[1:13:08] times in seven I know some of the
[1:13:10] brothers they do the trolling and things
[1:13:12] like that we're fishing and so forth but
[1:13:13] sometimes you know it used to be you
[1:13:15] drop the anchor and there you're staying
[1:13:17] in that one spot because why when you
[1:13:19] drop the anchor and it hits the bottom
[1:13:21] you do not have to worry about being
[1:13:23] rocked up against the rocks unawares
[1:13:27] an anchor keeps you in one place
[1:13:32] and that's why that anchor in our show
[1:13:35] it's there it keeps us anchored through
[1:13:38] every test through every trial through
[1:13:41] every circumstance there's an anchor all
[1:13:44] waves might come feelings might come
[1:13:47] thoughts my come there might even be
[1:13:50] complaints that would arise out of our
[1:13:52] mouth but if there's an anchor that's
[1:13:54] there we cannot go anywhere because
[1:13:58] there is an anchor of our soul
[1:14:02] it is sure and steadfast and what does
[1:14:06] it do it reflects itself
[1:14:09] see it's easy for a boat to say it's
[1:14:11] anchored but it's another thing when you
[1:14:13] see it's anchored
[1:14:14] and how do you know that it's anchored
[1:14:16] because it's staying right there
[1:14:19] right
[1:14:20] and that's the same thing within our
[1:14:21] life that's why it is that that of the
[1:14:25] necessity and essential to be anchored
[1:14:28] in the Lord
[1:14:29] let me just kind of go back to the
[1:14:31] scripture this is where I just couldn't
[1:14:33] get the scripture off of my heart uh in
[1:14:36] Nehemiah chapter nine and I read this
[1:14:38] towards the closing of last service but
[1:14:41] this Nehemiah chapter 6 or chapter 9
[1:14:43] verse 6. and notice here they are I'm
[1:14:46] not going to read this whole chapter but
[1:14:48] they are rehearsing in praise to the
[1:14:52] faithfulness of almighty God
[1:14:54] and they say in verse six let me begin
[1:14:56] there thou even Thou Art the art Lord
[1:15:00] alone thou Hast made Heaven the heaven
[1:15:02] of Heavens with all their hosts the
[1:15:04] Earth and all the things that are
[1:15:05] therein the Seas and all that is therein
[1:15:08] and thou preservers them all and the
[1:15:10] host of Heaven worship thee Thou Art the
[1:15:13] Lord The God Who did his choose Abram
[1:15:20] Abraham never chose God
[1:15:22] chose Abram
[1:15:25] but God's choice being made known
[1:15:28] calling to Abraham it became reflected
[1:15:33] because Abraham had to make a choice and
[1:15:36] so Abraham's Choice reflected God's
[1:15:39] choice
[1:15:41] is that right now notice here it is who
[1:15:45] did his choose Abraham and brought him
[1:15:48] out of the UR of counties and gavest him
[1:15:51] the name of Abraham
[1:15:55] there's a lot in verse 7
[1:15:58] that skipped over
[1:16:01] are you hearing me you know you read it
[1:16:03] in Abraham's life there's a lot that's
[1:16:04] skipped over you want to know why this
[1:16:07] is what was important
[1:16:09] this is what came forth
[1:16:13] term with me to Hebrews 11.
[1:16:16] I want to just go here real quick
[1:16:28] I'll come back there in a moment but
[1:16:29] let's just go to Hebrews 11.
[1:16:38] now notice in verse 8.
[1:16:41] by faith Abraham when he was called to
[1:16:44] go out into a place which he should have
[1:16:46] to receive for an inheritance obeyed and
[1:16:48] he went out not knowing whether he went
[1:16:50] that was faith
[1:16:52] he was faithful to the voice that was
[1:16:54] speaking to him and what it was asking
[1:16:57] him to do at that moment
[1:16:59] God was not asking him in verse 8 go off
[1:17:02] for thy only begotten son because that
[1:17:06] hadn't come yet
[1:17:08] but God was calling him
[1:17:10] and had to call him out of the land
[1:17:13] where he was and into the land of
[1:17:15] promise and Abraham was faithful to that
[1:17:19] voice
[1:17:22] now it could look like well he still has
[1:17:24] his father still has lot with him but
[1:17:27] he's moving to where the voice is
[1:17:30] calling him to
[1:17:32] we don't see everything just exactly
[1:17:35] perfect right there in Abraham's life
[1:17:37] and God is but God's looking deeper than
[1:17:41] all the imperfections at that moment
[1:17:44] oh let me tell you something God has got
[1:17:47] such confidence in his word and he's got
[1:17:50] confidence that when his presence as he
[1:17:53] moves down in the Fulfillment of his
[1:17:55] word it's that which brings a loosening
[1:17:57] in our lives
[1:18:01] verse 9 said by faith he's sojourned in
[1:18:04] the land of promise has in a strange
[1:18:06] country dwelling in Tabernacles with
[1:18:08] Isaac Jacob The Heirs with him of the
[1:18:11] same promise so it goes on through verse
[1:18:13] 10 through verse 11 through verse 12 and
[1:18:16] verse 13 verse 14 and then here we find
[1:18:20] where it comes in verse 17 if we could
[1:18:23] go there by faith Abraham when he was
[1:18:27] tried offered up Isaac and he that had
[1:18:31] received the promises offered up his
[1:18:34] only begotten son of whom it was said
[1:18:36] that in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[1:18:40] accounting that God was able to raise
[1:18:44] him up even from the dead from whence
[1:18:47] also he received him in a figure
[1:18:53] that did not come overnight
[1:18:58] but it came
[1:19:00] through faithfulness
[1:19:03] faithfulness LED
[1:19:06] to more faithfulness
[1:19:12] if we look here in this scripture we're
[1:19:15] reading in Nehemiah 9 and 7 God brought
[1:19:18] him out of the earth counties and then
[1:19:21] even when you read here in Hebrews 11
[1:19:22] Hebrews 11 it does not speak here of
[1:19:25] Hager
[1:19:27] doesn't speak of Ishmael
[1:19:29] why that was not a by faith
[1:19:33] that was by by Abram
[1:19:36] are you hearing me
[1:19:38] sure it brings a contrast to it but you
[1:19:40] see you see this is why that when it's
[1:19:42] all said and done when our commentary is
[1:19:45] written it is only going to be a
[1:19:46] commentary of Christ in you the hope of
[1:19:49] glory
[1:19:53] that's the faithfulness when it's all
[1:19:55] said and done because why God is
[1:19:57] faithful
[1:19:58] Faithful is he who called you
[1:20:03] who will do it who will perform his word
[1:20:10] now this is one thing that we find
[1:20:12] within this in Nehemiah 9-7 we can see
[1:20:16] that down through Abraham's life all of
[1:20:19] Abraham's actions were not always
[1:20:22] perfect
[1:20:24] is that right
[1:20:26] let me just get here because I'm all
[1:20:27] over here I'm just just just moves just
[1:20:30] just jumped
[1:20:32] it always wasn't it always then
[1:20:34] Abraham's actions
[1:20:36] didn't always match the promise but in
[1:20:39] his heart he was ready to repent when
[1:20:41] the word corrected him
[1:20:48] that's the difference
[1:20:52] him Abraham's heart was when the word
[1:20:55] spoke Abraham from his heart was amen
[1:20:59] even when it required there was
[1:21:02] repentance that was required in
[1:21:04] Abraham's life he repented when the word
[1:21:06] corrected him and through that
[1:21:08] faithfulness under the word of God when
[1:21:10] he was wrong he was willing to repent
[1:21:12] when revealed here God it revealed then
[1:21:16] what God actually saw in Abraham
[1:21:20] I want to get to this this scripture
[1:21:22] here then as we look at it in the next
[1:21:25] part there of number or Nehemiah 9 verse
[1:21:28] 8 and I just just trying to draw from
[1:21:30] there I know I'm running short on time
[1:21:32] here but I just just trying to draw on
[1:21:34] to me is just such a lot that could be
[1:21:37] brought here but I'm only interested in
[1:21:39] what he wants to draw our attention to
[1:21:41] here because remember Abraham Abraham is
[1:21:46] regarded as the father of the faith
[1:21:50] is that right even where Paul would
[1:21:52] write that they which are of that same
[1:21:55] Faith are blessed with faithful Abraham
[1:22:01] here on the other side in this
[1:22:03] commentary not only God recognizing
[1:22:06] faithful but here on the other side in
[1:22:08] Galatians 3 it's recognized by the
[1:22:11] spirit of God Faithful Abraham how was
[1:22:14] Abraham able to be faithful because it
[1:22:17] was the faith of God moving upon
[1:22:20] Abraham's life
[1:22:22] that's why Paul could say we are of that
[1:22:24] same faith
[1:22:26] right that's the same Faith were to
[1:22:30] earnestly contend for
[1:22:31] it's God's life
[1:22:33] now I want you to notice this here here
[1:22:36] and gave us him the name Abraham
[1:22:39] and found now you know gave us him the
[1:22:43] name Abraham God put his own name on
[1:22:46] Abraham's name
[1:22:48] God removed the m and put his own name
[1:22:51] on
[1:22:53] is that right
[1:22:55] here and not only had God
[1:22:57] filled him imparted to him his life
[1:23:01] after God think of this God has called
[1:23:04] him into the land Abraham had a
[1:23:06] Disobedience he goes down into Egypt but
[1:23:08] here he comes back God speaks to him and
[1:23:10] says get back to the land
[1:23:13] why God is faithful to his word
[1:23:17] is that right my my let me finish I got
[1:23:20] to finish reading this scripture and
[1:23:21] then I can then I can preach that notice
[1:23:23] and found us his heart faithful before
[1:23:25] thee and made a covenant with him to
[1:23:28] give the land of the Canaanites Hittites
[1:23:31] amorites parasites Champion sites gurga
[1:23:33] sites to give it I say to his seed and
[1:23:37] has performed thy words for thou art
[1:23:41] righteous now this is worship unto God
[1:23:44] what God said he performed
[1:23:48] now remember Abraham never saw this in
[1:23:52] his day
[1:23:53] but God said your seed will journey in a
[1:23:57] land for 400 years but I'll bring them
[1:23:59] out with a mighty hand
[1:24:02] is that right mountain when we look and
[1:24:05] we see all the way through Abram's life
[1:24:07] this is what I want to draw into and
[1:24:10] found us his heart faithful before him
[1:24:12] before thee and made a covenant with him
[1:24:15] God made a covenant with Abraham in
[1:24:18] Genesis 15. God confirmed it
[1:24:21] he showed he took Abram out of the
[1:24:23] picture takes man out of the picture and
[1:24:25] gone through all those sacrifices that
[1:24:27] little white light
[1:24:28] went right down through the midst of it
[1:24:30] God confirming this is what I am going
[1:24:35] to do
[1:24:38] look at this right after that chapter
[1:24:42] Here Comes Ishmael
[1:24:48] that's what I think what happened
[1:24:50] what happened
[1:24:52] but you see it shows this is like
[1:24:55] brother ram calls that of Ishmael he
[1:24:57] said we see that slight Interruption to
[1:24:59] the program of God
[1:25:01] but it's just like any other program if
[1:25:04] it's interrupted stay tuned it'll be
[1:25:06] continued
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:08] [Applause]
[1:25:14] then no doubt you have had I have had in
[1:25:17] my life
[1:25:19] but this is not our program
[1:25:22] that's why we're not the workmanship of
[1:25:24] any man we are his workmanship
[1:25:29] we're not the Masterpiece of a church
[1:25:31] it's a masterpiece of God
[1:25:35] and God makes a man a masterpiece by his
[1:25:38] own life uniting with himself inside of
[1:25:42] that man
[1:25:44] so then it becomes one in Union and
[1:25:46] that's a masterpiece of God that's a
[1:25:49] signature addition
[1:25:51] and here God through it all here it
[1:25:55] comes in Genesis 17.
[1:25:58] I'm your sh you know I'm your portion
[1:26:02] God makes himself reveals himself as El
[1:26:04] shadiah the strength Giver
[1:26:09] God had to allow Abraham you can read it
[1:26:12] in the Book of Romans God allowed
[1:26:14] Abraham's strength to dry up in other
[1:26:16] words no more little ishmaels can come
[1:26:21] that's right
[1:26:24] God allowed it to dry up
[1:26:28] God allows things to get to the last to
[1:26:31] get to the weak spot to get to the place
[1:26:34] where it is no more can it be human
[1:26:37] instrumentality in it
[1:26:40] that's the same way that God is working
[1:26:43] with our lives and it's what do we do in
[1:26:46] that moment because that can be scary
[1:26:49] when we look at it and say what can I do
[1:26:52] right here but the greatest thing is in
[1:26:54] that moment is to trust in him who will
[1:26:58] not leave you trust in God who has
[1:27:01] brought you safe this far trust in him
[1:27:05] who has worked and has done a work in
[1:27:08] your life trust in him
[1:27:10] that's what God wants us to trust in
[1:27:13] when brother Branham would take that
[1:27:15] scripture in Genesis 12 and he picks it
[1:27:18] up in the greatest battle of her father
[1:27:20] fought and he says God is calling
[1:27:21] Abraham's seed to separate from all
[1:27:25] unbelief and he said to separate from
[1:27:28] seed taste fill smell here reasoning
[1:27:31] imagination conscience and he goes down
[1:27:33] through the line well what is it it's to
[1:27:35] separate from everything that we've ever
[1:27:38] known we've known our reasoning we've
[1:27:41] known imagination
[1:27:44] and friends we still have to battle it
[1:27:48] it doesn't mean the battles won't come
[1:27:50] but it means living oh God let us live
[1:27:54] free from our imagination well how can I
[1:27:57] can't stop the birds from coming in but
[1:28:00] you have the authority to blast them as
[1:28:03] they're coming by
[1:28:04] cast down every imagination
[1:28:09] and any reasoning that reasons against
[1:28:12] the word be against it
[1:28:16] it don't matter how good or how clear it
[1:28:18] works this is how the Seed of Abraham
[1:28:21] stands in the midst of Trials stands in
[1:28:25] the midst of tests why because it's not
[1:28:28] the DNA of a man
[1:28:31] we can go through Genesis and show you
[1:28:34] the DNA of Abram it's not strong DNA
[1:28:39] but we're talking about the DNA of
[1:28:42] almighty God we're talking about the
[1:28:45] predestinated plan of almighty God we're
[1:28:48] talking about the Lord God who said I
[1:28:51] Will Bless Thee I will do this I have
[1:28:55] already
[1:28:58] what does that do when that Revelation
[1:29:01] is striking the heart of the believer it
[1:29:03] brings rest
[1:29:06] it's bringing rest that's why the
[1:29:08] preaching of this Revelation is so
[1:29:10] important because it is a message of
[1:29:13] rest
[1:29:14] that's what the seventh seal is it's
[1:29:16] Christ Among Us it's a relaxing time not
[1:29:20] a relaxing in solemn but it's arresting
[1:29:22] in our souls it's arresting in him and
[1:29:25] who am I whom I know and whom I have
[1:29:27] believed and I am persuaded that he is
[1:29:29] able to keep that which I've committed
[1:29:32] unto him against that day it's resting
[1:29:35] in his work
[1:29:36] in our lives
[1:29:39] see we're not resting in what we saw on
[1:29:42] deep calls to deep or what we've heard
[1:29:43] on the tape but we've met that same God
[1:29:48] we've met that same God
[1:29:50] that's what this message came to bring
[1:29:52] to you and I that where veils of
[1:29:55] tradition was hiding God from the people
[1:29:58] but the message of the hour it loosens
[1:30:02] or breaks the veils that we can see God
[1:30:05] plainly
[1:30:07] and see that way back into the holiest
[1:30:10] of Holiness to see that way back into
[1:30:12] ground that we can stand as Sons and
[1:30:14] Daughters of God and to know that we're
[1:30:16] not standing there as Beggars we're not
[1:30:19] standing there as fees we're not
[1:30:20] thanking it robbery we are looking at
[1:30:23] the blood sacrifice that has went before
[1:30:25] us Worthy is the Lamb to receive richest
[1:30:30] Power Glory and Honor
[1:30:34] um
[1:30:35] can I have just a few more moments
[1:30:41] this scripture when it says and found us
[1:30:45] his heart faithful before thee and made
[1:30:47] a covenant with him that word found us
[1:30:50] there in the scripture
[1:30:53] you know sometimes when you look at
[1:30:54] things and you just wait and you say
[1:30:55] there's something there
[1:30:57] and then as I was looking at it before
[1:30:59] but then they came across here and this
[1:31:02] week I'm just just to the Lord begins to
[1:31:04] drop on your heart I said let me just
[1:31:06] let me look at that again oh and I'm
[1:31:08] looking and then the Holy Spirit just
[1:31:09] begin to Quicken some things on that and
[1:31:12] I'm don't worry I'm not going to preach
[1:31:13] any longer on it it's just a simple
[1:31:15] thought a point but and found us his
[1:31:18] heart faithful this word foundus means a
[1:31:21] covering
[1:31:23] like the covering of the skins
[1:31:25] of the Tabernacle
[1:31:28] it's covering that went over the ark
[1:31:32] but Samuel what is it thou found us his
[1:31:34] heart faithful
[1:31:35] God
[1:31:37] uncovered
[1:31:39] and let there be a display that would
[1:31:41] come
[1:31:43] on Mount Moriah
[1:31:46] all along here we see faithfulness that
[1:31:49] through the
[1:31:50] through all the wanderings through the
[1:31:52] ups the Downs through the Genesis 13
[1:31:55] Genesis Genesis 16. here we have that
[1:31:59] even Abraham stand there in Genesis 17
[1:32:01] and Abraham looks and God says you know
[1:32:04] because Abraham is convinced even in
[1:32:06] that in Genesis 17 think think of this
[1:32:08] think
[1:32:09] God has just filled him with his spirit
[1:32:12] and changed his name
[1:32:16] you see where we're at
[1:32:18] and even where we're at standing right
[1:32:20] there that's why this word the strength
[1:32:23] of el shadiah of Elohim
[1:32:26] is to take us Beyond human ability or
[1:32:30] the thought of it because Abraham's
[1:32:33] thought of human ability caused him to
[1:32:36] say oh that Ishmael might live before
[1:32:38] thee
[1:32:41] foreign
[1:32:43] God just acted like he didn't even say
[1:32:45] nothing went right over the top of it
[1:32:48] you ever felt that way sometimes and I
[1:32:50] just felt that way God just went right
[1:32:51] over the top of it
[1:32:55] oh yeah
[1:32:56] oh yeah
[1:32:58] but God lets him know but my seed
[1:33:01] was shall I asked my promise my Covenant
[1:33:04] shall I establish with Isaac that only
[1:33:11] God even gave him the name what was
[1:33:14] coming
[1:33:17] because Isaac means laughter
[1:33:20] and we're and where Abraham thought
[1:33:22] listen in Abraham's natural part oh we
[1:33:25] can see this here you find a faithful
[1:33:27] thou foundest his heart faithful it's
[1:33:29] not wrote right here in Nehemiah it's
[1:33:32] not wrote in Romans 4 in the Divine
[1:33:35] commentary that Abraham laughed
[1:33:41] it's not wrote there
[1:33:43] why because notice God looking upon the
[1:33:48] heart
[1:33:49] and God dealing with the heart it could
[1:33:52] not pass through the mercy see I can't
[1:33:55] do this with my Bible uh because I'm
[1:33:58] afraid of my Bible it will actually uh
[1:34:00] you know come apart because I've already
[1:34:02] got kind of loose but if I could hold
[1:34:03] this part up right here and hold these
[1:34:06] papers up right here that is between the
[1:34:08] Old Testament and New Testament you
[1:34:10] realize what was in the old could not
[1:34:11] pass through the blood and get to the
[1:34:13] new
[1:34:15] and that's why your name has been
[1:34:18] transferred from the old book into the
[1:34:22] new book
[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:23] [Applause]
[1:34:24] it can't pass through the blood
[1:34:28] well what passes through the blood well
[1:34:30] what comes out on the other side a son
[1:34:33] and daughter of God so what is actually
[1:34:35] mentioned by God is what was a Son of
[1:34:38] God is what was a daughter of God
[1:34:41] because the rest of it didn't matter
[1:34:46] it was growing pains
[1:34:52] Hallelujah
[1:34:54] God allows it for you and I that our
[1:34:57] Humanity that we're our thought of human
[1:35:00] ability and yourself brother Samuel I
[1:35:03] don't deal with that no more we do deal
[1:35:05] with that many times we still deal with
[1:35:07] it and that's the very thing that we
[1:35:10] must master and overcome
[1:35:15] continuously
[1:35:17] is the thought of human ability
[1:35:21] sometimes the thought of human ability
[1:35:22] is just doing about things that we can't
[1:35:24] do nothing about
[1:35:28] and if you just just wait on the Lord
[1:35:33] don't worry he'll tell you why don't you
[1:35:35] just commit it to me
[1:35:40] some things I had on my heart I was
[1:35:42] praying and praying and praying I'm
[1:35:43] hearing praying praying praying and here
[1:35:45] I am I'm just just sitting in a simple
[1:35:47] spot and you know I'm just praying and
[1:35:49] the Holy Spirit just dropped down right
[1:35:50] there and said why don't you just commit
[1:35:53] it to me
[1:35:56] and as soon as he said that
[1:35:59] I said forgive me Lord
[1:36:01] that's exactly right
[1:36:03] I committed to you but Samuel what was
[1:36:06] the result just from that moment
[1:36:08] burden lifted
[1:36:11] things didn't dry up or things didn't
[1:36:13] soared all the way out but it lifted
[1:36:16] and the confidence is he's in control
[1:36:20] committing it to him
[1:36:23] so God uncovered or was unveiling in
[1:36:27] Abraham's life himself
[1:36:31] I'm finished here
[1:36:35] brother Brown says it like this I'm
[1:36:37] going to close on this course outspoken
[1:36:39] word's Original Seed I just
[1:36:41] I just feel like that
[1:36:44] this is this is it right here
[1:36:48] brother Brian was dealing with the
[1:36:50] predestinated
[1:36:52] working of the Lord Jesus
[1:36:56] and he's talking about how Isaiah came
[1:36:57] as a predestinated witness
[1:37:01] and he said Jesus came for a witness of
[1:37:04] the death burial and resurrection that
[1:37:06] man will die but live again through him
[1:37:09] for he is the seed that has to come up
[1:37:12] and he said predestinated as he was
[1:37:16] makes the word seed flesh in you his
[1:37:20] church God's word
[1:37:22] predestinated as he was makes the word
[1:37:25] seed flesh in you his church God's word
[1:37:28] see that's why with the reality of
[1:37:30] predestination
[1:37:32] it's just simply establishing God's mind
[1:37:36] and God before the foundation of the
[1:37:39] world
[1:37:40] I was with God
[1:37:43] I was with God there's a and that's
[1:37:46] that's where the revelation of Jesus
[1:37:48] Christ makes that a living reality
[1:37:52] that's what the Holy Ghost comes to do
[1:37:55] it's the strength that comes into our
[1:37:58] lives to make that real to us so we've
[1:38:01] got a foundation that's not our efforts
[1:38:07] is that right
[1:38:10] sure brother Branham every word I
[1:38:12] believe it he said then don't back up
[1:38:13] when you get to your tradition stay with
[1:38:15] that word and stay with that and Watch
[1:38:18] What Happens say oh Lord I believe it
[1:38:21] send the Holy Spirit then watch then if
[1:38:25] he goes to bearing record then you know
[1:38:27] you got it not by some sensation because
[1:38:30] the Devils do that not by some miracle
[1:38:32] the Devils do that but by your constant
[1:38:35] belief in the word of God and the life
[1:38:39] that you live never denying nothing
[1:38:45] thank you
[1:38:46] faithful thou foundest his heart
[1:38:49] faithful
[1:38:50] that makes the word becoming fleshy
[1:38:53] flesh
[1:38:54] and the same water and spirit and he
[1:38:57] said Jesus was the Seed of Abraham
[1:39:00] fleshly speaking now just just watch
[1:39:02] this here he fleshly speaking a
[1:39:05] predestinated Seed of Abraham and when
[1:39:07] the spirit fell on him
[1:39:09] what kind of a life did he bring so he
[1:39:13] was a predestinated seat of Abraham of
[1:39:15] that Faith he brought a Faith Life what
[1:39:18] kind of a life and what shall build
[1:39:20] around says this you mean he's going to
[1:39:22] be a Sojourner like Abraham
[1:39:25] said that's where people get so mixed up
[1:39:27] today they try to think that a man of
[1:39:30] God has to do this and follow this and
[1:39:32] do that so you see what brother Brown he
[1:39:34] breaks in on that thought you mean he's
[1:39:36] going to be a Sojourner like Abraham in
[1:39:38] other words if we're a real Seed of
[1:39:40] Abraham we're going to buy a tent and
[1:39:42] just go around like nomads
[1:39:45] Abraham wasn't a nomad but you
[1:39:46] understand what I'm saying that's what
[1:39:48] brother Brahm is saying it's not us
[1:39:50] trying to be like someone else it's us
[1:39:54] yielding and Christ Living his life out
[1:39:58] through you and I
[1:40:00] that's the faith of Abraham
[1:40:04] it's not acting like this one or acting
[1:40:06] like that it was Christ in Elijah Christ
[1:40:09] in Moses Christ in job Christ in Moses
[1:40:13] none of them were the same
[1:40:16] you and I are not the same and God
[1:40:19] doesn't want us to be the same
[1:40:21] but what he does want is that be the
[1:40:24] same Christ in you and I the same life
[1:40:27] the same objective the same God the same
[1:40:30] purpose Christ in you and me the hope of
[1:40:34] glory
[1:40:36] God's interested not in reproducing a
[1:40:41] man he's interested in reproducing
[1:40:44] himself that's why Eve was given to Adam
[1:40:49] woo man that she would be that for
[1:40:53] Adam's image to be reproduced in and
[1:40:57] that's why Christ comes to the elected
[1:41:01] seed because the seed is that good
[1:41:04] ground
[1:41:05] that when the seed is sown
[1:41:08] it's a place
[1:41:10] where Christ
[1:41:12] can reflect himself through our lives
[1:41:16] so just as much
[1:41:19] as God
[1:41:20] founded Abraham's heart
[1:41:24] faithful
[1:41:25] that's the same thing
[1:41:27] that God
[1:41:28] is doing in the life of his people
[1:41:33] just as he took the seals off of himself
[1:41:37] he's taking the seals off of you
[1:41:41] he's uncovering
[1:41:43] now the rest of the world the arrest of
[1:41:46] the world the outside world says
[1:41:48] you're really no different yeah you're a
[1:41:50] pretty good guy you know you do this you
[1:41:52] don't do that you don't do they don't
[1:41:53] they don't know what's behind it
[1:41:56] all they see is that bad your skin as
[1:41:57] brother Jerry was preaching all they see
[1:41:59] is the covering that God sees behind the
[1:42:02] covering him and see whatever is behind
[1:42:04] the covering the glory of God is being
[1:42:07] veiled in your life
[1:42:09] then the works of God you do
[1:42:13] it comes out
[1:42:15] it's not something we're trying to do
[1:42:19] it's what God is doing through us
[1:42:21] do we have to give ourselves sure we
[1:42:23] have to give ourselves to God and God
[1:42:25] continues to mold and shape in our life
[1:42:27] I wish I could have really got to read
[1:42:29] Genesis 22 but we just we couldn't get
[1:42:32] there but just to refer to that
[1:42:36] God when it all was said and done
[1:42:39] and Abraham's
[1:42:41] hand was raised with that knife
[1:42:43] God the angel of the Lord spoke and said
[1:42:46] stay thy hand
[1:42:48] for now I know us
[1:42:52] that thou loveest me more than
[1:42:56] even thine only son
[1:43:02] what was on display
[1:43:04] what was it that was on display on Mount
[1:43:07] Moriah
[1:43:09] same Mountain where our Lord was
[1:43:10] crucified
[1:43:12] what was uncovered there the
[1:43:14] faithfulness of God
[1:43:16] what was uncovered in Abraham's life he
[1:43:19] found us his heart faithful what was it
[1:43:22] it was God's faithfulness all along and
[1:43:26] Abraham had received that faithfulness
[1:43:29] and walked by it
[1:43:31] is so molded his life God's faithfulness
[1:43:35] working through his life
[1:43:37] to where Abraham would be able to walk
[1:43:39] to that place of Mount Moriah
[1:43:41] to the place of rapture to the place of
[1:43:44] the body change
[1:43:46] without
[1:43:48] any torment of Genesis 16.
[1:43:53] without any torment of his failures of
[1:43:57] his mistakes
[1:43:59] how was that possible because God was
[1:44:03] faithful
[1:44:05] and he's faithful to you and me
[1:44:09] so when it's all said and done out of
[1:44:12] all of our lives
[1:44:14] the eulogy I know can be wrote in many
[1:44:16] many ways they can have we can have
[1:44:19] wrong eulogies but when it's all said
[1:44:21] and done
[1:44:22] it comes down to like God wrote it
[1:44:25] in Romans 4.
[1:44:27] and even in Romans 9.
[1:44:31] not all the in-between things
[1:44:34] because remember the prophet said it's
[1:44:36] what you do
[1:44:37] for the Lord
[1:44:39] that counts
[1:44:41] that's what matters in the end do we
[1:44:43] have to work yeah we have to work do we
[1:44:44] have to yeah we have to labor do we have
[1:44:46] to pay bills yes we have to pay bills do
[1:44:48] it yes yes yes yes all of that but when
[1:44:51] the commentary is all said and done
[1:44:53] there's not going to be one part there
[1:44:55] in that commentary outside of Christ
[1:44:58] himself being glorified
[1:45:00] there might be things that's mentioned
[1:45:02] about the job
[1:45:03] but to where that we stood for him
[1:45:08] pulled this way but we stood for him
[1:45:11] put him before other things but we'll
[1:45:13] certainly stand there on that day and
[1:45:15] say Lord it was because of your
[1:45:17] faithfulness
[1:45:20] not by works that I have done
[1:45:23] but your faithfulness Lord
[1:45:25] when I felt like giving up you were
[1:45:29] faithful to encourage me in the promises
[1:45:34] when I felt like I can't make another
[1:45:36] step you were faithful Lord Lord you
[1:45:39] remember that Thursday night you came
[1:45:41] along my way Lord you remember that
[1:45:43] night when you walked me and you spoke
[1:45:45] to me there Lord you remember Lord
[1:45:47] through that message Lord you are
[1:45:49] faithful
[1:45:51] and I'm standing here because of your
[1:45:54] faithfulness to your word
[1:45:56] that even when I was in despair even
[1:45:59] when I was indestruct you are faithful
[1:46:01] to your word
[1:46:03] it's his word inside of you and me
[1:46:07] God is faithful to his word
[1:46:12] listen why would you say that because if
[1:46:14] it's based on me if it's based on this I
[1:46:17] see no reason for him to be faithful
[1:46:19] here
[1:46:20] but when it comes to his word he's the
[1:46:23] god of his word
[1:46:24] [Applause]
[1:46:25] he's faithful to his word and they can
[1:46:28] say God by your grace I'm a part of that
[1:46:30] word Lord God it resonates in my heart
[1:46:33] there's an amen shall be it Lord
[1:46:36] a constant belief never denying nothing
[1:46:39] when the word shows along our pathway
[1:46:42] and there's something we can say Lord
[1:46:44] I'm deficient in that in my life but so
[1:46:47] be it Lord in my life what is it a
[1:46:50] constant belief never denying nothing
[1:46:54] be it unto me Lord God
[1:46:56] according to that word a seed of Abraham
[1:47:02] don't you love him
[1:47:08] Hallelujah
[1:47:10] oh when it's all said and done
[1:47:12] Just Give Me Jesus
[1:47:15] when it's all said and done
[1:47:18] brothers or sisters it might only be
[1:47:20] Brother Ray mine might only be a part it
[1:47:22] may it may be as short as Jesus wept
[1:47:25] that scripture but if it's him
[1:47:28] whatever it is it's him
[1:47:31] when it's all said and done
[1:47:34] like Abraham's commentary it's where
[1:47:37] Abraham was regarded as faithful
[1:47:41] if there's no other word that can be
[1:47:44] said about Samuel Browning I would say
[1:47:48] God granted with all my heart
[1:47:50] it's not I want to be that that you know
[1:47:53] that like we're trying to do something
[1:47:54] that you gave everything from me
[1:48:00] well I left out of here in last Last
[1:48:02] Friday morning because I was going along
[1:48:04] I began to think about the faithfulness
[1:48:07] of the Lord Jesus we had spoke on it but
[1:48:10] he was faithful in the midst of facing
[1:48:13] Calvary
[1:48:14] he was faithful weeping heard with
[1:48:18] strong crying and tears in that he
[1:48:21] feared
[1:48:22] but he was faithful
[1:48:26] it just
[1:48:27] it just rung my heart out there on
[1:48:29] Friday morning said oh God thank you for
[1:48:31] being for your faithfulness thank you
[1:48:34] for your faithfulness Lord he's been
[1:48:36] faithful
[1:48:38] and he is faithful
[1:48:40] don't you love him
[1:48:42] oh I just all I want to do with the
[1:48:45] musicians would come and we'd sing sing
[1:48:47] that song I know it's an old one maybe
[1:48:49] brother Brian has a different one but I
[1:48:51] think of that song all I want to do is
[1:48:52] love him
[1:48:54] so glad he gave his life for me
[1:48:57] Oh my he is worthy
[1:48:59] He's Worthy
[1:49:02] of our life he's worthy of all
[1:49:05] oh God he's worthy
[1:49:08] oh my how we just love the Lord let's
[1:49:10] just
[1:49:11] let's just ask the Lord's blessing here
[1:49:14] upon the word
[1:49:16] Heavenly Father
[1:49:19] thank you Lord for your mercy here
[1:49:21] tonight Lord
[1:49:23] Jesus
[1:49:27] thank you Lord for
[1:49:29] taking us Lord in this
[1:49:32] this pathway tonight this vain Lord
[1:49:36] oh God you know Lord you know what
[1:49:39] you're doing Lord
[1:49:41] I just Lord as these thoughts Lord I
[1:49:44] know
[1:49:46] there's a reason and a purpose Lord I
[1:49:48] know My Heart Lord has been encouraged
[1:49:50] tonight
[1:49:51] and I I pray that God
[1:49:53] that Lord the rest Lord of your children
[1:49:56] just drawing comfort from your word
[1:49:59] drawing comfort from you Lord
[1:50:02] oh God that Lord
[1:50:05] it's you at work Lord in our lives and
[1:50:08] we believe that
[1:50:10] but sometimes the lord it's things that
[1:50:12] seems so hard to see
[1:50:14] but God
[1:50:16] as we say Genesis 22.
[1:50:21] Lord we don't see that in Genesis 12.
[1:50:23] matter of fact back in Genesis 11 when
[1:50:26] the Lord had said unto Abram get thee
[1:50:29] out of the land of thy country
[1:50:31] but Lord you knew what was in Abraham
[1:50:35] you knew Lord
[1:50:38] when that scripture when it says God the
[1:50:40] Lord did tempt in Genesis 22 that word
[1:50:44] tempt
[1:50:45] is the word in the Hebrew that it's to a
[1:50:48] say
[1:50:50] which means as they drill into the Earth
[1:50:54] and take out a core sample
[1:50:56] to determine is there precious or and
[1:51:01] medals beneath the surface
[1:51:04] Lord
[1:51:06] you wanted to show
[1:51:10] not only what was the neighbor's heart
[1:51:13] but what was in your heart
[1:51:16] and we look at that scripture and as
[1:51:18] we're standing here and we see Genesis
[1:51:21] 22.
[1:51:22] that's a bride promised scripture Lord
[1:51:26] that's a scripture Lord where what's
[1:51:28] being brought out of our life
[1:51:30] it's Christ
[1:51:33] it's us the Lord becoming one
[1:51:36] becoming one with you
[1:51:40] Lord recognize
[1:51:42] it's you
[1:51:44] it's you that's working
[1:51:46] through all of these tests through these
[1:51:48] trials that you permit in your infinite
[1:51:50] wisdom to come our way
[1:51:53] Lord
[1:51:55] granted that
[1:51:57] our hearts
[1:51:59] Lord remaining loyal
[1:52:02] in the midst of these times
[1:52:05] Lord through that loyalty
[1:52:08] give you praise Lord
[1:52:10] to stand steadfast in the word of God
[1:52:15] and Lord through it Lord calling out to

[1:59:38] [Applause]
[1:59:41] my redeemer is true
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:51] aren't you glad just as God was with
[1:59:53] Abraham
[1:59:55] God's with you
[1:59:57] through every place that's been
[2:00:00] traversed I come back to this scripture
[2:00:02] being confident of this one thing he
[2:00:04] that begun the good work in you
[2:00:07] will perform it
[2:00:09] until the day of Jesus Christ
[2:00:12] it's God at work
[2:00:17] I wonder if it had been you or I
[2:00:18] remember how brother Branham talks about
[2:00:20] he says he says if it was me he says and
[2:00:23] I gave you my word and you said ah I
[2:00:27] don't know
[2:00:28] he said if it was me he said I'd say
[2:00:30] well if you can't take my word
[2:00:32] he said but not God
[2:00:34] he said God
[2:00:35] [Music]
[2:00:37] puts ministering gifts
[2:00:39] he said to go in there
[2:00:42] and that God works for that gift to
[2:00:44] raise our faith in his word
[2:00:48] that he said is God's love gifts
[2:00:52] see God knows even think think about
[2:00:54] this at times it's sometimes where we're
[2:00:57] at like where Abraham was sometimes
[2:00:59] looking at situations that are before us
[2:01:03] listen the gift is not man
[2:01:06] it's God
[2:01:08] gift is to get ourselves out of the way
[2:01:11] that God is present
[2:01:14] so then our faith is lifted in God
[2:01:18] when you looked and I looked and see
[2:01:20] there's no way I don't see a way through
[2:01:23] this but God comes and here we are
[2:01:27] looking at the word but then God will
[2:01:28] come just like he did to Abraham and he
[2:01:31] lifts our faith
[2:01:33] you walk out of a service and you're
[2:01:36] strengthened
[2:01:37] you're encouraged
[2:01:39] you
[2:01:40] you you you you get up from praying or
[2:01:42] you know from where you've been sitting
[2:01:44] praying laying whatever and you and you
[2:01:45] walk out and you're there's
[2:01:46] encouragement
[2:01:48] where did that come from
[2:01:52] it came from
[2:01:53] almighty God
[2:01:57] because I just say friends a man to a
[2:02:00] man we love one another
[2:02:02] but it takes more than a man's word to
[2:02:04] encourage us
[2:02:05] because if that be sold it could be me
[2:02:08] just trying to brother Shane just trying
[2:02:10] to convince you or brother Brian trying
[2:02:11] to convince you
[2:02:13] that's not what the ministering of the
[2:02:15] word's about not trying to convince Us
[2:02:19] in that way just lift him up
[2:02:22] let him be lifted up
[2:02:25] because in him all things are finished
[2:02:29] we can see he is my victory
[2:02:32] he is my peace
[2:02:34] so then we come out with a renewed
[2:02:37] vision
[2:02:39] it's God as it was through Abraham where
[2:02:42] Abraham's seed my
[2:02:45] it's God walking right here with us sure
[2:02:48] God brings correction to our life aren't
[2:02:50] you glad for that
[2:02:52] that's God's faithfulness
[2:02:54] God's a faithful parent to correct us
[2:02:57] all of those things along the way but
[2:02:59] God is faithful
[2:03:01] and it's his faithfulness
[2:03:04] his faithfulness to his word
[2:03:07] that what we saw on Mount Moriah is
[2:03:10] reflected in Abraham's life
[2:03:12] it come to such a place to where
[2:03:15] Abraham's life you would just
[2:03:17] Christ on display
