solemn moment boy Lord Jesus we have assembled here this morning or because we love you or declaring that side of which we are on God think Lord of how that Moses came down for the mountain that day and he spoke and he said who is on the Lord's Day let him come after me Lord Jesus here we are this is the Sunday morning Lord your God setting Lord here Lord to declare what sign that we're on Father I pray God that you would help us this morning help us Lord that you're got to be able to get out of the way Lord as speaker and hearer together Lord you know you know what we have needed more than many things Lord that would lay before me many things more than throughout the week Lord your God but yet we want to reserve ourselves Lord completely to you so we just ask the Lord that you would come and speak to our hearts and minister to each and every life I pray that God that you would give understanding Lord to our hearts nor things that may be that we have heard the Lord would you make a more real to us we just don't want to agree with the Lord or recognize them Lord in terms of knowledge but God that from within Lord there is an agreement more with the Word of God and we ask the Lord that you would further make your word real than alive in our lives or God may you come and speak to us this morning Lord God Lord remove that the man part Lord step aside that God that you might come and speak your God I pray that you would move among us in a special way Lord God our hearts would be touched and would be stirred Lord in your presence or Oh God that where is the truly declared Lord has through your visitation Lord you're walking up and down the aisles Lord God that all things are possible to them to be granted Lord Jesus this morning Lord Lord we need you Lord God help us Lord we pray now give ourselves to you Lord and asked if we've said or done anything Lord any fault that we would have entertained Lord that would be displeasing to in any way Lord God please forgive us Lord we pray Lord may you have your way Lord in the name of Jesus Christ let's turn to John chapter 3 certainly ask that you would just keep brother Jerry and myself in prayer we certainly covet your prayers Lord willing we'll be leaving out here on on Tuesday Tuesday morning and then there within the meetings that are set forth there and in in the Philippines and we have a it's a pretty solid schedule when we get there and we land we really we start with everything which will be I think more or less it'll be like on Friday evening there which would be Thursday here and so from that time on clear up to the night before we leave or the day before we leave there there are meetings that are set the whole time and some of that itinerary we don't we don't know brother o al has established the whole inchoate in ireri but we have been praying and looking to the Lord and just believing that God is directing all of these things and we certainly just really covered your prayers and that you would just keep us in prayer and well I don't want to say too much because I'll get all choked up but let's just go into the word here John chapter 3 verse 1 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews that came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God where no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with you jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born like we were looking at that last week that very much it shows that the confinement of their earthly thinking - even if a person could enter back in you still would come out with the same birth so this is a much different birth that the Lord Jesus is speaking of not one that has come according how you and I have come in our first birth but it would be a spiritual birth in verse 5 jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God now notice this this is the formula except a man be born of water of the word and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit Marvel not that I said unto thee he must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof that canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit when you are born of the Spirit of God you are a mystery to the world you become a paradox you are a paradox it's something that you cannot explain but you know has taken place verse 9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto Him art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and you receive not our witness may God bless you bless the reading of his word as you've been seated I'd like to continue to take that little fault that we were looking at just move a little further with it from cockle burrow to wheat life and I want to go right back into that quote at least to start from where brother Branham is referring to this many times in the great mystery as we were looking at that a few weeks back of how that it would be natural for us to go according to the pattern of the course of life of the way things had been set throughout many generations before us brother brems said it you know it would be natural he said it would have been hey I would have been a drinker but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses me from that and the key is I would have been and the thing the thing that makes the difference we know is the blood of Jesus Christ receiving the life that was within that blood cell coming back upon us as the worshipper and raising us up out of those natural genes where they no longer have the predominant part in our life but we have been delivered and then being delivered we are translated into the into that kingdom of his dear son it's really quiet a great a great thing that as we've just started to move into this a little bit of how that you find that even sickness itself and things can travel down through generations and certain things that we'll move within the genes and yet there are things that spiritually as well that can be handed down from one generation can pass from this generation to that generation how many times that the Prophet said that when he would stand there and he said dealing with a stubborn spirit he would trace that thing on back down through generations so it's something that where a person was actually given to that and then that spirit itself would would work in a manner to where he would actually be handed down didn't you say well how could that be handed down because there are things that were a spirit a spirit itself cannot work unless there is impressionable parts or things to be shown so then you find of how that those spirits some they would work in a manner that then impressions and those things would go forth much like teaching you understand it's teaching that would go on but yet teaching that wasn't where as far as someone's standing before you are I on saying now listen this is how we do this and how we do that but the most and the majority of our teaching is all the image that is placed before us it's not so much even words if we do things this way but it's just how we do it and that's where that we truly need the grace of God within our life we need the new birth and then by the new birth receiving the strength of God that our minds can actually be renewed by the Holy Spirit so that it's no longer the predominant part of our ways were no longer so much known by our family earthly name but we become known by the another name by the family name which is from heaven so this is this is the very working of God and certainly that there's no way that you and I can do this without the Lord and when we look at this this statement the brother Branham makes here in questions and answers part four he says how can I take a cockle burrow and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it the only way it can be is because inside that cockerel has been transmitted from a cockle burrow to a germ called wheat life so there's come about a change on the inside of the kokuboro he says now then you bury that Kaka burrow and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in the cocklebur now when we most the time when we look at a seed and probably some of you that are farmers and different things like that you know gardeners and things you can look at certain seeds especially if you order seeds you know out of the catalogue and things like that I guess they still have the catalog but you know my dad he would order the different seeds they would come in brown bags they would have him wrapped down and stapled up and he would have the certain sweet corn he always wanted and this certain thing that he want a certain melons and he would he would take those seeds now in those seeds they each and every one we all we know there were seeds but there were by looking at the seed on the outside he could look at it and say well this is this part of sweet corn its identified with this one and he could look at this seed and say well this is squash and he could look at this one say well this one is melon and you know when you're looking at the outside of the seed we would look at it in a manner and we you and I would identify seeds in that manner and when we loo when you think of it as far as within the scope of all of our lives on the outside its all cocklebur oh it would be natural and normal for you to look at your life and to recognize had it not been for the grace of God you would bear cocklebur a life but because there is another life on the inside that has been planted there by God and God has moved to raise up that life removing the other one and raising that life that he has sown within us then um the outside we look the same as far as the same old temple but on the inside there is a new life that has started and that new life that is started there is a developing there is a forming into the word image as that life itself has begun within us through the quickening through the birth and it continues to develop until eventually from out of this earth it reaches its peak of maturity and there comes a rapture or as the prophet uses the term in future home a trance planning and you know what a trance planning is it's where that if something has reached to a certain place in that pot it can no longer grow or further flourish and so there has to be removing from that place a transplanting into another place so God himself by the rapture is harvesting his own crop it's his crop that he's sown it's his crop that he is watered it's his crop that he is nurtured and it's his crop that he takes home with him so he's here to care and nurture that crop all along so when we're looking at this a great paradox within it of how that the grace of God would move down in our life and raise up that that that wheat life that was sown there within us and how the Prophet says the life of the kokuboro has been taken out but the nature of the kokuboro is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again anybody ever get tired of yourself that's a wonderful sign you get tired of certain things you think my goodness and you know you find things you think my goodness you know Here I am you know and you find you so many be getting frustrated here frustrated there that's not an excuse but remember perfection maturity is not when this thing becomes perfect oh I no longer make the same mistakes I know that's not in perfection and maturity but perfection and maturity is recognizing that opposing force as it's entering in see sometimes we get so caught up in the failure and in the mistake that we fail to recognize the advancement or the approach of the enemy and that's what real perfection and maturity it brings us to recognize of how God of how that the enemy would want to move in a bonus but perfection and maturity is not letting that thing continue that's where the Prophet said what is overcoming is to recognize the devil at every one of his trips and you know what he knows each and every one of us but there's one who knew us before he knew us that's the one that we have to pay attention to that's the one that we have to look to is that all right it's like this let me just drop this with you here and I'll move on it's it's select when you have when in the very beginning in the Garden of Eden you have where you know Eve here we know the fall has come about and here when she receives King comes forth she says I have gotten a man from the Lord she never says that about Abel let me put it this way if we're looking at the shelves in the house and we're looking at pictures the firstborn usually gets a lot of pictures so on this shelf it was Cain Cain Cain Abel King King King King King Abel King if you looked at King you would see Cain if you look real close to the pictures were in such a place it was like movement on the shelf there's not been a lot said in our life about Abel but it takes one who knows able to come and reveal Abel it's one who knows who you really are to really reveal to you not him who you really are because the picture you've looked at a lot of times and you stare at and you get down on is the Cain part but remember that man he came by a law of God but the one who come and really is of the Lord is Abel and that's the real picture that we have to look at that's the one that we have to stop looking and looking so much at all of those Cain pictures and look at that Abel picture right because Abel is Abel Abel is able to live an overcoming life when Abel is brought forth he's able to live an overcoming life so when we're looking at this front of the new birth which here is the Lord Jesus the very first doctrine that he preaches it must be born again this is this is the whole coming of the Messiah is to bring Redemption now in the midst of bringing Redemption we know that God comes down and he walks here in a body that is made in the likeness of sinful flesh Terrence's all of the tests and the temptations that you and I will go through he's doing that because remember the the the very promise is that he would take a priest there would be one that is taken from among the Brethren so he had to become one of us then how's he standing here and ministering to you and I of that you must be born again he's calling the attention that this is the hour see any even though types had been given down through the scripture it was not the hour to begin to call people to the new birth the word would come and you would find Israel being called back to something and then they would recede and fall away then they would be called back to it but then they would recede and fall away but this was a different hour this was not just a calling you know by the inspiration of the word that was pointing to that of redemption but here it was this was the hour that was pointing to that it was a time that man could actually come into a place and be born again what a privilege what an announcement that is going forth this is the Lord Jesus himself preaching the precursor of the acceptable year he's letting it be known that the feast itself these things that have been in type aren't ready to be set in motion and be fulfilled notice when we're looking at this who can be when you think of this who can be reborn because this subject of being born again in new birth it's a subject that has been spoke on down through time it's a subject that this is the heart of what Satan has been after throughout the church ages this is the very thing - that's where that that Satan began what he produced a sterile priesthood a group of individuals that with all that was was deeds and doctrine but they were denying the very visitation the Lord Jesus Christ and not just something back there on Calvary they were and they were denying his presence now coming in fulfilling that of the Messiah and the Holy Spirit being given out that is Satan's objective is to take that away and produce a sterile priesthood a sterile people what is it back without power and authority but this unfolding of the plan I want to just look at that who can be reborn because when you see it it would you know the word when the word is preached it's the word is preached as though it's to everybody is that right it must be that way God God is not you know going down and and then just you know in some ways saying well I'm not gonna minister to this and Minister Betty he declares his word is his deliverance to everybody it's just like that in the time of Israel when there was a Jubilee the priest would ride through the land and sound the trumpet he was denoting that this was a time that you were in slavery can go free the choice became the individual who was in slavery whether they wanted to go free because that trumpet would let them know there's so much that sounded in that trumpet that didn't let them know you can throw down you can stop immediately what you're doing you don't have to all of a sudden come into a place and I'm no longer gonna do this I'm no longer gonna do that but you can by the authority of that sounding throw down that which you were doing you can cast it down Wow by the authority of the word that is sounding out it's not something that anybody else that that could be done to release them back into their inheritance it was a solemn act of Almighty God there was an appointed time when there would come a sounding and when that sounding came they had authority to go back to their inheritance you see they were going to something that was always there's this life this eternal life it always was yours hey man you didn't earn an inheritance unit gaining inheritance you always had an inheritance but there's got to be somebody come on the scene that can bring you to your inheritance this is the coming of the Messiah this is the coming of the Lord Jesus this is what the new birth is all about is to bring you back to your inheritance hallelujah so to look at these things if these are things that the enemy has wanted to tear down then you see traditions themselves God can allow traditions to go for a period of time you understand what I'm saying they can let it go in a manner to where that the new birth listen to me now carefully that the new birth is a matter of perseverance the new birth is not a matter of perseverance you're putting it you cannot put the new birth based on human strength it is not something that you and I can't attain to on our own it is God solemnly it's not a church it's not a prophet it's God solemnly the scripture says by one spirit we are baptized into one body it's not our strength it's our yielding these things when the Spirit of God coming in this hour how much those of you that know as you've been listening to the message you find how it homes so definitively as the message goes in right an election the prophet doesn't pull back from that it homes further in he homes it in tighter and tighter and tighter moving moving getting it right you say well yeah I understand I was elected but you see friends sometimes there's fragments of traditions back come with these things and it's not something that the prophet brought it's things that sometimes traditions that's back there that them fragments want to come on over and we're still looking at election through the fragments of tradition we're looking at election as though God look down and God said oh my Sandra's gonna make a choice to serve me I'm predestinate him that's not three destination come on somebody they meant that's called arminianism that's called me having something to do with it and because I did this God said I see him and I'm going to give him eternal life that's not election good fault did God see my choice yes but what is my choice that choice that he already made so it's not my perseverance as far as who I'm really going to attain this I'm gonna sure when the word of promise comes across our pathway it stirs something in us it causes something to rise in our hearts that even we can't explain I don't care if you sent around the message for years when God begins to deal with your heart it stirs something up within you that you cannot even explain as a matter of fact the Prophet put it this clearly in the Easter Show he said it's contrary to your own nature contrary to us what part of us the cocklebur part this is the power of God at work it's a sovereignty of God at work so when we're looking at this of the new birth this is God Himself making a way for himself to come and and bring to you and I that life hallelujah you know my mother and father came together and here here you and I came and here we are born of that woman tree right the woman tree that received the knowledge from the tree of good and evil and it produced and here we come back a sexual birth what the woman tree all that does as the Prophet tells us and then the book of Job the man that is born of a woman is a few days old and a all the trouble but there's got to come another birth and if there's gonna come another birth there's gotta be one who's able to lead me into that birth and deliver me my momma so this this is an unfolding of the plan of redemption this is God unfolding this plan this is not something that we realize that just started here within time but it's back way before the eternities in the mind of God before Adam Stardust or molecule this plan of redemption was already set forth in the mind of God revelation 13:8 said that the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world in the mind of God Joe picks it up and said that the morning stars shouted for joy who wasn't in rejoicing in our salvation mom I hear God must unfold that it's not it's not enough just for that to be known but God must unfold that plan of redemption and the only way that he can do it is laid everything in pipes and shadows but he himself who who alone is able to bring us into this place he must become one of us now what you just to look at this here just a moment in the message in the submerging church age the Prophet said in very plain language the true Bride of Christ was in the mind of God eternally though not expressed until each came forth in the designated decreed season as each member came forth it became expressed and took its place in the body thus this bride is the literal spoken word see Bride amen and those she is feminine in designation she is also called the body of Christ it is very apparent that she to be called that for she was predestinated in him came from the same source was eternal with him and he is now manifesting God in a mini membered body whereas once God was manifested in one member even our Lord Jesus Christ so here the bride the spoken word she brought so there is laid out very clear that the bride itself is is that part of the word and when the word itself is declared for that season here we come into this life here we are born into this life but and here we are coming into an expression but there must come the word across there wait there's only one thing that can release you and I and that's the word that's the person of Christ himself and when he comes by your way remember it's not just a word it must be the Living Word it must be the living image not just a sermon about Eagles it's gotta be the eagle that passes over because we're not just talking about an image that leaves it up in your mind but it must be a living image that flies over your life now he says notice here we are coming to a conclusion has the eternal logos God was manifest in the son and in Jesus dwelt all the fullness of the Godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son God manifested in flesh not to separate people but God created a body for himself to come and dwell in it remember we were looking as that God created a body and God stepped down at the River Jordan and he redeemed or claimed back what he had created what is that he's unfolding of the very pattern of what it is for every Alexa and daughter of God it's God coming down and claiming what belongs to him but he had to create a body he couldn't just come and just claim you and I as we were but he had to come and there had to be a shedding of the blood that that life could move in upon us it's him he moves all of that in this the Father manifested that gained the title of son become a son of man remember that confused him then they couldn't understand that they called him Beelzebub they cast everything up they didn't understand that the visitation the revealing of the son of man this was not just another inspiration pointing to Redemption to come Redemption has come that's why in this age it's not a portion of the Holy Ghost the entire Holy Ghost visits the church what is it it's the revealing of the son of man Christ behind your flesh God demonstrated God showed to you and I I'm still the same God he raised up out of all of when the church he just he raised up and he made himself known that he is the same yesterday today and forever not just a sign that he came with a word because listen friends the sign alone gets our attention what to come right back to the word what did Jesus do on the road to Emmaus he didn't come and try to persuade them that I'm him look at me look at this look at that but he took them into the word why he wanted them to recognize him by the word because that's how his children will recognize him his by the word not by our intellect of the word but it's when that word it's calling out to you and I and it is speaking to the depths of our life and we see that and say yes that's who I am remember the Spirit of God moved an inspiration upon the prophets they would speak in divine utterance and it would pull back but on this one this was different John well you see the Spirit descend and remain this is different now this is not moving in and pulling back moving in and pulling back but remaining upon this said the same is he that baptizes with the Holy Ghost Redemption has come this is not just speaking of Redemption but now here is he standing here with the Redeemer anointing upon his life amen the Messiah standing here upon earth my my even so we look at this now he's bringing it down to us even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn it's like a play became the many membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in flesh are the sons of God even as we are so called now watch this we did not become seed by the rebirth no sir you did not become a son of God by being reborn see you did you say no Samuel that's an understandable point but what I'm trying to tell you this is that there are things that we don't want traditions hanging on it as though that sometimes who in my life you know one day in my life when all of a sudden I read you know the scriptures and I started praying God put a seed in my heart that is Error when you were born as you entered into this world that was a seed placed in you right then not something that you desire not something I wanted or you on it that seed was in us the whole time any other way it puts us got something to do with it well you know I read a book one day I heard a message one day and all of a sudden it's a seed of God came in me that's error always was seed now let me just let's develop this here we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn a lot of things are spoken about the new birth but only the elect can be reborn now you might have been a part of a church and here you were out in other places and they told you just put your name on the book they told you that well as long as you believe as long as you believe that's all you've got to do is you just have to believe that is a partial truth but believing itself you must believe unto salvation unto the very fullness and quickening in your life so there's got to be listen it's got to me--one prescient that is the word himself that's able to lead you and I to life are you with me it takes more than a church to do that friends it's got to be the person of life himself and if God is not there to inspire that word God is not opening that word then there is no life as far as in terms of new birth I don't know about you but I just do not want emotion he motion will not last frenzied motion is fine it's wonderful I believe that you can be emotional but we just don't want where the Spirit of God moves in upon us and then after we leave out of here it pulls right back no the Spirit of God when it moves and upon your life it remains in quickens that see you may not feel it tomorrow you may not feel it the next day you may not feel like a Christian the next day but when that seed has been quickened you are sealed to your eternal destination it's not based on your clock of all feelings it's based on wheat life being raised up the Bible said the kingdom of God cometh without observation sometimes people are so interested in having a I know the date the time the place so many times people are so interested in that that they forget what is the true sign the true sign is what the spirit of truth when he has come he will lead and guide you into all truth it will be fruit that will be born out of your life that is the sign of the indwelling of God's Spirit it's wonderful if you know a place in a time in whatever more that's wonderful but friends listen all of those things that takes God to bring the divine establishment in our life to where that we recognize hey I'm not a talker burl I am a wheat plant mama where only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickening in non seed there is nothing to quicken true the Spirit of God can move upon can they call and say Lord I want to be safe sure but it doesn't there's nothing within to quicken quicken to what quickened to him quickened to become the expression of the word that's always been in their life but thank God that they can be saved but we're talking about being born again right in order to be born a father and mother there has to be to come together right so in order to have the new birth there must be a seed there on the inside that's able to receive seed life from the male that's able to receive that and getting to what express that image is that what the Lord Jesus spoke and taught us even in the book of Peter being born again of what of the incorruptible Word of God you know I went out here along the church on this side and I took a water and pill out here and I was out there just to water along on the on the ground I said buy more water these I'm gonna water these tomato plants hum little water you start looking too mean you think I know he's lost it for sure now I always thought there were problems with that guy but I know for sure you mind let me go on for a little bit and you thought well maybe maybe he planted us to me the plant there I don't know maybe just you know trying to make use of all the ground forests and things like that and I know he likes also maybe he just want a lot more tomatoes and things you know so I keep going I keep water in that same place after a while you start looking at how do you think he's been watering that an awful lot the first thing you asked me is did you plant any seed Dave did you plant something here oh no I didn't plant nothing there but I'm water a tomato plant you how in the world brother Sam no how can you ever bring forth tomatoes if you didn't plant anything let me say this to you the planting of God is not something present tense but the planting of God was before the foundation of the world in psalms chapter 1 blessed is that man what is he planted not will be not shall be but he is planted planted in what the promise of the word for the hour so there must be seed that's there to water in a notices hold this carefully in mind now take the next step redeem means to buy back it restores to the original owner God by his death and remember as a spirit he could not die but he had to be come from spirit to become a man so God created a body to step into a body purposed for death a body that he might express himself in God came down and become one of us friends don't ever let that become common to you because because without that we haven't we have no benefits but because that he had become one of us then you and I can enjoy the life that we have received from his offering up and by his resurrection and sending back that life you and I are being made and have been made partakers of the divine nature of God but his death the shed blood bought back his own he bought back the spoken-word seed bride remember how it was in the Old Testament they would have won that if the if the field or something the inheritance had been taken is there one that would have that would be a kin that would have the necessary means to purchase this right no man that none of us had the necessary means to purchase back what to get back through that tree of life God had it in that way that was everything most totally was set forth by God what that it gave him a reason and a purpose of being my God by his death the shed blood bought back his own he bought back the spoken-word see bride my sheep hear my voice the word and they follow me you always were a sheep you never wore a pig or a dog turned into a sheep we might have lived in that way but down beneath we were she Oh Oh when we entered into this with this earth we were always sheep we want to live like pigs and dogs but we were sheep but remember just looking on the outside of that seat as we said moments ago you could look at that seat and said no that's a sweet corn no that's a cockerel bro but there's a mystery inside of that sheep from the outside it might look like a pig in looks like this it looks like that but there is a mystery on the inside what is that mystery it is a sheep well if it's a sheep it means a shepherd and it's got to have a shepherd that knows who it is it's got to have a shepherd that's able to bring it out is that right that is impossible for every kind notice then what's impossible you never were a pig or adult turned into a sheet that is impossible for every kind of life produces the same kind and there is no change in specie I'm gonna make a statement right here I don't know why this book is so despised I don't understand that people have been made afraid and it's scared of the church age book shame on men that have done those things shame on them that is not that is not right to put that kind of a thing this right here by the Word of God it's setting out election it sets out what the true birth of the Holy Ghost is all about but I'll tell you a stream that I find I find a stream by those who stand against it and oppose it it still is very much opposed they have trouble when it takes away from fleshly demonstrations of the Holy Ghost listen you on the preset way oh yeah all - I'm the pastor here I'm responsible by God and I'm interested in tearing down every scarecrow because God never put that scarecrow up man put that scarecrow up they manage sets for that election it sets forth the real true baptism of the Holy Ghost [Applause] understand people can say I felt this I felt that and I felt this but no it's where is there a life is there a life that's lived by the word we could have all kinds of feelings and all kinds of sensations but zerubabbel with the plumb line with the plummet in his hand it's healed of measure and to see all the parts of Jerusalem and say is it mattering up to the word absolutely all to say that I still find that it's better that it's fought against and and still despised listen friends I ain't pickin on no one person or no one body I'm telling you as my congregation as those that come here and you hear the word you ought to shake away from all of those things if that stuff has been crammed in you you ought to denounce it in the name of Jesus Christ and pass that off that is a doctrine of man it is not the doctrine of the Holy Ghost as we were in the thoughts of God and then expressed in flesh there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word you understand the word it's not working you into something you understand right while the word is going forth you can be born again while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them Paul laid hands on those that's true come on somebody that's a life that is changed that's been quickened that's met God face to face revealing who you are there had to come a day when we would hear his voice the word and hearing that voice become aware of our Father calling us and recognized that we are the sons of God oh my think of this and let me just refer to this I I'm not going to put this up on the screen but think of how the Lord Jesus said it forth even in the Book of Luke he talked about having a hundred sheep one sheep was lost what did he do went and saved that she him saving it didn't make it a sheep it always was a sheep he talks about the woman she had the dead a Jew the Jew falls out in what she do sweep and clean and reclaim what is already hers that's redemption there can be things that you might feel like that there been a little something that's missing out of your life but what does it do it causes you to sweep come on friends if the rapture is going to be a sweep then you ought to be sweepers right sweeping to make sure everything is in order what is she doing she is claiming taking back seeking for what she knows belongs to her now in John chapter 10 my in John chapter 10 here we are spoken we are sheep of God now there's a lot of ways a lot of angels or we can minister and we can preach because it this word can be applied in John 10 it can be applied to to the age it can be applied to the local body it can be applied it can be applied right down into your home to apply it in your life there's many applications for it but what we want to look at and take this this angle is in Redemption in verse 1 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and robber so he's relating to be known the way of entrance we'll let you know who it is see that goes even down to your personal life what does a thief and a robber want to do come in and take something from you a thief wants to come in stealthily a robber will come in forcefully a thief can come in and insert a thought in your mind and you get drawn that thought and for you know it you're defeated a robber can come and just hit you hit you flat out straight forward now I'm bringing this down to a spiritual life but it applies here it comes into redemption he that does not come by the door he's a thief and a robber what is a thief and a robber about it's all about me me me me me me me me it's all about me you never sing that song the same way will you but he the interest in by the door not one but the door is the Shepherd of the sheep all of the Shepherd comes through the door that's the gun that that is a pre designation what is the door the door is the word the Shepherds gonna come through the door now stay with me now to him verse three to him the porter a--the the porter openeth so the Shepherd coming to the door the porter is standing there and the porter is the one that gives him entrance if he ain't the Shepherd the porter ain't giving him entrance you see how God had it all set forth that knew there was no other seed nothing could take you in deception you are always a sheep of God listen friends even when you and I were not aware of it the Holy Spirit was watching over her life God never forgot you never were out of sight out of mind he knew exactly because when you and I were born into this world we were expressed waiting to be manifested he knows he lee and lost track of one to him the porter openeth they men you see that's why it takes the Holy Spirit coming upon our life it takes the Holy Spirit what does the Spirit of God it's moving that what that the word can enter into our life he that is born of the water and of the Spirit and what none of us when the porter openeth the sheep hear his voice so we've got a door Shepherd Porter voice and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep me and leadeth them out so the Shepherd comes and he speaks to the Sheep he knows him by name they hear his voice and he leads them out leads no matter what leads him out from underneath the life where they were and the Shepherd comes to lead the Sheep forth amen it's got to come up when he the spirit of truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth it must be the Shepherd come to do what raise up the Sheep how does he done because he knows their name by his voice they hear his voice and when he put it forth oh I love that when he put it forth his own sheep he puts him forth he goes before them so he didn't before just put you out there's not putting you out when he has brought you forth he's going before you the paths are laid out you're following the shepherd the bishop of your soul he'll is committed to your care nor a difficult when the enemy would come in like a flood it's the Shepherd that's there in the door that's why the Holy Spirit is the seal upon the door it's Christ himself that seals the individual not your flesh not your spirit but he seals this you can sense things out in here but down in here there is a piece sometimes you wonder where that piece is at but yet beyond all the midst of it like what was preached here on Thursday night is something about it is such a great paradox that you know there is peace in the midst of a situation that you don't know how things are going to turn out how things are going to come out you don't even make sense to you to have that kind of a peace because you didn't produce it this is not a piece that's produced by man this is the peace of God and he goes before them and the Sheep follow him before they know his voice and the stranger they will not follow but flee from him for they know not the voice of strangers this parable spake Jesus unto them but they understood not what he was what he was saying verse 10 then he sent unto them I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers trying to take away but the Sheep did not hear them they did not have the voice to raise up sheep you with me there were thieves and robbers but the Shepherd he is the one alone that can raise up the Sheep I am the door by me oh I love the scripture If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture so now look out the Lord Jesus has moved in the first verses he's letting it be known he is the Shepherd of the Sheep you were sheep all the time then he moves it in now he's moving it along I am the door so he has become the entranceway he is the entranceway what he the word made flesh is the entranceway the promise is no longer just just I'll promise a future but now it is present are you with me and if any men notice he puts it back to choice we've got a choice right By Me If any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture he's speaking of the new birth they meant the entrance the the expression of of a sheep he's talking about when we enter in then he shall go in and out and find pasture come into a placement as the son of God as the sheep of God entering in by him by one spirit we're all baptized into one body been going in and out what is this going in and out David said even Solomon down lowing down and down through the scriptures he preserves my coming in and my going out my coming in and my going out then Solomon said teach me Lord how to be the king I don't know how to come in and I don't know how to go out but here right here what is the coming in and they're going out it is the character of life he is sitting right down to guide and direct and mold and shape our character and he will find pasture not just when you come to church it's not about a building but now you are birthed into the body of Jesus Christ and there is strength you can able to draw strength from that word you can be walking right down the middle of the store and here you are meditating on a promise of God and all of a sudden it drops right down and something just illuminates what is it you are in the pasture of the Lord and the Lord is speaking to you're not John not confined to a building but you are in his pasture feeding from him jesus said in verse 10 the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly I am The Good Shepherd is not saying that all that were before were false but I am bad the truth all others were types I am that true Shepherd I am The Good Shepherd where all the other shepherds could Karen and you know how God would set down among Israel and they would doing with a care a desire you know where David would have for the people of God but yet we see that imperfection even that lays there within man but here this is the Good Shepherd his whole intent his whole purpose it's never been about him it's been about you the whole plan of redemption it's been about him coming for you he I'm coming to clean you he I'm coming to take you he counted not his own life dear he laid his own life down he didn't have to he wasn't forced to remember he says I have been given commandment of my father I thought commandments were passed no Commandments are our divine utterance by God we're not talking about just Commandments things that are engraving and stone we're talking about a divine utterance of Almighty God here he is we've been given commandment of laying down his life it wasn't something that he that as far as within did not want to do the outside man listen to me now the outside man asked if it's possible let this cup pass from me come on friends where was when we see this in the garden of when we see this in the garden of gethsemane a struggle a battle was going on he had been submissive to the Father all the time we can look at many of the wonderful things here he goes down and the miracles that are performed it he goes here and he goes there but listen this was the climax right here where the purpose had reached right now he's come into the fullness of the purpose and right there in the Garden of Gethsemane every demon was gathered together tempting him you don't have to go through with this you don't have to keep going on you don't have to keep going through this you don't have to he felt that pool if it's possible let this cup pass from me John 12 my soul troubles right Hebrews 5 7 he was heard in that he was with fear and strong crying fear fear oh yes he experienced fear in the book of Mark the word that it uses right there when the midst of the time that he's in the garden the very word that it uses were that he is overcoming overwhelmed that very word speaks to the apex of depression that's exactly what that word means he experienced the greatness of that but he made a choice he loved the sunsets he loved the time with his brethren but he knew that he could not save them unless he gave himself away his love was so great that he did not keep himself back and his love led him to Calvary for you and me here he stands the tree of life the man tree those two trees in the garden were set for birth purposes here stands this man tree when he's here upon the earth this tree of life he says except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you what's he talking about partaking they had partaken of the other tree now in order to receive life you must partake of this tree how could they partake of it we could not get back to the Garden of Eden but it must be the tree of life had to become one of us Oh glory be to God what was God's desire here when you think for example let me just kind of have just a few more moments God and his coming is he is coming is to breed back sons and daughters of God again a lot of things I've seen him down the road here harvesting soybeans when they came in today no doubt many of these plants that they've planted along through here probably most of them are hybrids right hybrid can only produce hybrid when they have taken you know a part of that of an original and they have tried to genetically you know constructed here there or whatever more you see all of those things continues to break down it's brought us to a place even where we are in in our humanity right now things have been broken down naturally the foods we eat and everything else but to see how that within that you can never come back to an original the only thing you can produce is a high breeding but there must come an original and in coming an original the reason of that original there must be an original seed come that's able to raise up sons and daughters of God are you with me it's got to be seed that's here beneath this hybrid this first birth there's got to be seed there that's able to be raised up this is why where the scriptures would set it forth and I'm just I'm just phrasing and referring to a now this is where Paul would say that see that that first man that came was natural but the second man spiritual the first man was of the earth that first Adam but that second Adam it was a quickening spirit him was the Lord from heaven become that he might quicken and bring to life now notice within this here of how that God coming down and becoming one of us how that here we were in in in Paul refers us in the in the book of Galatians of how that we were in verse three we were in bondage even though we were children we were under we were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them what's redeemed by back what belongs to you to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons so there must come one God become one of us to take his own laws and live by him let me just drop this real clear he was the Virgin born son of god the Spirit of God sought him out in perfect obedience quicken that word and it became the word made flesh you with me now so here the Spirit of God moving down and quickening and raising up is the righteousness of God moving in there the Lord Jesus listen he was tempted in all points such as we are without sin he had dead listen he there had to be a perfect life and there's no way it could be a perfect life without God himself perfectly coming inside of him but notice the keeping of the law where he wasn't just that he did this and he did that and I don't do this and I don't do that it was by the righteousness where the desire on the inside I delight to do thy will o God daddy is the righteousness of God that is raised up you understand what I'm saying if you're looking at your life and trying to compare it to his life and say he was tempted without sin but I still make mistakes so that's not that's not your part the part is is the righteousness of God the holiness of God that has raised you up from within the desire has been quickened it's been raised up and he we have an advocate with the father we're not talking about a compromising defeating life we're talking about he had to be the perfect lamb there could not be one spot on him but couldn't be one thing notice when he said before God allowed him to come before the tribunal of the world I find no fault in him but religious people of that day they were they broke their own law by meeting in the Sanhedrin at that time they broke the law in trying to condemn him they couldn't find no fault in him so they're trying to bring false accusations against him but he was the perfect Lamb of God that was to be offered up and you and I were identified in that sacrifice when he went to Calvary we went to Calvary in it hello when he raised up on that resurrection morning we raised up with him glory be to God I need more time to drive that down but I'm not gonna I'm not gonna take it you say brother salmon why you say that cuz sometimes we get caught up in the righteousness of God and looking at this flesh I do this and I do that that's not the rights another god that's yours the righteousness of God is the seal of the Holy Ghost he hath made us he has made us accepted in the beloved sometimes friends is very important it's you mean to be careful on how you getting your eyes set cuz you can be looking at some one's character that's being transformed and you're saying this and saying that and not recognizing there's a son and daughter of God living right there well why they still doing this why they're still doing that why are you still doing that you're cocklebur stinks just as bad as theirs come on somebody you see that's something that self-righteousness that's the very thing the Prophet stood right in God in simplicity he addressed that thing we're not talking about self-righteousness he alluded to it people wearing just gonna wear white shirts and long-sleeve shirts he said that and I didn't say that self-righteousness that's not what the word come to produce it produces a holy desire the righteousness of God on the inside he calls you to himself you love him this morning this is where he said except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth owned if it die it bringeth forth much fruit here in quote here I want to I want to finish reading this part here and certain the Simonian church age they're right under yeah right there the Prophet said before I close this subject I know there is a question in your minds you want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre existence I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of the pre existence of souls any more than I believe in reincarnation or transmigration of souls be careful and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it now you catch that apply that back to weeks ago when the Prophet was saying now I can't believe that adultery is a predestinated seed what's he talking about the act are you with me the act because we showed brought in Rohan Ruth brought in Rahab brought in Kaleb there were curses on all of them Kaleb was a kin in sight his great great granddaddy Esau all right but the grace of God knew there was a seed down there do you understand it's not the person now listen let me to work with this a minute does the person himself does God know how that you would come your color your hair your color of your eyes and all those things sure but remember this has got to be changed just as this has changed that's why in things that are to be the Prophet let's you know that in the body change we're not all gonna pass through a miracle Weight Watchers and we're all gonna be different over there and we're gonna all of a sudden pass through and we're gonna get our noses straightened out and we're not going to have you know the big nose or this or that or that's not what it is are you with me I I would say that that that admonishment in our hearts and lives ought to be you know what Lord just let me focus on me not being selfish but let me just focus on the word becoming in my life I might see something might see another brother another sister I can pray for him I can want to encourage them and want to lift them up but remember you and I are just in need of the grace of God as much as anybody else the moment that we drift away from that and we do at times both saying I don't you're lying right now you do this is where the scripture said over and over paul tells them over and over in different places of the letters a man or not to think more highly of himself any off to think but think soberly compliments are wonderful but don't get intoxicated with them it's not the person that comes predestinate eternally from God it's the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal God with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born neither had done good or evil see it was the thought and then that thought become expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed well look at this Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and covenant of God Esau had no desire he had no respect for the birthright ah you could see the difference setting in if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you now watch this how you and I come he came the same way your God creates a body to come and live in and bring Redemption he always was the word is that right when he stood there at the temple that day and he has a 12 year old boy he reasoned and so forth with those Pharisees the Bible also says in the Book of Luke that this child grew in wisdom the word he was always the word now watch this Jesus was the Royal seed he lived in a human body and when the spirit called to him O Lord he didn't always have the spirit you know the spirit called to him the word manifested thought he went to Jordan and was there baptized in water upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him what is this Redemption Redemption this is the same thing for you and I always was the word but now walking up out of the water it is the word made flesh and the voice said this is my beloved son hear you him the voice did not say this has become my son Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost positioned him as that son before them all then having been filled thus the same pattern holds at Pentecost in or after he went in demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day the scripture let me just refer to this scripture here I'm trying to get to a place here brother Branham takes this in Galatians 4 and he takes this in Galatians 4 and he refers this part in the word that this is our triumphal capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost great victory over throwing doctrines and traditions in it this is our triumphal capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he brings it down into Galatians 4 verse 4 through verse 7 but in verse in verse 6 there it says and because ye are son God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father because you are not having me come on he sent for the spirit to do what raise up that which was always within you so you don't buy the breeding back we don't bear the image of a church we don't we don't bear the image we're not we're not bearing being the image of a founder they meant the Lord Jesus is come right here among us we're not bearing an unearthly image we're reflecting a heavenly image they meant God's did you know it's wonderful for God to have a life to be cleaned up that God wants his image reflected through us the Spirit of God coming it's like that where the Prophet would give that example of how that here we come into this earth he's like that talks about how that farmer took that egg story we've heard a lot but the farmer took the egg out out of the eagle's nest he did not he taken that egg it was always an eagle but he took it and he put it under a hen the head had the atmosphere then this year it hatches it comes forth but that Eagle was always an eagle why was it acting like a chicken it was only acting at the image that was set before it that's why it must be the image of Christ that is set before us not the image of a man not the image of a church the image of Christ he walked around he lived like a chicken for a long time but one day one day mama Eagle she knew that there was another egg I want you to notice how the Prophet he places it right here in this same portion I'm reading from he said mama Eagle spied that little eagle on the ground she saw him first God always knew where you were at her brother said no I was out there in the nominations but I just knew there had to be something more I didn't wait a minute well why was it why was there a longing because God was dealing with your heart God was dealing with your heart he was tearing something up you weren't content you you tried to go along with everything else but she spied that little eagle and when she spotted a little hell the prophet plays he says she swooped down with tremendous speed Oh glory breaking out of eternity she swooped down with tremendous speed and she began to scream out she began to call out and it was that voice that directed his head for way from the chickens it was something in him that he was raising something up in him he desired to be that what was it because that's what he was but the voice came knowing who he was the Weisse came and she told him he was but notice he said I'm afraid but she said just spread your wings hey man it's already there was in you believe catch on long the draught of the wind catch on the wind and be carried away from the chicken yard all he had to do was Freddie's wing and the Prophet said it just like this he said something had stirred within him all he longed and he launched out toward that all he was afraid to try but he said all of a sudden beating his wings he hurled himself into the wind I love that it wasn't something graceful it wasn't something that maybe looked pretty when he first took off but he hurled himself where towards the voice the voice was calling him beyond what he always knew something had to come to let him know who he was and the voice released within him now know something he always wondered about why my feet are different than their feet why I've got this beak like it is why I can't fit in he thought something was wrong with him it was he was in the wrong place but there was one who came of his own one who he was of and was able to place him where he needed to be walking down there with the chickens he really couldn't be recognized as an eagle but when he got up in the sky oh then he's recognized as an eagle and he begins to recognize more and more the more he soars this
