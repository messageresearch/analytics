[40:07] Heavenly Father we come before you lord
[40:10] as we stand behind this sacred desk
[40:12] we're asking Lord as we come with all
[40:16] reverence and respect that you will Lord
[40:19] come and anoint us and we would be able
[40:21] to Lord and fit right into the channel
[40:24] that you have for us tonight dear Lord
[40:26] you know in the needs of the people lord
[40:30] I pray that you Lord God will just quick
[40:33] and me Lord to your mind for that Lord I
[40:38] ask for your guidance that you would
[40:41] receive all glory and the people would
[40:43] be helped and strengthened we pray in
[40:45] Jesus name Amen
[40:49] turn your Bibles to Matthew chapter 14
[41:05] and I want to begin reading at verse 25
[41:08] and in the fourth watch of the night
[41:10] Jesus went unto them walking on the sea
[41:13] and when the disciples saw him walking
[41:16] on the sea they were troubled saying it
[41:19] is a spirit and they cried out for fear
[41:22] but straightway Jesus spake unto them
[41:25] saying be of good cheer it is I be not
[41:28] afraid and Peter answered him and said
[41:31] lord if it be thou biddest me come unto
[41:33] thee on the water and he said come and
[41:36] when Peter was come down out of the ship
[41:39] he walked on the water to go to Jesus
[41:42] but when he saw the wind boisterous he
[41:45] was afraid and beginning to sink he
[41:48] cried saying Lord saved me it
[41:50] immediately Jesus stretched forth his
[41:52] hand and caught him and said unto Him o
[41:54] thou of little faith wherefore did us
[41:57] now doubt and when they were coming to
[42:00] the ship the wind ceased he may be
[42:03] seated I would like to title this
[42:08] tonight wherefore did a stout doubt we
[42:15] when we first came to the Lord and give
[42:21] our hearts and dedicated our lives to
[42:23] him why Satan begin to fight you right
[42:28] then to try to get you to doubt the
[42:30] truth that that experience was real
[42:34] Satan had never led up but why are you
[42:38] still here where the Branham said it's
[42:42] because that you held out and he said if
[42:46] you'll do that same thing than any
[42:49] sickness that you have it will be gone
[42:53] too
[42:55] that you'll not doubt the healing touch
[42:58] and power of God I was thinking of the
[43:15] unique that in the scripture where
[43:20] Philip was was caught up and he came
[43:24] down to where the unique was the eunuch
[43:27] was reading from the scripture Scrolls
[43:31] and Philip asked him understand this
[43:35] what thou readest and he said how can i
[43:38] except some man children and so Philip
[43:44] began to expound to him the scripture
[43:47] and then as this as he began to dismount
[43:53] him descriptors they came across some
[43:57] water and the eunuch said here's some
[44:00] water what hinders what hinders us seen
[44:06] there's water what hindered me to be
[44:08] baptized and Philip said if they'll
[44:12] believe us with all that heart thou
[44:14] madest there was no room for doubt there
[44:19] and the eunuch didn't have any and I
[44:25] think of wondering how much time
[44:29] transpired from when Philip first showed
[44:31] up there to where when the eunuch said
[44:34] here's some water
[44:35] what does hinder me I would say that it
[44:39] wasn't a great expand of time so we see
[44:44] that the eunuch was elected to believe
[44:49] and Meeny let he believed and put off
[44:57] all doubt from him itself and believe
[45:02] with his whole heart and it was baptized
[45:07] Jesus said I'm the resurrection in life
[45:11] he that believeth in me though he were
[45:13] dead yet shall he live
[45:15] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[45:17] shall never die believe us now this I am
[45:24] the resurrection and life he that
[45:26] believeth in me we in our walk we
[45:34] constantly have to fight down you're not
[45:41] exempt from it just simply because
[45:43] you're the elect of God you're not
[45:47] exempt from this battle simply because
[45:49] your bride you're not exempt from this
[45:53] battle simply because of a position that
[45:55] you might hold the Satan tries to come
[46:00] and bring doubt to each and every one
[46:04] brother Branham says I want to ask you
[46:08] something if by His grace he'll come
[46:10] tonight
[46:11] and do the same thing he did in the
[46:13] Bible times when he was here on earth
[46:15] will you cast all doubts away and no
[46:19] it's the devil trying to get you to
[46:21] doubt it's not your own thinking when
[46:29] thoughts of doubt come into your mind
[46:30] that's not your own thinking that's not
[46:34] coming from your reasoning or logic that
[46:39] may be the devil trying to get you to
[46:40] reason but it's the devil that tries to
[46:45] get you to doubt not your own conscience
[46:58] the message of proving his word brother
[47:00] Ram says if thou be the Son of God see
[47:06] he's always doubted it and he tries to
[47:08] teach others to doubt it
[47:10] he taught Eve to doubt and he taught all
[47:12] them to try to doubt it he's teaching
[47:15] you to try to doubt it and you that
[47:18] sitting right here if you want me to
[47:19] call your names it's been satan's been
[47:22] trying a long time to get you to doubt
[47:24] me now I know that there is times that
[47:31] that Satan would come and tried to get
[47:34] you to doubt whether this is the truth
[47:37] or not but there's something about it
[47:42] when you first heard it that struck so
[47:47] deep within your heart that you can say
[47:52] though he's battled me I've never
[47:54] doubted him after all that God's done
[48:02] for you and your life you see the miles
[48:05] that you've come over the obstacles the
[48:11] road that you've traveled down the
[48:16] different things that you have faced in
[48:19] this life when each time we face some
[48:26] new difficulty believing Satan's right
[48:29] there to try to get us to doubt and not
[48:33] maybe to try to get us to doubt God but
[48:35] to get him get us to doubt that he's
[48:38] going to do it for us but we should be
[48:48] able to look and say wherefore did us
[48:50] down down because we after all that he
[48:56] has brought us through there's times the
[49:03] Satan will come and try to get you to
[49:05] doubt your pastor try to get you to
[49:08] doubt the ministry that you said in
[49:10] there
[49:14] where the RAM said Satan has been trying
[49:17] a long time to get you to doubt need
[49:19] don't do that he said you just believed
[49:24] this word you don't have to believe me
[49:27] but believe this
[49:29] see if I say this word it's not mine
[49:33] it's his my words different but this is
[49:37] his Jesus said believe us now believe us
[49:44] now not that I'm in the father and
[49:45] father me the words that I speak unto
[49:49] you I speak not of myself but the father
[49:53] that are well within me we can say the
[49:57] same thing we stand behind this sacred s
[50:01] in words that we speak it's not of
[50:03] ourselves but it's the words of our
[50:06] Father that's within us
[50:12] turning to first Thessalonians chapter 1
[50:28] verse two we give things to God always
[50:31] for you all making mention of you in our
[50:34] prayers remembering without ceasing your
[50:38] work of faith and labor of love and
[50:40] patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus
[50:43] Christ in the sight of God and our
[50:45] Father knowing brethren beloved your
[50:50] election of God for our gospel came not
[50:53] unto you in word only but also in power
[50:56] and in the Holy Ghost and in much
[50:59] assurance as you know what manner of men
[51:02] we were among you for your sake that's
[51:06] how that's how you know that's that's
[51:11] through how you find that doubt I told
[51:16] the folks at home I said I've been here
[51:20] long enough now there should not be a
[51:22] one of you doubt me says and you became
[51:29] followers of us and of the Lord having
[51:31] received the word in much affliction
[51:33] with the joy of the Holy Ghost you know
[51:38] who you know what manner of men labor
[51:40] among you this gospel that you have here
[51:45] it's come in not just in word but it's
[51:50] come in power and in the Holy Ghost and
[51:54] it's a life-changing word and it changes
[51:58] you forever once you said under this
[52:02] word you're never the same and every
[52:06] service you come there's it's just you
[52:09] becoming more and more like Jesus why
[52:14] because the word is transforming
[52:18] it's the power of transformation the
[52:21] spoken word of God
[52:34] I've seen people to go through things
[52:37] where they begin to say why me why am I
[52:41] going through this and they begin to
[52:45] question maybe God doesn't love me maybe
[52:51] he doesn't care why am I going through
[52:54] this why am I facing death Paul said for
[53:01] I'm persuaded that neither death nor
[53:03] life nor Angels nor principalities nor
[53:06] powers nor things present nor things to
[53:09] come nor height nor depth nor any other
[53:12] creature shall be able to separate us
[53:15] from the love of God which is in Christ
[53:17] Jesus
[53:21] there's nothing separate us from his
[53:23] love and he allows us to face things and
[53:29] go through things because we're going to
[53:32] grow by him I went through some trials
[53:40] myself that while going through them I
[53:42] didn't want to go through but when I
[53:48] come out on the other side
[53:50] I wouldn't take nothing for him because
[53:55] God always brings us out victorious and
[54:01] we always come out on the other side
[54:03] better than when we entered the tribe he
[54:12] counts us worthy of the trials it's
[54:18] character-building once the rapture
[54:23] takes place and we're caught up to meet
[54:25] him in the air there's no more character
[54:28] building so all of that happens here
[54:35] this is where we build character
[54:41] so during those character-building times
[54:44] it's not a time to doubt him no matter
[54:50] how long he goes on there's things that
[54:56] I face that I wanted them over quickly
[55:01] especially when it involved the life of
[55:04] someone else in my family I wanted it to
[55:08] be over quickly but guess what
[55:11] that's not always God's will but I can
[55:18] tell you this when it is over there will
[55:24] be victory and you'll come out better
[55:30] than you could have ever imagined this
[55:32] situation to come out I faced the trial
[55:42] went on for a year and he concerned a
[55:48] member of our family and one of the
[55:54] girls that we had adopted told some lies
[55:57] and we ended up in court and he went on
[56:03] for a year over right away it involved
[56:10] my son I wanted his name cleared I
[56:14] wanted it over right away I wanted her
[56:17] to admit she lied
[56:19] but even when she did admit she lied the
[56:22] the prosecuting attorney didn't even
[56:25] believe her belief she was lying when
[56:29] she said she was lying but you know what
[56:35] God had a provided way and God had a way
[56:41] which took us through a process that in
[56:45] the end there was professional testimony
[56:49] that he was innocent
[56:52] and that I never had imagined it would
[56:57] work that way
[56:58] I didn't think we'd have it would go
[57:04] through a wave a psychiatrist testifying
[57:07] but it did but you don't want it cleared
[57:13] his name forever they throw the case out
[57:22] God had a better way than the one how I
[57:26] thought it should have been handled I
[57:30] wanted it to be over as soon as it
[57:32] started but looking back though it took
[57:38] a year looking back I'm more than
[57:41] satisfied with the outcome partly
[57:59] I never doubted the love of God during
[58:05] but I did have to fight doubt I did have
[58:10] to fight discouragement I did have to
[58:13] fight depression and it seemed like then
[58:20] the devil didn't let up during the whole
[58:22] time but in the end he was a defeated
[58:26] foe when when I was fighting doubt the
[58:35] hardest I would get a hold of family
[58:37] members and tell him about what was
[58:39] going on and say pray for us I'd say
[58:43] request prayer for us at church I got as
[58:48] many people as I could praying for us I
[58:54] felt somebody's prayers got it reach
[58:58] through the Bible says to ask and you
[59:04] shall receive I figured it for a lot of
[59:06] people were asking if we were definitely
[59:08] going to receive I figured if there was
[59:13] a lot of people knocking the door was
[59:16] gonna be over for the Benham said in the
[59:26] message of persevering he said to his
[59:30] word is a sword the Bible said in
[59:34] Hebrews 4:12 it said the word is sharper
[59:37] than any two-edged sword it adjourns the
[59:40] thoughts that's in the heart that's what
[59:43] the word does now the only thing that
[59:46] can handle this sword is a hand and the
[59:49] only thing that can handle God's Word is
[59:50] failest if the word is a sword then
[59:54] faith holds it and grips it when people
[59:57] are dueling like two men meet with
[59:59] they're dueling that's you and the devil
[1:00:04] trying to get you to doubt now your
[1:00:09] sword that you've got
[1:00:11] it may be ever so good it's a million
[1:00:13] times better than his I'm going to tell
[1:00:16] you his is not even a sword it's a stick
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:21] but yours is a sword but if the ham that
[1:00:26] holds the sword is weak the snick can
[1:00:29] overcome it but no matter how little
[1:00:33] this hand is if it holds the Word of God
[1:00:37] with faith it can put anything down it
[1:00:44] is you don't have to say well the pastor
[1:00:48] has great faith it's not the pastor you
[1:00:51] can have great faith he said no matter
[1:00:56] how small the hand is that handles the
[1:00:59] sword it's if it handles it with faith
[1:01:02] you don't need some great position to be
[1:01:06] able to handle that sword of faith
[1:01:11] that's sort of the word to overcome
[1:01:14] doubt all you need is faith to believe
[1:01:21] when it looks like there is no way
[1:01:25] because that's where the Lord a lot of
[1:01:28] times likes it to come to it seems to
[1:01:31] where it looks like there's no way to
[1:01:33] overcome it there's no way around it no
[1:01:35] way through it no way under it to where
[1:01:41] it looks impossible because he is the
[1:01:44] god of impossibility
[1:01:46] [Applause]
[1:01:52] when it's I have often said this when we
[1:01:55] it's all said and done we could say it
[1:01:59] was nobody but the Lord that saw us
[1:02:01] through it it wasn't by our mitre our
[1:02:05] power but it was the Lord that saw us
[1:02:10] through it that's the way he wants it
[1:02:16] he's a jealous God he's not going to
[1:02:19] share credit with anyone he said see
[1:02:30] he's holding it in his right hand
[1:02:32] talking about the devil and you and your
[1:02:35] right hand and when your swords locked
[1:02:37] when you locked with the devil says is
[1:02:41] it so or not so now he's pressing to you
[1:02:46] saying say it's wrong say it's wrong you
[1:02:50] mustn't believe it but if you believe it
[1:02:53] see these swords come right straight
[1:02:56] down to the handles now if I can push
[1:02:59] his back with my handle the blade like
[1:03:03] that where I'm at I'm directly straight
[1:03:06] to his heart cuz I'm on the right side
[1:03:09] at his left and when I press with faith
[1:03:12] with the word Satan Jesus commissioned
[1:03:16] me to do this and we lock and raise up
[1:03:20] the hand of faith and say an angel met
[1:03:23] me on der it said so thus the first
[1:03:26] thing you know that throws the sword
[1:03:28] right straight in he's conquered I come
[1:03:32] to challenge you and thus saith the Lord
[1:03:34] that's the believer when he has faith to
[1:03:36] handle the work how many people know
[1:03:45] that the Bible says whatsoever things
[1:03:47] you desire when you pray believe that
[1:03:49] you receive them and you shall have
[1:03:54] whatsoever things that you desire you
[1:04:03] believe that's the word what do you
[1:04:07] desire whatsoever things you desire when
[1:04:16] you pray believe that you receive them
[1:04:18] and you shall have them what do you do
[1:04:23] you believe like it's already done
[1:04:26] you believe like you already have it
[1:04:38] commit it to the Lord
[1:04:46] an angel and the Covenant brother bream
[1:04:48] says how do you do I suppose we're
[1:04:50] strangers God Almighty who created the
[1:04:52] heavens and earth who is his his
[1:04:55] presence I stand in now knows that your
[1:04:59] life could not be hid as far as his will
[1:05:02] would be he could reveal it oh my I just
[1:05:07] wish I could get I wish I could explain
[1:05:10] what I mean
[1:05:11] don't doubt your prayer is answered lady
[1:05:15] sitting right there with the red coat
[1:05:17] that's got the high blood pressure god
[1:05:19] bless you
[1:05:20] here he's calling someone out he says
[1:05:24] don't doubt your prayer is answered this
[1:05:27] is someone that didn't make it up to
[1:05:30] have a prayer card come through the
[1:05:31] prayer line it was somebody that we
[1:05:34] would say unfortunately was not able to
[1:05:38] get into the prayer line but she was
[1:05:44] praying and God answered her prayer and
[1:05:50] he wanted her to know that he answered
[1:05:52] her prayer not when she went to the
[1:05:56] doctor and found out her blood pressure
[1:05:58] was okay he wanted her to know right
[1:06:01] then and believe it without seeing it
[1:06:08] and say said don't doubt your prayers
[1:06:11] been answered he answers prayer that's
[1:06:16] that's why he's told us to pray to him
[1:06:19] the answers prayer when I talked to the
[1:06:30] Lord I don't talk with him I guess a
[1:06:33] great big intelligence or our fathers
[1:06:36] and all this or whatever
[1:06:37] I talked to him just like I'm talking to
[1:06:41] a person I would talk to him just like
[1:06:45] that I was talking to another man in
[1:06:49] other words just make it plain and
[1:06:51] simple
[1:06:53] I expressed to him what's on my mind
[1:06:58] what I'm thinking if my thoughts need to
[1:07:01] be realigned then he'll do it I heard
[1:07:09] one time a brother from Ireland
[1:07:11] preaching and he said if the service
[1:07:14] goes too long when you get in your
[1:07:17] prayer calls that complain about it he
[1:07:23] said you'll find out it's pretty hard to
[1:07:25] complain to God while you're on your
[1:07:27] knees but I I come to the Lord I talk to
[1:07:37] him about everything that I'm facing
[1:07:39] what's going on I expressed to him what
[1:07:47] I'm filming or how it's making me feel
[1:07:51] that way I figure we can get them
[1:07:56] feelings into the line - don't doubt
[1:08:06] he's there to answer your prayer if
[1:08:11] you've got faith that he's going to
[1:08:12] answer your prayer then you can get down
[1:08:16] with all sincerity and cry out to him
[1:08:19] knowing that whatsoever things you
[1:08:21] desire when you asked believing you
[1:08:23] receive it I was thinking about the
[1:08:32] story brother Branham tells about that
[1:08:37] silver-tipped grizzly and he was with a
[1:08:42] man he called brother bud and said where
[1:08:48] they were at you could see for miles
[1:08:50] where the brem said it was there was no
[1:08:52] trees or no nothing said it was just
[1:08:54] terribly lost as far as you could see
[1:08:56] that it wouldn't bear country
[1:08:59] it was caribou country and said you
[1:09:02] could see for miles and miles
[1:09:04] and brother bud said brother gram I'm
[1:09:06] not trying to doubt you but I know this
[1:09:11] area up here and all the times I've been
[1:09:14] up here I've never once seen a Silvertip
[1:09:18] grizzly he said they're rare
[1:09:21] and he said and I'm looking around and
[1:09:24] as far as I can see the eye can see
[1:09:28] there's no grizzly bears out there
[1:09:32] brother branham said you know what his
[1:09:34] answer was
[1:09:35] he's Jehovah Jireh he's your whole word
[1:09:41] Jenna he'll provide but I'm not trying
[1:09:47] to doubt you but I don't see work and
[1:09:49] come from the brother branham never
[1:09:58] doubted it why he wasn't looking at the
[1:10:03] circumstances he wasn't looking at the
[1:10:07] scenery as far as they could see there
[1:10:13] was nothing but that was just scenery
[1:10:22] where the bud was looking for some
[1:10:24] natural way for the Silvertip to show up
[1:10:27] I believe that if God showed brother
[1:10:32] Branham a vision about it that there was
[1:10:34] some supernatural involved you know how
[1:10:42] the story goes when they finally got the
[1:10:46] bear and he shot him why the bear
[1:10:51] started charging him and brother bud
[1:10:55] said I I believe he was gonna get it but
[1:10:57] I didn't know he was gonna be in our
[1:10:59] last
[1:11:02] but it happened Jesus said to Peter were
[1:11:07] for dinner style down when I like for
[1:11:12] something that I read the Prophet said
[1:11:14] about this situation he said at least
[1:11:18] Peter got out of the boat
[1:11:25] he had enough faith none of the others
[1:11:29] said if it's used and let me come
[1:11:32] walking on the water but Peter had
[1:11:36] enough faith to say I can get out of
[1:11:38] this boat and do it if it's you but the
[1:11:44] Bible says when the waves become
[1:11:47] bolsters in other words when the scenery
[1:11:51] when he begin to take in the scenery of
[1:11:54] where he was that's when he started to
[1:11:57] doubt the things that you go through is
[1:12:01] just scenery in the journey that you're
[1:12:04] on the answer is there and it comes
[1:12:11] supernaturally he's involved that song
[1:12:19] we sing he's got it all in control and
[1:12:23] if we believe that song says in one
[1:12:27] place in every Road I walked down I
[1:12:29] believe it's in his plan we need to have
[1:12:38] enough faith to get out of the boat we
[1:12:42] need to have enough faith as to say I
[1:12:45] believe in witness when the scenery says
[1:12:50] just the opposite
[1:12:55] get out of the boat take a step of faith
[1:13:00] now I don't know the Bible doesn't say
[1:13:04] how many steps that Peter took but he
[1:13:11] walked on the water so he took enough
[1:13:17] steps to call it walking just take it if
[1:13:26] all you God has taken enough steps to
[1:13:29] call it walking then his hand will be
[1:13:33] there to pull you along pull you up he
[1:13:41] said he'd never leave us nor forsake us
[1:13:49] he's there even when we don't feel that
[1:13:54] he is he's there even when your mind is
[1:14:00] not on him don't tell me your mind is on
[1:14:06] God all the time I know other than the
[1:14:08] better we're human
[1:14:11] we've got other we got things going on
[1:14:13] things we have to do in this life but we
[1:14:21] should keep in mind and everything we're
[1:14:23] doing we should keep him in mind with
[1:14:28] everything we're doing trust him no
[1:14:33] matter what the circumstances say no
[1:14:38] matter how that it looks and times it
[1:14:41] looked like it ain't gonna work out at
[1:14:43] all but he knows how to make it work out
[1:14:49] and the thing about it is you're his
[1:14:53] child he loves you
[1:14:56] and he cares about everything that
[1:14:59] you're involved in he cares about your
[1:15:05] job he cares about your car he cares
[1:15:10] about your house
[1:15:11] everyone's readers say one time he said
[1:15:13] he cares so much he cares what you had
[1:15:16] for breakfast this morning he cares for
[1:15:26] us why would we doubt him now there
[1:15:36] should be no place in our heart for
[1:15:38] doubt when Satan comes trying to bring
[1:15:43] doubt the way brother Adam said he would
[1:15:47] then there should be something
[1:15:49] immediately say identify that's him
[1:15:53] because it's trying to bring down
[1:16:00] there's someone here tonight maybe
[1:16:02] that's had an experience with God maybe
[1:16:04] you're a new Christian I don't know I
[1:16:06] don't know everybody here don't doubt
[1:16:12] don't doubt your experience don't doubt
[1:16:16] what God has done for you because he's
[1:16:19] got a whole lot more in store
[1:16:23] [Applause]
[1:16:24] amen
[1:16:32] and everything I face as it goes on
[1:16:41] seems like sometimes trials get harder
[1:16:47] it's supposed to I think about that
[1:16:52] message brother Brennan preached as the
[1:16:53] eagle stirreth its nest and he says that
[1:16:57] mother Eagle will begin to take all the
[1:17:00] feathers and all the fluff and
[1:17:01] everything out of the nest the nest is
[1:17:05] held together with briars and thorns and
[1:17:08] breath it's not comfortable once he
[1:17:13] starts pulling out all the fluff job
[1:17:15] don't want us to become comfortable in
[1:17:17] this world now I'm not talking about
[1:17:23] your natural comfort I'm talking about
[1:17:27] spiritually and every trial we go
[1:17:35] through reminds us reminds me that I'm
[1:17:39] just traveling through here this is not
[1:17:41] my destination I'm on my way somewhere
[1:17:46] else this is just a brief stopping over
[1:17:56] I've tried to tell my children as they
[1:17:59] were growing up and as new they were in
[1:18:01] high school I tried to tell them look it
[1:18:03] may seem like it these years are taking
[1:18:05] a long time but they're gonna pass
[1:18:06] quickly now I look around and see
[1:18:12] remember when I stood in this church
[1:18:14] some 34 years ago young boy got married
[1:18:21] right up here in the front
[1:18:24] now I'm not a young boy no more and I
[1:18:28] look around and say where did all that
[1:18:30] time ago
[1:18:35] this life is a fleeting thing it goes by
[1:18:42] quick when you're young you don't feel
[1:18:43] it so much the older you get the more
[1:18:46] you feel it how quick it is you kind of
[1:18:53] like to sometimes naturallyspeaking put
[1:18:55] the brakes on a little bit what you
[1:18:58] can't people try hold on to you but you
[1:19:03] can't I tell my wife I say youth is
[1:19:10] wasted on the young they don't even know
[1:19:14] what they got with this life it's we're
[1:19:22] not gonna be here forever
[1:19:24] it's we look at it and maybe think well
[1:19:28] I've been serving God for years and I've
[1:19:30] heard for years that the rapture was
[1:19:32] coming that's only been a short fleeting
[1:19:37] time if you think about it in the aspect
[1:19:40] of which I was just talking that time is
[1:19:44] just bleeded away it was short now here
[1:19:52] we are much closer I look around and I
[1:19:57] see the things that are happening in the
[1:19:59] world news but it makes me realize how
[1:20:04] close we're getting
[1:20:06] I remember a time going through where
[1:20:13] the wall came down in Germany
[1:20:16] and you know the Soviet Union disbanded
[1:20:20] and for a while nobody was afraid of
[1:20:24] Russia and now all the sudden that's
[1:20:27] changed again the guerrilla Brenham said
[1:20:31] don't fear them because communism
[1:20:39] friends didn't come up to have any part
[1:20:41] with the bride
[1:20:50] I believe brother branham said that God
[1:20:53] allowed communism to raise up to come
[1:20:57] against Catholicism so they're not even
[1:21:04] concerned with you because it's a bride
[1:21:08] of Jesus Christ and when those times
[1:21:14] come we're gonna be gone out of here
[1:21:16] anyway
[1:21:19] but I still believe what the Prophet
[1:21:23] said he said there was a bomb in Russia
[1:21:27] with the United States name on it and I
[1:21:29] still believe that and I believe there's
[1:21:33] judgment coming to this nation and I
[1:21:36] look around the shape this nation is in
[1:21:42] y-you I look back when I was a kid I
[1:21:45] would have never imagined it being in a
[1:21:47] situation in the shape that it's in now
[1:21:54] every religion they want every religion
[1:21:58] to be respected except Christianity we
[1:22:06] won't ever religion to be accepted every
[1:22:09] religion to be considered we consider
[1:22:16] them except for Christian
[1:22:30] you own the store during the holiday
[1:22:32] times they get to where they can't say
[1:22:35] Merry Christmas no more because it might
[1:22:37] offend somebody the only ones are not
[1:22:40] worried about defending or the Christian
[1:22:48] and homosexuality is took this nation
[1:22:52] over it ain't just out then the outsides
[1:23:00] now it's in your government as well and
[1:23:07] we look around and we see laws
[1:23:09] constantly being passed for them Sodom
[1:23:18] judgments coming amen
[1:23:27] we're getting closer
[1:23:36] it's a very dangerous time we live in
[1:23:40] because we've got to earnestly contend
[1:23:43] for the faith that was once delivered to
[1:23:46] the Saints but it's also a wonderful
[1:23:49] time we're living in because of the
[1:23:52] fulfillment of his word amen
[1:23:57] I love you with all my heart I trust
[1:24:04] that I've said something tonight that's
