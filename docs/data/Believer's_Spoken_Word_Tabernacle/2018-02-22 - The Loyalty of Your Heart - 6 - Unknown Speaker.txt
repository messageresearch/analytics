down City and our uprising you know every part about our lives it's not just something but more that you are presently learning and you already knew about it before we ourselves were ever Express Lord in this time and in this hour you already knew your God how that you have provided for us as you have for every one of your children more just exactly what we have needed nor Jesus we turn our hearts Lord in our our focus to you this is evil father you know Lord what we have neither than you know just how to say it Lord and to speak to our hearts so father we would ask Lord as speaker and here together we want to just reserve and give ourselves only to you know that father to be a vessel that you would speak and hear through law of God we we want we desire that you would just work in a in a very special way in our hearts in our lives tonight boy father you know each and every need Lord and your God we just ask that you would just Lord take your word and break it to our hearts Lord father say what needs to be said Lord and father may you come tonight and just the Lord confirming your word to each of our hearts Lord by your presence Lord Lord we give ourselves to you Lord from this day Lord just setting aside from this life Lord for a few moments Lord just to be able order to be in your presence Lord and father to be able to feed from You Lord and hear from you Lauren we have need of you Lord this morning this evening rather help us now father I pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you this evening a man if we could turn to first Peter chapter 1 certainly good to be back home and just appreciate your your prayers while we were we were away there and what was certainly merciful to us within those services and I feel like that I'm still trying to get strength back we had four straight services there and in that time so you know sometimes you start realizing in your body what you're able to do and what you're not able to do but God is faithful you know I appreciate [Applause] just you know we look at everything where we're at you know in this moment you know just yesterday Reverend Billy Graham that passed on you know I just my heart when I had heard of it I know there's you know been a lot of different things that you know has been said no doubt but I always go back to the message warning before judgment in 63 and brother ban referred to Billy Graham he filled the Oral Roberts and referred to the ministry that God had given him and brother brems says they are messages of the hour one message he said of repentance he said God confirms that the other message he said of divine healing my Horrell Roberts God confirms that and he said in the message that God has given us God's confirming it by drawing the bride together so it all serves its purpose brother bran will also say it in another way and because when you think of it you think we'll Billy Graham's off the scene but remember the message itself that started within each one of those parts just as the message itself but the man himself the angel being off the scene but yet that message is going to continue to Proclamation it's going to achieve what God sent for to achieve so it's the same way with Billy Graham's message same way with Oral Roberts message as a matter of fact many times you'll find brother brand will actually call even Jack Schuler one of those angels going down there so what we're looking at is that that message is going to continue to go on and you know when you think of it there's things that sometimes we come across others who they they'll never see what God has by His grace open to us and he certainly didn't open it to us because we were smarter or better than anybody else you know as a matter of fact God made it real clear to Israel in Deuteronomy he said God did not give this to you he said because you were some sort of a special people above everybody else he said that God has done this because he made a promise to your fathers and that's why God has come in this hour God made a promise in his word and God came to fulfill that word and when you think of it you know when we we look at all of these parts that are there you think of how that you know for them tells us that this message he said it's not to go out there and hit these big nerve centers he said it's not a very saint he said it very plainly he said it's not their food and but the thing of it is the way that I've always looked at it like this and and that is that you know on my testimony your testimony the way that we live it may not draw somebody and everybody into that of where their eyes are open and knowing that they're a part of the bride but it might be our testimony that could really stir someone to say you know what I need to say we don't know the category we don't determine that that's already determined by God but only we can do is shine the light in that wonderful said it many times I'd rather you know if I have a choice I'd rather fellowship with maybe there be others that you know on the job in different places maybe we can't fellowship about the revealed truth of what God has given to us but if if all they know is a savior I'll shout with you on salvation oh yeah I'll shout with the own salvation brother branham said it many times he said my oneness here on this side and my Trinitarians over here he said the Brethren tonight let's weave our nets together and let's make a great cast you see the net itself doesn't make a salmon the salmon it's already a salmon all the net does is pull and bring in what needs to be brought in so any wonderful weekend just that that's the whole part the whole gospel is resting in him it doesn't mean that we don't do anything but we leave all the results to him let us just live our life let our light shine where we're at and commit all the results to him so I certainly think all for brother Billy Graham's life and really I really think God for that the testimony and the life that he lived so let's turn here to the word you're already there 1st Peter 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which according to his abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus from the dead to an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time may God bless you as you're being seated we'll just continue to read that portion of the word I don't want to keep you standing wherein you greatly rejoice souls are rejoicing is in our Redemption we've received the first fruits of that the down payment the deposit and that's what that's where our rejoicing is that our rejoicing is not in the circumstances and the conditions of life there's not a one of us here that doesn't like to have it at times where times where we can seemingly rest or relax or don't have things on our mind every one of us like those times but yet we we also know that within it the real true rejoicing that we have even when you think about it and coming to the house of God our rejoicing is not dependent upon really what's going on in our life think about how many times I want you to think it like think about it like this how many times that you know you can think of a situation and we don't know sitting here tonight what everybody is either going through or or or has been through or just come out of but nonetheless we know that we we all are tried and we all are tested but to be able to come in here to a place and be able to you know lay aside our thoughts and be able to enter in it to worship the Lord we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there are lives and hearts maybe you're one that tonight if it went by how you felt you would have never raised your hands if it went by how you felt you you would have never entered into the song service you you just would have never entered into worship but there's a part about it that you did not allow circumstances to keep you back and and you begin to realize the value of that as a believer you realize that there are times that it's not that we're putting on but we simply worship because he's worthy of all praise and and we're not going to allow our feelings to just dictate to us or our thoughts or we're not going to allow that we we know that God's Word is true and we know that he's faithful to his word and and he's worthy and so when we look at this he's we see that as the scripture said that wherein we greatly rejoice because we know that this life this is just a temporary passing we're just simply passing through here even like when Israel was going through the wilderness that was just temporary that was not the finality that was just temporary but here Peter would pick this up by by the unction of the Holy Spirit and say wherein you greatly rejoice though now for a season if need be ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith this is the purpose that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perishes though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ booming at whom having not seen ye love in whom though now you see him not yet believing he rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls so within just this little bit that we've read here tonight we can see that the real rejoicing and the glory where in the scripture speak of our tests and our trials is not a rejoicing in the test or the trial itself but our rejoicing comes with we know that our destiny is certain well we don't know what all that's happening we don't know everything that's gonna come out of the trial but we know that God he does not permit a trial it's not something of just a confusion but it's it's very divinely calculated and and Satan can't do anything he can't touch us unless God permits it to come and God will allow him to to come to a certain measure and as the scripture says for a season it's for a period of time but yet within it all there's an accomplishment there's an achievement there's something that God is desiring to bring out of our life so within it we are rejoicing is not of what we know about the trial because the truth be known as we're going through the tests and trials we don't know how things are gonna come out many times we don't know how it's all gonna work we don't know that but we what we're comfort is is that he's with us and when it's all said and done I'm gonna be with him that's that's that's where my rest is and that's where my rejoicing is like when a person who could say how can you be happy yet you as a person might be setting in the midst of a situation and you may not have a smile on your face but yet you have consolation within because as the scripture did say here that you are in through you are in with with heaviness though for a season that heaviness means that word means great sorrow or great sadness so you can experience that it's not talking about maybe where your face itself is just illuminate with a smile but yet in the midst of it beyond but in the depth of it there is a great consolation that I am complete assurance that God is gonna bring me through and not just bringing me through but my final destination I have a place reserved on the other side I've got a place reserved in that wonderful you know many went through many great things if we just look at it in some of the natural things when you think about how that you know there's a lot to go into of a story behind what we look at the Pilgrims and them coming here there's a lot within that of where it had to go and where they had to journey to and how many times they were actually caught and the different things that actually took place but what was it that kept them moving to that place and and to where that they were willing to risk and put their lives on the line to even journey across in a ship in that in that way what was it it was the promise of Liberty and and that that's really where it is with us in our lives what was it that would cause the different ones through the Underground Railroad and the different the slaves when they were coming through and different ones that would lead them through courageously what was it what was it that would keep them going through the the moonlit and the starlit night what is it that would keep them looking for what side of the tree had the moss on it what is it that would keep them looking for houses and lanterns in the window what was that it was a promise of freedom and this itself was a pathway that LLL NAT the end of this pathway there was Liberty so here they were they were actually they were walking free but yet there was a promise of a greater Liberty than what they knew at that time and that's the same way that it is for us as believers we're walking in Liberty now but we're walking to that place where we shall be delivered into the love divine so this is where that what is taking place in our life the tests and the trials that we go through in them you know as we we've said it that we're either in a trial we're either coming out of a trial or we're getting ready to go into one don't mean to encourage you tonight but it's true it's true this is where that Peter would pick it up again at first Peter chapter 4 verse 12 beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed you may be glad also with exceeding joy so once again our rejoicing is not tied to the circumstances it's tied to him in whom our soul has United with and to know that when it all said and done that and when his glory shall be revealed we may be glad with exceeding joy you talking about when that morning comes that moment of the rapture comes you talking about when we set there at the wedding supper of the Lamb oh you think it's hard to get people together now but then pray and say hey we're gonna pray over the food why don't y'all just stop fellowship and for a moment there's gonna be when when think about it friends the Prophet tells us here that then thirty to forty days upon the earth that scriptural you know that in the book of Acts it says they were here after his resurrection he was with them for forty days upon the earth and here they were gathered it was a group of people Abraham Sarah and all the rest of them that were apart that promise and here they were and and and there was nothing that the devil could do to think about it when we get there in that moment of time to wear that here we are saying blessed be the name of the Lord it's over it's over it's over testing is over we made it brother we made a sister thank you Oh God hallelujah and the public said he allows that time because he knows we as humans is what he said he knows we as humans would beginning our eyes on all of that but he says he allows that time that we have there that all of a sudden after we here in our time of rejoicing here he himself descends and then all attention goes to him it will be worth it all when we see Jesus not only are the trials of this life will seem so small good-o repeated on this fire the same word fire and fiery from the first part that we read the fire this to try you the fiery trial which is to try this word it means it's the burning by which metals are roasted and reduced which we were looking at that by a figure drawn from a refiners fire calamities or trials that test the character Brooke Graham tells us in Hebrews chapter four in that series he says you mustn't question anything to God now we want to get the benefits knowing we whatever the test or the trial we want to receive full benefits of it you mustn't question anything to God I'm not gonna ask for your hands tonight because every one of us have if I had time tonight to go through it in the book of Job of things and you know when you see it even where Joel himself is questioning things he's questioning all of this but to see it all but see God allows those things God doesn't we don't we don't come in to enter into this and and we're just perfect people that we're not questioning anything but you see this is counsel from our life this word that's spoken here you mustn't question anything to God this is not condemnation this is leadership we see the word that is come in this hour this is leadership glory be to God for the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of the Lord and every trial is put upon you to prove you and the Bible said they're more precious to you than gold so if God let a few light afflictions happen to you remember it's for the correction of you boy we need it we need it every son that cometh to God must first be chastened of God and tried and child trained there's no exception every son that cometh so not only do we have in the entry stages of where God is drawing a person to himself but even after the person has come to a place of a complete experience with God the chastening the trying the trials they don't stop it continues on because it's moving then to mold and shape a character now look at this here he says these afflictions are done or brought about to see what attitude you'll take that's one thing that we need our help we need help on our attitude I don't have time to deal with this either tonight but we need help with that and you just to take comfort in the scripture that there are many others who had an attitude but see God came and dealt with them you know one thing I love about it is God will not allow any worship to go to man God will absolutely reduce it so that our confidence is not in the man that our confidence is in God God could have hid all these things he could have he could have made this a book of man a book of man highlights man but the book of God highlights God it shows the weakness the infirmities of man by what god is highlighting without him we cannot do anything to see what attitude you'll take it's God on this proving ground that's all earth is is the proving grounds and where he's trying to prove you you know they have I believe it's out here in um in New Jersey they're in in naval yards that's a proving ground for them great carriers that they put out there on the seas they don't build a an aircraft carrier and then put it out there on the sea they actually submit things through great testings and trying before they ever put it out there see even this test and trial even right now that God would be moving in our life it's not just for this moment this is preparing us for the next step and next part in our life it's all things are being worked everything is working together it's temporary so here at Peter says in first Peter 5 verse 8 be sober be vigilant this sober being of a collected circumspect mine of focus be sober and be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour delivered and placed in our right mind but to remain in the midst of this time in this age this is an age you don't have to go down to the bar to get drunk this is an age where there is thoughts there is things flying everywhere the cares of this world can weigh you down everything that you see around you this is why even Paul would pick this up he would speak about the soberness of how that one is to stay sober he would speak about how that they age men their to tell the younger men this is a as a condition of our life and over our lives of where we ought to to keep ourself there's all sorts of things that are try to distract us all sorts of things all sorts of things to try to take our mind in our meditation but hound that were directed this is leadership but I've got himself to us and it says whom speaking of the devil whom resist steadfast in the faith strong firm immovable knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world so it's not about you these same afflictions no matter they might come this way they might come that way but the same afflictions are accomplished in our brethren because it's God himself working his purpose out in our lives verse 10 you see it's important that we understand that what is what is we when we're looking at this in verse 9 what does that do cast out the wrong attitude then why does it seem like I'm always going through something it's cast that out see it cast out the wrong attitude what does that the world what is the wire it's God who is God God is love perfect love cast out all fear her faith in that words so descent our attitude correctly notice notice I says in verse 10 here but the God of all Grace who has called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus by the anointed word of our day we have been caught and as Paul said that's the gospel of your salvation it is gone knowing we were identified with in Christ in that word and that word has been ministered and you and I there's a corresponding part within us than all of a sudden it's like you know they have these lost dogs and things that are lost and all of a sudden you find this I seen one where there was a lady here she found one after 10 10 years you say what does that have to do with anything you know they chipped these these dogs now you can have a chip put in them and what they found was they got to looking at this dog she said this looks like a dog I had 10 years ago when I you know twelve years old he looks just like in characteristics and he does the same kind of stuff so what they did they took him to the vet and they scanned it and sure enough there was the chip they had put in him he belonged to them and that's why the Prophet said that gene found you that gene was already in you when the light of the hour scanned across your lap it said identified you were claimed by the light of the hour you always belong to him as the prophet said you always were saved but you had to come to the reality of it there had to be a light that could scan and bring forth what was already laying there that gene found sure so unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after that you have suffered a while after that's a big word in it after after the flood Noah seen the rainbow after the Lions been here the pillar of light after the Hebrew children went into the furnace after after after you've suffered a while how long's a while season how long's a season a moment how long's a moment he has it don't try to apply the day one day with the Lord as a thousand years don't try to fly that bad maybe that time will work right here but it suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen settling to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen sir every trial I believe it we can be really honest tonight if our our perspective and these things of God has the Lord helping us that every trial we come out stronger than when we went into it now let me clarify that your flesh and your spirit has been reduced you are weakened but the inside man has been made stronger and that's the real you this is why after the Lord Jesus in Luke 4 Luke 4 verse 13 when the devil had ended all the temptation he departed from him for a season the very next verse says and Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit unto Galilee but there's a key important point that happened in there between verse 13 and verse 14 the angels came and ministered unto Him who were they ministering to was it that they needed to minister to the soul the soul was solid they had to provide ministry because the the the outward the temple was so weakened the spirits was so weakened but yet the ministering of angels was to do what strengthen him look with the Elijah Elijah himself after the great test there Elijah goes into the cave and I just steal Elijah but there's a circumstance that's happened within there and the Spirit of God moves to do what call him out to receive nourishment we need those times of nourishment after we've passed through a tester trial we need that times of nourishment they talk about times that when you you know you pass through different things some of you you know with medical or whatever more there were things and I can remember when I was playing football they had to stand on the scale in the morning they had a stand in the scale when we came in and from afternoon or by the afternoon and when we had to a daze and then we had to stand on the scale before we went out then we had to stand on the scale after that practice four times in one day I had to stand on the scale I'm not gonna tell you what it said but four times I had to stand on it the whole purpose of that was is to see was I taking in enough water was I am retaining enough and and then you know they would talk about you know replenishing certain nutrients in your body make sure you're getting salt because you're sweating things out like this so let's talk to you about those things why and you're out there exerting yourself there's things that you're losing you're not even realizing and in the midst of it as we go through a test we go through a trial sometimes after you come through a test or trial you look back and it seems like that you were pardon me for saying like this here might seem like you were Superman you were getting strength from you to know where he was getting strength from but it was from the Lord the Lord was helping you but after the test or trial and then it begins to pull back you begin to realize it's like the Prophet when he was under discernment after it began to pull back here it is the shell of a man that was suffering may God help us I believe that with all my heart may God help us may God help us to have the wisdom and the balance within those things as well Lord help me Lord restore me Lord refresh me Lord refresh me and you know he he loves to do that he loves to do that so here the Prophet he puts it like this I love this statement in time-tested memorials he's talking about the man who tested every part that went into that bridge down there I believe in Australia second paragraph brother he said that's what they're saying today he's talking about the bridge will never stand up he said that's what they say today this year Holy Ghost religion you're talking about it will be long that tree will burn down but it don't burn down the fire only waters it the fire only waters it hey you know some of you know right now most of us probably do that you know they talk about all these things with forest fires and whatever more but you know that there are many trees and things that they're designed that's the only way that the seed can be released that's the only way certain things can be released there's actually certain resin that's on certain leaves that that resin is a flammable substance and it is it is set there so that the fire itself can come along and it releases and brings growth there's times where a fire will come right through you know I know there's a even a big thing right now they do it and been doing it for years what they call prescribed fires where they'll get and they'll they'll burn an area up because it begins to be a lot of evasive species and a lot of things that are growing there and things get all tangled up you know and especially it works out good for deer hunters and things like that you burn up a lot of stuff and you get to a place to where you're hunting in the woods and there's no and there's no undergrowth going on and so what happens is the leaves falling down the leaves are good good organic matter makes it good for the soil but they keep building up building up building up building up so a good fire coming through there what it will do it'll actually burn up those leaves bringing them to ash which actually then mix with the soil will add to the nutrients that are there then that fire will come through at times and the fire will actually take care of certain saplings and certain things and sometimes the fire will come through and it'll be a reverse it'll actually bypass the saplings and get to the older things that are there that need to be done away with oh I'm glad that God's directing this fire I'm glad that God knows what needs to be done away with and Samuel he knows what needs to remain he knows what needs to be released and he says I'm just gonna water you a fire boy so God has his great big picture out and he's not filling it with water he's filling it with fire but don't worry remember as we looked at that fire within Moses there it did not consume the bush but the bush burned you see this fire only consumes the consumable it only allows to remain what is that God's desiring to bring forth the test and the trial is not against us but it's there many times it will release things in our life virtues that are being held there that they cannot be brought forth in any other manner the fire only waters it it only gives us new hold it only strengthens it every trial in testing is that every time a wind hits a tree and shoves it back and forth and back and forth it only loosens the roots so it can go deeper and get a better hole every time sickness strikes your home every time trials strikes your home every time the neighbors say something bad about you it's only shaking you loosening you up now if the neighbors say something bad about you and you go say something about the neighbors this ain't loosening like the wind trying to move you the wind can't move you but then again maybe we're more spiritual and you don't say it to their face you just post it on Facebook a little somebody you see we're talking in times and this right here that that it still comes down to discerning what's the spirit what's the part behind it it really comes down to a part like this gods wanting to reduce us when we feel like we got to tell our side you know what that's called pride if I tell my know God has a way so that it will all come out you don't you don't we don't have to frustrate it we don't have to frustrate you understand what I'm saying we don't have to frustrate it because what it does it just simply it puts us in a place and we're really not receiving what we ought to be receiving in that tester trying we commit ourselves to him is that right that's where to have we have that resolve within our hearts it's only shaking you loosening you up so you can get down and get a better hold on the eternal rock of God's unmovable word I'm not going to ask any of you to raise your head cuz everybody's been guilty where you're tempted about telling your side or your point or this or that we all have and there been times we've given in and I'll say Amen for all of us but you see this is part of this is God teaching us and training us thank God that there's a that life within us it can smite us it can convict us you know you know we want to live that sensitive but that's how God does it he sends those trials to test you to prove you to shake you up and to give you a new Oh hallelujah we're thankful for those new holds the Bible says concerning our age if they come and buy of me gold that's tried in the fire goes on to say buying of me white raiment that the shame of thy nakedness does not appear taking I said unto our eyes that we might see it might be applied to our hearts but you see this buying of gold money can't buy this gold the church system owns a lot of gold but this gold you can't buy this gold the only way to buy this gold is by submission it requires yielding and surrendering this gold is the very shaping and molding of our character and as we hear it over and over it's true that character it's not a gift the Holy Ghost is the free gift of God salvation is a gift of God they're right the character is not a gift it's a victory it's a victory Alleluia Gloria I think it just finds him so perfectly as but the John started out with that the first message he was speaking and it brought it right down to where we are all in a place and it kept moving within these these services it comes to a plate we're always yielding well bream says in question answers I believe it's 1954 and he talks about how he says you can study to such a place to where you're just so perplexed he said but you have to be in that place where you're yielded just as you was when God first got ahold of your life that yielding never stops you're continuing to yield to him and he what is he doing as we yield to him he steps in he's taking control it's him doing the work we don't need to be frustrated with trying to make it happen his word transforms us our confidence is in him and he is the word amen though I may not see it don't may not feel it but I know that that word will not return back to him boy amen that word is accomplishing you say no Sam I don't see it but look what it's like it's miss breath its life into you - were even that warrant you have you have such a hold and moves in you have an expectancy even though you don't see and you don't feel but it's just like it's like somebody bring new life into you it's like your life has been recharged and you find I think you know what I'm ready to keep going what is it that's doing it Jesus said my words they are spirit and life this gold of God is the prophet puts it in the lady of C an age is a christ-like character produced in the fiery furnace of affliction this is the right kind of gold now I want to just look here just for a few moments watch how Paul brings this in second Corinthians 4:17 Paul brings a comparison here between our light of our our light affliction and the glory that's received for our light affliction whilst not making light of anybody situation but he's trying to help us see that no matter what the complexity or how great the affliction is its light its light see what this is a view I relied affliction which is but for a moment a season a while how long is that he knows worketh for us these afflictions they they are not your master they are your servants they are working to bring out of us what God sees is there worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen to help me Lord but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal we can all recognize that the tests and trials that maybe you had last month or you had last year whatever more they're gone right here you are standing on the other side of them victorious and you didn't do a thing but yet just submit and surrender to him he brought you through he gave you grace and then he turns around and rewards you for standing faithful for the Grace and strength he gave you he didn't turn it around and begin to brag on himself but he holds you up and he says my what a trophy but what is the trophy about it is a life that is just in the midst of it submitted to him for the things which are not are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal Paul has brought that comparison the things are there light but compared to what the exceeding and eternal weight so what from the light fliction the great thing that comes forth there's an eternal exceeding weight and glory there is character that's being produced and being molded in my life the bread sama can't I get this from a seminar no can I get this just from just coming here and just hearing the word no the word gives you direction the word gives you leadership the word is giving us Direction within us on and even in our approach but you see why the word is set before us so then in the midst oh I'm getting to something right here the word is set before us God already knows what is out there before us he already knows the test or trial that's coming our way so God is setting his word before us there's a focus there's a focus that's before us these services these messages all of these things our God has dealt with us through all the collection of of the different ministers it's wrong God wanting us to focus not when we come into the trial we just say Oh wonder what's going on I don't understand what's going on I don't it's to give us a focus to do what God did not supply and give to us a word that he's already not provided a focus you see when God brought him out of Egypt he already provided a focus his work is already this is a direction we're coming through the wilderness here we're going to we're going to the promised land God's already given a direction there's a focus that we have it's more precious than gold what's how David says this in Psalms 119 verse 71 it is good for me that I have been afflicted that I might learn that statutes it's good for me that I've been afflicted that I might learn that statutes I don't have them on the screen but I'm gonna refer to a few few men few men of God I really many times I enjoy Charles Spurgeon and different ones let me just read you a few other things Charles Spurgeon said in like this he says I have for my part Oh more I think to the anvil and to the hammer to the fire and to the file than to anything else I bless the Lord for his correctives of his Providence by which if he has blessed me on one hand with sweets he has blessed me on the other hand with bitters it's a looking at it Luther said it like this he says I never knew the meaning of God's Word until I came into affliction I have always found it one of my best school masters so in the midst of trial we don't abandon the word stay and hold tight to the word thy word Oh Lord is a lamp unto my feet it is a lie unto my pathway it's not talking about that we go into a study and maybe we have all the times like we have at other time but this this is a principle we want god I want to see my desire is what you have determined from my life I want to give myself to it see friends we can't take the attitude sometimes the attitude that has taken with that of and it's wrong where the thought line gets into predestination well God's just gonna do it anyway and don't matter what goes on that's not true that's not true predestination is responding to his presence God already already knows all things he already knows but within it predestination does not take away from our yielding it was like I've given the example many times where you know somebody trying to put this coat on me if I just stand here like this you're not gonna get that coat on me it's there come on but I'm gonna put the coat on you and I just stand here eventually you're gonna tell me and say Kenya can you give me your hand here can you raise your arm why am i raising Marv that's surrender there's somebody here that can help me I get the first Armand then I give my hand to his hand and he'll guide my hand in the other sleeve so it's in his presence it's recognizing his presence and submitting to it that's what brings to light predestination cuz predestination is not God pushing us through a pipe and pulling us out on the other side blessed is he that I did push and pull know blessed is he that over come well he shall inherit all things this is the same thing the life of the Lord Jesus God did not bypass this with the example son with our Redeemer the Bible is clear he learned obedience by the things which he suffered is that right so we we want to be clear that it is and always a given when we made the statement that we come out stronger we only come out stronger we only come out better when truly we are looking to him and focusing on him and God is so gracious I like teachers like this in school that believe in mastery learning that means if I got a test on a C on the test they say you take it again you got a B on the test you didn't you take it again you want the same questions but mastery learning is there is no excuse for you not learning you're going to learn you know what that did that did not put an anxious pressure on you you went into that it didn't mean didn't study I mean no doubt there was some people I probably with the school with it didn't but what it puts you at it puts you at a rest and know if I don't pass this I'm gonna redo it I know none of us say no I don't want this trial again Lord please I don't want this test again none of us new friends because what is it it's our humanity that's being reduced it's our weakness that's being exposed during the midst of it it is so we asked God Lord give me grace just give me grace give me grace Lord to to go through give me grace to stand in the midst of and when I feel like everything's caving in give me grace Lord that I can raise my hand give me grace Lord that I can say I love you Lord give me grace Lord that I will withstand an atmosphere of affecting my home in a way but yet in the midst of it Lord it would be an atmosphere given by your grace so this is where in our lives were being perfected in with this this is where James would deal with of how that my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let this is the key let patience have her perfect now if they're gonna perform a surgery on me I need anesthesia I'm a baby and they're gonna pull it pull a tooth or doing cavity numb it up good I don't care my tongue slapping around I'm here any my job numb it good I don't want to feel nothing but God knows just how much anesthesia all we have to do is ask him for grace lord I need grace and he knows just how much grace to provide for that trial to where that we sit there in the chair we're not zombies come on somebody we're setting there what are we doing it's his Grace's we're looking to him lord I need your grace oh no what I need your strength what's happening we're letting patients have her perfect work Lord strengthen me in this moment lord help me Lord God when I need your help Lord seems like everything is cleaning around remember fall into divers temptations this word fall means to be encompassed about when to be encompassed means you don't see any gape any hole any exit door lord help me you promised in your work you'd make a way of escape you promised or you never leave me nor forsake me what do you know you're putting his word back there I'm standing on your word that you gave me Lord I need grace right now what are you doing in the midst of the time letting patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing in an amazing God wants to see us grow he wants to see us grow and mature to that to match that that character of the picture that he has in his family album this time down here on earth is the growth it's a development time and God's desire within the letting patience he can't do this woman well the joy I can't do it for you you can't do it for me the thing I can do when I see you going through something or something just press on my heart maybe the Lord will wake me up in the middle of the night or put it on your heart and somehow I can say God strengthened my brother don't be with my sister I don't know what's going on but maybe they're going through a great trial in the midst of time what's it doing as a body we're feeling that and what are we doing we're praying God give strength give grace to my brother give grace to my sister why because our desire is to see one another come to maturity what burden what gave you that burden what gave me that burden he did he did that we would be perfect and entire entire not just part but entire wanting nothing God sees to it that every virtue that is sealed within us that it comes out in expression those virtues as the Prophet would tell us concerning our Mountain he said there birthed within us he would tell us don't she said you start off without a real born-again experience because without a born-again experience he said you're just adding peacock feathers to a black bird I say that to you that you're not under that we might understand this is that those virtues within themselves they are already sealed within our life but it takes these measures to release the expression and for those to grow we need him he will have achievement that's our confidence because the work that he started he finishes I don't know what I'm gonna have to go through I don't know things that I have to further suffer but the one thing I can do is look back on things and say Lord you have brought me through and the one thing that it has taught me and I'll be very honest with you it's taught me every test in every trial is my greater need so then when that when tests your trials come and those things come I'm not standing before you as all of a sudden I've got a Rolodex and perfect not that it's still a dying because our humanity does not like to be exposed it doesn't like it but God says when you're weak when you're weak I'm strong so our weaknesses are exposed but God is working all things after the counsel of his own Lord I just need grace let's just stop here tonight he's working trying of our faith worketh patience work it's working even now he's working Lord just give me great give me the strength Lord Jesus to trust him to know that he knows he's guiding it it's not that Satan is telling him what to do but remember as we looked at this in three kinds of believers we've been looking at that it's only God permitting to Satan to do what he can do Satan cannot even try to do anything else he only is given certain permissions but God permits it in order to bring out the expression in our lives and tonight maybe tonight you're going through something or you've been in the midst of something just remember this he's here to administer to you he's here to give you strength he's here to tell you hey there's cakes on the fire he's here to minister to you they ain't sent the Angels the Angels here to minister to us the strength that we have needed maybe you feel like you've lost something along the way maybe in a trial or a test but you know what he's here to minister and give you the strength because the real true reality of it is is that the inside man has been renewed when we're looking at it in the right way and we've just been submitting it to the Lord we might look like look friends in the midst of the world and the way the eyes of the world look it looks like weakness and everything else and that's true that is true but you cuz you see way the way the world has been so conditioned is the world has been conditioned to everything superheroes to a real hero always comes out on top that's fantasy as the Prophet tells us however god choose to commit a commit us to a trial to me you may commit you to death you may commit but you know what in all its great its efficient you believe that tonight but you see the way the world perceives all of this but God looks at it and says here's somebody that circumstances that's going on in their life I just I wonder how it is in the midst of a time of a service maybe a day as a day is going by and God can just step back and say what is it maybe they're going through the hardest test the hardest trial maybe things are bombard in their mind and everything else but yet they stand in the midst of it and and say Lord you're worthy Lord I need your grace I need your strength and here he is what a refreshment in this hour when this hour when hard things come up this hour this age it's quickly deserting but to see a life that stands and says Lord I'm depending on you because when you took me to be your bride you took the veil off my life and you put it upon your shoulder and you told me I'll take care of you all that you have need of don't you love him tonight let's pray Lord Jesus we order so thankful as you give us direction in your word you give us the leadership by your Holy Spirit Lord we every one of us across this building and even those that would stream of our climate leave I believe Lord that every one of our hearts as believers we want to see Lord more of a reflection of you in us Lord we realize that that through this as we see that the afflictions that come our way the tests the trials like David could say it was good that I was afflicted that I might learn that statutes Lord it's something that we as we go through things in our life we can look every one of us in your weave there's been testimonies all around us here been testimonies where you've moved on the scene healing those that were sick but then it comes to our own personal life that we might also have a testimony and I know he's the Lord that healeth all my diseases but I know that he's my provider Lord as your prophet put it so clearly you allow and permit these trials to come away than you might demonstrate your love to us you want to make it known to us as Peter said whom having not seen we love Lord how that you make known your love to us through the many various manifold temptations Lord you make yourself Oh Lord Jesus we want to say to my lord thank you for your grace thank you for sufficient grace for God there's nothing else Lord we can only say that His grace has brought me safe this far it'll safely carry me through through many dangers toils and snares I have already come tis grace that brought me safe thus far grace will carry me safely Oh Lord Jesus tonight we want to just want to give ourselves to you help us forgive us lord when we've had the wrong attitude forgive us Lord when we've questioned and we've lined Lord to see sometimes those things can come and then in a moment it's turned from our lives right right in a moment Lord it's turned we're thankful that there's a greater there's a greater one on the inside nor Jesus you are our expectation you are the Blessed hope Lord you we have been through the abundant mercy begotten unto a lively hope Lord Oh God we're we're looking to you Lord we know that Lord Jesus when it's all said and done it's true the toils of this life will seem nothing but right now Lord we do want to say thank you thank you for every test in every trial we ask the Lord that you would help us help us Lord to look to you and we are as it were Lord in the fiery furnace of affliction when we were on Lord maybe as we could say the operating table Lord or setting in the chair may we Lord look to you that we Lord God would let patience have her perfect word Lord God help us Lord God patience have her not his patience have her perfect work you chose to identify it in the feminine Lord God showing Lord that it must be a submission into your hands help us lord help us Lord to submit help us to surrender Lord father it's by your presence Lord it's how that you move by your word you don't command it you draw it out of our lives you draw it out of our lives Lord like you spoke to us on those services that latch it's on the inside of the door you draw it you don't demand open up this door no you you draw it out of a soul you bring us to that place father tonight we want to say thank
