[40:24] his children and um I know that he came
[40:27] to meet many needs and I'm just grateful
[40:29] just to have been a witness to that amen
[40:32] when he comes and what he does Amen
[40:35] because he's still he's still the same
[40:38] amen let's just read just a couple
[40:40] scriptures and we're just going to let
[40:41] you have your seats then
[40:43] in verse 1
[40:45] I beseech you therefore Brethren by the
[40:48] mercies of God
[40:50] that ye present your bodies give me just
[40:53] a little bit more on these monitors up
[40:54] here
[40:55] that ye present your bodies a Living
[40:58] Sacrifice holy
[41:01] acceptable unto God which is your
[41:05] reasonable service
[41:07] be not conformed to this world
[41:11] but be it transformed by the renewing of
[41:16] your mind
[41:17] that ye may prove what is that good
[41:20] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[41:25] I want you to notice this here again be
[41:27] not conformed to this world
[41:31] but be it transformed by the renewing of
[41:35] your mind
[41:36] for what purpose that ye may prove
[41:41] what is that good acceptable and perfect
[41:44] will of God
[41:46] to prove is to declare it to show it for
[41:50] that's great so to see that God has
[41:53] ordained that his children in this hour
[41:57] will be The Proving Grounds of his word
[42:00] his children
[42:02] are those of whom he will declare
[42:06] himself to be alive and well
[42:11] you see we his children are the you that
[42:15] was spoken of in Malachi 4 and verse 5.
[42:20] not who we try to fit into the you but
[42:24] are you in that verse
[42:27] are you with me now
[42:29] it's behold I send unto you it's not us
[42:32] placing ourselves there it's God that is
[42:36] placing us there
[42:37] is that right
[42:39] yeah it's no person pushed us or pulled
[42:41] us to where we are right now
[42:43] that's why many times we can even get in
[42:47] our own self we get frustrated about
[42:49] things and coming back to like brother
[42:51] Brown was asked a question in the
[42:53] message
[42:54] um uh he's in that little house meeting
[42:56] in the message thy house down in Tifton
[42:58] and brother Branham if you believe the
[43:00] coming of the Lord is so right upon us
[43:02] how in the world can you go fishing
[43:04] and brother Brahm says I learned a long
[43:07] time ago
[43:08] there's only so many names that's on
[43:11] that book
[43:13] and God will not lose one
[43:19] God will not lose one
[43:21] amen
[43:23] so be you transformed by the renewing of
[43:26] your mind that ye may prove what is that
[43:29] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[43:32] God may God bless you bless the reading
[43:34] of the word as you're being seated
[43:36] just just invite him
[43:38] you'll just come and just speak to our
[43:40] hearts this morning
[43:42] we've been speaking on a thought on the
[43:45] power of the word
[43:48] really the basis of that really where a
[43:52] lot as we think about is receiving the
[43:56] word
[43:57] into ourselves into our lives
[44:00] and to know that as brother Brandon
[44:03] would say in different places in perfect
[44:05] faith and say it in Christ is the
[44:07] mystery and it's a statement that as a
[44:11] message believer that no doubt would be
[44:13] common to us and he would say as you
[44:15] receive the word you become the word
[44:19] so we we recognize that within that
[44:23] thought there is a power within the word
[44:26] of God to transform
[44:29] there's the power within the word to
[44:31] bring about just what God has said
[44:34] and remember God interprets his word by
[44:39] bringing it to past
[44:41] good many there's a lot of things when
[44:43] the word is spoken that then as it's
[44:45] late here on printed page that there can
[44:48] be many interpretations rise such as it
[44:51] was Behold a virgin shall conceive many
[44:54] interpretations arose upon that many
[44:56] interpretations arose upon the Messiah
[44:59] coming but that didn't stop God from
[45:02] fulfilling his word
[45:04] God came and fulfilled his word and God
[45:07] wasn't worried one bit of oh my goodness
[45:10] with all this false that's gone out my
[45:13] my my my true seed they're not going to
[45:15] catch this no the only thing that his
[45:18] seed need is for that light to come upon
[45:21] them
[45:21] when he reveals himself it breaks all
[45:25] Superstition it breaks all false
[45:29] interpretations
[45:30] his light and that's why his light it's
[45:35] his life it's him so when we look at
[45:38] this of transformed it is to change into
[45:42] another form or to transform or
[45:45] transfigure it's something that's been
[45:48] changed something that's changed from
[45:51] one thing to another the same word is
[45:54] what it speaks of what took place on
[45:57] Mount in Matthew 17 verse 1.
[46:01] and after six days can I have a little
[46:03] bit more in these monitors please and
[46:06] after six days Jesus taketh Peter James
[46:09] and John his brother as the
[46:12] yes Peter didn't know what was going on
[46:14] but he knew something Supernatural is
[46:16] taking place it's good for us to be here
[46:20] and here's where Peter says if thou wilt
[46:23] let us make here three Tabernacles now I
[46:27] want to just say this to you that that
[46:30] in itself the let us is what has caused
[46:33] many confusions and even confusion in
[46:36] our own life
[46:38] God does not need anyone to make him a
[46:42] tabernacle
[46:44] when he said in the scriptures let them
[46:47] make me a tabernacle what he was calling
[46:49] for his hearts that would surrender what
[46:52] he had already put in their possession
[46:54] to surrender
[46:55] he had the pattern
