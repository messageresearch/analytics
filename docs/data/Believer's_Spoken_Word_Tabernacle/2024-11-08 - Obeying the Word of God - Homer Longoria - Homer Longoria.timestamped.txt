[46:17] just say we're just so thankful once
[46:18] again to have brother Homer here with us

[46:25] a real good dear friend and I believe
[46:27] you'll be blessed and we certainly want
[46:29] to we want to hear from the Lord and God
[46:32] has such a unique diversity of gifts in
[46:34] the body and I'm I'm glad for every gift
[46:37] every gift is so necessary you know we
[46:40] might have certain preferences and
[46:43] things like that and gifts and so forth
[46:45] but the real reality if we want a full
[46:46] balanced diet it takes all of the fful
[46:50] ministry you know if you and that's God
[46:53] knows what we would have need of you
[46:55] know when Paul I was we were
[46:57] fellowshipping in the car myself and the
[46:59] boys the other day and I said you look
[47:01] at how that Paul when he came to make
[47:04] known in the son of man Ministry and
[47:07] where that would be placed in the body
[47:09] of Jesus Christ through every individual
[47:11] as well as through a multifaceted fful
[47:13] Ministry how God would Veil himself in
[47:16] the midst of his people and would speak
[47:19] through the veils that are redeemed to
[47:21] me that I just begin to meditate on
[47:24] those things of how that God takes
[47:27] redeemed vessels and works through
[47:29] redeemed vessels I mean to me that's
[47:31] just overwhelming that thought when I
[47:33] think of it but it just shows you the
[47:35] power that is in the blood of the lamb
[47:39] and when the Holy Spirit has come my
[47:41] there's no greater cleaning agent
[47:43] there's no greater greater resolve for
[47:46] any heart than the blood of the Lamb
[47:48] amen so we just want to just pull on the
[47:51] gift of God we all have needs here
[47:53] tonight you have requests on your heart

[48:34] he was where God has brought him through
[48:37] so many things and you know it just it

[53:40] been through everything right you want
[53:42] to know a little bit about me I was born
[53:45] a Roman
[53:46] Catholic I went through the Protestants
[53:49] I went to the United
[53:51] Pentecost I went through the oin move in
[53:53] the 50 6 early 60s been a I got
[53:58] saved
[54:00] amen and I got saved I come to the
[54:02] message
[54:04] 1969 my folks my wife's folks was
[54:06] following Brother bam for since
[54:08] 62 and uh they come out with Brother
[54:11] Richard Blair out of Louisiana and so uh
[54:14] uh you know so we followed uh in 1969
[54:19] February the 16th God called me into it
[54:21] and so uh I've been here ever since I
[54:24] didn't come in on the bridge that's
[54:26] right I didn't come in on a cloud
[54:28] preacher that's right I come in on the
[54:33] word I don't care if it would have been
[54:35] 30 men fall off the bridge I didn't
[54:38] care no preacher call
[54:41] me no preacher call me I come in under
[54:46] tapes amen but I believe in something
[54:48] Bes I push
[54:50] play come on amen amen so I came because
[54:54] God called me I did not want to
[54:58] come I didn't want to come I want to
[55:02] stay out there where I was
[55:03] at but I didn't want to God said you got
[55:05] to
[55:07] come amen amen so when God called me I
[55:10] came and you say amen amen see the thing
[55:13] about it is amen somebody's got somebody
[55:15] to lean on I have nobody to lean on but
[55:19] the word of God
[55:20] itself amen and so the thing about it is
[55:23] what we seeing now amen to me amen there
[55:26] had to be in a restoration of the word
[55:29] not the gifts not all of this other
[55:32] thank God for all of that we went
[55:33] through that we believe that but thank
[55:36] God that there come a restoration of the
[55:39] word we were amen we were in darkness
[55:42] church and it took this message of
[55:44] Malachi 4 to bring us back to the word
[55:48] not just bring us back to the Bible if
[55:51] we just come back to the Bible when amen
[55:53] David Jeremiah's got us whipped
[55:56] amen he knows amen every letter
[55:58] everything but tonight church he
[56:00] couldn't come back to the word because
[56:03] the Bible says he ever learnning never
[56:04] come the knowledge of the truth amen so
[56:07] they look right at it and they don't
[56:08] ever see it can you say Amen because the
[56:11] Bible says he hid from the eyes of the
[56:13] wise and prudent and it revealed to
[56:15] somebody like
[56:17] Homer can you say Amen see so the thing
[56:21] about it is is amen somebody said wow
[56:23] brother R was wrong here that's okay
[56:26] right but what he brought he brought a
[56:28] restoration of the
[56:31] word look church amen amen when God
[56:34] Called Paul amen he was to Open the Eyes
[56:38] of the
[56:39] Gentile he met the pillar fire you say
[56:42] Amen so what he did was he came and if

[2:14:08] amen
[2:14:11] amen
[2:14:13] hallelujah you know that's the that's
[2:14:15] the whole reality of God of this message
[2:14:19] coming to us amen is to restore our
[2:14:22] faith to a real Bible Faith amen you
[2:14:26] know when Jude said contend earnestly
[2:14:28] for the faith that was once delivered to
[2:14:31] the
[2:14:32] Saints and that's that's the whole
[2:14:34] principle that's the whole basis of our
[2:14:37] walk with God is
[2:14:39] Faith you know the things like as the
[2:14:43] Lord was is going through that tonight
[2:14:45] with
[2:14:45] us when God would send the message in
[2:14:48] this hour and we seen the Messiah s
[2:14:52] amenu that was to lift our faith in the
[2:14:56] word of God Amen just heard brother Bram
[2:14:59] say it here today you know he'll say it
[2:15:00] in many places he says he talks about
[2:15:03] the visions that has been witnessed and
[2:15:05] he was talking about this he said many
[2:15:07] people come and want to see that Silver
[2:15:10] Tip Grizzly that he killed and that
[2:15:12] Caribou he said they even want to
[2:15:14] measure it he said but you know he said
[2:15:17] and that was a vision he said there's
[2:15:19] been many other Visions he said but but
[2:15:21] you know what he said if there is any
[2:15:22] Vision that's a contrary to the word we
[2:15:25] take the word above the
[2:15:29] vision and he said it points us to this
[2:15:31] right here that if God did that then
[2:15:34] what about the word that he gave to you
[2:15:35] and
[2:15:36] I that that that was the whole point to
[2:15:39] bring it down into that place that you
[2:15:42] know even when brother Braham was
[2:15:44] walking through Memphis brother Braham
[2:15:46] never told us in any place of the
[2:15:48] message that he felt in anything
[2:15:52] Supernatural but he was told to go here
[2:15:55] to go there to turn here he said he had
[2:15:58] some postcards to mail yeah but it was
[2:16:00] simply following yes the holy spirit
[2:16:03] amen amen and we know we're following
[2:16:05] the spirit of Truth he'll always lead us
[2:16:07] into the word and just like was said
[2:16:10] tonight and you know it's it's not just
[2:16:12] a statement it's God speaking to us in
[2:16:15] such a way our confidence is in the word
[2:16:18] whether you feel it or whether you don't
[2:16:20] God God made a promise and I'll tell you
[2:16:22] the prophet said it like this he said
[2:16:24] God will bankrupt heaven to keep one
[2:16:28] promise he'll bankrupt it to keep onek
[2:16:31] Hallelujah said when you say to this
[2:16:33] mountain he said there'll be one grain
[2:16:35] of sand turned loose he said that's a
[2:16:37] testimony that the rest of the
[2:16:38] Mountain's on the way he said you got a
[2:16:41] condition in your body he said cells
[2:16:43] that are bad he said you say at that
[2:16:46] time the word of God over that in your
[2:16:48] life he said and soon as you take that
[2:16:51] promise and say it over your life he
[2:16:52] said those good selves begin to arm
[2:16:55] themselves and begin to go to battle
[2:16:57] against those
[2:16:59] Invaders why because it's not our voice
[2:17:02] that's speaking it's it's him when we've
[2:17:05] taken his word into our heart and it
[2:17:07] comes across our lips it's no longer us
[2:17:09] speaking it's God speaking and I I tell
[2:17:12] you that was powerful that that
[2:17:13] testimony about about the eagle you're
[2:17:15] talking about Bobby Thompson and what he
[2:17:18] mentioned with that that was powerful
[2:17:19] right life bu building up on the eagle
[2:17:22] whatever kindes of things just fly into
[2:17:25] the
[2:17:26] Sun and and you see that's the reality
[2:17:29] with everything in our life it no matter
[2:17:30] you know sometimes a a person get to
[2:17:32] look at I've got this habit I've got
[2:17:34] this or I've tried to get rid don't
[2:17:36] listen brother Bram says if you just
[2:17:38] give yourself to feed on this word this
[2:17:41] word will give you the strength to Fly
[2:17:43] Above the things of the world that's
[2:17:45] where our power is that's where a
[2:17:46] transforming power that's where our
[2:17:48] source is at amen so brother says when
[2:17:51] the scripture said believe on thine
[2:17:52] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy
[2:17:54] and thy house shall be saved he said
[2:17:55] we're so busy telling people what not to
[2:17:58] do he said just tell them what they need
[2:17:59] to do he said as soon as you do that he
[2:18:02] said there's a faith that comes that'll
[2:18:05] lift you and you begin to watch the
[2:18:08] habits and begin to watch the things
[2:18:10] going from your life you know what I
[2:18:12] love about my experience with God it's
[2:18:16] mine that's what I like about it it's
[2:18:18] mine it it ain't nothing that nobody's
[2:18:20] School into me it isn't anything that I
[2:18:22] sat down and somebody convinced me but
[2:18:25] it's something that I can witness the
[2:18:28] resurrection and the supernatural my own
[2:18:30] life I know what I
[2:18:31] was and I know like what was being said
[2:18:34] tonight it was God that stepped in and
[2:18:36] overrode the stubborn will of Samuel
[2:18:39] Browning it it wasn't Samuel it was God
[2:18:42] who stepped
[2:18:43] in and then the things of this world
[2:18:45] just continue to fall away and you know
[2:18:48] what he's still working on me amen
[2:18:51] he's still molding
[2:18:53] me amen what a I tell you friends the
[2:18:56] whole thing with this message is to
[2:18:58] bring
[2:18:59] rest the real message of the hour the
[2:19:02] gospel is about rest it's a finished
[2:19:04] work it's just about entering in to a
