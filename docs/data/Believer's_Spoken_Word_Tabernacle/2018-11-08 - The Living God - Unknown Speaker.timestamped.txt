[34:58] chapter three your love him amen
[35:04] appreciate the Lord the services this
[35:06] past weekend am I so good
[35:18] verse one read just a few verses and
[35:23] then we'll let you have your seats now
[35:27] Moses kept the flock of Jethro his
[35:30] father in the father-in-law the priest
[35:32] of Midian and he led the flock to the
[35:36] backside of the desert and came to the
[35:38] mountain of God even to Horeb and the
[35:41] angel of the Lord appeared unto Him in a
[35:43] flame of fire out of the midst of a bush
[35:46] and he looked and behold the bush burned
[35:51] with fire and the bush was not consumed
[35:56] that's a miracle that's a miracle how
[36:00] could this bush be on fire and yet it's
[36:04] not consumed and Moses said watch the
[36:09] response here and Moses said I will now
[36:13] turn aside and see this great sight why
[36:17] the bush is not burnt God knows how to
[36:22] get his people's attention maybe
[36:25] somebody else we could have walked by
[36:27] there and said wow there must be some
[36:29] reflection on this mountain and just
[36:30] kept going but it was that appointed
[36:34] time God moved on the scene and it held
[36:38] an attraction for Moses and when the
[36:43] Lord saw that he turned aside to see God
[36:49] called unto him out of the midst of the
[36:52] bush and said Moses Moses and he said
[36:58] here are mine and he said draw not nigh
[37:03] either put off thy shoes from off thy
[37:07] feet for the place whereon thou standest
[37:10] is holy ground
[37:12] moreover he said I am the God of thy
[37:15] father the God of Abraham the god of
[37:19] Isaac and the God of Jacob and Moses hid
[37:23] his face where he was afraid to look
[37:27] upon God
[37:29] and the Lord said I have surely seen the
[37:32] affliction of my people which are in
[37:36] Egypt and have heard their crime by
[37:40] reason of their taskmasters I know their
[37:46] sorrows I wonder let me pause for a
[37:49] moment I wonder how they might have felt
[37:54] under the taskmasters and then the
[37:57] oppression that was growing greater and
[38:00] greater I wonder if the devil would have
[38:03] been trying to whisper to them God
[38:06] forgot about you God forgot about his
[38:10] promise because you know that old
[38:12] slewfoot you know the devil he's always
[38:15] there to try to speak words of doubt but
[38:22] God hasn't forgot you
[38:27] he hasn't forgot his promise glory be to
[38:34] God and I am come down to deliver them
[38:37] out of the hand of the Egyptians and to
[38:41] bring them up out of the land unto a
[38:44] good land and a large unto a land
[38:47] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[38:49] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[38:52] and they amma rights and the perizzites
[38:54] and the Hivites and the Jebusites now
[38:58] therefore behold the cry of the children
[39:00] of Israel is come unto me and I have
[39:02] also seen the oppression wherewith the
[39:05] Egyptians oppress them come now
[39:08] therefore and I will send thee unto
[39:11] Pharaoh that thou may us bring forth my
[39:15] people the children of Israel out of
[39:18] Egypt may God bless you bless his word
[39:22] as you're being seated wants you to
[39:27] notice there in the scripture I have
[39:30] come down
[39:34] but I'm sending thee notice here is God
[39:40] coming in the form of a man in verse 11
[39:46] the Bible goes on to say Moses said unto
[39:48] God Who am I that I should go unto
[39:52] Pharaoh and that I should bring forth
[39:53] the children of Israel out of Egypt you
[39:57] know it's something about it that Moses
[40:00] we're were very much aware that Moses
[40:03] had heard of the promise of a deliverer
[40:07] he had actually been told of the
[40:09] peculiarity of his birth and Moses we
[40:13] know and understand that in his own
[40:15] strength he had tried to act upon what
[40:17] he knew to be God's Word but yet it
[40:21] would not be by Moses strength
[40:23] Moses would simply be a vessel that the
[40:27] Living God would come and manifest
[40:30] himself through so you see God works in
[40:34] such a way to bring us into places as he
[40:37] did Moses to where Moses in his self
[40:41] sees his weakness is insufficient sees
[40:44] his inability and by doing that you know
[40:48] we would look at that and we would think
[40:49] well that would that would be the wrong
[40:51] way to go about it but not no it's not
[40:54] it's a way that God has to move among
[40:56] our lives that we can see that elv our
[41:00] own selves we can do nothing and here is
[41:04] Moses standing here with a great
[41:06] question Who am I what has been spoken
[41:09] to be done Who am I you know this very
[41:13] statement right here is actually
[41:15] inviting God to make his plan known to
[41:20] Moses you see it's one of those things
[41:22] if you think about it when you look at
[41:25] magnets and all of these things and
[41:27] magnets and how there's certain metals
[41:28] that are actually magnetized there's
[41:30] properties that will actually go to a
[41:33] magnet you also realize that there's
[41:35] certain times that you can take certain
[41:37] metals and things like this even magnets
[41:39] and you can bang them around in such a
[41:42] way to where that the strength of the
[41:44] pool is not as great as it ought to be
[41:47] but
[41:48] get all of the little ions or whatever
[41:49] you want to call them or steal there all
[41:51] the north and south they're still there
[41:53] but what has to happen is there has to
[41:56] be a magnet that is completely lined up
[41:59] in full strength for it to move across
[42:02] that material and begin to line the
[42:05] parts in there so that the strength
[42:07] itself can actually move and be
[42:10] magnetized it was already here within
[42:12] Moses life but now notice how will God
[42:15] make himself known to Moses Moses has
[42:19] already known the written word he's
[42:21] already read it he memorized it he knows
[42:23] it but that in itself is not the way
[42:26] that God has chosen to make himself
[42:28] known though he is the word but God
[42:31] desires to make himself known because
[42:36] when he is made known then our
[42:39] confidence in what he has already said
[42:42] rises to where it needs to be that he
[42:46] might be able to fulfill his word
[42:49] through you and I now think about it if
[42:52] it wasn't listen as Moses is an electron
[42:55] of God why did God with when we look at
[42:58] it how that God come on the scene why
[43:01] wasn't it just enough for Moses to have
[43:03] the word because the word by itself
[43:06] apart from the Spirit of God God who
[43:10] gave the word was powerless but when God
[43:13] came there who gave that word then you
[43:16] have the God who spoke it that's there
[43:19] to vindicate it manifest it and bring it
[43:21] to pass then you have where Moses is not
[43:24] resting upon letters and upon words but
[43:27] he's resting in the very person of the
[43:31] Lord God and to see how that God would
[43:34] move on the scene and Moses invites him
[43:37] in at this time let's go on and look at
[43:39] this in verse 12 he said certainly I
[43:42] will be with thee and this shall be a
[43:45] token unto thee that I have sent thee
[43:48] when thou has brought forth the people
[43:50] out of Egypt you shall serve God upon
[43:52] this mountain and Moses said unto God
[43:55] behold when I come unto the children of
[43:58] Israel and I saying to them the god of
[44:01] your
[44:01] fathers have sent me unto you and they
[44:04] shall say to me what is his name what
[44:08] shall I say unto them how does Moses
[44:12] know this because believers want to know
[44:16] his name
[44:17] believers want to know his name because
[44:19] his name is who he is it's a
[44:22] characteristic it's the very
[44:24] manifestation of the same God and so
[44:28] here it is Moses what's this here is
[44:31] Moses under living right here in the
[44:33] presence of God
[44:34] he's standing all right O's about at the
[44:42] instant moot
[44:43] that's right Moses himself standing in
[44:51] the presence of God he's standing in a
[44:53] place where God is making himself known
[44:56] as the Living God
[44:58] this is not something that Moses is
[45:00] going to have to rely back on his mama
[45:02] or somebody else but he is meeting God
[45:06] personally and that's God's Way that's
[45:09] God's order it's still the same right
[45:12] here tonight in every generation God
[45:14] meets you and me personally so when we
[45:19] see it how that God has moved in this
[45:22] manner Moses as the presence of God
[45:24] moving upon Moses life Moses asks what
[45:27] shall I tell them
[45:29] thy name is now you know watch how God
[45:32] goes on to say this and God said unto
[45:34] Moses I am that I am and he said thus
[45:39] shalt thou say unto the children of
[45:41] Israel I am hath sent me unto you and
[45:45] God said moreover unto Moses thus shalt
[45:48] thou say unto the children of Israel the
[45:51] Lord God of your father's the God of
[45:54] Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of
[45:57] Jacob hath sent me unto you and this is
[46:01] my name forever and this is my memorial
[46:03] unto all generations he was always the I
[46:08] am
[46:09] he is still the I am tonight he's not
[46:13] the I was it's nothing I will be he is
[46:16] the I am the I am is he that was it's he
[46:20] that is and he that shall come Dory back
[46:24] same table that knows where you're at
[46:26] tonight he knows where you been and he
[46:28] knows what your destiny is that is the
[46:31] Living God the manifestation of God's
[46:35] name so ma what's what he says and he'll
[46:39] go and gather the elders of Israel
[46:43] together and say unto them the Lord God
[46:48] of your father's the God of Abraham of
[46:50] Isaac and of Jacob appeared unto me
[46:53] saying I surely visited you and seen one
[46:55] is done for you seen what has done to
[46:58] you and Egypt and I have said I will
[47:01] bring you up out of the affliction of
[47:03] Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites
[47:06] Hittites amirite parasites Hivites and
[47:09] Jebusites onto a land flowing with milk
[47:12] and honey and they shall hearken to thy
[47:16] voice thou shalt come now and the elders
[47:19] of Israel under the king of Egypt and ye
[47:21] shall say unto Him the Lord God of the
[47:24] Hebrews hath met with us and now let us
[47:26] go we beseech thee three days journey
[47:28] into the wilderness that we may
[47:30] sacrifice to the Lord our God and I am
[47:33] sure that the king of Egypt will not let
[47:36] you go
[47:37] no not by a mighty hand are you with me
[47:43] God has given him the word he said you
[47:47] shall unite there Israel together you
[47:50] and the elders and go stand in the
[47:52] presence of Pharaoh and tell him let us
[47:56] go we want to go three days journey and
[47:59] God turns turns around and he lets Moses
[48:02] know you will not be let go no not by a
[48:05] mighty hand it could have been a mighty
[48:07] army that could have been Moses could
[48:09] have been heading a mighty army men that
[48:12] were
[48:12] ever so trained but he wasn't heading a
[48:15] my team our army Moses himself was only
[48:19] serving in the great army of God and
[48:22] this situation he's letting Moses know
[48:25] and the people that this situation by
[48:29] Pharaoh saying you can't leave here you
[48:32] can't get over that you can't be free of
[48:34] this God is letting it be no this is an
[48:38] opportunity for me to manifest my glory
[48:42] to my people in the midst of Egypt oma
[48:48] and I will stretch out my hand that's
[48:51] the mighty hand right there and smite
[48:54] Egypt with all my wonders which I will
[48:57] do in the midst thereof and after that
[48:59] he will let you go so you see signs and
[49:04] wonders and miracles are necessary it's
[49:10] a way that God has of making himself
[49:13] known that he is the Living God because
[49:16] if it's just the word and the word is
[49:19] here and it's not manifest you could
[49:21] doubt that but when the God whom gave
[49:24] this word is made manifest then it's no
[49:27] longer word it's become light and then
[49:31] you have faith in the God who gave the
[49:34] word that's what matters friends it
[49:36] isn't that you understand every word and
[49:38] that's it's important that you recognize
[49:41] his presence and that it is he that is
[49:45] speaking unto you and that you obey from
[49:49] your heart what he is saying dude oh ma
[49:54] what's how Moses goes on here Moses
[49:57] himself you know you see the Spirit of
[50:00] Christ moving within Moses life Moses
[50:04] has never said at this point oh that's
[50:06] enough that's enough we won't need that
[50:09] Lord we won't need miracles signs and
[50:12] wonders because your people they know
[50:14] the quotes I mean they know the
[50:15] paragraphs they know chapters Lord
[50:17] they've memorized them in Sunday school
[50:19] they can quote them that ain't what they
[50:21] needed
[50:22] that ain't what they needed they didn't
[50:25] need memorization they knew the promise
[50:28] what they needed was the God who made
[50:31] the promise to step in to the promise
[50:35] and the promise become flesh now watch
[50:39] this this is where here Moses is asking
[50:42] and Moses answered and said unto Him but
[50:46] behold they will not believe me nor
[50:50] Horkan know hearken unto my voice for
[50:53] they will say the LORD hath not appeared
[50:57] unto thee and the Lord said unto him
[51:01] what is that in thine hand he said a rod
[51:06] he can he said cast it on the ground and
[51:09] he cast it on the ground and it became a
[51:12] serpent and Moses fled from before it
[51:16] here was a Rob that he had been getting
[51:19] back been caring he had been hurting
[51:22] sheep on the backside of the desert but
[51:25] notice here Moses himself is seeing this
[51:28] bush that is on fire and yet it's not
[51:30] consumed now the same God the voice has
[51:34] spoke out of that bush and it has called
[51:37] him by name it's called him into a place
[51:40] of humility
[51:41] it's called him into a place that he
[51:43] recognizes that I alone am not able to
[51:46] do this it's called him to a place that
[51:48] he would ask that God would manifest his
[51:51] name it's called to a place that he
[51:53] would actually ask God Lord that there
[51:56] be signs that would back up what I'm
[52:00] saying and that the Lord hath appeared
[52:03] unto me do you realize that the people
[52:06] of God would have had a right to
[52:08] question if there have been no signs are
[52:12] you with me better had the right to
[52:14] question who are you
[52:15] o the Lord's appeared unto you what if
[52:19] the Lord's appeared unto you and made
[52:21] himself known unto you then we ought to
[52:23] be able to see him come on friends if
[52:27] he's alive and well we ought to be able
[52:29] to see him you see people are not
[52:32] wanting just a Bible people
[52:34] are not warning just a quote book they
[52:37] are not warning just quotes and tapes
[52:39] they want to see the Living God
[52:42] on display glory be to God and this is
[52:48] what Moses was asking for I ask you who
[52:52] was this that was asking for this it was
[52:55] that predestinated ordained elected part
[52:58] that seed that was down on the inside
[53:00] that was longing like David said that
[53:04] deep call it to the deep at the noise of
[53:06] that water spot Oh
[53:08] David said I long to see God manifest
[53:11] himself as he has in the sanctuary I
[53:14] long to see that Living God on display
[53:18] you see that's the hearts of the
[53:20] believers I want to see him who you see
[53:26] that rod notice that rod itself before
[53:30] Moses could ever see miracles he had to
[53:34] obey he asked him to look at what do you
[53:38] got in your hand Lord this is just some
[53:41] rod this is just a rod
[53:43] he said cast it down you see God's not
[53:47] interested in you supplying something
[53:49] but God will take what you already have
[53:53] if it's just submitted to him
[53:56] the glory of God can move in and it will
[54:00] raise something that is dead to life
[54:03] could it be the God it will be something
[54:06] that is living that you can put your
[54:08] hand on it'll be something that is alive
[54:11] that then becomes a judgment rock of God
[54:14] in your hand you realize what this is it
[54:17] is the deity of Jesus Christ in the name
[54:20] of Jesus Christ the deity is the life
[54:23] it's the characteristic it's the real
[54:26] manifestation that backs up that this
[54:29] indeed is the Lord Jesus Christ because
[54:32] it's the same life
[54:33] the same works the same signs who and
[54:38] the Lord said unto Moses put forth thine
[54:41] hand and take it by the tail and he put
[54:44] forth his hand and caught it and it
[54:46] became a rod in
[54:47] and that what that they may believe I
[54:55] thought they are believers they are but
[55:00] you see believers want to see God
[55:04] believers love to see God once it's just
[55:08] not enough for him they love God they
[55:13] love to see him and by the way if you
[55:16] and I are a part of him as Moses was and
[55:19] as the covenant children were a part of
[55:22] him what's going to bring that God part
[55:24] out of your life
[55:25] it'll take the Living God it takes a
[55:28] living God coming on the scene to bring
[55:31] out that part that he's already sown in
[55:33] our life come on now that they may
[55:37] believe that the Lord God of our fathers
[55:39] the God of Abraham the god of Isaac the
[55:42] God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee now
[55:47] I hope you listen now God is not in any
[55:50] way interjecting here and saying wow
[55:53] they just sort of believe the word come
[55:58] on somebody they don't need signs and
[56:01] wonders no more they just thought to
[56:03] believe the word nope mister
[56:05] opportunities for God to make himself
[56:07] known that he's still the same come on
[56:11] friends we don't want DNA reports from
[56:13] paper we want that same manifestation of
[56:17] the same DNA in this world to make
[56:20] himself real and alive in our midst Oh
[56:25] glory be to God watch this and the Lord
[56:28] said furthermore unto him putting out on
[56:31] hand into my bosom he put his hand into
[56:33] his bosom and when he took it out behold
[56:36] his hand was leprous as snow he put his
[56:39] hand into the bosom again and he put it
[56:42] he put it in there again and plucked it
[56:44] out of his bosom and behold it was
[56:46] turned again as his other flesh glory
[56:49] see the heart of man the conscience of
[56:52] man sinned but how that God would come
[56:56] on the scene and God Himself moving on
[56:59] the scene who an actual
[57:01] bring about a change in a person's life
[57:04] you see this is a great miracle glory be
[57:08] to God and it came to pass if they will
[57:11] not believe thee neither hearken to the
[57:13] voice of the first sign but they will
[57:15] believe the voice of the latter sign and
[57:18] it shall come to pass if they will not
[57:20] believe also these two signs
[57:23] neither harken unto thy voice well it
[57:28] didn't say write them off it said that
[57:30] thou shall take of the water of the
[57:32] river and poured upon the dry land and
[57:35] the water which they'll take us out of
[57:37] the river shall become blood upon the
[57:40] dry land now I'm gonna tell you it
[57:43] really don't matter if you was a
[57:44] believer in the first pool or you became
[57:47] a believer at the manifestation of the
[57:48] second pool the pools themselves work
[57:51] together come on somebody or a believer
[57:55] under the third pool you are not a
[57:56] believer under the third pool and reject
[57:58] the first and second cuz the first and
[58:00] second is still in manifestation glory
[58:05] be to God
[58:06] notices here God's interested in getting
[58:09] his people to believe this is God's
[58:13] interest and notice there is a voice
[58:16] there is a message but remember in order
[58:19] to get the people's attention God just
[58:22] does not send a message but God Himself
[58:25] comes down and he manifests himself by
[58:29] signs miracles and wonders now listen to
[58:32] me channy's and jam berries were right
[58:34] there they could produce some of the
[58:37] same miracles some of the same signs
[58:39] some of the same wonders but the
[58:41] difference with Janice and cameras and
[58:43] Moses they did not have the power to
[58:46] take away those plagues that were
[58:49] brought let me tell you something all
[58:51] the miracles and everything it can be
[58:54] reproduced but let me tell you something
[58:56] the voice of God standing there and
[58:58] signs and wonders are done what does
[59:01] that voice do it points you and I to the
[59:03] promise of God
[59:04] it does not leave us in a comfort zone
[59:06] of
[59:08] and unbelief but it points us to the
[59:10] living promise of the Living God it
[59:13] doesn't leave us in bondage it doesn't
[59:16] leave us in Egypt it just doesn't get us
[59:18] to the wilderness it packs us all the
[59:21] way across the Jordan I love this
[59:27] brother diamond said he here when God
[59:30] Moses had said Lord show me your glory
[59:33] and then put this one up there he said
[59:35] show me your glory and I'll go hi
[59:38] brother BAM says I like to see a little
[59:41] that's the kind of glory don't you
[59:43] always says show me your glory Lord now
[59:46] what is your glory Lord Moses had the
[59:50] stick in his hand hand into the bosom
[59:52] pulled it out leprosy puts it back and
[59:54] it's changed now notice blue grama says
[59:58] he's seen God's glory
[1:00:01] what is God's glory then miracles signs
[1:00:06] wonders and divine healing show me your
[1:00:11] glory Lord glory when he was ready to
[1:00:15] deliver his people
[1:00:16] Oh Baha here came Moses and the Holy
[1:00:19] Ghost showing signs wonders and divine
[1:00:22] healing there in the midst of Egypt -
[1:00:24] God's covenant people listen to me those
[1:00:27] signs and wonders one for Egypt those
[1:00:31] signs and wonders were for God's
[1:00:33] covenant people they would have to
[1:00:35] believe let me tell you something think
[1:00:37] about it over and over how many times
[1:00:39] you heard the Prophet saying will this
[1:00:41] help you to believe you know God is
[1:00:44] interested in helping you to believe
[1:00:46] when you look at yourself and say I
[1:00:48] don't feel like I've got enough faith
[1:00:49] you cast that thought out right now
[1:00:51] because you might have just a little bit
[1:00:53] of faith but right here in this building
[1:00:55] tonight there are believers whose faith
[1:00:57] might be a little greater and we're
[1:00:59] sitting here United as a body of
[1:01:01] believers tonight and the faith of God
[1:01:04] can begin to move right through this
[1:01:06] assembly and a charge of God can move as
[1:01:09] you're entertaining the promises of God
[1:01:11] in your life you can walk out of here
[1:01:13] not a divine miracle of God you can walk
[1:01:16] out of here tonight a sign in a wonder
[1:01:19] of God's manifestation by his healing
[1:01:22] power by its delivering power tonight
[1:01:24] you can walk out of here that same way
[1:01:27] oh my you say how do you know that
[1:01:32] because I am a witness of it you can't
[1:01:35] preach nothing you're not a witness of
[1:01:36] you can't tell nobody you're not a
[1:01:38] witness something you're not a witness
[1:01:40] of you yourself must be a partaker first
[1:01:43] but if somebody's already been there
[1:01:46] I've been there I was once a sinner I
[1:01:49] was once lost but I've been found a God
[1:01:52] who called me a God who cleanse me Saint
[1:01:55] to find me and filled me with the Holy
[1:01:57] Ghost and placed me here in the land I'm
[1:02:00] telling you it was not by my works it
[1:02:02] was not by my effort it was by the
[1:02:04] choosing of God and God came down and
[1:02:07] began to manifest himself to me and let
[1:02:10] me know it's more than quotes boy it's
[1:02:12] more than just reciting verses boy
[1:02:15] you've got to know me in a personal way
[1:02:18] you've got to know the God who can
[1:02:20] deliver you from sin but God who can
[1:02:23] claims you have ever filthy habit that
[1:02:25] God who can set your feet in the land of
[1:02:28] promise I'll tell you what the Lord this
[1:02:35] lesson this last verse I read God will
[1:02:37] do anything he'll do everything to help
[1:02:41] his people believe I wonder how many
[1:02:46] times we need to read a row people off
[1:02:48] because they didn't believe well I
[1:02:51] talked to them maybe that's all you did
[1:02:53] was talk to him maybe you should have
[1:02:55] kept your mouth silent and just lived a
[1:02:57] life a little more come on somebody it's
[1:03:00] always better to live a sermon than
[1:03:02] preach one it's better to show them a
[1:03:05] life that has actually been changed it's
[1:03:07] better to be a miracle that they
[1:03:10] themselves can witness and see you know
[1:03:13] a miracle
[1:03:14] you can't explain a miracle a miracle is
[1:03:16] a phenomenal a super natural happening a
[1:03:20] paradox
[1:03:22] if you can explain your new birth I
[1:03:25] doubt it I said if you can explain your
[1:03:28] new birth I doubt it
[1:03:31] our prayer let me just to challenge us
[1:03:34] and put this down among us as an
[1:03:36] assembly our prayer should be for the
[1:03:39] Lord God to make himself so real among
[1:03:42] us I just read to you a statement right
[1:03:45] here where the Prophet said I like to
[1:03:47] see his glory don't you oh ma it ought
[1:03:52] to be to where when those doors when
[1:03:54] people walk in those doors conviction
[1:03:57] sets in by the presence of God and ain't
[1:04:00] going to happen by just looseness it
[1:04:02] ain't gonna happen in a happenstance it
[1:04:04] isn't gonna happen would say what if
[1:04:06] their intellect of God
[1:04:07] it'll happen no there's got to be some
[1:04:09] people who are intentional some people
[1:04:11] who's met God face-to-face some people
[1:04:14] who love to seek God show up who loves
[1:04:17] to see God save souls change souls
[1:04:20] fill them with the Holy Ghost it's gotta
[1:04:22] be people who love to see his healing
[1:04:24] power it's gotta be people who long when
[1:04:27] they come to the house of God they're
[1:04:29] not interested if a quote is finished
[1:04:31] right or if this verse is finished just
[1:04:33] right they're interested in the Lord God
[1:04:36] showing up and making himself real
[1:04:39] because your faith is not to stand in
[1:04:42] the in passing words of man's wisdom
[1:04:44] your faith is to be established in the
[1:04:47] power of God that ought to be his
[1:04:53] presence upon our hearts such conviction
[1:04:55] when people would walk through these
[1:04:57] doors I wonder when they walk through
[1:05:00] those doors do they hear a lot of
[1:05:01] nonsense in that vestibule do they hear
[1:05:03] a lot of political trash do they hear a
[1:05:05] lot of mumbo-jumbo that ought not be
[1:05:07] going on out there I'm telling you you
[1:05:09] set out there and you talk and
[1:05:10] everything else you are not ready for
[1:05:12] the house of God you are not ready for
[1:05:14] the promises of God y'all gonna get
[1:05:15] quiet on me you get quiet on me I'm
[1:05:17] gonna preach harder it's absolutely the
[1:05:19] truth my question is why are we coming
[1:05:22] to the house of God are we coming to see
[1:05:25] one another or are we coming to have a
[1:05:27] meeting with God do we
[1:05:29] God to show up or is it just about I'm
[1:05:31] here Lord I want him to show up
[1:05:34] I want the Living God to come on the
[1:05:37] scene take some preparation for a person
[1:05:47] to say we believe the message we don't
[1:05:50] need signs and wonders
[1:05:52] you're a make believer you're an
[1:05:55] unbeliever because you don't believe
[1:05:57] he's still performed signs and wonders I
[1:06:00] don't think you know this same God if
[1:06:03] you don't think that's necessary
[1:06:05] what about your children what about
[1:06:07] Souls and lives that are here that don't
[1:06:09] know him they might hear the message but
[1:06:11] friends they people need to meet the
[1:06:14] Living God face to face my children they
[1:06:17] hear the voice of a prophet they hear it
[1:06:19] talked about we talk of these things
[1:06:21] with them but I cannot be very
[1:06:23] experienced for them they've gotta meet
[1:06:26] that same Living God on the same sacred
[1:06:29] sands that changes their life and kills
[1:06:32] that old nature and raise this up a real
[1:06:35] son of God on the inside oh we don't
[1:06:40] need signs and wonders anymore you
[1:06:41] unbeliever we need signs and wonders
[1:06:45] because everywhere chief is there is
[1:06:47] signs and wonders don't you dare be a
[1:06:51] wait wet blanket we need God we need the
[1:06:55] Living God right here one let me read to
[1:06:58] you what the Prophet said in perfect
[1:07:00] faith he says oh my faith is based on
[1:07:03] forgiveness as we said in the morning
[1:07:05] trying to get the church into the place
[1:07:08] to where we could really see apostolic
[1:07:11] times moving among us that's what we all
[1:07:17] hunger and it's just laying right at the
[1:07:25] door we see it but we want to see more
[1:07:30] of it we wanted such a flow that it'll
[1:07:36] be a help to us us
[1:07:40] flow out to others Oh Lord this means
[1:07:45] it's not about me it's about him and his
[1:07:48] body it's about him making himself no
[1:07:55] it's about being in love with him and
[1:07:58] wanting to see him show up brother M
[1:08:00] says remember Jesus he never used his
[1:08:03] power for himself he used it for others
[1:08:06] that's what it was sent for so you see
[1:08:11] when you don't pray you're living for
[1:08:12] yourself when you don't submit yourself
[1:08:16] to God you're living for yourself Oh
[1:08:18] everything I've got such a busy week
[1:08:20] that's about you but what about a
[1:08:23] sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] maybe there's a need right here that
[1:08:28] would come into service by the Samuels
[1:08:30] Thursday not you see a different God on
[1:08:31] Thursday night it's the power any less
[1:08:33] on Thursday night I don't think so I
[1:08:36] said it just as much for Thursday nights
[1:08:38] as I do for Sunday's now in that study
[1:08:41] of time how much time is it given oh I
[1:08:42] don't know hours weeks and things that
[1:08:45] can go all together for a preparation
[1:08:47] for one service I do not make a
[1:08:49] difference when it's a Thursday night or
[1:08:51] a Sunday night because you know what he
[1:08:53] doesn't make a difference so my
[1:08:54] expectation it's no different if it's
[1:08:57] Thursday night or it's Sunday night if
[1:08:59] it's important for me to be in the house
[1:09:01] of God on Sunday it's important to me to
[1:09:04] be in the house of God on Thursday glory
[1:09:08] be to God think about Elijah on Mount
[1:09:10] Carmel how did it turn the people's
[1:09:13] hearts was a just word or was it the
[1:09:17] Living God who gave a Living Word and
[1:09:20] came down and vindicated it and turned
[1:09:23] the people's hearts see it was God
[1:09:25] making himself known
[1:09:26] what about Rahab here she is in a land a
[1:09:30] land in a heathen country heathen
[1:09:32] nations right there
[1:09:34] dwelling in that city but she heard his
[1:09:37] fame she heard about the Living God now
[1:09:42] I want you to notice what she said she
[1:09:44] said we know that God Himself he of
[1:09:48] heaven is also God in earth she said
[1:09:52] well we have heard what I have heard
[1:09:53] right here is that it's just not
[1:09:55] something of word only but I have heard
[1:09:58] that God is among human I have heard
[1:10:02] that God has swift Kings he has
[1:10:05] overthrown battles he has opened
[1:10:07] obstacles and opposition's along the way
[1:10:10] that's what I have heard about him you
[1:10:13] know what she was hearing she was
[1:10:14] hearing the name of the Living cloth the
[1:10:17] I am and arose something up within her
[1:10:21] to say I want to know that I am Jesus
[1:10:26] himself standing here he said if I do
[1:10:28] not the works of my father believe me
[1:10:30] not but if I do though you believe me
[1:10:33] not believe the works that you may know
[1:10:35] and believe that the father is in me and
[1:10:37] I in him he that believeth on me the
[1:10:40] works that I do shall he do also and
[1:10:43] greater works than these shall he do
[1:10:45] because I go unto my father John 6 57 as
[1:10:49] the living father has sent me and I
[1:10:52] lived by the father so he that eateth me
[1:10:55] even he shall live by me in John 20:21
[1:10:58] jesus now at the resurrection he says
[1:11:01] peace be unto you to the disciples as my
[1:11:04] father hath sent me even so send I you
[1:11:08] the father who sent him went in him this
[1:11:15] ought to be the desire now I'm gonna
[1:11:18] tell you right now he don't do good it's
[1:11:20] not enough just to have the tapes and
[1:11:22] the books and your home and the Bible
[1:11:24] you need to live in God well I believe
[1:11:29] that God I believe the Living God was
[1:11:32] manifest in the prophets ministry that
[1:11:34] was only a type of the Living God
[1:11:35] wanting to manifest himself in your life
[1:11:39] don't you dare put God back there as an
[1:11:42] idol it's a living God
[1:11:44] hey man our young people and people have
[1:11:48] become here to this assembly they don't
[1:11:50] need words they need to meet the Living
[1:11:53] God face to face we tell you something
[1:11:58] friends people can be so schooled within
[1:12:00] this message they can debate it that can
[1:12:02] tell you all the doctrines but they
[1:12:04] don't know one thing about
[1:12:05] living God they know about the doctrines
[1:12:09] can talk about him can set things all
[1:12:11] right but yet they don't know him in a
[1:12:13] personal way it's not something to wear
[1:12:16] the love of God has actually moved into
[1:12:18] their life where they're living by the
[1:12:21] presence of God notice here in the
[1:12:28] scriptures this is God's Way you know he
[1:12:30] dude God does something he don't ever
[1:12:32] stop the Bible says in mark 16 verse 19
[1:12:37] after the Lord had spoken unto them he
[1:12:41] was received up into heaven and sat on
[1:12:44] the right hand of God here's the
[1:12:46] Ascension after his resurrection
[1:12:48] here's his ascension now he's been
[1:12:51] received he's ascended up on high and he
[1:12:54] sins back the promise of the Father and
[1:12:58] they went forth and preached everywhere
[1:13:03] the Lord working with them and
[1:13:07] confirming the word with signs following
[1:13:16] acts 4:32 and the multitude of them that
[1:13:20] believed were of one heart and of one
[1:13:24] soul that's a key ingredient in him
[1:13:26] neither said they any of them that ought
[1:13:30] of the things which he possessed was his
[1:13:32] own but they had all things in common
[1:13:34] and with great power gave the Apostles
[1:13:40] witness of the resurrection of the Lord
[1:13:43] Jesus and great grace was upon them all
[1:13:47] there was no printed Bible at this time
[1:13:49] the Gospels were not printed they did
[1:13:52] not hand tracts out to him come on
[1:13:56] somebody they don't need tracts they
[1:13:58] need to live in God come on friends
[1:14:01] Jesus never said go and pass out tracts
[1:14:04] he said go and preach the gospel now I
[1:14:10] know that Devils tried to replace that
[1:14:11] it's not just handing out Bibles go and
[1:14:14] preach the gospel there's got to be
[1:14:17] living
[1:14:18] witnesses that know about the power of
[1:14:21] God how can they hear how can they know
[1:14:24] if they haven't heard how can they hear
[1:14:27] except there be a preacher and how can
[1:14:30] there be a preacher
[1:14:31] unless he's sent Omaha you see they were
[1:14:41] following the same pattern because the
[1:14:44] pattern giver was on the inside of them
[1:14:46] Acts chapter one here the Bible says thy
[1:14:49] former treatise
[1:14:50] have I made Oh falafel Asst of all that
[1:14:52] Jesus began both to do and teach until
[1:14:54] the day in which he was taken up after
[1:14:56] that he through the Holy Ghost had given
[1:14:59] Commandments unto the Apostles whom he
[1:15:01] had chosen to whom also he showed
[1:15:03] himself alive after his passion by many
[1:15:07] infallible proofs I'm asking you was
[1:15:10] that necessary
[1:15:11] it sure was he picked up a gloomy church
[1:15:14] on the road these are people that he had
[1:15:17] called out people that had walked away
[1:15:19] from the tax collection and everything
[1:15:21] else about their life but when things
[1:15:23] were not happening and going the way
[1:15:26] that they had it figured out they got
[1:15:28] all gloomy because it looked like here
[1:15:31] in jail we we thought this was it we
[1:15:33] thought this was the perfect Oasis we
[1:15:35] thought this was just right you know
[1:15:37] what it was it was their thinking was
[1:15:39] nothing wrong with the word was nothing
[1:15:41] wrong with God it was with their
[1:15:43] thinking but God is faithful
[1:15:45] because remember God can only prove his
[1:15:48] word by believers and remember it takes
[1:15:51] the Living God coming on the scene to
[1:15:54] cause faith to rise now remember here
[1:15:57] not only you say they need the Holy
[1:15:59] Ghost but before that they can receive
[1:16:01] the Holy Ghost and go and wait for it
[1:16:03] they've got to recognize that there let
[1:16:06] the redemption has come that there has
[1:16:08] been a ransom that has been paid and
[1:16:10] there it can be a release of that life
[1:16:14] that redemptive work of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:16] back down into the earth they've got to
[1:16:19] believe this they've got to believe it
[1:16:26] so you know what he does he takes forty
[1:16:29] days
[1:16:32] yeah he instructs him but he shows many
[1:16:36] infallible proofs the same things he did
[1:16:40] already now why didn't he if they were
[1:16:42] believers why didn't he say not you
[1:16:44] already see me do it you can't believe
[1:16:46] me yeah you're not a believer it's funny
[1:16:51] how the devil likes to supply quotes and
[1:16:54] scriptures you say because when you go
[1:16:57] talking about signs and wonders that old
[1:16:59] slick tongue devil will try to sneak up
[1:17:01] on a scripture a wicked and adulterous
[1:17:04] generation seeketh after a sign your
[1:17:06] misplace in the word devil that is a
[1:17:09] misplaced scripture they seek for a sign
[1:17:13] they're seeking for proof shows proof
[1:17:16] shows proof shows proof but the reality
[1:17:18] is they are not believers signs and
[1:17:22] wonders follow then that believe and
[1:17:25] when God makes himself known to
[1:17:27] believers it gets their attention God
[1:17:33] didn't send this message without signs
[1:17:35] and wonders if it came without signs and
[1:17:39] wonders that ain't God's message then
[1:17:42] you might have a right to call it a
[1:17:43] man's message but this ain't a man's
[1:17:45] message this is God's message come on
[1:17:48] somebody this message belongs to us
[1:17:51] this message was not just something that
[1:17:53] was said that we gather around and we
[1:17:56] pay homage to we're up paying homage to
[1:17:58] letters we are prostrating ourselves
[1:18:01] before the Living God and that living
[1:18:04] caught projecting his life inside of us
[1:18:07] and we are living images of the Living
[1:18:11] God he showed himself alive by
[1:18:16] identifying himself by the same things
[1:18:19] he did before you know sometimes you
[1:18:22] wonder why things happen in your home
[1:18:24] huh why does sickness come why does this
[1:18:28] come opportunities for God to make
[1:18:31] himself known you see what it is a
[1:18:34] testimony is not something that can be
[1:18:36] given you can't download it it's not on
[1:18:39] the App Store a testimony itself is
[1:18:42] personally between you
[1:18:44] God God drawing you personally to him he
[1:18:47] draws you to the water Samara
[1:18:49] he draws you to every step along the way
[1:18:52] what's he doing he's bringing you to
[1:18:55] himself and he and being assembled
[1:19:01] together with them verse four he
[1:19:04] commanded them to wait for the promise
[1:19:06] of the father which you've heard of me
[1:19:10] for John truly baptized with water but
[1:19:13] you shall be baptized with the Holy
[1:19:14] Ghost not many days since notice the
[1:19:16] voice behind these signs it was not a
[1:19:21] voice of you're all right it was a voice
[1:19:24] of said you need to get the Holy Ghost
[1:19:27] you need to be baptized with the Holy
[1:19:31] Ghost
[1:19:32] you need to be born again you see what
[1:19:35] this voice was when Moses went down to
[1:19:37] Egypt he did not come down there just
[1:19:39] saying oh you're the Blessed covenant
[1:19:41] people oh you're a wonderful covenant
[1:19:43] people
[1:19:43] you're predestinated and elected but he
[1:19:45] came down there with a message that
[1:19:47] would call them out and to bring them
[1:19:50] into their homeland notice
[1:19:56] Peter I a raise us up here you men of
[1:20:00] Israel hear these words Jesus of
[1:20:01] Nazareth a man approved of God among you
[1:20:04] by miracles and wonders and signs which
[1:20:06] God did by him in the midst of you as ye
[1:20:11] yourselves also know let me move on here
[1:20:16] let me move down the Bible goes on to
[1:20:19] say in verse 42 of Acts 2 they continued
[1:20:22] steadfastly in the Apostles doctrine and
[1:20:26] fellowship and in breaking of bread and
[1:20:28] in prayers and fear came upon every soul
[1:20:32] and many wonders and signs were done by
[1:20:37] the apostles now I want you to notice
[1:20:41] this not everybody was an apostle but
[1:20:45] you know what there were some who were
[1:20:46] praying for the apostles
[1:20:48] there were some who were fasting and
[1:20:51] praying for the Apostles because you
[1:20:53] know why they were part of the body it
[1:20:56] wasn't about what I got to be the one to
[1:20:58] lay my hands on them blessed God it's
[1:20:59] got to be my way no it wasn't about
[1:21:01] their well you see what they had so lost
[1:21:04] so lost sight of themselves it was about
[1:21:07] the advancement of the body so if their
[1:21:10] duty wants to pray remember like brother
[1:21:12] Ram talks to sister she carrion but
[1:21:14] grandma prayed I fasted brother BAM I
[1:21:16] still can't cast out Devils he said sis
[1:21:18] that was not for you to do that's he
[1:21:21] said your part is to pray and fast for
[1:21:24] those that God has set in the body to do
[1:21:28] it all glory be to God I'll tell your
[1:21:30] friends God's got a place and a part for
[1:21:33] each and every one in the body I don't
[1:21:36] care if my part is just to pray if my
[1:21:39] part is just to pray and stand behind it
[1:21:42] God let me do my part Lord God this is
[1:21:49] what was manifest when nobody mattered
[1:21:51] about anybody else
[1:21:54] huh glory be to God Omaha notice here
[1:21:59] let me go home in the Sardis in church
[1:22:02] age you all right notice he says the
[1:22:06] confirming of the Pentecostal church
[1:22:08] that's the confirming mark 16 God
[1:22:11] confirms himself alive as a miracle
[1:22:14] working God in the church speaking in
[1:22:18] tongues still believe that you may not
[1:22:22] speak in them here but you might be
[1:22:23] coming to prayer closet come on friends
[1:22:27] I still believe in the manifestation
[1:22:29] right here in this assembly I believe
[1:22:33] that God is still God I believe in it
[1:22:36] when I'm in my prayer closet ooh yes sir
[1:22:39] speaking in tongues interpreting of
[1:22:41] tongues and doing the same things they
[1:22:43] did at the beginning now you watch this
[1:22:45] you watch how the devil get all
[1:22:46] tightened up oh he's trying to take us
[1:22:50] back to all sorts of Pentecostalism no
[1:22:54] I'm not I'm preaching what the word says
[1:22:59] I'm preaching what the word says now if
[1:23:02] you don't want none of this inheritance
[1:23:03] you can stay on the other side of Jordan
[1:23:05] but these promises belong to me and God
[1:23:08] is still God I'll quote the same words
[1:23:10] to the Prophet
[1:23:11] he said I can show you where God put it
[1:23:13] in the church you show me where he took
[1:23:15] it out of the church but you see there's
[1:23:18] been a lot of editing from the Bible to
[1:23:20] where the people no longer know the
[1:23:21] Bible oh they know it's quotes but let
[1:23:23] me tell you something if the quotes
[1:23:25] don't put you back into the word to
[1:23:27] where your Bible is becoming alive to
[1:23:29] you and where will you read every verse
[1:23:31] of the Bible you can see Jesus Christ
[1:23:33] you might want to check up on what
[1:23:35] you're doing my brother and sister
[1:23:37] because the real reality of this message
[1:23:39] it will make this Bible become a life to
[1:23:43] you you see what the problem is a lot of
[1:23:48] times people are quoting quotes but they
[1:23:50] ain't lining it up with the word and
[1:23:53] they got their own ideas about what
[1:23:55] brother Branham says you said Moses
[1:23:57] anyhow you know it's an idea watch how
[1:23:59] it binds them up you know either bind
[1:24:01] them up or loosen them let me tell you
[1:24:03] something if your own ideas if it's your
[1:24:05] own idea it'll bind you up like an old
[1:24:07] pot apple it don't make you so sour
[1:24:10] it'll make you cantankerous it'll make
[1:24:12] you to where you can't get along with
[1:24:14] nobody but when it's God's thoughts
[1:24:16] behind it brother you recognize the
[1:24:18] mercy and the power and the glory and
[1:24:21] the grace of God you've got a feeling
[1:24:23] for somebody else that may not see it
[1:24:25] like you see it but the glory of God has
[1:24:28] moved down in your life a good litmus
[1:24:34] test is ask somebody what you got do
[1:24:37] they want it not us the message of the
[1:24:41] hour really you might have it but does
[1:24:44] it have you does the God whose Senate
[1:24:48] have you that's my question you know
[1:24:51] friends there's a lot of things so that
[1:24:53] a lot of preachers that cannot quote me
[1:24:54] they can go out all that country there
[1:24:56] okay the thing that I'm interested in is
[1:24:59] knowing God in a personal way and that
[1:25:02] living God's showing up and changing
[1:25:04] lives let me tell you something a person
[1:25:06] I know all the doctrines be able to put
[1:25:08] in lace everything all together and be
[1:25:10] as dead as a doornail
[1:25:12] because it takes a living clot to come
[1:25:14] on the scene and make that word alive
[1:25:17] and real God does not want just a bunch
[1:25:19] of people who are knowledge and puffed
[1:25:21] up with pride but God wants to make
[1:25:24] himself known in power and humility to
[1:25:27] wear hearts themselves are humbled in
[1:25:29] his presence who acts 8 for let's look
[1:25:41] at this this same pattern therefore they
[1:25:46] were scattered abroad and when
[1:25:48] everywhere preaching the word then
[1:25:51] Philip went down to the city of Samaria
[1:25:53] and preached Christ unto them and the
[1:25:56] people with one Accord gave heed unto
[1:25:59] those things which Philip spake hearing
[1:26:04] and seeing the miracles which he did
[1:26:11] he's still the same God tonight it's
[1:26:17] been witnessed right here in this
[1:26:18] assembly it's been witnessed in other
[1:26:20] places he's still the same God let me
[1:26:25] tell you something there's times that
[1:26:26] God shows up and God has healed many
[1:26:29] people and people will consent right
[1:26:31] here and say I wonder where gods at gods
[1:26:34] are right here there's testimonies all
[1:26:37] the way around this assembly come on
[1:26:39] somebody you know what it is your eyes
[1:26:42] are looking for him in your own way but
[1:26:44] if you can just say lord help me humble
[1:26:46] my heart don't let me put on these
[1:26:48] things that you got to come in a certain
[1:26:50] way but lord I want you to make yourself
[1:26:53] known I'm a believer you know how to get
[1:26:55] my attention you know how to raise my
[1:26:57] faith the Lord God will you just make
[1:26:59] yourself known and you watch him come on
[1:27:02] the scene he's done it by way of his
[1:27:06] word as well the same Holy Spirit coming
[1:27:09] and the word being delivered let me tell
[1:27:11] you something if it was just a Ministry
[1:27:13] of word only of reap reaching this and
[1:27:15] preaching this and there was no effect
[1:27:17] of the power
[1:27:18] God and signs and wonders being done
[1:27:20] you'd have a right to question but there
[1:27:23] is signs and wonders that are being done
[1:27:25] let me tell you something if in your
[1:27:26] home you're not a sign and Wonder and
[1:27:28] there are not signs and wonders and
[1:27:30] miracles in your home your your children
[1:27:32] got a right to question you come on
[1:27:35] somebody
[1:27:36] hoping to Samuel that's time let me tell

[1:28:09] tucking away daddy how about praying
[1:28:11] into the power of God falls in that home
[1:28:17] this is they gave heed because they
[1:28:20] heard and seen the miracles which were
[1:28:21] done for unclean spirits crying with
[1:28:25] loud voice came out of many that were
[1:28:30] possessed with them and many taken with
[1:28:33] palsies and that word lame were healed
[1:28:36] and there was great joy in that city now
[1:28:40] watch this here's a man by the name of
[1:28:44] Simon in the same city he had used
[1:28:48] sorcery and bewitched the people of
[1:28:51] Samaria given out that himself with some
[1:28:53] great one that's a sorcerer elevate
[1:28:57] himself when you feel like as though
[1:29:00] that you have everything that's a spirit
[1:29:03] of sorcery cast that thing down to whom
[1:29:06] they all gave heed from the least to the
[1:29:08] greatest saying this man is the great
[1:29:10] power of God and to him they had regard
[1:29:13] because that of a long time he had
[1:29:15] bewitched them with sorcerers you think
[1:29:17] Satan in real didn't say this man just
[1:29:23] had words he bewitched them with sorcery
[1:29:27] demonic spirits you understand the
[1:29:31] holy ghost travels by the word demons
[1:29:34] travel by words that's why you got to be
[1:29:36] careful what you say you got to be
[1:29:38] careful once you're around that's why
[1:29:40] the Prophet would tell us over and over
[1:29:41] after you're prayed for don't you go out
[1:29:43] there and associate with unbelievers you
[1:29:45] associated with people who believe in
[1:29:48] God like you - why would I want to be
[1:29:52] prayed for and gonna get around a bunch
[1:29:53] of people who's doubters that don't even
[1:29:55] know the power of God I want to be in
[1:29:57] fellowship with people who know that God
[1:30:00] is called people who are there to
[1:30:02] encourage me people who are there to
[1:30:05] lift up the name of Jesus these demon
[1:30:12] powers were at work but I love this when

[1:30:18] things concerning the kingdom of God and
[1:30:21] the name of Jesus Christ they were
[1:30:24] baptized both men and women what

[1:30:42] no power no mighty hand no psychologist
[1:30:44] no doctor that could do anything for him
[1:30:47] and they witnessed people who were bound
[1:30:50] with the policy had the shakes
[1:30:52] they witnessed the power of God move on
[1:30:55] the scene and set them free they
[1:30:59] witnessed the healing power of God what
[1:31:02] if they were believers when Philip
[1:31:04] preached they to just come ah that slit

[1:34:44] and wonders follow them that believe I
[1:34:47] believe in that Lord God I want to

[1:34:52] to work in unexpected ways unexpected
[1:34:57] times can I go on good watch this acts
[1:35:09] 13 here they were Barnabas Simon those
[1:35:16] of Niger Simon that was called Niger
[1:35:18] Lucius of Cyrene my name which had
[1:35:21] brought up with Herod the Tetrarch and
[1:35:23] Saul as they ministered to the Lord and
[1:35:26] fasted the Holy Ghost said you see God
[1:35:32] still talks and people of God still
[1:35:37] believe in fasting I believe in fasting
[1:35:41] don't you ha ha brother Samuel the
[1:35:44] bridegroom has come or we don't have to
[1:35:46] fast anymore
[1:35:47] another misplaced scripture
[1:35:51] seyton robbing you of what God has given
[1:35:55] you the bridegroom not only had already
[1:35:58] come the bridegroom was in them and they
[1:36:01] were fasting you know how they were
[1:36:04] fasting they were fasting and setting
[1:36:07] themselves aside for him
[1:36:09] that's how serious they were about
[1:36:13] serving God oh and here he said separate
[1:36:18] me Barnabas and Saul for the work I've
[1:36:21] called him and when they had fasted and
[1:36:22] prayed and laid their hands on him they
[1:36:24] sent him away so they being sent forth
[1:36:27] by the Holy Ghost so you mean it wasn't
[1:36:30] those brothers who sent him forth no was
[1:36:32] the Holy Ghost they were instruments
[1:36:34] then recognized the leading of the Holy
[1:36:35] Ghost
[1:36:36] and just extended their hands and prayed
[1:36:39] and showing we're standing with what God
[1:36:41] has already shown is that right now
[1:36:44] notice this here and they were there at
[1:36:47] Salamis they preached the Word of God in
[1:36:49] the synagogue's of the Jews and they
[1:36:51] also had John - their minister and when
[1:36:53] they had gone through the Isle of pathos
[1:36:55] they found a certain sorcery a false
[1:37:01] prophet oh so sorcerers are false
[1:37:03] prophets hello somebody sorcerers are
[1:37:08] false prophets a Jew whose name was Bar
[1:37:13] Jesus
[1:37:15] to Betty 1 identified with Jesus which
[1:37:19] was with the deputy of the country
[1:37:21] Sergius Paulus a prudent man who called
[1:37:25] for Barnabas and Saul and desired to
[1:37:27] hear the word of God but in limas the
[1:37:30] sorcerer for so is his name high
[1:37:32] interpretations withstood them seeking
[1:37:35] to turn away the deputy from the faith
[1:37:38] don't you see what Satan was trying to
[1:37:40] do he was trying to get between the
[1:37:43] deputy and Paul and Barnabas who were
[1:37:47] packing the Word of Life he wanted to
[1:37:51] get between him now watch what happened
[1:37:53] and saw filled with the Holy Ghost he
[1:37:55] set his eyes on him he was discernment
[1:37:59] he realized this hindrance this
[1:38:02] opposition ain't nothing but the devil
[1:38:04] come on friends as children of God I
[1:38:07] believe that we need to have discernment
[1:38:09] we need to recognize if there are things
[1:38:12] that's coming between us and God we need
[1:38:14] to call it for what it is we need to
[1:38:17] talk stop making excuses we need to stop
[1:38:19] around the devil just to shove
[1:38:21] everything in our pathway we need to
[1:38:23] come back to recognizing that we got one
[1:38:26] purpose there ought to be one motive and
[1:38:28] one objective while we're here in this
[1:38:30] life and that's to serve the Living God
[1:38:32] and that he would be glorified in our
[1:38:34] lives
[1:38:37] filled with the Holy Ghost he set his
[1:38:40] eyes on him he said o fool of sucked
[1:38:43] ility and all mischief thou child of the
[1:38:46] devil who he didn't play did he thou
[1:38:49] enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not
[1:38:53] cease to pervert the right ways of the
[1:38:56] Lord and now behold the hand of the Lord
[1:38:58] is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not
[1:39:01] seeing the Sun for a season and
[1:39:03] immediately there fell on him amidst a
[1:39:06] darkness and he went about seeking Sun
[1:39:08] to lead him by the hand been the deputy
[1:39:10] when he saw what was done believed being
[1:39:14] astonished at the doctrine of the Lord
[1:39:17] do you realize what he saw he saw the
[1:39:20] doctrine of the Lord he believed
[1:39:26] one opened him what he saw God do God
[1:39:36] knows how to get to people this guy
[1:39:41] thought he had it shut off not know
[1:39:43] anyone shut off from God reaching it
[1:39:46] said to me reading the next one let me
[1:39:47] just refer to him here you find Paul
[1:39:51] walking through the city there is a
[1:39:55] woman who's bound with an evil spirit
[1:39:58] matter of fact she's possessed
[1:40:00] they've used her in divination what
[1:40:03] Devil's speaking through her and here
[1:40:07] she is watch this The Devil's recognized
[1:40:10] who Paul and Barnabas were they walked
[1:40:13] around saying these men teach us the way
[1:40:16] of salvation those Devils look at this
[1:40:20] Paul and Barnabas had not even said
[1:40:22] anything to him but the very presence
[1:40:25] and dedication glory of their walk
[1:40:29] before God
[1:40:30] it caused even the devil's to testify of
[1:40:33] who they were and who they represented
[1:40:35] Oh friends it ought to be when we walk
[1:40:38] in the workplace when we walk in the
[1:40:40] grocery store were out among our family
[1:40:42] and other places it ought to be that
[1:40:45] demons tremble that demons know the
[1:40:48] reputation that is behind the life
[1:40:51] that's being lived not handing quotes to
[1:40:57] the devil but you're the manifestation
[1:40:59] of the quote hello notice what he said I
[1:41:06] command thee here she was many days with
[1:41:08] him and Paul looked around and said to
[1:41:09] the spirit I command thee in the name of
[1:41:11] Jesus Christ to come out of her and he
[1:41:13] came out the same hour notice the key
[1:41:18] words the same hour maybe not the same
[1:41:22] minute maybe it was 1520 but the word
[1:41:26] had been spoken Satan had already been
[1:41:29] assured the power of God had been
[1:41:32] manifest to take authority over that
[1:41:34] devil and in the same hour
[1:41:36] she was dead have heard now you think
[1:41:41] Omaha the whole city is going to say wow
[1:41:43] but no they threw him in jail but it's
[1:41:46] right where God wanted him
[1:41:49] lord have mercy we just came through one
[1:41:51] sickness and not right where God wanted
[1:41:54] them and now here they are in jail but
[1:41:58] you see what it is there's a jailer down
[1:42:00] there that belongs to God and that
[1:42:03] jailer would not know about this unless
[1:42:06] Paul and Silas were down there and even
[1:42:09] though Paul and Silas were in the jail
[1:42:10] no doubt when they came in there or what
[1:42:12] are you in here for what did checking in
[1:42:14] for how these are sedition these are
[1:42:16] guys you know rebel rousers and
[1:42:18] everything else you know just put them
[1:42:20] away in the cell down there you know
[1:42:22] we're gonna we've already agreed we're
[1:42:24] gonna you know we've already whipped him
[1:42:25] and things like that just just put him
[1:42:27] on down there okay he wrote it on down
[1:42:30] he had already seen a lot of guys that
[1:42:32] were nuts come on people who were rebel
[1:42:36] rousers but little did he know God had
[1:42:40] them there for him
[1:42:42] and God was going to do something so
[1:42:45] special for him and his household and
[1:42:48] that he would have an effect on the rest
[1:42:50] of that city God shook the very
[1:42:53] foundations of that prison Paul and
[1:42:56] Silas begin to testify and to praise God
[1:43:00] and the Bible says that there came up
[1:43:02] and earthquake let me ask you something
[1:43:04] who else do you know that can bring
[1:43:06] about an earthquake and can control
[1:43:08] walls and control situations where there
[1:43:11] wasn't no lives lost but where everybody
[1:43:14] in there that had shackles on them their
[1:43:16] shackles was broke away let me tell you
[1:43:18] something there's only one person that
[1:43:20] can do that and that's the Living God
[1:43:22] coming on the scene oh my that same God
[1:43:25] can move rock for here tonight he can
[1:43:27] break down walls he can loosen shackles
[1:43:30] he can remove bars and doors where
[1:43:34] you've been walled in that Saint God can
[1:43:36] move a ride right where you're sitting
[1:43:39] why would he do that
[1:43:41] to raise your faith
[1:43:43] that's why I do it lord have mercy on
[1:43:56] and on we could go the Bible says in
[1:44:00] another place in acts 19 Paul laboured
[1:44:04] one we're in one place for two years
[1:44:06] teaching the Word of God
[1:44:09] and the Bible says special miracles were
[1:44:13] wrought by his hands why so that the
[1:44:20] people might believe believe in who
[1:44:25] believe in God believe hogan-sama but by
[1:44:30] believing itself that's not enough but
[1:44:32] it is a necessary start
[1:44:37] how can you seek after something that
[1:44:39] you don't know to be real the only way
[1:44:44] you can see can look and you yield and
[1:44:47] desire the Holy Ghost you got to know
[1:44:49] that God is real and you got to know
[1:44:51] that he means you you got to know that
[1:44:54] you're included you say how do I know
[1:44:55] that by the Lord God moving and dealing
[1:44:58] with your heart speaking to your heart
[1:45:00] things that you know that men do not
[1:45:02] know but you know it's a living God
[1:45:05] discerning your heart calling out
[1:45:07] thoughts that you've had calling out
[1:45:09] these things what is that that ain't God
[1:45:11] trying to embarrass you he's letting you
[1:45:13] know that he knows your cries that
[1:45:16] you've cried what you prayed about what
[1:45:18] you've longed for you realize what that
[1:45:20] is that's opportunities for him to show
[1:45:22] up on and on we could go through the
[1:45:26] scriptures here of even where they came
[1:45:29] into such a place where there were men
[1:45:31] who took it upon themselves as Exorcist
[1:45:33] to call on the name of Jesus and they
[1:45:36] wanted to call upon the name of Jesus
[1:45:37] but them demon spirit said I know Paul
[1:45:39] and I know Jesus but who are you
[1:45:42] and when that was done remember the evil
[1:45:44] spirits that was on the demon possessed
[1:45:46] man it jumped upon them they went out of
[1:45:49] the house naked but remember there that
[1:45:51] here the Bible says that the name of the
[1:45:54] Lord Jesus Christ was magnified before
[1:46:00] the people and the Word of God prevailed
[1:46:04] and grew mightily
[1:46:08] God is still God God started this Exodus
[1:46:14] with signs wonders and miracles and he
[1:46:19] still signs wonders miracles I believe
[1:46:26] I'm talking to people tonight that know
[1:46:28] him
