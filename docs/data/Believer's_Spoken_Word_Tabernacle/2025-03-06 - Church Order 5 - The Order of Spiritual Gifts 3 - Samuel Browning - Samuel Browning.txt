oh I sing glory to the son of God [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen [Music] our sorry um I just I had I called uh brother brother Aaron and because uh I know even for him he at the first part of the week wasn't feeling too well either and but um I know there's some others that's not feeling well tonight and they're not here that normally would be here so as much as I hate to cancel the fellowship dinner um and uh it's not about the food believe it or not it's not about don't don't let your eyes tell you that but uh I I do love the food but we'll try to get it reschedule when we can I had been I'd had that in the back of my mind simply because of what we've kind of had going on here at the church and I know not we're not um just the only ones but uh there's different ones in other assemblies as well and we've had some where some people are just starting to get back and get over things as well so uh I think it's I really feel in my heart it's the best interest to to do that so we'll just try to reschedule that and uh if we can I know times and dates and things like that kind of get uh filled up so um if I can let me try to find somebody if you have a problem with it let me see if I can find someone that you can contact just uh but uh I I really hate to do that but I think it's in the best interest just to we get past this season and um with sickness and things like that Al Al I sent out the calendar here today and there are some events just uh take a look at that on the telegram on the text message that was sent out today as well as it's on the it's in there in the restrooms at just upcoming events the book order sheet I took a look at that here the other day and I've already talked with brother George Smith and so um on Sunday I'll take the final tallies off of that and then I'll get we're going to get the order I was just kind of prepping brother George and how what what we're looking at and so we'll get those books ordered on Lord willing on Monday for the seven Church age books The Seven Seals if you happen to want one um the order forms out there um put it on and I I certainly would I certainly want um that in in everyone's hand um and uh whether it's Spanish or English and like I said to you before I've already had different ones I had someone last night telling me on the phone hey i' I wanted to give a donation towards that so if um if uh you you need help with a book or whatever more see me uh because I I to me I want the book in your hand uh the seven Church age book is very important um and so I want that you know where we can go through it and certainly would like I told you last Thursday I only have so many services but boy I would like just to take just a track through that like I did with the young people and um it just it's it's just so wonderful and so I know you'll be blessed and um so so um that's that's the only other announcements that I have here and uh we just want to go right on into the word here this evening and so if we could let's just stand I feel like there's something else but I have all my Post-It notes here but it doesn't mean I didn't forget to write something down but uh oh time changed I don't have to I don't have to worry about that everybody's got cell phones for some people time doesn't change that's that only works at certain times right it's during the fallback that when it goes falls back we just don't tell some people we just let it just go just say hey time's the same you know but um I thought about that here today you know even with them the time change I was thinking as I was walking in the sanctuary and just praying and I thought my you know it just starts getting into that time of the year where we gain that hour here and then it'll be a little bit more Daylight and it keeps on going going as we're coming to church and I I really look forward to that if you're going to take my snow away give me daylight but this year because of the parking lot I'm I'm glad that the snow held off and I tell you I kept on looking out the window the other day the the days that I'm here I look at it is that snow drift out there is it getting smaller you know I almost wanted to just go out there and shovel it all but um anyhow I'm thankful that for the Lord's made a way for us amen we could be here tonight and so good to see each and every one of you and umen it's good to be a Christian isn't it it's good to be serving the lord and U so let's just look here in in the scriptures tonight I want to go right to 1 Corinthians chapter 12 and I'm going to just go a little bit more here in in this on the order of spiritual gifts tonight and um so in verse 27 uh Paul writes now you are the body of Christ and members in particular and God hath set some in the church first apostles secondarily prophets thirdly teachers after that Miracles then Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues then he asked the question are all Apostles are all prophets and are all teachers are all all workers of Miracles have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way how many know that more excellent way is to seek after The Giver Divine love that's that's that's greater that's greater than any any gift because that's what really gives it value and substance that's right amen that's that's where it really has the the density behind it and so that's even in in every and each of our lives so let's just go to the Lord in a word of prayer tonight Heavenly Father Lord I just know Lord that throughout the assembly as we would come together father there are many needs Lord that not only have already been mentioned and read and hands that have been uplifted and you know each one father you know our needs Lord and father you know just how to speak to our hearts and Lord even through these times moments Lord of even of teaching we have seen you Lord even last week how that you would so take things so personal Lord and father we lord as much as Lord just staying steadfast Lord in laying these things in but in everything father you you know every need if there's something Lord that would need to be mentioned or said then father may you give the unction for it if there's anything Lord that would not be pleasing or needful Lord may you just close my mouth and turn me from it Lord and I pray that you and all things here tonight Lord May our understanding be fruitful Lord by the spirit of God coming down and taking the word and breaking it to our hearts Lord we need you father as congregation and hearer together we need you Lord as a as a minister Lord I need you father may you just come Lord and help us tonight heal those that are sick among us Lord those that are streaming Lord right now father and others Lord that are recovering Lord I pray that you'll just continue to give strength and health and Lord we ask God for a protection Lord oh God that Lord for on our lives and our bodies Lord that even our systems might be built back up Lord we pray we know that there's nothing Lord that would be Lord Beyond in asking those things because even you said Lord through the Apostle John that you would that we would be in good health and that our health would Prosper even as our soul so we ask Lord that you'll just Lord not only touching Lord hearts and lives but God just granting Lord real Health Lord I pray father among your children Lord we love you and we thank you father in Jesus J name amen amen God bless you as you're being seated I want to just Journey here a little bit more tonight on this thought on the order of spiritual gifts and I want to as we look here in that opening scripture where it says God hath set in the church and uh you know you hear Brother Braham say it over and over in the message he says if God has put it in the church then he says no man has a right to take it out and if God placed it there there's a need for all of those things yes and it's just like as though when you remember a few weeks ago when I brought out all of those different utensils out of my office that I use at times stapler scissors knife even this that I use to sometimes just you know be able to you have that laser pointer that's up there you know I don't use that all the time I don't feel that every service I have to use this but if I find that there's something that maybe on a graph or something that I see that needs to be pointed out or maybe to try to draw attention on the slide to something then I'll do that and that's even when God has placed the nine spiritual gifts in the body it's not something that it has to to be or we we should have the feeling as though that certain things and this has to be uh it has to be you know every service or it has to be this way we just want to know that we're first of all we're in the body of Jesus Christ by the new birth that's what's important that should have been a louder Amen on that that's number one that's right if if we never had one manifestation of a gift Among Us that will not prevent the Rapture that's good that's good as a matter of fact brother Bram says and I'll read in another place in the message when he opens in 1963 church order he says this church he says is one of the most spiritual churches not because he said that we have the most speaking in tongues and gifts and they had it it's not because he said of all those things he said but it's the quality of the spirit that's among us and that quality of the spirit that's Among Us that's Divine love that's working that's why brother Bram would say over and over he said if I had an opportunity or I had the choice that God said would would you rather William brandham that I give you all of these nine gifts or I give you love he said I wouldn't even have to think about it I would ask him for divine love he said if he you know he laid out a lot of different criterias on things but it just it shows that's very much in the scripture how Paul was writing to the Corinthians and as I said here earlier that in some of the messages we often times the prophet will talk about that you know how that God uh through Paul never had to speak regarding these things to that of the uh Ephesians or to uh the Romans or the Thessalonians and Philippians and so forth but there's other things they had to be they had to be addressed in those churches and Paul actually touched a little bit there even in the Book of Romans but he never had to go into such a great uh elaborate way as he did here in the book of Corinthians but as I said before is that if if there are not uh circumstances or things that are before us that does not allow us to see and give us an example and how that God would come back around and bring correction you or I would be in a manner in this way we would have no writings on this at all but the spirit of God through through what was a weakness in that Corinthian Church but God came around and he used that and the spirit of God set everything in order and there was Victory and you say how do you know there was Victory how do you know that they grow from that just read second Corinthians when you read second Corinthians this is not mentioned see between first and second there's they grew and what what was it the word they had to trust the word of the Lord beyond their feelings they had to trust when Paul uh When Paul placed them the the Corinthians it's very evident they were taken very much with the Supernatural and as a Believer we we are born of the supernatural you love the supernatural but the thing of it is is that within it all there there is there are the right things that we are to be seeking after and that's him we don't ever you know one thing about it we don't have to push we don't have to Prime we don't have to try to figure out you know you know one thing within it you know sometimes you might have heard you might hear a minister say my I got better get busy I I I got to you know look at what I'm going to speak well in reality the things of it is is how God will sovereignly drop there's a lot of things that even as a minister that I can have a I have a lot of different studies and things that would be going but yet it's it's what what does the Holy Spirit say that is needful for right now that's good that's good there's some things that even throughout this week he's really turned me and then even to Day for Sunday that really just coming back around on some things that just just pressing from the beginning of the week and where we're at and we want to be mindful it's it's things that just to be um yielded to the holy spirit so we don't have to we don't have to the one thing that I want to just say to you and for everything within our hearts and our lives is we don't have we don't ever want to walk by Impressions we don't want impressions the prophet is very clear maybe if I have a service I'll take that on that and and we don't want to enter into anything with a manner of is that oh as I said before last week where oh I see this in the church and I think this needs to be spoken to that's carnal right there because even as a even as a minister there are things that as your pastor look as the pastor I see the things I see the things that not even out here but God will reveal sometimes the way God will reveal certain things to me and other times there's things that I have no idea about you know I don't I don't go asking him Lord reveal me everything I just know this I got confidence in the word the gift is there I got confidence in the Lord he knows what we need I don't have to know I don't have to know every situation as a matter of fact I like it when I don't know it but there's times God would speak to me sometimes he's done that by dreams sometimes he's done it with other things and you know as you just wait on the Lord you watch the word and sometimes I've watched God take text that I that I would never have guessed that that text is what was going to meet the need and sometimes the very things that you don't see it out there but if you only seen and you could see inside of me up here and see everything is all all moved around and and here I am standing here and yet God would take a service like that that you feel like scrambled eggs would be would be a plus compared to that and God will work right through that you know God has a sense of humor yes he does he has a sense of humor and I'm glad about that you know God has such a way of just letting us know hey it's me it's me it's not you it's me it's me he has a way aren't you glad I I love being humbled that way so we we just want to look at this and I want to say if God said it in the church we certainly we do not want to be guilty of taking it out right right uh and and we don't have to prop it up we just have to be available in the body filled filled with the spirit of God and our hearts submitted to the word of God and God will work I like how brother says this in 1954 he says there's many gifts over here in the Methodist Church there's many over in the Baptist Church if it was only preached so the gift could go to operating remember brother Ram was a Baptist pastor he had all the gifts in the church and he had them even to a place to where he wanted to get them back to in the Tabernacle where they were meeting in a little room brother Braham had that there and that's where he kind of chided the Pentecostals he said if God would do that for a Baptist pastor among Baptist people he said what would God do among the Pentecostal people so the prophet knew where where he was going with he's the prophet of the age and watch I I love how he says this if you put a seed in the ground and don't cultivate it what's going to happen to it it will lay there in dry dust and rot it'll do no good these gifts have been in the church all along but just now the waters Begin to Fall the Pentecostal rain to water it and bring forth fruit now use it in the right place so it wasn't the very thing remember you hear Brother Bram say over and over always said if I could just we could just you know teach on this and we could just set the tent up or all these things and he just he wanted to do that and you say well why didn't he why didn't he do that at the Tabernacle he did do it at the Tabernacle as a matter of fact he went through and I purposely in these slides throughout the times even have left in there where these messages were preached and I've done it for this reason is so you can see it is the prophet for the age and the prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word it's setting the church in order not just the local church it's to set the Church of the Living God in order and that's why brother brandham when he takes that message the church order he doesn't just say to brandham Tabernacle he says but to the Church of the Living God the body of Jesus Christ and so when we look and seeing this of how that God has placed it here within within the church we know that even within things Paul would write about how that it should be uh something that would be of a certain sound it should give direction it should give uh it should it should be very clear it shouldn't be something that's vague now Paul was writing this even in regards to just you know if if people just came in and everybody was just speaking in tongues and Paul said you know they'll come in and say you're all mad but he goes in to say of that the very thing that that should be the focus is that of Prophecy because and it's evident when Paul would say that he he didn't he's when he speaks of that because in the order of the gifts wisdom is actually the highest gift there is and that's why that Paul would write that wisdom and knowledge because as brother Bram says if you don't have wisdom and knowledge how you going to know to operate those things but see God has set wisdom has come down into the church and that wisdom that God has sent down into the church is the very thing that's spoken of in the Book of Revelation where it says herein is wisdom God has sent God has sent a prophet and that that even working that through a prophet's life it begins it puts the church in order and giving us the leadership and direction that we need so it must come with a it must be a certain sound not something that's that's uncertain and anything that doesn't ring true with the word of God is an uncertain sound everything is to be judged by the word of God everything every Spirit every feeling is to be judged by the word of God and when I say the word I'm not just even talking about the letter how be it we we want we go by the letter but it's also the character of it it's a spirit of it it's a things that's behind it so notice notice in the scripture here it says if the whole church become together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned unbelievers will they not say you're all mad but if all prophesy and there come in one that believeth not or one unlearned he is convinced of all he is judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth and I just want to say it in this way we there's a lot of substitute but we want real am I I don't think anybody wants a substitute Holy Ghost you want the real Holy Ghost you don't want a substitute experience you you you want an experience that's real that goes down to your soul if I had had an opportunity and and here you there were fake $100 bills and real $100 bills don't get too excited real $100 bills you know if you're not careful remember the substitute will look very will look very close right it's not going to be when you've studied the real and you know the real well let's say somebody from another country they may not know what the real $100 bill looks like so to them it could be some things it could be just off and they haven't studied it they haven't seen it so it'd be pretty easy to pull off the counterfeit but this is why that Satan he's a deceiver yes he's not somebody that we to be afraid of see we're not to be afraid of him we have a word that God has given to discern it and to judge it just like it comes down to our decisions if you just step back for a minute decisions that you have in your life Life coming in your life or on you don't have to be afraid even though they can be momentous decisions life altering changing so forth decisions but trust in the Lord and the Bible says acknowledge Him in all thy ways and he shall direct thy footsteps that pass so we we have a place of confidence that we can go to we're not alone and So within this of when I say that of real and substitute brother BR says in Jehovah Gyra 6 one in Long Beach he says we don't have to take a substitute the Pentecostal skies are full of the genuine why take something that's bogus when there's a real one make it real then there's no slip UPS right now he goes on to to speak of this here in that message and he's talking of how that in in this message how that there are are things that even when the message would be coming forth and I'm talking about in tongues interpret ation he says he said by discernment he says you can tell he said some of it is purely flesh and how many of you know brother Bram was was a real gentleman yes and see when I'm studying these things the things that I'm looking for purposely even as I've gone through some of the things that I brought to you last week I'm looking at where where where this is being said is it being said outside of the Tabernacle or is it being set inside the Tabernacle because brother brandham brother Bram you'll you'll find one thing that brother Bram never said and I I'll get into this in a later time brother Bram even cautioned us he said don't be calling something of the devil that's he said you reverence it he said too many times we as humans we misjudge things yeah sometimes it's by appearance sometimes it's by looking at like like brother BR says you could say well that that person's a hypocrite he says you don't judge whether it's true based on the person whether they're a hypocrite or not you judge the spirit right that's so good right see that's that that's where that's why the brother BR I'm when I'm saying that I'm looking at a character we we're trained and God is revisiting these things but it's looking at it very carefully that there are not things that we're just just simply just just you know just coming out say well that that that's that's of the devil it's of the devil when it's proven false that's when when there's an evil spirit that's got in now you might say well I can tell many quotes I can give you and I will at a later time where brother Bram says I can't tell I've got them I'm you know I'm not just saying things that are out there he says he he says I I can't I can't judge that now this is where you understand that for the Prophet The Prophet was not one and I want to say this in the right way the prophet of God was not one and I want to say this in a way that it's I'm trying to get it very clearly he did not have donuts with the angel of the Lord every morning so true and if you want to quote on that yes sir brother Brown tells us when remember when the little lady that she was suffering from that anxiousness and all those things like that he did not know what was her problem but he says when the angel of the Lord comes to my home I'll send mey to get you brother Bram says a few days had went by m week or whatever more and when the angel of the Lord he told me to go get and bring her here and even when he was Walking in Memphis he didn't know why the plane was grounded he has he has he just what are we going what are you going to do he doesn't know that and he even said as as I quoted that to you he walks up to the mailbox even when he's dropping the letter in and he asked in himself is this just an impression same way when he was about ready to step over into Israel and he kept being pressed kept being pressed and finally he pulled back into the little air the airport The Hanger where the where the the planes are at took off his hat and said Lord is that you that's talking to me why it's trying every Spirit we don't take it by feelings so good we don't even take it by just one statement when I when I'm looking to study in the message even there's things that can be dropped as a thought I do not take thoughts and run with it because the devil can give thoughts yeah it's got to be proven out through the word when I got see it proven we're working it right through the word of God right through the message of the hour right through you can see it working out amen amen the urum must speak Hallelujah is that all right yes it is now he says it he says if there wasn't a message same same message I'm quoting from if there wasn't a message directly to somebody like that it was flesh and we didn't accept it at all so if it wasn't something that was directly to someone he says now what if I come here now watch how he's opening this up what if I come here and I said the Lord tells me somebody's got kidney trouble he said how many's got kidney trouble sure it's all over the building I've seen that so impersonated of a gift of God somebody tells me the Lord tells me Hallelujah I feel it's nervous somebody in here is nervous sure the whole crowd is no that's not it who is notice he's directing who is who is nervous who who and where did they come from what caused it and what's going to be the outcome you say brother Samuel that would take a profit now that gift that operated on the platform was that of the prophet of God for the hour and a prophet is not to be judged right but a gift of Prophecy which will work in the same exact manner is to be judged by two or three before it's received I'll get into this later on this is where brother br says the error that came among the latter room the latter rain movement so how many believe God is that direct oh yeah and I have to I have to kind of clarify a few points my wife and I we were uh just you know fellowshipping you know with these things and she she pointed out to me and my memory was a little bit I guess a little foggy there and you know I like the thing I got a good memory I I I listen if my memory goes on other things as long as I can remember the message of the hour and God brings those things back to me and I'll take it but some of the things she said honey she said the other night she said God has called names right in this assembly she said and I forgot about this she said he actually called dad's name in that message I was referring to last week when we were in the other place and it called him mountain and it was about you're at your kades barnea and of course then he was at the altar right then wow it called out the name and then there's others that you know that that has been it's been called right out where the spirit of God would would come and now if I want you to catch this that's something that is so direct at that moment a person knows you understand some the person knows but if but what's different when when in judging is that if it's says and brother Brown we use these examples there is a lady that's going to be coming to church she's got a green scarf she's from Ohio she used to be a treasur of a church she stole some money out of that and in order for her to be delivered of that cancer she needs to make that right see what's it for it's not embarrassment it's to help her right right when we talk when brother bam talks about that of ananas saf remember even the prophet himself he tells us this in Christ The Mystery of God revealed when he's dealing with that of the discernment on the platform he said you have to watch it he said because it could cause penitentiary offens with things being uncovered what wisdom see see it's not just the things that are being said through the message of the hour it's a character it's a character that that's what that's what we want to make sure is is the character we can have all of the words just right we got to make sure we get the character and I'm not talking about the character of William Bram I'm when I see that within William Bram I recognize that the same Holy Spirit lives in me then I've Got Confidence that what that portion that pertains to me to you will produce the same character amen are you with me cuz he didn't have a bigger portion of the Holy Spirit and you've got a smaller portion remember God has divided and God operated through that gift is that right glory be to God so with that portion and this is a little side note with that portion of the Holy Spirit operating through that of brother brandham and stood right there and stood face to face with the Enemy over and over look he's the same God for you and for me within every situation we just got to trust him Lord You're a way maker you're the one Lord to open up the way of I I maybe not know how to turn here I don't even know how to get myself out of this or that but Lord I'm trusting in you for greater is he amen that is in me amen than he that's in the world Amen it's a confidence in God now notice he says if not he said that's just carnal impersonation it's carnal in the sight of God why accept that when there's a real one why do that when there's a genuine now let me just say it in this way there are things and I we'll get into this later that yes things there's things that at times where things can start in such a baby way and and brother around him even for himself just letting things kind of grow and letting it build and so forth there's an objective in line I I don't think any parent here still would would rather have well I don't want to say that because maybe some of the mothers would say yeah I would rather they be in pamper so I can I don't have to worry about them and you know they're 45 and I got to tuck them in their bed and you know I understand that but but but but I don't think anyone any parent here once their once their children dis they would stay just just back there the whole time but there's a there's a there's a there's a desire to see them grow and in order for them to grow they're going to make mistakes you know you you you can't put you know styrofoam over all your walls and walk around and everywhere instead of carpet we're going to take bubble wrap and put it down just in case you fall stairs no more stairs we're going to just cut the top part of the house everything's going to be downstairs no more sharp edge tables we'll just use blow up little tight tables but we understand as much as we can with parameters we know there's got to be growth and sometimes sometimes that growth it comes through learning it comes through mistakes it comes through those things just like here in the book of Corinthians where we can step up and we can teach those things however however we want to cultivate the cultivated and not just let things go because a child left himself you know any person just left in God takes a word and he cares for that word he wants to see that word come to maturity and so when we're looking at this here you would look and say well why would people be we drive be going after uh uh something that wasn't genuine sometimes it's because of a person feeling or congregation or Pastor if they have that that I tell you our church we've got it there's gifts there's speaking in tongues there's prophecy boy we got it and they're wanting now I let me just let me let me phrase a little bit here I don't say that people are wanting to be an error but sometimes it's wanting something so bad as though that that's a source of vindication tongues and interpretation and all of this is no source of vindication that's good that's so good remember the evidence of the Holy Ghost has always been the same and that is receiving the word for your dayall the prophet said you may never speak in tongues you may never shout you may never run you may never and he goes on and let your light so shine on and on and on but he says your life will be changed and see that's your resting place because there's times you don't feel like a Christian but that does not define you hallelujah hallu hallelujah that's good preaching come on now that's right that's so good I'm just going to I need to move on because there's some things I could say that I've had to deal with where individuals you know here in prayer brother Samy I want to I want you to pray the Lord will let me do this no I'm I'm not going to pray for that let's get down to what what is this what's going on CU we're not chasing after things we we we want to get settled on the word of God a might run one time and never run again or they might do this and never run again but there there is a place where we can be settled in God hallelujah hallelujah and you say how do I know that that settl is a revelation in your heart that you know I'm not the same person that I used to be and let me tell you something that when everything around you is giving way that's an anchor that holds within the Veil [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's something that if you could not even walk your feet you could not run or you maybe wouldn't even be able to raise your hands but youve got a joy that pulsates in your soul that I know in whom I have believe and I am persuaded he is able that's my sacred sand that's my portion that's my inheritance that's the safety zone right there devil you got any question let's go to the sacred sounds right Hallelujah let's go talk to my father thank you Lord that was free that's good don't you like those free things that come I do I enj but notice I I want to just kind of work with this here a little bit and out of that direct message let me read just a few more statements the prophet makes he says God don't use vain repetitions that's from the scripture he doesn't use that quoting scripture he's already done that he asked us not to do the same it's something definite for somebody in the church for a purpose he says it's saying something directly to be interpreted for a certain person in that congregation or something to make a way now we looked at that last week that sometimes there's needs where somebody needs even choosing between a job choosing between what to do that's right right now we are not going to say that that answer is going to come through tongues prophecy or some defined Channel but it was is going to come according to the word and we just want to be sensitive for however the answer comes right I mean you you know it's like I don't have my cell phone up here but my cell phone's active I just got off the phone with brother Aaron I know it's active I still see all the bars up there I see all that you know how it is when you your cell phone you go into certain places and you realize I don't got no signal here right and and you go in there you oh my goodness I need to get out of here I don't have no signal so you get out of there the main thing is is just make sure that you're in range of the tower he's a strong and mighty tower just make sure that if there's anything that's in the way like sometimes in my home if I get if I'm down in the basement or something or whatever more all of that aluminum duck work and everything else it's send things Haywire you have to say hey hold on just a second hey I'll move this over here sometimes the airpods are they get Haywire what you know what you have to do you don't look at the phone and say well the phone's not working you realize I need to get where I can be to hear the reception and that's why you say hold on come on sometimes what it is the tower hasn't moved it's us sometimes that has moved away from the tower because God's still sending Visions FaceTime he's still sending text messages God is still in communication with his [Applause] people amen and amen Prophet said it must be a direct message to the church or or we would think it would be flesh we we see some much of that he said I believe the spirit was to speak only for the edifying of the church now let me let me I want to read here just a uh a few things I wanted to play one here for you but um you know Brian wasn't here tonight and we'll shoot him later with rubber bullets no I I just I didn't want to it's it's a longer message I was going to play for you uh as far as where at the End of the saman Age Maybe what I'll do is just send it to you and you can start and listen because it goes to the end of the message it's about seven minutes long or whatever but there's in that message there's three after brother Braham has preached the samonian church age there's three different sets of tongues interpretations tongues interpretations tongues interpretations and it it comes right back down through and it's speaking so pointedly doesn't call anybody's name but it's speaking so pointedly and the spir and and the prophet said he said now watch how orderly that is has come right after the word that's the first thing it's coming Its Right season and he said notice it was three messages he said and it was calling exactly according to the what the word had come forth and for hearts and he said here stands three Sinners wow Lord and then brother Bram goes on he said did you also hear how it said he said of how that we need to stop the foolishness and he's talking about just little things about our life and and circumcising let the spirit of God circumcised now I want you to notice it wasn't when brother brandham was referring to that this is this is in Jeffersonville this one I'm quoting from so this isn't like he's out in Long Beach or he's down in Clarksville and you say what would that make a difference because brother brandham was a gentleman when he was out even when people interrupted him that's right that's true let me tell you how much a gentlemen I'm not lifting brother bam up I'm talking about the character of even how we should approach these things yes we don't just jump in and well this is of that and this brother bam even when when it jumped in it cut in right in the middle and you hear this multiple times and there's a time where it cuts right in while he's preaching and brother B says oh he says it must be something very very urgent very important for the Holy Spirit to cut into the message like that now you know and I know we've already been through the scriptures enough the spirit of the prophets is subject to the prophets that person was out of order but you see what it was they had not been taught right right and that's what brother brandham would say even when that even when the one sister was jumping up you know each time that an alter call was being made and finally on the second night he told her to sit down and he didn't do that by just a knowledge of the word what he said when he said sit down because what was happening is is she through that was interfering with souls coming to the Altar and when brother Brandon remember he got followed out there to the car and the ministers and he says all the these women were around me oh you you messed up tonight said how do I mess up by staying with the word oh she had something fresh from heaven and and you were finished and brother Bram says I wasn't finished I was giving the altar call Hallelujah the altar call is still part of the word coming forth and he teachs what he said he said look he says I understand he said and for you preachers he spoke to them who came to the car he said the reason this is is because you have your people and he said there will be an accounting for the souls that were missed in this meeting wow you see how important it is absolutely to think about those things you say well brother Samuel with with the blood of Jesus Christ but remember every one of us must appear before the Judgment seat of Christ yes sir yes sir and give account not the white Throne the Judgment seat and give an account for the Deeds Done in the body so I want you this this is why it's so careful it's things that that lady as I said before brother Bram didn't even brother Bram didn't even say you know it was a devil and this that he never said that no as a matter of fact what brother Bram was pointing out he was just dealing with how that was coming out of order in the hindrance of what it was and so when you're looking at times of where a direct message and I you know it's things that we want to just rest upon that part to know that God indeed is direct Direct in what in what he's saying God is direct he doesn't God doesn't have to as I just read that to you out of Jer out of Jehovah Gyra God doesn't have to hem and haul and beat around the bush and you know somebody in here is nervous tonight or somebody's in here God of no no God does God doesn't work that way it's it's got to come direct there's a message that would be given like brother Brandon would say it in in this way let me let me see if I can find one here he says now let me just I I've got it listed here but I want to just read the one he says here in in time evangelism I I read this to you last week but he says Heavenly Father we thank you for this not knowing Tong's interpretation just went forth that someone somewhere that you spoke to a heart somewhere and it called back again even in the closing message it said and it called them your children because you had called to them maybe they had just been fixing to walk away without receiving you and then the message comes again speaking of the tongues interpretations so we pray heavenly father that you will great a grant a great portion of your spirit upon whoever the person may be you never called their name you just spoke it and father maybe that's the way you want it and we just pray father that your your that that your will be granted to this person or these persons whoever they may be that it may be coming down to a final call those messages sometimes speak someone we don't know who they are sometimes they tell who they are but just someone in here that maybe just started to move away without it it's something that registers as brother Bram goes through there's other that I referred to and in the one I wanted to play for you out of the Sumerian age brother brandham has has called that and he said how how the response it was so it was it was not a vain repetition it was not something was vague it was so pointed how the Holy Spirit was speaking and I spoke even it was just it was incredible cuz I'm speaking you know at times you know and and it's it's one of those things even you hear you know other with other pastors and other ministers where things within that way that to me that's not strange that those things would would take place and they would happen in that way but I want us to be able to say it in this way that one thing for sure even in that we want to know that we're hitting the Marken we want to know we're hitting the mark because this notice Let me let me just move on here a little bit it comes by course and mo at most three by course and when it says by course in the scripture here it says let it be two or at the most three and that by course and let one interpret and brother BR says you you even hear him in the message when he's sometimes that tongues has come about and all of a sudden you know the the the people and brother B says just be quiet he said let's let's wait let's be in prayer let's wait for the interpretation to come because he said you can't have you can't have the speaking in tongues and then have another speaking in Tong another speaking tongues he said it by course it's tongues interpreter tongues interpreting tongues interpretation if it's going to be three he says it it it it comes forth in that way you find there was one message I was studying here or looking at here just the other the other evening and brother Bram it just comes in that way and brother Bram says when things happen like that where it was just like rapid of different ones with tongues and then all of a sudden here here interpretation was coming and brother brah is telling us he says when when things happen in that way it's confusion it's confusion now remember what we looked at last week brother brah says when the that gift of interpretation he said when that sets down it's just like that of tongues he said interpretation he said this is what he says questions and answers God being misunderstood and I recommended that message to you if you haven't listened to that message go back and listen I've just been combing through that questions and answers God being misunderstood brother BR says too often interpretation is done out of an extraordinary Expression A Feeling what the spirit wants to say and brother BR says that is wrong he takes us back as we went and looked at it in the scripture the interpretation it can be like we said last week it could be like if if little Aaron here he speaks an Africans I don't know it you know Africans don't you I don't know it but I could tell you if he speaks in it and the gift of interpretation strikes me I don't need to know Africans I will hear it in my own language sir the same God who anoints him or someone else to speak in that language is the same God that will anoint to hear it in my native tongue that is so good I don't have to know how to because this is not a fleshly thing this is the spirit of God right so now when we look at this it's by it's by cour and notice how when the scripture says let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge and if anything be revealed to another that said it by let the first hold his peace for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and may be comforted and notice when we have this brother B says if there was already three messages gone out in unknown tongues in one meeting this is a question if that's already happened brother Brown in the prayer line can there be more messages go out and still be in the spiritual order of the meeting brother Bram goes into this here just stay with me now whatever it is what Paul is speaking of is a message of uh to the congregation out there let it just be by three because the message of God is speaking a message trying to get it over to the congregation so those scriptures I just read are to the congregation but now he's asked the question what about in the prayer lines brother BR says when the man in the prayer line he's prophesying to an individual not the whole if that would be so if if in other words if three messages already gone and you couldn't do it no more I'd be out of order all along in my prayer lines when 30 or 40 of them in a night if you're prophesying to an individual now let me just say it like this that's judged right away prophecy coming forth and it's coming forth somebody coming through a prayer line and these things are mentioned and if someone at that point says that's not true somebody is lying and let me just tell you to you it don't matter how much The Minister's track record could be 10 out of 10 that is no Vindication are you hearing me he's not a prophet we got quiet in here now these are things we're seeing and then what I'm saying is is that when there are things within it well I I I see you know look God works in that way and you see how Satan wants to do sometimes Satan don't want to come and try to discredit things this is why everything has to be judged and if someone comes back and says with their parents hey this wasn't right right there that should be repented of right right either either the person is they're not telling the truth or this person it should it should never be of you you do but you just don't know it that they we don't need that that's right there is genuine yes amen are you hearing me there's genu wine and we're going to take we're going to take everything that God has and we're not going to come into a place and you know go to acting as though Co is all over again and oh oh get away from me you're looking at me I don't want no J we're not going into that with the gifts we don't have to be afraid we have to reverence them and bringing according to the word is that right and nobody nobody's above the word nobody no matter name whatever nobody's above the word you with me you made a prediction and things didn't have come to pass repent and get right and say you know what I had the had the wrong feeling about this or had this get it right BR goes on he says now for ex instance the prayer Line's called and brother Neville or myself or any other minister goes down to this individual that's not to the body that's to this individual and the spirit of God comes upon him to tell this individual tell something now remember brother Neville had had had had a gift of Prophecy with works through his life as well as tongues and that of interpretation and he said cuz he's not speaking to the congregation it's to this individual and brother Brandon remember brother brand made the statement and I read it to you last week out of Gabriel Gabriel's visit to Daniel 70 weeks and brother Bram made that statement of how when he was asked is there going to be any more discernments and he says no he says brother Neville's here with that now and I got some relief you remember that from last week he said I've got some relief he said I can rest when I'm at home now but that working of gift of Prophecy was not something that could just it was not the same as what it was in brother branham's life because when brother branham's life it wasn't a gift of Prophecy it's a Prophet this is why I working that over and over and see this is where sometimes these things I want to say it in this way sometimes things we can become enamored with things sometimes we can become dependent on things this is what brother Brandon was speaking remember his burden and as I was with Moses it's not just that message in 1960 in September but you'll hear it over and over he's because what he's saying is is where the people instead of taking hold of the word of God they're waiting for Brother randam to say something right they're waiting and let's just be honest friend let's just cut to the chase if you and I were there we would have been in the same place the only reason we are where we are right now and God has to give us nudges and Grace is because of the word and the word working and we're seeing it working and moving in our life because to tell you the truth if God hadn't taken his Prophet off the scene this church wouldn't be here probably that's right we'd probably be loading up going to Jeffersonville every weekend or wherever it was at see God knows what he's doing but you see sometimes it can become a dependency we can become dependent on somebody else instead of waiting on God ourselves now God can use a multitude God God can use God can use any of the gifts God can use come right through the ministry of the word God can come right in your prayer closet we we're not putting God in a box but at the same time we we have to understand see notice the whole part of the message of the hour is bringing us to a dependency on the word of God yes sir Hallelujah to where it's like oh no cell phone service is down how am I going to get a contact with this person how am I going to do this I need to know what to do I I need to talk to this person we need to talk to God there's a relationship with God now I I get it we at times you can have confidence but this is what I'm this is what I'm pointing to the dangers of dependency it can get to such a place to where you go to pray for somebody and they're saying is God showing you anything about my life I know what I'm talking about friends that's why I'm dealing with this is God showing you anything about me is God doing this you know what's happening it's builds it can build a dependency and yet people are not intending to do that even what what's the whole point is to recognize who's Among Us are you with me I know when I'm talking about I'm not these are not shots in the dark I know what I'm talking about here another the message Paradox brother says I had to take I had a word from the Lord to take to brother Neville about prophesying over everyone that comes by this altar here God God told him and really called him down about it I think we know the result did he receive the correction he did which showed it was the real spirit of God the whole time don't do that you'll don't watch watch don't do that you'll shove him out in the flesh and then you'll have a false prophet wait a minute you mean it's not brother Neville's fault brother Neville the gift but people are wanting things what is this and they're wanting they're pulling they're pulling and here he is standing prophesying over every single one that's coming by I'm glad this transparency aren't you and you know what as a matter of fact brother bram's on the platform or brother Neville's on the platform well even then that's in Jeffersonville but he's on the platform even when he reads this next one in 1965 brother BR says let him do as the spirit leads him to do don't try to pull nothing out of God cuz you can't do it trying to do God a service without being in his will what a title how I had to catch our own little Pastor here on it out here in the woods one morning about 3:00 in the morning and he said go tell brother Neville I come to you didn't I brother Neville everybody this is what everybody was doing brother Neville prophesy over me tell me this or that he said you see what you'll have him saying things then that wouldn't even come to pass they that wait to find out what the Lord wants to do see if we're not careful then it becomes traveling all around the country to find this one particular person or two people or three people if I can just get to them why would you have to get to a person I know God uses men that is so good but Jesus said lo I am with you you always are you hearing me you hearing me God's God's not taking us backwards in time God's given us his word and building our confidence in who it is that is Among Us and who is it that's in our lives am I saying that God cannot lead somebody and and they go here and go there that's not what I'm saying at all but what I am saying is that don't put anybody as your holy ghost or anybody as your spiritual crutch God did not BR send a message to have people rally around one man or a certain Ministry we are to Rally around the gift of God and the gift of God is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's then brother bam says I preached the biggest name there is the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that was brother Bron's problem with voice of healing he said in there he said they're getting too much about pointing to the man on the testimonies and everything else he said I hear them they're talking too much about the man and I did this and this and that he said they need to be more bragging on the Lord Jesus Christ you said did Brother brandom live that ask those that was with him brother Hoover stood right here his grandma was in the home as as the as the as the you know the one who cared for the children and the one thing that she said she said when brother randam talked about the meetings he spoke of it in third person I happened to be there when I saw him do this and this I seen him do this and this you see to me those are little details that's within that there very key because it's after all it's him that receives the glory amen amen so there's a judging and a qualification method here let me just try to I want to want to hurry but yet I want to move through this and it says let the prophet speak two or three that's that's the interpretation coming from the tongues and let the other judge brother Brown tells us in church order and many other places it just I I I selected out of all of the quotes that I'm going through brother Bram says here must be men or peoples in the building in people who are spiritually solid in gospel Doctrine who has good discernment of spirit that would raise up and say it's of the Lord now brother Brown tells us in Gabriel's same place that I was quoting about brother Neville brother Braham is he's coming back and you know he's wanting to he's been watching things moving and he's wanting to he's wanting to to to put the things into a into a better into a more in order and he keeps on dropping that that that hint all along so he makes this statement and he says regarding the messages this is just one of the ways as it's taken down these messages are proving out to be of God because they are actually not coming out of order they're just set in order now that's one thing they're coming in order now the next thing he says my neighbor Mrs Woods same message who has a microphone hooked up here and a tape back there to take the meeting just purposely to get those messages and write them down and see whether they're right or not that's how she's checking them and I know Mrs Woods to be an honest woman and she's telling me of many things that's been said are coming to pass I I'm drawn to this statement many things because brother bam in a later part of the message he said sometimes only half but he said many things very a gentleman see because eventually we're going we we bring it brother Bram knew where the the Target and the direction was to bring to bring these things to now I want you to think of this here the scripture in Joel chapter 2 it said it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh how many you thankful for the Holy Ghost amen how many you thankful for what it's done in your life life changed you amen this is this is the promise that God made that he would pour it out but we also know and understand that it's poured out upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy that's that that's part of it your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit what's what's the most important thing is that that spirit has made its way down to our soul that's the new birth not just on our spirit not just not just on our our intellect but down to the soul to where it has changed us and we have passed from Death unto life the love of God is what's preeminent in our lives now notice within this the judging and importance and purpose let me just try to to tie this I'm I'm coming down here everybody okay just just a few more moments here because you man look and say well judging well I see it by the scripture what's the importance and what's the purpose like even in we have these microphones hanging through here why why would that be important as I said sometimes there's things it's it's right then and there right during the service and it's known I want you to understand do you think brother bam was putting this in place to have gotcha moments do you think that's what judging was all about like I dare you to to say something wrong I tell you and brother brandham he says it in one place here in the message he says somebody came to me he says when I started instructing in that way and they said H you're putting us too much on the spot and brother Bram says where do you think I'm at every night I'm right on the spot every night every night remember it's the same God working through the prophet and a gift of Prophecy a gift to prophecy is to be judged now brother BR says now before it can be given to the church I want you to listen to this it has to be judged by two or three witnesses that is a man who has discernment of spirit because a lot of times evil Powers gets in there Paul spoke of it but God's power is in there too tell me a congregation where evil doesn't set bwt 1530 Lake Breeze Road you're lying Prophet tells us and remember Job chapter one when the sons of God came together guess who else came Satan said pardon me that's my that's my Pew right there I need to sit down that's my spot this is where I always sat when the sons of God gather so s Satan's not exempt from this meeting but I want to remind you there's more with us the angels of God are right here among us as a matter of fact they have been the ashers here tonight glory be to godo tell me a congregation where evil doesn't set tell me where the sons of God are gathered together that Satan isn't in the midst of them it's everything future home 1964 let the mind that was in Christ be in you let the mind that was in Christ be in you then it isn't your thinking it's his thinking through you and you're not expressing your own words you're expressing his words brother BR remember in the quote I read to you last week he ties that right in to tongues and interpretation what's the next statement that's how many times the Brethren gets confused on interpretation of tongues and things they say things that's not right and they don't realize that that's Satan now what was brother BR what is brother Bram talking about is when there's things that said that's totally contrary remember how many remember when when brother Bram stood there in Chicago Illinois and all them ministers they remember they were setting a trap for him by God had explained and brother B tells us how many of them had made a commitment they were weeping Reaching Across and shaking hands and said they were going to come and be baptized what got in the way tongues interpretation at a later time brother B also tells us of of of also things were individuals things would be stood up oh this tongue's an interpretation took place and it told me told this one I've got the the wrong wife and I'm supposed to have this brother's wife and this brother Ram goes into that yes he does as a matter of fact you might think that is something that's so forign I talked to a man on the phone that called me just two years ago he's just come out of one of the sect the sect you know that's down there beard and things like that came out and he began he called me and he said he said I got your number he said and told me of a situation that had happened very much like that because why they are enamored with the gifts right enamored I said and the situation that he told me it broke my heart you say what did you do took him right to Matthew 24 you got your Bible open up to Matthew 24 I'm not breaking any confidence because you don't know who in the world it is you've never even seen the man don't worry he's never been here you don't even know him but I'm just trying to tell you of these certain things like this that would take place where this is said regarding this and this and that it's confusion and that is against the word of God are you with me that's the obvious that that's the obvious those are things that right here among us as a people of God it it should not and would not be that that is so obvious but notice what the brother Ram says here and you say in the garden of God this could take place in the garden of God remember our protection is the word of God right that's our walls 1964 brother Bram can Satan use the gift of tongues or prophecy in a person who has the Holy Ghost brother BR said that's a good one it must be watched very very close he goes on and says in 1 Corinthians 1429 we find out that any gift in the church has got to be judged first now that's an incredible any gift now does that mean we're walking around with clipboards let me see here that's not what it is at all God has not put this for things to be tightened up where our toes are tightened up in our shoes but it is also for our protection as much as the gifts are such can be such a blessing as God sees fit to use them these can also be some of the things that can cause some of the greatest confusion and hurt I say Lord I just want you to be in control I just just want to just want to be work with that to watch watch very closely watch any gift in the church is got to be judged first you have to watch cause evil spirits slip in remember the rain falls on the just and unjust and the rain that was sent to ripen the weed also ripens the weed the same water God has a law and in this law is the spirit Spirit of life you have to watch because Satan slips in now every time and every spirit is to be judged brother Bram says it like this he says this is where the little breakup that come amongst the Pentecostal people here recently called the latter rain that's where they got off the line right there for when a gift of Prophecy come to a man they declared him to be a prophet that's wrong there's quite a difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet brother BR works with that over and over if you look right into that once again it doesn't matter judging is not based on track records judging is not based on well I don't I tell you I I know I I know that I know that I'm right on because of this this and this and it's all past no we're judging not the past that's the past right now present it's present it's not based on track record see a prophet a prophet it's thus sayeth the Lord a prophet is not judged right the word of God is what lays that out but a spirit a gift of Prophecy is to be judged every other spirit is to be judged so in other words it's not something that even our our faith where our faith is to be built is in God God and even with things as it comes like I said to be judged it's not based on track record I don't care if it's been 10 out of 10 times before this is a new time everybody with me this is this is the word of God is our protection it's things that we look at do we yes do we believe in it yes these things where I'm speaking is to cultivate it is to look at it but at the same time we're not here to run after any of these things these are many of these things as I told as I told shared with you before I've been on my heart for some time with things sometimes I see and and just looking at and and just my heart just being moved and and you see things that that that can be taking place and um but you know what I'm I'm speaking for here of how that we operate here through that of the word God would give us Grace so that there's a place that even as a people we can even refer back to messages taken it right out of the right out of the message and coming through those things and you know what there's more than just tongues and interpretation there's more there's more gifts than that and you know what we want we want all that God has for us we don't have to put him we don't have to put anything in the cause it that's not what judging does let me just tell you friends brother Bram and if somebody feels a little nervous don't worry brother Braham talked about one time when interpretation came to him and he didn't interpret he said it came back back around he said I didn't interpret and he said I didn't interpret and what was coming to me was to tell the pastor to pray for the sick and he said I didn't interpret it the second time he said and all of a sudden I look around I hear a p that Pastor stands up and begins to go praise it thank you Lord because of the seriousness and the reverence this is why that with everything within our lives and our hearts within all of us because the prophet said it can move he said it can move throughout the body we're in the body any one of these gifts can move throughout the body it may have frequency at times with others but it can move throughout the body and this is why it's always in a place as I mentioned I mentioned this to you some Services ago when I talk to the Musicians when I talked to talk to song leaders and so forth one thing I'm always very clear on is make sure your spirit everything is clean don't bring anything in if you listen it should it's not just about playing it's not just about leading songs listen you don't want anything in your heart period because you don't know when your your cards up matter of fact you don't even want to walk into the Church of God with something in your heart against somebody else because you can hinder the Holy Spirit you want to be a vessel that is also that's always available a life that's available for God to move and a character that wouldn't cause someone to question are you hearing me not question question see that's that's a stewardship that every one of us have over our own lives it's a responsibility that we have of our own lives I say oh God help us you love him tonight I hope through I'm off here and there but I I hope it's I hope it's clear and you don't have to say it is if it isn't just but you have a time that don't worry there's things that if you as I told you when I get some uh come to a certain in place that you have questions write them down who knows the answer might come before we we have a questions and answers on this but uh but I want you to uh I want to be able to have that time as I told you last week to do that so let's just let's stand if we could and uh and I trust I trust that there things that no matter because God God has gifts in the body we see things and God has all of that God has placed to help and it has been a help but the ultimate with every confidence and with everything it always comes back to the word of God and that's something that you know I tell you what I thank God if God seen to it and there was a need and I needed a word I needed a direct word that way maybe it was to come through a certain certain manner a certain way I would thank go I thank God for that that God would deliver that word to my heart so I'm not Li we're not limiting God we're not limiting God but neither neither do we just want to just just leave anything just open and just as it go we know that God's given us a word if we operate within that of the word God will lead us right God will Direct us I got confidence in that don't you God will direct us he'll lead us within it that's what that's what's important because listen friends we could have all across this whole church tongues interpretations tongues interpretations and if it doesn't meet that right there then it's been nothing but carnality it's been nothing but things that is just where it it there's no there's no profit to it there's no there's no profit to it these are the things that within it that all of this Lord we we just want to be available and you know what I believe when brother brandham was dealing with some of these things there was such a place that brother Bram could see you know what there's things that sometimes people would go after or chase after or you know why they want to move of God but you know what David wanted a move of God too but go he had to seek it after the due order and you know what it had to be you couldn't bring the word back in a different way the word was meant to be carried over the hearts of the Levites so God's got an order there's a there's a there's a channel for Revival thank God because I just when I stand and I look at the things the prophet says look there I don't I don't believe any person in anyone I don't believe anyone standing here tonight would want anything would chase after everything just to be doing something I believe there's geness in our lives and even our brother Bram could compliment the congregation there I could say the same thing here I I appreciate the reverence I appreciate how God has worked in our midst I thankful for all that God has done and all that he will do as he sees fit and we have need don't you love him amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord we love you this evening we thank you for your mercy Lord in this hour lord it's it's so true without you we can do nothing Lord Lord I I just don't only appreciate the letter of the word I appreciate
