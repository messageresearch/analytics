[41:45] in the name of jesus christ amen
[41:50] amen god bless you this morning amen so
[41:53] good to be in the house of the lord
[41:54] isn't it
[41:56] amen and we want to just go right to the
[41:58] scriptures first john chapter 5
[42:00] and you want to say it's so good to see
[42:03] brother ray
[42:04] amen and before i seen him i heard him
[42:09] and it wasn't because there's
[42:10] microphones piped back there either
[42:13] but it's just so good to be in the house
[42:15] of the lord
[42:16] amen and good to be gathered with his
[42:18] children this morning
[42:21] and i'm just going to ask you to pray
[42:23] for me i've just kind of been between
[42:25] multiple thoughts and
[42:27] which one do i just take and move within
[42:29] this here
[42:31] and just to go either within each one
[42:33] but just
[42:34] feeling the lord just pressing upon this
[42:37] part of it to just come this way this
[42:39] morning and so
[42:40] i just ask you to be in prayer for me i
[42:43] certainly need his prayer and i trust
[42:44] you always are we you're sitting there
[42:46] and pulling on the word you're praying
[42:47] god
[42:48] guide our brother lord just just lord
[42:50] just just
[42:51] direct him lord in the in the pathways
[42:53] of what we have need of
[42:55] amen so let's look here in first john
[42:57] chapter 5 and
[42:59] verse 4. the scripture says
[43:02] for whatsoever is born of god
[43:06] overcometh the world and this is the
[43:08] victory
[43:10] that overcometh the world even
[43:13] our faith who is he
[43:17] that overcometh the world but he that
[43:20] believeth
[43:21] that jesus is the son of god
[43:24] amen if i can read one more scripture
[43:26] first corinthians 12 verse 3
[43:29] if you don't want to turn there they'll
[43:30] put it up there for you
[43:32] wherefore i give you to understand that
[43:34] no man speaking by the spirit of god
[43:37] calleth jesus accursed and that no man
[43:41] can say that
[43:42] jesus is the lord but by
[43:45] the holy ghost amen
[43:49] so we want to just speak here this
[43:50] morning if god will just help us
[43:52] on mastering circumstances
[43:55] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[43:58] of the word as it's being seeded
[44:01] i think that no matter when we take this
[44:03] this thought
[44:05] and as a believer you
[44:08] would recognize even the thought many
[44:10] times in different places of the message
[44:13] of how that brother branham would lay
[44:14] this out over and over of how that faith
[44:18] itself is a master of every circumstance
[44:22] it's to recognize that this is a place
[44:24] that god
[44:25] has called us back to as sons and
[44:27] daughters of god that
[44:29] we would have and walk with a real
[44:32] dominion
[44:33] in this life to have a real authority
[44:36] now that authority is not given to us
[44:39] by church or by a man or
[44:42] anything outside outside of the lord
[44:44] jesus christ
[44:46] that authority comes to us through him
[44:49] and so i want to just look at this here
[44:52] this morning in mastering
[44:53] circumstances because in our lives in
[44:57] our daily journey and then even
[44:59] as god is dealing with the life there
[45:01] are many circumstances
[45:03] many obstacles many things that comes
[45:05] our way
[45:06] and many things that one has to press
[45:09] through
[45:10] and to overcome and so when we
[45:13] look at this sometimes there's
[45:14] circumstances as they come our way that
[45:17] they seem they take us by surprise but
[45:19] not one circumstance has ever taken
[45:22] god by surprise god was not surprised
[45:25] when they came to the red sea
[45:26] god was not surprised when daniel was
[45:29] was placed there in the den of lions god
[45:31] was not surprised when the hebrew
[45:33] children
[45:33] were thrown into the fiery furnace god
[45:35] was not surprised at all
[45:37] the circumstances were were a surprise
[45:40] to those whom it would happen to but in
[45:43] the midst of it
[45:44] there was a mastering of that
[45:47] circumstance
[45:48] and so we want to look at that here just
[45:50] a little just to encourage you in the
[45:53] in the things of the lord here this
[45:54] morning brother branham would say it
[45:56] like this and i want to just just kind
[45:57] of lay this in as a little bit of a
[45:59] background
[46:00] in the in the message perfect faith just
[46:02] taking a few places from there
[46:04] he says perfect faith is a master of all
[46:07] circumstances perfect faith masters all
[46:10] circumstances
[46:12] no matter what it is it masters it
[46:15] when you believe anything do anything
[46:18] and you got
[46:18] faith in what you're doing no matter
[46:20] what the circumstance is
[46:22] that don't have one thing to do with it
[46:26] it masters that circumstance if it's in
[46:28] a room of sickness and the lord's
[46:30] revealed that this certain thing is
[46:31] going to happen
[46:33] you just speak it and go on just don't
[46:35] ask any questions it's already over and
[46:37] you just keep going
[46:39] it masters all circumstances
[46:42] it says well if you do this and so and
[46:44] so is going to do you see it's already
[46:47] got it mastered what are we talking
[46:49] about
[46:50] faith faith already has it mastered
[46:54] faith believes i love this statement
[46:56] faith believes that
[46:58] god will work it out i don't know
[47:01] how he's going to do it but he'll do it
[47:04] anyhow
[47:06] it masters all circumstances so
[47:09] right here alone with just this
[47:11] statement we
[47:12] recognize that faith is not what we can
[47:15] explain but faith is an understanding
[47:20] that god is in control and that god
[47:23] is going to work this out
[47:26] faith is not based on that i know how
[47:28] it's going to happen
[47:30] or every little junction of the moment
[47:32] that's not what faith is
[47:34] faith is looking to a god who made the
[47:36] promise
[47:37] and to know that he cannot fail
[47:41] don't know how he's going to do it but
[47:43] he's going to do it
[47:45] amen so um to master something it means
[47:48] to
[47:49] prevail or to overcome
[47:52] and he said faith and love is relations
[47:54] because
[47:55] you can't have faith unless you've got
[47:57] love
[47:58] because your faith is in a god who is
[48:01] the very
[48:02] essence of love so faith and love it
[48:05] works together
[48:06] and then he moves into here in another a
[48:09] further part and he says
[48:10] no matter what the situation is
[48:13] its circumstances is governed
[48:16] by this love that creates faith what
[48:20] love is he speaking of
[48:21] the love of god that has come sought you
[48:25] out
[48:26] brought you to himself brought you to a
[48:28] place of surrender
[48:30] to where that now god steps down in a
[48:33] very
[48:33] power of transformation and has changed
[48:36] your
[48:37] life into a new creature in christ
[48:40] jesus you're no longer the same person
[48:43] that you used to be
[48:44] it's not you trying to do something
[48:47] trying to live
[48:48] right it's christ in you that has
[48:50] changed your very
[48:51] appetite and desires your love is to him
[48:55] and to his work and that's the love
[48:57] itself that then
[48:58] moves to govern or invite faith
[49:01] to govern every circumstance
[49:05] that god loves you and you love god
[49:09] and you love one another and that
[49:12] brings faith oh he says then it can't
[49:15] keep from bringing it out
[49:17] just exactly what god promised it would
[49:19] do
[49:20] in galatians 5 6 the bible tells us for
[49:23] in jesus christ
[49:24] neither circumcision availeth anything
[49:27] nor
[49:27] uncircumcision but faith which worketh
[49:31] by love so faith as we just
[49:34] just declared that faith operates by
[49:38] love faith is a confidence but what
[49:41] brings that confidence
[49:42] is the very love of god moving
[49:46] and operating in our life you realize
[49:48] that for any promise
[49:49] and whatever that you would have need of
[49:51] it must be the love of god that would
[49:53] pulsate to you
[49:55] to even be able to move in upon that
[49:57] promise you might be even outside of the
[49:59] economy of god
[50:00] this morning but it takes the love of
[50:02] god to be manifested to you
[50:05] and to recognize of what he already has
[50:08] done for you
[50:09] he already followed you before the
[50:11] foundation of the world
[50:12] and that love when that love can so grip
[50:14] and take a hold of a person's life
[50:17] brother there's a surrendering that
[50:18] takes place there is not such a thing as
[50:21] i'm gonna lay this down
[50:22] quickly those things are cast aside
[50:25] because the love of god
[50:27] it brawls draws upon that heart and
[50:29] brings them into a place
[50:31] of a real union with almighty god and
[50:34] then
[50:34] their faith it operates it works
[50:38] by love now i want you just to think of
[50:41] this here
[50:42] brother brahman says you know he says
[50:44] i've been a christian you know over 20
[50:45] years i
[50:46] i believe there was a god just as real
[50:48] as that light is on my hand
[50:50] and there's there's power of god in this
[50:53] room tonight
[50:54] to heal every sick person in here
[50:57] open every blinded eye and stop every
[51:00] deaf ear
[51:01] make every lame man leap like a heart
[51:04] save every sinner
[51:06] sanctify and fill with the holy ghost to
[51:08] every believer
[51:09] he's here just as real as he can be
[51:12] now if you can just find the wire that
[51:15] carries
[51:15] the current to you now all down through
[51:18] the ages the believers
[51:20] have believed the promises of god i'm
[51:23] talking about the overcomers
[51:25] but god in this hour he was not going to
[51:28] let there
[51:28] just be a rumor of the supernatural he
[51:31] was not just going to let it be a rumor
[51:34] that would exist because
[51:35] in a rumor you can't have confidence you
[51:37] know it's like there can be a rumor in
[51:39] the workplace hey we hear they're gonna
[51:41] do this
[51:41] or we hear where they're gonna do this
[51:43] and a lot of those things are just
[51:44] nothing
[51:45] but mere rumors rumors are drawn
[51:48] upon other people's hearing of this oh
[51:51] i've seen this and they draw this
[51:53] conclusion
[51:54] but you can't have faith upon a rumor
[51:57] [Applause]
[51:58] but so god in this hour for the church
[52:01] of the living god
[52:02] that you and i were not walking under a
[52:05] rumor
[52:06] of the supernatural but god in himself
[52:09] would make himself known
[52:11] through his provided channel in this
[52:14] hour
[52:14] when god would keep his word he would
[52:16] send a prophet in this hour
[52:18] according to his word and it would
[52:20] declare to us that that other dimension
[52:23] that's right here with us remember
[52:25] elijah
[52:26] did not bring the angels down he only
[52:29] prayed and asked god
[52:30] opened the eyes of geheza that he might
[52:34] see
[52:35] that he is here already and this is why
[52:37] brother brown could say
[52:39] the purpose of my ministry is to declare
[52:42] that he is here
[52:46] and that now listen has just as much as
[52:48] that was
[52:49] within the prophet's ministry to declare
[52:51] that he is here
[52:53] there is a bride that has come under
[52:55] that declaration
[52:57] and has been united with that word and
[52:59] your life declares
[53:01] he is alive and well is the same power
[53:05] same authority everything he is the same
[53:09] your life has become a channel in this
[53:12] hour the word itself has been sown over
[53:15] this generation
[53:17] and this is the crop that the word
[53:19] itself
[53:20] has produced lives that are yielded to
[53:23] the power of almighty god
[53:25] to declare he's the same yesterday today
[53:28] and forever
[53:31] hallelujah a wire that the current could
[53:34] come to you
[53:36] oh my i love this statement here in the
[53:39] 20 years
[53:40] of research of the bible and talking
[53:43] with the angel of the lord
[53:45] how many can say that he we won that bob
[53:49] jones or whatever more
[53:50] all reading in the bible and talking
[53:53] with the angel of the lord
[53:54] who was it that came there in the room
[53:57] ties service after service
[53:59] when he was studying there for the seals
[54:01] who was it that came in the room
[54:02] the angel of the lord over and over this
[54:06] message is not the thoughts
[54:07] of william branham this message is the
[54:10] thoughts of
[54:10] almighty god that's been expressed in
[54:13] this generation
[54:16] hallelujah no wonder brother bannon
[54:18] could stand there in mighty god unveil
[54:20] before us
[54:21] and he said to think tonight the
[54:23] expressed
[54:24] thoughts of jehovah the message of
[54:27] the hour
[54:31] i'm talking he says and talking with the
[54:33] angel the lord and many things
[54:35] i find here is two things that is
[54:38] love and faith if you love god
[54:41] just purely unadulterated love
[54:44] you've got to have faith in him it'll
[54:48] accompany faith every time
[54:50] and when you love when you when love and
[54:52] faith gets
[54:53] married you ask what you want to and
[54:56] you'll have it you'll see unadulterated
[55:00] love love that's not it's not divided
[55:04] but love that is seated there in the
[55:06] innermost part
[55:08] of that life the love of god has been
[55:10] shed abroad
[55:12] in your heart and there's a there's an
[55:13] unadulterated love
[55:15] it's a love that won't mix it's a love
[55:17] that cannot be
[55:18] broken it's a love that no matter the
[55:20] test or trials or
[55:21] whatever that comes your way there is no
[55:24] pressure no circumstance
[55:26] nothing present nor nothing to come that
[55:28] can ever
[55:29] separate you from the love of god
[55:34] hallelujah and that i'm persuaded of
[55:39] when you know that your heavenly father
[55:42] cannot tell you a lie
[55:43] he's god he can't lie and when you
[55:46] believe him with all your heart and you
[55:48] believe that what you asked for
[55:50] you ask it not for a selfish motive but
[55:52] your
[55:53] right motive behind there is asking it
[55:56] for the glory of god
[55:57] and believe without a shadow of doubt
[56:00] that your father wouldn't lie to you
[56:02] something's going to take place when you
[56:05] get all the cockle burrows out of the
[56:06] way
[56:07] and just look straight there to calvary
[56:09] and believe it with all your heart
[56:13] amen getting all the cocker barrels out
[56:16] of the way

[56:23] charge you
[56:24] try to accuse you he'll try to say
[56:26] everything he can
[56:27] but you've got to clear those cocker
[56:29] barrels out of the way
[56:31] you gotta you got to reject it you got
[56:33] to turn it down listen
[56:34] even satan would sit there on a person's
[56:37] shoulder
[56:38] and tell them the holy ghost ain't for
[56:40] you god will
[56:41] never tell anybody that but the holy
[56:43] spirit will
[56:44] always draw his children to himself

[56:50] who made the promise
[56:51] whether it's healing deliverance
[56:53] whatever it might be he's here to
[56:55] energize us
[56:56] in his promises
[56:59] oh my get all the cocker bros out of the
[57:02] way
[57:03] sometimes sometimes that's some real
[57:05] work right there
[57:07] getting all the cocker bros out of the
[57:09] way getting all the thoughts and
[57:11] everything
[57:12] else out of the way is that right a lot
[57:15] of things can come around
[57:16] our way in the midst of a circumstance
[57:19] i'm not just talking about what we're
[57:21] saying here but
[57:22] sometimes even what we're saying here
[57:24] there might we can feel
[57:25] different pressures and things coming
[57:27] around us but we're standing there upon
[57:29] that word
[57:29] and we're speaking that word we're
[57:31] standing behind that word
[57:33] we're laying hold upon that word no
[57:35] matter how i
[57:36] feel no matter of what type of darkness
[57:39] might try to come around i don't care
[57:41] how much darkness
[57:43] it can try to come upon light darkness
[57:45] can't put out light
[57:48] it cannot put out light light itself is
[57:51] an overcomer
[57:52] against darkness
[57:56] it doesn't matter all the dark faults
[57:58] and everything else that can come your
[57:59] way let me tell you something
[58:01] you think the enemy's just going to step
[58:03] back when a situation rises
[58:05] you think he's just going to stand back
[58:07] and not try to be there to try to
[58:08] whisper
[58:09] and come around in your way sure he's
[58:11] going to be there to do that
[58:13] but that's an opportunity to stand right
[58:15] there on your god-given ground and say
[58:18] i know in whom i have believed and i'm
[58:20] persuaded that
[58:22] he is able to keep that which i've
[58:24] committed unto him
[58:25] against that day is to stand there upon
[58:28] that word
[58:29] and let the light press back the
[58:30] darkness
[58:31] [Applause]
[58:34] hallelujah let me remind you you were
[58:37] sometimes
[58:38] darkness you weren't just in it
[58:41] we were darkness but there was a part on
[58:45] the inside
[58:48] hallelujah it was a redeemable seed
[58:51] a redeemable wick of almighty god
[58:54] and god himself came by the power of his
[58:58] spirit
[58:58] and he brought light into her life
[59:02] amen and that light itself brother it
[59:04] cannot be put out
[59:06] but that light it begins to press out it
[59:09] presses
[59:09] every bit of darkness out of the life
[59:15] hallelujah you now are light in the lord
[59:20] hallelujah jesus said ye are the light
[59:23] of the world is that right the scripture
[59:27] said
[59:27] yeah though i walk through the valley of
[59:29] the shadow of death
[59:30] i will fear no evil he didn't say the
[59:33] dark dark valley
[59:34] that that's somebody's aaron
[59:35] interpretation but it says the valley of
[59:38] the shadow of death
[59:39] in order for there to be a shadow there
[59:41] must be light
[59:42] presence and light is what shows the way
[59:46] that same light that comes there when a
[59:48] saint is crossing from
[59:50] this dimension into that dimension is
[59:52] the same light of god
[59:54] that came and shot you out and brought a
[59:56] real revelation
[59:58] in your heart it's the same light that
[1:00:00] lit you up and
[1:00:01] change your whole countenance from that
[1:00:03] of darkness to now
[1:00:05] light in the lord
[1:00:09] so i summarize and put all that together
[1:00:11] is to cast
[1:00:12] down every thought of darkness
[1:00:16] what's every thought of darkness
[1:00:18] anything that exalts itself
[1:00:20] against the knowledge of god anything
[1:00:23] that rises its tongue
[1:00:25] in judgment against god's word
[1:00:28] and let me just let you know you and the
[1:00:30] word are not two separate things
[1:00:34] there's been a united with jesus christ
[1:00:38] when the baptism of the holy ghost has
[1:00:40] come that's the word
[1:00:42] of god made flesh inside of your life
[1:00:46] amen that's the standard that god
[1:00:48] promised in this hour when the enemy
[1:00:50] comes in like a flood
[1:00:51] i the lord will rise a standard against
[1:00:54] it
[1:00:54] his standard is not outside the body his
[1:00:57] standard
[1:00:58] is himself the word inside of the body
[1:01:02] amen amen amen hallelujah
[1:01:07] oh glory glory glory oh my
[1:01:10] i just can't preach for preaching
[1:01:15] let me lay this in here a little bit you
[1:01:17] see
[1:01:18] paul would speak about faith
[1:01:21] and paul would talk about and he would
[1:01:24] speak in verse nine you see
[1:01:26] it's to give the people a perfect
[1:01:28] confidence the only place
[1:01:29] faith can rest is in the word of god
[1:01:33] i love how brother graham says that in
[1:01:34] third exodus he said faith
[1:01:37] finds its place in the word of god and
[1:01:40] it worships
[1:01:41] in the temple of god's word faith
[1:01:44] worships there
[1:01:45] in the temple of god's word it's a place
[1:01:48] where a promise
[1:01:49] has been made real to you and you can
[1:01:51] stand right there
[1:01:53] in that place and worship god it's
[1:01:55] finished it's over there might be aches
[1:01:57] and pains and
[1:01:58] everything else that's still on doctor's
[1:02:00] reports but it's finished
[1:02:02] in the presence of god the holy spirit
[1:02:05] is the
[1:02:06] final court of appeal and it is spoken
[1:02:09] it is finished
[1:02:13] hallelujah and this is what paul
[1:02:16] is expressing a confidence where the
[1:02:19] church of the living god
[1:02:20] has their faith placed in the word of
[1:02:23] god
[1:02:24] and he says in verse 9 to make all men
[1:02:26] see what is the
[1:02:27] fellowship the joint participation of
[1:02:29] the mystery
[1:02:30] which from the beginning of the world
[1:02:32] had been hid in god who created all
[1:02:34] things by jesus christ
[1:02:36] to the intent that now unto the
[1:02:39] principalities and powers
[1:02:41] in heavenly places might be known by the
[1:02:43] church
[1:02:44] the manifold wisdom of god according to
[1:02:47] the eternal
[1:02:48] purpose which he purposed in christ
[1:02:50] jesus our lord
[1:02:52] i don't care how many devils they can
[1:02:54] line up you can't
[1:02:56] stop the purpose of god
[1:03:00] satan tried to burn them up he tried to
[1:03:02] stop them
[1:03:03] tried to feed them to lions but you
[1:03:05] can't stop
[1:03:06] that life some were delivered
[1:03:11] and others their testimony as they stood
[1:03:14] there
[1:03:14] and fire consumed them the lions ripped
[1:03:17] them apart
[1:03:17] but you could not destroy that life
[1:03:20] brother
[1:03:21] they had already passed from death unto
[1:03:24] life they stood there in the midst of
[1:03:27] that time
[1:03:28] like polycarp he ain't never done me
[1:03:30] nothing but good
[1:03:31] and polycarp himself would stand there
[1:03:34] and say
[1:03:34] you don't need to tie me up he said you
[1:03:37] don't need to do that
[1:03:38] i will gladly stand right here and as
[1:03:41] polycarp
[1:03:42] was walking there there was a voice out
[1:03:44] of heaven
[1:03:45] that spoke to polycarp play the man
[1:03:48] polycarp play the man be of courage
[1:03:52] in this hour
[1:03:56] oh god then lost track of you
[1:03:59] god ain't lost track of you he knows
[1:04:01] exactly where you are
[1:04:03] knows exactly what you're going through
[1:04:05] knows exactly the circumstances
[1:04:07] the same god that was in control of all
[1:04:10] the rest of them and watching over
[1:04:12] and was there to minister to their life
[1:04:14] is the same god
[1:04:15] that's watching over your life and to
[1:04:17] minister to you and me
[1:04:19] even throughout all of our tests and
[1:04:20] trials and afflictions he's the same god
[1:04:27] according to the eternal purpose which
[1:04:29] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[1:04:32] in whom we have boldness
[1:04:35] in whom see in him we have boldness and
[1:04:39] excess and access with confidence
[1:04:41] by the faith of him this is not my faith
[1:04:44] it's his faith it's his faith
[1:04:48] that moves our faith are you with me
[1:04:52] our faith alone is not enough it'll give
[1:04:54] out
[1:04:56] but his faith there is no giving out
[1:05:00] we could look all the way down through
[1:05:01] the time in the building of the
[1:05:03] masterpiece here you have a noah here
[1:05:05] you have an abraham
[1:05:06] but the faith of god could not give out
[1:05:09] the faith of god is there to perform and
[1:05:12] bring to pass his word
[1:05:14] even when sarah as we looked at last
[1:05:16] week she and herself
[1:05:18] she could not see it within her but she
[1:05:20] received
[1:05:21] of the angel's visitation receive
[1:05:24] strength
[1:05:24] into her life to be changed and conceive
[1:05:28] the seed of the word of promise and
[1:05:30] bring forth isaac
[1:05:32] who was it it was god's work
[1:05:37] hallelujah you love him
[1:05:42] you keep praying and i'll keep preaching
[1:05:45] in whom we have boldness and access with
[1:05:48] confidence
[1:05:49] by the faith of him this is a real
[1:05:53] confidence
[1:05:55] that christ ephesians 3 17 that christ
[1:05:59] may dwell in your hearts by faith that
[1:06:02] ye being rooted
[1:06:03] and grounded in love galatians 2 20
[1:06:07] i am crucified with christ this is where
[1:06:09] confidence comes from
[1:06:11] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[1:06:14] i live yet not i but christ
[1:06:18] liveth in me and the life
[1:06:21] which i now live in the flesh
[1:06:25] there was a life a different life he
[1:06:26] lived at one time
[1:06:28] but the life which i now live in the
[1:06:30] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[1:06:33] god
[1:06:33] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:06:37] so this is the faith that jude wrote
[1:06:40] about
[1:06:41] under inspiration let us contend for the
[1:06:44] faith that was once delivered unto the
[1:06:47] saints
[1:06:48] is that right that faith is the love of
[1:06:50] god
[1:06:51] it is the real true personal experience
[1:06:54] of the baptism of the holy ghost being
[1:06:57] enthroned in the life of the believer
[1:06:59] this is the faith that we contend for
[1:07:02] this is the faith that we are born of
[1:07:04] this
[1:07:05] is the faith that overcometh the world
[1:07:10] hallelujah oh my the same faith
[1:07:14] that was there that god dwell alone
[1:07:17] and in his mind and god could step and
[1:07:20] speak his word
[1:07:21] and when he spoke his word he believed
[1:07:24] his word
[1:07:24] his word would come to pass he would
[1:07:27] bring it to pass
[1:07:28] that same faith what was once in god's
[1:07:31] mind
[1:07:31] is now in the heart of the believer
[1:07:37] what is it that same faith it's a faith
[1:07:41] in the word of god that's unadulterated
[1:07:43] of faith that stands there and says
[1:07:45] that though in myself i may not feel
[1:07:48] worthy but i'm not worthy based on
[1:07:50] my worthiness i am made worthy by the
[1:07:53] blood
[1:07:54] of the lamb
[1:07:57] what are you doing poking holes in those
[1:08:00] thoughts of darkness
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:03] hallelujah cast them off
[1:08:09] this is why when brother branham would
[1:08:11] he would take this fault i'm going to
[1:08:12] read this here in just a minute
[1:08:13] but recognizing of how that god would
[1:08:16] bring through
[1:08:18] there the water the blood and the spirit
[1:08:21] all three
[1:08:21] that are needed even in natural birth it
[1:08:24] comes
[1:08:25] but even here in the spiritual birth
[1:08:28] there must be that
[1:08:29] of the water the blood and the spirit
[1:08:33] it all comes together to make a complete
[1:08:35] birth
[1:08:36] water alone just just a justified life
[1:08:39] though it's wonderful
[1:08:40] to know and to recognize you come to a
[1:08:42] place of repentance
[1:08:44] and to recognize the lord jesus christ
[1:08:46] as your lord and savior
[1:08:47] and you're convicted of the wrong you're
[1:08:49] convicted of your life and you realize
[1:08:51] there is this one the living god that's
[1:08:54] convicting my life i want to serve him
[1:08:56] i want to turn my life over to him
[1:08:58] that's what the preaching of the word or
[1:09:01] the waters of separation it does
[1:09:04] it brings the sinner or the individual
[1:09:06] to a recognition
[1:09:08] that there is one who can take care of
[1:09:10] the sin
[1:09:11] question in your life you're not
[1:09:13] hopeless you're not without a hope
[1:09:16] there's a god who can come down and deal
[1:09:18] with the question in your
[1:09:20] life hallelujah
[1:09:23] and the blood comes forth that blood and
[1:09:26] how that it was applied
[1:09:28] it's a blood that then cries out that
[1:09:30] there
[1:09:31] is a sanctification of that of a power
[1:09:34] within that blood
[1:09:35] that can actually break the very hold of
[1:09:38] sin
[1:09:39] upon a life of all of the cleansing and
[1:09:41] taking out
[1:09:42] all the things of the world and make way
[1:09:44] for what for the very life
[1:09:46] of almighty god to come on the inside
[1:09:49] and that life is
[1:09:50] nothing less than the seed word may
[1:09:52] manifest
[1:09:53] it's nothing less than god himself
[1:09:56] imparting a part
[1:09:58] of himself which was that inheritance
[1:10:00] that belonged to you
[1:10:01] before the foundation of the world and
[1:10:04] god himself is not giving you something
[1:10:06] that doesn't belong to you when you've
[1:10:08] asked god for the holy ghost
[1:10:10] you're not asking him for something that
[1:10:12] doesn't belong to you
[1:10:14] you're asking him for your inheritance
[1:10:17] my part in you lord
[1:10:21] and it's him that inspires you
[1:10:24] to ask for it
[1:10:34] hallelujah and then when that happens
[1:10:37] i know this is a simple one i'm going to
[1:10:38] read but i'm going to read it anyhow
[1:10:41] he says then he says he says
[1:10:44] you get acquainted with god and you'll
[1:10:47] see his great move
[1:10:49] in nature you'll see him in the sunsets
[1:10:54] in the flowers in everywhere you can see
[1:10:58] him all around you
[1:10:59] because he's all around you that gives
[1:11:02] you perfect confidence
[1:11:04] that you're in love with him
[1:11:08] i'm just going to preach as it comes
[1:11:11] there's certain things
[1:11:12] that you know brother aaron you and i
[1:11:13] might be out of store and i could look
[1:11:14] at now i may not tell you but i could
[1:11:16] look at and think my wife would like
[1:11:17] that
[1:11:19] or i could tell you you know what she
[1:11:21] wouldn't like that
[1:11:22] she could also tell you right now
[1:11:24] somebody say oh brother samuel like this
[1:11:26] now she may not want to hurt your
[1:11:27] feelings but
[1:11:27] she know he won't like that i know him
[1:11:31] is that right right because you know him
[1:11:34] we know him is that right you're so in
[1:11:37] love with him to
[1:11:38] ask brother baby saying in nature you
[1:11:40] can't help but see
[1:11:41] god there's things that you see around
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:44] god speaks to your heart oh my there's
[1:11:47] things that
[1:11:48] here you can get to looking at some
[1:11:49] things i think about when i was teaching
[1:11:51] school you know
[1:11:52] and i'd be teaching there about seed and
[1:11:54] you know germination and
[1:11:56] going through that there was a couple
[1:11:57] times where an amen just slipped loose
[1:11:59] right in the classroom
[1:12:00] oh my there were things you know i
[1:12:02] remember when i would go i had to do a
[1:12:04] basic art class you know that
[1:12:06] that everybody had to do kind of for
[1:12:08] whatever degree they're going into
[1:12:09] and i would you know that god had just
[1:12:11] got a hold of my life and man i was i
[1:12:13] was
[1:12:13] my drawings and things like that i
[1:12:14] thought well i ain't much of an artist
[1:12:16] so i'm just going to paint
[1:12:17] the things that to me you know that that
[1:12:19] really inspire me now they believe me
[1:12:20] there weren't no drawings that anybody
[1:12:22] would have
[1:12:22] bid on or nothing like that
[1:12:23] kindergartners won't even bid on them
[1:12:25] but i had you know pyramids and
[1:12:27] capstones and seeds and
[1:12:28] everything else and when they would ask
[1:12:30] me now sam what does all of this mean
[1:12:31] right here
[1:12:32] and i could stand right there within
[1:12:34] that art class and begin to speak about
[1:12:36] coming to maturity a seed that is
[1:12:38] planted in faith now look i wasn't
[1:12:39] preaching to them but yet without the
[1:12:41] scriptures yet
[1:12:42] i was letting them know certain things
[1:12:44] this is what it meant to me
[1:12:46] oh my wasn't it different when god got a
[1:12:49] hold of your life
[1:12:50] like brother brown said the birds sing
[1:12:52] different there's
[1:12:53] things that stood out differently after
[1:12:55] god got a hold of your life
[1:12:57] oh brother it's something about it
[1:12:59] you're so in love with him
[1:13:01] like it is to your spouse you would say
[1:13:03] he like that oh i see god right there
[1:13:05] i see god right there it's just like you
[1:13:07] know your spouse and your spouse knows
[1:13:09] you
[1:13:10] and say boy they like that man they like
[1:13:12] this they like that that's because
[1:13:14] you are in love
[1:13:19] that gives you perfect confidence that
[1:13:20] you're in love with him you're
[1:13:22] you're you're he's in love with you he
[1:13:25] loved you predestinated you for ordained
[1:13:28] you

[1:13:33] hamburger but just take it in
[1:13:35] really digest it he loved you
[1:13:37] predestinated you
[1:13:39] for ordained you before the foundation
[1:13:41] before the world began
[1:13:43] and has brought you here saved you
[1:13:46] cleansed you up and filled you with the
[1:13:49] his spirit
[1:13:50] how could you doubt that gives you
[1:13:54] a perfect setting of faith
[1:14:00] you know what any good story has a
[1:14:02] setting
[1:14:03] is that right there's a setting where
[1:14:05] things take place
[1:14:06] and there's a setting where believers
[1:14:09] manifest
[1:14:10] as sons and daughters of god there is a
[1:14:13] setting there is a place
[1:14:15] in christ this is where all spiritual
[1:14:18] blessings are at it's in christ this
[1:14:20] gives a perfect setting that gives you
[1:14:24] a perfect setting of faith when you know
[1:14:27] those things
[1:14:28] that gives you courage oh my
[1:14:31] you know where you're standing
[1:14:35] well what's this perfect setting here of
[1:14:37] faith here as paul would say
[1:14:39] in romans 8 there is therefore now no
[1:14:41] condemnation to them
[1:14:43] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[1:14:47] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:14:49] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:14:52] christ jesus
[1:14:53] hath made me free from the law of sin
[1:14:56] and death
[1:14:56] to me made free from it is you have been
[1:14:59] set
[1:15:00] at liberty you and i were enclosed we
[1:15:03] were in bondage
[1:15:05] under that first birth oh there was a
[1:15:07] desire that was there
[1:15:08] a desire you know there was things about
[1:15:10] us that you couldn't fit in
[1:15:12] there were things and how god would even
[1:15:14] begin to deal with our life there was a
[1:15:15] desire
[1:15:16] that was there on the inside but it was
[1:15:18] housed in or closed off
[1:15:20] from actually coming into a full
[1:15:23] expression
[1:15:24] with him but because and through and by
[1:15:27] his redemptive work in our life the
[1:15:30] surrender
[1:15:31] the submissive how the spirit of god
[1:15:33] would move us into that place
[1:15:34] we are no longer tied to that old man as
[1:15:37] a matter of fact
[1:15:38] the old man doesn't live here when
[1:15:40] there's deliveries of mail and
[1:15:41] everything else that would want to come
[1:15:43] to that address
[1:15:44] you can stand there with a clear
[1:15:46] assurance
[1:15:47] there is no condemnation the man that
[1:15:50] used to do those things
[1:15:52] and love those things he don't live here
[1:15:55] no
[1:15:55] more rts return to satan
[1:16:02] amen there's no condemnation
[1:16:07] because when you look back you know
[1:16:10] when i was back there there's been no
[1:16:12] continuance on that
[1:16:14] here is that right
[1:16:17] you can see it in your own life it's a
[1:16:20] liberty that's come
[1:16:21] inside of you it's not well if i can
[1:16:23] just do this if i can just hold on here
[1:16:24] no it's a liberty
[1:16:25] that comes inside here that's what the
[1:16:27] real baptism of the holy ghost does
[1:16:30] it brings a liberty in your life a joy
[1:16:33] with the word of god
[1:16:35] oh my you see this is why as brother
[1:16:37] brandon would put it in this way
[1:16:39] of conquering and he would speak of what
[1:16:41] conquering itself
[1:16:43] how faith is a victory and what it means
[1:16:44] to conquer conqueror means that you have
[1:16:47] whipped it you have overcome it
[1:16:51] you've beat it down you put it in
[1:16:54] handcuffs
[1:16:56] i got to read some of this here it means
[1:16:58] that the sin
[1:16:59] that once ruled you you rule it
[1:17:03] now it means you've overcome it you've
[1:17:06] whipped it
[1:17:07] you're greater than it is now brother
[1:17:09] man asks very simple questions
[1:17:10] he said what was first a savior or a
[1:17:14] sinner
[1:17:17] savior sinner
[1:17:20] come after but a savior was first so
[1:17:23] which one's greater
[1:17:24] a savior what was first
[1:17:27] healer or sickness healer
[1:17:30] so which one's greater healer is that
[1:17:33] right
[1:17:34] so then how that god himself will
[1:17:36] manifest himself
[1:17:38] to the believer through the believer
[1:17:40] that he is the greater one
[1:17:42] he's greater than sin he's greater than
[1:17:46] sickness he's greater than disease
[1:17:48] because he
[1:17:50] was before all things and by
[1:17:53] him all things consists that ah
[1:17:56] who are we talking about we're talking
[1:17:58] about the lord jesus christ
[1:18:02] is that right and him dwelling within
[1:18:04] that life
[1:18:05] he is before all things he is the
[1:18:08] eternal one
[1:18:09] is that right and that eternal life in
[1:18:12] you
[1:18:13] works in you because the seed of god was
[1:18:16] laying within you the whole time
[1:18:18] as part of the eternal
[1:18:22] oh my brother brown would say it like
[1:18:24] this i'm just trying to get somewhere
[1:18:27] he said when you know that jesus died
[1:18:29] for your sins
[1:18:30] and you've accepted him as your savior
[1:18:32] and you've got the holy ghost
[1:18:34] and by his stripes you were healed if
[1:18:37] you know
[1:18:38] that truth that truth
[1:18:41] alone makes you free
[1:18:44] amen no need of prayer
[1:18:48] it's not praying it's just believing
[1:18:51] believing the truth
[1:18:54] now i'm going to read all this quote
[1:18:56] sometimes
[1:18:58] we have to pray to bring that truth to
[1:19:01] our hearts
[1:19:05] that truth alone makes you free
[1:19:09] but sometimes we have to pray to bring
[1:19:12] that faith
[1:19:13] close to our hearts is that right
[1:19:16] because sometimes i'm sorry i know not
[1:19:18] everybody's an angel
[1:19:19] but just to understand that there's
[1:19:21] sometimes we get a little weak
[1:19:24] sometimes we need a little encouragement
[1:19:26] sometimes we need to hear a testimony
[1:19:29] sometimes we need to hear of what god
[1:19:31] did for somebody else
[1:19:33] sometimes we need to hear those things
[1:19:35] brother and let me just say
[1:19:36] not just sometimes we need to talk of
[1:19:39] all of his doings
[1:19:40] we need to lift him up and exalt him
[1:19:43] that he's still
[1:19:43] god in the midst of his people he's
[1:19:46] still
[1:19:47] god in the calf of his children
[1:19:51] sometimes our faith needs strengthened
[1:19:56] amen glory be to god
[1:20:00] oh my so i'm gonna preach here this
[1:20:02] sometimes we have to pray
[1:20:04] we have to pray to bring that truth to
[1:20:06] our hearts
[1:20:07] but god gives us every inch of material
[1:20:10] that there
[1:20:11] is of the kingdom of god to work with i
[1:20:14] got to go back on this
[1:20:15] sometimes we have to pray to bring that
[1:20:17] truth to our hearts
[1:20:18] what truth that truth alone makes you
[1:20:21] free
[1:20:22] brother you're not coming back to a it's
[1:20:24] not something of a different truth
[1:20:25] but every time where faith is pulsating
[1:20:28] in your heart
[1:20:29] it's coming back to that truth alone and
[1:20:31] that
[1:20:32] truth is what has made you free
[1:20:36] amen sometimes you get to looking out
[1:20:38] here or you're looking at this
[1:20:40] but remember your authority isn't out
[1:20:42] here looking at this
[1:20:43] but your authority is looking away to
[1:20:46] jesus
[1:20:46] and he's not far off but he's right
[1:20:49] there dwelling inside of your life
[1:20:52] amen no man speaketh by the spirit
[1:20:55] called jesus accursed
[1:21:00] but only amanda called jesus
[1:21:03] the lord by the holy ghost he's the lord
[1:21:06] of my life
[1:21:07] he's the ruler in my life he's supreme
[1:21:09] deity in my life
[1:21:10] he's in control in my life he is the
[1:21:13] chief influence
[1:21:14] in my life he is my life
[1:21:18] oh my brother samuel what are you doing
[1:21:20] i'm rehearsing that truth alone that has
[1:21:22] made me free
[1:21:26] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:21:29] if you know that truth oh my i don't
[1:21:31] seem like i can get out of this one
[1:21:33] sometimes we have to pray to bring that
[1:21:35] truth to our hearts but
[1:21:36] god gives us every inch of material that
[1:21:39] there is of the kingdom of god to work
[1:21:41] with aren't you glad for that
[1:21:43] to bring faith to the people gifts signs
[1:21:47] wonders everything to do it
[1:21:48] but when he does it it's a finished work
[1:21:51] when he does it to you and you believe
[1:21:52] it and accept it
[1:21:53] then your healing is that's all just all
[1:21:55] there is to it you have to believe
[1:21:57] the word of god in luke 17 5 here
[1:22:00] the the apostles as they speak to the
[1:22:02] lord jesus they said
[1:22:04] increase our faith that word increase
[1:22:07] right there you know to me i appreciate
[1:22:09] how they had enough humility to say you
[1:22:11] know what
[1:22:12] increase our faith amen i want to have
[1:22:15] enough humility
[1:22:16] you see because the enemy is always busy
[1:22:18] trying to tell you you don't have no
[1:22:20] faith you don't have enough faith
[1:22:21] you don't have this and you don't have
[1:22:23] that but i want to be able just to stand
[1:22:24] there and say lord
[1:22:25] increase my faith
[1:22:30] oh my you see the real revelation of
[1:22:32] this truth does not make us arrogant
[1:22:34] does not make us puffed up does not make
[1:22:36] us in a place to where man i've got
[1:22:38] everything all together no
[1:22:40] it puts us in a place to realize we are
[1:22:42] nothing without him
[1:22:44] we can do nothing without him and
[1:22:46] sometimes god
[1:22:47] will permit circumstances to come our
[1:22:49] life we will pray
[1:22:50] we'll pray write request after request
[1:22:53] and it seems like
[1:22:54] nothing is moving at all but it's a
[1:22:57] trying
[1:22:58] that's going on a trying of our faith a
[1:23:01] trying in the midst of that time
[1:23:03] will we stand on that promise or will we
[1:23:05] back up from it
[1:23:07] amen hallelujah
[1:23:11] increase our faith
[1:23:15] that means to add
[1:23:18] that means to bring together in company
[1:23:22] and the lord said if ye had faith
[1:23:25] as a grain of mustard seed you might say
[1:23:29] unto this sycamine tree
[1:23:30] be thou plucked up by the root and be
[1:23:32] thou planted in the sea and it
[1:23:34] should obey you now you didn't say you
[1:23:36] had to have big faith
[1:23:38] right you didn't make faith it's needed
[1:23:41] it can be a
[1:23:42] the faith just of a grain of a mustard
[1:23:45] seed
[1:23:47] how many of you ever seen a grain of
[1:23:48] mustard seed well if you haven't you i
[1:23:50] don't got one here but
[1:23:52] it's very tiny it's very tiny
[1:23:55] it's one of those things that you've got
[1:23:57] you know sometimes other things you got
[1:23:58] to be careful even in your touch of it
[1:24:00] that it don't get just stuck to your
[1:24:01] finger
[1:24:03] it's that small it's very small
[1:24:06] but that all that's needed he said is a
[1:24:09] faith
[1:24:10] of the grain of the size of a mustard
[1:24:13] seed
[1:24:15] that doesn't mean we can puny faith what
[1:24:18] it means is it's faith
[1:24:19] that won't mix with nothing else
[1:24:23] it won't mix with nothing else i don't
[1:24:25] care if all of the explanations of
[1:24:28] everything that the devil would like to
[1:24:29] run down all of his reasonings
[1:24:32] but this faith won't unite with
[1:24:35] reasonings
[1:24:35] of the enemy
[1:24:39] oh my so here increase our faith notice
[1:24:42] how jude would write this here in jude
[1:24:44] 1. he said beloved building up
[1:24:46] yourselves on your most
[1:24:48] holy face so strengthening ourselves
[1:24:51] praying
[1:24:52] in the holy ghost keep yourselves
[1:24:56] in the love of god looking for the mercy
[1:25:00] of our lord jesus christ
[1:25:01] unto eternal life brother brown picks it
[1:25:05] up here in desperations father god
[1:25:07] our whole life is wrapped in that the
[1:25:09] token it's for you
[1:25:10] and you are our life there's some here
[1:25:12] lord that even holds this token
[1:25:14] that i spoke of they possess that token
[1:25:17] and yet
[1:25:17] they're sick i want to speak tonight on
[1:25:20] giving them
[1:25:21] courage to encourage them to take that
[1:25:24] god-given rights they have a right to
[1:25:27] defeat that devil
[1:25:28] he is already defeated and he's just
[1:25:31] bluffing them
[1:25:32] i'm claiming them father
[1:25:35] oh my he said help me lord that you
[1:25:38] would get in the word
[1:25:39] that lord as you get in the word and
[1:25:41] give them faith for the glory of god
[1:25:44] you've heard this quote many times
[1:25:46] spirit spiritual food and new season
[1:25:47] brother brown would address the
[1:25:49] congregation we're getting ready to have
[1:25:50] a healing service tonight
[1:25:52] and he said what we want you to do you
[1:25:53] need to be built up in the faith of this
[1:25:55] hour
[1:25:56] the of the holy oracles of almighty god
[1:25:58] the faith not of a different hour
[1:26:00] the faith of this hour that what god has
[1:26:03] promised
[1:26:04] in this hour this is the faith of the
[1:26:06] living god
[1:26:07] that's been delivered to the church of
[1:26:09] god in this hour
[1:26:11] to be built up in this faith
[1:26:14] is that right now notice how he would
[1:26:17] make this statement
[1:26:18] he would say so now he says because it's
[1:26:21] going to take more faith
[1:26:22] than ever before it's going to take
[1:26:24] rapturing faith
[1:26:26] in all things i want you said you to
[1:26:28] believe in all you have seen
[1:26:30] heard the word you have been preached
[1:26:32] the signs and wonders that you've seen
[1:26:34] done
[1:26:35] we want you to accumulate all that
[1:26:37] together in your heart
[1:26:38] and consider it whether it be god
[1:26:42] or not
[1:26:45] now let me pause here for a minute
[1:26:47] sometimes
[1:26:48] when we get into the mopeses
[1:26:52] it's because we stop thinking about all
[1:26:56] and accumulating all that god has done
[1:27:01] let me just tell you something this
[1:27:03] message
[1:27:04] you are a part of it amen
[1:27:07] god said behold i send unto you
[1:27:11] you elijah the prophet
[1:27:14] three people in that verse i send elijah
[1:27:18] unto you what was elijah's ministry
[1:27:22] to bring him back to the altar of god to
[1:27:25] call him back to the true atonement
[1:27:27] to call him back to a perfect
[1:27:29] vindication that he steal
[1:27:31] the same living god and he still answers
[1:27:34] by fire
[1:27:35] god did that for me and you
[1:27:38] [Music]
[1:27:40] and now the same fire that came upon the
[1:27:44] word
[1:27:44] that same fire is burning in your life
[1:27:54] accumulate
[1:27:59] if you let a liar talk to you he'll keep
[1:28:02] feeding your lies
[1:28:06] he'll point out everything hold every
[1:28:09] wrong he'll point out everything about
[1:28:11] it
[1:28:11] all your mistakes and you keep listening
[1:28:14] to them you keep taking it in
[1:28:16] keep taking it in there's an
[1:28:17] accumulation it starts going on
[1:28:19] is that right then you've got to get
[1:28:22] that channel blown out
[1:28:24] well brother brown called it a flu in
[1:28:26] another message is that right
[1:28:28] see it's to stand there not upon we're
[1:28:30] not standing on our righteousness
[1:28:33] we're standing in his righteousness it's
[1:28:36] not my righteousness
[1:28:38] it's not my goodness it's not your
[1:28:40] goodness we have not brought
[1:28:42] ourselves in he has brought us in
[1:28:48] hallelujah let me say this this morning
[1:28:52] he is the living god that if you're
[1:28:54] outside of the economy of god
[1:28:56] all you have to do is release your
[1:28:58] thoughts and relinquish the things of
[1:29:00] the world and say god
[1:29:01] i die to it right here lord i cast it
[1:29:04] aside right here lord
[1:29:06] i want to be united with you lord jesus
[1:29:09] you don't got to go through purgatory
[1:29:13] this is purgatory right now the word
[1:29:15] comes with power
[1:29:17] and authority to cleanse you it ain't
[1:29:19] there just to point fingers at you
[1:29:21] the word is to cause you to look away
[1:29:24] to jesus there is a cleansing flow
[1:29:28] that can change your nature
[1:29:33] it'll master that circumstance of sin
[1:29:36] it'll overcome sin in your life
[1:29:47] i can't help but think brother brown
[1:29:49] stood there and christ the mystery he
[1:29:50] said
[1:29:51] now i'm going to read luke 24 he said
[1:29:52] but i'm going to take the entire bible
[1:29:54] for my text
[1:29:56] it's accumulation this is an open book
[1:29:59] in this hour
[1:30:00] the lamb has taken the book
[1:30:04] is revealing listen these aren't just
[1:30:06] bible stories back here
[1:30:08] it's revealing the very the very scarlet
[1:30:11] cord
[1:30:11] of redemption all the way through when
[1:30:13] we read about ruth
[1:30:14] we're not just reading about some woman
[1:30:17] who was a morbidite
[1:30:18] we see our own selves in there we were
[1:30:20] born under a curse as well
[1:30:23] come on now there was no way for us to
[1:30:26] enter into the congregation
[1:30:28] of the lord but he hath made
[1:30:32] us accept it in the belevan
[1:30:35] we needed a kinsmen and god himself
[1:30:39] came down and became our kinsmen our
[1:30:42] boaz
[1:30:43] to bring us into the covenant of promise
[1:30:48] so when they could look at ruth in the
[1:30:50] field they could look at ruth
[1:30:52] while she was there what are you doing
[1:30:54] here i got a right to be here
[1:30:58] what authority do you got to be here
[1:31:00] because i came back with naomi
[1:31:04] and bo has you have a problem with me
[1:31:06] being in this field
[1:31:08] go talk to the lord of the harvest he's
[1:31:11] the one who told me
[1:31:12] to stay here
[1:31:16] hallelujah
[1:31:17] [Applause]
[1:31:19] he told me to stay here he told me to
[1:31:21] keep eating he told me to rest right
[1:31:23] here
[1:31:24] he told me to dwell right here you see
[1:31:26] this is where the power
[1:31:27] of abiding under the word and feeding on
[1:31:30] the word
[1:31:30] not just listening to it but taking it
[1:31:33] in it'll bring
[1:31:34] change it'll bring faith in your life to
[1:31:37] reach out for the promises of god
[1:31:44] you're a moabite you don't belong here
[1:31:45] but he said i should be here
[1:31:47] he told me to stay here
[1:31:52] then there's then there's the uniting
[1:31:53] that takes place it doesn't matter what
[1:31:55] they want to say
[1:31:57] at that point in time her reproach has
[1:31:59] been removed
[1:32:01] when she's been united with boha's
[1:32:03] brother her reproach
[1:32:05] has been removed
[1:32:08] let me tell you something you don't have
[1:32:10] a reproach on your life if you've been
[1:32:12] born of the spirit of god
[1:32:14] and you can look back in your life and
[1:32:15] you know there's come a change in your
[1:32:17] life
[1:32:18] just tell that old devil to shut up
[1:32:20] there's not a reproach on your life
[1:32:22] you are the redeemed of the lord you've
[1:32:24] got a right to be here in this field
[1:32:26] you've got a right to enjoy this word
[1:32:29] you've got a right
[1:32:30] to live victorious in this hour
[1:32:47] john had the glorious vision there on
[1:32:49] the isle of patmos
[1:32:54] he receives the revelation of jesus
[1:32:57] christ
[1:33:00] john why are you here on the isle of
[1:33:04] patmos
[1:33:06] well i don't want to take too much time
[1:33:09] but
[1:33:11] well john is tell me what everything's
[1:33:12] like no
[1:33:14] how about i just tell you why i'm here
[1:33:17] i'm here
[1:33:18] by a divine appointment
[1:33:23] you realize there's nothing that can
[1:33:25] come your way
[1:33:26] unless god first permits it
[1:33:31] john could stand there in a perfect
[1:33:33] peace listen to me now
[1:33:35] in the midst of the trial something
[1:33:38] that took years in joseph's
[1:33:41] life to come about before he could stand
[1:33:44] there
[1:33:44] and tell his brethren what you meant for
[1:33:47] evil
[1:33:48] god meant for good but this is because
[1:33:51] of that life that now he's not just
[1:33:54] under that life
[1:33:55] but john is dwelling in that life you
[1:33:58] think they're wanting thoughts and
[1:33:59] things of darkness to come around when
[1:34:01] you realize
[1:34:01] that you did what is in your bosom could
[1:34:04] set lives free
[1:34:05] it could change situations how many
[1:34:07] times you talk to people
[1:34:08] in the world and they can come or you
[1:34:10] see people in the workplace
[1:34:12] and if you think if they would just open
[1:34:13] if they would just receive
[1:34:15] if they would just take it and you don't
[1:34:16] got to preach a whole sermon to them
[1:34:18] but if they would just receive the lord
[1:34:20] jesus christ if they would just
[1:34:22] receive what god has placed into your
[1:34:24] bosom
[1:34:26] you know that's the answer you'd be able
[1:34:29] to tell them you don't need a
[1:34:29] psychiatrist
[1:34:30] you don't need this you don't need that
[1:34:32] you don't need this you need to meet the
[1:34:33] lord jesus now i'm not against doctors
[1:34:35] you know that
[1:34:36] but you understand what i'm saying if
[1:34:38] they just can come to that place here is
[1:34:40] john
[1:34:41] on the isle of patmos for the word of
[1:34:43] god and the testimony
[1:34:45] of the lord jesus christ now that
[1:34:48] revelation that he receives
[1:34:50] is a revelation of the mighty conqueror
[1:34:53] can i read these scriptures here i think
[1:34:56] it's fitting
[1:34:57] here he reveals himself to john i am
[1:35:01] alpha and omega the beginning and the
[1:35:04] ending saith the lord which is which was
[1:35:08] and which is to come the almighty
[1:35:11] revelations 1 17 and when i saw him i
[1:35:14] fell at his feet as dead
[1:35:16] and he laid his right hand upon me and
[1:35:18] said fear not
[1:35:19] i am the first and the last i am he that
[1:35:22] liveth and was dead and behold
[1:35:24] i am alive forevermore amen and have the
[1:35:27] keys
[1:35:28] of hell and of death what's he doing
[1:35:31] revealing himself
[1:35:32] as the mighty conqueror and what is john
[1:35:36] seeing
[1:35:36] the mighty conqueror oh my to really see
[1:35:40] him
[1:35:40] as the mighty conqueror brother when you
[1:35:43] catch a hold of that
[1:35:44] your troubles vanish
[1:35:47] it doesn't mean circumstances go away it
[1:35:49] doesn't mean the troubles just go away
[1:35:51] but it means looking at it because
[1:35:53] you're looking at it
[1:35:54] not through the eyes of a mortal or
[1:35:57] intellectual faith
[1:35:58] but you're looking at it through the
[1:36:00] eyes of the faith of almighty god
[1:36:03] and you see the circumstance it's
[1:36:05] already
[1:36:06] been conquered
[1:36:12] revelations 21
[1:36:19] verse 5 and he that set on the throne
[1:36:21] behold
[1:36:23] he said behold i make all things new
[1:36:25] aren't you glad for that
[1:36:27] aren't you glad he just didn't put a
[1:36:28] little bit of rubber cement on you let
[1:36:30] me add this on here
[1:36:32] no god comes with a complete
[1:36:33] transformation
[1:36:36] i make all things new churches they
[1:36:38] might make things this way that way but
[1:36:39] he
[1:36:40] makes all things new
[1:36:43] and he said unto me write for these
[1:36:45] words are true
[1:36:47] and faithful he said unto me it is done
[1:36:49] i am alpha and omega the beginning and
[1:36:51] the end
[1:36:51] i will give unto him that is of a thirst
[1:36:53] of the fountain of the water of life
[1:36:54] freely
[1:36:55] he that overcometh shall inherit
[1:36:58] all things and i will be his god
[1:37:02] and he shall be my son
[1:37:08] now to overcome that means there's got
[1:37:10] to be tests
[1:37:14] anybody like tess don't raise your hand
[1:37:18] nobody likes tests you don't even like
[1:37:22] tests in school do you
[1:37:23] i mean i didn't either i mean i never
[1:37:26] look forward to that boy man i can't
[1:37:27] wait for this test
[1:37:29] and none of us look forward to the tests
[1:37:31] or trials boy
[1:37:32] lord i can't wait lord when's my next
[1:37:34] trial
[1:37:37] something wrong there i'm wrong there
[1:37:42] because you don't have to ask for them
[1:37:43] they are appointed by god
[1:37:48] it's not an accident god don't get the
[1:37:49] wrong test with the wrong person and
[1:37:51] oh my goodness i got the wrong results
[1:37:53] here no
[1:37:55] it's it's made up god knows how we're
[1:37:57] made up
[1:37:58] god knows how we're made up and remember
[1:38:00] what the test is all about
[1:38:02] the test itself is that the faith might
[1:38:05] declare itself in the midst of our life
[1:38:09] because as far as the humanity part
[1:38:12] even that of the spirit those things
[1:38:14] themselves can fade right
[1:38:16] away it takes where times that you and i
[1:38:18] get strong
[1:38:19] and it allowed the tester trial the
[1:38:21] fiery trial allows
[1:38:23] the strength that part in our life to
[1:38:25] get melted down
[1:38:27] that's why paul said for thy sake we are
[1:38:30] killed all the day long we are
[1:38:33] counted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:38:37] right for what reason that his life
[1:38:39] might be made manifest
[1:38:41] in our life so there's got to be a test
[1:38:44] that comes our way
[1:38:46] can i have just a few more moments there
[1:38:48] must be a there must be tests that come
[1:38:49] our way so tess
[1:38:50] brother brown would say like this he
[1:38:52] says the test themselves he says
[1:38:54] it's it's this is the greatest thing
[1:38:56] that ever happened to you
[1:39:00] how many of you are thinking about tests
[1:39:01] like that this sounds like some of those
[1:39:03] things you need to cut out and put on
[1:39:04] the refrigerator or put it on your phone
[1:39:06] or your
[1:39:06] your you know your screen when it comes
[1:39:08] up it's the greatest thing that ever
[1:39:09] happened to you
[1:39:10] what is the test because the test itself
[1:39:15] is what displays a child of god
[1:39:19] everyone that cometh to god must be
[1:39:22] tested
[1:39:23] and tried all along the way even when
[1:39:26] god
[1:39:26] makes a call upon a person's life
[1:39:28] there's testing that comes on
[1:39:30] they'll have to maybe go through mockery
[1:39:32] and ridicule will they stand the test
[1:39:34] when
[1:39:34] oh i don't know if i can do that in
[1:39:35] front of you know my husband my wife or
[1:39:37] children or whatever
[1:39:38] they are tested there's many things that
[1:39:40] that comes their way that are tested to
[1:39:42] see
[1:39:42] are they going to go on that's the same
[1:39:43] thing that happened with the children of
[1:39:44] israel
[1:39:45] they were they came to test after test
[1:39:47] after test but those tests
[1:39:49] were nothing more than proving grounds
[1:39:51] are you hearing me
[1:39:52] if the tests were not you and i look at
[1:39:54] oh my look how many complain that god or
[1:39:56] in the time of gideon oh my look how
[1:39:58] many went running back home you're
[1:39:59] looking at the wrong thing
[1:40:00] look how many remained
[1:40:04] the test wasn't about that we focus on
[1:40:06] how many people depart
[1:40:08] come on now the test is not about that
[1:40:10] the test is
[1:40:11] is that which remains gideon started out
[1:40:14] with a big ol army man he
[1:40:16] well lord i mean i'm a little bit under
[1:40:18] undersized but
[1:40:19] you know what i i just i'm thankful lord
[1:40:22] i know that you're with us and god lets
[1:40:24] him know
[1:40:26] cut it down right here
[1:40:30] you know what he's doing mastering
[1:40:32] circumstances but god
[1:40:34] is helping get in
[1:40:37] is that right everything now you can
[1:40:39] look at and say oh he don't oh my
[1:40:41] i don't need that fleece i don't need
[1:40:43] that sheep well david didn't need to lay
[1:40:45] down a fleece for god either but it
[1:40:47] didn't make david no greater than gideon
[1:40:50] god knows how to work with ev each and
[1:40:52] every one of us
[1:40:53] the experiences remember our experiences
[1:40:56] from the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:40:58] to every experience in our life is
[1:41:01] predestinated
[1:41:02] by the hand of almighty god god knows
[1:41:05] how to deal with this guy
[1:41:06] god knows how to deal with you he knows
[1:41:08] how to minister to our lives
[1:41:10] is that right god knows that because he
[1:41:13] he don't have to do it that way
[1:41:15] but his love towards you and i to do
[1:41:17] what to bring us
[1:41:19] up in the place that place of truth
[1:41:21] where that truth alone makes us free
[1:41:25] finally he gets down there and says all
[1:41:27] right i want you bring them to the water
[1:41:28] hole get in
[1:41:29] they get them down there and every one
[1:41:31] of them that bowed down
[1:41:34] he said send them home lord
[1:41:37] there's 300 now lord lord there's only
[1:41:40] 300.
[1:41:40] look at all of them walking away lord
[1:41:42] look at all of them turning back lord
[1:41:44] look at all of them leaving but he said
[1:41:46] gideon you can't focus on that
[1:41:49] focus on those that i've given you
[1:41:53] sometimes we focus on the wrong thing
[1:41:56] come on friends it isn't an all-believe
[1:41:59] it's those that stay
[1:42:01] listen that was believers the whole time
[1:42:04] the 300 was in there the whole time are
[1:42:06] you with me
[1:42:08] bring it down to your life there's a lot
[1:42:10] of things that's fled away from your
[1:42:12] life
[1:42:12] but in the midst of every test and every
[1:42:15] trial
[1:42:15] after test after test after trial after
[1:42:18] trial
[1:42:19] what's left standing a real believer
[1:42:22] through every test through every trial
[1:42:25] and it's that believer that god takes
[1:42:28] and whips the devil with
[1:42:30] [Music]
[1:42:35] hallelujah god reducing it down
[1:42:39] this is why paul paul could write
[1:42:42] fight the good fight of faith
[1:42:46] fight it oppositions all around you and
[1:42:49] against you
[1:42:50] circumstances are against you but fight
[1:42:52] the good fight of faith
[1:42:54] it's a battle as soon as god begins to
[1:42:58] deal with the heart
[1:43:00] it's a battle the enemy wants to start
[1:43:03] setting in
[1:43:04] listen to me young people you want to
[1:43:05] know why the devil has his eyes set on
[1:43:07] you
[1:43:08] and would like to get you twisted up and
[1:43:10] target him with all sorts of things
[1:43:12] because he knows if that life is turned
[1:43:14] over to god
[1:43:15] and god has paid a personal interest in
[1:43:18] your life he knows if he can just get it
[1:43:20] tied up
[1:43:20] in somewhere that's why all hell comes
[1:43:22] against you because
[1:43:24] god himself is for you
[1:43:27] god has something for your life you say
[1:43:30] brother samuel
[1:43:31] it seems like everything is coming
[1:43:33] against me that's because even though
[1:43:35] you can't see it
[1:43:36] but god has his eye on your life there's
[1:43:39] something back down through there
[1:43:41] that god has his hand upon your life and
[1:43:43] the devil can't touch that life
[1:43:45] what should i do i just surrender it to
[1:43:47] god and say
[1:43:48] god you that's had your hand upon my
[1:43:51] life this whole
[1:43:52] time i just surrender it to you lord
[1:43:57] it's a battle there's circumstances
[1:44:00] around
[1:44:01] you know the devil can get on a person's
[1:44:03] shoulder and say oh my
[1:44:05] look at you you're bound with this you
[1:44:07] got this in your life
[1:44:09] you're wrapped up with this you're
[1:44:10] wrapped up with this look at you
[1:44:12] there ain't no way that you can serve
[1:44:14] god well certainly you can't serve god
[1:44:16] with all that in your life
[1:44:17] but there's a god right here that can
[1:44:20] set you free
[1:44:21] he can make you free he can cut you free
[1:44:23] in your life
[1:44:25] it ain't about your abilities to do it
[1:44:27] it's about a living god
[1:44:29] he's already overcome
[1:44:35] there's not a devil big enough
[1:44:38] you say that's a pretty bold challenge
[1:44:40] i'm saying it because
[1:44:41] our lord jesus christ has already
[1:44:44] declared it
[1:44:45] that's reigning supreme in my heart
[1:44:47] there's not a devil big enough
[1:44:48] there's not a sickness big enough there
[1:44:51] is no demon out of hell
[1:44:52] that can stand before the living lord
[1:44:56] jesus christ
[1:45:02] he could stand throughout this building
[1:45:03] right here of lies that god has set free
[1:45:11] are you with me we're not talking about
[1:45:14] god came and made us good people
[1:45:16] he came and released the sheep that was
[1:45:18] on the inside
[1:45:20] the sheep that was caught
[1:45:22] [Laughter]
[1:45:24] but the enemy was right there and trying
[1:45:26] to pound over a condemnation
[1:45:28] and bring that about but it's a bad you
[1:45:30] know what that bad is
[1:45:31] it's a cry for help and the shepherd
[1:45:34] himself
[1:45:35] is the one who responds to that call a
[1:45:38] sheep can't get itself
[1:45:40] out of those circumstances but the
[1:45:42] shepherd is the one who comes
[1:45:44] to where the sheep is at and loosens the
[1:45:46] sheep
[1:45:47] from the barrel patch of sin
[1:45:50] my my god is preaching personal here
[1:45:55] fight the good fight of faith lay hold
[1:45:59] on eternal life where unto thou art also
[1:46:02] called
[1:46:03] and has professed a good profession
[1:46:05] before
[1:46:06] many witnesses think about jonah
[1:46:11] i know you've heard this i want you to
[1:46:13] watch how jonah responded
[1:46:20] jonah 2 1. i could just run through it
[1:46:23] but i don't want to run through this
[1:46:26] the bible says then jonah prayed unto
[1:46:29] the lord his god
[1:46:30] out of the fish's belly
[1:46:34] let's just be honest what's the last
[1:46:36] thing you feel like doing sometimes when
[1:46:37] there is a test or trial
[1:46:39] or something that comes your way
[1:46:43] and sometimes things can come around and
[1:46:44] try to put pressure
[1:46:46] let me tell you something this is where
[1:46:48] we need to resort to
[1:46:50] to pray and prayer don't mean in the
[1:46:52] midst of that time oh i got to get away
[1:46:54] i got to get shut away in a prayer
[1:46:55] closet no it means just even right then
[1:46:57] you start praying
[1:46:58] you just start praying in your heart
[1:47:00] lord you're in control
[1:47:02] lord you're in control lord god thou art
[1:47:05] the almighty
[1:47:08] what are you doing you're fellowshipping
[1:47:10] with him with the revelation of jesus
[1:47:13] christ
[1:47:13] that's there burning in your heart
[1:47:17] and i cried by reason of mine affliction
[1:47:19] unto the lord
[1:47:21] and he heard me out of the belly of hell
[1:47:23] cried i
[1:47:24] and thou heardest my voice for thou hast
[1:47:27] cast me into the deep
[1:47:28] in the midst of the seas and the floods
[1:47:30] compass me about all thy billows and thy
[1:47:33] waves passed over me
[1:47:35] then i said i am cast out of thy sight
[1:47:38] yet i will look again toward thy holy
[1:47:41] temple
[1:47:43] circumstances i'm cast out of your sight
[1:47:46] yet yet in the midst of these
[1:47:49] circumstances
[1:47:50] i will look again to thy holy temple
[1:47:56] don't matter if i got seaweed all over
[1:47:58] me don't matter the smell of the whale's
[1:48:00] vomit
[1:48:01] don't matter all the waves the water
[1:48:03] going over me
[1:48:04] it doesn't matter that this isn't the
[1:48:06] perfect ideal
[1:48:08] circumstance to have a meeting with god
[1:48:12] but i'm here i'm his child i'm just
[1:48:15] going to
[1:48:15] invite him right here
[1:48:18] yet i will look
[1:48:20] [Applause]
[1:48:24] the waters compassed me about even to
[1:48:27] the soul
[1:48:30] the depth closed the roundabout the
[1:48:33] weeds were wrapped about my head
[1:48:35] i went down to the bottoms of the
[1:48:37] mountains and the earth with her bars
[1:48:40] was about me forever yet hast thou
[1:48:43] brought up my life from corruption oh
[1:48:46] lord my god
[1:48:48] when my soul fainteth within me
[1:48:52] i remembered the lord
[1:48:56] that truth alone makes you free
[1:49:02] and when my soul fainted that this must
[1:49:05] be it
[1:49:06] i remembered the lord
[1:49:09] and my prayer came in unto thee
[1:49:12] into thine holy temple they that observe
[1:49:16] focus on lying vanities
[1:49:20] forsake their own mercy
[1:49:23] what were the lying vanities they
[1:49:25] weren't mythful thoughts
[1:49:29] if god doesn't intercede this is it
[1:49:34] he's in a situation nobody's ever been
[1:49:36] in before
[1:49:38] all right are you with me nobody's ever
[1:49:42] been in this before
[1:49:42] jonah himself does not have a scripture
[1:49:45] to go back on
[1:49:48] he does not have something that he can
[1:49:49] go back on and say oh this person you
[1:49:51] know
[1:49:51] they were ate by a well or they were
[1:49:53] obeyed by something like this and
[1:49:55] and god brought them through but what he
[1:49:56] did have
[1:49:58] is if any of my people
[1:50:01] if they be in trouble at any time
[1:50:04] in the land they didn't even have to be
[1:50:06] in the land of israel but in the land
[1:50:08] where they are and be thank themselves
[1:50:12] and humble themselves and call
[1:50:16] on my name then i
[1:50:19] will hear from heaven
[1:50:23] he had confidence
[1:50:27] i'm going to preach a little bit
[1:50:30] that devil could have come there and
[1:50:32] told jonah and said you know what
[1:50:36] wasn't that a man by the name of solomon
[1:50:40] you know what happened to solomon at the
[1:50:41] end don't you
[1:50:44] i wonder if everything he said was wrong
[1:50:48] oh boy we're getting down now i wonder
[1:50:51] i wonder wasn't he the son of david
[1:50:54] wasn't weren't those parts look at their
[1:50:57] lives
[1:50:58] but you see jonah was a believer
[1:51:02] like abraham he was able to recognize
[1:51:05] god he was able to recognize
[1:51:09] not the fallibility of a man but the
[1:51:11] infallible god
[1:51:12] that operated through solomon's life
[1:51:15] are you with me it wasn't solomon that
[1:51:17] gave himself that gift
[1:51:19] it was god who placed that gift for his
[1:51:22] people
[1:51:23] and it was a channel that god would come
[1:51:26] down
[1:51:26] and speak to his people and minister to
[1:51:29] their needs
[1:51:30] and jonah's confidence was in the living
[1:51:33] god
[1:51:34] it was a revelation to his hearts his
[1:51:38] heart
[1:51:39] these are not the words of solomon these
[1:51:42] are the words of almighty god
[1:51:45] and you know what that was that's an
[1:51:47] absolute
[1:51:50] it's a revelation that paul said it in
[1:51:53] the midst of that
[1:51:54] hour when everything every lying vanity
[1:51:58] was around
[1:51:59] every circumstance was all against him
[1:52:01] but in the midst of it faith
[1:52:04] poked right through the circumstance
[1:52:10] faith said they're nothing but lying
[1:52:12] vanities
[1:52:14] he never said oh no there's there's no
[1:52:15] seaweed no there was seaweed right
[1:52:18] but he didn't let the circumstances stop
[1:52:21] him
[1:52:24] you see faith brother branham words it
[1:52:26] like this
[1:52:27] faith knows no age limit
[1:52:31] nor circumstances
[1:52:35] it doesn't matter how old you are oh you
[1:52:38] know these kind of things come with age
[1:52:40] but you're a child of god
[1:52:43] you we don't have to sign for things and
[1:52:44] live with things just because of age
[1:52:46] faith
[1:52:47] knows no age limit it knows no
[1:52:50] circumstance are you with me
[1:52:53] let's look at another young man by the
[1:52:56] name of caleb oh my i know he grow older
[1:52:58] but yet he was still young his
[1:53:00] his heart oh my it was tender before god
[1:53:02] and when it came over to crossing into
[1:53:04] the land remember there were those who
[1:53:06] stood there at that time and said
[1:53:07] we're not able to do it the giants are
[1:53:09] bigger oh my you don't understand what
[1:53:11] this is all about but they were focusing
[1:53:13] on all of the circumstances that told
[1:53:15] them you can't
[1:53:17] take it but they messed up they should
[1:53:20] have been focusing on
[1:53:21] the god who brought them out the god who
[1:53:24] sent him a message
[1:53:26] a prophet with a pillar fire and spoke
[1:53:28] to them
[1:53:30] he didn't deliver him with the mighty a
[1:53:32] mighty hand of another army
[1:53:34] it was the mighty hand of jehovah
[1:53:38] amen and then all through all through
[1:53:40] where the lamb's blood
[1:53:42] all the way through then the wilderness
[1:53:44] the parting of the red sea
[1:53:45] the man of falling the quail everything
[1:53:48] along the way
[1:53:49] it should have been a place that their
[1:53:51] focus became
[1:53:52] so wrapped up on god you see what should
[1:53:54] have happened an accumulation
[1:53:57] of all that god had done
[1:54:00] to consider god that brought me this far
[1:54:04] will safely take me on
[1:54:10] and caleb told him he said when i was on
[1:54:13] the other side before we ever got in the
[1:54:15] land
[1:54:16] i brought back word again as it was in
[1:54:20] my
[1:54:20] heart glory to moses
[1:54:23] i was not speaking something back that i
[1:54:26] wasn't a part of or there wasn't a part
[1:54:28] of me
[1:54:29] i was declaring what had gripped my
[1:54:31] heart
[1:54:33] are you with me if thou
[1:54:36] believest in thy heart yes
[1:54:44] let me come back to joan our close
[1:54:50] look for jonah in the midst of this
[1:54:55] verse 9 but i will sacrifice
[1:54:59] unto thee with the voice
[1:55:03] of thanksgiving jonah does that mean
[1:55:07] after you've come out of the belly of
[1:55:09] the well
[1:55:10] does that mean that after everything is
[1:55:12] good to go and everything is
[1:55:15] no it's right while i was having to
[1:55:18] like picking a hair out of your mouth or
[1:55:20] something taking that seaweed and
[1:55:22] moving all around me i will offer up to
[1:55:25] him
[1:55:26] a sacrifice of praise
[1:55:31] jonah in these conditions he's worthy
[1:55:34] that's why it's a sacrifice of phrase
[1:55:37] a voice of thanksgiving
[1:55:41] for he has redeemed me and i will pay
[1:55:46] that
[1:55:47] that i have out salvation is of the lord
[1:55:52] and the lord spake unto the fish
[1:55:56] and it vomited jonah up on the dry land
[1:56:01] that fish had got enough
[1:56:05] it got enough oh there was a worship
[1:56:08] going on down there
[1:56:09] he was having a time brother to think of
[1:56:12] it the very presence of god
[1:56:14] had come right down there where jonah
[1:56:15] was and finally here it come to that
[1:56:18] place
[1:56:18] that fish said it's enough but it was
[1:56:21] under the leading
[1:56:23] of god it couldn't have happened
[1:56:26] any sooner it had to be even when all of
[1:56:30] those from nineveh different ones would
[1:56:31] be there
[1:56:32] to witness it
[1:56:36] and he would walk out of the belly of a
[1:56:40] well amen
[1:56:42] oh my god aren't you grateful that the
[1:56:45] lord jesus christ
[1:56:46] has walked right out of the pages of the
[1:56:48] word
[1:56:50] aren't you glad that he got up on that
[1:56:51] easter morning
[1:56:53] aren't you glad that even after churches
[1:56:55] and everything else have wanted to put
[1:56:57] him back away and seal him away
[1:56:58] keep his presence away from the church
[1:57:00] of the living god and just make it
[1:57:02] nothing more
[1:57:03] but form enrichment tradition aren't you
[1:57:05] glad that he rose again
[1:57:08] according to his word and he manifests
[1:57:10] himself in glory
[1:57:11] and power it's a master
[1:57:15] over every circumstance
[1:57:19] faith in your life is a master
[1:57:23] over every circumstance even the faith
[1:57:27] of god that's pulsating to your life
[1:57:29] maybe you're without the holy ghost
[1:57:30] maybe you haven't even surrendered your
[1:57:32] heart to god
[1:57:32] but the faith of god god's love can be
[1:57:35] pulsating to your heart to do what
[1:57:37] surrender what's he doing he's bringing
[1:57:40] your confidence
[1:57:41] in him who is the word so that when you
[1:57:44] come for a promise
[1:57:46] you're not coming on well i wonder if
[1:57:48] it's so or not he makes a personal
[1:57:50] visit to your heart he's the one that
[1:57:54] inspires
[1:57:55] faith listen the holy ghost does not
[1:57:57] come to a person's life
[1:57:58] without faith it comes
[1:58:01] it comes because faith has begun to move
[1:58:04] in that heart
[1:58:05] and that heart is desiring more and
[1:58:08] desiring god more than anything else in
[1:58:10] that life
[1:58:11] what's it doing it's inspiring faith
[1:58:13] that that promise is for me
[1:58:14] no matter how many devils try to sit on
[1:58:16] the shoulder and say you'll never happen
[1:58:18] it'll never be for you it'll never but
[1:58:20] see what faith does
[1:58:22] faith rest upon that word to say god
[1:58:25] made a promise
[1:58:26] it belongs to me it's the same way it is
[1:58:30] with healing in your body
[1:58:31] it's the same way it is with deliverance
[1:58:33] it's the same way
[1:58:35] it's god pulsating to your heart
[1:58:38] to come and to stand upon that word it's
[1:58:41] a mastering of circumstances a lot of
[1:58:44] bleak circumstances
[1:58:45] can be about and can be around your life
[1:58:47] but like abraham
[1:58:49] you can stand right there
[1:58:52] and though every circumstance around you
[1:58:55] his body was getting weaker
[1:58:58] older who against hope
[1:59:02] believed in hope being fully
[1:59:06] persuaded that what he had promised
[1:59:10] he was able to perform
[1:59:17] god's bring speaks to abraham i'm done
[1:59:23] abraham lovest thou me
[1:59:28] lord i love you take isaac
[1:59:32] thine only son
[1:59:36] and come and offer him unto me
[1:59:41] look what abraham says right here
[1:59:45] in genesis 22 he speaks out
[1:59:49] to those that's accompanying around
[1:59:52] you stay here with the asses i
[1:59:56] and the lad will go yonder and worship
[2:00:00] and come again
[2:00:03] what was it faith mastered the
[2:00:06] circumstance
[2:00:09] but god told him to offer him up but
[2:00:11] abraham's faith said
[2:00:13] god made a promise that through this
[2:00:15] seed
[2:00:17] this seed had be a father of many
[2:00:20] nations and so god accounted
[2:00:24] abraham accounted god able to raise
[2:00:27] him from the dead well was it faith
[2:00:32] produced by divine love
[2:00:37] daddy we've got the wood
[2:00:41] we've got everything where's the
[2:00:44] sacrifice that daddy
[2:00:46] my son god will provide for himself
[2:00:50] a sacrifice faith
[2:00:54] mastered the circumstance it was
[2:00:57] faith said i don't know how he's going
[2:00:59] to do it
[2:01:01] but he's going to do it
[2:01:04] i don't know how that all these the
[2:01:06] atoms on my body will be changed
[2:01:08] but he's going to do it i don't know how
[2:01:11] it's all going to happen but i know he's
[2:01:13] going to do it what are you going to do
[2:01:14] i'm going to keep eating

[2:08:04] lord jesus like jonah was in the belly
[2:08:06] of the well
[2:08:09] as abraham walked even when he walked up
[2:08:12] mount moriah
[2:08:14] as caleb stood there lord god and joshua
[2:08:16] that day
[2:08:18] lord jesus as daniel stood there
[2:08:22] when daniel knew they had laid a trap
[2:08:24] for him
[2:08:26] your prophet tells us lord that daniel
[2:08:28] knew
[2:08:29] that they had laid a trap for him
[2:08:33] he said but david or daniel in humility
[2:08:36] not arrogantly
[2:08:37] but in humility he prayed
[2:08:40] because he was being tested on the word
[2:08:44] would he still look away
[2:08:47] to thy holy temple and pray
[2:08:50] lord jesus i believe i'm speaking to
[2:08:54] believers and i believe i'm one of them
[2:08:58] that lord jesus we're not here
[2:09:00] arrogantly
[2:09:02] lord jesus we know there's traps there's
