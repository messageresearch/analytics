my death or by the rapture amen this is ours it's our escape out of this life but certainly we you know even as you see as those that is a growing older and we see you start sensing things even in your body you're thankful that God has made a way of escape for us a man that we we don't have to continue to tarry but we believe that all things that God has clearly pointed to us and we see in the scripture where we are standing we're standing in the place that all have looked and all the prayers everything all the way down through the ages have spoken of this time what a privilege and with this privilege comes such a great responsibility may God help us give us the grace to do what he's called us to do amen let's just stand we want to look right into the word of the Lord let's go to Genesis chapter 27 verse 41 we want to read just a little bit more here the life of Jacob in verse 41 of Genesis 27 the scripture said and Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and Esau said in his life the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will I slay my brother Jacob and these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah and she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said unto Him behold thy brother Esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee now therefore my son obey my voice arise and flee to Laban my brother to her honor and tarry with him a few days until thy brother's fury turn away until thy brother's anger turn away from thee and he will forget that which thou has done to him then I will send and fetch thee from thence why should I be deprived also of you both in one day and Rebekah said to Isaac I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth such as these which are the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me so there's going to be there is to be a fulfillment let's just look to the Lord in a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we are just so thankful tonight Lord to be able to come together Lord with brothers and sisters of like precious faith Lord seeing that you you know the need Lord within every heart and every life Lord if there be any question Lord or father Lord you are the answer Lord and you know how to speak Lord to every heart Lord and minister to every need Lord so we just Lord reserved ourselves and we just do it ask Lord that together that the Lord you would help us to get out of the way that you Lord the author Lord of the book Lord Father the Fox that you have sealed within here Lord God that you would comment just Minister to our hearts tonight in a very personal way Lord we pray we just commit ourselves to you Lord we give you praise and thanks Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you being seated if you just keep your Bibles open there with me if you would you see that how that in this this portion of Scripture we we've been dealing with the thought here for some time looking at how that the blessing itself and the blessing being that of the life of God that that belongs to the blessed and the blessed we recognize as that as we've seen in the Scriptures is God's choosing when Mary was approached by by the angel the angel spoke to her and said Mary thou art highly favoured thou art blessed among women it wasn't something that Mary we know that she had just done that she had obtained favor but her favored the favor is that favor which is unmerited it was given by the grace of God before the foundation of the world it was already he before Isaiah ever prophesied a virgin shall conceive this was already in God's mind so here she is moving into that time and if you think of how that the Prophet places it and he dramatizes it in Mary's belief and in the other messages to where that if the Spirit of God begins to move upon Mary's heart at that time pertaining to those scriptures in regards to a virgin shall conceive she begins to think of those scriptures to talk anuman she's talking with her and her and Joseph and remember how the Prophet would place it as though she is asking Joseph and Joseph says Mary that's a little too deep for me to explain how he said but this is one thing that we know Isaiah is God's prophet and we know that a prophet has the word of the Lord so we know that God's Word cannot fail and I think that was a very very tremendous dramatization and statement that is made there when we you can see how that within Mary already chosen and we would see the choosing of God I just want to refer it to a place that I referred to last week brother Bram says sometimes with the with the term predestination he said people get to thinking as though that it's gonna be God do all the pushing and God do all the pooling but yet the predestination of God does not remove and take away from decisions and choices that are to be made the thing that is true is that it's just like this within the predestination of God being chosen of God that God was sinful or that the influence of his word by his Spirit and will influence his children to make the decision in the hour that is crucial and needful when he is present there could be a lot of other decisions that they can make within their life that are decisions that you know can bring trouble and so forth but the ultimate decision that they are influenced there to make is that decision of life because they are ordained to life and it is God that seeks each and every one out it's just when we are looking at this here with Jacob and when you see this within Jacob's life here as we looked at it last week and I just feel pulled just in in some of these things just to go through them when you look at this within Jacob's life even though it is spoken to Rebekah the mystery of what's going on within her that the elder shall serve the younger this is made known to Rebecca Rebecca keeps this in her heart and then in the time when Rebecca hears that that it's time for the blessing to be pronounced she gives direction to Jacob at that time and you and you you look at it here Esau goes off but yet Jacob receives direction at that time and this is the thing that I know very simple but when you can see it how that even though that Jacob was ordained of God said that he would be the one to receive the birthright his birth was against him the order was against him and you can see that how that God Justin did not just leave things in a manner of a haphazard way and say well Jacob you know he's predestinated he'll get there but what God does when we look at just at this parallel we see how that God Himself provides what's needed for when his children are up on earth and God is there to care to shepherd to guide and to bring us to that place that he's ordained for us so we see that not only in the spiritual birth we see it also how that God has appointed those things around us but to recognize that even in that that how that God has saw deigned it to bring us from our spiritual birth into that translation of the body so it's God that has provided it's him even God that is moving through his ministry it's God that's doing the work it's God that's laying that the the message is upon the servants heart it's God that is bringing direction it's God that's bringing counsel and we want to be sensitive to hear what God has to say to our hearts because it's God this is the thing it's God caring and watching over his word and we believe we believe I'm a part of that word so it's God watching over it it's God that even though we know it must be that faith move within our hearts but it's God himself that moves to stimulate our faith by his word has his presence comes to confirm it it's God coming and he's the one that stirs it up and then here we stand and say yes Lord that's me and it's all him providing for himself there's no glory that we can take within any of it but yet that doesn't mean that then we don't have to do anything when it comes down to is him moving upon our lives and within us were yielding so when we're looking at all of this we see that even with Jacob all Jacob had to do was yield to what was being spoken even things that didn't make sense things that also that was troubling to him that would bring that you could see the fear what if my father what if he discovers it's me but yet Rebekah assures him she's she's taking full responsibility for him thy curse be upon me then you think of how that in word when Jacob stands there before I and Isaac says how is it my son that thou has found this so quickly and notice what Jacob he has received of God's grace for that moment he says the Lord thy God had brought it to me he's recognizing that it's the Lord that has ordered him on even what to go and get and then to bring that to his mother his mother makes preparation that he might take it into his father that he might receive the blessing pronounced over his life it's God providing for himself I know this I know that it's very simple and there's things that you know I thought man I just want to move on a little bit but I just also want to be able to be led by the Lord and that every little thing that we can take out of here that God has for us we want to take out of here because God knows what we need and so you find that with that in mind look at how Rebekah look at how that Rebecca's moved in this time she she hears of what he saw has said and she hears this her.she she calls jacob and she begins to let Jacob know that Jacob there if I can say it in this terms there's a bounty upon your head Esau is upset with you because the blessing that you have obtained and yet when you look at it it's not the the actuality of what the real blessing was that Esau wanted Esau only wanted if we can say the benefits or the overflow or those things about it he was not after the life because when he comes to to Jacob when he comes like Isaac he said father haven't you at least got one blessing left for me he's not after he's never had a value for the birthright that he had in his possession it was in his possession nobody took it from him I hope you understanding me nobody took it from him he was in his possession he had it right in front of him but he allowed it to pass from him he allowed it nobody took it from him he permitted it so when you see how that Rebekah taking this burden upon her and I just very very much so he can see how that it's God that is placed the burden on Rebecca's heart where for her even as she says here at the very end of it when she speaks in verse 46 there to Isaac and she says I'm weary of my life because of the daughters of health if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth such as these which are the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me everything all that she's prayed for all of the the direction and everything was she was obedient to what God had spoke to her regarding those twins there within her womb and how that even she's moved in that hour to give direction unto Jacob at that time by the leadership of the Holy Spirit but yet even in this time she says he cannot take a daughter of that - wife of the daughters of Heth it's got to be one of kin one from the homeland that's a bird that is there that's resonating in her heart that it's not it's not just something that here he's obtained the pronouncement of the blessing but there has got to be a completion of this Jacob himself has there has to be a union there has to be a bride there has to be one that he takes for his very own so notice this in verse one of Genesis 28 the scripture said that Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto Him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan arise and go to and I run to the house of Beth you'll die mother's father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayst be a multitude of people and give the blessing of Abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayst inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which God gave unto Abraham now notice I'll this time together here that the blessing of Abraham this is God's covenant this is God's life and this is solemnly God who gives this that with this blessing of Abraham thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which God gave unto Abram and Isaac sent away Jacob and he went to panorama unto Laban son of bethuel the Syrian the brother of Rebekah Jacobs and Esau mother now let's look here just for a moment on this blessing of Abraham because as the scripture mentions here that God Almighty give me the blessing of Abraham in the book of Galatians chapter 3 verse 13 the scripture says Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us for it is written cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through brethren I speak after the manner of men though it be but a man's covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dissing Allah or out of there - now to Abraham and his seed where the promise is made and he saith not and to seeds as a minute but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ as watch how the Prophet takes this here in the revelation of Jesus Christ he says notice another glorious revelation in this typing of Joseph Joseph while in Egypt was given a Gentile bride and through her he received a family of two sons ephraim and manasseh joseph asked his father to bless the two boys he placed them in front of jacob so that Manasseh the firstborn would be on jacob's right and ephraim to the left as jacob was about to bless them he crossed his hands so that the right hand fell upon the younger and joseph cried out not so father this is the firstborn to your right but Jacob said God crossed my hands here in tight we see that the blessing which belonged to the firstborn the Jew was given over to the younger the Gentile through the cross crossed hands of the Lord Jesus Christ remember Apostle Paul picks this up in Romans 8 that unto Israel unto the Jew whom pertaineth the adoption who pertained at the covenants all of those things were pertaining unto them but because of the rejection now through Calvary the offering up of the sacrifice where it should have went to the Jew instead through the cross it passes on the younger which is the Gentile whoa hallelujah amen you and I you and I Jacob didn't know remember here's Jacob he crosses as he does not realize he doesn't see it all of what's taking place but God is sovereign Lee moving look at this this action upon earth was already in God's mind you and I were held there in that action when he crossed those hands that was God saying I already thought of you hey men that wasn't you and I identified there in that scripture we can look at that scripture and see the grace and the mercy of God to us the blessing he goes on to say the blessing comes through the cross and he reads the scriptures that I just read there at the very end of that paragraph he says the blessing of Abraham came through the cross to the Gentiles the Jews rejected the cross therefore Jesus got the Gentile bride so when we we recognize that the birthright is the right of the firstborn and think back into the scripture wind as we said moments ago that Jacob recognizes that his day of departure is close at hand so when Jacob realizes that his day of departure is close at hand he he sends forth Esau and he tells he sought what to go and get that he might come that I might bless thee so when we're looking at that blessing of the blessing that pertain it's there to the birthright here Jacob it's it's known this is the time this is the moment and as he guess he moves with within this what is taking place in this time is the pronouncing of the blessing it's not the actual imparting of the blessing at that time it is the pronouncing of that because Jacob here he is under the pronouncement you know Jacob still walks out Jacob I want you just to watch this here so you find that how it could not be this blessing you could not be something that would be pronounced after Jacob had passed off the scene or after ice that could pass off the scene and then we find even how Abe you know had passed it on to Isaac but it was not just something that was just handed down there was an appointed time where that that blessing of the of the birthright was pronounced upon that of the firstborn it was a very crucial time that's why Rebecca moved with the Ernest T of which she did you think of how that the Lord Jesus now I want you to think of this here how that the Lord Jesus himself when he made promise and we're thinking of this blessing of Abraham that his spoke there in the scripture this blessing of Abraham here the Lord Jesus declares to the Church of the Living God and he says these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so he sends the Holy Ghost is sent in his name note there is a purpose within this and remember as the Scriptures declare his name in the Book of Revelations is called the Word of God so his name being revealed it's his person being revealed it's his characteristics being revealed it's him being revealed so he sends the father's sins the Holy Ghost which is the blessing of Abraham he sends it in his name now what's this here Jesus when he's here in John 5:39 among many places in the scriptures but he speaks to the people in that hour search the scriptures now who's he speaking to those to whom the birthright would belong are you with me he's speaking to them now search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and you will not come to me that you might have life they had right to the birthright but here stay in the midst of the time when life is standing before them they reject they despise they turn it down turn it down for what they don't turn it down for going out into the world they turn it down for creeds they turn it down for dogmas they turn it down they sell out in order to maintain where they're at and what happens the birthright passes on they're left in darkness that's why Jesus said walk in the light while you have the light what is like for that you can see where you're going is to show the pathway walk in the light while you have the light lest darkness overtake you so then here as you see that when here they they they they they crucified him and when they crucified him remember they put him out and they could go on they went on but yet God moved on and here was an electro-pop people even when he was here upon the earth it was a small little group of people that was identified and was catching the revelation of that time and they it wasn't the intellectual people of the hour but it was the very much so those that were off scour even how the Prophet could say their name can be rode on the side of a boxcar and they couldn't even read it it wasn't the purporting of ignorance but what it was showing is is that God's foreign nation and God's choosing when that word would pass across the pathway it would have some meaning and have an effect upon their life it's God moving by way of his word so has he moves for the Mint's now remember you find this even where Paul remember how it's Paul standing here I believe you know it's I believe it's acts 10 where Paul is standing it's X 10 or X 9 where Paul is standing and he's speaking there to the Jews remember how Paul who's growing there among the Jews and the Jews you know they were rising up and they were stoning Paul for speaking blasphemy Essenes they were they were charging him with those things and remember what the Spirit of God spoke through Paul and it says because you judge yourself unworthy love we turned to the Gentiles God had given even a space of grace right there that they might receive and come under that blessing of the birthright and fully obtained it but because they rejected it now the word moves on and there is nothing prescient that can bring the best thing of Abraham on their life no matter how much they can read there's nothing prescient that can bring the blessing of Abraham I'll say like this so clearly there's nothing present that can bring the real truth birth of the Holy Ghost outside of the word of Almighty God when the world is spurned when the world is rejected they're rejecting life they're turning it out it's that himself which is able to stand and pronounce the blessing and then we come under that blessing hallelujah notice how it says in the revelations behold I stand at the door and knock he's put out they don't want they don't want the life giver there they don't want the word there they don't want that at all they put it out from him who did they put out they put Christ listen this is not a doctrine he said behold I stand at the door this is not a teaching this is the person of Jesus Christ amen this is the fountain of life himself this is the blessed sir and they have put him out of the church and yet have more Bibles than anything else everything and and everything populated but they put him out of the church he is not allowed to have the right away so what are you left with you're left with a lot of pronouncing x' but it is not the true witness of the holy ghost it's pronouncing things that's to be the birthright but it never turns into a genuine birth why Jacob said the time of my departure is at hand it's a crucial time it's a crucial time there's always a measure of time God gives a space of time through every age God gives a space of time notice this how that dick of these statements here brother branham makes in modern events make clear about prophecy is that how it can tell this lady OC in church age the good thing how can I do it when the good things when God spoke against it you're naked miserable you say I'm rich I have better I have churches like the Methodists and the Baptist's and the Presbyterians I have this I have that the best this that and the other that's right but you don't know you're naked blind miserable to the real thing that God is manifesting it'll go right through you like that moving right out believe people before it's too late what's he calling the attention to the blessing the breath ride is being pronounced here's a time to be born of the Spirit of God his account can come when the word is present you understand what I'm saying people can live friends listen to me I want you to see this people can live real sanctified life but a sanctified life does not mean it's a Holy Ghost filled life the saint of that life can live our last cleaned up life there are foolish virgins but they're not filled with oil they don't have the Holy Spirit in their life but don't have the Holy Ghost they're veterans clean living people my friends listen it ain't enough just to have a sanctified life it's God has gotta be loyal in their life there's gotta be a fire that's lit that conserves that Jesus Christ is alive and well that confirms that indeed he is Lord amen her life must give that testimony that's why even in the fourth personage of him in the Book of Revelations the voice of many waters crying out the Spirit of God crying out to each age down through what is the voice crying out listen the whole ministry that has happened friends all the down through the ages it's not a different ministry it's the same spirit of God that is calling the people to the true atonement it's calling the people of God in every age who are identified there in that sacrifice who were chosen an elect of God it's the Holy Spirit seeking you and I out how does God seek us out he seeks us out by his word his word goes for us is that right him and the gospel of your salvation in which after you heard you believed you trusted and after you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise was God moving think of how the Prophet takes it but just read just a portion of this passage which I believe that many are familiar with out of choosing of a bride and how that the Spirit of God has the Prophet standing there in the last portion of that message think of here in Los Angeles and choosing of a bride and I want you to look at this statement here very closely and in paragraph 238 he said these people naturally Lord would give me the last penny they had to support the message they do anything that they could but all God when it comes to coping with it and coming into it I pray God that this will be the night that you reward them and pour down your holy spirit upon this convention this gets tight but the reality of it is it's not just agreeing with it it's not just well the message and we're just agreeing with it but notice what he said when it come it's got to come to that place to where from the heart that there is obedience from the heart it's wonderful to reference the presence of God and what God is doing but this message came to bring a real Union to bring a real transformation in the hearts and lives of the people it's not enough to fellowship about how glorious it is but even only way you can really describe the glory is you become part of that goal and that glory shine upon your life and the glory of God changed you if not you're only talking about an event that happened amen this is to be our life hey man is ought to be more than life to us they meant more than anything else amen notice when he says and to 240 here let me just get record 240 Oh penny cost run for your life fully to the horns of the altar and crowd before it's too late for an hour will come when you cannot when you can cry and it'll do no good for Esau sought to find a place of his birthright and couldn't find it I commit you'll California Oh convention of the Full Gospel businessmen who I love who have left and Strunk you with all my heart I commit you to Jesus Christ tonight flee to him don't let the devil ever cool you off from this what is this missus ending here I'm telling you this is not a man by the name of William Branham hey man this is God himself that is crying out through that messengers voice what you're doing is crying out in intercession that this is the time this is the moment if you don't moving this time it'll pass right away amen it's time to move it's just like when that women win the the Bible everything in the Bible look everything was in seasons and we see how that the angel would come down and jump five I believe at certain seasons that it would treble the water and they would move within that water at that time what you think of this that troubling of the water whole mouth and I love it you know when you begin to look at it and how the prophetic eye begins to pick it up and brother Ram tells us like this he said if you'll notice in the troubling of that water he said as soon as the person stepped into that water he said there might have been some that thought it was a wind some might've thought it was this he said that it was the angel of the Lord that was sent there at that time because as soon as the one stepped in the water they were made whole because they believed and the water cease troubling when was the water trouble it was troubled by the presence of the angel of the Lord and it was troubled at that time for those who were need at that moment and after they received what they need the the water ceased it's time when the water is troubled to move into the water amen the water is traveled for you have been traveled from me he has come down here in this time in this hour notice they were all sitting around the pool because they knew that the angel the Lord would come there in this place and one thing we know and believe as believers is God will always come to his word it's God who comes down and he travels his word he gives us a place where we can walk into where we who were bound and stricken and afflicted and deceived and bound we can walk in there and be made whole let me tell your friends they're not an excuse there is not a reason there is nothing nothing too big and too great for God I hope you understand what I'm saying I believe in praying for one another but I don't believe in carrying around things that's just shouldn't be carrying around we've gotta have confidence in God have confidence that God is present and you stand there upon that word and say the Lord you've made the promise Lord I'm gonna stand here on this word I believe deliverance is mine Lord they met it's gotta take sons of Jacob sons of Abraham that will stand on the promise they men God will send His Word to create a frolic hey man he sends his word to stir our hearts him Enda stimulate faith that we will move in that promise they say brother Sammy you seem like that seemed like a little cold-hearted friends and ain't cold hearted if listen if I had an if I had an infirmity in my body you know what if I kept coming instead rather I've got this pain in my shoulder rather you pray for me everything I'll pray for it I keep coming in saying I got this pain in my shoulder you pray for him yeah brother I'll pray for you brother Sammy I got this pain in my sword about time if you're gonna stand with me you'll say Oh Samuel is there anything that is hindering in your life come on somebody the Bible said let him call for the elders of the church come on somebody let him confess their sins not nobody else's your sins a mental enema night with oil and pray the prayer fees are you listening you see friends listen we is a belief what we're talking about or we don't either God is God or is not understand I'm not talking about maybe that's where it's a instantaneous but I believe in God he can do the miraculous right now but I believe also that that same God can bring such a touch and such a witness in a heart to where you stand steadfast in the faith and you're walking into your healing walking to your deliverance and said it's mine I've already received a witness I've already received a confirmation from the Lord I'm not gonna lay here on this pallet no more amen glory be to God notice what he said stay right with it until your everyone filled with the Holy Ghost in so much that it'll make you come to this word this is the feeling he's talking about that will make you women straighten up that will make you men straighten them if you say you've got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word it's another spirit in God's Spirit is on his word the Messiah then the Messianic the anointed word and the bride must be a messiah the anointed word now let's look at this just for a moment here in verse 4 let me move back here to verse 3 in verse 4 Genesis 28 and here's what Jacob remember he charged jacob isaac charged jacob and blessed him he told him where to go and to find the wife and notice in verse 3 here and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou may us be a multitude of people who is it god almighty and give me the blessing of abraham to thee jacob isaac can pronounce it over jacob he can preach the birthright message he can preach the blessing but only one can bring it to jacob and that's God Almighty what's God Almighty do he follows his word his word the blessing is the pronouncement comes through the word and he follows his word to confirm his word that's why the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is God's confirmation of his presence it's God's confirmation that he foreknew you it's God's confirmation of his word even where Paul himself could say ye are the seal of mine Apostleship in Christ notice this that thou mayest inherit so the inheritance of this land where you are stranger right now the way you inherit it is through the blessing if Jacob said well but having the blessing are they been pronounced over me it has the way is declared this is it belongs to you but it takes God Almighty to come and confirm it you see friends that's why it's not enough just to set under good preaching it's not enough just to set under under under word that's coming forth it's not enough yeah it takes god almighty to come and confirm that word personally if not it just becomes accumulation of facts accumulation of knowledge equipment but it takes God to come and confirm that word it takes God to come among the people and do a real work is the preaching of the word necessary absolutely absolutely because through the preaching of the word the Holy Ghost comes on the scene is that right the Bible look out that glad that God dealt with Cornelius Ghost send for one called Simon Peter you know I'm paraphrasing go send for him so here they sent for him God deals with Peter then and when they come Peter you know he presents himself to them he comes there to the house of Cornelius and and Cornelius says we are all here we are ready to hear those things which God has commanded of us to thee they were already you believe this Cornelius and they you believe they were elect of God they were to receive the blessing of Abraham they were to receive the birthright but notice God has someone on the scene that could be yielded to that of the word of that time in that hour that could preach the fulfillment out the word the atonement and the Holy Ghost fell on them the Bible said while Peter yet spake these words not just any words these words Peter was a witness he was aid up with the Holy Ghost hame anyone just Peter speaking and rehearsing the events but Peter was declaring and rehearsing those events there was a direct witness in his soul and the presence of God came down to confirm the word what was it they heard the word and the Holy Ghost came down and confirmed the word that you are whom the right patinas it takes God Almighty to come well he's not there then there's no one that can bring life it's like it's like having a maternity ward at a hospital you can have all the maternity wards you want but if you don't have somebody there who can bring birth it's nothing but painted walls it's nothing but flowery things and everything else it's nothing but a potential birthing place what has to be there there's got to be staff there's got to be one who is there that's qualified to bring birth let me tell you there's not a man upon this earth that's qualified in himself to bring birth there's no one except Christ himself and he is the one God Almighty who brings the birth amen that's why true birth follows the word he'll send the Holy Ghost in my name notice Acts chapter 2 just the rehearsing of a couple scriptures Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's not merited notice you repent you be baptized but you can't baptize yourself into Christ right you can't even baptize yourself in this pool but you can walk in obedience to the word right it takes somebody up here to take a hold and guide you through that and you have to yield as they baptize you here that's the same way that's what the Holy Ghost it takes God moving upon the heart God moving on the life to do what fully surrender when you fully surrender he fully comes in this is where for us by the body is one and has many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit Ephesians 2:1 and you hath he quickened who's he he's the same one behold I stand at the door he who see the Holy Ghost who's he the father right he he you have he quickened who were dead and sent in trespasses goes on here is that okay if I read these we're in times past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the Prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience in other words you and our help Les Jacob was helped les if it hadn't been that Rebecca caught it at that time are you with me yet he was or danger received the birthright but notice how God had it at the appointed time here Rebecca caught it say hey hey it's time it's time the blessing is getting ready to be pronounced that God provides for himself among whom also we had all our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even as others but God this is the difference but God this is not a continuance this is a change of course many men but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace ye are saved and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of His grace and his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus it's him it's his working it's him moving us yielding and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let me just read you a few statements here the Holy Spirit witnesses and receives you and God receives you and puts his seal upon you and he brands you and then just by accepting it won't only do God's got to vindicate back that he has accepted you you can accept him but then if he accepts you stay right there until he does accept you so it's not just the pronouncing of the blessing oh my I'm here but the blessing this is God opening his way it's God's grace that you and I would know the way there right and when he does he seals you in this kingdom by the baptism of the Holy Spirit then you have your secure into the day of redemption grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're sealed until the next revival no until the day of redemption is that right there's no ups and downs and ends and out you really get into God if you're really in him not just impersonating something but you're really in Christ you're one alternative your whole hearts sold out every bridges burnt behind you and you got your affections set on things above and you run the race with patience that's set before you amen that all right I've got two more I want to read how do we come into that body how do we get into it but one spirit were baptized into one body and when in that body free guarantee of resurrection God placed upon him the iniquity of us all not by one hand sake not by one church letter but by one Holy Spirit Jew Gentile yellow black white have all been baptized by one spirit into that one body through the blood of his own covenant and when I see the blood I'll pass over you and are free from death free from pain free from sin he that's born of God does not commit sin because the seed of God remains in him and he cannot sin be you therefore perfect even as your heavenly Father is perfect jesus said how can you be perfect you can't do it you was boy since shakin iniquity come to the world speaking lives but when you accept Christ as your sin bearer then you accept him by faith you believe that he saved you and he died in your place and took your sins then God accepts you and that tells you into the body and can't see sin no more how can I be a sinner when there's an atonement on the altar from me amen the key is he the Baptizer must come and baptize you amen it takes him to do that notice that the variance is in one place to the message you know even in the earlier part of the message he said I said I don't think we ought to be saying that I received the Holy Ghost he said I think you need to say the Holy Ghost received me Amen that's the reality it's not us receiving it it's him receiving us hey man on the day he when the Lord Jesus is walking into the water to be baptized areas being baptized coming up out of the water heavens are open and hear the Holy Spirit descending in the form of a death and the voice is her coming this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell the spirit had sought him out in obedience it had brought him to that place amen and what did it do the Holy Spirit came down and confirmed and claimed what belong to him [Applause] [Music] that's exactly what the true baptism of the Holy Ghost did it Pinnacle's it did it Corinth he did in the house of Cornelius it's the Holy Spirit it's God Himself coming down and claiming what is his a man it's him putting his seal upon it's him confirming his word to make it real and alive to you and I you are part of that word Guillory am I thinking before the foundation of the world the blessing that was pronounced you are the recipient of that blessing future home heavens and earth have met God and man is reconciled our restored Eden has begun all the curses gone notice he's comparing that future home that cleansing and he brings it down into our life that type just like all the curse of sin is gone when the Holy Ghost accepts see you don't accept it it accepts you because it's God's attribute it's God seeing himself it's God recognizing his children it's God recognizing his word amen oh he said if the Holy Ghost it means God's Spirit his attribute the thought of God has accepted you because you are Dane for that purpose yet you was born in sin but God had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on earth and he comes down and gets you he comes down and gets you the whole story of redemption is told through the Scriptures when they took lot lot belong to Abram Abraham arms himself with trained servants and went down he didn't just go anywhere he the Bible says he went even unto Dan what was that - the lowest parts of hell he went to the last fairness place and then he brought back that which was captive when David's wife was taken captive Zig lack you remember he here is he's looking for his wife and they've taken they've taken his wife what does David do he arms himself and goes after his wife he brings them back gulfs who were taken captive what David was away they were taken captive but when David came back David went after his wife and brought his wife back wasn't it was David going after her she didn't have power to come back but he had the power and authority to go after her and bring her back Locke did not have the power to overthrow what he was under but Abraham by separated lives had authority he could go after life and bring Lord back you and I were with a low but God Himself came down he came down to get us we could not get there but hang in his power and authority he formed himself a blood cell he created a body purpose for death and redemption of blood that is a perfect blood that he might shed that blood that his life might come to you and I what is that that is his life saying you were mine the whole time I loved you I came for you the blessing is for you I've come to retrieve you you were always mine always mine there's not one of his not one that can escape he knows where each one is at and he comes after his own the holy spirit searching out what's he doing coming down to get his and like Jacob his eyes looks deeper than what we can see all of the things about our life it's not about all the things of our life it's about it's choosing it's about yielding to him it's about him coming and drawing you drawing me to a place where we come to say Lord I believe Lord as we're believing then what is God doing he's drawing us he's pulling us he's moving upon our lives he's influencing us and we keep walking Lord Jesus northern kata I love you Lord this is the sounds Lourdes this is from me Lord I believe this oh lord this this is from me Lord this is home Lord and what is he doing he's bringing us to a place of acceptance not something that you or I do it's what he has provided aster provided nothing to make her accepted before a hazers but she accepted what Grace provided you see what grace provided it actually is substance that we partake of you love him listen this is why I just like in every service every moment don't let a moment pass don't let a time pass when God is moving the Spirit of God is moving and he's dealing with your heart dealing with your life move in yield to him it's God Himself dealing and working in our lives the same God that can move right here tonight right true why the word was going forth that can bring healing to a life and Olivia's to another life can bring the baptism of the Holy Ghost God himself is able to do all those things right while the word is going forth that's why Satan wants to get your mind wondering he wants to get your mind looking over here get you caught up over here but remember give yourself to the word because when he is present and where he is when the word the gospel is preached the Holy Spirit comes down to confirm that word who is that that's Christ in our midst that's him coming to confirm his word and to perform his word now put on a show but perform his word that stirs our faith to accept and to walk and believe and to take those things that he has spoken and say Lord the blessing that's been pronounced confirm it Lord in my heart Lord love the reality of the birthright the blessing of Abraham drop you love him tonight he says your back here here is where you belong sin has lost its power the desire of sin has done gone from your heart when the Holy Spirit comes in you are a restored he comes down makes away that he might accept us it's what must I do brother send him we must yield yield to him you love him let's pray musicians if you want to

cleanse ourselves from all sin perfecting holiness in the fear of God the very first scriptures above that it says that the Lord has spoke to them and said come out from among them separate yourselves and I will receive you unto myself you shall be my sons and daughters and I will be your God this is a promise of God when God's Word as it comes that's my friends it's a very crucial hour it's a very crucial moment the presence of God here in these times because if not it passes right through as the Prophet was announcing for them there it'll pass right through what's important is it's like everything else and everything else aside the Prophet tells us improving his word he said let everything else go and let you focus entirely be linear let everything else and that your focus be entirely you know God he wants to see sometimes out of our life what are we gonna do do we value his promise do we value it we move toward it everything this is for every promise that God has given us
