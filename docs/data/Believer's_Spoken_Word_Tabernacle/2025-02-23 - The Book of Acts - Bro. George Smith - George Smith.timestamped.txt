[34:17] I appreciate his real balance with being

[34:21] around he's seen there's been a lot that
[34:23] he's seen you know over the years and I

[34:30] seen a lot of things over time but you
[34:32] know it just goes to show that no matter
[34:35] how time changes when that Revelation is
[34:39] solid upon our heart it that's the
[34:41] anchor that holds us time itself time
[34:44] doesn't change anything it only further
[34:47] manifests what's all what's already
[34:49] there and so we just appreciate that and
[34:52] want to pull on the gift of God this
[34:53] morning and um you know for those of you
[34:56] that don't know it and and I I just say

[35:21] with stories from Arizona and things

[38:33] Lord
[38:34] amen don't forget it all these songs we
[38:38] sang that's our
[38:40] confession amen while we're standing
[38:43] let's open our Bible to John chapter
[38:46] 8 it's good to be back with
[38:50] you
[38:51] and seems like I always come when
[38:54] there's some snow or something
[38:56] but I'll try to get back when there's
[38:58] green leaves
[38:59] too it's good to see all of you so we're
[39:02] going to look at a couple of scriptures
[39:04] here and uh I've got the King James
[39:08] version which is what you have and I've
[39:10] got another Bible uhhuh called the lza
[39:14] Bible probably never heard of it but if
[39:17] you've listened to William Brandon very
[39:18] long he talks about this man and it's a
[39:23] a little bit different translation but
[39:24] it's very good so John chapter 8 verse
[39:27] 31 as you look at your
[39:30] Bible then Jesus said to the Jews who
[39:32] believed in him so we got it narrowed
[39:35] down to the ones that believe in him
[39:37] it's wasn't for
[39:38] everybody if you abide in my word you
[39:41] are truly my
[39:44] disciples and you will know the truth
[39:46] and the Very truth will make you free so
[39:49] you have a choice you can follow and
[39:52] know the truth or you can stay over here
[39:53] in bondage and go down down to the hot
[39:56] place got
[39:58] choice we're not playing games today the
[40:02] truth the other place we're going to
[40:04] read is over in Galatians chapter
[40:07] 1 this is a key verse for the day that
[40:12] we're living
[40:13] in because we got a lot of foolishness
[40:15] going
[40:16] on and
[40:18] um Galatians chapter
[40:21] 1 Paul had been through this area
[40:24] preached to these people baptized these
[40:26] people he comes back back a few months
[40:27] later and some other believers had come
[40:30] through no you got to do it this way you
[40:33] know we' got this good idea and blah
[40:35] blah
[40:37] blah and Paul says in verse 6 I'm
[40:40] surprised how soon you have turned to
[40:42] another gospel away from Christ who has
[40:45] called you by his
[40:46] grace a gospel which does not even exist
[40:50] it's a
[40:51] zero how be it there are men who have
[40:55] stirred you up and want to pervert the
[40:58] gospel of Christ but though we other
[41:01] words me Silas Samuel William brandham
[41:05] anybody or even an angel comes down from
[41:07] heaven and preaches another gospel than
[41:10] that which I've already preached to you
[41:12] by Revelation let him be ACC cursed and
[41:14] go to the hot place
[41:16] quickly yeah we're not playing games and
[41:19] if you weren't paying attention the
[41:20] first time as I said before so I say now
[41:24] again if any man preaches another gospel
[41:27] to you you than that which you've
[41:28] already received let him be a
[41:31] cursed Heavenly Father we thank you for
[41:33] your word today we thank you Lord that
[41:35] you've called us all together here to
[41:37] this lovely place and Lord we don't take
[41:39] it for granted we realize this is a holy
[41:42] place to stand before your people we
[41:44] pray that you would anoint your word and
[41:46] make it real to each person we ask in
[41:49] Jesus name amen you may be
[41:55] seated now I'm here for
[41:57] for two
[41:59] reasons maybe
[42:02] three One Pastor invited me and I
[42:06] appreciate it I don't even get invited
[42:08] everybody but I get invited at certain
[42:10] places and come
[42:13] back and I don't think I've told you
[42:15] this before but I got a friend who God
[42:17] deals in
[42:19] dreams and he dreamed that he was in um
[42:23] in brother Brandon's living room like a
[42:25] fly on the wall watching things you know
[42:28] and so he said in this living room there
[42:30] was uh two chairs and there was sister
[42:34] brandom and brother Neville and then me
[42:37] and Rebecca was sitting here by the
[42:38] fireplace so that's that's the
[42:42] scene and so um he said that uh the
[42:46] adults were talking about current things
[42:49] but then brother neble got up to
[42:51] leave okay he left March of 1974
[42:57] and then sister brandham got up to see
[42:59] him to the
[43:01] door and the Lord called her in May of
[43:05] 81 and so they're by the door and they
[43:08] called hey Rebecca come here so she
[43:10] comes over and she left in November
[43:15] 06 they looked back at me and they said
[43:19] you keep doing what you're
[43:20] doing and that's why I'm still
[43:23] here been gone about over two weeks from
[43:26] my house and zero weather 5 Ines of snow
[43:29] but I'm doing what God called me to do
[43:32] so that's where we're here today and
[43:35] today we're going to begin a series that
[43:39] might take a long
[43:41] time we're going to get into the book of
[43:44] Acts book of Acts is foundational
[43:47] teaching the book of Acts is the only
[43:49] book in the Bible That's not finished
[43:51] because you're living the extension of
[43:53] the book of
[43:55] Acts there you go and so the writer is
[43:59] Luke now most people are under the you
[44:03] know idea that um Paul wrote most of the
[44:08] New Testament well that's probably true
[44:10] he was he was the preacher there was
[44:12] somebody else helping him
[44:14] okay brother Ram did the preaching he
[44:16] had other people helping him so the
[44:18] writer is Luke he was the Beloved pH
[44:21] physician he was a doctor high level
[44:23] Greek Citizen and uh he accompanied Paul
[44:26] on missionary Journeys
[44:27] did a lot of the writing throughout the
[44:29] New Testament okay now don't let this go
[44:31] over your head it's very simple but you
[44:35] need to know your
[44:36] Bible because those people in the church
[44:39] down the street they're reading their
[44:40] Bible too you got to know why you have
[44:43] long hair you got to know how why you're
[44:45] wearing a long
[44:46] dress why we follow the message of the
[44:50] hour it's important because the world is
[44:52] falling apart and the resurrection is
[44:54] imminent and are you ready or you just
[44:57] following along like okay this is what
[44:59] we do you got to know
[45:02] why when brother random was caught
[45:04] beyond the curtain of time and there's
[45:05] no other person that I ever heard of
[45:07] that went over there and came back and
[45:08] told us what it was
[45:09] like we have the word of the
[45:12] Lord amen and the all the great things
[45:15] he said but the vital part was and you
[45:17] will be judged for what you
[45:19] said the angel appears to Samuel today
[45:22] and tells him that he's going to start
[45:24] biting string Nails just like I would oh
[45:26] what about well I want to erase a few
[45:28] things we're humans but brother Ram
[45:30] didn't even Flinch he said what about
[45:32] Paul he will be judged by what he said
[45:35] too well if Paul's people get in my
[45:37] people get in because I preach what Paul
[45:39] preached so it's very important to go
[45:40] back and see what Paul preached it's
[45:41] right there in Galatians
[45:43] 1 so we stick with what Jesus said what
[45:46] Paul said what William brandom said the
[45:48] rest of it forget
[45:50] it
[45:52] okay so we are a vital part of God's
[45:55] plan he's got us here for reason yes and
[45:59] no one is going without the baptism of
[46:01] the Holy Ghost you will be left behind
[46:03] because the day after the Rapture this
[46:05] church will be full of people oh we want
[46:07] to get in too late too late so you got
[46:10] to got it fixed now so we got to have
[46:13] the Holy Ghost Divine love reflecting in
[46:15] our daily life that's why we come to
[46:17] church see what's missing and that's why
[46:20] we want to see if we're
[46:25] level just
[46:28] right that's got a
[46:30] secondary you know purpose you'll find
[46:34] out a little bit later so Luke became a
[46:37] disciple he was not an apostle okay a
[46:40] disciple is a
[46:41] follower now if you don't take notes I'm
[46:44] sure they're recording it you'll find
[46:45] out later but uh while Jesus was on
[46:48] Earth he had 12
[46:49] disciples an apostle is one that's sent
[46:52] out it's a missionary okay Luke
[46:55] accompanied Paul the great missionary
[46:57] and the original disciples were mostly
[46:59] fishermen uh many could not even sign
[47:01] their name one was a tax collector one
[47:03] of the worst jobs there was uh one was a
[47:06] revolutionary and um there were 11
[47:09] disciples and they became Apostles okay
[47:13] and so these were ordinary men that God
[47:15] used in extraordinary ways to spread the
[47:18] gospel just like
[47:21] you now some of you came out of the
[47:23] Catholic
[47:24] Church some of your relatives are still
[47:26] over
[47:27] there in the Catholic Church you had a
[47:30] man by the name of Francis of AIS he was
[47:34] a real man 900 years
[47:37] ago and William brandham said he was a
[47:39] preacher of the Gospel so we'll just
[47:41] leave it at that he preached what he
[47:43] knew and he said preach always use words
[47:48] when
[47:49] necessary well how do you do that you
[47:52] just show up as a
[47:53] Christian you don't have to preach words
[47:57] your life is what
[48:00] preaches so these
[48:02] people they were Ordinary People they
[48:05] were ued with the Holy Ghost and there
[48:07] was God's choice it all worked out
[48:09] because you know we look at it man is
[48:10] that the best you could find that's what
[48:13] God
[48:14] ordained why God ordained all of you why
[48:16] didn't you get some people in here
[48:17] really know what they were talking about
[48:19] no God ordained us to be here amen thank
[48:21] you Lord and He trusted you with the
[48:23] secrets of the Gospel okay so let's see
[48:26] if we can get through a little bit of
[48:28] this today uh is anybody in a hurry to
[48:30] go no no sir free free parking right
[48:33] okay not a
[48:36] problem so God's still in business he's
[48:38] still changing lives just like he did
[48:40] back there okay and the Gospel of Luke
[48:42] and the book of Acts are two-part two
[48:44] volume set because he he wrote the the
[48:48] Gospel of Luke and then he wrote the
[48:49] book of Acts and in verse one of chapter
[48:53] uh one here of Acts he's uh writing to
[48:57] his friend in
[48:59] um in another place he says the former
[49:02] treaties which is the Book of Luke I
[49:04] have made o Theophilus of all that Jesus
[49:07] began to both do and teach until the day
[49:10] which he was taken up after through the
[49:12] Holy Ghost had been given Commandments
[49:14] unto the apostles whom he had chosen to
[49:17] whom also he showed himself alive after
[49:19] his Passion by many infallible proofs
[49:22] seeing being seen of them 40 days in in
[49:26] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[49:29] kingdom now this is the only mention in
[49:31] all scripture of the time frame between
[49:32] the resurrection and the Ascension okay
[49:36] very similar to this age brother Brandon
[49:39] was right over here in Green Lake
[49:40] Wisconsin
[49:42] 1962 and he said can't you see we're at
[49:44] the end time it's all over the next
[49:47] thing will be a
[49:48] sweep and get that little group together
[49:51] in a month or so see says 40 days a
[49:54] month or so same thing she'll be gone as
[49:58] soon as she's gathered together we're at
[50:01] the end there are no hopes left anywhere
[50:03] run to Christ
[50:06] people in another place he says we're
[50:09] not getting people to Christ we've got
[50:11] people to a
[50:12] teaching okay William sent you know
[50:15] William brand was God's Prophet God sent
[50:17] him we believe right what about the
[50:20] foundation what about getting people to
[50:22] Christ what about the Born Again
[50:24] experience you're not going without it
[50:26] right all this knowledge is not going to
[50:28] do you any good we got people fighting
[50:30] up our quotes oh he said here's forget
[50:32] it you got to get the foundation
[50:35] right there you go we don't know what he
[50:38] said in those 40 days he just says here
[50:39] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[50:41] kingdom of God so today don't waste your
[50:45] energy uhhuh out in the desert of
[50:49] speculation leave it alone God will
[50:52] reveal according to your need will yes
[50:55] sir now brother Samuel rais these three
[50:57] boys did a pretty good job so
[51:00] far yeah there's hope but when they were
[51:03] 5 years old they they wanted the keys to
[51:06] the car it'll be revealed as you needed
[51:09] it not not one day
[51:12] before so God's going to reveal what you
[51:14] need as you need it and if you don't do
[51:17] the job today you might not get to that
[51:20] place so we got people figuring all this
[51:22] out look Heaven is only for those that
[51:25] get there there's no need to go figuring
[51:28] it out it's going to be this just just
[51:30] live
[51:31] today the job you have is get to the
[51:35] resurrection sir okay verse four we're
[51:39] making
[51:40] progress and being asend assembled
[51:42] together with them commanded them that
[51:43] they should not depart from Jerusalem
[51:45] but wait for the promise the Father
[51:49] which he saith you have heard of me
[51:52] where do they hear that John 141 15-18
[51:55] ver 26
[51:57] and he further expounds for John truly
[51:59] baptized with water but ye shall be
[52:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost not many
[52:03] days from
[52:04] now when they therefore were come
[52:07] together they asked of him now here's
[52:10] the disciples they've been with him
[52:11] several years they've slept with him
[52:14] they ate with him they Miracles all this
[52:16] stuff now here's a resurrected being
[52:19] first one they've ever seen it's never
[52:21] happened
[52:22] before they had a political question
[52:25] just like today who cares who's
[52:28] President we're we're leaving this whole
[52:30] thing's going to burn I got news for you
[52:32] America is not going to get great again
[52:35] come on it's not going to happen it the
[52:39] Man simply is adjusting the thermostat
[52:42] temporarily it's all going to burn
[52:45] Prophet already said we're so worried
[52:48] about some of the Visions what about the
[52:49] vision he turned wow it's all smoldering
[52:51] ashes it's coming all this is going to
[52:54] burn
[52:56] okay let's get back to the story here so
[52:59] here they are asking him a question Lord
[53:01] will you at this time restore the
[53:03] kingdom will you now get the Romans off
[53:05] our back and make Israel great again you
[53:08] know no
[53:10] no so After experiencing these
[53:13] infallible proofs having close
[53:15] fellowship with the resurrected being
[53:17] having meals together Lord this is all
[53:19] wonderful but are you now going to get
[53:22] the Romans off our back you know that
[53:24] was their greatest most important
[53:26] question right they were humans just
[53:28] like us they had children they had to
[53:31] whip they had wives they argued with
[53:33] they were just like
[53:35] us they weren't
[53:37] superum William brandham wasn't Divine
[53:39] he was
[53:41] human so over here in the the lamza
[53:44] Bible in verse 7 it says it's not for
[53:46] you to know the time or the times which
[53:48] the father has put in his own authority
[53:50] and other words it's none of your
[53:53] business jump on these people should
[53:56] have known and understood by this time
[53:59] that Rebellion against Rome was not the
[54:01] proper Christian attitude but rather
[54:04] faithfulness to the message of the hour
[54:06] and the lifestyle of the Gospel simply
[54:08] imitating the master that's what they
[54:11] should have been catching you
[54:13] see the prophet says over here in
[54:15] Revelation chapter 4 how we need in
[54:18] Jeffersonville and Cleveland and all
[54:20] these other Villages thousands of lived
[54:23] voices the Thunder of God thundering out
[54:25] in sweetness Holiness Purity undefiled
[54:30] lives walking around the Earth today
[54:31] without a blemish yeah that'd be nice
[54:35] just just lives blossoming out with the
[54:38] gospel he says that is the Thunder
[54:42] against the enemy the devil doesn't care
[54:44] how loud you can holler he doesn't care
[54:46] how high you can jump none of this but
[54:48] What Hurts The Devil is to see that
[54:50] Sanctified holy life consecrated to God
[54:54] say anything to him call him anything
[54:58] and he's just as sweet as he can be
[55:00] moves right on that throws him that's
[55:02] the Thunder that shakes the devil so the
[55:05] devil doesn't care how much you know how
[55:07] much you can quote who your grandpa is
[55:09] none of that what about your lived life
[55:13] that's righten what about just preaching
[55:15] the gospel with your
[55:16] life when the sisters go to
[55:19] Walmart and they have the long hair
[55:21] there's people that
[55:23] oh well they signed their ticket the
[55:26] ones that say God bless you they're
[55:28] going another Direction you you didn't
[55:30] say a
[55:32] word so chapter 1
[55:36] ver8 but you shall receive power after
[55:39] the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you
[55:41] shall be Witnesses unto me both in
[55:42] Jerusalem and in Judea and over Samaria
[55:46] now we hear those names every day in the
[55:49] news Israel's still there little bitty
[55:53] country because now today they're living
[55:56] on
[55:56] 17% of the original promise because
[55:59] through Wars and politics they've given
[56:01] it away and they the other people want
[56:04] it all well anyway it's not the
[56:07] story all Judea Samaria and under the
[56:10] uttermost part of the Earth all the way
[56:12] to
[56:12] Ohio the par the gospel didn't come in a
[56:16] parachute didn't come in a jet it came
[56:18] people over here on a horseback and on
[56:21] the rivers bringing the gospel and we
[56:23] are the fruit of all that effort okay
[56:27] so in verse n vanished in a cloud and
[56:31] they went and did what he
[56:32] said now you may thinking well this is
[56:35] pretty shallow we are bride material I
[56:37] hope so I hope all of you go to heaven
[56:40] but the same Prophet said there's three
[56:41] kinds of Believers in every congregation
[56:43] and only you know who you are don't
[56:45] worry about the next
[56:47] guy I can look at you know this one that
[56:49] well you must be no who am I that's
[56:52] right
[56:53] right so we're we're headed to the top
[56:57] of the pyramid okay starting to thin out
[56:59] and we're mature we want to hear the
[57:01] Deep things of God well this is the Deep
[57:03] stuff of God right here this is the
[57:05] foundation this church couldn't go up
[57:06] without a good foundation okay well
[57:09] anyway so be careful how you judge see
[57:12] we're so eager to put a label on people
[57:15] and judge people and um we have an
[57:18] entire library look everything William
[57:21] Bram said is on every cell phone of the
[57:24] planet you want to hear what he said go
[57:26] for it it's all there I'm just here to
[57:28] encourage you to stick with the program
[57:31] see and so um is this is sound okay
[57:36] everybody here okay um we can hear the
[57:39] Mysteries we can hear the doctrines
[57:41] Revelations and um we only want to stay
[57:45] balanced stay balanced right all these
[57:49] nice cars outside they're worthless if
[57:51] you don't balance the tires properly you
[57:53] won't go very
[57:54] far you know
[57:57] children are unbalanced do work out you
[58:00] got to stay balanced okay so you see you
[58:03] got to understand we're in a church full
[58:04] of Christians in progress we got people
[58:08] back here don't even understand
[58:11] English we got kids we got new people we
[58:14] got to have balance and so we're in
[58:16] progress so we got to review from time
[58:19] to time be sure the foundation is
[58:20] secured because you see not everybody
[58:23] had the same good cup of coffee that you
[58:25] had no we're all different you're
[58:28] looking at one person I'm looking at all
[58:30] the colors all the different stuff you
[58:33] know so we're individuals and um the
[58:37] Bible says in 1 John 3:11 this is the
[58:40] message you heard from the beginning
[58:42] that we should love one
[58:44] another that that's the whole basis love
[58:47] one another amen amen and so um we can
[58:52] we can try it in our natural flesh we oh
[58:54] God bless you real nice but you see it's
[58:57] automatic when you have the baptism of
[58:59] the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not
[59:02] optional it's not if you feel like it if
[59:04] all the stars line up if everybody's
[59:06] nice to me no you must you see if you
[59:09] want to be at the meeting in the air you
[59:11] must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[59:13] okay so in verse 10 two angels appeared
[59:17] the same Jesus which is taken from you
[59:19] into heaven shall so likewise come in
[59:21] like manner as you seen him going to
[59:23] heaven and from there we have a private
[59:25] interpretation of the cloud that
[59:27] appeared in 1963 no that is an appearing
[59:30] this isn't the coming get that straight
[59:34] okay
[59:35] now um 12- 15 of chapter 1 they got
[59:39] together in the upper room Mary was
[59:41] there the mother of the Lord Jesus yeah
[59:44] and um she was there saintly obedient
[59:47] walking in truth of the hour she wasn't
[59:49] the Queen of Heaven the way they told
[59:50] you in the Catholic church and she was
[59:52] his Earthly mother and she was one of
[59:54] many that were there and she was not
[59:56] arrogant she wasn't selfish she wasn't
[59:58] demanding she wasn't in control she was
[1:00:00] an obedient
[1:00:01] lamb right
[1:00:04] yeah 1 Corinthians 15:6 says he was seen
[1:00:07] of above 500 Brethren at once it's
[1:00:09] commonly understood that that's the
[1:00:11] number that could have been on Mount of
[1:00:14] Olives to see him Ascend but he told him
[1:00:17] go to The Upper Room well guess what
[1:00:20] only 24% made it over there where's the
[1:00:23] rest somebody had to be unbelievers and
[1:00:25] make Believers 76% you know and so 12
[1:00:30] through 20 15 through 25 they discuss
[1:00:32] the facts of the death of Judas the
[1:00:34] traitor now all this is in your Bible
[1:00:37] you got to read it for yourself we're
[1:00:38] going to jump over a lot of verses but
[1:00:40] you have to go home and read get in
[1:00:42] there and read read uh read um
[1:00:45] Scofield's notes he did a lot of
[1:00:47] studying oh yes you see scoffield
[1:00:51] finished his work
[1:00:53] finished ready to publish January AR 1st
[1:00:56] 1909 with no computer only pencil and
[1:01:00] paper and a few
[1:01:01] helpers and he's got a lot of Truth in
[1:01:03] there
[1:01:06] okay so they discussed the death of
[1:01:08] Judas the traitor they were quoting from
[1:01:10] Psalm 41 and also from
[1:01:13] 69 and um the scripture says and no one
[1:01:16] shall live there where he committed
[1:01:18] suicide what the Bible says they knew
[1:01:21] their Bible and to this very day that
[1:01:24] area where he committed suicide nobody
[1:01:26] lives there because the Bible is
[1:01:29] right when Jesus was here he he went to
[1:01:33] Village to Village praying and preaching
[1:01:35] the
[1:01:36] gospel but three villages did not
[1:01:40] believe corim Bida and capernium
[1:01:45] and to this day it's a pile of rocks
[1:01:48] nothing is there there's a few people in
[1:01:51] capernium because the Catholic Church
[1:01:52] bought the land and they got a chapel
[1:01:54] there but nobody lives here
[1:01:58] so the rest of the chapter has to do
[1:02:00] with the one you know replacement of um
[1:02:03] that they chose for replace Judas but
[1:02:06] see they were humans like us they had
[1:02:09] problems they had situations they were
[1:02:11] just like brother brandom and just like
[1:02:13] the song we just sang the more you yield
[1:02:15] the more God can use you but if you got
[1:02:17] to have your way well God's got better
[1:02:20] things to do you know so God's still in
[1:02:23] business just like the book of Acts he
[1:02:25] Hebrews 138 is still in effect so let's
[1:02:28] get into the good part here in Chapter
[1:02:30] 2 in Chapter 2 and verse one and when
[1:02:33] the day of Pentecost was fully come they
[1:02:35] were all with one Accord one place verse
[1:02:37] two and suddenly there came a sound from
[1:02:39] Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:02:41] filled all the house where they were
[1:02:43] sitting and there appeared unto them
[1:02:45] clothing tongues like as fire and sat
[1:02:47] upon each one and they were all filled
[1:02:49] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:02:51] with other tongues and the spirit gave
[1:02:53] them utterance now this is day 10 they
[1:02:56] didn't know how many days he didn't say
[1:02:58] go up there for 10 days go up there
[1:03:01] god'll take care of it so they're up
[1:03:03] there in the upper room hiding from the
[1:03:05] from the angry Jews down here they don't
[1:03:07] know how many days 120 up there but
[1:03:11] they're in one Accord they're in
[1:03:12] agreement seeking for the Fulfillment of
[1:03:14] verse 8 of chapter 1 the noise came got
[1:03:17] the tongues of fire but you see the
[1:03:20] Church of Jesus Christ was at that point
[1:03:22] launched in Jerusalem that was the alpha
[1:03:25] Church we are over here in the Omega
[1:03:27] through seven ages and 2,000 years we've
[1:03:29] been restored back to the original
[1:03:32] through a prophetic message straight
[1:03:34] from God according to the prophecy of
[1:03:36] Malachi
[1:03:38] 4 you got to read your
[1:03:41] Bible am I preaching to people that know
[1:03:44] their
[1:03:45] Bible so in verse 5 it says they were
[1:03:48] there from every nation what's that all
[1:03:50] about because in the
[1:03:52] scripture in Leviticus 23 and also in
[1:03:56] Exodus
[1:03:57] 23 God ordained Seven Feast occasions
[1:04:01] throughout the calendar year okay for
[1:04:04] his people in three of those occasions
[1:04:07] all the male Believers were to go to
[1:04:11] Jerusalem so they saved up for this
[1:04:13] occasion they would all go they had have
[1:04:15] place to stay they had have place to eat
[1:04:18] so during the Feast of Pentecost which
[1:04:21] was the Feast at that time all these men
[1:04:24] were in ch were in town it's a big deal
[1:04:27] now back then Jerusalem was a walled
[1:04:31] City
[1:04:32] okay because they didn't have Air Force
[1:04:35] if you're going to you know hurt
[1:04:37] somebody you got to walk got to come
[1:04:38] through a gate so they walled the city
[1:04:41] and so then um it's got eight Gates one
[1:04:44] gate is closed we'll get to that later
[1:04:46] but anyway all these people all these
[1:04:49] extra people are in
[1:04:50] Jerusalem only in 1885 they started
[1:04:53] Living outside the city
[1:04:56] and so they're all there for this Feast
[1:05:00] of the Jewish
[1:05:01] religion and they were at least
[1:05:03] bilingual maybe three because they spoke
[1:05:06] Hebrew that was the that was the the
[1:05:09] language of the scriptures of the church
[1:05:12] the
[1:05:12] temple but they came from at least 16
[1:05:15] other countries where they had been
[1:05:16] dispersed so they spoke that language
[1:05:18] where they were
[1:05:20] born so they're there for these six
[1:05:24] days 100 20 were up here for 10 days and
[1:05:27] that overlapped so when they come
[1:05:29] spilling out of the upper room like
[1:05:31] drunk
[1:05:33] man speaking a language that these
[1:05:35] people understood in 16
[1:05:40] languages and
[1:05:43] um they're speaking it with a with a
[1:05:45] Galilean
[1:05:47] accent you know when the Canadians come
[1:05:49] down here it's another
[1:05:51] accent so all this is working together
[1:05:54] so they're coming out because when Jesus
[1:05:56] spoke these words over here in 18 be my
[1:05:59] Witnesses way far away they had no clue
[1:06:03] they didn't know the Earth was round
[1:06:05] Marco Polo hadn't come along their their
[1:06:08] world was very small they knew Spain was
[1:06:11] over here in Rome and but they're the
[1:06:14] end of the Earth but now we got all
[1:06:16] these 16 Nations here they're coming out
[1:06:18] of the upper
[1:06:20] room and um
[1:06:23] so when when they see that these people
[1:06:27] are speaking aren't these guys From
[1:06:29] Galilee they're unlearned they don't
[1:06:31] have a you don't barely can pronounce
[1:06:34] and it could have been more than 16
[1:06:37] languages and um so while Peter had
[1:06:41] their
[1:06:42] attention he's speaking to people he's
[1:06:44] speaking to the crowd without a
[1:06:46] microphone that's one of my questions
[1:06:48] how did you do that we got 100 people
[1:06:51] here and we got to have a
[1:06:52] microphone yeah thousands right you know
[1:06:57] and so verse 14 of chapter 2 he begins
[1:06:59] his sermon where he says here um
[1:07:04] standing up with the 11 lifted up his
[1:07:06] voice uhhuh and said to them ye men of
[1:07:09] Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be
[1:07:11] known unto you this day and hearken to
[1:07:14] my words and so he could have spoke for
[1:07:16] 30 minutes we don't know but he ends
[1:07:18] over here in verse 36 therefore let all
[1:07:21] the house of Israel know assuredly that
[1:07:23] God hath made that same Jesus whom you
[1:07:26] guys crucified both the Lord and
[1:07:29] Christ okay and so he was led entirely
[1:07:33] by the Holy Spirit to say what he said
[1:07:35] he he didn't beat them into submission
[1:07:37] the way they would do at one of our
[1:07:38] churches today he simply was faithful to
[1:07:41] the
[1:07:42] truth he didn't call for immediate
[1:07:44] response but in 37 now when they heard
[1:07:47] this this 30 minute
[1:07:49] sermon they were they were pricked in
[1:07:51] their heart something's going on and
[1:07:54] they said to Peter and the rest the
[1:07:55] apostles uh What About Us in other words
[1:07:59] we believe what you said but where are
[1:08:01] we at in this picture what what can we
[1:08:03] do and he said well first thing you do
[1:08:05] is repent and be baptized every one even
[1:08:08] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:08:09] remission of sins and you shall receive
[1:08:11] the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a
[1:08:14] promise for this promis is unto you and
[1:08:17] unto your children and all they far off
[1:08:20] all the way to Ohio and Indiana as many
[1:08:23] as the Lord Our God shall call by pray
[1:08:25] this to
[1:08:26] it's not for everybody all Ohio isn't
[1:08:29] going to believe this message no it's
[1:08:32] for a select few that will sit still and
[1:08:34] pay attention and let God do something
[1:08:36] in their
[1:08:38] heart with many other words you did
[1:08:40] testify and exort saying save yourselves
[1:08:43] from this generation okay so this
[1:08:45] doesn't just for the new people this
[1:08:47] doesn't in any way subtract or
[1:08:50] contradict the commission of a few days
[1:08:52] earlier when Jesus said and baptize them
[1:08:55] in the name name of the father son Holy
[1:08:58] Ghost the people in Rome make a big deal
[1:09:01] out of
[1:09:02] that and you guys
[1:09:08] remember they're saying it over there
[1:09:09] right now but in the name what's the
[1:09:13] name now there's been people baptized
[1:09:16] correctly throughout all
[1:09:18] history okay William Ram didn't invent
[1:09:20] acts 238 it's already
[1:09:22] there but he brought our attention back
[1:09:24] to the truth
[1:09:27] okay so it's simply the Fulfillment or
[1:09:29] the manifestation of the spoken word so
[1:09:32] this small yielded band of Believers
[1:09:36] 120 in
[1:09:38] one one gospel meeting grew to over
[1:09:42] 3,000 God was in
[1:09:44] charge it's a simple formula Ministry
[1:09:48] speaks truth God does the work we can
[1:09:51] only speak it we can't beat it into your
[1:09:54] head right amen we can only speak it
[1:09:57] Billy Graham said I have found that the
[1:09:59] gospel when the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:10:00] is presented with authority quoting from
[1:10:03] the very word of God he then takes that
[1:10:05] message and drives us supernaturally
[1:10:07] into the human heart it's Act of God
[1:10:10] that you believe that you even have the
[1:10:12] interest to be here today that's right
[1:10:14] yes sir come on now if you're here
[1:10:16] looking for a wife well that's your
[1:10:17] problem but you're here because God sent
[1:10:20] you right brother brandom says preaching
[1:10:23] is God's program how we going to get
[1:10:25] away from that that's good now don't
[1:10:27] come around to me and say well got to
[1:10:28] say what he said you're on I've been
[1:10:31] listening for 59 years
[1:10:33] too you know come on now so we might not
[1:10:36] be gifted like some of these people like
[1:10:37] Peter and these guys you know but your
[1:10:39] life is preaching every waking moment
[1:10:43] wherever you are wherever you go your
[1:10:46] life is showing something yes you
[1:10:50] see okay so in 42- 45 of chapter 2 there
[1:10:54] was Unity of purpose
[1:10:56] um and fellowship it was God's program
[1:11:00] for that time some have tried it today
[1:11:03] God's Prophet told them it won't work
[1:11:06] okay so they went to church every day oh
[1:11:09] you thought you had it tough coming here
[1:11:10] for a couple hours no every day they had
[1:11:13] Church they met together daily in their
[1:11:15] homes they had Holy Ghost Fellowship
[1:11:17] they ate together they remembered the
[1:11:19] Lord they were actually having communion
[1:11:21] every
[1:11:22] day in 47 and the Lord added to the
[1:11:25] church daily God is in charge okay
[1:11:29] brother Ram says I'm just a public
[1:11:31] servant of God to you the preacher is a
[1:11:34] public servant like the garbage
[1:11:36] collector like the policeman public
[1:11:39] servant so the news that we got for you
[1:11:41] today we are not the managers of God's
[1:11:44] bride that's right that's right now we
[1:11:46] have people around us with the same
[1:11:48] spoken word books with the same King
[1:11:49] James version they want to be in control
[1:11:52] that's not God's program that's
[1:11:54] organized religion we came out of that
[1:11:57] you had that in the Catholic Church very
[1:11:59] good no we're over here amen so we're
[1:12:01] not the manager of God's people and
[1:12:04] we're only following the New Testament
[1:12:06] examples okay we're going to jump over
[1:12:08] to chapter five and see if we can get
[1:12:11] through a few more chapters here because
[1:12:13] it's very important so in chapter 5 um
[1:12:18] we have a
[1:12:19] situation they had all things in common
[1:12:23] and this is the model in the idea
[1:12:25] advocated by communism and
[1:12:28] socialism they're not way out there
[1:12:31] they're coming out of the scripture see
[1:12:33] but it's never been achieved and these
[1:12:35] early Believers were not setting up an
[1:12:37] economic system they were simply
[1:12:39] responding to each other with gracious
[1:12:41] Christian Compassion that's right
[1:12:44] demonstrating and living out the love of
[1:12:46] God not only in words right okay so
[1:12:50] everything seemed to be running smoothly
[1:12:52] up through the end of chapter 4 but
[1:12:54] unfortunately all the Believers not all
[1:12:56] believers in the New Testament uh share
[1:12:59] the same Godly
[1:13:00] concern so chapter 5 and verse
[1:13:05] one but a certain man named ananas now
[1:13:09] you notice nobody names their little boy
[1:13:12] ananas I've never heard of anybody no
[1:13:15] and his lovely wife Safara does anybody
[1:13:17] call their little girl Safara oh it's
[1:13:20] got a bad
[1:13:21] connotation they sold a piece of land
[1:13:24] and they kept back a part of the land
[1:13:27] his wife was an agreement and um and
[1:13:30] they brought the money and put it at the
[1:13:31] apostles feet but Peter said uh ananas
[1:13:36] why has Satan filled your heart to lie
[1:13:39] to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part
[1:13:41] of the price of the land while it was
[1:13:43] yours you know and so forth and um
[1:13:46] ananas hearing these words fell down
[1:13:49] gave up the ghost right and great fear
[1:13:52] Came Upon the people not that they were
[1:13:54] afraid they worked up okay and the young
[1:13:57] man arose wound him up went out and
[1:14:00] buried him right now and about 3 hours
[1:14:03] later see your Bible's full of details
[1:14:05] Luke was a good writer he wasn't making
[1:14:07] it Up 3 hours later what happened income
[1:14:13] Safara baling
[1:14:15] in like nothing
[1:14:17] happened
[1:14:19] yeah and Peter says now now tell me hone
[1:14:22] you um you sold the land for so much yep
[1:14:25] that's
[1:14:26] right how is it that you have agreed
[1:14:29] together to tempt the spirit of the Lord
[1:14:31] behold the feet of them which buried
[1:14:33] your husband they're coming out in the
[1:14:35] door and they're going to carry your
[1:14:36] sorry self out of
[1:14:37] here and she went down now she's flat on
[1:14:42] the ground and they took her
[1:14:44] out we got a
[1:14:47] problem these are make Believers you
[1:14:51] see and um so anyway they buried her and
[1:14:56] great fear Came Upon the people it
[1:14:58] wasn't so much that they didn't turn it
[1:15:00] all in that that wasn't the main problem
[1:15:03] right God doesn't need your cash but if
[1:15:06] you keep back your tithing if you keep
[1:15:08] back your offering you will suffer
[1:15:11] that's right that's right but the sin
[1:15:13] was that they lied they tried to deser
[1:15:16] deceive the Servants of God and theyby
[1:15:19] deceived God in chapter 4 you can read
[1:15:22] it for yourself in 33 and 34 there they
[1:15:24] brought it all in hey no problem but
[1:15:26] here's these these unbelievers and on
[1:15:29] the outside they look good oh yeah they
[1:15:32] had nice clean clothes yellow tie
[1:15:35] whatever but on the inside there were
[1:15:38] cheats yeah so this living in common was
[1:15:42] a historical event it's not a Doctrine
[1:15:46] okay nowhere do we find that mandated
[1:15:48] for believers there's been those that
[1:15:50] tried to work out such a system and it
[1:15:52] failed every time due to human greed and
[1:15:56] lack of Holy Spirit brother random told
[1:15:59] some dear friends this will not work it
[1:16:02] didn't fail that day but 10 years later
[1:16:05] blew
[1:16:07] up so verse 11 fear Came Upon them they
[1:16:09] perked
[1:16:11] up verse 12-6 we have the ministry of
[1:16:14] Miracles to the hands of the Apostles
[1:16:16] draw uh you know opposite responses the
[1:16:20] make Believers and the unbelievers don't
[1:16:22] mess with those guys leave them alone
[1:16:24] but the Believers flocked to the me they
[1:16:26] flocked to the meetings they brought the
[1:16:28] sick and Afflicted in 5 and 16 here and
[1:16:31] there came also a multitude out of the
[1:16:33] Cities round about Jerusalem bringing
[1:16:35] sick folk and them that were vexed with
[1:16:37] unclean spirits and they were healed
[1:16:39] everyone there was
[1:16:41] Deliverance things were happening you
[1:16:44] see so the first persecution was back in
[1:16:47] chapter 4 and the disciples spent a
[1:16:49] night in jail they were warned now from
[1:16:52] now on do not speak in that
[1:16:55] name you go back and read it par
[1:16:58] paralyzed man man was born wrong he was
[1:17:01] he was healed and um but throughout the
[1:17:04] whole book The the what people couldn't
[1:17:07] put up with that
[1:17:10] name that's been that's been the problem
[1:17:12] all through these 2,000
[1:17:14] years yeah don't use that name the
[1:17:18] Catholic Church didn't want people to
[1:17:19] get in and read the Bible it was a sin
[1:17:22] to have a Bible years ago
[1:17:25] oh we'll tell you what it means and we
[1:17:27] got the same organized religion today
[1:17:30] we'll tell you what state did here we'll
[1:17:33] tell you what wait a minute that sounds
[1:17:36] familiar you know so we got to be
[1:17:39] careful okay so they let him go and um
[1:17:44] and so when they uh when they went to
[1:17:47] their place see in verse 17 I'm sorry I
[1:17:50] got to get ahead of myself here a little
[1:17:51] bit but they warned him don't don't
[1:17:53] speak in that name so after all this
[1:17:55] Deliverance is going on all these people
[1:17:56] are being healed there's you know glory
[1:17:59] in the camp then the high priest the man
[1:18:03] that knew the
[1:18:04] scriptures the man that had it all
[1:18:06] figured
[1:18:07] out and those that are with him so he
[1:18:10] had this Entourage you know Sadducees
[1:18:14] they were filled with indignation people
[1:18:16] are being healed people are being
[1:18:17] delivered lives are being changed and
[1:18:19] they're upset because it didn't come
[1:18:21] through their little
[1:18:22] Channel see
[1:18:24] they laid their hands on that means they
[1:18:26] grabbed them and put them in prison
[1:18:29] verse 19 but the angel of the Lord
[1:18:31] opened the prison doors and brought them
[1:18:33] out huh and says go to the temple and
[1:18:38] speak to the people the words of this
[1:18:40] life go preach to the people it's
[1:18:43] okay and
[1:18:45] um and so this this religious leader
[1:18:48] Sadducees it's a Jewish denomination
[1:18:50] they're not all the same over there okay
[1:18:52] they got they got they're all divided up
[1:18:53] just like the Baptist
[1:18:55] just like romit okay
[1:18:58] sorry and these people they denied
[1:19:00] Angels they denied Miracles denied
[1:19:02] Resurrection Supernatural what do you
[1:19:04] got left you got a few words on page
[1:19:06] it's all you got left so 18 they go
[1:19:09] straight to jail
[1:19:11] 19 angel opens the doors be strong go
[1:19:15] speak to at the temple preach the
[1:19:17] message of the hour so they went
[1:19:20] immediately had a sunrise service and um
[1:19:23] meanwhile the high high priest all his
[1:19:25] people got the cabinet together
[1:19:27] everybody had their donuts and
[1:19:28] everything's good okay got them all
[1:19:30] together now they send the guy over to
[1:19:32] get the prisoners we're going to take
[1:19:33] care of this business and of course
[1:19:35] verse 22 right but when the officers
[1:19:39] came they found nobody in the prison huh
[1:19:43] came back and told them yeah verse 23 uh
[1:19:46] you know we found the prison shut safely
[1:19:50] and the keepers at their po post of Duty
[1:19:53] but there's no prisoners huh got a
[1:19:56] problem so now 24 he's really upset how
[1:19:59] can this happen we got to investigate we
[1:20:01] got to form a commission you know and in
[1:20:03] 25 they get the news
[1:20:05] flash those preachers that you locked up
[1:20:08] over there last night they're over there
[1:20:10] teaching the
[1:20:11] people we got a serious
[1:20:14] problem so they're arrested nicely and
[1:20:17] you know they didn't because the
[1:20:18] officers they didn't want to get stoned
[1:20:20] the people are paying attention they
[1:20:21] they love what they're hearing now
[1:20:23] they're going to take the preachers away
[1:20:24] real nicely let's go over and have some
[1:20:26] coffee you know come over here with us
[1:20:28] because if they did it roughly they get
[1:20:30] stoned in a
[1:20:32] minute
[1:20:34] well the church was growing it was 120
[1:20:38] now in 241 it's 3,000 in 247 added to
[1:20:41] the church daily such as should be saved
[1:20:44] in chapter 4 and verse4 about 5,000 more
[1:20:48] that's quite an increase that's all just
[1:20:50] first few months there you know in 5:14
[1:20:54] God's moving powerfully with the
[1:20:56] apostles things were happening and the
[1:20:58] religious leaders were taking notice
[1:21:00] well obviously you know so here they are
[1:21:02] again verse
[1:21:04] 28 and there uh did not we straightly
[1:21:07] command you that you should not teach in
[1:21:09] this name see there's the problem we
[1:21:12] don't care what effects I don't care
[1:21:14] what you say don't use that
[1:21:18] name we got the same thing going on
[1:21:20] today we got people yeah brother Bram
[1:21:22] said what what how's that fit into the
[1:21:25] big picture what did Jesus say about all
[1:21:27] this so we got we got the conflict see
[1:21:30] don't use that name the same
[1:21:34] thing yeah don't use that name and
[1:21:36] behold you filled Jerusalem with your
[1:21:38] Doctrine and intend to bring this man's
[1:21:40] blood on us well who did
[1:21:44] it obviously you well so the inspired
[1:21:49] response and Peter and the apostles they
[1:21:51] said well we ought to obey God rather
[1:21:53] than you guys the god of our fathers
[1:21:55] raised up Jesus whom you hanged on a
[1:21:59] tree him hath God exalted with his right
[1:22:01] hand to be Prince and savior for to give
[1:22:04] repentance to Israel and forgiveness of
[1:22:06] sins because he was sent to his own only
[1:22:09] the house of Israel the beginning see
[1:22:11] and we Are Witnesses of these things and
[1:22:15] so is also the Holy Ghost whom God ha
[1:22:17] given to those to them who obey him and
[1:22:20] there's the only place you'll find that
[1:22:21] in the Bible you obey you'll receive the
[1:22:23] Holy Ghost right
[1:22:25] simple
[1:22:26] okay
[1:22:28] so their message was very positive it
[1:22:32] was factual was about God's power God's
[1:22:35] plan and Peter spoke it with love he
[1:22:39] didn't slander disrespect the
[1:22:40] authorities he wasn't Arrogant with the
[1:22:43] message of Christ and we've seen I've
[1:22:45] seen a lot of that and if you listen
[1:22:47] closely to William brandham on no tape
[1:22:51] anywhere does he appear arrogant or does
[1:22:55] he blast those who don't see it his way
[1:22:58] no you
[1:22:59] see so when people heard this mini
[1:23:03] sermon let's go over and see what Dr Lon
[1:23:06] says about this acts 5
[1:23:10] and33 as you look at it on the screen
[1:23:12] there see we find it here real quick 5
[1:23:16] and33 it says here and when they heard
[1:23:19] these words they were enraged and
[1:23:21] thought to murder the apostles see it's
[1:23:24] a little more hot sauce on the in
[1:23:26] chilava
[1:23:27] there
[1:23:29] yeah yeah so then Professor Galeo stood
[1:23:33] up and he asked that the apostles be
[1:23:35] taken outside we got to talk about this
[1:23:36] you know he says you guys ought to be
[1:23:40] careful and he gives a couple of
[1:23:42] examples of the past in 5 and 36 he
[1:23:46] gives brings to their
[1:23:47] attention you know was too long ago we
[1:23:50] had this guy named theudas boasting that
[1:23:53] he was really somebody
[1:23:55] and a number of men now 400 joined
[1:23:58] themselves yeah we're going to follow
[1:23:58] this man he was
[1:24:01] killed and as many as obeyed him were
[1:24:03] scattered and it came to
[1:24:06] zero and then there was other one here
[1:24:08] you know it also was dispersed now I say
[1:24:12] refrain from the be careful don't touch
[1:24:15] these guys leave them alone if this is a
[1:24:18] work of men it'll come to nothing you're
[1:24:21] wish and your efforts but if it be of
[1:24:23] God you can't overthrow it you'll be
[1:24:26] fighting
[1:24:27] God and
[1:24:29] so they um they said well okay if we
[1:24:33] have to they called in the preachers
[1:24:36] they beat him up a little
[1:24:38] bit they agreed and verse 40 and called
[1:24:42] in the apostles they beat them okay and
[1:24:45] commanded they should not speak in the
[1:24:47] name of Jesus and let him go see that's
[1:24:50] the key to the whole book don't speak in
[1:24:52] that name so anything today that
[1:24:56] separates your Revelation or your
[1:24:58] teaching from the name of Jesus
[1:25:00] Christ it's
[1:25:02] foolishness it's a waste of
[1:25:05] time God is not the author of
[1:25:08] confusion so I don't care how many books
[1:25:10] they're carrying how many Bible if it's
[1:25:12] confusion go the other way because you
[1:25:15] can't change
[1:25:17] people brother B says we got pennies
[1:25:20] nickels dimes quarters half dollars and
[1:25:22] silver dollar each one is working at
[1:25:25] their maximum capacity that's right
[1:25:29] okay they're not going to change leave
[1:25:32] them
[1:25:33] alone
[1:25:35] okay so the Antichrist spirit is still
[1:25:37] alive
[1:25:39] today and we have ministers today not
[1:25:42] too far from where you're sitting that
[1:25:44] are constantly removing the deity out of
[1:25:48] the name of Jesus Christ they're putting
[1:25:51] it over here putting it over there and
[1:25:52] when you do you got a problem
[1:25:55] okay they're left without power so these
[1:25:57] people left the courtroom rejoicing that
[1:26:00] they were encountered worthy to suffer
[1:26:02] some dishonor on the account of the
[1:26:05] mighty name of Jesus
[1:26:06] Christ 5 and 42 and daily in the temple
[1:26:11] and in every house they cease not to
[1:26:13] teach and preach Jesus Christ that's why
[1:26:16] we're in business today we constantly
[1:26:18] are on the same
[1:26:20] theme now the pope who's about ready to
[1:26:23] expire has said Martin Luther that's
[1:26:26] over no Martin Luther is not over I'm on
[1:26:28] Luther's side the protest is still
[1:26:32] on okay yes sir so these people had
[1:26:35] trials they had relatives just like we
[1:26:37] have and their ministers preached to you
[1:26:40] know mixed crowds only in heaven will
[1:26:43] there not be any make Believers and
[1:26:45] unbelievers and if you'll notice when
[1:26:47] you read the book of Acts we don't find
[1:26:49] anybody repeating the red letter words
[1:26:52] of Jesus from the the four gospels they
[1:26:55] were living out their gospel they were
[1:26:57] it was just automatic living it out and
[1:27:00] um they weren't repeating the words of
[1:27:03] the commission of M Matthew 28:19 they
[1:27:06] moved out into the deep Waters of
[1:27:09] Revelation and just obeyed what Jesus
[1:27:12] said so we're going to face
[1:27:15] persecutions it's not going to be a
[1:27:16] broken fingernail no it's going to be
[1:27:18] something serious see and um but
[1:27:21] there'll be those that will genuinely
[1:27:23] suffer for the name of Jesus Christ okay
[1:27:27] let's go into verse chapter 6 nobody's
[1:27:30] in a hurry you know if you didn't eat
[1:27:32] breakfast it's not my problem but you
[1:27:35] see six and seven are um they kind of go
[1:27:39] together and in verse one of chapter 6
[1:27:43] and in those days when the number of the
[1:27:45] disciples was multiplied okay so all you
[1:27:47] math geniuses no there's
[1:27:49] adding and then subtracting but
[1:27:53] multiplying he gets big
[1:27:57] right there were murmurings of the
[1:27:59] grecians against the Hebrews because
[1:28:00] their widows were neglected in the daily
[1:28:03] ministration so disputes came up because
[1:28:07] of some of the people some of the widows
[1:28:09] were not receiving proper attention they
[1:28:11] needed some
[1:28:13] balance so there was the native born
[1:28:15] Jews and there was s the Jews that
[1:28:18] immigrated from other countries such as
[1:28:21] uh the ones from Athens and so forth
[1:28:24] and the widows depended on assistance
[1:28:26] from the local church and so the
[1:28:28] apostles had to Institute Church order
[1:28:31] some practical ideas for current
[1:28:33] situations real simple so these
[1:28:36] assistants they said now look we got
[1:28:38] some problems here you'all need to find
[1:28:39] seven men out there that have these
[1:28:41] qualifications in verse
[1:28:43] three um there got to be seven men of
[1:28:47] honest report full of the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:49] wisdom whom we may appoint over this
[1:28:53] business so their first assignment was
[1:28:55] social work now you have you have a
[1:28:58] picnic here once in a while right yeah
[1:29:01] and and who cleans up the
[1:29:04] mess pastor's wife right pastor's
[1:29:06] children well because people don't pick
[1:29:08] up their mess I mean in John chapter 6
[1:29:12] everybody got all the free food they
[1:29:14] wanted from two little you know was
[1:29:18] three fishes and two
[1:29:19] loes but they were sorry just like us
[1:29:22] they left trash on the floor the
[1:29:24] apostles had to go clean it up so here's
[1:29:26] these Apostles these
[1:29:28] disciples and their first job was Social
[1:29:30] Work cleaning up after a lunch and so
[1:29:33] some of them went on to active work in
[1:29:35] the ministry okay and U in chapter 6 and
[1:29:38] verse 7 says and the word of the Lord
[1:29:41] increased and the number of the
[1:29:42] disciples multiplied there it is again
[1:29:44] in Jerusalem greatly and a great company
[1:29:47] of the priests were obedient to the
[1:29:48] faith these priests see everybody
[1:29:50] couldn't read they didn't have education
[1:29:52] like we have so the priests could read
[1:29:54] they'd studi the scriptures and now oh
[1:29:56] this is the Fulfillment so they were
[1:29:59] obedient to the faith okay so um in
[1:30:03] verse
[1:30:04] 8 and Stephen it's one of the seven that
[1:30:08] they elected here he's full of faith and
[1:30:10] power great wonders and miracles amongst
[1:30:12] the people sounds good
[1:30:15] uhuh um the people loved him he became
[1:30:18] the first Christian martyr because every
[1:30:21] Revival produces twins right twins
[1:30:24] aren't exactly the same in this case and
[1:30:27] so most of the people loved Steven God
[1:30:29] was using him and so forth but there
[1:30:31] were certain people that arose to
[1:30:33] dispute they were there to argue and God
[1:30:36] allows people in the local church that
[1:30:39] are not just you know obedient Lambs
[1:30:42] they're there to
[1:30:44] argue probably not in this church but
[1:30:46] some others I've been in they're there
[1:30:48] for the pastor's
[1:30:52] Perfection so here they are arguing with
[1:30:54] the man of God and when they couldn't
[1:30:55] out argue him in verse
[1:30:58] 10
[1:31:01] uh verse 11 then they suborned that
[1:31:03] means they paid money to these rednecks
[1:31:06] out
[1:31:08] here to say we've heard him say
[1:31:10] Blasphemous words against Moses and
[1:31:12] against God which was a lie but they
[1:31:14] would receive money so you know no
[1:31:16] problem so they paid this money in verse
[1:31:20] um uh 11 and the 12 and they stirred up
[1:31:23] the people and and the elders and the
[1:31:24] scribes and came upon him caught him and
[1:31:28] brought him to the council H and they
[1:31:31] set up false Witnesses this man ceases
[1:31:34] not to speak Blasphemous words against
[1:31:36] this holy place so there all these lies
[1:31:39] you know so based on these allegations
[1:31:41] the religious police grabbed him and
[1:31:43] they set up their false Witnesses
[1:31:44] bringing confusing allegations and um
[1:31:48] and what is a accusation repeating
[1:31:52] misquotations just just Chang it a
[1:31:54] little bit you know little pieces of
[1:31:57] message in wrong order misplaced out of
[1:31:59] Harmony yeah goes on today they set up
[1:32:03] false Witnesses verse 14 for we have
[1:32:06] heard him say this Jesus of Nazareth
[1:32:08] shall destroy this place and change the
[1:32:10] customs of
[1:32:11] Moses and all that sat in the council
[1:32:14] are looking at this one man and saw the
[1:32:17] face as it had been the face of an Angel
[1:32:20] well if that's the case why aren't they
[1:32:22] on their knees
[1:32:25] yeah all this stuff you said but here's
[1:32:26] a man looks like an angel well what's
[1:32:29] going on so then the high priest says to
[1:32:34] uh brother Stephen uh are these things
[1:32:36] true so he gives them the microphone
[1:32:40] aha hope you got a lunch because when
[1:32:42] you give the preacher a
[1:32:44] microphone you probably had a few
[1:32:47] preachers through here like that
[1:32:49] right not me and so um and so he said
[1:32:53] men and
[1:32:54] Brethren fathers hearken and so from
[1:32:58] there he launches into the deep water
[1:33:01] and it was God's way of refocusing the
[1:33:03] attention of the Believers away from
[1:33:05] Jerusalem now read it carefully because
[1:33:07] it's all 50 verses and um uh this it's a
[1:33:12] history lesson he makes four major
[1:33:14] points verse 2 through 8 the founding of
[1:33:17] the Hebrew Nation didn't occur in
[1:33:18] Jerusalem but out in Mesopotamia all
[1:33:20] about Abraham okay amen they could agree
[1:33:23] to that 9 through 37 all about the
[1:33:26] Patriarchs all about Moses The
[1:33:28] Liberation of God's people didn't C
[1:33:30] Jerusalem out in other places Egypt the
[1:33:31] Red Sea the Wilderness yeah that's
[1:33:34] true in verse 38 the law was not given
[1:33:37] in Jerusalem but out in the desert and
[1:33:39] we can all agree to
[1:33:40] that vers 39-50 all about the idolatry
[1:33:44] of the Hebrews out in the desert the
[1:33:47] building of the Temple look at verse 47
[1:33:50] of chapter 7 says here but Solomon built
[1:33:54] him a house how be it the most high
[1:33:55] dwelleth not in temples made of hands as
[1:33:58] saith the prophet and he quotes the
[1:34:00] scriptures and down here in verse 50
[1:34:03] hath not my hand made all these things
[1:34:06] but God doesn't live in a temple and
[1:34:08] physical building but over here in in
[1:34:10] the in the lamza Bible in verse 51 he
[1:34:13] gives them a final blast verse 51 it
[1:34:16] says here oh you stubborn and insincere
[1:34:20] in heart and hearing you always resist
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost as your father so do you
[1:34:26] 52 which of the prophets have not your
[1:34:28] fathers persecuted and murdered
[1:34:30] especially have you slain those who
[1:34:32] foretold the coming of the righteous one
[1:34:34] whom you betrayed and murdered you
[1:34:37] received the law of of disposition of
[1:34:39] angels and have not kept it so it gets
[1:34:43] really really serious you know so this
[1:34:46] view of History by Revelation brought to
[1:34:49] a real boil the growing conflict between
[1:34:52] the new religious movement and the city
[1:34:54] fathers verse 54 chapter
[1:34:57] 7 when they heard these things they were
[1:34:59] enraged and nashed their teeth at him
[1:35:02] we're going to get him but he full of
[1:35:04] faith and the Holy Spirit looked up to
[1:35:06] heaven yeah right through the
[1:35:08] ceiling and saw the glory of God and
[1:35:10] Jesus standing at the right hand of God
[1:35:12] and he said behold I see the heavens
[1:35:13] open and the son of man standing at the
[1:35:16] right hand of God then they cried out
[1:35:18] with a loud voice and stopped their ears
[1:35:20] with one Accord and shouted threats
[1:35:22] against stepen and They seized him they
[1:35:25] took him out of the city and began to
[1:35:27] Stone him with big sharp rocks and those
[1:35:31] that testified against him placed their
[1:35:33] clothes under the care of a young man
[1:35:37] called Saul and they swn Steven as he
[1:35:39] prayed saying Lord Jesus accept my
[1:35:42] spirit and as he knelt down he cried
[1:35:45] with a loud voice and said our Lord do
[1:35:47] not hold this sin against them and when
[1:35:50] he said this he passed away first Christ
[1:35:53] Christian martyr that's our
[1:35:57] brother and if you haven't seen it you
[1:35:59] need to
[1:36:00] find the movie called Paul Apostle of
[1:36:03] Jesus Christ it tells all this In Living
[1:36:06] Color very important okay we're going to
[1:36:09] go a little bit farther so here we go in
[1:36:12] chapter 8 because it's not even
[1:36:14] lunchtime yet um chapter 8 here we got
[1:36:18] the first mention of Saul at the end of
[1:36:20] chapter 7 he witnessed the death of
[1:36:23] Steven
[1:36:24] first martyr he was probably too young
[1:36:26] to participate because he was a Pharisee
[1:36:29] in training okay but what he saw right
[1:36:32] there was stamped in his mind he never
[1:36:34] forgot it he he didn't throw any rocks
[1:36:37] but he was one of the persecutors what
[1:36:40] did they hate they hated the
[1:36:42] manifestation of God's word in present
[1:36:44] tense it's okay to quote yeah there was
[1:36:48] an ark and there was David and all these
[1:36:50] things but don't bring it down to
[1:36:52] present tense handle that no no God's
[1:36:56] back there and there's going to be a
[1:36:58] millennium there's going to be streets
[1:36:59] of gold what about today where is God
[1:37:03] today so that's what they hated
[1:37:05] manifestation of God's word in present
[1:37:07] tense
[1:37:09] so fine for the history but no
[1:37:13] fulfillment of manifestation of the
[1:37:15] truth just say what he said I get so
[1:37:18] tired of hearing
[1:37:19] that you want to say what he said I can
[1:37:22] bring up some stuff how many of you have
[1:37:24] any idea uh we know what I mean this is
[1:37:27] just trivia really but we know that the
[1:37:30] photograph was taken in Houston Texas in
[1:37:32] January 1950 right
[1:37:35] okay the man that examined it was a
[1:37:38] freelance he didn't actually belong to
[1:37:40] the FBI but he was freelance his name
[1:37:43] was George J
[1:37:45] Lacy does anybody know what color his
[1:37:48] hair was have you ever
[1:37:50] heard it's all in it's just like these
[1:37:52] details in
[1:37:54] there had red hair
[1:37:58] so let's say what he
[1:38:01] said okay but we got to be balanced you
[1:38:05] see the Pharisees were the religious
[1:38:08] Elite of Judaism the people that did
[1:38:10] believe in Resurrection Supernatural but
[1:38:13] they were very
[1:38:14] self-righteous you probably haven't seen
[1:38:16] anybody like that but I have okay they
[1:38:19] were the only ones that were really
[1:38:21] right Revelation was the last thing on
[1:38:23] the mind everything had to be letter
[1:38:26] perfect today we call them legalists now
[1:38:29] the Sadducees were the other ones who
[1:38:31] didn't believe any of this but you see
[1:38:33] this is the fourth persecution 8 chapter
[1:38:36] 1 and Saul was consenting unto his death
[1:38:39] so he was in agreement to Steven's death
[1:38:42] and at that time there was great
[1:38:43] persecution against the church which was
[1:38:45] at Jerusalem and they were all scattered
[1:38:47] abroad throughout the regions of Judea
[1:38:49] and Samaria except the apostles
[1:38:54] okay and
[1:38:56] so with this death of
[1:39:00] stepen chapter 1:8 you shall go it comes
[1:39:05] into sharper Focus oh that's what it's
[1:39:06] going to happen yeah they're going to
[1:39:08] kill us we stay here so they start
[1:39:10] moving out you see this is several years
[1:39:13] after chapter 1 and they're all still at
[1:39:16] Jerusalem and um so it took persecution
[1:39:20] to move the Lord's people into action so
[1:39:23] the gospel is leaving Jerusalem it's all
[1:39:26] part of the larger picture and so
[1:39:28] Pharisees Saul was one of the main
[1:39:30] troublemakers instigator bringing
[1:39:32] persecution to the early church verse
[1:39:35] three as for Saul he made Havoc of the
[1:39:39] church entering into every house
[1:39:41] inhaling men and women committed them to
[1:39:43] prison the translation is that he was
[1:39:46] going from house to house if he saw the
[1:39:48] little sign of the fish on the wall or
[1:39:51] uh a cross h
[1:39:54] no M no problem profiling out of
[1:39:57] here out of here that's what that movie
[1:39:59] shows too and so um in his own words you
[1:40:03] know he tells about this in Galatians
[1:40:05] 1:13 so Havoc means trouble confusion
[1:40:08] and God is not the author of confusion
[1:40:11] okay so after the death of judas's
[1:40:14] scariot the church leaders chose maias
[1:40:16] he was probably a good believer probably
[1:40:18] paid TI he's probably a good man but he
[1:40:20] never did anything now God's choice
[1:40:24] was not what we would choose brother
[1:40:26] Brown says if it was up to us Americans
[1:40:28] we would have never chose Paul forget it
[1:40:32] God's choosing was a short hook-nosed
[1:40:35] sarcastic high-tempered Jew who had been
[1:40:38] killing
[1:40:40] Christians okay he's the one Dragon
[1:40:43] converts into court jail death they were
[1:40:48] people just like
[1:40:50] us killed for following Jesus and it's
[1:40:54] happening today in certain places okay
[1:40:57] they were walking in the light that God
[1:40:59] provided but later when he was converted
[1:41:02] God used him in a marvelous way even to
[1:41:04] be responsible for a large Port portion
[1:41:07] of the New Testament much later when he
[1:41:09] was you know preaching the word openly
[1:41:11] when he was accused falsely this is Saul
[1:41:14] later see Saul was his Hebrew name Paul
[1:41:17] would have been his Roman
[1:41:19] name when he was confessed he said to
[1:41:22] the authorities this I confess after the
[1:41:25] way those guys call heresy that's the
[1:41:27] way I worship god of my fathers
[1:41:29] believing all things which are written
[1:41:31] in the law and the prophets they call us
[1:41:34] Believers we're not just believing you
[1:41:36] know one part we believe the whole Bible
[1:41:39] just like it's written okay so these
[1:41:42] early Believers could have
[1:41:45] compromised they could have chosen
[1:41:47] easier path no resistance no criticism
[1:41:50] you know hold hands with the original
[1:41:52] with the the leaders but Martin Luther
[1:41:55] said Christ Alone we're not going to
[1:41:57] count beads we're not going to worship
[1:41:59] idols we're not going to burn candles
[1:42:00] we're going to follow Christ you know
[1:42:02] and so that's why we're still on the
[1:42:04] side of Martin Luther so in verse four
[1:42:07] they took off everywhere preaching the
[1:42:08] word the apostles state in Jerusalem now
[1:42:12] they weren't all preachers they were
[1:42:13] people just like you but as they lived
[1:42:15] their gospel in these other areas it was
[1:42:18] showing the way of God you see they
[1:42:21] weren't preachers just part of the way
[1:42:24] living out their testimony like Francis
[1:42:26] said preach always use words when
[1:42:30] necessary so these were the first
[1:42:32] missionaries as they traveled far away
[1:42:34] yeah they went to Lebanon 120 Mi North
[1:42:37] they sailed all the way to Cyprus 150 Mi
[1:42:39] they went up to turkey with Antioch 300
[1:42:43] miles but in verse 5 of chapter 8 we
[1:42:45] have uh Philip he's one of the helpers
[1:42:48] of chapter
[1:42:49] 6 and um he was in we'll say a tent
[1:42:54] meeting up in Samaria 50 miles north of
[1:42:56] Jerusalem he's having a great Revival
[1:42:58] things are happening many people are
[1:43:01] healed there great joy and but
[1:43:04] every every Revival produces twins so
[1:43:08] there's a man there in town called Simon
[1:43:10] the Sorcerer he's a magician he worked
[1:43:12] from the Dark Side very involved in the
[1:43:15] oult and in verse 9 giving out that he
[1:43:17] was some great one yeah false
[1:43:19] advertising you know obsessed with power
[1:43:22] and selfy importance and the people even
[1:43:24] said well this man that's a great power
[1:43:27] of God and he had followers yeah no one
[1:43:31] seem to criticize him but rather they
[1:43:33] they uh you know marvel at his
[1:43:36] importance but God wasn't part of his
[1:43:38] picture if God's not part of the picture
[1:43:41] it's a wrong picture see so when but
[1:43:43] then when the people heard the preaching
[1:43:45] of the word and the name of Jesus Christ
[1:43:48] signs and wonders over here at Philip's
[1:43:49] tent meeting many believed many many
[1:43:51] were baptized even Simon yeah where we
[1:43:54] at verse
[1:43:56] 13 then Simon himself believed also when
[1:43:59] he was baptized uhuh continued with
[1:44:02] Philip and wondered beholding the
[1:44:04] Miracles and signs which were done so
[1:44:07] he's been baptized and um uh and then
[1:44:13] when when Philip saw the success of the
[1:44:15] meeting he calls Peter and John down to
[1:44:16] lay hands on these people for the Holy
[1:44:18] Ghost you know so when Mr Simon saw the
[1:44:21] the result of laying on of hands
[1:44:24] he offered them money hey maybe I can
[1:44:27] buy this magic
[1:44:28] trick yeah verse 19 give me also this
[1:44:31] power that on whomsoever I Lay My Hands
[1:44:34] he may receive the Holy Ghost so he's
[1:44:36] still the same old Simon see the water
[1:44:38] didn't didn't change him no I can help
[1:44:41] you guys of course his ministry wouldn't
[1:44:43] be for free either so he heard the truth
[1:44:46] he was baptized he wanted to be part of
[1:44:48] the move of God but he just couldn't
[1:44:50] detach himself from the old Simon
[1:44:53] you see so God granted a preacher of the
[1:44:57] Gospel to shake him into reality Peter
[1:45:00] said verse 20 thy money perish with thee
[1:45:04] because thou Hast thought that the gift
[1:45:06] of God may be purchased with money you
[1:45:09] have neither lot nor um part in this
[1:45:12] ministry your heart isn't right with God
[1:45:15] repent therefore of this thy wickedness
[1:45:19] and pray God perhaps thought of thine
[1:45:20] heart may be forgiven thee
[1:45:23] so he asked for prayer we don't know
[1:45:25] what happened to him after that so right
[1:45:27] in the midst of this great Revival
[1:45:29] amongst the Samaritans north of
[1:45:32] Jerusalem the angel of the Lord appears
[1:45:34] to to Philip the preacher verse
[1:45:38] 26 he said arise other words get up go
[1:45:42] towards the South which would be
[1:45:44] Southwest uh the road that goes down
[1:45:46] from Jerusalem into Gaza you ever heard
[1:45:48] of that yeah every day in the news right
[1:45:50] now Gaza is hot
[1:45:54] still
[1:45:55] there and he didn't explain he just said
[1:45:57] get up and go see Prophet says God
[1:46:00] doesn't tell His prophets everything you
[1:46:02] just got to obey walk by faith okay so
[1:46:07] he's going down to Gaza he's there all
[1:46:09] of a sudden now this is called time
[1:46:11] travel because it's 70 miles away they
[1:46:14] didn't have SUV like we have he's
[1:46:16] walking boom he's there okay verse
[1:46:20] 27 and he arose and went and behold a
[1:46:23] man of Ethiopia a unic of great
[1:46:25] Authority Under Candace queen of
[1:46:28] Ethiopians who had the charge of all her
[1:46:30] treasure had come to Jerusalem to
[1:46:33] worship okay that's one simple sentence
[1:46:36] but let's open it
[1:46:38] up the fact
[1:46:40] is that he's an important man he's a
[1:46:43] Believer he's a black man he's unmarried
[1:46:45] he's officer of the royal household is's
[1:46:47] actually The Treasure of the kingdom of
[1:46:51] Ethiopia now this is the book of acts
[1:46:53] way back in the time of Solomon the
[1:46:55] Queen of Sheba came up to
[1:46:57] worship and she saw she believed and she
[1:47:00] took that religion back to her
[1:47:02] people until this day there's been the
[1:47:05] Hebrew religion in Ethiopia you see and
[1:47:09] so this man had been up to the temple to
[1:47:12] worship he's coming back he had a real
[1:47:15] nice Chariot had a nice horse he's a you
[1:47:17] know
[1:47:19] politician and uh he's W he's going
[1:47:22] along and he's reading out of the spoken
[1:47:24] word book of
[1:47:26] Isaiah all of a sudden here's Philip
[1:47:28] walking alongside the
[1:47:29] Chariot uhhuh he's not questioning he's
[1:47:33] just
[1:47:33] obedient and um so he's walking along hi
[1:47:37] you understand what you're
[1:47:39] reading yeah
[1:47:42] 8:31 and he said how can I except some
[1:47:45] some man should guide me and he desired
[1:47:47] Philip to come up and sit with him so
[1:47:49] now Philip preacher is in the nice
[1:47:51] Chariot with the black man
[1:47:53] going along mhm and um and so 32 in the
[1:48:00] place in the scripture he was reading he
[1:48:02] was led as a sheep to the slaughter and
[1:48:04] so forth and
[1:48:07] 34 uh I pray the who's the prophet
[1:48:10] speaking himself or someone else aha so
[1:48:13] now he gives the microphone to
[1:48:16] Phillip and he starts right there
[1:48:19] preaching Christ because that's all they
[1:48:21] knew they didn't know about all the
[1:48:23] Fulfillment they didn't have you know
[1:48:25] iPhones and communication like we have
[1:48:28] but they were true to what they
[1:48:30] knew that's right and so he's he starts
[1:48:33] right there and he got as far as water
[1:48:36] baptism and so the the the unic well man
[1:48:39] if all this is true there's water if you
[1:48:42] believe so they stop the Chariot they go
[1:48:46] down baptizes the man they come out of
[1:48:49] the water and Philip disappears
[1:48:53] time travel now he's way over in this
[1:48:54] other place to another kind of people
[1:48:57] and then over here he's finally back at
[1:48:59] cesaria I think it is so all in one day
[1:49:02] three different kinds of people yeah
[1:49:05] right there in your Bible we're not
[1:49:07] making it up well chapter nine will'll
[1:49:11] be done I know you're about to
[1:49:13] starve so we got
[1:49:16] Saul a young fiery Pharisee legalist
[1:49:21] filled with hatred and murder against
[1:49:23] the Disciples of our Lord he persecuted
[1:49:26] the new Believers our brothers and
[1:49:27] sisters he was totally faithful to what
[1:49:30] he
[1:49:31] believed traditions of the fathers and I
[1:49:35] can show you on taper brother Ram says
[1:49:37] and we make a tradition of Martin Luther
[1:49:40] John Wesley and other men huh wonder who
[1:49:43] those other men could be it's happening
[1:49:45] while you're sitting here they're making
[1:49:47] contradition out of the life of William
[1:49:48] brandom and God is no part of it sorry
[1:49:51] that's right
[1:49:53] so he didn't wait around for orders he
[1:49:56] begged for arrest warrants anyone
[1:49:58] faintly associated with the way could be
[1:50:01] arrested brought back to headquarters in
[1:50:03] Jerusalem and so people took off seeking
[1:50:06] more you know peaceful surroundings this
[1:50:09] could have been four years after the
[1:50:10] resurrection and God allowed these
[1:50:13] persecutions in order that they would
[1:50:15] scatter to the end of the Earth okay and
[1:50:19] um a lot of times you might not
[1:50:21] understand how God is going to
[1:50:22] accomplish certain things because they
[1:50:24] had no idea okay to the end of the Earth
[1:50:27] how they were like us so we we worry
[1:50:30] about how God's going to accomplish
[1:50:31] things but remember the sign says in
[1:50:35] Psalm 4610 be still I'm God got to
[1:50:39] figure it out don't need your
[1:50:40] opinions God is in charge all he wants
[1:50:44] is your obedience so young
[1:50:47] Saul um government you know zealous
[1:50:51] government agent looking for those not
[1:50:53] complying with with the rules no regard
[1:50:56] for human rights no problem profiling if
[1:50:58] you even look like you're part of the
[1:50:59] way out of here so his journey is
[1:51:03] interrupted by divine intervention verse
[1:51:05] three and he tells this story in
[1:51:07] different pieces throughout the Book of
[1:51:09] Acts but we're going to put it all
[1:51:10] together for you today so he gets these
[1:51:12] arrest warrants to go get these people
[1:51:15] in Damascus that's 130 miles Northeast
[1:51:18] of
[1:51:20] Jerusalem and he's going along he's got
[1:51:23] some helpers with him it's about noon
[1:51:26] it's 100° in the Sun but all of a sudden
[1:51:29] about noon a much brighter light
[1:51:32] appears and it knocked them all off
[1:51:35] their horses it was so
[1:51:37] bright and so um now they're confused
[1:51:40] The Fearless Commander the Pharisee in
[1:51:43] charge of the anti-christian campaign is
[1:51:45] now faced down in the
[1:51:46] dirt uniforms all dirty and he seems
[1:51:50] like he's talking to himself we got to
[1:51:52] see serious problem they all Saw The
[1:51:54] Light they all fell off their horses and
[1:51:57] they all heard a sound but only Saul
[1:52:00] heard the voice in the Hebrew
[1:52:02] language Saul wh why are you persecuting
[1:52:06] me now he wasn't persecuting Jesus
[1:52:10] himself he wasn't there but he
[1:52:11] persecuting the people that look like
[1:52:12] him acting like
[1:52:14] him Lord who are you I am Jesus of
[1:52:17] Nazareth the one you've been persecuting
[1:52:20] and immediately he remembered St
[1:52:24] St that was always there he was totally
[1:52:28] disarmed helpless blind from the
[1:52:31] Brilliance and he had to yield
[1:52:34] completely so if you are one of God's
[1:52:36] elect CU I don't know who you are Pastor
[1:52:39] knows better than I do but you know who
[1:52:40] you are you know if you're following the
[1:52:43] truth or if you're just here looking for
[1:52:45] whatever but if you're one of God's
[1:52:47] elect he will hunt you down he doesn't
[1:52:50] care who you are what your ideas are he
[1:52:53] will find you right so he said what what
[1:52:56] do you want me to do I'm I'm I'm
[1:52:57] helpless I'm in the dirt arise get
[1:53:00] yourself on into Jerusalem into
[1:53:03] Damascus he had a glorious conversion
[1:53:05] verses 8 and N says here and Saul Rose
[1:53:08] from the earth chapter
[1:53:10] 9:8 and his eyes were opened he saw
[1:53:14] nobody and they let him by the hand
[1:53:16] brought him to
[1:53:17] Damascus and he was three days without
[1:53:19] sight and neither eat or
[1:53:21] drink now that right there is
[1:53:23] Supernatural you can't do that no just
[1:53:26] try
[1:53:27] it it doesn't work so supernatural's
[1:53:31] already taken hold get up I have a
[1:53:34] purpose for you I'll be with you it all
[1:53:35] comes down to faith in
[1:53:38] me you know all the traditions of the
[1:53:40] fathers you know but you got to have
[1:53:42] faith in Jesus Christ so God had a plan
[1:53:46] he wasn't disobedient to the heavenly
[1:53:47] vision he obeyed perfectly he stayed
[1:53:50] true he didn't compromise verse 9 verse
[1:53:54] 10 chapter 9: 10 and there was a certain
[1:53:57] disciple of Damascus named ananas and to
[1:54:00] him the Lord appeared in the vision
[1:54:02] ananas yes Lord I'm here and he said now
[1:54:06] look ananas I need you to get up and go
[1:54:08] down to the street called straight says
[1:54:10] right there and find the house of
[1:54:13] Judas there's one Saul of Tarsus he's in
[1:54:17] there
[1:54:18] praying and uh he's already seen in a
[1:54:21] vision that a man named anah that you is
[1:54:23] coming in putting his hands on him he
[1:54:26] might receive his sight an anas kind of
[1:54:29] like Peter argued now uh we've heard
[1:54:33] many things about this man what he's
[1:54:35] done to your Saints in Jerusalem and and
[1:54:38] he he's here under authority of the
[1:54:39] chief priest lord said get up and go
[1:54:43] he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my
[1:54:45] name before the Gentiles and kings and
[1:54:48] children of Israel I will show him how
[1:54:51] great things he must suff suffer for my
[1:54:53] name's
[1:54:54] sake very interesting why didn't God
[1:54:57] pick him up way back here when he was
[1:54:59] right after the death of Steven no he
[1:55:01] lets you go lets you go he's watching
[1:55:05] the whole time God doesn't always solve
[1:55:07] things the way you want it but he has a
[1:55:10] time for things you see so uh you know
[1:55:16] ananas property owner in chapter 5
[1:55:18] that's different so he goes to the
[1:55:20] address and
[1:55:23] he went his way in verse 17 entered into
[1:55:25] the house he found the house and puts
[1:55:27] his hand no no good morning nothing
[1:55:30] house everything no brother Saul that
[1:55:33] would be tough this is the man that
[1:55:35] killed Grandma now I got to put my hands
[1:55:37] on him brother
[1:55:44] Saul appeared to you on the on the way
[1:55:46] down here he sent me did you might
[1:55:48] receive your sight and immediately he
[1:55:51] could see
[1:55:53] and he arose and was baptized right
[1:55:57] now when he received this and when he
[1:56:00] had received meat okay they gave him
[1:56:02] lunch then was all certain days with the
[1:56:05] disciples at Damascus so all this is
[1:56:08] playing out see God already saw it's
[1:56:12] playing out God saw what you're going to
[1:56:15] do next week God saw all of our
[1:56:18] situations he knows what day the Rapture
[1:56:20] is going to be but it's got to play out
[1:56:22] that certain time and he's looking for
[1:56:24] faithful disciples he could look God can
[1:56:27] arrange he can put everything in order
[1:56:30] before
[1:56:31] 3:00 he lets it go on and on and he's
[1:56:34] watching the the reaction of the
[1:56:36] Believers so these things are not made
[1:56:39] up they're all part of God's plan and um
[1:56:44] he knows what he's doing you
[1:56:46] know yeah so I want you to read the book
[1:56:50] of Acts for yourself we're not going to
[1:56:51] read the whole thing for you but come
[1:56:53] back this evening we got some other
[1:56:55] important things that we're going to go
[1:56:57] into and maybe teach you something that
[1:56:59] you don't know you never know and um we
[1:57:03] trust that everybody will have a good
[1:57:06] lunch and remember the things we've
[1:57:08] taught you we'll leave this here for
[1:57:11] later but it's got a secondary purpose I
[1:57:14] told you about if I see anybody this
[1:57:17] afternoon trying to go to sleep
[1:57:23] that's good that's
[1:57:26] good for the
[1:57:28] [Applause]
[1:57:47] Samuel brother George and I have this
[1:57:49] kind of relationship so I know he won't
[1:57:51] mind but
[1:57:54] God God God has one of each of us and
[1:57:57] there's always a a uniqueness and and
[1:58:00] then God God knows what he's doing and
[1:58:02] there's all different all different ways
[1:58:05] manners in which God uses to to get
[1:58:08] forth his
[1:58:10] word that's the same thing within each
[1:58:12] of Our Lives you know I I really one
[1:58:17] thing I really enjoyed within it here
[1:58:20] this morning was a state statement
[1:58:22] brother George had made and
[1:58:24] said we are a church that's in
[1:58:28] progress and those are times this is why
[1:58:31] it's we see it within our families and
[1:58:34] everything else These are times where we
[1:58:36] have to revisit things at times have to
[1:58:39] kind of comb through things a little bit
[1:58:41] here and there but you know I'm glad God
[1:58:44] is faithful to that it's not based on
[1:58:46] what we see I I'd be
[1:58:48] honest if it wasn't for the Lord
[1:58:53] we wouldn't know what to do next and
[1:58:56] that was one of the things that a theme
[1:58:58] that we saw all the way through the book
[1:59:00] of Acts and you see all the way
[1:59:02] through God's not asking for big
[1:59:06] things a person could take and they will
[1:59:10] here in a few
[1:59:11] months there'll be people going through
[1:59:13] the streets I know they do it in the
[1:59:15] Philippines and other places they'll
[1:59:17] take wooden
[1:59:19] crosses and they'll actually even
[1:59:23] flag flog their backs their own
[1:59:26] backs many things that people will do
[1:59:30] and they do
[1:59:31] that with the best
[1:59:34] intentions people do don't do things to
[1:59:36] be wrong
[1:59:38] right but the only thing that God has
[1:59:41] ever asked of us is to
[1:59:46] believe to obey his word that's that's
[1:59:49] where there's Authority is when we obey
[1:59:51] his word or not it isn't that we have to
[1:59:54] have it all figured out we have to
[1:59:57] understand it it's just like if you show
[1:59:59] up at your job tomorrow and the boss
[2:00:00] asked you to do something you you have a
[2:00:03] choice whether or not you're going to go
[2:00:07] ahead and do that you may not understand
[2:00:08] it you might think it's hey I I think
[2:00:10] he's
[2:00:12] wrong but we know better because we we
[2:00:16] don't want to be on the unemployment
[2:00:17] line you know we might think it's wrong
[2:00:19] but we go ahead and go do it you know I
[2:00:21] don't think this but you know with with
[2:00:24] the Lord if we just Lord I'm obeying
[2:00:27] your word because you said
[2:00:30] it and that's the thing that when
[2:00:32] brother George opened up here
[2:00:34] today when the word was preached and God
[2:00:38] dealing with hearts and lives I just
[2:00:39] tell you that's what God is that's all
[2:00:42] he wants out of us is obedience and see
[2:00:46] obedience it starts in the heart when we
[2:00:48] look at obedience it starts from the
[2:00:50] heart it's an act in the heart that
[2:00:52] actually will show itself outwardly in
[2:00:54] our lives and I I think there's no
[2:00:57] greater thing that we could do
[2:00:59] continually in our lives is Lord let my
[2:01:01] heart be a place of
[2:01:04] sacrifice help me Lord give me the grace
[2:01:07] to sacrifice my own will my own ideas
[2:01:12] and let the word of God be preeminent
[2:01:15] let it be first place in my life I tell
[2:01:18] you what there's Witnesses throughout
[2:01:20] this building right here this
[2:01:22] morning this is in continuation the book
[2:01:25] of Acts and you
[2:01:27] know lives that we decisions that's had
[2:01:30] to be made and have been made but look
[2:01:32] at the results of it look at the peace
[2:01:36] look at the rest is there anyone here
[2:01:39] that's sad or upset that you've ever
[2:01:43] made a decision to serve the
[2:01:46] Lord I'll tell you this right here I was
[2:01:48] 19 years old I wish I wish I had
[2:01:53] continued
[2:01:54] on when I was a 13-year-old boy and I
[2:01:58] was laying there at an
[2:02:01] altar I wish I would have continued on
[2:02:05] because from that age from 13 to 19 a
[2:02:08] lot of scars on my
[2:02:09] life a lot of things that I wish that
[2:02:13] had not taken place but you
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:16] know God is rich in
[2:02:20] Mercy and if it was nothing nothing more
[2:02:22] than the Lord maybe to temper me out cuz
[2:02:25] God does God does things in such a such
[2:02:27] a way I'll tell you I can stand before
[2:02:31] you and I know there's others in this
[2:02:33] building to be able to say there's no
[2:02:36] situation there's no nothing no sin too
[2:02:40] great that the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:02:44] can't take care
[2:02:45] of any Witnesses on
[2:02:48] that I remember when God got a when he
[2:02:51] got a hold of in my life I I didn't
[2:02:52] think I could do it because I thought
[2:02:54] back to that time when I was 13 years
[2:02:55] old and it only lasted so long you know
[2:02:58] my mind I'm not going to I'm not going
[2:02:59] to swear I'm not going to do this I'm
[2:03:01] not going to do that and 13 years old
[2:03:02] you're out there among school I'm not
[2:03:04] going to do this and all of a sudden
[2:03:05] school would come back around and you're
[2:03:07] back in it again but you know what made
[2:03:10] that you say what made the difference
[2:03:11] brother Samuel was the blood of Jesus
[2:03:15] Christ when when you when you repent and
[2:03:18] that's obedience and you know it takes
[2:03:19] the takes the spirit of God to lead to
[2:03:23] that God did the work you know I never
[2:03:25] had to stop nothing I never did I'm just
[2:03:29] there's a there's a lot of things I
[2:03:30] could list out but I don't not going to
[2:03:32] list them out I didn't have to
[2:03:34] stop he came amen and a matter of fact
[2:03:37] he was the one when I was walking into a
[2:03:39] place down in
[2:03:40] sanduski working the second shift I was
[2:03:44] so worried about certain things now it
[2:03:46] had been weeks later and he came at that
[2:03:48] time I'm getting ready to come in second
[2:03:50] shift and and he spoke to me and he said
[2:03:52] I want you to notice I've changed your
[2:03:55] language yes amen right and I stopped
[2:03:59] and I thought when was the last time
[2:04:02] anything did come out of my mouth that
[2:04:03] was wrong I couldn't even
[2:04:05] remember
[2:04:08] so and understanding this we can you can
[2:04:12] have it's not about stopping this and
[2:04:13] stopping
[2:04:15] this it's just about serving
[2:04:17] him when he comes
[2:04:20] in he's the one that takes care of
[2:04:22] everything he takes care of that habits
[2:04:26] he takes care of it we could go

[2:05:19] our way we don't we don't want them we
[2:05:22] don't even we want to get out of them
[2:05:25] but you know God will take opportunities
[2:05:27] to act out his victory to just be able

[2:05:33] surrendered vessel that is so true yes

[2:06:30] supernatural
[2:06:32] experience by a supernatural God that
