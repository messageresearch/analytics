well the sins i used to do well i'll do them no more the sins i used to do you see i'll do them no more it was a bad day when i was born again when i was born again it was a bad day when i was born again when i was born again it was a bad day when i was born again hallelujah amen that's where that's what the real joy of the lord is amen is our our new birth to see where that he's he's brought us from amen where he's brought us from throughout the journey that's where we draw strength from when we're going through a test when we're going through a trial things comes up you know brother branham just was reading here where he's talking about the sword of the lord he said you know he says i'm not afraid of the sword he said because the sword he said is actually his wings and he said so wherever whatever comes up whatever is in before us he said the word will cut away through it for us and that's a confidence that we have as a believer see there's a the bible tells us paul picks it up in the book of corinthians david writes of it in the book of psalms i don't remember the exact chapter right now but it speaks of how that we go from strength unto strength and it isn't us getting bigger but how do we go from strength unto strength that's the same chapter where david said how admirable how awesome how great are thy tabernacles oh god what's his tabernacles it's not these buildings it's these tabernacles our lives lives that are dedicated to his presence paul said no you're not your body is a temple of the holy ghost we go from strength unto strength tests and trials and things come our way but he gives us strength job said he puts strength in us and the joy of the lord is our strength we're not drawing from an an external resource to find our strength to find our joy the world remember the world has a joy right jesus said but the joy i give to you is not like that joy of the world because the joy of the world is fluctuates and it's based upon worldly things it can have a lot of joy and all of these things that are here job money family and all those things it have it's have its place but there's one real joy that no matter what everything else is going from we can draw strength from there this is this is that mystery where paul where the scriptures would tell us and brother brandon would pick it up to conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trial joy doesn't mean that we're skipping and we're running it's not telling us to act and pretend but we draw strength from knowing i'm not who i used to be i may not be who i want to be and what i ought to be but i'm not who i used to be we're drawing strength from the joy of the lord and so when tests when trials when situations come up we are able we have an access because the things of this world is like how do i say it you know sometimes well i'm going to go you know and do this or i'll go do this and i'll go those things are like it's like hypos it's like painkillers the painkillers don't deal with the symptom they only mask but all the joy of the lord it gives us strength because he's dealt with what was the real true symptom of every cause because remember when sickness comes it's already been dealt with right through the atonement sin and sickness has already been dealt with everything and where we can draw strength joy from him and this is why the prophet could tell us conduct ourselves with joy amidst the trials that he in his infinite wisdom allows to come to pass oh my what what a resource that we have tonight what a resource in him and i want to just tonight before we open the word of god and move into the pages of the word i want to have special prayer here tonight i know um the brothers have text me and i know that they're having a special prayer service there at brother erickson's they're true where tabernacle this evening for the families the loved ones of brother charlie and sister rachel brother brian exactly how old was brother charlie 21 i thought that's what we what is it 23. so you guys are right in we were talking about it last night sister rachel was how old 20 21 so 23 years old 20 21 years old and the house there's pictures of it you don't everything is just blowed everywhere it's just but they found they found them in the basement and evidently they we don't know exactly all the details they were they were believers i'll tell you that i thought back you know i remember my goodness i remember all of brother collins as children sitting on the front row when i would go to brother ray's administer and but the charlie was he played the bass guitar in the assembly there and sister rachel it's the collins family as many of you some of you may know brother chuck collins it's the collins family and it's also the sisler family and so that the sister rachel is brother garrett sisler and his wife their their daughter and brother charlie his brother chuck and his wife it's her son we just just want to ask that god would just comfort them i i mean there's things that we we look at and you see before you there's just no way in our minds to try to process it there's no way we can do that just even from last yesterday early in the evening when just to receive the report sister gracie had text us and then i started getting it from other brothers there and you think you put yourself one of one of um you know our children or any loved one and i want to just ask that god will just really minister to them the families the loved ones and the church family may the spirit of god just put a hedge around them keep away anything if the enemy wants to try to step in there in any way and bring them down i just pray there'll just be such a hedge of the holy spirit around them god would just minister minister to their hearts amen let's just go to god in prayer for this special need heavenly father lord jesus as we come to you once again this evening lord i know that this request was made known undoubtedly lord across this assembly there's other needs too and i know that lord that no doubt many are aware of and have been praying of it but god as we join our faith tonight lord in a special moment lord god that you'll just move i pray lord as the comforter lord that has brought the comfort of the holy spirit to our lives lord by way of the new birth may you lord i pray step forward for the collins family lord and for the sisler family for every one of the loved ones oh god for the body of believers that are there lord friends and family lord close associates oh god we ask tonight lord that lord jesus you were just just moving lord for their needs just the comfort of the holy spirit oh god that you just bring healing lord and comfort in these moments lord leadership oh god now we're thankful in this hour that there is a clear clear leadership in this hour lord we've not been left to our own devices and lord you don't you don't pull back in the time of crisis that's when you manifest yourself and your glory that's where real leadership lord moves in lord we pray that god you'll just comfort that entire assembly brother ray brother ray lord brother wayne oh god direct our brothers lord [Music] god i pray when the families would lay down at night may the holy spirit oh god comfort of the lord in a special way lord in these things many times lord there's things that we don't understand but that's where we trust you lord we trust you we trust you completely lord father to know that god that brother charlie and sister rachel lord they were sweethearts here in this life husband and wife to think oh god yesterday evening here they stepped from this [Music] this thread of time and into eternity together [Music] they're enjoying what they were partakers of thank you father thank you for their lives lord thank you for your mercy o god thank you for the holy ghost the love of god we thank you lord may you just continue to give strength and lord for every need that's here tonight as well you're mindful father will you just come and help me to step out of the way help the people lord in these next few moments lord lord you see what i have before me what you've laid on my heart the lord laid on my heart for quite some weeks now lord but god i'm depending on you that you'll just come and deliver the word tonight what we have needed let us be sensitive to no lord when we've said enough lord oh god help us tonight may you move and lord in every heart and every life for your glory we ask it in jesus name amen amen if you'll turn with me to joshua chapter 5. benjamin come here please joshua chapter 5. i want to also as you turn there tonight i want to um give a testimony boy i tell you that was just wonderful sister miranda praise the lord i tell you that that testimony i know that'll go far beyond just just here because i know there's others that deal with that same issue i have dealt with it i did i just well i just was rejoicing just to hear what god has done amen he's so good at me he met he's faithful amen are just so wonderful i also want to say sister linda cavilo my aunt we just received the word today you know she just went last friday into rehab so she left the hospital where she had been at in cleveland in uh the double lung transplant that took place in the middle of january so she left from there to go into rehab last week they've already told her that lord willing next friday she goes home amen thank you so much thank you i tell you praise god i tell you the lord is so good you know just talking to her on the phone even the um the other day and just talking and praying with her and uh just how that god has certainly just brought her just a great a great way and you know it's some of the first times i went up there and seen her and that's before they ever put the trach in her the what appeared and what was right before me it didn't look good but you know even when i stood there in the midst of that time i said but god you made a promise and i refuse to look at these things that i see before me and i and you know god was just gracious and stand there and just just speak just speak what god put on my heart just to direct her faith and the promise because everybody knows at times sometimes i mean you think she's been in there saying i don't mean to keep you standing i'm going to let you be seated here in a moment but from january to this time in june that's that's five months she's been in a hospital and actually only two weeks in this other facility i tell you what i mean anybody knows i mean to me if i'm out of my house more than a day i want to get back let alone when you're in a hospital or anyplace else like that but i tell you what you know what it's been the prayers of the saints every time it's come and we continue to pray for her god will continue to strengthen her because she has she has grown very strong and i tell you it's just it's just wonderful just to see everything didn't happen right all at once you know and and i just think that i tell you probably even that testimony and sister anna's testimony i'll probably end up preaching on those things here and when as we get further into the promised land on our midweek services because sometimes the way that the promise comes to pass is not necessarily the way that we want it or expect it i'm sure that joshua didn't expect that he was going to be marching around the wall seven times for seven days but that's what god had in mind so one thing that sure the promise is sure amen let's just read here in the word joshua chapter five verse one and it came to pass when all the kings of the amorites which were on the side of jordan westward and all the kings of the canaanites which were by the sea heard that the lord had dried up the waters of jordan from before the children of israel until we were passed over that their heart melted neither was their spirit in them anymore because of the children of israel may god had a blessing to the word you may be seated and i just let you be seated i'm just going to keep on reading here in the scriptures and we we we we stopped with that scripture last week and what we were looking at is being fully identified with the living god and over and over we've seen in the scripture even the testimony that was coming out of jericho that because of you we have heard what the lord has done the people of god were identifying themselves with what god was doing now this was different from where you had the spies that had went over in the land and they had been walking all along the bible says there was a mixed multitude that came out of egypt the bible tells us that as paul would place it that all walked under the cloud all were baptized uh unto moses all came through the red sea all of these all of these parts as they were all walking all drank from the water from the rock but yet all of those parts were meant to be encouragements to build their faith for them to cross into their promise see everything that god does even within a service and as what god has done in this generation is it is done that it might become personal to our lives now if a life refuses to identify themselves with god well they're not going to get anywhere with god but in order to get anywhere with god you have to identify with him and to identify with him it means to obey him believe him walk in the light as he's in light as he is moving and dealing with our life we walk in that word that's identifying with with the word it's just like the holy spirit can come and as he does come into service and there's things that he can deal with in our life the flesh might want to pull back but this is where we need to let the inner man have the right of way and this is where we say amen to the word that means so be it we're identifying the word then the word itself will come and identify us so you know when the disciples they identified with the word the word was dealing with their life it was drawing them and as we were looking at that last week but yet they were not fully identified with the living god until the living god came and and dwelt inside of their lives and that happened at the day of pentecost when god imparted his life to them so you see we want to be identified when the word is coming forth we want to say man to the word not just not just as a routine but we're taking hold of that word and saying so be it to my life lord and praying over that word is that words coming forth in our life we want to pray as brother bannon put it very clearly in the message mighty god unveiled before us he said we must seek until that word is made real to us we're not seeking after uh something i'll hear a fathom we are seeking after the living god who is touching our life dealing with our life we're identifying with him and we're desiring that god will come and let that word be identified in and through our lives and then that's where god said they shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord because we can wear shirts that say the name of jesus christ and yet underneath that when it says name of jesus christ it could be every kind of life that you know swearing and walking in the world and doing everything else everything contrary so it's not just coming under or having a name on a shirt or saying that i'm a christian but we want with our profession we want a life that's behind that and that's where the holy spirit would speak and says let them that name the name of christ depart from iniquity if you are identifying yourself as a christian you also have authority to resist the enemy right you you are able to draw strength so don't let the enemy tell you that there is no strength available but there is strength there was strength available that came to you and i to repent of our sins do you realize when a person repents of their sins that there can still be everything in them that made them sin in the first place is that right if they were a smoker before they can still have that nicotine spirit on the inside but down deep there is a child of god that's desiring to identify with the word and say lord forgive me and they repent and now what is it doing they're receiving strength to repent and god continues to release strength as we walk in the word and the word comes and says get this out of your life take this out of your life and it's not us taking it out of our life but it's us saying amen to the word of god and saying lord let it pass out of my life i don't want that in my life what's happening we're receiving strength to look unto him and from there there comes strength then when that source of strength we've we've been receiving strength from comes to live inside of us and we can say like david the lord is the strength of my life oh glory be to god so we're not on a picnic we're on a battlefield so israel here in verse 1 as we were looking at that last week israel was in a place of of where they were uh identifying with with god and they were walking unlike the spies before them or the other the others that had come out that went over in the land and said we can't do it we can't take it but there joshua and caleb they were identified with the word they might have had to wait 40 years because remember what god spoke but that didn't diminish what god said when god told caleb through the prophet where your feet have trod in this ground i've given that land to you he might have had to wait there for 40 years but there's one thing about it during that time caleb was making ready no doubt maybe you could have passed by his tent you would have heard what are you doing i'm getting ready to take some giant's heads off he was sharpening the cutlery come on friends he was sharpening his sword he that promise was there it was certain to him he was identifying with the word and remember god said because joshua and caleb have identified themselves with me then god pulls back and says caleb had another spirit in him because he hath followed me fully following the lord a man to the word of god so be it and give ourselves to the word until that word itself is identified through our lives so i want to as we were looking at that it's a time of identification this is an hour a season of identification it's a time in an hour for the sons and daughters of god who are coming to full maturity coming to adoption to a position to a placement of what god started back there on the day of pentecost now coming into a place of adoption because it's time for rapture it's time and preparation for the wedding supper for the millennium and then into the future hope this is the hour of the manifestation of the sons of god we're not going to be sons and daughters of god oh when i get to the millennium you won't need it then right now is when we need it right now is where we need the holy ghost right now is where we need the grace of god right now is where sons and daughters of god become manifest in this hour under the very presence of almighty god this message in this hour brings us into our sonship so you know a time of identification this is the hour of being where god is fully identifying his people so i want to go now to the next few verses here in joshua 5 2 at that time the lord said unto joshua make thee sharp knives and circumcise again the children of israel the second time joshua made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of israel at the hill of the foreskins and this is the cause why joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of egypt that were males even all the men of war died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of egypt now all the people that came out were circumcised so when they left egypt all were circumcised right that the man must be circumcised right when they left egypt they were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of egypt them had not been circumcised for the children of israel walked 40 years in the wilderness to all the people that were men of war which came out of egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the lord unto whom the lord swear that they would not show the land which the lord swear unto their fathers that he would give us a land flowing with milk and honey and their children whom he raised up in their stead them joshua circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised by the way now the bible says in verse 9 let me just skip to that one and the lord said unto joshua so after the circumcision has taken place here at gilgal this day have i ruled away the reproach of egypt from off of you i may not be able to get to this here tonight but i want you to notice he said to joshua make these sharp knives and circumcise them and after it's all said and done god is identifying it that it is i that have circumcised you it is i that have removed the reproach of egypt from off your life it shows what a precious thing it is when the word has been delivered and the word has been received then that word is handled with the hand of faith it is not the man doing it it's god behind the man doing it gilgal is a special place this is where they're at they've just crossed the river jordan it's a it's a special place it's a starting point every every christian must have a gilgam hallelujah must have a gilgal the gilgal is not just when we've given our hearts to the lord remember where they're at they've been identifying themselves with the living god and and and testimonies are being witnessed how god is opening the way taking down kings and taking down now look think of this god has taken down kings that were rulers and spiritual powers he has removed things from their life that they could have never removed how did that get removed from their life because they identified with the word when the word said go take bashan they moved with that word under the ministry of the prophet moses and as they moved with that word it was building faith in their life to cross the jordan and to come to this moment right here so they come to a gilgam they've crossed jordan but now there's got to be a a starting point brother brown how many times you would hear where brother brown said you've always wanted a place to set your foot right in the right in discernment a place where you could set your foot and start from and he would say tonight is your night he wasn't it wasn't mincing words it spoke to many that there's things he said that even i just was reading last weekend there are things of how god had dealt with an individual's life about a spiritual calling and brother brahm says yet you've never been able to receive that calling because you've never been spiritual enough to receive it he said what you're standing here for and you need is the baptism of the holy ghost because it's the holy spirit that puts confidence in our life and confidence is faith are you hearing me that's why staying in the presence of god to a believer that's why we must stay in the presence of almighty god when a person says well i'm getting weak the first question is if you're weak have you been in god's presence well i don't feel like praying well usually there's going to be many times our flesh does not and there's going to be as far as all of our mistakes our failures and you know i i should have done this and i didn't do this i didn't do that there's got to come a moment where you persevere beyond your feelings because your feelings will try to keep you out of the presence of god but that's where you and i must abide is in his presence because the the aaron's rod did not blossom and bloom and produce it out here in the outer court or even when it got close there in the inner court it had to go all the way and let me tell you something friends that's why every day of our life it is to be occupied in the holiest of holies we are changed from glory unto glory if we can be honest and really look in the mirror of the word the reason we're not advanced like we should is because we are not spending time in his presence like we ought to there's a lot of a lot of a lot of extraneous things that could try to come to take us away from his presence even things that we can say this is legitimate this is legitimate that's legitimate this is legitimate but it has to come down to where you take all things that are legitimate and say this is a legitimate reason this is a legitimate but you have to come to a place to where you recognize that all of these things here they cannot come before the presence of god because when you have your life before god's presence then all of these other things god orders it and directs you as it ought to be directed and those things do not become the focus of life but christ is the focus and he directs you through all those things gilga is a starting point in each of our lives and when when elijah with elisha it was a gilgam he received a double portion of the spirit and you see that gilgal itself is always a testimony of what god did one time he'll do again remember this was a moment that it was spoken when your children begin to say what mean these stones what does this mean so it's if there's a testimony whatever god did once he'll do the same again so this circumcision when we speak of this the circumcision i want to just say it this way it is the sign of the covenant that god made with abraham and through this circumcision they now were going to have a direct connection with the living god remember all this was a type of where you and i are at by the baptism of the holy ghost so no longer were they just going to be identifying with it but now god himself was out of place just in now their faith i hope you understand what i'm going to say circumcision is god recognizing your faith recognizing i'm my faith circumcision is a type of the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth it's god recognizing our faith so what do what what is the seal the seal itself is the holy spirit the seal signifies ownership the seal signifies this belongs to me when god seals god is sealing a life that now reflects his mind a life that is followed walking in the scriptural pattern of his word like he gave to moses do this do that building the tabernacle and then when the tabernacle would come to completion then the presence of god would come down and god's presence coming down was a witness what i spoke to him in the cloud and he delivered it was from me and i'm here vindicating it oh brother sister not only did god vindicate this message night after night after night i'm my life is a vindication of this message your life's a vindication of this message a man's word won't act like this hallelujah so it's coming into a direct connection with the living god and god making a way for him now i want you to think about this in this circumcision here at gilgal i want to pick up on this out of the end time evangelism i don't have it posted there i just want you just to go with me brother brown would speak about how that so much where it spoke of there's so many decisions that's been made if you made a decision for christ now everybody has to make a decision right you are all forced to make a decision everybody but to recognize that from that decision then that's a confession that's a stone but there's got to be a cutting of that stone and the cutting of that stone is removing everything that is not what god had in his mind let me just say it this way you and i create our family albums as our children are born and as they grow we put all the pictures and things in there and now you can look back through their pictures and look back when they were younger and say i seen that there oh i see that there oh i see that there if you've got videos of him i seen that action back there now you see it back there but god before the foundation of the world he already had his family album created it was already created god already snapped a picture and not a picture when we in fallen bodies are you hearing me now but god he took a picture of the positive not of the negative are you with me the negative is what gets developed to match the positive god snapped a picture before the foundation of the world that's why job there he could say where was you before the foundation of the world when when the morning stars sang for joy who are those morning stars sons and daughters of god that we're doing what rejoicing in our salvation through the blood of the lamb that's something to shout about he made a way for me before i even knew i needed a way before you knew you needed a way he already made a way and decided in this generation he would reveal himself to you and i that i'm your waymaker i am your way [Applause] glory be to god so god calls that life by his word if the word is is being spoken and he's calling and he's speaking to that life there's decisions that are made but you see god don't want just a pile of rocks because they just become a pile but god has intended and ordained and purposed that our lives would be a living memorial a living witness that our lives would be dedicated to his presence that it would be god walking inside of our lives when we go whether to the factory or or the sister making biscuits at home it's god behind flesh it's god behind the skin let me tell you something this message is more than books and tapes it's more than just gods and a prophet it's to recognize it was god through the ministry of malachi 4 declaring his pathway his purpose that he desired to take on flesh in his body of believers and bring you an eye a real living experience and i'm saying like this god has stone masons and he he alone is the true stonemason because god does not want a pile of rocks right i mean you know how it is i mean there's things that i got out behind my shed i've got these stones out there that my parents had them at their house when they moved i took them said well i put them out behind my shed when i moved you know from i put them out there and you know what i've had to pick all they do is sit there i've had to pick them up and put them here and sometimes i get an idea oh maybe it would go good here and they're just you know simple little patio stones and you're really trying to figure out what in the world to do with them they're just sometimes they're all stacked up when i started planting tomato plants and things like that but you got to pack them around but you see god's desire is not to pack around stones because every one of us where we live in the communities we live the places we work and in our homes god doesn't want a pile here but god wants to so live inside of our lives he doesn't remove the reality that we're a stone he wants us to be a lively stone that just as the people were positioned in the land by divine inspiration god by divine inspiration wants to hew out his children cut away everything that is of the world everything that's unlike him that's what he does as a true stonemason and he comes right through the word godly god uses his vessels is that right god uses men god uses he uses his word but it's not the man because the man many times there's things that that man doesn't necessarily want to say there's things that he don't necessarily want to preach right sometimes it's a little bit easier when you go in somewhere and you don't know nobody than if you're at home and you know and you know everybody but regardless it's got to come by the inspiration of the holy spirit because let me tell you something we need liberty completely in our lives in order to obtain every promise of god there's got to be complete liberty in our lives and there won't be a church program bring it there won't be a soup supper bring it the only thing that brings real liberty is the cutting of the word of god as it comes to cut us free because the very thing that can be present in your life is the very thing that's holding you back from more of god and god coming to say let's move this out of the way oh i want it all out of the way don't you you know to be able to where god will come in and speak to our lives to quit this and quit that and what's acceptable it isn't that god making a do and don'ts list but i'll tell you what real grace is not disgrace the grace of god will come and bring correction to our lives the holy spirit is still a discerner he's still present to take stones instead of them being piled up and you got to pack them in and pack them out and pack them in and pack them out god don't want it piled up he wants lives that are on fire and pulsating with his life you say that's only for the pastor the preacher i don't know what kind of bible you've been reading out of but god has ordained for every one of us to be on fire with the holy ghost i just heard the prophet say this morning in the holy ghost series he said what the spirit of god did in the body of jesus christ it does the same thing in the body of the believer what the holy spirit has done in one person's life he won't act no different in another person's life this is what the prophet called end-time evangelism because it's evangelizing but it's in time in time evangelism is malachi 4 time when god said behold i send you elijah the prophet the coming of elijah the prophet remember he's coming with a direct word from god when elijah stood there that day and said i've done all this at thy command that ministry is a ministry that god has set to dissolve doubts where people are held between two opinions let me just address some of those opinions am i believer or was i just been around this for a long time let me tell you something you could not hunger and thirst for god if god didn't put that in you he didn't put that in you in a service here it was always in you and like somebody gets in the presence of a magnet that magnet begins to reveal there are properties there that are magnetized to this magnet and the great magnet of the holy ghost moving down through his word in a service what is it it draws upon that which is magnetized to it it might be bolted down now but there is liberating power to remove anything that'll hold you back if i send somebody to your house come on friends the bible said a good name is rather to be had than great riches you know how it is you find somebody's name and you want to say i knew somebody else by that first name what's their last name because it might been a thief robber crook come on now why in the world would we listen to the devil well the devil's telling me that because god let me tell you something god ain't never told nobody the promise ain't for you no sir matter of fact jesus said i will in no wise cast out you know what jesus said if you leave it's because you leave i ain't throwing you out sure you say what are you saying i'm telling you it's time to stop listening to a liar it's time to call the devil alive oh brother samuel he's back me down in the corner it's time to take the word and say boo back brother brandon told about a man he said the devil kept on coming at him he said that man took the bible and he said he started to realize he started taking the bible and just swinging it right there at the devil he said the devil kept coming and wanting to say it's not for you the days of miracles has passed he said but that man stood there and said but jesus christ is the same yesterday there forever he said i found out when i did that it backed the devil up he didn't get bigger he got he got smaller who's getting stronger you're getting stronger because you're tapped in to the source of almighty god oh hallelujah there's got to be a stonemason there that will shape our lives up call sin sin is that right it ain't to be disagreeable but it's to recognize that that god himself he makes a way that he himself might come and set down in that life that's what the sword of the lord is doing it's cutting away everything that is unlike him because you see jesus once wants character now the bible tells us in hebrews 4 12 let me just try to get to a spot here tonight for the word of god is quick that means alive and it's powerful don't misunderstand me you know i believe in laying on hands i believe in prayer lines i believe in altar calls i believe in all that but i also believe that while peter yet spake these words the holy ghost fell on i i don't just believe that i am a witness that the word is powerful the word is powerful and sharper than any two-headed sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and moral he gets right down into the nitty-gritty and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart now paul's not writing about a letter just a letter words wrote on the page although although being in contact with god you can be reading the bible you can be reading the message i'm talking about reading being in contact with god and it appears because you know what makes a difference you're in contact with god so when you're reading it you're not reading it as some foreigner you're reading it as one who is active in the covenant are you hearing me so you're not just waiting well i'm going to wait till i come to church that's when the word of god is alive no it is alive here but every day in your life let me say this to you it's not something outside of you the word of god is jesus christ himself what is the holy ghost the holy ghost is god revealed through christ in christ and now in the life of the believer the holy ghost and god are not separate people come on now that that mystery has been restored in this hour that it's not three persons it's the same god that was above us with us now in us so think of it the same word of god that brings discernment and that pierces down in our life that same word of god as we allow it to have preeminence now is a discerner through our lives giving us leadership and direction and you see that's that's what the stone cutter uses that's why when you come in we come and we sit down here we're coming to hear from god we come to say god if there's anything that's unlike you cut it away lord i'm not gonna make no excuses for it my flesh might get pinched a little bit but lord i don't want nothing holding me back it it cuts it it cuts off the surplus now remember i'm just laying this in here and lord willing we'll pick it up here next week but remember the scripture tells us in revelations one when when john would turn to see uh uh uh the voice that spake to me so the voice is speaking to him and now he's turned to see it and what john turns to sea he sees one walking in the midst of seven golden candlesticks one like unto the son of man in other words it's the same god now veiled in his body of believers his church right remember when when paul when he met paul on the road to damascus he said why do you persecute me and paul said who are you he said i'm jesus now paul wasn't persecuting the literal body of jesus but he was persecuting the body of jesus christ because it was the same jesus the same holy ghost now dwelling in a mini-membered body is that right and notice the characteristic of his seven-fold characteristic in the book of revelations and it speaks of the seven stars in his right hand seven messengers what is a star reflects light there's got to be the source of light it's coming from hallelujah what are they doing just reflecting that light so that we that are in darkness can find our way from darkness to light because the bible said that the path of the just shineth brighter and brighter and to that perfect day when you and i first started out in our journey it was not as bright as it is now in your life it's turning out a little dismal but it was light that was moving and as you keep walking the path of the just gets brighter and brighter and brighter until what until our lives are shrouded with the glory of almighty god oh hallelujah out of his mouth the bible said comes a sharp two-edged sword out of his mouth when's the last time you ever known anybody to handle a sword out of their mouth nobody but this is where his sword comes from and remember what jesus said he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god not just naturally living because we can have everything naturally living and this is good and i got this lined up but we don't live by that we live by every word so that sword and not a sword that's coming out of a seminary he didn't say it's a sword coming out of some man's mind remember it can't be that way but it's got to be a sword that comes from him and remember the sword the sword is the word of god and the word of god is him his person his life so what is so what is coming from him is not something different from him amen he is here speaking revealing himself so it is the sword of the lord that comes to deal with our lives so you know this is what exactly what god doing in this last age when we look at this scripture he's revealing the heart secrets of men and women in this age which we're living because remember god listen now in part of the circumcision here god will not circumcise over top of sin are you hearing me now well god i've got this little habit you know i i look at women and i do this but you know i i'm pretty good about it it only happens every once every day god said it's got to be all cut away from your life you know what god wants to do god wants to look at it and say you've got to get to a spot till you really hate it and you when you hate something you're not going to make excuses for it you're not going to find favorite quotes to profit oh my you're not going to find favorite quotes to pop it up but what you're going to do is stand there as a real child of god i'm identifying with the word to say amen with the word of god i may not be there yet but i'm saying so be it lord [Applause] let's say now i'm ashamed that others will know well don't tell everybody then don't blame it all on facebook on facebook or book or whatever it's called there ain't no mediator between between you know your mama your daddy or your aunt and uncle hates your mediator there's one mediator between god [Applause] and his people and that's the man christ jesus [Music] it ain't going to some boxing a church and confessing your sins to some man cause a man can't do nothing about it but there is one there is one the man christ jesus where god came down in flesh though he was tempted he was tempted in all points like we are but he's overcome and he said i took the holy ghost in my life and i overcame and you shall to be of good cheer for i've overcome the world [Applause] in this age he's revealing himself as the mighty conqueror when the seals were tore off the book he reveals himself i'm the mighty conqueror i triumphed over satan's trinity death hell in the grave i've never lost a battle man has laid down my word in the face of conflict but i've never lost a battle there's never been one person that'll hang on to that word and stand there toe-to-toe with the devil and they'll keep with that word there's never been a defeat because the word can't be defeated our feelings will be defeated i felt this way when i was prayed for i don't feel this way no more that has nothing to do with the word of god i i'm trying to help you tonight that's what he's trying to do not trying to put people down he's trying to help us tonight we're walking too much on feelings well i don't feel this way i don't feel this way remember being led by the holy ghost doesn't mean that you always feel spiritual there are threes that god leads you and i that we don't even feel as spiritual and you come to find out you were right in line in tune with what god wanted to be done you know what gets in the way our own thinking oh my try let me just try to boy i'll tell you just trying to bring this down here lord have mercy where does time go you probably say brother samuel if you didn't make announcements i know that's one of the defaults as a pastor that's one of the things i wish i could get other brothers to come out here and make but i still got to get you out here at a good time but uh something we have to do in it but you see the word coming in our midst in this in this hour i let me just try to wrap this up here on this point here it's the word that god has sent to this hour god knew every circumstance that would be here he knew every reasoning devil that would be here and let me just tell you something god is more than a match and with god on your side you're more than a match that's why you always want to identify with god that's why you want to identify with him and that's not what he said in his word he said if you'll be ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you is that right if they will be ashamed of me the son of man in this generation talking about right now then i'll be ashamed of you i'm not ashamed of him he's changed my life he's brought me through tests and trials oh he's put up with me much long suffering he's molded me he shaped me he's still where i'm not ashamed of him i'm not ashamed of this life it's the most glorious and grandest privilege it is to know jesus christ and to serve him i'm not ashamed of him i'm not ashamed when he comes in our midst and devils begin to tremble i'm not ashamed of him when the sick are healed i'm not ashamed of him when devils are put to flight in deliverance i'm not ashamed of him he is my help it's the same spirit this is the word it's the same spirit of jesus back in the church of the living god not just a portion of it like luther had to believe that just shall believe that was good but there's more there's more but now the spirit of god coming in the midst of the church to head the church off before judgment because we're at the end the bible tells us in revelations 10 the coming of this message is is is the finishing of the mystery of god the mystery of god is the holy ghost christ coming in the life of the believer behold i i send elijah to you before that great and dreadful day of the lord the coming of elijah the coming of a prophet is a sign of judgments at hand right and there was nobody to stand in on our behalf there wasn't any and i hope you understand what i'm saying there wasn't any organization or anything that was present that could stem the tide or bring deliverance to you and i in other words god couldn't find a man to make up the gap are you hearing me now god couldn't find a man as i said in the book of ezekiel one that would span the breach are you hearing me now now one brother branham that did that but brother branham yielded himself because he was ordained by the by the promise of the hour and christ came down in that yielded vessel and when he preached the message to preach it was christ identified i am present to tie my church back in to the every promise of god it was the son of man in a son of man are you hearing me now brother branham put it very simple in the message first seal and an unveiling of god it's the word in the man it's the head off before judgment what what's a heading off before judgment it's god it's god coming down to loosen and uncover everything that would hinder a life think of the woman at the well as we close as she was came to that well to get water like she normally did but god had an appointment that morning with her she knew now she knew more than the pharisees news that right she said she knew you know when it when it began to come she was able to identify we know when messiah's coming he'll tell us where we're to worship she was confident of that but she was still bound with sin she knew all about the promise of god let me just tell you beneath all of the darkness was a real believer down beneath there was a character that god himself the chief stonemason was coming and what was he going to do he was going gonna cut away everything that was unlike her mama you know what was happening the word was coming to bring judgment on those spirits that had held her in bondage and the prince of this world is judged and it's time now judgment begin at the house of god hallelujah where devils are brought from undercover where devils are cast out hallelujah oh glory be to god in the highest right while the words being preached listen friends we can cast them out right here we're laying on hands but even while the words going forth don't matter how it comes as long as it gets done those devils will leave but what's the main important part is once they leave get that place filled with the spirit of god oh brother samuel i used to be a drunkard but i don't drink no more what happened the devil went out i used to be bound with pornography what happened brother samuel a devil went out well i used to be bound with smoking high speed bound with luster i used to be about what happened a devil went out do you realize the power of the word that even when you repent and really repent repent isn't just feeling sorry for yourself because that ain't repentance that's called worldly sorrow oh i'm in a bad place oh i'm me on my i'm in such a bad place you ain't getting nowhere the bible said godly sorrow worketh repentance is that right you're repenting of your own do you realize that even right there the scripture is fulfilled where devils flee from your life are you hearing me the bible said that there were devils that went out and walked in dry dry clean places oh my god brother samuel what did that well not not your flesh but your belief in the word of god and now the same god think about it the simplicity to agree with the word and the word would come right down and cut that right out of the life and run that right out of your life by just identifying yourself with the word what will it do when you invite the god who delivers his word and cuts that out of your life to say god come down lord and feel my life this is why paul said in second timothy 4 8 there's a crown of righteousness that's laid up for me you know what that crown of righteousness is it's a new body it's not the terrestrial it's the celestial it's the same body that peter spoke of that said there's a body reserved in the heavens it's the same body that's right there before the presence of god just like your state representative or senator or that might be bad taste in people's mouth but you understand what i'm saying they're up there in washington and they're supposed to be representing us right they're supposed to be representing our wishes and our desires let me tell you something but with that body there when the holy ghost it brings you and it ties you back in to that theophany to that body that's right there in heavenly places you know what's happening what's what do they do in washington when they pass certain things you represent them over there there's things past you and i end up receive well here we end up receiving either cursings or blessings or whatever it is but there ain't no such thing as cursing's coming from the prince of god the bible said there are spiritual blessings in christ jesus we receive blessings from the presence of almighty god we're identifying with that word there's a pulsation in our life do you realize even when we have come to a place we might have said around this message for a long time but when we finally recognize it's eagle food you know what eagle food is it ain't food where you're walking around here you know what eagle food is it's sustenance that gives us the nutrients to fly brother brad said when you recognized it was eagle food this message and left the other thing you just can't recognize oh man this is really good you have to leave the other thing oh boy i'm not even gonna go there but all them who love his appearing now his appearing is not his coming his appearing is his presence coming in the form of his word his life the holy spirit coming and making himself known that i am the same yesterday today and forever and we with this message is the witness of his appearing and to love his appearing makes you ready for his coming and we're loving his appearing showing i have representation on the other side then what does that make you i am a pilgrim and a stranger here oh glory be to god oh my oh let's pray heavenly father lord as we and over a few moments lord have taken to look into your word as you would guide us and lord jesus how we thank you for your mercy lord i know that you have you spoke very plainly and very personally to our lives here tonight lord i know that god i'm confident that you've you've said for tonight what you wanted to say now lord may we as believers your prophet would take and he would speak two different messages hearing recognizing and acting upon the word of god lord when we have heard you speak to our lives here tonight then lord it wouldn't matter what would be around the life even well lord whatever spirit of torment maybe it's a disease an affliction maybe it's a habit lord maybe lord it's it's something lord of unconfessed sin that's there but you're here to head that life off before judgment you're here to bring judgment on that spirit to loosen your children lord i pray pray here this this evening that lord we want to be fully identified with you lord knowing that lord it's your word that comes to cut away everything that's unlike you when joshua was [Music] directed by you they crossed the jordan that's death to self and part of that whole death to self is where the circumcision comes in where the real baptism of the holy ghost where the world is cut away now lord we're asking here lord this evening for every need that's gathered here you know where each one is at lord father i pray that god may every life and every heart lord not not not shirt back in any way but may they lord just stand right there and say man to the word of god so be it in my life lord to be identified if there's one that's here that lord does not know you in that way may lord tonight may that be a moment lord that they would receive from you lord what they have need of maybe tonight's another step in their journey lord it doesn't matter if they're here maybe they're streaming by way of the internet but i'm asking god [Music] that lord for that life and that heart because we don't want to just be stones that's piled up we are ordained to be witnesses unto you witnesses of that resurrection power moving in our life lord o god how we thank you father for every life hearts lord seeing god the power of this word working lord in justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost winding its way into the very person of christ himself lord we we see that we are witnesses lord and i ask oh god may you just lord just move for every need present right now granted lord for every need there's a promise lord that you've given us for every need there's a promise you're the god to meet that need granted tonight lord may we just take strength lord receiving strength into our lives good granted lord we pray father oh in the name of jesus christ amen [Music] remember when stephen he stood there that day and he was ministering he was speaking he was speaking to very religious men but if peter began to speak to him this was their response the bible says they gnashed upon him with their teeth [Music] you know what does that dogs when they start showing their teeth you know you better back up [Music] the word was exposing what was there that wasn't a character see beneath that what was happening gnashing out against this is why stephen could say your stiff neck means stubborn not willing to move and uncircumcising hearts and ears these are people who knew the letter well you quote one thing they can give you the one before it and the one after it but when the word came to them this is what it means to be uncircumcised to have a thick and dull sense over your life where you're not able to recognize the divine admonition from god this is why brother brown would pray it over and over god circumcised every heart and every year circumcise our hearts and our ears [Music] that's what we want we know that the circumcision of the holy ghost is is is a one time it's it's there once that's done it's done you don't get born again and then reborn again and then reap you're born again but how that we need the circumcising of the holy spirit to remove anything that would be sense bound cutting away anything that's unlike him no wonder brother battle would say it over and over lord circumcise our ears our hearts lord [Music] in other words we could write it around writing a different way when brother adam would continue to pray over and over lord quicken us by your spirit to your word quicken us lord by your spirit over and over after the seals were opened brother brown continued to say that over and over and over and over in his opening prayer that's why we need we do not want to become with a thick we get thick layer of skin well i've been in the message so long and i know this and i know that and i've made it and blessed god i just i've just got it made i'm just there ain't nothing no no no we climb higher and higher and higher in god that's where every other one before has failed because they put a limiter on god you know they got limiters on this microphone back there compressor on this go figure why because my voice gets loud sometimes so instead of them having to play with volumes all the time and turn this down and turning that down and they have they have a device back there that takes and they can set it when i've got in here with them one-on-one and yelled and everything else they can set it to where it'll limit me so it doesn't oh pull down the volume oh turn up the volume i'll pull up that they've got that set back there but we don't want to put limiters on god [Music] we don't want to put limiters on god we don't want to get it set to i tell you i've been in this so long no you know what if god terry's right here uh how many years will it be you know um [Music] 27 27 years here uh we father's day here in june 27 years when god got a hold of my life but you know what he's sweeter now [Music] and you know one thing i found is i found i need him more now than i ever did i found out more now that you know what my goodness lord i i really really more than a song i can't even walk without you holding my hand i need your strength you know what i've come to realize more and more brothers and sisters is it's not god it's not me helping god out but god has to keep reminding me samuel i don't need your help i need you to yield to me and so i think man i think i'm going along i think i'm yielding pretty good and then here a tester trial comes and and god takes that test or trial and what's he doing he's changing the limiters that i put on him i'm the one who's put limiters on him we put limiters on him is that right but god lets a test and trial come and what does god do god says let me take over the controls don't you love him don't you just want to serve him with everything that's within you just
