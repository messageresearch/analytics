[41:02] 27 and
[41:08] U I'm kind of moving ahead to this
[41:11] chapter and I just just felt pressed on
[41:14] my heart just some weeks back to move to
[41:18] this there's a lot in job 24 I've been
[41:22] just wanting to move into but I think
[41:25] this will really set
[41:28] some direction for where we will go
[41:30] there if God will give us Grace and
[41:32] that's what he sees fit so it's always
[41:35] it's always subject to
[41:37] him so in job 27 I'm just going to read
[41:41] few the few first six verses and then
[41:44] we'll let you have your seat moreover
[41:46] job continued his Parable and said as
[41:50] God liveth who hath taken away my
[41:53] judgment and the almighty who hath vexed
[41:56] my soul
[41:58] all the while my breath is in me and the
[42:01] spirit of God is in my nostrils my lips
[42:04] shall not speak
[42:06] wickedness nor my tongue utter
[42:10] deceit God forbid that I should justify
[42:13] you till I die I will not remove mine
[42:18] Integrity from
[42:20] me my righteousness I hold fast and will
[42:25] not let it go
[42:27] my heart shall not reproach me so long
[42:32] as I
[42:33] live I tell you what to me what a
[42:36] beautiful
[42:37] testimony yes sir amen may God bless you
[42:40] and bless the reading of the word as
[42:42] you're being
[42:44] seated and uh I'd like to speak here
[42:47] tonight on a thought a faithful
[42:51] heart and knowing that that's was always
[42:55] God's intention and that's where God
[42:58] desires to dwell and that's what God
[43:01] desires in our life is is our heart in
[43:05] all
[43:06] things and remember when he came among
[43:09] the Pharisees they they had
[43:12] everything outwardly just just right but
[43:16] Jesus would look at the uh the disciples
[43:19] and say except your righteousness exceed
[43:23] the righteousness of the Pharisees and
[43:27] it's has to exceed that now there's
[43:29] absolutely no way that a man could ever
[43:33] in his own self be able to exceed of the
[43:38] righteousness of even when you consider
[43:40] the Pharisees they were right to the law
[43:43] on so many things right to the point
[43:45] even if certain things they wouldn't
[43:47] even you know uh eat out of this or eat
[43:50] out of that were keeping so many things
[43:52] but God was speaking of a righteousness
[43:55] that man in himself could never
[43:57] work himself into but it would have to
[44:00] be imparted by God's own life and that's
[44:04] what Paul would speak of in 1
[44:06] Corinthians 3 when he would declare to
[44:09] us of was because in in reality the law
[44:12] itself was was glorious in that the law
[44:15] was actually describing God's Own nature
[44:19] but man in himself we were uh contrary
[44:22] in our nature because of the fall to the
[44:25] nature of God we couldn't remedy that
[44:28] remember God God God made a way so that
[44:31] man would man would would sin and man
[44:34] would fall God made a way that man could
[44:36] come back into the presence of God to
[44:39] worship him through and by the sacrifice
[44:42] of an innocent one but God's ultimate
[44:44] desire was that that righteousness would
[44:48] come into our own lives and there's only
[44:51] one thing that could bring it there and
[44:53] that would be through and by the shed
[44:55] blood of the innocent one of God himself
[44:58] coming down and becoming the Supreme
[45:01] sacrifice for you and I it couldn't be
[45:04] the blood of of any any that was born uh
[45:08] sexual many great men through through
[45:11] the scriptures Elijah Jeremiah on and on
[45:14] Abraham but none of that could satisfy
[45:17] it must be a blood that was not
[45:20] connected with that of the polluted line
[45:23] but it had to be God himself created a
[45:26] blood cell God created that body that
[45:29] Tabernacle that was purposed for death
[45:32] it was purposed for Redemption that he
[45:35] might impart to you and I as Paul said
[45:39] that Spirit of his own self which is the
[45:43] spirit of righteousness of which he
[45:45] himself is revealed to be our MDC the
[45:50] king of righteousness there is no higher
[45:54] righteousness than the righteous
[45:57] of God's own life and God made a way
[46:01] that you and I could even become
[46:04] partakers of that of of of his own life
[46:07] and come back into a place to where you
[46:10] and I can stand just exactly as we ought
[46:13] to stand and God intended us as Sons and
[46:17] Daughters of God where there's no
[46:18] condemnation in our lives and where
[46:21] we're standing free and clear and
[46:23] there's a righteousness of God's own
[46:25] life that is so come into our life and
[46:28] there's been an operation that's been
[46:31] performed by the Holy Ghost so it's no
[46:34] longer our own faith but now it is God's
[46:37] faith that has moved down into our lives
[46:41] as a matter of fact brother bam tells us
[46:43] it is God's faith that actually receives
[46:46] himself into our life into the temple
[46:50] that he has prepared without hands
[46:52] because that place that God prepared
[46:55] without hands is that seed that
[46:58] expression of himself that always lay
[47:00] there within you and I that was the
[47:02] dwelling place and God himself is the
[47:05] one who has made a way that he might
[47:08] dwell within you and I that's so good
[47:11] all of these many types and scriptures
[47:13] and examples through the scripture all
[47:16] all point to this with every true child
[47:20] of God and of the elect all the way down
[47:23] through time I want you to think that
[47:24] even when the prophet of God was was uh
[47:28] moved to select the different messengers
[47:30] of the church ages uh uh brother you
[47:33] know polycarp was a wonderful man he was
[47:36] a just had a tremendous testimony but
[47:39] brother bam when when he would choose
[47:41] Paul to be that first church age
[47:43] messenger he spoke in this way and he
[47:46] says the reason that he didn't choose
[47:48] polycarp is because polycarp leaned a
[47:52] little bit towards organization and you
[47:55] see it wasn't that he was in it it just
[47:57] leaned a little bit to it and so in
[47:59] order to be that messenger that was
[48:01] chosen here God set that pattern of Paul
[48:04] and I I say that with this in mind of
[48:07] how that God himself in within the
[48:09] measure of it of when God looks down
[48:12] into the very uh depths of our life I'm
[48:15] glad that what God looks upon is our
[48:18] heart this is when it comes down to
[48:21] everything that's said and done this
[48:24] right here these simple words a faithful
[48:26] heart is a life that's worthy of
[48:30] rapture that's so good and so when we
[48:33] think of this here in the scripture
[48:35] there's no more beautiful testimony that
[48:38] not only job would have but that you and
[48:41] I could have and that is that in the
[48:44] midst of it of everything that was
[48:46] taking place job had declared my
[48:50] righteousness I am holding fast and I'm
[48:53] not going to let it go now he had
[48:55] already went through there had been 26
[48:57] chapters of dialogue that had taken
[49:00] place actually up to 25 and here he is
[49:03] still standing and maintaining his
[49:06] testimony after all of this period of
[49:08] time whether it was days weeks months I
[49:11] I don't know but whatever the time was
[49:13] it just goes to show that Revelation is
[49:16] does not respect time but Revelation
[49:19] supersedes time Revelation goes beyond
[49:23] circumstances this is why there's
[49:25] nothing as great and Powerful as
[49:28] Revelation it is prevailing power
[49:31] because Revelation is the anointing of
[49:34] the Holy Spirit upon your eyes to see
[49:37] what God actually sees and to actually
[49:41] see victory over the enemy to see
[49:44] yourself as God sees you that's that is
[49:48] the privilege that is given by God's
[49:50] grace we did not earn that but that is
[49:53] given to You and I by the grace of
[49:56] Almighty God this is why Jesus could say
[49:59] blessed are your ears that hear and your
[50:02] eyes that see for many long these were
[50:06] men who actually saw by Revelation what
[50:10] was coming but Jesus said you're blessed
[50:13] because it's no longer a prophecy but
[50:16] you're seeing the manifestation and
[50:18] you're recognizing it you're being moved
[50:21] by this you're seeing what they saw do
[50:24] you realize what he was saying he was
[50:26] letting them know you are in the same
[50:29] company of Fellowship that the prophets
[50:32] were in and they were caught up into the
[50:35] mind of God what a blessed
[50:40] Fellowship prise the Lord hallelujah a
[50:44] faithful heart that within it I I think
[50:46] that's the most if God will allow us
[50:48] Grace here tonight just to take a little
[50:50] example of this and just to look here in
[50:53] the scriptures of this part of a
[50:55] faithful heart because you know job job
[50:58] was not a man in all these other
[51:00] scriptures where he's actually trying to
[51:03] defend himself as though he's a guilty
[51:05] guy and he's trying to defend himself
[51:08] but job is standing here and he knows
[51:11] where he's standing not because of his
[51:14] merits but he knows he's standing here
[51:17] because of God's revealed Grace to his
[51:21] life and that if there's something that
[51:23] doesn't hit the mark it is Grace that
[51:25] lets him know it's not hitting the mark
[51:27] and Grace it makes a way for
[51:30] reconciliation and job was standing
[51:33] there with that Divine Assurance in his
[51:37] life Oh my he had a faithful heart he
[51:40] wasn't presuming he wasn't wondering he
[51:43] wasn't job didn't say well I can't even
[51:45] look at this right now he's job's not
[51:47] trying to cover anything up he's only
[51:50] saying this is the cover I'm under I'm
[51:53] under the cover of the shed blood that
[51:55] has been revealed revealed by God's
[51:58] voice J what are you testifying to I'm
[52:01] testifying to the blood that's what I'm
[52:04] under I just say it here this I say it
[52:07] here tonight if there's anything that we
[52:08] can ever and should ever be guilty of
[52:11] and that is oh God let us be guilty of
[52:13] bragging on the blood of Jesus Christ
[52:16] because you set aside the blood of Jesus
[52:19] Christ we have no life because life has
[52:21] come through the blood because without
[52:24] the shedding of blood there's no
[52:25] remission of
[52:27] sin Hallelujah we could not even
[52:29] approach into his presence but God
[52:32] himself made a way that you and I might
[52:34] be able to approach
[52:36] him it's a faithful heart and this is
[52:40] why when the scripture could say
[52:42] therefore being justified by faith we
[52:44] have peace with God through our Lord
[52:46] Jesus Christ by whom we also we stand we
[52:51] have an access by faith into this grace
[52:53] wherein we stand and rejoice in the hope
[52:56] of the glory of God you realize the
[52:58] prophet would tell us he'd say you know
[53:00] job offered the burnt offering he said
[53:02] you don't have to offer the burnt
[53:04] offering now all that you have to do is
[53:07] have faith in the offering that's
[53:09] already been made for you and truly when
[53:12] job offered the burnt offering that was
[53:15] his display of the faith that he had
[53:19] received or heard from God and he
[53:21] offered what God had required amen I I
[53:25] think there's no greater no greater
[53:27] privilege don't don't don't let us ever
[53:29] underestimate or devalue the greatness
[53:32] of
[53:33] obedience Saul came back with so many
[53:37] things that he thought and the people
[53:39] were pressing him about and Saul was led
[53:42] astray from fulfilling what God had
[53:45] caused him to do but oh I believe I
[53:47] believe I'm one of them and I believe
[53:49] I'm speaking to people that value God's
[53:51] word above their own reasonings above
[53:54] their own imaginations and above their
[53:56] their own ideas to say I don't
[53:58] understand it there's some Choice Ox in
[53:59] here there's some Choice sheep but I
[54:01] have been commissioned by God to destroy
[54:04] everything I don't know I don't know how
[54:06] it'll all come out but I know that if I
[54:08] stay in line and in step with God God is
[54:11] a provider he is Jehovah Gyra God
[54:14] already sees the end from the beginning
[54:16] so I'm going to stay with the word of
[54:18] God I'm not going to reason it out
[54:20] that's called a faithful heart a
[54:23] faithful heart doesn't mean you or I
[54:26] understand and everything is that I've
[54:27] heard his voice and I'm standing on what
[54:30] his voice has
[54:32] said that's a faithful heart amen
[54:35] Abraham do you know what's going to
[54:37] happen there on Mount Mariah I don't
[54:39] amen but I know this right here we're
[54:42] coming back down off the mountain we're
[54:44] going to go worship and we're coming
[54:46] back down do you know all the in between
[54:48] I don't know all the in
[54:50] [Applause]
[54:51] between but what I do know is God has
[54:55] spoken that March of Mount Mariah was a
[54:58] victory marchall it was a victory march
[55:01] that told a testimony here's a man that
[55:04] God has brought into maturity into full
[55:08] adoption to where his heart completely
[55:11] trusts
[55:14] [Music]
[55:15] God I believe I'm looking at Abraham
[55:17] seed
[55:21] tonight a faithful
[55:23] heart job alone knew he was right how
[55:27] many times you feel alone sometimes you
[55:30] feel all
[55:32] alone job was Alone brother BM said he
[55:35] alone knew he was right and where he was
[55:38] standing I mean think of it job was here
[55:42] he would go into the
[55:44] marketplaces and when he would go and
[55:46] people would come to seek counsel of him
[55:49] as it says in job 29 job rehearses all
[55:52] this and and and now now you have a
[55:55] situation
[55:56] where even his wife has come to him and
[55:59] said hey man enough's
[56:02] enough just Curse God and die I mean
[56:04] come
[56:06] on and then he has those from his church
[56:10] brother Bram called him in uh uh uh uh
[56:14] um 1964 and Jesus come and called he
[56:17] said then he had the friends he said
[56:18] that'd be like the deacons coming to you
[56:21] from from your church and coming to you
[56:23] I I when I look at how brother Bram says
[56:25] that because you know I think about how
[56:27] that deacons and and hear us to stand
[56:29] you know collectively and things with
[56:31] the ministry I'm talking about standing
[56:32] with the word but to imagine here is job
[56:35] uh his children has been lost not just
[56:37] one seven every one of them have been Lo
[56:40] everything's been taken away from
[56:43] him I'm not going to say that we don't
[56:45] suffer but I think it's safe to say that
[56:47] no one here tonight has went through and
[56:49] been where job has
[56:51] been we've been in certain areas and
[56:54] certain aspects of it and it's not
[56:56] necessary that God has to reprove this
[56:58] God was simply showing through job's
[57:01] life I'm going to show a testimony of
[57:03] what it is for every man and woman that
[57:06] actually hears my voice and comes Under
[57:08] The Fellowship of the blood they will
[57:11] stand there in the midst of everything
[57:13] else and placed Me Above themselves
[57:16] above their own feelings above
[57:18] everything else their heart will remain
[57:22] faithful I want to just say this very
[57:24] quickly a faithful heart God begins with
[57:28] the infancy even as it starts through
[57:31] repentance sanctification the baptism of
[57:34] the Holy Ghost it's continuing to grow
[57:36] and grow and grow there's a maturing
[57:39] going on this is how you look at
[57:41] Abraham's life you say is that
[57:42] scriptural sure it is you look in
[57:44] Abraham's life and Paul would also say
[57:46] to to the Thessalonian church he said
[57:48] that your faith would abound he would
[57:50] also speak about that your love would
[57:53] abound so there's a growing and a matter
[57:56] fact the prophet would say it like this
[57:58] and on the wings of a snow white dove he
[58:00] would say at the end of that in that
[58:02] prayer I love it he he talks about God
[58:04] opening opening his word in this hour oh
[58:07] he says God he said this word that you
[58:10] have opened has led me to a faith I
[58:13] never had
[58:15] before the word this word that God has
[58:19] revealed let me tell you something you
[58:21] know the word that God has revealed in
[58:23] this hour listen friends there's things
[58:25] that we can look at in the scriptures
[58:27] and doctrinally we know where we're
[58:29] standing but let me say this to you the
[58:32] greatest stand that you can know is when
[58:34] the seals are taken off the book and
[58:36] when you can see yourself like John seen
[58:39] himself like the prophet said when John
[58:42] begin to worship he said the reason that
[58:45] he worshiped the way he did is because
[58:47] John looked and said there's John hallah
[58:51] he saw himself and that brought a
[58:53] worship into his life
[58:58] Hallelujah that's where our that's where
[59:00] Victory is drawn from this is where
[59:02] we're we're standing like job the
[59:04] prophet would say it like this standing
[59:06] Pat or flat footed and flat-footed means
[59:10] it's an uncompromising stand in a matter
[59:13] it's firm it's it's solid it's staying
[59:15] right there and so this God he had heard
[59:18] God speak to him God had spoken listen
[59:22] job didn't just wander into this and
[59:24] trying to find wonder what the
[59:26] acceptable way but God revealed himself
[59:30] to job look at friends it wasn't you and
[59:33] I that found God it was this message it
[59:36] wasn't you and I that found this message
[59:38] right it's God who found you and I God
[59:41] knew God knew where you and I were
[59:44] at and he came looking for you and I is
[59:48] that right and God spoke to job he
[59:50] revealed himself to job job knew I've
[59:53] heard his voice and when he stood upon
[59:57] that burnt offering there was that
[1:00:00] confirmation that came as a direct
[1:00:02] witness from God he heard the voice of
[1:00:05] God speak over his obedience Thou Art
[1:00:09] just amen that's what the word speaks
[1:00:12] friends that's so good that's what the
[1:00:14] word speaks and it didn't move him a bit
[1:00:17] now I want to just look at this
[1:00:18] acceptance here this acceptance was
[1:00:21] expressed how many believe that our
[1:00:23] faith is
[1:00:24] expressed works works always express the
[1:00:28] faith notice the testimony this is back
[1:00:30] from chapter one but you see it it
[1:00:33] matters here because here in verse one
[1:00:36] this is Job's testimony among the whole
[1:00:39] the whole Community among everybody that
[1:00:42] he's around he was a perfect and upright
[1:00:44] and one that feared God and Es skewed
[1:00:47] evil this was his testimony among
[1:00:49] everybody else but let me just tell you
[1:00:52] the reason he had that kind of a
[1:00:54] testimony was not because job had good
[1:00:57] DNA
[1:00:59] naturally it was because of verse 8
[1:01:02] verse 8 that testimony which was before
[1:01:05] verse one that testimony was God when
[1:01:08] the Lord had this was God what he spoke
[1:01:11] and thought of job he said there's none
[1:01:14] like him in all the Earth he's a perfect
[1:01:17] that means blameless an upright man one
[1:01:20] that feareth God and esth or departeth
[1:01:24] from evil
[1:01:26] that was his testimony in the
[1:01:29] heavenlies and the testimonies in the
[1:01:31] Heavenly thy will be done in earth as it
[1:01:34] is in heaven you see what it was in
[1:01:36] heaven was actually being acted out on
[1:01:39] Earth you know why because job if we can
[1:01:41] look say accept it this way job was a
[1:01:44] man that had been positioned in Heavenly
[1:01:48] places
[1:01:49] Hallelujah he knew the Divine Authority
[1:01:52] that had been given to him that been had
[1:01:56] to him through and by the revelation of
[1:01:58] the provided sacrifice of the lamb now
[1:02:02] when you think of this job himself let
[1:02:04] me just uh proceed on here job knew that
[1:02:07] the heart mattered yes right that's good
[1:02:10] are you hearing me he knew the heart
[1:02:12] mattered this is why the scripture says
[1:02:14] it was so in the days of their feasting
[1:02:16] talking about his children and job sent
[1:02:19] and Sanctified them and Rose up early in
[1:02:21] the morning and offered burnt offerings
[1:02:24] according to the number of them all for
[1:02:27] job said it may be that my sons have
[1:02:30] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[1:02:35] right thus did job continually so he
[1:02:37] wasn't offering it because of
[1:02:40] actions are you hearing me now that's
[1:02:43] good he's dealing with the heart because
[1:02:45] it's where the heart gets dealt with the
[1:02:47] actions will cease amen yes sir and
[1:02:51] before we ever act out it's already got
[1:02:53] to be accepted in our heart
[1:02:56] right we have to take in the thought and
[1:02:58] process it so here he knows that the
[1:03:00] offering has got to be about their
[1:03:02] hearts hallelu that's why even as
[1:03:05] parents as we pray for the hearts of our
[1:03:07] children we pray for the hearts of one
[1:03:10] another listen don't get your eyes on
[1:03:12] one another pray for one another's
[1:03:14] Hearts you pray for my heart I'll pray
[1:03:17] for your heart because that's what God
[1:03:19] is actually looking at is our hearts
[1:03:23] that's what he came to reconcile himself
[1:03:26] Satan took the head God took the heart
[1:03:29] and job job understood this it's the
[1:03:32] heart that matters before God that was
[1:03:35] the Revelation that job had and that's
[1:03:38] why he could say my heart shall not re
[1:03:41] reproach me cuz he knew that God was
[1:03:44] looking at his heart and his heart was
[1:03:47] under the blood all things
[1:03:51] confessed thank you Lord yes sir you
[1:03:54] Lord hallelujah job knowed his heart he
[1:03:57] knew he was in the line of
[1:04:00] reconciliation Hallelujah notice how the
[1:04:03] prophet says it here he says concerning
[1:04:06] job job said and through all the
[1:04:09] accusations I am satisfied that I've
[1:04:12] never I have never I I'm not a secret
[1:04:15] sinner right right my heart is clean
[1:04:19] before god notice before God it's clean
[1:04:22] that's what matters and I've made my
[1:04:24] sacrifice there you are then stand on it
[1:04:28] if you've met God's requirements stay
[1:04:31] right there don't you move Amen brother
[1:04:36] Bram goes on to talk about how Abraham
[1:04:38] called anything that was contrary to it
[1:04:40] as though it wasn't he says job in in
[1:04:43] paragraph 113 job stayed right with it
[1:04:47] man when all of his friends his wife
[1:04:49] everybody you know there's only one
[1:04:50] place that job was left to stand and
[1:04:54] that was on the word of God
[1:04:57] that's he had no other place to stand
[1:04:59] and just goes to show you all other
[1:05:02] ground is sinking
[1:05:04] s there is no other comforter outside of
[1:05:09] the comforter himself who is the word he
[1:05:13] said I'll never leave you nor forsake
[1:05:17] you I don't care what comes your way we
[1:05:21] have a friend that stick is closer than
[1:05:24] a brother that's right yesen
[1:05:27] hallelujah amen he who was not ashamed
[1:05:30] to become one of us to become identified
[1:05:34] with us that through and by his
[1:05:36] vicarious suffering and the imparting of
[1:05:38] his life that we might become identified
[1:05:41] with him oh don't you love him amen
[1:05:44] job's testimony was remember what we
[1:05:47] read in job 23 job said he knows the way
[1:05:50] I take right he knows the path because
[1:05:55] it's his
[1:05:57] right like when the Revelation when
[1:05:59] brother bramus finished preaching and
[1:06:01] here Danny Henry walks up and the spirit
[1:06:04] of God comes down and anoints him and he
[1:06:06] speaks in another tongue a French tongue
[1:06:08] and here there are interpreters from the
[1:06:10] UN and others that are sitting there and
[1:06:12] here it begins to ring out that thou has
[1:06:15] chosen the harder way and that way is my
[1:06:19] way and because of this Choice a huge a
[1:06:24] portion of Heaven awaits for
[1:06:28] you glory he knew the way he was taking
[1:06:32] job knew his steps where he was walking
[1:06:35] and he had a testimony my steps have not
[1:06:38] gone back in other words when there were
[1:06:40] times of convenience I stood upon God's
[1:06:44] word when things would have been more
[1:06:45] convenient for job when things would
[1:06:48] have been better for
[1:06:50] job but I've stood upon God's word
[1:06:55] friends we're talking about a mature Son
[1:06:58] of God you know I hope you can catch
[1:07:01] this here tonight it's God establishing
[1:07:04] the aiming point that through and by the
[1:07:07] the the Holy Spirit the new birth it
[1:07:10] brings about a child of God that is able
[1:07:14] and will stand on the word of God when
[1:07:16] all of their senses give way when
[1:07:19] everything else all around gives way
[1:07:21] they'll stand upon God's word amen
[1:07:26] anybody know what I'm talking about oh
[1:07:28] yeah when there's
[1:07:31] things that don't even make sense to
[1:07:34] your mind right of the way that you're
[1:07:37] standing it almost as like you've got
[1:07:40] two people inside of you you you just
[1:07:42] think I look at that like it don't make
[1:07:43] no sense of this but you know there's
[1:07:45] something that's deeper than even my
[1:07:48] intellect there's something that's
[1:07:50] deeper that's holding me it's something
[1:07:53] that when everything else comes in it
[1:07:55] cast it out there's a strength that's
[1:07:58] there oh maybe if we should get to
[1:08:00] dwelling on it too long we'd get a
[1:08:02] little down but getting a little down
[1:08:04] can never knock away the Revelation
[1:08:06] that's in your
[1:08:08] soul greater is he that's in you than he
[1:08:12] that's in the world that Revelation
[1:08:14] listen is Christ himself revealed to you
[1:08:17] as a son and daughter of God you've got
[1:08:19] authority over that thought
[1:08:23] [Applause]
[1:08:26] sometimes God will allow that mind to be
[1:08:29] tormented the prophet says that in many
[1:08:30] different places he said people can say
[1:08:32] oh could that really be of God he said
[1:08:34] sure he said sometimes even after you're
[1:08:36] prayed for God will allow things to go
[1:08:38] on he said and allow torment the enemy
[1:08:40] to come and want to torment you accuse
[1:08:42] you and tell you everything in the world
[1:08:45] he said but God will only permit that
[1:08:47] because he's called you to be a
[1:08:50] testimony in all of his
[1:08:53] glory that no matter all the mind
[1:08:55] battles and all the torment that you can
[1:08:57] send their way there is something inside
[1:09:00] of them that's greater than their own
[1:09:03] resolution it is that of the sovereignty
[1:09:06] of God that came from God's own
[1:09:09] mind
[1:09:11] Hallelujah I feel like running here
[1:09:13] tonight but I got to stay here and
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:18] preach job said I have not gone back
[1:09:21] from his commandment as a matter of fact
[1:09:23] I want you to know I have a esteemed his
[1:09:27] Commandments and what he said from his
[1:09:30] mouth I esteemed it more than my
[1:09:34] food that means more to me than anything
[1:09:38] else his
[1:09:40] word here's a man that's standing on the
[1:09:42] word I want you to think of this job had
[1:09:46] every bit of the mechanics now let me
[1:09:47] just let me drop this here just a
[1:09:50] moment job had all the mechanics in
[1:09:53] order
[1:09:56] he had done what God had revealed to him
[1:09:58] to do being a prophet God spoke to him
[1:10:02] through
[1:10:03] inspiration and job knew that
[1:10:05] inspiration is the Dynamics of God
[1:10:08] that'll come upon the
[1:10:11] mechanics and so job had all the
[1:10:13] mechanics in order brother BR said he
[1:10:17] offered that burnt sacrifice and brother
[1:10:19] R said oh if we as the church could get
[1:10:23] the mechanics in order do all that God
[1:10:26] has asked us to do our hearts right
[1:10:29] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:10:32] Christ these are these are all mechanics
[1:10:34] you you see friends listen the Dynamics
[1:10:37] do not come where there's no mechanics
[1:10:40] right the Dynamics come to make the
[1:10:43] mechanics live is that right we got to
[1:10:47] hold the balance here what the prophet
[1:10:49] teaches when he tells us about that
[1:10:51] Cadillac in the rising of the sun when
[1:10:53] he tells us about that Cadillac has
[1:10:55] dokin seats and all these great things
[1:10:57] and wonderful things and he said here it
[1:10:59] is a beautiful car but he said if if
[1:11:01] there ain't no fire in there it'll never
[1:11:04] go down the road but he said it's got to
[1:11:06] have
[1:11:07] gasoline you don't have gasoline I don't
[1:11:09] care how many Sparks you
[1:11:11] got this is why God had to restore the
[1:11:14] word in this hour amen so that the
[1:11:18] Dynamics will come upon that word where
[1:11:21] there's a people that have made
[1:11:23] themselves ready
[1:11:26] and God has sent a word by his grace for
[1:11:28] you and I that the mechanics in our life
[1:11:31] would be ready for the Dynamics to
[1:11:33] strike and take us off of this
[1:11:36] Earth Hallelujah the mechanics in order
[1:11:40] it's the same way when it comes for
[1:11:42] healing brother BR said you just get
[1:11:43] everything right get everything
[1:11:45] confessed out he said then your heart
[1:11:47] you see what happens your heart becomes
[1:11:49] an open place for God to speak
[1:11:52] through that's so good it becomes a
[1:11:54] channel like job was a channel job had a
[1:11:57] way the prophet said of getting himself
[1:12:00] out of the way what was that way that
[1:12:02] job had you said job was A Gifted Man I
[1:12:04] want to remind you you're a gifted
[1:12:06] people you go the prophet tells us in
[1:12:08] the church AG book this Revelation is
[1:12:11] reserved and revealed to a special class
[1:12:14] of people a people with prophetic
[1:12:17] insight and I want to let you know that
[1:12:20] you've got a gift and that gift in your
[1:12:22] life the prophet said is that so that
[1:12:25] came from God and the quickening power
[1:12:28] comes upon that soul and it makes that
[1:12:30] word live and so you are gifted like job
[1:12:33] was gifted able to get yourself out of
[1:12:36] the
[1:12:38] way oh what Grace is given to you and I
[1:12:42] hall
[1:12:44] hallu
[1:12:46] now there's got to be an silencing of
[1:12:49] the
[1:12:53] accuser remember
[1:12:55] Satan is the accuser of the
[1:13:00] Brethren is that right now let's deal
[1:13:03] with this here in just a moment because
[1:13:06] this one I'm going to read is from the
[1:13:08] previous
[1:13:09] chapter job in job and
[1:13:13] 27 is speaking but in job
[1:13:17] 25 is this is the last time that the
[1:13:21] voice of the accuser is going to speak
[1:13:24] oh that's good that's good are you
[1:13:26] hearing me yes sir that's good I I want
[1:13:28] to let you know that Revelations 5
[1:13:31] there's no devil present
[1:13:33] hallelujah hallelujah are you hearing me
[1:13:36] you don't read a no devil in Revelations
[1:13:38] 5 you know what it is friends it's the
[1:13:40] word that is being revealed that it's
[1:13:43] Christ who is our intercessor that the
[1:13:45] blood has done the work it is sufficient
[1:13:48] and God has sent a word to catch our
[1:13:51] eyesight from the things of the world to
[1:13:53] look away to Jes Jesus Hallelujah you
[1:13:57] know how it is when you're talking about
[1:13:58] things that you really enjoy every all
[1:14:01] the other chatter all around you begins
[1:14:04] to
[1:14:05] subside and this is what Revelations 5
[1:14:08] is it's where a word takes preeminence
[1:14:12] in a body of
[1:14:14] Believers it's where the word throws
[1:14:16] overthrows the accuser the little bck
[1:14:20] and there's a people that see their
[1:14:23] enemy dead they see their enemy
[1:14:26] conquered they see the victory that is
[1:14:28] in the lamb and he's my lamb he's my
[1:14:34] [Applause]
[1:14:37] Passover you talking about bringing out
[1:14:40] faithful Hearts brother with that kind
[1:14:43] of love being made manifest how could
[1:14:45] you do anything else but be faithful
[1:14:48] hallelujah thank you Lord but here here
[1:14:51] is the final voice of the accuser in job
[1:14:54] 25
[1:14:56] five dominion and fear are with Him

[1:15:52] merits but he had met God's requirement

[1:16:30] of righteousness which we have done but

[1:16:36] the washing of regeneration and renewing
[1:16:40] of the Holy Ghost there comes a
[1:16:42] regeneration the new birth and then the
[1:16:45] renewing the maturing the growing in the

[1:17:00] Christ Our Savior that being justified

[1:17:07] according to the hope of eternal
[1:17:10] life but of him are ye in Christ Jesus
[1:17:15] who of God has made unto us wisdom and
[1:17:18] righteousness and sanctification and
[1:17:20] Redemption that according as it is
[1:17:22] written he that glorieth let him glory
[1:17:26] in the Lord for he hath made him to be
[1:17:29] sin for us who knew no sin that we might
[1:17:33] be made the righteousness of God in
[1:17:37] him we are his
[1:17:44] workmanship can we say Amen to that
[1:17:46] tonight Hallelujah this is why the
[1:17:49] prophet over and over would say if that
[1:17:52] that little Mammy who had that little
[1:17:55] you know that little mule or that ass
[1:17:57] that had come and been born and he would
[1:18:00] say oh my when when the owner comes
[1:18:03] tomorrow morning he's going to kill me
[1:18:05] he's going to look at me look how odd I
[1:18:07] look my floppy ears and look how
[1:18:09] deformed I look and look how ugly I am
[1:18:11] and his mama that was well structed in
[1:18:14] the law she could tell him son let me
[1:18:17] tell you something you are my firstborn
[1:18:20] and God has made a way that the
[1:18:22] firstborn can be redeemed so I want to
[1:18:25] let you know when the owner comes out in
[1:18:27] the morning there's going to be a lamb
[1:18:29] that's going to take your place and the
[1:18:32] owner is not even going to look at you
[1:18:34] he's not going to inspect you he is
[1:18:37] looking at the lamb that stands on your
[1:18:40] behalf when a worshipper came to the
[1:18:43] Tabernacle in the wilderness or to
[1:18:45] Solomon's Temple when they came to offer
[1:18:48] up their sacrifice the priest did not
[1:18:51] inspect the worshipper the priest
[1:18:54] inspected his
[1:18:58] offering
[1:19:00] Hallelujah and when he offered that
[1:19:02] offering it was because of the offering
[1:19:05] the innocency of the
[1:19:07] offering and God made such a way he said
[1:19:11] if you can't get a laugh I'll take this
[1:19:13] if you can't bring this I'll take this
[1:19:16] if you can't bring that I'll bring a
[1:19:17] turtle D I want fellowship with you I
[1:19:21] don't want anything to keep us apart
[1:19:24] [Applause]
[1:19:26] God's faithful
[1:19:28] heart moves on our
[1:19:31] heart to bring
[1:19:33] faithfulness if I can say it like this
[1:19:35] we are faithful because he is faithful
[1:19:38] we love him because he first loved
[1:19:40] [Applause]
[1:19:42] usall Hallelujah that's why the prophet
[1:19:45] said don't ever look at
[1:19:49] yourself he said as a matter of fact he
[1:19:51] said when he's holding a little baby
[1:19:53] dedicating it he said I used to think
[1:19:54] about oh just how innocent this child is
[1:19:57] he said but do you realize that each one
[1:19:59] that's born of the spirit of God you're
[1:20:01] more innocent than the baby that I'm
[1:20:02] holding the
[1:20:04] dedicated because the new birth takes
[1:20:06] you beyond natural
[1:20:10] birth Stay With Me Now oh my you know
[1:20:13] when you when sin is
[1:20:15] confessed it goes when it's confessed it
[1:20:19] goes right in the bleach that God has
[1:20:22] provided and can I refer to one
[1:20:24] statement I got to looking at this again
[1:20:26] and it about turned me around and around
[1:20:28] brother Bram said you can't even find
[1:20:30] one spot of bleach on him oh you know
[1:20:33] what that means it'd be like if I had on
[1:20:34] my pants right here and somehow you know
[1:20:36] if I spilled bleach on them you'd be
[1:20:38] able to see the spot for sure but you
[1:20:40] see what happens is the bleach of God
[1:20:43] the blood that God himself created for
[1:20:45] you and I When sin is confessed that
[1:20:49] bleach that blood of Jesus Christ has
[1:20:52] the power to break sin hold and it sends
[1:20:56] it
[1:20:57] way on back till it falls on to the
[1:21:01] accuser Satan himself brother he's got a
[1:21:05] lot to answer
[1:21:06] [Applause]
[1:21:09] for
[1:21:12] hallelujah
[1:21:13] hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:16] loosens us
[1:21:20] [Applause]
[1:21:22] completely Hallelujah the Prophet could
[1:21:25] say it like this and be certain of God
[1:21:28] he said job could say he said when the
[1:21:31] accusations would come his way job I
[1:21:33] know job you've got something in your
[1:21:35] heart that you haven't confessed and job
[1:21:37] said no I hadn't done it I've confessed
[1:21:41] at all there was no
[1:21:44] condemnation right you know the Bible
[1:21:47] tells that job said my heart will not
[1:21:48] reproach me you know if if our heart
[1:21:51] condemn us God's greater than our heart
[1:21:53] and know it's all thing aren't you glad
[1:21:54] friends for conviction let me tell you
[1:21:57] why you got that conviction the prophet
[1:21:59] said that if you'd go to do something
[1:22:01] wrong there's something that'll ring out
[1:22:03] and then if there's something that is
[1:22:05] wrong that has been done wrong he said
[1:22:07] you can't stay there you can't dwell in
[1:22:10] that you've got to come make that right
[1:22:12] that's right that's because they're
[1:22:14] listen you know why that is that's a
[1:22:16] part of God that's
[1:22:18] right that a listen that ain't because
[1:22:20] you're a good person that's right that's
[1:22:23] right I I I go through a whole Litany of
[1:22:26] quotes on all of this but if our heart
[1:22:29] condem see that's what Satan wants to do
[1:22:31] he wants to hang things over if our
[1:22:33] heart condemn us not then we have
[1:22:35] confidence toward God if you've done
[1:22:38] what God has asked you said well Brother
[1:22:40] Sam if I've fallen short but remember
[1:22:42] confession belongs to you as a
[1:22:45] Believer come on friends we've got a
[1:22:48] right to every Redemptive blessing we've
[1:22:51] got a right to the Holy Ghost we got a
[1:22:53] right to Deliverance but don't ever
[1:22:55] forget your right to
[1:22:57] repentance we've got a right to
[1:23:00] repentance that's so good Hallelujah I
[1:23:04] tell you what a wonderful privilege it
[1:23:05] is to be able to stand there and to know
[1:23:08] that we're not coming as Beggars hoping
[1:23:10] that he will forgive
[1:23:14] us oh
[1:23:16] my then we have confidence toward God
[1:23:19] you know what when we have confidence
[1:23:21] then we become a channel that's waiting
[1:23:22] on inspiration to fall
[1:23:25] our heart everything all the mechanics
[1:23:27] are laid in order I'm just waiting on
[1:23:29] the Dynamics to drop why because we keep
[1:23:32] his commandment all the mechanics and do
[1:23:34] those things that are pleasing in his
[1:23:36] sight pleasing in his sight that means
[1:23:39] even if there's something that comes in
[1:23:40] my mind that may not be expressed out
[1:23:42] here but I can say Lord forgive me for
[1:23:44] that thought maybe a thought against a
[1:23:46] brother against a sister this or that
[1:23:48] but I want to do what's pleasing in his
[1:23:51] sight because when I do what's pleasing
[1:23:53] in his sight God saw all this about job
[1:23:56] but others saw what God saw the
[1:23:59] confidence in job we want to do what's
[1:24:01] pleasing in his sight cuz you know what
[1:24:04] it'll it'll reflect outwardly sure don't
[1:24:06] you love the
[1:24:07] Lord watch this I have heard but now see
[1:24:11] oh my I just love this message brother
[1:24:14] BR said notice he said when everybody ex
[1:24:16] respected his wisdom he had become so
[1:24:18] great his inspiration from God had
[1:24:20] Vindicated him to be God's servant so
[1:24:22] plainly until the people come from
[1:24:24] everywhere to hear him and then Satan
[1:24:26] begin to accuse that man and that's the
[1:24:28] way he does every inspired servant of
[1:24:32] God Satan is always everybody say always
[1:24:36] always there to accuse him of everything
[1:24:39] he does that's not
[1:24:46] right always there right I want to just
[1:24:49] say this job wasn't sinless and perfect
[1:24:56] and
[1:24:57] upright and all of this because he was
[1:25:00] sinless it was because he had a perfect
[1:25:05] and clear
[1:25:07] confession before
[1:25:09] God he knew his right to
[1:25:14] confession it was the revelation of the
[1:25:17] burnt offering that kept him
[1:25:21] clean you might say well really Sam how
[1:25:23] could I make this this mistake but it's
[1:25:25] the Revelation that keeps you clean and
[1:25:27] says uh-uh uh-uh uh-uh uhuh that can't
[1:25:30] dwell in your life and what is it then
[1:25:32] you stand as a son and daughter of God
[1:25:34] and are Washed by the washing of Water
[1:25:38] by the word amen not only does it
[1:25:41] remove of of the sin of the offense but
[1:25:45] what it deals with is the guilt so you
[1:25:47] can go on and hold your head up high as
[1:25:49] a son and daughter of God awaiting on
[1:25:53] inspiration to
[1:25:55] strike Hallelujah
[1:25:58] confession y'all believe this right
[1:26:00] right let me just jump to verse n here
[1:26:03] because I want to try to get this moved
[1:26:05] up here if we confess notice if we say
[1:26:08] we have no sin we deceive ourselves and
[1:26:11] the truth is not in us if we confess our
[1:26:16] sins come on now he might he'll think
[1:26:20] about it he'll get back to us he is I
[1:26:24] love that not was not will be he is
[1:26:29] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[1:26:34] and to cleanse us from all
[1:26:37] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[1:26:39] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[1:26:42] word is not in US 1 John 2 verse one my
[1:26:47] little children these things I write
[1:26:48] unto you that ye sin not and if any man
[1:26:51] sin we have an advocate with the father
[1:26:55] Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the
[1:26:59] pritu for our sins and not for ours only
[1:27:02] but also for the sins of the whole world
[1:27:09] Amen let's just read this prayer the
[1:27:12] prophet makes right here oh he says we
[1:27:16] do not want to try to enter into thy
[1:27:18] presence with sin Upon Us knowing that
[1:27:21] each day troubles and things besets us
[1:27:24] that might not even be noticed in our
[1:27:27] own thinking but when we come to think
[1:27:31] of a holy God who even angels are dirty
[1:27:34] in his sight then we know Lord that we
[1:27:37] have not a chance unless we come through
[1:27:39] the blood of Jesus Christ and then we
[1:27:42] are children of God our mistakes are
[1:27:45] overlooked as we confess
[1:27:50] them oh my no wonder no wonder the devil
[1:27:53] wants to get our thoughts going so many
[1:27:55] other
[1:27:56] ways I going to ask you to raise your
[1:27:58] hand but how many times you get down to
[1:28:00] pray and all of a sudden you let me
[1:28:01] check see if the dishwashers going y you
[1:28:03] know what let me check see the garage
[1:28:04] door must be open I don't want to live
[1:28:05] in not in this neighborhood my garage
[1:28:07] door is open no and is't it amazing how
[1:28:09] the things will come for you to
[1:28:11] do right you sit down you get ready to
[1:28:13] listen to a message and all then all of
[1:28:15] a sudden all of this starts running
[1:28:16] through your mind right right or you
[1:28:19] come and sit in the house of God you
[1:28:20] think praise God I made it and all of a
[1:28:22] sudden here you are sitting and there's
[1:28:24] something that just drops right down and
[1:28:26] trying to divert your mind you know why
[1:28:29] because when we think upon him then even
[1:28:32] the things that would be unknown to us
[1:28:35] in our mind when that examination would
[1:28:38] take place in our lives it keeps us in a
[1:28:41] place of real fellowship and real
[1:28:45] confidence no wonder the de no wonder
[1:28:47] God told Joshua meditate on these things
[1:28:51] how many of you know what I'm talking
[1:28:52] about when you go to start thinking
[1:28:53] about the Lord right his presence draws
[1:28:55] near it brother R says you start
[1:28:58] thinking on him he said all of a sudden
[1:28:59] you'll feel
[1:29:00] this he said that is the resurrection
[1:29:03] moving over you right
[1:29:06] there you Lord thinking upon the things
[1:29:09] of God I don't mind telling you brother
[1:29:12] and sister I'm just going to be honest
[1:29:13] as the day is long I thank God for those
[1:29:16] moments of Resurrection because there's
[1:29:18] things that I needed to be snapped out
[1:29:19] of sometimes there's thoughts of gloom
[1:29:22] and everything else and you start think
[1:29:24] thinking about him oh my sometimes we
[1:29:26] can get to thinking about how low we are
[1:29:28] and how this and how that and then all
[1:29:30] of a sudden we begin to think about God
[1:29:32] and I I believe it like this friends you
[1:29:34] can take it for whatever you think but I
[1:29:36] believe that the angels of God that are
[1:29:38] sent to minister to The Heirs at our
[1:29:40] Salvation this is why you want to have a
[1:29:42] life that's live clear before God
[1:29:45] because the angels are not ashamed to
[1:29:47] come where you're at and there's times
[1:29:49] my thoughts need hijacked and brought
[1:29:52] right back on the right track and begin
[1:29:54] to think on the mercies of God and you
[1:29:56] begin to dwell on it long enough
[1:30:01] and that's so
[1:30:03] good yes
[1:30:05] sir beauti look at this
[1:30:09] one oh he said we would ask this morning
[1:30:12] in the light of the sanctifying power of
[1:30:14] his blood that you would cleanse us from
[1:30:17] all our evil anything that we've done
[1:30:20] thought or said that was contrary to
[1:30:23] thee and father God we know that that
[1:30:25] would be many things for a great and
[1:30:29] holy God till even angels look dirty to
[1:30:31] him where would we stand but today we
[1:30:34] have the privilege of coming beyond the
[1:30:36] Angels because Jesus never died for
[1:30:39] angels and angels are servants and by
[1:30:42] the blood of Jesus we are Sons and
[1:30:45] Daughters of God and we come into thy
[1:30:47] presence to say thank you Father for
[1:30:50] what you've done for us and what you
[1:30:52] mean to us
[1:30:56] good
[1:30:58] hallelujah
[1:31:00] hallelujah a righteous
[1:31:03] man that's what job was he was a
[1:31:05] righteous
[1:31:07] man he had a testimony he was perfect
[1:31:10] but not in himself he was perfect am by
[1:31:13] the Revelation amen he was upright by
[1:31:15] the working of the Revelation in his
[1:31:17] life he was blameless by the working of
[1:31:20] the Revelation in his life and he es
[1:31:22] skewed es skewed means is that when he
[1:31:24] saw evil something was questionary and
[1:31:26] the buzzer starting to go on he turned
[1:31:29] away from it that's what a sketh evil
[1:31:31] Hallelujah that is so good you say
[1:31:33] sometimes I've been in some things and
[1:31:34] got turned around brother BR said that
[1:31:36] he said well he said let's like this
[1:31:38] it's like the crow and Dove was let out
[1:31:39] of the Ark he said God sometimes will
[1:31:41] let them two out like that and see he
[1:31:43] said but I'll tell you if you no longer
[1:31:46] have that Gall in you because the Holy
[1:31:48] Spirit has come in by the dove you
[1:31:50] cannot stay there cuz there's nothing to
[1:31:53] feed you and what means more to you than
[1:31:55] anything else is the word of
[1:31:58] God and you'll come right back to the
[1:32:00] ark yes that's why brother Ram said you
[1:32:04] take a person he said he said oh my they
[1:32:06] might get backel it he said but if
[1:32:08] they've ever been born again they'll
[1:32:10] never be happy anywhere else they're
[1:32:12] going to come back to the
[1:32:14] [Applause]

[1:32:23] here or let him you go a righteous
[1:32:27] man James confess your faults one to
[1:32:33] another that don't mean going around and
[1:32:35] telling everybody everything right there

[1:32:40] needs to be made right confess your
[1:32:42] faults maybe if there's a trusted
[1:32:44] brother or sister that God has given you
[1:32:47] as a comrade that they're not going to

[1:33:30] another pray for one another that you
[1:33:31] may be healed the effectual fervent
[1:33:34] prayer of a righteous man availeth much
[1:33:37] the fervent one that's boiling up Elijah
[1:33:41] was a man subject to like passions as we
[1:33:43] are and he prayed earnestly that it
[1:33:46] might not rain and it rained not on the
[1:33:47] Earth by the space of three years and 6
[1:33:49] months and he prayed again and the
[1:33:51] heaven gave rain and the Earth brought
[1:33:53] forth for her fruit the prophet said a
[1:33:57] righteous man is not a sinless man but
[1:34:01] he said a man is a man that depends on
[1:34:04] his righteousness by confessing his
[1:34:08] wrongs to
[1:34:10] God hallelujah oh come on now there's
[1:34:14] another shell we're not righteous in
[1:34:17] that we're sinless but a righteous man
[1:34:20] is one who confesses his sins to a right
[1:34:23] righteous and holy God and believes by
[1:34:27] faith sometimes this is the challenge we
[1:34:30] confess our sins and then now you've got
[1:34:32] to take that faith if we confess our
[1:34:35] sins then you've got to accept the
[1:34:37] Forgiveness that God is
[1:34:41] extending sometimes it's hard for us to
[1:34:43] forgive
[1:34:45] ourselves it's hard to take the
[1:34:47] Forgiveness of the Lord and bring it
[1:34:49] back to our own life and we'll struggle
[1:34:51] with it wrestling with it but let me
[1:34:53] tell you something
[1:34:54] it's freely
[1:34:56] given it's a privilege that's afforded
[1:34:59] to you when sister Bruce stood there she
[1:35:02] said how can I possibly be the Bride of
[1:35:05] Jesus Christ I make so many mistakes he
[1:35:09] said sister Bruce that's what Calvary
[1:35:12] was for Calvary was for all of your
[1:35:15] mistakes your desire is to serve him and
[1:35:18] he's made a way so you could serve him
[1:35:20] he said think of this he said here I am
[1:35:23] am he said as a sinner he said but in
[1:35:26] his presence you and I are not Sinners
[1:35:29] any longer we stand as redeemed in his
[1:35:34] presence he only hears our voice coming
[1:35:37] through the
[1:35:38] blood he doesn't even see
[1:35:42] us well what's he seeing he's seeing the
[1:35:45] same thing that Nehemiah spoke of
[1:35:47] regarding Abraham Nehemiah spoke and
[1:35:49] said God thou found us Abraham's heart
[1:35:53] faith
[1:35:54] there you
[1:35:56] go what's the testimony of Abraham's
[1:35:59] life a faithful
[1:36:04] heart can I read one
[1:36:09] more somebody said please that's how I
[1:36:12] feel a righteous man is not a sinless
[1:36:16] man you notice he said Elijah Elijah had
[1:36:19] a man was a man subject to life passions
[1:36:21] as we are he had his ups and downs and
[1:36:22] his differences and the scripture of his
[1:36:24] life proves that he had ups and downs
[1:36:26] like we do he had times of wandering and
[1:36:29] his times that his temper got away from
[1:36:31] him he had a lot of things that went
[1:36:32] wrong but he was still a righteous man
[1:36:35] because he confessed his unworthiness
[1:36:37] and believed in God so that's what made
[1:36:41] him righteous we're not righteous within
[1:36:44] ourselves we're righteous through Jesus
[1:36:46] Christ I cannot be Sanctified within
[1:36:49] myself I am Sanctified through Jesus
[1:36:51] Christ who stands in the presence of God
[1:36:54] in my place it isn't my Holiness it's
[1:36:57] his Holiness my Holiness won't work at
[1:37:00] all but his does because God done
[1:37:03] accepted him and in accepting him he had
[1:37:05] to accept me because I'm in him
[1:37:08] Hallelujah that's what makes it real
[1:37:11] isn't it then we don't have to depend on
[1:37:16] ourselves last one brother BR said now
[1:37:19] that doesn't make us say we can sin
[1:37:21] anybody that's been redeemed you have no
[1:37:22] desire to sin there you
[1:37:25] go so true well we're we're not looking
[1:37:28] for we're not looking for a thing to do
[1:37:30] something oh if I wasn't a Christian no
[1:37:32] we the desire of sin is
[1:37:35] gone sure we still have all of this
[1:37:37] around our spirit and our flesh that's
[1:37:39] right but the desire within is gone our
[1:37:41] desire is to please God that doesn't
[1:37:44] make us say we can sin brother if you
[1:37:46] sin you're just away from God there's
[1:37:48] only one thing to do confess it and get
[1:37:50] right with God you see how simple that
[1:37:51] is Amen brother Ram takes that in a
[1:37:53] message perfect Faith he takes the
[1:37:55] message perfect faith and he says if
[1:37:57] there's condemnation in your in your
[1:37:58] heart get it right so you can get
[1:38:01] ready it's just that simple you don't
[1:38:03] have to labor on it just get it
[1:38:05] right what so that you're in position to
[1:38:09] receive that oh I love that as long as
[1:38:12] you desire to sin the desires of sin
[1:38:14] still in your heart then it's time to
[1:38:15] stay down at the altar till that thing's
[1:38:17] taken out now you will sin you're bound
[1:38:20] to sin cuz you just can't help it but
[1:38:22] not willful sin
[1:38:24] he that sins willfully after he received
[1:38:26] the knowledge of the truth there
[1:38:28] remaineth no more sacrifice for sin but
[1:38:31] every day you're bound to
[1:38:33] sin and you're bound to be backsliding
[1:38:36] constantly oh I know the legalist hate
[1:38:39] these quotes that's right it's just so
[1:38:42] fearful that's going to make people
[1:38:45] slack the real gospel don't make people
[1:38:47] slack when it's presented and ministered
[1:38:50] in its Purity and Holiness and power how
[1:38:52] could you fail on a love like this what
[1:38:56] would you how what would you want to go
[1:38:57] away from a love like this that's
[1:38:59] presented to you you're bound to be
[1:39:01] backsliding constantly so it takes
[1:39:04] a
[1:39:05] constant prayer right right thus did job
[1:39:11] continually yes amen continually amen
[1:39:15] job how often continually Amen in other
[1:39:19] words job was like if you could say it
[1:39:21] his life was like on one of those he had
[1:39:24] his playlist set up and it was on
[1:39:26] continuous loop that's so
[1:39:30] good he had his favorite songs that's
[1:39:32] right and it was on continuous
[1:39:35] loop thus did job
[1:39:41] continually Paul said I Die daily and if
[1:39:44] Paul had to Die daily how much more am I
[1:39:47] going to have to stay there Dead all the
[1:39:51] time if Paul had to Die daily to stay
[1:39:54] right with God we'll have to do that
[1:39:57] just die out to yourself and that's
[1:40:00] getting God's way amen you love
[1:40:04] himl a faithful
[1:40:07] heart a faithful
[1:40:10] heart
[1:40:12] Hallelujah let's
[1:40:18] stand when it comes down to it
[1:40:23] on Rapture
[1:40:26] morning and we'll be standing there we
[1:40:29] won't be standing
[1:40:32] there because that we were sinless right
[1:40:36] we're going to be standing there just
[1:40:38] like we are today it's a faithful
[1:40:41] heart and a faithful heart is even when
[1:40:43] there's something that's out of line
[1:40:45] something that's a little off even a
[1:40:47] things sometimes that we may not even be
[1:40:49] aware of that has been done or said like
[1:40:53] brother Bram as he prayed that's just
[1:40:55] one little sample of it but it's a
[1:40:57] constant prayer before God if there's
[1:41:01] one thing that we could take in the
[1:41:02] scriptures that was the victory for
[1:41:05] job's life and his walk with
[1:41:08] God job had fellowship with God he was
[1:41:13] under the shed blood he had offered the
[1:41:17] burnt
[1:41:18] offering and job stayed with that
[1:41:21] continually
[1:41:24] listen friends we don't ever want to get
[1:41:27] Beyond a
[1:41:29] place because we can't brother BR said
[1:41:31] he had to stay there himself stay dead
[1:41:35] there a constant
[1:41:37] prayer even throughout the day sometimes
[1:41:39] you can't even steal away throughout the
[1:41:41] day sometimes you're right in the middle
[1:41:42] of your job sometimes thoughts come
[1:41:45] sometimes things come maybe things
[1:41:47] sometimes you you know are set a certain
[1:41:49] way you get under pressure in your home
[1:41:52] the circumstances of life and something
[1:41:54] just didn't sit right and you go back
[1:41:57] and say forgive me for saying that
[1:42:00] forgive me for saying it that way maybe
[1:42:03] what was said there was things but we I
[1:42:05] I said it in the wrong way forgive me
[1:42:08] you know what that is it's a constant
[1:42:13] confession it's not things we're just
[1:42:15] looking for you know we're not walking
[1:42:16] around just looking for things but it's
[1:42:18] staying in contact with God right and as
[1:42:21] Satan wants to so divert our thoughts no
[1:42:23] wonder he wants to take our thoughts so
[1:42:25] many different directions because when
[1:42:27] we begin to think of a holy God yeah
[1:42:30] that even as the prophet said angels
[1:42:32] look dirty in his sight but remember the
[1:42:36] blood of Jesus Christ Has Lifted
[1:42:38] us back into our rightful
[1:42:42] position and that constant
[1:42:45] confession keeping out condemnation from
[1:42:48] your
[1:42:49] life remember Satan's always going to be
[1:42:51] there to accuse you
[1:42:54] I read that quotee I have heard but now
[1:42:55] I
[1:42:56] see he's always to accuse job now now
[1:42:59] listen Satan had
[1:43:02] records he said this wrong right he
[1:43:06] thought this wrong as a matter of fact
[1:43:09] he actually became critical of somebody
[1:43:13] you say brother Samuel that's not
[1:43:16] written in the word you're right it's
[1:43:19] not but in the New Testament neither is
[1:43:22] Abraham's wrong written either that's
[1:43:24] right that's good you know why between
[1:43:26] the Old Testament and the New Testament
[1:43:29] came The Mercy Seat of God in plain view
[1:43:32] Cain Calvary you never read about
[1:43:34] Abraham's doubting you never read about
[1:43:36] Abraham lying you never read about that
[1:43:39] you know why because the blood took care
[1:43:41] of
[1:43:42] it so good he had confessed it and it
[1:43:45] took care of
[1:43:46] it you you know what the
[1:43:49] revealing of the word in this hour of
[1:43:51] the Lamb coming into our midst you know
[1:43:53] what's to do make a church ready for
[1:43:57] Rapture it's to get a people ready for
[1:44:00] Rapture to where every lean that the
[1:44:02] devil has against you said why they
[1:44:04] can't do this and they can't go there
[1:44:06] and they can't do this they can't do
[1:44:07] that but the blood speaks better
[1:44:11] things and when the token has been
[1:44:13] applied the prophet said the devil can
[1:44:16] come and tease it that seal he can punch
[1:44:18] at it try to make you think you're not
[1:44:20] when you are he said but you know the
[1:44:21] desires of your heart you knew what you
[1:44:24] were before and what you are now that's
[1:44:27] right you know the things you once used
[1:44:28] to love and the things you love
[1:44:31] now what are you standing on what are
[1:44:35] you standing on you're standing in the
[1:44:37] same place that job stood in a type you
[1:44:40] are standing in divine revelation in the
[1:44:43] antitype Christ
[1:44:46] Jesus as Sons and Daughters of God in
[1:44:50] Heavenly places yes sir and standing in
[1:44:53] Heavenly places you think the devil is
[1:44:55] not going to come and try to battle at
[1:44:58] you oh he's going to
[1:45:00] war he's going to try to do everything
[1:45:03] he can to pull us out of that to get us
[1:45:05] so focused down here into this
[1:45:08] realm when everything is said and done
[1:45:11] here we are standing and there's a bride
[1:45:15] that is standing alone amen upon the
[1:45:19] word excommunicated from fellowships
[1:45:24] of all other
[1:45:25] churches but she's standing upon the
[1:45:28] word of God she's heard his
[1:45:32] voice she's responded to the knock upon
[1:45:36] her
[1:45:38] heart and there is a fun there is a
[1:45:41] fellowship that is going
[1:45:44] on what a privilege it is friends to
[1:45:47] have a faithful heart Amen Let me just
[1:45:49] tell you something David said it like
[1:45:51] this in Psalms 130 Lord if thou would
[1:45:54] that thou wouldest Mark iniquities who
[1:45:57] could
[1:45:58] stand let me just let you know this God
[1:46:01] doesn't have a chart with tally marks of
[1:46:04] all your good days and another column of
[1:46:08] all your bad days that's right that's
[1:46:10] right Jesus
[1:46:12] Remember God cannot see you when your
[1:46:16] confession is in the blood
[1:46:19] right that's why brother B said he said
[1:46:22] you can't can't backslide on God you
[1:46:24] backslide on Christ because it's the
[1:46:27] blood of Christ that has cleansed
[1:46:29] you right if it wasn't for the blood of
[1:46:32] Christ the moment we did wrong remember
[1:46:34] it was like Sarah when Sarah said no I
[1:46:35] didn't laugh what was it it was her
[1:46:37] husband's faith that was standing for
[1:46:40] her that's the same thing that stands
[1:46:42] for you and I it's his life inside of
[1:46:44] you and I that sometimes when we're in a
[1:46:46] MST and we respond I didn't and yet we
[1:46:50] did we did where was it at we laugh in
[1:46:53] our
[1:46:53] heart sometimes there's things we've
[1:46:55] said in our
[1:46:59] heart aren't you glad that there's one
[1:47:01] who's a
[1:47:04] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:47:06] the heart he don't just look on the
[1:47:08] outside and say you know what seems like
[1:47:10] everything is going good with Naomi
[1:47:12] she's got a nice cheery smile everything
[1:47:15] is good but God comes right down and
[1:47:18] he'll deal with the heart cuz you know
[1:47:20] what friends sometimes the way that we
[1:47:22] look at out here it's not how we feel in
[1:47:25] here
[1:47:27] absolutely sometimes we're just good
[1:47:29] actors I'm not saying anything wrong
[1:47:31] with that but you know what I'm glad
[1:47:33] that the word comes down to discern the
[1:47:35] heart
[1:47:37] right and I'm glad he comes and
[1:47:40] ministers to our hearts aren't
[1:47:42] you I'm glad that sometimes when we've
[1:47:44] got ourselves in a hole oh my sometimes
[1:47:46] in our thoughts depend on how you're
[1:47:48] made up oh my you can get I mean the
[1:47:50] devil can just start we laying on you
[1:47:52] and you're getting everything man you've
[1:47:53] done this wrong this wrong this wrong
[1:47:55] and this wrong and I'm not all together
[1:47:56] I'm not talking even about Sin
[1:47:58] necessarily I'm talking about things
[1:47:59] maybe decisions you've done this or
[1:48:00] you've done that and you've done this
[1:48:03] it's like you just feel like you're
[1:48:04] being way laid in a
[1:48:07] corner maybe I'm the only one but I
[1:48:09] don't think
[1:48:12] so but you know I'm thankful for the
[1:48:15] grace of God that will come in those
[1:48:18] moments now this is me I believe God
[1:48:21] permits those things
[1:48:23] so that we're able to be able to
[1:48:26] minister to one
[1:48:27] another oh
[1:48:30] yes not look and say brother Shane how
[1:48:32] could you get backed up in a corner like
[1:48:33] that no but to know that we pray for one
[1:48:37] another we don't go around and advertise
[1:48:40] it we don't go around and talk about it
[1:48:41] we don't post it on Instagram hey
[1:48:43] everybody pray for me today I'm in a
[1:48:46] corner and some of us were like that in

[1:48:58] him he he's the one that's told me all
[1:49:00] that

[1:49:04] Corners I need help out of them Corners
[1:49:06] yeah I need
[1:49:09] help you know why cuz we're still right
[1:49:11] here in
[1:49:12] this in my memory I can remember every
[1:49:16] one of my
[1:49:18] failures every one of my shortcomings
[1:49:21] and you think the devil don't want want
[1:49:22] to come around and try to point those
[1:49:24] things out but listen this is where Paul
[1:49:28] an
[1:49:29] apostle a prophet of God could say I
[1:49:34] have learned to forget those things
[1:49:39] which are
[1:49:42] behind and I'm reaching forward in other
[1:49:45] words that what all in the past has been
[1:49:49] confessed and it's placed under the
[1:49:51] blood I'm not not going to dwell there
[1:49:54] no
[1:49:56] longer it was like I'm sorry I got to
[1:49:59] tell that there was a lady that after
