to be together and so thank you for your prayers we we had a wonderful uh service I know some of you went through on Friday and uh and then uh some of the rest of us we came in on Saturday evening to brother Stevens and then ministered there on Sunday morning and the Lord was just so gracious to us and we just um I know brother Steven would request of you is the same as that just to keep them in prayer and uh you know they've just committed everything to to the Lord and what God's Will and that his will would be done amen and there was just a a wonderful support from his home Church there on Saturday evening and I think um quite a few had come over even from Brother Paul's on Friday that's what I had heard so we're just um just so thankful that we could uh be able to come together and just trying to encourage amen the the children of of God and um I tell you what brother brother Isaac man he preached on Sunday I tell you I I I text him I said my goodness man and uh you know I was sitting there was a little chuckling I I didn't text him about this but I thought he's going he's he's reading over and referring he didn't actually read him but he went right through some of the same quotes that I just had read right here isn't it incredible how God just was you know I just love that how God works in such a way God knows how to he knows how to plug things together you know and and I just God is so he's so wonderful and to me it's just the love of God that's what it is it's God's love to us amen and so we really appreciate that and amen so let's look here in the word of the Lord and uh go ahead and kick me over H okay thank you uh 1 Corinthians 12 and you pray for brother Gabriel back there he's like he's he's straddling two stations but I think I'll be okay with the with the the microphones here tonight and um but um I tell you sometimes you know you know when you're running so many different uh ships and how things are Ben left early Sunday morning got up early Sunday morning and drove back here so he could be here to to help with uh different things and then uh so I appreciate that and um then this morning he left from from Tennessee I don't know what he was doing down there but he was down there for a few days and so he drove up here and got in time you know for for service so I I really really appreciate that as well and um so it just kind of saves me a trip so I don't have to sit behind the board but anyhow it's good to be together isn't it amen and I know you're saying hurry up come on I'm ready to sit down it's Thursday it's Thursday come on 1 Corinthians 12 and verse one Paul said now concerning spiritual gifts Brethren I would not have you ignorant I love that I'm glad God wouldn't have us to be ignorant aren't you you know that you were Gentile and carried away unto these dumb Idols even as you were LED wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost and then verse four and we went through these last week there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit there are div differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations but it's the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all or to profit all may God bless you bless the reading of the word bless the service to our hearts and you know brother brandham would um he when having a meeting with uh the Brethren and he did that at different times um with uh taking sides with Jesus is one of those meetings that he had with the Brethren brother Bram was really disclosing his heart in that service and um there's things that brother Bram is saying in there in that message taking sides with Jesus that so much pertains to the family so much pertains to the local body and um he is speaking of how he's just come out of uh ministering on the restoration of the brid how how many of you remember that message and brother Bram is speaking of that of how that there had been such an in-depth study that had been done uh by himself and he had studied how the early church and just watched how they were and that's where brother Bram was able to draw from that out of the book of Acts because you know the book of Acts is 28 chapters but it doesn't mean that was 28 days you know many times when we talk about writing writing a book of Acts you realize that if you ever have uh in any time in your devotions uh sometimes I've switched back and forth from year to year sometimes I've done it in chronological and you know you you get one verse in in the book of Acts and then it Springs you over you're in the book of Corinthians for for the next week and a half and then all of a sudden it brings you back in the middle of that chapter of Acts because that's really how it was it wasn't just all one thing in a chapter there was so many things happening within there from all of those different letters that Paul wrote and I I like to say it in that way where it wasn't 28 days because there was a lot of events that took place in the book of Acts there was um differences between Brethren there was a lot of Supernatural that took place uh there was also there was churches and lives being established and and God working to uh establish the work in many different local places and how that then would come about churches where Paul would write of that and so with that this is where brother Bram even in his burden was seeing of how that the desire would be to have local outposts or places to we that this message there would be churches established that would be able uh to take the people on after their lives had been committed to the Lord through the meetings and so this is where he even is speaking you know in regards to uh the Brethren there and then he says even to fathers and he says you know we've got to make arrangements for our children that are coming behind us because we want to see this continue on now we know that God's word's Eternal and you can't stop God's word but it's something that must be in our hearts that Lord God gives us the grace and also sometimes God has to kind of stir us a little bit to help us to see that things aren't just going to happen but God works through instruments he works through man man is his agent that that God has chosen and yet we we don't need to it's not us reaching for things or trying to make things happen but it's simply staying within the continuity of what God desires to do in each season of time this is why that uh you know with things that uh I just was uh speaking and a a brother had had asked me to listen to a few different things and look at it because you know sometimes you can have and and sometimes I think uh when you know uh a person's can get in and they're looking at prophecy and they're wanting to make this fit and make this fit and and uh you know take this and they'll they'll take something that brother Bram has said and then they'll go way out here and and then you're looking and saying how did we get way out here from what brother brand said and so just simply I I sent back to the brother I sent just what come to me there on Friday I just sent back to him and I said look look what it says in Daniel when it said Daniel was stirred by the spirit of God and he understood by the book books of what time and hour so I said what was what what it what was was already in the books and that's what you recognize that in the message of the hour that when when the prophet of God being that of of the true prophet of God it was not him that was you know looking at Eisenhower and looking at kusf and saying oh I I wonder what could be here and I'm going to preach something that's so deep that when people leave out here they go wow that's deep but what did it do to me you see these are things that that's not what the prophet of God did as a matter of fact it wasn't something that he was trying to do it's God alerted him are you hearing me see the same way if we can catch this I'm going to go into some things here tonight once again you can see the parallel the way that God will work with these nine spiritual gifts that always have to be tested proven judged God the way that we can test it and operate it and prove it as well yes it has to be by the word but when it operates in its Purity it'll operate the same way that it operates through that of a prophet because you'll find that a lot of these gifts it over overlaps and how that it will it will work and operate the same way and I say that with this in with this with this in mind that it is not the prophet that was trying to figure things out but it was God alerting him to the hour and all of a sudden here he catches this of of of clay and he's catching those names those things are are standing out to him and right away the spirit of God announces for that of Daniel's image we are in the two big toes so it wasn't something that you know that brother Bron was trying to you know like a like a puzzle and trying to put together it's the season that we're in and God has a man man on the scene to catch the word of God for that hour that'll catch a people and a people will be come under that word and be prepared for that hour you know the more that we can look at it that in that way it it should give us a real rest and that's what the word as the word is continually being unfolded and what we would call Revelation Revelation never produces anxiousness right but real Revelation it's peace because what Revelation is it is God's will being sovereignly revealed which is Faith it brings a settl it brings a confidence within our lives so there's always things that we can check within it and there's nothing that within it that we ever have to press and and you know to try to uh get into and and move into but God has everything right in his season and in his time and so I want you just to catch where brother randam is saying this let me just read maybe a quotation to begin brother Bram says in each local church there's nine spiritual gifts that's given to the people and that's what you know of 1 Corinthians 12 speaking in tongues interpretations gift of Prophecy wisdom knowledge so forth those gifts go into the church every member of the body of Christ is subject to any of those gifts at any time see it's not that a person is born with a gift of speaking in tongues no the five ministerial offices is What is pre is for ordained by God but the nine spiritual gifts any member in the body of Christ is subject to him it's subject it can move right through this right brother BR says it can happen on one tonight and never and never again so it it is every member of the body of of Christ is subject to any of those gifts at any time God gives them and they work through the members of his church this is what I love they're all working together for one purpose to the perfecting of the body of Christ that's when everything is held within its continuity not only with the nine spiritual gifts no matter if it's uh any ministering any special singing anything we do even things that may not even be seen or known by anything else by anyone else but it is with one purpose for the body that's that's the labor that we have is for the body of Believers it's not it's not you know that that my part or your part you mine's any less yours any greater we all have a part to play Within this that's right and you know in order for that to be achieved it really it requires you and I and we'll always be tested within it on whether and how much that we are are willing cuz in order for you Unity you we've got to be able to be able to agree uh to disagree in order for Unity it it requires us to be able to lay aside our own opinions about things our own thoughts our own feelings for for a greater cause and that cause is for the body of Jesus Christ and so that's a very that's a very foundational point that Paul is working with among the Corinthian Church is to recognize it's about the body right it's not about your gift or or or what God would work through your life it's not about that it's about the body and so Paul working with them to help them to see that and to understand as well is that you know God is Sovereign in all of his ways God will use any whatever gift that that that he sees fit to use in his time and God might use it in one situation and there's another situation that is very comparable and and looks like wow God I'm going to expect God to use that gift over here God may not do that at all because when it all comes down to it if we're really really grasping what when the supernatural comes Among Us and something is said it's judged it's proven it comes out exactly just right on the mark then what that should do is not cause us to seek after that person but to recognize that God who gave that word is the same God that lives in my life am he's the same God that's with me at all times so it doesn't make us dependent on a gift it just causes our faith to rest in the Living God Amen how many of you think you know sometimes with prophecy and sometimes with things that's been spoken you know there's things where God can call it out like brother B said here uh there'll be a person com in tonight you know and tongue's interpretation was given and and they'll be in a green scarf and goes through all those things and then sometimes there's things that even can be years and years down the road brother brandham was stopped by a man and you'll find this in the message and and I have it tucked away in other places but brother Bram is stopped and he's trying to get to brother brandham and he he finally he gets to brother brandham and he says how do you spell your last name and brother brandham tells him and and he said your first name and and brother Brown tells him and he said Mama it's exactly right he said this is exactly right and what had happened is 255 years before brother Bram showed up on the west coast tongues and prophecy had went forth and they had wrote it on a piece of paper and they showed the paper to brother brandham it had been judged and then you know even when you look uh this is a little bit off but even the Book of Mormon I have that Book of Mormon of when you look within there of even wherein by that prophecy struck and it announced there will be one that will be coming with a Ministry by the name of William brandham but it's also very very important to know this is why what separates us and should separate our lives from being Pentecostals by denomination and that is we are believers we follow the word I hear what you're saying I can hear things and this hits and that hits but I want to know what you're teaching right because the Bible said it's known by their fruit but you know balum spoke things that was right on the money that's right is that right he got caught up and he spoke things that was right on the money but what made balum and error is for his teaching my my my my my so you know this is why that within everything God gives us such a Grace to be able to operate and to and to catch the leading of the holy spirit because I I think that within you know for the most part within hearts and lives you know it's wonderful to see the Supernatural and to sometimes when you can see that of a display but I want to just say it to you in this way there's no there really is no greater display of the supernatural than what God has done in your life amen you know sometimes the things that you don't even feel like when there's nothing taking place and yet God is working in your life because you know you can be healed but if God carries long enough you get sick again right but when your character has been molded and sometimes that's a silent work that's taking place and when that character is being shaped and being molded remember after all it's your character that God's going to Rapture and that's what's important so let's look here just a little bit in another another step here in the word we looked at last week the word of wisdom and then we want to look here tonight at the word of knowledge the Bible said to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit so when we look at this of the word of knowledge I want to just start in here with some scriptures when we look at in Proverbs 2:6 it says for the lord giveth wisdom and out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding he giveth Daniel said giveth wisdom unto the wise and knowledge to them that know understanding you see God I'm just say it in this way God's not going to waste his time God's going to make himself known among people who will believe it are you hearing me this is why Paul said that tongues is for the unbeliever right that's in the scripture but prophecy is for the believer because the believer will believe it yeah right and like Paul said they'll come in and they recognize when their heart has been deserted and they'll say God is with you now of course somebody could say well I don't I don't believe in that or they could turn around from it you know because it's it's exposing their life but I I want to say it in this way these are things that comes from God this is not Impressions no amen it's not a feeling about something it's it it is this with the word of knowledge it is something that is solely what God is doing that's how it is with every one of these nine spiritual gifts that's what the prophet would tell us over and over even where the Pentecostals got in trouble they came under Impressions and Impressions can seem so real right Impressions can seem can feel just like it's it's right on but this is the thing that is different is when it is not our thought because knowledge it deals with that of understanding intelligence it's not our thought the Bible said oh how great Paul said is the depths of his knowledge of his wisdom and who can instruct him right Hey listen look there was there was a man by the name uh um now I can't remember who was the one that just slipped my mind I was going to say Zephaniah but that ain't the one but remember he came and he grabbed a hold of the horns and Michael was standing there and he grabbed a hold of it and said well you know by this you're going to push on Ahab you're going to push them all out and and Micah Micah didn't even get carried away with what they were doing he knew where he was standing on the word of God you see what it was it was someone that was coming under an impression and through that listen it was let me just tell you then Wan the dud there was a great workup in that meeting yeah are you hearing me I mean it would have been a great workup the music would have been right everything would have been G it was what was it doing moving upon the emotions and they were they was going to prophesy just exactly according to Ahab but that's not how prophecy works it's not us dictating to God how to fulfill his word neither the word of knowledge it is God sovereignly dropping down and it's spoken out it's God so this is why I mean many things we could say within it but let me just give you a few places here and I want you just to watch how brother Bram is going into this he says now he says you know if we're trying to learn how to write the check for healing well now it might would do something it might he might do something that would speak to you of something that has been and it has to be the spirit of Prophecy or a gift of the word of knowledge that would go back down through life's journey and find something down through there and bring it back to your memory then you'd say that would be something that youd know comes supernaturally so notice that even within this you find how close that that is in working of Prophecy and and a word of knowledge brother BR says in my new ministry the ministry has not been my Ministry to lay hands on the sick it's been to make by a Divine gift to bring the presence of the Lord Jesus in Presence by a discernment of spirit which is called in the Bible a gift of knowledge and in doing so it makes him manifest before the people and then they receive him as their healer that settles it now let's just look at this for a moment here is brother Bram standing here in this realm he doesn't know this person person that's coming up here on the platform right he doesn't know them and here they come up on the platform and and not only not only is a situation discerned but even many times their address is called out right is that right things that the holy spirit is so is so punctual to call to call out within that now I'm going to ask you whose intelligence was that that whose knowledge was that see this is why brother BR could say he said oh he says I hear you saying amen out there he said but down in here I hear coming out here you're saying it's psychology oh my so people were saying amen here but down here they were calling it psychology you see they were looking at it as being mind reading and to the Natural mind it's like how is this done but you know if they only read the Bible right it was through the life of the Lord Jesus and all the way back down through the Old Testament that's the kind of God we serve we're not talking about a god who's coming to manage current crisis we're talking about a god before there ever was a devil it was already set the end from the beginning before there was ever any hurt any wound any mistake anything he was already God and he saw the end from the beginning and God has committed himself by his word and God would allow a prophet to be lifted up even to where how many times when you hear the prophet and he'll say it in this way I love this particular quote he says oh I I I see you praying near your bed and and you're praying about this situation and I hear your prayer in a land called prayer Hallelujah you see sometimes we think our prayers are not going anywhere but there's a land called prayer Hallelujah some of you older ones you remember when I preached on that years ago the land called prayer where here when go that and listen we're experiencing we're getting ready to experience the effects of that land called prayer we have many times but we're getting ready to experience it when all of the prayers that's been offered up and looking for the coming of the lord it's going to be poured out upon our lives in Rapture the Fulfillment of every prayer it has not went wasted or unheard but it's all going to come in its season and its time this is why prayer is so important there and God allowed a prophet to tap in to that land called prayer and hear what that person was praying and then to announce them that your answer is here even to be able to take with Bud Southwick and his situation with his brother who was an epileptic case couldn't get free and notice the Lord would speak to the prophet and said he's going to he have this color shirt he have this kind of shirt yeah when he comes you get that you take that shirt and you throw it in the fire right you remember that I'm a witness brother brother Eddie bisc tells that and and here what God brought God brought a Deliverance to brother Bud's brother he was free now where did that knowledge come come from because to you and I it would not seem to make sense oh I take the I take the man's shirt off and throw it in the fire but God knows what he's doing the the symbol and all of those parts within it and I'm just saying to you what knowledge is that it's not the knowledge of man God lifted the prophet up and had him to speak those things in that time it was a gift of knowledge being manifested through that of a prophet so what you'll find as we're going through these nine spiritual gifts you'll find that each one of these nine spiritual gifts there's been a lot of these things that's already been been it's it's it's been uh exemplified or shown or manifest through that of a prophet to me it's only fitting you know why CU it shows what it is in its Purity now a prophet it don't have to be judged he's born a prophet I've read that to you over and over the prophet said nobody sets before a prophet but when it operates as one of the nine spiritual gifts it's got to be judged Hallelujah that's where and I've read this to you but I think it's good to remind us as we're on it this is why brother Brandon would say that statement over and over and talk about how the latter Reign Brethren got it all mixed up because somebody gave a prophecy and all of a sudden they laid hands on him and said you're a prophet brother BR said that's an error right it's a gift of Prophecy right and it's got to be judged see that err and how that all started when you hear Brother R talking about that latter rain that's what was going on those are things that was taking place in that hour in that time now watch how brother Bram says this once again he says I've seen Lots called discernment and I don't believe in but I know there's truly a Discerning spirit of God the gift of knowledge that calls and speaks and it's perfect every time and we're earnestly contending for that that faith that was once delivered to the Saints now when brother BR says it would that's perfect every time we're talking there in that of not only on the prophetic realm of where the Prophet is standing and you'll never find one you'll never find one discernment that was wrong right you'll never find one that was wrong it was everything was hitting right on the dot you know why said because I've never trusted in myself I've trusted in him there because we're talking about a prophet now if it could hit perfectly through that of a prophet could God not hit perfectly through a body you could say well it's got to be judged that's true that's what helps to keep things perfect right is that it's judged and if something slips out of the line here here or there like the prophet said then we get that evil spirit out from among us and we go on now this is why think of this this word when when Paul would write of this and he would say if I come to you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine and Paul goes in bringing on that distinction of sound and and you know except that give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is piped or heart for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle now this scripture how fitting for Paul to place this right here because this is where brother bham himself when he begin to really bring things down in the Tabernacle and you hear Brother Bram I've read to you different quotes where different ones would say say this very phrase and it and and and brother B Echoes it right there at the Tabernacle when he not only does Church order but then when he comes around in question answer 64 he said there were those when brother bradam started speaking on how that these gifts should be in such reverence and they should hit right on the money and he they said brother Bram you're putting us on the spot and brother BR says don't you think I'm on the spot every single night on the platform this is why brother BR says in church order 1963 he says we don't want anything but real and genuine in other words God don't just give us something and say just take care just have this and I'll give you the real after a while no we want real we want genuine we just don't want to have something to say we have something we want to have real and have genuine I'm quoting his words with on that because a lot of different things can can come in with that and I I thank God for the grace that he's given us here within this assembly but I believe God wants to give us more grace and I believe when we look here in the scripture that this if if think about it brother caros you've been in the military and others that's been in there you listen for certain sounds to know what to do you don't you don't hear a certain sound brother Gomez you were in the military too right he can't hear me somebody piped the trumpet to him what a scripture what a point to say it on I'll get it afterwards but you know we we we at least we kind of know a little bit about this that you you you hear certain things and you know what to do like if I were to hear certain things they had tapes you know that when my brother was stationed in fort Fort Riley Kansas they had tapes and you know those neat little things and I think my dad bought some of them you know with this thought in mind and and you know you're playing them I don't know what they mean but they have a meaning to those who are trained to that and that's the same way it is with the nine spiritual gifts it's not just things in general it's not just things things that just left up in the air but God is specific to give you and I Direction amen just as he is with his word it's not something that's back and forth and you know well I don't know where we're standing and I don't know maybe this or maybe that this is why that like the prophet said to his fire as like a minister if it's not solid in your heart and you know what you're preaching don't get up and preach it until it is solid with you sometimes that gets you know kind of convulated or mixed around with or they they think they know it listen you better know where you're standing when you're approaching the word of God we can't stand here and say well it might be this or it might be that there's got to be an absolute and that absolute comes by when the word has been revealed then the people can rise in confidence this is why the spirit of God would take things laying right down through the word and a person could say well brother R says this over here and says this over here but God supplies a gift to be able to tie those things together so that they're not they're not conflicting but it actually works together when the spirit of God gets a hold of it and it brings stability now this word of knowledge let's look let's look here in second Kings chapter 6 I'm going to give you a few examples here tonight second Kings chapter 6 verse 8 here's Elisha the the Bible says the king of Syria wared against Israel and took counsel with his servants saying in such and such a place shall be my Camp so the king is is is telling his subjects of Syria we're going to Camp here and the man of God sent unto the king of Israel saying beware that thou pass not such a place for thither the syrians are come down and the king of Israel sent to the place which the man of God told him and warned him and saved himself there not once nor twice therefore the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled for this thing and he called his servants and said unto them who's the Spy who's the double agent who's working here for the other guy you know who's go who's working for Israel and verse 12 one of his servants said none my Lord O King but he Elisha the prophet is in Israel and tth the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bed chamber amen what was it it was a word the word of knowledge beware they're coming at this advancement and God through the word of knowledge gave a gave an issue to that of the king of Israel and he was able to defeat the enemy cannot God do the same thing for you and I God can direct that word coming right down and let us know this is where the enemy is preparing his attack oh God help us not just to wonder when a message is being preached and what we're looking at because listen friends sometimes the things that God is saying I've never ceased to see it the things that sometimes God is saying right now it's what's coming down the road amen God working to stabilize us this is why yes I'm thankful for the word you know I love when the word comes and my understanding to shout in it but remember when it touches my life it's something that God is speaking to my life to give direction you say wait a minute brother Samuel you're talking about the word of knowledge how do you think a preacher preaches brother brandham even tells us he said God will drop down knowledge and anoint that man and that man can begin to minister that word to where you can begin to see it's a finished work what is it it's God working through through through his body it's called moving right while the word's going to going taking place oh aren't you glad you know that's why we don't have to sit in our seats and you know bite our fingernails and run to the bathroom and wait for the end of service for God to do something we know that God is a god of his word and God can come right where the word is coming forth and fill with the Holy Ghost burn out sin burn out desire and give answers to our lives that's the kind of God we serve the Lord now notice notice how the prophet puts this Elisha seen where that King was going he was going to do and he sent to the king of Israel and said now don't go down that way because they're laying down there waiting and watch that same Prophet after going down to Dothan the angel of the Lord never showed him about the syrians coming out and covering the City over for God had another way for that ain't that incredible I mean you you can see it in your Bible right down the very next passage and God has told him here's the king HEI coming right here over here coming right there coming right there then he goes down to Dothan and gazel wakes up you know gets the espresso machine going pours in the beans everything you know and all of a sudden he's not ready to face the day and he had had his cup of coffee and to see all of those mountains filled with the Enemy oh dear lord what are we going to do and Elisha gets out there sleeping his eyes and said you got the coffee going yet right now God could have showed Elisha they're going to surround the city they're going to do this Elisha but you see sometimes the way God works it's all in his sovereignty God is not working that we become dependent on a gift right Hallelujah but a gift is only to make known his presence his care for our lives but to build our faith as a matter of fact it was Elisha and brother Bram tells us he said Elisha didn't even see those angels on the mountain he said what it was he said Elisha had confidence in the word that was spoken that the angel of the Lord encampeth around about those that fear and love him Oh my he was able to see God's word is true so he can stand there and say God open his eyes you know what the opening of his eyes would have been it would have been then the word of knowledge he would see and understand this is what's given peace to this man right here Elisha had a true knowledge of God and it gave him peace even in the midst of all that he was looking at and that's before he even had his coffee God don't show his servants all things but he shows his servants just the word of knowledge as much as they have need to know it lays in God's power not in the power of man though man be blessed but yet God is the father and the ruler overall my wife and I were talking here just the other day it might have been last week now that we're talking about it she she'd been listening to that message I had been telling y'all to listen to questions and answers God being misunderstood and she said you know I said I listen to that and hear how that somebody asked brother Bram they sent him a note and said brother Brandon would you pray that God will let me find my keys you know I few people came to mind that lose their keys you know and uh you know brother Bram talks about that I you wonder how many requests brother Bram got like that he told us how many requests he got can you imagine if God would have left his Prophet here oh my his cell phone would have getting blown up Lord can you tell me where brother brother R can you tell me where my keys are at brother R can you tell me how the crops are going to come out brother Ram can you tell me this brother B can you tell you know what it would have been a bride that was leaning on the man and would have been but remember Rebecca was to be brought back to Isaac and what God manifested was only the sign of who it came from hallah are you with me listen friends all of us I'm talking about all I'm not talking about people I'm talking about all of us can you imagine because it could be it can become a tendency it's very easy in our humanness because we're made to rely we're made to rest we're made to trust right God help us if somebody lets us down God help us I mean but you see God doesn't want us relying on a gift or a man you know God don't even want you relying on the gift of your pastor that's right there's 's an element of it you have to trust that God is moving down through that gift to speak and give what you have need of but then taking that word and living by that word and applying it to our lives to know God that's what I have need of so then it is in US telling God what to do it's God giving direction to us so it operates this word of knowledge it operates in the same way watch watch how that brother Ram goes into this he says where Pentecost failed he says God forsaw placed in set of certain things to happen and therefore he could take the prophets with the gift of knowledge and for show them what was going to be and they could speak it because it's a word of knowledge that God gives to his Prophet right how many where brother brandham here he is God's Prophet but you just couldn't go up to brother brandham and say brother Bram can you tell me this you couldn't this is why brother brand when I've given an example over and over with that little that lady that had that problem where she had went out on her husband and he had done the same thing too she brother Bradon didn't know what was going on in her life and he said when the angel of the Lord comes back to the house I'll send mey to get you you see so it wasn't just something we can just call up at any time or work up at any time and and even and it wasn't even it wasn't even something to wear that different ones you know even where brother bham they wanted him to come to Germany and to pray for the stash Cliff baby they had a they had a military G jet waiting on him but he says just a moment sister St let me go see what father says about it because surely God could have raised that little boy up how many did he did he raise up healed the blind eyes I tell you sometime when we get through the other side I think God I want to I want to shake sister stads Cliff's hand right because when you see as she her little baby was taken on home to be with the Lord and she questioning herself I must not have had faith I must not have been you know had a real good faith in brother on the contrary he said you had great faith because even when God made the decision to take your little baby you have stood firm with your testimony amen so to think that even it wasn't just something that could you know take place and just happen and you know but everything was in God's timing in God's way and and notice brother says a vision is God by a word of knowledge dropping to the person to foresee something or tell something that has been or something that'll be he goes on and says in the Hebrew series what is prophetic it is just his knowledge he's the chief attorney he the judge and he speaks to the lawyer some of his wisdom and that's the prophecy that that can foretell because he knows what it's going to be so here here is the judge and he's able to speak to the lawyer we've not we've not got a second-handed revelation this is not a man who's winning in prob but a prophet is one who is caught up by God he's an eagle that is caught up here's the written word but he's caught up into the thoughts of God and comes back down and he gives to you and I the prophet is a Divine interpreter of the word it's a gift of knowledge what does it bring it brings subtleness it brings understanding this is why brother BR said you think Isaiah cursed a people like that no but by seeing a vision which God had already knew before the foundation of the world by for knowledge and Isaiah looked in and seen what was coming and Isaiah reported what God had said before the foundation of the world for this word here tonight is only what God said before the world was created and with a prophet and it's called a gift of knowledge now remember remember the thought within this that it'll operate in the same way now God's not through one of the nine spiritual gifts God's not coming down with a gift of knowledge as one of the nine spiritual gifts and is all of a sudden going to give some sort of a you know uh like where a prophet is caught up and he catches the interpretation of the word but God comes down to deal with situations that are present within our lives things that are alt together not altogether written in the word now you might say well brother Samy you said moments ago that God will come down and anoint that with knowledge well the prophet said that and a minister will speak but he's not just taking he's taking what's written but God is the one who creates and gives you a vision so that you can begin to see yourself as a whole person it's God that begins to give that and and you begin to see yourself in the word that I am healed it's made so real as a matter of fact I love how brother B said it he said if you can get a vision in front of you of a perfectly whole person then walk step by step by step until you become that person that's what the word does look on the counter on the other side What did the what did the nine the the 10 spies they had a word right and it was knowledge of Earthly knowledge look how big the Giants are look how the cities we're nothing we're in no comparison and that knowledge brought fear and all they saw they already saw themselves defeated we were in our own eyes as grasshoppers that Vision was a vision of defeat but Caleb and Joshua come back and here and stabilizing the people of God was to bring a vision of Victory now let's look here in the scripture let's go over to Second Kings I and I I could have just put it up there but I just want to refer to it and you can we can jump down through here just a little bit in 2 Kings chapter 3 and verse 14 here's a here's another situation that has come about and here is Elisha you have some that have gotten in trouble and they don't even know remember jehosaphats went along you know with uh out there you know uh and and and and and as he's he's lined up with with the wrong company and he goes out there and and they're out there without water right now look at the mercy of God they don't know how to get out of that fix they're in sure and they need they need the wisdom they need the knowledge of God what do we do in this situation let me tell you friends let me just say it to you like this sometimes that's the greatest thing we could do instead of trying to find and make things happen on our own are you hearing me I'm just speaking from my heart tonight because we can try to do things on our own and let me just tell you if you've already gotten a fix you got to come to a spot to say I'm in a fix God I need help I need help don't try to well I'll do it on my own you're listen you ain't proving nothing to nobody you ain't proving nothing to nobody and stop trying to show off for the devil cuz that's all it is just wanting to get on your flesh that oh I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that we do have the most powerful message but God has not just given us knowledge the first thing he sent down was wisdom that's what the message came by cuz we can have a lot of knowledge but we can get in trouble with that knowledge without wisdom governing it so we don't want to Lord I need your help they at least right here they could call out and they went and got one they got a man and by the name of Elisha we need help in this situation God I need help oh God may we have that kind of humility Lord I need help however you're going to speak to my heart however you're going to direct it Lord whether it's going to come through an answering prayer well I'm listen to a message right across the pull pit or God will it'll come down and anoint someone it'll be proven out judged received and that answer will go forth but any rate God I need help you know brother brandham walked a long time by his knowledge when he was as a Trapper well Bill brandham you're not lost you're not lost you know right where you are you know right where you are hi Mr mountain lion you know right where you are he come back around hi Mr Mountain Li you know right where you are Bill brandham you're a good Trapper hi Mr Mountain Li he's hi Mr Mountain line how many times he kept seeing that mountain line over and over that he killed and then finally he got to a place I'm lost listen friends that story not only pertains to when someone needs a real surrender in their heart to God but it also pertains to us sometimes cuz we can get lost in a swil of things of events that takes place in our life that gets us so turned around but we can look into the message of the hour there's one thing that this message showed us was humility oh God I'm lost and all of a sudden those clouds cleared and he could see that line he started walking with his hands up he caught a hold of that line because he knew at the end of it is where my wife and my little boy is at and this is where heing them Elisha is not the one who got into this but Jehoshaphat did and with the company and them not going out and seeking God as they ought to but now they started seeking God man I'll tell you I wish I had time just to preach on that just a little bit can you imagine what the devil got on their shoulder and said look at you you went off without prayer you really think that God's going to answer you now you went off without even praying this proven out this has been nothing but your reasoning your thoughts and you thought you had everything lined up you you know what the devil was trying to do he was trying to th their call for help but they there was enough enough about that that there was a call that said we need to hear from God and God gave the word of knowledge and what he told him is you're going to have to dig this Valley full of ditches true you don't have to put the water in it the same one that was with in that rock that followed them he'll fill it up but you dig it out you see sometimes it's it's us getting rid of our own self digging out and here God filled it up you know what it did not only did they give them water to drink from but the very water that they were sustained by God caused it to look as though that for the enemy turned and ran in defeat that's right amen Hal what did that the word of knowledge going on over to chapter 4 here's a widow hey these are these are serious situations these are situations it's not written in chapter five of what to do when the creditors coming for your children it's not written in the word so here she calls for Elisha hey there's a need my children they're getting ready to be taken and the Creditor coming and all of these things are are are happening and she says in verse one thy servant knowest that my thy servant did fear the lord he had a testimony and the Creditor has come to take take unto him my two sons to be bondman and Elisha said unto her what shall I do for you tell me what thou Hast in thy house and she said thine handmade hath not anything in the house save a pot of oil Hallelujah I wonder how many times she walked by that pot of oil and little did she know that the Deliverance that she had need of was already in her house let me just tell you the Deliverance that you have need of is here the Deliverance you have need of if I can take the words of a prophet out of one in a million one in a million he said healing is in you already it's laying within there already it's right there God has given to you what is needed Hallelujah to drive back the Creditor for your family God told him what to do go go borrow many vessels how many just go borrow as many as you can get and finally they filled they closed the door they filled every one of them up and then they went back to him and said we've done what you said do what do we do now the word of knowledge said go sell it and when you sell it you'll be able to pay the creditors and you'll be able to live off that oil Hall I wish I could preach right there for a while my my my my my God is so good isn't he you see what did that the word of knowledge came right down and gave that's right knowledge for this situation this why brother brand says a prophet is also a gift of knowledge it's like an attorney who studies the books and when you got to hire an attorney to app plead your case he's only taking what he knows and you're paying him for what he knows to present your case before the judge and now a gift of knowledge in the Bible is prophecy which goes up and finds out these things that are to come and brings them back down but they must compare with the Bible and with the book and if they're out of the book then then they're not received because the judge judges by the book you see so it must be on the word now how how is a prophet let's look at this how is a prophet judged by the word right by the word he's not judged by signs and wonders he's judged by the word is that right because balum had a lot of true bam had true signs and wonders but how do you judge him Moses said in Deuteronomy 13 He said when that when that man what he says comes to pass and this and that he said but if he seeks to lead you away from the word it's a false prophet now so there's emphasis and we've we've seen this just give me just a just a few more moments we've seen emphasis of things and brother Paul Paul had to deal with that in in in in Corinthian in the Corinthian Church and brother BR says and hearing him he says the world's Dying For Love that's the fountain that God's got open look I want to ask you something the greatest of all gifts that's in the local body and we put so much emphasis on speaking with tongues or interpretations and the first is wisdom the next is knowledge how are you going to operate knowledge when you haven't got wisdom to operate it with if you haven't got no wisdom you can't operate your knowledge if you haven't got knowledge you won't know how to have peace you've got to put first things first not on evidences upon the spirit and upon God now when you I want you to think of this in this manner here how wisdom and knowledge just just moving and working together like brother Bram was bringing this right here with you got to have wisdom remember brother Bram tells us in the one place he said he said you know how they were doing with the gifts and you know and just the way things were being done and brother BR said not having no control over it he said but you've got to have wisdom to know how to control it right it just like this brother Bram when he says this and you remember this in Christ The Mystery of God revealed when brother Bram was standing there and he gives us a little bit of an Insight that really really the whole way that he's wanted uh to be able to do it the whole time is one on-one with people and and frankly he tells us in that in that paragraph he said he said because there's many times where there's things you cannot disclose out here publicly because he said if you did it would cause Penitentiary offenses because things being unfolded now what is it knowledge but you've got to have wisdom to operate with that knowledge it just like when Paul if you think Paul just for a moment when he Paul was boy he was in a hot place and here was Pharisees and Sadducees you know how they they had got Paul and he he stands out there in the temple and Paul stands up he surveys his congregation he realized he got some Pentecost got some Baptist here and so let me just see here well there's about 80 Baptist and 20 Pentecostal and Paul got up and said who believes in eternal security right there he just split that congregation he's already got people that's going to stand up for him you know what Paul said Paul said I'm one who believes in the resurrection right away he already got people on his side that was wanting to Stone him what was that wisdom it was knowledge on what to say at that moment this is why he said don't take no thought what you shall say right there's a wisdom that God gives within those times even how did Paul he never pulled his Roman citizen passport Visa whatever you go he never pulled that out all the time hey I'm a Roman citizen hey I'm a Roman citizen but when the Holy Spirit urged him and they threw him in that Philippian jail he pulled it out is that right he had knowledge of what he had and it was wisdom that said pull it out right now see wisdom operating with knowledge that's why when God is sent in this hour like we were looking at last week and you look over in the Book of Revelations and the prophet will always take us there with that gift here is wisdom let him that hath wisdom count the number of his name you see because wisdom has come to bring stability to the Church of the Living God and wisdom bring with it also knowledge it gives understanding now you look at the effect brother brah says you can't have peace without knowledge it's it's it stabilizes this is why you look at Solomon's kingdom Solomon prayed for wisdom and he prayed for knowledge God I don't know I don't know how to lead these people and God gave him according to his request and he says I'm also going to give you what you didn't ask for right you see he was putting the emphasis on the right things and because the emphasis was on the right things God said I can trust you with these other things and what was the result there was peace there was peace in Solomon's kingdom right there was peace within it because there was wisdom that was residing there it's the same same thing that will even take place when the scripture said the Earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover the sea even when it comes in the Millennium how the knowledge will cover this time during that time of the Millennium brother Brown says it like this Jesus never gathers with people just to be gathering Jesus never does did anything Loosely and I think that's the trouble with the church today we take too many of the things of God Loosely and I perceived that this is a Pentecostal Gathering he said you're my brothers and sisters but the Pentecostal people are too Loosely with the gifts that's in the church and that's the reason God can't respect them you just let them go any old way and they should be governed and put in order and brother Bram goes on here how that you know we find you know uh uh interruptions in the meetings and and things like that and and how that things you know are are taking place I don't know what is happening here he says we find those interruptions and then you find that and it's just it the misuse it causes a damper to be thrown on the meeting and he says we so misuse these things just letting it go freelance I looked that word up cuz I've heard that word freelance before you know what freelance is it means it's not on it's not under the control right it just goes you know brother Aaron you're you're you're a you're a you're one who works with concrete but you got a company you work for you can't just take and say I'm going to take you know I going to make some money on the side I'm going to take this drill and I'm going to go or this saw and I'm just going to go over and you know hey you know I'm just going to take this sa do no no your your skills and all those things belong to that company right so this is why like brother Bram is dealing with the gifts and things like that this is why it goes together with the whole body it's not pulling it off to the side pulling it off separate and and I'm going to go freelance I you know I I I just just go I I don't need to I don't need to be under we don't need to be under under any control any governance oh that's no we want to be under the leading of the Lord outside of that woo there's death we want to be under the leading of the Lord is that right so notice that's just as good as a devil would want if them gifts had been set in order and put in its place there'd be Revival sweep this land today that's never been exceeded we don't lack power we lack knowledge we lack Faith oh my let me just let me finish fin on this here I want you to watch how even in brother bram's meetings I'm going to skip down to this and I want you to see this many many places in questions and answers brother Rams asked a question how am I supposed to show my wife that I really care for her and yet stay with the word by but still having a question like this said why don't you practice what you preach or believe so the man's been he's he's asking brother Brandon my wife how do I how do I how do I show her that I really care for her and stay with the word and yet she this is what she says why don't you practice what you preach or believe and brother Brown goes into that and he begins to give the direction for for this brother and and saying you know well if if you're not not living the right kind of life you know your your wife's got a right to say that but he told her he said but he tells the man he says stay in love with her and let her see Jesus in you now how does she how does how does one see Jesus in US you got to stay close to him you got to stay close to him brother BR says how do we win our loved ones by staying loyal to what we believe is that right now many of these questions that you look at this in questions and answers that brother Brandon would be asked I look at how that just so struck my heart of how that here it would not even be something on a private interview but it would be just the word of knowledge would come down and with wisdom on how to operate within those situations that would give Grace to to those individuals such as you know brother Bram when he was you know being asked you know different different times different questions like this within marriages one's a Believer and one's not and and this and and brother bandam you know is is is just letting them know don't be contentious about things but be you know staying in love and staying sweet and and he's talking about you know well if he ask you to go to that to the church you you can go get it you can eat a crumb but you know you just you stay with what you believe if anything goes against that grain don't don't go along with that what is it because she could because the wife or the husband in any one of these situations they could have just pulled out statements that God had opened to them and could have obliterated their spouse and done it all you know it have been like I do this in the name of Jesus I take your head off in the name of Jesus I do this in the come on Friends some of us when we first started serving the lord we took some people's heads off by the knowledge that we had but God had to give us wisdom because it was wisdom to know when and how to release our knowledge how to operate all of those things even how brother brandham worked with you know his his his his daughter-in-law Lois in the house and things like that and her you know her and and and and Billy you know and how everything was how that God gave the gave such knowledge and such wisdom and so I just want to you know maybe just close it out in this way here tonight this example with Paul and I'm not going to have you read it but you remember when Paul was on his way to Rome and Paul had told him don't don't let loose from here because there's going to be a serious there's going to be there's going to be we're going to suffer the ship's going to suffer loss there's going to be some things but they went ahead anyhow because they believed those of the ship and what they knew they followed them they got out there and you know this you know the whole story and where everything got to they thought they were going to die but Paul came up the angel of the Lord met him and he said the angel of the Lord whose servant I am amen and Paul goes in to let them know we're going to make it we're going to come up we're going to crash up an island but we're going to make it and he let them know further on down in there because there were some men that wanted to try to escape but they prevented their escape those men didn't even know what they were trying to where they were trying to escape from was actually their source of safety right and Paul told him said except you abide in the ship you'll not survive there's no other place of safety amen but in Jesus Christ amen you look at the storm you look at the situation but the word of knowledge says just abide in the ship don't don't jump ship just abide in the ship because why this storm too Hallelujah shall pass you love him hallah let's pray Heavenly Father lord it's you that give sense and understanding to your word father now Lord I pray tonight Lord as we just taken just a a few moments here tonight Lord to look at this lord of the word of knowledge Lord we see it operating there among the prophets and I'm I'm thankful God you would give us an example because what you would do is you just don't leave something for us to guess but you have given such an example that Lord the way that this would be operated through the prophets it would just it would come with your desire to be that perfect within one of the nine spiritual gifts it's true Lord that within this of the nine spiritual gifts it's always got to be tested it's got to be judged it's got to be tried we can see Lord so many of the closeness Within These different things when I know no doubt the Lord as the brothers and sisters setting here right now no doubt there's things that comes back to their mind of even certain quotes that I've read them already and things that they've heard through the message where your Prophet would tell us there would come that and say tell so and so to move away from the river there's going to be a flood that's coming and this and this and this all of those who live in that Basin get away from it Lord what would that be it'd be the word of knowledge oh it be that of prophecy that's true but it would be the word of knowledge not something that would be interpreting the word but it would be like that of Elisha when the king of Syria was coming down to try to entrap Israel but father you had a man by the name of elishah that Lord that you would make yourself known to and he would be able to give them warning of what was coming Lord to me it gives us comfort it gives us Comfort to know that Lord that you are indeed God of your word you're watching over it Lord father in every one of these just like with that of the word of knowledge Lord It's that that you use in your own sovereignty Lord I pray that God that you would help us maybe here tonight Lord with just some of the examples that was mentioned here tonight father may we be able to Lord reach up to you maybe there's Lord a life a heart maybe there's a need that's here tonight that would just say Lord I'm reaching out to you Lord I I need I need help Lord I need strength Lord I I I I need leadership I need Lord I need the wisdom and knowledge of God I need your leadership Lord father maybe there lord it's in a situation that was kind of like that that Elisha experienced maybe with the widow woman Lord maybe it's like that experience Lord where they were out there in the desert without any water and become parched but father in every one of these situations we've Sal here tonight many more we could have went into Lord but with Paul through Elisha we see your love and your care father how that God that you are watching out for us as your children even Lord when we have went away sometimes Lord and went on our own thinking about things but God you and your Mercy would reach out to us Lord and father we thank you dear God for that tonight we ask that Lord for each of these needs that's been among us tonight Lord those that have been written those that are Unwritten Lord father we lift him before your throne right now Lord in prayer dear God I ask that you'll meet and minister to each one of them Lord I pray that God that father as we have looked in upon these things tonight Lord Jesus the emphasis Lord that we desire where any emphasis to be placed is upon you father Lord we thank you knowing that God you've placed these gifts in the local body like your Prophet tells us Lord that it's for one purpose the perfecting of the body of Jesus Christ Lord Jesus we want to be completely Lord under the word of God we want to just stand Lord Jesus our hearts Lord open and available to you Lord we the thing Lord what cries from our hearts Lord is Purity Lord the desire to know that God that you would give such Purity Lord there's there's pure gifts Lord there's pure prophecy there's pure tongues Lord pure interpretations pure wisdom pure knowledge Lord there is Purity like your Prophet told us when they came out of Egypt there was purity of manifestation H Lord Jesus we love you father to have Lord that The Giver would have a hold of our life then Lord that's what's most important and with every every need that we could have you'll Supply Lord you give Lord just exactly what we have need of it when we have need of it we've seen that with Elisha Lord he was a man that was in contact with you you told him about where the syrians were going to be but you did not tell tell him how the syrians were going to come down and try to find him and surround the city you didn't tell him that he didn't need to know that but Lord it showed when that happened he didn't fall apart Gesa did but Elisha didn't Elisha didn't say God why didn't you show me this you you've always showed me you've showed me this but Lord there's to me what's incredible is so much of it not under not under any man's handle but under your discretion Lord you know just how much to do for us because Lord You're the whole goal is that our faith would be settled in you our confidence would be in you Lord father I thank you Lord God for your mercy in this hour help us Lord I pray that in every situation Lord we're depending on you we're depending Lord for the next Lord the next
