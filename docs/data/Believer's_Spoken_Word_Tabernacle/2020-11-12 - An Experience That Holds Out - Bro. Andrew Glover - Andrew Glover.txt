really address to me the message of the hour it's what addresses present day conditions it gives us the real discernment and the direction you take the message of the hour away from us you take discernment away right because the message of the hour is not books and tapes it's the person of Jesus Christ revealed and that's what brings discernment in this hour of where we are who we are where we're going it gives focus and gives direction to us in this hour it's a great comfort to know that he's with us amen he's seeing us through amen let's just if we could we want to stand and just want to invite brother Andrew and let's sing that song Touching Jesus that's all that really matters amen cuz that's a truth tonight Hallelujah a woman tried so many [Music] position yet grew worse so to

how many believers do we have here this evening amen we know that if Believers are among us then all things are possible amen amen if Jesus Christ comes tonight then there's a faith in our heart to reach out and touch him then we can get the same results here tonight that the woman at the well God the woman with issue of blood God it's not so much of where you're at or what you're going through it's just being able to reach out and touch him and I believe tonight he's passing through the building how many has a need tonight maybe a sickness a discouragement something in your life you need from the Lord won't you just bow your hearts with us this evening and let's look to him look away from the preacher or from anyone else and look to him tonight Heavenly Father Lord as your believing children have gathered themselves together here this evening Lord we come Lord for a service no doubt in our minds Lord a time that has been set aside we have planned today and Lord different things to be here tonight but Lord I pray now that we're here dear God that this will not be just another service Lord this will not be just another gathering of people it will not be just another Lord Thursday night meeting Lord but may this be a night where lives will be changed Lord may this be a night where Hearts will be touched Lord father you know the needs and the situations of homes and

skepticisms and all kinds of things may they all be driven back tonight for your honor and glory and whatever is accomplished here we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the believer said amen amen amen God bless you this evening if you have your Bibles you're still standing with us we'll invite you to the book of St John the 4th chapter the book of St John the 4th chapter and we want to take this opportunity to greet you tonight in the name of the Lord Jesus we sure count it an honor and a privilege to be here with you once again good to see everyone out in the house of God tonight and we just want to uh look here in the book of St John the 4th chapter and I have just a simple thought here on my heart but I just pray that it'll be a be a blessing to you in St John the 4th chapter chapter and in the 15th verse I have just a maybe a lengthy reading here if you wouldn't mind standing with me St John 4 and: 15 how many's familiar here with this story you know this Jesus has just come through and he's met the woman here at the well and in St John the 4th chapter and the 15th verse the woman saith unto him sir give me this water that I thirst not neither come hither to draw and Jesus saith unto her go call thy husband and come hither and the woman answered and said I have no husband and Jesus said unto her thou Hast well said I have no husband for thou has had five husbands and he whom thou now Hast is not thy husband in thou sest thou truly and the woman Sith unto him sir I perceive that thou art a prophet now I love this I perceive that thou art a prophet for our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem is a place where men ought to worship and Jesus saith to Heroman believe me the hour cometh when you shall neither in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem worship the father for ye worship but you know not what we know that we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour cometh I love how the Bible will say the hour cometh but then he'll say the hour cometh but now is amen when the true worshippers how many true worshippers do we have here tonight when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship him for God is a spirit and they that worship Him must somebody say must must must worship Him in spirit and in truth and the woman saith unto him now notice here what she says I know how many how many knows him tonight she says I know that the Messiah cometh which is called Christ and when he has come he will tell us all things and Jesus sath unto her I am he I that speak unto thee am he and upon this came his disciples and marveled that talked with the woman he talked with the woman yet no man said what seekest thou or why talkest thou with her and the woman then left her water pot and went her way into the City and saith unto the men come see a man which told me all things I ever did is not this the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto him and one other place 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter just one verse there 1 Corinthians the 12th chapter and I want to read the third verse how many tonight here still believes the Holy Ghost is fallen in this age he still filling lives amen 1 Corinthians 12 and ver3 Paul here writing says wherefore I give unto you to understand that no man speaking now notice how he's speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus a curse so you can't have the Holy Ghost and then curse the word it's not possible but Paul then turns and says and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost can I say it this way no man can say the message is the truth but by the Holy Ghost we ask the Lord this evening to bless the reading of his word as you may have your seats with us this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord to speak to you here for a few moments and if the Lord would help me maybe just to title this tonight a very as I said a very simple thought but just to speak to you on an experience that holds out an experience that holds out and I we just had a youth service there at home on Friday night at our church and I was ministering there and been praying and seeking something from the Lord for that service and God began to deal with my heart on the word experience just how that everyone needs an experience and I think that many times uh we preach to our young people you need an experience we tell our children we tell it over and over at youth camps and different meetings you need an experience and and that is very true every every every young person needs an experience in the Holy Ghost but uh the more I begin to read and begin to study and begin to think on this we've got a lot of young people hearing that they need an experience but we've got a lot of adults that don't even have an experience and I I think it's a sad thing to see so many people falling away I think it's sad to see people throwing in the towel I think it's devastating to see people just giving up and amen just growing weary and they're all simply walking away from the message of the hour and I'll tell you it's not because they don't know the quote it's not because they haven't been in meetings it's not because they've not been in church but it's simply because they've never met the God of this message they've never had amen an experience with Jesus Christ it all gos down to they never had an experience now the prophet says this at cadis Baria what we need today is a good old time St Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost back into the church again there's so much of this wishy-washy amen carrying on in the name of Christianity taken away he said so much denomination so much theology so much education he said people don't walk anyhow as crippled as the church is here it is as crippled as the church is education's not your crutch he said your faith is your crutch amen that's right education will never do it denomination will never do it he said there'll never be an organization ever substitute The Upper Room experience amen there'll never be a school that'll ever take the place of Pentecost it can't be amen not by power not by might but by my spirit sayith the Lord that's what we need today is back to the Bible experience amen Christians are born again that are washed in the blood of the Lamb that are made white and they are regenerated twice born what the world needs today is a Revival oldtime Revival the kind that St Paul had in about .66 now I don't think the prophet of God was wasting his breath to describe amen what the Apostle Paul had I don't think he was wasting his time Amen to say we need to go back to that and I think the reason why amen that he was preaching so hard to get back to that amen is because that was the only thing that it will keep you in the hour in which you're living let me just say this an education amen of this message will not sustain you the education amen of just knowing that God sent a prophet is not going to sustain you amen but an experience amen amen to come into the presence of the Living God Amen and not just meet him because your mama told you about him not just meet him amen because the preacher preaches about him but to really meet him amen and know him for yourself and I think tonight what it's time to do is it's time to take inventory of our own experience the prophet says this if he sends the thing it's up to the people to receive it or to reject it and each one as individual he says not because of your church standing but as an individual it doesn't lay within whether your church accepts it amen it's whether you accept it then to think tonight amen that you could be here tonight and you could be Desiring a Revival you could be Desiring something from God and the entire church not even be involved in the entire church not even want it amen do you realize you could be here tonight needing something from God and everybody in this building be doubting it and don't believe it can happen amen but if you've got the faith that it'll happen amen God will bypass every unbeliever he will bypass every skeptic he will bypass every critic he will go around every devil trying to stop you amen from receiving what God has got for you he'll go around that because this is not a church experience amen this is an individual experience and to say tonight amen we've got to move Beyond well the church is in Revival then I'll be in Revival well well my favorite preacher is in Revival so I'll be in Revival we got a movie on that tonight church and it's got to come that if nobody in this church is in Revival you're in Revival if nobody is praising God Amen you're praising God if nobody is rejoicing amen you are rejoicing amen because this is not amen a group amen this is an individual amen that has accepted what God has s amen salvation is not a group effort salvation is a personal work it is a personal faith the prophet says it is a personal faith amen I love this it's a personal faith in the Lord Jesus no matter if father don't believe if Mother don't believe it's what you believe see and notice when they did receive it then great signs and wonders in Jubilee broke out but when they rejected it then dark gross darkness and grossness came upon the people and the people of this last day can't you see why gross darkness is falling on this country amen the gospel of Christ has been rejected he said you don't want to believe that but it's a noted fact it's the truth it's too bad but it's the truth and I think that if that be the case that each one of us should take inventory of our own experience and our own standings with God and see how we stand in his side amen then we don't come to church amen to see how we stand in the pastor's side amen we don't come to church to see how we stand amen amen in the Deacon S but we come to church for one purpose amen and that is to see how am I standing in the sight of God Amen because his opinion is the only opinion that matters amen his thoughts are the only thoughts that matters amen is in the presence of God Amen now you think of this word experience the Bible says amen that that that there's got to be a baptism of the Holy Ghost and you've got to have an experience amen with more than the Bible amen with more than a book with more than a taper even a picture you've got to have an experience with the Holy Ghost now when you look at this word experience the word experience means practical contact they meant with obser with an observation of facts or event it is an event or An Occurrence that leaves an impression on someone amen an encounter or undergo an event An Occurrence it means to feel an emotion amen now let me say the way a prophet said anything without emotion is dead amen you need to bury it if you cannot feel it amen then it's dead and I'll tell you what the prophet said he said then the greatest power in the world what is the greatest power in the world he says I find this it's the greatest power not the atomic bomb but a believer in contact with his maker or can I say a Believer amen who has had an experience amen with the God that he is claiming to serve it changes the whole attitude it changes his mental it changes his habit it changes his body it changes his nature it changes everything amen then we've all come to a place that we've said how is this going to change amen how are we going to work this out and a prophet comes along and says just get an experience amen amen you say well my child's got a bad attitude I've got the remedy tonight it's not Dr Dobson it's an experience of the Holy Ghost well my son's got a rebellious Spirit on him I've got the answer amen he needs an experience with the Holy Ghost well brother Andrew I don't get nothing out of church I've got your answer tonight you need an experience with the Holy Ghost well brother Andrew I can't stay awake and Church you need an experience with the Holy Ghost brother Andrew I've heard these quotes So they B me to death what you need is an experience with the Holy Ghost until the same fire amen that fill the upper room amen comes into your hearts and fills your fibers and fills your being with reality not religion amen reality I'll just go ahead and preach here for a minute we don't need religion we need reality we need something that'll change us amen Religion Don't Change us religion binds us amen religion doesn't break free amen religion puts more pressure Upon Us amen but there's one thing amen that'll break you free out of whatever you're in and that is the reality of knowing Jesus Christ amen I love the book of Hebrews don't you amen I love to go read there in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 how that there are so many Heroes of Faith amen there's a man there named Abraham there's a name a man named Moses there's a man amen named Samson there's a there's a woman there named Ruth there's a woman named Rahab there's a man named Enoch there's all kinds of names in there amen but do you realize how they all got there amen they got there because they everyone had an experience amen now let me say it was not any kind of experience it was an enduring experience the Bible says in Hebrews 11:27 by faith he forsook Egypt amen not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured somebody shout endured amen he endured I seeing him who is invisible amen then before Abraham amen could have went through anything before Moses could have went through anything they had to meet the invisible God Amen and by seeing the invisible God Amen it released the power to them that no matter what came in the visible Rim they had done tapped in The Invisible rim and they were not drawing from the visible they were drawing from the invisible then that's why Sarah's womb could be dead and her milk veins dried up amen but Abraham stand and say we're going to have a child amen that's why Moses amen could be offered the pedestal Amen to be under the king Pharaoh amen but he could stand there and deny the riches of Egypt and suffer the reproach for Christ because he was looking in the invisible real see what happened amen when they met the invisible God they received an experience and it was not a temporary experience it was an enduring experience and I say tonight that same God Amen that met Moses and met Abraham as come down in this building tonight and for the first time Amen in 2,000 years I can announce to you that the Mighty God the invisible God has been unveiled and you can see him face to face tonight oh brother when you see him then it don't matter if you see cancer you've done seen him when you see him you can see depression but that don't shake you because you've done seen him oh I want to see him amen the look upon his face oh I want to see him amen not just to a book I want to see him in reality when that word endure there is used it means to be steadfast it means how that Abraham the prophet said after he endured amen is seeing him who was invisible how after he met God and had an experience of talking face to face with God he could call those things which were not as though they were for he had an experience he had talked to God face to face and that's what we need is a personal experience with the Living God an experience you say brother it's really hard serving God Amen can I tell you what'll make it easier an experience Amen brother Ander it's hard amen living this message can I tell you what'll make it easier an experience Amen brother Ander I get so bored amen coming to church can I tell you what'll make you enjoy church is an experience Amen brother Andrew everybody else is shouting I get so mad because they're taking up my time and I want to go home no you just need an experience amen because if a man ever gets an experience of alcohol amen nobody has to beg him Amen to drink but he's got a taste of it and he wants more of it and I say tonight you take a man woman boy and girl and get them in the presence of the Living God for five minutes and let them get a taste amen of more than just a bunch of chanity and a bunch of fussing and fighting and AR but let him get a taste amen of the ever of the ever living water and it'll put a hunger in them it'll put a thirst in them it'll put a Crave in them that they can't wait to get more of it anybody want to lift your hands and say Lord I Want Some More amen I want some more water I want some more Mana I want some more power hey I want some more whatever you got God I want all of it what we need is an experience amen an experience makes serving God easier yes sir then it's not a bunch of dos and don'ts amen then it's not a bunch of well I can't do this and I got to do that but it'll be oh I love to do this I love to do this I don't want to do that amen it's an experience amen the prop said this way the need of today is an experience with God that's what the church needs tonight is just stop studying so much Theology and get down to the altar amen there's the first problem is we took the altar out of the church and we put a bunch of psychology in his place we took the altars out of the church and we decorated like Cain amen but a prophet should clean the altar off it wasn't made for for for pumpkins it wasn't made for watermelons it wasn't made for apples it was made for humans Amen to lay their will and let the all consuming fire of the Holy Ghost come down upon that Altar and consume it until their thoughts are gone till their motives are gone till their agendas are gone and God has complete control of that individual by an experience amen pray amen Get Down The Altar and pray until a personal experience burns down in the human heart there is the next key amen pray amen you know what amazes me you announce a prayer meeting and four people shows up but you announce all day meeting and dinner on the ground and you got to put chairs out you know why because we've lost our experience amen we're more consumed amen with getting together and talking and joking amen but come on church I don't know if you know or not but we are standing Amen on the threshold of millennial Kingdom tonight we can see the H lights from where we're standing we are hearing amen end time prophecies amen knocking at the door of the church I thank you there there's ever been a time Amen to rise and trim your lamps amen and shake the sleep off of you and get the dullness out of your eyes and let the Holy Ghost amen put a spark of fire amen back in your soul I say now is the time amen the hour has come and now is when we need to renew our experience with a living God am yes sir pray at the altar until a personal amen experience burns down in the human heart I love this and burns out all the dullness Hallelujah burns out all the dness and gives a new vision where there is no vision the people perish where there is no Direction where there is no leadership where there is no future goal where there is nothing that the people can put their eyes on and say I'll fight till I get it I'll work till I get it amen where there's none of that and the people settle down and they become a bunch of hot bed plants amen but I wonder tonight is there any pedigree horses is there any Jean seeds of God here that says God I know the world is falling apart I know Russia is hollering I know politics is a joke amen but I still know your word says amen that all things are possible Amen to them that believe you know what I say tonight I say won't the same Holy Ghost amen that fell The Upper Room won't it come by this church and move tonight amen you realize our world is tore upside down right now our nation is in the biggest uproar that it's ever been one of the most powerfullest Nations on the face of the Earth has become a comedy it's become a laughing stock amen Democrats fight Republicans and Republicans fight Democrat amen but can I tell you what tonight Church won't for just a few moments amen we let the fight go behind us on't for just a few moments amen while they're fighting at the White House we're not at the White House we're at God's house and you know what I've come to this conclusion while they're fighting amen at the White House I'm going to keep on preaching at God's house and while they're fighting at the White House amen the same Spirits amen that fell upon Enoch amen could fall in this building tonight and in the moment in the twinkling of an eye while they're fighting amen our bodies could be changed come on church I'm not a crazy man tonight I believe tonight we are closer to the coming of the Lord than we were this morning I believe this minute we are closer to the coming of the Lord and we was an hour ago I say lay aside every weight lay aside every sin church and let the Holy Ghost consume you again until this message amen becomes a reason why you're living give us a vision God the Bible said the people's heart is wax gross do you realize the end time conditions of people's life is Bible prophecies the Bible says Jesus himself this people's heart is wax gross their ears are dull of hearing their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and they should hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them amen the prophet speaking of David said if we notice while this giant was making his great boast and this great Theologian as it would be stand there well trained to know how to fight but he had never had an experience with God and Such a Pity today to see men women who lived in church been brought up in this cradle roll and knows the Bible Well they know the Bible well but yet has never witnessed an experience with God what we need is to get back to the real heartfelt experience to know somebody shout to know oh say it like you believe it to know Amen to know who you've got faith in not sub writings amen but the true and living God who lives now well brother I got my faith in the Bible but I ain't got my faith in this Jesus you're preaching then you that's impossible amen because this Bible is the word and this word is God and God is his word if you've got faith in the Bible then you've got faith in Jesus and if you got faith in Jesus and you got faith in this Bible oh come on church and what we need to do tonight is remember who we've got faith in can I preach to you for a minute remember who our faith is then who is your faith in tonight if your faith is in Donald Trump it's not looking very good if your faith is in Sleepy Joe ain't looking very good if your faith is in Crazy Nancy ain't looking very good amen but let me tell you tonight who I've got my faith in I've got my faith in the King of Kings and the Lord of lords I've got my faith in the God Amen that has never been defeated his word has never been stopped and the same God Amen that stood for his children in the Bible days has returned in this generation and he's standing amen he's standing for his people tonight that's who I got my faith in you can put your faith in whoever you want to amen but make sure amen their record is as clean as my God's is make sure their record is is tried as my God's record has been tried make sure amen that they were killed and laid in a grave for three days but early one Sunday morning they got up out of the make sure your faith is in the way way amen the truth and the life make sure your faith is in the resurrected Jesus Christ or your faith is on shifting s ah somebody shout the Living God where I anchor my faith amen then how am I going to do that amen by an experience amen by knowing him so real that nobody can talk you out of him by knowing him in such a way that if your best friend left the message you can still say I believe knowing him in such a way if your favorite preacher quit preaching this message you can stand up and say I still believe amen knowing him in such a way that if tomorrow amen they burned every book and they destroyed every tape and they ridiculed every picture there would still be a bride that would say I believe that message because I meant more than a book I meant more than a tape I meant to God Amen that wrote the Bible that raised up for you bandam I met him for myself Hallelujah and then you said you're talking pretty hard about this experience I am because our world has recently taken time Amen to deem what is essential and it's what non-essential amen is it funny a lot of people had really good thoughts about themselves they thought their job couldn't operate without them and about two hours they found out they weren't even essential right right ain't that funny amen everything they had revolved around that job my job my job in just a few moments they was told stay home you ain't even need it you're fine amen see amen so for world Amen is taking time Amen to drive home in the hearts of the people what is important and what is unimportant then can I take what a prophet said he said and remember this it is absolutely now to you people it is absolutely essential and necessary and compelling and compulsory that you receive the Holy Ghost now for if you don't you cannot come in the resurrection brother brother Sam how many more amen descriptions has he got to give it is absolutely essential it is necessary it is compelling it is compulsory amen four words with such fervor behind them that you receive the Holy Ghost if you don't receive the Holy Ghost you can know your Bible well you can be rocked in the Cradle of the message of the but if you don't know the Holy Ghost you will not come up in the resurrection if you go by the way of the grave and you will not be one that's alive and remain when the sweet comes over the Earth to change our bodies oh somebody say tonight God let me know you let me know you beyond just a book let me know you beyond just to take let me know you beyond just a feeling let me know you in the realities of the Holy Ghost oh an experience amen with God is essential brother R ask a question do you believe do your children have to have an experience to have the Holy Spirit if they see the end time message do they have the do they have the Holy Spirit notice the question they see it now do they have the Holy Spirit everyone must yes amen right everyone must have an experience your children cannot go in no other way but the same way you do see they got to be born again there's no grandchildren in the kingdom of God they're all children amen they must have it somebody shout must they must have an experience they must have it they must have an experience with God to go in just the same as you God does not have grandchildren he only has sons and daughters and a prophet said until you're born of the spirit of God you're a grandchild amen but when you meet God Amen through the spirit of God Amen through the channel through the provided way amen then you're no longer a grandchild but you're a child who has got a claim upon your father see God has called us now how many believes God has called us amen God has called us Amen to be more than preachers Amen to be more than song leaders Amen to be more than musicians or deacons or or whatever position you hold God has called us to be his Witnesses in the age we are living in see the prophet said God has never been without a witness he always had at least one man he could put his hand on and say that's my witness it may have come down to one at one time but he still had a witness amen see then what is the requirement to be a witness the requirement to be a witness is an experience oh praise God I'm a witness brother Andrew I've had an experience I believe the message amen does your child believe the message do they still have to have the Holy Spirit they must have the Holy Ghost oh I know this is simple but can I preach you tonight what does acts chap 1 verse 8 say but she shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost amen has come upon you and you shall be my Witnesses notice you shall not be my Witnesses and then receive power and then go forth but you receive the power then you become the witnesses unto me and Jerusalem Judea and Samaria unto the uttermost parts of the Earth Somebody shout Witnesses amen what is a witness a witness is a martyr it is a record it is a witness in a legal sense amen it is those who after his example have proved the strength and genuiness of their faith in Christ by Under going a violent death amen then let me take a moment here and separate your mind amen as being a martyr as somebody that's burned on a steak or somebody hung upside down amen but a prophet said amen a birth is a death he said the new birth is a death then what is the New Birth the new birth is the old man dying and the new man coming on by the quickening power of the Holy Ghost listen tonight church amen if you have been born again may I salute you tonight as a for the Gospel of Jesus Christ if you have died to your Ambitions if you have died to your fleshly Wills if you have died to agendas and traditions and been born again by the August presence of the Holy Ghost you are a modern day witness right here in this living day you're living in amen a witness has to know something somebody shout know something know something a witness has to know something amen just anybody can't come in and be a witness amen amen to be a witness for the Lord you've got to know something let say that again know something Amen to be a witness you got to know something Amen to be a amen To Be A God Called witness you got to know something amen I'm going to try to behave myself right here but I can't make any promises my Bible says in Daniel 11:32 and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries but the people that do know that do know something amen that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits amen notice here there's going to be a people weak there's going to be a people corruptible there's going to be a people that by flattery amen can be swept away from the faith but at the same time for the bride that there is a group falling there is a group standing and they're not standing there is a weak defeated amen group of people but they're standing there as a people that is strong hey what made us strong can I preach to you tonight amen we know our God we don't just hear about him we don't just think about him amen but we know him tonight you know what that word know there means it means to know and to perceive and to see and to find out and discern it means to discriminate and distinguish this is the one I love it means to know by experience yes amen it means to know by experience Amen to admit Amen to acknowledge to confess to considered to be acquainted with the prophet said Daniel said the people that know their God in this day would do exploits there is nothing uncertain about that God said so and we got it amen there's nothing uncertain about that now let me ask you something where is the scripture or or or where is the promise that a people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits where is it's in the Bible right it was laid there by a prophet who was under the inspiration of living of the Living God now notice is here now it's promised that in the last days God will pour out his spirit it's promised by Daniel that the people in the days when the stone hits the image in the foot and the people that know their God shall do exploits amen prophecy after prophecy Amen in all the seminaries amen the world cannot take it out God's going to do it anyhow and people's going to follow it see the natural church amen and the supernatural church for the word makes the difference amen then do you realize that this Bible right here has been through Seminary halls for years and they've argued with it and they've debated it and they've watered it down and they've compromised it and they made it nothing more than a Jewish Fable of some historical day amen but at the same time oh God I feel like taking the breaks off and preaching at the same time that they were watering the word down there was a prophecy in the last days I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh amen and there's going to be Jean seed there on the earth and it's going to receive amen the outpour of the spirit of God and when that Spirit connects with that seed then they're going to find that word come on church can I preach to you tonight amen let's agree this Bible right here speaks of Abraham this Bible speaks of Moses help me now this Bible speaks of Paul this Bible speaks of Peter this Bible speaks of James it speaks of Jesus it speaks of William Bram amen but this same Bible that speaks of all of those it speaks of Andrew Glover speaks of Brian Han it speaks of Samuel browny it speaks of you brother amen sister the same Bible amen that spoke of Sarah it's the same Bible that speaks of you tonight and there was a scripture that was laying there that was concerning [Applause] you then do you see the devil's greatest fear is when the spirit Begin to Fall it was going to Quicken the seed on the inside of your soul and you was going to find amen the written word about you and you were not just going to read it and say isn't that a lovely little reading but the same power amen that fell upon Daniel to write it was going to fall upon you and you was going to meet your God and when you met your God my experience that experience would render the devil powerless hallelujah hallelujah oh you say brother Ander I don't feel like shout

a people amen who has met their God and they're not they they don't just know their God but they're actually doing exploits right amen true ah God's word is a true witness ain't it then we are a witness that God's word is fulfilled I'll challenge any man to show me any organization on fire for God filled with the Holy Ghost with signs follow them rise and tell me one any organization there is no such a thing it's not only the pages that's right they are powerless and they are dead right amen can I preach it tonight they are powerless and they are dead get it we get it brother bradam but he also prophesied that there' be a real Church in the last days a little flock a Remnant he said there would be and there will be can I preach tonight he said there would be a people in the last days that know their God and they would be strong and they would do great exploits and a Prophet come along and said and there will be if you're doubting that there will be but can I take it a step further tonight and say there will be amen there will be but there is tonight oh wake up Church there is tonight you say there is tonight yes sir right here in this building tonight can I get a witness of somebody that says I know oh my God I know my God I know him be on the book I know him be on the table how do you know him because I stood on the sacred Sands the same Sands that job stood on the same Sands that Moses stood on I have stood on those Sands and the power of God has come into my heart and I know him well brother and there someday there's going to be a young person that can overcome pornography I say hogwash today is the day [Applause] well someday there's going to be a young girl be able to overcome Hollywood fashion I say hogwash there is a young girl today well someday brother

anybody leaves this building it's going to be me I know it I know it I know it how do I know it because I've experienced amen I've already experienced amen the same power that's going to lift me off the Earth is the same power amen that save me from the center Wash Me In The Blood change my nature change my habits change everything about me I'm not the same man I KN I didn't read this out of the history book I met [Applause] him I I'm not just preaching about an experience because I read a quote no no no no you're looking at a 24 year old boy that metad him right you must have met him when you started preaching no I'm preaching because I met him before I started preaching and when we met he gave me something to preach come on Church anden brother said a man go to school and learn how to preach he said let his fire burn out right he said when the Lord lights a fire go tell how it got lit that's right can I tell you how mind got lit amen as a young 9-year-old boy I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus Christ I was baptized in water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but there was something more I wanted than just to stand before the church and be baptized in water I wanted the Holy Ghost amen can I preach I know this is simple amen but I wanted the Holy Ghost I wanted it so bad I prayed for it I asked God for it I said God I want the Holy Ghost amen we were getting ready to leave for Youth Camp as about a 12-y old boy I was loading up on the bus we got on that bus I never will forget it amen one Brother come on there and he said as you leave this church parking lot he said you put something before God that you want out of these meetings and he said don't you let nothing stop you until you get it you know what I wanted I wanted the Holy Ghost amen because I'd heard what other people said the Holy Ghost could do for you amen I could tell what it did for them amen but I wanted to be able to stand up and say if it did it for you amen it did it for me two I wanted the Holy Ghost went down to Youth Camp amen Thursday night rolled amen Friday night morning Friday morning Friday night Saturday morning amen Saturday night they had the prayer line brother I'd never been in the prayer i' never been in a fast prayer line just always went up for prayer so I had in my mind when you go up you stop the preacher and you tell him what you want you say and brother Tim prudy was at the head of that prayer line that night so in my mind I got lyed to go in the prayer line and I was going to stop there and I was going to say brother Tim I want the Holy Ghost I've been baptized I want to receive the Holy Ghost amen but before I can even open my mouth I never will forget it amen I sit in my office at the day stud this and it just came back to me as clear as I was sitting there looking at the wall amen I never forget it before I could even say I want the Holy Ghost brother Tim took his hand amen and he reached up he says we're the long and short of it but but he reached up there and he laid his hand on me and I never forget these words he said God give him the Holy Ghost I didn't tell him what I wanted I didn't tell him I wanted it so bad that I was wanting the Holy Ghost more than I wanted the next meal I was wanting the Holy Ghost more than anything but but God knew what I wanted amen and God had a witness there amen that knew the god that met me met him and if he give him the Holy Ghost he could give me the Holy Ghost and brother Brian when he laid his hands on me he said God give him the Holy Ghost brother I don't remember nothing for about 2 and 1/2 hours amen about 2 and 1/ half hours later I woke up over in the prayer room when I looked down there was snot there was a puddle of tears I was a wreck amen I was ringing wet amen but you know what I got up and when I got up Sister Browning I had something more than I had when I went down and I say tonight amen when I met God there little did I know I would stand before Giants and they would say the the Holy Ghost don't move no more and we need Psychology I little did I know I would stand amen before preachers and they would say you can't preach the seventh seal you can't preach the third pole the third pull is not the power of the Holy Ghost back in the church amen but I met God Amen and what they said didn't matter amen because I knew amen the god I met have called me to preach it and I say tonight church that same God is in this building tonight you know what I didn't get an experience sister Browning that I had to hold amen I got an experience that's been holding me H can we let our hair down and preach for a minute I got an experience that's held me it held me through hurts it held me through disappointments it held me through family troubles it help me amen through kids making fun of you in public school the god I met made me a promise I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you the battle is not yours it belongs to the Lord hallelujah I got more than just an experience I got a word experience amen and you know what it made me a witness amen made me a witness you said brother what are you talking about I'm talking about a witness not not not just a church witness an eye witness right a ear witness and then the Bible says I have heard of thee by the hearing of the a but now mine eyes seeth thee amen hallelujah Witnesses therefore no man can exactly witness to the resurrection of Christ only by the Holy Ghost see here's what's hurting this more than ever is people who are professing to be Christians and not living like it the thing is see they're not a correct witness they cannot witness until they have an experience amen when Jesus said out his disciples he said you got to have the correct experience because in their Journey amen am I holding too long in their Journey they were going to meet things they were going to they were going to have days when if they didn't have an experience they would Blow Away With The Wind that was blowing against them they were going to have times amen when they would come up against something and they were not going to know how to get over it they were not going to know how to get around it or get under it amen but the god they met amen was going to come down again and renew their memory refresh their memory of the experience that he gave them years ago and they would stand there and say God if when everything was against me you could take me a sinner and you could turn my life around you could set my feet on straight streets you could put me on Hallelujah Avenue if you could do that then what is this mountain to you see why are you still sitting here tonight with a testimony is because you had an experience anybody ever faced the mountain anybody ever faced a wall how am I going to get over it amen but you had an experience see you was a Christian but the power was not you were just claiming to be a Christian the power was you had the Holy Ghost see the Bible says wherefore I give you an understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God Called Jesus a cursed yeah and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost no man can say Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost and brother every time a man that professes to be a Christian sometime or other you've got to show what you're made out of see it's not enough just to stand up and say I'm a Christian but there's going to come a time you're going to have to stand there and so it's not a bunch of talk I actually have what I'm saying I am Hallelujah the prophet gives us this illustration he said Tommy Osburn saw that Maniac there in those meetings said he saw him come up there and challenge the Holy Ghost said he fell across my feet brother said Tommy come to me said brother Brandon what can I do I said now Tommy don't profess anything that you can't back up the devil's going to call your hand on it yes he will and he will do it right away I said then if you can't back it up you know what come it'll be a reproach so just be sure that you make your statement another place he says oh my be sure that down in your heart that God has separated you from the things of the world this is an experience and made you a new creature then go tell people you're a Christian he said you think I think today we bury too many people alive he said you bury them after they're dead is that right yes sir listen brother a man that's dead won't argue with you that's right amen I got to keep on hurrying am amen a man that's dead won't argue with you you can say anything to him you can want to you can call him all kinds of names he won't say a word why he's dead am then we find that there are people today with two different kinds of experiences amen the Bible amen the prophet shows us that there is a natural experience right amen but then there is a spiritual experience which is a supernatural experience now a natural experience is not enough it will not hold out it will not hold you see we have too many people amen that just have got a natural experience you say beler what is a natural experience a natural experience is a church experience right right now the Bible says in Luke 5:37 no man put the new wine into Old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles Shall Perish brother said see I see now what Jesus meant the way you take the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it in an old dry formal cide it'll blow up as sure as the world it'll just it'll just blow up you you just can't have it like that you try to take the baptism of the Holy Ghost with an old experience of some long drawn out Church experience it'll blow up as sure as the world he said but you take new wine amen and new bottles he said the new bottles has still the or the the new bottles still has the all in the Skins but it's flexible that's the way God's Church must be for Revival it must be flexible right amen amen if I could tonight can I give you an example of a church experience can I give you one the Rich Young Ruler the problem of God said this now the young man knew there was something that he was lacking though we said he's thoroughly understand amen though we amen he must have had a good father he had a good father he had a good mother and a church experience brother brother Brown he had three things amen that were good things but that waser enough right he belonged to the church because Jesus asked him keep the Commandments on the father mother do God kills commit adultery all these morals the church teaches amen but yet one thing thou lackest yet being a member of a religious body he he was a member of a Rel he was fulfilling the scripture forsake not the assembling of your he was doing that he was a part of a religious body but yet the young man was sensible enough to know he lacked eternal life he lacked amen knowing Christ in a personal experience amen can I can I can I take a few minutes here and we'll close amen a personal experience must be a supernatural experience can you say Amen it must be somebody say must it's essential it must be a supernatural experience it must be more than shaking a preacher's hand it must be more than a trip to Youth Camp it must be more than your favorite preacher coming through and getting you all excited it must be more than just saying mom is a Sunday school teacher and daddy is a deacon and Samuel Browning is my pastor and I'm best friends with a oh no church it's got to be something amen that is so real to you I don't think we need this kind of preacher well let me just tell you what I think I think we need more of it I think we need more people amen coming to know God in the power of his resurrection well brother Andrew I don't know if anything's going to hold me I'll just share this with you today I was traveling up the road today and brother Homer Longoria called amen anybody knows Homer he's a nut I told Brother Homer one time I said I think sometimes I come down here to preach but actually I leave here blessed more than the church does he said what do you mean I said cuz I come here with a heavy spirit amen but I'm around you about two minutes and it's all gone but he he called me there and he began talking he was say he was say brother that what what do you think about this we we just begin talking about things you know amen he's talking about he said but then what about people now amen leaving the message and going after some gift he said brother Andrew what do you think about that and I said brother Homer I think it's because theyve never had an experience amen because if you ever meet The Giver amen then there ain't a gift real enough to take you away from what the giver was sent to vindicate I said it I meant it I stand behind it and I represent it amen if you ever meet The Giver amen a gift will not take you away from personal experience with a giver he said brother I've seen so much I said brother Homer it it it it burdens my heart to see all the things going on he said brother Andrew what about me he said I've been in there 50 years he said but you know what I still believe this message I thought is't that a testimony here's a man he said it used to be he said one had a he said in Paul's day he said one had a song one had a gift one had a tongue one had a prophecy he said Andrew I done come through that he said now one's got a tent one's got a thunder one's got a t Ministry one's got to this one I said brother Homer what kept you he said because I knew when I heard that message he said I knew when I heard that message I heard a certain sound and I tell you what kept him is because he meant more than just in a sensation he met more than just an emotion amen but he met the god that William Brandon was sent to introduce the church too and I say tonight friends amen young people listen to me I pray this thing is over today I pray we take a Rapture but I am so convinced if God carries his coming 50 more years there is going to be a group of people that still going to be preaching this message how can you say that because there's a people here that knows him the Bible said that I Paul says I may know somebody say no no I may know him in the power of his resurrection there is a people here today that knows him and the fellowship of his sufferings and they have been made conformable unto his death amen have we have we been using that word a little bit no oh no to know to know something look at what this word no means it means to perceive it means to understand now now there was two groups of people there was the Greeks and then there was the Jews now notice here to the Greeks this meant to know facts amen but the facts may or may not affect one's conduct so in other words they could know the message but they still had a television in their house testing one two testing one two it's still working what can we preach amen well well they know the message but they ain't overcome amen they know the quotes but they still they still can't agree with the prophets teaching on predestination oh but they know the message amen won't you just tell the truth you don't know it right amen amen true because to the Jews true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct see one did not know something until the fact had a practical outworking in his life amen can I tell you why somebody asked me one time they said brother Ander why do you preach amen so strong about the third pull I said because as a 15year old boy I heard a prophet say in the sures inst time he said is this that seventh seal is this that seventh Angels message he said is this that third pull he said that will draw and bring the power of God back in the church he said you draw your own conclusion then I heard him say that and you know what it told me if I said it wasn't then it were going to be a powerless day but if I said it was the power it was going to bring a power back in my life and today because I'm sitting under an open book I've Got The Power of the Holy Ghost living on the inside of me come on church I think it's time we come to a place that if nobody heard you open your mouth they knew you believe this message if nobody knew you went to this crazy Church on the side of the road that follows a dead man if nobody knew that they knew something was different about you why because what's being preached is coming into your soul and it's having a practical outworking in your life amen I got to close here I'll preach all night but my Prophet said Moses you know was called a man of God a prophet while he was being called being a prophet he had to have a supernatural exp spirit amen so no man has a right to call himself thus until he's talked face to face with God right on the back side of the desert amen hallelujah bless him Lord somewhere where he met God himself yes direct quote and all the atheist in the world could not explain it away from him he was there right he know it happened every Christian should have an experience before they say anything about being a Christian your own experience brother Briant Moses had such an experience that had when he got down off that mountain every atheist in the world at that time could have been lined up there the chief of them all oh God I just caught that fresh the chief of them all and they would still not talk Moses out of what just happened up there on that mountain brother they could stand there and say Moses you're crazy he'd say well I'm crazy believer they'd say Moses there's no way that a bush could be on fire and not be consumed he said you can't say that because you weren't there but I was there I saw it amen GL I was there I saw it they could say Moses there's no way you could take a a stick and throw it down and it become a serpent and pick it up and it become a rod again he said well you can say it didn't happen but I saw it right amen are you hearing me am then today is there another group of people in the land who has been up on the mountain with Jesus they've been up to the burning bush and they met God for themselves and when somebody says William bam wasn't a prophet you can say you can say that but I was there I saw [Applause] it oh they can say that the Seven Seals have not been open but you can stand there and say let me tell you something the reason I know the Seven Seals are open is because the word is working mightily in the vessel that heard the opening of those Seven Seals brother Andrew how can you stand and say sunset Mountain was Revelation 101 fulfilled because I heard a prophet say it and because I am a believer not by head knowledge not by education but by an [Music] [Applause] experience and I close with this your own experience somebody just say that with me your own your own experience experience now just say own own own little word ain't it just a little bitty word right but you know what that word own means it's used with the possessive right to emphasize that someone or something belongs or relates to the person or thing mention right oh God to have something as one's own to possess it then what did Brother I'm say you've got to own your own experience you've got to have your own experience and your experience has to own you you've got to possess an experience and your experience oh God are you hearing me Church your experience has got to possess you amen the Bible says in Song of Solomon 63 I am my beloveds and my beloveds is mine he Feth among the lies but we don't come here this morning just to sit and talk about a historical Affair which is all true but we come here this morning with a testimony I I know Hallelujah I know that Jesus Christ is the Son of God I know it Beyond any shout of it doubt I know that he raised from the dead and he lives within me today brother you know what I love about that this next part he is mine amen and I am [Music] his he is mine he owns me and I am his I own him I possess him oh church if he is yours then you know what you'll call him you'll call him Lord oh you know Jesus said in one case he asked a question I like to say tonight this Jesus said why why do you call me Lord what is it what does it it's because the denominational tradition stands between them and the word and anything stands between you and God is an idol it takes the place of God why I call you lord lord means ownership yesen Lord means ownership amen our Lord owns the property and if God owns me if I am his and he turned me around one day when I was on the wrong road and called me for a purpose what am I to do but to fulfill his desire like he did Peter amen can I can I leave you this one with this one gold nugget when when the Lord showed this to me about turn my office upside down it ain't hard to do it's on bricks amen Jeremiah 1 five says before I form thee in thy belly oh yeah what word does he use I knew thee before I formed thee in thy belly I knew Thee I am my beloved and he is mine the Lord is mine I am his before I form thee in thy belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctify thee and I ordain thee a prophet of the Nations oh brother what's he saying he knew you before you were born therefore he knew you would know him that'll hit you about 12:00 tomorrow and you'll scare everybody to work at death to at work to death you know what before you was born amen I'm done right here but before you was born when you were still in your mother's womb amen Jehovah said I knew you brother Brian before you broke the womb and breathed one breath he knew you and by knowing you he placed a seat in you you know what that seat did that seat owned you it claims you for this age that when Jesus Christ would be reintroduced to the church again there would be a people in the earth that would know their God and would be strong and do great exploits can I get a witness here tonight anybody a witness that says I know him I know him as a savior I know him as a Healer h hallah I know him he owns me one more quote one more quot was I got one minute left now children has come up under that kind Sea Under that kind of teaching that's what their parent was they

that being a teenager but I never forget dad he sat me down and he said son he said you believe this message I said yeah Dad I believe it's the truth and he looks look Point Blank at me he said no you don't he said because if you did you'd live it but you know no matter how much that I I went through all of that there's no doubt you know sitting in this room here or standing in the room tonight or maybe listening by way of internet or will hear this service it be had to become something more than my efforts it had to become God on the inside and you meet him that's that's the whole that's that's the theme what brother Andrew preached tonight I think is brother brandham you know if we ever get away from this you got away from the colonel brother BR calls it the colonel that's every service whether John 3 is read or not whether the phrase is mentioned you must be born again that's what every message is about I I I I know for the truth you could preach marriage and divorce and people are born again because it's the word of God it's Discerning Christ in our midst that word it it strikes our hearts a living experience of a living God and it it lifts it's such a such a precious reality I think of how brother brandham when they they told Brother brandham as he stood there in sh port in night 1965 he talked about the message the lamb and the dove that brother Bram had preached he said brother Bram I guess with your schedule and the way things are you don't get to preach messages like that no more and brother BR says if I ever get away from that message of the lamb and the dove he said then I've gotten away from my message because that's what it's come to do the dove of the Holy Spirit has come to lead the Lambs of God it's come to lead us and bring us life this is what real life really is this is what real Joy is I used to wonder why you know my my parents wow my goodness you know they're missing out on fun or how how do they see this as fun but once you come behind the veil with an experience then this this is what fun is this is what real Joy is it's not just Joy when I'm here it's Joy when I'm sitting out there in the blind in the woods it's Joy when I when I'm walking and down the road it's joy in my prayer closet it's joy to serve the Lord it's an anchor that holds us I tell you I I feel like that what God has brought to us is just it's absolutely fitting it's necessary it's needful my prayer is is May there not be one that would go away from here tonight by way of the internet or those that will I pray if somebody hasn't listened to it or streaming I pray God will wake them up I pray God will stir them take peace from them cause them to get up and say I need to listen to that Thursday night message I can't can't sleep anyhow and I pray that whoever doesn't those that don't have an experience that they'll receive an experience to know it's for you it don't matter what age you are the experience itself is the passing from Death unto life brother B says he whispers he speaks into your heart when he says brother BR said when he says your mind he said you'll know if he spoke to you watch how your life is after that you see he lays claim on our life ownership oh my what a what a what a blessed reality this is amen aren't you thankful to the Lord aren't you glad you were here tonight amen I'm glad I was here and you know the you know the wonderful thing is is that it's a privilege that we have an access to say Lord I want another fing I want another fing amen that we can be filled and and we should this should be the desire the unction of our life God give me a fresh refilling of the Holy Ghost you feel feel yourself getting a little LAX a little stale you find things somewhat sarting to stick and things sticking in your mind or sticking in your spirit say God give me a refilling of the Holy Ghost because it'll it flushes out all those things it's a love of God it just flushes it right out amen you love him tonight amen let's just we'll just be dismissed in the name of the Lord we're going to let you be dismissed amen it's just been good to be in the house of the Lord it's good to be amen under the word of God and changing our life amen amen This Promise as Peter said by the unction of the Holy Ghost is to it's to you and to his many as the Lord Our God shall call amen God when he sinks that into a heart that life it knows this is M personal it belongs to me oh my God bless you tonight amen may the Lord watch over as you go your separate ways amen God bless you tonight sing that yeah sing that
