[39:28] [Music]
[39:29] amen amen amen
[39:32] amen
[39:35] amen
[39:37] amen you think about that
[39:40] scripture
[39:42] uh where David said at the very end of
[39:45] Psalms 23 he says
[39:48] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[39:53] after me all the days of my life
[39:55] amenallah and I never forget years and
[39:58] years ago I heard uh my brother Tim puit
[40:02] quote that scripture and this was back
[40:04] in
[40:05] 97 but he went in and defined that word
[40:08] as it's in the Hebrew lexicon which
[40:10] means follow after means chase
[40:14] after I wasn't chasing after God's
[40:17] goodness and now I'm still it's God's
[40:21] goodness his Mercy that's chasing after
[40:24] me
[40:26] [Music]
[40:28] thank you Lord that's powerful it's
[40:30] powerful that's never never left me
[40:33] every time I read that scripture you
[40:34] know I can I can almost hear Brother
[40:36] Tim's voice when I read it but it's just
[40:38] that that I love how that's so defined
[40:41] you know because it means a little
[40:42] different than to follow after that
[40:44] means I'm being
[40:45] pursued amen we're being pursued by the
[40:48] mercy and the goodness of God Amen I'm
[40:50] so glad about that aren't you amen so
[40:53] good to amen be in Fellowship here
[40:55] tonight
[40:57] good to be gathered together we just
[40:59] want to turn our attention to the amen
[41:02] to the word of the Lord tonight I also
[41:04] want as we invite go into the scriptures
[41:07] I want to ask you as we get ready to
[41:10] have a word of prayer uh to also
[41:12] remember brother Homer Loria if you
[41:15] would when he got back um last week he

[41:21] got back and so um so we just um we've

[42:01] here we just want to remember them in

[43:30] that Lord as you have given us your name
[43:32] that's your own life Lord oh God like

[44:41] to minister to each of our needs Lord as
[44:44] we just put them all Lord and lay them
[44:47] all before you tonight we ask that you
[44:49] would come in a special way once again
[44:52] Lord God give us Grace that we can step
[44:54] out of the way that you can step in
[44:57] minister to our hearts and say what
[44:59] needs to be said tonight Lord we commit
[45:02] this service and your lord and all that
[45:04] will be said and done into your hands
[45:06] now in the name of Jesus Christ
[45:09] amen
[45:11] amen amen let's go in the scriptures to
[45:15] back to Job chapter 26
[45:19] and want to
[45:22] just say it was just such
[45:24] a wonderful time on Sunday that time of
[45:28] Fellowship my I I was so thankful for
[45:33] all that the Lord did for us in the
[45:34] service but I that that time of
[45:37] Fellowship there I well I left out of
[45:40] there and I didn't even need my Sunday
[45:42] nap I was so encouraged I I really mean
[45:45] that I was so encouraged I I know
[45:47] brother Aon we talked about being tired
[45:49] and I talked about going home and but I
[45:51] tell you it was so just so just so
[45:53] blessed me amen just to see amen the
[45:56] people of God and being able to come
[45:58] together and I know sometimes we have
[46:00] extraneous circumstances and so forth
[46:02] but it's just such a blessing amen
[46:04] wasn't it just such a blessing so amen
[46:08] um let's go let's look here in a few
[46:10] verses of scripture and then we'll um
[46:13] let you be seated I want to go back here
[46:16] into verse one and job answered and said
[46:20] how hast thou helped him that is without
[46:26] power
[46:27] how savest thou the arm that hath no
[46:31] strength and how hast thou counseled him
[46:34] that hath no wisdom and how hast thou
[46:37] plentifully declared the thing as it is
[46:41] to whom hast thou uttered words and
[46:43] whose Spirit came from thee amen may God
[46:47] bless you and bless the reading of the
[46:49] word as you're being seated you go ahead
[46:51] and kick it over for me Brianna if you
[46:52] don't
[46:53] mind I want to just speak here tonight
[46:56] on a a thought that's continuing with
[46:59] where we were at in job
[47:01] 26 and that is I'd like to if the Lord
[47:04] would help us and that is living beyond
[47:06] our
[47:08] duty and we think of Duty we think of
[47:11] responsibility we think of purpose and
[47:14] if the Lord will just just help us
[47:16] tonight uh to as we look upon these
[47:19] things and to recognize that within it
[47:23] you know job is speaking to uh the
[47:27] Brethren who are there and as we have
[47:29] mentioned before I I don't believe that
[47:32] these Brethren came in a way that they
[47:35] would um I believe they intended to be
[47:38] helpful I don't believe they intended to
[47:41] come there and weary him and everything
[47:43] else I believe they had a lot of good
[47:46] intentions but you know this is where
[47:48] that even with all of the intentions and
[47:51] the motives sometimes there there's a
[47:53] takes a time of actually testing um and
[47:57] really seeing God with what I have on my
[48:00] heart how how should that come forth
[48:03] remember David had had real good
[48:06] intentions on bringing the ark back to
[48:08] Jerusalem had very good intentions when
[48:10] he put the Ark on the on the new cart
[48:15] but but God uh God will bless when it's
[48:18] it's got to be just more than good
[48:20] intentions we want to operate according
[48:22] to God's Will and so we remember that
[48:25] even when David just when he went and he
[48:28] sought counsel and sometimes those are
[48:30] things that in our life and I know
[48:32] sometimes we don't always have the uh o
[48:35] opportunity to go and maybe to exactly
[48:38] at a moment go and there's some things
[48:39] that doesn't Merit us getting away and
[48:42] praying you know there's when you see a
[48:43] need you just act upon it if it would be
[48:45] out here tonight or wherever it would be
[48:48] but there's other times where we can
[48:49] have uh something that comes upon our
[48:52] heart maybe someone or uh and and some
[48:55] need and we begin to pray even within at
[48:58] times in the family we we know it
[49:01] sometimes we we don't just jump on
[49:03] things and express things right away
[49:05] sometimes we have to wait for the right
[49:07] time the right words and and that's
[49:09] where even within that God's also
[49:11] teaching us patience you see through the
[49:14] things that we encounter in life and the
[49:16] little things that we go through it God
[49:19] is working out and molding our character
[49:21] our character is molded in so many
[49:24] different facets as we will uh wait on
[49:27] the Lord and Look to Him in many things
[49:30] and I think uh all of us have no doubt
[49:32] been there at one time or another where
[49:34] we have acted ahead of God or acted
[49:37] ahead and we've got really enthused
[49:39] about something and and realized that
[49:41] where we were enthused if we just take
[49:43] it before God and wait on the Holy
[49:45] Spirit God will not only uh give and
[49:49] condition us for the moment but he'll
[49:50] open the door and those are things that
[49:53] we can always count on with God and is
[49:55] as he will do that and I I'm just those
[49:57] are things that I know that I'm speaking
[49:59] also to some veterans and things tonight
[50:01] but those are just things sharing from
[50:03] my heart as God would lay it even upon
[50:05] my heart that you know we've learned to
[50:07] wait upon God and I think that's the
[50:09] greatest one thing that we can do is
[50:11] wait on him and so within this I I want
[50:15] to look at this thought of living beyond
[50:19] our our duty and perhaps these are
[50:22] things that will uh go beyond or maybe
[50:25] to uh God will help was to develop this
[50:27] point within here but you know within
[50:30] these these Brethren as they came to job
[50:33] you know they they knew the expression
[50:36] that was through job's life as we've
[50:38] read through many times rehearsing
[50:40] different scriptures they saw how he
[50:42] strengthened the feeble they saw how his
[50:45] words were encouraging to others and it
[50:47] and it should have been at that time
[50:49] that they would have been able to take
[50:52] at a lesson and an example to just sit
[50:55] there at that moment even when they came
[50:57] and it must have been overwhelming
[50:59] because the Bible said they sat there
[51:00] for seven days and didn't utter a word I
[51:04] can't imagine how job must have looked
[51:06] to them it it no doubt was so startling
[51:08] to them that they might have walked up
[51:10] and maybe it was just like they were
[51:11] going to walk right past him but they
[51:12] knew they were on his property but but
[51:15] somehow or another when looking at him
[51:17] after seven days then that's where they
[51:19] begin to some way in their own way tried
[51:23] to minister help but yet it wasn't
[51:25] ministering help now I believe believe
[51:26] that God will always and he will come in
[51:29] ways to minister help to us to bring us
[51:31] back on the right pathway if we've
[51:33] gotten off on the wrong path his grace
[51:37] will always do that God never leaves us
[51:39] at a dead end but God will always bring
[51:42] us to Calvary I remember one of the
[51:43] first times is through the first moments
[51:46] of in just myself just ministering and
[51:48] and preaching I remember one of the
[51:49] things that my dad sat down and he told
[51:51] me he said son he said you never leave
[51:53] the people without a way back he said
[51:56] you can preach things and he said the
[51:58] strength he said and how correction can
[52:00] come he said but you never leave the
[52:02] people without a way back he said
[52:04] because Calvary has always made a way
[52:07] for restitution so those are just things
[52:09] that even I can remember when we were on
[52:11] route to just being a boy just when God
[52:14] had called me and things that he would
[52:15] just drop my way and I've always looked
[52:17] at that because there's no situation
[52:19] Beyond Redemption if God is delivered I
[52:22] look at it this way if God has dropped
[52:25] and brought a message to you you and I
[52:27] then I I don't believe there's anything
[52:29] beyond Redemption I in other words if
[52:31] there is then it's going to be something
[52:33] between that individual or that person's
[52:35] in God but it's not going to be between
[52:37] me and that individual and God knows how
[52:40] to sort all those things out so so in
[52:43] living beyond our duty you know it's
[52:46] like you know within something that
[52:48] sometimes you can even walk into stores
[52:50] or places of certain restaurants you
[52:52] know and man I mean you know if you go
[52:54] to ask them Beyond they're running the
[52:56] register and so if you if you go to ask
[52:58] them maybe for a refill that's that's
[53:01] that's beyond their Duty and yet they're
[53:04] working for that you know that
[53:05] restaurant I mean you know that that's
[53:07] beyond but yet you know when you you see
[53:10] things I can remember probably many of
[53:11] us can fellowship with this that when
[53:13] you worked and you did things when I
[53:15] taught school and other things like that
[53:17] there are many things that we at times
[53:19] will do that was beyond just what the
[53:21] necessities of our own classroom or our
[53:23] own responsibility is there's times
[53:26] where we would go beyond just just to be
[53:28] of a help and and to see there was a
[53:31] need that was there maybe sometimes you
[53:33] know walking by a classroom and man I
[53:35] needed to get down to mine but somebody
[53:37] May needed a table moved and you know
[53:39] the janitor wasn't there the fireman so
[53:41] you know we just don't set around you
[53:43] know I mean we were Union but you know
[53:44] you just don't sit around and just say
[53:46] well we'll just wait for the next guy
[53:48] who's a union guy to you know show up
[53:50] you know we didn't lean on shovels or
[53:51] anything like that we just would get in
[53:53] there and if you need this mood hey all
[53:55] right I I help you move move this hey I
[53:57] you're go ahead you need to get in there
[53:59] when these finish copying I'll bring
[54:00] them over to your room or I'll run them
[54:02] down and sometimes it's little things
[54:04] like that of just even in the natural of
[54:07] living beyond our duty because sometimes
[54:10] we can get so trapped just within our
[54:12] own borders and yet God wants us to live
[54:16] uh not not and when I want to say this
[54:18] in this way living beyond just what he's
[54:20] called us to do because when we go
[54:23] beyond with just what he's called us to
[54:24] do there's a blessing within it and what
[54:27] God and it's a help that God has called
[54:29] us and where and where he would call us
[54:31] to minister to let me let me get into
[54:33] this here in the scripture here in
[54:35] tonight it says in Romans 12:4 for as we
[54:39] have many members in one body and all
[54:42] members have not the same office or the
[54:45] same function so we being many are one
[54:48] body in Christ and everyone members one
[54:52] of another having then gifts differing
[54:55] according to the grace that is given to
[54:58] us whether prophecy let us prophesy
[55:01] according to the proportion of Faith or
[55:04] Ministry let us wait or on our ministry
[55:07] or he that teacheth on teaching or he
[55:09] that exhorteth on exort on exhortation
[55:12] he that giveth Now watch how this watch
[55:14] how Paul will go into this he that
[55:16] giveth let him do it with Simplicity or
[55:19] in other words not as though to promote
[55:21] one's own
[55:23] self-interest so notice how this is
[55:25] being tied in of the many gifts in the
[55:27] body Paul did not somehow just you know
[55:30] lift up the ministerial gifts and then
[55:33] take these parts down here on he that
[55:35] giveth let him do it with Simplicity
[55:37] then somehow put us in the footnotes or
[55:39] superscription on really really small
[55:41] letters but it's a vital part of the
[55:44] body of Jesus Christ he would say let
[55:46] him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth
[55:49] with diligence and he that showeth Mercy
[55:53] with cheerfulness I I certainly believe
[55:55] that all of us are called to show
[55:58] Mercy but you know when we look at this
[56:00] then evidently evidently that there
[56:03] would be some within the body that would
[56:06] even this would be such a part of their
[56:08] Ministry to actually show Mercy I I
[56:13] wonder how much that maybe that they
[56:15] would struggle because no matter what
[56:17] God has called you to when you really
[56:20] you you never feel sufficient to the
[56:22] task you you don't as a matter of fact
[56:24] the whatever God has called you to the
[56:26] more you feel insufficient as you go
[56:28] along I I've been ministering for for
[56:30] well now pastoring for 22 years I don't
[56:33] feel that I'm more capable now than I
[56:35] was when I started matter of fact I feel
[56:37] more insufficient than I did when I
[56:39] first started I I feel the burden even
[56:42] in a greater way I feel the
[56:44] responsibility in a greater way I I tell
[56:47] you I realize my my need of him is in a
[56:50] greater way than it's ever been I'm not
[56:52] just telling you that that's the truth
[56:54] that's exactly how I feel over and over
[56:56] over asking God Lord give me the wisdom
[56:58] because I don't know how to approach
[57:00] this I might think but I I need your
[57:02] wisdom you see God has a way of so
[57:05] tempering Our Lives to where that he
[57:07] will help us and encourage us to look
[57:10] beyond our insufficiencies and to look
[57:13] to him who is the sufficiency of all
[57:16] things remember God did not call us
[57:19] because we had great strengths we had
[57:21] great abilities but God himself Paul
[57:23] would actually say it like this you see
[57:25] that not many mighty and Noble is
[57:28] actually called but God has called the
[57:30] base things the weak things many things
[57:32] that we would look over in the choosing
[57:35] but God has called it in that way why
[57:38] the prophet said as we would surrender
[57:40] our weaknesses to him he'll pour his
[57:43] strength in and move through our lives
[57:46] so so the whole thing comes down to him
[57:48] receiving the glory and I would say that
[57:51] no doubt that no you know within things
[57:53] that those who would would give those
[57:55] who would show Mercy those even when it
[57:58] comes to the difference of the
[57:59] ministering of the gifts I mean because
[58:01] no man who's a minister knows exactly to
[58:04] what what level of how God is going to
[58:07] even use that Ministry or that gift it's
[58:09] really not up to the man as far as how
[58:11] that gift is used the Bible said every
[58:14] gift will make room for itself so a man
[58:17] anybody that has a gift doesn't have to
[58:18] trample over doesn't have to put himself
[58:21] forward if God sees fit to use that gift
[58:24] in whatever capacity it will have to be
[58:27] God to use that gift and may God help
[58:30] that individual to stay in a place to
[58:32] where God can continue to use it but let
[58:34] me just say this if God would take one
[58:37] gift and maybe it's a ministering gift
[58:39] and God would take that gift and that
[58:40] man might only preach once out of a year
[58:43] and here's a pastor that would preach
[58:45] time and time again but you know what as
[58:47] long as that one person would stay
[58:50] within what God has called them to do
[58:52] they are thought of just as much in the
[58:55] conom and Kingdom of God as him that
[58:58] would Minister or those that would sing
[59:00] specials over and over we are thought of
[59:03] just as much if we will do what God has
[59:06] called us to do but many times brother
[59:08] Ram says God has to drive us into our
[59:11] correct
[59:12] Ministry aren't you glad that he'll do
[59:15] that I'm glad he will amen so cuz I'll
[59:19] tell you what he had to drive me cuz I
[59:21] didn't want to be a pastor I was happy
[59:23] just being a minister being a pastor I
[59:25] left the room many times a mom can
[59:26] witness to it when Dad would go to bring
[59:28] it up I I got to a point I said I'm
[59:30] telling you I'll see you tomorrow good
[59:32] night I I didn't want it it wasn't that
[59:35] I didn't love God's people I love God's
[59:37] people it just scared me to death when I
[59:40] seen the responsibility of it and I
[59:42] looked at it and this is exactly what I
[59:43] told my dad if you need me to visit more
[59:46] people if you need me to take the
[59:48] midweek Services I'll do anything more
[59:51] that you want me to do but you're my
[59:53] pastor no more discussion
[59:57] then something
[59:58] happened but needless to say you know
[1:00:01] when you get to looking at it I I think
[1:00:04] that for the most part that we can
[1:00:05] Fellowship on that point that many times
[1:00:08] as we deal with that part of feeling
[1:00:11] insufficient and one of those things
[1:00:12] because sometimes we will do the very
[1:00:15] thing that the Bible tells us not to do
[1:00:17] in comparing ourselves with one another
[1:00:20] and that's the worst thing that we can
[1:00:21] ever do God uses each one in a very a
[1:00:24] certain way and a certain uh uh just for
[1:00:27] a certain uh calling and a certain way
[1:00:29] he wants to use it and to a certain
[1:00:30] degree now notice how brother BR puts
[1:00:32] this here because when we're talking
[1:00:35] about this it's actually yielding our
[1:00:37] members now we know what yielding is you
[1:00:39] know when you're yielding it's like
[1:00:40] brother Bram described that coat you
[1:00:42] know you trying to put the coat on you
[1:00:44] put your arm in here now you need
[1:00:45] somebody to take your hand and put it
[1:00:47] down this sleeve to yield means simply
[1:00:50] to get out of the way and some one of
[1:00:52] the greatest places for us to get out of
[1:00:54] the way is right here yes is right in
[1:00:56] our minds that's where Satan will try to
[1:00:58] get us in our minds and we start
[1:00:59] entertaining certain thoughts but this
[1:01:02] is exactly what God calls us to do is
[1:01:04] just yield I I'll I will do my work
[1:01:07] through you now brother B says it like
[1:01:10] this and our hope is in God he said all
[1:01:12] right now here his spirit is here he's
[1:01:14] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:01:17] he's moving in his church church you
[1:01:19] know what's the matter with it here's
[1:01:21] what it is you're not yielding to the
[1:01:23] Holy Spirit you receive the Holy Spirit
[1:01:26] and think well that's as much as I
[1:01:30] go I mean I'm sealed I mean let's look
[1:01:34] at it let's just Fellowship don't read
[1:01:35] ahead of me now let's just Fellowship
[1:01:38] what what's what what what is all the
[1:01:39] laboring what is all the ministering of
[1:01:42] the word be sealed right give your life
[1:01:45] to the Lord the salvation of the Lord
[1:01:48] God working cleaning up that life and
[1:01:50] then that life being filled with his
[1:01:52] presence that's the whole goal is that
[1:01:54] lives would be sealed Away by the spirit
[1:01:57] of the Living God the the Holy Spirit
[1:01:59] that's the achievement in our life it's
[1:02:01] nothing less than that it's to be filled
[1:02:04] with God's spirit to be inhabited by him
[1:02:07] but remember Sanctified means set aside
[1:02:11] for service and the Holy Spirit comes to
[1:02:15] put us in service is that right now
[1:02:19] notice he says you're just ready to go
[1:02:22] to to work for God then when you're when
[1:02:26] you receive the Holy Spirit by Believing
[1:02:28] on Jesus Christ and receiving the Holy
[1:02:31] Spirit then you're just a candidate to
[1:02:34] go to work for God then go to yielding
[1:02:37] your members to him and see what he will
[1:02:41] have you do he might have you to preach
[1:02:44] sing testify pass out tracks talk to
[1:02:48] people bring someone to church all kinds
[1:02:52] of gifts and helps that's in the body of
[1:02:55] Christ some are called for one thing and
[1:02:58] some
[1:02:59] another now this is what was the key
[1:03:02] here is that the prophet would say at
[1:03:04] the end of that point right there go to
[1:03:06] yielding your members to him see what he
[1:03:10] will have you to do right oh my as he
[1:03:15] goes on he says but no matter what you
[1:03:16] got how little it is well brother
[1:03:19] Brandon the only thing I can do I I I
[1:03:21] might I might talk to some people well
[1:03:23] that may not be very much to you but put
[1:03:26] it in the hands of Jesus and see what
[1:03:28] he'll do with it like the little fishes
[1:03:31] that was in the little boy's hand it
[1:03:33] could only feed him but when he put it
[1:03:35] in Jesus hand it fed 5,000 so it will be
[1:03:38] with you put what you have in his
[1:03:42] hand now notice how notice how the
[1:03:45] prophet has said this inviting somebody
[1:03:47] to church passing out tracks Ministry
[1:03:51] all of these other parts preaching
[1:03:53] singing testifying it's all part of the
[1:03:56] body remember the spirit of God working
[1:03:59] in our life I can say it like this our
[1:04:02] lives are not meant to be a black
[1:04:04] hole where it's all of a sudden it's
[1:04:06] just and just the spirit of God received
[1:04:09] and there's no
[1:04:11] outworking that's not how God intended
[1:04:13] it it's just like the plants that are
[1:04:16] out here or the the crops across the
[1:04:18] road they receive nourishment not just
[1:04:20] the rain that's coming down but do you
[1:04:22] realize every time that we have a
[1:04:24] thunderstorm you can study this out in
[1:04:26] science when we study when we have a
[1:04:28] thunderstorm and lightning strikes the
[1:04:30] ground you know what's happening
[1:04:32] nitrogen is being put into the soil and
[1:04:35] our plants need certain nutrients in
[1:04:38] order nitrogen being one of them that
[1:04:40] will actually begin to bring from that
[1:04:42] soil sometimes we wonder why the tests
[1:04:45] and trials we come through as the Bible
[1:04:47] said love it has it says in the Book of
[1:04:49] Psalms sometimes we're tossed like a
[1:04:51] bottle stopper we're tossed on the sea
[1:04:53] of Life the Bible said when we come to
[1:04:56] our wits end when we're in places and it
[1:04:59] seems like lightning striking here and
[1:05:01] lightning striking there remember the
[1:05:03] prophet said the old southern expression
[1:05:05] raining cats and dogs but yet we're
[1:05:08] realizing out of all of that what's God
[1:05:10] doing he's imparting into our life the
[1:05:13] nutrients that are actually needed to
[1:05:15] produce fruit within our
[1:05:18] lives my my my and yet and yet through
[1:05:23] all of this through little things that
[1:05:25] we that we can do and I don't want when
[1:05:27] I say little things I'm not belittling
[1:05:29] anything I'm just saying sometimes the
[1:05:31] things that we're looking at we can
[1:05:33] actually be looking Beyond where we're
[1:05:36] at and what God has called us to do and
[1:05:39] somehow we look at it as it's
[1:05:40] insufficient it's menial it'll never
[1:05:43] have any impact at all but remember like
[1:05:45] the lord gave us that example again last
[1:05:47] week we do not know that little lady's
[1:05:50] name who rented that horse that horse
[1:05:52] barn cleaned it out it was not a a Duty
[1:05:55] or for a job that anybody would have
[1:05:57] been signing up for I mean come on I
[1:05:59] mean I don't even like picking up the
[1:06:01] dog stuff in my backyard let alone going
[1:06:03] and picking up horse manure out of a
[1:06:05] barn and cleaning it up but you know
[1:06:07] what God put that burden on her
[1:06:10] heart and she did her part God God
[1:06:14] worked through her and yet now we know
[1:06:16] Dwight Moody and what came out of it let
[1:06:18] me tell you something every soul that
[1:06:20] Dwight Moody led to the Lord will be
[1:06:23] attributed to her account
[1:06:27] and yet we don't even know her name but
[1:06:29] God knows her
[1:06:30] name he knows all about it you know I
[1:06:33] wonder if she could have no doubt
[1:06:35] wrestled in her mind well I wonder who's
[1:06:37] going to come and oh maybe I can't do
[1:06:39] that I I wouldn't be able to do that but
[1:06:41] I I would say that it got to such a
[1:06:43] place in her life through all the tests
[1:06:45] through all the trials through all the
[1:06:47] molding and all the shaping to where she
[1:06:49] would get to such a place to say yes
[1:06:52] Lord see that brings it down home
[1:06:54] doesn't it it gets get God works with us
[1:06:57] and works with us sometimes we'd wonder
[1:06:59] why he continues to fool with
[1:07:01] us right because man we'd be ready to
[1:07:04] discipline our children and leave them
[1:07:05] in the corner or SWAT them or anything
[1:07:07] else as many times as he's had to tell
[1:07:09] us and get on us about things or
[1:07:11] encourage us but you know what God
[1:07:13] continues to work and to encourage us
[1:07:16] because he wants to live out that part
[1:07:19] and portion of what he's called us to do
[1:07:22] and you know what it isn't enough to me
[1:07:23] to tell him God this is what I want to
[1:07:25] to do I want to do this but God may not
[1:07:28] want that may not be what God's called
[1:07:29] me to do God may may God will use
[1:07:32] somebody else this is why we God doesn't
[1:07:34] want us being like somebody else God
[1:07:36] wants us to be who we are and him living
[1:07:41] his own life through US amen woo my my
[1:07:46] my so it's living beyond self that's a
[1:07:49] tall
[1:07:50] task cuz really there's nobody we love
[1:07:54] better than
[1:07:56] self that's all right I'll say amen for
[1:07:59] you and me
[1:08:00] both right living beyond self but you
[1:08:03] know what this is where the Holy Spirit
[1:08:05] comes by way of the new birth to Deliver
[1:08:08] Us from self and he keeps working in our
[1:08:12] lives depending on how we're made up you
[1:08:15] know and all these different things God
[1:08:16] but God's still working to Deliver Us
[1:08:18] from self and bring us into that place
[1:08:20] of living for him you know brother BR
[1:08:22] would say it like this in one place I
[1:08:24] want you to just listen to this before I
[1:08:25] read the next quote he tend of how that
[1:08:27] Paul himself said I preach the gospel
[1:08:30] and Paul said you know I've got a right
[1:08:31] to live of the Gospel he said but I've
[1:08:34] chosen to sacrifice and make tents on
[1:08:37] the side Paul said marriage is Honorable
[1:08:41] the bed undefiled it's it's it's it's
[1:08:44] totally permissible by God it's an
[1:08:46] honorable thing but Paul said I've
[1:08:48] chosen not to be
[1:08:50] married now it wasn't Paul was laying
[1:08:53] down a pattern for everybody else to
[1:08:55] follow he's just speaking of the
[1:08:57] sacrifice that he himself had made now
[1:09:01] where did Paul get this kind of an
[1:09:03] example he got it from the Lord Jesus
[1:09:07] because when God became one of us he
[1:09:09] lived Beyond his own Duty his duty was
[1:09:13] to come down remember the prophet said
[1:09:16] his whole purpose was to redeem you and
[1:09:19] I but he lived beyond the purpose of
[1:09:23] redemption when he stood in Pilot's off
[1:09:25] he said for this purpose have I come is
[1:09:28] that right to bear witness unto the life
[1:09:31] but he lived Beyond it he ministered
[1:09:33] healing to those in the Physical Realm
[1:09:36] emotional realm spiritual realm he even
[1:09:39] took about and cared for those who did
[1:09:42] not even have necessities to
[1:09:46] eat he lived Beyond his own Duty now he
[1:09:51] could have no notice God could have just
[1:09:52] simply said look I don't got time for
[1:09:54] that I'm here just to be the
[1:09:58] sacrifice I don't got time for that
[1:10:00] you're hungry get a job go to
[1:10:04] work I mean you you come out here you
[1:10:06] came out here in in a meeting like this
[1:10:08] and didn't even bring something to eat
[1:10:11] aren't you glad that God's not a
[1:10:12] lecturer like some of us
[1:10:15] are aren't you glad that when we when
[1:10:18] something has been done wrong that he
[1:10:19] doesn't line it up and and oh it should
[1:10:21] have been done this way but you know
[1:10:23] what God doesn't expect you to be
[1:10:24] perfect cuz there ain't no way you can
[1:10:26] be perfect but God himself comes to
[1:10:28] minister to our needs not to lecture us
[1:10:32] on these different things but listen
[1:10:33] friends within all of this he lived
[1:10:36] Beyond his own
[1:10:39] Duty that was eternal life
[1:10:43] amen let me just say this to you this
[1:10:47] very thing right here on display it's
[1:10:49] the message on display this is not
[1:10:52] Sunday school this is the message on
[1:10:54] display so as a matter of fact when I
[1:10:56] was down there in Jeffersonville and
[1:10:58] talking just with some of them around
[1:11:00] within the city you know what the
[1:11:01] Catholics loved brother
[1:11:04] brandham go figure that one
[1:11:06] out they loved him in in Jeffersonville
[1:11:09] they loved him in the surrounding
[1:11:10] Community he he stood for the word of
[1:11:12] God but they had such a love and a
[1:11:14] respect for him you know even the
[1:11:16] testimonies that would go around
[1:11:18] remember even the some of the stuff
[1:11:19] where different ones have said this
[1:11:21] about the bridge and whatever more and
[1:11:23] voice of God Brother Joseph and them
[1:11:24] went and they interviewed that one mayor
[1:11:26] vissing you can see it on online he
[1:11:28] talks about how his daddy and
[1:11:30] grandfather and things like that he
[1:11:31] begins to break all that down about the
[1:11:33] bridge and how you know there were just
[1:11:35] people falling in the cement pisters
[1:11:37] where they were pouring them I mean they
[1:11:38] didn't stop because if you stop the job
[1:11:40] to ride everything up it stopped the
[1:11:42] progress on the bridge that's why
[1:11:44] there's no records of people dying from
[1:11:46] off the bridge but he would write this
[1:11:49] or actually express it he said bill
[1:11:51] brandham was the kind of person he said
[1:11:53] he when he went and hunted bear he would
[1:11:55] take bare meat to the neighbors and to
[1:11:58] the people in the community that were in
[1:12:00] need not just to people who were of the
[1:12:02] brandom Tabernacle although that would
[1:12:05] have been a great blessing too yeah
[1:12:07] right I mean that would have been
[1:12:08] tremendous just that
[1:12:10] alone now understand I'm not I'm not
[1:12:12] here God's not bringing a word to make
[1:12:14] everybody spiritual
[1:12:17] philanthropist that's not what this is
[1:12:20] about it's about what God has called us
[1:12:22] to do and will test us to live beyond
[1:12:25] our own
[1:12:26] Duty come on sometimes we've already
[1:12:29] been tested within this to live beyond
[1:12:31] our own Duty we're tested sometimes
[1:12:33] within these things now watch brother
[1:12:35] Bram says this he says we want to do
[1:12:37] something beyond our duty if you are
[1:12:40] really born again of the spirit of God
[1:12:42] and say well it's my duty to go to
[1:12:44] church I guess I have to oh my I want to
[1:12:48] do more than that I want to win some
[1:12:51] souls for Christ I want to do something
[1:12:54] I want to visit the sick or do something
[1:12:56] for him it's my duty to preach funerals
[1:13:00] it's my duty to preach the gospel it's
[1:13:03] my duty to pray for the sick but let me
[1:13:05] do something else let me get out and do
[1:13:09] something where God will honor Me by it
[1:13:13] so not just do the bare minimum right in
[1:13:18] other words we have our own little world
[1:13:20] that we live in and Friends listen I
[1:13:23] understand the pressures and things that
[1:13:25] we we have today there things that we
[1:13:27] have I mean your more and more is not
[1:13:29] only being required of you out at your
[1:13:31] work and different things and then you
[1:13:33] have with family you have so many
[1:13:35] different things that can be so taxing
[1:13:37] there can be even with the the amount of
[1:13:39] spirits that we're dealing with in this
[1:13:41] hour the present darkness that is around
[1:13:44] us but listen god listen let me say this
[1:13:47] to you God did not put us here that we
[1:13:49] would just be survivors we are we are
[1:13:53] built to be Overcomers
[1:13:55] as a matter of fact that God would even
[1:13:58] recognize in the pergami and age of
[1:14:01] those who were there in Satan's seat and
[1:14:04] were living a Victorious overcoming life
[1:14:09] right at Satan's
[1:14:10] seat
[1:14:12] Victorious and God would even call it
[1:14:14] out in the back in the book of uh uh in
[1:14:17] the church age of uh to uh um uh the
[1:14:22] church age of of the batara and how that
[1:14:25] the darkness was present and brother B
[1:14:27] says let Satan come with his pressures
[1:14:31] and how that he would try to stop and
[1:14:34] and stifle the work of God and he said
[1:14:36] what's the answer to of the believer to
[1:14:39] that increased labor and sacrifice to
[1:14:42] the kingdom of God wow to battle against
[1:14:47] the oppression of Lady of of of thara
[1:14:50] same thing with Lady oia and what is it
[1:14:52] increased service not not wor Works to
[1:14:55] try to work my way in and oh I'm going
[1:14:57] to do this to to get no no remember the
[1:14:59] blood of Calvary has already done that
[1:15:02] for you and I listen if I don't let me
[1:15:04] just say it like the prophet said it if
[1:15:06] I Don't Preach another message I'm
[1:15:11] saved if I would refuse right now and
[1:15:14] say Lord I'm done I'm tired I'm I'm done
[1:15:17] I I I don't want to I don't want to you
[1:15:19] know lay and study and pray and and then
[1:15:22] just labor with him this I I'm done I I
[1:15:24] don't want to I don't want to Pastor I
[1:15:25] don't want to do that no more now it's
[1:15:27] one thing for me to say that but if
[1:15:29] that's not what God has entrusted for me
[1:15:31] to do then God is entrusted to give me
[1:15:34] the strength and the leadership that I
[1:15:36] need that I need for him but you realize
[1:15:39] it will not have one effect on my my
[1:15:42] eternal destination it does not change
[1:15:44] that I'm a son and daughter of God but
[1:15:46] what will change is if I stand there at
[1:15:49] the Judgment seat of Christ we all Paul
[1:15:52] said must stand at the Judgment seat of
[1:15:54] Christ not the white Throne the Judgment
[1:15:57] seat of Christ and give an account for
[1:15:59] the Deeds Done in this
[1:16:02] body when God will
[1:16:05] say well I mean you you came to church
[1:16:08] and you supported
[1:16:14] you you wouldn't let me use you
[1:16:18] more you were too self-centered Samuel
[1:16:21] you you're too you you allow things you
[1:16:23] didn't even allow others when well God I
[1:16:25] was I got so discouraged but you didn't
[1:16:27] allow me to minister encouragement to
[1:16:31] you Hallelujah you didn't allow
[1:16:34] it you say is that is that real oh it's
[1:16:36] very real friends but we're not doing it
[1:16:39] I listen I me say right now everything
[1:16:41] that we're doing we're not doing for
[1:16:43] rewards amen I don't care if I get any
[1:16:45] reward or not what what the what burns
[1:16:48] within my heart not just to preach the
[1:16:49] gospel but to minister to somebody else
[1:16:52] along the way they may not even darken
[1:16:55] this church door they might go to
[1:16:56] another church then and someone along
[1:16:59] the way at the grocery store or
[1:17:01] somewhere it doesn't matter as long as I
[1:17:03] can be of a help to somebody to
[1:17:06] encourage somebody along the way amen
[1:17:09] but let me just tell you this right here
[1:17:12] the Bible says if an Infidel does
[1:17:14] provide a man who don't provide for his
[1:17:16] own house is worse than an Infidel you
[1:17:18] say what does that mean if my focus is
[1:17:20] outside of what's going on here my focus
[1:17:23] is
[1:17:23] wrong I want to be a help to others but
[1:17:26] this is right here the body of Jesus
[1:17:28] Christ not just me for every one of us
[1:17:30] who call this our home
[1:17:32] church is that right yes woo got quiet
[1:17:36] but it'd be all right something beyond
[1:17:39] our own Duty now when we think about
[1:17:42] that you know it's kind of like even in
[1:17:43] our Even in our home and in our homes
[1:17:46] the Bible says look not every man on his
[1:17:48] own things but every man also on the
[1:17:50] things of others I mean you know son or
[1:17:53] daughter my goodness man they can keep
[1:17:54] keep their room they keep it clean they
[1:17:56] keep their room
[1:18:00] clean but when it comes to helping out
[1:18:02] with the
[1:18:04] dishes mom's got
[1:18:07] this dad's got
[1:18:09] this I know that's a big step the the
[1:18:12] room clean I know that's a big step but
[1:18:15] you know even going Beyond well that's
[1:18:17] not my
[1:18:18] responsibility I'm not the wife here I'm
[1:18:21] not the mother
[1:18:22] here I mean but you see some of those
[1:18:25] things where we have to that instruction
[1:18:28] comes of living beyond just our own Duty
[1:18:32] because marriage itself is living beyond
[1:18:34] your own Duty right if you try to do
[1:18:36] that and try try to do that I tell you
[1:18:39] uh don't try to do that cuz I don't want
[1:18:40] to be back in that
[1:18:42] office but that becomes a selfish life
[1:18:45] because Mar marriage itself is actually
[1:18:47] the highest form of sacrifice yes right
[1:18:49] because in order to be United with him
[1:18:52] he had to give his life completely for
[1:18:54] you and I
[1:18:55] right it's it's a sacrificial life it's
[1:18:57] living beyond duty this is why the
[1:18:59] prophet did not look at sister meia and
[1:19:01] say man she's all tore up hey honey I'll
[1:19:03] be in the recliner cuz I have had a
[1:19:05] taxing day I am all wore out remember
[1:19:07] brother BR said he was tired that day he
[1:19:10] was all wore out he had had people
[1:19:11] telling him you better listen to me if
[1:19:13] you don't listen to me God's going to
[1:19:14] bring that airplane down you're riding
[1:19:16] on you need to listen to me all this all
[1:19:18] sorts of nonsense as well as helping out
[1:19:21] people in need no wonder sister mey was
[1:19:23] in a nervous wreck with with having
[1:19:25] people walk through the house like that
[1:19:27] but he could have went over to his
[1:19:28] recliner and said you know what I'll see
[1:19:30] you later just let me know let me know
[1:19:32] when it's time to put my phone down so I
[1:19:34] can come and have dinner when you get it
[1:19:36] ready oh wow yeah woo how do we get here
[1:19:39] y that's good but see sometimes that
[1:19:41] going beyond our own duty is sometimes
[1:19:44] it may not be that you know for goodness
[1:19:45] sake some of us then our wives don't
[1:19:47] want us in there helping out cuz it'd be
[1:19:49] nothing but burnt offerings we'd be
[1:19:51] offering up they don't want us in there
[1:19:52] like that but maybe our duty within it
[1:19:55] would just be to sit there and talk and
[1:19:57] more than likely as a husband it's just
[1:20:00] to listen and say my wow oh my dear yes
[1:20:04] and and just to listen you know how it
[1:20:06] is because how did we get here because
[1:20:09] you know even with men men it's like
[1:20:12] 10,000 words a day women 30,000 words a
[1:20:15] day some maybe a little bit more and you
[1:20:17] know sometimes our 10,000 words we gave
[1:20:20] them all out within the first hour a
[1:20:22] couple hours of the day we're actually
[1:20:24] having to borrow words but sometimes
[1:20:27] living beyond our own duty is just our
[1:20:30] presence being right
[1:20:33] there so brother Brenham didn't pull
[1:20:35] that card and say I'll be in there he
[1:20:38] got him on an
[1:20:39] apron he lived Beyond his own
[1:20:43] Duty
[1:20:45] hallelujah oh my oh that that dish so it
[1:20:48] bothers my hands have her buy you some
[1:20:50] that'll soften it and soften your heart
[1:20:53] soften your
[1:20:56] attitude my goodness goodness
[1:20:59] gracious oh my so notice look not every
[1:21:03] man on his own things but every man also
[1:21:06] on the things of
[1:21:10] others friends I believe with all my
[1:21:13] heart I I can tell you from experience
[1:21:15] this is a
[1:21:16] challenge it's a challenge it's and
[1:21:19] God's not asking you and I in this
[1:21:20] scripture to go around and say now
[1:21:22] sister rosan I want you to tell me all
[1:21:23] your needs right now then go to the next
[1:21:25] person we got a great stopad and we've
[1:21:27] went around like from cubicle to cubicle
[1:21:29] and we've got everything wrote down
[1:21:30] that's not it at all the prophet
[1:21:32] actually tells us in this way it just
[1:21:35] living so close to Christ to where that
[1:21:38] sensitivity when there's a need because
[1:21:41] God is not expecting us to gang pile on
[1:21:44] somebody altogether but it might be you
[1:21:46] ministering to somebody else and you
[1:21:49] ministering to somebody else as the body
[1:21:51] itself ministering one to another right
[1:21:55] ameno my my my now notice this here I I
[1:21:59] know I got I got to keep on moving here
[1:22:01] so when we look at this brother randam
[1:22:04] you know he would he would make this
[1:22:05] statement he says you know many times he
[1:22:07] said you know he said like Elizabeth and
[1:22:10] Mary he said when they ran out and they
[1:22:11] begin to greet one another hug one
[1:22:13] another like women used to do they'd
[1:22:15] meet one another smile and be friendly
[1:22:17] he said I tell you that's a whole lot
[1:22:19] the matter with the people today they're
[1:22:20] not friendly like they used to be the
[1:22:22] people has got too selfish got to a
[1:22:25] place where they think they live in a
[1:22:27] little world by themselves you know he
[1:22:29] said that's the truth brother BR said we
[1:22:32] used to be able to go to the farm next
[1:22:33] door and borrow $50 if we ran tight he
[1:22:35] said now he said you got to have a
[1:22:37] written
[1:22:39] contract I mean in today's economy you
[1:22:42] got to have a a written contract for a
[1:22:44] dollar you know promised note but notice
[1:22:48] consider within this the life of the
[1:22:50] Lord Jesus and you know let me just kind
[1:22:53] of move through here a couple places in
[1:22:56] the scripture in first in First Peter
[1:22:58] chapter 4 Peter would write like this
[1:23:00] the end of all things is at hand be ye
[1:23:03] therefore sober and watch unto prayer
[1:23:05] and above all things have fervent
[1:23:08] charity among yourselves for charity
[1:23:11] shall cover the multitude of
[1:23:14] sins right I don't know about you but I
[1:23:16] could use more of the love of God I
[1:23:19] could I need more of the love of God cuz
[1:23:21] this whole thing of fervent charity
[1:23:23] means the forgiving of offenses of one
[1:23:25] another God let the love of God be so
[1:23:28] great in our lives to where it doesn't
[1:23:30] stick on our lives because we are
[1:23:32] members one of of
[1:23:33] another listen friends there you can't
[1:23:36] you can't talk those things out it's got
[1:23:38] to come from in his presence his
[1:23:40] presence is what sweetens you and I as
[1:23:43] we will surrender ourselves to him now
[1:23:46] with that being said with being fervent
[1:23:49] in charity brother Ram says use or not
[1:23:52] brother Ram but Peter says use h
[1:23:54] Hospitality one to another without
[1:23:57] grudging oh my let me get to that in a
[1:24:00] minute as every man hath received the
[1:24:02] gift even so Minister the same one to
[1:24:04] another as good stewards of the manifold
[1:24:07] grace of God now let me read this here
[1:24:09] in layman's terms Amplified it says
[1:24:13] practice Hospitality to one another
[1:24:16] those of the household of faith be
[1:24:18] hospitable be a lover of strangers with
[1:24:22] brotherly affection for the unknown
[1:24:24] guest the foreigners the poor and all
[1:24:27] others who come your way who are of
[1:24:30] Christ's
[1:24:31] body and your part or my part might be
[1:24:36] simply a little bit greater within this
[1:24:38] area of what God has gifted us to
[1:24:41] be now I I tell you every one of us
[1:24:44] we've all got challenges and God works
[1:24:47] with us in such certain ways isn't it
[1:24:49] just incredible that God does not take
[1:24:52] your temperament if it's not so so
[1:24:54] fitted for certain things and make you
[1:24:57] the door
[1:24:58] greeter and but yet he'll still work on
[1:25:01] your life he'll still mold and shape
[1:25:04] your life right I mean cuz God I mean
[1:25:07] think about it brother Carlos was out
[1:25:09] there at the door and and you coming in
[1:25:11] to say hey how come I ain't how come I
[1:25:13] ain't seen you last
[1:25:15] Sunday what's going on
[1:25:17] here you know I ain't seen you for a
[1:25:19] month you got the Holy
[1:25:22] Ghost I wonder how many people would be
[1:25:25] in
[1:25:26] here right there at the door they would
[1:25:29] be thinking dear God is this truck here
[1:25:31] today let me see is that Marine sign in
[1:25:33] yeah he's dug in the bay buddy he's
[1:25:35] waiting on
[1:25:37] you he's ready to throw some personal
[1:25:39] grenad your
[1:25:41] way you know to kind of welcome
[1:25:45] you ain't it incredible but yet listen
[1:25:48] God in fitted everybody to that now you
[1:25:52] might think that's something like a
[1:25:53] little iial task that oh you know
[1:25:56] Brother Carlos just out there greeting
[1:25:58] this he don't know at all that I was
[1:25:59] going to say this and neither did I but
[1:26:01] you know what you might think that's a
[1:26:02] little thing that's out there but let me
[1:26:04] tell you something that very thing out
[1:26:06] there is so necessary it's so necessary
[1:26:09] of greeting the people of God when they
[1:26:11] come in the door and welcome them to the
[1:26:13] house of God come on friends to welcome
[1:26:17] one another I thank God that there's a
[1:26:19] welcoming and a Warmness even in that
[1:26:22] right there because sometimes when we
[1:26:24] come in here that's the first smiling
[1:26:27] face and encouraging word that we have
[1:26:30] received and God works through that part
[1:26:33] of the
[1:26:35] body Brother Carlos ain't demanded hey I
[1:26:38] want to do this and hey I want to do
[1:26:40] that I need to do this he stands right
[1:26:42] there by that door and he welcomes you
[1:26:44] when you come
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:47] in and who even act like some of you
[1:26:49] know how to speak Spanish when you
[1:26:52] don't your Patron
[1:26:54] you right don't laugh at that one
[1:26:57] Brother
[1:26:58] Carlos I don't want to get in trouble on
[1:27:00] that now notice this it says be Hospital
[1:27:04] be lovers I already read that part and
[1:27:06] in each instance do it
[1:27:09] ungrudgingly cordially graciously
[1:27:12] without complaining but as representing
[1:27:14] him as each of you have received a gift
[1:27:19] a particular spiritual Talent a gracious
[1:27:21] Divine endowment employ it for one
[1:27:25] another as it befits good
[1:27:29] Trustees of God's many sided
[1:27:33] Grace that was just one side of God's
[1:27:39] grace but I read some others to you
[1:27:41] testifying singing specials right Min
[1:27:45] ministering to one another but notice
[1:27:48] even in this part of using
[1:27:51] Hospitality wow without grudging
[1:27:54] in other words being
[1:27:56] true
[1:27:58] like brother Aaron would y'all like to
[1:28:00] come over on Sunday don't don't answer
[1:28:02] that man just this is just
[1:28:04] example would y'all like to come over
[1:28:05] for Sunday it's Apple time man Apple
[1:28:08] Cris would y'all like to come over
[1:28:09] sister Rosanne y'all y'all come on over
[1:28:11] on Sunday and then all of a sudden after
[1:28:13] I get home it's like why in the world
[1:28:16] did I do
[1:28:21] that but it's grudgingly oh it's not
[1:28:23] outward ly it's
[1:28:25] grudgingly see it's not attributed to
[1:28:27] our
[1:28:29] account when it's done
[1:28:32] grudgingly but it's seeing the Need You
[1:28:34] Realize friends listen I I know I I'm
[1:28:37] just I'm just preaching from my heart
[1:28:39] you know it's incredible how at times
[1:28:41] that I found out that I was criticized
[1:28:43] for having not not here not here not
[1:28:45] here not here among the the people here
[1:28:46] right now and things like that
[1:28:47] criticized for having Fellowship
[1:28:50] dinners but you know what it was a
[1:28:52] misapplication
[1:28:54] of
[1:28:56] quotes it shows you why some people they
[1:28:58] and all of us need a pastor right not
[1:29:01] our own Pastor not shepher ourselves
[1:29:03] among but we need the leadership of the
[1:29:05] holy spirit because having a fellowship
[1:29:08] dinner is not what the prophet called
[1:29:09] soup
[1:29:11] suffers that was social events that had
[1:29:14] no merit
[1:29:16] whatsoever to pay a preacher but if the
[1:29:19] prophet of God was so against it why
[1:29:22] would he encourage it even in the
[1:29:24] message Shalom I see you've brought
[1:29:27] something for lunch to sit down and have
[1:29:30] lunch with one another oh how that
[1:29:33] Thrills my
[1:29:36] heart
[1:29:38] hallu what's the objective well I'll
[1:29:40] tell you there's times where we get down
[1:29:43] as even in the fellowship dinner to be
[1:29:45] able to talk with one another be able to
[1:29:47] you know to minister to one another it
[1:29:49] didn't mean that we've got to sit down
[1:29:50] and quote quotes with one another in
[1:29:52] scriptures if those if that all comes
[1:29:54] about that's fine but sometimes it
[1:29:55] doesn't bother me a bit if some of your
[1:29:58] your you know your children come in here
[1:30:00] maybe they're not even serving the lord
[1:30:01] maybe they wouldn't even darken these
[1:30:03] doors right now but it might be the
[1:30:05] grace of God even through that moment
[1:30:08] and that time that would make contact
[1:30:10] with their
[1:30:12] lives amen is that right listen friends
[1:30:15] sometimes people have been so church
[1:30:17] burned preacher burnt and religious
[1:30:19] burnt and everything else they need to
[1:30:21] see it's not religion this is a
[1:30:27] life Hallelujah that don't bother you
[1:30:30] don't bother me a
[1:30:33] bit don't bother me a bit at
[1:30:36] all now employ these various talents
[1:30:42] that's what we want to
[1:30:44] do sometimes the talents and things that
[1:30:46] God gives us is not what we would
[1:30:49] actually as I said we sometimes don't
[1:30:53] see the value or we look at it as being
[1:30:58] insufficient you know when God would
[1:31:01] give the vision to Moses about the
[1:31:03] Tabernacle and he said let the people
[1:31:05] make me a sanctuary that I may dwell
[1:31:08] among them God had men that were filled
[1:31:11] with the spirit of wisdom that would be
[1:31:13] able to U work with the medals and
[1:31:17] things like that they would be able to
[1:31:18] teach others others would learn but then
[1:31:20] you know what there was also different
[1:31:23] ones of the women who were able to spin
[1:31:27] goat's hair they were able to do certain
[1:31:31] things that maybe they didn't have maybe
[1:31:34] the certain thread that somebody else
[1:31:36] had they didn't have the black onx
[1:31:39] Stones it didn't matter what they had
[1:31:42] God knew what they had and it was needed
[1:31:45] just as much as anybody that would have
[1:31:48] had the gold or the silver because what
[1:31:50] it was going to do is come together to
[1:31:52] make a Dwelling Place for God that's
[1:31:56] what we want we want to surrender Lord I
[1:31:58] Surrender what what little talent I have
[1:32:01] I want to surrender it into your hands
[1:32:03] that you might have a Dwelling Place a
[1:32:06] place to be able to move and to work
[1:32:08] through think about this woman how many
[1:32:10] youever heard the the the of the sister
[1:32:12] in the scripture named
[1:32:13] Tabitha or also known as as Dorcas right
[1:32:17] in the scripture and the Bible tells us
[1:32:19] that here you know she had gotten very
[1:32:22] sick in verse 36 it's says that at japa
[1:32:25] there was a certain disciple named
[1:32:26] Tabitha which by interpretation is
[1:32:28] called Dorcas this woman was full of
[1:32:31] good works and arms Deeds which she did
[1:32:35] right now she didn't preach couldn't
[1:32:38] right sisters can't preach right Paul
[1:32:41] said I suffer not a woman to teach or
[1:32:43] assert authority over a man that's right
[1:32:44] is that right right she couldn't do that
[1:32:47] I would I wonder would would sister
[1:32:49] Dorcas or Tabitha I wonder if she was
[1:32:52] even one that says I you know what I I I
[1:32:55] can't give a testimony in front of
[1:32:56] everybody I I just I'm not not able to
[1:32:58] do
[1:33:01] that she wasn't able to do it didn't
[1:33:03] means she didn't have testimonies to
[1:33:05] give somehow or another those
[1:33:06] testimonies got out but and God had
[1:33:11] there was a special gift within her life
[1:33:13] she had good works meaning that there
[1:33:15] was an expression of her faith of that
[1:33:18] faith in her life but there's also noted
[1:33:21] this the arms Deeds charitable things
[1:33:24] that she did now you know Tabitha wasn't
[1:33:29] sitting around with you know a tripod
[1:33:31] that was readed and had a big bucket in
[1:33:32] the bottom and ringing a bell outside of
[1:33:34] Walmart that's not the kind of arms deed
[1:33:36] she was doing she won the first
[1:33:39] Salvation Army she was doing arms Deeds
[1:33:42] but nobody you would not it was not
[1:33:45] something that was publicized she didn't
[1:33:47] have her own little Etsy shop or her own
[1:33:49] little Instagram post of of here is
[1:33:52] darkas that does Deeds charitable for
[1:33:58] all you didn't
[1:34:01] know but notice when she passes
[1:34:04] on and she's sick and she passes on when
[1:34:07] Peter comes in verse 39 when he comes in
[1:34:10] there they're the all those that are
[1:34:13] gathered they're weeping and man they're
[1:34:15] sad Peter has to put them all out but
[1:34:17] what they're actually holding on when
[1:34:19] they when they came up there the Bible
[1:34:20] says at the end of that verse showing
[1:34:22] the coats and garments which Dorcas made
[1:34:26] while she was with
[1:34:28] them it may not have seemed like some
[1:34:31] great spiritual thing but she was moved
[1:34:35] by her heart and the talents that God
[1:34:37] gave her was the ability to make coats
[1:34:40] make garments and she was able to do
[1:34:43] that for the body of Christ and there
[1:34:46] were many people who were warmed because
[1:34:50] of her taking notice Beyond her own
[1:34:56] self that's pretty incredible isn't it
[1:34:59] if this wasn't important I don't reckon
[1:35:00] this would be in the
[1:35:02] Bible if it wasn't important God would
[1:35:05] just you know this s in there but
[1:35:06] sometimes you know what it is we need to
[1:35:08] be
[1:35:09] admonished brother R says it like this
[1:35:11] remember when he talks about little
[1:35:13] Edith right she'd got to a place and how
[1:35:15] that God never did you know heal her of
[1:35:17] intile paralysis but God did relieve her
[1:35:20] pain until you know just like about a
[1:35:22] year year and a half of before she
[1:35:24] passed on but she came into the time of
[1:35:26] menopause brother Brown tells about it
[1:35:28] in the message indictment and he says
[1:35:29] you know he says within that he said
[1:35:32] she's come to such a place he said oh
[1:35:34] she she looks bad she she don't look too
[1:35:36] good he said but listen he said why
[1:35:38] don't I think he said I think it would
[1:35:40] be good if you all would make a trip
[1:35:43] down there maybe even the sister
[1:35:47] Tabernacles oh Lord you mean it's not us
[1:35:50] for no
[1:35:52] more but remember
[1:35:54] friends if our focus is be more let me
[1:35:57] just B brother Nathaniel's church if my
[1:35:59] focus is more on helping out at brother
[1:36:01] Nathaniel's church I've got the wrong
[1:36:04] Focus but I want to be of help if
[1:36:07] there's somebody over there different
[1:36:08] ones I know going through surgery and
[1:36:10] things like that praying for them
[1:36:11] checking on them and things like that
[1:36:12] maybe you know something that maybe
[1:36:13] we're a little closer to or whatever
[1:36:15] more sure we want to be a help if we can
[1:36:17] take a meal to him absolutely we want to
[1:36:19] be a help but notice our focus is right
[1:36:22] here but sometimes Our Lives can get to
[1:36:25] such a place to where it's just like
[1:36:27] we're on oneway
[1:36:32] track I wonder this arms Deeds I wonder
[1:36:36] if that'd kind of be equivalent to like
[1:36:38] when someone's sick and getting meals
[1:36:43] together well brother time that don't
[1:36:45] seem too spiritual well it was reckoned
[1:36:47] to God to to her
[1:36:49] account and a matter of fact when the
[1:36:51] prophet of God stood there and his wife
[1:36:53] had that growth on her on in there in
[1:36:55] her female organs remember what he put
[1:36:57] before God he never said Lord you know
[1:37:00] my wife she reads how many of my message
[1:37:03] books a day she reads x amount of
[1:37:05] chapters Lord she listens to so much
[1:37:08] gospel music he never said one thing
[1:37:10] about that he said Lord she irons my
[1:37:14] clothes for me she cooks my meals when I
[1:37:18] come home and I'm all worked up after a
[1:37:20] meeting she lets me and has my hunting
[1:37:22] clothes ready for me to go hunting he
[1:37:24] says and brother Bram stops and he says
[1:37:26] and you sisters wonder how you can serve
[1:37:30] the Lord how you serve your
[1:37:36] husbands brother Samuel that's not very
[1:37:38] deep well yes it is you see first of all
[1:37:41] is our position in Jesus Christ as a
[1:37:44] spirit filled son and daughter of God is
[1:37:46] that right but as the prophet would lay
[1:37:48] it over and over in the adoption that in
[1:37:50] God's economy there are so many
[1:37:53] positions
[1:37:54] and he said to think in God's economy a
[1:37:57] housewife a preacher a pastor a factory
[1:38:01] worker see God living out himself
[1:38:06] through a positioned son and daughter of
[1:38:08] God in what God has called them to do
[1:38:11] right sometimes I wonder if we don't
[1:38:13] complain too much in where God has us
[1:38:15] instead of saying Lord what would you
[1:38:16] have me do right where I'm at cuz
[1:38:18] there's obviously you don't make no
[1:38:20] mistakes Lord I know I can made them
[1:38:21] I've made many mistakes but what would
[1:38:23] you have me to do right where I'm at
[1:38:27] Lord oh my you love
[1:38:29] him my let me just let me try to get get
[1:38:32] to a point
[1:38:38] here I'm skipping an awful
[1:38:41] lot some of you are
[1:38:45] like some you're probably thinking
[1:38:47] that's a
[1:38:49] help then I'm not trying to be a help
[1:38:51] like that but I want to just I want to
[1:38:54] just bring this to us here in this way
[1:38:58] let me bring this down just within this
[1:38:59] point seasons change in our
[1:39:04] lives I realize that if God
[1:39:07] carries I don't know when but when God
[1:39:10] carries somebody else will be standing
[1:39:12] here somebody else will be the
[1:39:17] pastor I'm not putting in my resignation
[1:39:20] I'm just I'm just saying I realize and
[1:39:23] sometimes I know that it's what's
[1:39:25] difficult sometimes is when seasons and
[1:39:27] chapters of our lives change it's hard
[1:39:30] to see the purpose of God still in our
[1:39:35] lives sometimes that's the hardest thing
[1:39:38] I remember when brother John lefon when
[1:39:40] he stepped away and he retired you know
[1:39:42] Sister um Loretta just couldn't couldn't
[1:39:45] go on and brother John really kept a
[1:39:47] incredible schedule there in
[1:39:49] Arkansas and and for health reasons that
[1:39:52] that part of for her he he they stepped
[1:39:54] aside and you know that was one thing
[1:39:56] that brother John he he did he kind of
[1:39:59] you know it really kind of struggled
[1:40:01] with that part because you're used to
[1:40:02] going and going and going and brother
[1:40:03] John told me he said I love being a
[1:40:05] pastor I love being a pastor I I know
[1:40:09] what he's saying but you know he come to
[1:40:12] a spot where you're used to just you
[1:40:14] know you're kind of like used to that
[1:40:15] lane and that vein and then you think
[1:40:17] what do I do now what do I do now I
[1:40:22] talked a little bit about that to
[1:40:23] brother roel Sorano one time and brother
[1:40:24] roel said man I ain't even thought of
[1:40:27] that he said I didn't think of that I
[1:40:29] know it's not something we sat around
[1:40:31] and want to think but we know it's
[1:40:32] something that sometimes is true that
[1:40:34] seasons can change but what are we going
[1:40:36] to do when seasons change for some of us
[1:40:38] seasons have seasons will change but you
[1:40:40] know what just because seasons change
[1:40:43] does not mean that your purpose has been
[1:40:46] minimized it's not
[1:40:49] minimized there's things that I knew
[1:40:51] that even as my dad and I didn't I kept
[1:40:52] things from my dad I didn't didn't share
[1:40:54] things with him I just took the burden
[1:40:57] um and I just you know I didn't go
[1:40:58] around with the needs and things like
[1:41:00] that but you know what that gift of a
[1:41:02] pastor was still there in his
[1:41:04] life and the years on down the road he
[1:41:07] could just tell me at different times I
[1:41:09] know this and I know that and I know
[1:41:11] that how the gift is there God drops the
[1:41:15] burden and that that gift is there so it
[1:41:17] didn't mean now it didn't mean that he
[1:41:18] had to go and then take over in that
[1:41:20] spot but you know what he did he prayed
[1:41:22] he realized season had changed but it
[1:41:25] was a big help in
[1:41:27] prayer let me read this in
[1:41:30] closing pray this would be a help to you
[1:41:33] this this particular scripture has
[1:41:35] always been a great blessing to my heart
[1:41:38] epais Paul writes of him first of all in
[1:41:41] opening chapter of Colossians refers to
[1:41:44] him as a fellow prisoner in the book of
[1:41:47] Fon also in the book of Philippians he's
[1:41:49] one that took
[1:41:51] supplies to Paul from the Philippian
[1:41:54] from from the colossian uh uh people and
[1:41:58] Philippian people but notice what he
[1:41:59] says epais sometimes you'll read it
[1:42:02] epaphroditus but it's the same person
[1:42:04] who is one of you a servant of Christ
[1:42:07] saluteth you always laboring fervently
[1:42:12] for you in
[1:42:15] prayers now where he was at he wasn't
[1:42:18] preaching
[1:42:19] anymore opening chapter of Colossians he
[1:42:22] was known as a faithful Minister but now
[1:42:26] that part of his life had changed right
[1:42:30] but now where he's at he's laboring as a
[1:42:33] priest in interceding on behalf of the
[1:42:36] people he's seeing that there's a need
[1:42:39] for you know even of maturing but notice
[1:42:42] notice how he takes this in his position
[1:42:45] in being able to do this no doubt he
[1:42:47] could have not have effectively done
[1:42:50] this as great maybe before as right now
[1:42:54] but he's been able to labor he's been
[1:42:56] able to see he's been now he's taking
[1:42:58] into account and he realizes the
[1:43:00] greatest thing that he can do for the
[1:43:02] people of God where he's at right now is
[1:43:05] to pray for him he might be a prisoner
[1:43:08] but it's not going to stop him from
[1:43:10] praying for God's
[1:43:12] people that ye may stand perfect and
[1:43:15] complete in all the will of God for I
[1:43:18] bear him record that he hath a great
[1:43:20] Zeal for you and them that are in ladyo
[1:43:23] IA and them in
[1:43:25] herius think of this what
[1:43:30] about what about our season something
[1:43:33] changes it doesn't stop what that labor
[1:43:36] and that desire is for the body certain
[1:43:40] things
[1:43:41] can can change but may God help us if
[1:43:45] everything out of this that we can pull
[1:43:47] out and there was so many more things
[1:43:49] but God give us Grace to live beyond our
[1:43:52] own Duty
[1:43:54] I want to live beyond I don't you you
[1:43:56] you know it's like when they give you
[1:43:57] the job description when you go to work
[1:43:58] they sit down they hand you the job
[1:44:00] description actually it's way more than
[1:44:03] what's wrote there you can do what's
[1:44:06] right there but really to be effective
[1:44:09] you'll start recognizing it's more than
[1:44:10] that you don't stand on that job
[1:44:11] description say let me see just say uh
[1:44:14] if there is a needle that falls on the
[1:44:15] floor here in the patients room uh you
[1:44:18] do not pick that up you wait for the
[1:44:19] nurse Tech to do that oh you think what
[1:44:23] am is this Union or what I mean you're
[1:44:25] reading on but you realize sometimes you
[1:44:27] know what you see it you pick it up
[1:44:31] right it's like a piece of paper on the
[1:44:33] floor I wait for the janitor to get it
[1:44:35] this is our
[1:44:37] church this isn't the janitor or a
[1:44:39] janitor's church this is our church
[1:44:42] right this is our building that that's
[1:44:44] how we have to look at it the prophet
[1:44:46] said we're to look at it you make it
[1:44:48] your church this is the brownings church
[1:44:52] this is your your
[1:44:54] church if God carries it may not be a
[1:44:57] Browning standing here it's not a
[1:44:59] Browning's church it's God what God
[1:45:02] started the church it's our
[1:45:04] church we each have our part within this
[1:45:08] but it's collectively together right
[1:45:12] right you love him still love me yes yes
[1:45:17] nobody don't pull your tomatoes out
[1:45:19] now but God give us Grace to live beyond
[1:45:22] our own Duty that's what I that's my
[1:45:24] desire that quote when brother B says my
[1:45:27] duty to preach funerals my duty to to
[1:45:28] minister my duty all those things it's
[1:45:30] my duty but God I want to go I want to
[1:45:32] live beyond that help me to see help me
[1:45:34] to be sensitive Lord I'm not we're not
[1:45:37] trying you're not trying to work your
[1:45:39] way into heaven gra Grace of God's
[1:45:41] already been extended to you but you
[1:45:42] know what it is is I want to do
[1:45:44] something even beyond what you've called
[1:45:46] me to do Lord I I want to go I want to
[1:45:49] go be on a me pushing or pulling but
[1:45:51] help me to be sensitive maybe it's like
[1:45:53] Dorcas making you know goat coats and
[1:45:56] and garments maybe it's something in
[1:45:57] that way maybe it's you know being to we
[1:45:59] that when all of a sudden man when
[1:46:01] somebody you're you're aware someone's
[1:46:03] sick maybe you're you're praying for
[1:46:04] them you're sending them a text or maybe
[1:46:06] as coming together when you hear of this
[1:46:08] right here it's coming together to maybe
[1:46:10] to get meals together or you know a gift
[1:46:13] card or whatever more now listen friends
[1:46:15] we all want that kind of a treatment
[1:46:17] when we feel that way is that
[1:46:21] right why we got quiet in here do I need
[1:46:24] to open up the rest of these
[1:46:27] slides but listen this is a part do you
[1:46:30] realize this is a part even when Paul
[1:46:32] stood in one place he told him when they
[1:46:35] brought to Paul in prison heas brought
[1:46:39] him certain things that was needed and
[1:46:42] yet Paul himself was not begging for it
[1:46:45] but Paul writes in the book of
[1:46:46] Philippians he said the reason that I've
[1:46:48] done it is not so much a desire for my
[1:46:52] want or my need to be met but that you
[1:46:55] might fruit might abound in your life
[1:46:59] the need was put out there to see is
[1:47:01] they going to be a response and God
[1:47:03] ministered through the hearts of those
[1:47:06] people you know what they were actually
[1:47:07] doing it was an expression of Christ
[1:47:09] through their life of even the gospel
[1:47:11] that they'd received you say oh brother
[1:47:13] Samuel that ain't very deep James said
[1:47:15] pure religion
[1:47:18] undefiled is to
[1:47:20] visit visit the F the the fatherless
[1:47:24] those and the widows that are widows
[1:47:27] indeed and also to live an undefiled
[1:47:31] life I say God help us live beyond our
[1:47:34] own
[1:47:35] needs help
[1:47:38] us I I know you understand God's not
[1:47:42] trying to tax us that's not that's not
[1:47:45] what this that's not what this this this
[1:47:46] ministry and the words about it's not
[1:47:48] trying to tax us and where we leave out
[1:47:50] of here oh I got to it's not at all just
[1:47:52] just be sensitive to him and say Lord
[1:47:54] help me to be more
[1:47:56] sensitive to my
[1:47:58] surroundings help me to be more
[1:48:00] sensitive to the needs help me to be
[1:48:02] more inclined to that it's a battle in
[1:48:04] this age but you know
[1:48:06] what God has given us what's needed as
[1:48:10] we can stay in his presence to help us
[1:48:11] to be sensitive to minister to the needs
[1:48:14] of one another and let me tell you
[1:48:15] something it's it's unlimited what God
[1:48:19] will do Among Us just in these simple
[1:48:24] expressions of care you say what would
[1:48:27] that do that's love being expressed and
[1:48:29] then you get a people working together
[1:48:31] where the love of God's being expressed
[1:48:33] and it's moving throughout the body you
[1:48:35] know what it does the atmospheres begin
[1:48:37] to break down it's a it's it's that
[1:48:39] which begins to create a place for the
[1:48:41] Holy Spirit the dove of God just to come
[1:48:43] right in and set down right among us and
[1:48:47] continue to work in a greater way you
[1:48:49] don't you love him
[1:48:51] amen and said Simplicity help us Lord
[1:48:54] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[1:48:56] prayer
[1:48:58] father thank you Lord for your mercy
[1:49:00] tonight
[1:49:01] Lord I can certainly Lord with from the
[1:49:05] depths of my
[1:49:07] heart I can say Lord
[1:49:10] I there's more Lord there's
[1:49:15] more Lord
[1:49:17] God help us to be sensitive Lord that we
[1:49:20] can live beyond
[1:49:24] our duty
[1:49:26] Lord I don't want to just Lord is
[1:49:29] serving you as just something Lord that
[1:49:32] where it becomes just doing well that's
[1:49:35] just what I'm supposed to do Lord I
[1:49:39] realize here
[1:49:41] that there's come sometimes Lord I'm not
[1:49:43] to do it too much
[1:49:45] but there's sometimes Lord where maybe
[1:49:48] our song leaders have been out in
[1:49:50] different places
[1:49:53] few different times over the years where
[1:49:55] I've had to come out here and Lead
[1:49:57] songs and then
[1:50:00] preach I don't mind it
[1:50:02] Lord it may not be the most convenient
[1:50:05] thing because of what I have to look at
[1:50:09] to study to reflect over to just
[1:50:11] meditate in them last moments but you
[1:50:13] know Lord you've never failed just I've
[1:50:15] only had to do it a few times I think
[1:50:18] about Lord my good friend brother Nathan
[1:50:20] Bryan he has to do it many times over
[1:50:24] yet he Lord God is a congregation much
[1:50:27] much larger but
[1:50:29] yet a few song
[1:50:32] leaders sometimes Lord with the
[1:50:34] different things and they're in
[1:50:35] different places but that's just one
[1:50:38] small example Lord but you know
[1:50:42] father I think right here in
[1:50:46] this in this little group this Gathering
[1:50:49] that you have brought us together
[1:50:52] never forget Lord when we had
[1:50:55] that that little time was had for sister
[1:51:00] Sharon and her and brother brother
[1:51:02] Joshua Lord is he brought her back here
[1:51:05] Lord to
[1:51:08] home Lord there was so many different
[1:51:12] things that I remember when her dad
[1:51:15] greeted me on the
[1:51:16] phone but the just way would interpret
[1:51:19] between
[1:51:21] us and Lord God God of how that is so
[1:51:25] overwhelmed
[1:51:27] them of the expression of
[1:51:32] love from the
[1:51:34] gifts from Lord God the special times
[1:51:37] that we just had for
[1:51:40] them it overwhelmed
[1:51:43] them her father there's another Minister
[1:51:46] there with them at the time they were
[1:51:47] just so overwhelmed said
[1:51:49] that's that's so opposite of what we've
[1:51:52] heard
[1:51:54] of things about America
[1:51:58] Lord it just speaks Lord in this this
[1:52:01] time we we are Americans that's
[1:52:04] true but oh God before we are Americans
[1:52:08] we're
[1:52:09] Christians that might be the country
[1:52:12] Lord that we're
[1:52:14] from I'm I'm grateful Lord to to live
[1:52:17] here but I'm so thankful this is not my
[1:52:20] home I'm glad it's not my Final
[1:52:23] Destination amen Lord God how we thank
[1:52:26] you Lord for the Constitution all those
[1:52:29] things that men those were men that were
[1:52:31] Lord God
[1:52:33] moved moved upon to where even they
[1:52:36] would set many of them who were the
[1:52:38] original Founders they would have a
[1:52:40] chair at the end of the table for the
[1:52:42] Lord Jesus to be present when they would
[1:52:45] write those things Senators
[1:52:49] congressmen the reason public education
[1:52:51] came about was not to make people
[1:52:54] smart it was the firm belief as they
[1:52:58] would read the McGuffy reader it was
[1:53:00] with the firm belief that if
[1:53:03] men would read in the scriptures and
[1:53:07] Avail them lives being able to be taught
[1:53:09] to read and read the scriptures there'd
[1:53:11] be no need for the police
[1:53:14] force that was the reason for public
[1:53:18] education how far it is Fallen Lord God
[1:53:25] but father I'm
[1:53:27] thankful that we've received the
[1:53:30] spirit from that land of our
[1:53:34] rebirth where Paul would write our
[1:53:39] conversation is from
[1:53:42] above for he shall change our vile
[1:53:48] bodies that conversation that he writes
[1:53:51] there is that constit ution that comes
[1:53:53] from that land
[1:53:55] above
[1:53:57] Lord your Prophet would speak of this
[1:54:00] over and over about how that Brotherly
[1:54:03] Love was
[1:54:05] ceasing how that he said we wouldn't
[1:54:07] even know if the neighbor
[1:54:09] died we wouldn't even know he said used
[1:54:11] to be when somebody got down we'd go
[1:54:13] over and chop wood for
[1:54:15] them he said what's happened it's
[1:54:17] ceasing natural affection is ceasing he
[1:54:21] would say it countless times now Lord it
[1:54:24] wasn't something that the prophet was
[1:54:26] trying to hold some seminar and try to
[1:54:28] make us better people as far as to do
[1:54:31] this and do that but he's letting us
[1:54:34] know you get closer and deeper in the
[1:54:37] love of God don't don't let the things
[1:54:39] and the cares of this world don't let it
[1:54:41] saturate your
[1:54:43] life but in the things that you have to
[1:54:46] do let your life be saturated with the
[1:54:49] love of
[1:54:50] God because Lord character is more than
[1:54:54] a match for the God of this evil age the
[1:54:58] God of this evil age that would exalt
[1:55:00] itself to the throne of worship in man
[1:55:03] but yet the character of Jesus Christ
[1:55:05] coming on full display in a bride body
[1:55:08] that would exalt the Lamb of
[1:55:12] God the one who
[1:55:15] lived Beyond his own
[1:55:19] Duty Lord Jesus
[1:55:24] if in the
[1:55:25] scriptures your Prophet would pick it up
[1:55:28] in that day on
[1:55:29] Calvary and he would tell the church I
[1:55:32] want you to notice one thing he said
[1:55:33] very
[1:55:35] carefully when he as as a Shepherd which
[1:55:40] separate as it were sheep from the goats
[1:55:44] your Prophet told us at that time that
[1:55:45] sheep that spoke out there in Matthew is
[1:55:48] actually the foolish
[1:55:50] virgin but yet
[1:55:53] would live in such a way that he would
[1:55:55] brother BR would bring that down into
[1:55:56] our lives and say I want you to notice
[1:55:59] when the rewards were commended to
[1:56:02] them I was
[1:56:05] hungry and you fed me I was naked and
[1:56:09] you clothed
[1:56:10] me when I was thirsty you gave me a
[1:56:15] drink of
[1:56:16] water and he would call brandom
[1:56:18] Tabernacle to notice
[1:56:20] that how it was something he said that
[1:56:23] was just lived out so automatically
[1:56:27] through their
[1:56:28] lives Lord and see we would read on down
[1:56:32] there in the
[1:56:33] paragraph the very thing that the
[1:56:35] prophet would draw us
[1:56:36] to is our walk with you
[1:56:40] Lord our walk with you I wonder
[1:56:44] sometimes Lord when we stop and evaluate
[1:56:46] on this I wonder if we're really walking
[1:56:48] as deep as we think we're walking
[1:56:52] Lord myself included in that I
[1:56:56] wonder I wonder Lord if we are not just
[1:57:00] so allowing Lord of this world CU it's a
[1:57:03] spirit of this age out here this the
[1:57:05] spirit of this age we see it all
[1:57:08] around it's even come out in expressive
[1:57:13] movements think about it even those that
[1:57:16] would stream this service tonight they
[1:57:17] do it on
[1:57:21] YouTube it's a time lord of
[1:57:25] self self-gratification self men shall
[1:57:29] be lovers of themselves that's the
[1:57:30] spirit of this age
[1:57:33] [Music]
[1:57:35] Lord and I know Lord I'm I'm not
[1:57:37] speaking to Lord God to people of the
[1:57:40] world tonight I'm speaking to my
[1:57:41] brothers and sisters we're not walking
[1:57:44] around and snapping selfies of oursel
[1:57:47] constantly and looking just oh elevating
[1:57:49] oursel but sometimes Lord we just get
[1:57:52] caught in our own little
[1:57:55] world we don't mean to Father you know
[1:57:59] that we don't mean
[1:58:02] to I ask you to forgive us
[1:58:06] Lord forgive us Lord May there come a
[1:58:09] fresh
[1:58:10] anointing Upon Our Lives
[1:58:14] Lord God is it would be prayed in that
[1:58:17] opening
[1:58:20] prayer where Lord God would be said as
[1:58:22] I've read it to him Lord a few Services
[1:58:25] now let us be so Anointed with his
[1:58:29] spirit that we could go to one another
[1:58:32] in the
[1:58:34] deepness of Trials and
[1:58:39] troubles and begin
[1:58:41] to give his
[1:58:45] sympathy to our brothers and sisters as
[1:58:49] he pours it through through our
[1:58:53] lives help us Lord help us you're not
[1:58:57] trying Lord to lay more on us you're not
[1:58:59] trying to change the job description
[1:59:01] that's not at all you're just trying to
[1:59:03] Lord to help us to see a son my daughter
[1:59:07] don't get caught in your own little
[1:59:09] [Music]
[1:59:11] world but just be sensitive just and
[1:59:14] staying in my presence looking to
[1:59:17] me Lord how what would you have me to do
[1:59:20] let me not look even at what you youve
[1:59:22] called me to do is something that's
[1:59:25] insufficient it's what good is this part
[1:59:29] oh that probably won't make no
[1:59:30] difference I wonder if Tabatha didn't
[1:59:33] think that in the scripture wonder if
[1:59:34] she didn't have to battle through
[1:59:38] that but oh God I know that there were
[1:59:40] some who were
[1:59:43] there who were warmed by what she had
[1:59:46] given
[1:59:47] them and you raised her back to life
