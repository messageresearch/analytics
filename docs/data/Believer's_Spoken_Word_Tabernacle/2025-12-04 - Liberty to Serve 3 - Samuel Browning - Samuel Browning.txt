His strength was almost gone, [music] but he shouted as he journeyed, "Delance will come." And palms of victory, [music and singing] crowns of glory, palms [singing] [music] of victory I shall wear. [singing] I saw him in the evening. [music] The sun was sinking low. He'd overcome the mountain and he'd [music and singing] reached the veil below. He saw the golden city is [singing] everlasting home. And he shouted [music] loud, "Hosana, deliverance [singing] will come." And palms [music] of victory, crowns [singing] of glory, palms of victory [music] I shall wear.

[music] I want him to be satisfied with me. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; I want my Lord to be satisfied with me. I want my life [music] to be what [singing] he had to be. And when I come to that great eternity, [music] his smile will say he is satisfied [singing] with me. Well, one glorious [music] day Jesus [singing] came and made me whole. He so completely [music] then satisfied my soul. And as I face life's dark troubles, [music] slow to see. Oh, I want my Lord to be satisfied with me. [music and singing] I want my Lord to be satisfied with me. I want my life to be [music] what it had to be. And when I come to my [music] great eternity, his smile was saved. [music] He is satisfied with me. Church is satisfied with God's great redemption plan. I'm satisfied in sufficient for all man. [music] I'm satisfied with his work on Calvary.

And when I come to that great eternity, his smile [music] will say he satisfied me. Oh yes, Lord. Lord, give me strength. Give me courage. Make me bold. That I might be some [music] lost sheep unto the Lord. That I might stand not afraid of [music] [singing] thee. I want my Lord to be [music] satisfied with me. Well, I want my Lord to be satisfied with me. I [music] want my love to be what he have in me. Well, as I come to that great eternity, his smile will say, I want to say that second verse again. Satisfied. I'm satisfied with God's great redemption [music] plan. I'm satisfied and sufficient for this man. I'm satisfied with his work on Calvary. But is my Lord fully satisfied [music and singing] with me? I want my love to be satisfied with me. I want my life. And when I come to that great eternity, Lord, no smile will [music] say he's satisfied [singing] with me. And when I come to my great eternity, [music] his smile will say he's satisfied with me.

Praise the Lord. Amen. Remember that song? I want to know how it feels. I want to know a little higher. Well, my mama and daddy [singing] talked about going home since I was just a babe on their knees. They said nothing [singing and music] compared to what is waiting up there. One day we would [music and singing] finally be free. I've never seen it, but I keep on believing it'll be a place like I've never known. I got my [music and singing] eyes on the sky. My soul wants to fly, Lord. My heart is [music] ready to go. I want to know how it feels. Hallelujah. To make my way down the streets of gold. I want to know how it feels [music] to have a talk with the saints of old. I want to know what it's like. [music] to make my feet by the rivers [singing] of life. I've heard of heaven and I know that it's real. I want to know how it feels. See if I can remember it. Sometimes I [music] get weary [singing] from this life that I live. Seems like peace is something I'll never [music and singing] find. I try to lighten my load when all that I've got to show is 700 [music] things on my mind. Oh, but I'm seeing visions of a [music] crystal clear river where sin is vanished without a trace. Oh, more than I've [music] ever dreamed. My soul wants to see the look of love [music] on my Savior's face. I want to know how it feels. [music] to make my way down the streets of gold. I want to know how it feels [music] to my talk with the saints of gold. I want to know what it's like to rest my feet by the rivers [music] of life. I've heard of heaven and I know that it's real. I want to know how it feels one more time. I want to know how [music] it feels to make my way [singing] down those streets of gold. I want to [music] know how it feels to have a talk with the saints [singing] of old. I want to know what it's like to rest my feet by the rivers of life. I've heard [music and singing] heaven and I know that it's real. I want to know how it feels. I've heard heaven and I know that it's real. I want to know how it feels. [music] Hallelujah. Maybe try and restart. It's uh it's sing for memory night. God bless y'all. I hope everybody's got a good memory. I want to sing that. Let's sing that. Remember that song. Cleanse me, oh Lord. Cleanse me, [singing] oh Lord, my heart within. Amen. Try to remember this one. Cleanse me, oh Lord, [singing] and know my heart within. Try me, oh Savior. [singing] Make make me pure within. [singing] I know that verse says, "Thy word de declares, [singing] thou wil provide our need." Thou will provide our need. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's sing that little song. In moments like these, hopefully we can get the words back. In moments [singing] like these, I sing out a song. &gt;&gt; I sing out &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; A love song. [music] Amen. To [singing] Jesus. Our pastor comes. Jesus in moments [music] my peace. Amen. I lift [singing] up. [music] &gt;&gt; How many loves times like this with the Lord?

You [music] are out [singing] of you. Sing it again. In moments like [music] these, as our pastor comes and sing, in moments [singing] like these, I sing [singing] out [music] a song. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I sing out a love song [music] to Jesus [singing] in moments like oh I lift [singing] up my hands [music] I lift up [singing] my hands to the Lord. [singing and music] Oh, singing [music] I love [singing] you. Oh, I love you, Lord. [music] Sing I love [singing] you, Lord. [singing and music] Singing my love you. [music] Let's just do that little chorus. Something keeps holding me. Something keeps when the same comes. Something keeps holding me [music] every [singing] day.

Something keeps hold of me. Oh, [music and singing] something keeps holding me [singing] every [music] day. I see.

Oh, [singing and music] he's a real Yes, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus keeps holding [singing] me. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; thank you, Lord. Amen. Let's just go to him in a word of prayer tonight. Heavenly Father, how precious Lord, the songs of Zion, how precious, Lord, your presence &gt;&gt; just coming among us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord God, truly as you have said in your word, we find it Lord over and over to be the truth. You dwell in the praises of your people, &gt;&gt; oh God. Our our praise and our worship, Lord, is not limited, Lord, to an instrument, our favorite song or even how we feel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But Lord, it's based on the liberty &gt;&gt; that we know, Lord, from the depths of our soul. &gt;&gt; That we are no longer the same people that we once [music] were. Amen. &gt;&gt; We see Lord our name written in the Lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; There's a worship that rises from the depths of our soul. Lord God, while we are here, even in these temporary booths, these dwelling places, these mortal bodies, but Lord God, how we are so thankful, Lord, for the liberty that has come &gt;&gt; into our lives, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord Jesus, we so appreciate you, Father. Amen. &gt;&gt; That in itself, Lord God, we could never never praise you enough. [music] I'm so glad that we'll have eternity to do that. There's so much that you have done for us. But Lord Jesus, the greatest thing is when you not only you came, but Lord, you made that deposit in our lives. Oh my, I'm so thankful Lord, so grateful Lord for your leadership in our lives. how you would guide us, Lord, from day to day and moment to moment, Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, even in the correction, Lord, even in the strength that you would give us through the tests and trials that you permit to come our way. &gt;&gt; We thank you for your mercies, Lord. Lord, there's many requests, many things that Lord, you see that came on the thread for prayer here throughout today. Many different needs, [music] Lord. those that Lord in need of of comfort, Lord. And I pray for brother Brian's family that you would just comfort them, Lord. I pray &gt;&gt; comfort them, Lord Jesus, with your presence, Lord. Be with our brother, his family, Lord. I pray, dear God, that for the different needs, Lord, different different ones battling, Lord, with sickness and things. And we know that Lord, it it makes its way around at certain times of the year. But it's only, Lord, a reminder that we've not arrived home yet. Father, we're on our way. So Lord Jesus, was you've provided for us what we have need of along the way. That you promised that you would, Lord Jesus, minister [music] to the infirmities in our bodies. You would heal us as you said in your word. You would lift the sicknesses, Lord. So we ask God for each need and every request here tonight. Be with those Lord that may be just dear God in our mind or spirit just weary and just in need of Lord just encouragement from your presence tonight. Lord Jesus, I pray that you would just pass by each one of our hearts tonight, Lord. And may you so minister in such a way, Lord, that would encourage us, Lord, in our walk with you. We pray we love you and we thank you now Lord in Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. Thank you. Amen. Amen. Let's look here in the word here in Galatians 5 and want to move right back into this and say it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and good to be together and certainly want to remember one another in prayer and I know different ones of battling sickness and different things in their body and but we just look to the Lord to minister to them in a special way. In Galatians chap in Galatians chapter 5 verse3 says for brethren ye have been called unto liberty only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh. Now Paul would have never wrote this if there wasn't a possibility for this to be that whole phrase an occasion to the flesh it is actually selfishness and I know we all would like to think that we still don't have selfishness but yet there's a lot of self about us and that's one thing that where the new birth has come the new birth actually breaks that hold and that power from within and then through that constantly in our lives where the spirit of God will not do this for us. But we have to surrender to him. &gt;&gt; So there's certain things that you and I, we couldn't clean our lives up. We could not perfect our soul. That was not something that we could ever do. But God now through and by the new birth entrust you and I to actually take by the spirit of God and an awareness and actually bring our lives into subjection submitting ourselves over and over to the word of God. Is it something that's easy? No. If it if it right there in the garden of Gethsemane when the Lord Jesus he prayed three times. And I want you to think about how God so condescended to allow himself to experience the things that you and I would experience. When he would experience the cost of obedience, it wasn't that he had within him some sort of a disobedience such as what would still be in our carnal nature. He didn't have that. But yet the flesh made in the likeness of sinful flesh. There was a cost in obedience. It was a cost for everything that when he would stand for the word, he knew the ridicule. He knew the misunderstandings. He knew the reproach. He knew that. And even when it came to uh in every in every part of his life, but he was willing to do that. And it was a constant constant submission. And you know, you think of that until the day that we are raptured out of here, it will be a continual submission moment by moment by moment. But aren't you glad that God has given you the grace? &gt;&gt; I am. Not only to be able to do it, but to even to recognize it and to be able to see that. So notice how the last part of that verse, but by love serve or do service to one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one another. So there's that's a possibility there as well too. This I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would. But if you be led of the spirit, ye are not under the law. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to continue to by the grace of God to try to finish this point on a liberty to serve. A liberty to serve. And I want to just take of those maybe just three questions to kind of look at here even this evening. What does it mean to serve? How do I serve? And what is the motivation of the serving? You know, brother Bram talks throughout the message. There's many different places where he deals with how that the love would actually be a very hard thing or very scarce thing to find. And he would say it in one way. He said, "It's too bad that we lost that kind of love one for another." And what he goes in to talk about is how that Mary actually ran to Elizabeth after she had her visitation. And then Elizabeth, they met one another and there was such a joy. There was such a, you know, a a fellowship. And brother Brandham would go on and I think now this is these are statements brother Brandham is making clear back in the late 50s and 60s where he says we're at a place right now he said we won't even know if the neighbor dies unless we read about it in the newspaper. &gt;&gt; Now we realize that the spirit of God is not telling us to you know stick our nose in everybody's business. &gt;&gt; That's not at all because Paul calls out busy bodies. &gt;&gt; You know he he deals with that. But that there's a there's a great difference in this that where that there is a care and we we're living in a time in an hour. We're not helpless. We're not defeated. But we're living in a time because of the age, the anointing upon this age, remember, is the anointing of people's rights. &gt;&gt; So it's all about self. This is why we see a lot of the things come about as they do. And it is a spirit that we have to continue to battle against. It's a spirit so easily that even in a workplace you have to be very careful. You can get caught up so much within that and it would actually vex your spirit to a time you have to be careful because in the people and everyone else the anointing is there and it can move upon even upon your spirit in those ways and we need to be very very mindful and ask the Lord to help us within these things because it can it's such an age of such selfishness and yet it is an age where God has chosen to rapture his bride and to where that his bride would come to the absolute place to be capped in rapturing grace. And it's really quite it's really quite a marvel that you we would look at the conditions of the age, but yet it's not the conditions of the age that remember drives the bride to Christ. It's not the conditions of the age that actually make us more godly, but it is actually God fulfilling his word and in the presence of the word being revealed. That's what has the effect upon our life because what go everything that God is asking of us, God does not want us to do anything out of a duty to where it's just well I I have to do this and I must do this. And yet there's some things that God will ask us ask of us and we'll begin to see in his word that you know it it will feel as though that we're just maybe going through the motions when we give ourselves to the Lord. But yet, in order to give ourselves to the Lord, it starts with our hearts. And there's certain things that you know, let me just put it to you like this. If there's a time that you have somehow gotten away from maybe holding your wife's hand or something like that and you know now nowadays I know how the cars are made to where everything a console down the middle and man probably we brothers we like that console and sisters like it if they can had hide their little things down the middle of the console you know and all those neat little things but yet you know to start start little things like that you know back over sometimes it feels a little bit strange or a little bit odd. But yet you find that with obedience itself, obedience, many times we have to go beyond our feelings. And then from the inside, this is where then feelings will actually come and God will supply those feelings. And I say that because there's many things that we can do. And yet it'll be like if we if we don't if things are not done from that of really divine love, it's not even attributed to our account. It'd be like after every payday you were taking out $100 and you were having $100 go to this sub account, $50 go to this sub account, $25 go into this sub account, and you just, you know, had that automatically with your automatic deposit. And then when it when it came time at the end, let's say a year down the road, you were expecting, well, if I had $100 a month, it'd be 1,200 at the end of the road. If it was $50 a month, you know, well, that'd be 600 at the end of the year, and so forth. And yet when you get then to the end of the year, what you find is on the statements 0000. And I tell you, you probably would be like, "Hey, something's going on with the accounting right here." But you realize that Paul writes of this in 1 Corinthians 13 and he says, "Though I give my body to be burned." you know, all of the service that could be done in all of the service I could that could be done even when he deals with uh you know, speaking in tongues and all those things if it is not with that of charity, it that rings up as zero in the account. &gt;&gt; So God doesn't want us to do things just because it's the right thing to do, &gt;&gt; but he wants to really that our hearts would be moved by divine love. And this is why when brother Brandon would say it like this, he says, "Love is so hard to find." The Bible said there'd come a time when there wouldn't even be love for one another. Father would be against mother, mother against father, and children against parents and so forth. And the only love would be left would just be between the elect. And that's about right. Love is a scarce thing today. And you find you realize that even when love itself is so hard to find because the love that the prophet is talking about is not the love that would just be upon in our human spirit because there is the gate of affection that is there. When we realize that from agape love, it's that stream. It's a stream of love that comes all the way on down until it gets even to the very bottom where it's really it's perverse love. But yet within it, we recognize that this love that we're speaking of that's so hard to find. It's hard to find because it is indeed rare. It is the Holy Spirit that is actually shed abroad in the hearts of God's people. And you can actually see it. You sense it where the love of God is absolutely lifting from the earth. You see it sometimes in meetings. You see it in services. You know, one times where we would see the throngs of things. And yet we find in this time we're living in where the love of God is absolutely lifting from the earth. The Bible says that men would be in this day without natural affection. &gt;&gt; The those very things would be so removed. There's a lot of a lot of factors and things that come into that. But yet with within it when we look at it, you remember brother Brandham was asked a question in 1964. Brother Bram, he says, 'Why is it so hard to pray right now? And brother Bram says the reason he says you find it so hard to pray, he says, is because the revival is over. He says it's not easy to do or to pray as you used to be able to. So we find that even through that pressure because you know a lot of times we look back at things and you find things you know you find you know people as they sometimes they get older they want to go back and live you know back days when they were you know 20 or 25 or whatever more and want to go back and reminisce about a lot of things and yet we also realize that there's things as God moves within the seasons of his word and of times is that sometimes where a person can actually be trying to get back to a place that God has already moved on from and God just and and it actually becomes not a place of destiny. It actually becomes a mirage. It becomes something they're looking at doing and they're or getting back to, man, we're going to get back to this. And yet God has already there's been an advancement and it never advances beyond the word, but God moves through his word and he's all it's always a constant moving and working within the lives of the people. And so God always sets a clear expectation and when in our lives and so when we look at this with a real liberty to serve when our hearts have been really set at liberty then the ways and what we would actually do would would be from that of love or should be from love you know and sometimes a person can do something and maybe they feel like that they're doing it from love and if you ask them why did you do that well I do it because it how how it makes me feel That's not this love. It's not about how it makes you feel. That that's not what this love is about. Because this love is the divine love of God. It's a love that is not about what we do as for our betterment. That if I do this then others are going to think well of me. They'll think good of me. Or if I do this then maybe my wife or my husband will pay me patronage. If I do this then you know the brother or the sister. If I and and that becomes it becomes a very selfish thing or reason that we're doing that and yet and yet there's an element that we have to understand that love is also a part to be reciprocated. How could you and I love the Lord Jesus with the right kind of love if he didn't express his love to you and I? There's no way we could we could never love to the degree that he calls for unless he himself would have expressed his love to you and I. And that is what's captured our hearts. But thanks thanks be to God that through that it's not our love that we're loving him with. And what love are we loving him with? We're loving him with his love. And that's exactly what it is. It's the Holy Spirit, divine love that's been deposited in our heart. And that continues to work in our life to mold us to melt down all of our self-will and all of these things. So notice how Paul would write this on this in this with Hebrews 6. For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister. &gt;&gt; I want you to notice how this is wrote here. God's not unrighteous. Nobody else may not see this, which it really doesn't matter if anybody else sees it or knows it. &gt;&gt; It's that God sees it. God knows it. And to whatever degree and however that this this right here, we could spend a whole month on this because all of the variegated ways that this would actually be that would actually come through the body in so many different ways. And you know what? Many of the things that we look at right here, even in looking at this, there is even a portion of this that when you look at it that as far as would it be anything spiritual, many of these things even in this right here, it would not even be deemed to be spiritual at all. But yet it's taking notice of the body that's around us. Now I know many many times we look at things and we think about oh my the depth of the word and the mysteries and so forth. But if that doesn't have any outworking in our lives, I'm afraid something's wrong somewhere. God did not want to just deposit divine, you know, understanding and mysteries and all of these things that we would walk around and oh well, we're always available to sit down and debate or discuss and that's not what that's not what we need. The body needs ministered to. &gt;&gt; If you'll notice the Lord Jesus, he never even occupied himself very very minute times of even and I won't even say debating because the prophet said that's not even the Christian spirit. He did not even do that in that way. As a matter of fact, there might be a question, might be something that would pause. But what you find a lot of times, the Lord Jesus would absolutely be able to remove himself from that situation. Why? He knew it wasn't going to it wasn't going to do any good anyhow. So when we see this within it, yet the Lord Jesus, if he would have come here, I want you to think about this. His one purpose in order to come here was for redemption. and he did fulfill that of lifting our burdens that of uh ministering to the sick. But if he would have just come here and it would have been simply just to come here and then at the appointed time go to Calvary and nothing else that would have been that wouldn't have taken much to write about. &gt;&gt; It wouldn't have taken much. But yet what we find all the way through the gospels is over and over through the gospels and then you find it through the book of acts. You find it through Paul admonishing in Hebrews, Galatians, all the letters. You find a life that was lived in the express where God himself came down and became a servant unto all men. Yes, I did. &gt;&gt; We have in we have countless records of even different ones that he served their needs and we have no record. Do not know did they even serve him. &gt;&gt; Different ones that he healed. &gt;&gt; You have different ones even in brother Brandham's meetings didn't go on and SERVE HIM. BUT YET GOD came down &gt;&gt; and touched him. &gt;&gt; You know why? &gt;&gt; Cuz God loves humanity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you how much God loves humanity. God loves humanity so much and wanted humanity to be well that he knew that there would be a many of humanity that would not even believe in divine healing. So God provided doctors. &gt;&gt; You talking about love? You talking about he could have drawn a line in the sand and said if you don't believe in divine healing then you just suffer. but God's love for humanity because it wasn't men's ingenuity that tapped into different things. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, why would brother Brandham say over and over when it came to even the polio vaccine, you know, brother Brandon prayed about that, had the church praying about that? Brother Brandham was ecstatic when they came along with that &gt;&gt; because many of those things had wiped out. There's places even in Sunduski right down there on the bay. You'd actually have to go to a certain destination and they've got the pillar rays from where that of the black plague had went through there and wipe people out in that area &gt;&gt; where we used to where my family used to live. But think how brother Brown would say over and over. He said, "Every day I pray that they would have a cure for cancer &gt;&gt; now." And what didn't brother Bon say? I pray every day that everybody would come into my meetings. &gt;&gt; It was a love for humanity. &gt;&gt; Do you realize even as I've I've been around, you know, some of my my best friends are right there within Jeffersonville and and things and and different brothers and all of the different uh you know testimonies and things that you hear and you see even of the man who testifies about the bridge &gt;&gt; there. His last name is Vissing. He's a lawyer. He was actually served as mayor in Jeffersonville. Voice of God put him on an interview. You can pick it up on YouTube. And he goes into explaining why certain records were not kept upon that of men dying when the bridge was being built. And even to even when you watch watch and hear the things that he says and then you hear among other people, you know, brother B was loved by the Catholics. &gt;&gt; They loved him in Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; They loved him. Not because he went along with their doctrine, but the things that you hear testimonies about brother Brandham is how brother Brandham himself would actually when he would go and he would kill the animals bear and different things like that, he would actually come around and hand it to people that he knew were in need and they didn't even go to the Brandom Tabernacle. &gt;&gt; You see, it's service, friends. &gt;&gt; Now, we're not talking about going out here. I'm not I don't want I'm not talking about going out here and standing with a red tripod and dingling lingaling, you know, and waiting, you know, drop in your pennies and drop in you better drop them in pennies and things and and nickels and so forth. That's not what we're talking about. Brother Brandham made such a difference here by the spirit of God between religion and salvation. He said religion, he said many will take on religion and they'll feed the poor. He said any goodnatured human being would do that. But salvation is a real experience with God. And it's something that when you can recognize and you just dwell on it and it becomes more and more real in our lives of what God so subjected himself in order to bring this liberty to you and I of what of to what degree and what he continues to do in ministering to the needs in our life. God God never just saved us and put us on autopilot. But over and over through the admonishing of the word, he admonishes us. He doesn't make us, but he reveals himself and then you and I as yielding and then submitting and then subjecting and you know just emptying ourselves and saying Lord just let that be in my life. And so here when we see this your work and labor of love which you minister toward his name. So the expression of that work and labor of love in that you have ministered to the saints and do minister. Watch out, brother Brandon. He picks this up in questions and answers. He says, "Now, we're all going to make mistakes. Just remember, when you're looking at one another, don't look at the other person's mistake. &gt;&gt; Don't do that." Because remember, you make mistakes, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. But look to Christ who is guiding this person. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Bra, I don't even think, brother Samuel, I don't even think they have the Holy Ghost. Remember the Holy Ghost, justification, that's a part of the Holy Ghost. Sanctification, more of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost is more of the same that's been working all along. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. The worst thing that we could ever do is sit around and criticize one another. &gt;&gt; The worst thing to be able to do is to sit around and be able to pick apart and well, if this one or I don't see this in the church, I don't see this and I don't see that. You need to get your eyes in the right place &gt;&gt; because to understand, you know, I'll just be honest with you friends. I I don't like I don't like criticism. I don't like complaining. But yet I realize there's a part of it that I have to be able to kind of to deal with and things. I BECAUSE THERE'S AN ATMOSPHERE that it creates. I I don't want to be around that because I KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT of God. &gt;&gt; God does not anoint us to pick one another apart. &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, PART OF THAT BITING and devouring one another, it don't necessarily mean that we're biting their nose off, BITING THEIR HEAD OFF. YOU CAN BITE and devour one another behind their back &gt;&gt; where you can talk and say, "Well, what? I don't understand. WHY IS THIS AND WHY'S THAT?" THIS IS WHERE IT comes into praying for one another. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let me finish the quote. Brother Bram says, "If they need some help, then you pray for them." &gt;&gt; That's the way we get along. Pray. WHEN YOU ARE PRAYING for somebody else in that kind of a fix, what kind of fix he talking about? a mistake that we can see. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; When you're praying for somebody else who's in that kind of a fix, God will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else. &gt;&gt; So, you mean that God would allow me to see somebody else's mistake? Yeah. And he's also wanting to test &gt;&gt; I wonder where the maturity is at. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with that, Samuel? Are you going to are you going to talk about them? Are you going to act as though that you are better? You know more? Are you going to forget where I brought you from? ARE YOU GOING TO FORGET EVERYTHING THAT I LOOKED OVER in your life? What what what are we going to do? Or are we going to remember and look at that we make mistakes too. &gt;&gt; That includes every one of us. &gt;&gt; That's right. And now within this of praying, when they get in that kind of fix, but if we go to entering in and praying for them, God, as the prophet said, will honor and heal you when you're praying for somebody else. &gt;&gt; You know what that takes? That takes service. &gt;&gt; Because what it is, it takes us to go beyond that LITTLE BIT BECAUSE PRIDE IS STILL within us, friends. And I'm not When the Holy Spirit has come, it's delivered from our soul. But it's always that tendency. And sometimes depending on how we're made up, some might have a greater tendency to where everything all they can look at is they'll look at things and they'll say, "Yep, this one's got the part. Yep. Exactly. This is applied. Tokens applied. I've learned long ago. This may be all right on the outside. That don't mean the tokens applied. Many, many years ago, I learned that that has nothing to do to say that a person has already made the mark." Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; But you can take God can start on the inside of a person and when the work that God does in that person, you watch things start to fall off on the outside. That's why the prophet SAID WHEN NEW LIFE has come in, you don't have to pluck the old leaves off. They will fall off. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; But to know that within this it requires a service. Now how would I serve? Now, this is something that for me or you, it would not be something that would us maybe be going physically to THAT PERSON, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT GOD ALLOWS us to be able to see. Maybe it's something you hear about. AND HOW ARE YOU GOING to respond to that? It's I believe the greatest response we can do is to take it to God in prayer. DO YOU REALIZE THE THINGS THAT GOD ALLOWS US TO SEE? God allows us, permits us to see THESE THINGS, NOT TO talk about them, but to go in prayer. Because remember we are priests and priests are to surrender their lives as the prophet said spending our lives interceding and petitioning on thy behalf of one another. Notice brother Ram says that's what Christianity is based upon to help one another do for one another be kind to one another understanding to one another. Now, if you see your neighbor's mistake, you see where they went wrong, don't go wrong with them, but just pray for them. Just keep praying and God will understand that he'll make everything right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch how the Lord Jesus himself when you consider this of how that in the in the midst of divine love and where he was within his life. Here's some of the very last moments of his life. Many many miracles had taken place within his ministry walking on the water. We've seen devils cast out. We've seen all so many so many powerful things. But the last closing moments of his ministry, what we find is where he rose from supper and he girded himself with a towel. &gt;&gt; And this is I always love this scripture, this verse right here. It's so powerful. JESUS KNOWING THAT THE FATHER had given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God. HE RISETH FROM SUPPER and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. THIS IS WHAT MATURITY did in HIS LIFE. &gt;&gt; IT BROUGHT TO THAT APEX OF SERVICE where even Peter WAS AT THE POINT, NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WASH ME. NOT YOU, LORD. NOT NOT YOU. I I DON'T WANT YOU TO STOOP TO THIS LEVEL. BECAUSE NOT ONLY HAD HE STOOPED TO BECOME A HUMAN, &gt;&gt; but he had stooped day after day humbling himself. &gt;&gt; And he took on the lowest job that could be &gt;&gt; a foot wash flunky. &gt;&gt; And you know what? That in itself still was not to the lowest that he would go. He would go to Calvary &gt;&gt; for you and I. That's right. &gt;&gt; HE WENT FOR YOU AND I. IT WAS NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BENEFIT, BUT IT WAS FOR OUR BENEFIT. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAID HE WENT FOR THE JOY THAT WAS SET BEFORE HIM. WHAT JOY [screaming] IS THAT? HE SAW YOU AND ME SITTING HERE FREE AND IN LIBERTY TONIGHT. HE SAW US HEALED. HE SAW US DELIVERED. AND HE WENT FOR YOUR [screaming] JOY. OUR JOY. HE WENT FOR THAT REASON. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It was not about himself. &gt;&gt; It was about his body, &gt;&gt; his bride. Now, what a what a revelation of maturity. You see what maturity does when we talk about maturity? Maturity doesn't mean that we know more quotes than we used to know. Maturity doesn't mean that we can explain, oh, I can explain this doctrine. That's not maturity. But then those are a lot of things that people you can have knowledge uh and you listen I'm not saying that you shouldn't give yourself to know the word but remember maturity is about conduct &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and behavior maturity is where with this molding and shaping of character through the yielding and and it's not something that is microwavable it's not something that's instant. not something that we can, you know, just type into chat GPT and say create an image on this and it'll it don't happen that way. But yet it's over throughout a lifetime. There's things that I realize right now as I stand here as 50 years old. I realize there's certain things even right now and I thought, Lord, I wish I would have seen this. And I'm talking about within me this certain victories and all these different victories and things that I've seen. And I was telling my wife the other day, I said there's certain things I said when I was fellowshipping with the brother. I got done ministering at one of the men's meetings and there's certain things I was fellowshipping about and my I just thought my how this is it's been something to me but just been so liberating. And I said little did I know I said it's just something that just continues to move in greater folds and folds and it goes deeper and deeper. And you know WHAT IT IS? IT'S actually showing up right here. It's showing up the weakness. IT'S SHOWING UP then the weakness and the hindrance. And actually what God wants is he's not going to strip THE WEAKNESS OUT, BUT GOD HAS A WAY TO BRING US into these places. And he absolutely helps us to see it. And I think not only does he help us to see it, but I'm so grateful he gives us the grace to yield our lives to him and say, "Yes, Lord. Your word is right, Lord. God, help me, Lord. Give me grace, Lord. Let it come forth, Lord, in my life. Let it be molded in my life. But yet, I realize that even of things that I know right now at 50 years old. These are things through experiences that you have to come through. And nobody could come through these experiences for me. Nobody could pass I couldn't pass through those things. you know, to think about who wouldn't want I mean, who wouldn't have wanted to wear experiences and molding and things that you've learned and so forth. Who wouldn't have wanted it, man, when I was 22 years old? I mean, who wouldn't have wanted 23 years ago when I started pastoring here? My goodness, with things that my I wish I would have I wish I would have known then, things that I know now. But it's all part of a journey, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; And that's not just with pastoring. That's the same way it is within your life. And you know what? It's never in a place to where you don't feel like well you don't it's not like you don't feel like you don't know anything or you feel like as though that well I I don't know but but you know God lets you and gives you grace and a confidence for the moment that you're in. So there then in your life as things God continues to mold and and to shape us and how that the word itself just molding and shaping our character because remember the biggest enemy we've got is ourselves. And so that has the molding and the shaping is going on within our lives. There's a great victory that's actually coming forth within our lives. And it's something that through this victory that we look at it that we couldn't just have passed through or just man jumped right over to this but it had to come through these places in order to absolutely die to oursel and where the Lord Jesus is standing some of the closing moments and this right here where he actually has such an understanding I've come from God going back to God and knowing knowing these things what a confidence it brought but how the confidence displayed itself self. &gt;&gt; It's always been so powerful to me when I read that in the scripture because he knowing you know many times a person if they feel like they know something then they feel like they can they know something more than somebody else and can subjugate this person or this or that. But that's not that's not of God. That's not what this maturity is. But this maturity it brought it even to a greater degree of looking out upon the needs of others. Now watch how this would come forth in Paul's own life and through the ministry. In Philippians chapter 1, Paul said, "I'm in straight betw twix to having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better. Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you. And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith that your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Who was this about? If Paul got what he wanted, he wanted to go ahead and go on. &gt;&gt; You remember when brother Brandham when he actually said, "Lord, I want to go ahead and go on. And the Lord spoke back to him and said, "Are you trying to bypass your trials?" &gt;&gt; And he asked, he told the Lord, he said, "Forgive me, Lord." Watch how Paul then would take this. What an example that would be laid. And he would say to us and to the sons of God there, do all things without murmurings and disputings. Now, murmurings and disputings are not necessarily anything that's done out loud. Yeah, &gt;&gt; a person can do something and yet inwardly they're grumbling about it. &gt;&gt; That's what this is. Grumbling, showing disavow or or dislike to it. They'll do it. But you see in doing it, remember that whole part about deposit &gt;&gt; even if we do the right things. But if this is not right down here within it, it still does not register &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; as being deposited. &gt;&gt; We serve by love. Now why? that you might be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I may not run in vain neither labored in vain. Yay. And if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all for the same cause also you do joy and rejoice with me. Now if Paul is writing this by the spirit of God and if he inwardly is murmuring and complaining on why he has to preach certain things, deal with people, he's a hypocrite. But what Paul is pointing out right here of even of times if we can look at it and see it friends that these Paul, Peter, brother Brandham on and on were not men who like you and I would even be somehow exempt from having sometimes feelings of why this sometimes we can look at things and think well that's so elementary. But yet remember the prophet he had that in his ministry WHERE PEOPLE SAID WHY DON'T YOU TEACH THEM HOW TO RECEIVE SPIRITUAL GIFTS. BROTHER BRAM SAID, "HOW CAN I DO THAT WHEN THEY WON'T EVEN DO their ABCs?" &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes how the enemy wants to just point out as, "Oh, these are little just minuscule things. These are men and but I'm but once again, if the word cannot be expressed in our life, the Bible, the the the message title, I love this. THE MESSAGE TITLE IS NOT GOD HIDING in simplicity." That's not the full title, &gt;&gt; right? The Bible says he hides in simplicity and then reveals himself &gt;&gt; in the same. &gt;&gt; So God just doesn't deposit. It's not just a deposit, but yet it's alive to be expressed. Sure, how we appreciate the doctrines. We appreciate the truth of the word. That's the bark on the tree. We so appreciate that. But remember, the bark is not the only thing because if you have the bark without the life, pretty soon the bark will start falling apart. Notice how Paul would go on and write this. What an example. He said, "Now therefore we that not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy, for by faith ye stand." If there's one thing, if I can just be known to be a helper of somebody's joy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that how that's what you want to know? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be that. Don't you? &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO BE I'LL TELL YOU WHAT THERE, BROTHER SAMUEL, I TELL YOU, HE'S THE greatest discourager. HE JUST KNOWS HOW TO CUT YOU DOWN TO THE FLOOR. HE JUST KNOWS friends listen you got to understand we see you can see needs you can see situations and sometimes depending on like I said sometimes individuals personalities can be and it can be this is where that they cannot use or they could but not use an occasion to the flesh to just simply say pow and get straight to the point instead of encourage somebody along the way &gt;&gt; encourage them along the way help them along the way be helpers of their joy boy BE ENCOURAGING THEM EVEN in the small things LIKE FOR EXAMPLE YOU SEE A BROTHER OR SISTER SEE SOMEBODY YOU AIN'T SEEN THEM IN WEEKS maybe months and they come in THE CHURCH DOOR GREET THEM &gt;&gt; TELL THEM HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO SEE THEM &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T YOU DON'T LOOK AT THEM AND SAY MAN WHERE IN THE WORLD HAVE YOU BEEN my lord where have YOU BEEN YOU KNOW BROTHERHAM SAID IF YOU GOT THE LOVE OF GOD THAT'S NOT THE PROPER PLACE. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, THIS IS WHERE, FRIENDS, WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WHAT WE'RE GIVING OUT IS NOT FRUSTRATION handling scriptures &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THAT EQUATES to no deposit. &gt;&gt; We're to be helpers &gt;&gt; of their joy. Notice how Paul would say, "For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake." I don't mind telling you there's certain times of things of how that when I would go and begin to minister on certain times. Sometimes it's happened even in meetings where I've had things and it's helpful that I found times where brother Brandham has talked about it, you know, as well. But you know, you you find it sometimes you feel so so you you feel like my goodness, what I'm getting ready to speak on is so and the devil said, "Yeah, that's so simple. That's just it's so I mean it's so minute." You say, "How do you know it's a devil?" I I listen I watch it and I'm watching and I'm looking and how the way things are GOING AND I FIND BROTHER Brandham over in Blind Barnameus. He said, "The devil like to wore me out all day long and told me &gt;&gt; what the people were going to think." Cuz you see, here's what it is. how the devil will spin it. The people are going to think this. The people, oh, WE'RE WE'RE BEYOND THIS. BUT FRIENDS, there's a lot of times that there's things when I can when we look at it that I'm just going to I'm just going to say it like this. If this if this is the product of understanding deep mysteries, where there's more division than there ever has been, when there's more backbiting, when there's more looking down on one another, I don't believe that's a product of divine revelation. I can believe that that's a product of a lot of head knowledge but not divine revelation because divine revelation will produce humility in our lives. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So we don't we don't want that kind of a thing. BUT YOU KNOW I LOOK AT IT AND HOW that God would actually equip us within that to be servants ONE TO ANOTHER TO ACTUALLY MINISTER TO these things within our lives. I I'm grateful that God does that. I'm grateful that God will send men that are willing to be servants to his word, servants to him, and not try to be servants to the people. I don't want to I'm not interested in preaching something to make people shout, make them run. If if there's something that you know is given, I believe in the liberty of the word, BUT THIS IS NOT THAT'S NOT THE OBJECTIVE BECAUSE the objective is is to be a help &gt;&gt; to somebody. Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 12:15. And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you, though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved. Now you think about this scripture. Paul was giving of himself. And Paul was not in this scripture saying, "Now, I'm going to tell you, if there's now there's only 10 that's showing up. I think I'll just pull back on my study. Now there's only five. I'll just pull back. We'll just do a little little Bible study, read a real scripture, and pass around the mic. I'm just using an example that we could relate to." But you know what? Paul was saying the more the less though I more abundantly yet the less I be loved. You see your love our love the expression and I want to say the expression of divine love in our life should never be based on what's coming in return &gt;&gt; because if it is it's not right. And yet sometimes can we get discouraged? Sure we can. &gt;&gt; Can we we battle through that? Hey listen, brother Brandon battled through that. As a matter of fact, let me tell you the battle. I'm not going here tonight. But brother Bram, the battle he had is that it got to such a place that the more he was being spent and giving, the more he was saying, "Pin your pin your hair up. Brother Bam's coming to town. Do this and do that." It got to a place to where Brother Bram says, "Can you believe a person could get to a place that they would absolutely see a person going over the waterfall and laugh at it standing in the gap?" &gt;&gt; He said, frankly, he said, "That's where I'm at this morning. I can follow a man like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man that's not always just putting but absolutely of what took place is the feeling for the people was lost. &gt;&gt; You see that's a danger when feeling gets lost. You go be going through the acts without any love within it. Remember Paul Raider? He he kissed his wife goodbye and he went out there and he heard her crying a little bit behind the door and he came in and he grabbed her and kissed her again and he said, "What was the difference?" He said, "The second one had feeling in &gt;&gt; it." [laughter] &gt;&gt; But it's it's truly, friends, it's a danger for all of us. It's and I realize for myself as a minister, it's it's a real it's a real danger. We can get to going through things and it just becomes service and those things like that. I'm just being honest with you. for myself when I look at that I've been you know privileged to sit around with brothers even from when I've taken took the pastorship and they would talk and I'll be honest with you there's certain things that they talked about at that time and mentioned to me I didn't I didn't even I didn't understand exactly what they were saying I've listened it's etched in my mind but then as I've come through different times and different things the Holy Spirit would bring that out you remember what so- and so said in your living room when you were there and he was there after the meetings you remember what this and that and I remember those things coming back but to remember at this I don't want I don't want to do something because it's just my duty &gt;&gt; or service. that that's you know what that that kind of a state that's a dangerous state to be in &gt;&gt; when something is just going but you know it's things that you know you say well brother Samuel how how do you how do you keep from that just continue to pray continue to look to God continue to seek the Lord and if there's things that I I feel like I need maybe to to rest a little bit that's what that's what I'll do within that and just really just because I want within my heart I want my heart to be tender &gt;&gt; before God Now notice how Paul would write of this in first 1 Corinthians 9. Now let me go back. This is going back to 1 Corinthians 9. Yet I have made though I be free from all men. In other words, I'm in liberty. Yet have I made myself servant unto all that I may gain the more. Now Paul goes into this how that he became to the Jews as a Jew. you know, he would be able Paul knew how to talk and put all that together and go through that and and he would do that. You find that in examples of the when he had the Pharisees and Sadducees and Paul Paul just spoke one thing and cut that whole audience in half. I believe in the resurrection OF THE DEAD AUTOMATICALLY PHARISEES LIKE, "GLORY TO GOD, THAT MAN'S ON OUR SIDE." &gt;&gt; AMEN. [laughter] &gt;&gt; It'd be like standing in the midst of a bunch of BAPTISTS AND PENTECOSTALS. GLORY TO GOD, I BELIEVE IN ETERNAL SECURITY. THE BAPTIST GOES, "AH, I think that guy's ONE OF US. GLORY TO GOD. I BELIEVE IN THE SUPERNATURAL GIFTS." THE PENTECOST SAY, "I THINK HE'S ONE OF US." That's why they asked Brother Brandon, "What in the world are you?" He said, "Well, that's easy. &gt;&gt; I can't remember the whole long thing." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Pentecost on Nazarene Baptist. [laughter] But you WANT, LOOK, YOU'LL SEE THIS EVEN in Brother Bram's meetings. I don't know if you've paid attention this or not. I watch when brother Brandon will get it and we'll go come into certain meetings and things and you can catch how that even a lot of times when you'll watch a series of meetings how that brother Brandon will come about and you'll actually you'll find things ministering actually to the needs that are there. We know it's the spirit of God will lead it. But the prophet would absolutely have to be sensitive to that as well to allow the spirit of God to be able to move and to get the message across. And to think of how that, you know, Paul would say that as those that are without the law, I myself have become, you know, being not not without law to God, but under the law of Christ, that I may gain them that are without the law. In other words, when Paul was with the Jews, he he he wouldn't eat ribs. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; or pin down. BUT WHEN PAUL WAS WITH THE GENTILES, he said, "Bring me a slab, boys." Because he was free. &gt;&gt; Right. He was free. SO, I'M USING JUST THAT WITH AN EXAMPLE THAT HE WASN'T IT WASN'T THAT PAUL was living a careless or reckless LIFE, BUT HE WAS EVERYTHING THAT HE WAS DOING, IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH, LET'S SAY, HOW much you like ribs or whatever more. IT HAD EVERYTHING TO DO WITH TRYING TO win that person's favor with the ultimate objective for the gospel's sake. &gt;&gt; Brother, how long does that take? Sometimes the timeline's different for everybody. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you might work with somebody for 10 years. &gt;&gt; Don't get impatient. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; WELL, I'M GOING TO DROP SERPENT SEED ON THEM. THEY MAY NOT be ready for that. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, JUST KEEP BEING A FRIEND TO THEM. &gt;&gt; KEEP LIVING THE LIFE. KEEP SHINING THE LIGHT ACROSS THEIR PATHWAY. EVEN YOUR LOVED ONES, THE DIFFERENT ONES AROUND US. KEEP SHINING THE LIGHT AND LIVING THE LIFE. THAT'S MORE POWERFUL THAN any knowledge. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I made all things to all men that I might by all means save some. Now, brother Brian picks this up in adoption [clears throat] part three and he talks about the scripture, "Father, I sanctify myself for their sake." Brother Brandham says, you know, that's one of the sweetest words that I ever heard. Father, I sanctify them for my sake. He said, did you know he had a right to have a home? &gt;&gt; He was a human. &gt;&gt; You know, he said he had a right to have a wife. He was a man. He had a right to all these things. But he said, 'Father, I sanctify myself for their sake. I sanctify myself. Bram said, I was talking to a little preacher yesterday. I'm going to preach for him in a few nights here on the highway, and I asked him about a certain thing, and he said, yes, brother Brandham, but the most of my people doesn't believe in that. I said, most of them are legalist. Yes. But the brother doesn't believe that. But he said, "For their sake." Brother says, "I wanted to hug his neck. For their sake, I sanctify myself for their sake." Now, I don't have there's no other statements within there when even throughout the times, the years I've looked at this in the message, but I have an idea where this where this church and who this this brother is when he talks about being out on the highway. And within this part of it when brother Brandham would ask this brother and say most of them are legalist. Yeah brother. Now this brother this pastor when him and brother Brandham are speaking about things it isn't that that church itself would never come into that place of really accepting the grace of God. But sometimes to go right in on things can actually cause more harm. &gt;&gt; Everything has its time and its season. &gt;&gt; I never forget I was the first one of the first times I was in the Philippines and I was sitting after we had come out of the convention and brother Pete he was uh brother Pete he's went on home to be with the Lord. I don't remember his last name but brother Pete, brother Roel, different ones. They were we were all sitting in our in the parsonage there. And uh when they first started doing the mystery expose and brother Pete was not only a pastor but he was a real high man I think in Assemblies of God and when brother Pete had accepted the message and this was you know one of the first mystery expose that was done. The one thing that they learned through that is when brother Pete accepted that he bl they blazed right into the church there and he began to preach it. And as soon as he began to preach it, I mean, everything broke loose. His house pulled from him. You know, the church because you most I don't know, probably a lot of you understand, but you know, there's things that when you understand, you ride by a lot of these denominational buildings. Do you know those people don't own that? &gt;&gt; Do you know that pastor, whoever the pastor is there, that that pastor serves there at the liberty of the headquarters? Yeah. &gt;&gt; And if headquarters sees we can that that church will move somebody else and we'll move people around. That's exactly what headquarters will do. &gt;&gt; And we've just had some experience with that in family and things like that and seeing those things firsthand. My dad always told me about it. But you know when you get to looking at it the thing that brother Pete Brother Pete had just a smile about him. You know he would smile and and brother Roel they said I tell you what we've learned a lot since the first time around. So after when we first go in there, when you know the pastors received it, we start to just drop little &gt;&gt; by little by little in a congregation to to do what? Working to catch the elect that's in there. &gt;&gt; And so you see there's things that we learn now. Would they would would brother Oel would brother Pete would they have given anything? Oh man, if I would have we would have known that the first go first couple of gorounds with the mystery expose and what would take place would they have done it differently? they would have. But what's important is is they learn from those things that were done right there. &gt;&gt; You know, when we begin to see this how that being made are made made as Paul said, I've been made all things to all men. Let me just try to wrap this up with this quote. Brother Bram goes on in that in what I'm referring to. Father, I sanctify myself for their for for their sake. He said Jesus was training 12 men that through those 12 men was to take the gospel to the world. And he said, "For their sake, I sanctify myself." In other words, make yourself for your neighbor's sake or for somebody else's sake. Don't use your liberty for a cloak, said Paul. But sanctify yourself. Behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real Christian ought to. If you meet your enemy, sanctify yourself for his sake, &gt;&gt; not knowing what you might do. So to make oursel, how how could you make yourself? It's not about making yourself as far as like, well, you're going to do this. It's about becoming that which is truth. &gt;&gt; It's about when God begins to show these things to us and it begins to move upon our life. And then as we read here, make yourself for your neighbor's sake. In other words, to where that we become a servant for that person. Servant to be able to minister to their needs to make oursel for your neighbor's sake, for somebody else's sake. Don't use your liberty for a cloak, but sanctify yourself. I say, God, help me, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right? &gt;&gt; If this is what the Lord Jesus himself when he took upon and dawned upon this of even not only the robe of humanity but he himself would gird himself with a towel and he would make himself &gt;&gt; a footwash flunky. you know, to make yourself even to go beyond, you know, when you when even maybe witness to a family member and yet there there can be a lot of things that are, you know, going on within them and and so forth. And you can just, you know, Yeah. I mean, you could just, you know, get right to THE CHASE AND SAY, "YOU NEED TO BE BORN AGAIN." THEY DON'T have no clue what that means. &gt;&gt; And that's a really the last thing &gt;&gt; they really need. It's not that they don't need to be born again, but what it is, they need Jesus &gt;&gt; to be brought in contact of where they're at. &gt;&gt; Sometimes people need an ear. They need a they need that of a heart. They need things. And yet sometimes, WHAT IS IT? IT'S PRESSURES OF TIME. YEAH, WE WON'T SEE IT LIKE THAT. WE WE LOOK AT LIKE, WELL, I got all the time in the world. And and yet THEN WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO OTHER THINGS, WE will labor. Maybe we would build a building and we would labor. WE WOULD BE SO METICULOUS, MAN. WE'RE SO FINE ON HOW WE'RE DOING THIS CORNER AND HOW WE'RE DOING THIS. BUT YET WHEN IT COMES TO WORKING with somebody else, we would be so curt and so right on &gt;&gt; that is so &gt;&gt; in that manner instead of taking times where sometimes within even in things that we do I know even in things you know that we do around here when we're doing a project I got a lot of questions got a lot of things I reflect on a lot of things that go through my mind a lot and different things when we're looking at that and brothers we can talk about it there's a lot of things because when we want to do we want to do things that are that are done well. &gt;&gt; But how much more with souls? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; How much more with lives? How much more with the feelings of one another? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Make yourself for your neighbor's sake. And then they're at the bottom. If you meet your enemy, anybody got any enemies? [laughter] Here's what we do. sanctify yourself &gt;&gt; for their sake. Clean out. Clean out. Not knowing what you might do. Oh, brother Samuel, if we've really got the whole No, no, no. Sanctify yourself not knowing what you might do. Keeping ourselves clean, separated. That's why Paul said, "Walk in the spirit &gt;&gt; and you won't fulfill the lust, the lust of the flesh." Amen. Let's stand. I think how Paul and you know they Aquilla and Priscilla, they they worked with Apollos. I like how the Bible says because some sometimes the serving one another is ministering encouragement to one. Sometimes it's instructing or discipling one. Sometimes it's speaking the truth in love. Sometimes you just being honest with one another. Sometimes that can be pretty difficult. Now, I'm not talking about the opposite being a liar. But sometimes, you know how it is that there's times where you you really need to be honest with somebody. And sometimes it can be where you don't know exactly. You look at it, well, they're a friend or maybe you you have it's a time of being honest. You don't know. I don't know how they're going to respond to it. I don't know how they're going to act to it. So, it isn't that you're a liar, but you know, sometimes somebody can ask you something and how did you feel about this? How did you think about that? and you could just go right along with it. And sometimes we we take into account the situation and things, but yet then there's other times where God, help me to be honest. Help me just to be honest. Now, I'm not talking about always pulling out the revolver and just shooting them between the eyes. You know, the Bible talks about the blessedness of wounds above secret love. And how faithful are the wounds of a friend? &gt;&gt; Because somebody who's always patting you on the back is not your friend. But a friend is one that will be honest with you. But in that honesty, a lot of times where a friend will do is they've prayed over it before they'll ever express it with the whole objective to not wanting to hurt or to offend. And yet, you know, every time that I ever got a spanking or got corrected or sometimes when they always called it when I was teaching, they called it constructive criticism. putting that nice beautiful term in front of criticism as though it's supposed to make you feel better, constructive, you know, it's beneficial. [laughter] And you know, they would always kind of teach you how to, you know, they teach you the things how that you know, one, two, three positives and then slip it in. You know, and there's things that and you know, in reality, you think, oh, that bunch of psychology. I can read you 1 Corinthians chapter 1. That same approach was taken where Paul commended the Corinthian church &gt;&gt; for their position in Christ. &gt;&gt; A lot of times that's not mentioned. We think Ephesians, but Paul mentions in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 mentioned that they came not behind in any spiritual gift. He gave such admonishment to him. And then like brother Bram says after about that he says he lowered the boom. &gt;&gt; But you think about how Aquilla and Priscilla they took Apollos &gt;&gt; to the side and one of the things that they did was they discipled him. I I tell you, you know, I look forward to meeting Aquilla and Priscilla because in their lives to think of what they did to be able to see the need in Apollos's life and in his ministry and they were such a help to him in in in his walk and his journey to come fully all the way in. They got right with him and discipled him. So, that's so good. &gt;&gt; I pray, Lord, &gt;&gt; don't let me be so caught up in Samuel's world because I've got I've got my world. I've got my things. Like, I could go through and say, "Oh, you you don't understand this and understand that." I just be honest, friend. Sometimes when I when I hear, you know, sometimes where people say, "Oh, if people only understood what the ministry," I don't ever expect you to understand. My wife even in in in my home. She's right there with me serving with me. My boys are right there in the home. They they're not me. But you know, I don't expect them. I don't turn to them when things are going on or pressures. I don't let they don't they don't know that. They don't know that. But you know, with the things I don't expect I don't expect anybody oh to understand this or understand that. I don't expect that. That's not anything less. But I do but I do and I am thankful for this that we know that just as much as things that one is going through someone else is going through something as well. &gt;&gt; And we each are going through different things in our life. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It's not about it's not some exclusive thing over here and that's I I just those are things that I don't I don't even care to hear. I just we want to be of a service &gt;&gt; to the body of Jesus Christ. Let's just bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, [sighs and gasps] Lord, I just dear God, I'm so thankful for your mercy, Lord, that you Lord, not only would bring a liberty in our hearts and our lives. And Lord, truly you have you you have really you've set us free. Lord, I'm so grateful for that. But I pray father that. I know Lord that you've forgiven me. There's no doubt Lord because I can speak not only for myself but for this congregation. Sometimes the Lord just unaware where we've used liberty for an occasion to the flesh. Sometimes, Lord, it's been ways and things, Lord. It isn't always the same for everybody. But I'm asking you, Lord, may we, each one of us, Lord, help us to take it and to be sensitive. If there ever was a time, Lord, in an hour, I find how your profit over and over and over again, admonishing us how we are to love one another. What I heard him say just yesterday and true sign overlooked and it came back up to the pullpit. He said that love that is should be between us as brothers and sisters if we ever loved one another. &gt;&gt; This ought to be the time he said it ought to be something greater than that of even what would be in blood related brothers and sisters. Oh Lord Jesus, help us. Lord, help us. Father, help me. Help me, Lord. Not only as a pastor, but help me as a brother. Help me, Lord. Help me to be sensitive, Lord. Help me to be sensitive, Lord. I always, you know, my heart's desire. I want to be sensitive to follow you. I want to be sensitive, Lord, to not only just to be sensitive on what to minister and what to bring, Lord, to your children, whether it's here, Lord, at home or places, Lord, where you would have me to go. I don't just limit it, Lord, to preaching, but help me to be of a service to the body. Lord God, even many times, Lord, when I'd go into places, talk to some Lord of the people and they're were helping me out at the meat counter and cutting meat in a certain slice or a certain way and I just just say something, Lord, to them. We get to talk and they begin to smile. It just I'm so thankful, Lord, because I know the burdens, the pressure of this day. &gt;&gt; It's all around. &gt;&gt; Oh God, help us. I don't want just something to be exclusive, Lord, to where it's just the only thing I can do is be of a service to the body of Jesus Christ. That's what I want. I want to be I want to be that Lord. If it's holding the door for somebody that ain't just somebody, Lord, who stands and holds the door, but it's about seeing a need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes, Lord, the simplest things &gt;&gt; we could step over. Maybe it's a cough drop wrapper. Maybe it's a tissue. Oh, the janitor will get that. But what if I see it? &gt;&gt; That's so good. God, help me that I'll never be too big that I couldn't pick up a cough drop wrapper. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is your house. &gt;&gt; This is our place. &gt;&gt; And I pray to God, don't let me be grumbling and murmuring in my heart. Why couldn't that lazy thing have thrown this in the trash can, oh God, it renders zero deposit when it's done with murmurings and disputes. Help us, Lord. Help us, Lord. Dear God, I pray that I know it's very simple, but help us, Lord. Surely, if you're leading upon this, Lord, and would place these things upon my heart to minister, you're calling us to a higher a higher calling, a higher walk. Help us, Lord. Help us Jesus. Help us Lord. Help us Lord to serve one another with love. Help us Lord that brother, that sister, Lord God, like we said, maybe one that we haven't seen in a while. Maybe Lord that even before then just Lord sometimes even a text a card how those little things Lord it means so much &gt;&gt; you know Lord here on Sat last Saturday evening I went to the mailbox there was one Lord that had sent me a card and They had wrote Lord in them that card of how they have watched their life being changed being made more and more like you and how they had seen such victory in their life. Lord God &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What encouragement that was. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brought tears to my eyes. Brought joy to my heart. Lord because that's the whole desire. &gt;&gt; I want to see Lord hearts and lives just Lord to seeing just that growth that's that victory just that joy Lord that being experienced in their life that's that's worth it all. Thank you Lord. Thank you Father. Thank you for being mindful. Thank you Lord God. Thank you, Lord, for moving, Lord, to where that would even be pinned and dropped in the mail, Lord God. Thank you for that, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was from you. Thank you, Lord. I pray, heavenly father, help each and every one of us, Lord. [music] Lord, we're living in an hour our phones get blowed up with discouraging news. If we're tied in, Lord, to any sort of news or anything at all. Oh my goodness, Lord, there's things all around us. &gt;&gt; I always think how brother John Lefontaine would kind of joke around with the weather. He said, "Why can't they say partly sunny, instead they say partly cloudy." &gt;&gt; Oh, God. Things that just so there's so much negative. Help us. I don't believe God that in this hour that you you've led us to a place of defeat. No. But in an hour where there's hatred has reached to such an apex or we see people shooting one another because they disagree. If it can reach to that place, then it shows Lord in the contrast where love is to have its way. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you wanted us all to think the same, you would do that, Lord. As I've said for weeks, months now, it's amazing how your prophet will describe it to where we will come to the marriage supper of the lamb and [music] then all differences will fade. They actually fade away at the change of the body. But you would let that remain. our certain feelings about something, our thoughts about something, you would let that remain all the way through to prove that divine love is greater than any opinion, any thought, any feeling, any difference. What victory in love divine? Help us Lord. Help us to be mindful in serving one another. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. I pray in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. [music and singing] Oh, I want to [music] be more like you. I want to [music and singing] be a vessel you work through. I want to [singing] be more like you. [music] [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; Want to be more like you, Jesus. I [singing] want to be more like you. Oh, I [singing] want to be a vessel you work through. for I want to be [singing] more like you. [singing] Want to be more like you, [music] Jesus. I want to be more [singing] like you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Oh, I want to be a vessel of you. For I want to be [music and singing] more like you. Take me deeper. [music] &gt;&gt; Yes. with you, Jesus. [music] Hold [singing] me close in your embrace. [singing] [music] Take me deeper. [music] I just want to love you [music] more and more. Oh, how long [music] [singing] is it? You know, sometimes when we're discipling and instructing, sometimes you don't even know. I think there's different times that I've been ministering, you don't even know. But I told you about even when the time here I was just up there at brother John Andy's and in that service that morning what I was studying on that morning and looking at I was so set. I thought the inspiration this this is where I'm going where we're going today. And when I went over and was a brother came in and I shook that brother's hand, began to speak to him. And it was a brother whose grandson his life had just been taken. And as soon as I shook his hand and began to talk to him, I felt something switch. First thing you do, Lord, is it just is that me? &gt;&gt; I didn't feel the same in way I felt inspired about everything before. I went out there in that service and read some scriptures and then the Lord just the Lord took it and I told you here the Lord told me he said just follow me in that service I went through in my testimony that's what started coming out also coming out different needs of how tragedy could strike within a church tragedy of young ones And then our response after tragedy strikes, where do we turn to, what what do we give ourselves to, you know, within that part of it? Sometimes when you're speaking to individuals, you know, there was an individual right there, and I think I told you this. These are some some some of these people had never even darkened a church door at all. They were friends of this person. certain terminologies they never would have understood here in the midst of a ministering brother Steve Clar the associate I didn't catch it but he said brother Samuel said that I don't know if you caught this or not he said but as you were speaking he said when that one young man got up he said and he walked out he said he was out there standing in the parking lot he said I walked over to him and said it's pretty heavy isn't it he said oh my he said Brother Samuel, he said, "Right out there in the parking lot," he said, "I led him to the Lord." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He said, "We got right down in that parking lot and I led him to the Lord." I say all that in this. You've got a testimony. &gt;&gt; Just tell somebody how your candle got lit. Just tell them your testimony. That that in itself will have an impact as God would lead you. Just just minister to them. Just like as a person one time that I was standing in Panera and this guy, you know, he he went to go get that hazelnut coffee and I don't I don't go to Panera for coffee, but one time, you know, I I did and I was looking at it and I said he said, "Man," he said, "I sure would like to have, you know," and he named off something. I said I said, "You know what? God set me free of that." He set the coffee cup down and he turned around and looked at me. He said, "What did you say?" I said, "God set me free of that." I'm not talking about Panera coffee. I'm talking about the the drink he was talking about. I said, "God set me free of that." Then he he started talking to me. He started asking me and the moment as we started talking, I can tell you right there in the how that paner was set up, the prince of God came down in such a way that man, that man didn't even know what to do. He ran off and left his book. I had to take his book and chase him out to his car. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But the presence of God came down. &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. &gt;&gt; In such a way, but you know what it was? just just testifying just just letting him know just what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; Just a sharing that that's an impact, friends. Your life's a testimony. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you tonight. May God be with you. Amen. God with you as we go our separate ways. Remember, Brother Josh Martin, he'll be here, Lord willing, on Sunday and ministering for us. And so we just want to just pray and just be ready for that and ask the Lord just to speak to us.
