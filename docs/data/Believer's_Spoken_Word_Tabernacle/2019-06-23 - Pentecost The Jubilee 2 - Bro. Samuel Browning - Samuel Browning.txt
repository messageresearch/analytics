You musicians I want you to if you would go with me to Acts chapter one just so many places to go we'll just we'll start here x1 and I just want to say that here this morning just so good to be gathered together in the presence of the Lord those of you just the first time maybe seeing since I haven't seen your sense since I was here two weeks ago on a Sunday and senior I certainly appreciated your prayers when we were gone in Mexico and there and there in the meetings and the Lord just just done wonderful things in those services and I just also covet your prayers not this week but the end of this week starting on Saturday we go into the the youth camp that will go through the following Thursday and July 4th so we just ask for you that that you'll just keep keep us and keep those services in prayer that are coming up that God will just richly just take a hold of young people's hearts a man that they'll have a they'll have a special visitation they men of the Holy Ghost amen because that's certainly what's needed in this hour that's the only thing that can stand amen and not want to say we want I don't want me to keep you standing but you might be sitting a while but I want to say we want to say thank you for the love offering that was taken here a few weeks ago and be directed there toward the medical needs there with little Liliana and this one - thank you as close to I didn't think it was close to $2,600 so may God richly bless you amen for your for your you're giving Amen within that and also onna I got see oldest nephew back there Jonathan good to see you you and your family god bless you [Applause] I've seen the pictures of your family of the day it's just it's just amazing it's amazing you know how that the children and all of us and they all growing you know for myself though I know I don't look any different than when I did over 17 you know I had thinning hair when I was 17 I already had and then I also want to announce here we have a special announcement as well brother Brian jr. and sister Gracie announced their engagement so the Lord willing though Lord willing to be married here sometime in the fall I think they're kind of des settled I would let them announce that date so we just are sold so happy amen for them well I told Jax one I meant acts too Acts chapter 2 verse 1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance now in the scripture you you're aware that how many were gathered outside of there even in the in the continuing scriptures and they had asked the question in verse 12 they were all there and they were amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meaneth this and others mocking said these men are full of new wine then we find Peter here he stands up and declares the fulfillment of the scripture he says in verse 14 Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith god i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall see dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and vapor of smoke the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved amen we're gonna let you be seated and I just want to continue reading here in the scripture here let's go to verse 32 in that same chapter Peter's Peter here Peter is declaring the prophecy that has come to pass in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which is the result of the sacrifice that was offered out of that perfect sacrifice now that life can come back upon the worshiper so here Peter is declaring in verse 32 this Jesus hath God raised up whereof we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having received of the father the promise of the Holy Ghost he hath shed for this which he now see and here for David is not ascended into the heavens but he saith himself the Lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until I make thine until and sit down on my right hand until I make thy fold thy foes thy footstool therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both Lord and Christ and I want to just pause there just for just a brief moment here you find remember when the the disciples had went away and they had departed from Jerusalem after the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus and they were walking on their way in Luke 24 they were going away from Jerusalem but when he appeared to them on the road to Emmaus he made himself known to them by by the scriptures or in the scriptures that indeed what was spoken has come to pass they in their mind they did not understand it and you remember as we been through that in the scriptures there many things that he said they did not catch regarding the suffering they didn't see that but it wasn't necessary in that hour that they catch it but it would be necessary that they would catch that of the suffering in that time so that they could see that the payment had been made that now once the payment is made they can receive the earnest from that payment in other words to receive the life of the sacrifice inside of them so notice notice what the the unfolding of of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ does it brings them not going away from where the promise is but it brings them back to where the promise is to be poured out it must begin in Jerusalem is that right that is where that the Holy Spirit was to be pulled out because remember God had made a promise and brother and sister this morning every promise that God has made he keeps it he doesn't have to alter it and say well you know maybe I meant this or maybe this or maybe that or maybe it can be out here in Galilee nope it's to be in Jerusalem amen remember it was there in Jerusalem he chose to place his name there and to think about it God was declaring there in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit that indeed the promise that he had given to Israel all the covenants and everything that was made he kept every promise of that word right to the dot and here Peter he is standing as an exponent and he is addressing notice what the Bible said here let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have crucified both the Lord in Christ oh I tell you my heart is looking for the time where that same call will go forth through the hundred forty-four thousand over there in the land and that same Gospel message will be preached to the 144,000 all the house of Israel know assuredly so you see in the midst then of the time we we see where Israel you know they they were blinded for our sakes they were blinded so that you and I could be brought in that was all part of the mystery that lay there in we're all the way in the Old Testament it was a mystery that lay there in Christ that you and I could be brought in now to think of this and that was already many of those places were already spoken of in the Old Testament even where Paul would record in the book of Galatians I believe Galatians three where God preached to Abraham and saying that the HUD the the heathen would be justified how that God would would pour out the spirit are there upon us as Gentiles and to think of it you and I on I want you to catch this now you and I as Gentiles were not looking for the Messiah as a matter of fact Paul picks it up very clearly there was no promises that was made per se to us but the promises were made to Israel yet there were promises that pertained to us but we didn't know it but when it came time for us that we would know the promises that were made for us God would make sure that we would know those promises and when he makes known the promise brother he just doesn't give you something that's empty he provides what is needed that you might be a partaker of that promise just as he has done down through these past two thousand years when he would when the word would go forth and be expressed there were those of the Church of the Living God that would receive a deposit of the Holy Spirit that made them ready from waiting and longing for the coming of the Lord in his corporal body hallelujah now I want you to think of this here you know this morning when Peter he speaks this and he speaks it to the whole house of Israel and and and notice the Bible says in verse 37 when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and brethren what shall we do I need some gas up here in these monitors there's nothing what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost I want you to look at this very and we've been really really covering this in combing it and combing it but you realize the Holy Ghost is not anything that you merit you don't earn it it is the gift of the Holy Ghost there's only two things that you and I are required to do and it's His grace that would even lead us to that and that is repentance and you know the Bible says that the goodness of God leads us to repentance are you with me so here to even repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of our sacrifice we are identifying when we repent of our sins and you see conviction has to strike the heart you know friends conviction a very sign of impending judgment is when conviction is leaving the hearts of men people are no longer under conviction at all they're no longer under conviction for the things that they do you know come to church and everything the way that it is and no longer under conviction I'll tell you that's an endtime saying it's a sign right now that we're living here in the final moments in the final days you see when Peter began to speak this you know Peter was not just quoting words but it was the Spirit of God within Peter that was quoting there of the Psalms and what the promises pertained to the Messiah it was the Holy Ghost not not the voice of Peter that brought conviction it was the Holy Ghost not the voice of Peter that led them to the place of eternal life the Holy Ghost just borrowed Peters natural voice hmm I'm trying to get somewhere now amen it that is what God would call us to do notice what verse 39 says the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call in that wonderful the promise is unto you and to your children even as many as are afar off that was you and our brother and sister we were nowhere near there we were afar off but God knew where we were and the same God that knew where we were he knows exactly where our children are he knows exactly where our loved ones are he's the same God you with me this morning when the prodigal son went away he went the father woody was not down there in the Pigpen contacting him you understand me he wasn't down there but what it was it was the angel of the Lord that brought conviction to his heart and he started to think differently about home who changed he did home didn't change he was changing even though the father and the mother could not see anything but yet the angel of the Lord was turned clearly you and I are no are not more powerful than the Holy Ghost it takes the Holy Ghost to take a whole it takes the Holy Spirit there to grab ahold of that line it takes the Spirit of God to work on that heart and bring it to a surrender many times when I gave my testimony it wasn't so much a surrender it's just flat-out God made an arrest you're with me God just made an arrest I had other plans but God made an arrest God said wait a minute your plans that's what you made but now it's time for you to come into my plans for you Oh glory I'm glad he's still in the arresting business aren't you know what Peter said and with many words many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this untoward generation then they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls now let you turn with me to the Leviticus 25 here I still just wanting to continue here on the fault that we were looking at just a few weeks ago on that of Pentecost and the Jubilee and I want to look here in Leviticus 25 verse 8 we read just a few verses scripture here just trust the Lord or bring it all together for us and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years now remember every seven years the land would go into a time of rest when the land would go into a time of rest during the seventh year even the person who was in slavery and they altered debt they were not released during that time however during the seventh year came a time of rest to where the debt that they owed nothing could be extracted or or required to be given within that seventh year because the seventh year remember what grew in the seventh year you to let it grow and don't touch it right so there would be a time of rest a time of reprieve and then it's right back into that into that cycle and here they are coming back into that you know still slaving still slaving away it's still slaving away but notice here what God is speaking of is this time of the Jubilee and Jubilee means 50 right Pentecost itself means 50 right now and the space of the seventh Sabbath's of years shall be into the forty and nine years so seven Sabbath's of seven times seven forty-nine years then shalt thou calls the trumpet of the Jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month in the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family now I want you to look at this the trumpet itself was sounded there in the 49th year it was sounded on the Day of Atonement but the trumpet is what alerted and announced that the Jubilee is all it was that where they were looking forward to that and remember look how the scripture is placed here in verse 9 it speaks in the seventh month in the Day of Atonement ye shall make the trumpet sound throughout all your land now remember that atonement it's that which would it's that which brings where we are accepted in him remember where Israel would go down would have to every year once once a year there would be a cleansing of the sanctuary each year there was that offering of the red heifer there all of those parts were known the scapegoat and and the live goat all of those things within itself was that which was rendered there on the day of atonement but remember the time of atonement itself was when you read in the Book of Leviticus when you especially when you read in Leviticus 23 it refers back over to Leviticus 16 where the Passover lamb was offered up and that Passover lamb is the Lord Jesus Christ he was offered once and for all we don't we don't need Jesus plus we need the Lord Jesus and him alone through and by his offering brother every in every sin and every devil has already been conquered the Bible said he was in the world and and you know as he was here he was tempted in all manner such as we are yet without sin when he stood there in Pilate saw they could not find any Fault in him it was testified before even all the unbelievers they could not find any Fault in him but brother even when man couldn't find no fault in him what was glorious is God found no fault in him the Bible says in Isaiah 53 that he saw his offering when he shall make his soul an offering for sin he shall be satisfied I hope you preach him in just a moment here you see God looks Beyond and down into the depths of that heart he knew that so it was being willfully surrendered there on behalf of you and I ha he made the ransom payment that you and I could go 3 and how that God looked upon the head and through his offering the Bible says in Isaiah 53 he would justify many glory be to God I don't want to get ahead of myself but I'm gonna go ahead and say it anyhow I tell you right now he's already paid the prize for whatever it is that you have need of this morning if you need deliverance he's already paid the price if you need healing he's already paid the price if you need the Holy Ghost he is the way it's him and him alone Alleluia or glory be to God you see this Jubilee year think how God would give these types and these shadows would lay here within the scripture and how that slavery it would it would speak here how that there would be times that would come up where we're an Israelite they would they would have to you know sell of themselves in order to pay a debt they would go and begin to labor and yet you know within the labouring of that right there you see within this this land of Israel they were each one given an inheritance they were given an inheritance when they were down there in Egypt God had already made a promise before when before they were ever in Egypt God had already made a promise when he was making this known to Abraham regarding that it would be the seed your seed will be a stranger they will sojourn in a strange land but I will bring them into this land God already was lending know this inheritance here belongs to the seed of Abraham and right now I'm speaking of Israel in the natural and remember what God's desire was was for Israel they're gonna be brought out of Egypt and come into this land that belonged to them their inheritance because in this land they could serve the purpose of God God himself would put them in position where they belong is that right now within that that inheritance that even that you and I that we'll look at here this morning for a little bit that inheritance that it was given to us as the children of God is that of the Holy Ghost to be in Christ and Christ Himself is the word is that right it is the word you see you can't be in Christ and deny the word because you're denying him that would be like an Israelite being in their land and saying well you know well you know I like this part of the land but I don't like that part of the land but everything that when they came in to their inheritance they were to possess the land the inheritance that God gave them and brother let me tell you something if May there was those and you know that did not have an interest in going into the land they didn't go in the land but for those who had a desire to go into the land and a hunger to go in the land rather all the unbelief could be around there but they knew that God made the promise and God was big enough to back that promise up that has to be caught to do that it was a Joshua that opened up from the Jordan it was the Lord God that opened up the Jordan it showed that you can't get into this land but the efforts of man it has to be an act of Almighty God they couldn't decide and say we're Joshua I'll go on down the stream a little bit and I'll enter into another place there was one way into this land you got to come through the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's one way there's one opening and that is through the Lord Jesus Christ into this land Oh glory be to God the debt itself you see God lays this promise down here in the word and the Lord was letting it be known here it was it was this which would prevent an oppression it was also where God was declaring that the debt won't be forever that was God God was declaring this this was a type of what God was speaking of when he let it be known for Israel that in the natural seed of Abraham but it was a type of the spiritual seed of Abraham and he will also be fulfilled in that and the gathering of the 144,000 and God also let it be known these are all I'm drawing this out of the verticals 25 here God let it be known that what that it that the Israel those of the sons of Israel they were his servants they belonged to him and that the inheritance you know the inheritance would remain with the tribe of whom it belongs you know even when a man was sold into slavery his inheritance remained with the tribe that he was a part of he could not diminish that inheritance it was there that inheritance was for him Oh glory be to God brothers sister although the fall when the fall came there hinge Allah in there in Genesis 3 and it was announced but brother our inheritance was not taken away it was not diminished it was not transferred to somebody else but God himself would make a way that we could be brought back to our inheritance hallelujah think of this of even you know where the land the inheritance it's never to be taken or lost even from a tribe and this this land this heritage what what belongs to us it belongs to us I'm inside real clear it belongs to us and to our children I sure had a big Amen on that this inheritance belongs to us and to our children even as many as the Lord our God shall call when they came into the land God knew Israel would get away from what God set forth they came into the land they had wells they didn't dig houses they didn't build vineyards they didn't plant all of those things God let him know if you'll just focus on me and let me be the center of your life I'll take care of all these other things you know him being the center of your life isn't just looking and saying I Love You Lord Jesus but it's also dealing with sin when he comes and knocks on our door and says hey you need to take care of this hey you need to get this out of your life hey you need to address this is that right he let him know all of this are provided but when you go in the land there's lingering remnants and you need to tear them down tear down all of those of those trees that are known as groves get rid of them get rid of the idols tear down the pictures get rid of all that stuff clear it out of the land hmm God let him know here Israel would you know they would get away and think of how the Scriptures would portray it they would go to dig to themselves broken cisterns they and God was the one who would water their crops are you with me why did they have to start going to these other means they want to know how to you know how to fix their family problems how to fix all these other things and they go to all these other means rather and sister I'm telling you Jesus Christ is the answer who want to go to all these other means and what happens is the reason they had to start going to all those other all those other avenues you see what it does it shifts it to where it is the works of their hands what they're trying to do what they're trying to maintain they're trying to bring the water to the cross but God told them in Leviticus 22 this land is not like the land of Egypt you do not water your crops with your foot i Lord my eyes are upon this land I care for it I'm the one who brings water I'm the one who irrigate sit I'm the one who sees that water gets there I'll tell you right now if we can allow the water if the Holy Ghost the washing of water by the word brother he knows how to clear how every irrigation he knows how to clear out every ditch every stream every valley he knows how through you and I can stay clean and stay unclogged and untainted from the things of the world that the life of the Holy Ghost might move through us and water that seed it was a time of grace that's what the Jubilee was it didn't matter you could have went you could have went in bondage on the 48th year when the trumpets sounded you were going free it didn't matter if somebody had they had had been in debt and they had been serving for 47 or 48 years it did not matter this was the grace of Almighty God Amen that that sounding would come forth and you see it speaks even in this earth that you and I live upon you know the Bible says that in the Book of Psalms that the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof God Himself is bringing this earth through Redemption this earth belongs to him if God didn't write about all the other planets it was the earth that God that got his attention his focus was upon this of the earth is that right and so here God even within this it speaks of God's word and a sounding of the Jubilee for that even of the earth where God himself is leading the earth as he led it in the days of Noah there through repentance and water baptism he baptized it in me he baptized this water this earth in the days of Noah and then here when when he came himself when he created a body he himself he paid the price brother he not only redeems you and I but revenge in history by about all that belongs to you it stirred by that all that belongs to him and here his blood was shed and he claimed this earth what he had what had already come through repentance he claims it there with the blood that was shed and brother it's to get a baptism there a fire in the Millenium cleansing it there sanctifying it and when the new home comes it will set down the baptism of the Holy Ghost it will sat down in the new home he is bringing the earth back home the earth that was killed it will come up right I say can you do that I mean I can bet that something you know and most of a lot of you out baptized I can baptize you even with the help of somebody else but there's anybody in here think you could baptize this earth nope it had to be God and brother in the same God is the same one that dealt on your hearts even though God used the hand and the strength of man to lower you down but it was God that moved on your heart to submit yourself and say I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then he steps in and does what no man foreknew he takes you have that passes you into himself hallelujah amen is a time of Jubilee and how that God would call us back to himself the Bible says blessed in Matthew 5:5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth think about this the acceptable year of the Lord read with me in Isaiah 49 would you Isaiah 49 Oh the promises of God are just wonderful aren't they it's wonderful to have eyes to see and ears to hear him amen now watch your how that God would be speaking speaking of Israel but you and I are tucked in here as well in for Isaiah 49 8 thus saith the Lord in an acceptable time have I heard me and in a day of salvation have I helped me and I will preserve thee and give thee for a covenant of the people who's that speaking of the Lord Jesus Christ to establish the earth to cause to inherit the desolate Heritage's that thou may uh say to the prisoners go forth to them that are in darkness show yourselves they shall feed in the ways and their pastures shall be in all high places go over to Luke chapter 4 Luke chapter 4 here the Lord Jesus here the scroll of Isaiah is delivered to him what's road in Hosea 61 and here he picks it up the Bible says in verse 17 and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the Spirit of the Lord is upon me now he's reading the scripture but it's more than just reading this is a declaration of what has been wrote is now in fulfillment this one's just a scripture reading the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord now remember here the Lord Jesus Eirias he's a he is announcing this time in that we're the Jubilee it's time for the Jubilee the acceptable year it's time for this to be ushered in to where the captives can go free to where those who are blind that they can receive sight those who are bruised where they can be healed now to think here it was even before before he went to Calvary think of how that he moved down there in through the coast you know of the Israel how many lives that were touched there as they themselves were looking like the woman at the well her life was touched her life was changed brother she never had to go to self-help seminars she met him in when she had to come to a a steady and you know we're gonna teach you how to be a more respectable woman brother she met him who made the woman you with me she met him and he changed her oh my he was already demonstrating the power of God was already on earth it was moving there were those who tried to hide in trees by the name of Zacchaeus are you with me there were many others you know who were witness and there even gyruss himself the Bible says a generous here he was as a secret believer but a situation in his household it forced him to come out and seek out the Lord Jesus because he knew although here he was he knew all the scriptures regarding healing I hope somebody's hearing me he knew all the promise regarding healing but brother he wasn't enough to raise up his daughter from the dead that he knew all the promises and could recite everything regarding healing he needed to meet the healer you need the God who gave the word to come and confirm that word and quicken it and bring it to life his daughter was dead but here came the Lord Jesus brother he got in that house he said she's only sleeping and the rest of them left him to score What did he say get out get out ain't got nothing to prove to you get out I've come here because there's a need I'll tell you what Jesus will come where there's a need that a person says Lord I've got a need and only you can meet this need I'm not gonna try to hide behind things any longer I need you to meet this need in my life they change in genres this house after Jesus made a visit things were different things were different brother death was no longer lingering their funeral plans cancelled Oh life insurance company sorry to disturb you I did not mean that we need to fill that policy we have received another life policy whether they had come in contact with the Prince of life himself the Lord Jesus Christ you know Jesus has a he has a habit of going to funerals and raising people up you say brother Simon we're still bearing different ones I know that but there's also a promise in the word that they said they shall rise first event God proving within that but to think of it how many funeral plans that the devil's had with your life how many things were people wrote you off come on now I know about it I was wrote off if browning a week he'll be right back out here get browning this he was only brainwashed give him this giving this but you see my testimony remains the same this morning I did not need an idea I did not need a book but I met person of Jesus Christ that same pillar fire that are reading about in the book of Acts on the day of Pentecost part of that pillar fire he came down and laid claim on me you know that said boy you've got an inheritance hallelujah oh yeah you see I knew what it was like to know how to quote all the message y'all with me I've given this testimony many times I could quote the message when I wasn't even in my right mind I was raised in a message view you know with me I could quote it you nay you start out certain quotes I could tell you what message that came out of and I could finish the quote for you I could finish verses in the scripture but you know what it that was not the power that I needed knowledge is not power that's a lie there's only one power and Jesus said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you brother knowledge itself if it's all powerful why is it changed why's it altered but brother when the Holy Ghost has come I'll tell you introducers the same results today that it did back there on the day of Pentecost if the formula is kept the same too many quack druggist want to tamper with the formula wonder why it ain't working the way at all to work rather it ain't nothing wrong with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is still the same Paul never put a footnote in the scriptures and said this is only for a certain time but you know after the ages go on and the evil it continues to go forward then don't count on the Spirit of God quickening your mortal body the way that it raised up his body and the way it raised up our body that sounds like somebody trying to explain away and live in a life of defeat but brother the sway the Holy Ghost it raised him up from the grave it does the same thing today it's still the same power it produces the same results here today don't believe that well if you don't I do this was grounds that belong to the believer when they came out of there on the day of Pentecost they came out of there they were quickened they were made alive they went in there cowards they were afraid hello somebody but they came out of there and Peter remember Peter who is the spokesman he's the one when he was asked before hey you hang around with him hey I think you know him hey don't you believe what he teaches oh I don't know him and yet this is the same man that said I'll go and I'll die for you it shows self-will is no good his heart wasn't surrendered but rather when he came out of that upper room that was not anything his daddy could do his momma can do it want anything Peter could do the only thing they can do is present themselves as the word was calling them to present themselves and that's all you and I can do is a percent ourselves as God would lead us and it requires God to come on the scene and for him to perform the word rather the rapture in the glowing of the church it's not our efforts and I'm gonna make the rapture happen and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna make it do this be careful your heads gonna bust you're not gonna do nothing but yet God is calling you and you submit yourself to the word and that same God that's changing you where the Spirit of the Lord is changing you from glory unto glory unto glory in a moment in a twinkling of an eye because we believe that it quickened their language is that right the things that they were talking about it quickened it I think of one brother we had to it was that the men's retreat you just say the testimonies that comes to me my brother down a down in beach not South Carolina we were at the men's retreats a few years ago and they said they said yeah brother brother Mike used to like to ride Harley's he said Ben I don't know I don't know he just he don't like riding harleys no more he likes riding you know motorcycles and they said brother Mike said the truth of the matter was he said he's not that he said that I just I got rid of Harley's or I stopped he said I just got so tied up with the Lord that that took precedence over the motorcycles you see it ain't something that you have to give up I hope you hear me this morning well I gotta give this something I gotta get you don't got to get nothing up let him take let him do what he alone can do it's like a person said you know one time you know that a person come through you know the where I was teaching and man they were announcing you know that older lady and she said hey Sam she said happy hour has that sense such a time first of all that shot me to death I didn't know teachers drink shot me to death you know she came through she said Sam she said happy hours are setting such a time I looked her she's about 73 74 years old I looked at her I said Betty I said I'm a Christian I don't drink I am - I said well that is all I know I can tell you is what he did for me I said everything that's alright he left it alone but what was it he took you with me it ain't what I had to do it's what he did we might be on this for months the quickening power he'd come down there I tell you it you know it behooves us friends listen the life is what is important people can no doctrine still they know doctors do they know doctors and they don't know Jesus what good does all the doctrines do if you don't know him the doctrines only create fences come on somebody because the doctrine itself is the bark on the tree and the bark is to protect the life you don't want to become insulated with doctrine against the light you want to received alive and the live will bring the bark in the right place glory oh my they received you see they had a title deed Jesus gave them a title deed I mean you never bought a house on about five of you I know it's more than that some of you woke up on that but they go through the whole process and you got to have that deed searched you've got to have it searched when you buy that land that claim of land you've got to have that land searched they have what they call the land title company is that right I know it's another line on the mortgage paperwork more money but yet they go through there and they search everything out so see are there any liens on the deed and if there's any liens on the deed there is no transfer of property until the liens are taken care of those you know you've brought existing property you buy a house you know what please don't let you be no existing liens because then you know you got to go to the owner or do whoever and try to you know finagling everything else hey will you pay the $500 water bill you got on this house you know I'm saying or this $5,000 back taxes will you brother there was a lease that was on this deed liens that were on the deed where even those who died and had rent there with the promises in mind and here they were they were in paradise but brother they win fair rent by revelation as they would offer at the lam and when that deed was cleared paradise was done away with when the deed was cleared you see his blood was shed on Calvary he went to the lowest parts of hell he dropped and deposited sin he put it back on the one who brought it in the beginning he ascended up he led captivity captive come on now he led captivity captive what was it it was a parade of triumph the mighty Conqueror had went there in the midst of Hale and Hale could not hold him there there weren't enough demons to keep him there amen the price had been paid he was the Madi Conqueror the Living God was there and he ascended back up he led captivity captive and then he began to announce to the disciples who were there he began to announce to them the deed that belonged to them the Bible says in John 1:12 as many as received him to them gave he the power to become the sons of God that word power is the right to become are you with me it was not that's not the same word as acts 1:8 he had he had to give them the right you see you got to know what your rights are come on now we're living in an age right now people's rights but their rights they want to put them right down your throat they want you to accept their immorality Varon calling us their sin they want you to call their sin good they're right we're living in that age of people's rights now listen if that's the spirit there that's on the AIDS look at the contrast of that it is an hour where remember the Bible says in Romans 8 that the earth is groaning and travailing it is longing for the manifestation of the sons of God brother what has been seven Sabbath's down through the church ages it was the promise in this hour that God would restore us back to as it was on the day of Pentecost where he himself was given a pure undefiled bride a bride that was fully matured where Christ Himself veiled himself in her I say what power is in this life you with me it went in to the grave and the dark ages but the grave couldn't hold it it came up here in the hour that we're living in and now the Holy Ghost returning now in full power full maturity over the Church of the Living God why it's time to go back home it's time for rapture it's time to be changed the ministers are right all right a title deed but within that title deed it's got to be cleared believing get you the title deed believing is not the abstract hello somebody Paul said it and that's 19 have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed that in Ephesians 1:14 you were sealed after that you heard the gospel of your salvation after that you believed you see you first have to have a trumpet that would sounds to you and I and lets us know what belongs to us I remember hearing my wife and I you know the first time after I'd stepped away from teaching you know I was used to that I guess I didn't know I had a Cadillac insurance plan when I talked yes I did and we're in the hospital I thought Lord here's the first hospital here's the first thing of course I have a there's a share ministry we use it it's the Lord I'm looking at it sometimes you don't realize why you're in places that you're in sometimes we look at the situations we're in and we just look at the situation instead of looking at saying the Lord is there something you want to give to me while I'm right here and Here Come a little here come a lady she was filling out you know she's asking us all these questions and things and stuff I've never had to do before and you know filling out all this paperwork and everything and and then as we're talking about it and you know she let me know the prices on the drugs and what's coming up and finally she says um so here's a little card she said do you know about this I said no what is that she said this card she said if you take this she said now you got to present it every time she said but it will give you a discount on your prescriptions something like 70% off or something like that I don't remember exactly what it is but then you know I wouldn't even wear something existed like that I had already paid amounts on certain prescriptions already but you know what somebody made me aware of what I had I didn't even realize I I could have that but rather now that I know what I had when I left that hospital and I went to fill them prescriptions I took that card and I showed them that card because you know what somebody presented something to me and they said you can have this this is rights I took that and presented that and you know what I've been benefited from it ever since somebody's got to tell you what is for you and if you know what what kind of a person would that have been if they would always held that from me what would that have been that would have been nobody that wanted to help me that would have been somebody just want to get the paperwork done come on I want to get on my I want to get on to the lunch break I want to get on to this or I want to get on to that but brother and sister that's why I'm telling you that the ministering of the gospel and when God puts that spirit of the Holy Ghost within your life it is no longer you about you but your heart it beats for the kingdom of God it desires to see others that they will know that same Liberty that you have come to know and you might have to take a little bit of time you may not be able to get into scriptures with them hello somebody you might just have to be a living witness right there hey man come on down and be God in flesh to them I'm gonna tell a little something here I hope it's all right about a year before brother Aaron his sister Amanda before they had ever come to the Lord before they come over here they come over to our house when they came over to our house you know they left after they left her house my wife won't mind this if she does she could skimmin we get home but my wife said honey she said you and shouldn't we have you know you know been talking you know man and bringing some more things up about you know with the Lord and things like I think that's a right way she'll correct me when I get home any huh I'm just she's real good to me she's easy homey but you know I told her I said but honey I did I said everything you can you can you can ask brother brother Aaron and sister man when the things that I would talk with in the conversation I would say the Lord said the Lord did this the Lord did that brother he wants something I had to reach back into scriptures back here and going back to there and go through some teaching but let it be a present tense God let it be the presence of the Living God is the Lord leading me the Lord said this the Lord directed this brother people are hungry for reality amen let them experience the reality then you can get it to the Bible studies you with me let them experience the reality is that right glory be to God so I that's why I'm brother Bram said you don't ever go up to somebody he said here's a man on a roof he said it he's using a hammer and he said that man's using that Henry said and you've got an automatic nailer he said you don't run up to the man and say you don't got nothing you don't got what I got no what you got nobody wants I'll take a smash thumb over top of that not over what you're offering come on now but you see it's the present to them and say man you could you do a really nice job with him nails you're a real good job come on I'm not gonna read the quote word by word I don't have it in front of me just pulling into my heart right now but you see begin to say mind that's you know that's wonderful in it but then you say have you considered this and begin to show them and that's why your brother Ben told us he said ain't nothin wrong with the Holy Ghost we've got sometimes he said it's the way we presented it ain't nothin wrong with it it's the way sometimes that it's been presented him and you see what they've had listen friends what somebody has don't take from them only add to it come on now what Luther had was not all of it there was a lot of wrong there was a lot of wrong ideas that was in there but yet there was truth that was there when God sent further life he did not take from he added to glory be to God in the highest my mama so this promise of the Holy Ghost it this is our inheritance it brings us to this place to the promise that we would have in him back to the grounds of the belief what belongs to us that of that of eternal life now I want you to think of this go with me to John chapter 8 for a moment John chapter 8 John chapter 8 now notice here Jesus the Bible says in verse 30 as he spake these words many believed on him then jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free you know and he's letting them know you're in bondage now these were religious come on now righteous men you couldn't put a finger on their lives ooh and Jesus let him know you need to be free then they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we're never in bondage to any man how say us now you shall be made free Jesus said verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed I know that you are Abraham's seed but ye seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you Jesus let him know I know you're Abraham's seed now remember what Jesus is announcing to them if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed he's announcing to them the jubilee that is coming that there is a Liberty that is coming to you there is a Liberty that is going to come forth but yet they themselves said we don't need to be free we're already free they were in bondage they did not realize that they themselves that in jolt to the coming of the Holy Ghost that was for them they needed to be set free but here's the stance that they took on it they took on it that their natural birth as though everything of who they were and what they had done that somehow that that qualified them that they were free but they were not free they were still born in sin and they needed to be born again they needed to be born again I don't care how much message they knew I don't care how much of the Scriptures they know come on somebody I don't care how many experiences they had they needed to be born again amen they needed a new life to come on the inside and Jesus told them there they did what was right they believed on him but brother just believing on him did not bring them into Liberty it was the pathway they had to keep walking that pathway you see here you find there's a difference Jesus here is he's speaking the sons of Abraham are you with me these are guys that could say I'm circumcised Abraham is my father there go through everything sons of Abraham in the natural but yet when the word was standing before them the very one that was standing before them that visited their father Abraham right here in this same chapter Jesus let him know he said Abraham saw me in his day is that right he saw him that visitation where he came there in Genesis 18 and God took upon a flesh body are you with me now he saw that visitation and look how Abraham responded there when the Lord visited look I responded in every chapter when the Lord was visiting him in lights and dreams and on and on and every time watch how Abraham would surrender and give of himself and Jesus let her know you are not responding to me the way that Abraham did they could say Abraham our Father my father's father my father's father's father's father he taught us this we know the word and Jesus said search the Scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they aren't they that testified me brother he took what was a promise and made it a present-day fulfillment the devil don't care how many times that something is kept in the past or how many times a promise is put in the future what stirs the house of hell is when the promises become present tense in the heart of the believer brother that's what upsets hell and that's to when the Holy Ghost came the devil hit his snooze button on his alarm I'm not gonna read the quote but I paraphrase it he didn't even get out of bed they had been filled with the Holy Ghost but when they walked by the gate called beautiful and the life that was now inside of them the same one that had healed the sick before the same one that had raised the dead the same one that had casts out the Devils that same God now that the sacrifice had been received and accepted all glory now that the sacrifice has been accepted there was a sounding that went out and let him know this sacrifice has been accepted they looked on that man at the gate called beautiful silver and gold such as I have I don't have any but rise up take up thy bed and walk brother branham tells us he said that's when the devil got mad why because the life was being expressed through the believer that life was being his friend Emma just say like this the devil don't care how much Holy Ghost you got if you don't surrender if you don't let him be preeminent in your life if you don't look at in your life and say Lord take anything out of the way that's hindering Lord is there anything that's hindering the expression of the Holy Spirit through my life hallelujah you weren't born to torment hell hallelu glory be to God hallelujah the Bible said he's the surf and brucer and if we are bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life then as he was a serpent bruzer so is the bride to be a serpent bruzer truly be the god I'm telling you your code to put your foot on demons your cloud to put your foot on uncleanness and ungodliness rather you're called to delete all them socks and put your foot down come on somebody you're called to live a godly life that's a right that's arrived you say Lord this is my right I surrendered [Applause] when that sounding went forth I'm trying to close here when that sounding went forth of that trumpet you know what the trumpet was for it was to declare by the sounding the blood has been accepted others that were in this place not everybody was right there the priest had to ride throughout the land and blow the trumpet that's why Jesus could say go you therefore preaching the gospel right how shall they hear unless there be a preacher let me tell you something you may not have the gift in your life to be a preacher but if you have the gift of the Holy Ghost you can let him preach right through your life it declares the victory of Calvary brother it's a witness you're able to reach places that hear that ministers were high myself could never go but you see God wants your life as a witness God wants your life as a testimony you write you with me hey Li Chen Li Chen wanted to get on the boat with Jesus Jesus said no no Legionnaire I don't know what he called our Lord what his name was and we get to the side we'll know but you but you you understand just for sake of time here he told him he said go on back to your friends and go on back to your family go on back to your neighbors okay brother David Horner comes to my mind right now he said he'd tell me in the testing when he's outside dear Lord my neighborhood got quieter and he said every behind my neighborhood boy that everybody got little nicer and a little quieter brother Jerry now stream now I want everybody else if you got changed you heard you were the instrument in the calls of all that disturbance and everything else but you see what the power of it is when God takes a hold of a live brother that's a paradox that sounding of that event that trumpet would go forth it would sound throughout there of all the land and God has equipped to be a witness mama you may not you may not feel like well I'm not getting out here as much like that but God's equipped you to sound that out in your home he's equipped you to sound that out as a testimony that the atonement has been accepted and the life of the atonement has come is their right to keep them to keep our children under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost as the Prophet said you be the Holy Ghost until the Holy Ghost comes right to keep them under that of the atonement we're just gonna stop because there's just so much I don't even but I hope you I hope how I hope he made sense of it today for you the tribulus sounded when that sound goes forth that man when that sounds the man who has whatever instrument in his hand maybe he's holding in the field this is what his master has told him he went to bed that night he got up the next morning still back on the same here come sound of the Jubilee brother when that sound come he didn't have to ask the master do you think I could lay this down there was a greater authority than his master his master had to recognize the authority of that sounding brother what was his master was no longer his master that trumpet sounded he could throw down that garden hoe whatever it was he could let it go he could walk out of that we could walk right out of that field he didn't have to ask that master do you think I can go a little bit do you think I can do this he didn't have to ask nobody's permission he had received authority to come back to his inheritance and that's what the Holy Ghost does it sounds out to a man's heart it sounds out to a woman's heart and lets them know there's something you're missing there's something you're missing in life there is a greater life I'll tell you here this morning if you've still got a devil's instrument in your hand you've got authority to throw that thing down you with me oh brother Samuel ha I can't get out of here to go do this and go do that you don't need to get out of here to go do this and go do that he can take care of it right here he can take care of it right here but where your faith has to be is that he has already finished the work brother saying I'm not worthy it's not about your worthiness it's about his worthiness you understand I'm not talking about traps brother and sister I'm talking about where there's things are still bondage they ought to be there ought to be enough well we'll get into the end of you there ought to be some discernment within that right there you see bondage is where you're still held captive and you're not free from it but there is one to liberate you from it and when you're held captive it's not a trap but he who is said to liberate you he's able to loosen that hold on your life don't let the devil tell you well I got a pack this instrument around with me the rest of my life he's a liar I said he's a liar well I received this from this and I received this from this and I received this from this we need to look back to the atonement the Lord Jesus Christ there is no weakness in the atonement but in their strength there's power there's glory there's honor you with me I think of our when you look in in your life sometimes you look at things and think well I've been a failures this or I've been this or I've been that let that be a has-been let it be a has-been walk in that Liberty that he he gives if you started walking for God and the Lord's draw in your life and you got off the pathway somewhere you got off the pathway it's time to get back on it it's time to say Lord I want to come back I want to come home I don't want to just I don't want to just come to church you know many times people come to church and that's all they do see I thought she was gonna stop preaching I was but the preacher wants to preach some people just want to come to church you know why that's a satisfying of a religious duty serving God is not religion it's serving the Living God it's not just coming to a church once a week or twice a week or whenever you feel like coming to church it's about serving part and delighting yourself in the things of God just to come here on Sunday and pray for me brother Samuel but I'll make it on Sunday how about asking God say lord give me such a strength Lord in my life Lord God give me such an anchor in my life give me such a joy give me such a stability hallelujah you're asking for big things because he's a big God I'm not preaching my textbook I preach in my experience I know him to be Viv's I've been to ask him at times restore to me the joy of thy salvation not just once or twice I've had to ask him many times lord give me strength Lord love God encourage me Lord God wants your life to be full of his joy Jesus said I prayed that your joy might befall he said ask that your joy might be for brother if he already prayed for it if he's already asked for the joy to be fooling us I think we ought to ask what he decides for us to have no I want the fullness of joy in my life David said I will serve thee because I love thee thou has given life to me thy loving-kindness is better than life there's a trumpet that sounds there's a real reality that sounds now let me tell you what this reality does when it rings down into your soul it's not something that you can ever get away from it changes you it takes the fear of ever falling out of your life are you with me why because there's a change that moves down on the inside the devil might try to bluff you and tell you oh it's just this you're just worked up and you're just that but you know by that voice that's coming in you know that there's a life that stands in resistance against that you know that there's something in you that resists that very thing it says that is not the truth the life has found what do you think I ought to do well I think you ought to go into your contacts list and take the devil out of your favorites that's what I think you ought to do the other thing I think you ought to do is block him and let you know your favorites is only declared by what you use the most come on now and let it you say well what I want Jesus to be right back up their own favorite this start using it I said start using it start talking about him start claiming what belongs to you start crying out for it start asking him this is our Jubilee it's a real Jubilee it's something that sets you free it's something that loosens you were you no longer trying many of you know exactly what I'm talking about were you tried I tried well I'm just gonna get rid of this and I'm just gonna get rid of that and I'm just gonna get rid of this but if it's still here it'll come back but once you get it out of here brother hello somebody that's where he matters too many times the applying of the token is just simply been kicking stuff out of the house but a wrong house get this house first you get it in this house first let me just say it very clearly where the token is being let down you need to get it back up hello somebody we need to get it back up get the block back on the door amen get the blackk back on the door applying the blood of what it is you're looking at what it is you're talking about get the blood applied in your life and keep it applied daily little by little little things can erode the joy in your life little things that somehow you look at and you think oh it's so minimal well this is nothing and this is nothing and little by little by little that little that little insect keeps eating the way keeps eating away keeps eating away keeps eating away but brother you've got to stand against that apply the blood what has been accepted say God I want to live in my full inheritance I want to live in a full inheritance and they sounded that trumpet I don't care where a man or his family I don't care how far gone they was I don't care how much in debt they was it didn't matter if they heard that trumpet the servants that were in Israel it meant nothing to him but those who were born a Jew hello somebody they were born a Jew they could be expecting the Jubilee to come are you with me and when that jubilee sounded if they could hear and they would hear what that trumpet sounded the servant you know just a church joiner hello servant is a church joiner you can't join the church there's nowhere in the scripture says you joined the church nowhere but it says you are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ by the Holy Ghost you are always a part of it you just didn't know it but it takes the Holy Ghost to make it real to you and to bring you in to your inheritance you with me but here the son a son could hear it he was born a son he could hear that sound just drop stopped going he could reach over and take his wife's hand and they could take their children's hand let's go back home let's go home well was it the sounding there has been an acceptance you're accepted you can go what they heard their body started manifesting what they heard he started manifesting in action they started walking away from the things that they were in bondage and enslaved to they walked away from that by the authority and all they had to do was believe this is from me it started having an effect in their lives god is good in he his faithful friends don't you let the devil sell you short don't you let him sell you sure young person don't you let him sell you short you've got a full inheritance amen a full life that you can that you can receive Jesus that I'm come that you might have life and you might have it more abundantly beyond imagination that's the meaning of that word he come to set us free no matter what the man had no matter what the family or whatever he could lay it all down and go home he did not have to remain in slavery no more that's what the real working of the Holy Spirit brings to a life it turns you back home it brings you back home again it brings you to your inheritance amen I'm so glad about that aren't you it's a real sounding in our lives you can just in your eyes with with the eyes of your heart if you can just look away from all of your circumstances if you can just look away from yourself and just look away to Jesus you can look to him who is your all sufficiency he's already made away you say brother Samuel IRA CI I believe he did that then won't you accept it won't you accept what he's already done for you and say Lord I receive that pardon in Greece I accepted I accept if you haven't repented repent turn has a Holy Spirit turn your heart this is where you turn and say Lord forgive me of my sins your heart is poured out before him Amen if you haven't walked in the waters of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is the time to do that this is an acceptable time of the Lord amen this is our Jubilee brother and sister pretty soon we're leaving here we're leaving here there's not another age to come there's not eight Sabbath's this is it come on now it's time to leave it's time here where we are called back to that full inheritance of what we read about in acts 2:1 back to that time and called back now to enter into that land of the body change amen all our salvation is a mirror it's closer it's right here let's bow our heads or Jesus Lord truly as the Bible said through the foolishness of preaching you chose your children's to say it's not the preaching god it's that voice that yielded and your voice behind it that brings the conviction that Lord would lead us as David would say you made known unto us the path of life Lord I pray this morning as we look across Lord this symbol we look in our lives Lord O God how we realize in our lives Oh God Lord were thankful for what you have done we're thankful Lord for what you're doing but lord I pray God for every everyone Lord your God may there not be one Lord that would miss it Lord may father the hearts Lord this morning God there would have to be a hunger you said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled your God there has to be a hunger and a thirst you're the one Lord that creates that Lord you're the one Lord that within man were Lord a man or woman Lord would try to satisfy it with all sorts of things of this worth but nothing can satisfy that thirst man Lord is always trying to attain more and more and more if I do this I'll be happy if I do this I'll be happy if I do this there's no no lasting contentment Lord in those things your God is my heart and Lord it always it cries out more father for every backslider Lord God for every one of your children my prayer God has been and it still is the same let them find no peace in those things Lord let them find no contentment Lord in those things God for the Lord you're the only one that can satisfy you're the only one Lord that that can really it's what real true joy the world cannot offer this joy this joy Lord it comes from you alone it's your life Lord living in the heart of the belief now Lord Lord this morning I've tried to stand here just floor just following you Lord God in the pathways in the directions that you would take us this morning Lord I feel like I've been all over the place but yet I know that God that you've been leading and directing this and lord I pray this morning father that the word Lord that has a spring forth the Holy Spirit delivering that word in the heart Lord I pray God then Lord our hearts I pray your hearts are so moved if there's any Lord this morning Oh God just Lord from the heart said Lord I want to live in my full inheritance I want to occupy the full boundaries thereof Lord I want to possess it Lord like Israel when Israel came into the land they didn't fully possess it [Music] there's things Lord that times they would allow to encroach if there's things Lord that's been allowed to encroach in the land father I pray God as we recognize the land of promise is the Holy Ghost it is this anointed word in this our Lord as you told us in your word grieve not the Holy Spirit we're about you are sealed to the day of redemption father I pray Heavenly Father if their Lord be anything Lord in us that's not right or it's not pleasing to You Lord I ask that you would forgive us Lord I pray God Lord in any area of the life if there's something Lord that's there in that land that does not belong malice don't belong in that land unforgiveness bitterness don't belong in that land that's not the fruits of the life of that land o God made a heart this morning say Lord you're my strength Lord by that water Oh God refill me Lord God with your spirit Lord let the love of God so overflow in my heart Lord that pushes out pushes out on malice of bitterness lack of forgiveness Oh God all of that which Paul would speak of Lord this is our land this is our land of promise God I pray if there's one here this morning that does not have that seal does not have that complete liberty Lord in their life their God we're bondage Lord with the habits of the world it's still about their life I pray this morning God that they would look away from themselves and look to you the Lord they would look to you father and say Lord Jesus you're my atonement Lord you're my strength Lord father by your life Oh God Lord by the Holy Spirit Lord I made a free man a free woman I pray this morning God that you'll take that heart baptize them Lord with the Holy Ghost granite Lord I pray Lord if there's any Lord God that and falling in a trap Lord something Lord that has ensnared them in their life I pray Heavenly Father your God has a brother - a brother a brother Lord - my sister Godfather hold them up Lord before your throne in prayer this morning Lord your God I pray that you would loose [Music] that hole that trap Lord God that ensnare Lord let him see Lord God the power resting Lord in their bosom Lord taught to be able to lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily beset of Lord let it recognize every trick of the death and recognize that greater is he that is in them been he that's in the world father may they not Lord entertain Satan's Bluff may they rise oh god I pray Lord in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of God we ask you Lord Jesus precious name Amen what I want to live fully in my inheritance don't you I want to live fully occupied fully if you see you feel like you've given any ground it's time to retake it it's time to retake that ground amen it's time to rise and say Lord I want to reclaim that ground that belongs to me sometimes you know you go through things and you you have what you call a bad week so what do I do brother Samuel start right now reclaim you reclaim amen the Word of God is true are you with me this morning the Word of God is true traps can be around but the Bible says if we confess our sin he's faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness are you with me we can have faith in knowing that he already did that I don't mean to hold you but I just feel pressed to say that when he was in the Garden of Gethsemane brother and sister he made the all-sufficient surrender and he went to Calvary and he paid for the past sins present sins and future sins he paid for it all you can rise within that sometimes you may not be holding a hoe as it was but there might be condemnation that wants to circle over your head you've got authority by the atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ to walk free you with me if we're stand on his word if we have followed all that he has asked us to do and we're standing on that word then God is there to back that word up he's there to make it alive within our lives you understand what I'm saying you can't get anywhere with living in the past you can't get nowhere you've got to look we're today today in the past let it be in the past amen let it be in the past repent of that let it let it go and let him bring you sometimes the enemy can come and try to bring all sorts of other things and accusations and everything things you've already repented of throughout your life you say why would he try to do that he'd try to do that just even before you'd come into a service like this we tell you something he's a mighty hunter that's how they described Nimrod Nimrod was a mighty hunter he knew how to late traps and if he can lay a trap like that to where you're focused on yourself you miss the liberty what can give you the strength to live above that the strength the encouragement the confidence [Music] you love him that's time this morning I want more of him I want more of him I want more of the love of God in my life is that what you want I want more of the Holy Ghost I want more of the
