could say it's not either liveth but yea it is Christ who liveth in me the life I now live in this flesh I now live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me that is that is such a blessed reality that moves within our hearts greater and greater don't you love him it's it is just so real to think of it of how that God's grace here we are we stand another you know another year another time you know but yet it within it all God's grace it has and it is sufficient I'll tell your friends I really believe more and more the longer that we as we journey along and when we stand there on that day we are going to realize just how little that we had to do with it and how much it has been him all the way the only thing he asks us to do is yield and allow him to perform and accomplish in us what he has already seen and declared as a finished work may God just help us amen so good to be here tonight good to be gathered together amen in the presence of the Lord tonight amen where anything can take place everything all things are possible and as believers were given three words to abide by believe watch and pray amen so whatever you need is tonight God already knows what you need no matter if it's something that just arose today he already provided to be able to minister to that need before there was an Adam Stardust or molecule and he is able tonight no matter where you stand or you sit you might be looking and say God I know what you I know what the promise says and what you have made and who you are but just be faithful and stand right there and watch the RAM come on the scene watch God manifests himself as Jehovah Jireh tonight once again so good to have brother Daniel here with us and brother Daniel my brother friend and brother Daniel we've known but the Daniel and I've known one another now for I believe it's been 12 years and so God has made such a way for our brother to be able to visit with us each time that he's come here in the States and brother Daniel is just a real blessing to us as an assembly the gift that God has placed in his life and we just want to look to the Lord tonight and draw from the Lord tonight knowing that God already has prepared what we have need of amen so let's just as we turn our hearts and our our lives completely looking to the Lord let's just sing that song turn your eyes upon Jesus as we invite brother Daniel if you'll come on brother [Music] you know turn your eyes upon Jesus it's more than just these eyes right here you know the Bible says we walk not by faith and we walk not by a sight but by faith but sight isn't just this it's feelings it's all things that come in this realm and when we sing this song you turn your eyes upon Jesus I believe with all my heart it's turning our hearts eyes it's turning everything let everything loose let it be focused on the Lord no matter what your feelings say you doubt your doubts and believe God's Word above all things and everything else we look to Jesus who's the author and the finisher of our faith so let's just tonight let's join our hearts together in faith and look to the Lord tonight could we just sing this together turn your [Music] [Music] yes [Music] Oh [Music] stray [Music] Oh one more time turn your eyes Oh you're Oh [Music] it is one [Music] hallelujah we tangoed that such a blizzard time that we are living in the only place or the only way we can turn our iPhone is Jesus Christ and we really appreciate what the Lord is doing for us and we know that all efforts by His grace that we are putting forth also to make sure that this message travel the length with God have ordained that very soon everything will be over and so in the midst of all this the only one that we have to continue to channel my own is Jesus Christ so brothers and sisters tonight I am very happy to be with you again as brother someone have just said that is always a pleasure and desire to come around where believers are so that we will share the common bread which is the bread of life from heaven amen and today let me quickly say that my family and I changed back home as telia greetings to all of you Alleluia and so without wasting my time tonight I know that you say we should all live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of his mouth so tonight we are looking on to the Lord Jesus Christ to give us what our so neat amen shall we just be on our feet now for a moment of prayer of which after what a nama scriptures to either chapter 66 let's pray father we thank you Lord tonight for your grace we saw suffice chain of father for us we are doing lord I will lift D high you Lord you made us to see the rising of the Sun and a setting of eight Lord we have come under your feet to feed upon your weight we therefore pray Lord that your message will continue to take us and usher us into your way let your spirit Oh father come tonight let it come and open the way to Lord and tell your people what you want them to hear all King of Kings and lot of laws I know without you there's nothing that we can do therefore Lord us we have found favor in thy presence tonight let everything be done according to your will father anything contrary Lord Jesus let it be far away from us and we ask you to grant message journey mercies O Lord to those that are here to reach here Heavenly Father that in the end will glorify your mighty name as we see your word manifesting and fulfilling your desire in our lives we thank you Father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen as a chapter 66 we are read in verse eight to but I'll stay team he says who have heard such a thing who has seen such things shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall a nation be born at once for as soon as as I won't reveal she brought forth her children shall I bring to the bay and not cause to bring forth see at the Lord shall I cause to bring forth and shut the womb saith thy God rejoice ye with Jerusalem and be glad with her all ye that love they rejoice for joy with hay all ye that moon for her the Emmis suck and we satisfied with a breast of a constellations they mmm milk out and be delighted with abundance of a glory for thus saith the lord behold I was ten peace to her like a river and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream then shall ye saw here shall be borne upon his sights and be done though upon her needs as one whom his mother comforted so will I comfort you and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem they the Lord Artus blessing to the reading of his way shall we have our seat well tonight we are we want to speak on a short topic travail of Zion travel of Zion the just the Bible that we have just read is telling us about how Zion travailed and when they don't reveal she brought forth her children amen when we talk about Rockville I think that their sisters who understand it better because meaning of travel it just well if you check the dictionaries need to have a lot a lot of you know definitions of it some say is a sexy excessive pain you know some say that is unfavorable condition you know and others also say that it is something that is hardship okay but I like the other one that says that is just a Libba pain or Beth pain that is Travie Alleluia you know so it's not something that that is you know just light you know rumor around preaches someone it a little bit peens yeah it is where something is getting from one condition to another you know it brings such you know terrible condition upon a being and this one is not your child but Israel travel travel of Zion hallelujah now so we realize that we are talking about Libba pain or childbirth is not something easy and for our club for the assistance yes sir because they understand what I'm talking about right now in fact the sisters who have brought forth who have gone through that condition we see so many so many sometimes in fact we've had pity for them we we feel for them because it's not easy our brother is not easy at all okay so you have to tell God that you're not a woman it's not easy when they carry their children it will come to a time they do if you fail to eat because the moment the food enters into the baby have to bring it out a whole lot of Pinot condition which is not favourable you know and you see oh brother sister I know you know what I'm talking about Alleluia and that is what we call travel amen but the real trouble is when it is time for the child to come when it is time for a bath to come that is where the real trouble comes that is why the bubbly say that as soon as I own travail she brought forth her children amen amen and we know by history that during 1917 during the First World War I think that was the first time that even even you know right that was the first and the Jews started going back to the homeland because but then the prophecy of Jesus Christ has already been fulfilled they say that Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles okay and they will be scattered all over the world and the property said until the Gentile days are fulfilled so would realize that they were scattered when the rock Tytos beseech the whole place and you know they were able to scatter everybody and broke everything down and all the Jews scattered all over the world my aunt a 1917 instead of going back why because Zion travailed according to Isaiah I said Wednesday on travail you bring you bring forth a children so they went back to nineteen nineteen seventeen back to the island and you know what happened they are born through so many experienced war here were there a little nation fighting about seven nations at the same time you know because it was time that you should go back and take the island in fact the prophecy of Jesus Christ did not say that they will remain in the Gentile world okay they will go back and take possession and we all know that brother sister and today as Jerusalem is in the hands of Israel we all believe and we all know that they will not share it with any other nation hallelujah you know because things are happening you know and it's like nothing is happening okay because God for that matter revealing himself did not do it outside or publicly he did it in a secret place and the revelation is for only the bread of Jesus Christ that is why many things are happening in the world even a political circle and people don't know what they mean but you and I at least we know something is happening amen you know so when they won't reveal she brought forth her children amen I've already stated that I'm not a politician and I don't think I'll be one oh no and I know you're not like also to be a politician hallelujah but in the political cycle brother/sister many things are happening that did themself do know what they are doing in a canoe imagine okay can you imagine that just last year the Zima on the system is Emma the president declared euro solemn as a capital of Israel you know that well you may not like that man and I'm not saying that you like him you understand I don't vote in America so it cannot ask me Brad Daniel do you will you'll vote for the man again oh I don't know I don't have my boots here but you see no matter what no matter how people talk about him no matter how people insult him I'm stating again that I'm not a politician I'm not doing political campaign but at least that man have done something that picture on my heart hallelujah for standing alone in declaring Jerusalem as a so capital of the Israelite amen this was something that God was looking for because Jerusalem must be restored back to the Jews for the preparation of the coming of the Messiah a man a name on the Seas of the Zima last year remember the domicile system a number of a man and no matter of was that that the twelfth man is also restoration so Jerusalem was restored hallelujah by a man hallelujah by a man to fulfill the Scriptures you say what do you like it or not it is declared hey man we know that others came the promise or desk and the promise they were not able to do it but another one has come and has done it it taste to mine joy because Israel as a nation must have the capital where it started they want travail let us look to that place that thing that they have gone through here were they amen and amen God is always looking for that because everything must be in this position the Word of God can never be chopped off everything must be in his position Jerusalem will never be shared among the Jews and any other nation whether you believe it or not there is no politics this is Bible preached the name of our God and today look at what is happening many people are afraid to support that cause many nations were afraid to support that cause but well I remember the bonus of the University or mother or to the UN that time she said America don't need any nation to back her in declaring Jerusalem as the capital of the image because Zion of already travail and a bubble say that when they travail should bring forth her children amen Jerusalem was their capital before they were scattered all over the world so if they have come to take their land they must take Jerusalem amen yes sir and what I love here brothers and sisters is not it is not calling Jerusalem that is going to rejoice he's not only the Jews or the Israelites but a Gentiles are good to rejoice together with them amen now he says what is that shall I bring to bed and not cause to bring forth see her the Lord shall add cause to bring forth and shut the wound feared thy God rejoice ye with Jerusalem and be glad with her all yeah they'll love it rejoice for joy with her and yay that not for her hallelujah you remember that God told Abraham he said whoever blesses you I'll bless you whoever causes you I'll catch the person now said the Lord and God have not run away from that word alleluia and acetates his people are always looking towards he's coming amen he says what then were enjoined with you so if Jerusalem is rejoicing then we are also to be rejoiced we have to rejoice because he enjoys our joy you know what I'm happy about because very soon we are going to see the Amaziah that is why the Jerusalem has been restored to them they are preparing themselves to receive their Messiah but before the Messiah will come to them you and I we must go to the palace that is why I'm happy I'm not fed up with the thing that is going on in this world I do not further with the condition of the society hallelujah that any place that you tend your army holds sinful niches I know fed up with us hallelujah that is why I pray that he should come to his his people but before that the Gentile bride must go to the palace a man named me Oh hallelujah brother he says rejoice you with Jerusalem and be glad with it all yet that love rain rejoiced for driver there and yay that moon for her the yen the shock and be satisfied with the breast of her constellations ah the yen a sock and be satisfied with the breast of a consolation you know remember that there was a time that bra drama saying that he came to a time that God has to put Abraham on his bosom and nest Abraham from his breast Oh hallelujah because their child sucked the breasts of the mother to gain strength that is where the joy of the child is that is where the liberty of the child is and in any mother love to do that in the mother who had to see the child crying okay so the child have a consolation respond translation on the breast of the mother that is why Jehovah became Jehovah el shaddai hallelujah and in this era from his breast and now the Prophet is saying that the yam is shocked and be satisfied with the breasts of a constellation Alleluia so the joy of the Jews is the joy of the gentle bride hallelujah if you bless them out bless you if you can't them out kiss you does share the Lord so in order today we are going to see a dress of consolation but they will not stock it alone but you are going to stock with them Oh hallelujah I remember that the doctors say that when when a woman puts the child on hill or ants and the child is you know shocking the breast the mother look to the face or the eyes of the child and the child also looked to the eyes of the mother and it generates a kind of unity love hallelujah so right now do you know what is happening we are looking into the eyes of God and God is looking into our eyes God is looking into the eyes of the Israelite and they are looking inside eye of God and it's full of joy all over oh brother my sister man we want that kind of love amen we want that kind of consolation and we thank God that we have Malachi for be made manifest in our lives to bring the consolation to us to bring that Liberty to us to bring that joy to rush oh my amen and amen he said Diana not out and be delighted with the abundance of a glory o for thus said the Lord behold I will extend peace to her like a Reba and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream - a Leah saw ye shall be borne upon his sides and be done --dl upon her knees see the women the mothers they put their child in your arms like this and it download them and they sing some sweet songs you know to cuddle the children and you see that should I be lovely because you are done deal in your child that is exactly what God is going to do us or he is doing us right now we are in his hands and his dungeon as on its knees oh brother sister don't you like this don't you like to be in the arms of God tonight hallelujah don't you like to be daunted by the mightiness of God oh brother it's very good Alleluia now we are in joy we are enjoying ourselves in the process of God we are in full enjoyment of the sister right now other Holocaust would over us there is not our mind is not our power but is what what I would deign before the foundation of the world amen i tangled that you pulled me out from the false church because this is the only place that we can have our joy now so let's continue he says as one as whom as one whom his mother comforted so will i comfort you and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem amen and one thing I want you to be aware is that us the nation or for that matter that city Jerusalem I'll be given to the Israelites I am sure would know Mahad that no nation will be able to take it again from them no no no no no now that those things are over no nation is going to be able to take it from them oh my praised be the name of our God that is why today they have fortified themselves you know no something came around I think about two months ago about some you know artilleries that you know they are prepaid they say in 15 years time do not cross the ibadis to fight the enemies perhaps why because they are fortified themselves okay and today we know that every nation is afraid of the other Amen so if you want to attack any nation you have to know what you are doing you have to be sure of what we are going to do but you can't play around Israel at this time hallelujah because she travailed and when she traveled she brought forth her children and if the children are back to the island whatever they are preparing via whom then the thing that went on wrong they are preparing it they are building it back amen and we know that this travel of Zion for the nation to be born we know that it fell under the Feast of Trumpets you got it yeah because that was what brought them from all over the missions and you know the we went under the Feast of Trumpets and we know what happened so many was here and they about seven nation at a time fighting this little nation but by the intervention of God they were able to defeat all the enemies Olivia so it was the Feast of Trumpets that brought them together to fulfill Jesus Christ prophecy and Luke 21 say Jerusalem shall be trodden down by the Gentiles and the whole place will be scattered all over until the Gentile days are fulfilled and so when we saw them going back it means a trumpet as blew and it was gathering all that people from all over the world if you read Isaiah chapter 43 you see this one come from the Sun someone come from the know they're not the east and the west and he said I would tell them not to give up amen I would tell them not to give up well not back so they came from all over the place to build the mission Israel amen you know that was it but we see they didn't just let the feasts of pentacles they rejected it when the power came they rejected it and that is why the Lord God used that period to prepare the gentle bride oh praise be the name of our God 15 years in all of the period that takes that the Pentecost office know it God brought it to build a Gentile bride of which you are and I am also one of the amen you see but when the time came for the trumpet to blow for them to go back the bubble must be more fulfilled exactly as Hosea said let's quickly read hosea chapter 6 yeah who's there chapter 6 he says come let us return unto the Lord for he has torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days will he revived us in the ten day he will raise us up and we shall live in a sight my god he thought so it was a doing of God you know the Bible say that they were blinded for our sake because of you insisted my eye they were blinded not that they don't want it so that we will come in so they were blinded that therefore therefore this we praise to God for what he has done for us it was not in your intention but it was ordained by God so that we'll get a chance of taking our position now we are taking our position in the Lord before we are going to receive the atonement so Hosea say that he had gone and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up he started us all over the world by you bring us back again after two days and of course they're not yesterday Wednesday and today toss they know but after two thousand years amen after two thousand years after two days we'll here invite us and that is why we saw the revival coming in the life of the Jews when they we started going back to the homeland it was a revival it was a travel because travel brings Reviva to bring them back home and he says in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight and today we see the way and when Israel is reached well I don't know whoever who believe that but that machine is Rhys there are a lot of things that they do to support the whole world many many many many things that we do even have the idea that it was coming from that place it's raged he's saying that today we will live in a site and we are in the 10,000 years of Jesus Christ coming dying bury resurrection and ascension we only 10,000 years and a prophecy that in that 10 day we will live in his site so it means they are preparing themselves to receive their Messiah praised be the name of our God and today if the condition is like that in the life of the Jews then wash with a Gentile bride do now we have seen everything fulfilled they are ready not to receive their Messiah but as Joseph put his wife and children in a palace to reveal himself to his brethren so is what would happen when Christ must put us a the rupture to reveal himself to his people what should we do this situation currently she also puts us into a sort of trouble okay a sort of tribal leader that time of jokes brother sister they did not a time a time of pampering the different time that you should slack but this should be a time of serious business hallelujah this should be a time of availability availing yourself for the Spirit of God to use you hallelujah this is the time that we see ourselves always in the presence of God amen and amen they know the time of looking forward ly pleasures did not a time of talking about someone did not a time of destroying somebody sitting by you hallelujah this is not a time of asking yourself the question well I will I go into the rapture or not you ask me that question I don't know Alleluia yeah because sometimes the behavior of the believer you know put certain questions within him or herself in Osseo she is not sure but tonight I want you to be sure of yourself hallelujah I wanted to be sure of yourself Amen that you should not allow some spirits what server to tell you that you are no pot no you are part you apart therefore allow the Spirit of God to put you in a state of travel they love the Lord more than any other team in this world you see yourself always in the presence of God to fill in the scriptures we say Britannia what's preaches is that it's a force ignore the Assembly of the debris together as it has been the manner of son as we see the Day approaching and I always ask what day that's it god bless reveal coming of the Lord that day is fast approaching and there is a condition the Bible said that we should not forsake the assembling of ourselves together that condition should put us into travail that if I don't see my brother I better see my sister I am NOT happy that should be the condition that is the condition that we should pray hard for the track to try the church must try with the blessings that God has given to us amen amen hallelujah we know that the other churches they don't have what we have and it just by the grace of God not that they want it oh yes because many times when I remember Oh God so how did not be your grace also be among those people then I said God I thank you for my life they don't deserve to be there but the condition I put them day so you see what should we do we should rejoice and glorify God for that for soul loving us amen that we we are not lost my brother we have found the way oh my is this listen to what the prophesy say you let to know what I think the greatest need of the check today well I think the luckiest is and no so tragic their people are not brought up enough that is the thing the Prophet is telling us there is not better simile and you give me someone that just saw tore up about lost souls that they just cry and wanting a river so bad till they can hardly eat they just simply can't amen you see brother and sister you should understand that there should be a condition that who make us not love this current you know situation that we are now there should be a condition he named and we put our so down we put our body down to fight that cause well very soon we are going to see the other chick is chasing us chase us that would you preach what they want they will chase us and tell us that we should come and join them but I know that that is not going to be there's a blessed assurance the professor that the moment they start to do that the rapture will take place ever but that does not mean that we should behave as if we don't know what is going on hallelujah the condition to put us into travail the condition to make us always be a less or what is going to happen us amen and amen he said if you read the history of the world and the religious history you find out it's always taking that kind of a spirit to bring a revival that is right when they don't travail she brought forth her children you have to be taught up it is the atmosphere hallelujah of anything it is atmosphere is it that is why when we are talking about atmosphere and the way and manner you will travailed it brings me back to dead chicken in a shell you see the point first it was an egg they will just put it on fire for about five or ten minutes and bring it out and then you know peel it and gas swallow it but it was put somewhere and there was an atmosphere that changed the condition of the of the egg so other cheek developed in it you can no longer call it an egg can you know because it has moved been an egg to a chicken in a shell so our chicken is in a shell the situation will come to a point that it should not also love to be in a shell lemon and nobody breaks the shell for it it has its own way of breaking the shell you catch it now so there must be a condition and I know there's a condition coming very soon and it's going to break us from this body hallelujah and that is all we are working for yes sir that is going to be a condition brothers is that what are you believe it or not there is going to be a condition and to put us into a trouble and I said this body who break oh yes and you know what when a woman is pregnant well I knew the normal time is nine months is a noted so first month second month Ted man fourth Matt fifth man cysmart seventh month eight month nine mind you realize the Prophet said it the condition of the woman would change so when when she is ready to bring forth the child say the spirit of the child comes upon the woman amen so at that time the woman is being controlled by the spirit college that is the condition so the child who say mummy I am coming out whether you the mother like it or not the baby said I am coming out so that is the time that they will not go through the birth pains she travailed because the child is ready to come out hallelujah oh brother and sister very soon you are going to hear in your ears I am coming to take you into the rapture I am coming to take him into the rapture and this body would give way for the other body to check out hallelujah amen and amen praise be to the name of our God hallelujah sometimes when I think about our Lord Jesus Christ himself in the Garden of Gethsemane or brother system when was time for him to go to the cross the Bible said that he went and prayed Oh father he will be a desire let this cup pass over me but not my will but dying he went to a travail and he prayed until the Bible say that his sweat even turned to blood it wasn't easy he wanted a travel brother because of you and I he was preparing to go

the woman bring forth after that depth that travel or after a bad phase she forgot she forgot what she was going through is not true or not which woman who bring food and would like to bring forth again if they don't forget that thing the pace do you think the Buddha can sell one another child no no nobody would do that I don't want to go to that place again but God took those pains away and that is exactly what we are going through very soon brother sister who forgets all our frustrations he may and Jesus said the generation does see the fig tree having her lives that generation shall not pass according to Matthew chapter 24 this 31 aneasha sent His angels with great son of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of heaven to the other and that is that trumpet that has gone forth and all the elect have been brought back to where they're supposed to be Oh hallelujah he's from one end of heaven to the other now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves ye know the summize 9 so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that it is me even add a pause verily I say unto you this

promise Barbara summer to come and sing for us ah that's beautiful song on a hill far away yes Oh bless us and well sing for me and that wonderful you know you want to you look at many times there's been situations sometimes it's been quite comical where you have people that will call maybe they're in a city or somewhere and they say I'm lost and the first thing that the person on the other end of the phone will ask them where are you the first thing they want to know because they know if you can tell them where you're at how to how to get out of there so then when people say I don't know where I'm at then they start asking them what do you see around you and when they start looking at things that they'll see around them they'll say well I see there's a gas station over here okay what kind of a gas station is it well it's a BP gas station and then okay so what do you see further on down and they'll start to describe it and then they'll maybe what do you see directly across the street so all of these surroundings they begin to describe it to the person on the other end and once the other person on the other end can then start to pick it up and say okay now directly across from that BP maybe to the southwest is there a store like a convenience store and they turn on yeah yeah yeah okay this is where you're at if you'll drive just a little bit this is the street you should see some of you're looking at me like I'm the guy who's done this before but you understand what it is is that you may not know when you would look for where you and I were at there's no way in the world that we knew where we were at in the Word of God but to be able to look and see where we are in God's Word it takes the Lord Himself to come on the scene and to open our eyes to the things that we're seeing and when you begin to look at everything and you know I just was sitting back there tonight I just just so you know it's just tremendous how God it just continues to move upon your heart you look at every one of the things that in this hour of what God has brought to you and I and spoken to us think of even the title of the message your day and it's message and think back to the text that's used for that message is that of how Hosea right there is to learn a parable of the fig tree so it's to see what God is doing there is to recognize what God has been doing and is doing within our lives you realize right now this completion of the work coming into it's completion and finish in our life is a testimony she's coming it is a testimony of what God is doing in spiritual Zion of what's going to happen there in the natural Zion in that wonderful what a day that we're living in what an hour what a time to be in this moment we are living in the coming of the Lord we are living in the fulfillment of that moment what a day what a day amen let's stand and let's sing that song on a hill far away stood I think all drug across on a hill far away stood an old rugged cross

our dedication [Music] and [Music] beep all the promise [Music] on me Sunday [Music] far away where is Gauri [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it [Music] Lord God Alleluia [Music] [Music] I thought about brother branham as he said this to give that dramatization to us from that story he said I was sitting into the parking lot and help came up came a young man and the young man knocked on his door and said Jomon for just a moment acknowledged the young man and he said he began to kind of talk to brother about him a little bit about his situation and he said I'm as lost as a loss can be good brother bana made this great declaration he said you don't have to stay that way you don't have to stay there one of the greatest things is to reach out to help because he is not far off he's right there he's right there you can begin to say Lord Jesus all of this what I sense what I feel what I see and he lets you know this is right where you're at this is how I'm dealing with your life all you have to do is surrender follow the path of life the directions what I've given to you and you'll come out in this wonderful in reality this is what God has made away for you and I'm all mine you've heard that saying sometimes lost more loss than a needle in a haystack but I'm glad that you and I though we were lost and you realize you realize in order to be lost you belong to somebody you belong to somebody like my glasses I cannot lose my glasses unless they are my glasses like when you ask your wife or your husband or ask someone and say honey have you seen this what are you asking for you're asking for what it is that belongs to you and you and I were lost but we've been found we've been found it just like the woman who was sweeping the house looking for the coins that she knew that belonged to her she was sweeping the house making sure because she knew her husband and her husband was returning and she said I need to make sure I find these coins from my tablet because he's coming back she knew they were somewhere in her house she was sweeping it's so real in it that the rapture itself is a sweep and the sweep is for the sweepers the sweep is for the sweepers is making ready for his coming this is all all made possible by the Lord Jesus Christ so no matter where you're at tonight you you might feel like that's a real saying I'm just starting out that in itself doesn't matter what you need to recognize is keep going and allow him that starts the work in you to finish it and let that be your focus of everything let it be more than life just like for those who were Christ has moved into the depths of our life he's more than life to us this is what we're looking for is the change of the body I love that tonight that spirit that comes near that woman then you like that this that little that little spirit of that child brother Graham said that that woman gets real sweet he said you can take a woman that's so cantankerous and everything else you let that he said when she's getting ready to give birth he said that little spirit comes near by I'm going to tell you right now our fee orphanís are very close very my lord I'll tell you what didn't this rejoice our hearts tonight it rejoices our hearts oh my a man our heavenly father has made known to us who that we are Oh my loving tonight no my so thank God for the word how rich how precious how sweet is

Oh God our desire Lord is the woman that was sweeping in the house Lord she wanted all of those coins to be in place for when her husband would return she knew it was in this time she was in travail Lourdes Oh God this is our desire Lord this is our desire Lord there's nothing greater than Lord to stand there that day Oh God and be able to declare from the victory that Lord God that you have brought forth from our life that when you this great one that is among us becomes incarnate and we will crown you the King of Kings and the Lord of lords Oh God to think how the Daniel spoke to never
