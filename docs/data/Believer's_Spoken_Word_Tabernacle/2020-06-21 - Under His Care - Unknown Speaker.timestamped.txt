[39:48] speak to us in a very special way and I
[39:52] believe he died believe he is I believe
[39:54] he'll he's gonna do that for us
[39:56] because we need to hear from him I pray
[39:59] that it'll just be that I'll be able to
[40:02] get out of the way and my voice my voice
[40:04] it's not my voice that matters it's him
[40:07] coming through that voice you know
[40:09] there's a lot of things they heard when
[40:12] the his brother bran would tell us like
[40:15] this when Pearl Harbor was under attack
[40:18] and the people he said they they were
[40:20] all out you know the the the soldiers
[40:24] and different ones they were out you
[40:25] know carousing and having a good time
[40:27] nobody could believe that that danger
[40:29] was approaching and there was there was
[40:33] messages announcements that went out
[40:35] across the radio
[40:37] and they heard it but they ignored it
[40:41] and brother Brown made this statement he
[40:44] said it wasn't he said that they didn't
[40:46] hear the message they didn't hear the
[40:48] message that was in the message there
[40:52] was there was a real certainty that was
[40:54] sounding within that and I believe with
[40:57] all my heart we're blessed people if we
[41:00] can have ears to hear what the Spirit is
[41:03] saying we can have a heart that'll just
[41:06] say be it unto me Lord just to yield to
[41:10] him and allow him to accomplish what he
[41:13] desires to accomplish in our lives
[41:16] amen let's just look into the word of
[41:19] the Lord and here in Matthew chapter 6
[41:23] and verse 25
[41:35] would you mind if we just pray before we
[41:37] read here in the scriptures
[41:40] Heavenly Father Lord I know Lord that we
[41:47] could read your word it's it's not so
[41:49] much that we have a certain time that we
[41:52] have to pray the Lord we're just asking
[41:55] that you direct every part of this Lord
[41:58] that you'll just come Lord as you press
[42:02] the thought upon my heart Lord some time
[42:05] ago and I ask that you'll come Lord I'm
[42:09] not sufficient to deliver this Lord but
[42:13] you are father so may you just come Lord
[42:16] and just speak lip to ear to us this
[42:18] morning minister to our hearts what we
[42:21] have need of for your your faithful Lord
[42:26] your watching over our lives Oh God you
[42:31] know every little detail Lord and now we
[42:34] just pray and ask that you'll minister
[42:36] to the needs of your children Lord as we
[42:39] just place them there on your great
[42:42] altar Lord we lay in there in the name
[42:45] of Jesus Christ and ask that God you'll
[42:48] just move for every need in a special
[42:51] way in the name of Jesus amen amen
[42:55] verse 25
[42:58] here the Lord Jesus said take no thought
[43:02] for your life what you shall eat or what
[43:08] you shall drink nor yet for your body
[43:11] what you shall put on is not the life
[43:16] more than meat
[43:19] and the body than raiment behold the
[43:23] fowls of the air for they sow not
[43:27] neither do they reap nor gather into
[43:30] barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth
[43:35] them are ye not much better than they
[43:38] which of you by taking thought can add
[43:43] one cubit unto his stature and why take
[43:47] ye thought for raiment consider the
[43:51] lilies of the field how they grow they
[43:54] toil not neither do they spin and yet I
[43:57] say unto you that even Solomon in all
[44:01] his glory was not arrayed like one of
[44:04] these wherefore if God so clothe the
[44:09] grass of the field which today is and
[44:11] tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he
[44:15] not much more clothe you O ye of little
[44:18] faith therefore take no Thought saying
[44:22] what shall we what shall we drink or
[44:27] wherewithal shall we be clothed for all
[44:31] these things do the Gentiles seek for
[44:35] your heavenly Father knoweth that you
[44:38] have need of all these things
[44:40] but seek you first the kingdom of God
[44:44] and His righteousness and all these
[44:47] things you catch what it is things all
[44:53] of the other parts are things all these
[44:58] other things shall be added unto you
[45:04] take therefore no thought for the morrow
[45:07] for the morrow shall take thought for
[45:10] the things of itself
[45:13] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[45:16] thereof may God bless you bless the
[45:20] reading of his word
[45:21] you're being seated this
[45:26] word throughout the scriptures that
[45:29] we've read here in Matthew you can lead
[45:32] the account and Luke as well the word
[45:36] thought that is used here throughout
[45:40] each one of these scriptures where it's
[45:42] admonishing us
[45:44] take no thought for these things the
[45:48] whole the word that is dealt with here
[45:51] is means to be anxious or to be troubled
[45:55] with cares
[45:57] now I thought of this just you know some
[46:00] time ago and just thinking of these
[46:03] parts is the Lord just laying it upon my
[46:05] heart some weeks ago and I thought about
[46:07] something come back to my heart the Lord
[46:10] brought it back of while brother Branham
[46:12] would describe and dramatize that of a
[46:15] little Robin he said you know he said
[46:17] there was a story where one little Robin
[46:21] said to another one
[46:23] I wonder why those human beings walk
[46:26] around so downhearted and they look like
[46:30] they're so selfish said I wonder if they
[46:33] haven't got a heavenly father to watch
[46:35] over them like we Robins do so maybe
[46:39] that's about it you never heard of one
[46:42] of them having high blood pressure did
[46:44] you did you ever see them on crutches
[46:47] going to the hospital to be operated on
[46:50] no they got a heavenly father he watches
[46:55] over them and he takes care of them
[47:00] but we know more than they do you know
[47:02] and so we have to be cut on butchered up
[47:06] and all kinds of diseases and fuss and
[47:09] fight with one another and that's the
[47:11] way we do
[47:14] in Matthew chapter 6 verse 34 the last
[47:17] Scripture we read I want to read this
[47:19] one out of the amplified version
[47:23] so do not worry or be anxious about
[47:26] tomorrow for tomorrow we'll have worries
[47:31] and anxieties of its own sufficient for
[47:36] each day is its own trouble brother
[47:40] branham made this statement and this is
[47:42] where this is this very quote for weeks
[47:45] I does the first time I'll read it but
[47:47] this is where the inspiration broke
[47:49] within that of stability and in unstable
[47:51] times brother branham we would say this
[47:55] God don't want you to be frowning God
[48:02] wants you to be happy
[48:05] the human heart was made to be happy
[48:10] worried will cause cancer temper will
[48:14] cause cancer don't never be upset just
[48:18] walk in his love amen
[48:22] boy if it was only that easy but it is I
[48:28] said but it is it's always the devil's
[48:32] business to make things complicated but
[48:35] remember God is hidden and revealed in
[48:39] simplicity Jesus took such the great
[48:42] depth of things that you and I could be
[48:45] worried about and he would direct the
[48:47] attention to show the care of our
[48:50] Heavenly Father how he cares for the
[48:52] lilies of the field how he cares for the
[48:55] robins all of them think of it
[48:57] Solomon had to pray God give me the
[49:01] wisdom that I need to lead these people
[49:03] God give me let me have the the coming
[49:06] out and the going in may you order and
[49:07] direct my steps and and Solomon even and
[49:11] everything that of all that he would
[49:13] give himself to which is what God would
[49:16] even call of our lives but yet he says
[49:18] consider the lily what is it it is that
[49:21] the lily itself it doesn't have anybody
[49:23] out there to water it you don't have
[49:26] anybody out there you know to dig around
[49:28] and and put some fertilizer on it and
[49:30] sprinkle Miracle Grow on it and put
[49:32] Osmocote I don't have none of that it is
[49:34] that simply toil
[49:38] and it's taken care of
[49:41] knowing now notice this this is where
[49:44] this comes in now with that that
[49:46] statement we just read don't never be
[49:48] upset just walk in his love amen
[49:51] knowing that you're walking in him
[49:55] nothing can harm you
[49:57] there's nothing can harm you there's
[50:00] neither powers things present things
[50:04] future nothing can separate us from him
[50:10] were in him and we never come in by our
[50:14] own will he by choice elected us and
[50:19] brought us into him amen
[50:22] we only surrendered to the choice that
[50:26] he already made so it's his business to
[50:32] take care of what he has took himself
[50:36] no man can pluck them from my father's
[50:40] hands because he's the greatest of all
[50:43] of them amen
[50:44] it's the father who takes care of that
[50:46] who's got any more power than God so
[50:51] what kind of a power have you got over
[50:53] you to take care of you the whole powers
[50:56] that created the universe's they men
[50:59] that took the solar system and blew like
[51:04] that and every star went to its place
[51:07] sure and he watches over you that's the
[51:13] kind of a father we have happy Father's
[51:20] Day papa
[51:25] amen Charles Spurgeon would ride it like
[51:31] this
[51:32] anxiety does not empty tomorrow of its
[51:37] sorrow but only empties today of its
[51:40] strength Martin Luther would say like
[51:44] this pray and let God worry Winston
[51:50] Churchill I may not have been a believer
[51:52] but yet truth is truth when I look back
[51:55] on all these worries I remember the
[51:57] story of the old man who said on his
[51:59] deathbed that he had had a lot of
[52:02] trouble in his life most of which had
[52:05] never happened now let's look at this
[52:08] great God who has his hand upon our
[52:12] lives their heavenly Father in Isaiah
[52:14] chapter 40 verse 12 here's the question
[52:18] that is asked who hath measured the
[52:21] waters in the hollow of his hand and
[52:24] meted out heaven with the span and
[52:27] comprehended the dust of the earth in a
[52:30] measure and weighed the mountains in
[52:32] scales and the hills in a balance I say
[52:36] he's bigger than my problems he's bigger
[52:40] if he can measure the waters the waters
[52:42] of this earth in the hollow of his hand
[52:44] you don't need both just one hand his
[52:48] balances he's able to weigh the
[52:50] mountains who have directed the Spirit
[52:54] of the Lord or being his counselor hath
[52:57] taught him with whom took he counseled
[53:01] and who instructed him and taught him in
[53:04] the path of judgment and taught him
[53:06] knowledge and showed to him the way of
[53:09] understanding think of this science
[53:11] itself
[53:12] studies what God has already done
[53:16] science breaks in and says this many
[53:18] atoms or molecules or whatever more it
[53:21] never did like chemistry whatever more
[53:22] these these compounds and how you break
[53:24] this off of and and this particular law
[53:27] of physics of potential and kinetic
[53:29] energy and all these other things those
[53:32] are only laws not that man came up with
[53:35] and begin to look at certain things and
[53:37] principles and then they would tack
[53:39] their own name to it because it's
[53:41] something that was already here but they
[53:44] themselves would put their name to it as
[53:46] though they discovered something it was
[53:48] already here they didn't create it they
[53:51] didn't make it
[53:52] god these are laws whereby that are said
[53:55] that even this of the earth and how that
[53:58] it operates whole mind think of this how
[54:01] that these very things as the Bible
[54:04] would say in verse 15 behold the nations
[54:07] are as a drop of a bucket and are
[54:12] counted as the small dust of the balance
[54:16] so in other words after you get done
[54:18] balancing out the mountain the dust
[54:21] that's on your balance that's how
[54:23] they're there counted so small behold he
[54:31] taketh up the Isles as a very little
[54:33] little thing and Lebanon which is not
[54:36] sufficient to burn nor the beasts
[54:38] thereof sufficient for a burnt offering
[54:40] Lebanon is known for its great forests
[54:42] and woods and you need the wood in order
[54:44] to burn the sacrifice all nations before
[54:47] him are as nothing
[54:51] and they are counted to him less than
[54:54] nothing and vanity
[55:00] to whom then will you like in God or
[55:04] what likeness will you comparing to him
[55:06] the workman melteth a graven image and
[55:10] the goldsmith spreadeth it over with
[55:13] gold and casteth silver chains he that
[55:17] is so impoverished that he hath no
[55:20] oblation chooseth a tree that will not
[55:23] rot he seeketh unto him a cunning
[55:26] workman to prepare a graven image that
[55:29] shall not be moved
[55:33] this is to me the whole is the part that
[55:36] just gets me when you read about
[55:37] idolatry and images the person that
[55:41] makes the God actually had to make the
[55:44] God but when you meet this God the
[55:47] Living God you realize he made me and
[55:53] this God this Living God that you and I
[55:56] our Heavenly Father brother William I
[55:58] don't have to pick him up like this
[56:00] plant and say well come on you know I'm
[56:02] moving over here now and I need I'm
[56:04] going to pick you up and I need to carry
[56:05] you with me
[56:06] that's not our God as a matter of fact
[56:09] he picks me up when I get down he picks
[56:13] me up when I need encouragement he lifts
[56:16] me up a man he fulfills his promise that
[56:22] his sons and daughters he would live and
[56:24] walk inside of us oh I love this have
[56:28] you not known have you not heard have
[56:31] had not been told you from the beginning
[56:32] have you not understood from the
[56:35] foundations of the earth it is he that
[56:39] sitteth upon the circle of the earth and
[56:42] the inhabitants thereof are as
[56:45] grasshoppers that stretcheth out the
[56:48] heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them
[56:51] out as a tent to dwell in that bringeth
[56:54] the princes to nothing he maketh the
[56:57] judges of the earth as vanity think how
[57:00] many times his brother bran would say
[57:02] how far you have to dig down to find
[57:04] where the writings about Pharaoh are but
[57:10] our Heavenly Father is the same he's the
[57:13] same what he did back there he's the
[57:17] same today oh he says yeah they they
[57:21] shall not be planted yet they shall not
[57:24] be sown yay their stock shall not take
[57:27] root in the earth and ye shall also blow
[57:30] up on them and they shall wither and the
[57:32] whirlwind shall take them away as
[57:35] stubble to whom then will you liken me
[57:39] or shall I be equal sayeth the Holy One
[57:42] lift up your eyes on high
[57:46] behold who hath created these things
[57:48] that bring us out there host by number
[57:51] he called them all by names by the
[57:55] greatness of his might for that he is
[57:58] strong in power not one faileth
[58:07] this great God that we've just read
[58:11] about above everything
[58:14] yet this great God would come down and
[58:17] take kinship with a man that was lost he
[58:23] would be made flesh in order to redeem
[58:29] us throughout his humanity he would
[58:33] experience and allow himself to
[58:35] experience many of the things that we
[58:38] deal with on a daily basis he didn't
[58:44] have to do that that's part of his love
[58:49] and yet he would come down to redeem us
[58:52] brother Bram says it like this and the
[58:54] message the power of the devil he says a
[58:56] long time ago when I got saved about 23
[59:00] years ago I made up in my mind like this
[59:03] I wasn't going to worry about anything
[59:05] God said because God is able to keep his
[59:08] own word any job that's too big for God
[59:11] to do what's the use in me worrying
[59:14] about it whew
[59:17] if he's Almighty God he does all things
[59:20] if he can't do all things he's not
[59:23] Almighty God so I believe him to be
[59:26] Almighty God now what's this
[59:28] so I commit myself to him my soul to him
[59:33] my body to him my living to him my
[59:37] breathing to him my dying to him my
[59:41] resurrection to him and some glorious
[59:44] day he will come to commit ourselves as
[59:53] it would even as David would portray it
[59:55] in the Psalms I believe in Psalms 37
[59:57] commit your ways unto the Lord it says
[1:00:00] roll your cares upon him so this morning
[1:00:07] here just for just for the next few
[1:00:09] moments this is what I want to even to
[1:00:11] begin to look at here under his care and
[1:00:16] we would see this in a time that we're
[1:00:19] living and I think you know in a time of
[1:00:21] things that we're seeing and we are
[1:00:24] experiencing around us we would have
[1:00:26] never a year ago I thought many times I
[1:00:29] thought my goodness a year ago who would
[1:00:31] have even seen this coming
[1:00:33] who would have ever thought this would
[1:00:35] be this way there's not one of us that
[1:00:36] are in here that has experienced this in
[1:00:39] our lifetime there's not one of it now
[1:00:42] know there's a lot of things that we can
[1:00:44] argue we we understand that what we're
[1:00:46] dealing with the pandemic it's that the
[1:00:49] virus itself is a real thing is it as
[1:00:51] bad as what the other pandemics that
[1:00:53] have been in the past well I don't know
[1:00:55] about that but I
[1:00:57] know one thing that is for sure that God
[1:00:59] knew that we would be here in the midst
[1:01:01] of this time he knew that there were
[1:01:03] these situations that would arise and
[1:01:06] God knew that we would have to go about
[1:01:08] our daily life our daily walk there are
[1:01:11] things we would have to do things we'd
[1:01:13] have to attend to and God would allow a
[1:01:16] situation to arise it would test us it
[1:01:19] would try us and I'll tell you what it's
[1:01:21] a pressure that ads all around us but
[1:01:23] yet within the midst of it God would
[1:01:25] call us as his children to be able to
[1:01:28] live in the midst of this time when
[1:01:30] people could say aren't you afraid about
[1:01:32] getting sick aren't you afraid about
[1:01:33] this and aren't you concerned about this
[1:01:35] and aren't you concerned about this let
[1:01:37] me just put it to you this way as I've
[1:01:39] said it weeks and weeks now there's no
[1:01:41] way that I'm gonna walk in to a ward
[1:01:43] where there's cold in nineteen now I'm
[1:01:45] not I'm not on plan on doing that if I
[1:01:47] know somebody has it sorry I love you
[1:01:49] but I'm gonna get next to you but I
[1:01:51] realize this one thing but how many
[1:01:53] times that with that and other things
[1:01:56] that God has kept his hand upon my life
[1:01:58] it does not make me a careless in the
[1:02:01] sense as though that I don't have to
[1:02:03] take certain precautions that's not what
[1:02:05] the Lord Jesus is talking about here
[1:02:08] whatsoever but he's talking about that
[1:02:11] in our lives should not be so vexed with
[1:02:13] anxiety and worry and fear and where
[1:02:17] we're trying to cross all the T's and
[1:02:18] all the gods and all of these things yet
[1:02:21] he wants us to walk with a perfect
[1:02:24] settled peace that he's got this under
[1:02:27] control we are here in this time God
[1:02:31] knows exactly where we're at and our
[1:02:33] trust is in him now what you think of
[1:02:39] this here in isaiah 32 verse 1 behold a
[1:02:43] king shall reign in righteousness and
[1:02:46] princes shall rule in judgment and a man
[1:02:50] shall be as a hiding place from the wind
[1:02:55] and a culvert from The Tempest as rivers
[1:02:59] of water in a dry place has the shadow
[1:03:02] of a great rock in a weary land
[1:03:06] I won't ask you to raise your hand but
[1:03:09] there's no doubt every one of us we deal
[1:03:13] with worry we deal with anxiousness we
[1:03:18] deal with stress we deal with pressure
[1:03:20] if you're living and you're breathing
[1:03:23] you're dealing with it we're not exempt
[1:03:26] from it it doesn't matter who you are it
[1:03:28] doesn't matter how Revelator's you are
[1:03:30] it doesn't matter how full of the Holy
[1:03:32] Ghost you are it doesn't matter you
[1:03:34] don't get away from press from pressure
[1:03:37] from stress from tension from the
[1:03:39] anxiousness but there's one thing that
[1:03:41] we do have as a believer we do have a
[1:03:44] place that we can go to we do have a
[1:03:47] place where we can release when it gets
[1:03:50] built up in our life now brother branham
[1:03:53] here he is you know he's he's was
[1:03:55] growing and this I'm going to read to
[1:03:56] you he's Lee he's going to take this
[1:03:59] from an actual experience that he
[1:04:02] himself has just experienced when he
[1:04:05] actually had to step in and take begin
[1:04:08] to take certain calls for brother
[1:04:09] Neville because brother Neville had come
[1:04:11] to a place that he was completely
[1:04:13] rundown and exhausted and he could not
[1:04:16] go a step further so brother Branham
[1:04:19] draws inspiration from and from this
[1:04:22] experience that he has within a hospital
[1:04:25] but let's look here in the message
[1:04:27] letting off the pressure he says there
[1:04:29] is a pressure on the people today and
[1:04:32] that pressure has no limitation or any
[1:04:37] denominational lines it has no age line
[1:04:40] it has no respect to person it's on
[1:04:43] young and old good and bad it's on
[1:04:47] everybody pressure it's on everybody I
[1:04:51] mean think about it you know as children
[1:04:53] Silas you know I'm saying in school they
[1:04:56] tell you come on man you got to you got
[1:04:57] to do good you know mom and dad they're
[1:04:59] trying to encourage you hey man you got
[1:05:00] to do good you want to go to college
[1:05:01] someday hey you want to go to this and
[1:05:03] all those things are good things but
[1:05:05] sometimes it just adds pressure because
[1:05:09] sometimes you know as a young as a young
[1:05:11] male say young man sometimes it's hard
[1:05:13] to see when they talk about things way
[1:05:15] out there in life you're looking at it
[1:05:17] you're looking just from lunch to dinner
[1:05:20] and they're looking at long you know I'm
[1:05:21] talking about you look for long distance
[1:05:23] you're like dad I just have to take your
[1:05:24] word for it
[1:05:25] you know they'll tell you certain things
[1:05:27] because they have been through those
[1:05:29] pathways before and sometimes this is
[1:05:31] where faith comes in even within as
[1:05:33] you're walking with your parents there's
[1:05:35] some times where your parents they'll
[1:05:37] say things and you yourself you've never
[1:05:39] been there I've been there I never had
[1:05:41] never had experienced it when my dad
[1:05:43] would tell me certain things but I'm so
[1:05:45] glad that I listened to somebody who had
[1:05:48] already walked this path way before and
[1:05:51] was able to help me not make decisions
[1:05:53] for me but able to help me so that there
[1:05:57] were decisions made that I actually am
[1:06:00] benefited from today well if I'd only
[1:06:04] listened to everything that he said I
[1:06:06] would have alleviated a lot of other
[1:06:09] marks and everything else upon my life
[1:06:11] but nonetheless there is a pressure
[1:06:14] pressure that even comes from things
[1:06:16] that are good things you can have
[1:06:18] pressure that comes around you as a
[1:06:19] young person as a middle age or whatever
[1:06:22] more you can have pressure that comes in
[1:06:24] the workplace in the school from family
[1:06:27] you can have pressure that's all around
[1:06:29] you pressure to do this and pressure to
[1:06:30] do that pressure itself is all around us
[1:06:34] and it is simply even in the normality
[1:06:37] and the routines of life it's on young
[1:06:43] and old good and bad it's on everybody
[1:06:45] pressure we are living in a neurotic age
[1:06:49] nervous tension everybody is racing here
[1:06:54] and going there and going nowhere
[1:06:58] ain't that right brother Trevor on 480
[1:07:00] racing everywhere going nowhere
[1:07:03] sometimes I've arrived been on 480 I
[1:07:05] don't know why they put cops out there
[1:07:11] Mazal just put up a sign indianapolis
[1:07:13] 500 it's just to that kind of an age and
[1:07:18] I know this church listen now I know
[1:07:20] this church would be plagued with that
[1:07:23] he's speaking in brother Rutles Church
[1:07:24] as everywhere is plagued with it the
[1:07:27] tabernacle is plagued with it everywhere
[1:07:30] the whole world it's a day of pressure
[1:07:35] per hurry hurry hurry hurry hurry up and
[1:07:38] wait
[1:07:41] gotta get to my doctor's appointment so
[1:07:44] I can wait wait and now you heard in the
[1:07:52] restaurant you're gonna be waiting drive
[1:07:57] 90 miles an hour and then to get home
[1:07:59] for supper and wait two hours till it
[1:08:02] gets ready brothers don't say nothing
[1:08:05] it's a time and in that rushing and
[1:08:09] speeding it gets you to a nervous
[1:08:14] tension the wife say something a little
[1:08:18] contrary and you want to fly off temper
[1:08:21] husband say something you'll Pat your
[1:08:23] foot and tell him to get in the room
[1:08:25] well now husband I don't want no words
[1:08:27] with you go out there wife oh I'm so
[1:08:31] nervous see what what's the matter all
[1:08:34] this together
[1:08:35] this tension building up then the
[1:08:38] results of it doing something wrong and
[1:08:43] acting out of place now it'll make the
[1:08:46] poor act that way it'll make the middle
[1:08:49] class act that way it'll make the rich
[1:08:51] act that way it'll make the wrong act
[1:08:53] that way it'll make the pretty good act
[1:08:56] that way it'll make that good act that
[1:08:58] way because it's tension steam that's
[1:09:01] build up it's got to blow it out
[1:09:04] somewhere if you don't you blow the
[1:09:07] boiler up
[1:09:10] hey you know not just when I was in
[1:09:13] school but sometimes when
[1:09:16] when I was teaching because some of the
[1:09:18] first building building I thought in was
[1:09:20] built in the late 1800s there in
[1:09:23] Sandusky and they it was just beautiful
[1:09:24] buildings and you know how it was in
[1:09:27] those you'd get to a certain time of the
[1:09:29] day and man that boiler heat was always
[1:09:31] so hot and then they'd get that certain
[1:09:33] time of the day brother Brian that you
[1:09:34] know when they clicked it off you do
[1:09:36] this ping ping cling cling cling cling
[1:09:38] cling cling cling cling cling cling
[1:09:40] cling cling cling cling and you'd hear
[1:09:42] it and other didn't certain times than
[1:09:43] they maybe they had to start it back up
[1:09:45] and what would happen is on the intake
[1:09:47] of that boiler it would actually get as
[1:09:50] they were taking in there and trying to
[1:09:52] build in there there with that water air
[1:09:54] would get in there and they needed to
[1:09:56] release the air that was within the
[1:09:59] pipes many of you see this even when you
[1:10:00] go to water your plants at first it it
[1:10:02] comes out then you get it sputtering out
[1:10:04] it's why it's air that gets trapped in
[1:10:07] there there's got to be a way to get
[1:10:10] that air out of there and there is what
[1:10:12] is called a bleeder and that were a
[1:10:15] pressure release valve that is able to
[1:10:18] help that of the air that steam that
[1:10:22] pressure that's built up I'm glad that
[1:10:24] we have a place I'm glad that we've got
[1:10:29] a place where we can let off the
[1:10:32] pressure low glory it's the right place
[1:10:36] to let off the press the pressure we've
[1:10:39] got a release valve that God has given
[1:10:42] to us he said ask the father anything in
[1:10:45] my name and I will do it he said now
[1:10:50] we'll find out it builds up as the day
[1:10:52] goes you talk to your boss if you're
[1:10:55] working Oh so-and-so and if you speak to
[1:10:58] the kitty come in here mama I'm there
[1:11:01] you're it builds up ooh ma you feel like
[1:11:05] you're going to your hand is going to
[1:11:06] come off how would he know
[1:11:09] I said hello how would he know I know
[1:11:14] I'm with it every day I know what it
[1:11:17] means it builds up because why there's
[1:11:20] no boundary lines that says pressure
[1:11:24] doesn't come to a prophet of God
[1:11:27] pressure doesn't come to a believer no
[1:11:30] no pressure comes what's important is
[1:11:32] that you've got the place to let it off
[1:11:37] think of this here thought of this the
[1:11:40] other night I was at a certain hospital
[1:11:42] and our pastor I thought he was sick but
[1:11:45] he had just wore out Ron Ron Ron Ron
[1:11:47] chilly just exhausted and some of them
[1:11:50] said they called up and they called in
[1:11:52] the office down there and asked if I'd
[1:11:54] make his calls
[1:11:55] well I had been busy with business acts
[1:11:57] all day and ministers from different
[1:11:59] places and I said yes well I went to
[1:12:01] make his calls
[1:12:03] no brother man talks about this here as
[1:12:05] he goes into the hospital and I'm sure
[1:12:07] that probably every one of us have
[1:12:08] experienced this when he walked up to
[1:12:10] the station and they were busy you know
[1:12:12] maybe it's a time of charting you're
[1:12:14] getting ready to get off of shift and
[1:12:16] and everything else and here somebody
[1:12:18] comes and says hey how can you tell me
[1:12:20] where a room so-and-so is there whatever
[1:12:21] more
[1:12:23] well you know just look this Wainwright
[1:12:25] down the hall
[1:12:28] then said then you know the nurse and
[1:12:30] Sarita okay he walks down that way can't
[1:12:33] find it comes into another place you
[1:12:36] know and he says I seen this doctor he
[1:12:38] said four foot high and four foot wide I
[1:12:39] asked James I thought about asking him
[1:12:41] sir he said where could I get to this
[1:12:44] particular room and he since then even
[1:12:46] as he looked at some of the doctors and
[1:12:48] other nurses he was getting ready to
[1:12:50] approach them but he could see within
[1:12:53] their countenance that the stress and
[1:12:56] the tension they were all built up so he
[1:12:59] knew better than to even try to ask them
[1:13:01] he was in a situation he needed help to
[1:13:04] get to the sister's room and eventually
[1:13:07] here is a nurse and he sees this nurse
[1:13:09] and he goes over to her and he says
[1:13:12] ma'am he says I'm trying to get to this
[1:13:14] room and this and that and she said what
[1:13:16] brother branham she said let's look at
[1:13:18] it right here she said let me just you
[1:13:20] know lay this out for you of how to get
[1:13:22] to this room you know it shows that even
[1:13:25] when you look at how that a nurse or a
[1:13:27] doctor or in whatever that you do for a
[1:13:30] living and there's things mothers
[1:13:32] fathers and everything else there are
[1:13:34] things that we do that are not
[1:13:36] necessarily sinful there are cares of
[1:13:39] life that we have and when we're looking
[1:13:42] at the cares of life sometimes it's that
[1:13:44] they can mount up sometimes you get to
[1:13:46] looking at something not I realize that
[1:13:48] every one of our makeups are different
[1:13:50] some of this is going to hell it hurt
[1:13:52] and it you know hit a certain way others
[1:13:54] have it or hit another way there's some
[1:13:56] of us and you know hey man I mean you
[1:13:58] could care less I mean hey if you have
[1:14:00] you don't get the garden weeded so what
[1:14:02] buddy it'll be there the next time but
[1:14:04] there's others of us that we don't only
[1:14:05] want the garden watered we want it we
[1:14:08] did water it and we want the furniture
[1:14:09] moved here this wall painted we would
[1:14:12] like to have this light fixture up we
[1:14:14] would like to have the gate fix that
[1:14:15] goes into the fence and we ain't even
[1:14:19] started on one thing yet and you know
[1:14:24] it's funny because how some of us would
[1:14:26] like to be able to say man you know when
[1:14:29] we get into those times I wish I had
[1:14:30] this person's personality and then the
[1:14:32] other person that just says hey man let
[1:14:35] me just take it easy everything's gonna
[1:14:37] be all right you know and you know
[1:14:39] each one of us within our makeups and
[1:14:42] our temperaments can actually get in
[1:14:44] trouble because in the things that are
[1:14:46] strong yet we could look at and say man
[1:14:49] that's a good quality
[1:14:50] you know maybe brother Joey's able just
[1:14:51] to relax right back I mean maybe he's
[1:14:54] got you know all sorts of work that
[1:14:56] needs to be done around the house or
[1:14:57] other things but brother Joey's able to
[1:15:00] kick back and relax and I don't know for
[1:15:01] the joy does this or not but you know
[1:15:04] you could look at it and say my goodness
[1:15:06] man I would love to be like that word
[1:15:08] brother Joey I'm always looking at
[1:15:10] things and everything I see is this
[1:15:11] picture needs to be balanced with this
[1:15:13] picture this needs to be level out here
[1:15:15] and this needs to be and you see wonder
[1:15:18] what it comes down to we're looking for
[1:15:20] that and say my I wish I could be that
[1:15:22] way we add pressure to our lives when
[1:15:25] instead of saying Lord just stopping for
[1:15:28] a moment and saying lord help me Lord
[1:15:30] just to focus on one task for this day I
[1:15:35] know that's not very spiritual but it'll
[1:15:38] help you I said it ain't very spiritual
[1:15:40] but this will help you you know we
[1:15:45] always talk about everybody you know
[1:15:46] mama always used to say this and they
[1:15:49] would tell you rome wasn't built in a
[1:15:50] day I don't think anybody's trying to
[1:15:53] build Roman here anyhow but they would
[1:15:55] tell you a roll man wasn't built in a
[1:15:57] day and this wasn't built in a day and
[1:15:58] this and that but you see that the
[1:16:00] complexities between it there would be
[1:16:02] times that maybe brother joy would say
[1:16:04] mind you know what I wish I had more get
[1:16:06] up and or I wish I had more of this I
[1:16:08] need to take care of this I wish I was
[1:16:10] like that it creates then a stress or
[1:16:12] attention and we both need help from the
[1:16:15] Lord for God to help us in those areas
[1:16:18] of my love our live he needs God to help
[1:16:20] him because look this can carry over
[1:16:22] into the spiritual maybe we get Lacs and
[1:16:24] lazy that temperament will carry over to
[1:16:27] where we're just lacks and say sera sera
[1:16:29] I'm going in a rapture I don't have to
[1:16:32] pray I don't have to read as much I
[1:16:34] don't have to this or that blessed God
[1:16:36] the Bloods got me covered and it can
[1:16:38] actually lead to a lukewarm life and
[1:16:41] then there on the other hand those who
[1:16:43] are so rigid and this and that and
[1:16:45] whatever more they never can come to a
[1:16:48] spot sometimes maybe to feel like
[1:16:50] they're good enough or that they've done
[1:16:51] enough
[1:16:52] yet they're always looking at themselves
[1:16:54] and looking at this all we need the help
[1:16:57] of God we need the grace of God in our
[1:17:00] temperaments in our makeups
[1:17:02] we need the overshadowing of him that
[1:17:05] sits on the circle of the earth to guide
[1:17:08] us through this time of pressure we need
[1:17:11] his leadership when God got ahold of my
[1:17:17] life it just made me aware he had his
[1:17:20] hand on my life the whole time and the
[1:17:23] longer that I served him it makes me
[1:17:25] more aware of just how much more that I
[1:17:28] need him today I thought of this brother
[1:17:37] brems said going on in that message I
[1:17:39] thought that's it letting off the steam
[1:17:43] everybody it's just becoming a neurotic
[1:17:47] age everybody is all built up
[1:17:51] hmm haven't got no time and that builds
[1:17:57] up to a place that it breaks up things
[1:18:03] it causes people to have hard feelings
[1:18:08] when they snap them off and say things
[1:18:10] you don't mean to say now everybody is
[1:18:15] guilty of it
[1:18:18] I'm guilty oh no you're all guilty whoo
[1:18:24] and the church said Amen we do things
[1:18:30] under pressure that we wouldn't do
[1:18:32] otherwise there's an excess pressure
[1:18:36] build-up today
[1:18:41] he says I believe it's the enemy coming
[1:18:43] down and pressing I believe it's the
[1:18:46] devil we know the coming of the Lord is
[1:18:49] a hand and the Bible said in the last
[1:18:52] days that the devil would go about like
[1:18:55] a roaring lion and if he could get you
[1:18:59] under pressure did you hear the
[1:19:01] statement if he can get you under
[1:19:05] pressure hurring running over something
[1:19:09] you will make decisions that you
[1:19:13] wouldn't make if you'd sit down and
[1:19:16] think it over I'm not going to ask you
[1:19:20] to raise your hands but there I think
[1:19:21] every one of us could be honest there's
[1:19:23] some times we've we've recognized over
[1:19:25] our failures and our mistakes of the
[1:19:27] benefit of just sitting down and
[1:19:29] thinking it over because we're trying to
[1:19:31] figure out how am I gonna make this fit
[1:19:32] how am I gonna do this how am I gonna do
[1:19:34] that and we can get so worked up with
[1:19:36] the how-to instead of just saying lord
[1:19:38] will you help me
[1:19:40] oh brother 7 you're talking about
[1:19:42] natural you're talking about natural
[1:19:44] things they remember in the Garden of
[1:19:46] Eden God release that there was power
[1:19:50] that was present for that of the
[1:19:52] furniture to be rearranged come on
[1:19:55] somebody for the tree to be lifted up I
[1:19:57] know the brothers said boy I wish I had
[1:19:59] that in one man power but you see it was
[1:20:03] things that they were not in an ageist
[1:20:06] us
[1:20:06] they're safe in God's pavilion it was
[1:20:10] not an anxiousness of hurry up let's get
[1:20:13] this done hurry up let's get this done
[1:20:18] but yet the pressure that we find around
[1:20:23] us the build up pressures that cone of
[1:20:28] pressures to do this and you say those
[1:20:31] are natural things but how much greater
[1:20:33] could it be if we could say Lord and
[1:20:36] just be honest with you I'm awful
[1:20:38] anxious about this Lord I'm worrying
[1:20:42] about I'm so tore up I'm not even
[1:20:44] settled about this of what to do here
[1:20:46] Lord God will you help us will you help
[1:20:51] us Lord I believe you'll find that he
[1:20:55] will open doors he'll make ways for you
[1:20:57] we're witnesses of that it's just
[1:20:59] sometimes we forget in and we get under
[1:21:01] the pressure of things that are taking
[1:21:03] place the Bible says in proverbs 18:10
[1:21:05] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:21:08] and the righteous runneth into it and
[1:21:12] dis safe
[1:21:14] he is our place of safety it's in him
[1:21:22] that we can go and let off the pressure
[1:21:27] you see we all can experience and we all
[1:21:29] experience the pressures of this life
[1:21:32] and the cares of it
[1:21:34] but there is a pressure
[1:21:36] that you don't have to bear
[1:21:39] and that's a pressure of where am I
[1:21:43] going it's my sole right with God you
[1:21:50] see there's a place that's provided the
[1:21:52] name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:21:57] and all it takes is to run to that tap
[1:22:00] you've got to have a desire to get to
[1:22:02] that tower you've got to have a desire
[1:22:05] because there's a slayer there's one
[1:22:08] that's after you the devil is after your
[1:22:10] life think about this age we're living
[1:22:14] in
[1:22:16] you've read it and I've read it reports
[1:22:19] all around all around here suicide
[1:22:29] and then from what I then you get crazy
[1:22:32] things that what they're putting out
[1:22:35] from what I've you you read certain
[1:22:37] things that are out there they're
[1:22:39] putting certain things out for people to
[1:22:41] watch about suicide
[1:22:45] how dumb is that how nutty is that it
[1:22:49] shows you the insanity people are
[1:22:54] looking for a place to escape to where
[1:23:00] they can just read off the pressure in
[1:23:03] other words you can be who you really
[1:23:07] want to be maybe you really want to
[1:23:10] serve God and there's something that's
[1:23:13] pulling your butt you're looking at what
[1:23:15] are my friends gonna say what's my
[1:23:18] husband gonna say what's my life going
[1:23:21] to say once - all of those are
[1:23:24] suggestions from the devil to try to
[1:23:26] build pressure to keep you in the same
[1:23:29] state so he can keep on pouring on that
[1:23:32] pressure but there is a release valve
[1:23:36] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[1:23:40] you can call on the name of the Lord and
[1:23:43] say Lord Jesus I need you as my savior I
[1:23:49] repent of my sins I need your saving
[1:23:55] grace Lord I need you to turn around my
[1:24:00] life I may know what I'm talking about
[1:24:13] when you feel the release and that
[1:24:17] release comes because your faith has
[1:24:20] been appropriated in the one who already
[1:24:24] paid the price for your sins in that
[1:24:31] awesome it's more than awesome it's
[1:24:34] wonderful
[1:24:35] he's our pressure release he's the one
[1:24:39] that releases the guilty and declares us
[1:24:43] innocent
[1:24:45] this is a City of Refuge we're talking
[1:24:48] about a place where you can take refuge
[1:24:53] where he's our desire he's everything to
[1:24:58] us oh well I feel pressured yes you
[1:25:01] still feel pressures but it's different
[1:25:04] you're in a place where there's one who
[1:25:10] knows all about it
[1:25:12] he meets every need just like he takes
[1:25:15] care of the birds just like he weighed
[1:25:19] the mountains with a balance and the
[1:25:21] nations are a speck of dust
[1:25:25] that same God is greater
[1:25:29] than every trial he's greater than all
[1:25:34] the pressure
[1:25:37] he's greater than all the what-ifs it
[1:25:40] listen to this in the fat tyrant age
[1:25:43] here quoting out of the scripture I will
[1:25:46] put I will put upon you none other
[1:25:48] burden the word for burden is weight or
[1:25:51] pressure the pressure of the Dark Ages
[1:25:54] was either bend or be broken bow or die
[1:25:58] almost sounds like it's repeating Don it
[1:26:01] it was the Inquisition the power of the
[1:26:05] Empire
[1:26:06] backing up satanic worship be organized
[1:26:09] or pay with your life each age had its
[1:26:14] pressures for example a great burden of
[1:26:17] the last age is the pressure of riches
[1:26:25] soft living who and nervous tensions in
[1:26:32] a complex age that we seem unfitted to
[1:26:38] live in
[1:26:42] it'd be like brother Aaron
[1:26:46] giving me his suit coat to wear I think
[1:26:51] it probably fit around one of my arms
[1:26:59] you would look at that if I walked up
[1:27:01] here now I know in today's culture must
[1:27:03] have mana guys in style he's got a tight
[1:27:05] coat on well I don't like tight clothes
[1:27:10] but here you had having that coat on you
[1:27:12] would look at that and say brother
[1:27:14] salmon has gained in some wood sister
[1:27:19] Kim must be really feeding him good does
[1:27:22] he know the quarantine is over but you
[1:27:25] see that that coat you would look at and
[1:27:27] say that don't even fit you
[1:27:30] it don't fit you why are you wearing it
[1:27:33] that's how this age is
[1:27:37] not just the sons and daughters of God
[1:27:39] it's for all of humanity it's unfit you
[1:27:44] want to know why people are acting the
[1:27:46] way they acting it's because of who's in
[1:27:48] control I'm not I'm with the president
[1:27:50] I'm talking about Satan he owns the
[1:27:53] kingdoms of this world
[1:27:54] he took the Lord Jesus up and in a
[1:27:57] moment's time he showed them the glory
[1:28:02] but you let go you let the
[1:28:04] administration change hands and God will
[1:28:08] prove in the Millennium when there will
[1:28:10] be people who will walk out will come
[1:28:12] out from those nation's remnants who are
[1:28:14] left and have not even been regenerated
[1:28:16] and will come and be raised back up to
[1:28:20] walk here in the Millennium and the
[1:28:22] Bible says that the knowledge of the
[1:28:25] Lord will fill the land earth sea and
[1:28:28] sky and just that administration
[1:28:33] changing over the earth will have an
[1:28:37] effect so you see there's not one nation
[1:28:41] you can go to oh I'll go to this nation
[1:28:44] oh I'll go to this mission well if I can
[1:28:47] only go to the Bahamas
[1:28:49] I would escape all of this oh if I could
[1:28:54] only go let me just bring it down Puerto
[1:28:56] Rico Oh
[1:28:58] crystal-clear waters all I would wait in
[1:29:01] the waters and oh I would just be
[1:29:05] relieved it would work for so long guess
[1:29:09] what pressure be waiting on you for to
[1:29:11] get back you know how it is on Monday
[1:29:14] morning when you took a week off it's
[1:29:16] waiting on you get rest it up get ready
[1:29:20] to go
[1:29:21] and sometimes you were looking for such
[1:29:24] other places all if this could just if I
[1:29:28] could just go there there's nothing
[1:29:30] wrong with getting away nothing wrong
[1:29:31] with a vacation nothing wrong with doing
[1:29:34] those trips brother branham himself
[1:29:35] showed us by an example the effect of
[1:29:37] those things but if we in ourselves make
[1:29:40] that the place of the let off the
[1:29:42] pressure then I'm afraid none of us
[1:29:44] would keep on working
[1:29:46] we'd become bums we'd be one stimulus
[1:29:51] check after stimulus check and
[1:29:52] everything else and oh my I hope this is
[1:29:55] that I hope this is that you understand
[1:29:56] what I'm saying we would just become so
[1:29:59] complacent but you seek god that's
[1:30:02] giving you an a a better resource then
[1:30:05] God said put them in the toughest age
[1:30:08] where there's all kinds of pressure and
[1:30:10] I will give sufficient grace then
[1:30:14] they'll be able to stand in the midst of
[1:30:17] pressure the trials that come upon their
[1:30:20] life will be opportunities for me to
[1:30:23] make myself known think of that
[1:30:32] statement that I read to you in the
[1:30:35] beginning God don't want us a friend
[1:30:39] God wants to be happy now God don't want
[1:30:41] you walking around like some mean where
[1:30:42] you got something painted on your face
[1:30:44] because paint don't make don't mean
[1:30:46] you're happy paints only a false sign
[1:30:49] you're trying to hide something come on
[1:30:51] somebody you're trying to put something
[1:30:54] on the show for somebody else but you
[1:30:56] see it's got to be something that's not
[1:30:57] painted on it's something that is down
[1:31:00] in here
[1:31:04] and we need the help of the Lord because
[1:31:09] there's times we experience worry we
[1:31:11] experience anxiety we experience these
[1:31:13] things that come along our way is it any
[1:31:16] wonder how brother Brown would make the
[1:31:17] statement worried causes cancer temper
[1:31:22] calls us cancer to me when I've looked
[1:31:26] at these statements and you know over
[1:31:27] the years goes you've been here who have
[1:31:28] sometimes ministered on certain things
[1:31:30] that have been certain angles it's no
[1:31:32] wonder is it any wonder that this is
[1:31:34] known as the cancer Age
[1:31:38] is it any wonder that the angel of the
[1:31:41] Lord specifically told the Prophet if
[1:31:45] you can get if you be sincere when you
[1:31:49] pray and you get the people to believe
[1:31:51] not even cancer will stand before your
[1:31:56] prayer is it any wonder we're living in
[1:32:01] an erotic age let me just read you here
[1:32:04] a few little points from a medical
[1:32:08] doctor says stress is a part of life you
[1:32:11] feel it when you're preparing for the
[1:32:14] holidays stuck in traffic or worrying
[1:32:17] about a friend's health while a little
[1:32:20] stress is nothing to fret about the kind
[1:32:23] of intense worry that lingers for weeks
[1:32:27] or months and make it hard for you to
[1:32:31] stay healthy
[1:32:32] stress has a profound impact on how your
[1:32:37] body systems function says Lorenzo Coen
[1:32:41] PhD professor of on and on and on and on
[1:32:43] and on health experts are still sorting
[1:32:46] out whether stress actually causes
[1:32:50] cancer yet listen a statement there's
[1:32:52] little doubt that it promotes the growth
[1:32:55] and spread of some forms of the disease
[1:32:59] but simply stress makes your body more
[1:33:03] hospitable to cancer
[1:33:07] brother Samuel this is so simple I know
[1:33:10] I know but you see God sent a gospel
[1:33:14] that went from my soul first of all and
[1:33:17] this same gospel yet ministers to my
[1:33:20] spirit come on the Prophet would take
[1:33:23] time throughout the message take that in
[1:33:25] the message of greatest battle ever
[1:33:26] fought he would deal with all three
[1:33:28] realms and greatest battle ever fought
[1:33:29] and throughout the message when you go
[1:33:31] through it we found it in the scriptures
[1:33:32] as well the Bible tells us that this
[1:33:35] this of our body to glorify God in our
[1:33:38] body and in our spirit now I look at
[1:33:40] this stress makes your body more
[1:33:42] hospitable to cancer anybody want to
[1:33:45] make diseases hospitable no not all
[1:33:50] stress is equally harmful and we realize
[1:33:52] this there are two different types of
[1:33:54] stress only one seems to be really bad
[1:33:57] for your health
[1:33:58] that this said the particular gentleman
[1:34:00] there short-term or acute stress like
[1:34:04] the time you might feel before preaching
[1:34:06] I mean giving a speech or fighting
[1:34:08] holiday shopping crowds tends to subside
[1:34:11] as soon as the event passes maybe that's
[1:34:14] why I can take such a good nap on Sunday
[1:34:16] afternoon it's stress that comes from
[1:34:21] situations you know you can manage or
[1:34:24] we'll be over at some set time
[1:34:31] but long-term or chronic stress is more
[1:34:35] damaging that type of stress Springs
[1:34:38] from situations that last many weeks or
[1:34:41] months with no definite end point or
[1:34:44] instance going to end
[1:34:48] Paul my grace is sufficient
[1:34:53] sometimes we're looking for an end point
[1:34:56] you know how it is home brother Samuel
[1:34:58] when God did stent bringing me through
[1:35:00] this I'm gonna testify well wait whoa
[1:35:04] wait it's a testimony even as you're
[1:35:08] going through it he's keeping you he's
[1:35:10] giving me strength throughout this day
[1:35:13] throughout this week he's helped me in
[1:35:15] the little problems in the little things
[1:35:17] that concerned me along the way I wonder
[1:35:21] if we wouldn't take time like that I
[1:35:24] wonder if it wouldn't help us in these
[1:35:26] times when we have periods where there's
[1:35:29] no definite set time
[1:35:33] I know you as parents are looking at me
[1:35:35] right now as parents some of you are
[1:35:37] looking and you're praying earnestly or
[1:35:40] Jesus let them open the schools in the
[1:35:43] fall no online learning Lord see that's
[1:35:54] helping some of you right there no long
[1:35:58] term a chronic stress is more damaging
[1:36:01] that type of stress Springs from
[1:36:03] situations that last many weeks or
[1:36:05] months with no definite endpoint caring
[1:36:07] for a sick loved one or dealing with a
[1:36:10] long stint of unemployment or common
[1:36:13] causes of chronic stress this type of no
[1:36:18] end in sight stress can weaken your
[1:36:23] immune system
[1:36:26] leaving you prone to diseases like
[1:36:30] cancer
[1:36:30] it also ups your risk for digestive
[1:36:34] problems and depression
[1:36:37] you wouldn't believe some of the things
[1:36:39] that I've studied over weeks of how a
[1:36:42] many much of anxiety and depression and
[1:36:44] all the release of cortisol and all
[1:36:46] those things are so tied to sleep and
[1:36:49] diet
[1:36:52] well we need help don't we not
[1:36:55] McDonald's either we need help
[1:36:57] chronic stress also can help cancer grow
[1:37:01] and spread in a number of ways
[1:37:02] listen stress hormones can inhibit and
[1:37:07] then stop a process called a canosa's
[1:37:11] which kills diseased cells and presents
[1:37:16] them from spreading I mean those healing
[1:37:18] lays in the body life is the healer
[1:37:21] right Bodrum says and you got a cut put
[1:37:23] penicillin on that cut but if the man's
[1:37:25] dead you can put all the penicillin you
[1:37:27] want you will not heal up life is the
[1:37:29] healer to me I found that pretty
[1:37:32] fascinating because the atheist or the
[1:37:34] infidel that don't even believe in God
[1:37:35] when they've got even the slightest
[1:37:37] little cut or scratch guess what it's a
[1:37:39] testimony that there's one greater than
[1:37:41] you and he didn't even ask the atheists
[1:37:45] or the infidel can I heal you go Robina
[1:37:49] God stress can inhibit a process this
[1:37:54] process which will kill diseased cells
[1:37:56] and presents them from spreading has
[1:37:58] anybody ever thought about that do you
[1:38:00] go round of the day brother Chad do you
[1:38:02] go around in the day saying oh no sales
[1:38:04] these sales these certain sales I need
[1:38:06] you I need you to kill diseases you know
[1:38:08] we're walking all around and I don't
[1:38:10] have Lysol handy right now and I need
[1:38:12] you to help me I need you to kill all
[1:38:14] these diseases I need it I don't need it
[1:38:17] I don't know if I can be six foot away
[1:38:18] somebody I really need you're not going
[1:38:21] around like that if you went around like
[1:38:22] that you'd be a nutcase you can't go
[1:38:27] around like that
[1:38:28] but look for the joint this is something
[1:38:30] that God set in the body before the fall
[1:38:35] they never had to worry about this
[1:38:37] before the fall they never had to worry
[1:38:39] about this how much greater by God's
[1:38:42] grace when he can take us back to where
[1:38:45] Adam and Eve fell from by the new birth
[1:38:48] that you and I can have a resource in
[1:38:51] God to say Lord I'm trusting you over
[1:38:55] the direction of my body
[1:39:01] goes on to say chronic stress also
[1:39:03] increases the production of certain
[1:39:05] growth factors that increase your blood
[1:39:07] supply this can speed the development of
[1:39:09] cancerous tumors he adds
[1:39:14] I need just a little bit more
[1:39:20] you've got to find healthy ways to
[1:39:22] manage stress what can you do about
[1:39:27] stress removing the causes the clear
[1:39:31] answer for some of you that means
[1:39:34] befriending some people some of you it
[1:39:38] means getting off or getting rid of
[1:39:40] things on Instagram or this others it
[1:39:43] means stop partaking of certain
[1:39:45] headlines and getting your leadership
[1:39:48] through the local news or your direction
[1:39:53] through the CDC or whatever it is you
[1:39:56] understand it's something we ignore but
[1:40:01] listen there comes a time there comes a
[1:40:03] time we've got to make sure what we're
[1:40:06] feeding on this is one of the simplest
[1:40:10] things that they will tell you you want
[1:40:13] to get rid of stress first of all
[1:40:15] eliminate what's causing it if you can
[1:40:17] sometimes that's easier to do than what
[1:40:19] we think but that's not always possible
[1:40:22] when it comes to types of things that
[1:40:23] cause chronic stress even if you can't
[1:40:26] rid yourself of the source of your
[1:40:28] stress you can learn to manage it this
[1:40:30] can help you keep a lid on chronic
[1:40:33] stress you know I think I'm gonna read
[1:40:35] this brother Branson who won the world
[1:40:37] these preachers telling people when you
[1:40:39] come to the Lord my you're on a picnic
[1:40:41] it's a gray no no picnic when you come
[1:40:45] to the Lord you're on a battleground but
[1:40:48] you're on the winning side you're no
[1:40:52] longer fighting against your brother
[1:40:54] your fattened with the backing of the
[1:40:56] Lord of glory
[1:40:58] share those battles share those things
[1:41:01] that come away
[1:41:02] that we have to overcome but God said
[1:41:04] these are opportunities that I will make
[1:41:08] my glory known through this can help you
[1:41:12] keep a lid on chronic stress it can also
[1:41:15] help you prevent minor sources of stress
[1:41:18] from lingering to a point where they're
[1:41:21] affecting your health
[1:41:26] well we've read through those md's I'm
[1:41:35] going to read from one right now doesn't
[1:41:37] have an MD not an oncologist not on
[1:41:40] whatever Allah Juicin and nurse none of
[1:41:44] that
[1:41:46] but I'm gonna read one who got sent in
[1:41:49] this day
[1:41:51] and the same one that we read about in
[1:41:53] Isaiah 40 who sits on the circle of the
[1:41:56] earth who measured out the mountains in
[1:41:59] his hand it came down and used this
[1:42:02] little Kentucky and this is back in 1964
[1:42:09] this isn't 2020 if you worry's talking
[1:42:13] to a brother in a domestic situation if
[1:42:15] you worry it'll break your health down
[1:42:18] and that's what Satan wants to do now
[1:42:23] according this man he says I believe the
[1:42:25] message I love the message but my
[1:42:27] family's going a certain way notice the
[1:42:29] discernment here in questions and
[1:42:31] answers Satan is not trying so much to
[1:42:34] try to get him to go back on the wall
[1:42:36] but he's trying to worry him about his
[1:42:39] family why so that his health will be
[1:42:44] broke down pressure pressure Lord I'm
[1:42:50] praying for him but it seems like
[1:42:51] they're going to completely opposite way
[1:42:52] God I'm paying for him but it'll seem
[1:42:55] like their desires are to serve you
[1:42:56] whatsoever
[1:43:02] he's working I know and you so you just
[1:43:08] commit the whole thing to God and go
[1:43:12] right on serving God just as happy as
[1:43:15] you can be God will take care of the
[1:43:19] rest of it now I know I'm speaking to
[1:43:23] mortals and I know when we read a
[1:43:25] statement like this we're saying as we
[1:43:27] said Amen and we should say Amen to it
[1:43:29] but sometimes the committing it comes
[1:43:32] out to be a bigger job we make it out to
[1:43:34] be a bigger job than what it is
[1:43:37] committing is not where we say Lord I'm
[1:43:41] going to put this part in your hands
[1:43:43] I'll take care of the rest of it God
[1:43:45] said how shall you liken me
[1:43:50] well Lord I'll tell you what since
[1:43:53] you're God
[1:43:53] I'll give you 90% I'll keep the other
[1:43:55] 10% so he'll take the nine to do
[1:43:58] something about it and you take the ten
[1:44:00] and worry about it
[1:44:02] don't make sense so what should I do
[1:44:06] commit sometimes these things when we
[1:44:10] look at it it's more when I look at
[1:44:12] these statements here and experience it
[1:44:14] in my life it's a time where we even
[1:44:16] have to say lord help me to release it
[1:44:19] all I don't want to just say it and say
[1:44:22] yep that's what I need to do but lord
[1:44:24] help me help me to release it all into
[1:44:27] your hands I don't want to take it back
[1:44:29] home with me I don't want to pack this
[1:44:31] around with me I need your strength Lord
[1:44:34] that you will guide me help me to place
[1:44:37] it all into your hands why so you can
[1:44:41] live life

[1:44:58] you read you coverage it's a couple more
[1:45:02] come you feeling pressured same brother

[1:45:59] don't want to be found taking offered
[1:46:00] the devil but you understand what I'm

[1:54:52] there's a longing in our soul because
[1:54:55] there's been a pressure released of the
[1:55:00] guilt of sin the desire and the love of
[1:55:04] the world has taken flight there's a
[1:55:08] witness of that other land that's moved

[1:57:20] able to relate and vice versa there's
[1:57:22] certain stresses and pressures Lord just
[1:57:25] like little glimpses that I can see in

[1:57:36] but I but I hear it I hear it Lord when
[1:57:39] we would sit down as a husband and wife
[1:57:41] and things Lord God as we would talk and
[1:57:44] express but I'm glad that we can pray

[1:58:00] given us that we can come where we can
[1:58:02] still meet and preach the revealed word
