[0:00] based on the request and in God's in in
[0:03] now here in this place this request that
[0:06] is given that that what Ruth is actually
[0:09] asking for is she's asking him to take
[0:13] her in marriage for that of redemption
[0:16] and and as he speaks and as he speaks to
[0:18] her you know this the type with her and
[0:20] I'm not going to dwell I spoke on this a
[0:23] little bit before I'm not going to dwell
[0:24] on it but when she comes here into this
[0:27] place she's asking him to spread your
[0:30] skirt over me or or that part of that
[0:34] garment because I am thy handmade. She's
[0:37] asking him for his protection to claim
[0:40] her as wife.
[0:42] &gt;&gt; Now, this in itself was something that
[0:44] was it's a signification there. There's
[0:47] scriptures that we can go into and we
[0:49] covered that on in Ezekiel of how that
[0:51] God, the only way that you and I come
[0:54] under the full protection of almighty
[0:57] God is that he spreads his garment over
[1:00] us. And what garment is that? It's the
[1:02] garment of his word. It's the garment of
[1:04] the Holy Spirit. What was it that Elisha
[1:07] requested? I want a double portion. And
[1:09] it was Elijah who threw the mantle back.
[1:12] And the mantle itself fit Elisha. Elisha
[1:15] was cut, was molded, was shaped that
[1:18] when the garment came, he could put the
[1:20] garment on. It's the same thing that
[1:22] when when this is placed upon our lives
[1:25] and I'm just going to very quickly you
[1:27] could see this approach with Ruth and
[1:28] then then the Jewish the customs they'll
[1:31] go on even now is many times they'll
[1:33] take this with that garment that prayer
[1:35] shaw and they'll put this over h you
[1:38] know in a wedding and it's showing that
[1:39] this this prayer shaw that belonged to
[1:41] the groom that now as husband and wife
[1:44] were under this protection we're joined
[1:47] together within this and here Ruth is
[1:50] asking looking for this this to be take
[1:53] me as your wife remember not just
[1:56] marriage but take me I I I want to be
[1:59] one this is it's not just something that
[2:01] is just uh convenient but I I want to I
[2:04] I want you to be and fulfill that act of
[2:08] a kinsman upon my life and I want you to
[2:11] think of this in this term here when the
[2:14] scripture says in Ruth chapter 3 and
[2:17] verse 10 when in the script the one of
[2:20] the last ones We read there it says Ruth
[2:22] said or or Boaz responds to her and
[2:26] says, "Blessed be thou of the Lord, my
[2:29] daughter, for thou hast showed more
[2:32] kindness in the latter end than at the
[2:35] beginning." More kindness in there at
[2:39] the beginning. And this word kindness
[2:40] that we look at is the word uh that is
[2:44] it deals with it's an active expression.
[2:46] It's not something that's just uh it's
[2:49] just laying there and it's just you know
[2:51] as not being expressed but it's an
[2:53] active expression. Thou hast showed more
[2:57] kindness in the latter end than at the
[2:59] beginning. She showed kindness in the
[3:02] beginning but now in the latter end it's
[3:05] more kindness.
[3:07] Oh my. And we could just say so much
[3:09] there on that in this hour that God has
[3:12] given us. Listen, we're not expressing
[3:14] our own thoughts. We are expressing
[3:17] God's thoughts when we've taken that
[3:19] word into our life. It's not our ideas.
[3:22] We're not walking under the isms under
[3:25] the theology of man. Listen, I I'm not
[3:27] discounting that men made probes and
[3:30] they were looking into that there were
[3:32] truth that men received. But God came in
[3:35] this hour and vindicated that it was
[3:39] true and that it had come from him and
[3:42] he rightfully divided it and placed it
[3:45] accordingly in restoring the altar of
[3:48] the Lord. And in this hour, listen,
[3:51] listen, in this hour, the Luther
[3:53] Luther's age could not express or let me
[3:56] just say it like this, the Ephesian age
[3:58] could not express what you and I have
[4:01] been called to express. Because when the
[4:03] church ages began, the the the the
[4:06] church was already a fallen woman.
[4:09] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? But in this hour, it
[4:12] is a promise of a full restoration. Not
[4:15] come back to the Ephesian age, but the
[4:18] alpha has become the omega.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; The same seed that went in the ground
[4:23] has now become expressed. So you and I,
[4:26] the God has called us. It's because of
[4:29] the position of the hour. It's God
[4:32] moving in this hour for a deeper
[4:34] expression. That's why the expression of
[4:37] justification. Wonderful. But it's not
[4:40] enough for a real believer.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:43] &gt;&gt; They go on. There's got to be a
[4:44] sanctifying, a cleaning out of all the
[4:47] all the all the things of the world and
[4:49] desires of the world. It's a deeper
[4:51] expression. And it's got to come to the
[4:53] expression where the Holy Spirit himself
[4:55] setting down on the inside and bringing
[4:58] forth the very literal life of Jesus
[5:01] Christ. This is the hour of the latter
[5:04] kindness is in a greater measure than
[5:07] what it was in the former.
[5:11] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying?
[5:13] &gt;&gt; When you started walking with God, oh
[5:15] my, what a tremendous thing. But your
[5:18] faith, it continues to build unto the
[5:21] place where Christ himself moves into
[5:24] our lives in the very depth of the
[5:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost. And then
[5:29] through that word working in our lives
[5:31] and prevailing and overcoming, what is
[5:33] it? It's an active expression of the
[5:37] living God working in our lives.
[5:40] &gt;&gt; Let me just look at this here in the
[5:41] scripture just for a moment. the same
[5:43] word. Here we find Abraham coming and
[5:47] Abraham or not Abraham but Eleazar. Here
[5:50] he is right here at the point where
[5:52] coming to to Rebecca and he says, "Oh
[5:54] Lord God of my master Abraham, I pray
[5:56] thee send me good speed this day and
[5:59] show kindness unto my master Abraham."
[6:02] What kindness would that be? Direction,
[6:06] leadership, guidance. uh bring me to the
[6:09] place where Abraham has sent me to get a
[6:12] bride for his son Isaac. Show me
[6:15] kindness today. Verse 14. And let it
[6:18] come to pass that the damsel to whom I
[6:20] shall say, let down thy picture, I pray
[6:23] thee, that I may drink, and she shall
[6:25] say, drink, and I will give thy camels
[6:27] drink also. Let the same be she that
[6:30] thou hast appointed for thy servant
[6:32] Isaac. And thereby shall I know that
[6:35] thou hast showed kindness unto my
[6:38] master. Oh, hallelujah. Aren't you
[6:40] thankful for the leadership of the Holy
[6:42] Spirit? That's God's kindness.
[6:45] &gt;&gt; It's not what we deserve. But notice
[6:47] knowing, Lord, I need I need your
[6:50] kindness, your expression, your
[6:51] direction, your leadership. And he's
[6:54] worshiping.
[6:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[6:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. And he said, "Blessed be
[6:58] the Lord God of my master Abraham." This
[7:01] is after Rebecca has come out. Who hath
[7:03] not left destitute my master of his
[7:06] mercy and his truth. I being in the way,
[7:10] the Lord, led me to the house of my
[7:13] master's brethren. In Genesis 32:9, here
[7:17] is Jacob now in his return to Bethl. Oh
[7:20] God of my father Abraham, God of my
[7:23] father Isaac, the Lord which saidest
[7:26] unto me, return unto thy country, and to
[7:29] thy kindred, I will deal well with thee.
[7:32] Am I not worthy of the least of all thy
[7:35] mercies, and of all the truth which thou
[7:38] hast showed unto thy servant? Let me ask
[7:41] you, did Jacob deserve what he had? All
[7:45] of the the flocks, he said, here, I'm
[7:47] two bands. He's letting it be known.
[7:49] God, I don't deserve.
[7:51] I don't deserve. He's in a place. He's
[7:54] in a place. Such a wonderful place at
[7:56] that moment is accepting God's
[7:59] expression of kindness.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. In Genesis 39:21, the
[8:05] Lord was with Joseph and showed him
[8:09] mercy and gave him favor in the sight of
[8:12] the keeper of the prison. In Exodus
[8:15] 15:13, "Thou in thy mercy hast led forth
[8:20] the people which thou hast redeemed.
[8:22] Thou hast guided them in thy strength
[8:25] unto thy holy habitation." Aren't you
[8:28] thankful for his leadership,
[8:30] &gt;&gt; his guidance, he's guiding us every step
[8:33] of the way. Oh friends, he's sent his
[8:36] angel before us to guide us, to lead us,
[8:40] and to bring us into that prepared
[8:42] place. Amen.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Exodus 34:6 and 7. The Lord passed by
[8:46] before Moses and said, "The Lord, the
[8:49] Lord God, merciful and gracious and
[8:52] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[8:55] and truth, keeping mercy for thousands,
[8:59] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[9:01] sin, that will by no means clear the
[9:04] guilty, visiting the iniquity of the
[9:05] fathers upon the children and upon the
[9:08] children's children unto the third and
[9:10] fourth generation." In Deuteronomy 7:9,
[9:13] know therefore that the Lord thy God, he
[9:16] is God and faithful God, which keepeth
[9:19] covenant and mercy with them that love
[9:22] him and keep his commandments to a
[9:24] thousand generation. I want you to
[9:26] notice these scriptures that I've just
[9:28] read. Even in Exodus there, it speaks of
[9:31] how that these this mercy was kept. It
[9:35] was reserved. It was laying within God
[9:38] the whole time, knowing there would be
[9:40] that that was needed and a people on
[9:43] whom that mercy would be poured out
[9:45] upon. Mercy is not what we deserve.
[9:49] Mercy keeps from us what we do deserve.
[9:53] &gt;&gt; If we got what we deserve, we'd get
[9:55] hell.
[9:57] &gt;&gt; It's not what we deserve. God said,
[9:59] "I've kept it reserved.
[10:02] &gt;&gt; I'm not run out of mercy. I'm a God who
[10:04] is rich in mercy
[10:07] &gt;&gt; and he's willing. God's Let me tell you
[10:09] something. God's not one that's a penny
[10:11] pincher. He loves to express his mercy.
[10:15] And his mercy being expressed is when he
[10:18] begins to deal with our life, begin to
[10:20] lead us, begins to guide us. And as our
[10:23] lives will yield and respond to that and
[10:26] say, "Oh Lord Jesus," and making that
[10:28] appeal and that request, oh friends, the
[10:32] mercy of God begins to move and go to
[10:35] work and move through our lives. I tell
[10:38] you how many times that God has moved
[10:40] for us in healing our bodies. How many
[10:43] times God has moved for us, delivering
[10:44] us where in our minds we were tormented
[10:47] in our minds where it seemed like maybe
[10:48] you couldn't go to sleep or rest or this
[10:51] problem or this situation. I don't know
[10:53] how I'm going to get out of it. Lord, I
[10:54] don't know what to do. But here you're
[10:56] standing right there. You don't maybe
[10:57] feel anything, but you're saying, "I'm
[10:59] going to speak to this sea. I'm going to
[11:01] speak to this water." You know what that
[11:03] is? That's the mercy of Almighty God.
[11:05] It's an active expression of God's own
[11:08] nature. And what does he do? He comes on
[11:11] the scene.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; He comes on the scene.
[11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; He's the living God.
[11:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, he is.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; I say, "Praise be to God."
[11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; Joshua 2, here's Rahab. Therefore, I
[11:26] pray you, swear unto me by the Lord,
[11:29] since I've showed you kindness,
[11:32] that you will also show kindness unto my
[11:35] father's house.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:36] &gt;&gt; And give me a true token.
[11:39] Right.
[11:41] I don't. Here she is. I've heard about
[11:44] Joshua.
[11:46] That's why that's why I I I I I brought
[11:49] you into the house. I've heard about the
[11:51] destroying angel. I've heard about this
[11:53] message. I've heard what God is doing.
[11:57] God's name is being made manifest. Lord,
[12:00] &gt;&gt; the fear is upon all the people. But
[12:03] notice her request. It wasn't just to
[12:06] bring the spies into her home,
[12:08] &gt;&gt; right? It wasn't just to have fellowship
[12:11] around the message. It was to get under
[12:14] it.
[12:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[12:15] &gt;&gt; She made an appeal
[12:17] &gt;&gt; to the kinsmen. She made an appeal to
[12:20] Almighty God. She made an appeal. You
[12:23] know, you say, "Well, she was asking
[12:24] those men." She realized those men's
[12:26] were God's representation.
[12:29] &gt;&gt; All right?
[12:30] &gt;&gt; And as she made an appeal, she
[12:32] recognized I need a true token. She had
[12:35] confidence. These men are able to
[12:37] minister to me the true token.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; And remember what what it was what it
[12:42] was. Take the scarlet court. It was
[12:44] already there in her house.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:48] &gt;&gt; Let me say this to you. The word that
[12:49] God has given, it was already here. God,
[12:52] that's why the opening of the seals,
[12:54] it's not a new word. It's God taking the
[12:56] cover off. Amen.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Where Satan wanted to water down the new
[13:00] birth and do away with the deity of
[13:02] Jesus Christ and teaching the baptism
[13:05] and titles, but God opened his word and
[13:08] showed you and I this is my provision
[13:11] for you. We just didn't know how to
[13:14] apply it.
[13:16] &gt;&gt; And that's what the word came to do was
[13:18] open up what was in our possession. Let
[13:21] us know as sons and daughters of God
[13:24] what belongs to us. And here's how to
[13:25] apply it.
[13:28] I tell you, if she applied it any other
[13:29] way, we wouldn't be reading about Rahab.
[13:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says, "By faith, Rahab."
[13:35] And you know what faith is? It's a
[13:36] revelation of God's will.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:38] &gt;&gt; It didn't matter how much she could not
[13:41] explain how her house was going to stand
[13:42] and the rest of the wall would fall.
[13:46] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Samuel, I I don't
[13:48] understand that." Well, let me just give
[13:49] you another one. I don't understand how
[13:51] that bush can be on fire and not be
[13:53] burnt.
[13:55] Let me give you another one. I don't
[13:57] understand how a man can have have the
[13:59] living fire of almighty God in his soul
[14:01] that'll burn out sin, burn out
[14:03] everything, and yet it doesn't destroy
[14:05] you and I, but rather it produces
[14:08] Christ.
[14:09] &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. You can't you can't
[14:11] explain that.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; You know what it simply was? They told
[14:14] her where to put it and she because her
[14:17] request was so urgent, she did in faith
[14:22] what God had spoke to her to do. Yes.
[14:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[14:29] &gt;&gt; And deliver our lives from death. Verse
[14:31] 14. And the men answered her, "Our life
[14:33] for yours, if you utter not this our
[14:35] business, and it shall be when the Lord
[14:37] hath given us the land that we will deal
[14:39] kindly and truly with thee."
[14:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory be to God. I'm glad there's
[14:45] coming even even a great a great
[14:48] expression on the change of our bodies.
[14:49] Aren't you? I
[14:51] &gt;&gt; I'm looking forward to that day.
[14:53] Amen.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Notice here in Ruth, remember when
[14:57] Naomi, here was Ruth and Orpha, they're
[14:59] leaving. They're leaving the land. Naomi
[15:02] is going back. They both start out with
[15:05] Naomi. But remember Naomi, she says this
[15:08] to her two daughter-in-laws. Go return
[15:11] each of you to your mother's house, and
[15:13] the Lord deal kindly with you as you
[15:17] have dealt with the dead and with me.
[15:19] The Lord grant you that you may find
[15:22] rest each of you in the house of her
[15:24] husband. Then she kissed them and they
[15:26] lifted up their voices and wept. Now let
[15:28] me just say this. God was not playing
[15:30] with words through Naomi.
[15:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:34] &gt;&gt; Because you see the Lord deal kindly. It
[15:38] was to that of a degree of of his
[15:42] kindness of his mercy. This is why,
[15:44] listen friends, it's not it's not uh you
[15:47] and I that is determining uh you know
[15:51] who receives what. This is all in God's
[15:54] economy.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Na as soon as Naomi said that I believe
[15:58] with all of my heart that no doubt if na
[16:00] if Orpha and Ruth would have returned I
[16:03] believe God would have dealt kindly with
[16:04] them but according
[16:08] &gt;&gt; according to the measure that they had
[16:10] received.
[16:11] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. You see, there's a
[16:13] difference between the bride and the
[16:15] church.
[16:17] &gt;&gt; The church is just content with Jesus as
[16:20] my savior.
[16:22] &gt;&gt; But that that's it.
[16:24] &gt;&gt; It might go on, you know, very very
[16:26] sparse. You might find, you know, there
[16:28] no doubt some still out there that you'd
[16:30] find even a sanctified life. That's very
[16:33] sparse. That's more of God's kindness to
[16:36] deliver from from from sin and the
[16:39] habits and the desires. But you notice
[16:42] that no doubt that them returning back.
[16:44] But for Ruth, they just couldn't
[16:46] register with Ruth. You know why? There
[16:48] was a deep calling to the deep.
[16:51] &gt;&gt; And let me just say this to you friends.
[16:53] That's why you or I cannot be satisfied
[16:57] with just uh status quo, just coming to
[17:00] church, just being around the message or
[17:02] just affiliation. It'll never do.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? Why is that? Why is there a
[17:08] longing in your heart? And let me just
[17:09] tell you that longing itself, even when
[17:12] we unite with that and the uniting with
[17:14] our kinsmen, our kinsmen uniting with
[17:17] us, it doesn't stop there. It's his life
[17:19] being reproduced through us. And that's
[17:22] the desire is Lord, take me over, Lord.
[17:24] I want to see more of you in my life and
[17:28] him moving in areas of our life.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; There's a growth that takes place in our
[17:34] life.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:40] But oh, when they find Boaz or Boaz, not
[17:44] when they find him, but when Naomi
[17:46] realizes
[17:48] who is filled you're in,
[17:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[17:50] &gt;&gt; She says, "Blessed be he of the Lord who
[17:52] has not left off his kindness
[17:55] &gt;&gt; to the living and to the dead." This
[17:57] man's a near kin unto us, one of our
[17:59] next kinsmen. So, thou hast showed more
[18:02] kindness in the latter end than at the
[18:06] beginning. This is where it really begs
[18:09] the question for us just to pause and
[18:11] think about this. What are we presently
[18:14] expressing?
[18:17] &gt;&gt; What are we presently expressing or what
[18:20] is being expressed from our life?
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:26] &gt;&gt; Because we we know we can't live on
[18:29] yesterday. It's what are we today?
[18:32] Is that right?
[18:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:33] &gt;&gt; We can't live on what things we're it's
[18:35] right now. What what are we today?
[18:37] Because we can see down through the
[18:39] scriptures where many who started
[18:41] wonderful fruits in the beginning and no
[18:45] fruit later on.
[18:48] Are you hearing me?
[18:49] &gt;&gt; We talked about that with Jacob and
[18:51] Esau. You talk we we mentioned some
[18:53] things about Deus on Thursday night.
[18:55] Deeus had some tremendous fruit, right?
[19:00] &gt;&gt; But later on we find he departs and goes
[19:04] his way. See, that's why we can't live
[19:07] on a past experience.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; There's no victory in just a past
[19:12] experience. Now, let me just clarify
[19:14] this. You each and everyone have must
[19:18] have an experience where you know that
[19:20] you have passed from death unto life.
[19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[19:25] &gt;&gt; And I'm not so interested in that you
[19:27] know a day or a time or this or that
[19:29] because brother Brandham never took that
[19:31] with sister Bruce when she was asking
[19:33] the question in other places. But those
[19:35] things are expressed through the message
[19:37] because there what it is there's got to
[19:39] come a settleness in our heart.
[19:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a settleness by the word
[19:45] that you know you've met God personally
[19:48] and you know that God has changed your
[19:50] life that you are no longer the same.
[19:55] &gt;&gt; There's got to be that settleness
[19:56] because when that has come listen
[19:58] friends when that's come that's where
[20:01] the expression of a son and daughter of
[20:02] God lives from because that's what
[20:04] really makes you or places you as a son
[20:08] and daughter of God. Right?
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Just let let me let me let me move on
[20:12] here just a little bit. You could we
[20:13] could parallel this all the way through
[20:15] Uzziah, Isaiah, and so forth. But you
[20:17] know, there had to come the right
[20:19] approach and the right approach. So
[20:21] there's the right request. Here's the
[20:23] right approach. I love this scripture
[20:25] out of Psalm 65 and 4. It says, "Blessed
[20:29] is the man whom thou choosest and
[20:33] causeest to approach unto thee, that he
[20:36] may dwell in thy courts, we shall be
[20:40] satisfied with the goodness of thy
[20:42] house, even of thy holy temple." Notice
[20:45] whom thou choosest and causes, not not
[20:49] the man who chooses you, but whom thou
[20:51] chooses and calls us to approach. Now,
[20:54] it is a choice that we make, but it's
[20:56] not us choosing God. It's us reflecting
[21:00] the choice that God made concerning our
[21:03] life. That's what it is. Listen, it
[21:05] wasn't God who was lost. We were lost.
[21:08] &gt;&gt; But blessed is that man whom God chooses
[21:11] and calls us to approach.
[21:13] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. It It takes God. And we
[21:16] know there's a way to approach
[21:18] everything. And you know, a young man
[21:20] going to, you know, approach a young
[21:21] lady, just don't walk up and grab her
[21:23] hand and say, "Hey, how you doing?" And
[21:25] and you know, I'd like to kind of get to
[21:26] know you. I mean, he may get slapped for
[21:28] that right there because there's a right
[21:30] approach. You would not walk into an
[21:33] interview that you're going into and
[21:35] walk in there, you know, uh I know we're
[21:38] living in a different age, but you know,
[21:39] walk in there with, you know, holy pants
[21:41] and, you know, walk in there with your
[21:42] your your shirt untucked and walking in
[21:45] with flip-flops and and coming in there
[21:47] and say, "Hey, I'm I'm here to interview
[21:49] for a job." Now, I get it, friends, if
[21:50] that's all that somebody has. But we we
[21:53] know we're living in a time in an hour
[21:55] that you see things you see standards
[21:57] not being lived up to. But I'm not I'm
[21:59] not here to hop on it. What I'm here to
[22:00] point out is is that you would know that
[22:02] that's not the way of approach. You're
[22:04] not going to approach somewhere when you
[22:06] go into an interview. You come fitted
[22:08] for what you're trying to approach. And
[22:11] this is the same way with God. It's not
[22:14] Listen, the thing that's different is
[22:16] for an interview, you determine what
[22:18] you're going to wear, the colors you'll
[22:19] wear, the shoes you'll wear, the dress,
[22:21] or the suit or the tie. But that's not
[22:23] so with God. God already has what's
[22:26] needed in the approach and he'll only
[22:29] accept what he has provided. And what
[22:32] he's provided is the blood for you and I
[22:35] to come through. Is his word for you and
[22:37] I to come through. Adam tried another
[22:40] way to approach God. He made fig leaves
[22:43] and God rejected his approach because
[22:46] the only provided approach is through
[22:49] the shed blood of the lamb showing that
[22:52] there's one innocent that died in
[22:54] ourstead and you and I laying down our
[22:57] life laying and surrendering our life
[22:59] that Christ himself
[23:03] &gt;&gt; might move into our lives fully.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I'm the way, the truth, and
[23:08] the life. No man cometh unto the father
[23:10] but by me. We can't get to him outside
[23:13] of the word.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know that's why that if a
[23:17] person feels like they feel like they're
[23:19] in a stalemate. Listen, even if you're
[23:21] in a stalemate in your journey to the
[23:24] new birth and you recognize I'm not
[23:26] right there of what's being talked about
[23:28] where there's a real relationship where
[23:30] there is absolutely come a change in my
[23:33] life. Well, don't stop. Keep going. But
[23:37] allow God to evaluate your life. And
[23:39] Lord is am I coming in my own way? I
[23:43] don't want my own way cuz you won't
[23:44] accept my way. He didn't accept Cain's
[23:47] way. Cain had some awful good fruits.
[23:49] Kane had the best. He didn't put rotten
[23:52] tomatoes up there. Kane had the best. If
[23:54] Kane would have put his fruit out here
[23:55] at at at the Laurian County Fair, he'd
[23:58] had blue ribbons all over it. His name
[24:00] would have been in the front page of the
[24:01] Chronicle, the Morning Journal. It would
[24:03] have been top dog because everything he
[24:05] did, he poured himself into it. But what
[24:08] God was asking was for a surrender to
[24:12] his will. And God God s God moved out
[24:17] and confirmed that Abel's revelation
[24:19] that God sovereignly gave him was the
[24:22] right provided approach.
[24:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:26] &gt;&gt; So God's got a way to approach him. He's
[24:28] got a way through the word. This is why
[24:30] we evaluate our lives. And Lord, am I
[24:32] approaching you through the word? We
[24:33] begin to look even when it comes to
[24:35] every promise, whether it's for healing.
[24:38] &gt;&gt; I think we're living in a time, friends,
[24:40] that it just we we don't want to take
[24:43] things for granted.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just take everything
[24:46] as, well, this is a test or a trial.
[24:47] Just want to take it that way. We want
[24:49] to look at it and Lord, where's my life?
[24:51] Where am I standing?
[24:53] &gt;&gt; Where am I standing with you?
[24:55] &gt;&gt; We're living we're you know that that's
[24:57] the time we want that reflection in our
[24:59] life. Lord, where am I? Where am I
[25:01] standing with you? It's not my brother,
[25:03] not my sister, but it's me, Lord.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This is why that man man never
[25:11] seeks after God. It's God seeking after
[25:13] man.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We never sought God. God
[25:17] sought us. No man, Jesus said, can come
[25:20] to me except the Father which hath sent
[25:23] me. Draw him and I will raise him up at
[25:26] the last day. Brother Ram said, "Now in
[25:29] the message approach to God, he said
[25:31] it's the same thing today. Man cannot
[25:33] come to Christ except God calls him
[25:35] first." His nature, if you ever had any
[25:38] nature, any thought of anything of
[25:41] coming to God, God is dealing with you.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[25:47] Amen. He says we cannot come to God
[25:50] except through Christ. And the Holy
[25:52] Spirit has to call us first or we'll
[25:54] never think nothing of it. It'll just go
[25:57] right on. Just think of the things of
[25:58] the world. Church is all right. Sure. I
[26:00] believe that's okay. But a real touch,
[26:02] God has to do it.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; I say hallelujah.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. God thought it was God. It's not
[26:10] us, but it was God seeking us out.
[26:13] Blessed is the man whom thou choostth
[26:17] and cause us to approach that we may
[26:19] dwell in thy courts. not not just go and
[26:23] and come, but I want to dwell in your
[26:26] presence, Lord.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; I want to abide. I want the Holy Spirit,
[26:29] the abiding dove, walking in my life. I
[26:33] want that presence. I want your life. I
[26:35] want you, Lord. Everywhere I go, I want
[26:37] them to know, Lord, I'm a Christian. Not
[26:39] because of of making myself odd. I want
[26:41] him to I want there's a there's a life.
[26:43] There's an atmosphere there. There's
[26:45] there's something different about my
[26:46] life. Not me making myself different,
[26:48] but Christ in me.
[26:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. It makes me different. It sets me
[26:53] apart. It changed my desires, changed my
[26:55] nature.
[26:57] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "It isn't him that
[26:59] willth or him that runth. It's God that
[27:00] shows mercy."
[27:02] &gt;&gt; That's the scripture. So, it isn't how
[27:04] much you try, it's how much God has done
[27:07] for you.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; And if you've got enough God to come out
[27:10] here tonight, this morning, a desire to
[27:13] come hear the message, you ought to be
[27:15] the happiest person in the city because
[27:18] God is moving in your life. He's trying
[27:21] to lead you to the fountain. He loves
[27:24] you.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; So, it must be the right atmosphere, the
[27:32] right request, the right approach, the
[27:35] right atmosphere. And that atmosphere
[27:37] that I'm speaking of is an atmosphere of
[27:40] faith.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Because it is an atmosphere of faith
[27:44] that brings forth the promises of God.
[27:47] And it's not something that we work
[27:49] ourselves up into or or anything, but it
[27:53] is one thing that will bring faith. And
[27:56] that is the word of God. It's the spirit
[27:59] of God taking his word and beginning to
[28:02] speak his word to our hearts and to our
[28:05] lives. It creates an atmosphere. It
[28:08] drives back doubt. It drives back
[28:10] unbelief. It drives back spirits that
[28:13] have wanted to cloud and try to hinder.
[28:15] It's it's God himself. Who was it that
[28:18] created the right atmosphere in the
[28:20] beginning? It was God in the beginning
[28:23] who said, "Let there be light." And when
[28:25] he said, "Let there be light," the
[28:27] shakina glory followed the word that was
[28:30] spoken. And he manifested that word and
[28:33] the atmosphere over this earth changed.
[28:35] What? It became an atmosphere for the
[28:38] word to come to pass.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This is why the scripture
[28:43] said, "Without faith, it's impossible to
[28:45] please God. For he that cometh to God
[28:48] must believe that he is, and he's a
[28:50] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[28:52] him." Oh, brother and sister, it's not
[28:54] you creating faith. It's not me, it's
[28:57] God that's creating the faith.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; That's why, oh God, the atmosphere of
[29:03] the Holy Spirit, the preaching of the
[29:06] word. Amen. There's an atmosphere that's
[29:09] being created that what that will begin
[29:12] to deal with our lives, begin to move on
[29:14] our hearts and for the needs, the
[29:17] desires that we have in him when we can
[29:20] recognize I'm in his presence. Oh, you
[29:22] might say, I believe the scripture where
[29:24] two or three agree
[29:26] he'll be in our midst. I believe that,
[29:28] too. But Lord, we need to see your
[29:31] presence. Lord, we need to stand upon
[29:34] that word. Lord, I'm here. I'm not come
[29:36] to church just to fulfill a duty, but
[29:39] I'm here, Lord, to enter in to the
[29:41] atmosphere. And this atmosphere is not
[29:44] just something that stays here. It's an
[29:46] atmosphere that goes with you. It
[29:49] doesn't leave you. I don't care where
[29:51] your feelings are at. The atmosphere
[29:53] remains
[29:56] &gt;&gt; because when faith has dropped,
[30:00] &gt;&gt; it's settled.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; But without faith, it's impossible to
[30:03] please him. Yes. Amen.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; This is why when a person comes to God
[30:09] first time here they are the preaching
[30:12] of the word waters of separation begins
[30:15] to deal with their heart and begins to
[30:17] call out sin. But you know
[30:20] when that begins to take place and their
[30:22] heart just begins to respond and hear
[30:25] the heart the way that it is and God
[30:27] what's God doing? It's his provided way.
[30:30] Remember the provided way of approach.
[30:32] you you just don't come any way. But
[30:34] there's there's a provided approach. And
[30:36] God begins to bring his word, the
[30:38] washing of water by the word, and begins
[30:40] to move upon our life and beginning to
[30:43] change our desires, beginning to to melt
[30:45] away unbelief. And then you say, "Well,
[30:48] uh, you know, Brother Samuel, what what
[30:51] what do I have to do?" What you have to
[30:53] do is believe.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:57] &gt;&gt; You hear me?
[30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; All you have to do is believe. Let me
[31:01] tell you down in Egypt when they went
[31:04] over and they had to take the lamb, slay
[31:08] the lamb, and then they had to take the
[31:10] blood and put it upon the door. You know
[31:12] what? They put it on the door with
[31:16] hissup.
[31:18] Brother Brandham words it like this. I
[31:19] to me I'm thankful for God doing it like
[31:22] this, pulling it there from the
[31:23] scriptures.
[31:24] &gt;&gt; Hup is common faith. Yes sir.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said hissup it grows
[31:30] everywhere.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what you understand
[31:32] when brother Ram saying that it's all
[31:34] around you. It's not something way out
[31:36] here. I got to send up and get it or I
[31:38] got to go down there and get it. It's
[31:39] navy even in my mouth.
[31:43] That's why the prophet said when the
[31:44] Holy Spirit is here to inspire you,
[31:47] speak that word that he's inspiring to
[31:49] your heart
[31:51] &gt;&gt; and he'll make your body obey your
[31:54] confession because it's not you saying
[31:56] to this mountain,
[31:58] &gt;&gt; it is Christ through you
[32:00] &gt;&gt; speaking to this mountain.
[32:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; I have to read this.
[32:10] Brother Brandon says that red scarlet,
[32:11] that hissup, he applies it with common
[32:14] faith that a 2-year-old child could use.
[32:17] I thank God for that. I'm glad faith.
[32:20] Faith is not complimented complicated.
[32:23] Faith is very simple. It's just simple.
[32:25] Just like if you tell a 2-year-old, they
[32:27] say, you say, "Be ready. Dinner's going
[32:28] to be ready in so many minutes or this
[32:31] is going to, you know what? Daddy's
[32:32] going to get you a bicycle." You know
[32:34] what happens? They'll bug you and bug
[32:36] you and bug you as soon as you said
[32:38] something like that.
[32:39] It's simple. You know, sometimes we
[32:41] become too too much up here. And you
[32:44] know what up here is? We begin to look
[32:46] at ourselves and we somehow look at
[32:48] ourselves and reason whether we're not
[32:50] we're worthy. You'll never be worthy.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; We're not worthy of what promise of God.
[32:58] &gt;&gt; It's not what we could do. The best that
[33:00] we could do are filthy rags.
[33:03] That's why we needed the love of God,
[33:06] the kindness of God to be expressed
[33:09] through our life.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz I couldn't get to God. You couldn't
[33:13] get to God. But God came down to where
[33:16] you and I was.
[33:18] &gt;&gt; We didn't find this message. This
[33:20] message found you and I.
[33:22] [Applause]
[33:26] Hallelujah. You might say, I said in a
[33:29] message church for 10 years, the message
[33:31] found you.
[33:35] Hallelujah. He found you and you begin
[33:37] to realize, I need the kinsman. I need
[33:41] him. I need that Mike Boaz. I need that
[33:44] living God who sent this message. I need
[33:48] him.
[33:49] [Applause]
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, glory be to God in the
[33:57] highest. Just believe on the Lord Jesus
[33:59] Christ.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:03] Hallelujah.
[34:04] Oh my. Oh, brother Samuel, you need to
[34:07] tell him to quit doing this and quit
[34:08] doing that. Look, I'm not saying that
[34:10] there ain't things that a person don't
[34:11] need to quit doing, but let me just tell
[34:13] you something. Don't get the cart before
[34:15] the horse.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:19] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say you're sanctified.
[34:21] It said you're justified by faith.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; There's a power of God under salvation.
[34:27] Don't try to clean yourself up. Believe
[34:29] on him. And when you believe on him,
[34:32] sanctification will follow belief in the
[34:36] word.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit follows belief in the
[34:40] word.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Don't look at yourself.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; If Ruth would have looked at herself,
[34:48] think of the pedigree she had.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Moabitete.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Think of everything that was in her
[34:54] background.
[34:55] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. Let me just tell you
[34:57] something. You've got a background
[34:59] that's much deeper than the background
[35:01] you were trapped in.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; And what's more important than the
[35:04] background you were trapped in is that
[35:06] background that comes from the
[35:08] background of God's mind.
[35:11] &gt;&gt; You were always a son and daughter of
[35:13] God.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; When you were trapped into this, but you
[35:18] couldn't get yourself out of the trap.
[35:20] But God himself, God rich in mercy, our
[35:23] kinsman, our boss, came down and became
[35:27] one of us. And he paid the price.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; He's a worthy man, an honorable man, and
[35:33] he was able to do it.
[35:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:44] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bam says we say quit
[35:46] doing this, quit doing that. He said,
[35:47] "You make it so high like a coconut tree
[35:49] that somebody's got to climb to the top
[35:51] before they can ever see in."
[35:54] &gt;&gt; So, just get an atmosphere of faith. He
[35:57] said, "Then they'll know how to act and
[35:58] how to go about in God's word." You see
[36:00] what I'm saying, friends? It God comes
[36:02] with faith to drive out what is unclean,
[36:05] what's not like him. And I'll tell you,
[36:07] there's nothing more powerful than faith
[36:09] in God's word.
[36:12] when you begin to confess what God has
[36:15] done for you. Look, when God saves a
[36:17] person's life and how many knows what
[36:19] that was like when you felt the burdens
[36:21] lifted off your life?
[36:22] &gt;&gt; I remember that. You know what? You
[36:25] begin to confess, I'm saved. You begin
[36:27] to tell your associates, "I'm saved. I'm
[36:30] different. I no longer do these types of
[36:32] things. I'm not going those kind of
[36:33] places." and watch the spirit of God
[36:36] will follow and work righteousness in
[36:39] your life because he is a faithful and
[36:42] merciful high priest.
[36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:52] &gt;&gt; Oh boy, I feel good, man.
[36:57] &gt;&gt; How can I have that faith, brother
[36:59] Brandham? It's just as simple as
[37:02] reaching and getting the hissip to ply
[37:04] the blood. Believe it for yourself.
[37:06] Believe that Christ died for you.
[37:08] Believe that he was the innocent one
[37:10] that died in your place as a sinner and
[37:11] guilty. And the same applies by divine
[37:14] healing. Just simple faith to take him
[37:17] at his word.
[37:21] &gt;&gt; Now, we've heard this repeated a lot,
[37:23] but it's the truth.
[37:26] When the worshipper came to worship and
[37:29] he brought his sacrifice, the priest
[37:32] never inspected the worshipper.
[37:42] &gt;&gt; He looked at his sacrifice to make sure
[37:46] the sacrifice met the qualifications.
[37:50] [Applause]
[37:53] And you say, "Well, he ain't looking at
[37:54] me." Look, you're standing there with
[37:56] him. If you'll take his word into your
[37:58] heart, you're standing there with his
[38:00] word. That's showing your confidence and
[38:02] belief in that word. He's looking at
[38:05] that word. He has taken your sin debt.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:13] &gt;&gt; It's not your righteousness. It's his
[38:15] righteousness.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; It's not your worthiness, it's his
[38:19] worthiness.
[38:22] Let me tell you the rapture on that
[38:25] morning will not be because of our
[38:27] worthiness. The rapture is the
[38:30] worthiness of almighty God.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; It's the righteousness of God taking
[38:35] place in our lives.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; It's Satan's business and duty to get us
[38:40] looking at ourselves.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that we don't have to
[38:44] look at wrong and repent of it, but you
[38:46] don't have to dwell there. You don't
[38:48] have to stay there. Listen, even if you
[38:50] listen, even for you to repent, you've
[38:52] got to have faith in his word. For he
[38:54] said, "If you sin, my little children,
[38:56] you have an advocate with the father,
[38:59] Jesus Christ the righteous, who is the
[39:01] propitation for all sin."
[39:04] &gt;&gt; You've got to have faith in your lamb.
[39:08] [Applause]
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. The reason sometimes
[39:11] we get down and we're tripping over our
[39:13] lips and everything else, I'm not saying
[39:15] when we fail, we don't feel bad. But
[39:17] you've got to realize you've got a
[39:19] propitation.
[39:20] [Music]
[39:22] &gt;&gt; I thank God there's a conviction. Thank
[39:24] God for that. I'm glad I'm glad it's not
[39:26] well, you know, I've got a lamb. No, you
[39:28] realize I've got a lamb here. He said he
[39:31] never leave me nor forsake me. I'm tied
[39:33] in there with my sacrifice. My desire is
[39:37] to please him.
[39:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The simplicity of faith in
[39:48] Jesus Christ by what hiss. It's right
[39:51] there.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Apply it.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; It's right there.
[39:56] &gt;&gt; So, it's got to come at the right time.
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[40:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:01] &gt;&gt; It's got to be at the right time.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; And notice with this being at the right
[40:09] time,
[40:11] think back in scriptures with me.
[40:15] Naomi
[40:18] upon the first of them coming in the
[40:21] land. And even when Ruth came back to
[40:23] her
[40:25] loaded,
[40:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Loaded with meal.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Ruth came back skipping. If I could
[40:33] skip, I would. Skipping, dancing.
[40:39] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. Naomi
[40:43] doesn't even speak to her at that moment
[40:46] in some of the closing verses of Ruth
[40:49] chapter 2 and say,
[40:52] "Go to him now.
[40:55] Go to Boaz now." But she makes known,
[40:57] remember, blessed be the Lord that hath
[41:00] not left off
[41:02] &gt;&gt; his expression
[41:04] &gt;&gt; of faithfulness, kindness, mercy,
[41:09] &gt;&gt; but the instruction comes at the right
[41:12] time.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; It's at the right time. See, it all laid
[41:16] in the word. Listen, the word that's
[41:18] being fulfilled in this hour, it's
[41:20] always laid in the word.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Let let me let me tell you something.
[41:24] Naomi. Ruth loved Naomi,
[41:28] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:30] &gt;&gt; She loved We could go through many
[41:32] scriptures from the Old Testament and
[41:33] pulling these things in. She loved her.
[41:35] You know, you know what it shows? To be
[41:38] to be a lover of the word,
[41:40] &gt;&gt; to love the word. Jesus said, "If you
[41:42] keep my commandments, if you love me,
[41:44] keep my commandments,
[41:46] &gt;&gt; and my father and I will come and make
[41:48] our abode in you." You see, it's it's
[41:50] God working to just to take that word
[41:52] and begin to feed on that word.
[41:55] I I I want to just be very simple and
[41:57] drop this in. There's there's desires.
[42:01] There's questions.
[42:03] What do where do I go from here? What's
[42:05] the next step that I make? Where do I
[42:07] move? How do I how do I move on? You
[42:09] know what that is? When those questions
[42:11] come come to me, it shows that I'm
[42:14] talking about questions coming from to
[42:16] me. What it's showing is it's God
[42:18] dealing with the heart. It's ready for
[42:21] that next step.
[42:22] &gt;&gt; It's ready for that next move. It's
[42:24] ready for that part of it. It's ready
[42:26] for that. Listen, this is why even with
[42:28] the rapture coming on, we're not saying,
[42:30] "Oh Lord, delay thy coming. Oh God, Lord
[42:34] Jesus, just put it off until I can Lord,
[42:37] I want to retire. I want to, Lord, just
[42:40] be able to set on the beaches of South
[42:42] Carolina." I mean, that's not me. That's
[42:44] what I think of retirement, but maybe of
[42:46] you. At anyhow, um that's not it.
[42:50] &gt;&gt; We're praying and we're longing. Listen,
[42:52] let me just tell you something. Brother
[42:54] Bram says those that he's coming for are
[42:56] those that's living
[42:58] &gt;&gt; for his coming.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:01] &gt;&gt; Living for his coming.
[43:03] &gt;&gt; That at any moment, it's the right the
[43:05] right time.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; The right time, the right season.
[43:10] So within this right within this right
[43:12] time, this is the moment that she begins
[43:17] to make known to Ruth.
[43:21] Ruth, here it is.
[43:23] This is where he's at. Naomi says, "I
[43:26] can tell you where he's at. And this is
[43:30] the time." He's our He's our kinsman.
[43:33] And she's already given her direction.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Didn't Naomi give her direction? Hey,
[43:37] hey, hey, hey, hey. Don't go to another
[43:39] field. Right?
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Don't just like brother Ram says, don't
[43:42] be chasing after this gift and chasing
[43:43] after that gift and chasing after this
[43:45] and stay in the field.
[43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Where he's revealing himself. Stay in
[43:50] his word.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; Stay in his word. Stay in the word.
[43:54] Don't Don't let anything get your
[43:55] attention away from that word. Stay with
[43:59] the word. Naomi gave her direction. And
[44:01] you know what? Ruth is not Ruth is not
[44:03] fully aware. She's under inspection the
[44:06] whole time,
[44:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:09] Because when Boaz even comes to her,
[44:11] he's able to tell her, "Uh, the Lord
[44:14] recompense unto thee and knowing all
[44:17] that you've done even from the
[44:18] beginning." And he's able to see she's
[44:21] under inspection. Friends, do you
[44:23] realize the Holy Spirit when God's
[44:25] dealing with the heart that that the
[44:27] sealing angel, he inspects the lives?
[44:30] &gt;&gt; He inspects hearts. you know, even for
[44:33] needs that we're praying for. Even when
[44:35] it comes for healing and and different
[44:37] things in our life, our body and and
[44:39] certain things we're praying about, you
[44:40] know, you know, God inspects, God looks
[44:43] after. God will not that God will not
[44:45] come over top of sin, but God works to
[44:48] deal with sin. This is why the prophet
[44:50] said, "Don't let anything get between
[44:53] you and that word. Amen.
[44:57] &gt;&gt; Don't let job, don't let family, don't
[45:00] let anything because let me tell you,
[45:02] let me tell you your job or anything
[45:04] else if if God gave you that job, it's
[45:06] God that gave it and God will give you
[45:08] the grace and the wisdom to keep it. And
[45:10] if there's anything that'll bring the
[45:12] family, the prophet tells us this in the
[45:14] Hebrew series. He said, "You get in the
[45:16] will of God, seek him first, and then
[45:19] the rest of the family will fall into
[45:23] the will of God."
[45:24] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[45:26] So, it's not what it's not us trying to
[45:29] do something, but Satan, he'll work upon
[45:30] our lives to try to get things between
[45:33] us and God.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:37] &gt;&gt; And then we get stuck in that place like
[45:38] we were preaching a few weeks ago in
[45:40] between desires.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; At the right time,
[45:47] Naomi knew at this appointed time of
[45:50] harvest, I know where he's at.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[45:54] I know what portion of the word he's in.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; I know what he's fulfilling right now.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; And not only does she make this known to
[46:02] Ruth, you realize in order for her to do
[46:04] this and Ruth to carry it out, Ruth has
[46:08] a heart that is receptive to the
[46:11] leadership to move to the kinsmen.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; She's able to do that. Ruth didn't have
[46:18] a living husband.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; Right.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; So, here she is. She's at a place to
[46:23] receive that and she knows this right
[46:26] approach and she tells Ruth how to go.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Go wash yourself.
[46:33] &gt;&gt; She didn't say take your clothes off but
[46:35] cover yourself up.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; That that's that's a scripture,
[46:40] &gt;&gt; right? And when to go when do I go? Do
[46:43] just just right now in this moment. You
[46:45] know it's a timing.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Right. Yeah,
[46:47] &gt;&gt; remember brother Ram talks about the
[46:49] little baby
[46:51] when of the man
[46:54] that had backslid and then Graham
[46:56] Snelling came to his house that night
[46:59] and brother Bram talks about remember
[47:00] the little it wasn't a baby sorry it was
[47:02] a little boy and he what brother Bram
[47:03] saw in a vision before this man ever
[47:05] came to his house and the little boy
[47:08] came running to brother Brandham across
[47:09] the room with a milk mustache
[47:13] and here this man pulls up and brother
[47:15] Brandham
[47:16] He says, "Bill," he says, "I've oh," he
[47:19] says, "I started to serve God once." And
[47:21] he begins to go down. He said, "But my
[47:23] little boy is laying at a point of dying
[47:25] right now. It's a bad shape, bad
[47:28] situation." He says, and I, he says, "I
[47:30] want to I want to come back to the
[47:31] Lord." And and Brother Bram begins to
[47:33] describe a few things. He says, "Say."
[47:35] He said, "Were you ever at my house?"
[47:37] Brother Bram said, "Yeah, I just was a
[47:38] few moments ago."
[47:41] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; In a vision.
[47:44] Now you remember when brother Bram comes
[47:45] into them talking about the right time.
[47:47] The right time.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; The word has already been revealed that
[47:50] the word is thus sayaith the Lord.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; When the prophet gets there to the
[47:55] house, he runs or walks over, takes the
[47:58] baby and immediately takes that child
[48:00] and prays for it. And the child got
[48:03] worse.
[48:05] &gt;&gt; Right?
[48:06] &gt;&gt; And you know why? It wasn't the right
[48:08] time.
[48:10] The word was right on the money.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; But the time this one had to be sitting
[48:17] over here,
[48:18] &gt;&gt; this one had to be in the room. This one
[48:20] had to be Now watch. You see how Satan
[48:22] could come around on that right there.
[48:24] How Satan was trying to no doubt bombard
[48:26] the prophet's mind. But the prophet knew
[48:29] God spoke this to me.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; I may not understand what's going on,
[48:34] but it's thus sayith the Lord.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me right now?
[48:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is why when God has made his
[48:41] word known to your heart, there might
[48:43] have been certain things that we thought
[48:44] or certain ideas and and maybe you
[48:47] walked away after having prayer and
[48:48] saying, "I'll never have a pain again."
[48:49] And you wake up with pain in the middle
[48:51] of the night and and you're in this
[48:52] right here. It doesn't mean
[48:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; that the word has not taken effect.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; But everything is in its time. They
[48:59] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[49:02] shall recover.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; Right.
[49:05] &gt;&gt; It didn't say how long. It didn't say
[49:07] how much time. It said they shall
[49:09] recover.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; And when God has made a promise to your
[49:13] heart.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; A promise is swept into your life.
[49:17] Promise for the Holy Spirit, promise for
[49:19] deliverance, promise for healing,
[49:21] promise for your loved ones,
[49:24] &gt;&gt; it shall be even as he has said.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; For he's not man that he should lie,
[49:30] &gt;&gt; nor the son of man that he should
[49:32] repent. Every promise that he has given
[49:34] is yay and amen in him.
[49:38] Hallelujah. And as a believing group of
[49:40] people, listen, we're standing here or
[49:42] drawn together for what? Then an
[49:44] atmosphere of faith is coming together
[49:46] as hearts begin to unite with that word
[49:49] and begin to pulsate. And what happens
[49:51] in moments?
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Where the right time begins to drop
[49:54] down.
[49:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm just going to stop here
[50:01] this morning. I could continue on, but
[50:04] we'll just stop here. He's got to know
[50:06] how to go,
[50:08] when to go, and what to do.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Everything is in the right timing.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Right.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; The when when the angel came down and
[50:19] troubled the water, that was the time.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; At a certain season. When? At a certain
[50:24] season.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Right. Sarah, I'm going to turn I'm
[50:28] going to return to you at the appointed
[50:29] time.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; Right. God has appointed times. And you
[50:34] know what? Let me just tell you
[50:35] something. The Bible talks about what a
[50:37] blessed thing it is to wait upon the
[50:40] Lord.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[50:42] &gt;&gt; And you know how, sister Carmen, you can
[50:43] really wait on God. Is when God gives
[50:45] you a promise, you can wait. Just like
[50:47] that little lady who the the sons or the
[50:52] owner's son made that promise, I'll be
[50:53] coming back in the springtime.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; She took that promise and she waited.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. She I'll tell you how she
[51:04] was waiting. She was waiting because she
[51:06] knew the sound of his coming.
[51:10] [Applause]
[51:11] [Music]
[51:13] &gt;&gt; And she was ready.
[51:15] &gt;&gt; She didn't look behind and and you know,
[51:17] waving off to those sisters, haha, and
[51:19] everything else. No, no, it wasn't about
[51:21] that. She She was so had been so in love
[51:24] with him to where when he came, she went
[51:27] to meet him.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; You know why? It wasn't about everybody
[51:30] else. It was about her responding.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; To him.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[51:37] The right time.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; The door of mercy being open. The time
[51:43] where the timing that we are living in.
[51:46] It's the right time. This is the hour
[51:49] and the season.
[51:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Where it speaks the marriage of the lamb
[51:54] has come. No other age. No other age.
[51:58] But in this age,
[52:00] No other time
[52:03] is it for rapture but this time.
[52:07] This is a it's no other time when this
[52:11] sealing taking place in this hour of the
[52:14] Holy Spirit. This is the timing. It's
[52:17] the time
[52:18] the bride coming into position.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; It's the right time. It's the right
[52:24] season. and how the spirit of God just
[52:27] dealing with our hearts to draw us and
[52:30] to understand there's the right approach
[52:32] to it. There's a how, when, and what to
[52:36] do.
[52:39] Hallelujah.
[52:40] And you know what? God was everything
[52:42] all along here. Friends, when we see
[52:44] where Ruth is at at this moment,
[52:47] the latter kindness,
[52:49] that faithfulness, what was in her heart
[52:53] was expressed.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Every handful of purpose she picked up,
[53:01] every inspired word along the way
[53:05] was building her faith
[53:08] &gt;&gt; to that moment.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:11] See, this is this is why Satan's busy.
[53:15] Like the prophet says in Christ the
[53:16] mystery, he says,
[53:19] God's wanting to reveal this great
[53:20] secret to you.
[53:22] And listen, friends, this great secret
[53:24] is not doctrines. This great secret
[53:28] is that God knew you before the
[53:31] foundation of the world.
[53:33] &gt;&gt; You were always one of his. And when the
[53:36] revelation when that secret becomes a
[53:38] revelation, it drops from here to here.
[53:43] Then it's the mystery of God in your
[53:47] life.
[53:50] &gt;&gt; Here, it's got to come from here to
[53:52] here. When it comes from here to here,
[53:54] that's what brings the change in a
[53:56] person's life.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; That's true. There's there's where
[53:59] there's an anchor, there's an absolute,
[54:02] there's a hold, there's a change,
[54:04] there's a love affair, there's a joy.
[54:06] Let me just say this to you. Sure, you
[54:08] can lose your joy, but let me ask you
[54:11] this. Sometimes the reason
[54:14] that things happen, joy and so forth is
[54:17] gone. It's because things priorities get
[54:20] off. Things get in in our lives.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it's unconfessed sin.
[54:27] Hello.
[54:29] And Satan, what Satan wants to do is
[54:32] stall.
[54:33] &gt;&gt; He wants to hinder.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; He doesn't look, Satan doesn't love any
[54:38] of his subjects. He don't even love
[54:39] those who serve him. He never loved us
[54:41] when we when we walked according to the
[54:42] princip,
[54:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[54:44] &gt;&gt; You know, he don't care. But Satan's
[54:46] desire is to try to stall and to try to
[54:49] hinder and try to keep back.
[54:52] But this is a moment and a time in this
[54:55] hour for the spirit of God just to
[54:57] really seeking us out. And Lord, if
[55:00] you've got a need upon your heart, let's
[55:02] make an appeal to our kinsmen. Let's
[55:06] make a request. Let me ask you
[55:07] something.
[55:09] Brother Brandham asked the question. He
[55:11] says, "Are we sufficiently impressed
[55:14] with the word that's in our midst?"
[55:17] And following that question, he says,
[55:19] "How do we pray?
[55:22] You say, "Well, brother Samuel, I
[55:24] haven't prayed in a long time." But but
[55:26] why?
[55:30] Why?
[55:32] See, unbelief enters in.
[55:35] Unbelief enters in. One little thing and
[55:37] then Satan wants to try to get you get
[55:40] you away. But what is he doing with that
[55:42] with that of unbelief? Because listen,
[55:44] smoking, drinking, all of those things
[55:47] are attributes of one thing, unbelief.
[55:51] If you believe, you won't do them.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. When you believe
[55:56] you, you won't do them. You know why?
[55:58] Because it changes you.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; But it's how are we how are we praying?
[56:04] Are we asking God, Lord, fulfill your
[56:06] word in my life? Lord, let it be in me,
[56:09] Lord. Let let the word Lord in my life
[56:13] the appeal to our kinsmen. I tell you,
[56:16] listen friends,
[56:18] only those who are united with him
[56:22] through the Holy Spirit, the token, are
[56:24] going in the rapture.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; That's why the the token, the new birth,
[56:31] it's not just something that's just
[56:33] optional. It's got to it's and it's not
[56:36] just something that's intellectual.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; It's got to be heartfelt.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; It's a reality that reflects through
[56:44] your life.
[56:45] And this is why that even through these
[56:47] things of just taking our time and this
[56:50] this morning is the appeal to our
[56:52] kinsmen. Don't just if you if you if
[56:54] you've been here and I know those that
[56:56] would be streaming and other things just
[56:58] don't you just don't want to sit around
[56:59] this message.
[57:01] &gt;&gt; Get into it.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Get under the blood. Yeah.
[57:07] &gt;&gt; Let the let the Holy Spirit invite him,
[57:09] the kinsman, to completely change your
[57:12] life and bring a real joy down in your
[57:14] life.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Let him do it. He wants to
[57:18] do it.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; He's already made a way to come and to
[57:21] do that. He's already paid the price.
[57:23] And you say, "What must I do? Do I got
[57:25] to quit this?" You don't have to quit
[57:27] anything. You have to believe him.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; Believe what he has done for you.
[57:33] And when you really believe, sin will
[57:36] stop.
[57:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:39] &gt;&gt; Unbelief stops.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Is that not what Paul said to the
[57:44] Philippian jailer? When the Philippian
[57:46] jailer says, "What must I do to be
[57:49] saved?" Paul never said, "Do this or
[57:52] stop doing this. Stop doing that. Quit
[57:54] doing this. Quit doing that. Quit doing
[57:55] this." Can you imagine? You'd have you'd
[57:58] have had to have books of what not to do
[58:02] or quit doing. But you know what? One
[58:04] thing can take place could take care of
[58:06] all of that.
[58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Truth.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Here this morning,
[58:14] that's where I would even make that
[58:16] request. Lord, help thou my unbelief.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Right.
[58:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Apply the word. Take the
[58:22] word of God that that you're hearing and
[58:24] apply that word to your life. Listen
[58:26] friends, don't just walk out but apply
[58:28] the word to your life. You got to apply
[58:30] the word. The token must be applied. The
[58:33] word has got to be applied to our life.
[58:35] When the word is applied, then the Holy
[58:37] Spirit follows the word.
[58:41] &gt;&gt; If Ruth would have stayed in Naomi's
[58:43] house
[58:45] &gt;&gt; and said, "Well, I'm just going to wait
[58:46] for Boas to come to me."
[58:53] &gt;&gt; It had never happened.
[58:56] It had never happened.
[58:59] &gt;&gt; But Ruth
[59:00] had to make the request
[59:03] &gt;&gt; that he was standing ready to fulfill.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Think how the prophet says in the
[59:10] message breach. He said to think he's
[59:13] standing ready.
[59:15] &gt;&gt; One heart that'll touch him.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; One life that'll confess their sin. One
[59:19] life. He said he stands ready
[59:22] &gt;&gt; to redeem.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, glory. He don't have to go to
[59:26] Calvary for one more sin. He took the
[59:29] sin of the whole world.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; He deposited all in hell. Even of all
[59:34] your mistakes and your let down, he
[59:35] don't have to go back one more time.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; He's already taken care of it. He took
[59:40] care of all of your unbelief.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; You just have to say, "Lord, I believe."
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Let's pray.
[59:51] Heavenly Father,
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; you're so merciful to us, Lord.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; You're mindful to
[1:00:07] every need in every circumstance.
[1:00:09] [Music]
[1:00:12] Lord,
[1:00:14] I don't know. I don't know all the
[1:00:17] needs. I don't know the request
[1:00:19] that's upon the hearts of your children
[1:00:23] or those that are here in the visible
[1:00:25] audience, those that would be streaming
[1:00:26] or would come back and archive this,
[1:00:29] Lord.
[1:00:31] I pray, Father.
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:34] Lord, may your grace just move down upon
[1:00:38] hearts, Lord.
[1:00:40] move down upon each of our lives,
[1:00:44] Lord, as we're we're standing in need of
[1:00:47] you, Lord.
[1:00:50] There's lives, Lord, that
[1:00:53] I know, Lord, need a real touch from
[1:00:55] you, Father.
[1:00:57] Maybe there's things, Lord, that they've
[1:01:00] went astray and they're just
[1:01:02] Satan. Lord, just
[1:01:05] get them so twisted, Lord, in their
[1:01:07] minds.
[1:01:09] Get him so twisted, Lord, in these
[1:01:11] things,
[1:01:14] Lord, hemmed in by sin and unbelief.
[1:01:17] But, Father,
[1:01:19] you're greater, Lord. You're greater,
[1:01:22] Lord, than that unbelief.
[1:01:26] You're greater than that doubt, Lord.
[1:01:30] And father I pray
[1:01:34] Lord knowing that that hold
[1:01:38] sometimes Lord through unbelief Lord
[1:01:40] that would want to just take a hold
[1:01:42] there. But I pray that God
[1:01:46] like Ruth when she came into your
[1:01:48] presence into the presence of Boaz
[1:01:53] she wasn't she wasn't fearing as far as
[1:01:57] slavish fear.
[1:01:59] Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; She came with the confidence.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; And Lord,
[1:02:06] I pray here this morning that
[1:02:09] Father, for the needs that we have among
[1:02:12] us, Lord, there's needs,
[1:02:16] God, lives, that
[1:02:19] need of the Holy Ghost.
[1:02:22] Need of a real a real birth. Lord,
[1:02:27] there's lies. There's hearts, Lord, that
[1:02:29] asking God, seeking for direction, Lord.
[1:02:34] Father, there's hearts and lives, Lord,
[1:02:36] that
[1:02:38] dear God, just desiring just just more
[1:02:41] of you, just the effect,
[1:02:45] Lord, through that relationship with you
[1:02:48] as our kinsmen.
[1:02:51] Oh God,
[1:02:54] when there's come that uniting
[1:02:57] where these
[1:02:59] that are twain have now become one,
[1:03:02] Lord, that sanctifying love begins to
[1:03:05] move in our lives.
[1:03:07] Oh, it
[1:03:09] it isn't so much, Lord of worldly
[1:03:12] desires, but you you move in our hearts,
[1:03:15] Lord, to be able to lift us in your
[1:03:16] grace. you begin to change, Lord, our
[1:03:19] thoughts and our opinions,
[1:03:23] oh God, I think, Lord, just like a
[1:03:26] natural husband, Lord, and and a wife,
[1:03:29] oh God, as they'll begin to fellowship,
[1:03:32] and there's things, Lord, that
[1:03:36] when they entered in, Lord, to that
[1:03:38] marriage
[1:03:40] now, Lord, there's just such a things
[1:03:44] change. There's a a resting
[1:03:47] where that Lord, that that little wife,
[1:03:49] she rests
[1:03:51] within what her husband
[1:03:54] has said about her. Right?
[1:03:58] and vice versa.
[1:04:00] He so delights in those praises and
[1:04:04] commendation where for her it can be the
[1:04:07] touch of the hand
[1:04:10] like your prophet would express Lord for
[1:04:12] that husband to the wife of how that she
[1:04:15] could just set him down and get on his
[1:04:17] lap and begin to tell him how thankful
[1:04:20] she is for him and the things and the
[1:04:23] care and what he will do and what he
[1:04:25] does. Lord, through that relationship,
[1:04:28] that marriage, it's a nourishing,
[1:04:34] Lord God,
[1:04:36] that's what you do in our lives, Lord.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah,
[1:04:41] through that uniting with our kinsmen,
[1:04:45] Lord. But it's like your prophet
[1:04:46] expressed it in the message die thigh
[1:04:47] house. He said when my wife he said that
[1:04:51] faith when it begins to move in your
[1:04:53] heart and it's dropped in your life and
[1:04:55] that conversion has taken place. He said
[1:04:57] it's like that love that you have for
[1:05:00] your wife. It begins to accumulate.
[1:05:05] Yet Lord
[1:05:07] this is so much more a higher love.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; It's your unconditional love.
[1:05:14] And it begins to lift us higher and
[1:05:17] higher and higher
[1:05:19] in the realms of grace
[1:05:22] as we can trust you and believe you.
[1:05:26] Lord, I pray God right here throughout
[1:05:29] this congregation,
[1:05:31] Lord Jesus, may you just move down by
[1:05:33] your grace, dismantle anything, Lord, in
[1:05:37] us,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. that would keep or hinder from
[1:05:42] believing you, Lord.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord Jesus.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; We're appealing, Lord, to you, our
[1:05:49] kinsmen.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Oh, granted, Lord God, we need you,
[1:05:55] Lord.
[1:05:57] There's needs, Lord, for healing in the
[1:05:58] body. There's needs, Lord, for
[1:06:00] deliverance. There's needs, Lord,
[1:06:03] direction, leadership in our lives.
[1:06:05] Lord, we're appealing to you, Lord. our
[1:06:08] kinsmen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; We don't want to make a step without
[1:06:13] your leading, Lord.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; It isn't that we're fearful. It's just
[1:06:18] Lord, we don't want to be out of your
[1:06:20] will. We don't want to be Lord God
[1:06:23] according to our own thinking. But Lord,
[1:06:25] we want the mind of Christ. Lord, help
[1:06:28] us, Lord. I pray, God.
[1:06:32] Grant it, Lord, for each need, Lord.
[1:06:36] Grant it, Father.
[1:06:39] Lord, we love you.
[1:06:42] We give ourselves to you, Lord. We give
[1:06:45] this congregation, myself, Lord, into
[1:06:47] your hands in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:06:51] Amen. And there's only
[1:06:56] one way to touch him.
[1:07:01] [Music]
[1:07:03] Just
[1:07:05] believe.
[1:07:06] When you call on
[1:07:10] his name
[1:07:13] Jesus,
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; oh
[1:07:16] you Jesus

[1:07:44] to judge him.

[1:07:56] his name.

[1:08:07] positions
[1:08:10] yet she grew worse. sold to Jesus.
[1:08:18] She came
[1:08:21] and when the crowd
[1:08:26] they tried to
[1:08:29] restrain her.
[1:08:32] She
[1:08:35] whispered
[1:08:37] these words through.

[1:09:24] his name.
[1:09:28] I was bound. I was bound when I knelt at
[1:09:35] the altar.
[1:09:39] But they
[1:09:41] said Jesus,
[1:09:44] he could meet all my need.
[1:09:50] And when this prisoner
[1:09:55] found me.
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:01] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:10:04] Set me free. Praise the Lord.

[1:10:31] It'll never
[1:10:33] be the same. And there's only
[1:10:39] one way
[1:10:41] to touch him.
[1:10:45] Just

[1:10:54] more time. Oh,

[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; I will share
[1:11:50] by a heavy
[1:11:55] burden.
[1:12:00] I was.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, yes.
[1:12:07] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:12:11] Oh, but
[1:12:15] the Jesus.
[1:12:23] Oh, and now
[1:12:29] No longer the same.
[1:12:32] Oh,

[1:12:39] Oh,
[1:12:42] he touched me.
[1:12:46] And
[1:12:48] oh,
[1:12:50] the joy that floods my soul.
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:56] Oh, I know that something
[1:13:01] has happened.
[1:13:03] And now I know
[1:13:11] he touched me
[1:13:14] and made
[1:13:17] me whole.
[1:13:22] Never since
[1:13:25] I met this
[1:13:27] said savior
[1:13:30] [Music]
[1:13:32] and ever since.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:13:44] For I shall never cease
[1:13:50] to praise him.
[1:13:54] Oh, I shall
[1:13:58] while eternal.
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:04] Oh,
[1:14:07] he touched me.
[1:14:09] Oh,
[1:14:12] he touched me.
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:19] Yes, Lord.
[1:14:24] Touch my soul
[1:14:29] something something has happened. Oh,
[1:14:34] and now, oh, I know
[1:14:40] he touched me.
[1:14:44] and make
[1:14:46] me whole.
[1:14:49] [Music]
[1:14:52] I want to live
[1:14:56] the way.
[1:14:59] He wants me
[1:15:02] to live. And I want to give
[1:15:08] until Christmas.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; I want to love
[1:15:21] love you. There's just no more love for
[1:15:28] I could never
[1:15:31] ever out love
[1:15:35] the Lord.
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:42] That kinsman, all of that that type and
[1:15:46] that word,
[1:15:48] it speaks of our lovely Lord Jesus. It
[1:15:51] speaks of the Holy Ghost.
[1:15:55] This is why Paul when he came to the
[1:15:57] upper coast of Ephesus and he says,
[1:15:59] "Have you have you received the Holy
[1:16:01] Ghost since
[1:16:04] you believed?"
[1:16:06] Because the Holy Spirit is the seal
[1:16:09] that God has recognized
[1:16:11] your faith.
[1:16:15] It's a seal. It's a circumcision. It's a
[1:16:17] covenant. It's life.
[1:16:21] It's that word living inside of us. So
[1:16:23] it's not just a
[1:16:26] Many times we hear that terminology of
[1:16:28] coming to Christ, but we understand it's
[1:16:30] coming and being one with him.
[1:16:35] The Holy Spirit taking a hold of our
[1:16:37] lives. God takes a hold like he took a
[1:16:39] hold of Ruth. A decision was made. Ruth
[1:16:43] labored in the fields.
[1:16:47] within the Holy Spirit dealing with Ruth
[1:16:51] to come into that place of uniting. And
[1:16:54] from the uniting
[1:16:57] leads to a full reward
[1:17:01] with all of our hearts, friends, this is
[1:17:04] we could know everything. We could hear
[1:17:06] everything we But without him
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; And without him having a hold of our
[1:17:12] life,
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; that's what that's what really matters.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. is that we have the token.
[1:17:17] We have that assurance. We have that
[1:17:19] life within us.
[1:17:22] And I say
[1:17:24] you don't have to plead with him.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; You don't have to beg him. You don't.
[1:17:32] Jesus said in Luke, he said, "If you ask
[1:17:35] your father for a loaf of bread or piece
[1:17:39] of bread, will he give you a stone?
[1:17:41] You ask him for a fish, is he going to
[1:17:44] give you something else? He said, "How
[1:17:46] much more they that ask for the Holy
[1:17:50] Ghost
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; will he not give it?"
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be asked for.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; It's seeing our need. And I'll just say
[1:18:03] it like this.
[1:18:05] Even as we walk with him, it's seeing
[1:18:08] our need for more of him.
[1:18:14] I want more
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; of the Holy Spirit
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; to take over more of Samuel Browning. I
[1:18:22] I need it.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; I want more.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; To take over more of me
[1:18:30] until eventually one of these days will
[1:18:32] be the final taking.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; And like Enoch, he'll take us away.
[1:18:39] But oh, what a
[1:18:42] what a promise not only that we have but
[1:18:43] we have right here with us.
[1:18:46] Hallelujah. Let that be the heart's
[1:18:49] prayer. Let it be our desire. Lord, I
[1:18:51] want to please you.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; I want to I want to follow you. He knows
[1:18:55] the time. He knows exactly right here.
[1:18:57] He knows exactly. We want to be found
[1:19:00] ready.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; This is the time.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Heavenly Father,
[1:19:09] Lord, many many requests, many needs as
[1:19:12] we have already made mention,
[1:19:15] many hearts, many lives. Lord,
[1:19:19] even one, every one of the prayer
[1:19:20] requests,
[1:19:22] Lord, in every heart that is gathered
[1:19:24] here, I pray, heavenly father, may Lord,
[1:19:27] as we would depart from the presence of
[1:19:29] one another, depart from the presence of
[1:19:32] this place, but God, may your presence
[1:19:35] go with us, Lord.
[1:19:38] bring us into that place, Lord. Bring us
[1:19:41] into a deeper
[1:19:44] walk with you.
[1:19:47] Lord, as we journey through this week,
[1:19:49] may that when we think of that scripture
[1:19:52] where Boaz
[1:19:54] saw the expression
[1:19:57] of the latter kindness
[1:19:59] that it was greater than what it was at
[1:20:02] the beginning,
[1:20:05] Lord,
[1:20:07] in our lives, Lord,
[1:20:09] may we just take just a few moments,
[1:20:13] Lord, just looking and saying, Lord,
[1:20:18] Where am I at presently, Lord?
[1:20:21] Lord, I realize I know that every one of
[1:20:23] us could no doubt say just like that
[1:20:26] that sister. May we may we have that joy
[1:20:28] like that to be able to say it where she
[1:20:30] could say,
[1:20:33] "I'm not what I ought to be.
[1:20:37] I'm not even what I want to be."
[1:20:40] But one thing I know, I'm not what I
[1:20:44] used to be.
[1:20:46] And like Paul could say, I'm pressing
[1:20:49] toward the mark of the high calling. I'm
[1:20:52] seeking to apprehend, lay hold,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; of what has laid hold of my life. Grant
[1:20:58] it, Lord.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; We love you, Lord Jesus. We appreciate
[1:21:02] you, Lord.
[1:21:04] Grant it, Lord, through this week, Lord.
[1:21:07] Oh, God.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father. Guide us, Lord, like
[1:21:12] you guided Eleazer. Lord, direct us. May
[1:21:15] your kindness guide us, lead us. Direct
[1:21:18] us, Lord. Decisions, what we have before
[1:21:21] us. Lord,
[1:21:23] guide us, Lord. Father, through this
[1:21:26] week, Lord, even in the midst of our
[1:21:28] shortcomings, the mercy that's reserved,
[1:21:30] Lord God. Oh God, we don't take that for
[1:21:33] granted, Lord.
[1:21:36] Grant it Lord Jesus.
[1:21:39] May your presence Lord
[1:21:42] go with each and every one of us Lord.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Grant it Lord
[1:21:49] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you church. Go in the
[1:21:55] fear of the Lord.
[1:21:57] [Music]

[1:22:03] just the way
[1:22:06] that wants me
[1:22:10] to.

[1:22:16] until there is

[1:23:06] no more. No more to give. I want you
[1:23:12] love.
[1:23:15] Love you.
[1:23:18] Just
[1:23:20] more love.
[1:23:22] Lord, I could never
[1:23:26] ever love.
[1:23:31] I want to live
[1:23:35] more love till there's just no moment

[1:24:15] I've been held in your hands.

[1:24:25] until I lay my head.

[1:25:22] In my darkest night,
[1:25:25] you were close like no other.
[1:25:31] I've known you as a father.
