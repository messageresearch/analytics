[28:58] by its Lord may you feel with your
[29:02] spirit Lord I'm through give ourselves
[29:05] to
[29:07] name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless
[29:12] you we want to invite you right into the
[29:14] word of the Lord into Romans chapter
[29:17] eight and I'm just gonna read just a few
[29:19] verses of Scripture to get started with
[29:22] your tonight and you want to say it just
[29:25] just a real privilege and an honor to be
[29:28] able to get together and certainly the
[29:32] enemy at first wanted to try to hinder
[29:34] that with the video but we appreciate
[29:36] you hanging on there and we just love
[29:40] you in the Lord and certainly miss each
[29:42] and every one of you but I'm thankful we
[29:45] can have these times together around the
[29:48] word of the Lord for he is our strength
[29:50] and this is where we find our
[29:54] expectation is in him so we want to look
[29:58] just at three verse of scripture here
[30:00] tonight in verse 26 of Romans 8
[30:03] it says likewise the spirit also helpeth
[30:07] our infirmities for we know not what we
[30:11] should pray for as we ought but the
[30:14] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[30:17] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[30:19] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[30:23] what is the mind of the Spirit because
[30:26] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[30:30] according to the will of God and we know
[30:33] that all things work together for good
[30:37] to them that love God to them who are
[30:41] called according to his purpose
[30:46] Amen may God bless you as you're being
[30:48] seated
[30:57] I just in looking at the scripture here
[31:00] of verse 28 but within the context of
[31:04] all of Romans 8 just thought really
[31:11] pulsating in my heart here for a few
[31:14] weeks and looking at this scripture just
[31:16] as the Lord just bring it to my
[31:18] attention and these are familiar
[31:19] scriptures that we all know up but you
[31:23] know it's in times where the Holy Spirit
[31:25] II have come and he well just quicken to
[31:28] us in those times as we have need of it
[31:31] and so we look at it in the scripture
[31:35] and I want to just take a little thought
[31:37] on all things work together for good and
[31:42] certainly not that all things are good
[31:45] that's not what the scripture is saying
[31:47] but it works together for our good so in
[31:53] every part of it when we look at it and
[31:56] many times I always look at this
[31:58] scripture and forgive me for my food
[32:02] parallels but I look at it in this way I
[32:05] like you know I love apple crisp but
[32:09] just to have a cup of oats is not Apple
[32:13] crisps neither is just to have a cup of
[32:16] brown sugar or just to have apples but
[32:20] all of those together when you put them
[32:22] together and then you put them under
[32:25] some heat then will come out a finished
[32:28] product but it takes all of the parts
[32:31] working together there's a lot of things
[32:34] that we experience have experienced in
[32:37] our life that we cannot say was good
[32:39] that can be even from drawing from the
[32:42] sense of our own decisions that we have
[32:44] made which were bad decisions but God
[32:47] through His mercy will work as we submit
[32:50] to him to bring forth and move and bring
[32:54] things back into his will and then there
[32:58] are things that even though here we
[33:00] would be in the perfect will of God
[33:02] but there are things that are not good
[33:04] but yet God will take circumstances and
[33:07] takes things and God will use it for his
[33:10] purpose and his glory and so the
[33:13] scriptures are clear here that it's not
[33:15] for everybody that all things work
[33:17] together for the good but the scripture
[33:20] is clear that it's to them that love God
[33:23] so it's to be sure that you love the
[33:26] Lord but the RAM would tell us he said
[33:29] many times people can even get into
[33:31] nervous breakdowns and other things he
[33:33] said because they try to study so much
[33:35] and try to figure out God he said when
[33:38] they aren't you come back to the first
[33:40] principle fall in love with him just
[33:42] yield yourself to him commit yourself to
[33:45] him and go to work everything out God
[33:48] has not entrusted it to you or I to try
[33:50] to work everything out or even to try to
[33:53] make sense of everything of even of all
[33:56] that we have available to us or before
[33:59] us and so everything works together for
[34:03] good to them that love God to them that
[34:07] are called according to his purpose so
[34:09] it is in in very important to have that
[34:13] solid that you love the Lord that the
[34:17] love of God is working in your heart and
[34:20] you when you have the love of God
[34:23] working in your heart and to know with
[34:26] that that God does not give his love or
[34:30] the Holy Spirit God does not give that
[34:34] to them who don't obey Him he gives it
[34:36] to those who do obey Him he gives it to
[34:39] those in whom he
[34:41] for knew who he saw remember the coming
[34:45] of the Holy Spirit is the outworking of
[34:47] redemption that was from the mind of God
[34:50] God already knew even in the conditions
[34:53] that you and I would be in even here
[34:55] tonight and even give you would be
[34:57] setting at home or maybe you're at work
[34:59] or somewhere and listening to the
[35:02] service God knew exactly where you would
[35:05] be and to think that this word that God
[35:08] is given for this night is not by chance
[35:10] it is directed and orchestrated under
[35:14] the very mind of Almighty God you and I
[35:18] are here upon this earth and we are
[35:21] merely the actors a part of a great play
[35:25] that has already been laid out before
[35:28] the foundation of the world we are here
[35:30] only to take and accept the cues from
[35:34] the Holy Spirit just like you know at
[35:36] one time I in a play
[35:39] I wasn't in the play I never liked being
[35:41] in front of people my mind's eye would
[35:43] forget my words so I didn't want to do
[35:45] that so I know God has a sense of humor
[35:48] but I I so I ran the lights I stayed
[35:51] over on the side and I had to look when
[35:52] someone so says this changed this light
[35:54] color and do this and do that and so all
[35:59] of those things I had I changing the
[36:01] lights had to notice cues as much as
[36:04] them as the actors that were coming on
[36:07] the stage they had to be alert to what
[36:10] was being said to know when it was time
[36:12] for them to step on so they were accused
[36:15] everybody was waiting upon cues to come
[36:18] forth to know when their part was to be
[36:21] acted out I'm glad that the one giving
[36:24] the cues is not that of a man but is God
[36:27] God has laid out made clear for you and
[36:30] I in this hour we would be looking at
[36:33] the script in this hour and wondering
[36:35] what's to take place in this hour we
[36:38] could be looking at the script and say I
[36:40] should we pray for America to have a
[36:42] revival but you see the Spirit of God
[36:44] through that of his promised word where
[36:47] he said had behold as send unto you
[36:50] elijah the prophet god notice he
[36:53] inspired
[36:54] that word it's called who gives the cue
[36:57] and here God sends a prophet with eyes
[37:00] that is able to declare the promises of
[37:03] this age to everyone else
[37:06] to many it means nothing to many it was
[37:09] just no more than a man that had a great
[37:11] healing ministry but remember the
[37:14] healing ministry was only the beginning
[37:16] there was a message that was to follow
[37:18] it because any ministry there's many
[37:21] that have healing ministry there are
[37:22] many miracles and things I think even of
[37:25] my dad witnessed you know taking place
[37:27] and things and we know that the bride
[37:29] let me just say to you like this the
[37:31] bride is not the only only place where
[37:33] there are miracles taking place where
[37:36] there's healings but I will say there
[37:38] here it is the only place in Christ
[37:41] Jesus
[37:41] where there is going to be a rapture and
[37:44] man God has sent a message to you and I
[37:47] to come out of the system and remember
[37:50] any healing that continues on healing
[37:53] campaign or whatever it is if it
[37:55] continues in the same old system it
[37:57] might be that of a blessing but you know
[37:59] that it's not God calling his people out
[38:02] so God has made known to you and had by
[38:06] His grace the script the program in this
[38:09] hour and leader said to you that without
[38:12] the Holy Ghost the message itself is no
[38:16] more than to a person and they're trying
[38:18] to look how does this fit with the
[38:19] scripture but remember when the Holy
[38:22] Spirit is come it reveals and unfolds
[38:26] the kingdom of God then your has become
[38:29] quickened to be able to see your day and
[38:31] it's message there then becomes an
[38:34] inspiration upon our lives for you and I
[38:37] to be able to recognize that we are a
[38:40] part of it and this is the program of
[38:44] God God is not here to further the
[38:47] programs our man the programs a man they
[38:50] always fail man can never stand in the
[38:53] prints of God with a man-made program
[38:56] but when it is the program of God and
[38:59] the program of God is none other than
[39:01] the Holy Ghost that is come through and
[39:05] by from the shed blood of the Lamb
[39:07] that is God's program you must be born
[39:11] again
[39:11] then the message becomes a living
[39:14] reality then it becomes a script to you
[39:17] and I it becomes part that we're waiting
[39:20] on the great one to give us the unction
[39:23] and the pulsation of the Holy Spirit
[39:25] this is why the Prophet would teach us
[39:27] and say pay attention to the pulsation
[39:31] of the spirit so we recognize that even
[39:37] in the midst of it - - look here in the
[39:39] scriptures here of how that all things
[39:42] are working together for the good we
[39:45] know that not everything is good we
[39:48] certainly cannot say where we are
[39:50] setting right now that this virus is
[39:52] good there is nothing good about this
[39:55] virus but yet in the midst of it through
[39:58] and by as God remember I want you to
[40:01] keep this in mind if I get to it today
[40:03] tonight or now but I want you to keep it
[40:05] in mind
[40:06] safe and has not pulled a fast one on
[40:08] God at any time remember Satan can only
[40:12] move and work as God permits and
[40:15] remember the question could always it's
[40:18] a question that you know I've had people
[40:21] ask and not people outside it but I've
[40:23] had people you know at times over the
[40:25] years you get around in a conversation
[40:27] and said well why couldn't God have
[40:29] bypassed all of this but remember inside
[40:31] of God were attributes to be expressed
[40:34] you could not have bypassed courting
[40:37] engagement and marriage if you did you
[40:39] did it wrong you can't bypass that and
[40:41] then expect to have children it is all
[40:44] to come through the right the right
[40:46] channels the right pathway and then the
[40:49] attribute that already lays within you
[40:51] when everything comes in its right
[40:53] bedding ground it will actually come
[40:55] forth so we recognize these attributes
[40:58] that God had within him of Savior
[41:00] Redeemer of Shepherd of deliver all a
[41:03] provider every one of these attributes
[41:06] remember there was to be released or to
[41:09] be expressed
[41:10] God did me to tell you this Todd don't
[41:12] want to just tell you about it he wants
[41:14] to express it
[41:15] you don't want to G don't want you and I
[41:17] just to know I'm sure I'm a savior he
[41:20] wants you to know by divine expression
[41:23] in your life I'm a savior to where you
[41:26] have that experience of that Express
[41:29] attribute in your life to say no he's my
[41:33] Savior I once was lost but now I'm found
[41:37] God delights in expressing his
[41:40] attributes but remember from the
[41:42] beginning we see where the fall had
[41:45] taken place Satan come in and through
[41:48] deceit he deceived that of the woman
[41:51] here is Adam standing there and Adam
[41:54] remember the Bible says in the book of
[41:56] Timothy that the man was not deceived
[41:59] but the woman remember the woman was
[42:01] deceived you see it speaks even woman
[42:04] speaks of the church there has to be the
[42:08] man come because it's the man who is the
[42:10] life carrier the man who's the life
[42:13] carrier the seat carrier the name
[42:15] carrier it must be the man part come
[42:18] because he's the one that imparts the
[42:21] life under the church that the church
[42:23] might be a reflection of his own life
[42:26] and he can say she is bone of my bone
[42:29] flesh of my flesh she is me
[42:32] it requires the man part so within it do
[42:36] we find her Adam's step forward in order
[42:39] to redeem to take to take that upon
[42:43] himself but yet God had made provision
[42:46] and said I will make a way back but God
[42:49] even though this had taken place God
[42:52] never had to stop and rethink and say oh
[42:56] my what am I going to do when he asked
[42:59] him what have you done it is not God
[43:02] trying to figure out the situation
[43:04] caught already he already had knowledge
[43:08] of all of this now it's a time for the
[43:11] expression of the attributes that were
[43:13] already laying within him the only thing
[43:17] that the fall did was begin to release
[43:20] the further unfolding of those
[43:23] attributes right there to his children
[43:26] so when we think of it God foreknew the
[43:30] church gone already he already saw the
[43:34] church he foreknew the plan everything
[43:37] was set in order when you and I we have
[43:39] the scriptures but to recognize that the
[43:42] scriptures themselves the Bible tells us
[43:44] that holy men of God spake as they were
[43:48] moved upon by the Holy Spirit we
[43:51] recognize that this of the what we call
[43:54] of the what we have and we declare this
[43:56] is the Bible the holy script is to
[43:59] recognize as Paul would tell Timothy all
[44:02] Scripture is inspired and we recognize
[44:07] that it's the inspiration of God that
[44:10] has come down and God has expressed it
[44:13] where men have been moved by the Spirit
[44:16] of God to pick up their pin and the
[44:19] assembling of this and this is God's
[44:21] mind to be declared and unfolded even to
[44:25] where when the Lord Jesus come the Lord
[44:28] Jesus his mind was not in a place of or
[44:31] what do I do next time oh this
[44:33] prophecies here and oh of the prophet
[44:35] Isaiah said this and the prophet
[44:37] Jeremiah said this and Oh what should I
[44:39] do
[44:39] let me put this together let me put this
[44:41] together oh is this the time should I
[44:43] feel it well I don't know no you know
[44:45] what the Lord Jesus exemplified or
[44:47] showed what a real believer and let me
[44:50] say it clearly he showed what the bride
[44:53] would be at the end time where to have
[44:57] the unfolding of the mysteries of God to
[45:00] have that of the mysteries that which
[45:02] had been sealed up where had been lost
[45:04] but now the loose ends tied together and
[45:07] for the church to be alerted to the
[45:09] oncoming judgment
[45:11] he never entrusted it or left it that we
[45:14] would have to figure it out although we
[45:17] have this quote we have this statement
[45:18] we have this statement tying in with the
[45:20] scriptures but we have the rest and the
[45:23] peace of the Holy Ghost to know he's the
[45:26] one that brought this message together
[45:28] and he's the one that's overseeing the
[45:31] work he is Jehovah Jireh it is him that
[45:34] is supply
[45:35] oh that you and I have meet up when we
[45:38] have need of it for the change of our
[45:40] bodies it'll be there so it's had in
[45:45] mind this is why then you know we're
[45:48] brother Ram could say he's working all
[45:50] things together for the good to them
[45:53] that love him how can you lose you can't
[45:59] lose he said there's no way of losing
[46:03] and he said if the church can just find
[46:06] that place in Christ to recognize he
[46:12] said every child that comes to God
[46:14] there's temptations he said their
[46:16] shadows their spheres but just don't get
[46:19] all tore up about it and he deals with
[46:22] we know that when troubles come I think
[46:26] sometimes we're all too good at this and
[46:29] we should examine but you know there
[46:32] comes a place through the examination in
[46:35] our life there are times that God will
[46:38] people will permit sickness to bring
[46:41] correction to our lives
[46:43] and there are times he does that but
[46:46] there's other times sickness comes and
[46:48] it has nothing to do with correction and
[46:50] so it's us trying to either find out but
[46:53] to understand this here the reason that
[46:56] I believe we can look at this even here
[46:58] tonight I'm talking about solid ground
[47:00] I'm talking of these things here in the
[47:02] scriptures this is ground that we need
[47:05] to be standing on when you're facing
[47:07] these situations and whatever else would
[47:10] come our way we need to have a solemn
[47:13] rest and ground that we are standing on
[47:16] in the Lord to know that we are not
[47:19] losers we are winners we cannot lose in
[47:23] Christ so to recognize that sometimes
[47:27] God will allow sickness or other things
[47:31] to come our way and he does that in
[47:33] order sometimes when it's not for
[47:35] correction sometimes the sickness will
[47:37] come our way God permits it I want you
[47:40] understand it did not happen by chance
[47:42] be even the me just felt like this the
[47:45] coronavirus was not because he was
[47:47] sleeping he said he never
[47:48] slumbers nor sleeps it wasn't because
[47:52] God mr. memo come on somebody god knew
[47:55] about that these are reminders this is
[48:00] not our home that is the result from the
[48:06] fall in the beginning it became a
[48:09] pothole for a sickness disease all unbe
[48:14] everything to enter in but thanks be to
[48:17] God when you and I were without a way to
[48:21] get out of this God came down there was
[48:23] a space between us and God in that loop
[48:27] we would call eternity but yet there was
[48:30] a space within it brother Raman call it
[48:32] like a little Hickey that was in there
[48:34] it was kind of laying down in there but
[48:36] here when God came down and became one
[48:39] of us it was through the man Christ
[48:41] Jesus of whom we had no other mediator
[48:44] but him and through him by the
[48:47] all-sufficient sacrificial death and
[48:49] sending back the Holy Ghost brother what
[48:53] took place in his life were God and man
[48:55] met together heavens and earth hugged
[48:58] and kissed that's the same thing when
[49:00] the Holy Ghost comes upon our life it's
[49:03] that which ties us back in to that rest
[49:07] of God to know there is nothing that
[49:11] cannot lose I am a winner this is our
[49:17] anchor now notice Romans 8:29 let's go a
[49:25] little bit further for whom he did
[49:28] foreknow he also did predestinate to be
[49:35] conformed to the image of his son that
[49:38] he might be the firstborn among many
[49:40] brethren
[49:45] hallelujah all glory you know we
[49:50] recognize I know these words aren't
[49:51] maybe the most there's some that have
[49:54] problems with these words but I didn't
[49:55] write this but it ain't about they no
[49:59] problem with writing this this is
[50:01] dealing with that God is not running a
[50:03] haphazard program
[50:05] he has come for a purpose the Bible
[50:09] opens up in the book I believe it's in
[50:11] the Book of Luke he all the way through
[50:13] the scripture but just to take this
[50:15] place he had come to save his people
[50:18] from their sin there was his mind
[50:23] remember his covenant he was there is
[50:25] here for a purpose as he was here for
[50:29] redemption and to redeem means to bring
[50:32] back what rightfully belongs to you you
[50:37] see the struggle oh let me preach it the
[50:40] struggle is not with God
[50:42] the struggle is upon us but God through
[50:46] and by the sending forth of his light of
[50:49] his word but clouds of badness that can
[50:52] clutter the thinking from recognizing
[50:54] who you are the amnesia that can go
[50:57] through your life were you wondering am
[50:59] i a part of this I hear about this or
[51:02] the message I've been raised in it or
[51:04] what have you go how am I am I a part of
[51:06] this but you see Y all you have to do is
[51:09] get in his presence and his presence
[51:12] begins to deal with your life
[51:15] what's he doing he's coming to remove
[51:17] the spiritual amnesia
[51:19] that's upon your life that you might
[51:21] remember what remember and recognize who
[51:25] you are and that you are always a son
[51:28] and daughter of God you are always in
[51:31] God's mind what's taking place the
[51:34] inspiration is telling upon that life
[51:37] and God remember that many times I
[51:41] understand many people make an ugly
[51:44] thing out of predestination God don't
[51:46] the scriptures don't the message don't
[51:49] people do they want to put it as though
[51:52] they don't have to do nothing and God's
[51:54] all of a sudden gonna pull
[51:56] - do and God will do this what it says
[51:59] this right here it's just this simple if
[52:03] there's something in your life and you
[52:05] are a part of the program of God then
[52:08] the coming of the Holy Spirit it'll draw
[52:11] you you cannot remain in sin and
[52:15] unbelief rather how could you take a
[52:19] magnet through this building tonight and
[52:21] if there are things that are that are
[52:23] material that is made to come together
[52:26] with that magnet how could you pass that
[52:30] magnet through this building and those
[52:32] pieces not come together unless they're
[52:36] bolted down let me tell you if you're
[52:38] bolted down there's one here tonight
[52:41] that can make known the release to your
[52:44] life Alleluia is not a pass for
[52:51] knowledge and predestination ties in to
[52:53] the new birth it becomes our life our
[52:57] life becomes a reflection of his
[53:00] choosing Oh glory that he might be
[53:03] though we might be what conformed to the
[53:06] image of his dear son
[53:07] what is that it's restoring back to
[53:09] falling image that holy image of God
[53:12] that left him there in the beginning now
[53:14] through the Holy Spirit remember it
[53:17] comes back to quicken that seed that
[53:19] life it raises up the image of the Son
[53:22] of God this is why Paul would say in
[53:24] Galatians 1 when it pleased him who
[53:26] separated me from my mother's womb when
[53:28] he chose to reveal his son in me you see
[53:33] it is not a different life jesus said
[53:35] the works that I do shall you do also
[53:38] you can't put the life of Christ inside
[53:41] of a person and didn't they live lonely
[53:44] that's not the life of Christ but when
[53:46] the life of Christ comes on the inside
[53:48] I'm talking about deeper than the flesh
[53:50] deeper than the spirit I'm talking about
[53:53] a real word birth brother down on the
[53:56] inside that changes that old nature it
[53:59] makes a new creature in Christ Jesus out
[54:02] of you then we're getting to the image
[54:06] of God
[54:08] so here the scripture goes on to say
[54:11] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[54:14] he also called whom he called them he
[54:17] also justified and whom he justified
[54:19] them he also glorified
[54:22] you see these scriptures it's declaring
[54:27] to you and I as the Prophet would take
[54:29] the scripture and he said in God's mind
[54:32] it's a finished work he said in God's
[54:36] mind you're already a finished product
[54:38] I'm named the Bible tells us revelation
[54:42] 13:8
[54:43] her name was wrote in the Lamb's Book of
[54:45] Life before the foundation of the world
[54:47] is that right it's God's spoken word
[54:51] it's his thinking and so what is taking
[54:54] place here remember whatever his
[54:57] thoughts are remember words our thoughts
[55:00] Express so God has expressed his word
[55:04] and remember he's not a man that he
[55:06] should lie neither the son of man that
[55:09] he should repent I don't care how bleak
[55:11] how dark remember what God said in the
[55:15] beginning he's never had another word he
[55:19] is not gonna take back anyway but he has
[55:22] come to fulfill his word Oh glory be to
[55:27] God after the fall he didn't start
[55:29] speaking new words this was the
[55:32] unfolding of the word of who he is of
[55:35] what he expressed as the Bible takes us
[55:37] there in John 1 he is unfolding his
[55:40] thoughts and this is why but brother
[55:43] Branham would tell us he said this is
[55:45] God's seed materializing it's his word
[55:49] coming down so to think that within this
[55:53] this is why we must have the light of
[55:55] God to flash across our pathway it
[55:58] illuminates our life it begins to
[56:00] illuminate you know you take you in a
[56:02] room of darkness you take where there's
[56:03] darkness surrounds your life and what
[56:05] happens when somebody has a little bit
[56:07] of light you say hey turn that back on
[56:09] you see you mean that light because the
[56:12] light itself in May gives you a little
[56:15] glimmer you recognize not only of all
[56:17] your surroundings but you begin to
[56:19] recognize and realize the darkness and
[56:22] just how dark the dark is when when that
[56:24] light is flashed that light has flashed
[56:27] for that to catch the attention of those
[56:31] whom he foreknew are you with me so this
[56:38] is just say it very clearly we are a
[56:43] finished work in the presence of God but
[56:48] God brings that reflection down into
[56:51] earth God already sees us alright he
[56:57] already glorified but he met but he must
[57:00] bring that reflection of what he has
[57:03] known what he has already declared and
[57:06] seen before there were atoms Stardust or
[57:08] molecule he must bring it down in to be
[57:12] reflected in this earth
[57:13] you see character is molded as all
[57:18] things work together they work together
[57:22] to them that love God to them that are
[57:25] called according to his purpose our
[57:26] character is being molded and God brings
[57:31] every word to pass so we are a part in
[57:37] that word then God must bring every word
[57:39] to pass I want you to think of this for
[57:41] a moment
[57:42] there were many prophecies that were
[57:46] laid out in the time of the coming of
[57:49] the Messiah many prophecies that were
[57:52] laid out and you had that there was an
[57:57] elect
[57:58] group down through the ages that they
[58:02] were offering the lamb with a revelation
[58:07] they couldn't explain everything but
[58:10] there was a real let me just say it like
[58:13] this it wasn't just something that they
[58:15] were doing it was more than them just
[58:18] being good people thank God for good
[58:20] people but it was something more than
[58:22] that their life was so taken by the
[58:27] revelation of
[58:28] that it unfolded in their lives to where
[58:31] you read from Abraham's life Reno's life
[58:34] on and on to where when that revelation
[58:37] came to them what you see is that became
[58:42] their life it gave them life in the
[58:45] midst of the condition and their whole
[58:48] life revolved around that that
[58:50] revelation of Christ in that generation
[58:54] became the center of all things to them
[58:58] and all of their life revolved around it
[59:00] and so notice all of his words has to
[59:04] come to pass all of the words what we're
[59:06] reading here what God has already saw
[59:09] concerning you and I it has to come to
[59:12] pass in the plant think of this now even
[59:15] in the part where you and I are to act
[59:18] out and to play out even here in the end
[59:20] time there were people who were were
[59:23] there think of this now there were
[59:25] people there that remember there had
[59:28] been they had been looking for the first
[59:30] coming out they have been looking for
[59:32] the coming of the Lord the coming of the
[59:34] Messiah and they knew with that they had
[59:36] the promise of Joel to write the
[59:39] outpouring of the Holy Ghost they were
[59:41] looking for that and notice when the
[59:45] disciples even after the crucifixion
[59:47] they themselves did not a firmly catch
[59:51] what was going on even when they were
[59:53] looking at John the Baptist they said
[59:55] why did the scribes and Pharisees say
[59:57] that Elias must come first
[1:00:00] you see they knew about John they had
[1:00:04] been around John's ministry but they
[1:00:06] didn't recognize who John was but you
[1:00:08] notice the scribes and Pharisees they
[1:00:11] themselves they knew that same scripture
[1:00:15] but it was not inspired to them because
[1:00:19] they could walk right up to John and
[1:00:21] asked who he was he said I'm the voice
[1:00:24] of one crying in the wilderness he
[1:00:25] identified himself prepare you the way
[1:00:28] of the Lord from Isaiah into that of
[1:00:30] Malachi and even when he identified the
[1:00:33] word that has been quickened to his life
[1:00:35] they could not receive it but when Jesus
[1:00:40] took that
[1:00:41] moment and it was unfolded it was not
[1:00:43] flesh and blood unfolding it it was the
[1:00:46] inspiration of the Holy Spirit that was
[1:00:49] given as Jesus said it is given to you
[1:00:52] to know the mysteries of the kingdom it
[1:00:55] unfolded to them the time that they were
[1:00:58] living in did they understand all the
[1:01:01] other parts they did not
[1:01:05] but when it came time for them to be in
[1:01:08] a position the Holy Spirit which we know
[1:01:13] this is not the third person of God hey
[1:01:17] man it's the same Jesus amen the same
[1:01:21] God revealed is that right all the way
[1:01:26] down and to know that he brought
[1:01:29] everything together when they were
[1:01:31] walking on the road to Emmaus and said
[1:01:33] how we thought he was the one we found
[1:01:35] you know he should have been the
[1:01:36] Redeemer and and this and that and you
[1:01:38] see they at that time the scriptures
[1:01:41] were not tied together for them that's
[1:01:44] why they were still wandering around sad
[1:01:46] hearted and down but when he came
[1:01:48] according to his promise you see before
[1:01:51] those scriptures could be unfolded that
[1:01:53] Fairs had to be a fulfilling of the
[1:01:55] scriptures of the Resurrection and once
[1:01:58] those scriptures were fulfilled then he
[1:02:01] could unlock the mystery that they
[1:02:03] themselves were in darkness amnesia was
[1:02:06] about their life he could unlock the
[1:02:08] scriptures and when he unlocked the
[1:02:10] scriptures it gave direction for their
[1:02:13] life it gave leadership they were no
[1:02:16] longer Peter was no longer just let's go
[1:02:18] fishing it was no longer let's go away
[1:02:21] from Jerusalem once the scriptures were
[1:02:23] unlocked they made their way back to
[1:02:26] Jerusalem why because it was promised
[1:02:29] there at Jerusalem that he would pour
[1:02:31] out his spirit and as they were there
[1:02:34] waiting on the spirit to come amen
[1:02:38] according to the Word of God everything
[1:02:40] was being fulfilled in its time even for
[1:02:43] them in their journey it was a Sabbath
[1:02:46] day's journey to get back they couldn't
[1:02:50] get there too early could not get there
[1:02:51] too late
[1:02:52] everything God had laid it out even in
[1:02:55] the fulfillment of the feast that take
[1:02:58] place the the Feast of the Messiah the
[1:03:02] feasts that are was in Israel the Feast
[1:03:04] of the Lord
[1:03:05] remember they each had their chosen and
[1:03:07] appointed times it was not up to man to
[1:03:10] get himself in position it was God who
[1:03:13] would move upon the heart of the
[1:03:15] individual and the in
[1:03:16] vidual would submit and you and come
[1:03:19] into position when God comes to fulfill
[1:03:21] his word we cannot fulfill it but let us
[1:03:24] get in the place by the unction of the
[1:03:27] Holy Ghost
[1:03:28] that God can come and fulfill his word
[1:03:31] well glory be to God now to think he was
[1:03:36] the promised Jesus told him in Matthew
[1:03:38] 24 he told him there in Matthew 24 picks
[1:03:41] it up in Luke picks it up there you know
[1:03:44] and let them know about the oncoming
[1:03:46] destruction what's going to hit in
[1:03:48] Jerusalem pray that your flight be not
[1:03:50] in the winter they're alerted to this
[1:03:54] that doesn't take place to 70 AD come on
[1:03:57] now
[1:03:58] that's that's already well into the
[1:04:00] first church age the first church age
[1:04:02] didn't start till 33 AD are you with me
[1:04:06] now there's been a lot of things that
[1:04:08] have even happened like we preached on a
[1:04:09] few weeks ago the famine struck Indra in
[1:04:12] Judea and Jerusalem in that time before
[1:04:15] that encompass 'men of type Titus and
[1:04:18] the besiegement but remember before
[1:04:21] Titus could take Jerusalem there had to
[1:04:24] come forth the sealing angel and to seal
[1:04:26] according to Ezekiel 9 he had to seal
[1:04:29] those of God's chosen who themselves
[1:04:33] we're walking and waiting and looking to
[1:04:37] the Lord a separated life from the rest
[1:04:40] of the world
[1:04:41] you see God moves them into that place I
[1:04:45] know this is very simple but I believe
[1:04:48] if we can understand this in this is all
[1:04:51] in continuity the inspiration it strikes
[1:04:54] my heart with these scriptures of Romans
[1:04:56] 8 you say what does that be inspiration
[1:04:58] is this is the rest of God it is not you
[1:05:02] and I trying to get in position or
[1:05:04] trying to put ourselves in position or
[1:05:07] as brother Branham would tell us don't
[1:05:08] make yourself odd
[1:05:11] now we've seen enough of that over the
[1:05:14] years they don't need to make ourselves
[1:05:15] odd just be a simple believer that is
[1:05:19] available to God and waiting on the
[1:05:22] unction of the Holy Spirit just as much
[1:05:24] as the Prophet could say in his time he
[1:05:26] said there been people putting charts
[1:05:28] together here and charts together
[1:05:30] and charge together there I'm not
[1:05:32] against charts but don't let your faith
[1:05:34] be anchored in a chart
[1:05:35] you let your faith rest in the
[1:05:38] workmanship of the Holy Spirit because
[1:05:41] remember it is the quickening power of
[1:05:44] God that alerts us andin quickens us to
[1:05:47] the word in our season what brings every
[1:05:52] word to pass you know you know listen
[1:05:55] let make this dramatized a little bit I
[1:05:57] wonder if there are times where there
[1:05:59] wasn't different things that they could
[1:06:00] see and they would say ah you know you
[1:06:03] know Jesus spoke of this you know Daniel
[1:06:06] had spoke of these things and they're
[1:06:08] looking you know as believers you're
[1:06:10] looking because why as believers they
[1:06:12] have a comfort in knowing God has spoken
[1:06:16] through this is that right Jesus when
[1:06:18] Peter was speaking there before all the
[1:06:20] Pharisees and Sadducees he said I spoke
[1:06:23] of Jesus of Nazareth a man whom was
[1:06:27] confirmed with signs and wonders
[1:06:29] following which God did through him is
[1:06:32] that right it was a confirmation of the
[1:06:35] word that God had given in that hour but
[1:06:38] to recognize that even when things would
[1:06:40] take place it was not up to the
[1:06:42] believers to try to say oh let me see
[1:06:45] this I wonder if this is what Jesus was
[1:06:47] saying right here it could have been
[1:06:49] they looked when maybe they see you know
[1:06:51] an army or different ones but you see
[1:06:53] there was the Holy Spirit you see this
[1:06:56] is why the church is not under the
[1:06:58] leadership of a man the church is under
[1:07:01] the leadership of the Holy Spirit is to
[1:07:03] stay in tune with him this is why God
[1:07:08] did not pick it her back in a way to say
[1:07:10] or go ask your pastor if you can listen
[1:07:12] to this go ask your pastor if you can
[1:07:14] sing this glass your pastor if you can
[1:07:16] do this God did not make the pastor to
[1:07:18] be the Holy Ghost of the Assembly in the
[1:07:20] Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost God has
[1:07:23] sent forth the Holy Ghost that he might
[1:07:26] reside in the hearts of his people and
[1:07:29] that is a real absolute in the heart a
[1:07:33] real thinking man's filter
[1:07:38] back to my point bring in his word to
[1:07:42] pass you see we are part of that world
[1:07:46] that was spoke we're part of this in
[1:07:49] time word we have a responsibility the
[1:07:54] ending of Hebrews 11 they without us
[1:07:57] should not be made perfect
[1:07:59] there is a completion there is a
[1:08:02] fulfillment that is to come forth out of
[1:08:06] this lady will see an aged word God will
[1:08:09] bring forth a bride that stands as an
[1:08:12] overcomer he made a promise in this age
[1:08:14] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:08:18] sit with me in my throne even as I
[1:08:21] overcame and him set down in my father's
[1:08:24] room you see it's not us trying to make
[1:08:29] things happen most of you you know me
[1:08:39] you know me before I was pastor but you
[1:08:42] know me after I've been pastor you even
[1:08:44] know might you many of you know my ways
[1:08:46] you know my approach how many things
[1:08:48] that you've you've been under the
[1:08:49] ministry and you also know even the
[1:08:51] character of how I approach certain
[1:08:53] things and I never I get where I get
[1:08:56] leery is when people start trying to put
[1:08:58] things together that's where I get leery
[1:09:01] when people start trying to put things
[1:09:04] together and match this together you say
[1:09:06] brother Samuel why are you saying that
[1:09:08] because one thing about it this is what
[1:09:10] I've always found
[1:09:11] I've never preached a message that I had
[1:09:14] to put together
[1:09:18] I've never had to do that but I can
[1:09:21] preach a message that he brings together
[1:09:23] a lot of the things he'll bring together
[1:09:25] at first when they're bringing it
[1:09:27] sometimes it'll take me a day or so or
[1:09:29] whatever more because sometimes the way
[1:09:31] it comes I can't even see how it's
[1:09:33] coming together
[1:09:34] nor how does this plan together what's
[1:09:36] the fluidity of the thought how does
[1:09:37] this come together sometimes I can't
[1:09:39] even understand that it's not just me
[1:09:41] it's every minister you'll get a thought
[1:09:43] here you grabbed at fault here and you
[1:09:45] think well well maybe this is for
[1:09:46] another time maybe this for another time
[1:09:47] and so you just leave it yet you're
[1:09:49] feeling the inspiration for these
[1:09:51] thoughts right now and yet it seems like
[1:09:53] well that there ain't nothing else that
[1:09:54] I'd have to say except read that
[1:09:56] scripture and say blessed be the name of
[1:09:58] the Lord let's stand and pray and you
[1:10:00] feel like Lord but there's something in
[1:10:02] it that God is wanting to unfold or
[1:10:04] unpack leadership for our lives at this
[1:10:07] moment and when all of a sudden the Lord
[1:10:09] begins to bring that together sometimes
[1:10:11] he don't even do it before I'm standing
[1:10:13] up here sometimes they don't come all
[1:10:14] together til I'm standing right here but
[1:10:17] that's the way he does it now maybe for
[1:10:18] you you wouldn't know know about that
[1:10:20] but you know what God does that for who
[1:10:22] for me he wants to teach me sometimes
[1:10:24] that hey I want you to rely completely
[1:10:26] on me and so I thank God for it even
[1:10:30] though I'm a nervous wreck in the middle
[1:10:31] of it but you notice he brings every
[1:10:35] word to pass man I'm trying to go on
[1:10:36] here he brings every word to pass think
[1:10:40] of this here it is time where there's
[1:10:42] already been a lot of things going on
[1:10:44] with Mary and Joseph remember what has
[1:10:47] taken place
[1:10:48] Joseph is questioning Mary he's
[1:10:52] questioning what has taken place he
[1:10:55] annoying it Joseph is such a man where
[1:10:57] we could preach a whole service on
[1:10:59] Joseph Joseph Joseph is such a man the
[1:11:01] Bible would call him an honorable man
[1:11:03] why was he an honorable man because he
[1:11:06] didn't go around and run among people
[1:11:07] and say I don't know what I'm praying
[1:11:09] about I I just want you to know that
[1:11:10] this right here you know Mary Mary said
[1:11:12] since she's expecting and you know I
[1:11:14] don't know but would you help me pray
[1:11:16] about this woman he was an honorable man
[1:11:18] he did not disclose those things that
[1:11:22] would have hindered or would have called
[1:11:24] others to look down on Mary preach
[1:11:27] brother Samuel thank you out there he
[1:11:29] did not do that
[1:11:30] he was an honorable man brother Bram
[1:11:32] would say like this he became her shield
[1:11:34] are you with me
[1:11:36] you see this is where we are one
[1:11:38] another's keeper hey men its we're home
[1:11:43] I let me go on let me preach so here all
[1:11:45] of this has taken place
[1:11:47] and notice all of this a word you would
[1:11:52] think God fulfilling a word and God
[1:11:55] would entrust it to this when there's no
[1:11:58] prophet on the scene God would entrust
[1:12:01] to a dream he gives Joseph a dream
[1:12:04] danger the Lord visits him in a dream
[1:12:07] but you see this is where it comes to be
[1:12:10] sensitive to the word of the Lord and to
[1:12:12] recognize that his he gave him the dream
[1:12:14] we would look at this and say there's
[1:12:16] nothing smooth about this at all Mary's
[1:12:19] life looks like it's in jeopardy
[1:12:21] what's gonna come but you see it's not
[1:12:24] in jeopardy this is in God's control
[1:12:29] what looks like were you I would have a
[1:12:32] nail-biter if we got him left we would
[1:12:34] be sitting there oh my goodness what's
[1:12:36] gonna take place
[1:12:37] but God is working everything out
[1:12:39] according to his program even to where
[1:12:42] in that time there would be an economic
[1:12:45] move that would take place it would not
[1:12:49] be a stimulus package but taxation would
[1:12:53] rise there would be gone out through the
[1:12:55] land
[1:12:56] there's taxes that need to come do you
[1:12:58] need to report back to your home
[1:13:01] birthplace now to thank God would take
[1:13:04] the instrument of taxation something
[1:13:07] like this but yet we're there looking at
[1:13:10] it even Joseph and Mary Joseph now
[1:13:13] walking along and saying hey Mary you
[1:13:16] know what I know exactly what's going on
[1:13:18] let me tell you what's going on Mary let
[1:13:20] me just tell you like this you know over
[1:13:21] there in the Book of Jeremiah you know
[1:13:23] it speaks about being born in Bethlehem
[1:13:25] he wasn't talking about that because he
[1:13:28] didn't know it come on now but he knew
[1:13:33] the word he knew the god of the word but
[1:13:37] what was it would you rather have known
[1:13:39] when I know it
[1:13:40] Noora my said here I know what Jeremiah
[1:13:43] said that listen the scribes and
[1:13:44] Pharisees knew what Jeremiah said they
[1:13:47] even knew where the Messiah was to be
[1:13:50] born when Herod sent word and said bring
[1:13:53] me word that I might worship Him
[1:13:56] remember his counsel said it's in
[1:13:59] Bethlehem but did it do him any good
[1:14:01] although they knew where was that
[1:14:04] scripturally it did not but God was
[1:14:08] fulfilling his word in the midst of it
[1:14:12] and his fulfilment of his word he
[1:14:15] fulfills his word and proves it through
[1:14:18] believers who believe and can be moved
[1:14:22] by the unction of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:26] remember this is a walk of faith
[1:14:33] Joseph wasn't putting everything
[1:14:35] together but there's one thing about it
[1:14:41] Joseph had to know this was supernatural
[1:14:44] he knew what was taking place as far as
[1:14:47] within Marik this was supernatural but
[1:14:49] you see God was moving to get him in
[1:14:51] position because the promise had to be
[1:14:54] fulfilled matter of fact I love how I
[1:14:56] would say it in the word in different
[1:14:58] places there in the book of Matthew that
[1:15:01] it might be fulfilled it would go on to
[1:15:04] say that when it came time for them to
[1:15:07] leave out of Bethlehem remember here's
[1:15:10] the Holy Spirit the protection told told
[1:15:12] Joseph he said get out get a get out of
[1:15:15] here for Herod is going to send the
[1:15:16] troops dad to come into with the
[1:15:19] slaughter get down to Egypt take the
[1:15:20] mother in the child and get down to
[1:15:22] Egypt and he says wait there till I tell
[1:15:25] you wait there until I send you where
[1:15:29] you see all we can do and we wait on the
[1:15:32] leg and we wait until the next word
[1:15:34] comes from God
[1:15:35] we're found waiting in position until
[1:15:38] the next word comes think of it Joseph
[1:15:41] never in his mind neither Mary asked him
[1:15:43] a year ago ask him a year ago or a year
[1:15:46] and a half
[1:15:46] ask him years ago hey did you guys
[1:15:48] expect to be down in Egypt no ask us did
[1:15:51] you expect this to take place this
[1:15:54] quarantine no we didn't expect and see
[1:15:57] these things like this but you see
[1:15:59] within it all even though this was
[1:16:01] hardship Mary was great the Bible says
[1:16:04] great with child she was ready to be
[1:16:08] delivered it was not the time to be
[1:16:10] making this kind of a trip this was very
[1:16:13] troublesome but God was arranging all
[1:16:16] the pieces and getting things together
[1:16:20] let me just tell you this is not the
[1:16:23] only piece to the puzzle coronavirus is
[1:16:26] not the only piece to the puzzle
[1:16:30] it's another piece how many more pieces
[1:16:34] I don't know but I can tell you this
[1:16:37] right here I know as I told the family
[1:16:39] last night I said I can remember from
[1:16:41] the early years of me growing up and
[1:16:43] there would be things that would take
[1:16:45] place I said I can remember I said dad
[1:16:48] would stand up the inspiration would
[1:16:50] strike and it would reach out and I said
[1:16:52] and it would declare these are things
[1:16:54] that the Prophet it spoke about like you
[1:16:56] remember one thing you remember very
[1:16:58] clearly of East and West Germany
[1:17:00] remember a lot of there was a lot of
[1:17:02] discussion about Russia and everything
[1:17:04] else but then when that took place
[1:17:05] remember the inspiration would strike
[1:17:08] the hearts of the ministry in that hour
[1:17:10] I think of what was that 88 87 I don't
[1:17:12] know somewhere around in there when that
[1:17:14] happened and it would strike their heart
[1:17:15] to come back to in time seats high where
[1:17:18] the Holy Spirit had identified that the
[1:17:21] borders of the old Roman Empire will be
[1:17:24] restored that old Roman Empire must be
[1:17:27] revived and see the Holy Spirit had
[1:17:30] already spoken it through the mouth of
[1:17:32] the Prophet but now the same one who
[1:17:34] spoken was there to quicken it to that
[1:17:37] of the ministry that was on earth
[1:17:39] following that saith the Lord and it
[1:17:42] alerted to the people of the time that
[1:17:44] we're in but you see the danger
[1:17:48] sometimes with this is that it alerts
[1:17:51] and people can become very and then
[1:17:54] after time and just started waning off
[1:17:57] again the things will be come again but
[1:18:01] let me just tell you something the
[1:18:03] rapture is not going to be a pick-me-up
[1:18:08] the rapture is a sudden secret going
[1:18:12] away of those who are waiting with full
[1:18:17] anticipation their lives are waiting on
[1:18:22] the fulfillment of that as brother
[1:18:25] Branham if I can say it this clearly he
[1:18:28] said the bride in the message rapture
[1:18:30] will be waiting on that revelation you
[1:18:35] say brother Samuel that revelation has
[1:18:37] already come yes and no the revelation
[1:18:40] has already unfolded
[1:18:42] for that on the coming of the Lord and
[1:18:44] the rapture but remember within the
[1:18:46] unfolding of that it is the quickening
[1:18:49] power that is released upon the Church
[1:18:52] of the Living God to make her ready for
[1:18:55] the coming of the Lord
[1:18:56] it'll be as the Prophet would say the
[1:18:59] final quickening unto the rapture we are
[1:19:02] waiting like Enoch walking with God for
[1:19:05] the final quickening it won't happen in
[1:19:08] this assembly then the rest are
[1:19:09] streaming in oh we got to get this
[1:19:11] revelation of the rapture you know
[1:19:13] brother so-and-so is the only one that
[1:19:14] has it no this is the word of Jehovah
[1:19:17] Jireh that final quickening will be
[1:19:21] released around the world at the same
[1:19:23] time though Simon what are you saying
[1:19:28] I'm saying just being step with God
[1:19:32] because when he was down in Egypt the
[1:19:35] Holy Spirit would come to Joseph and
[1:19:38] said get out of Egypt Herod's dead gone
[1:19:43] back to Israel alright so what's he
[1:19:46] doing he's following the pillar of light
[1:19:50] you see the Holy Spirit is quickening
[1:19:52] the prophets words in those times
[1:19:55] because this they had to get out of
[1:19:58] Egypt the Bible said that it might be
[1:20:00] fulfilled as the Lord had spoken by the
[1:20:02] prophet out of Egypt that called my son
[1:20:04] it was a compound promise it had to be
[1:20:08] fulfilled that's why he had to be done
[1:20:11] in Egypt this is why even when they come
[1:20:14] into Israel the Holy Spirit lets her
[1:20:17] know you know when here he hears about
[1:20:20] ark Elias and Archelaus you know it's
[1:20:22] raining Joseph becomes fearful
[1:20:27] remember what I told you on Sunday fears
[1:20:29] not always a bad thing there's things
[1:20:33] here right that right there he was
[1:20:35] afraid to go thither it was when he was
[1:20:38] afraid her do I belong to the Lord
[1:20:41] there was no it was his something struck
[1:20:43] him there was that of a sensitivity just
[1:20:46] to stop just stop
[1:20:49] so what think of it Joseph's life had
[1:20:53] already through the dream if you're not
[1:20:57] to take Mary unto thee Mary that wife
[1:20:58] all the way through everything regarding
[1:21:02] all of this it was all under the
[1:21:05] leadership of the Holy Spirit fulfilling
[1:21:07] his word is that right so then here the
[1:21:11] Holy Spirit comes back God speaks to him
[1:21:14] in a dream and he tells him go into the
[1:21:18] going to the parts of Galilee and he
[1:21:20] goes into Galilee in the Bible said he
[1:21:23] turns aside into Nazareth that it might
[1:21:26] be fulfilled he shall be called a
[1:21:29] Nazarene this is being led by the spirit
[1:21:34] you see we can see we see what happened
[1:21:39] in the time of the Lord Jesus people had
[1:21:42] it all figured out
[1:21:44] and there's a natural part to us I mean
[1:21:47] I'm speaking just to a skier I'm talking
[1:21:50] to the church here and the internet
[1:21:53] knows right here there's a natural block
[1:21:56] there's certain things we start looking
[1:21:57] at even when things like this take place
[1:22:01] with that of the coronavirus I believe
[1:22:03] there's all I believe there's a lot of
[1:22:04] things taking place underneath this
[1:22:06] piece I believe there's things that we
[1:22:08] can see taking place as you heard me
[1:22:11] speak up on Tuesday night in our little
[1:22:13] time together there when we were
[1:22:15] chatting and we understand economically
[1:22:19] where it's breaking things down it has
[1:22:23] to come into a place to where somebody
[1:22:25] will step in and pay off the debt well
[1:22:30] brother Simon I believe that's going to
[1:22:31] be within the next year why don't you
[1:22:33] just say I believe that God is going to
[1:22:36] fulfill his word and I'm a part of that
[1:22:38] word don't go to putting dates and times
[1:22:41] and everything else sure when things are
[1:22:44] taking place we should feel the urgency
[1:22:46] but not just in times like this not just
[1:22:51] in times like this you see what I'm
[1:22:55] saying is not to be alert not for those
[1:22:58] things not to be looked at we understand
[1:23:01] those are markers those are indications
[1:23:03] of things that God has spoke to you and
[1:23:06] I we're not in darkness light has come
[1:23:10] into Goshen
[1:23:12] that we might know who we are we might
[1:23:14] know where we are and where we are going
[1:23:18] we're not looking for God to turn around
[1:23:21] America America has sinned away per day
[1:23:24] of grace we are looking for the rapture
[1:23:29] [Applause]
[1:23:31] God has moved us in position in his word
[1:23:36] to be able to see that so with this the
[1:23:42] word it's God who fulfills it down
[1:23:45] through time when when Jesus come they
[1:23:49] had it all figured out
[1:23:50] and remember as they had it all figured
[1:23:53] out over and over and over and over the
[1:23:55] Prophet wouldn't be me be very mindful
[1:23:57] to tell us this even to preach a message
[1:23:59] before the seals God hiding in
[1:24:02] simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:24:04] same he said he even set in there he
[1:24:08] would talk about Noah's message in
[1:24:09] Elijah's message then he brings it
[1:24:11] around in the message humble that self
[1:24:13] there in July of 63 he speaks of the
[1:24:17] working and the out working of the third
[1:24:19] pole it will be in humanity it will go
[1:24:22] over the top of many people's heads why
[1:24:25] because they have not humbled themselves
[1:24:28] the first humility is and the ultimate
[1:24:32] the humility to the word that says you
[1:24:35] must be born again you can know this
[1:24:39] message back and forth and if you don't
[1:24:41] come to know Jesus Christ in a personal
[1:24:44] living reality it's no more than
[1:24:46] doctrine you can know that back and
[1:24:49] forth but you've got to know him in the
[1:24:51] power of his resurrection hey man let me
[1:24:55] just be very clear right now there's
[1:24:57] been statements that have floors flown
[1:24:59] around over the past couple of years and
[1:25:01] they've come right down there from in a
[1:25:04] place where many things are gotten from
[1:25:06] and it comes around in there and they
[1:25:07] make a statement and say the tapes is
[1:25:09] the token or the message is the token
[1:25:11] there's a lot more to be said within
[1:25:14] that the person can have this message in
[1:25:16] their hand they can have and walk around
[1:25:18] they can have the tapes but the token is
[1:25:21] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:25:24] the baptism of the Holy Ghost outside of
[1:25:27] that there is no rapture amen God never
[1:25:34] sent a tape to seal me he sent the Holy
[1:25:37] Ghost are you with me these are a
[1:25:41] reality these are things in this hour
[1:25:44] for you and I have brought a reality to
[1:25:47] our life that's why when a person could
[1:25:50] say well you know the message is the
[1:25:52] token let's expand on that a little bit
[1:25:54] more let's unpack that so somebody
[1:25:56] walking around saying I believe the
[1:25:58] message so you know I must have the
[1:26:00] token no the beliefs gotta come from
[1:26:02] your heart not from
[1:26:03] head you can believe this message as the
[1:26:06] truth and still not be converted you've
[1:26:09] got to believe it from the heart not
[1:26:12] from the head when you believe it from
[1:26:15] the heart
[1:26:15] then God seals you with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:19] you can't never be the same no more mama
[1:26:30] mama how do we get there
[1:26:34] this assignment what are you saying I'm
[1:26:36] saying I'm saying just exactly the words
[1:26:38] of the prayer letter that went out that
[1:26:40] accompanied every little prayer cloth I
[1:26:42] love it
[1:26:43] brother brems said be simple period be
[1:26:46] natural period Wow two word sentences be
[1:26:50] simple period be natural period goes on
[1:26:54] to say begin to doubt your doubts begin
[1:26:57] to call those things that you have
[1:26:58] prayed and asked God for begin to call
[1:27:01] them your own
[1:27:04] it's a simplicity being natural being
[1:27:07] simple but Sammy so what are you saying
[1:27:10] well hey this is what I'm saying it's
[1:27:12] not up to you and I to try to make
[1:27:13] things out of things that aren't there
[1:27:15] but the Holy Spirit don't have to make
[1:27:17] things out of it you know to where I got
[1:27:18] a call brother richer and say brother
[1:27:20] richer here can you see it can you see
[1:27:22] it how I'm saying no remember he's God's
[1:27:24] child I'm God's child when the Holy
[1:27:26] Spirit wants to alert and show us these
[1:27:28] things remember is the Spirit of God
[1:27:30] that anoint our eyes to see it getting
[1:27:33] us in position this is why now bringing
[1:27:36] it down to our own life all things work
[1:27:39] together for the good to them who are
[1:27:42] called according to him to love the Lord
[1:27:44] and called according to his purpose
[1:27:46] to understand every word must come to
[1:27:48] pass God must fulfill every word and
[1:27:51] that word here it is resting within our
[1:27:54] lives the Holy Spirit quickens our lives
[1:27:59] but remember the scripture would tell us
[1:28:01] that within remember as it says here we
[1:28:04] are for therefore known predestinated we
[1:28:08] are called we are justified that those
[1:28:10] are justified
[1:28:11] he has already glorified and the see the
[1:28:13] finished product the finished product
[1:28:16] God brings his word to pass it is God
[1:28:19] fulfilling his word
[1:28:21] just like the Prophet could say things
[1:28:24] that ought to be he said God knew when
[1:28:25] you were going to stagger in that that
[1:28:27] you know he said that little mission
[1:28:28] that night who you were called to the
[1:28:30] altar that was the beginning of your
[1:28:31] walk with God some of us did not begin
[1:28:34] your walk with God did not begin in a
[1:28:36] message church
[1:28:37] it began in some other place not
[1:28:38] touching your life some of you watching
[1:28:40] you may be watching Jesus of Nazareth or
[1:28:42] the other thing and one another person
[1:28:44] you know look the peculiarity is how God
[1:28:47] would deal with the light and bring the
[1:28:48] life to the awareness I'm the sinner I
[1:28:50] need God what is it the work of God
[1:28:53] begins to unfold and it's not going to
[1:28:55] lead you you can never be content with
[1:28:57] staying where you were there was a
[1:28:59] yearning within your life for that to be
[1:29:02] made real within your heart and God
[1:29:05] seemed to it that all of these parts
[1:29:08] were arranged to bring his word to pass
[1:29:12] and can't any can't and isn't the same
[1:29:17] God who has watched over his word is he
[1:29:21] not still watching over his word is he
[1:29:25] not still here in the place to alert his
[1:29:29] children to events that are taking place
[1:29:32] to be able to say hey pay attention here
[1:29:35] hey look at this here he is in position
[1:29:39] to bring these things together because
[1:29:42] the ministry in this hour I said this
[1:29:45] before the Ministry of Malachi for
[1:29:47] brother Branham was not reaching when
[1:29:49] he's talked about do um he talked about
[1:29:52] Khrushchev and he talked about ah you
[1:29:55] know Eisenhower brother branham was not
[1:29:57] playing with somebody's last names
[1:29:59] brother Branham was not looking after
[1:30:01] you and in saying okay let me see I can
[1:30:03] put all this together brother man was
[1:30:05] not doing that it was the Spirit of God
[1:30:07] that gave the unction of those men's
[1:30:10] names and ties it ended Daniel for the
[1:30:13] sender what are you saying
[1:30:14] it ought to bring a rest to you and I to
[1:30:17] know that even when you and I it would
[1:30:20] seem like we're missing it but remember
[1:30:23] brother Ram said Oh God let me call
[1:30:25] their name they're gonna miss it they're
[1:30:26] gonna miss their healing we would have
[1:30:28] missed it many times but sometimes God
[1:30:31] has to come right now and call our name
[1:30:33] and say hey this is for you
[1:30:37] what is it God watching over his word
[1:30:40] and he healed perfect Psalms 138 8 the
[1:30:48] Lord will perfect that which concerns me
[1:30:56] remember he brings his word to pass
[1:30:59] you see what just some of the references
[1:31:02] we made it was with hardship
[1:31:06] the scripture the inspiration would
[1:31:10] speak to Daniel in regards to even the
[1:31:16] children of Israel returning back to the
[1:31:21] homeland under that of Cyrus's edik that
[1:31:27] God had put in place
[1:31:29] remember God already spoke of Cyrus gave
[1:31:32] the name in Isaiah called him my servant
[1:31:36] my shepherd Cyrus wasn't even a believer
[1:31:41] he never became a believer but he was
[1:31:44] there alerted to what he had to do oh my
[1:31:49] I'll tell you tonight
[1:31:51] think of this if the Holy Spirit can
[1:31:53] work on a life who's not even a believer
[1:31:55] how much more of he's dealing with your
[1:31:58] life how once you surrender to the Lord
[1:32:01] and say Lord you could use a man that
[1:32:04] never returned for you but my heart is
[1:32:06] longing to serve you your honor is
[1:32:09] longing to serve him there's a God to
[1:32:12] bring you into that reality of the
[1:32:14] desire he put within your life you never
[1:32:17] gave yourself that desire he put that
[1:32:21] there let him bring his word to pass
[1:32:28] you see then it's not trying to it's not
[1:32:33] people trying to fit quotes to cover
[1:32:35] their life fit fine quotes to cover
[1:32:39] their unbelief trying to put it together
[1:32:42] like a picture and you see a cow with
[1:32:45] its leg coming out its head going out
[1:32:47] the back everything is it wow what a
[1:32:49] freak looking thing why it's because
[1:32:52] it's being arranged by the hands of man
[1:32:55] by man's intellect but when God arranged
[1:32:58] it remember when God arranged it you
[1:33:00] don't have the cow eating out the top of
[1:33:03] the tree everything is in its right
[1:33:05] season and position you see a clearer
[1:33:09] picture God brings his word the best so
[1:33:14] the Lord will perfect that which
[1:33:16] concerns me this is why we need trials
[1:33:21] this is why we need to be tested so our
[1:33:25] character can be molded what's happening
[1:33:29] it's God bringing his word to pass
[1:33:33] you see that with the taxation you see
[1:33:36] all these things with Joseph and Mary
[1:33:37] here in the first coming there was a lot
[1:33:40] of things a lot of pressure and things
[1:33:42] build up as the time drew nigh there was
[1:33:46] a lot of pressure and things that build
[1:33:47] up but God was bringing his word to pass
[1:33:50] those who were being moved by the Spirit
[1:33:53] of God they did not know all that was
[1:33:55] taking place but they were being led and
[1:33:58] this is where the difference is it did
[1:34:01] not say the sons it said the sons of God
[1:34:03] they are led by the Spirit of God are
[1:34:08] you with me
[1:34:09] there were many Israel many in Israel
[1:34:12] who knew the scriptures who knew the
[1:34:15] prophets prophesy who knew all those
[1:34:17] things but they could not be led they
[1:34:21] knew it and they couldn't be led God
[1:34:24] knows how to hide himself in simplicity
[1:34:26] you see this is why within our life I'm
[1:34:29] just going to close here tonight
[1:34:32] this is why in our life
[1:34:35] that within our lives right now all
[1:34:39] things working together for the good
[1:34:43] where our lives are are likened to that
[1:34:46] of other of a a plant that is planted
[1:34:54] david would say that which is planted in
[1:34:58] the courts of the lord shall flourish
[1:35:02] and to recognize that when we've been
[1:35:05] planted in christ jesus
[1:35:08] everything that we have need of is in us
[1:35:12] when we have received the Holy Ghost
[1:35:16] everything brother Branham would bring
[1:35:20] it right down and said the rapture is in
[1:35:23] you already
[1:35:29] but what is it what has to happen
[1:35:31] there's got to be a drinking in of the
[1:35:34] water
[1:35:35] and then as the water a member as the
[1:35:38] nourishment as it's coming in then what
[1:35:40] happens then limbs
[1:35:43] limbs of the apple tree come forth limbs
[1:35:48] branches whatever then limbs come forth
[1:35:52] out of those limbs from there would come
[1:35:56] as you see the different leaves you got
[1:36:01] to have leaves then from the leaves come
[1:36:03] blossoms then from those blossoms that
[1:36:06] you and I stand in May
[1:36:09] maybe we'll be be inside this year and
[1:36:11] looking out and say oh what a beautiful
[1:36:13] apple tree but those blossoms are not
[1:36:16] the final stage those blossoms are only
[1:36:19] part of every seed bringing forth after
[1:36:22] its own kind it's only a stage the next
[1:36:26] stage is the Apple itself all four
[1:36:30] stages limbs leaves blossoms apples
[1:36:35] where did that all come from from that
[1:36:38] which is planted and it's drinking it's
[1:36:41] taking in and as it's taking in it's
[1:36:44] pushing out you see this is why taking
[1:36:48] in of the Word of God this is why
[1:36:50] drinking in this is why laying in the
[1:36:53] presence of God this is why pray this is
[1:36:56] why seeking the Lord this is why it's
[1:36:59] needed why it releases what is on the
[1:37:02] inside of us God is bringing his word to
[1:37:05] pass and what God has saw that
[1:37:10] reflection it comes and works its way
[1:37:13] out in this life
[1:37:16] is that right I wish I didn't have to
[1:37:21] stop there but I'm going to stop but I'm
[1:37:25] just going to stop and stop on that part
[1:37:28] of it all things our work are working
[1:37:32] together in heaven were already
[1:37:37] glorified in the prints of God the RAM
[1:37:40] said I'm just pushing out to it so what
[1:37:45] what does that mean in regards even to
[1:37:49] where we're at right now with the things
[1:37:53] that we're facing what does that mean to
[1:37:54] me as a believer what it means is God
[1:37:58] has ordained you in the part of this
[1:38:03] word God's going to fulfill and he is
[1:38:06] fulfilling his word in this hour the
[1:38:09] question is are you in the word are you
[1:38:14] in him
[1:38:16] if you're not in him and you know that
[1:38:19] your life isn't even not in position let
[1:38:21] me just tell you don't resist
[1:38:26] you might look at your life and say you
[1:38:29] don't know what I've done but remember
[1:38:31] he did not provide you
[1:38:34] he provided himself a lamb his eyes are
[1:38:39] not upon the worshipper his eyes are on
[1:38:43] the lamb and if there's any Fault in the
[1:38:47] lamb then you and have a cause to
[1:38:50] disbelieve you and half God could not
[1:38:53] even accept you but the Holy Spirit is
[1:38:56] letting you know you are free let me
[1:39:00] make that real to your heart that's what
[1:39:06] the gospel rings out freedom it's caught
[1:39:12] bringing things in position we did not
[1:39:15] put ourselves here God has brought us
[1:39:17] into this position but he didn't drag us
[1:39:21] he didn't put us in a headlock he didn't
[1:39:24] pick us up by the shirt collar he wooed
[1:39:26] us he let us to himself
[1:39:32] he's drawn us and here in our lives
[1:39:37] what was he drawing he was not drawing
[1:39:38] up on that old nature that old nature's
[1:39:40] rebellious that old nature is not a lamb
[1:39:43] nature but the Holy Spirit was seeing
[1:39:46] there's a lamb on the inside there's a
[1:39:49] lamb beneath that darkness there's a
[1:39:53] lamb on the inside there remember he is
[1:39:55] the Lamb of God we are known as the
[1:39:57] Sheep of God right
[1:40:00] our names are in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:40:03] he said I know my sheep by name and they
[1:40:06] are known of me and man we will not
[1:40:09] become a lamb we always were lambs but
[1:40:13] what had to happen
[1:40:15] it took the life of the Passover the
[1:40:18] Lamb of God that I to come and to move
[1:40:22] and break back the clouds and bring into
[1:40:25] expression that lamb that was trapped on
[1:40:28] the inside but where the lamb was
[1:40:31] trapped on the inside he came and gave
[1:40:34] me life and in giving life what was it
[1:40:38] his life for mine what did it do it
[1:40:42] awakened and he I'm closing and he
[1:40:46] remember we are ordained to be conformed
[1:40:50] to the image of the son just as he was
[1:40:53] the Lamb of God who was led to the
[1:40:55] slaughter the Bible also said who before
[1:40:59] her her Shearer's is dumb that same Holy
[1:41:03] Spirit inside of the life of the
[1:41:05] believer what does it bring forth it
[1:41:07] bring forth the Lambs of God that walk
[1:41:10] in perfect obedience and harmony with
[1:41:14] the desire to please the Lord
[1:41:16] all things work together for the good to
[1:41:22] them who love the Lord and are called
[1:41:26] according to his purpose sure God has
[1:41:29] two motors God has to allow
[1:41:31] circumstances to arrive to shape to mold
[1:41:34] to home to prepare to put us in
[1:41:36] positions but we see those things
[1:41:39] themselves are not good but they're
[1:41:41] working together for our God even in
[1:41:44] this when we're looking at this right
[1:41:46] here
[1:41:46] I will tell you this I can say this I
[1:41:50] can say this with all confidence as we
[1:41:55] come through this weren't gonna come
[1:41:57] through on the other side stronger than
[1:42:00] when we came in I could go right down
[1:42:04] through scripture after scripture after
[1:42:05] scripture showing the testimony that
[1:42:07] when things came like this the brides
[1:42:09] are gonna come out weaker the bride will
[1:42:11] come out stronger but the stronger
[1:42:13] remember what it means to be stronger it
[1:42:15] means she beasts become more dependent
[1:42:16] on him and less dependent on herself
[1:42:19] what's she doing her eyes are focused on
[1:42:22] him who has the key of David the veil is
[1:42:26] upon his shoulder she's focused remember
[1:42:28] he is my strength is the strength he's
[1:42:32] my light he's the strength of my life
[1:42:34] her focus is upon him not on herself so
[1:42:39] what does this do in the midst of it it
[1:42:42] does not call us to look and try to
[1:42:43] generate funds or things that we don't
[1:42:46] even have but to do it causes us to rest
[1:42:49] on him and God is working out more and
[1:42:52] more in our lives
[1:42:56] I'm so grateful for that so are
[1:43:00] confident are confident is that he is
[1:43:05] bringing his word to past you know what
[1:43:09] that should do is should take all
[1:43:11] anxiousness away from your life if
[1:43:16] you've been anxious remember the Holy
[1:43:18] Spirit is not condemning you but I will
[1:43:20] say this right here if you have been
[1:43:22] anxious of things and well I you know I
[1:43:25] I need to see this or see that don't
[1:43:27] don't be anxious because you get anxious
[1:43:30] you block off the Holy Spirit for him
[1:43:31] even speaking to you what should I do
[1:43:34] just rest God God wants you to see he
[1:43:38] will open your eyes to hasn't he opened
[1:43:42] your eyes thus far as in he led you this
[1:43:44] far hasn't he by His grace as in he
[1:43:47] impart in his life sure won't he see you
[1:43:50] and I the rest of it sure every step of
[1:43:53] the way in every junction of time this
[1:43:57] is why we look to him we can see certain
[1:43:59] events take place and we look at it we
[1:44:01] come to a certain spot and say Lord I
[1:44:03] see there probably there's certain
[1:44:05] things this or that the Lord you're in
[1:44:07] control
[1:44:08] I'm just loving you Lord I'm just loving
[1:44:11] you I'm glad to be in this love affair
[1:44:14] this relationship with you Lord Jesus
[1:44:17] because perfect love casts out all fear
[1:44:21] you see this is where fear is dismissed
[1:44:24] but you recognize you are always in his
[1:44:28] mind and the Holy Spirit come to seek
[1:44:32] you out and to make it real to your life
[1:44:34] when we can see that it doesn't matter
[1:44:37] what all other things take place we know
[1:44:40] for sure that we are going home we're
[1:44:46] going back home Egypt is not our home
[1:44:50] Amen the message never come to call us
[1:44:52] out and leave us here the message come
[1:44:54] to call us out and to take us in
[1:44:56] Redemption is two parts is that right
[1:45:00] and it begins with coming under the
[1:45:03] blood right now coming under the blood
[1:45:06] receiving the Holy Spirit right now
[1:45:09] and I just I feel like I could just
[1:45:11] preach all night here's just just things
[1:45:13] just flowing in my heart right now
[1:45:16] but I just say to you very clearly
[1:45:17] sometimes sometimes people are
[1:45:20] individuals they're so geared up on the
[1:45:22] part I I need to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:45:24] I need to receive the holy gold and they
[1:45:26] make it as though it's something that
[1:45:27] they themselves have to do it's not what
[1:45:30] you have to do the Holy Ghost is the
[1:45:32] gift of God you have to make yourself
[1:45:34] available
[1:45:36] you have to want it you have to desire
[1:45:39] him
[1:45:42] that's what it has to be and i say to
[1:45:45] any here or at home if you know you
[1:45:47] don't have you don't have to say I tried
[1:45:50] this I tried to do it don't allow the
[1:45:52] devil to be the spokesman for God's Word
[1:45:54] don't allow him to be the interpreter of
[1:45:57] the word for your life look what his
[1:45:59] interpretation has brought it's brought
[1:46:02] death he doesn't hold the mystery to
[1:46:05] your life God holds the mystery to your
[1:46:08] life it's God who unfolds it so what
[1:46:12] does it take brother Samuel fall in love
[1:46:14] with him it's what it takes falling in
[1:46:17] love with him
[1:46:20] it's letting go it takes surrendering
[1:46:24] it takes giving into him it takes being
[1:46:28] obedient take surrendering to the Lord
[1:46:32] devil tries to bring such confusion with
[1:46:34] on those things and it's very very very
[1:46:36] very simple you say what does it have to
[1:46:39] be
[1:46:39] it's your does what is your desire
[1:46:42] what's your desire what is your desire
[1:46:46] God puts the desire and the longing and
[1:46:50] the thirst for life within you because
[1:46:53] it's through that thirst you pull and it
[1:46:58] brings you to him only he can satisfy it
[1:47:02] only he can let's pray
[1:47:08] father
[1:47:14] Lord I
[1:47:16] I just feel just so moved
[1:47:19] Oh God in my spirit Lord so pressed in
[1:47:26] my heart
[1:47:30] and Lord in the same instance of such
[1:47:34] wrath such peace Lord my heart is his
[1:47:42] pressed it smooth Lord for those who
[1:47:46] would not know you in this way Lord
[1:47:54] that's my heart's desire is that they
[1:47:59] would know you in the power of your
[1:48:00] resurrection that God that reality would
[1:48:04] strike in their hearts in their life and
[1:48:10] Lord I also and just thinking God of
[1:48:14] every of the hearts of your children
[1:48:16] tonight what a rest it brings to us Lord
[1:48:22] we see that Lord all we've been alerted
[1:48:28] to the day we're living we we see oh God
[1:48:37] by your grace there's things Lourdes you
[1:48:41] were just expressing the other night so
[1:48:44] thankful Lord God for the evening light
[1:48:49] the Holy Spirit in this hour that is
[1:48:52] made the Word of God real to our hearts
[1:48:59] Lord Jesus to alert us to point us to
[1:49:05] where we are quicken us for the moment
[1:49:13] lord I I just I'm so thankful we look
[1:49:15] back down we see what we're seeing take
[1:49:18] place we see that Lord there are things
[1:49:21] that were already sent identified spoken
[1:49:26] Lord by the Holy Spirit through the
[1:49:32] mouth of your prophet we see that Lord
[1:49:34] these are things that he did not speak
[1:49:36] things outside of the word but it was
[1:49:38] identifying parts that were within the
[1:49:40] word but declaring this is the hour this
[1:49:43] is the time and yet Lord went to declare
[1:49:46] this is the hour this is the time as it
[1:49:49] is in your word when I would say the
[1:49:52] time is at hand
[1:49:54] it did not mean at that moment but it
[1:49:57] would mean in the season so Lord as
[1:50:01] we're looking at the word we're thankful
[1:50:05] and we're resting we're looking to you
[1:50:08] oh I'm glad I'm glad Lord that you did
[1:50:12] not put it that we have to try to figure
[1:50:15] things out but we have to try to put
[1:50:19] things together
[1:50:20] no Lourdes is to be under the leadership
[1:50:23] of the Holy Spirit your prophet gave us
[1:50:26] simple a simple message that was more
[1:50:29] than just the message called visions of
[1:50:32] William Branham that to me Lord was the
[1:50:35] divine orchestration of how you work in
[1:50:38] each of our lives the Prophet at times
[1:50:41] even when he tried to take that baby and
[1:50:43] pray for it it was thus saith the Lord
[1:50:45] that that baby was gonna rise but he had
[1:50:48] to wait too and everything else got in
[1:50:50] position that little baby got worse and
[1:50:56] actually the orders it started going
[1:50:58] into different fits but Lord he had to
[1:51:02] wait on you Lord to me that was Holy
[1:51:06] Spirit that was the counsel of the Holy
[1:51:08] Spirit to our hearts telling us that
[1:51:12] this vision is sure
[1:51:17] not to wait upon you or as the Bible
[1:51:21] would just encourage us it is good for a
[1:51:26] man to hope and quietly wait on the Lord
[1:51:32] is to be in that position in love with
[1:51:35] you and then Lord when the handkerchief
[1:51:37] has to be here this person on the bed
[1:51:39] the glass is here all those parts it'll
[1:51:42] be in its position at its time and you
[1:51:45] alert us and like the Prophet was
[1:51:48] setting there he said oh oh oh you
[1:51:50] should just sit down now or she just
[1:51:52] sits he was getting it was an
[1:51:53] anticipation Lord we can see we see
[1:51:57] things Lord taking place but I think my
[1:52:01] dad others had lived even before Lord
[1:52:04] that I went on they would live they
[1:52:06] would see things taking place all with
[1:52:08] anticipation and rightly so we should be
[1:52:13] under anticipation every church age
[1:52:19] whipped fell asleep under the
[1:52:24] anticipation of the coming of the Lord
[1:52:28] they did not live in their time and say
[1:52:30] well lady Oh see it hasn't come to pass
[1:52:33] yet no they lived in anticipation for
[1:52:37] the coming of the Lord but it's in this
[1:52:40] time Lord as you would make known this
[1:52:43] is the time of the fulfillment Oh God
[1:52:46] let every one of us be found ready Lord
[1:52:49] if there's one under the sound of my
[1:52:51] voice it's not ready I pray that God
[1:52:53] that they quickly would Lord take unto
[1:52:56] themselves the provision that's been
[1:52:59] made by the blood of the Lamb they would
[1:53:03] quickly Lord take it under their bosom
[1:53:06] and say God change me
[1:53:08] deliver me may it fall upon their hearts
[1:53:10] like it did upon Jacob and say God I'm
[1:53:13] tired of being Jacob change me Lord
[1:53:17] deliver me lord
[1:53:20] hello Granite Lord metal holy spirit

[1:53:46] weeks Lord ask God according to your
[1:53:53] word you said I've never seen the
[1:53:55] righteous forsaken for a child of God

[1:54:36] my cares upon him and take all of my
[1:54:39] worry I give it to him because all
[1:54:46] things are working together for the good

[1:56:35] Holy Spirit does for our lives as
[1:56:39] believers we're on our toes brother

[1:56:45] said the believers are on their toes

[1:57:24] giving their life to the Lord and
[1:57:26] repenting think of that I think God for
[1:57:30] that but you look at what even more and
[1:57:33] more that's going on the world is
[1:57:36] becoming more dependent upon the world
