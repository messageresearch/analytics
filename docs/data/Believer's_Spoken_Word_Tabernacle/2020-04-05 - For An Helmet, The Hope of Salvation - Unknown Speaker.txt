you know every part so Lord we ask that God that you'll just move upon every life in such a special way take us Lord use us for your glory minister right there in their living rooms God or father you always come where you're invited Lord we just Lord want to just commit this service Lord now into your hands we ask it for your glory in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you this morning we want to turn right to the word of the Lord I want to go right to first Thessalonians chapter five this morning and we certainly want to greet each and every one of you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus and just just looking and expecting amen for great things that the Lord is going to do and we just want to begin reading here in the scripture in verse 1 of first Thessalonians 5 but of the times and the seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as a has travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of darkness therefore let us not sleep as others as do others but let us watch and be sober that word term that would be used in the scripture sober it deals with one who is calm and collected in their mind for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night so we see how Paul's bringing this this here of day and night those that are asleep those are awake and to recognize that there is a darkness it is a nighttime upon the earth as far as civilization you can look out your window we can look at it here and know that as far as in this physical day we see daylight but yet in the spiritual context of the setting of God's word it's night and that of the world itself is darkness where we are in the the time of night and it's ready for the breaking of the day that breaking of the day one who has Herald it be on coming of the morning star there's already been an announcement go out chalo we recognize that where we are so to be of the day is where that light the light that lighteth every man we have been born of that light the Holy Ghost as they have light in Goshen so we have light in our vessels the very the very first part of the scripture of the text for the rapture Psalms 27 1 the Lord is the light of my life so we have light there's an understanding there's life that has come to us so we are not sleeping groping wandering or even under a false expectation our expectation is of the Lord so Paul is saying here that for our lives let us watch and be sober we've been directed on what we are to be watching and expect enough so notice how he goes on in verse 8 but let us who are of the day be sober once again putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him so we want to look here in the scriptures for and take this thought this morning for an helmet the hope of salvation so may the Lord bless you as we are is through the reading of the word and as you're being seated and you were there in your homes but I just you notice and here with a local assembly we took a little bit of a just under the Lord's leading just a little bit of a break there from when we spoke in the first part of March we've been dealing with the thought the crowning of our life and how that we were admonished as brother Branham would tell us in the Philadelphian age he said Jesus come in this in that particular quote he said Jesus comes in the time of trouble and that's when he comes and he's talking about the coming of the Lord because in the Philadelphian age they were admonished the admonishment of the Spirit is hold fast to that that which thou hast behold I come quickly and so when we consider the coming of the Lord remember in the in the in the minds of man man looks at the coming of the Lord and the Holy Spirit picks it up through Peter and says that that mind mind frame or that mindset of the carnal man looking at the at the scripture he looks at it in a manner it says all things are as they were such from the beginning see they don't recognize those things that are actually being done it doesn't mean that they don't know what's going on what's being reported this virus or this earthquake there it doesn't mean that they don't read those things but to recognize that for you and I it's not that we have to have everything put together and this is this but we know that every event like we looked at on Thursday God is at work and everything is setting the scene and God is moving right in the midst of his children even as we see this where the scripture said there would be earthquakes in divers places and we see that taking place we've seen that and see these are things that even as you look over time as we said the service as a goal the word old the carnal becomes even further hardened because you come through this ah nothing really took place and they keep moving along ah nothing took place it's just like through the nation here 9/11 happened everybody goes to church everybody starts praying and you know but then after a period of time after that event fades and that fades from the mind of the people they go back and resume life is normal but for the bride of Jesus Christ if not for God's grace you are i we would be even in the same commission we would be even looking for many of the expectations that the ecumenical world is looking for they're looking for a revival but God has delivered the revival but the revival is not something of a gathering so much of people it's a revival of God's Word the Living God in the hearts of his children and so we know that we are by his grace in that moment and so these are things that for in our lives we are thankful to God for the unction of the Holy Spirit to know God is working all of these things are setting the stage it's just like when you go to a drama you watch a play that's on the stage and when you look at that state when you look at the play that's on the stage they have different props that are set up on the stage and they have it so if they're supposed to be in a tropical setting they'll have maybe fake palm trees or palm trees they drew and they'll have things that look like sand they're trying to get a background or a picture the setting established of where it's taking place and so we recognize that within the setting of the coming of the Lord it indeed is in the time of trouble we recognize brother Brennan would tell us like this I believe it in the message Jubilee year brother Bram said sin is going to continue to get worse and worse and worse he said do not expect it to get any better and so our expectation that's what we really want to hone in and deal with here this morning in this thought of the coming of the Lord because the Prophet had admonished us by the Spirit of God in the Philadelphia church age there when he took of that that scripture hold fast behold I come quickly and he expressed that and remember as we looked at it he spoke of that in time and of how he says take unto you the full armor of God and he says use every weapon that God has given you he said use every gift that God has given to the body so all of this God has provided all that we have meet up and I want to draw your attention here because in this scripture in 1st Thessalonians 5 a how when we reach back and we were speaking of this back in the first part of mark you recognize when the promise of the Messiah was to come remember that was the the Keystone the capping off of the Old Testament when he came Isaiah describes his coming as that of the helmet of salvation he was adorned with and he had for a breastplate righteousness as a breastplate now we know that we're to be clothed with the full armor of God but the Spirit of God through Paul who also wrote in Ephesians 6 of the armor of God wrote here and said that because of here the darkness and the night and how than in our lives we are to conduct ourselves we are admonished be sober and put on the breastplate of faith and love because remember faith and love are they go their kinfolks they go together and having on the breastplate is from within the heart doing what is right and that isn't just doing well you know the word says this but it's wanting to have the right attitude motive and objective behind all these things asking that God that everything would be in line with his mind so we look here the other part of it which we're dealing with this morning for an helmet the hope of salvation we understand that the whole armor of God is supernatural but notice how it spoke here for an helmet this is what you did take for the protective gear and brother branham would draft us into the greatest valuer fought and says notice this is the covering of the head it's the mind it's where decisions are made the covering of the helmet this is the battleground area so we're to have on foreign helmet use foreign helmet the hope of salvation and hear the word hope that is used here is that word which means to anticipate with a great deal of pleasure it's an expectation of good ah with joyful confidence and you notice it goes on with that of the hope the the earnest the expectation of salvation now this salvation we're not talking about well you know Lord I need you to say my soul he's already done that if he had if that reality hasn't come into your heart you can receive that this morning because even as he deals with your life remember he has to deal with your heart you can't get anything with God from God until you first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so it takes God even dealing with the heart for you to even have an expectation to say Lord the Holy Ghost belongs to me so Lord I'm asking that you would fill me with the Holy Ghost you have to recognize the promises that belong to you before you can never have an expectation on the God who made the promise to come and fulfill it so then we look at this term of that of the expectation of salvation and this word used here in the scripture it deals with deliverance it deals with preservation safety deliverance from the molestation of enemies it deals with health it deals with a present possession that belongs to every Christian it deals with all of the benefits and the blessings that belong to us now and those that we are to come in to either as we go by the way of the grave or by that of rapture we have a sure promise because he have not appointed us to wrath we are not going through the tribulation we have already passed from death unto life the blood has already come to execute judgment upon the oppression of their own nature and has lifted and separated by the cleansing foe and imparted his life we have a token and of assurance that we are not appointed unto wrath we are to obtain salvation from the Lord the rapture belongs to us as believers because he the scripture goes on to say he made that way he died for us he made the way for you and I so that you and I we don't have to go to hell we don't have to pay for our sins we do not have to be parted from his presence as a matter of fact he has made a way that where I am there you may be also he made that way so our expectation is is that the Lord as I am in him and he is in me there is a union that has taken place that has given me a divine assurance I shall never be left alone having never alone let me just tell you this morning even when you feel alone you are not alone for the Lord is right there with you well glory be to God we are saved as I think like her you know one of the men that brother Branham would refer to I love this how aww pink who wrote the sovereignty of God he would write it in this way he said it is the fourfold salvation we are saved from the penalty power presence and pleasure of sin oh my we that is the salvation of the Lord and the salvation of the Lord is sure now I want to just like you know I'm just looking at this you know and sometimes there's things that kind of you know I are moving in our hearts and then the Holy Spirit just kind of you know picks it up and and we bring it forth but to think you know within this our lives brother Branham over and over you find when he's talking about the helmet of salvation he will speak of it in this term there's a few places where he'll actually kind of deal with it in the battle but this in this time he will find where he'll go on to say oh he says when I come to that morning when I come to that day when I would stand on the other side he said when he says I come to that moment and he said of my crossing he said I'm gonna take off the helmet of salvation he said I'm gonna undo the sandals upon my feet I said I'm gonna take the sword and I'm gonna put it back inside of the sheath and look what and this is what he says I didn't include him but it'll be in the notes that will get sent out he says when that takes place he says I know as I go through the valley of the shadow of death the morning star will come out to light the lane because remember he remember as David said in Psalms 23 he said yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow you can't have a shadow without light yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me so we notice notice the the expectation is in that moment I know that he will be there I know the Holy Ghost will spread its wings and carry me across that terrible muddy Jordan I don't worry he's said in another place he will be there he will be waiting Oh glory he said he'll be waiting if you'll just trust in him don't worry he says I know he will be there why because that's the expectation so then as we realized that we would as until the time of our departure whether we go by the way of the grave our body change we must keep on this helmet as a matter of fact we're honest by the Spirit of God right here as Paul would make it as it's in Ephesians 6 and then picking it up here it is an absolute necessity all the armour of God is but within this how the Holy Spirit would highlight this in terms of where we are living in this day in the coming of the Lord for in helmet take for and helmet a protection over your head be expectation of deliverance so until that time where we receive the deliverance where we receive the redemption of body whether we go by the way of the grave or whether we go in that of the rapture in the meantime we need our helmet on and we need the sword in our hands we need the breastplate of faith and love expecting listen to me now expecting deliverance in every situation with faith and love because we are people of deliverance so we need true expectation now when you look in the scripture here that we read it takes for a helmet the hope of salvation the breastplate of that of faith and charity remember all three of these work together brother Branham would call these as it's mentioned in first Corinthians 13:13 and now abideth faith hope and charity these three but the greatest of these is charity we realize you can have faith you can have hope but if you don't have charity remember though you have faith to move mountains it is nothing and as brother Branham would tell us he said somebody can have such burly faith to where things will actually move on their behalf but he said if they don't have kindness or charity they will actually ruin their influence so he said these are three things brother man would take us to mount Transfiguration and mount Transfiguration remember is the very speaks even of the coming of the Lord where even we're in this right here where Christ himself right there the adoption of the son remember we are living in the adoption time of sons and daughters of God the same word that speaks of the groom speaks of the blind so to think of it in the very adoption and the adornment there because the voice of God is in the bride and to think of this right now it is Christ Himself that is there he is veiled in the midst of his bride and he is the one speaking through her is that right and what is present for that revelation for this adoption it is faith hope and charity that accompanies it the same way it did on Mount Transfiguration nor glory be to God this is coming together because right off of that mountain it moves right down to the revealing of the 44,000 and out into the millennium and in the future home so this faith hope and charity the Prophet would place it like this he would tell us these are the sufficient elements he would tell us these are the greatest things he would say these are the sufficient elements that are needed for the church and he said when the church has these three things there's not one problem he said that can stand before the church there's not one problem he said that they will be seen through why faith hope and charity because remember in order to have faith faith is a revelation is that right but you don't get a revelation without love so it first must be love must be the governing like it must be the governing of our lives it must govern our actions as believers we love Him because He first loved us that has become real within our hearts so now that love that's residing within our life what does love do love love itself when it comes to such a degree it moves into that place to where it is produces a perfect faith a complete trust a complete confidence in the Lord because faith holds within it is the revelation of the will of God and once God's will is revealed then you and I then have a real true hope we have a true expectation not something we've made up not something we've wanted to happen a way we wanted it to happen Lord I want you to do it this way no we are looking to the Lord and we are waiting on his divine inspiration remember as we said last week if even if God Himself does not speak and give us per se so you know your wife will be out of the hospital in two days and she'll send in a living room God can do that he still does that but if he doesn't speak in that way we still have a sure word of prophecy for he said the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise him up he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover he said I bless your bread and water and I'll take sickness from among you and the Lord that he loved all banned diseases we have promise after promise after promise that sure and we can stand there and say lord I don't know how you're gonna do it but I'm standing right here on your word what is that that is for an helmet the hope of salvation Oh glory be to God in the highest so we need these three to move together because hope hope by itself will never do hope by itself is just hoping but it puts something way out in advance but faith says it's now but faith brother bran would tell us faith what a beautiful thing it's timid faith is is timid it's something that is delicate and how that God would so write this in here on faith hope and charity now let's look here in the scriptures a little bit this morning in this hope that you and I are to have and find within it that it is a part of the DNA the stock of believers down through time that have had this revelation on their heart Paul would write in Revelations 15 or Romans 15:4 sorry whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning that we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope I believe that and I'm a witness of that aren't you how many times that where the Lord has spoke to us through his word and God will minister right through his word not just when we're Church but even when you might be reading in your devotional time it can even be when you're walking along your knee you you've already read and hear the things that you're meditating on and all of a sudden here God will bring something right through the word that will absolutely address what is it it's the Living God he is just unfolding of his word and ministering to our situation why that we might have hope Romans 15:13 now the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing this is what real hope does the god of hope not man-made hope but the god of Hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing that you may abound in Hope through the power of the Holy Ghost so in other words our expectation becomes greater and greater the closer the longer we serve the Lord our expectation ought to be growing greater in our lives it should not be diminished it ought to be growing greater well then how can that be but by the God of hope that he will fill us with joy and peace in believing that we might abound in hope but remember you can't have hope without faith and faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God this is why that Jude would say building up yourselves on your most holy faith you have got to feed your experience you've got to feed your wall if you let your walk go down if you let your personal life go down your hope starts shrinking brother remember the god of Hope not your home not my home I'm not talking about something well I hope I get healed I hope that's not the kind of hope I'm talking about yes sir this kind of a hope says by His stripes I am already healed let the credit come around and say hey you want so and so claiming that and they died yeah they did but remember they got healed they just didn't get the healing in this dimension they got the healing in the other dimension hallelujah so the bounding of our hope so the parts of the abounding of our hope let's look at this just for a moment because remember we need this helmet of salvation throughout our walk with God and the abounding of Hope yes feeding on the word our personal experience with God we need to be drawing upon that now let's look at how that our hope would actually continue to abound to actually grow greater and greater verse 1 of Romans 5 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in hope of the glory of God now notice what Paul is saying here our rejoicing is in hope of the glory of God not in press and circumstances so much but it's rejoicing in an expectation we know where we are going we know in whom we have believed and we believe he is able so notice rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope you mean brother Simon I just can't get on a mailing list and they just mail me more hope nope this is how hope abounds hope in order for hope to abound then there must be situations that would actually come about through tribulation patience itself would stand there and when you don't have an answer whatsoever but you're standing there and saying but God has given a word and I'm one of his children who are you housing on the door I don't know how it's gonna do it it's up to him how he chooses to fulfill his word I just want to have my heart and my eyes ready I want to have the breastplate of faith and hope I want to have that of that of the helmet of salvation on I want to be expecting God to come and fulfill his word Oh glory many times the reason we get disappointed is because we create expectations for God but remember those who have done that have always missed him the way that he comes now I'm not just talking about for John the Baptist I'm not just talking about the Messiah I'm talking about the way that he comes to our life on an individual basis there might be things that can be taken place in you're alive and you're praying about it brother BAM says when we pray he said you know he says weak to ourselves can make an idol out of God because we pray and we want it to happen in a certain way and because God doesn't answer that way though he answered he said he said but yet because he don't answer that way we will say he didn't answer he said but God is an idol man it's not up at door around God said I packed you around Alleluia remember he is not an idol but you remember we are his idols but we are not idols that he'll are dumb or as I can't see but we have been anointed our ears have been opened eyes have been anointed we are living images of the Living God well notice and rejoice verse has this goes on here and verse 5 and hope maketh not ashamed so how experienced how does hope how does hope continue - about tribulations been whose patience patience is that it's waiting on the word this is what God has promised I don't know how it's going to come but I know God so in the midst of it it is an experience when God has brought you through tribulation it is a personal experience through the midst of that time to wear that now Hulk can abound in your life the tests and trials are all part of the shaping and molding and making of our lives this is why Paul would go on and say hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given of us so in other words we're not ashamed in when we come to it our hope it's not a hope that we have made it is not a hope but well I think it's gonna happen this way or or this is going to take place no when we go according to our own hope we end up a shame but let me tell you something when we have hoped through the word from God we are never ashamed as we're looking to the Lord because this type of this this type of a part that's based right here it is not something that is contrived of our own doing but rather it is the love of God notice we are hope it maketh us not ashamed why because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts what does love produce the love produces faith it's a complete trust in him it's not trying to tell him how to do it how are you ought to do it it is not for us to try to instruct the Lord it's for us to let our mine be getting taken out of the way and let the mind of Christ step down on the inside so here we notice a many times it's our own thinking because God he is always faithful notice how David would write of this in psalm 62:5 my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him so in other words David is saying the expectation that I have in my life for the Lord it has come from him he has delivered to me in my life which has brought an expectation those of you that know this this is this right here this scripture is part of the text for the message to Lord it is part of that particular text that my soul weight only upon God it's not looking for who has the cutting edge the how does this person say in this or whose another it's not about that we are looking to the Lord for my expectation is from him notice David goes on and says Psalms 119 114 thou art my hiding place and my shield I hope in thy word now watch this part here has neighborhood right here in verse 16 he would ask the Lord we're talking about that we would have bad that our hope maketh not ashamed remember David said uphold me according unto that word app hope means give me and endow me with the strength Lord that is according to thy word to know that within every word to be fulfilled it is to be God come on the scene and it's God to fulfill that word prove it through our lives so David is asking Lord uphold me strengthen me according unto that word that I may live and let me not be ashamed of my hope so David here is unlocking that is the expectation David how is this going to come out I don't know exactly how it's going to come out but I know the Lord is with us just like when David was waiting on the Lord and wanted to know if God wanted him to pursue to the enemy remember as David was waiting he looked to the Lord and God answered him and David was able to go with faith expecting complete victory from the Lord is that right so notice to not be ashamed of my hope because remember our hope is not according to our thinking we have been taken the word and fashioning according to our thinking or this is going to be the outcome and this is going to be the way remember Bill Graham told us this over and over people he said have charts he said they've got this man's Elisha and this one and this one and this one they have all those types of things there is a certain part about it and sometimes it's just in human nature the way that people are made up some people themselves say if I'd say like this they are prone to conspiracy they think everything is a conspiracy of the government or this or that that is not what the message is about as a matter of fact the message is the direct opposite of any conspiracy I'm telling you it's the same spirit upon conspiracy theory is the same devil that has led a lot of people right away from this message because they begin to doubt things that are set right in front of them we're not to be caught up with that spirit of conspiracy we are to be caught up with the Spirit of Almighty God because there is no faith or no substance in the spirit of conspiracy oh but we can hope in the truth of the Lord and that we will not be ashamed is that right oh I'm glad aren't you I'm glad we don't have a big ol bowl of kool-aid up here and everybody's gonna drink it let's all hold hands and die together I'm glad that we're not drinking out of kool-aid brother I'm glad that we have been invited to the washing of water by the word where we can actually be cleansed and separated even in our thoughts and our thinking I'm feeling uh not only ourselves watch but every bit of our lives washed OH Psalms 119 49 remember the word unto thy servant notice remember the word Lord what you spoke to me your servant oh and look how David puts himself under the word I'm your servant Lord upon which thou has caused me to hope how many people could be reading even in that of let's say 1st Thessalonians 4 1st Corinthians 15 2nd Peter chapter 2 how many could be reading that even this morning and yet reading it and even those that would be around and saying hold the rapture we're looking for the rapture of the church listen friends if not for the mercy of God you and I would not be resting on this rock in the right way it has been God fulfilling and keeping his word that the promise of the rapture has been unfolded through the message of the hour in this time we are not resting on the tradition of a manner we have been founded upon that which has caused me to hope it is the Lord that has released inspiration for me now it's my head lifted up above mine enemies thou has hid me in the secret of the tabernacle in that pavilion and you have set me upon a rock we have a sure foundation glory be to God that's why this message to you and I when we receive it in the right way it is the revelation of Jesus Christ to our lives personally brother you can never ever be the same again your soul has been set on fire Paul in prison you see here is testing here is tribulation here are things that we go through Paul was put into prison and notice here he is in prison he says for I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer he's counting on the church praying and the supply of the spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death what was Paul saying I have not put God in a box I'm not going to be ashamed according to their earnest expectation what I know is is the situation I'm in I'm trusting in him for salvation in the midst of this trial I'm trusting him for salvation in the midst of this situation and whether or not whether I live or whether I die he is my salvation and my expectation is in deliverance oh my he's never failed me and he can't fail me he's not going to start failing us and nothing shall I be ashamed oh my let's kind of maybe switch gear just a moment here romans 8 verse 17 notice the promise and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I reckon man that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us your powers and the present testings and trial and tribulation they are not worthy to even be put on the same basis of what awaits us all what does Paul say he's got the helmet of salvation all and others are looking and saying Paul it's in a midst of a bad situation but Paul could say yet in the midst of it we have a real true expectation the sufferings that we're going through are not worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God the earth is groaning the earth is groaning the earth is longing you know why the earth for Omaha the earth is just like you and I we were longing for life you might have south east and south displeasure when here did this and tried to satisfy everything but what it was there was a first down on the inside just like this earth has a thirst it is part of redemptions plan and remember as much as it had a longing within its heart God would actually begin to move upon that earth because the world itself is not the earth the world is the system that is upon the earth that's why there's got to come a change I'm moving out of that world or glory and why is the moving out of that world that there might be a cleansing that that kingdom of heaven might be set down upon this earth Oh glory it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God not something out there in the Millennium but right now for the manifestation of the sons of God we do not become sons in the Millennium it's right now we become sons if you if we can just capitalize on this for a moment brother branham it's not the Spirit of God it's not urging us says though that we're going around oh you're the manifestation of the sons of God you need to go around and do great signs and wonders no we do not do signs and wonders signs and wonders follow us they are a part that company behind our life but the reality of what sons and daughters of God is here's where the reality of the adoption of the Lord Jesus Christ moving in our life that we recognize like the prodigal son I always was the son and daughter of God I always belonged to him and the real reality and truth of election it breaks forth upon our life to recognize that we have always belonged to God I've always been a she but God has drawn me into his pasture and he has birthed me into that house the house of God the Word of God Jesus Christ I have been birthed into him he has brought me to his banqueting table his banner over me is loves glory waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and his sons of God we stand in this hour on our god-given rights let me just tell you right now as the son and daughter of God you've got a right to stand right there even in your home I don't care how close that coronavirus would come I don't care what sickness it is I don't care what comes your way a troublesome fault or whatever more you've got a ride as a son and daughter of God just say I've got the token applied to this house and this body itself it is not my permanent inheritance but it's my possession there is no room for you in here there's no room for you here and there ain't no room for you here I'm telling you get out of here you don't got no right what is that that's a son and daughter of God that's exercising Dominion by the revelation of Jesus Christ that has come to you and I all glory for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly not willingly God did not make this happen remember they had a choice in the beginning but God subjected it he placed this right here the choice before him but by reason of him who have subjected the same in hope see remember when the fall took place before there was atom molecule Stardust before even the coming forth were called here the word the issuing forth remember the word was already he is the word it was with God already it was already settled is that right so he has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption whoa that's a truth ain't it amen the younger I got I mean the older I get you begin to recognize man more and more the corruption it is pains and eights and stretches and other things that you never had to think about before but what is it it's a bondage of corruption but thanks be to God Liberty's already come on the inside we've already been set free from the first birth and by the Dominion of the second birth of the set by the second Adam we have an authority and we can say I'm gonna lead you to a body change I am going to change you is that right remember Jesus he raised up his own body come on now hey man you know what I'm quoting from in the rapture he says I'll shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our bodies you see you can tell you can tell by the life that's being lived if the helmet of salvation is on and if you've got sidetracked for some reason in your life maybe there's been business affairs and other things you've gone into traps and snares and listen friends traps and snares are not altogether well you know brother Simon I shouldn't started watching movies or heard this or that no no you underestimate the devil so much traps and snares can come in the form of family traps and snares can come in the form of things that will actually fall and you come right into it it don't look like saying don't seem like saying it seems like everything is alright and notice what happens it begins then has a trap to try to take away but God gives grace for you to say wait a minute here I have approached this situation without the helmet of salvation because remember the helmet of salvation it is made out of brass brass is divine judgment you are to judge every thought every situation we are to pass it through that of the economy of God and say is this going to draw me closer or is it going to take me away if it takes me away it's not of God I don't care how good it seems outright it seems how innocent it seems if it gets between me and Jesus it is what God wants for me to do I'm talking about adopted sons and daughters of God for we are saved by hope well I thought we would say by faith we are but remember faith is the substance of things hoped for faith gives faith the revelation places it there and we begin to expect we are saved by hope but hope that is not but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does here yet hope for but if we hope for that we see not then why do we with patience wait for it now every one of us have him have either been in or we are in one or even and we're looking at the situation that we're in now throughout the world and to recognize that within it we are not we are not as the children of God we are not to be in a manner of where we are just defeatist in our minds you understand what I'm talking about we are not to be walking around and and defeated but we are saved by hope it is just like you could walk right into this church or right there in your living room you put on it you put on a message or you're listening to the word as it's coming forth right now you might be so low in your spirit you might be down you might be going through a hard time right now in the midst maybe of your body or the situation that is taking place but there is something that reigns within our heart that says I'm going to be saved by hope and what does that mean it means I've got an expectation I don't know how God's going to do it this morning but I know that God's got something for me and God's gonna speak to my heart he's gonna do something that'll help me and encourage me and lift me I'm not asking him to take me out of the trial I'm just asking him for the strength and the grace to go through that trial I am saved by hope I have an expectation when I come to the house of God when I'm listening to the message when I'm in Oh God he is gonna speak and meet my need that's the same kind of expectation for the rapture so you see why we need this helm and we're not waiting on the helmet to the moment before the body change no we have the helmet now and where to put it on use it this is live that Paul would go on to say rejoicing in hope this is how we're to live rejoicing in Hope now you listen if in our minds or our hearts we look at this Scripture and this seems like a walk Disney scripture to you first of all you need to repent you need to ask God for looking at Scripture and with unbelief you need to look back at the scripture and realize when Godhra had Paul wrought this by unction were to rejoice and hope it did not mean that we would know the outcome we don't know how things are going to come out we don't even know in this situation with that of the virus but you know what that's not what I'm drawing my joy from my joy has never been upon what the world can produce it is based on the Lord he is seeing us through and God through the luthier through all of it he is coming and may not be just not just talking about coming but you understand he is coming to minister and see us through so rejoicing in Hope but the reason a lot of this don't take place like verse 12 is because the helmet you know the only time that a helmet came off was for a period of rest but let me just say this to you we've entered into God's rest and we don't rest till we get me on the river you need that helmet on for every situation this is an hour you better be looking twice before you make a step you better be looking twice before you make commitments you better be looking twice why it's a time of such subtility such settlements that's all around I didn't say that to scare you I'm telling you as a child of God I believe the maturity has adopted sons and daughters of God we are evaluating our life I want to get closer to God I don't want to get further away I want to get closer to him right I want to live as the Prophet would say it so close to him till I know when he comes he'll take me rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer proverbs 10:28 the hope of the righteous shall be gladness but the expectation of the wicked shall perish Oh mah Psalms 135 I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and in his word do I hope my soul waited for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning I say more than they that watch for the morning do you realize what David is saying the morning was a certain thing to come they had an appointed watchman that would be divided by three sections as I write three sections in the night and there would be one that would be waiting and watching for the morning to announce the heralding of the morning and David could say I wait for the Lord my soul doth wait and hope in his word what is he looking at it is waiting on God to fulfill his word o my brother and sister don't have a contrived idea don't have a contrived thought but wait on God to fulfill his word many times that's why people get disappointed about the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is never disappointed anybody but sometimes when a person will go to ask in God the Lord Jesus I want the Holy Ghost they want God to come and put something on them but they're not willing to actually die and receive it would be like me holding up this bottle right here it's full of water and it would be like me to ask him brother Richard brother Richard pour some water in here he'd look at me and say you're nuts brother Samuel there's water in that bottle already but the only way that I can ask for a real feeling in this bottle I've got to get rid of the stuff that's on the inside and that comes according to his word and when we come according to God's Word remember it is never a question there is not one problem in god's word that he ever made with any little small claims or fine print beneath it but every promise of God is a and a man and the Spirit of God makes it real in that generation I'm waitin more than they that watch for the morning David said I know the Lord's I know the Lord's coming what brother Samuel what I'm praying for you know I got this real hard situation on my job and the way that I'm praying I'm just praying that you know I'm just praying God's just gonna move me out of the job or move my boss out of the way so I want you to pray with me in other words what you're saying is brother Samuel I'd like you like Aaron to lend your hands I'm gonna give you the gold and I want you to make a golden calf I want you to create an expectation of how we're gonna do this no sir it's God that must be the one we're expecting and let me tell you something the way that God fulfills his word as believers believers we as believers that by His grace have recognized him in the fulfillment of his word we will always recognize God in the fulfillment of his word I tell you friends that's a good you did good good checkmate right there to check and see is this something you're crafting you're trying to make because if you craft it and make it you have problems there'll be things that will follow you or you might be a child of God him indeed and saying Dean well you might love the Lord with all your heart but remember even for decisions that you make that would be bad decisions God don't snatch you out of bad decisions but you will have to pay you will have to go through it and ask God to help you and teach you and say lord help me not to be so hard-headed help me to be a little bit more sensitive help me to be a little bit more yielded Lord let it not be my way let it be your way Oh God well maybe I'm just preaching to everybody else I've done no I'm preaching to me and I maybe I'm just preaching no maybe it ain't nobody else probably nobody may be from our congregation cuz I don't know how well psalms 147 11 the Lord taketh pleasure in them to fear Him in those that hope in his mercy o that's what I want his mercy I'm glad every time his mercy has stepped in aren't you we've been in the midst of a trial or a test his mercy mercy walks in mercy steps into the situation his kindness home eyes the Hebrew would say it's just said his kindness his faithfulness oh his loving-kindness notice here is Paul let's Brignac over now into a time in his life he's near departure and Paul's given a little bit of testimony of God's grace in his life even prior to his departure because remember the helmet of hope of salvation we are expecting the Lord in every situation every trial every sickness we are looking to the Lord not some way that we're looking looking at it we're looking to him is that right we're looking for the coming of the Lord in our generation we know that this is the season of his coming so Paul now thinking and bringing it down to our everyday life because we need this for our everyday life and my first answer no man stood with me but all men for sick me I pray that I pray God that it may not be to their charge notwithstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened me that by me the preaching might be fully known and that the Gentiles might hear and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion it was not a literal lion that Paul had faced he's talking about the opposition of Satan to the gospel and he says I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion notice not from his glare not from his roar he said he had me in his mouth he had me in his mouth it wasn't just fill in his hot breath I felt his gums around it remember this line called Satan remember he don't have no teeth hello somebody he ain't got no teeth that's kind of kitty cats I like to pet the ones no head no teeth or claws but noticed I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion who delivered him same God to deliver David and the Lord notice from this testimony notice through tribulation patience experience hope abounding of Hope and the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom to whom be glory for ever and ever amen you know Paul said every evil work even of what lays before me the Lord shall deliver me and he will carry me safely into his heavenly kingdom there's nothing can come my way until the purpose of God has been fulfilled oh now remember what I just read to you this is a testimony of Paul when he's getting ready for his heavenly departure remember will be read last week when they were in that ship all hopes was gone that we should be saved it was not something where Paul remember was wondering Lord am I yours Drive belong to you that's something right now let me tell you right now as the bride of Jesus Christ as everyone everyone that's listening on the sound of my voice it's a time to know where you stand and if you don't know where you stand you better ask the Lord Lord I need to get on some solid ground I need to know where I'm standing with you I need to know and be sure I need to be able to stand in the power of his might and I'm telling it really really straight now you need to know where you are standing in this hour because you see Paul in the midst of that time he had made that he remember he made the declaration they didn't know if it's going to be saved or not out of that they didn't know if there's gonna be shipwrecked or not but the word gave the Lord gave a word and delivered them now notice let me read here then another part here in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and our hope verse 7 of you is steadfast Wow our hope of you couldn't be because Paul's looking to flesh he's got to be confident into the revelation is that right knowing that as you are partakers of the suffering so shall you be also of the consolation you are more comfort what are the saying I've got the comforter but you are more comfort more comfort comes with more trials because it comforts you to know greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world you see God already knows it but he's letting you know it for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we despaired that were despaired means to renounce all hope even of life beyond what that of a moral man could stand or take Paul said we just renounced all hope of life but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raised the dead you know Paul was drawing upon the experience of the quickening power in his life that has raised up the son and daughter of God on the inside and Paul said he did what no one else can do this situation is nothing from the Lord though I woke in the midst of death it don't seem like there's any hope around me but I can go and stand on this assurance the same God who quickened me that I would pass from death unto life he's the same God to stand and deliver me in this hour who delivered us from so great a death and death deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by many on our behalf let me read this scripture and we'll close Jeremiah 17 verse 5 thus saith the Lord cursed be the man that trusteth in man and maketh flesh his arm and whose heart departed from the Lord if God has ever touched your heart say Lord take me all the way I don't want my heart Lord to depart for he shall be like the heat this is a man who departs he'll be like a heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh you realize a person that gets away from the presence of God listen to me friends it can sit right here in these pews but they get away from the presence of God they get away from from from a personal walk with God they get away they get the order of things men twist it around in their life you know this very thing will come out they can't even see good when it's coming to it even when there's correction that can come to their life they don't recognize it as good you say how in the world is good how is correction good the goodness of the Lord leadeth us to repentance David said I had fainted in the land of the living unless I had I had hoped to see the goodness of the Lord we want the goodness of Almighty God but you see when we ourselves we it's not God pulling us out God never ran Kane out Kane himself willfully walked out of the presence of God and you know what happened to him he became a wanderer a bag Aban and all how the Prophet would admonish us in growing greatest battle fought he said you don't want to be wandering stars we want to be divinely placed has he has wrote his word there in the heavens for he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good cometh but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness you know what happens where there's a lack of water you get prickly I said you get prickly the cactus needles themselves remember the Bible says that when he will come in that of the millennium he will cross the desert to blossom like a rose he'll take patch ground and there will be water needles on a cactus that actually should be better beautiful flowers but because of the lack of the environment but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness in a salt land and not inhabited but let me read our promises blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the Lord is present tense the Lord is this man is blessed let's describe him for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters he's drawing from old and new Testament he's drawing and that spreadeth out her roots by the river how do roots get spread out through tests and trials is that right the shaking of tests and trials it causes it to loosen and it's allowing that loosening up so those root roots can continue to grow so what's happening the roots themselves has it continues to go the god of Hope and make you too bound remember it's moving those roots are moving what's into it it is moving even deeper and deeper it's drawing from sources that are not even visible to the eye but the roots are bowing down deeper and deeper and deeper is becoming more solid they become a Moore's a believer their experience with God becomes more sure more sure more sure they themselves are further grounded and shall not see when heat cometh the bill lets us know he's coming he comes the heat is going to come but that's why the roots grow deep because for the heat that's coming it prepares to endure when everything else around up here Saint oh my goodness I'll tell you this is terrible my man this is such a terrible time this is such a horrible time but for this one who's trusting in the Lord whose hope the Lord is he's gotten resources he's got spiritual food a new season that nobody knows nothing about it's like an Elijah tucked up there mother arrived by the brook of Cherith or glory and shall not see when he cometh but her leaf shall be green it testifies of what life life is present what do the leaves do it is the food making source of the plant it takes and gathers in the Rays from the light it gathers in that light and through that process of photosynthesis it's able to take in that of through the different openings on it where it'll actually take in the carbon dioxide that is out there in the air it'll take him the energy from the Sun and it actually has within it the ability to transform that to actually produce its own food so that it is sustained in the midst of this time all brother aren't you glad that there is a Holy Ghost on the inside that's able to receive the word aren't you glad that you've got a heart that's open to receive some God aren't you glad that you're in the rays of the light to be able to take in the light and allow the working of the Holy Spirit in our lives and shall not be careful in the year of drought neither shall cease from yielding fruit it's definitely let's just close there it's definitely a year of drought it's a famine in the land but those who are trusting in the Lord whose hope the Lord he is they're not careful in the drought they're not walking around and just taken like a little sip I'll just need just a little bit of water let's ration this oh that was a good little drink oh I just rash it a little bit more no sir she's not careful why she's got access she's got access how by the grace of God an access for in hope of salvation I say this morning let your hope be sure if your hope is than anything else if your hopes in the economy turning around afraid you're gonna be badly disappointed if your hope is anything else you got the wrong hope so brother Sena I'm trying to have joy through this all make sure you're tapped into the right source make sure you're tapped into the right source if you don't have that anchor that Paul would write up in another part of the scripture that anchor of the soul that anchor that hope we have as an anchor of the soul which in earth into within the veil if you don't have that anchor as a blessed hope though the storms come but you're not drifting out at sea you're anchored in Jesus the storms of life away if you don't have that anchor this morning you can receive that anchor but remember don't come to him with a bottle that's filled let me just put it down even a little deeper I know you can't see that at home well I got about that much water in it though Sammy won't he come and fill it nope Jesus don't cohabitate you with me come on now you got to be completely empty when you're completely empty you'll completely feel yeah that's the promise so the thing is to say Lord empty me up empty me up and for those of us that he's filled up Lord fill me up more fill me up more Lord that my roots begin to go deeper in the Word of God continue Lord to reveal yourself to me and in my life so no matter where you're at no matter where you're at no matter what's going on we know that this virus is all those things that's all around us all that that's taken place but no doubt there might have been tests and trials that are even
