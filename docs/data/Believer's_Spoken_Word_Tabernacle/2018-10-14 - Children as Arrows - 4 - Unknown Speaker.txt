night with 11 o'clock and I we couldn't find a place the brothers they went with us they took it didn't have no game not gasoline so we had a head back to the church but that time the pastor stomachs were messed up so they took brother browning in a house made out of Adobe he slept on a mattress they put me in the church and I slept on on the floor and the cement floor and they gave me a little sheet of I think I turned to cover myself it was cold it is it the night progressed it got cold I woke up around 5:00 in the morning my stomach was bothering me so I I went they have an outhouse out there so I went to the outhouse I'm in there when somebody's trying to get in there it was brother J's brownie so I just got out of there and left him so I backed up they were just getting about dawn now when I was leaning against a building and there was a young man under and then went by and I said hello just sit there but leaning against this building when all sudden to my right a supernatural being appeared it was the size of a man it was a man on fire I could see the outline of a man and I just it was just like by the time I came out of that it was daylight but the brownie was in there it was not in there but they came running to get me the American the American so I thought the worst some happened so when I got to the place he was he was trying to get up tell them to let me go they Lord heal me so I told him they let him go and I was wonder what was that supernatural being that I see later on one day I was talking about the brawny Hughes later he said brother bill and I was in there I knew that I had to go to the Capitol and preach and I saw the Lord you brought me here for your children it's an all sudden they're like something with hot wax prayer all over me and the Lord healed brother brownie and he went on to preach a tremendous message there in Tegucigalpa for God is a supernatural God I had a I had a dream the other day with brother brownie first time I had it says he's gone and something happened that I was leaving and I looked outside and there was a window in the Oh me was there she was sitting by the table and awesome but the Browning came to my right and one like this to me assured there was so white anyone liked it and he embraced me that was a dream that I had the other day I say this for the glory of God because God is a supernatural God and there's many stories that can tell you what happened to us in Honduras you know so let's sing a song the same that comes because I'm talking too much the singer only believed all these are possible understand or let me just see those things [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh the brothers come take up the mission offering listening Lord I receive more I receive and Oh [Music] Oh

different ones its visitors are those that might be here god bless you amen just ask that certainly want the Lord to have his way and so good to see CH and every one of you we'll just say it like this when you're not here you're missed you're missed so it's good to see you this morning Psalms 127 verse 1 a song of degrees for Solomon except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain it is vain for you to rise up early to sit up late to eat the bread of Sorrows 4 so he giveth his beloved sleep verse 3 lo children are in heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate amen may God bless you bless the reading of the words your being seated I think they probably already mentioned about Lord willing the fellowship at the depot we certainly love to have each and every one of you if you don't know where that's at there in the restrooms there is also the address that's there you could probably fun punch it in your phone or GPS or find someone that you'd be able to follow out there so when we come in here to look at the Word of God this morning I have some scriptures and things I want to just move into here and just trying to lay a background as we're looking at it and we've been looking at this for some time and we've been talking about this of the arrow and how that God would use the great analogy or comparison as children being as that of of an arrow and we have looked at that of the four parts of an arrow the shaft itself the nock and the fletching and the the actual point or Arrowhead that which would kill we know that within this right here this is what we want to deal with we dealt with the shaft and we want to do a little bit more this morning if the Lord will help us on the fletching itself and when you think of it within that of an arrow of how that God would place this within that of a children and how they are arrows in the hand of a mighty man and God knows exactly what he has determined to be accomplished with each of our lives he knows just what he's accomplished determined to be accomplished within this age the thing of it is is that just as much as God has manifested the promise that is ordained for this hour and for this time God himself has ordained that there is a people in whom that promise will move into and illuminate our lives and that it will absolutely hit the mark everything itself will be right in sync every part of it and when you let think of that and you look at it with an arrow no matter how good a material that an arrow can be no matter how sharp and I really don't have a killing point I've got a field point for target practice on here but no matter how great that point would be and no matter how wonderful the knock would be and no matter how wonderful that the power would be that would be stored up in that bow if you do not have the fletching itself the arrow itself can get ahead of itself so the fletching itself is necessary to keep it the arrow in balance to create what we would call a drag so that the the back of the arrow does not get ahead of the front of the arrow so God knows exactly when we look at in our lives how to keep things so precisely lined up within our lives and that fletching that we're looking at is the actual molding of character within our lives and we know the character itself is not something that actually comes as a as a gift to us but it's something that comes through victory it comes through much molding it comes through much suffering it comes through much sacrifice and it's something that within it you know in order for character itself to be developed it will always require that there is humility that's present and when I look at this the very thought that just so has permeated over my hearts which we started with here the last last week or so is that of dealing with unity because if there if there is no unity then there can be no molding of character a character itself of all the wonderful things of how that our lives are shaped and what I want you to think of it I want you to think of and allow the Holy Spirit to break it down from our lives of how that God would move within our lives in a spiritual level and when we can see that then we know how to apply it within our natural lives because remember as we've said over and over anything that God is asking and requiring of us to do it's because he already has done it so he is faithful he's not just someone who tells us to do something but he shows us how to do it and there's examples and examples through the word and to realize that you know when you think of it many times when we look at this or the fletching you know up here when you you look at this this coloration and these the fletching that's on here there is actually a glue that holds this fletching to this shaft without a glue there would be no holding of the fletching to the shaft there's got to be something that will actually unite it and when you think of it when it comes down to our lives there's got to be before the character of Christ can ever come forth and be molded our character be molded there first has to be a unity so when we look at this and the word I want to just take this just a just a little bit further here this morning and you look in Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 because when we look at unity we want to go back and we want to look and trace back and seeing the unity of how that God established it here upon this earth in verse 21 of Genesis 2 the Bible says that the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and he closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one now watch how the Lord Jesus will will continue to pick this up here in Matthew 19 verse 4 and Jesus is asked remember by the Pharisees when they came to speak to him in this moment they are asking him a question not that they themselves might understand their reason of asking a question was to tempt him their whole part of a question was so that they could somehow be able to trap him but notice when they're asking concerning of that of even divorcement and notice the Lord Jesus takes this in verse 4 he says and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and he said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they shall Twain be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let no man put asunder now here as the Lord Jesus is saying here you have two individuals you have two people when you have that of Adam and then here God taking forth a rib out of Adam what he's already created now remember God has already finished his creation but now after that God reaches in and he sees that it's not good for man to dwell alone and God Himself moves on the scene and he takes a rib from within Adam and he begins to multiply he begins to create and here God is making Adam a bride and he's making Adam a bride from his own substance and then you see how that God would bring here his wife to him and God makes this declaration that how that a man shall leave his father and mother now I want to not dwell on this so much this morning but notice it is a relationship that is already there with father and mother and then notice the correct transition of that relationship is to cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh so how can it be that would be we would look at two individuals but yet they are one it's because that same live or that same spirit or their hearts are together in one and to see that how that this is a mystery that even Paul would pick up if I can read it in Ephesians 5:31 and Paul is speaking concerning Christ in the church and he says for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church now let's just look at how that the Prophet would take this here and I read this to you last week but I want to move on back into this and watch of even the order of how things are stated in the message oneness he says now when the first man and first woman in the Garden of Eden was in perfect harmony with God so much that God could come down at any time he desired and talked lip to ear with Adam and Eve and this is what I want you to notice they were one with God they were in perfect harmony with God now that is perfect oneness God and His creation God speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve and they were so perfect in harmony with God till they were one with God God and his family was one so hear God remember here when we find that God is moving in creation we no longer find where it's God said and God said and God but it moved to a place of the Lord God had said and we recognized that to be of Jehovah one who exists with his family one because God himself he exists and dwells with his family now think of this any man and his family a correct good noble obedient family is one with another any family and if there's something in the family that moves them apart then it's not right the family's broken somewhere amen they should all be one father with mother mother with father children with parent parent with children all in agreement and when you see that you'll see one lovely picture it's a key point here that father with mother mother with father parents with children and children with parents you see in agreement and unity unity is not just one way but unity is bi-directional unity itself in order for there to be real true unity not to think of this real hue real true unity is where that there is an agreement between both ones there is an agreement and in order for there to actually be an agreement to think about it for you and I in order for there to even be a unity it actually requires you and I to be able to lay aside our own opinions even our own faults about things it actually requires us to be able to lay them aside and how can that be accept that we have a focus that is greater than our own opinions and our own ideas and our own thinking there's got to be something that'll unifies because our own ideas and our own opinions and our own thoughts will never unify us you might be able to line up with this person or that person because they think like you they talk like you may be in their make up their made up just like you but that's not the unity that God is talking about nor is that the unity that the Holy Spirit produces but the Holy Spirit goes way beyond anything that man can do because whatever that man can do to try to bring everything in agreement it will always come back to one thing it's always man that is doing it and whatever man does dog does not accept what man does God will only accept when man submits to what God has done and what God desires to do and that's where a real true agreement and a real true oneness so when we begin to talk about having an agreement and having a oneness the first place that we have to look when we're looking here at the Prophet is telling us it must be a unity and an agreement with Almighty God if we're lined up with God believe me if we will be lined up with one another but in when we see that we're not lined up with one another it shows that there is a link or a brokenness that actually of where that unity needs to be between us and God you're with me many times within a marriage or a family or other things you'll look at how things themselves can come up face they can erupt and you know what so many times the focus is to try to fix this try to fix that trying to look at this but all those things as we said last week I believe are surface eruptions they are things that I believe with all of my heart that God is more than able and does and will do and fix anything that needs to be repaired and it takes God to really bring a harmony and a unity if not it will last it won't last because it's only as strong as your strength is that's right they should all be one now notice he said that's God's purpose and his purpose as father supreme was to be one with this family earthly family Adam and Eve and the only way that they could be one with the family or with God was because God's nature was in them so that made them with God's nature in them then with each other and God they become all one it wonderful you know here we all come into the house of God and you know here we are setting together listening to the word and worshipping the Lord but you realize the real unity and the real oneness is that Christ himself would dwell and reside in every heart and when he resides in every heart as he would dwell there then the very desire of our heart in being united with him then it will work to unite and bring us together with brothers and sisters of like precious faith oh my isn't that a beautiful picture you see it isn't just enough and you understand this this isn't it's not just enough just to come and assemble we're to our saints of God our it's a wonderful thing I believe that you need to be here and hearing the word of God not just because I'm ministering we need to be able to come together and receive admonition edification from the Word of God that God would minister and speak to our hearts but it's not enough just to be a part of this assembly you've got to be a part of the body of Jesus Christ you can't read yourself into that but it actually takes a sovereign word of Almighty God to come down and actually induct you into his body by way of the new birth listen it's wonderful when God will take care of a lot and you say this person don't drink no more this person don't smoke no more they don't run around no more that's wonderful but but the question is have you been United with Jesus Christ you see just because a person don't do that no more does not mean that they have been United with Jesus Christ that's only a stage within it but has Christ Himself become the very love of your life is he the very pulsation and they put it like this is he the one that people see and when people look at you they can see Jesus Christ isn't that a beautiful picture once again a picture God and his family father over all supreme no death no sorrow no heartaches no nothing just joy unspeakable never to be sick never to have a heartache just one with God what a picture because the very nature of God who in these people and therefore what they did they just followed in line with God and God with them made them one notice the order they were one with God then they were one with one another they followed in line with God's Word they were waiting they were looking God's nature was in them and then as following in line with God's Word they were one with one another who brought this unity God did it was God's desire it's God's desire and God's plan for unity that is God's achievement then a think of this of how that the Lord Jesus himself would actually pray for this in John 11 17 and then Brandon goes on to say that the church we as members of the body of Christ would be one together just like he and the father are one oh my what a union a oneness that would be to see God in his church till every member is just perfectly in harmony with each other and God I say man that's the achievement of Almighty God the very work of the ministry first of all is that we would come to the unity of the faith does that mean that we're always going to be seeing how do I know that's not what the unity of the faith is about but the work of the ministry is to first bring that unity between Christ and his children and then from there then there is a maturing the Bible says of perfecting which is a completing and a maturing by the work of the holy spirit on the inside molding and shaping our character Oh mom what's that mean test trials suffering hmm oh my said that's the church that Jesus is coming for that's when his prayer will be answered that we will be one it's the only grounds of fellowship that God has ever laid down for himself and his church the oneness of himself in the people that's the only one it's not just gathered around something but it's for him to be inside of you it was not enough for the disciples just to be around the Lord Jesus but remember the life that was within him had to come back and come inside of them they had a fellowship but there had to come that life inside of them in order to bring about a true oneness that's the only grounds of fellowship and the only way you can have those grounds is by Union to be united with him forever now to think of it he goes on it says to be united with him and the spirit of his power is eternal life you're eternally united with God perfectly in harmony with him perfectly United together a church that all both God and His Church is one United together now think of this here of how that when we look at in the word of how God's desire is that we would be united with him we recognized that after the fall had taken place there within Eden and we see after that fall that God's desire is to bring that oneness back again and the only way that that oneness can come back again I remember the Holy Spirit had moved upon the prophets Hebrews 1:3 tells us that he spake to the father's by or in or through the prophets but remember God's desire in Redemption is that that same life would come and rapture Li live and reside inside of our life it would be whereby that God's nature would dwell with inside of us a union that would take place on the inside first by the new birth and there's no way that God could do this without he himself becoming one of us so God creates himself a body a blood cell that he might step down and become one of us and offer up his own life that through and by the shedding of the blood that his life would pay the eyes back then he himself might be able to move back into the worshiper now I want you to look at this very carefully I want you to think of this here as we read this scripture and you see of how the Lord Jesus is coming to a moment in his life he's facing the crucifixion he's facing what what his whole purpose of his coming was all about his coming was to bring redemption for you and I whereby the Bible says in the book of Romans by one man's adèle disobedience we were all condemned but by one man's obedience we shall be justified and to see how that in his life now watch you watch this in his life there's nobody couldn't make this decision for him nobody could do it he couldn't be forced into it it could not be something that he was made to do unity is not something that you and I are made to do but unity itself must be a desire that moves within our hearts to be united now sometimes we realize how the devil will work he'll pervert things he'll put things in such a manner where people will desire to be united with people for the wrong reasons now I'm gonna just be very frank with you I want to be united with people who love the Lord Jesus Christ I don't want to be identified with people who believe that he is still the same yesterday today and forever I love people but I want to be identified with people who still believe that he's alive I want to be identified with him I don't want to just be identified with a church I want to be identified with him listen to me I don't want to just be identified with brother Branham I need to be identified with the God who sent brother Branham if I'm not identified with that that makes no difference of how much that I believe the Prophet how much that I'll identify with all those things I miss the very purpose and reasoning of the message itself coming in this hour it was to bring a real uniting between God and His people think the very last paragraph right inside the take cover the very paragraph in the resume of the church age is not for one moment do I bring a message that people might follow me but I do this for one purpose there is one goal one desire and that is that there might be a real relationship a real union between God and His people Amen I say exactly the message has achieved it it is achieving it it is Christ himself by way of his word that is bringing about this union so we're not just rallying around it's not a movement it's Jesus Christ it's Jesus Christ that's who we're rallying around see we're not rallying around words we're rallying around the person of Jesus Christ now notice this watch I'll bet the Lord Jesus himself I want you to pay close attention to these verses now here the Lord Jesus is in John 17 verse 6 and he says I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave us me out of the world vine they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept thy word now notice what he's bringing to the attention of the Father I have manifested thy name so his name the name God's name remember I have come in my father's name so the name is not just a name a letter but it is actually a life that same one that when Moses himself was met by God and he asked that he might see God remember the Bible says that he put Moses in the place he covered over there Clift in the rock with his hand and he passed by and proclaimed the name of the Lord so the name of the Lord was actually manifested the attributes of this name the word itself that was manifested because what does a name do a name is that of a character or an expression so the Lord Jesus himself was standing here declaring but I my lie is the expression or manifestation of that name of the very character of God it was not a substitute it was not something different it was something that was being manifest through his life now this is where I want to take you I want to take you right here in this chapter right here that as parents this is where it comes to then we can have this testimony I have manifested thy name who God to those thou hast given me vine they were are you with me you see the responsibility the responsibility that's laid out here now watch this here in verse 11 of that same chapter and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine old name those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are one now notice the intercessory prayer what he's asking for is our fellowship mama he's not asking that we would be great to grow great preachers or great people or this or that pardon me he's asking for our fellowship now did he not have fellowship he did have fellowship with them he did you know no doubt he had he had fellowship he went fishing with them he had all sorts of time that he was there with them the think about it their lives they were out there fishing to collect in taxes all those other things but when the Lord Jesus the manifestation of the word of God the promised notice what effect it had it drew them out of fishing out of tax collecting did they love those things they did but there was something that was moving up in their lives that was greater than tax collecting that was greater than fishing what was that was it because he had such a eloquence of words now it was because there was a manifestation of that name that life that was set before him and they were ordained to that life but listen now as much as they were deign to that life he noticed God did not just leave them float around but the word itself came by and began to gather them up and what happens they have fellowship with the word and yet not one with it through the salmon what are you saying that even in having fellowship looking at with our children and then we look at in our congregations and the friends there's got to be the word itself manifested that will draw people together without the manifestation of the word we've only got words but it must be Christ himself that is manifest and it must be that life that name of which our families are exposed to hey men that they may be one as we are one verse 12 while I was in the world I kept them in thy name that was part of his responsibilities they belong to the Father but he says you've given to me and while I've been here in the world I have kept them in thy name glory those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now come out to thee and these things I speak in the world that they may have joy fulfilled in themselves mama mama now think about this now I want you to listen to how brother Graham brings us in the message one he says now I don't believe that there's any marriage can be what it ought to be without a union between husband and wife and God now you and I both know I know people and no doubt you do I've got people in my own family they've been married for over 50 some years and yet don't dark in a church door and yet they have good marriages these are principals in God's Word but yet it's not what it ought to be the only one who can make it what it ought to be is that necessary union with God a man can try to do everything ever so right and a woman can try to do everything so right and let's just say 50 some years of marriage that's a wonderful achievement I've commended people that are not even believers and I find out how long they've been Marisa my what an achievement I said man god bless you that's a wonderful achievement and you recognized that in order for them to even be married that long there's had to been a lot of give-and-take a lot of give-and-take there's been a lot of disappointments down through the years they disappointed one another but there's been something that has held them together beyond all their disappointments within one another and that has had to be a love that they have for one another if the world listen friends if the world can have that people who don't even know God how much more can you and I who know him and know the promises can we lay there in the world and say god this is your word this is your promise Lord this is what you desire for my life how much more walking down the aisle does not make you one but oneness itself will be after you walk down the aisle after you take the vows every day and every moment of your life there will be a oneness itself that comes to a place to be manifest there will be times oh my I know I'm not preaching to the choir this morning there'll be times when you're trying at your very limit but listen you cannot focus on mistakes you cannot focus on one another's disappointments you've got to come back why in the world did you come here in the first place why did you accept why did well I accepted based on this and based on that and based on that you know that ain't right you didn't accept it based on this and based on that it was love it's who it had to be love and to think of it that love itself is actually what conquers and what begins to unite before you ever ever ever ever stood here same way spiritually in our lives before we are ever changed physically there is already an invisible union that takes place here there has to be a new birth on the inside whereby that God Himself who will bring forth a body to match what he's done on the inside oh ma I don't believe there's any marriage can be what it ought to be without a union between husband and wife and God notice what he says they'll bring up children in the world they'll make illegitimate give them cigarettes whiskey play cards in their side drink liquor before them no matter how loyal they are to their marriage vows that sexually that's flesh but there's a spirit in there and that spirit of a sinner Papa and Mama no matter how lawyer to their children will come wrong now think of what brother Rams just said right here the such are the things that he says because they will come wrong with not having God to be the center and the union of their life now he goes through a lot of things bring up the legitimates and on and on and on and all those things but what he's telling us here is that no matter were a child what kind of home they come from they still have to be born again but what he's showing you and I is that do within this here that as it goes on let me just read the rest of it he says I know you say brother Branham I know men and women that didn't teach their children that and wasn't Christians notice I know people that didn't teach them to smoke didn't teach them to drink you know what I've said before you know God got people you work with neighbors and whatever more they'll tell their kids no no no no no no you don't drink no no no you don't smoke you don't smoke you don't smoke and they're standing with cigarettes in their hands they tell their children not to cuss them they cuss what are the children supposed to do do what you say or do what you do what's more powerful will I ask you what more powerful God sending Commandments or he himself coming down and taking the commandments upon himself it was a lot more powerful when he himself who gave the word he is the image of that word and when that image itself was manifest and now becomes preeminent our life that's more powerful than anything you can do or say they're right no matter what we do or say it's an image that's powerful how many times Paul would say over and over in the New Testament and he would tell the people remember how we behaved ourselves among you he would deal with them concerning the image the expression of that word and of that characteristic how many testimonies regarding brother branham's life when you have different ones you know from Jack Cohen different ones and their testimonies that they would have concerning brother Branham listen the testimonies that they would have is a life of Christ that was lived among us is that right it wasn't that it wasn't because brother Ram was a great eloquent speaker it wasn't because it was such a depth and such and that wasn't what it was they seen Christ on display oh my I think that's the thing that we have to strive for and no matter how how good if we can pronounce every word if we've got this just right if we know exactly how to finish this quote friends listen many of us that maybe have a mind that could be you know click out and all those things but that means nothing the desire that we would have is let our lives so be blended with the life of Jesus Christ that others would see him in us what's this the very thing notice he says the very thing of not leading them to Christ notice the very thing of not leading them to Christ was the wrongest thing you like that grammar it was the wrongest thing they could ever do besides the other not to lead them to Christ so person can have ever so great morals don't do this don't do that don't do that but if you don't lead them to Christ that's the worst thing you could do well how do I lead them it's got to be more than you sitting down and instructing it's got to take a life that's lived before them come on friends it takes a life that's live before this word this God God sent this word in this hour it's not an intellectual word this is not a word of intellects it is God supernaturally moving through his word to vindicate a promise what is it that got our attention it is Christ Himself becoming preeminent among his people Gideon would have remained Gideon but God made himself known it took God making himself what Gideon had read what Gideon knew but now it took God making himself real Moses knew about God he heard the promises thank God for the mama that was rehearsing him but you know he had to meet God for himself had to meet God for himself so he says you can't have a correct union without it without Christ the fellowship broken I want you to think of this here jesus said as we read in John 17 while I was in the world I've kept them in thy name here he is coming to the end of his earthly journey let's just say as a parent he's done all that he can do he's laid in the word he's trained him he's taught him there's things remember that even among them when they begin to argue whose greatest among you he let him know that this is my kingdoms not like this he let him know that even of remember when John himself when others were not receiving to them and should we call fire down from heaven what did he say at that time he said you know know what spirits are off see there's there's a training there's there is that that it was present right there he was keeping them in the name Oh glory he was keeping them but yet here at this time as he comes to the end of his earthly journey he can do no more for them at this time but give his life I ask you Hasson he gave his life all along he did he gave his life his life listen the very everything concerning his life was being poured out on behalf of not only those who were gathered there but with the vision that you and I and each and every child of God that would come because of this decision his desire was to be united with you and I so he's done his part he's kept them in the name of the Lord let me just put it like this in other words Jesus was not telling the disciples if you want to come to church come to church if you know it's your choice whatever you want to do that was not how he conducted but neither did he have mandates you see it's such a delicate balance and for sometimes and reason to understand God's grace does not mean looseness there has to be direction and guidance for our lives we all understand that has to be God that dealing with hearts and lives we understand that the Lord Jesus knew that but remember even within knowing that I have kept them in thy name what's he doing he's keeping them in the place by the promise he's not forcing them he's not making them stay around him he's keeping them together by the promise being manifested in his life one thing that I liked I was I wouldn't seen a play here back in the summer concerning Jesus one thing that I really enjoyed about that play I got I got a lot of it out a lot out of there but one thing I really enjoyed about it is how they showed his humanity I really enjoyed that I enjoyed that part of it because I see how that the Prophet will it will interject and put those things in there of how even concerning he loved the Fellowship of his brother Han he loved the sunsets I'll say it like this I don't believe that Jesus was a stick in the mud just kind of say it kind of plain so you'll see it I believe that he was one that they also enjoyed being around you understand me I don't believe they were walking on twigs and pencils and needles and if I do this I don't believe that I believe with all in my heart I believe there was a reverence I believe there was a respect but I believe there was an agreement as far as there was a unity as far as what could be at that time Wow there hey if there wasn't a unity like that then they would have never made it to the Upper Room so there had to be a unity that was in that time I find it remarkable how that the Prophet he's asked a question in 1964 what types of activities should we allow our pre teenage children to participate in if you really watch and look in that quote you'll find that brother BAM never gives a list you can let him do this and let him do that and let him do that he doesn't but it's something so much more greater and so much more profound he lets us know that you and I are to be there buddy you're with me right word to be there buddy and he said you're to make your home a place where they would want to come and bring their children now you'd understand most of them you know some of us you know still have younger kids you know buddies with you know Paul's is coming up being you know and Zachary but you know what buddies don't mean that you know even as they were coming along from a young age you got a nun remember now a buddy it's talking about a relationship it does not do away with correction you understand when I whipped them I wasn't worried about whether they love me or not I know they love me because I know my very desire that was within my heart the correction itself was not about something that I ate ated me it was about something that I looked at and said if this isn't curbed out right now dear lord what will it be in the future that's what grill that's what real correction is and see you see even how the the budding and all the other things a relationship it grows it continues to grow between us it continues to move with things you know that they enjoy and things so that you're able to talk with them what I what I'm trying to say is is that the Lord Jesus himself there had to be a unity as far as what could be at that time that would lead up to a unity whereby God himself would come by the surrendering of that life does that make sense oh my let me go on notice in Zechariah 13 verse 7 the Bible says awake o sword against my shepherd and against the man that is my fellow saith the lord of hosts smite the Shepherd and the Sheep shall be scattered and I will turn my hand upon the little ones this was necessary whereby that God himself would actually turn his sword upon his only beloved son that here would be an offering up that's made for you and I now notice God is not worried here the shepherd is smoke and the sheep are scattered but this is what I want you to notice when that takes place remember they're like in a situation of disarray and of confusion they're wondering what's going on but notice the chief shepherd when the chief Shepherd arises from the grave he goes and begins to gather his children together he begins as the Bible says to show himself alive after many infallible proofs he begins to draw them together now think of this the promise of the redeemer the promise of the Messiah was that it had to be a suffering and offering not then the very life of God the holy spirit wouldn't be poured back out upon the worshiper this all had to be and notice how that the Lord Jesus in this time he works and begins to gather them together now I hope you're with me now he begins to gather them where they were scattered in confusion the Bible says in the book of Acts Acts chapter 1 verse 4 that he was assembled together with them so where was a brokenness but now he begins to get them together but what is he doing to bring them together he is manifesting himself by the promise of the word remember he comes to them their fishing comes into the house where they're at he manifests himself there at the garden tomb he manifests himself to those who are on their way back to tell the disciples and he makes himself known to them according to what he did before his crucifixion and as he makes that known them the Bible says right here and we realize in acts 1 this is also referring over into the book of Acts as well era Luke will get here in just a moment he is letting them know as he brings them together so here he is bringing the children back together and he lets them to know that you must receive the Holy Ghost so this promise of the Messiah of the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ it comes forth to unite the people making them ready for that perfect union where God will set down back into the throne of man now think of it they've walked with him they slept with him they fished with him they hunted with him they know all the stories but they're not one now they've got a choice they can either stand around and they can look around and they can just keep on talking about all those stories and my what wonderful testimonies what wonderful things that God did through the Lord Jesus Christ but you see the real recognition was is that they would recognize what God had did in Christ that same God wanted to do this through them what's this in Luke 24 verse 50 well here is this cheap shed chief Shepherd and he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven and they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy they hadn't even got the Holy Ghost yet and they had great joy how could they have great joy well it's not because they had just seen him but there was great joy because what he was declaring to them I indeed I've paid the price of redemption and now is coming the real true day of pinnacles now is coming the real true Liberty that promise of the Holy Spirit that was mentioned there in the book of Joel that same one that moved in the beginning this is the promise and this sign has manifested to unite you and make you ready for this promise to come into manifestation all along notice all the instruction along I've kept him in my name he went to the guard he went to the cross crucified he rose again what is he doing he's gathering them back to himself this was only a work that had to be done to pay the price and now he's gathering them back to himself what's he doing he's pointing them to the promise and they returned to Jerusalem with great joy acts 1 verse 12 then they returned unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath day's journey and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where abode both Peter James John Andrew Phil Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James the son of Alphaeus Simon Zelotes and Judas the brother of James notice these all continued with one Accord in prayer and in supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus with his brethren so hear the word what's what the words doing the word has gathered them and as the word has gathered them the word is also leading them to a place of uniting it's letting them know you must wait and be endued with power from on high but I go unto my father and if I go unto my father I will and by the holy ghost upon you now here they were as believers this sign had been made manifest calluses didn't see him as the resurrected Lord Jesus none of the rest of them seen this but they that solid listen now they that solid for what it was they made their journey to Jerusalem they didn't stay there where he was that they didn't stay and mark the ground and then start charging admission to the ground they didn't stay there and created a little fence and say this is where he ascended right here's where he ascended and they start charging admission and in order to view it that was not what it was there was a greater purpose that would have been something earthly listen to me now they could have got people United around that people would have come there well this is where he United this is where he ascended out this is right here at Bethany right here at the mouth they could have done all of that but that was not the unity that God was calling for the unity that he was calling for was the unity of his own life to be inside of the worshipper OMA they all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication I thought it takes the Holy Ghost to bring unity it does but you see they were already in one Accord and the Holy Ghost ain't even come who how did you get a group of people in one Accord how did they get how did this happen it was a manifestation of the promise that pointed the people to an expectation of the fulfillment of the promise they were not in the Upper Room fussing and fighting if they had have been fussing and fighting the Holy Ghost would have never come you understand what I'm saying people look up say wow we need to stop fussing and fighting and we need to win we need the Holy Ghost to count but first we need to stop fussing and fighting you want the Holy Ghost to move and work down through your home you make sure your attitudes lined up first Sarat we have to check ourselves first because remember it is that rich will invite his presence how many times the Prophet will tell us a resentful spirit he said he will not come in the congregation and reveal himself a resentful spirit will keep him back they were all with one Accord in prayer and supplication in the message one this brother M says oh we've got to believe with one heart one mind and one Accord that's the way they was before the Union was ever made on the day of Pentecost one heart one mind and one Accord what a miracle who did this Oh Peter no he didn't obey me Jacques no maybe it was James nope nope nope it wasn't a man that did this it was the manifestation of the risen Lord Jesus Christ let me tell you something friends there is one thing that is so needed and we must examine it write down in every part in every aspect of our homes our children do not need indoctrinated they might ever so know the doctrines of this message but unless they're born again that will do no good they must be born again of the Spirit of God it takes God coming down and bringing a real reality in their lives and let me tell you something it takes more than just coming around where believers are at but there ought to be a hunger in your life a hunger in your heart that God I want you to be reflected through my life Lord I want to be one with Jesus Christ acts 2:1 and when the Holy Ghost went up in the day of Pentecost was fully come oh my they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it's set upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance this word one Accord it's used in many places here throughout the New Testament this word it's a compound word I'm not going to try to pronounce it it's a compound word of two words meaning to rush along and in unison the image is almost musical a number of notes are sounded which while different harmonize in pitch and tone as the instruments of a great concert under the direction of a concert master so the Holy Ghost blends together the lives of members of Christ's Church who does that Christ who does it with in a hope Christ it takes Christ it takes submitting and surrendering to him notice this is what he does and as we read right here two scriptures already they were already in one Accord before the Holy Ghost ever came how can that be because it is that life of the promise that has been made known before them it reaches out and takes a hold within their heart and there is no question about it it is assurance that what he has said he will do you with me they would never have returned back to Jerusalem with great joy but they were already rejoicing before the Holy Ghost ever come who I wonder are we able to rejoice before the rapture or are we gonna wait hold Lord I'm just gonna late on that day you know because Lord you know how I am really I believe right now when that when that promise is made so alive within our hearts and our life to realize that we belong to him oh come on friends sometimes we let so many other things cloud and take away our mind we let things cloud around and we let other things substitute we're the real joy of the Lord all to me and you know nobody can tell me they don't get happy well I don't get happy I don't get excited I know that's a lie I can watch people talk I can watch how they interact in other parts and other settings or whatever more but listen this is what I'm saying why not be happy and joyful in the promises of God I mean that is if they're your promises but if they're not your promises then maybe that's why you're not happy but you can recognize and become identified in Christ and that this promise itself would be made alive in you you understand what I'm saying that there is nobody gonna dictate whether I'm happy or not nobody's gonna dictate whether I had joy or not that's what you have to make a decision or brother sent me you don't understand what's going on I'm not trying to dismiss those things what I'm trying to tell you is there is something that is greater and to be focused upon they're not focused upon the problems but focus on him who made the promise they were not focused on their insufficiencies Peter was not focused on his denial they went with great joy when they came together they did like David said enter his gates were Thanksgiving in my heart I will enter his courts with praise on the day of Pentecost let me read you a few things here brother Ram tells us he says here we find he says Lord he says you come in this moment you say I just believe I didn't put it up there yeah I just believed you're going to pour out your blessings I'm expecting it now all things are moving right in I'm expecting to see be exceedingly abundantly now I'm expecting it you come down you come down and say well I don't know about it we'll see you hurt the other person now you're setting by one of them and you say Oh Lord just tear him down now just tear them down in other words help the person who might be sitting there thinking that because that thought is hindering them I wonder sometimes if God don't let things be sung out of key just to see what your attitude will be like I wonder do listen friends don't underestimate the devil he'll do anything he can to try to break unity in a service he'll do anything to try to do that to get our mind and our focus because he knows when people are in one Accord and one mind in harmony that God is able to move so there's one thing the devil's not afraid of quotes he ain't afraid of the scriptures he ain't afraid of that what he's afraid of is people being United with Christ home on that you're sitting there by one time you say Oh Lord just tearing down now I'm expecting great things and that expectancy will get that unity among the people so you come expecting I come expecting and as I'm expecting god you're expecting God it creates an atmosphere it creates an atmosphere for God to begin to move but I said that's what happened on the day of Pentecost what brought the Holy Ghost in the first place they went up there and stayed ten days and night until they were all in one place and with one Accord blessing God for something they did not have did you catch that blessing God for something they did not have brother send me I don't have my healing yet but can you bless him for it how can I bless him for it because he said I'm the Lord that he loved all your diseases by His stripes I'm healed expectancy creates an atmosphere for unity but if I'm expecting I'll tell you what I hope they sing this song today I hope I hope he changed this text today I hope this I hope that's not expectancy we won't get nothing out of the service but if we have an expectancy the Lord I'm coming here not to see my brothers and sisters I love them but I'm coming here to see you and to meet with you Lord and that you would come on the scene and speak to my heart oh my then we're getting somewhere oh we sure have a lot to do with the service don't Li we say about stepping back and saying I want to let go and let God have his way but what a responsibility that you and I have everyone goes on to say they was thanking God for the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost had never come yet but they had it in a seed form they had the promise already manifested to him they began to think God already oh my as people of God when God can manifest listen to me now these things as brother Graham says you take it like an acorn he said they that's how they took this promise he said you take that acorn now think of an egg corn that falls out there off of those oak trees you take that egg corn and inside of that acorn is going to be a big old oak tree they'll be leaves come off of that they'll be acorns come off of that and you potentially have an acorn tree you can actually take that and say God thank you Lord Jesus there is a tree that's gonna come but you got a planet and it has to die but you can be thankful because you know this acorn this promise is for me and that's how even a person would approach the Holy Ghost is to believe that it's for you do you realize how the Lord Jesus directed the disciples he didn't tell them I don't know you might be elect I don't know I'm not you know that's up to God he never told them no such stuff he worked with them talked with them even Judas come on somebody you would have been hard-pressed to be able to tell who was a deceiver because Jesus never treated him one bit different than from the rest of them they never ever said yeah see how Jesus yeah I'll say now jesus walks by him and don't even shake his hand huh I caught that there was nothing nothing that life was lived in such a manner to keep them in that place it was not Jesus that told Judas no going out of here you know you go ahead no it was already in Judas's heart but it did not stop the gathering of the elect of God they were kept in his name they were kept there and brought to this place to where that God Himself could move down on the inside friends don't you see don't let the whole big fault don't let it escape you we want you must be unity in order for character there's got to be unity in the whole let me bring it on down you know what you want your children to look at you and you want your children be able to say I want what they've got you're gonna preach with me now I want what they've got it's not the Sun it's not a show that we're putting on it isn't about how much that we can talk it's a life that's lived it's not because we know that brother Rams a prophet it's not because we know certain scriptures that's not what we're talking about we're talking about a life that is lived thank God for the person who was a drunkard no more drunkard thank God for the person who was a fornicator no longer a fornicator but you must be born again you must have that life on the inside of you in a real unity a real union and let me tell you something that life on the inside of you and I as believers and allowing that life to express it'll do something that dr. Dobson can never touch it'll do something that all of the love languages and everything else can never touch come on friends sometimes I get worried that people have replaced books for a genuine experience with God trying to school people into things instead of really by genuine experience I'll tell you what my daddy was a pastor you know that most of you know that but that still did not substitute that I had to have a new earth I had to be born again quoting quotes I could quote many quotes even while I was out there as a ranked sinner I could finish many of them that you could start just from sitting right here in the church pews and hearing her but that did not mean one thing that intellect never held me it never held whatsoever but oh my one day when the god of this word I met him face to face that was different that was different I know sometimes people look for evidences and they look for things well huh I never drank or I never this or I never that so well what is it so how do I know when Christ has become alive in you and effectually living through you when this word has become alive when you can stay away from the Fellowship of believers I question your experience when it's when it's free when it's something to where it don't bother you I'm friends listen I understand there's legitimate excuses but sometimes there's just flat-out Frank laziness where people are not adamant enough about coming to the house of God who I questioned it I really do I questioned well who are you to question me no please don't take it that way what I'm trying to tell you is is that the love of God is something that ought to be so pulsating within our hearts I'll quote our prophet where he said if the love of God is in your heart you can't wait for the church doors to open if the love of God is there with ramesses this is the way that we get it they was blessing God for the Holy Ghost which had never yet come but they believed that it was because God was going to keep his promise and they kept blessing God until that atmosphere got right lord have mercy they kept blessing God unto the atmosphere got right you and I are a mature creators we are amateur creators within our home listen when brother Rams home was all tore apart he had people coming through you know Bill Graham talks about how he had people coming through his hole you know and they were ten I got a word for the Lord from you my brother Ram I've got to tell you this brother Ram God I tell you this I love brother brands response brother brems response to that was is I have connections with him also if he wants something for me to know he'll tell me and this it had such a disarray because of people running in and out and telling his wife this and telling him this and I've got a word from the Lord and all these things and yet brother branham noticed what he does seeing but chaos he's got to unify that home now what does he do does he take up a lot of word no wife you're to be this children you're to obey the parents no no he Gerdes himself you see me do it many times he Gerdes himself with some priestly garments and it goes in it starts washing dishes now I don't look like that he's casting out Devils but he is because remember Devils are not cast out by the strength of God they're cast out by his finger his strength is his shoulder he's cast out by his finger so he comes in here and he begins to change the atmosphere by talking to her about a dress why to change the atmosphere once the atmosphere gets right then the home itself will set right see that's why even in things like this that the devil will try to bring things within a service to try to break the atmosphere you with me you catch that last week when all that sound started going haywire here y'all catch that at the end of the service that was a devil trying to break the atmosphere that's exactly what was taking place I caught it as I was standing right here those things taking place to try to break what God had already brought the people to that's exactly how enemy will try to break an atmosphere within things that can seem to be so simple but we must remember brother bill said it here when he was leading songs today we're in a battle we are in a battle when we come here you have thoughts go through your mind that you wouldn't have go through your mind for the rest of the week and then thoughts will come out through your mind you'll remember to fix something or something might not have been turned off or this is on why is that Satan's desire to break unity all the doctrine that we know that don't stop it it's where we have to say Lord Jesus I'm here for one purpose I'm here for one purpose and that's to receive from you tomorrow will take care of itself what an admonishment that the Prophet gives to us they kept blessing God until the atmosphere got right Graham says Oh couldn't we get in an atmosphere here that every crippled every blind every sick person everything all with one Accord just get the atmosphere right the band says Oh God send us an atmosphere that'll make it of one Accord in one place so when that atmosphere gets rowdy it opens and moves back every clog and the law of God will move he says let's get in he says you know we've got power enough to open the eyes of the blind and stop the years of the death to do all things but he says you come in with a twisted up atmosphere let's get in one Accord so the Holy Spirit can pour out the gushers down upon the people one place in one Accord if that unity that was brought by the promise that was manifested in that hour and it was it could bring the people into a place of expectation and waiting on the promise to believe that it was for them that it wasn't something that was and maybe or a possibility it was sure it was sure they could come into such a place like this now look friends this right here that we read from which started into this this was the early church church age hadn't even started yet churches hadn't even started yet but there was such a unity in this alpha bride with such a time we could say a broad age here was right after the outpouring of the Holy Ghost ad 33 the first church age didn't start 253 20 years right here a complete perfect unity who brought that about God did that God knows what every every Mead he knows in every situation he knows in every home he knows in every life if you can just get your heart your mind just in one Accord just getting it lined up with God first and you just watch how God will line everything else up within the home let God let God move down into the very depths of your life and recognize that this promise is from me you know you might look at it this here this morning and you might look at things that say well there's certain things that will never change but that you never got that from God but with God all things are possible he don't matter how long you've been married it don't matter how old or how young your children might be it doesn't matter friends what matters is you can say in your heart Lord I want a deeper relationship with you and I want a deeper relationship husband or wife less versa and with children together I want a deeper relationship I don't know about you but this is something that I pray for and I pray and I ask God to help me and to teach me this is what my desire is and you know what I can say he's been teaching me not just recently over the years he's been teaching me you know every time that he teaches me you know the funny thing about it is it's nobody else that's dying it's me that ends up dying it's me it's not my wife it's not my children my wife no doubt can say the same thing it's me that ends up dying but all what a wonderful thing what a wonderful thing to be able to die to ourselves to be united to let that life that word live so affectionately through us that's your desire this morning let that life so flow through me or Jesus Lord there's only one that can break the word and to make it effectual in our hearts or sometimes within a service there's things or we can as a minister Lord we can see effects we can see father where ground maybe has been gained father where holds have been broken other times the Lord God we stand Lord Jesus within the same faith and knowing this that your word will not return back to you void Lord I pray this morning that even Lord God even after we that we wouldn't depart from this place depart from one another's presence Lord even later today I pray Heavenly Father as you know each and every one of our hearts Lord God hearts that are lifted up before you I pray Heavenly Father the Lord God that you would continue to move may the false Lord of unity Lord continue Lord to move through our lives Lord we realize what a powerful thing unity is you look down there Lord in the beginning when Nimrod had gathered all most people together and as you said in the word let us go down for these people are warned nor they truly were one they were one around that building of a tower that they might escape the judgment of God Lord that was not even a true unity but that you that right there around a purpose brought a unity of people Lord God how much greater how much greater Lord God a unity Lord that's not brought by man but a unity Lord God that's brought by you Lord Father in the hearts and lives of your people Lord God Lord Jesus as they gather together there they begin to bless you they worshiped you lord they were thanking you for the promise Lord because it was sure it was something Lord that they could expect Lord God they had come into a place of one Accord one mind one place Lord Jesus I believe God that's where we're at this morning Lord I believe that's where we're gathered Lord God we've not we've not gathered here Lord God just around a word but father we've gathered here Lord around you enoyed you have manifested yourself by your word through the power of your spirit Lord and resurrection power that you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord I pray this morning God if there happens to be one that's here then Lord in their heart Lord that all that it is that they're just trusting Lord and coming to a church that that's all they that's all they seemingly wouldn't know about Lord Father I pray this morning dear God that they would recognize there's a deeper walk for him lord I pray that they would realize the Lord God it's more than just coming to a church Lord your God ain't been yet if they hadn't come Lord how would they hear Lord how can they hear Lord God unless there be a preacher Lord God how can they hear unless there's one Lord God who would make himself known to them Lord God I pray Heavenly Father that God this morning that Lord that you would draw them Lord God to that place Lord that that reality what it is that they're longing for Lord that craving Lord God the same God who would touch their life the same God who would call them out of the world the same God who would claim their life up is the same God who wants to come and unite with them Lord dwelling in them Lord God now the testimony might be the works that I do shall you do awesome father I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord God for every husband for every wife Lord fathers we've taken this from the spiritual Lord removing it down in the natural and

Heavenly Father Lord God all things are possible Lord or Jesus Stan Lord God as a witness Lord God I've witnessed you Lord countless times take situations Lord that father by all means of the natural mind would seem unrepairable but I've watched you Lord God I've watched you Lord come on the scene and repair hearts and lives or God that's what you've done Lord God father Lord we believe that this morning Lord that you're the same lord god father we believe that this promise Lord for our lives and we ask Lord God that father for every one of our hearts Lord God that it would deepen Lord God
