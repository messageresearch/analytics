amen as your Savior you start to experience that Liberty even and knowing him as a savior you know what I'm saying when you surrender your heart to the Lord and you feel like my the Lord I've been carrying on I'm no longer carrying you come to the realization that he already bought your sins so the release that you have is where you turn to him as your Savior then when he moves into a deeper place in your heart and life to where you know him as your Redeemer oh that's it's just a greater Liberty so walking with the Lord it just gets brighter and brighter and it is truly the real true Liberty that there is and the only Liberty that there is in this life is to serve the Lord Jesus Christ amen he's the one that holds the keys amen to unlock aren't you glad for that this morning it really don't matter right now this morning as far as you to be focused on where you're sitting but it's to focus on him the scripture never says looking unto yourself but it says look unto Jesus who's the author and finisher of our faith and the Bible says it like this being confident of this one thing that he that hath begun the good work in you shall also perform it to the day of Jesus Christ being confident confidence is a wonderful thing but it's also can be a very bad thing it depends on what it's in Paul said be confident in this him he who begun the work will cap it off amen you love him this morning it's just good to be gathered together this morning in his presence I want to make mention here announcement brother o L Soriano he's going to be here with us on Thursday the Lord willing and then on Sunday next thing that'll be this coming Thursday and next Sunday as well and so we wanted to just continue to keep that in prayer also I know that the meetings that were taking place it's posted on the bulletin board down there with the churches there in Lima and they don't have those meetings so maybe perhaps some of you may may be there as well but we want to remember that as well in prayer and no doubt there's many other meetings that are are going on at the same time as well but in all of those meetings we want to make sure that we're having a meeting with you amen and a wonderful I tell you it's just it's just so wonderful we want to make also mention to you that right after church on September the 9th brother Richard and sister Maria it would be kind of like just like what we would do it it D at the depot fellowship we're trying to you know maybe possibly have a back-up plan if it rains if somewhere we can go but we'll just keep you posted on that but I wanted to let you know of it September the 9th amen so we have a fellowship to be able to to get together with one another and I hope it works out to be outside I really do I I enjoy being outside I don't really like being a lot inside you know there's a room at my house and we looked at giving me a certain room for an office and I said it don't have enough windows in it I said I want the one with I need windows I need windows all around me I want to be able to look out and see my plants I want to be able to look out into the art I want daylight now that's just me that's me I you know I I just enjoyed that so much I enjoy being out there and so you know I believe it's a wonderful thing the creation of God don't you well we need to move on into the word if you'll stand with me and welcome our visitors bless you Isaiah right Isaiah wonderful day good to have you buddy well let's get in here Psalms 127 verse 1 120 Psalms 127 verse 1 you have it there licious bow our heads and a word of prayer and then we'll read the scriptures Heavenly Father as we Lord are gathered in this moment we're asking o God that you would come and be the speaker and the hearer Lord father we just want to submit our lives our hearts all that we are the Lord to you we ask that God that you'll take us together and that you would speak to our lives and Lord that you would you would break it Lord in a manner that it causes our understanding to be fruitful lord i Lord I don't know the words to say I know Lord the meditation that's been upon my heart that I am reserved to you Lord may you take control Oh God and minister to our hearts and father just oh God receive all the glory and the honor for every need that's gathered here this morning Lord may you make yourself so personally known Lord God according to the need that Lord they would have in you that they would recognize Lord and we would recognize your presence Lord father have your way now we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen Psalms 127 verse 1 a song of degrees for Solomon except the Lord build the house they labor in vain that build it except the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain I want you to notice in both of these statements except the Lord remember Solomon was chosen and he was commissioned by God to build the house of the Lord but even in his choosing and his commissioning it had to be where his heart was submissive to God in order for God to bring forth what God had ordained for his life so this is instruction that David is given to Solomon that you could build it here's a pattern this pattern has been given but the scriptures remember in the book of Chronicles it says David gave the the pattern to Solomon by the spirit so we believe that was all of our heart that it's always pointing not to our natural abilities it's even within the word we cannot make the word come to pass it has to be him that's the secret that is within the hearts of the bride amen of the believer to know that it must be him in us to bring this word to past accept the Lord keep the city the watchman waketh but in vain it's wonderful you watch you're observant but yet we want eyes that are beyond our eyes we want the watchman the Lord Jesus Christ then he can direct us on things that even though we may not see it here but he can direct us on those things that even can be coming up down the road because God is God is the same yesterday today and forever is that right it's none of us today God the prophetic is still among his people the Holy Spirit amen so notice in verse 2 it is vain for you to rise up early to set up late to eat the bread of Sorrows for so he giveth his beloved sleep low children are in heritage of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so our children of the youth happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them now remember happy is the man who has his quiver full of them I have I have a two different bows at the house I have a compound bow and it's got 12 spots in it for 12 arrows but then I have a crossbow and that crossbow only has a quiver for three so God knows the quiver that you have that's why you we you know someone maybe that would have a or there's many kids with this many kids or this many kids that's in God's hands and God will orchestrate that between that of the mom and the dad I believe that with all my heart I really do they shall not be ashamed but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate god bless you this morning you've been seated the Bible let's draw attention back to verse 3 where the scripture tells us that children are a heritage war they're an inheritance of the Lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward I believe that we can truly look at it in this manner that children are a blessing of the marriage union between a husband and a wife and we understand that every every child that would enter into this into this life they are brought forth by a creative law of God it wouldn't matter if the child or it was the as brother banham I think the words that he would put it you could take the honorious man and the honorious woman but still it is a law that God has already placed there and so there'll be a child that will come forth because of that Union and all the way down through the scriptures you will find settings and and situations where and I know sometimes there's things where people have been very troubled with things because of maybe the way that their birth entrance into this life and maybe it came through an act of adultery or was an unwed father and mother if you remember I've taken and I know not everybody was here for this but it's very important to hear as the Prophet will lay these words when he deals in questions and answer 64 and he says I cannot believe he says that that the act of adultery that that's a predestinated so as he's dealing with the the the act of how that it would come because remember God's intended way for a child to come is through the marriage covenant but see the grace of God we're in in the Old Testament the Prophet keeps bringing us back to this and as he's even answering the in sixty four the Holy Spirit is unfolding to him even in a greater measure the greatness and power of the blood of Jesus Christ where he said that back there in the Old Testament they had nothing that could atone or take care of that sin but he said with the blood of Jesus that's different aren't you glad because it's by the blood of the Lord Jesus when you think about it the way that every one of us it did not come by the fall then their birth and how that we enter in it comes by the permissive will of God but then through and by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ we have received an invitation then to be born again and to have our character molded to his own glorious character that could not have been if there had not been a life that was given to bring you and I into a place of the new birth that you and I then might be able to dwell in God's perfect will and has his perfect will is working out in our life to where eventually this outside body will also match the redemption that has taken place in the soul it's God's working it's God's glory so when we look at it that's intended the creative law of God is intended within the marriage covenant and I I hope you will understand here this morning and I don't want to take anything for granted but I trust that these are things that even as we go through you you find that how it runs the continuity as we're saying even last week when God deals with things that where we look at in the natural remember if God is giving this direction for our homes or for our marriage then God Himself he himself must be and is a partaker of his own word because he's not someone separate from the word so then when we look at this and we we can see it within the the scriptures here you know the Bible I want to draw your attention to one part here that I believe is very important it goes into and verse four it says as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so are children of the youth now this phrase so are children of the youth it's not talking about the age of the child this is talking about the parents and I want you to think about it within this right here yeah in in it takes strength in parenting it takes stamina I mean we you have to face it that even in parenting there's things that you will do and in reality you might rather would sit on the chair a little longer but but you realize I really don't feel like playing you know this game right here on the table but you recognize it's not about the game it's about them so it's not like that we're without stamina because we have all sorts of responsibilities as parents right now work and all everything that goes with it and so parenting I think that every one of us can't agree parenting takes in energy and it takes patience you don't have to be some great basketball star to play basketball with them you don't have to be a football star or you don't even have to sometimes you can learn things with them is that right sometimes you can sometimes you have to maybe there's certain interests and things that that they would have I remember when you know I look at it you know for many times with your children they'll find that they have a lot of interests that could be similar to yourself you know and yet then sometimes there might be some things that you need to kind of read up on a little bit in other words when we look at a youthfulness when we look at that in youthfulness because parenting is more than just bringing a child into the world it's a lot more than that now remember think of this in the spiritual context God God himself when he speaks in his word and says the Child Left to himself bringeth his mother shame God who is our Father the Holy Ghost is our mother come on now God is not going to leave us to ourselves because it's not just bringing us in birthing us and then just letting us discover things on our own but he's faithful to work with us to bring forth out of us what he himself has placed there within us so when you look at it that parenting is a lot more than just as bringing a child into the world you think of it even in the spiritual context as I mentioned but then look how Paul would relate to it even where here the the the birth here and how that everything begins to move forward Paul would deal with it in the Thessalonica Church he would deal with it in the Galatian you read up these things where Paul would even have those who would they would move in there they would ordained pastors within those cities to care for the flock so they could continue to move on you see it's God's desire to care for his children that's the same way that it is in in in in parenting from the heart it's a desire to care for that child God's desire is is is to continue to move within that within that realm and so there's natural necessities of life which we all know of clothing and food and shelter but there's also a part of relationship that is very important because the Lord Jesus himself said I go away to prepare a place for you and then he comes over in John 14 15 and 16 he says I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter why because it's not good that man should be alone the word alone in the Hebrew means bad that's not God's desire we were made and built to have relationship so when we look at this I'm gonna say some things and it might you might need a little bit of water to swallow it down but I believe it needs to be addressed according to some of these things here so don't don't start drawing up already and think man where's he going I'm going write down the word but we want to speak because what it is the conditions and things of this age and over time you and I have to walk and we walk out there in that world and let me just tell you like this our confidence must be in the Lord and I'm going to tell you if you don't really focus upon it you can find your mind and your thinking certain things start altering and changing and exceptions start being made but I can tell you right now God who gave the word he never put a footnote in it and said this will be able to be done except when it gets to this generation you don't find a footnote in the Bible so we recognize that in order to release the power of that word then then if of God keeping that word then it must bring a faith in that same God who gave that word that our faith in his position in Him who gave the word because if you're if you look just at what you see or even what you look at and say these are the only results that I'm seeing don't look the results look to him every day this is very this is a very simple part within the word but the Bible tells us in the book of Romans chapter 4 that Abraham's focus where the Bible says that he judged him faithful who made the promise so Abraham knew the promise but how Abraham was looking at the promise was keeping his eyes on him who made it because he who made it is the one who bringeth the past so remember as we've been looking at that the word you cannot approach the word that's just a letter but remember that word is God it's an expression it even when you know when God became one of us he took his own laws upon himself the things that he asked you and I have to do he himself fully expressed that law he had all of the that the challenges all around him he expressed all of that humility forgiveness all of those things had to be expressed and they were expressed within his life so God he is he is more than able and he knows how to help you and I to be able to minister these things in the right channel and so I say it in this way when we look at children of the youth I'll just say it's not God's ordained way for a grandparent to raise a child oh brother samuel well let me just let's just look at this a little bit in the word okay you see when you look at it the reality is is that you think about on the spiritual side God has no grandchildren and for all the grandparents in here some maybe more than others something you might be a grandparent eventually you'll come to this you counted ot both there's things you know that my dad who liked that one the hard man but but I believe in correction many times though you know the things that dad we could be out in public and he had a snap that had a certain tone to it I could have been somewhere out out in the woods and he did he did it was like rapid-fire I knew well whatever you doing just stop you know III never liked the things we're gonna have a talk when we get home stop the fellowship let's just go home right now let's get it over let's get it over I think that was worse than the whippin and look it takes stamina and strength because there's times and when we look at even in the correction of our children it's not just something that's a short sweet and simple thing you got to know why you're being corrected I mean does God just correct you and I on you and I don't know well what's going on Lord know he wants us to know so that as the Bible says in Hebrews 12 that we might then make straight paths for our feet that we might then have fruit that would come out of our life because we are exercised within that discipline that he has given to us so discipline is not just what takes place in the little room with the paddle or with the belt or you know however you you know address things or whatever more and I would say it like this however you're addressing it you make sure that you're consistent with it God is consistent are you with me if God said it back there he was against it back there he still against it today he's still the same God he's consistent with his word now I know things have changed and I don't know what revised version that is but I don't know anywhere I mean I haven't found any place where it says it in the word that you know that the the counting that bringeth that bring us wisdom to the child I think most everybody knows how to count are you with me be honest the people that you see count what do you see the result of Lord Jesus they try to make this a little bit I maybe I'll just say this right now brother Dave jr. is not here so I can say it now he ought to give me permission last year rather than junior you know when he was a little guy real small you know for the days you know took him out I think it was in a service and he took and he took him out and you know he was gonna spank him and he was letting him know you know what he did that was wrong and they were telling me about this last week and so I said I forgot I forgot y'all tell me do you mind if I use that sometimes go ahead well brother Dave was it there he was talking to him we're talking about sowing the word okay he was letting him know what he had done wrong he said now listen Dave he said you got anything else to say you got anything to say for yourself before that I spanked you he looked up at his dad he said I'm ready for the rapture [Laughter] hey-hey-hey-hey-hey that was being sown in him we're living in the time of the rapture he knew that the rapture was a time of escape so he had he had the principle right but he just was applying in him for a home but in reality it's just like even in the in the correction of things you know I would say that with a grandparents and things like this when we talk about the Dodie in this let me just break this in a little bit further into the message but it's even of how that you know a lot of things begin to break down and in life and things begin to change I found my dad more patient with things with my boys I never would have seen him that patient with me on it would have been correction you know when it's there before he's like uh-uh Pat just her cover letter and I find out about that years later and you know kind of say this what grace is this but you realize real grace brings results real grace is corrective you see brother BAM goes it and lays it out like this he said people try to make God some big old fat dhoti grandfather and he's got a bunch of grandkids he said Ricky's and Elvis's and there's no harm in them that is the biggest lie the Bible says that there is foolishness bound in their heart the sent like this there was foolishness bound in our heart and what did God do God drove out the foolishness by his word and when that is driven out of our life and he steps in place then you see things change he said but not God he has no grandchildren he's a father you've got to be born again you know you look at how that you know the influence of Satan even as it comes upon this age and it's been going down many things that you and I are seeing in this age they are seeds that have already been sown the Prophet would identify seeds but even things that the Prophet was catching in that time that was coming that the rest of them could not see you find that there are seeds for many things even relationships between man and woman there were many seeds that were sown even way back there in the very early parts of this nation coming about this is why the Prophet would give certain counsel and I believe he was led by God when they would make this statement you know has its made within the minds of the people God is a good God brother brems said I've heard that so much till I get sick well isn't it true he is a good god he is a good god but God is also a God of justice see that's an attribute of him now it's not an attribute that a lot of people like but it is an attribute of him and we understand it correctly first Corinthians 11 tells us that when we would fail to judge ourselves then we are judged of God that we would not be condemned with the world so God's judgment God's correction is not God that he's mad but it's God watching over his word and he knows where you and I are at he already knows their destiny he sees everything out before us and he's making sure that that pathway that you and I are to beyond that we're lined up and we're moving in that pathway God is faithful I'm gonna tell you God ain't somebody that comes in and turns his kids lose and don't know what they're doing God is not somebody who just turns his children lose and they don't know what he don't know what they're doing but the Bible says that the eyes of the Lord they roam to and fro as a matter of fact it says lo I am with you always you might say well brother Samuel even in this right here before God getting a hold of my life let me tell you something that light that would you and I see of the angel of the Lord the pillar fire do you realize that light followed brother Branham his whole life come on somebody even that that astrologer that mad drive when she pointed out there's a light following you is that right see God the Bible this is true this is scripture Psalms 27 David said surely and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life that will phrase follow me means to chase after me I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever it wasn't that you were faster in God but God knows exactly when he's gonna catch up with you he already knows everything is set in divinely plays God knows exactly when he's gonna catch up with you but that said he ain't no old Doty grandfather that can be pushed around and his grandkids don't have any sin he's a God of justice and holiness he proved it in the Garden of Eden by his first children look at this look at this this is something when we see how God reacted in the Garden of Eden he gave His Word when his children stepped over his word so what is first what is first the word so then the the disciplining that the chastening the correction it comes after the word has been stepped over so first of all it must be teaching of what is right what is acceptable are you with me you know it's when things that you see that that that something in action comes out or something comes out recognize when we see that action or that coming out that's a time to instruct and bring that and base that upon the word then if it's not heated to you follow through with it that's not you see the condition the influence of satan in this age let them find their own way that is satanic that is not of God whatsoever that's not a principle of God's Word God's desire he said law I'm with you always he's faithful to lead us and to guide us and and to direct us through in our life and I want you to think of this God has he has no grandchildren now I've referred you to this in many different times but I just want to refer to it today and not read it but remember when God makes himself known to to Jacob and and when Jacob comes to Bethel when he's leaving there the home of Isaac and Rebekah he comes then to Bethel and when he gets to Bethel there and here God appears to him that night listen to me he already had instruction in his home about the Lord he already had that so he wasn't it wasn't something to say whoa what in the world is this what's going on let me just pause here for a moment if one of my boys would have had to write a letter and put it on a tree then I failed as a parent let me just be very clear with this we have the testimony of the prophet of God where he said he said I didn't know how to talk to him so I wrote a letter and I put it on a tree I can understand that he didn't have that instruction but woe is us as parents if our children all right letters and said I don't know how to approach him it ought to be something they know how to approach him and it's not my word it's by that expression in our line they hear you pray they hear you're not just at the dinner table but they hear you pray you know what that is it isn't about a show but let me tell you something they need to have a security to know that daddy is the leader but as daddy being the leader he's being led by the greatest leader it brings comfort and stability in that home and the church said hallelujah it must be you know because of all we believe this you can't be a leader if you can't be led Alleluia so it's it's it's important to this then our children coming out of here it's not about tacking letters on the on on the tree remember the disciples said to him teach us how to pray you see God had become man this was God with skin on it teach us how to pray teach us how to pray let us hear how to approach so that you can recognize that here you talk to him as you talk to me hallelujah you can tell him your heart you got things on your heart tell him the things on your heart if you trouble tell him about those things you see because Satan in the beginning God had revealed himself as Lord God but when Satan came quoting the word he never said Lord God he said God said a far-off one who doesn't understand you but God had already reeled himself as Lord God meaning Jehovah one who exists with his family he's a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities you know that says he's sensitive he's watching his children's watching thing maybe their tone and how things are going he's sensitive the Bible says that the spirit him maketh intercession for our weaknesses he's attentive hallelujah Oh glory be to God hallelujah so it's that's why I say as a parent it requires an attentiveness he requires that no not nothing not an oblivia but it attentiveness my so through the scriptures I'll just I have these in the notes but I'm not gonna I don't want to read him overhead I just refer to him when God made himself known to Jacob and also then again when he made himself known even to Isaac and as God would even speak to Jacob when he spoke to Moses I want you to notice each time God would let it be known that I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father Jacob was his grandchild in the flesh but God was letting him know Abraham is your father that spiritual revelation that has been given to Abraham you know he's letting you know he says you're not just flesh you're not just a child of the flesh of the Prophet but your eyes spiritual child of the word that is the Prophet you see he's letting them know I am your father it's not something ii handed but it is personal that i am still the same yesterday today forever you know what god is saying that he is our father and by not that he's not a grandfather he's letting it be known my power my stamina my strength is still the same it's still the same I'm still in position to raise my youngins I'm still in position to bring forth my children in this age I'm still in position to bring them to full maturity I'm in position to nurture them and admonish them and bring fully the potentials that I see in their lives to past I have that strength it's the same power this was where brother Branham would say is your life worthy of the gospel I referred to this last week but he's talking you know about grandparents and he says you know I think we can really appreciate our grandchildren you said I hope this don't sound bad but we can have more time with them I believe than we did with our children and I could preach on this the rest of the week's just that statement this is not an exemption and saying parents are too busy that's not what he's speaking about you and I both know there's things you know what there's a certain bedtime right there's things you gotta give me you can't just stay up to whenever more as a parent there's things you're looking at there's there's timelines that you said there's certain things hey I've got to be up to next morning and we got to do this at this time do this this time and yet at the same time making a window for a relationship but a grandparent wake up have their coffee they want to take in that they can take a nap hey they earned it they earned it how many times over the years I've committed to the different brothers and sisters have been retired and actually actually enjoyed it not have I have I spoke to them individually said you know what it's been a good example it really has been because then of what you know in your life you're able to spend and have more time with them I believe than what we did with our own children you know everything is not rushed you know I mean is not rush you're not looking at like as long as this game going I don't know right now I haven't been bankrupt on the board all my hotels are covered oh man this close to bedtime half hour how do I the brim said I asked the wife that the other day and she said well sure you loved them a little while turn them back over to their mother and go on grandparents have a have a quick refresh button come over M&Ms in their son what kind you want a peanut peanut caramel which one you want and then we got this over here and then all of a sudden Oh mom and daddy coming but you see true you get to turn them back to who who is really belong that god holds responsible and is trusted this too so when you feel overwhelmed because you do there are many times as a parent you feel overwhelmed even as it progresses through life because of everything that you have going on well if you're not gonna say a man I'm just gonna Amen because it's absolutely the truth sometimes you wonder how can you get everything in my I got it I end up reading having you all here for a long time I gotta stay within the context of things here he's good in me but you see there's things that it does and I want to just encourage you that you're not abnormal it isn't that you don't love your children but it's recognizing that you're letting remember the Lord is first this was overcoming the Lord is first your family is second and your last don't get the two mixed up don't put your family ahead of God because it'll never come out right put golf first family second your last that's overcoming now within that we can look at and see within that of that of the children that there are times that said we get down we get weary and things come along there's even some things you'll face certain things and you're dealing with certain things even when they would come into certain years and certain times but even when they're little sometimes there's things and you're applying the word listen friends every time you applied the word you cannot look at yourself or I can't look at myself as though I'm free from fault as though the word has some error in it we're just a producing that word will produce yes sir every word is a seed of God when it's planted in the right ground it'll bring forth so I can look at it and say Lord there's nothing wrong with your word nothing wrong with you but help me to understand how to apply it that doesn't stop that goes across the board so these things you can look up and ask God and say Lord help me Lord give me strength the Lord guide me Lord direct me Lord do you think Noah didn't have no prayer meetings Noah was a praying man that's how God even communicated with him I believe with all my heart that Noah there are times Noah had the plan before him but I believe there was sometimes no and say Lord it just it's just it's just getting so hard Lord and it bringing these this wood in here in the pitch and Lord we're just warned maybe God told him and said well just take a day and rest but God there's an impending judgment Noah I'm the one who told you take a day arrest the Lord Jesus here to serve the greatest purpose of all time he said to his disciples let us come aside and rest because why this guy still needs rest and this guy needing rest it isn't just this hunk of flesh it's your mind and your emotional makeup [Music] you're loving nor prey but you see what Noah did as he would pray then what's he doing he's turning it over to the Lord see it's become such a strain brother Brent called it like that a strain but he was placing it back into the hands of the Lord how was he doing that by putting himself into the hands of the Lord Lord I'm in your hands this is your message that you've given me I'm your messenger but Lord you're the one you've got to give me the strength Lord the responsibility you place on my shoulders for this age God I need your strength and he said I am your father my strength is just the same as when I gave you this word my strength is just as strong let me tell you something the same God who got a hold of your life and birth your soul he has just as much power and it's residing within you this morning that situations can be turned around yes sir so here this stamina of strength because there's a a commissioning in Genesis 18:19 there's a commission we looked at that last week where God commissioned Abraham how he will command his children in his household after him that they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him you don't know and I don't know we don't know the joy huh I believe that I'm gonna be alive to see the change I believe that but if I'm not and I go by the way of the grief my heart's desire is that this church would not miss one step and my desire is that the children my children wouldn't miss one step are you with me we don't have the promise of other love another day or another time you say what are you saying by that I'm saying that we must by the promise that is given in this hour we must sow the word living that word expressing that word letting it be an absolute in our lives in our homes in everything and letting it bid direction to where our children the rapture itself is not just a term that is heard but it is a term that's expressed its taught hallelujah I believe that with all my heart we innocent God's children are aware of the promise of the age you see we're not we recognize every one of the children that lived down through time they were looking Paul said though though though though though though we are alive and remain we shall be changed Paul didn't believe that he was gonna die he believed that the coming of the Lord was imminent when Martin preached he preached the coming of the Lord is imminent why because the Lord had come in them and made them ready for his coming in corporal body and it was something within them when that Spirit of God moves on the inside you then realize I'm not of this world I am a pilgrim I am a stranger here this is not my home but I'm looking for a city whose builder and maker is God you see what is that that still the effect of that word being lived out he shall command his household after him a word that's been given and the Holy Spirit will always do what come to the word is that right you want the way you want the Holy Spirit to come in the meeting let the word be preached the Holy Spirit will come into the word because the word is the conduit that the Spirit will travel in so the preaching of the word it is a releasing of the Spirit of God to work this is why that the Holy Ghost could no longer work in the church because they had its own with creeds and dogmas they bound the working of the Holy Ghost but God in the end time has loosened and broken those Creed's and dogmas from around your heart because there was a longing in your heart for a reality that was already something that was within you and God put that longing within you a deep calls to the deep but only he could satisfy and because that word has been released we don't have just a portion we don't have just a second step of grace we don't even have just a third stage of grace but it's a very foolish of Christ himself moving into the body it's the word that is the conduit for the Holy Spirit to move in so that brings the place sewing the word is important stamina so the stamina of strength it weakens with age whether you like it or not I'm not called nobody's name in here but I know there's some of you know a little bit older man you strongman and you got a lot of stamina a lot of strength in one or more but you don't tell nobody how many naps you take I won't call nobody's name in here yeah ain't it funny when your little man mom and dad made you take take a nap yeah I'm missing playtime now I wish somebody make me take a nap you're gonna have mercy but I want you to watch how brother branham place is this you're our stamina weakens with age and not just our stamina our nerves too whoo imma let that soak a little bit little bantam talked about he said now tonight he said I'm one time he said I stood in this pulpit like a little boy this flashing red lights was coming he said I stood in this pulpit like a little boy said but tonight I'm an old gray and hair and all headed in stooping shoulders I'm broke down he said my life's running out threads are getting brittle so I move on down the stream my friends get fewer after why I said I come to a place that after a while let's look at this I'll come to a place maybe that I won't enjoy the songs like I used to and maybe my grandchildren the children will have to say don't make grandpa nervous it may come to that if I live I wish right now if you're a grandma or grandpa I wish you just take that spiritual fist and just put it right in the devil's mouth when he's tried to tell you that Oh your nerves are this or that you're a hotter this is this going on he's not the interpreter of the word you take that you take that fist GRA se and pow hit him right in the mouth it doesn't mean that you have a license like see brother branham even talked about this uniting time aside he said Oh God if I live to be a certain certain age lord don't don't let me be crowned with a a cantankerous spirit see he was praying for that Lord don't let me be crowned with that why he knew that there would be susceptibilities within life it's just like when you get old or something happens in your immunity in your system you become susceptible to things but all within that the same God all along that has kept you it kept me that same God will be faithful right there yes sir I think God for these statements like this hallelujah Oh II said it may come to that if if I live I oh my I'm gonna have to come down here and I'm not even getting to where I want to get to second Timothy you know remember Paul he talked about to Timothy and he talked about stirring up the faith and he says in verse 5 of 2nd Timothy 1 when I call to remember it's the unfeigned faith that is indeed which dwelt first in that grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded that in thee also perhaps because you and I can testify to this we don't always see it in ourselves like others can see it we don't see it like God sees it and there's a good part to that in one way because we never want to just be complacent we want to keep reaching forward we want to keep pressing but I believe that it is very important and God knows it's very important that you and I that our what the development of what he's working in our life that that would be something that you and I can see in our lives and say I am growing I am growing I am changing there are things happening in my life there are you know why that's building faith not in you but in him and his faith is built in him what is faith it's trust so it allows you and opens you to yield more to his plan that more growth might come and that's all because he's right there with you so here do you learn Timothy no what I knew to be in your grandmother what I knew to be in your mother I'm persuaded it's in you can I preach a little bit I believe the Holy Ghost lets you and I know in this hour what the Prophet made known to us when he said what God has done for the church agent messenger he desires to do the same thing for each and every one of his children he said we have that access to that authority and to that power I believe that God had a had a representation of a son coming to maturity in this hour but I believe that that was for you and I to recognize that the same God who gave the word and who moved within the prophet's life and how the Prophet yielded himself to the molding of the Spirit of God through that word it will also and it is producing a bride for Jesus Christ but that same characteristic that was ministered demonstrated and put before the people is also taking flesh in the hearts of God's children and that word must be ministered and it encourages our hearts and lets us know this what's belongs to you as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man so our children of the youth gonna be about hunting time in it glory be to God now that was just my foundation I'm gonna start preaching now but I ain't gonna be able to reach you for a little bit and I think God god knows what we need but I want to just kind of drop this in a little bit and this is what I want to start I'm there's no way that I can even fully I'm not even be able to fully cover this in one service at all but as an arrow the Bible says that the children are as arrows now you know an arrow there's four parts to it you look at this day all that's an arrow but there's four parts to it there's the shaft which is this this right here then there's the fletching then there's the knock then you have the place so that the point can be put on there there's four stages to life right there's four parts now you look at this you look at this shaft here this is something is very very important the shaft itself when you recognize this in that' in that of a shaft you can have the greatest point in the world this is just a field point for target shooting but you can have the greatest sharpest blade on here I mean it can be sharp but if this shaft cannot take a transfer of power they don't matter how sharp this is if no matter how much the fletching that's placed on it to give it the right spin if the shaft is not able to take and move the distance no matter how good the fletching is it won't make it even maybe the nock you know you might have a lighted nock like they have now you know you can shoot it in watch your red dot go you know doesn't matter if the shaft itself is not right then the rest of it you could have everything else on it leather doeskin seats and you can have all those things you know you could have all everything just just right but I this all I want you to look at here and I want to just kind of just slow this down a little bit this deals and I want to just focus on this part here just just a moment just this right here this part now you know there's different types of arrows this isn't a this isn't a hunting club there's different types of arrows this is a carbon arrow I'll shoot this thing this ain't one that I've shot because they don't have dirt on it but I can shoot this thing and shoot it over again it's a carbon arrow but you know the aluminum arrows they'll Bend the wooden ones sometimes the wooden ones will snap right so the carbon one you know it it has something within it and the way that this arrow is made the arrow is made because there has to be a middle part right here that's flexible this part needs to be rigid to stay straight this part back here has to also be a more rigid in order to take the impact and the push so there's four parts here to this arrow and this part right here on the shaft I'm just gonna say it like this this one when they take this arrow you know and I went to get these arrows they put these parts in and right now I can't run what that's called your mother's called Bejoy that little part goes in there but anyhow you know the arrows when I went and bought these arrows these arrows were about this long now you say what in the world happened well I had to take him up to the counter and they put me in a bow and I had to pull that bow back and when I pulled it back they cut the shaft based on my draw length so you see the shaft of the arrow is from the genes of mama and papa come on somebody or hey stick with me we work this right in the spiritual because if it comes right back and forth but you see it was based on it's based on a draw length and then they would cut that and they make a cut so that they've got everything figured in with that cut so that the point can go on there everything with the nock the fletching all that stuff is placed there but you see what this shaft is it's the identity there's three parts the identity of a child this age I know they tried to confuse him and say well you know you might be a boy but you're a girl no there is a true sexual identity God made male and female and I'm going to tell you if you just try to put that stuff on autopilot let me tell you this that stuff is going on out there it's going on in the schools it's going on in the colleges on and on and on yes this is not a time for autopilot this is a time for hands-on this is a time that's not just it's a boy I mean you know y'all annoys a boy these are things to also cultivate that it's also very important that the child even know their their emotional identity because you know you other you have one child or you have two child 3 child for whatever more they're not carbon copies one of another the way you approach the one you have to approach the other one a little different she's still the same word it's the approach Oh brother Samuel God he changes not ooh you want some examples on this remember brother Billy Paul sitting in the office brother BAM took one to bury Billy ran took a direction with a certain one and then brother Bremen he took his direction over here and brother Billy Paul was wondering what no world's he doing but to see he knew the motif that was behind it this is where the scripture or the Prophet says apply the token with love and consideration consideration means looking to the motive behind it so it's understanding being attentive to those things furthermore we all recognize that the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not speaking in tongues is that right our sister comes to brother Branham says brother Branham would you ask God to let me speak in tongues so I know I got the Holy Ghost brother brems as a fine dandies sister that's already filled with the Spirit of God he said but we prayed and asked God to let her speak in tongues so she knows she has it you understand God under God knows those things he knows the makeup and brother Branham in that part question answer 64 if you read further in that quote he goes with even how that the devil will work and come at you and attack you on your makeup I don't have time to cover all of that today but he he works within that so it's very important in this hour it's understanding those things of even that of the makeup and the emotional makeup and as well the true spiritual identity but both Simon I don't know if there'll exeed or not shame on you shame on you video you would even say something like that you raise them and you show that word in them and let God produce it because it is up to you to determine whether they are whether they aren't that's the same way it comes in witnessing it's not about I don't know if they're elected or not I don't know the Knitting about that it's about sharing the gospel as God moves on your heart hey man it's a spiritual identity we know who we are in this household we are message believers we are children of God the token is applied this is what the token is not just what I say but the life that's lived spiritual identity he was God silent on this not at all not at all God let Israel know you're a chosen people I've chosen you you're a special people if you obey my word you're being to me a a peculiar treasure above all the peoples of the earth hallelujah God's God is faithful to his word to bring that force in our life think about it does God hold back from you your identity not at all as a matter of fact God has labored within this place to let you know he knew you before the foundation of the world he chose you in Christ before there was Adam Stardust or molecule you are always his even that God would make such bold declarations in this hour in the message future hold you weren't always saved but you must come into that experience you see God's not working on a maybe well I'll come to your earth and I'll die and maybe somebody will feel sorry for me let me tell you something he's God are you that and if we're sons and daughters of God let us operate with that same genus of power and authority we recognize who we are we recognize as the children of God and to know that we're not here by accident it's not by accident that God called you in this hour it's not by accident that God would give you a family in this hour and raise those children in this hour it's not by accident that your paths cross or with your grandchildren it's not by accident you look at every one of those moments whether you've got them in a deer stand whether you've got them in a sawing machine wherever it is you recognize these are moments and parts right here that the word can be sown it's valuable time how do you know that little fella or that little girl might not be that little fella might be a preacher he might be a deacon he might be he'd only have to be that he's just gonna be a real mighty warrior of God oh he might never be in front anybody he just might be behind the curtain praying come on somebody because you gotta have mighty warriors hey man it's a body ministry we're not a bunch of teenagers where we have our I've done but this is my room this is my domain nobody does anything in here this is just my domain I don't need the restaurant we're not a bunch of spiritual teenagers we know we are a body and we need one another the maturity of the gospel breaks down divisions who it's your your jeans so I mean right now say Lord Jesus my jeans my jeans [Music] you know brother Ben I'm gonna say it like this he said you know how many of you stepped in you know and he talks about he and me to stepping in he said they'd look at you know a little Joseph laying there they said meet he look and see Bill he's got your high forehead he said I look at her say meaty but he's got your big eyes he said we sit there and look over say my you know he's because that's a product of our union whoo how the Lord looks upon our life and the angels of God said looking more like looking more like you I mean they're acting like they even rest like you rest hallelujah you see it comes more and more into his image and into his likeness now listen this is brother samia's opinion don't nobody get offended I think it's about the dumbest thing in the world somebody looking at a little infant that's born they look just like grandma also and so they look just like how Norrell do you know that little pudgy pink flesh they look just like something now you might be able to pick out nose and ears come on somebody now don't get offended don't get your feelings all hurt you know I love you but honestly how many times you look at things like that and in reality you know and you got people say you know they look just like so-and-so really really they look just like so and then you see him after a period of time I always knew they looked like uncle so-and-so well then why did you tell that line said it look like Grandma you some people just want them to look like somebody you know what I mean they don't look at house like that family but oh they look exactly like that family your wishful thinking don't make that you know they look exactly like Browning's your wishful thinking don't make that anybody wanted we wishful thinking it looked like Browning's but I'm just just saying you you put your last name in it as well okay might look just exactly there's a pride to that you know and it's nothing wrong with it I think that a young lady she are a married woman she wants to have that child it has a favour of that husband because it shows he's a daddy it shows you there's a little bit of that you see that those things coming through but then there's things a little bit later on you say oh dear Jesus what their Lord in order to overcome this Lord father I pray bring their birth early and I know it sounds a little funny but the reality is is you know in your own life that you have to die daily and you know you had to receive a greater power to put down and override your own makeup and God looks upon us in this hour they're looking more and more you know David David talks about this in Psalms 39 I'm not gonna read it let's stand we'll just stop here we'll just stop I don't I don't wanna I don't want to give you too much say you might say you don't seem like you ever stopped early any other time but this isn't exactly any early but maybe I just had a little bit of compassion in my heart today but I I trust that you listen friends don't don't don't take these services to where you get down and you look down on yourself that's not what the Word of God is about nope remember it's about sowing good seed it's not about ignoring it it's about asking God to help us and I'm saying this right here I'm not just preach these things to you neither do I just tell you these things these are things not only about the experience for things I am experiencing and I have to pray and I have to look to God just as you do and I encourage you when you feel overwhelmed when you feel like I just don't know exactly what to do i Lord I'm filling my stamina and yet here I am I'm in the place Lord where the children are to be raised then ask God for strength don't follow temptation to just release things because I'm gonna tell you if god Terry sometimes these thoughts sometimes these thoughts hit me I don't know maybe they don't hit nobody else but sometimes they hit me and I think you know sometimes when our boys have been away at a youth meeting now sir man I just missed I miss um being there I miss I miss them being there sitting down and talking and you look at a man when they're when they're coming back now mama looks at in a different little different way mama also you know I wonder what they're doing away well if they missed this meal don't get make sure they get it the next time but I I'm looking at a minute is it because this is my household I sold it in the pictures and that drywall this is my house for my family I said Oh Lord you know and I look at it sometimes and I realize if God Terry's lord have mercy if the Lord tarries in Iraq that we might be empty nesters I look at that and I ain't even thinking about that right now I'm so focused right here land I live on ain't big enough to build three houses but you understand what I'm saying it's let God in this time in the season of your life I understand there's times you know sometimes as a sometimes when situations when I've ministered and sometimes been in other assemblies and things and sometimes my wife's been able to talk with some it just the way things have appointed itself sometimes a you know a mama a new mama or sometimes maybe she's the second child or whatever more she was used to having the time where she just got away and you know she just had a time to sit down and listen to a message or read she had her time away just to pray and then things kind of change you've got this going on and here they're sitting in a little rocker and you know you're trying to iron and rock them at the same time you know and you can put a rhythm you know to certain things and you you lay them down to sleep and you're like and you you know you're telling your husband fix that Creek in the floor and it gets to that place you know that to understand the season you're in the enemy can try to condemn you but remember it's not about the position of your knees or your body it's your heart you can touch God right while you're over the ironing board you can touch the throne of God even while you're over the big stockpot you can touch God so it's it's understanding those things so you didn't you come back to devil up and don't don't let him defeat you on that you can pray and you can you can you can receive from God within that you know what no doubt there's going to be times that you will also be able to to slip away into those times God understands and he knows all those things but it's important that we understand that as well because we need times of refreshing them we need them many times are refreshing only in the natural we need times of refreshing in the spiritual we need that we need that from the Lord you know as you come here to to service and I don't limit it just to service but when you come here I trust with all my heart that what God does for me in my life even in the after parts of it I trusted it encourages you I trust when you leave out of here that you're encouraged and you might have a mountain to face but you're encouraged you said I know there's a grain of sand already moved the Restless mountains going it's on its way you're encouraged in your walk in the Lord that's what I pray is that encouragement and who God has ordained and made you Lord willing we'll cover that a little bit more we'll go into this more here in the coming up time I love I tell you I told one of the brothers the other day I was up there running and ran into somebody on the path when I was running and I said man I wish I just hold a 10 day revival right now I mean of course you said well examine if I think that there were all the time the Word of God is so rich in it it's so rich but God knows he knows all these things but let us be mindful and let us pray over it take the word that God is speaking to us not just now but in every time when there's a minister that's here and we hear the word of God even when you hear you're reading in the scriptures the brem says when you read in the Word of God he said before you close it say Amen brother Simon do you really believe or something - I sure do I really do I believe there's something to it you're saying so be it Lord I believe that with all my heart you see sometimes it's things that we look at and say well that's insignificant but you know it's little things that bring forth big things very very precious things God is so mindful he's mindful of every part of where we're at in this life brothers I'm ask you don't nobody take my property we're gonna need that in services to come but that shaft that shaft of an arrow what good does it do if our shaft wasn't right now I know when I break over into the spiritual hill and you look at it brother Samuel my life God bring him forth out of my life now we move into the spiritual side of it there's a shaft of his choosing he chose you before the foundation of the world you and I we are born of his genes ordained that the purpose of life the molding of the character and that our lives might receive a transfer of power it might hit the target that God's intended in this hour he knows what he's doing he knows what he's doing and he's in control you believe that I say lord help me i I want to reflect all of this in my life I want more of him I want more moaning molding and shaping in my life and I know the molding and shaping the reality of that molding and shaping is me dying I know that's really what it is it's me dying more that he might make himself known God's got arrows in this hour I believe I'm one of them I believe I'm looking at arrows God doesn't have a quiver the size of the world's quiver oh boy he's got arrows in his quiver and arrows are in your quiver you know you don't put arrows in the quiver to just carry them around those arrows are in there but dumpin when you put them tips on there you're not just putting tips on there to go out there and look at them in the woods you put them on there you're saying this might be that Boone and Crockett buck 175 inches typical drop times every one you're tightening on there right every life every heart every child of God every arrow of God there's a purpose and it'll meet the mark in this our children of God you love him let's just bow our heads and word of Prayer Lord Jesus Lord you're the you're the great teacher you're the you're the true preacher Lord just spoke to our hearts I'm asking that you would go with us Lord I'm not dismissing right now but I'm asking that Lord in our hearts may you lord the the great teacher continue to break your word to our hearts and encourage each and every one of your children Lord father how you have you've spoke Lord with a sternness but yet you've spoken sweetness to bring forth out of our life that which is true that which is right I pray this morning Lord for each heart each life that's gathered here for every every one Lord that you've been dealing Lord with the heart I pray that God that may there be further steps that are made this morning where they were Lord God were drawn closer to may their hearts arise Lord in faith Lord to believe and to recognize why the Lord in their life maybe they've tried to fit in and do so many different things in this life but there is empty as empty as empty can be may the lord may their heart be turned to you and say lord [Music] I'm trying to I'm tired of funding trying to find my identity would you show me Lord who I am Lord would you make known to me lord god I'm tired Lord of trying to fit in here and fit in there I just know what I want to turn my life over to you because you already knew me Lord to the very stature to the color of hair to the highest of all even the complexion you knew me Lord nor does David could say these thoughts are too wonderful for me they are too high that I cannot attain unto but we can believe them by faith what I pray for every each parent every husband every wife every father and every mother your god I think your father for each and every one one family's right here Lord in the church Lord and your God their hearts were there they're pouring their life no wonder your prophet would say all that was in God he had poured into Christ in Christ and taught in the church Lord you pour your life into us Lord we think of that on the natural Lord as parents Lord it's the pouring in it's to pour our lives a strength more not to wear that we put our children ahead of you but to wear that everything is in its line to recognize Oh God they're a heritage of the Lord Father give strength to that mother right now that's weary Lord would you reach down and just encourage her and let her know dear god what an awesome responsibility but you've equipped her with that Lord you've ordained her for that Lord God it's attributes that Lord that you placed within her life or God and father those attributes Lord God you're there to guide them Lord and direct them Lord bail or she received just that strength and encouragement Lord just even in looking up to you and saying lord help me like Noah no doubt kneeling down to pray she's asking you Lord God Father for daddy I pray that God move upon daddy's heart Lord oh god me may daddy recognize the Lord that it's not only the providing of clothing and shelter and food the Lord it's ministering even to those emotional needs of that child directing and guiding that home as a leader Lord seeking the leadership of the Holy Ghost that father it might be the Holy Ghost leading him Lord I pray that you'll give courage Lord give strength to Daddy Lord no doubt father in this age nor do you knew you already knew it it parallels the time in the book of Exodus where the children were drawing near to deliverance when Moses came with that message the people were in such bondage they were overworked they were in a bitterness of bondage but Lord Jesus you moved upon that bitterness of bondage you were Lord it brought a change of conditions I pray Heavenly Father here this afternoon Lord God many of the things Lord they they wanted to make bricks without straw lorry many times the Lord no doubt demanding hours sometimes Lord is daddy would come home maybe he comes home but there's a project that he still has to work on it's in the back of his mind I pray Lord would you strengthen daddy Lord would you help him Lord would you Lord God don't let him look down or no let him look Lord in a manner of condemnation but maybe Lord very much aware and say lord help me I want to redeem the time Lord help me Lord and within what what has had helped me Lord the influence my family to you Lord Oh God you never intended us to be left alone neither do you intend Lord our children to be left alone but that is bad [Music] Oh God help us Lord guidance directors give strength Lord to each and every parent the grandparents in your Lord the times that they have all God bless them richly Lord not it's not something that they have to overdo but I pray that you'll bless them Lord for taking that time seeing that value Lord that grandchild with grandpa or grandma I recognize it's a crucial time in their
