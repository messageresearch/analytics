[47:16] we'll just read a few verses of
[47:18] Scripture as we before we let you have
[47:23] your seats
[47:27] chaplain just verse 1 Paul a prisoner of
[47:35] Jesus Christ and Timothy our brother
[47:38] unto Philemon our our dearly beloved and
[47:45] fellow laborer and to our beloved
[47:48] Afiya and archippus our fellow soldier
[47:52] and to the church in thy house grace to
[47:56] you and peace from God our Father and
[48:00] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[48:04] may God bless the reading of his word as
[48:07] you're being seated
[48:16] when you look here at this letter and
[48:19] you know when you no doubt
[48:22] maybe this morning this would be the
[48:25] first time maybe that maybe some have
[48:28] read it and others maybe won't have this
[48:30] reference but when we look here in the
[48:33] letters that Paul had wrote so many of
[48:37] the letters that he wrote were those
[48:40] which were wrote when Paul himself was
[48:43] in prison it wasn't suitable conditions
[48:47] it was very hard and destitute he didn't
[48:52] have it even in prison the way that
[48:54] things would be that we can somehow have
[48:57] insight to today but yet you'll find
[49:01] within it that it it nonetheless is an
[49:04] epistle and if you'll notice within each
[49:07] heading that you find you'll find this
[49:11] is the Epistle of Paul to the Saints and
[49:15] kalasa the Epistle of Paul to the Saints
[49:18] and Thessalonica and on and on the this
[49:22] is the Epistle of Paul to the Saints and
[49:24] in Philip and Philip I and you find this
[49:27] and yet within this very epistle here if
[49:32] we can say it in this manner this
[49:34] epistle would be like an audio letter it
[49:37] would be like a personal interview this
[49:40] particular epistle is an actual letter
[49:43] to the man by the name of Philemon and
[49:48] it is a personal letter that Paul has
[49:52] wrote that is also to be delivered and
[49:55] is delivered at the same time that the
[49:57] letter of that which is given to the
[50:00] Colossians and when we look here in in
[50:03] the scripture in the epistle itself you
[50:06] know you'll find in the different
[50:08] epistles because as I said there are
[50:10] epistles that Paul he wrote many of them
[50:13] he wrote him from prison the Ephesian
[50:15] and that that epistle he was in prison
[50:17] when you look at that of the colossians
[50:19] as we mention here he's in prison when
[50:21] you look at 2nd timothy he's in prison
[50:24] when you look at many of them he's in
[50:27] prison and when you look at those it
[50:29] whistles you will find them where Paul
[50:31] would write of needs that he would see
[50:34] within the church were in that fellow
[50:37] laborers and fellow workers would
[50:39] communicate to him different things that
[50:41] were trying to come into the church and
[50:44] yet Paul under the leadership of the
[50:46] Holy Spirit would be able to address
[50:48] those things as well as be able to speak
[50:52] you know and mention things to Titus and
[50:54] to Timothy especially in second Timothy
[50:56] where he would deal with the order and
[50:58] how things itself were to not only be
[51:00] within the church but he would go in at
[51:02] different times and speak of the order
[51:04] among the people and to see that these
[51:06] many of these things that were written
[51:08] it is it is so much of a help the
[51:11] epistles that were written these letters
[51:13] but when I look at this letter here the
[51:16] difference with this epistle that is so
[51:18] much different than the rest of them
[51:20] this epistle itself though with just you
[51:23] know when is it 20 20 some scriptures
[51:25] within it but yet it is a whole
[51:27] comprising of the actual gospel of Jesus
[51:31] Christ and when you think of this here
[51:33] you know the gospel we can go through
[51:35] and we can lay this scripture out and
[51:37] you know God would direct us to lay this
[51:40] out to help somebody and to encourage us
[51:42] and maybe take this direction but you
[51:44] know I think that we're in agreement
[51:46] here this morning that there's no
[51:47] greater epistle than an epistle itself
[51:50] that is actually reflected in the flesh
[51:54] and in the body of Jesus Christ so when
[51:57] we look at this I'd like to speak on a
[51:58] living epistle of Jesus Christ and yet
[52:01] Paul Paul begins here in 2nd Corinthians
[52:05] 3:1 he asked the people do we begin
[52:08] again to commend ourselves or need we as
[52:11] some others epistles of commendation to
[52:14] you or letters of commendation from you
[52:17] ye are our epistle written in our hearts
[52:20] known and read of all men for as much as
[52:24] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[52:28] Epistle of Christ ministered by US
[52:30] written not with ink but with the spirit
[52:33] of the Living God not in tables of stone
[52:36] but in fleshy tables of the heart Paul
[52:40] is
[52:42] is very clearly setting forth that the
[52:44] work that is done within the believers
[52:47] life itself is a testimony of the
[52:51] working of Jesus Christ through the
[52:54] ministry and it's what Jesus Christ
[52:56] Himself has brought forth in the lives
[52:59] of the people so much so that the lives
[53:03] of the people it's where their own lives
[53:05] are actually have been wrote and they
[53:09] are actually read by others you know
[53:11] it's things within of a Christian that
[53:13] for us as Christians it should not be
[53:16] that it would be that we have to
[53:18] announce that we're a Christian there
[53:20] ought to be a presence about our life
[53:23] that says or a Christian it ought to be
[53:26] a presence that separates us because
[53:28] truly it is the presence of God that
[53:31] separates us from the rest of the people
[53:34] throughout those throughout the rest of
[53:35] the earth you know there's things that
[53:37] people can do that's strange and that's
[53:39] odd
[53:40] they think you're strange they think
[53:41] we're odd and because there's certain
[53:43] things that we will do or we will not do
[53:46] but yet within it when we're truly from
[53:49] my heart it's not things that we're
[53:50] doing to make ourselves odd or to make
[53:53] ourselves stand out the real truth is we
[53:56] are of another Kingdom
[53:58] we were once walking here within this
[54:00] earth this world we still here we are
[54:03] but yet how God has touched our hearts
[54:05] and we reflect a different Kingdom
[54:08] although here we are as Americans or
[54:10] whatever nationality and background you
[54:12] are but yet when the Holy Spirit has
[54:15] moved upon our life and brought forth by
[54:17] the new birth that seed that's been
[54:20] quickened on the inside we now have
[54:22] become Express delegates of the Kingdom
[54:26] of Almighty God and then we truly are
[54:28] Pilgrims and strangers this world in
[54:31] itself we realize we're passing through
[54:33] this world if time itself will continue
[54:35] on no matter what age we are if God
[54:38] Terry's will have to go by the way of
[54:40] the gray as we sang here this morning I
[54:42] believe he's coming back like you said
[54:44] we truly see signs we see all of these
[54:47] things around this it is an opportunity
[54:49] think about it our lives that we have
[54:52] that God has given us is an opportunity
[54:56] that we might come into a place to
[54:59] accept him and that his life might be
[55:01] expressed in us God has a purpose for
[55:04] our life a purpose of our life is not
[55:06] that we would you know live and work and
[55:09] accumulate a lot of things that's not
[55:11] the purpose because to think of it after
[55:13] we are gone then the whoever else is
[55:16] family friends and whatever more fight
[55:18] over and everything else but after we
[55:21] when we are finished in this life we
[55:23] want it to be known that within this
[55:25] life what is left behind there has been
[55:28] a believer here there has been a
[55:30] Christian to realize that's the greatest
[55:33] heritage you could give your family you
[55:35] can have money till it's coming out your
[55:37] ears but yet if there can be a heritage
[55:39] of eternal life a heritage where there
[55:42] has been a Christian where through your
[55:44] life Christ has been able to touch the
[55:46] lives of others that is the greatest
[55:49] treasure that can ever be upon this
[55:51] earth so to look at this a written
[55:53] epistle because what Paul it will write
[55:56] here is not going to be good flowery
[55:59] words it is not going to be something
[56:01] that Paul would just you know express
[56:03] that he himself is not an expression of
[56:06] and you know when you think of that
[56:08] there's one word that you and I would
[56:10] really call to mine when someone says
[56:12] something that they truly don't live and
[56:15] Express you would call that a hypocrite
[56:17] is that right you would call that Allah
[56:20] it's not truthful so when you think of
[56:23] it how many people that you are I run
[56:25] across and you can ask them and they'll
[56:27] say well yeah I love God yeah yeah you
[56:29] know I love Jesus and they'll say that
[56:31] but what it is there's certain things
[56:32] about him that they love but yet they
[56:35] really don't love him if they love him
[56:39] they surrender their life to him and it
[56:43] will show itself no matter where you're
[56:45] at it will show that you yourself are
[56:48] actually in love with him now watch this
[56:52] in the message life let me read a few
[56:54] places to you here brother rambles on he
[56:56] says you know life is what controls us
[56:59] we are known by the life that we live
[57:01] and it's been said that your life speaks
[57:04] so loud
[57:06] that I can't hear your testimony so
[57:08] therefore to live a sermon would much
[57:11] wouldn't would be much better than to
[57:14] preach one the life you live shows what
[57:17] character you are because your life
[57:20] always builds your character Jesus said
[57:24] by their fruit you shall know them so no
[57:26] matter what we would say or how many how
[57:29] much we would testify if our lives
[57:31] doesn't coincide with the testimony we
[57:34] are doing the kingdom of God and in debt
[57:37] meant by giving that testimony because
[57:39] people know what we are Liu bang goes on
[57:43] to say this here and I'd say that no
[57:45] doubt many of us have been in these
[57:46] situations I have often thought of a
[57:49] funeral service to hear a man preach the
[57:51] funeral of some person that had lived
[57:54] ungodly and had never done anything
[57:56] right and yet preaches though they were
[57:59] a great person that had gone right on to
[58:01] heaven no matter what you ever say the
[58:04] people already has their minds made up
[58:06] by the life that character has left
[58:09] behind and he said I think that of
[58:11] longfellow right here when he said
[58:12] partings leave behind his footprints on
[58:15] the sands of time
[58:16] that's the Psalms of life now brother
[58:18] Graham goes on here in in hidden life
[58:20] with Christ he said you know the best
[58:22] thing is to live a sermon instead of
[58:24] preach one you know that your written
[58:26] epistle and you can't do it in yourself
[58:29] you can impersonate it for a little
[58:31] while but your sins will find you out
[58:34] that's true isn't it you cannot live
[58:37] this the Christian life it's not
[58:38] something that you are I come to and say
[58:40] I'm gonna lay hold on it and I'm gonna
[58:42] live it you can't live it it has to be
[58:45] him live it through you there are
[58:48] wonderful principles within God's Word
[58:51] that even sitting under that word
[58:53] hearing that word that you can live to a
[58:56] level of sanctification where it'll
[58:58] actually preserve you from a lot of harm
[59:00] but yet there's still that struggle
[59:02] that's there and it's not a real true
[59:05] expression of Jesus Christ you see the
[59:07] life that was within the Lord Jesus
[59:09] remember here he himself was the
[59:12] fulfillment of the Old Testament but out
[59:15] of the old
[59:15] testament once that is fulfilled the
[59:17] life that was in Jeremiah Isaiah so
[59:20] forth on down remember through and by
[59:22] the giving of his life the shedding of
[59:25] his blood then would come forth the life
[59:27] that was within that blood cell that the
[59:29] very New Testament might be written and
[59:32] the New Testament is not words out here
[59:35] and a life over here but the New
[59:37] Testament itself is the very life of
[59:40] Jesus Christ now that the body was
[59:43] received back up to the minute Oriole
[59:45] seed of God as a witness and a testimony
[59:48] and then to send down the Holy Spirit
[59:50] that same life what does it do
[59:52] it actually writes and expresses that
[59:55] same life in the actions and everything
[59:58] of the believer so it is a New Testament
[1:00:01] now look he says you can't do it in
[1:00:04] yourself you can impersonate it for a
[1:00:06] little while but your sins will find you
[1:00:08] out
[1:00:09] you better just consecrate yourself to
[1:00:11] God and get on the inside shut the doors
[1:00:14] behind you and burn every barrier there
[1:00:17] is behind you in every bridge and launch
[1:00:19] out it's like a person says well I'm
[1:00:21] gonna wait for God to take it really I
[1:00:24] know it has to be God to take it but the
[1:00:26] point is are you ready to die if you're
[1:00:29] not ready to die God will never force
[1:00:31] fully take anything he wants to be our
[1:00:35] Lord he wants us to surrender our lives
[1:00:37] to him he does not know the real reality
[1:00:41] of Christianity it's not a dictatorship
[1:00:43] it's not where we serve Him under fear
[1:00:46] that is not it at all but it's actually
[1:00:48] where the love of God is made manifest
[1:00:50] that captures our heart to word that
[1:00:53] what we do we do because we love the
[1:00:56] Lord it doesn't matter where we're at we
[1:00:58] reflect that that we love the Lord Jesus
[1:01:01] Christ now look at this he goes on to
[1:01:03] say he says to burn every barrier that
[1:01:06] is behind you every bridge and launch
[1:01:08] out I know it's the truth
[1:01:09] I know it'll work if it hadn't been for
[1:01:11] that I don't know what would have become
[1:01:13] of me now he says but it ain't the
[1:01:15] people you look at then it's Christ in
[1:01:17] the message so brother BAM says when man
[1:01:20] see you living like him when he sees
[1:01:23] your character and your conduct with the
[1:01:26] word just exact
[1:01:28] like he was the word being manifested
[1:01:31] then man will see Jesus Christ they
[1:01:35] won't have to look around anywhere else
[1:01:37] what does this creep teach and what does
[1:01:39] that pre teach they'll know what God is
[1:01:41] when they see you in the Hebrews chapter
[1:01:47] 1 part 2 notice or chapter 2 part 1 he
[1:01:50] speaks of how Elijah and the fire
[1:01:52] falling there on the mountain and he
[1:01:54] says God always bears witness your life
[1:01:58] will bear witness I don't know what your
[1:02:01] testimony is but your life speaks so
[1:02:04] loud your voice can't be heard you're
[1:02:07] living your everyday life will testify
[1:02:10] what you are God bears witness your
[1:02:13] everyday live will testify what you are
[1:02:17] so a person a every one of us know right
[1:02:20] now and this is not putting anybody down
[1:02:21] but you you every one of us know people
[1:02:24] whether its family or whether it's
[1:02:26] people you work with they testify being
[1:02:29] a Christian but yet all it is is
[1:02:31] something they put on and when after
[1:02:33] service is over they've done their
[1:02:35] religion for the week and it shows it's
[1:02:37] religion they hang it up there's no
[1:02:39] power in their life there's no love
[1:02:42] affair to live for him in the face of
[1:02:44] all persecution in the face of what's
[1:02:47] taking place on the job there is no love
[1:02:50] affair it is no more than just religion
[1:02:53] and I'll say it very clearly God did not
[1:02:56] come to bring religion to you and I he
[1:02:58] does not matter of fact God hates
[1:03:00] religion he does not love religion as I
[1:03:04] told a man one time you know the man was
[1:03:06] an atheist and I said I'll tell you
[1:03:07] right now religion is not of God
[1:03:10] religion is man-made it is man I said
[1:03:14] you know I've wanted to the man I said
[1:03:15] look you tell me within this of religion
[1:03:17] you know people that have said certain
[1:03:20] things they've mentioned this and
[1:03:21] mentioned that and then look at the life
[1:03:23] that they live you mean to tell me that
[1:03:25] God does that and God produces that and
[1:03:27] the man you know was just standing there
[1:03:29] just startled and I said but sir I want
[1:03:31] to tell you now this was something that
[1:03:33] the Lord moved down with in that place
[1:03:35] and I said sir I want to tell you
[1:03:36] something you asked me how that my life
[1:03:39] had been changed and how
[1:03:40] different things had taken place I said
[1:03:42] sir that same pillar fire that same Lord
[1:03:45] God that's mentioned there in the
[1:03:47] scriptures that same God came down and
[1:03:50] did a work in my life it was nothing I
[1:03:54] had to quit it's what he himself came in
[1:03:57] and dead and there is a love affair of
[1:04:00] the Living God I said as a matter of
[1:04:02] fact I said you've heard of joke haven't
[1:04:04] you
[1:04:04] he said yeah I've heard you know
[1:04:06] something to that matter I said well let
[1:04:08] me tell you something that same God that
[1:04:10] was veiled in that whirlwind it's right
[1:04:12] here standing in this lobby right now I
[1:04:15] never would have said that if I couldn't
[1:04:16] have felt his presence but his presence
[1:04:18] came in and that man he just humbled all
[1:04:21] around he left his book he left his
[1:04:23] coffee mug I had to run out of the place
[1:04:25] and give it back to him said hey here's
[1:04:27] your book here's your coffee mug the
[1:04:30] presence of God had come there in such a
[1:04:33] way you see friends theology itself it's
[1:04:36] never by theologians of the Lord as a
[1:04:40] matter of fact brother man tells us in
[1:04:42] Christ the mystery it is not government
[1:04:44] it is not the government of Christianity
[1:04:47] that we make converts by do this don't
[1:04:49] do that do this don't do that that can
[1:04:51] produce good moral people which thank
[1:04:54] God for but it is not that which
[1:04:56] produces the new birth
[1:04:58] I'm afraid so many times people live in
[1:05:01] a level of sanctification and they've
[1:05:02] never been born again they look at and
[1:05:05] say well I used to do this and I used to
[1:05:07] do that and I don't do it no more but
[1:05:09] yet they have no love affair with the
[1:05:11] Lord outside of church you know the word
[1:05:15] itself outside of church
[1:05:17] there's no life there's no prayer life
[1:05:19] there's no giving them themselves to the
[1:05:21] Lord I hate to say it but it don't look
[1:05:24] like there's a real experience there at
[1:05:26] all because when there's a real
[1:05:27] experience with God how in the world can
[1:05:30] you stay away from him how can you stay
[1:05:33] away from prayer how can you stay away
[1:05:35] from the word how can you stay away from
[1:05:37] church with so flimsy little excuses how
[1:05:41] can you do that and when Christ himself
[1:05:43] would be alive in your life I'll tell
[1:05:45] you brother and sister we need to go
[1:05:47] deeper
[1:05:50] it's got to be a deeper life now look at
[1:05:55] this here there is one thing that how
[1:05:58] then it would be mentioned within our
[1:06:00] lives a seal that would show coming and
[1:06:02] going so I believe within our hearts as
[1:06:05] believers though the real desire that
[1:06:07] would Paul say to emanate from our
[1:06:09] hearts we want to see Jesus Christ
[1:06:11] reflected in our lives I mean I've never
[1:06:15] I've never known you know a woman she
[1:06:17] might have married the ugliest guy in
[1:06:19] the world but you know what she wants
[1:06:21] that baby to look like him there'd be
[1:06:24] characteristics what it tells who she's
[1:06:26] been with are you with me
[1:06:28] it bears those reflections and that's
[1:06:31] exactly where the desire within our
[1:06:33] heart gets not asked that we want to see
[1:06:35] glorified we want to see him glorified
[1:06:38] we want to see him exalted him lifted up
[1:06:41] you know it's those things that we thank
[1:06:44] God for testimonies thank God for moving
[1:06:46] on the scene healing the six
[1:06:48] transforming lives and to see that
[1:06:50] reflection in our lives
[1:06:51] you realize sometimes there's people at
[1:06:53] work they'll never themselves witness
[1:06:56] that of the healing or a miracle but yet
[1:06:58] there is a presence about your life that
[1:07:01] is becoming to listen to me like it was
[1:07:04] in Luke 15 one where those of the
[1:07:06] sinners actually came near to Jesus so
[1:07:09] Jesus did not have the Spirit of God in
[1:07:11] him was not an all of life I'm holier
[1:07:14] than you you cannot come near me you
[1:07:17] might pollute me that was not the order
[1:07:19] of the Spirit of God in his life as a
[1:07:22] matter of fact it was a car quite the
[1:07:24] contrary the reality in his life is what
[1:07:28] drew sinners and publicans they came to
[1:07:31] hear him I'll tell you right now that's
[1:07:33] the greatest thing that's the greatest
[1:07:35] drawing card is a life that's lived
[1:07:38] sometimes you can't even get any inroads
[1:07:40] with anybody until a life has been lived
[1:07:44] there's got to be a life that's been
[1:07:46] lived the presence of the Living God
[1:07:48] it's gone forth from our life now think
[1:07:52] of this here Paul would speak in
[1:07:55] Philippians 3:10 let me just refer to
[1:07:58] these verses real quick in verse 10 that
[1:08:00] I may know him
[1:08:02] and the power of his resurrection and
[1:08:04] the Fellowship of his sufferings being
[1:08:08] made conformable unto his death if by
[1:08:12] any means I might attain unto the
[1:08:15] resurrection of the Dead
[1:08:17] it's a faithful saying Paul would ruin
[1:08:20] Paul would speak up in another place a
[1:08:22] faithful saying if we do not reign with
[1:08:25] him if we do not suffer with him we will
[1:08:27] not reign with him see to suffer it's
[1:08:30] entering in to his suffering not just
[1:08:33] the sufferings we go through but to
[1:08:35] actually be made a partaker of that
[1:08:37] vicarious suffering of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:39] Christ by that of the new birth where we
[1:08:41] and ourselves are made partakers of that
[1:08:45] life and this is what Paul is expressing
[1:08:47] here now it's very much like that of a
[1:08:49] marriage so when we see it if we don't
[1:08:51] suffer with him we will not reign with
[1:08:54] him there had to be suffering as we
[1:08:58] looked at last week there had to be a
[1:09:01] submissive life a life that even in the
[1:09:05] midst of tests and trials that it was
[1:09:08] submitted fully to Almighty God now look
[1:09:13] at this you know when we think of it in
[1:09:15] even in our own lives and to see how
[1:09:18] that we need the grace of God to go
[1:09:21] through tests and trials there's not one
[1:09:24] of us here that would actually ask and
[1:09:26] say I need a test I need a trial there's
[1:09:28] not one of us that would ask that
[1:09:30] because we realize that tests and trials
[1:09:33] they are appointed of God even that of
[1:09:36] persecutions and reproaches and how the
[1:09:39] many different various ways that it will
[1:09:40] come you realize that there is a time
[1:09:42] that for a person when God can deal with
[1:09:45] their life for the young or whether old
[1:09:47] and it comes to a place that they wonder
[1:09:49] how am I going to face people on the job
[1:09:51] how am I going to face my family you see
[1:09:53] what stands out to them they realize if
[1:09:55] I submit and surrender to this what is
[1:09:58] my family going to think what is my
[1:10:00] co-workers gonna think they're looking
[1:10:02] at it and they're saying how is this
[1:10:04] gonna happen but you see when it can
[1:10:06] come to a place that by God's grace that
[1:10:09] that individual is able to look beyond
[1:10:12] all the persecution look beyond all the
[1:10:14] reproach
[1:10:14] and although what if I do this or how do
[1:10:16] I do this or how do I do that
[1:10:18] when they're able to look beyond that
[1:10:19] and come to such a place to where it is
[1:10:22] the love of God being projected and
[1:10:24] they're taking that in it becomes to a
[1:10:27] place that the persecutions and
[1:10:28] reproaches no longer make a difference
[1:10:31] they themselves are being swept away
[1:10:33] anybody got a witness in here this
[1:10:35] morning where it moves in your heart
[1:10:37] like that to where it no longer the
[1:10:39] focus is reproach the focus is no longer
[1:10:42] persecution but it actually becomes on
[1:10:44] serving the Lord it doesn't matter what
[1:10:47] it's going to cost us we our desire is
[1:10:49] to serve Him now to think of this even
[1:10:51] within trials here we need His grace we
[1:10:55] need it as we said last week when Paul
[1:10:59] said I will glory in my infirmities you
[1:11:02] do you realize within it glory in the
[1:11:04] infirmities within itself you know it's
[1:11:06] how that God will continue to teach us
[1:11:08] and direct us and help us that we might
[1:11:11] be christ-like in suffering and how that
[1:11:13] to be able to submit ourselves to
[1:11:15] subject to that test or trial knowing
[1:11:18] that God is molding and he's making us
[1:11:20] in our life now when you you think of
[1:11:22] this here you know blurring in our
[1:11:24] infirmities as we've looked at it it
[1:11:26] deals with how that God Himself you know
[1:11:28] with through the midst of the time and
[1:11:30] isn't of how much scripture we can quote
[1:11:32] it isn't how many quotes we can quote
[1:11:34] you know and with the way that I look at
[1:11:36] it is that you might say what does it
[1:11:37] say me this is you okay maybe it is me
[1:11:39] but when I look at it that somebody
[1:11:41] would text me or call me and they say
[1:11:43] brother Samuel I'm praying for you I
[1:11:45] don't need to return around and show my
[1:11:47] spirituality and quote scriptures and
[1:11:48] quote quotes to man the only thing I can
[1:11:50] do and the greatest thing is say thank
[1:11:52] you I appreciate that because you know
[1:11:54] what I'm in need I need that prayer if
[1:11:58] God put my name upon your heart thank
[1:12:01] God hold me up in prayer you don't know
[1:12:06] what that need might be here might be
[1:12:07] something to where that is being looked
[1:12:09] at right here in the world and I'm
[1:12:12] looking to God what direction do I go
[1:12:14] with this Lord how how do I move within
[1:12:16] this sometimes it'll be a pause for day
[1:12:18] we don't know what that is but the
[1:12:20] greatest thing that we can do friends is
[1:12:22] be able to just say thank you
[1:12:24] go ever tried to encourage some people
[1:12:27] and you try to encourage them and you
[1:12:30] realize oh that's what that thing again
[1:12:36] mm ah the only one that's experienced
[1:12:39] that sometimes you know you with a
[1:12:43] person you know where you know something
[1:12:46] has happened one time I never forget
[1:12:47] with an individual you know a person
[1:12:49] that had happened and you know you know
[1:12:50] where it's something had where there was
[1:12:51] one who had lost you know there have
[1:12:53] been a miscarriage within I think a
[1:12:55] month or whatever more and you know
[1:12:56] within that time you know it's my wife
[1:12:58] or what does she spoke up and she said I
[1:13:00] all she said but you know what she said
[1:13:02] God he is so faithful
[1:13:03] now the person we smoked right back at
[1:13:05] that time and said how would you know
[1:13:08] how would you know huh because we
[1:13:12] experienced it we experienced that but
[1:13:18] whether we experienced it or not God is
[1:13:21] faithful you understand what I'm saying
[1:13:23] it's to make ourselves in a way say God
[1:13:26] help me I I know friends listen to me
[1:13:28] God's not interested in us being cookie
[1:13:30] cutter carbon copies I understand we are
[1:13:33] all made up differently I understand
[1:13:35] that but I want to be me personally I
[1:13:37] want to be in such a place I can say
[1:13:40] thank you and just receive it as from
[1:13:43] the Lord I don't need you to give me
[1:13:47] certifications and say let me go down to
[1:13:49] the file cabinet and let me prove to you
[1:13:51] I've been through this and then
[1:13:55] sometimes people wonder well why don't
[1:13:57] people come and encourage me I wonder I
[1:14:01] know this is simple but we need His
[1:14:05] grace remember how brother Branham here
[1:14:09] he was he was speaking you know to the
[1:14:11] Lord and remember the Lord spoke to him
[1:14:12] about his trials and said are you trying
[1:14:14] to bypass him he said oh Lord
[1:14:19] no Lord take me through he would say in
[1:14:24] another place the Lord
[1:14:25] don't take the tests and trials from me
[1:14:27] but give me your grace to go through him
[1:14:31] there's the purpose within it all of the
[1:14:35] tests and all the trial there is a great
[1:14:37] purpose
[1:14:37] within it and he himself he promised he
[1:14:40] will be our escape he will be our refuge
[1:14:44] he will be our help our strength to be
[1:14:47] able to endure it the Bible says he will
[1:14:50] not allow a temptation to come our way
[1:14:52] but what he himself will make a way of
[1:14:55] escape that we might be able to bear it
[1:14:58] to endure it he makes a way so that he
[1:15:01] permits the tester trial and then he
[1:15:04] gives the strength but you and I might
[1:15:06] be able to escape to bear it in the
[1:15:10] midst of that time the escaping of it
[1:15:14] isn't always getting isn't getting out
[1:15:16] of it but God can provide some
[1:15:19] refreshment in the meantime he can
[1:15:22] provide some palm trees or Lord to rise
[1:15:24] up that'll give you some refreshment
[1:15:26] there now to think of this you know
[1:15:28] through the midst of it when we come
[1:15:31] back here to this scripture in the
[1:15:33] opening of our text in Philemon and look
[1:15:37] at how that hid this the scripture is
[1:15:39] recorded Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:15:43] you know what a person will say well
[1:15:45] also many times speak and tell of their
[1:15:47] thought life what they're thinking on
[1:15:50] what their dwelling on how is it when we
[1:15:54] you know maybe would get together in
[1:15:56] certain things you know that could be
[1:15:57] shared certain things that we're
[1:15:59] meditating on when we might begin to
[1:16:01] fellowship about the word and there's
[1:16:03] certain things maybe we've been
[1:16:04] meditating on and just you know putting
[1:16:06] before the Lord things that we've been
[1:16:07] thinking on now when you think of this
[1:16:10] Paul in listen here Paul himself wrote
[1:16:12] very much about the fault line of how
[1:16:14] that were to you know our thoughts think
[1:16:16] on these things and he would write
[1:16:17] bringing every thought into captivity
[1:16:19] Paul would write of that but to think of
[1:16:21] it Paul was not writing those things
[1:16:23] from an ivory tower he was writing it
[1:16:28] with rats around him he was writing that
[1:16:32] were there you know was just a stench in
[1:16:34] that sail to where he's tied up and yet
[1:16:37] in the midst of it Paul would admonish
[1:16:39] how is he able to do this he knew it by
[1:16:42] experience not to think of that by that
[1:16:46] experience that Paul went through he was
[1:16:49] able
[1:16:49] to submit himself how could he do this
[1:16:52] he was receiving from the Lord even in
[1:16:56] this time that he might be able to give
[1:16:58] back and encourage your eye that was not
[1:17:01] Paul the man doing that but God had
[1:17:03] allowed the circumstances to be as it
[1:17:07] were that Paul himself could actually
[1:17:09] now with the sympathy of Christ pouring
[1:17:12] through his life being able to minister
[1:17:15] to the rest of the saints of the Living
[1:17:17] God
[1:17:17] I'll tell you right now it'd be hard for
[1:17:19] you and I to have a lot of confidence if
[1:17:21] Paul was one of those ivory tower
[1:17:22] sitters you don't know how it is a lot
[1:17:25] of times in your workplace you got
[1:17:27] people than live up there and they walk
[1:17:28] in the carpets you know they drink the
[1:17:32] high dollar coffee and everything else
[1:17:33] and yet they make all of the decisions
[1:17:35] for you to do certain things never live
[1:17:38] the day on the floor never work today
[1:17:42] but yet they've got the ultimate
[1:17:43] solution to how to fix the problems add
[1:17:48] another creamer and another sugar and
[1:17:50] that should make everything fine but do
[1:17:52] you understand here is Paul a prisoner
[1:17:55] of Jesus Christ he does not say Paul a
[1:17:59] prisoner of Rome do you know what he
[1:18:03] recognizes I'm not here as a prisoner
[1:18:06] roll Paul had wrote in the very first
[1:18:09] chapter to the Romans I desire to come
[1:18:13] to you but many times I've been hindered
[1:18:15] but then when Paul would stand there
[1:18:18] before Felix
[1:18:19] how the Holy Spirit told him said Paul
[1:18:21] you are going to go and testify in Rome
[1:18:25] as you've testified in Jerusalem Paul
[1:18:28] realized that what had taken place his
[1:18:31] circumstances he was testifying I am a
[1:18:34] prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:18:37] I find it you know when you look at Paul
[1:18:43] or John on the Isle of Patmos try to
[1:18:46] find out a lot of stuff about the howl
[1:18:48] of hammers
[1:18:51] try to find out a lot matter of fact
[1:18:54] after that phrases mentioned in the Book
[1:18:56] of Revelations try to find it again John
[1:19:00] could have chose to be absorbed in the
[1:19:03] hardships of the Isle of Patmos just
[1:19:07] like me and you and sometimes you know
[1:19:10] what thank god we've got encouragement I
[1:19:12] said thank god we've got encouragement
[1:19:15] because we're not always hitting out of
[1:19:17] ten and we've got encouragement
[1:19:20] encourage for what why would God give
[1:19:22] you a help mate to help you to encourage
[1:19:27] you in what in the face of Almighty God
[1:19:30] to be an encouragement to you not to be
[1:19:34] littler but an encouragement in the
[1:19:36] things of Almighty God now to think of
[1:19:39] this here Paul a prisoner of Jesus
[1:19:41] Christ you know when we look at it here
[1:19:43] Paul here he was undoubtedly Paul now
[1:19:45] listen to me these are not just words
[1:19:47] that said like you or me going to
[1:19:51] somebody that's it and then they all of
[1:19:52] a sudden they rattle out you know
[1:19:54] scriptures and and quotes and everything
[1:19:56] else and they've got everything put
[1:19:57] together and that's not what Paul was
[1:19:59] doing here you understand this was not
[1:20:01] pride coming out here where you know I'm
[1:20:03] going to show that I've got a lot and
[1:20:05] this was not what this was and please
[1:20:07] don't misunderstand me
[1:20:08] in quotes the scriptures are they come
[1:20:10] to me as well but yet within it here to
[1:20:13] understand that Paul is not just putting
[1:20:15] something a play on words this is a
[1:20:17] reality of where Paul is resting how can
[1:20:21] he do this it is not the DNA of Paul he
[1:20:27] told us in other places he had
[1:20:29] experienced fears within and without
[1:20:33] Paul never wrote this that he would be
[1:20:35] exalted but how is this how does this
[1:20:38] come about is because Paul in the midst
[1:20:41] of his test or trial this is a huge key
[1:20:44] he stayed in fellowship with Jesus
[1:20:48] Christ it's one thing for us to be in
[1:20:54] him and dwell in him but remember Paul
[1:20:58] also wrote to the Galatians saying it
[1:21:00] twice in the same chapter if ye
[1:21:04] in the spirit walk also in the spirit
[1:21:08] giving our lives over to him even as
[1:21:11] Jude would admonish us building
[1:21:14] ourselves up in that most holy faith
[1:21:16] keeping yourself in the love of God to
[1:21:19] to think how that Paul himself what's
[1:21:21] Paul doing by staying in fellowship the
[1:21:24] same thing for you and I by staying in
[1:21:26] prayer with God and staying in
[1:21:28] fellowship with other believers now let
[1:21:30] me just put a little caveat here staying
[1:21:32] in fellowship with believers it's not
[1:21:35] calling somebody up and telling them all
[1:21:37] your problems and all your troubles
[1:21:40] sometimes that's what people call prayer
[1:21:42] that's not called prayer that's called
[1:21:44] complaining and you'll never receive
[1:21:47] strength through complaining but if
[1:21:52] somebody's on the other end listen they
[1:21:54] can help us they can say you know what
[1:21:56] but God is faithful I'll tell you what
[1:21:59] you have to do within this you just
[1:22:01] don't have to take this to God in prayer
[1:22:02] and you know got in then God will you
[1:22:04] know maybe give something that will help
[1:22:06] them or encourage them because to tell
[1:22:08] you the truth friends we all have been
[1:22:10] there one time or another and then not
[1:22:12] just once sometimes we frequent in that
[1:22:15] place I know that's something we oh I
[1:22:17] don't want I don't want to admit that no
[1:22:18] but the reality is their humanity shows
[1:22:21] itself the frailty of the vessels you
[1:22:24] know many times I've been around people
[1:22:25] who are sick right here in this assembly
[1:22:27] you would come in and you know as your
[1:22:29] your you're ministering to that MA so
[1:22:31] many times I leave out of there I'm
[1:22:33] encouraged man I'm strengthened I
[1:22:34] thought you know Here I am to go to try
[1:22:36] to you know Lord is there anything I can
[1:22:37] say anything you know I can do just be
[1:22:40] an encouragement sometimes you realize
[1:22:41] it's just actually going and being there
[1:22:43] but then many times I'll be things that
[1:22:45] will actually be refreshing or things
[1:22:48] that they would say and then you might
[1:22:49] hear you know the little setback that'll
[1:22:51] come their way and maybe you know they
[1:22:53] would get a little down or discouraged
[1:22:54] but you know a child of God cannot say
[1:22:57] down or stay discouraged very long how
[1:22:59] can you keep them down or discouraged
[1:23:01] when they've got resurrection power
[1:23:05] on the inside the party raised us up we
[1:23:08] might get down we might get discouraged
[1:23:10] but there is resurrection power on the
[1:23:14] inside the holy be to God so Paul has
[1:23:20] he's able to receive from the Lord look
[1:23:23] Paul Jin just right come before that
[1:23:25] we're he's a half reached that can be
[1:23:28] touched by the feeling of our
[1:23:29] infirmities Paul did not write that and
[1:23:30] send that out there among the church
[1:23:31] just as a good writing it was a reality
[1:23:34] he knew that you realize many times when
[1:23:38] you're listening to the message there's
[1:23:39] things now over the past years I listen
[1:23:41] to it there's ways and certain things a
[1:23:43] brother man will say that I can look and
[1:23:44] say he's experienced that it just might
[1:23:47] be a little phrase of something but you
[1:23:49] go into it and say he's experienced it
[1:23:50] because you'll find things that where
[1:23:52] he'll be directed by the Spirit of God
[1:23:54] to tell us how to battle certain things
[1:23:56] with the enemy and you know what you
[1:23:59] don't get that by reading you don't get
[1:24:02] that by reading we understand of
[1:24:04] Ephesians 6 putting on the home of God
[1:24:06] but it's also by the application and the
[1:24:09] experience with it and sometimes our
[1:24:11] experience with it we miss some fiery
[1:24:13] darts but with that experience
[1:24:14] it helps us so that we can catch other
[1:24:16] fiery darts go over to be to God
[1:24:21] you're nothing oh my let's keep moving
[1:24:24] here notice how Paul he would make this
[1:24:27] appeal to to Philemon he would make this
[1:24:32] appeal to him I want you to just look at
[1:24:34] this here because we're talking about an
[1:24:35] epistle a living epistle of Jesus Christ
[1:24:39] not only was Paul's life and expression
[1:24:41] but let's look here that fill a man's
[1:24:45] life here and look at how that it's
[1:24:47] wrote Paul says I thank my god making
[1:24:50] mention of the always in my prayers
[1:24:54] hearing of thy love and faith which thou
[1:24:58] has toward the Lord Jesus and toward All
[1:25:05] Saints
[1:25:07] so it wasn't just a love and a faith
[1:25:10] that was toward the Lord Jesus but he
[1:25:14] also heard of this brothers faith that
[1:25:17] it was his love and faith was not only
[1:25:20] expressed toward the Lord Jesus but it
[1:25:22] was also to all the saints there is
[1:25:24] commendation that is going forth here
[1:25:26] notice in verse 6 that the communication
[1:25:29] of that faith may become effectual by
[1:25:32] the acknowledging of every good thing
[1:25:35] which is in you in Christ Jesus for we
[1:25:38] have great joy and consolation in thy
[1:25:41] love because the bowels of the saints
[1:25:44] are refreshed by the brother how many of
[1:25:50] you like to be refreshed ok about five
[1:25:54] ten of you how many of you want to be a
[1:26:01] refreshing station you want to be a
[1:26:05] place to where someone knows that I can
[1:26:07] go and be refreshed I mean there's
[1:26:11] certain places that are in your house
[1:26:12] that you can go and be refreshed right
[1:26:16] so there's certain parts watch how this
[1:26:18] is mentioned here he's mentioned of the
[1:26:20] expression of the love and faith and
[1:26:22] then he's also spoke of the great joy
[1:26:24] and comfort that's consolation in thy
[1:26:27] love because the boughs the boughs
[1:26:29] themselves being bad like we've looked
[1:26:31] at this many times of the spleen or that
[1:26:33] of that inward part of the tender
[1:26:35] affections the kindness the beloved of
[1:26:38] benevolence that would be there with the
[1:26:40] people of God so to think about this
[1:26:41] here with with with Philemon of how that
[1:26:44] within his lot there was such a
[1:26:47] testimony that was before the Saints
[1:26:52] it was not just a testimony that's a
[1:26:55] good moral man man-bat brother can quote
[1:27:00] the word that was not the testimony he
[1:27:03] expressed the love and faith of Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ in other words the life was lived
[1:27:11] so the life itself an epistle that was
[1:27:14] actually expressed not to think of this
[1:27:16] here of how that Paul you can you know
[1:27:18] when you see this of how that Paul would
[1:27:21] make mention that the people of God were
[1:27:23] actually refreshed by this man how could
[1:27:28] the people of God be refreshed by him
[1:27:30] it's evident was it that was it that you
[1:27:32] know Philemon wasn't that he didn't have
[1:27:34] trials he did have trials was it that he
[1:27:37] did not have problems he did have
[1:27:39] problems even one that will go into and
[1:27:42] read about but what was the secret he
[1:27:46] was in contact with the high priest and
[1:27:49] he was connected so that that sympathy
[1:27:52] think about it he will even this would
[1:27:54] not have been the testimony if his life
[1:27:56] was filled with bitterness but his life
[1:28:00] was so silver flowing with love and
[1:28:03] faith friends listen this was not
[1:28:05] something that you to look at today or
[1:28:07] me and say oh Lord that that's just
[1:28:09] unattainable no it is attainable to us
[1:28:12] as believers put on therefore has the
[1:28:16] holy elect beloved of God bowels of
[1:28:20] mercies seek in to submit to it and
[1:28:23] recognize this is not something we just
[1:28:25] pick up or it's something just kicks in
[1:28:27] in our life but remember may we be so
[1:28:30] anointed with his spirit that it will
[1:28:35] pour over from our lives to be ministers
[1:28:41] of his presence the innermost part of
[1:28:45] the people were refreshed
[1:28:48] I don't know how it is with you but
[1:28:50] there's been times I I mean really I've
[1:28:51] been refreshed sometimes you know in
[1:28:54] places and times you know even even
[1:28:56] sometimes in ministry I know it seems
[1:28:57] odd and strange
[1:28:58] you wouldn't understand it maybe if you
[1:29:00] as a minister even sometimes as a pastor
[1:29:01] but the refreshment at times is a very
[1:29:04] is a very welcoming thing and when you
[1:29:06] are refreshed sometimes even as we would
[1:29:07] fellowship together I want to be
[1:29:09] refreshed you know what I mean a lot to
[1:29:13] be refreshed I like to be encouraged I
[1:29:16] like you know I
[1:29:18] that's that's a desire to where when you
[1:29:20] leave fellowship you don't say huh you
[1:29:28] understand you'd ought to be Battleship
[1:29:32] refreshment one to another let me move
[1:29:35] on from that it ought to be that of
[1:29:37] encouragement no wonder that Paul would
[1:29:40] go on to admonish us as believers in
[1:29:43] Hebrews chapter 10 verse 23 let us hold
[1:29:46] fast the profession of our faith without
[1:29:48] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:29:52] promised and let us uh-oh consider one
[1:29:58] another that means think about to give
[1:30:02] mine to let every man the land on every
[1:30:04] man look on his own things but also on
[1:30:06] the things of others let us consider one
[1:30:09] another to provoke unto love and to good
[1:30:12] works how do you provoke unto love and
[1:30:16] good works not by words not by words by
[1:30:23] a life a life that's lift a life that's
[1:30:29] effectually expressed
[1:30:35] so how can this be if we're not in
[1:30:38] contact with one another
[1:30:41] hello somebody how can this be if we're
[1:30:45] not in contact with one another but
[1:30:46] saying I pray in my prayer closet
[1:30:47] wonderful so do i but how can this be if
[1:30:52] we're not in contact one another I'm not
[1:30:54] talking about where we gotta be to be
[1:30:55] one another's best buddies and best
[1:30:57] friends and always getting together for
[1:30:58] coffee that's not what I'm talking about
[1:30:59] we miss the simplicity of the gospel
[1:31:02] here not forsaking the Assembly of
[1:31:06] ourselves together you know you could
[1:31:08] sit down and tell somebody this is the
[1:31:09] right thing to do do this do this do
[1:31:11] this do this do this do this you let me
[1:31:14] know how often they're gonna come and
[1:31:15] seek your company out what brother
[1:31:17] Samuel you know the word is corrective I
[1:31:19] know but sometimes it's not the word
[1:31:22] that's corrective it's your attitude
[1:31:24] that's offensive
[1:31:26] it's not anything about the word people
[1:31:28] were not offended by the word it was by
[1:31:30] the attitude Oh God we want to represent
[1:31:36] you know the reality is let them see
[1:31:39] that it's a life let's encourage one
[1:31:42] another let it be an expression of life
[1:31:45] on a pistol that's lived oh god help us
[1:31:50] not forsaking the assembling of
[1:31:53] ourselves together as the manner of some
[1:31:57] is now I mentioned they had some of the
[1:32:00] same excuses we do today but exhorting
[1:32:03] one another and so much more as you see
[1:32:06] the Day approaching
[1:32:10] now look at this in the message at that
[1:32:13] world a person who lives their life for
[1:32:17] their self lives a selfish life we must
[1:32:21] live for others bear you one another's
[1:32:25] burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ
[1:32:27] we've got to have a feeling for one
[1:32:29] another and therefore when you do all
[1:32:31] that you know to do then when you lay
[1:32:33] down and night you have the consolation
[1:32:35] knowing that you tried your best
[1:32:38] I can't make everyone believe that's
[1:32:41] impossible
[1:32:41] Jesus couldn't do that when he was on
[1:32:43] earth and I know they'll be just a few
[1:32:45] that believes but if anything I can add
[1:32:48] to help the gospel that's my duty of
[1:32:50] being here is to try to help somebody
[1:32:53] along the way uniting time ensign he
[1:32:58] says a man Jesus Christ in the form of a
[1:33:01] pillar of fire that he was in the Old
[1:33:03] Testament he was when he met Saul on the
[1:33:05] road down there to Damascus the Saint
[1:33:07] Jesus here today and what does it do
[1:33:10] does it bring fear it brings love a
[1:33:14] uniting of one another very men a
[1:33:18] feeling for one another it brings the
[1:33:21] love of God o uniting us and bring us
[1:33:24] the body of Christ into unity as a bride
[1:33:26] that's what it's doing now this great
[1:33:29] union with God that's what it's doing it
[1:33:34] how within our lives the love of God it
[1:33:37] moves it even moves for those and saying
[1:33:39] God help them Lord may they come into
[1:33:42] this life Lord help them Lord God but
[1:33:44] they would recognize it's not a do's and
[1:33:47] dont's it is a life it is the very
[1:33:49] person of Jesus Christ that they need to
[1:33:52] meet Lord God help them Lord God you
[1:33:58] realize this we we understand this right
[1:34:00] here it's not speaking of church being a
[1:34:02] Country Club where it's a feel-good we
[1:34:09] come here to be edified and encouraged
[1:34:11] and part of the edification is when he
[1:34:14] also cuts us down because he's removing
[1:34:18] from us what would be a great hindrance
[1:34:20] to our lives
[1:34:22] when he disciplines and corrects us but
[1:34:25] the heart to be has its place such a
[1:34:27] love of feeling for one another it
[1:34:33] ceasing to feel for somebody if they're
[1:34:35] right on the same track as you and what
[1:34:38] I find is odd sometimes people have more
[1:34:40] feeling for people who don't even come
[1:34:41] to church than for people that come to
[1:34:43] church with something wrong with that
[1:34:45] Holy Ghost something's wrong somewhere
[1:34:47] well the same as they've sent no they
[1:34:49] note or they'd this or they've that but
[1:34:51] what about within the life who can have
[1:34:54] compassion who can have a life to pray
[1:34:57] for that individual to pray for them and
[1:34:59] maybe to contact them you know friends
[1:35:01] these things are very simple I
[1:35:02] understand but they're so important to
[1:35:06] our lives but you realize this is not
[1:35:08] something that even within itself
[1:35:10] I believe the Spirit of God my desire
[1:35:12] was so stir our hearts within these
[1:35:14] things that has that you know with with
[1:35:17] Philemon when he came there among the
[1:35:19] people of God they were actually
[1:35:21] refreshed as he came among them look at
[1:35:28] this in verse eight now Paul's getting
[1:35:33] into the matter of the business
[1:35:39] wherefore though I might be much bold in
[1:35:42] Christ to enjoin which means to command
[1:35:44] thee that which is convenient or fitting
[1:35:47] yet for love's sake I rather beseech or
[1:35:52] Mohnish thee being such an one as Paul
[1:35:55] the age and now also a prisoner of Jesus
[1:35:59] Christ look how Paul is placing this
[1:36:02] once again Paul the aged and a prisoner
[1:36:07] of Jesus Christ
[1:36:08] I beseech thee for my son O'Neal only
[1:36:13] Simas whom I have begotten in my bonds
[1:36:18] Wow Anisa mmus was a slave servant of
[1:36:25] Philemon he had run away he had escaped
[1:36:29] he had taken money and noticed when Paul
[1:36:34] writes this he doesn't say thy servant
[1:36:37] Aneesa mmus he says my son Aneesa miss
[1:36:44] her glory there was something that took
[1:36:48] place that Paul was able to witness he
[1:36:53] could have said that servant but you see
[1:36:55] there had been a change all glory be to
[1:37:02] God you realize that within this here
[1:37:05] hell that within it this this this man
[1:37:08] only Simas he could have been put to
[1:37:10] death for going back as that of Rome he
[1:37:15] could have been put to death for
[1:37:16] escaping and running away
[1:37:21] well I want you to see notice where
[1:37:23] we've come to and this Paul did not just
[1:37:26] pull right out and pull authority or
[1:37:29] pull rank and say take him back but he
[1:37:32] writes with compassion which in times
[1:37:39] past was to be unprofitable but now
[1:37:44] profitable to thee and to me there's no
[1:37:47] doubt about it
[1:37:48] fillet menounos terms in times past
[1:37:51] he knew what times past meant in times
[1:37:55] past he was dead in sin and trespasses
[1:37:59] he knew in times past what to Smith but
[1:38:03] he at one time was unprofitable to you
[1:38:05] but now he's profitable truly any life
[1:38:08] without the Lord being the center of it
[1:38:11] there's wonderful things that can be
[1:38:12] done that's true but really a life
[1:38:14] itself without Christ being the center
[1:38:17] it never comes to the height of real
[1:38:20] true profitable nough son'll s it's
[1:38:23] inside of the Lord Jesus Christ a person
[1:38:25] might be ever so helpful to the
[1:38:26] community they might do all of those
[1:38:28] good things and whatever more but you
[1:38:30] know what it's a lot more than doing
[1:38:32] good and doing this and I give baskets
[1:38:34] to the poor it's about living a life
[1:38:36] that's surrendered to the Lord Jesus
[1:38:38] Christ that he is reflected through our
[1:38:41] lives
[1:38:42] oh my you know when Paul would write
[1:38:46] this you know Paul was one when you you
[1:38:48] look how Paul would write in the book of
[1:38:50] Romans and other places
[1:38:51] Paul was quick to let people know you
[1:38:52] know when you walk into people's house
[1:38:54] sometimes you you know you sometimes you
[1:38:58] know when you maybe go in my mom's house
[1:39:00] and then my wife's my wife will have
[1:39:02] even pictures of me when we first
[1:39:03] started courting and things like that
[1:39:05] and you know almost look back at them
[1:39:06] picture now saying who in the world is
[1:39:08] that guy
[1:39:10] well my mom will have pictures of
[1:39:12] knowing I was a boy you know and then
[1:39:14] you look back on that in your thing lord
[1:39:16] have mercy and you know you changed
[1:39:18] since then right you can go back to that
[1:39:22] now you know within those pictures a
[1:39:24] picture itself is a moment whether maybe
[1:39:26] it's a moment where you're at some type
[1:39:28] of an event and you take a picture maybe
[1:39:30] your son or daughter is on the stage or
[1:39:32] grandchild or whatever
[1:39:33] and you snap that picture and they're
[1:39:35] just stepping up to the microphone
[1:39:36] that's their that is a moment that's
[1:39:38] been captured but if time terry's they
[1:39:41] themselves will no longer or they will
[1:39:43] grow beyond that moment in that picture
[1:39:45] they change in their looks
[1:39:47] maybe there's certain things that they
[1:39:48] change and certain things that you're
[1:39:50] praying that'll be changed and that
[1:39:52] actually gets changed in their life but
[1:39:53] what happens you've got a point or a
[1:39:55] photo or a point you can go back to and
[1:39:58] say this is where they were at this
[1:40:00] point but this is now who they are and
[1:40:03] you realize that what Paul is writing by
[1:40:06] the Spirit of God that yes that though
[1:40:08] Anissa mmus has done you wrong but
[1:40:11] remember don't keep that photograph
[1:40:16] don't keep him in a picture frame as
[1:40:19] though to try to hold him in bondage you
[1:40:25] know how Paul wrote without me laying in
[1:40:26] a lot more scriptures on this right here
[1:40:28] there's things friends that offenses and
[1:40:30] everything can come our way what matters
[1:40:32] is are we gonna hold people in picture
[1:40:35] frames you with me are we going to keep
[1:40:40] them in that same picture or are we
[1:40:42] going to allow and then allow the Spirit
[1:40:44] of God to move and allow God to work
[1:40:46] within their life and bring them around
[1:40:48] maybe they'll never come around but
[1:40:50] regardless we don't allow the picture
[1:40:53] frame to control our reference toward
[1:40:56] them glory be to God this is a real
[1:41:00] expression of the gospel oh my so to
[1:41:04] think of this here how that that Paul
[1:41:07] would go on here in verse 12 whom I have
[1:41:10] sinned again that thou therefore receive
[1:41:13] him that is mine own bounce
[1:41:19] receiving this is my heart this is my
[1:41:23] tender affection receive him listen now
[1:41:28] Paul is not in a comfortable living room
[1:41:32] he's not sitting in a lazy boy and has
[1:41:36] his latte on the side
[1:41:40] he's in a Roman Jail
[1:41:44] he's in a situation that is not
[1:41:48] comfortable oh god help us but he is not
[1:41:53] he is not allowed there of the walls of
[1:41:56] that of that prison
[1:41:57] - so taint him and the acids there to
[1:42:01] move within bitterness to where he will
[1:42:03] not even take notice of uneasiness she
[1:42:08] had to take notice of a nice famous to
[1:42:10] actually be able to lead him to the Lord
[1:42:12] he had to be you say how could that be
[1:42:15] it goes back to what the Lord's been
[1:42:17] bringing out in our life the secret is
[1:42:20] going and taking our burdens to him in
[1:42:23] prayer lord help me Lord God when the
[1:42:28] acids and things like that would want to
[1:42:30] pour down Lord God Lord Jesus let it be
[1:42:33] Lord the Holy Spirit just moving down
[1:42:36] Lord watering in my life Lord God help
[1:42:39] me Lord in this situation lord help my
[1:42:42] attitude Lord to be right Lord God wash
[1:42:44] me Lord Jesus this is what was taking
[1:42:50] place if not Paul would have said
[1:42:55] permissiveness you're on your own but I
[1:42:58] got my own set of problems you see this
[1:43:00] ching ching ching ching ching do you
[1:43:03] know what they've been doing to me how
[1:43:05] they're feeding me miss mills and how
[1:43:07] they're rats and this and then even in
[1:43:09] these times right here paul's chained to
[1:43:11] a soldier but you don't hear it do you
[1:43:17] hello now that's okay i know sometimes
[1:43:20] this stings but you say man it'll help
[1:43:22] your Paul would have had Instagram he
[1:43:25] wouldn't have been posting pictures of
[1:43:27] the soldier with her with an emoji I
[1:43:31] hope I got that right with a gnome emoji
[1:43:33] with teary eyes coming down Paul would
[1:43:37] not have been doing that it wasn't that
[1:43:40] Paul was superhuman
[1:43:43] he was that he stayed in contact with
[1:43:46] God that I may know him in the power of
[1:43:51] his resurrection and the Fellowship of
[1:43:54] his sufferings
[1:44:02] Mazal say it as it comes to me you know
[1:44:04] their studies they've done with things
[1:44:06] on Facebook and water for more and I
[1:44:08] know some of you have to have before
[1:44:09] your job I know there's requirements
[1:44:10] like that that has taken place but you
[1:44:13] know what they've even actually done all
[1:44:15] the studies and things like a and you
[1:44:16] find where people even within depression
[1:44:18] and people's moods they'll fire it up
[1:44:20] and they see certain posts going on and
[1:44:23] it'll affect them the rest of the day
[1:44:24] now let me ask you a question
[1:44:30] do you want somebody feel sorry for you
[1:44:32] or do you want the Lord to pour out of
[1:44:36] his spirit because if he pours out of
[1:44:40] his spirit I guarantee you right now
[1:44:41] he's a high priest that can be touched
[1:44:43] by the feeling of our infirmities and I
[1:44:45] guarantee you there's other believer
[1:44:46] priests that are in contact with him
[1:44:49] that he can drop your name right in
[1:44:52] their heart he may not drop my name in
[1:44:54] somebody's heart in Nigeria I don't know
[1:44:56] many of her brothers even though we're
[1:44:58] part of the same body of Jesus Christ
[1:45:00] but he will with the local body he'll
[1:45:03] drop it in my heart maybe other pastors
[1:45:05] or ministers that I'm associated with
[1:45:07] that is the confidence that we have in
[1:45:10] him what did Paul even come in the
[1:45:13] Church of the Living God in the opening
[1:45:15] there of 2nd Corinthians chapter one I
[1:45:16] believe it is where he would speak your
[1:45:18] prayers your prayers going forth on our
[1:45:22] behalf have comforted us and then even
[1:45:26] have Instagram Twitter and Facebook and
[1:45:28] texting and SMS and whatever more they
[1:45:30] didn't have all of that but they had a
[1:45:33] greater signal station like her brother
[1:45:38] Daryl say before at a camp they didn't
[1:45:40] have a TMT they had g.od hey man what a
[1:45:46] sending station that they received same
[1:45:49] thing you and I receive here today now
[1:45:52] look at this here whom I
[1:45:54] would have retained with me that in thy
[1:45:57] stead he might have ministered unto me
[1:46:01] in the bonds of the gospel Paul Paul you
[1:46:07] mean this man who was a slave who ran
[1:46:12] away you're allowing you mean he's
[1:46:17] ministering to you see Paul wrote about
[1:46:22] the body he wrote on the Ministry of the
[1:46:25] body and knew that every joint supplies
[1:46:28] he knew the movement of the Spirit of
[1:46:31] God of how that God could actually end
[1:46:34] it he even wrote it in Philippians and
[1:46:36] other places that it would actually
[1:46:37] minister back to him don't you see
[1:46:39] friends it's not just us going and
[1:46:41] minister and giving out giving out
[1:46:43] giving out it's also that there's to be
[1:46:45] of movement in the body there's one
[1:46:48] valve a chamber it goes out of the heart
[1:46:50] it sends out that blood
[1:46:52] but there's another intake valve if
[1:46:55] there's not an intake valve there's
[1:46:56] gonna be problems there's God it's got
[1:46:59] to be that circulating there of that
[1:47:02] very life that ministering one to
[1:47:04] another on one another's behalf verse 14
[1:47:07] but without thy mind would I do nothing
[1:47:11] that that benefit should not be as it
[1:47:15] were
[1:47:16] of necessity but willingly what another
[1:47:22] principle of the gospel I don't want you
[1:47:27] to do it out of necessity I could have
[1:47:29] kept him here but I want it to be
[1:47:32] willingly I want it to be willingly this
[1:47:38] is the same desire we have the children
[1:47:40] have desire it's willingly not out of
[1:47:42] necessity we Minister different things
[1:47:45] of the system but yet the desire is
[1:47:47] willingly of art now to think of this
[1:47:51] what's this
[1:47:51] what if Paul would have just cut to the
[1:47:53] chase and this would have been a shorter
[1:47:55] epistle
[1:47:58] maybe one scripture receive an SMS no
[1:48:06] questions asked what if he'd have done
[1:48:11] it that way it may not have come out too
[1:48:16] good would it it wouldn't have been that
[1:48:19] no doubt that Philemon wouldn't wouldn't
[1:48:20] have you know he would I'm not gonna do
[1:48:22] that no but you see even within this
[1:48:24] Paul himself recognizes there's wrong
[1:48:28] that's been done that might still be
[1:48:31] stinging in the heart of Philemon maybe
[1:48:34] he's having to pray
[1:48:35] maybe the feelings maybe thoughts will
[1:48:37] come up and he's having to pray I hope
[1:48:40] you're with me
[1:48:41] Philemon wasn't walking around as a
[1:48:43] superhuman either where that all nor I
[1:48:46] got the love of God in my heart I never
[1:48:48] have any wrong thoughts towards anybody
[1:48:50] I never think wrong of uneasiness
[1:48:53] no no doubt he had to battle those
[1:48:55] thoughts but there's a burden he was
[1:48:58] able to battle him when he would try to
[1:49:00] encroach and come back up he was able to
[1:49:02] how did he battle it the same way Paul
[1:49:04] did staying in prayer in the love of God
[1:49:08] and pouring his heart and allowing his
[1:49:10] life to be refreshed sometimes friends
[1:49:13] all we do is dump the problems and we're
[1:49:15] not asking God Lord minister back to me
[1:49:18] and wiggled added prayer get up in
[1:49:21] prayer and feel the same way how can
[1:49:23] that be it's because all we're doing is
[1:49:26] pouring out our problems but the reality
[1:49:28] when we come before the throne of God
[1:49:30] remember here don't ever let the devil
[1:49:33] take that away from you there is a high
[1:49:35] priest that is touched by the feeling of
[1:49:39] your infirmities he can release and he
[1:49:42] does release virtue and strength to
[1:49:45] minister to you an hour in the time of
[1:49:48] need it doesn't mean when we get back up
[1:49:51] off our knees that our trial is gone
[1:49:53] our trouble is gone but we've received
[1:49:55] refreshment to be able to make another
[1:49:59] step
[1:50:00] then maybe by noon when you get ready
[1:50:03] for lunch things will start back up but
[1:50:05] there you can go right before the high
[1:50:07] threes you know what are you doing you
[1:50:10] are watching yourself in the presence of
[1:50:13] Almighty God this is where Paul would
[1:50:17] say in Romans 6 let not therefore sin
[1:50:21] reign in your mortal body that you
[1:50:25] should obey it in the lusts thereof but
[1:50:29] yield your members as those that are
[1:50:33] alive from the dead the quickening soda
[1:50:37] recognize don't allow thoughts rain
[1:50:41] suggestions that come things that better
[1:50:44] said don't allow it to rain but instead
[1:50:46] just allow the refreshing of the Holy
[1:50:49] Spirit Lord my brother didn't mean that
[1:50:52] my sister didn't mean that now you're
[1:50:53] not gonna talk about my brother that way
[1:50:55] you're not gonna toggle you know you see
[1:50:57] it's allowing a refreshment the same is
[1:51:06] simple I know but if God will help us
[1:51:08] right now cross the mystery of God will
[1:51:10] be expressed this is this is why brother
[1:51:14] Branham would take such long time even
[1:51:17] before that message so tickle and
[1:51:22] fast-forward it too when he opens in
[1:51:24] Luke 24 you missed a key component you
[1:51:29] get this right it's like having the best
[1:51:30] gasoline in the world if you don't have
[1:51:32] a spark what good does it do if your
[1:51:35] pipes aren't clean what good does it do
[1:51:38] you see this is this is a key thing we
[1:51:41] are charged with this now boy listen
[1:51:44] listen to try to bring this now for
[1:51:46] perhaps verse 15 he therefore departed
[1:51:49] for season that thou should has received
[1:51:52] him for ever now not as a servant but
[1:51:56] above a servant a brother beloved
[1:52:00] especially to me but how much more unto
[1:52:04] thee both in the flesh
[1:52:07] and in the Lord now let's go to
[1:52:11] Colossians chapter 4 because Paul's not
[1:52:15] just riding a letter here to Philemon
[1:52:18] but this letter that goes personally to
[1:52:21] Philemon was also accompanied with the
[1:52:25] Epistle to the caution church
[1:52:28] now the Costin Church they would have
[1:52:31] known Philemon record history and so
[1:52:34] forth says it has that perhaps that
[1:52:36] Philemon after heap a person different
[1:52:37] ones was the past or the one who was
[1:52:39] overseeing it they would have known on
[1:52:42] the CMAs now watch how Paul places this
[1:52:46] in Colossians for one masters give unto
[1:52:50] your servants that which is just and
[1:52:53] equal knowing that ye also have a master
[1:52:57] in heaven see Paul had to deal with this
[1:53:01] in the church so there was not one
[1:53:03] rising up over the other but to
[1:53:05] recognize we're sons and daughters of
[1:53:07] Abraham that's where it starts now watch
[1:53:10] verse seven all my estate South shall
[1:53:14] flashes declare unto you who is a
[1:53:16] beloved brother and a faithful minister
[1:53:18] and a fellow servant in the Lord whom I
[1:53:20] have sent unto you for the same purpose
[1:53:22] that he might know your estate and
[1:53:25] comfort your hearts with only Simas a
[1:53:28] faithful and beloved brother who is one
[1:53:33] of you they shall make known unto you
[1:53:37] all things which are done here
[1:53:41] a slave let's run away he's been
[1:53:45] converted and there's obvious that the
[1:53:48] work of Christ in his life where Paul
[1:53:51] would count him in this passage of
[1:53:54] Scripture as a fellow laborer you see
[1:54:00] what the work of Jesus Christ does in a
[1:54:02] life it's him
[1:54:05] that raises that life and how Paul
[1:54:08] himself would write concerning him what
[1:54:12] Paul said was enough don't you be
[1:54:16] calling him a slave or a servant
[1:54:18] don't you be bringing up his past this
[1:54:21] is who he is to hold it be to God now
[1:54:28] think of this Paul goes on to say in
[1:54:30] Philemon verse 17 if thou count me
[1:54:33] therefore a partner receive him as
[1:54:36] myself if he have Rome V Oro with the
[1:54:41] art put that on mine account hi Paul
[1:54:51] look at this have written it with my own
[1:54:54] hand I will repay it
[1:54:57] howbeit I do not say to thee how thou
[1:55:01] owest unto me even that own self besides
[1:55:06] an epistle of Jesus Christ
[1:55:09] brother emphasis sometimes I feel like
[1:55:12] the runaway slave when Paul found him he
[1:55:15] wrote back to his master and said put
[1:55:17] all that he owes put it upon my bill and
[1:55:19] I'll pay you when I come when I fake her
[1:55:21] Paul there that great Christian how that
[1:55:23] his heart knew that there was a great
[1:55:26] charge against him and Christ by his own
[1:55:29] blood wrote his pardon at the cross and
[1:55:32] took his place and he knowed how to feel
[1:55:36] for other people wouldn't it be
[1:55:39] wonderful if we all had that feeling
[1:55:42] this afternoon just take their faults
[1:55:45] and lay it on me
[1:55:50] but the tram goes home heals how many
[1:55:59] times with mr. Ballard in the flour
[1:56:01] company mr. Valli remember the man who
[1:56:04] comes to for a job he shows up with a
[1:56:06] pencil a no eraser mr. Ballard asked him
[1:56:08] said why don't your pencil have an
[1:56:10] eraser he said I don't make no mistakes
[1:56:12] he said you can leave because I can't
[1:56:15] use you a person who doesn't make
[1:56:17] mistakes doesn't work this is the
[1:56:23] principle of where love covers the
[1:56:25] multitude of sin are you with me
[1:56:29] it covers the multitude of sin it
[1:56:34] doesn't mean that it closed its eyes
[1:56:35] that which has been brought under the
[1:56:37] blood of Jesus Christ it's done you with
[1:56:41] me it's done not to be brought up
[1:56:43] anymore it's done
[1:56:47] now look at this his brother Graham
[1:56:50] would go on down through here let me
[1:56:52] just kind of go down to this place here
[1:56:55] bill dramas from my how that he's in
[1:56:56] that song go to go to paragraph five
[1:56:59] there he's talking about the song you
[1:57:01] know that he had that he had heard sung
[1:57:03] you know where if I fall if I follow if
[1:57:05] I fail let me rise and try again and he
[1:57:07] goes on he says I prayed that so much to
[1:57:10] God till I'm ashamed of myself almost
[1:57:11] let me rise and try again constantly
[1:57:14] falling in each time while he's been
[1:57:16] merciful to help me to come back again
[1:57:18] now if we just look over there isn't an
[1:57:20] hour through the day hardly but what's
[1:57:22] something we do that's wrong brother
[1:57:24] brems not talking about living a life
[1:57:27] that's not above sin that's not what
[1:57:29] we're talking about and now there's no
[1:57:31] little ones or big ones they're all big
[1:57:33] ones before God
[1:57:34] so if Apostle Paul had to die daily how
[1:57:37] much more will we have to die daily and
[1:57:39] then I think a person that has done
[1:57:42] something wrong and is willing to make
[1:57:44] it right
[1:57:45] the real Christian attitude is to
[1:57:48] forgive that person there's where I
[1:57:53] think brother Graham and the church
[1:57:55] people today miss us so much instead of
[1:57:57] trying to raise this person back up
[1:57:58] again is just to keep shoving them down
[1:58:00] further now you and I we understand
[1:58:03] we're not all more people say I'm sorry
[1:58:05] I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry because
[1:58:06] you know there are people who are sorry
[1:58:09] you understand there sorry you become
[1:58:11] the realized purges sorry I'm sorry I'm
[1:58:14] sorry I'm sorry but it really is it's
[1:58:16] not sorry
[1:58:17] they're just sorry they got caught
[1:58:18] they're sorry things aren't the way they
[1:58:20] want it to be that's not repentance
[1:58:23] that's sorrow of the world godly sorrow
[1:58:26] worketh repentance notice here he says
[1:58:32] that would be the the Gretna Christian
[1:58:35] thing to do
[1:58:36] to forgive that person the attitude and
[1:58:38] he goes on and says Christ when we were
[1:58:39] the lowest he stooped down and picked us
[1:58:41] up so that makes it to where we ought to
[1:58:44] have that kind of a spirit to brother
[1:58:46] and goes on to talk about the underneath
[1:58:48] Shem as he said I just can't call his
[1:58:50] name maybe some of you brethren can't
[1:58:52] I'm thinking of it how Paul he had
[1:58:54] caught a runaway slave and I can't think
[1:58:56] of what his name was but however he owed
[1:58:58] a great debt and Paul had been so into
[1:59:01] love with Christ
[1:59:08] let me put it this way Paul and Jesus
[1:59:12] were still sitting side by side holding
[1:59:15] hands riding down the road put it that
[1:59:19] way in other words Paul and Jesus Hatton
[1:59:21] got married and Jesus was over there by
[1:59:24] the door and Paul was over here they
[1:59:28] were still sweethearts they were still
[1:59:33] holding hands and you know just my
[1:59:37] because then that was reflected when it
[1:59:40] came to this situation till he sent word
[1:59:44] to the master that on the slave he's
[1:59:47] become a beloved brother all that he's
[1:59:49] done all that he owes you put it on my
[1:59:51] account and I'll pay it and when I come
[1:59:52] by Paul had been a Christian so long
[1:59:55] until he knew what it was to forgive
[1:59:59] what it meant to forgive somebody he had
[2:00:03] been forgiven himself and I think every
[2:00:06] Christian that's really been forgiven
[2:00:08] knows appreciations of forgiveness I
[2:00:14] don't know about you but there's things
[2:00:16] you know that you know I was talking
[2:00:17] some years ago you know with a brother
[2:00:20] named as a pastor much much older than
[2:00:21] myself and I was just there knowing and
[2:00:23] ministering in meetings with him this
[2:00:25] meetings and he was talking about a
[2:00:27] situation and the brother himself as he
[2:00:29] mentioned to it he said you know he said
[2:00:30] I've come to a place he said when
[2:00:32] somebody comes up to me and says my
[2:00:34] brother so-and-so he says will you
[2:00:36] forgive me he said I don't even eat so I
[2:00:38] tell him I don't want to know what it is
[2:00:39] you're forgiven
[2:00:40] what's the value of know what it is I
[2:00:43] forgive you you understand what is that
[2:00:48] it's to not allow the enemy to have any
[2:00:51] little nesting straws in our life I know
[2:00:57] you don't have to do that it's not
[2:00:58] doctrine but I look at anything my what
[2:01:00] a great advantage within that that for a
[2:01:03] person to come and say hey will you
[2:01:06] forgive me brother sister it's good it's
[2:01:09] done
[2:01:11] not yet I'll tell me all about it I said
[2:01:20] I was closing we're coming down there
[2:01:23] yeah brother verse 20 let me have joy of
[2:01:29] the in the Lord refresh my bowels in the
[2:01:35] Lord having confidence in thy obedience
[2:01:41] I wrote unto thee what a compliment
[2:01:46] confidence unto thy obedience I wrote to
[2:01:50] you knowing that thou wilt also do more
[2:01:55] than I say let me end with this quote
[2:02:02] fellowship my Redemption
[2:02:07] the fellowship he said Paul had said the
[2:02:09] Fellowship of his suffering bearing
[2:02:12] persecutions with him Paul he was a man
[2:02:16] who had suffered with Christ when that
[2:02:19] slave over there had run away
[2:02:20] Paul had borne so much persecutions so
[2:02:25] many things of Christ to win that
[2:02:28] runaway slave runaway Paul wrote back to
[2:02:32] his master
[2:02:33] after the slave had become converted he
[2:02:36] said don't treat him as a slave anymore
[2:02:39] treat him as a brother Paul didn't say
[2:02:43] he's no longer a servant he said you
[2:02:46] treat him as a brother don't you treat
[2:02:49] him as a servant you treat him as a
[2:02:52] brother if he owes you anything charge
[2:02:57] it up to me when I come I'll pay you he
[2:03:01] had been so in fellowship with Christ in
[2:03:04] his suffering till he knowed what it was
[2:03:08] to be an outcast he said do you know
[2:03:11] what it is to be an outcast he knowed
[2:03:14] what it was to fellowship in his
[2:03:16] suffering so he knowed how to sympathise
[2:03:20] with others
[2:03:23] Paul had been fellowshipping with Christ
[2:03:28] these words so gripped my heart over the
[2:03:31] past weeks hear that through the tests
[2:03:35] and trials we when God first touched our
[2:03:39] life we did not know what tests or
[2:03:42] trials would befall us
[2:03:45] we did not know persecutions repro we
[2:03:49] didn't know all of that we didn't know
[2:03:52] things that we would suffer but yet
[2:03:57] through the midst of it by God's grace
[2:04:02] that the Lord helping us to where our
[2:04:08] lives would not become bitter not become
[2:04:13] bitter to wear it fill with malice
[2:04:18] resentment but to actually allow the
[2:04:23] Lord to minister to us friends listen
[2:04:26] those things themselves could easily set
[2:04:29] in on any of our lives easily this is
[2:04:35] why it takes staying constantly before
[2:04:38] the throne of God that the Lord would
[2:04:43] help us that he would give a strength
[2:04:46] because when this this whole part this
[2:04:50] epistle that we've ministered from today
[2:04:52] as Paul would go on to express you don't
[2:04:55] read one thing here in this epistle
[2:04:58] where Paul is bitter there's not one
[2:05:02] word and as a matter of fact Paul
[2:05:04] himself pours himself out interceding
[2:05:07] for Anissa --mess and gives such
[2:05:11] commending words to Philemon how how can
[2:05:15] he do that the same way by God's grace
[2:05:18] that were able to do it by the help of
[2:05:21] the Lord by his strength it would be
[2:05:24] natural and normal for a person to be
[2:05:28] bitter that would be a person can say
[2:05:33] aha I could see it under I can see I can
[2:05:36] see but yet in our lives by being
[2:05:40] refreshed from the Lord to be able to
[2:05:43] stand there and say the Lord is faithful
[2:05:46] and whether we say anything or not even
[2:05:49] where people can take a notice in our
[2:05:52] lives hardships things that come our way
[2:05:55] but that the presence of God ever
[2:05:58] remains that in itself is a living
[2:06:02] there's a living epistle
[2:06:11] to where others do not look at our lives
[2:06:13] and say I want the same hardships I want
[2:06:16] the same tests i but they look and they
[2:06:18] say that life that anchor that holds
[2:06:22] that's the same expression for homes in
[2:06:26] the church to one another lord help us
[2:06:30] help us support may this be so perfected
[2:06:35] in our lives that's my prayer my prayer
[2:06:38] when I've looked over this this morning
[2:06:40] looking over it again and again and
[2:06:42] again throughout the past weeks months
[2:06:44] looking Oh God let that love so saturate
[2:06:48] my heart I want more of that love I want
[2:06:52] more of that
[2:06:52] like the Prophet himself could say oh I
[2:06:54] wish you said I wish I could dwell in
[2:06:56] that all the time say Lord let it so
[2:07:00] saturate my life that it's so saturate
[2:07:04] my life to where it's not about me my
[2:07:09] problems but where I'm able to look
[2:07:12] they're going to be a help and
[2:07:15] encouragement let me tell you he cares
[2:07:17] for you this morning
[2:07:18] he is he is your refreshment miss pray
[2:07:26] or Jesus
[2:07:31] your God
[2:07:36] this letter received in the hand
[2:07:40] Philemon
[2:07:44] she would receive this letter a
[2:07:46] handwritten letter from Paul that would
[2:07:49] be addressed to him personally an
[2:07:52] epistle as the other epistles are
[2:07:56] regarded
[2:08:00] he would read an expression as it would
[2:08:06] be open Lord the commending the
[2:08:11] encouraging of how that he's been such
[2:08:13] an encouragement to the body but then
[2:08:20] Lord godwyn he would look up and his
[2:08:24] eyes would meet oniy Simas Lord God that
[2:08:29] by the grace of God the work that you
[2:08:33] had so done in Anissa misses life as
[2:08:37] Paul was able to surrender submit to you
[2:08:39] you were able to touch his life to where
[2:08:45] now uneasiness
[2:08:48] would be one who was profitable one who
[2:08:51] would be a help much more than just of
[2:08:54] that of a servant around his household
[2:08:58] but Annie CMAs would be a help a fellow
[2:09:03] laborer in the kingdom of God Lord help
[2:09:09] us sort there's so much Lord within it
[2:09:15] we see within our lives of how that Paul
[2:09:18] as you spoke to us
[2:09:20] Paul was able for his own life staying
[2:09:24] under that refreshment no doubt Paul had
[2:09:29] his times he was down times were he
[2:09:34] would have to battle but Paul would
[2:09:38] bring by the Spirit of God that body and
[2:09:41] subjection Paul would God would be able
[2:09:47] to write to that refreshment and then
[2:09:50] Lord God be able to help this runaway
[2:09:55] slave he would be able to loosen him
[2:10:00] from a bondage a servanthood
[2:10:04] that was much greater than what he
[2:10:06] escaped from he would be able by the
[2:10:11] love of God to project that love that
[2:10:17] would reach the very soul of a nice eNOS
[2:10:20] and set him free
[2:10:25] he would go back to Philemon
[2:10:28] more than the servant he would be a
[2:10:32] beloved brother one a faithful fellow
[2:10:38] laborer in the gospel
[2:10:40] Lord God we're witnesses of that
[2:10:44] transforming power witnesses Lord God
[2:10:48] here this morning Lord that right
[2:10:51] through this building right here that's
[2:10:52] gathered together maybe there's lots
[2:10:54] sitting here this morning undoubtedly
[2:10:56] Lord Lord God they realize there's
[2:11:03] something missing in their life Lord God
[2:11:08] your presence may be words that words
[2:11:11] it's not that they could understand
[2:11:13] words maybe but it's the presence of God
[2:11:16] that would touch their life that which
[2:11:18] is real that would be a reality Lord God
[2:11:20] that would touch their heart Lord or God
[2:11:25] may they give of themselves to you
[2:11:33] maybe Lord God repent of their sins
[2:11:38] maybe Lord God walk or Dean Salvation
[2:11:41] would never accept your Lord as their
[2:11:46] Savior Lord may be something that rise
[2:11:50] within their hearts to say I want that
[2:11:54] reality that presence that sealed a
[2:12:01] living written epistle I want to be
[2:12:07] identified with Jesus Christ
[2:12:10] granite Lord God this morning northers
[2:12:14] heather's Lord as we sit here Lord you
[2:12:19] know our needs Lord God you speak to us
[2:12:25] as we have need of it you encourage us
[2:12:29] what I pray this morning maybe there's
[2:12:32] one that's here going through the
[2:12:34] darkness of trial right now maybe it's
[2:12:38] been something that's just been
[2:12:39] lingering but just seemed like I just
[2:12:43] can't get over this maybe it's something
[2:12:46] Lord that in their life they they don't
[2:12:48] realize but maybe how events have turned
[2:12:51] out that instead of really taking that
[2:12:54] and really praying about it and really
[2:12:57] asking you to cleanse him it's become
[2:13:01] bitter
[2:13:01] [Music]
[2:13:02] lord I pray help her Lord be very easy
[2:13:08] Lord God for that to set in but Lord
[2:13:12] would you help him this morning I don't
[2:13:15] believe God that there's any person Lord
[2:13:17] that would sit here this morning that
[2:13:19] would want to be in bitterness no one
[2:13:23] would Lord I pray the Lord that you
[2:13:26] would move for them Lord
[2:13:28] may they Lord reach out to you Lord
[2:13:30] knowing Lord there's a cleansing full
[2:13:35] there's a refreshing Lord God not just
[2:13:40] Lord God in talking of the problem Lord
[2:13:47] I don't mean to say anything that was
[2:13:48] sting but to really evaluate and say
[2:13:52] Lord have I just been complaining to you
[2:13:55] or am I really casting my care upon you
[2:13:59] am I really Lord coming to you and
[2:14:02] asking you Lord Jesus
[2:14:06] maybe it's a hurt it's a wound it's an
[2:14:08] offence but in your life you realize
[2:14:14] supernaturally that's what it will have
[2:14:17] to be a supernatural touch of the Living
[2:14:23] God
[2:14:25] maybe a part in your life that just
[2:14:28] feels like you're just dead to it you
[2:14:32] need the power of the Resurrection to
[2:14:34] move God by his restoring power to move
[2:14:41] you'll move by his tenderness and by his
[2:14:44] sweetness if you can just reach out to
[2:14:47] him and say Lord come Lord
[2:14:52] sweep over my son sweep over my spirit
[2:14:56] Lord
[2:14:59] maybe you've become hardened do
[2:15:01] calloused maybe there's those things
[2:15:06] about your life that you would say Lord
[2:15:08] I forsake my rights to be hardened to be
[2:15:14] callous Lord God hello on my life to be
[2:15:17] hardened Lord I wanted to be tender Lord
[2:15:21] Jesus Lord God will you just Lord pour
[2:15:26] out of your refreshing Lord refresh my
[2:15:30] life that's what I need Lord I've been
[2:15:33] complaining way too much Lord
[2:15:36] that's not helping me but Lord you're my
[2:15:40] high priest who can be touched by the
[2:15:42] feeling of my infirmities
[2:15:47] Lord you spoke to us some weeks ago you
[2:15:51] know what it's not to be ignored
[2:15:52] you know what it's like to be persecuted
[2:15:56] you know what it's like in all of those
[2:15:58] areas you experienced it or Jesus I need
[2:16:04] strength from you
[2:16:05] I need a touch your God from You Lord
[2:16:09] Jesus or God in fellowship with you Lord
[2:16:15] God that you administer or God to my
[2:16:20] need Lord help me Lord help me I want to
[2:16:26] be an effectual believer priest
[2:16:30] [Music]
[2:16:31] or got a vessel that's available when
[2:16:36] you drop somebody that you can come by
[2:16:39] then Lord God is a vessel that's there
[2:16:42] that you can drop somebody on my heart
[2:16:47] and I can pray for him available Lord
[2:16:52] God to reach out in intercessory a life
[2:16:57] Lord God that maybe can bring right
[2:17:00] around here Lord in the church not here
[2:17:04] Lord God between his sword god from a
[2:17:09] heart we can minister on behalf of that
[2:17:13] soul as Paul would say I'll become all
[2:17:16] things to all men that I may win some to
[2:17:18] Christ
[2:17:20] help us Lord help a sword father we
[2:17:26] realize it'll take the grace of God
[2:17:28] we're living in an hour this is the time
[2:17:30] that Paul spoke of fearless times would
[2:17:33] come and that which is a sign of
[2:17:36] peerless times men shall be lovers of
[2:17:39] themselves
[2:17:44] or Jesus sword
[2:17:51] [Music]
[2:17:53] may our lives be an epistle like this an
[2:17:57] expression of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[2:18:03] help us avoid like Paul to be able to
[2:18:09] reach out there and say lay it on my
[2:18:11] account
[2:18:13] lay it on my account Lord sometimes
[2:18:17] there's things in jobs and places we
[2:18:19] work they say take one for the team
[2:18:21] sometimes that's a phrase that's used
[2:18:23] out there but to think how that Paul
[2:18:26] would come about it with Colossians 3
[2:18:29] and he would say if anyone has a Korell
[2:18:32] forgive one another even as Christ
[2:18:35] forgave you what God help us to be
[2:18:41] simple help us to be silly
[2:18:45] help us to be so as your prophet put it
[2:18:47] in these statements so in fellowship
[2:18:50] with the love of Christ that that can
[2:18:54] reign in our lives
[2:18:58] help us Lord I pray in the name of Jesus
[2:19:03] Christ
