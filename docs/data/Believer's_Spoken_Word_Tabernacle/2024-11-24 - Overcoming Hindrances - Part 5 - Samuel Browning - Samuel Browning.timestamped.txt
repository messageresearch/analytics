[20:37] I'm nervous so just have to be patient
[20:40] with me and if I don't get the words
[20:43] right or something just allow it to my
[20:45] ignorance CU you'll know what I'm
[20:47] talking about and I I've got something
[20:50] to share with you and I had to wait and
[20:54] pray
[20:54] and and and talk to our pastor
[20:59] CUA we we don't want to go over our
[21:01] pastor's head and my heart went out to
[21:04] him there Thursday I I know he had that
[21:07] on his heart and he was struggling and I
[21:09] was just praying and that's why I got up
[21:12] after service and tried to say a little
[21:15] something because I just it was so good
[21:18] you know so I
[21:23] uh I I want to pray again if it's okay
[21:27] before our heavenly father Lord Lord
[21:31] you're so good and gracious and mercies
[21:34] to us we know Lord Jesus now that you
[21:38] come down and become our kinsman
[21:40] redeemer to redeem us for only you could
[21:44] pay that awful price for us and it's
[21:47] good to know Jesus that we're not our
[21:50] own we belong to you we've been bought
[21:53] and paid for it with a price that only
[21:55] you could pay and Lord we find your
[21:58] yourself right here at the end time and
[22:00] seeing these great things that you've
[22:02] done for us and called us and what
[22:05] you're doing Lord and your promises to
[22:07] us that we hold to with all our heart
[22:10] and our soul because we know Lord your
[22:14] word can't fail your promise is true and
[22:17] I just pray Lord It's my heart that
[22:20] somehow be a little blessing and help to
[22:23] your children Lord and I ask you to help
[22:26] me and help them and and just have your
[22:29] way Lord we commit it all into your
[22:31] precious hands in Jesus Christ's name we
[22:34] pray
[22:36] amen I'll try to be I'll try to be brief
[22:39] and I I I was going to I was going to
[22:43] speak some things on the Rapture and I
[22:46] had a lot of quotes and things and I was
[22:48] going to Lord willing another day and
[22:52] God will and I I'll bring that to you
[22:54] but for right now I
[22:58] I don't know just how to say this but
[23:01] you know I I told you I I tried to
[23:04] witness to you what God had done in my
[23:08] life and and I
[23:11] know and everything in God's time and
[23:15] you remember I was telling
[23:17] you after after the the Lord brought me
[23:22] in and I was filled and sealed with his
[23:24] holy
[23:25] spirit it was it was a good while we was
[23:30] hunting for a church and you know this
[23:33] was back in
[23:36] late
[23:39] 69 or 70 somewhere in there so there
[23:41] wasn't a lot of things at churches or
[23:44] anything back then but I remember I'll
[23:48] tell you this and talking about how
[23:51] Satan so subtle tries to bring things
[23:54] around to distract us and take us away
[23:57] but he can't we belong to our Lord there
[24:00] is no way but he's he's going to be
[24:04] Satan and so I Min Shirley was uh coming
[24:08] to church and she was reading to me
[24:10] about this Minister Minister that was
[24:14] forgive me in supposed to be in the
[24:16] message and he was saying that no one
[24:19] else could be
[24:20] saved and I told I said he too late to
[24:23] tell me that and and so and then we know
[24:29] that Satan does those tricks and how he
[24:34] he's done so many thing to try to
[24:36] distract the bride and pull her away
[24:39] over the years and and and this last
[24:43] thing he's come against the
[24:46] ministry and you know that and I I uh I
[24:50] was thinking did did that happen before
[24:53] in the
[24:54] church and I went to I believe it's
[24:58] uh Second
[25:00] Timothy and Paul was talking to Timothy
[25:04] now I can't get these words and names of
[25:06] it but he was talking about these two
[25:08] men that uh was teaching that the
[25:13] resurrection was already passed and
[25:15] overthrow the faith of some so this is
[25:19] nothing new on Satan's tactics that
[25:21] cause he'll he'll do everything he can
[25:25] but he's already defeated our Lord rose
[25:28] conquered and conquered him and Rose
[25:29] over death held in the grave and
[25:32] everything he he can't he can't do
[25:35] anything with God's
[25:37] bride but test and try you and that all
[25:41] works for you
[25:42] good and so you remember me telling
[25:46] you uh it's been after a while I was
[25:49] saved I was at
[25:53] uh church at Lima and I was standing in
[25:56] the back Deacon then and that uh I
[26:02] waiting on brother Tommy you know to
[26:04] open up the song leader and the Lord
[26:08] spoke to me and I told you in here and
[26:11] he said they will ask you to pray and I
[26:14] said huh and about that time brother
[26:17] Tommy said I'm going to ask brother Dave
[26:19] Crest to come up and open prayer and you
[26:22] can imagine how I
[26:23] felt walking up there but I want to make
[26:27] this clear my friend
[26:29] I'm not a preacher or
[26:31] anything I'm just one of God's Little
[26:34] Children a part of you was nothing of me
[26:38] I wasn't asking him Lord will you speak
[26:41] to me he did that by his grace and I
[26:46] told you seven several other times and
[26:50] uh that he spoke to
[26:55] me only one time did he
[26:59] speak to me in an audible voice and
[27:03] I I was reading the
[27:07] Bible and I
[27:08] was reading Luke
[27:13] 17:30 and I said I was wondering to
[27:17] myself I
[27:19] said I don't know is this brother
[27:23] brother brand speaking of himself or our
[27:25] lord
[27:26] Jesus and
[27:28] uh
[27:30] he he spoke to
[27:35] me and
[27:38] he he spoke to me in a tender
[27:41] voice and he said because I asked the P
[27:46] pastor about it and he said I don't know
[27:47] brother I can't tell you so I was in my
[27:50] little room praying and it it come to me
[27:54] as a
[27:56] whisper and he had to and I thought is
[28:00] that my thinking and it come a little
[28:03] stronger listen to the anointed ones at
[28:05] the end time and I thought what I was
[28:08] praying about was really
[28:10] important and so I stopped again and
[28:14] then he come much stronger and said
[28:17] listen to the anointed ones at the end
[28:20] time so I got it from there and I said
[28:22] I'm going to listen to The Annoying ones
[28:23] at the end time and we had old real
[28:25] unreal players and then
[28:28] uh when I got toward the
[28:31] end brother Brandon was talking and he
[28:34] said you might think I was talking of
[28:38] myself being I'm packing this message I
[28:42] I I hope I don't get things wrong he
[28:44] said I was only near when he said and he
[28:46] said I am not the son of man he said I'm
[28:51] a son of man revealing the son of man he
[28:55] said the the son of man is Christ Jesus
[28:58] so you can tell how I felt but there was
[29:01] my
[29:02] answer but these these other times when
[29:05] he spoke to me in
[29:07] here I wasn't ever praying Lord Jesus
[29:11] show me this he did it by his grace and
[29:14] mercy wasn't me friends I tell you you
[29:19] know we were lost and wasn't done and
[29:22] with no hope without him God by his
[29:25] grace Sovereign Grace has p out his love
[29:29] and all in our in our
[29:31] days now I hope you can bear with me I'm
[29:34] going to read you something here and
[29:36] friends I I I didn't how many times I've
[29:39] listened to the seven
[29:41] seal and I didn't know this till the
[29:43] other day so please please understand
[29:47] it's not me it's him it's always been
[29:51] him and he said standing there when this
[29:54] left me something just come to me and
[29:57] said don't fear now I didn't hear no
[30:01] voice like on the inside of me
[30:04] spoke I just have to tell you the truth
[30:08] just exactly what happened something hit
[30:10] and said Don't Fear this is the third
[30:14] pull he said the third pull you remember
[30:19] and he said you've had so many
[30:21] impersonations on this what you tried to
[30:24] explain but said don't ever try this you
[30:28] remember it's how many remember the
[30:30] vision why it's all over it's taped and
[30:33] everywhere that's been about 6 years ago
[30:36] 7 years ago Ben 7 years ago said don't
[30:40] try to explain that said that's the this
[30:43] is the third pool and I'll meet you in
[30:46] there that's right amen he said don't
[30:50] try you remember the the 20 told about
[30:53] the three pools and the little fish and
[30:56] all and and uh he was the ministers got
[31:00] around him and said oh brother Bram you
[31:02] can do this you know and he said well I
[31:04] know something about fishing and he
[31:05] threw his line out there and he said he
[31:07] caught a fish but it was just barely
[31:09] over the skin Over The Lure and so when
[31:13] he was uh when he was uh trying I
[31:16] believe it's talking about uh explaining
[31:20] things and I I don't I can't get it all
[31:22] but he said the angel come you know come
[31:26] to him and and he said said I told you
[31:29] not to do that and and he was you know
[31:32] really repenting saying Lord you know
[31:34] I'm a poor servant and all but you know
[31:38] and then I know the Lord said it's you
[31:40] know the third pool it won't be an open
[31:43] show and we know it'll be here at the
[31:45] end time and it's for the bride and
[31:48] bride only and I I I had a lot of notes
[31:52] and things on the Rapture I left them
[31:55] all at home and other things I was going
[31:57] to do but I wanted to talk to our pastor
[32:01] first and see if it's okay to share this
[32:03] with you but the Lord will I I'll share
[32:07] some more things with you I I
[32:11] just I'll just say this you
[32:14] remember when Jesus told them about the
[32:18] Jews that when they seen these signs
[32:20] these things to get out of there don't
[32:24] go back to get anything and woe to hers
[32:27] that we stuck you know cuz she had to
[32:28] run with that baby he said get out and
[32:31] so those Jews that were attentive in
[32:34] watching what Jesus had told him to
[32:37] watch
[32:38] for they got out of there and brother
[32:41] randam said the others probably just
[32:43] stood around said we'll ask holy fathers
[32:45] for so and so to to pray you know and
[32:49] Titus went in there and and the Army and
[32:52] slaugh slaughtered every one of them men
[32:54] women and children and
[32:56] everything now
[32:58] they asked our lord Jesus the disciples
[33:01] what would be the sign of the time you
[33:04] know and all these he asked brother R
[33:06] said they asked him three questions he
[33:08] answered in three questions so I'm not
[33:11] going to get into that now but he had
[33:14] warned us two of things to watch for
[33:18] when was near like one thing was the Fig
[33:21] Tree he said when you see the Fig Tree
[33:23] given by you know that's Israel he said
[33:27] no it's not and even at the door so look
[33:30] where we're at and I I I don't want to
[33:33] go in I'm dry mouth and nervous so God

[44:32] we want amen when we come here we we
[44:36] want his him to have his way so God
[44:38] knows what we have need of and U also um
[44:42] wanted to um uh mention as well brother
[44:45] Homer was asking me to thank you for
[44:48] your prayers and uh he's he's he's he's
[44:51] doing doing better he's feeling better
[44:54] and so he asked me to say thank youen
[44:56] for
[44:57] that
[44:59] and so uh I know uh sister Carmen
[45:03] earlier had uh in the probably on Friday
[45:06] had text me about uh Little Little
[45:09] Caesar every time I hear it I think of
[45:13] pizza little
[45:15] Cesar I don't mean to take any moment
[45:17] out of it you know it's just a little
[45:19] funny little thing and uh cute little
[45:22] guy and and so he really uh was in need
[45:25] of a real touch from the Lord and with
[45:27] sickness and had pneumonia in one of his
[45:29] lungs but I just just had reached out to
[45:32] her again this morning uh she's um he's
[45:35] doing very well he's doing better amen
[45:38] so we thank God for that and we want to
[45:39] just continue to keep one another in
[45:41] prayer we uh you know if you don't see
[45:43] someone that's here just continue to
[45:45] just to hold them up in prayer amen amen
[45:49] well let's let's go ahead and stand and
[45:51] uh um I'm going to read this morning
[45:55] from actually from deuteron omy chapter
[45:57] 28
[45:59] and
[46:02] uh just be uh patient there with my wife
[46:06] she's uh running the slides a little bit
[46:08] and then I'll take
[46:09] over brother Brian and uh sister Susanna
[46:14] and the family they um have went to um
[46:18] to visit a family there in um in
[46:22] Arkansas and so I think I think with
[46:25] Arkansas you have to have a passport to
[46:27] get in there or something so they um
[46:31] they're there to visit family and um
[46:35] they
[46:37] so
[46:39] um I hope I can get this correct here I
[46:42] don't want that up there like that just
[46:44] go ahead and kick that off just go to
[46:46] Deuteronomy chapter
[46:49] 28 and Ben while oh never mind Paul go
[46:53] back on my desk and get my laptop would
[46:55] you please
[46:58] Deuteronomy chapter 28 and verse I'm
[47:01] sorry Deuteronomy
[47:16] 8 uh Deuteronomy 8 and verse 10 is where
[47:20] I want to
[47:24] begin I want you to notice these uh
[47:27] these words and God is and as many of
[47:30] the times in Deuteronomy they're getting
[47:32] ready to go into um into the land and
[47:35] God is admonishing them this is not only
[47:37] the season to take the land to go into
[47:40] it but he's also admonishing them of uh
[47:44] everything that they must do but also
[47:46] things that can actually uh come up that
[47:49] will hinder uh God from really doing
[47:53] what he wants to do in their life and I
[47:56] I want to say it like like this we know
[47:57] that we're we're in the hour thank you
[47:59] Paul we're in the hour where we're not
[48:02] called as the prophet said to a station
[48:05] meaning that the church in the days of
[48:07] Luther they were called back to there
[48:10] was God was working uh uh towards that
[48:12] of restoration but he called him into
[48:14] justification that was it right then
[48:17] here comes more of the word coming into
[48:19] Saint that's another station then the
[48:22] baptism of of of the Holy Ghost there at
[48:24] isza Street gifts are being restored
[48:26] that's another station but the bride's
[48:28] not called to another station there's
[48:30] not another message that's to come
[48:32] that's right we we now are coming into
[48:34] the place coming into the full
[48:37] inheritance and Christ Living in a
[48:40] people of God that he himself has
[48:43] Redeemed by his blood and where that in
[48:46] this hour God himself where he's longed
[48:48] for through all of the ages is to
[48:51] express himself as he did in the groom
[48:55] and through that first first little
[48:57] space of time that took place before the
[49:00] first church age ever opened that's good
[49:03] that's what God is bringing us back to
[49:05] that's that's Rapture condition where
[49:07] our lives are sealed away where there's
[49:09] within our hearts there's nothing in our
[49:12] hearts that would say nay or anything to
[49:15] God's word it would say Amen so be it so
[49:18] not only what we would say here but our
[49:20] whole lives even as God comes to uh
[49:23] correct us or and he has there is needs
[49:25] for correction in our our life as we're
[49:27] growing but the whole purpose is that we
[49:29] grow into the full stature of a perfect
[49:32] man amen don't you love him amen verse
[49:36] verse 10 here I don't mean to keep you
[49:37] standing but I want to just just feel to
[49:40] say that in verse 10 when thou Hast
[49:42] eaten and art full then Thou shalt bless
[49:46] the Lord thy God for the good which he
[49:50] hath given thee amen let's just bow our
[49:53] heads in a word of
[49:55] Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are
[49:59] standing here father this
[50:01] morning uh in a great need of your
[50:04] mercies once again Lord Jesus you
[50:08] certainly see father every every need
[50:11] Lord that's upon the hearts of your
[50:13] children father and we lord are asking
[50:17] God for your grace that you would help
[50:19] us that we collectively Lord can step
[50:22] aside father from just this physical
[50:25] address this morning Lord to also Lord
[50:28] to go beyond just the Lord the
[50:31] circumstances that would surround us
[50:33] Lord things that we would even know that
[50:35] we have before us things that are upon
[50:37] our hearts Lord we ask oh God that Lord
[50:41] that you would just give us Grace to
[50:43] move beyond all of those things Lord in
[50:45] your presence Lord where we lord receive
[50:48] the strength the direction the admition
[50:51] the leadership Lord for our lives that
[50:54] Lord then all of these other things Lord
[50:57] God you give us Lord the very uh Lord
[51:01] the ministering to the needs of all of
[51:04] these things to just show yourself Lord
[51:06] strong on our behalf oh God that you're
[51:09] mindful of every need and every request
[51:12] that we would have upon our hearts Lord
[51:14] for it's in even in these situations and
[51:17] things that arise that you permit Lord
[51:19] according to your Infinite Wisdom that
[51:21] you might display your glory Lord and
[51:24] father to recognize that we might
[51:26] recognize our weakness Lord and our need
[51:29] of you father we just invite you Lord
[51:32] that you would come be the speaker Lord
[51:33] be the hearer help us Lord to see where
[51:37] that our lives might be picked up Lord
[51:39] and where to apply these things for
[51:40] there is certainly the desire that moves
[51:43] in our hearts Lord we want to be found
[51:45] ready Lord our longing dear God is to
[51:48] father that as you come Lord we want to
[51:51] go with you Lord we just love you Lord
[51:54] we thank you for your mercies now may
[51:56] you come Among Us Lord and may you have
[51:58] complete preeminence we pray father in
[52:00] every heart every thought Lord every
[52:03] word that's said now in the name of
[52:05] Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you as
[52:08] you're being
[52:10] seated amen so I want to I want to if we
[52:15] could let's just continue to
[52:18] read uh that portion there in in the
[52:22] scripture in in uh the book of
[52:24] Deuteronomy there and I I want you just
[52:27] to to notice this this admonition there
[52:30] from where we read in verse 10 when when
[52:33] thou Hast eaten and
[52:35] Artful keep on going with the scriptures
[52:38] please when when thou Hast eaten and
[52:41] Artful then Thou shalt bless the Lord
[52:44] thy God for the good land which he hath
[52:46] given thee we we always the Bible says
[52:49] let everything be received with prayer
[52:52] and
[52:52] Thanksgiving and we would look at that
[52:55] and and think in one way to understand
[52:58] that before that even as we are seeking
[53:01] God's will upon many things but then
[53:03] even after we have as we've sought his
[53:05] will and when we recognize his
[53:08] leadership has come and then even as uh
[53:12] the direction in our lives and as God
[53:14] would provide and all of those things
[53:16] spiritually naturally all of the
[53:18] covering every part of our life that is
[53:20] a very key important time then Thou
[53:24] shalt bless the Lord thy God
[53:27] are you are you with me so it's it's
[53:30] it's a it's something that we don't want
[53:31] to be found like remember there was 10
[53:35] lepers nine all 10 of them were healed
[53:38] but there was only one who came back and
[53:41] said thank you and he worshiped and we
[53:44] don't ever want to we we don't want to
[53:47] be in that place and I I'll just say
[53:49] because we don't want to be in that
[53:51] place but we need God's grace always to
[53:54] bring us into that place and to remind
[53:55] us that we are what we are and where we
[53:58] are because of God's
[54:01] grace uh you know even through every
[54:04] aspect of our life so let me just
[54:06] continue to read here to kind of set
[54:08] this a little this background a little
[54:09] bit this morning in verse 11 it says
[54:12] beware that thou forget not the Lord thy
[54:15] God in not keeping his Commandments and
[54:18] his judgments and his statutes which I
[54:21] command thee this day lest when thou
[54:24] Hast eaten and art full and Hast built
[54:26] goodly houses and dwelt therein and when
[54:29] thy herds and thy flocks multiply and
[54:32] thy silver and thy gold is Multiplied
[54:34] and all that thou Hast is Multiplied
[54:37] then thine heart be lifted up and thou
[54:40] forget the Lord thy God which brought
[54:42] thee forth out of the land of Egypt from
[54:45] the house of bondage who led thee
[54:48] through the great and terrible
[54:49] Wilderness wherein were fiery serpents
[54:52] and scorpions and drought and where
[54:54] there was no water who brought thee for
[54:56] forth out of the rock of Flint who fed
[54:58] thee in the wilderness with Mana which
[55:01] thy fathers knew not that he might
[55:03] humble thee and that he might prove thee
[55:05] to do to do thee good at the latter end
[55:09] now that that word is would speak of as
[55:11] God would humble us it isn't this and I
[55:14] I'm just going to purposely say it it's
[55:17] not God degrading his people that's not
[55:19] how God humbles your eye but the way
[55:22] that God will humble your eye is to just
[55:25] let us see that our Humanity does not
[55:29] have the ability or the strength to
[55:31] bring to pass or to even bring us to
[55:35] where he has called us to to it must be
[55:40] him completely it's our Reliance on him
[55:43] now that it doesn't mean that we're just
[55:45] we're setting around we're being pushed
[55:47] we're being pulled but we're being led
[55:50] as the children of God because that's
[55:52] that's the difference remember uh cattle
[55:55] are hurted but sheep are LED we're we're
[55:58] not we're not cattle we're led by a
[56:00] Shepherd he's there to lead us we're not
[56:03] as goats that just you know we'll go
[56:05] find our own way but as a sheep now the
[56:08] thing of it is is that here within the
[56:10] midst of our life we were always uh
[56:14] sheep or Lamb of God and that's what the
[56:16] Holy Spirit comes to work upon he's not
[56:19] he's not come to change uh the goat and
[56:22] to make the goat a lamb no God has come
[56:25] to reveal what is UN beneath in our life
[56:29] and that is that part of him this is why
[56:32] when the word is come open and the and
[56:35] the seals are taken off this is why that
[56:38] our names are recorded in the Lamb's
[56:41] Book of Life it is his character his
[56:44] life what God's desire is that's being
[56:47] expressed that our hearts would lying to
[56:50] our hearts would be drawn to it would be
[56:53] God coming and turning around our will
[56:56] our desires to match his mind his
[57:00] thought what he desired so that when
[57:04] when when he has had his way in our life
[57:07] it might be able to be said and declared
[57:10] that it is Christ himself on display
[57:13] making his will known through our lives
[57:16] remember even with Israel going through
[57:18] their journey in the wilderness that it
[57:21] would even be expressed God would say
[57:23] that as they would live by the word that
[57:26] they were privileged to receive Moab was
[57:29] not privileged to have a true prophet of
[57:32] God other nations were not privileged to
[57:35] have a true prophet of God but in here
[57:38] in this and remember there were those
[57:40] who uh had a true prophet of God came
[57:43] out they were baptized in in the Red Sea
[57:46] unto Moses they walked by the cloud they
[57:48] ate Mana they drank water but they did
[57:51] not esteem the privilege to take into
[57:54] account why is all of this happening
[57:57] they were not able David said it like
[58:00] this our fathers understood not the
[58:04] Miracles which God did God was not just
[58:07] there to work miracles that's that's why
[58:10] when we recognize the ministry of
[58:12] Malachi 4 this is not a Ministry that is
[58:16] just a Ministry of Miracles but it is
[58:19] God coming to confirm his word and how
[58:22] do we know that that's his word what
[58:25] does The Voice say after the miracle has
[58:28] been done after the sign if the voice
[58:31] does not speak in harmony with God's
[58:34] word and leads us back to a man-made
[58:37] idea and takes us away from the word God
[58:41] never sent
[58:44] that remember that's a key key statement
[58:47] because the scripture says that false
[58:50] Christ would deceive many false anointed
[58:55] anointed even with a genuine Spirit even
[58:58] those like in the days of Micaiah
[59:00] remember it was a lying spirit that came
[59:03] upon those prophets that were there they
[59:06] were prophets but let me just tell you
[59:08] no matter who a man is I don't care who
[59:10] he is I don't care what his last name is
[59:12] I don't care how long he's preached it
[59:14] always should always be a place to look
[59:17] and say is this the word amen the Bibles
[59:21] didn't say try Every Man's last
[59:24] name it is say try every man to see if
[59:27] he's got the right picture try and see
[59:30] if he's got the right
[59:32] cliches and I don't mean to make light
[59:34] as though things are cliches but the
[59:36] Bible said try every spirit
[59:40] amen is that right cuz sometimes the
[59:43] wrong Spirits can get
[59:45] in right that's very true friends that's
[59:48] why we we have to be in the diligence
[59:51] doesn't mean that we sat around and
[59:52] we're apprehensive and we're uh you know
[59:55] like brother talks about the Canadian
[59:57] people up north and even he says pastors
[59:59] he said pastors are many times very
[1:00:02] conservative people he said they they're
[1:00:04] sat there they want to know what's
[1:00:06] coming in amongst their flocks what's
[1:00:08] what's being said and what certain
[1:00:10] things and he says you know he said but
[1:00:12] yet at sometimes we can be too
[1:00:14] conservative to where that it actually
[1:00:17] would just actually stifle out the
[1:00:19] moving of the Holy Spirit now I'm going
[1:00:21] to tell you I believe in the moving of
[1:00:23] the Holy Spirit but I welcome him to
[1:00:25] move according to his
[1:00:28] word is that all right that that's what
[1:00:31] because outside of that we recognize
[1:00:33] that look God will always he comes to
[1:00:36] move us in his word if he as brother REM
[1:00:38] said it over and over if he will just do
[1:00:41] what and fulfill every promise that he's
[1:00:43] given me in his word he said that will
[1:00:46] satisfy me amen how about you amen
[1:00:51] that's that's the blessing in this hour
[1:00:53] so when I when I'm looking at this on on
[1:00:56] all of this of of where we are standing
[1:00:58] in this moment and God is letting him
[1:01:00] know where he has brought them through
[1:01:03] where he has brought them from and he
[1:01:05] says in verse uh verse verse 17 and thou
[1:01:09] shalt say in thine heart my power all
[1:01:12] Verse 18 my power and my might my of
[1:01:15] mine hand hath gotten me this wealth my
[1:01:19] this is right away this is already
[1:01:21] something that where it begins to look
[1:01:23] at that what has been attributed around
[1:01:25] that that my power my might my my
[1:01:28] perseverance my my strength has gotten
[1:01:31] me this and God's letting them know no
[1:01:34] the only thing to remember even for you
[1:01:36] to have strength to put One Foot In
[1:01:38] Front Of Another it because God has
[1:01:41] encouraged you or I it's because God has
[1:01:44] has has given us what we have need of to
[1:01:47] obtain the things that he has even
[1:01:49] entrusted us with and I'll just say it
[1:01:51] like this I think we can all Fellowship
[1:01:53] on this point Lord you know what I have
[1:01:55] me of you know what I'm able to handle
[1:01:58] so I don't want anything but your will
[1:02:00] because anything that's outside of your
[1:02:02] will you know I would not be able to
[1:02:04] handle it it would become a hindrance in
[1:02:06] my life and my walk and would hinder you
[1:02:09] from fulfilling what you desire to do
[1:02:11] through me so just give me what I
[1:02:14] [Applause]
[1:02:15] need amen and if he does that my it'll
[1:02:18] be more than what we could even ask or
[1:02:21] think but notice as God would go on to
[1:02:23] say thou shalt remember the Lord thy God
[1:02:26] for it is he that giveth thee power to
[1:02:28] get wealth that he may establish his
[1:02:30] Covenant which he swear unto thy Fathers
[1:02:33] as it is this day so God's desire is
[1:02:37] that he says I want to make known what I
[1:02:40] have said through Abraham and through
[1:02:43] the prophets I want to make that known
[1:02:45] through you but we have but you must
[1:02:47] stay in a place to where I can make my
[1:02:50] word make myself make the blessings in
[1:02:53] other words we we don't want to be
[1:02:55] people that all all of a sudden we get
[1:02:56] to looking at what's happening around us
[1:02:58] and the blessings and as though that we
[1:03:00] ourselves are something that we have
[1:03:02] done something it's not us that has done
[1:03:05] something the Bible said let us be
[1:03:07] mindful we are the Sheep of his
[1:03:11] pasture it is not us that has changed
[1:03:13] our lives it is Christ that has changed
[1:03:16] our
[1:03:17] lives amen I know this is very very very
[1:03:21] simple but as the Lord just pressing
[1:03:23] Upon Our Hearts and it says in verse 19
[1:03:26] and it shall be if thou will do all if
[1:03:28] thou do it all forget the Lord thy God
[1:03:31] and walk after other gods and serve them
[1:03:34] and worship them I testify against you
[1:03:36] this day that ye shall utterly perish as
[1:03:41] the Nations which the Lord destroyed
[1:03:43] before your face so shall you perish
[1:03:46] because you would not be obedient unto
[1:03:49] the voice of the Lord your
[1:03:51] God God gave God gives a complete
[1:03:54] warning there to Israel and I I think of
[1:03:56] the first part when we open up if you
[1:03:59] want to go ahead uh switch it over there
[1:04:02] for me I want you to think of this here
[1:04:05] that how that within this on the
[1:04:07] overcoming of hindrances and how things
[1:04:10] so subtly you know Satan he doesn't care
[1:04:13] brother bab says it like this he says he
[1:04:16] doesn't care he says if he can he can
[1:04:19] hold you back from it or he can push you
[1:04:21] beyond where you need to be and pushing
[1:04:24] you beyond means meaning that you get
[1:04:26] way out here and we're not staying no
[1:04:29] longer in humility under the leading of
[1:04:32] the Holy Spirit and you know that we see
[1:04:34] examples of that through the scriptures
[1:04:36] we see examples then all the way through
[1:04:39] uh uh the New Testament and the Old
[1:04:41] Testament but God's desire is to keep us
[1:04:44] or that we would remain in a place to
[1:04:47] where he can work through our lives and
[1:04:48] let me just say it for we need the help
[1:04:50] of the Holy
[1:04:52] Spirit I'm just going to say it like
[1:04:54] that there's none of us can take
[1:04:56] trophies or ribbons or Metals as though
[1:04:58] to say well I have done this and I did
[1:05:00] this that God himself might be glorified
[1:05:02] in our lives I believe with all of my
[1:05:04] heart there is the simplest of things
[1:05:06] that we can do to continue to present
[1:05:08] ourselves before God but God even sees
[1:05:11] deeper than what we think of ourselves
[1:05:13] in our own mind and God knows what it
[1:05:16] takes within our lives to keep us in a
[1:05:18] place to where we are in position
[1:05:21] looking up to him who's the author and
[1:05:23] the finisher of our faith he knows
[1:05:25] exactly how to do that and here when you
[1:05:27] think about it you know as the scripture
[1:05:28] read out about how that you know when
[1:05:31] thou Hast eaten and art full I I think
[1:05:33] every one of us can uh uh think of that
[1:05:35] in a manner that how it feels when
[1:05:37] you're
[1:05:38] full sometimes you get
[1:05:40] sluggish it it's a time you probably
[1:05:42] need to get we need to go out and walk
[1:05:44] right but yet we feel like man if I can
[1:05:46] just make it to the chair if I can just
[1:05:47] make it from the table to the chair if I
[1:05:49] can just and we get sluggish our our
[1:05:51] body and and things you know that it
[1:05:53] just starts to bog down and God noticed
[1:05:55] when thou art eaten and are full that
[1:05:58] sometimes when we become full then we
[1:06:00] become
[1:06:02] sluggish we become slow we become you
[1:06:05] say you might say well I I'm praying
[1:06:07] every day and I'm and I I think friends
[1:06:09] listen the little things like that I I'm
[1:06:11] not making light of that those are
[1:06:13] little things that don't ever
[1:06:16] underestimate the little things that are
[1:06:18] done in that way because I just heard
[1:06:20] the prophet say this morning as he said
[1:06:23] it's those things he said of feeding on
[1:06:25] the word of God he says as you feed on
[1:06:28] God's word he said pray every day read
[1:06:30] your Bible he said because reading the
[1:06:33] word of God is what gives the Holy
[1:06:36] Spirit the ammo to work in your
[1:06:39] life so we don't want to you know go
[1:06:42] about that but neither do we want things
[1:06:45] to just become a tradition and a
[1:06:48] checklist because serving God is not a
[1:06:52] checklist he's our everything
[1:06:55] GL these are everything as a matter of
[1:06:58] fact can I say it like this the only
[1:07:00] reason we have things on our checklist
[1:07:02] is because of
[1:07:05] him it's because of him and I want to
[1:07:08] just you know look at it like this I
[1:07:10] wanted to create a visual and I was
[1:07:12] trying to in my mind just as it was
[1:07:14] coming to me of to look at it in this
[1:07:17] way that if we look at our lives and our
[1:07:20] walk with God you know we have all such
[1:07:23] things now they sell them you know a
[1:07:25] dime dozen organizers and they have
[1:07:27] little things you know and you can put
[1:07:29] this label here label here label here
[1:07:31] and it helps you to organize things you
[1:07:33] know pencils here pens here paper there
[1:07:35] line paper here folders all these
[1:07:37] different things that that we can do
[1:07:39] maybe in the laundry room you've got
[1:07:40] stain remover you got this you got that
[1:07:42] and there's certain things and maybe you
[1:07:43] don't have in drawers you just got them
[1:07:45] organized the way you put them on your
[1:07:46] washing machine or dryer but you get the
[1:07:48] point that sometimes things are so
[1:07:51] organized out and we've got this here
[1:07:53] and got that here but you got to
[1:07:55] remember and this is what we always have
[1:07:56] to keep before us is that God should
[1:07:59] never become a be limited to a
[1:08:03] compartment in our
[1:08:04] life he he don't want to he listen he'll
[1:08:07] take whatever we give him
[1:08:10] right you'll never find you'll never
[1:08:13] find God grumbling and
[1:08:15] complaining but all God's desire is is
[1:08:17] what he wants to do in your life in
[1:08:20] other words when he as he is coming
[1:08:22] fully in as we give ourselves fully to
[1:08:25] him God lets us know I've got your back
[1:08:28] I've got everything covered no matter
[1:08:30] what comes up I've got it covered
[1:08:32] because I am in control of your life I
[1:08:35] promise that I'll never fail you I'll
[1:08:37] never leave you I'll never forsake you I
[1:08:39] am your provider I am your sustainer he
[1:08:41] was letting Israel know right here that
[1:08:44] when you got out in the wilderness I was
[1:08:47] there to show you that when you didn't
[1:08:49] even think of certain things I was there
[1:08:53] you didn't think of water but I was your
[1:08:55] water water I knew you need water you
[1:08:57] didn't think of food but I already
[1:08:59] thought of it you did not think of
[1:09:01] clothing but I already provided that not
[1:09:04] one thread would wear through your shoes
[1:09:07] wouldn't wear out I've already got the
[1:09:09] things covered that you haven't even
[1:09:11] consider or thought
[1:09:14] about hallelujah how powerful is that
[1:09:18] that God watching over every part of it
[1:09:21] oh I tell you no wonder is God comes
[1:09:24] around in our lives the Holy Spirit
[1:09:26] dealing with our hearts to help us and
[1:09:29] Deliver Us from those times of
[1:09:31] sluggishness anybody like fing sluggish
[1:09:34] no I hate that I'm just being honest I
[1:09:37] don't like that feeling at all I don't
[1:09:39] like the feeling where you you eat and
[1:09:40] you feel bloated and you feel like
[1:09:41] you're miserable sometimes it isn't
[1:09:44] about the amount you've eating it's just
[1:09:45] the stuff you've ate right I mean you
[1:09:48] just you know but God help us in these
[1:09:52] places and he does help us to remember
[1:09:55] that I am your everything and so with
[1:09:58] back to those compartments we don't want
[1:10:00] to look at at we don't want to walk or
[1:10:02] look at our walk with God as though it's
[1:10:05] just this part of my life and then I've
[1:10:07] got these other things but if we can
[1:10:09] look at it in the right way and God help
[1:10:12] us to see it in this way and always keep
[1:10:13] it there to imagine it so that it's just
[1:10:16] like this that all of this right here
[1:10:18] it's him but we want to always be
[1:10:21] looking in him to see what step to make
[1:10:25] next next in other words when it comes
[1:10:27] whether it's to jobs with relationships
[1:10:29] friends whatever if I've got to look
[1:10:32] outside of him I don't need it I want to
[1:10:35] know what does he say because if it's in
[1:10:39] him then not only will it be a blessing
[1:10:42] to me but I'll be able to do or receive
[1:10:46] whatever he said and be a blessing to
[1:10:48] somebody
[1:10:49] else that's where we want to keep it in
[1:10:51] that way right
[1:10:55] watch this in the
[1:10:57] scripture very familiar scripture I am
[1:11:00] the vine you are the branches and he
[1:11:04] that abideth in me and I in him the same
[1:11:06] bringeth forth much fruit for without me
[1:11:10] you can do
[1:11:13] nothing say Amen to that it's true Lord
[1:11:17] I can do nothing without you you might
[1:11:19] say well I have a degree but who gave
[1:11:21] you the ability who gave you that Talent
[1:11:24] amen who gave you the gift that's in
[1:11:26] your life that you didn't even know was
[1:11:28] there that's right who gave who who
[1:11:31] placed that God placed that in you and
[1:11:34] then God begin to bring all of that
[1:11:36] begins to be brought out of your life
[1:11:39] because God is Jehovah Gyra he will not
[1:11:42] be indebted to nobody he has already
[1:11:46] provided for himself what he's placed in
[1:11:48] your life all even the I'm talking about
[1:11:50] even the natural abilities God has
[1:11:53] placed it there even for the word work
[1:11:55] we do for the things that we do God has
[1:11:57] placed that there if we're really really
[1:11:59] honest it's not a school that taught us
[1:12:02] these
[1:12:03] things I sat there in teacher courses
[1:12:06] that when we were going through and I
[1:12:07] had some people that were really you
[1:12:08] know they were they were breaking down
[1:12:10] and and they were we had such a meeting
[1:12:12] I didn't know what the meeting was about
[1:12:13] and a rush in there and these
[1:12:15] individuals they're they're just you
[1:12:16] know they're they're really CU they feel
[1:12:17] like I'm not getting I feel like I'm
[1:12:19] everything's not coming together and I
[1:12:20] feel like this and I I'm just being
[1:12:22] honest I was Sting right there and I
[1:12:24] thought well you know I really don't
[1:12:26] feel that way I don't know really what
[1:12:28] to say uh to them but you know this is
[1:12:31] what then eventually I listen to
[1:12:33] everything that was said because you
[1:12:34] know they were complaining about the
[1:12:36] professors and they didn't do enough and
[1:12:38] they didn't do the and and it what just
[1:12:39] struck my heart and I I I just said it
[1:12:42] in this way I said look I said I think I
[1:12:45] understand what you all are saying that
[1:12:46] sometimes you're wanting to say you want
[1:12:48] more Direction I said but you got to
[1:12:51] understand what they're doing is giving
[1:12:52] us a framework and within that framework
[1:12:55] this is where your certain talents your
[1:12:58] certain things the way that you bring
[1:12:59] things about that's how that's to thrive
[1:13:02] I said let me just say it to you that
[1:13:04] here I am I said in this with with all
[1:13:06] the rest of you my colleagues but I want
[1:13:08] you to understand yes I'll have to have
[1:13:10] this certification in order to obtain a
[1:13:12] job I said but you know what I was
[1:13:14] always a teacher that's right I was
[1:13:17] always a teacher I said they they they
[1:13:19] are not making me a teacher they're just
[1:13:21] helping me to tap in to a framework of
[1:13:24] thinking
[1:13:25] of how to be a
[1:13:27] teacher that's why they're making us do
[1:13:29] the extensive things on lesson plans
[1:13:32] that end up being for one subject 45
[1:13:35] minutes end up being three pages
[1:13:39] long it's reflective thought when in
[1:13:42] reality when you go to teach you get to
[1:13:44] a spot I've got one sentence of an
[1:13:46] objective and then it's just 45 minutes
[1:13:48] long and more than that you see one
[1:13:50] thing but what it is cuz see the
[1:13:52] framework has taught us to be reflective
[1:13:54] my point point is is this what God has
[1:13:56] placed in you even in our natural
[1:13:58] abilities that's the same way it is
[1:14:00] spiritually in your life this is why
[1:14:03] that there's things in our life when we
[1:14:05] look at spiritually that God has called
[1:14:07] us to operate in the framework of the
[1:14:10] Holy Ghost we're not to operate outside
[1:14:12] of that but God in Christ God came down
[1:14:16] and ex and exemplified you once an
[1:14:18] example of what he's called you and I to
[1:14:20] be in the body of Jesus Christ so it's
[1:14:23] so in other words what follow now it's
[1:14:25] not you or me trying to replicate
[1:14:28] someone else but it's seeking after God
[1:14:32] for all that God would have you be
[1:14:34] that's part of the journey is Lord bring
[1:14:37] out of my life where that hunger is
[1:14:40] coming from where that thirst is coming
[1:14:42] from I didn't put that there but there's
[1:14:45] a hunger there's a deep there's a
[1:14:47] longing for God there's a desire for
[1:14:49] more of God and so in the framework of
[1:14:53] the Holy Spirit we can call call upon
[1:14:55] God and that in itself is the beginnings
[1:14:58] of humility to look to
[1:15:01] him good Hallelujah without me you can
[1:15:05] do nothing right I want to just take
[1:15:08] maybe for a few moments here of this
[1:15:11] example this is very key if you abide in
[1:15:14] me that word dwell or remain in me and
[1:15:18] my words abide in you these are his
[1:15:21] words his thoughts right how many times
[1:15:26] that where the word of God after the
[1:15:28] word has been expressed and it's been
[1:15:31] spoken I I'm dealing with this on
[1:15:33] hindrance I'm dealing with this on Pride
[1:15:36] I want you just to I want you just to
[1:15:38] think about this just say God just speak
[1:15:40] to my heart if ye abide in me this is
[1:15:44] dwelling in him the scripture says if we
[1:15:49] if we live in him if my life your life
[1:15:53] has been immersed into Christ and if it
[1:15:55] hasn't fully yet just say just say to
[1:15:58] the Lord like every one of us would say
[1:16:00] Lord take me deeper take me deeper to
[1:16:04] every desire is rid from my life you
[1:16:07] know what that is as here his presence
[1:16:09] is around and dealing with our life it's
[1:16:12] asking God to go deeper in our lives but
[1:16:15] as we live in him let us also walk in
[1:16:19] him that's where Paul says for if we
[1:16:22] walk in him you shall not fulfill the
[1:16:24] lust of of the
[1:16:25] flesh that's that's our power that's our
[1:16:28] source of strength not our knowledge no
[1:16:30] yet yet we do need knowledge we need
[1:16:33] Holy Ghost knowledge of the word is that
[1:16:35] right we need that we need the spirit of
[1:16:38] God but listen when God gives us Divine
[1:16:40] knowledge it will always be a revelation
[1:16:43] and there's Faith accompanied with that
[1:16:45] knowledge and between that faith and
[1:16:47] knowledge is
[1:16:49] virtue is strength in our life for that
[1:16:51] word to live out in our
[1:16:53] life but if you abide in me and my words
[1:16:56] abide in you think about it taking
[1:16:58] taking after a service after a service
[1:17:01] after the ministry and the word is over
[1:17:03] what what what do we do do we take that
[1:17:06] and just say that was a wonderful
[1:17:08] service
[1:17:09] today man there was some good things
[1:17:10] that was said there or do we recognize
[1:17:13] that wait a minute all of those things
[1:17:15] can be true because it's things that
[1:17:17] pertain to us but what are we doing with
[1:17:19] that word are we taking that word just
[1:17:22] even right there as the service itself
[1:17:24] has come coming down and really praying
[1:17:27] over that where he's touched our hearts
[1:17:29] and saying God be it unto me Lord
[1:17:31] according to your word I don't want to
[1:17:33] let it slip out because let me tell you
[1:17:35] something the prophet tells us in Christ
[1:17:37] The Mystery of God revealed he said God
[1:17:39] is trying to reveal himself to you but
[1:17:42] we let so many things get it out of
[1:17:46] us that's why we want to say Lord let it
[1:17:49] be drilled down deep this is why even in
[1:17:51] the after service even in the worship
[1:17:53] this is why it's it's a time of entering
[1:17:55] into prayer it's a time of real
[1:17:57] solemnness why that the word this is why
[1:18:00] the prophet said after the word has gone
[1:18:02] forth let the Holy Spirit Come and water
[1:18:06] that word
[1:18:10] in the trth Sam what are you saying
[1:18:13] don't stop seeking after
[1:18:16] him don't stop seeking after him we if
[1:18:19] we've grown beyond that we've grown
[1:18:21] beyond God
[1:18:25] if you abide in me so the words even as
[1:18:27] they dwell in our lives and we're taking
[1:18:30] them day by day I want you just I want
[1:18:33] to just take this little little portion
[1:18:35] I realize I'm not going to get all the
[1:18:37] way through into the next part and I
[1:18:39] really didn't think I would here in this
[1:18:42] today but just in this part staying with
[1:18:46] the real kernel and you you know what a
[1:18:49] konel is it's the it's the life of that
[1:18:53] seed
[1:18:55] what that life is all about staying with
[1:18:58] the real kernel of it we don't want to
[1:19:01] get caught up in all of this out here I
[1:19:02] want to stay with the real Colonel
[1:19:04] because if we're stay with the right
[1:19:05] colel then everything everything else
[1:19:08] all that God desires to add he'll
[1:19:11] add are you with me you know because we
[1:19:14] don't have to add the feathers the
[1:19:16] feathers will come out we don't have to
[1:19:18] manufacture wool the wool will come
[1:19:21] out so notice here in the scripture
[1:19:24] there's a man and we're familiar many of
[1:19:26] us as Bible readers are familiar with
[1:19:28] this this man by the name of Uzziah and
[1:19:31] the Bible says as he was 16 years old
[1:19:35] when he took the reign of the throne and
[1:19:38] the Bible says in verse four he did that
[1:19:41] which was right in the sight of the Lord
[1:19:45] according to all that his father amazi
[1:19:48] did and he sought God in the days of
[1:19:52] Zachariah who had understanding in the
[1:19:54] visions of God and as long as he sought
[1:19:58] the Lord God made him to
[1:20:01] prosper now what was the key as long as
[1:20:04] he sought the
[1:20:06] Lord but when when when he would pull
[1:20:10] back from seeking the Lord then that's
[1:20:13] when things themselves was ass signed of
[1:20:16] something already going
[1:20:17] on are you with me now sometimes the
[1:20:21] things that can be seen out here
[1:20:22] remember are only attributes
[1:20:25] of what's going on
[1:20:27] inwardly so here is here is
[1:20:30] Uzziah and God has made him to prosper
[1:20:34] this man was he was a great man even at
[1:20:38] 16 years old and you have to wonder
[1:20:41] within the scripture where Paul would
[1:20:42] talk about let not a young one you know
[1:20:45] coming to that place of rulership and
[1:20:48] Leadership Paul would write in Timothy
[1:20:50] lest he said like a novice lest they
[1:20:52] become lifted up in Pride you know it's
[1:20:54] something about that through age and
[1:20:56] Through Time really through not just
[1:20:58] time I want to say it like this because
[1:21:01] time itself may change how we look
[1:21:03] outwardly but time alone doesn't change
[1:21:06] who we
[1:21:06] are it it takes the Holy Spirit coming
[1:21:10] and working with our lives through tests
[1:21:13] and through trials and as we are yielded
[1:21:16] and he will mold us and make us that's
[1:21:19] where real wisdom is real wisdom isn't
[1:21:22] in that we don't have hair or you've got
[1:21:24] Bray hair or that we're a certain year a
[1:21:26] certain o age or you know we're 65 years
[1:21:29] old or what that that that does not
[1:21:31] attribute always to wisdom because
[1:21:33] remember ELO sat right there when there
[1:21:36] were other Brethren with job and he said
[1:21:39] he was he respected his elders and he
[1:21:41] said I I looked at let age
[1:21:46] speak but he saw ell who could see that
[1:21:50] it wasn't any wisdom that was coming but
[1:21:53] Earthly wisdom that's right is that
[1:21:55] right and really our desire is is that
[1:21:58] we will we desire Lord I want that
[1:22:01] effect of that Heavenly wisdom upon my
[1:22:04] life amen so it's through the the
[1:22:07] multitude of our test and our trials now
[1:22:09] listen friends we can Fellowship on this
[1:22:11] there's there's individuals We've ran
[1:22:13] into that because of circumstances of
[1:22:15] life that there's not there's things
[1:22:17] that within their life instead of
[1:22:19] instead of allowing the grace of God to
[1:22:21] come and really seek after God to remedy
[1:22:25] anything that would be in their life
[1:22:26] instead of after all it's said and done
[1:22:29] they become
[1:22:30] bitter and there's no benefit their
[1:22:33] lives themselves in their lives it
[1:22:35] begins a destruction in their life and
[1:22:38] then it also is things that has an
[1:22:40] effect whether it's on family whether
[1:22:42] it's on others we don't want our lives
[1:22:44] crowned with bitterness Hallelujah no
[1:22:48] matter of the bitter experiences let's
[1:22:50] separate that now there are bitter
[1:22:53] experiences but experiences that would
[1:22:56] come our way or an opportunity to
[1:22:58] recognize God though I don't see you but
[1:23:01] like you showed Moses show me yourself
[1:23:04] Lord so that I can bring you into this
[1:23:07] place in my life for you will sweeten
[1:23:10] the Waters of
[1:23:14] Mara cuz then we all have bitter
[1:23:16] experiences we all have those kinds of
[1:23:18] failures we all have those things but
[1:23:20] listen don't allow bitter experiences to
[1:23:23] corrupt you
[1:23:25] that is so
[1:23:26] good don't allow them to where you
[1:23:28] become better in your life say God give
[1:23:31] me Grace let the sweetness of the holy
[1:23:33] spirit let me stay in the presence there
[1:23:36] of almighty God that he'll sweeten the
[1:23:39] waters in my life is that right because
[1:23:42] Waters themselves can represent a
[1:23:44] thickness in multitudes of
[1:23:46] people is that right we need his grace
[1:23:50] to sweeten our Liv but look at look at
[1:23:52] Uzziah the Bible says in verse verse 15
[1:23:55] I'm skipping on down on that chapter he
[1:23:57] made in Jerusalem engines this man was a
[1:24:01] very uh Ingenuity had much Ingenuity
[1:24:05] about him he invented by cunning men to
[1:24:08] be on the towers and upon the bullworks
[1:24:10] to shoot arrows and great stones with
[1:24:13] all and his name spread far abroad for
[1:24:17] he was marvelously helped
[1:24:20] till he was strong
[1:24:24] but when he was strong his heart was
[1:24:27] lifted up to his destruction so for he
[1:24:31] transgressed against the Lord his God
[1:24:34] and went into the Temple of the Lord to
[1:24:36] burn incense upon the altar of incense
[1:24:40] let's just watch how brother Brown will
[1:24:42] will take this here many places how many
[1:24:45] familiar brother bran preaches on
[1:24:46] influence countless times influence one
[1:24:49] of another it's is a is a real key
[1:24:52] message in this hour cuz this is listen
[1:24:55] when you're listening to the message of
[1:24:57] the hour I'm not going to let you read
[1:24:58] it ahead of me when you're listening to
[1:25:00] the message of the hour I want you to
[1:25:02] understand those titles are not
[1:25:04] brainstorming operations amen it is it
[1:25:08] is announcements by God it's what God is
[1:25:12] Desiring to do in our lives it's what
[1:25:15] God is calling us out from the influence
[1:25:19] of man-made ideas calling us away from
[1:25:22] the
[1:25:23] influence of of of of our own even of
[1:25:26] our own reasoning into where that we
[1:25:28] become completely under the influence of
[1:25:31] the Holy Spirit by the new birth and
[1:25:34] ever remain
[1:25:37] there praise the Lord notice
[1:25:41] this when a man or woman no matter
[1:25:43] whether he's a bishop or a cardinal so
[1:25:45] position don't matter whatever he might
[1:25:47] be when you begin to feel that you are
[1:25:51] self-reliant then you better begin to
[1:25:54] watch watch and take heed so it's even
[1:25:56] you know that in itself is a real
[1:25:58] blessing to where when when you and I
[1:26:00] could begin to feel I feel you know I'm
[1:26:02] starting to feel self-reliant well well
[1:26:04] how do I know what's the diagnosis that
[1:26:05] I'm actually going about my day without
[1:26:08] seeking
[1:26:10] him well brother Samuel I you know I'm
[1:26:12] driving in the car God's not restricted
[1:26:14] to a prayer closet the Bible said pray
[1:26:17] without ceasing even when you're getting
[1:26:19] ready to go into work it's things listen
[1:26:21] even when for myself let me give you an
[1:26:23] example even when I as I was teaching
[1:26:25] school I had taught fractions and
[1:26:27] Division and those things countless
[1:26:29] times I know it seems like that seems
[1:26:30] like ABC things but listen for when I'm
[1:26:33] teaching nine and 10 year olds sometimes
[1:26:35] every year that seem to be challenging
[1:26:37] things and I would ask God Lord help me
[1:26:40] with this subject here in teaching
[1:26:43] because these are different students if
[1:26:45] there's a way that I need to present it
[1:26:47] if there's a certain way Lord give me
[1:26:49] the wisdom on how to do it I could have
[1:26:51] just taken it and said you know what I
[1:26:53] know how to do do it I could just go in
[1:26:56] and do
[1:26:57] it it would be like myself as a teacher
[1:27:00] okay as myself as a teacher you get to a
[1:27:02] spot you're like H I've already taught
[1:27:04] I've already taught 15 years fourth
[1:27:06] grade I know this like the back of my
[1:27:07] hand I know where we're going next I
[1:27:09] know what's coming next I can finish
[1:27:11] this quote I mean I already know what's
[1:27:13] coming here and then it begins to just
[1:27:15] be like I don't need to put any effort
[1:27:17] in that's so good I don't need to put
[1:27:19] any it's like a minister that gets to
[1:27:21] such a place to where that he feels like
[1:27:24] he has such a handle on the word that's
[1:27:26] a real real dangerous place because when
[1:27:29] he gets to that spot he not only you
[1:27:32] begin to see it in the way that it can
[1:27:34] actually begin to present itself to the
[1:27:36] people it begins to look at it that I'm
[1:27:38] here you're down here but to recognize
[1:27:41] there's never to be a place I know
[1:27:43] sometimes we use that but to understand
[1:27:45] it in the manner of that I'm talking
[1:27:46] about being getting a handle on the word
[1:27:48] of God it really is to where that God
[1:27:50] got a handle on our lives and where the
[1:27:53] revelation itself has got a handle on
[1:27:55] our lives and to recognize I I don't
[1:27:58] know how you feel but this is how I feel
[1:28:00] I don't have less questions I've got
[1:28:02] more questions my questions are not
[1:28:04] whether this is the Vindicated truth or
[1:28:06] not that is not it at all but there are
[1:28:09] things that as I go on in steud I'm just
[1:28:11] telling the Lord that here this week as
[1:28:13] I was walking through here praying I
[1:28:15] said Lord within that certain quote that
[1:28:17] you opened up there's also another part
[1:28:19] within there Lord would you teach me and
[1:28:22] show me even as I was praying on some
[1:28:24] things with Ruth and the gate and all of
[1:28:26] those things show me Lord help me to see
[1:28:28] it Lord in the way that you want me to
[1:28:31] see it in order to bring it you say what
[1:28:33] do you say that it doesn't matter
[1:28:35] there's many quotes that I have that God
[1:28:37] would allow my memory I could spit right
[1:28:40] out to you but even though in the times
[1:28:42] that I would know him I still want to
[1:28:44] look back over him when he brings things
[1:28:46] if there's a subject if there's a topic
[1:28:49] because you know why with God there is
[1:28:51] no end there is no no Summit in
[1:28:56] God the very moment that we feel like
[1:28:59] we've got a handle on it I've got a
[1:29:01] handle on this message is the very
[1:29:04] moment we're
[1:29:08] backslid let me just share something
[1:29:10] with you even over the years oh yeah
[1:29:14] I've had Satan come right up next to me
[1:29:16] and say look at you you're understanding
[1:29:18] of this right here why you don't need to
[1:29:20] quote brother Brenham you don't you
[1:29:22] don't need to go through this look at
[1:29:23] how your understanding of the scriptures
[1:29:26] you say what did you say I said you liar
[1:29:29] I would not even understand these things
[1:29:31] had God not sent his prophet and the
[1:29:33] spirit of God revealing through his
[1:29:35] ordained Channel I would be like anybody
[1:29:38] else I would have the word on a new card
[1:29:41] but because of the grace of God and God
[1:29:43] sending a prophet with thus sayith the
[1:29:46] Lord From The Throne then we have a
[1:29:49] confidence to follow because I see it
[1:29:52] it's in my heart and I see it what
[1:29:54] working this gospel
[1:29:57] [Applause]
[1:29:58] Works Hallelujah I'm not relying upon my
[1:30:01] understanding the Bible said lean not to
[1:30:04] thine own understanding I don't care how
[1:30:06] much we know of the scriptures I still
[1:30:09] want God to make his word alive and to
[1:30:12] make it
[1:30:13] real we still need the holy ghost coming
[1:30:17] as strong or stronger than ever in the
[1:30:20] midst of our
[1:30:22] services let me tell you something
[1:30:24] brother or sister the third pull did not
[1:30:27] remove the moving of the Holy
[1:30:29] Ghost man removed that man's
[1:30:34] ideas that shows there's a lack of that
[1:30:37] Revelation because the real third pull
[1:30:39] is Christ himself in The Believer deity
[1:30:43] coming to Tabernacle inside of you God
[1:30:47] calling you and I to a deeper walk a
[1:30:50] deeper humility a deeper submission am
[1:30:53] Hallelujah
[1:30:55] prise the Lord and that of the third
[1:30:57] three pools it may be terminology a
[1:31:00] little new to you but Jesus first pull
[1:31:02] he went out Miracles were
[1:31:05] done second pull the healings were done
[1:31:09] Miracles but the third pole is where he
[1:31:11] makes a stand except you eat the Flesh
[1:31:14] of the son of man and drink his blood in
[1:31:16] other words become one with the God who
[1:31:20] is making himself known by his promised
[1:31:25] [Music]
[1:31:26] word become one with him not just sit
[1:31:28] around where the blessings are but to
[1:31:30] become one with him become one with him
[1:31:33] and let him work out in our life and
[1:31:35] it's him it's him we're growing we don't
[1:31:37] start out fully matured Sons and
[1:31:39] Daughters of God we
[1:31:42] grow in Grace and
[1:31:44] knowledge can you say Amen to that but
[1:31:47] we we don't want to grow in knowledge
[1:31:49] and then in Grace it won't work right
[1:31:51] because if you grow in knowledge first
[1:31:53] you really won't grow Grace but as you
[1:31:55] grow in Grace remember staying in a
[1:31:57] place that Lord you're my everything
[1:31:59] you're all that I have need of then God
[1:32:01] can add to us he will speak to us not
[1:32:04] Earthly knowledge not just knowledge to
[1:32:07] where we have enough knowledge about
[1:32:09] scriptures to argue it it won't come
[1:32:11] that way it will come by the divine
[1:32:13] grace of God moving down in our life by
[1:32:16] the sweetness of the Holy Spirit it will
[1:32:18] become an absolute action in our lives
[1:32:24] notice my God won't let you go like that
[1:32:27] aren't you
[1:32:28] glad because he will not share his glory
[1:32:31] with anyone no sir God takes Glory
[1:32:36] alone sometimes God can bless a man and
[1:32:40] give him a little Ministry and that's
[1:32:41] maybe a little bit better than his
[1:32:43] Brethren or not better but just
[1:32:45] something a little different from his
[1:32:48] Brethren and the first thing you know
[1:32:51] that man becomes exalted with his chest
[1:32:53] out
[1:32:54] he would brush you off the street that's
[1:32:57] the time that I believe that man is
[1:32:59] started out the door cuz God can't use a
[1:33:04] person like
[1:33:07] that so you mean God would actually
[1:33:09] entrust someone that maybe be a little
[1:33:12] bit more gifted in a certain way and God
[1:33:16] would present that now he's not God
[1:33:17] listen me tell you God's not afraid of
[1:33:19] his sheep he's not because remember
[1:33:21] we're a part of him the Bible said there
[1:33:24] would be those they said the elect with
[1:33:26] what was going on the elect they would
[1:33:28] be deceived if it were possible but it's
[1:33:31] not possible because we are a part of
[1:33:33] the word your mind or your thoughts
[1:33:36] might be getting around and might look
[1:33:38] at this and might look at that you might
[1:33:40] say well I know this has been said and
[1:33:42] this was done and they said this they
[1:33:43] spoke this and God answered this and did
[1:33:45] this and did this but listen don't get
[1:33:47] caught up in what all the signs and
[1:33:49] wonders right is that what God warned
[1:33:52] him in Deuteronomy he said do not he
[1:33:54] said you listen to what they're saying
[1:33:56] right listen to what they're saying
[1:33:59] because listen because signs and wonders
[1:34:01] just that alone if it's not coming with
[1:34:04] you say saying what they said yes it's
[1:34:06] not us putting an interpretation to
[1:34:09] God's word it's not us coming and all of
[1:34:11] a sudden we've studied the message long
[1:34:13] enough and I'm able to tell you what
[1:34:15] brother brandham meant here this is
[1:34:16] Brother bram's opinion here this is
[1:34:18] Brother bram's opinion here let me tell
[1:34:19] you what that is self-righteous Pride
[1:34:22] that's right right refusing to stay in a
[1:34:25] god-given position doesn't matter how
[1:34:28] long that we preach the word doesn't
[1:34:30] matter how long we walked with the word
[1:34:32] look it would be just like you as a
[1:34:34] husband or wife or family that all of a
[1:34:36] sudden here in coming and fellowshipping
[1:34:38] under the word of God and then you would
[1:34:40] begin to go in and dissect the word of
[1:34:43] God and somehow splice the token life as
[1:34:46] though it don't apply here it does apply
[1:34:48] there oh this isn't necessary that's
[1:34:50] just a little fanatical that's just a
[1:34:52] little over theboard where did you get
[1:34:55] your Vindication or leadership to go in
[1:34:58] that
[1:34:59] way there is no peace or safety in that
[1:35:03] but there is peace and
[1:35:05] safety in staying with the word of
[1:35:09] God hallelujah when battles come your
[1:35:12] way Trials come your way I see as he
[1:35:15] rose up there zedekiah when they were
[1:35:18] all compassed about with battles and it
[1:35:21] says they that heed to the pro of God to
[1:35:25] God's word that God will strengthen and
[1:35:28] prosper his people
[1:35:30] hallelujah you believe that that's so
[1:35:33] good but see how it can come just one
[1:35:34] little slight little thing oh and it can
[1:35:37] be so subtle how Pride will come
[1:35:40] in let me tell you something I don't
[1:35:42] care who the man is I don't care how
[1:35:44] long he's been preaching I don't care
[1:35:46] what his name is no man has a right to
[1:35:49] assert himself over the Vindicated
[1:35:52] message of the hour
[1:35:55] when a man begins to put his ideas to
[1:35:57] that right there that man if he don't
[1:35:59] quickly if he don't take take the grace
[1:36:01] of God that's com into his life he is on
[1:36:03] his way out the door I don't care how
[1:36:06] many followers he has I don't care all
[1:36:08] those other things listen cuz God will
[1:36:10] not share his glory with no
[1:36:13] personality listen friends our strength
[1:36:16] what what was uzziah's strength how did
[1:36:18] Uzziah pick out that this man's got a
[1:36:20] gift in his life to build these certain
[1:36:22] types of engines and and catapults and
[1:36:24] and this who was it that gifted him in
[1:36:27] that way he was 16 years old it was the
[1:36:30] grace of
[1:36:31] God he was doing all that God had showed
[1:36:36] through his father amaziah and when he
[1:36:39] was doing that God blessed he blessed it
[1:36:43] that's right strongholds were built
[1:36:46] up but then as it got to a place he got
[1:36:49] the note doubt maybe maybe it was just a
[1:36:51] whisper whisper that came in look at
[1:36:56] you man you've done a lot better than
[1:36:58] the rest of the Kings look at you look
[1:37:01] how things have been built up man look
[1:37:03] at how everything is going it's just so
[1:37:07] so wonderful you know what
[1:37:09] happened he got his eyes to looking upon
[1:37:13] the things that had come about from when
[1:37:17] he was really keeping his eyes on
[1:37:20] God he got his eyes on things
[1:37:24] instead of keeping it on
[1:37:25] God did you hear me he got eyes and
[1:37:29] looking at these things because look
[1:37:30] look look look that that's where the
[1:37:32] church Worlds at today oh God's blessing
[1:37:34] us how do you know he gave us a we we
[1:37:36] got a we got a mega building we got this
[1:37:38] we got that God's really blessing us and
[1:37:39] look there's times where God will show
[1:37:41] blessings in that way but listen the
[1:37:43] only thing that we can actually have a
[1:37:45] true litmus test we could go into the
[1:37:47] doctor and say I feel good everything's
[1:37:49] great and whatever more but scans and
[1:37:50] tests do not lie that's right no matter
[1:37:53] how good we feel so that's the same
[1:37:54] thing about even when it comes to our
[1:37:56] feelings it's got to come to a place to
[1:37:59] where we we say God there's the desire
[1:38:01] is to be with you be in step with you in
[1:38:04] such a way that I do not want my
[1:38:06] feelings to influence
[1:38:09] me I want the word to influence
[1:38:12] me I want to know where am I standing
[1:38:15] God be honest with me Lord take men of
[1:38:17] God take brothers and sisters Lord show
[1:38:20] me Lord I want to see in your word when
[1:38:22] I'm in times of o when I'm listening to
[1:38:25] the message of the hour that it just
[1:38:26] does not become just something that's
[1:38:29] just keeps on it's just natural it
[1:38:31] becomes tradition I don't want it to be
[1:38:33] a tradition God restore to me Lord God
[1:38:37] that that love that I had Lord that
[1:38:39] first love that I had Lord where you're
[1:38:41] reaching out to
[1:38:46] God yes
[1:38:49] sir everybody
[1:38:52] okay let me just I I want to read the
[1:38:54] words how the prophet says it he says
[1:38:56] this King got to a place being such a
[1:38:58] great man and influencing Isaiah so he
[1:39:01] was an influence on Isaiah's life and
[1:39:03] the righteous of course of his kingdom
[1:39:05] he got to a place he got feeling
[1:39:09] self-cured and there's where you make
[1:39:10] your mistake there is where so many
[1:39:12] righteous men bite the dust of Shame
[1:39:15] bite of dust of defeat is because they
[1:39:17] begin to feel
[1:39:19] self-secure you begin to think now
[1:39:22] notice notice where it starts
[1:39:24] thinking that you have lived so long for
[1:39:26] Christ that no matter what he presents
[1:39:29] before you you'll take your choice
[1:39:33] whether you want to or not now remember
[1:39:36] God might have a variety of ways to
[1:39:38] present that to you and I God can work
[1:39:40] right through his offices think about it
[1:39:42] God will work right through the gifts
[1:39:44] that he's placed right here among us to
[1:39:47] minister to us to see that we don't miss
[1:39:50] the word of God and I would just say
[1:39:52] like this I believe that as real people
[1:39:54] of God I'm not telling you just to take
[1:39:55] my word for it I don't want to come up
[1:39:57] here and preach Samuel Browning's
[1:39:58] thoughts but if there's something in
[1:40:00] there that just seems like to you that
[1:40:02] Lord I I maybe don't see this but help
[1:40:04] me to see it that's seeking after God
[1:40:07] seeking after God doesn't mean that you
[1:40:09] understand everything no more than it
[1:40:11] does that I understand everything God
[1:40:13] has it in such a way that he'll keep so
[1:40:15] much that he'll keep you and I seeking
[1:40:18] after him reaching out for him I'm glad
[1:40:20] he does it that way I'm glad that he
[1:40:22] just doesn't drop everything all at once
[1:40:24] because you know what we would battle
[1:40:26] sluggishness more than we do right now
[1:40:29] but God knows how to keep us in a place
[1:40:32] of
[1:40:34] humility it's always incredible
[1:40:36] sometimes after the greatest victories
[1:40:38] in our lives where we praise the Lord
[1:40:40] and are so thankful we can also become
[1:40:43] the most
[1:40:45] vulnerable because it isn't that we will
[1:40:47] say well no I don't believe in the Lord
[1:40:49] I don't trust the Lord but sometimes
[1:40:50] through our actions where we neglect
[1:40:53] certain little things that it begins to
[1:40:57] show Lord I've got this when it gets to
[1:41:01] a place in our prayer life it just
[1:41:03] starts it's almost like hit and
[1:41:06] miss now come on now I'm getting right
[1:41:08] down where the rubber meets the road see
[1:41:10] these are things like this that listen
[1:41:12] we don't want to allow the enemy to hand
[1:41:14] us well this is circumstances of life
[1:41:17] but it's not remember remember he's not
[1:41:20] a compartment in our life he's to be our
[1:41:23] life
[1:41:25] if there's if there's something that I
[1:41:26] that is outside of him we don't want it
[1:41:29] but see it can start just with simple
[1:41:30] little things in our life it can get to
[1:41:32] a place to where we get into a spot
[1:41:34] where we're no longer living living by
[1:41:36] faith in God's word the prophet goes
[1:41:38] into this right here we actually start
[1:41:41] living by
[1:41:43] reasoning well God understands my plight
[1:41:45] God understands where I'm at and then
[1:41:47] you find that all of a sudden that
[1:41:49] things it really doesn't seem to have
[1:41:51] the same diligence in coming to the
[1:41:53] house of God to to to being with the
[1:41:55] saints of God as it used to now listen
[1:41:57] friends let me stop right here there's
[1:41:59] many many many that have made many of us
[1:42:02] have made sacrifices Through The Years
[1:42:04] where individuals actually called called
[1:42:07] away from family or or took when maybe
[1:42:10] there was meetings or something coming
[1:42:11] on would actually take away time and say
[1:42:14] God I'm looking for you to do something
[1:42:16] Lord in a real special way Lord father I
[1:42:19] need a real touch from you but look as
[1:42:22] time goes on if we're not careful it
[1:42:24] becomes as though that we're just
[1:42:26] expecting him to fly over and drop what
[1:42:29] we have need of so good and yet we do
[1:42:32] Minister that he does Supply our needs
[1:42:35] but God wants you and I to seek after
[1:42:37] him he knows we got needs but how much
[1:42:40] greater it is that when we can say Lord
[1:42:43] I need you I need you it shouldn't be
[1:42:46] that our prayer life has got less it
[1:42:48] ought to be even greater now at the
[1:42:50] coming of the Lord the Bible says as you
[1:42:53] see that day approaching even the more
[1:42:56] so forsake not to assemble yourselves
[1:42:59] together but see just a little by little
[1:43:01] little by little little by little pride
[1:43:06] can get in there see pride itself has so
[1:43:08] many different ways that if not for the
[1:43:10] spirit of God and the grace of God
[1:43:11] Discerning in our lives and helping us
[1:43:13] to see it friends it would just continue
[1:43:15] to work all the way through our lives
[1:43:17] but aren't you glad for for the grace of
[1:43:19] God Hey listen friends every one of us
[1:43:21] need this grace in our lives God helping
[1:43:24] us to see these little
[1:43:28] things watch this brother says you got
[1:43:31] to continue to serve God that's what
[1:43:33] we're really talking about there no
[1:43:34] matter what you
[1:43:36] was back 10 years ago right thank God
[1:43:40] for what you were 10 years ago but what
[1:43:41] are you
[1:43:42] today that that's what matters God's not
[1:43:45] going to Rapture you or I because of
[1:43:48] what we were last year that's right five
[1:43:52] years ago but what are we
[1:43:54] today what are we today have you know
[1:43:56] that's why have we got to such a place
[1:43:58] and I say friends we I I'm including
[1:44:00] here with us it's an an admonition that
[1:44:02] in our lives this is not the word of God
[1:44:05] has not caused us to pull back from
[1:44:07] seeking after him but when he's making
[1:44:09] himself known right here Among Us he's
[1:44:11] touching our hearts he's touching Our
[1:44:13] Lives it ought to be a moment to say God
[1:44:16] you that has touched my life you that
[1:44:19] has come walk the AIS you minister to my
[1:44:22] heart oh God how I remember those days
[1:44:25] Lord God when you would sweep down with
[1:44:28] your presence Lord and I would just
[1:44:30] yield to you instead of looking at my
[1:44:34] watch oh boy come on Friends yes sir
[1:44:38] littleness said just you can get in
[1:44:39] there so s so
[1:44:44] little says what you are now he said the
[1:44:46] king got to a place that he thought
[1:44:48] within himself he got lifted up and
[1:44:51] pride got in his heart that to me that
[1:44:53] that statement right there is a real key
[1:44:55] statement Pride got
[1:44:58] in his
[1:45:01] heart you
[1:45:03] know many of us have heard this quoted
[1:45:07] quite some time you can go look it up
[1:45:10] you most you got the app and things like
[1:45:12] that let me just say it'd be good for
[1:45:15] you if there's certain things that you
[1:45:17] see that's quoted right here maybe a
[1:45:18] certain message go listen to that
[1:45:20] message there's certain things you see
[1:45:22] quoted write it down and then go look it
[1:45:24] up in your app and say I'm want to read
[1:45:25] the all the context that goes all around
[1:45:27] that because I tell you what God will
[1:45:29] continue to speak you know who it was
[1:45:30] that'll lead you to go even read that
[1:45:32] quote in the message the same holy
[1:45:34] spirit that was bringing our attention
[1:45:35] to it because he wants to do it even in
[1:45:37] a more personal way with you I because
[1:45:41] it's a personal walk it's not about
[1:45:43] everything I get I got to get it from
[1:45:44] Samuel brownie no you're not getting
[1:45:45] anything from Samuel brownie anything
[1:45:47] you've got you got it from God and it's
[1:45:49] because God gave Grace to this guy right
[1:45:51] here is so ignorant and to be able to
[1:45:53] step out of the way that he could step
[1:45:55] down and speak to
[1:45:57] us Pride got in his heart this is why
[1:46:00] brother Bram says like this he said you
[1:46:02] may said he said every one of us he said
[1:46:04] you've got a Punch coming at you he said
[1:46:08] weakness and if you just type this in
[1:46:10] weakness and blood punch he said he's
[1:46:13] got a Punch coming at you he said but
[1:46:15] you know where that weakness is that's
[1:46:17] right he said it might be a physical
[1:46:20] condition it might be son he goes down
[1:46:22] through a whole list of things actually
[1:46:23] in 65 Christ revealing his own word is a
[1:46:25] real good study on it and he goes into
[1:46:27] it and he says and what would you rather
[1:46:28] would you rather you didn't know that
[1:46:30] there was a Punch coming and didn't know
[1:46:31] where it was where where it was going to
[1:46:33] come at and try to hit you at or would
[1:46:35] you rather know and say Lord keep me
[1:46:37] covered with the blood he said you must
[1:46:39] keep that part covered with the blood at
[1:46:41] all
[1:46:43] times how many know that's true am
[1:46:46] listen friends that that's part of our
[1:46:47] journey that's part of our walk with
[1:46:50] God let me just step back from here just
[1:46:53] a moment this is why that in in our walk
[1:46:56] with
[1:46:57] God and and when the baptism of the Holy
[1:46:59] Ghost has come that is the victory in
[1:47:02] our soul to where it is overcome the
[1:47:04] desire of sin and through that
[1:47:07] overthrowing of the Kingdom in our life
[1:47:10] it gives us the strength to subdue all
[1:47:13] of the influences that would want to
[1:47:15] come out here the pools that Satan would
[1:47:18] want to make upon a life right and see
[1:47:21] what it is you've got a judgment seat
[1:47:22] then the Judgment seat is no longer out
[1:47:24] here you're not waiting till you come to
[1:47:26] the house of God Alone even though the
[1:47:28] Judgment should begin at the house of
[1:47:29] God but remember when the Holy Ghost has
[1:47:31] come into your life the Judgment seat of
[1:47:33] God has now become tabernacled in your
[1:47:35] heart that is beautiful yes sir is that
[1:47:38] right and you know what God God don't
[1:47:41] need you don't need to come to the house
[1:47:42] of God to all of a sudden receive
[1:47:44] correction but if we somehow kind of
[1:47:46] push it back and say well you know I
[1:47:48] don't know I I don't I just kind of just
[1:47:50] kind of push it and just kind of you
[1:47:51] know this or that then and all of a
[1:47:53] sudden the spirit of God think of God in
[1:47:55] humility are you here with me think of
[1:47:57] God in humility God is not like we
[1:47:59] talked about last week parental Pride
[1:48:01] where he looks around and he's got
[1:48:02] pictures of all of us and says they are
[1:48:04] nothing but the sweetest Darlings they
[1:48:06] don't ever do anything wrong I mean
[1:48:08] every time they walk it's like powdered
[1:48:10] sugar dropping out of their shoes no God
[1:48:12] knows you and I better than that we are
[1:48:14] his children and he's not going to let
[1:48:16] us get by with one thing in our lives
[1:48:19] because why he's got an expected end for
[1:48:23] us all the discipline all the correction
[1:48:26] is about that goal of the Rapture that
[1:48:28] we come back to what God has intended
[1:48:31] you and I to
[1:48:32] be so God God is Not Too Proud to come
[1:48:36] down and say my
[1:48:38] children not my children not my sweet
[1:48:41] Little Darlings not my boy not my
[1:48:45] daughter oh
[1:48:47] no they're perfect no God is a faithful
[1:48:52] father
[1:48:54] he does not in other words God is not
[1:48:57] ashamed when he has to come down and
[1:48:59] correct us
[1:49:01] am think about it he would in his
[1:49:04] humility he would come down and correct
[1:49:06] us that to me in itself is such great
[1:49:09] humility let alone him coming down and
[1:49:11] living in a body of humiliation going to
[1:49:13] a cross where he was humiliated right
[1:49:17] but then coming down in services and
[1:49:18] dealing in our lives and he doesn't come
[1:49:20] down and say you should know this how
[1:49:22] many times have you heard this how many
[1:49:25] quotes have you heard read on this how
[1:49:26] many no he comes because you know why he
[1:49:29] knows that we are but flesh and his
[1:49:31] desire is to so live his life out
[1:49:33] through you and I that he comes and
[1:49:36] makes known the hindrances that we in
[1:49:38] our finite mind cannot catch without the
[1:49:43] Holy Spirit that's good preaching yes
[1:49:45] sir but Pride God in his heart maybe it
[1:49:47] started out with a little
[1:49:49] pinhole it just started coming in
[1:49:53] drip drip drip and then eventually his
[1:49:57] life it just started filling
[1:49:59] up maybe it started filling up to where
[1:50:02] that when he was going to hear the
[1:50:03] ministry he just
[1:50:06] thought I
[1:50:08] don't I don't need to go along with that
[1:50:11] that's just a little over the top kept
[1:50:13] filling up kept filling up until
[1:50:17] eventually he thought I can be my own
[1:50:20] Shepherd
[1:50:23] I don't need the ministry I don't you
[1:50:25] know what even with what God has sent
[1:50:28] through his Prophet I know what the Holy
[1:50:31] Spirit has
[1:50:34] spoke and sure go to going in that way
[1:50:37] and all of a sudden Satan will supply
[1:50:39] certain quotes I could even tell you
[1:50:41] where some of those quotes will come
[1:50:43] from right where brother brandham even
[1:50:45] the certain things that he made even
[1:50:47] regarding certain statements and so
[1:50:49] forth even in he that is in you and and
[1:50:50] see how Satan will start feeding those
[1:50:52] things along let me just tell you
[1:50:53] something this message was not meant for
[1:50:55] you and I to try to figure it
[1:50:57] out God never sent this message for
[1:51:00] ministers to prove it he's already done
[1:51:04] it but real true gifted God called men
[1:51:08] listen they when when God begins to
[1:51:10] speak through that message listen he
[1:51:12] will be taking that message and being
[1:51:14] able to see it right down through the
[1:51:16] scriptures see it right down through the
[1:51:18] Bible I believe looking I'm not ashamed
[1:51:20] to quote the prophet of God I believe
[1:51:22] you're not ashamed to hear that because
[1:51:24] let me tell you something here with when
[1:51:26] you look at it as I can refer right back
[1:51:28] to these things you know that's not
[1:51:30] brother Samuel's idea he didn't read
[1:51:32] that from Matthew Henry's commentary he
[1:51:35] didn't read that from John Gil I thank
[1:51:37] God for those men of God but listen
[1:51:39] friends we had to have a prophet of God
[1:51:42] in this hour so it was not just man
[1:51:45] looking and probing but where God would
[1:51:47] take truth and gather truth in and say
[1:51:50] this is my truth that I spoke through
[1:51:53] this man spoke through this man spoke
[1:51:55] through this man is no longer a
[1:51:58] wondering Hallelujah the
[1:52:01] amen has
[1:52:03] spoken thank you
[1:52:06] Lord yes
[1:52:08] sir but notice brother Bram says how
[1:52:11] things will continue let me just get
[1:52:13] down to this application of it can I
[1:52:15] have a few more
[1:52:18] moments watch out the application I I
[1:52:20] love this with the message of the hour
[1:52:22] brother said you take a family that'll
[1:52:24] start going to church God will heal that
[1:52:26] little family he will bless them give
[1:52:28] them the holy spirit in their life the
[1:52:30] little children will pray around the
[1:52:32] table they'll pray before they go to bed
[1:52:35] mother and father will join hands and
[1:52:37] pray and as long as they continue like
[1:52:41] that they'll stay a family Hallelujah
[1:52:44] but the first thing you know they didn't
[1:52:47] have nothing an old junk car maybe
[1:52:49] riding around in or maybe walking how
[1:52:51] many remember that
[1:52:53] uh I remember my wife and I got married
[1:52:57] my dad was riding with my wife and our
[1:53:00] that blue car we had the transmission
[1:53:01] was
[1:53:03] slipping hey I didn't have the money I
[1:53:06] didn't have the money you know you go to
[1:53:07] push the gas and it
[1:53:09] just catch you
[1:53:10] [Laughter]
[1:53:15] know that's
[1:53:17] good my dad was riding he was riding
[1:53:20] with my wife the one time that happened
[1:53:23] at an intersection and my dad looked
[1:53:25] over at her and said how long has this
[1:53:27] been doing
[1:53:30] that I wasn't trying to be neglectful I
[1:53:32] always take my cars and stff the shop
[1:53:34] but I just didn't have the money it was
[1:53:37] old I didn't have the money you know to
[1:53:39] do it I I I hate credit I don't like
[1:53:41] credit and things like that I I just
[1:53:42] didn't I didn't have money I said Lord I
[1:53:44] I don't know what to do but I remember
[1:53:45] he said how long has this been like this
[1:53:47] so you know what it kind of it kind of
[1:53:49] makes me appreciate just a car that I
[1:53:51] don't have to worry about that trans
[1:53:54] transmission it kind of makes me
[1:53:55] appreciate because we had that car and
[1:53:57] then my dad let us use his brown truck
[1:53:59] that that Brown GMC truck and you know
[1:54:01] what you could never tell how much gas
[1:54:03] it had in it cuz the gas thing didn't
[1:54:07] work it was two wheel drive so look out
[1:54:10] when it's snow on the road I mean my
[1:54:12] wife did a donut right there at Perkins
[1:54:13] Avenue in 250 right there right on the
[1:54:16] Road God the grace of God you know but
[1:54:19] you didn't know so what did you do every
[1:54:20] time you pass a gas station you figure
[1:54:22] wait a minute 1 2 3 4 five times a
[1:54:24] school I I probably going to get some
[1:54:26] gas right now and you go you know you
[1:54:28] put gas in there and it just stay right
[1:54:30] in the same
[1:54:32] spot but you know what when I look back
[1:54:36] in many of those times right
[1:54:38] there I had such wonderful times with
[1:54:40] him yeah it isn't listen it isn't that I
[1:54:44] love him less and right now but I get to
[1:54:46] looking at things that Lord and many
[1:54:49] times I'm just sharing with you many
[1:54:50] times I'll say Lord thank you for the
[1:54:52] things that you've allowed me and that I
[1:54:55] didn't have to worry about I didn't Lord
[1:54:57] I I didn't it wasn't me but I want us
[1:54:59] just I want you to know you didn't have
[1:55:01] to do that you didn't have to but I want
[1:55:04] to say thank you I want to say thank you
[1:55:07] I want you to know Lord I appreciate you
[1:55:09] I want you to know many times friends I
[1:55:11] I'm just saying I just encourage you and
[1:55:12] I I believe I believe you do it too but
[1:55:14] don't ever get beyond that of looking
[1:55:16] and don't get focused on those things
[1:55:18] but say Lord thank you for your grace
[1:55:20] Lord help me Lord Jesus give me me the
[1:55:22] grace Lord to handle the things in the
[1:55:24] right way because let me tell you
[1:55:26] something the world when the Rapture
[1:55:28] comes all those things will be left
[1:55:30] behind they can have our homes have our
[1:55:33] cars have whatever more because the
[1:55:34] Rapture itself is what means everything
[1:55:36] to us The God Who kept swept down and he
[1:55:39] changed my life if he never did one more
[1:55:42] thing for me he did more than any any
[1:55:46] man or any job or anything could ever do
[1:55:50] he's given me a joy
[1:55:54] and that Joy has been my strength even
[1:55:57] through times when I've been down it's
[1:55:59] been a joy to know I know in whom I have
[1:56:02] believed I don't know how I'm going to
[1:56:03] come out of this I don't know how this
[1:56:05] problem is going to be solved but I know
[1:56:08] that God is
[1:56:10] faithful and that Joy is because of that
[1:56:14] relationship that we have with him the
[1:56:18] joy of the Lord is our
[1:56:29] strength R said finally they get a good
[1:56:31] car A Better Home and the first thing
[1:56:33] you know then they want to get what they
[1:56:35] want and the world calls a better class
[1:56:38] to associate with they move into a
[1:56:41] different neighborhood and in there they
[1:56:43] find out they become influenced by the
[1:56:46] wrong
[1:56:48] influence you must always
[1:56:51] stay with where the kingdom of God is
[1:56:54] and where the glory of God is pouring
[1:56:56] out stay where you can be spiritually
[1:57:00] fed day and
[1:57:02] night I don't believe brother Bram is
[1:57:04] just talking about of where we belong in
[1:57:07] the economy of God I don't believe he's
[1:57:10] just talking about that us staying in
[1:57:12] wherever that he's called us to be
[1:57:14] whatever Church whatever locality but
[1:57:16] the most the first thing is is being in
[1:57:18] Christ and staying where the glory of
[1:57:21] God is pouring out where I can be
[1:57:24] spiritually fed day and night how many
[1:57:26] of you know sometimes there's things
[1:57:27] that you can see it just get on your
[1:57:28] mind and get you weighed down right
[1:57:31] there's things that happen like that
[1:57:33] it's like I told you before there's
[1:57:34] certain threads and things I'm on with
[1:57:36] pastors from around the world other
[1:57:37] ministry that's here throughout the
[1:57:39] region some other things like that and
[1:57:41] sometimes there can get into sometimes
[1:57:42] discussions or things will get sent on
[1:57:47] there oh you know and sometimes I got
[1:57:49] some of my buddies say they'll put a
[1:57:51] little on there like that I oh Lord have
[1:57:53] mercy you know what you you say what
[1:57:56] what do you mean well there's sometimes
[1:57:57] where you can actually get to a place to
[1:57:59] where now this thing has got started and
[1:58:02] now here comes this quote Here Comes
[1:58:03] this scripture Here Comes this quote
[1:58:05] here come and I and this is where I just
[1:58:07] stand I do not want my mind to get
[1:58:10] sidetracked I'm not trying to be
[1:58:12] spiritual I'm just telling you I don't
[1:58:14] like my mind to get sidetracked my my
[1:58:16] wife will tell you there might be times
[1:58:18] where she'll call or she'll text or
[1:58:20] something like that and I'll say you
[1:58:21] know what y'all go ahead with dinner I
[1:58:23] as soon as I get this thought wrapped up
[1:58:25] then I then when I get that thought if
[1:58:27] nothing else opens at that time let me
[1:58:29] finish out this study y'all go ahead and
[1:58:31] pray and just keep me a plate and I'll
[1:58:32] eat it when I get there that's the same
[1:58:34] way that within our lives I don't want
[1:58:36] my mind to be bogged down with things
[1:58:38] and yet we have insurance bills to to
[1:58:40] pay right I know I don't mean to bring
[1:58:43] it back down to where you're like oh
[1:58:44] Lord we got things you got we got tasks
[1:58:47] we have to do right we got natural tasks
[1:58:50] that we have to do there's things that
[1:58:52] we have to think
[1:58:54] about but
[1:58:58] yet don't let your life become tied up
[1:59:02] Lord to where God
[1:59:04] himself can't drop and have that sweet
[1:59:07] communion with you to where you're
[1:59:09] always available you know to where when
[1:59:11] you look on somebody's point on WhatsApp
[1:59:13] or telegram it says available when
[1:59:18] they're on WhatsApp you know they're on
[1:59:19] there because there's that green ring
[1:59:22] going right across their name is that
[1:59:24] right or when they're on telegram that
[1:59:27] Green Dot shows up they're online
[1:59:29] whether you're texting or not they're on
[1:59:30] there I mean if they're one of your
[1:59:31] contacts and you've got them in a thread
[1:59:34] we always want to be
[1:59:36] available and listen friends let me just
[1:59:38] close with this here that staying
[1:59:41] available is just as simple in the
[1:59:45] humility of staying right in step with
[1:59:48] him the things that God has called us us
[1:59:52] to the ways that he's worked in our life
[1:59:55] when you look back and say man how God
[1:59:57] has worked through this how how God has
[1:59:59] done this but staying humble before God
[2:00:02] is in the simple little
[2:00:05] things of
[2:00:07] praying seeking after him you you see
[2:00:11] you see that scripture we opened with
[2:00:13] Uzziah as long as he
[2:00:17] sought see when you're seeking you
[2:00:19] realize I don't have everything
[2:00:22] keep
[2:00:23] seeking the Bible says as we will seek
[2:00:27] Him He says when you seek me with all
[2:00:29] your heart then I'll be found of
[2:00:32] you David said thou has said seek after
[2:00:34] me and my heart said after thee while I
[2:00:36] seek oh God don't ever stop seeking
[2:00:39] after him longing after him
[2:00:46] praying oh my I want to just I'm going
[2:00:50] to skip ahead here to this last this
[2:00:52] quote I want to this summarizes this
[2:00:54] part the kernel of the message brother
[2:00:58] Bram said we find that the church yet
[2:01:00] teaching its power and teaching the
[2:01:02] signs to follow the believer yet we find
[2:01:04] them puffed out big me little you it
[2:01:09] isn't like the early church they were
[2:01:12] humble kind to one another and
[2:01:16] sweet understanding so much different
[2:01:19] today I wonder if a lot
[2:01:22] of this hasn't sidetracked us from the
[2:01:27] real kernel of the
[2:01:30] message you mean God would
[2:01:33] allow even sometimes the display of
[2:01:36] gifts and other things like that and
[2:01:38] other to where people could become so
[2:01:40] wrapped up in certain
[2:01:43] expressions and then they begin to
[2:01:45] follow
[2:01:47] gifts I'm going to follow this man CU
[2:01:49] he's got a lot of gifts in his life I'm
[2:01:52] going to follow this church I'm going to
[2:01:53] do that oh God May that never be the
[2:01:56] case may we be may it be that our life
[2:01:58] was in love with him because let me tell
[2:02:00] you something it wasn't a man who bled
[2:02:02] and died for me it was the man Christ
[2:02:03] Jesus it was God who came down but you
[2:02:06] see I look how brother BR tells us if
[2:02:08] that little bit didn't come over and
[2:02:10] come and touch Our
[2:02:13] Lives little bit that hadn't sidetracked
[2:02:16] us from the real kernel of the message
[2:02:22] incredible isn't it because you never
[2:02:24] find I've studied through here over even
[2:02:26] went back through it here just recently
[2:02:27] over some of the some of the some of the
[2:02:29] Past Times here you never find one time
[2:02:32] in the message clear up through the
[2:02:33] message the Rapture where brother bradam
[2:02:35] is ever ordering somebody to leave their
[2:02:38] church as a matter of fact he said we're
[2:02:41] not trying to take you out of your
[2:02:43] churches we want you to be a better
[2:02:45] testimony in your
[2:02:49] church is that right
[2:02:52] oh God may may God help us there's no
[2:02:54] listen there's no big ones there's no
[2:02:56] little ones Among Us there's there's no
[2:02:58] such thing it's
[2:03:01] Christ and if that is not the objective
[2:03:04] then we're missing it but notice if that
[2:03:07] hasn't sidetracked us from the real
[2:03:09] kernel of the message that we want to
[2:03:11] Humble ourselves the more humbler that's
[2:03:15] a good word the more humbler you can be
[2:03:18] the better God will use you and many you
[2:03:22] say Lord that's what I want that's what
[2:03:26] I
[2:03:26] want Lord You've remember when you are
[2:03:30] eaten in full but Lord let me remember
[2:03:32] then then then be intentional then Thou
[2:03:37] shalt bless the Lord thy God Lord thank
[2:03:39] you for your blessings thank you Lord
[2:03:41] for answering prayer thank you Lord for
[2:03:44] the direction you've given in my life
[2:03:46] thank you Lord for your grace even to be
[2:03:48] able to talk to my children to be able
[2:03:50] to see things in a certain way thank
[2:03:51] thank you Lord God for your grace then
[2:03:54] bless the Lord and thank the
[2:03:57] Lord my what a Thanksgiving
[2:03:59] message wasn't even planned or intention
[2:04:02] on this way but what a what a moment
[2:04:05] what a time to think of it to be in that
[2:04:08] of Thanksgiving Lord I Thank You for
[2:04:10] Your Grace I thank you Lord you know how
[2:04:13] you know how we stay in that place the
[2:04:14] more humbler it isn't something in our
[2:04:16] minds that we're trying to do you know
[2:04:18] how this is exhibited is even daily in
[2:04:21] our life Lord I need you
[2:04:24] today I put my hands in your hands Lord
[2:04:27] guide me today Lord direct my feet today
[2:04:31] Lord give me Grace with my family Lord
[2:04:33] give me the leadership of what I'm to
[2:04:35] say on the job Lord show me yourself
[2:04:37] Lord show me Lord in a greater way show
[2:04:39] me Lord my shortcomings Lord father make
[2:04:43] known yourself to me Lord I want to
[2:04:45] serve you more if if you feel like Joy
[2:04:48] the joy of his salvation not that you
[2:04:51] have become un saved but if the joy has
[2:04:53] left your life just that simple humility
[2:04:55] to say God restore unto me the joy of
[2:04:59] thy salvation Lord and renew a right
[2:05:02] Spirit In Me Oh God Lord let me remember
[2:05:06] Lord I'm not above the message but my
[2:05:08] but the authority and the blessing is
[2:05:10] saying what you've said through your
[2:05:12] word for the spirit and the prophet and
[2:05:15] the bride will all be saying the same
[2:05:18] thing I want to stay with that word
[2:05:21] because with that word is Authority
[2:05:23] there's influence with that word it's
[2:05:25] the influence that comes from that other
[2:05:27] realm listen friends if that third angel
[2:05:30] in Revelations 18 flying by said come
[2:05:34] that Babylon Babylon the great is Fallen
[2:05:36] come out of her listen that third Angel
[2:05:39] Was Heard and flying across Heaven and
[2:05:41] the prophet said what it was is that
[2:05:43] seventh Angel's message on
[2:05:46] Earth was so inclined with Heaven till
[2:05:50] Heaven back up what was being said on
[2:05:53] Earth
[2:05:55] Hall heaven was saying amen that's my
[2:05:58] thoughts that's my word calling out to
[2:06:01] my
[2:06:02] people and let me just tell you Babylon
[2:06:05] is not just a system out there but
[2:06:08] Babylon is a condition where we fail to
[2:06:11] walk on with God and see our need for
[2:06:14] more of
[2:06:15] God that's a denomination not just a
[2:06:18] name out here but denomination is the
[2:06:21] prophet says when we fail to walk daily
[2:06:24] with him
[2:06:29] Hallelujah you love
[2:06:32] him listen friends I pray as God has
[2:06:35] delivered these things with us in mind
[2:06:41] amen I know we've been on this a little
[2:06:44] bit here with pride but listen I I'm not
[2:06:46] prolonging anything I'm just trying to
[2:06:48] follow him there's a lot of different
[2:06:49] little parts to help us he wants to help
[2:06:52] us aren't you glad I'm glad I'm glad I'm
[2:06:55] so thankful for that of little things
[2:06:57] like this that friends we're not
[2:06:58] depending upon our own selves we're
[2:07:00] depending on the grace of God lord lord
[2:07:03] survey my life let the MRI of the Holy
[2:07:06] Spirit as we pass under the word of God
[2:07:09] and their word begins to move upon our
[2:07:11] life and that knocking begins to move on
[2:07:13] our life I want to move under the MRI of
[2:07:15] the word Lord if there's anything in me
[2:07:18] that's not like you Lord take it out
[2:07:20] Lord you see what that is even in that
[2:07:22] that's seeking after him we're not just
[2:07:24] coming here and setting his Spectators
[2:07:25] we're here to say Lord I want more of
[2:07:27] you I want more of you Lord pour out of
[2:07:30] your spirit Lord pour out of your life
[2:07:32] Lord I want more of
[2:07:37] you Hallelujah I
[2:07:40] wonder I wonder right here this
[2:07:42] morning even before the musicians would
[2:07:45] come just a few moments I wonder if we
[2:07:48] just couldn't have just a few moments in
[2:07:50] prayer
[2:07:53] just to talk to him of how that he has
[2:07:56] spoke to us you know this is very
[2:07:58] fitting when God would come to us and
[2:08:00] speak to us in this way to have just
[2:08:03] just to take a few
[2:08:04] moments and say
[2:08:07] Lord Lord let the word just let it just
[2:08:09] so drop in my life Lord let it just Lord
[2:08:13] God thank you father for bringing my
[2:08:15] attention to these things Lord thank you
[2:08:18] Lord for helping me Lord to see or just
[2:08:22] how that maybe Pride could get in just
[2:08:24] through a little pinhole Lord God it can
[2:08:27] start with just a little thought and
[2:08:29] just how little by little Lord it just
[2:08:32] continues to build in my life Lord God I
[2:08:35] don't want my life to be full of Pride
[2:08:38] Lord I want to be full of the humility
[2:08:40] of the Holy Spirit I want to humble
[2:08:43] myself Lord in your presence Lord Lord
[2:08:47] God not only here father but Lord daily
[2:08:49] in my life I I wonder if here let's just
[2:08:52] take just a few moments and let's just
[2:08:54] talk to him just a few moments would
[2:08:56] that be all right just to just to invite
[2:08:58] him just talk to him in your own way and
[2:09:01] and just invite him into that into that
[2:09:03] place and Lord how you've spoke to my
[2:09:05] life and just just talk it over with him
[2:09:07] just a few moments I believe that would
[2:09:09] be so fitting right here this morning as
[2:09:12] he's been so gracious to us Lord
[2:09:16] Jesus thank you Father for your mercies
[2:09:19] Lord
[2:09:21] God as we as a people Lord would come
[2:09:24] into prayer Lord I not only would pray
[2:09:27] for them and pray with them but Lord I'm
[2:09:30] also praying here Lord as an individual
[2:09:32] before you lord lord as they're praying
[2:09:35] my brothers and sisters are praying dear
[2:09:37] God Lord in their lives in their hearts
[2:09:39] Lord in an individual way Lord I pray oh
[2:09:43] God lord as we think about Lord where
[2:09:46] you have brought us from Lord I know
[2:09:49] Lord that as we stand here Lord that not
[2:09:52] all of us Lord we're not maybe all in
[2:09:54] the same place or same spot but I'm just
[2:09:57] so glad that we're here with you Lord
[2:10:00] because father I know that Lord that you
[2:10:03] Lord bring each of us you guide us you
[2:10:06] work with us Lord to bring us where we
[2:10:08] need to be father it's you that gives us
[2:10:11] the grace Lord in our lives Lord and how
[2:10:14] I thank you for that Lord I am convinced
[2:10:17] Lord God that your word Lord will
[2:10:20] continue to work in our Our Lives Lord
[2:10:22] no matter where Lord as the Holy Spirit
[2:10:25] would have been Lord in our hearts like
[2:10:27] the prophet said as Lord you would give
[2:10:29] that little family the holy spirit in
[2:10:31] their lives maybe Lord the Holy Spirit
[2:10:33] Lord it hasn't went all the way to the
[2:10:35] actual ceiling of the soul but God it
[2:10:38] started Lord with a work of repentance
[2:10:40] and Lord you dealing with their life of
[2:10:43] separating from things Lord in their
[2:10:44] life and Lord from allowing things Lord
[2:10:47] that coming through their lives that
[2:10:48] would influence a child or children or
[2:10:51] loved ones Lord but father their desire
[2:10:53] is Lord sanctify every part of my life
[2:10:56] Lord to be pleasing to you Lord Jesus as
[2:10:59] they would start out seeking after you
[2:11:01] Lord God and Lord Jesus looking to you
[2:11:04] just how that Lord they remembered they
[2:11:06] felt Lord what it was when they Lord
[2:11:09] Jesus accepted you as their lord and
[2:11:11] savior they remember how it felt Lord
[2:11:14] when the burden of the weight of sin
[2:11:16] Lord was lifted off of their shoulders
[2:11:18] Lord when they had accepted what you had
[2:11:21] done for them oh God I pray father Lord
[2:11:25] Jesus may you take every family every
[2:11:28] mother every father grandmother
[2:11:30] grandfather Lord husband wife Lord God
[2:11:33] take each and everyone Lord father if
[2:11:36] there's one Lord God that Lord has not
[2:11:38] went fully behind the veil may they Lord
[2:11:40] God have enough humility Lord and reach
[2:11:43] up and say Lord I know Lord God that I'm
[2:11:46] not where I need to be but father I want
[2:11:48] to go there Lord and your Prophet said
[2:11:51] Lord Lord that you will take me to the
[2:11:52] baptism of the Holy Ghost your Prophet
[2:11:55] said that when I'm in need of healing
[2:11:57] you'll take me to Healing so Lord God I
[2:11:59] yield Lord Jesus in my life and my heart
[2:12:02] to you Lord oh God let everything be
[2:12:05] conditioned according to your
[2:12:06] preparation Lord that the word would be
[2:12:08] fulfilled in my life Lord God oh granted
[2:12:12] Lord Jesus May the Holy Spirit Lord may
[2:12:15] we lord God continue in that way like
[2:12:17] the prophet said to seek Lord after you
[2:12:20] Lord God seeking Lord until that word is
[2:12:22] made real I pray father for every one of
[2:12:25] us that are gathered here Lord it
[2:12:27] doesn't matter Lord how long we've
[2:12:29] served you Lord oh God there's one thing
[2:12:32] about it Lord we need more of you Lord
[2:12:35] the moment we stop seeking after you is
[2:12:37] the moment we've backslid Lord the
[2:12:40] moment Lord we start Lord God stop from
[2:12:42] that help us Lord forgive us Lord of Our
[2:12:46] sluggishness Lord help us Lord I pray
[2:12:49] God within our lives through the Lord
[2:12:52] the littlest things we often times
[2:12:54] sometimes the terminology of hum
[2:12:56] humbleness and humility it can seem so
[2:12:59] vague to our lives it or so abstract of
[2:13:02] how do I apply this but you show us Lord
[2:13:05] It's it starts Lord just even in the
[2:13:08] Simplicity of how it was Lord as we were
[2:13:10] seeking after you seeking after your
[2:13:13] will seeking after you Lord praying Lord
[2:13:16] father getting into the word of God and
[2:13:19] Lord getting back lord into the message
[2:13:21] message of the hour Lord and father
[2:13:23] realizing you are everything to us Lord
[2:13:25] when everything else of this life is
[2:13:27] done jobs and everything else that you
[2:13:30] provided Lord if if time terries Lord
[2:13:32] God they'll go by the wayside there'll
[2:13:34] be another cars that we'll have to buy
[2:13:36] there'll be other things we'll have to
[2:13:37] do it shows there's no Eternal value in
[2:13:40] those things but God let us Lord I pray
[2:13:43] oh god father that our hearts would be
[2:13:45] set in what is true riches Lord God the
[2:13:48] true things Lord of this life Lord I
[2:13:51] pray heavenly father as you blessed us
[2:13:53] Lord God with a message in this end time
[2:13:56] lord what a glorious message Lord but oh
[2:13:59] God this understanding did not come to
[2:14:02] us Lord as though that you would make us
[2:14:04] Lord as though we are something greater
[2:14:06] or better or in our minds to think Lord
[2:14:09] less of somebody else that's not what
[2:14:11] the message is because that's not you
[2:14:13] Lord the message itself is Christ being
[2:14:16] revealed it's recognizing Lord God your
[2:14:19] grace Lord to each of Our Lives Lord oh
[2:14:23] father I pray granted Lord Jesus help us
[2:14:27] Lord I pray God no long no matter how
[2:14:29] long Lord that we served you may we not
[2:14:31] get too big Lord that we wouldn't come
[2:14:34] to the altar Lord and pray Lord oh
[2:14:36] Father we don't just come as you had me
[2:14:38] say that last week we don't the altar is
[2:14:40] just not a place of repentance Lord
[2:14:43] that's only one part Lord of it father
[2:14:45] for Lord we know that repentance it can
[2:14:47] take right place right there in our seat
[2:14:49] but may we never get too big Lord to
[2:14:51] where when you deal with us that we just
[2:14:53] couldn't even come to the altar Lord and
[2:14:55] say thank you Lord Jesus thank you for
[2:14:58] your mercies upon my life Lord thank you
[2:15:00] for Grace Lord in this week that you
[2:15:02] gave me the wisdom how to speak to that
[2:15:04] boss how to respond Lord with a
[2:15:07] situation that was going on in my home
[2:15:09] thank you for Grace Lord thank you for
[2:15:11] helping me know when to speak and when
[2:15:13] not to speak Lord thank you for your
[2:15:15] wisdom Lord God in our lives Lord oh
[2:15:18] Father it's a place Lord where we can
[2:15:20] offer thanks giving Lord I realize Lord
[2:15:22] we can right there in our seat and I
[2:15:24] realize that Lord but may we never just
[2:15:26] limit Lord times of prayer and really
[2:15:29] getting before you as just a time when
[2:15:31] we are so wrong and out of the way but
[2:15:34] may we take the opportunity Lord God
[2:15:36] just as much as we would go to our
[2:15:38] spouses and express Lord our gratitude
[2:15:41] and Lord our appreciation and our love
[2:15:43] may we lord God I pray not only the only
[2:15:46] time you hear our voice or God would
[2:15:48] hear from us is when we have to say
[2:15:51] forgive me but may it be also those
[2:15:53] wonderful times Lord that are just like
[2:15:56] if we could say pop pop and Lord popcorn
[2:15:59] times of gratitude where we can say
[2:16:01] thank you Lord for your mercy Lord thank
[2:16:04] you Lord for providing Lord thank you
[2:16:06] for your grace thank you for opening
[2:16:08] your word Lord thank you for giving a
[2:16:10] hunger in My Heart Lord thank you Lord
[2:16:12] for correcting me Lord when I've been
[2:16:14] wrong thank you Lord for showing me my
[2:16:17] shortcomings Lord thank you for your
[2:16:19] grace Lord God in my life
[2:16:21] oh Lord Jesus granted Lord I pray Grant
[2:16:25] it Lord God oh in this great land lord
[2:16:29] this great land of the revealed word
[2:16:31] that you have brought us into Lord God
[2:16:34] oh Father you never Lord come that our
[2:16:37] lives would become sluggish Lord but
[2:16:40] help us Lord I pray help us Lord God in
[2:16:43] our lives Lord not to become weighed
[2:16:46] down with the cares of the world Lord
[2:16:48] but father that with everything Lord
[2:16:51] where you're not a compartment but
[2:16:53] you're our everything Lord and all that
[2:16:55] we're looking for I want to see whatever
[2:16:58] I'm searching for I want to see it in
[2:17:00] the boundaries of Christ because in the
[2:17:02] boundaries of Christ that's my
[2:17:04] inheritance and if it's outside of the
[2:17:06] boundaries that has been predestinated
[2:17:08] from the mind and plan of God I don't
[2:17:10] want it I don't need it my flesh might
[2:17:12] want it my spirit might try to reason
[2:17:15] and say this and that but Lord my soul I
[2:17:17] want my soul I want to live that life to
[2:17:20] wherever is Free and Clear With You Lord
[2:17:23] God it doesn't matter if I have to deny
[2:17:25] things Lord God within this life I want
[2:17:28] my life Lord to be full of the joy of
[2:17:30] the Holy Ghost Lord God to live a life
[2:17:33] Lord God that's free father Lord from
[2:17:35] condemnation a life that's free Lord God
[2:17:38] from bondage Lord God of the things of
[2:17:40] this world Grant it Lord I pray father
[2:17:44] Grant it Lord for each of us Lord each
[2:17:46] of Our Lives Lord as your children Lord
[2:17:49] we're praying Lord we're looking to you
[2:17:51] God we're seeking your mercies Lord oh
[2:17:55] God help us Lord I pray help us Lord
[2:17:59] Jesus oh God right in our services Lord
[2:18:02] how that Lord we need you Lord we need
[2:18:05] more of you lord lord Our Lives Lord God
[2:18:08] being changed our hearts Lord God being
[2:18:11] transformed Lord Oh Lord Our Lives being
[2:18:14] touched Lord by your presence help us
[2:18:17] Lord oh God even as the musicians Lord
[2:18:20] as they would get ready to come may they
[2:18:22] Lord also realizing Lord that father
[2:18:24] it's not just something Lord and I don't
[2:18:26] believe they do Lord but it's not just
[2:18:28] something Lord we want to take for
[2:18:29] granted Lord but it's something we want
[2:18:31] to so be in prayer over lord God even as
[2:18:34] we're looking through the week Lord
[2:18:36] guide me because it might be certain
[2:18:38] notes that are played from a certain
[2:18:39] song that would cause a demon to lift
[2:18:42] off of an oppressive spirit that would
[2:18:44] be cast off of a life maybe a heaviness
[2:18:48] about somebody's life maybe it would be
[2:18:50] that that song that note and and those
[2:18:52] things being played together Lord help
[2:18:54] us as musicians to play together Lord in
[2:18:57] a Harmony and a wondess Lord help us
[2:18:59] Lord I pray to devote Lord Our Lives to
[2:19:01] realize the talents that you've given us
[2:19:03] Lord it goes beyond Lord just the times
[2:19:06] that we're here in church Lord but it's
[2:19:08] a devotedness lord as they would give
[2:19:10] themselves to practice Lord God and
[2:19:12] Father begin to Lord yield to you Lord
[2:19:15] Jesus and remember Lord God of the
[2:19:17] different things Lord and how that it
[2:19:19] was Lord as you would deal Lord with
[2:19:21] their lives and Lord just to realize
[2:19:23] what a privilege and an honor Lord it is
[2:19:26] not that they don't realize it but to
[2:19:27] recognize Lord God even in a greater way
[2:19:30] just rekindle it Lord of what an honor
[2:19:33] it is to be able to play for the king of
[2:19:35] kings and for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[2:19:39] Lord what a privilege it is Lord for
[2:19:41] brothers and sisters that Lord as they
[2:19:43] sit here Lord God and Father taking in
[2:19:46] the word of God and their lives being
[2:19:48] used as vessels and instruments that'll
[2:19:50] touch lives that Lord my life would
[2:19:53] never touch Lord their lives will preach
[2:19:55] sermons Lord in volumes and ways that
[2:19:58] Lord that there may not be Lord a vessel
[2:20:01] that would enter these doors Lord
[2:20:03] because of maybe them clicking on a
[2:20:05] website or hearing a YouTube video but
[2:20:07] it would be through their life Lord God
[2:20:10] that Lord their hearts would be stirred
[2:20:12] Lord to begin to seek after you oh God
[2:20:15] let us not minimize Lord the
[2:20:17] responsibility that we have in this hour
[2:20:20] to be influences influences Lord oh God
[2:20:24] I don't want to I want to influence the
[2:20:26] lives that are around me my desire Let
[2:20:28] It Be Lord that through our dedication
[2:20:31] to you it'll be an influence Lord upon
[2:20:33] our children it'll be an influence upon
[2:20:35] our grandchildren Lord God grant it Lord
[2:20:38] I pray father help us Lord help us Lord
[2:20:42] Jesus help us Lord oh God granted Lord I
[2:20:47] thank Father Lord now over 42 years ago
[2:20:50] Lord when you started this work but God
[2:20:53] we need you just as much right now we
[2:20:56] need you just as much Lord even more
[2:20:59] right now Lord than we did Lord 42 years
[2:21:02] ago we need you more right now this
[2:21:05] month than we did last month Lord we
[2:21:08] need you Lord Jesus we need you Lord God
[2:21:11] we need your leadership Lord we're
[2:21:13] coming to the end we see things mounting
[2:21:16] up Lord we see things Lord coming to a
[2:21:19] place I don't know oh Lord we may not
[2:21:22] even see an inauguration Lord there in
[2:21:24] January I don't say that to scare
[2:21:26] anybody but I'm saying Lord God we
[2:21:29] should not get to looking at things Lord
[2:21:31] and where that somehow in our hearts it
[2:21:33] is set as peace peace for it is at that
[2:21:36] time that you said sudden destruction
[2:21:38] Lord would come Lord oh God as I hear
[2:21:41] Lord commentators say well Putin has
[2:21:43] spooled out this Bluff and this is a
[2:21:45] bluff and this is a bluff Lord God to
[2:21:48] think that how that even in the
[2:21:49] conditioning of the minds of the people
[2:21:52] Lord God but there is a people on Earth

[2:27:01] love
[2:27:06] the I want you to think of this just a
[2:27:09] minute when I was teaching
[2:27:12] school they would we would had to we
[2:27:14] were teaching a unit on plants and seeds
[2:27:18] and sometimes I'd get carried away and
[2:27:20] say Amen in the middle of what I was
[2:27:21] [Music]
[2:27:24] teaching but they they would have us
[2:27:26] take them little simple little
[2:27:28] beans were almost look like a kidney
[2:27:30] bean or something like that and they
[2:27:32] would have us take those and actually
[2:27:34] the kids would do it and I'd have them
[2:27:35] take those brown paper towels and they
[2:27:39] would soak them in water and then they
[2:27:41] would wrap fold up that bean seed inside
[2:27:45] that paper
[2:27:47] towel we'd put them in there put them in
[2:27:49] a cup
[2:27:52] then we would
[2:27:53] leave the next day they would come into
[2:27:56] school and when it came time for science
[2:27:59] I'd have take those cups they would
[2:28:02] unroll that wet damp
[2:28:05] cloth and what it
[2:28:07] was is that outer part that was so
[2:28:11] hard they could just take with their
[2:28:13] finger and it just peel right off
[2:28:15] sometimes it would handle that bean it
[2:28:16] would almost shoot through there it just
[2:28:18] be but that outer part is is what they
[2:28:20] call the seed coat and it's such a hard
[2:28:26] thing but what it takes is that
[2:28:29] water to break that and once it's broken
[2:28:34] then they could open
[2:28:35] up and they could see the insides of
[2:28:38] that seed and that's why even right now
[2:28:41] in his presence and even as we would
[2:28:43] leave from here we continue to Worship
[2:28:45] the Lord we let that word Lord let that
[2:28:47] word Let the Rain of the Holy Spirit
[2:28:49] just settle in
[2:28:51] let it let it just melt down all of my
[2:28:53] will let it melt down everything Lord
[2:28:56] until that word has become real I I I
[2:29:00] want more of you Lord I want
[2:29:03] more I want
