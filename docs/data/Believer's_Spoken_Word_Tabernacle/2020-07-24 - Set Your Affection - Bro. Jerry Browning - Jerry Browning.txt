[Music] is [Music] god [Music] amen praise the lord good to be here tonight with you just like to would you stand please lord in prayer before we turn to the scriptures heavenly father we come before you tonight and we're asking father for you to come and speak to us lord from your word lord you know the needs of each and every one here tonight i pray lord that you will speak to those needs dear god we ask these things in the name of the lord jesus christ unto the glory of god amen turn with me in your bibles to colossians chapter three i want to read verses one through three if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god you may see me i'd like to speak on an eye to set your affection on things above i want to read from romans chapter 8 verses 5 through 9. it says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded as life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you so if the spirit of god dwells in you so you you see there's a nest necessity for being born again there's a necessity for receiving the holy ghost you're not going to be able to make it in your christian walk without the holy ghost that's the thing that people say you know sometimes well i i can't live that i can't do that no of course you can't but that's what god sent the holy ghost for was so the holy ghost would lead and guide you the holy ghost would teach you and it would keep you from those things now there's two sources of love one comes from your spirit realm and that is the human love then there's love that comes from your soul that is a gop of love video love or the human love it will cause a mother to risk her life to save her child it will cause a man to risk his life to save his wife and that's just human love think how much greater god's love is if you only love god with the human love and that is what brother branham said he said he thinks a lot of times he's very convinced that people have been deceived in thinking they've got a gobble love when what they've got is just filial love human love a human love for god i'll show you place in the scriptures where different ones had uh at one time a human love for jesus and with if all you've got is that human love then you've never received the real love spirit of god and if all you love god with is a human love then at some point you're going to leave him because human love fails but god's love is eternal real brotherhood said real genuine love of god comes into the human being by the new birth being born again it had no beginning no have no end you are then a son of god and a daughter of god and your affections are on things above so you to have the god love to be able to have a gobble of you've got to be born again if you've got just human love why uh human love is kind of fickle remember when god came and was talking to adam and eve and he said who told you he asked adam who told you who to eat of that tree and notice adam's love for eve that woman you gave me it was her she gave me of the tree that that's human love but also human love caused him to win uh she had went out and sinned her she was deceived but adam the bible said was not deceived and adam went out willingly to save her and that was human love that was his filial love but god knowing the church was guilty and unworthy he done the same thing he went to the cross took upon him our sins he became us that we might become him and he did that out of god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son jesus so loved that he gave his life for who or the world but for who would receive it would be the bride of christ you can't uh you can't love with your body your love with your spirit it's one of the inlets of the spirit and that inlet of the spirit it can if it's if it's not set in tune with the soul it can get you in a lot of trouble there are people who uh want to see their children saved but they love their children with the with the human love from their spirit i've had people come to me and say my son is doing this and that and i want god to stop him would you pray that god would stop him and i said do you really want me to pray that they said oh yes i said all right but god's going to stop him then and so the next thing you know they called me up and said he's in jail i said well god stopped him but the same one that asked me that their human love for the sun went down belled him out when i said let him set there because that that would be the only place i could get to to get a hold of him to talk to him and i said he can god can deal with him there you don't you don't gotta you know say well god can't deal with people in jail that that's not true god can deal with the soul no matter where you are so you know your filial love will do more damage to your children than anything else because the human love will make excuse for them a human love will make a loophole for them human love will say well you know you've got to realize brother jerry that's just they've always been like that that's just how they are in other words just accept them well that ain't the way god looks at it god's love would bring them down in to to their last breath just to save their soul because friends look god's love he's not in love with this flesh you walk around in because that's not the real you anyway and this isn't going to be the flesh you walk around in after the rapture so god's not in love with something that is finite that's going to pass away and this flesh is it's going to be changed but what god is in love with is that soul that's on the inside and that's what he came to say he came to redeem this body that's true and we'll come to that redemption in in due time but god loves the soul human love loves the flesh i i would rather if one of my children weren't serving god i would rather see them come down to death's bed give their life to the lord and be gone the next moment than to spend the rest of the time we've got here left on earth with them because at least i'd know where they were that's the truth because once we leave here then your children you won't look at them as your children anymore your loved ones you won't look at them as your loved ones anymore because one day there's going to be folks sitting on this side of the judgment bar and folks standing out on that side and those that are standing on that side you won't say lord now back in life that was my son or my daughter you know have mercy on him no it's going to be judged by the word your memory of those things will at one point be wiped that's the truth because how could you be happy constantly walking around knowing well so and so didn't make it but god wants you to be happy he wants you to be happy here and you know when you've got loved ones that are not saved why you god still wants you to be happy you can't be worried about them you can pray about them and commit them to god but worrying will just bring sickness to you if they belong to god they're going to come i'll tell you something friends if you belong to god you'll come you might come easy or you might come hard but if you belong to him you're going to come god will make sure of that and he has a way of getting your attention there is uh degrees of human love there's different degrees of human love there's one love you have for your children there's one love you have for your spouse it's another love you have for your brothers and sisters there's another love you have for your friends there's different degrees of agape love matthew 5 46 said for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even republicans the same remember when jesus was invited to simon's house and he sat there and no one washed his feet no one welcomed him with a kiss and so on until the woman came in and afterwards jesus said to simon i've got something to say to you and he said what is it he said there was a a a a creditor which had two debtors and he said one holding 500 pence and the other 50 pence and they couldn't pay their debt and so the creditor just forgave him the debt then he asked simon he says now which one of them would love him the most and simon said the one he forgave the most and jesus said you've spoken well amen and turned to the woman said your sins which were many are all forgiving you this was showing that there were degrees of agape love she was forgiven of many sins she loved greatly now when uh god created man we know that he created him in a spirit form first and the bible says he created him both male and female and man and woman and uh but there was found no one to till the soil and so god came down and he made a body out of the dirt he took the masculine spirit and he put it in adam but then we find that after all this creation and went on that adam was lonesome there wasn't fountain no help made for him he had all the the animals and all these things around him but there was no help made found for him you realize the serpent was created in the in the creation and it was the closest thing to man and we know what eve did when she had her opportunity but adam didn't find a help mate with the serpent adam didn't mix with the serpent and so god didn't come down and take more dirt and make another creation but since he had created them as one to begin with he come down and and caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and from his side he took a rib right brother graham said he took the rib that was right over his heart and from that he made another body and brought that feminist spirit down and put it in that body and brother ram said that was that feminine spirit was the love spirit kind and gentle and and weak he said but he put the masculine spirit in the man but today they've got it all twisted up and twisted around and brother branham said if it's any other way then it's perversion the verb said it was love at first sight adam come to from sleep and beheld her he said you'll be called woman for you were taken from man and he and he said it was love at first sight you know isaac when he was out walking in the fields eliezer brought rebecca and you know rebecca had a veil over her but when they saw one another even with the veil over her isaac brother brown said it was love at first sight and that's the way it is with christ it's love at first sight christ loved you because he foresaw you not just sight as we look at it in this world or this earth but he foresaw you when he was on the cross i was on his mind hallelujah he loved me he knew me yet he loved me and and the love that he had for me is what took him to the cross when he had to overcome his human self in the garden where he said father if it'd be possible let this cup pass from me and you know he prayed three times but on the third time he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done but he had to overcome the flesh and what helped him to overcome the flesh was the agape love what helped us to overcome the flesh god's love in us you'll never overcome the flesh without that true love of god in your soul but once you've got that love of god in your soul it'll stop you from smoking it'll stop you from lying it'll stop you from drinking it'll stop you from all these things why because all those things are attributes of sin which is unbelief and when you've got the perfect love of god then it brings faith not unbelief but belief and perfect love brings faith sometimes we as brother madam said we we people say they love god but remember peter when uh jesus was speaking about the things that was going to happen to him and he said that i'm going to die they're going to they're going to do these different things to me and peter took him aside and rebuked him and said far be it from you for those things to happen see that was peter loved jesus but he loved him with the human love and that's why when jesus was there and they were whipping him and all these things and peter was standing just afar off and looking on they come and ask peter said you're one of those that went that was with jim peter said no i'm not what was that human love it was failing and he said but i i know you talk like them he said i don't know the man see that was human love human love said far be if i won't let these things happen to you but then when they begin to happen he said oh i don't know him when jesus arose and he went to down to the shore the seashore and there was peter and some of the disciples out in a boat because remember peter said he didn't know what to make of all this he says oh i'm just going to go fishing so they were down there in the boat and they were fishing and they toiled all night and they hadn't caught a thing and jesus appeared to him on the shore he said have you any meat and they said no we told a night we haven't caught anything and he said cast your nets on the right side of the boat and and you'll haul in some fish and so they took the nets cast them on the right side of the boat what makes a difference the left side the right side i don't know but jesus said cast it on the right side and they cast it on the other side of the boat and all of a sudden they had fish brother graham said believe god created them fish and when this happened they pulled in they more than they could hardly pull up then the bible said the disciple that loved whom jesus loved said peter that's him he's done this before i remember that's him and when peter realized that it was indeed jesus why he cast himself in the sea then when they came into shore while they found jesus had a fire going and he was cooking fish now when the boy came that time and had his loaves of bread and his fish and jesus began to break off the loaves and the fish or whatever jesus never had to make another fire to cook more and more fish but it just multiplied what was there so there was a reason that jesus built a fire this time and it was because jesus was showing him first thing he was going to do was take care of their natural needs and he was going to feed him now they caught the fish and they were bringing them in in a small boat and as they bring but jesus already had some fish and he was cooking it on a fire for when they came in and he took care of their natural needs look friends jesus cares about your natural needs as well as your spiritual needs he'll take care of those things and why the bible said seek ye first the kingdom of god and all of his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you jesus will take care of them then we find peter makes it into shore and as he comes in the shore and jesus says to him simon lovett stop me and you look in the greek jesus asked him simon feel he owe thou me do you love me with the human love and peter answers yes lord i love you with the human love and then jesus asked him again said simon lovett's thou me ask him again do you love me with the human love and he said yes lord i love you with human love he said do you love me with the god of love peter said i love you with the human love jesus wasn't trying to embarrass peter but he was trying to show peter that he would not be able to love with the agape love until he had received power from on high until he received the holy ghost he would be incapable of loving with a gop of love but then watched when peter has a gop of love they go to crucify peter peter said i'm not worthy think about this i'm not worthy to be crucified like my lord is it crucified me upside down that was a gospel of so i'm not worthy to be crucified like him but peter was willing to give his life yeah you don't hear him saying please don't crucify me he just said don't crucify me like that crucify me upside down peter was willing to give his life for the gospel that's godly love now you think about people that will miss this rapture and if they're given a choice while you join this or you bow to this you know like the the shadrach meshach and abednego they said if you bow to this idol talk among yourself boys come up with an answer and they said oh king we don't need to take counsel we're not going to bow it's because they loved they loved god but see how is somebody who missed the rapture how they going to overcome these things when all they had was a human love won't be able to because at that time all that had the godly love will have been gone in the rapture love god with the human love then you're constantly torn between love of this world and love for god because that's you're loving with the human love you love these things of the world and you say well i love god i don't want to go to hell i want to go in the rapture but i i really love these other things over here and they're torn between you see the spirit minds the things of the soul and desires for the things the soul desires but the flesh the the it desires for the things of the flesh it's carnally minded which we find as enmity with god and there are people that get caught between that and they struggle but once you've been born again what happens is you receive that agape love then there's no more struggle now let me just make something clear here you can you could there could be things like your your dog or your i don't know your clothes your car your house these things you love and you love them with the human love the degree of human love and that's not adultery on god but if you take and direct that divine love what should be toward only toward god and direct it at those things then you're committing adultery on god your husband but you know i had someone some years ago that kept saying they i'm trying i really want to serve god i really want to serve god but you know i like cocaine and i i like marijuana and i like doing these things you know and they were struggling but it was because they were trying to come to god of their own accord of their own mind they were trying to do it on it with a carnal mind you see god's love doesn't reason human love will reason human love is intellectual and it'll reason but god's love won't reason god's love is based on the word look human love is based on emotions and when people love god with the human love then it's based on how they feel and they you know maybe some things will start to go wrong and they'll begin to think well uh why is all these things happen to me don't god love me that's because they're loving with the human love and they're looking at god with the human love and they're expecting god to love them with that same kind of love and so there's a question there does he love me look yes he does but with the god of love and then a god of love allows things to come your way in order to mold you and shape you to reign in the time of the millennium it's to mold you and shape you to get you ready to live in a new heaven and a new earth you know after the time of the millennium we're raised back up and then the earth's burnt over the heavens has burnt over the atmosphere right and then god makes a new heaven and a new earth makes it i ain't worried about the ozone layer i'm not worried about global warming because i'm looking to a new earth and then after that we come back down and live for eternity on the new earth god's preparing us for that now that's why he allows us to go through things and god will allow you to be tested so that you can take inventory of yourself he'll allow you to be tested so you can say am i loving god with the human love or am i loving me with the god beloved the bible says set your affections on things above not on things of this earth well yeah i love god but i love to go out and kind of have a good time you know i have a good time i believe in having a good time it's just it differs what they think is a good time what i think is a good time i i don't i don't think going out and getting plastered and waking up the next morning with a hangover is a good time i don't think getting out and running around your wife is a good time i think serving the lord is a good time i enjoy hearing the testimonies of the people of what god does in their lives that's a good time hearing about how something was coming against them and how god delivered them when you can get into the presence of god maybe you've been praying and then maybe been listening to a message or something or reading your bible or a book and all of a sudden something just strikes you in the spirit and then something just sinks down in there you know and and you just get beside yourself and you just start having a hallelujah breakdown that's a good time remember brother branham said he was out there hunting and remember that and he got to watching those those eagles and what was going on and he got all happy and seeing god in nature and that he leaned his rifle up against the tree and he said he he uh got all beside himself started running around the tree he said a little squirrel came down and began to chatter at him all right what are you running around the tree for days miracles are passed what are you all happy about for don't you know how life is he said he just ran around the tree again he was having a good time out there all by himself hallelujah look you don't got to come to church to get in the spirit you ought to get in the spirit and bring it with you many of you know brother ron spencer some years ago he was asked to go hunting in a certain place and uh and asked us to preach at this church and there was a couple of men there were husbands of women that was in the church and they had kind of set up for them to go hunting with him and i i don't remember now i don't think they got anything on that hunt but brother ron got them two men saved all out there in the woods and they had a good time hallelujah god doesn't want you to divide the love you have for him with anything he doesn't want you to divide your love between him and your wife well you know if she goes to church then i'll go no god wants you to put him first and i have found over the years that's where some folks have their problem at they come to me with different problems in their family and different problems going on and i find out the thing it is they haven't put god first brother biscuit i went and heard him preach one time or actually speak i should say he was speaking to ministers and he said people come to me for counseling he said you know he doesn't take care of the books and all those things of the church he don't know who does what who gives who doesn't or whatever but he said when people come to him for counseling with problems he said the first thing i have them ask him are you giving your tithe and offer because if you're not doing that then that's where you the first part of your problems at you see you've got to put god first oh they don't need my money that's where you're wrong it ain't your money according to the bible ten percent comes off the top and then your offerings come then after that and that all the tithing it already belonged to god you haven't accomplished anything you just gave god back what was his already but when you're giving you offerings that's when you're really giving to god something that belongs to you you've got to have god first in your life he's got to be before your husband before your wife before your children god will not take second place he's got to have first place in your life and and it re it solves a lot of your trouble when you've got him in first place because then a lot of your questions about whether i should do this or whether i should do that get answered amen and if there's i've always done it this way if there's a doubt then just don't do it you know brother ram said check your motives and objectives right but if there's any doubt then just leave it alone you got a control tower it's in your soul that control tower see from there it comes out that godly love and that control tower also if you'll yield be yielded to god who dwells on the inside it'll con it'll take control of that spirit and control your gate of affection forgive me i just been preaching i don't even know where i'm at in these notes christ revealed his own word brother ram says therefore whatever the will of god is let god's will be done whether i'm happy with it or not i want to live so he will be pleased with what i do check your objective and your motive by that you'll know whether you love god or not what if he'd say you serve me but i'm going to cast you away would you say i love you anyhow now genuine love for god no matter what part i am lord if i can only say a word for it to help protect it let me do that that's the same thing would be with your wife if you really love her not affiliate love but agape love a genuine love brother madam gives an example and he says if you love your wife with filial love he said if some body insulted her said you know you would want a defender he said you'd want you may even want to shoot him he said but if you had a godly love you'd pray for him that's different then he goes on another place and begins to say about talking about love and for your wife and your husband and so forth and he said if you loved a woman and you you wanted to make her your wife but she didn't want to be with you she had loved someone else he said if you really loved her right with the godly love you would want her to be happy you'd want her to be with who she wanted to be with but if you're not loving or right then what are you going to do you're going to try to force the issue i'll leave that the great need the world is dying for today is and and god is love you find in the church what hindered the church was the wrong conception of love there's two different types of love that's real love one of them is called agapio that's god love then there's the perverted love which is filial love which means human love video comes from the word fellowship and he says filial love is accompanied by jealousy but agape love is god's love is the beginning of love it's the fountain of love and the church today is lacking that real agapial love that will make you love your enemy i will tell you something friends you'll never be able to love your enemy with human love if that's what you're relying on it won't work i can tell you right now i do not filio any of my enemies but agape love will make you pray for agape love will make you look beyond that maybe see it ain't really that person that's your enemy it's the devil that's got to hold up and you can pray for their deliverance i've been there i've got i've got a son-in-law that tells you about it every time he comes and visits you first john chapter 2 verse 14 says i have written unto you fathers because ye have known him that is from the beginning and i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and ye have overcome the wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in it you know brother branham said in the message i believe you that i can do this he says i love to hear an organ brother branham was one man spoke to him and and said brother branham said i i've got something against you and he said what's that he said you have music in your church and brother branham says well god loves music he said oh no no no he can't he brother brahmana said well you know one time there was a prophet that had kind of got beside himself got really upset because of what had been come and told to it and he and he couldn't get in the spirit and he couldn't prophesy and so he called for a minstrel when they come and played and brother m said they played a real holy ghost song and after they began to play then he began to get free up in the spirit and was able to prophesy then he said if god loved music back then he still loves it today because the bible says he's the same yesterday today and forever satan we know has perverted music and that's you know the bible says that uh uh lucifer the workmanship of his table uh tabarets and pipes with him the day he was created he took and con and perverted that from a worship to god to a worship to himself but god loves music and he loves music in the church and if music would get the spirit of god to move on the prophet brother graham said the music in a church can get the spirit of god moving in the church and it doesn't have to be dead it doesn't have to be funeral music it reminds me i think it was if i'm right it was brother bosworth that was in the hospital dying and they were closing the blinds you know and singing these songs you know just kind of weepy songs and he said who's dying here me or you he said sing some happy songs you can you can worship the lord there can be life in your services singing music and dancing some people used to dance in front of everybody for the devil but now are ashamed to dance for the lord in the church [Applause] brother branham said he went and visited some pentecostal people he says and they got happy in the spirit and began to dance and you know and so he got to kind of doing some research on it and found out that when the children of israel had crossed over the red sea the miriam took up her her uh tambourine and began to dance and said when they brought the ark of the covenant back into jerusalem what david got out before it and danced he said so i see the dancing is of god just the devil perverted it he it it wasn't his he copied something that was of god said he was preaching on the second coming of of jesus christ and there was some some people that had come down come from louisville to come in to visit and he said they uh put a note up there they had a song and so these uh young women got up and began to sing this song and one of them was played on the piano and it was uh there's going to be a meeting in the air and as they were going through it and they just kept singing and kept playing and after a while one of them got to dancing brother ram said his first thought was oh my in my own church i'm really going to hear it for this he said but then after a bit he said he found out he was tapping his foot and he said he thought my that must be the methodist foot and he said his foot just got tapping and tapping he said next thing you know he said i was out there dancing with her he said i got in the spirit i got the victory he said that's what it was i just didn't have enough victory and he and he said people say well now all right if it's in order he said if it's of god it'll be in order it'll it'll be uh presentable if it's of god don't worry about it i've seen your senior pastor one time take off running from here it looked like he was going to run through that door i was up here preaching he ran over at that wall turned around and ran back he got happy got beside himself after he'd done that another brother jumped up began to run around the building this has been years ago way past 20 some years ago before i ever moved down to tennessee hallelujah your love ought to be toward christ but satan perverts that love to something to the world god made man in his mechanism to thirst for god's life and satan perverts it over and tries to satisfy that blessed thirst with sin that's what makes women smoke cigarettes what makes men smoke cigarettes what makes you get out and strip yourself off on the streets that's what makes people do the way they do that's what makes the men and women live dishonorable to one another it's the reason they stay home on wednesday night and watch i love susie or something like that instead of staying at prayer meeting and it's because the devil has given you a lemon he's perverted that godly thirst in you trying to satisfy you with his own slop out of hell but god made you to thirst for him brother branham had come back from a trip he was in jeffersonville and he got back in he wasn't feeling well and his stomach was really bothering me and he thought maybe about maybe he wouldn't go over to the service you know and uh brother neville was going to be speaking and brother branham thought maybe he wouldn't go over the service he just wasn't feeling well and he said you know if i'd if i hadn't went he said i wouldn't have been lost right he said but i i got up and went anyway he said you know why i went because i love god amen hallelujah i win anyway because i love god amen it's a thirst for god that brings you here it's the thirst for god that makes you get off a shift at work you know and maybe hurdly try to eat some supper and try to get ready to get in over here or maybe sometimes people i've seen him come straight from work what is it's a love for god someone says hey why don't you come out and have dinner with me on thursday night and oh i can i'm going to church and it ain't because you have to go to church it isn't because it's a law it's because you love god you can't wait to get there brother brown said if you've got the holy ghost you can't wait for them church doors to open if you've got the real love of god in your heart you can't wait to get here that's the real love of god you see satan wants to put a damper on that many times he'll he'll you know bring something to get people all upset on thursday night everything's going fine monday tuesday wednesday but on thursday something gets you know a hair gets in the biscuit and uh you know it seemed like you know then after a bit and said well nobody feels like going that's just the devil trying to throw something in there to hinder you come anyhow realize who that is that's just the devil and if you love god you'll overcome that devil because greater is he that's in you and what is it that's in you it's god and what is god the bible said god is love satan is always trying to get something fumbled up in your mind but shut your affections on things above where christ sits at the right hand of god and remember this the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever and if his spirit be here he reveals things today as he did in days gone by and then in another message what he saith unto you do it brother braham's praying he says and may the lord reveal himself to each one of you tonight in such a way you'll set your affections toward jesus christ the holy ghost will make you live a holy life that's what the holy ghost power is for is to set your affections on things above the mind of christ in you you can't help from seeing those things hallelujah when you look at him you turn your head that's right it'll make you turn your head you say i can't do it oh i just can't do it sure you can't but the holy spirit come for that purpose that's what it did it come to take it out of you all them old habits and things you're doing that old backbiting separating yourself saying uh i i don't want nothing to do with them holy rollers the holy ghost come to take that out of you falling apart of this world the room says there's to be a new heaven come forth and a new earth which will never part again as long as eternity lasts we're looking for that new heaven and earth this one you have you this one you can have all you want for me i want that one it depends on where you set your affections it depends on what post you tied to if you tied anything in this world any politics and things like that and trust in that you'll sink with it you're like god's love brings a real true trust in god with god's love you'll see things moving and you don't think well god's frowning on me set your affections on things above where have you got your affection set on amen let's stand
