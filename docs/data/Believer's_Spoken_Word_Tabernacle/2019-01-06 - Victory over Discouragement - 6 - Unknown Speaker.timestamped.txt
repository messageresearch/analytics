[40:33] few things that I'll share on my heart
[40:36] and I thought I was going to do that
[40:43] this past Thursday but it wasn't really
[40:45] planned out that well so I wanted to let
[40:47] you know well ahead of time I just my
[40:56] heart was just has just been sold
[40:58] I'm always rejoicing in the word of the
[41:01] Lord and I just always thank God for the
[41:03] simplicity of the word because of the
[41:06] Holy Spirit
[41:07] it's come here in this hour the Word of
[41:10] God the Bible is just it's a brand-new
[41:13] book amen it's a it's an ancient book
[41:16] but it's become a new book to us and we
[41:20] just thank God for that and just so
[41:23] thank God for His mercy so we want to
[41:26] look here at verse three well we read a
[41:28] few verses scripture and then we'll let
[41:29] you be seated verse three said blessed
[41:33] be the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[41:36] Christ which according to his abundant
[41:39] mercy has begotten us again unto a
[41:44] lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus
[41:47] Christ from the dead to an inheritance
[41:50] incorruptible and undefiled and that
[41:54] fadeth not away reserved in heaven for
[41:58] you who are kept by the power of God
[42:05] through faith unto salvation ready to be
[42:09] revealed in the last time wherein you
[42:13] greatly rejoice though now for a season
[42:15] if need be you are in heaviness through
[42:19] manifold temptations look at that verse
[42:22] 6 again wherein you greatly rejoice for
[42:26] what God has done and for what he has
[42:29] brought us to that realization by the
[42:33] indwelling of His Spirit we have a body
[42:36] reserved in the heavens and in that we
[42:40] greatly greatly rejoice then it unfolds
[42:46] and after that comma
[42:47] though now for a season if need be ye
[42:52] are in heaviness through manifold
[42:55] temptations that the trial of your faith
[42:58] being much more precious than a gold
[43:01] that perishes though it be tried with
[43:04] fire might be found unto praise and
[43:07] honor and glory at the appearing of
[43:11] Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye
[43:16] love in whom though now you see him not
[43:19] yet believing ye rejoice with joy
[43:23] unspeakable and full of glory very
[43:28] important it didn't say that ye rejoice
[43:31] with happiness happiness comes and goes
[43:34] joy remains joy is in the depths of our
[43:39] soul in that wonderful happiness is
[43:44] something you can be up and it can be
[43:46] down but joy itself it comes from
[43:49] knowing in whom we have believed and
[43:52] that's where when all there's no other
[43:54] ground to stand on we stand in him no
[43:59] wonder Paul could say having done all to
[44:00] stand stand therefore having you know
[44:05] your loins Girt about with truth and he
[44:07] goes on through that notice let's read
[44:10] verse 9 receiving the end of your faith
[44:15] even the salvation of your souls
[44:18] of which salvation the prophets have
[44:22] inquired and searched diligently who
[44:26] prophesied of the grace that should come
[44:29] unto you searching what or what manner
[44:33] of time the Spirit of Christ which was
[44:37] in them did signify when it testified
[44:41] beforehand the sufferings of Christ and
[44:44] the glory that should follow may God
[44:46] bless you
[44:47] bless the reading of his word your being
[44:49] seated
[45:08] I want to just draw your attention here
[45:11] brother Brian I don't know if it's the
[45:13] base or what it's a little bit I'm
[45:14] getting a little bit of rebound up here
[45:18] it's not a ring it's just a little bit
[45:20] maybe much on me right now
[45:22] don't don't necessarily take these
[45:24] things down so much but it might be the
[45:26] base the scripture I want you to notice
[45:30] here the verses that we've read it's it
[45:35] declares to us of what God has done for
[45:41] us
[45:42] through the Lord Jesus Christ where that
[45:46] he has brought us to himself and through
[45:51] this birth within our life it brings us
[45:55] to the realization that we were always a
[45:59] part of him and it makes us aware that
[46:03] we have a body reserved in the heavens
[46:07] that body is undefiled it's
[46:10] uncorruptible that body was not made by
[46:14] man that body was made by God
[46:18] it's eternal with God it is our
[46:21] representation before the throne of God
[46:24] another term that we use and to know it
[46:27] is our theophany our word body it is
[46:32] that that is not terrestrial but a
[46:34] celestial body and to know that how that
[46:37] God hasn't has already prepared and God
[46:42] coming in dealing with our lives was no
[46:45] accident it was not something that you
[46:49] II just happened upon but God knows and
[46:53] knew where each of us were at and when
[46:56] God became flesh he took on flesh
[46:59] remember the purpose of redemption was
[47:03] not of a wholesale affair the purpose of
[47:06] redemption he became flesh the Bible
[47:10] says the Son of man has come to seek and
[47:12] save that which was lost
[47:14] so he come Redemption is to bring back
[47:17] what belongs to him
[47:19] and that's the heart
[47:21] of the scriptures that's the heart of
[47:23] the gospel there's many that will
[47:25] believe in the purchase that was made
[47:28] but never come to the full realization
[47:31] of what it's all about because
[47:34] redemption is for the elect of God the
[47:37] predestinated in mind it doesn't mean
[47:40] that everything comes easy it doesn't
[47:42] mean that everything's gonna be handed
[47:44] to us on a on a cake platter but what it
[47:47] simply means is is that God himself has
[47:49] ordained and chosen us and God will be
[47:52] the one and he is the one that brings us
[47:55] to himself by the way that he has made I
[47:59] think we gather that and understand that
[48:03] and Peter it goes on to speak here
[48:06] within these scriptures of the receiving
[48:10] you'll make this statement in verse 9
[48:12] receiving the end of our faith even the
[48:14] salvation of our souls so to think of
[48:18] how that even he goes on to speak in
[48:20] verse 10 in verse 11 of how that the
[48:22] prophets of old they prophesied and they
[48:26] spoke of this of this coming time and
[48:29] they were not just speaking of just the
[48:33] advent and the coming of the Messiah but
[48:36] with an awareness that he would come and
[48:39] then to restore the kingdom and so
[48:42] they're looking for this knowing that
[48:43] this this is to come and has Peter's
[48:47] picks picks this up the prophets
[48:49] prophesied by the Spirit of God that was
[48:52] upon them though with the Spirit of
[48:54] Christ within them they themselves did
[48:57] not know when it was going to occur or
[49:00] when it was going to happen but what
[49:04] they knew is that what God had given
[49:07] them even that which we pointed to the
[49:10] leading up of the Messiah and even that
[49:13] which had been spoken that would point
[49:15] to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
[49:17] even that which would point to that of
[49:20] the Gentile bride as you see that many
[49:22] times in the Old Testament even to that
[49:24] which points to the rapture even that
[49:27] which points you know into the
[49:29] Millennium in the future home and so
[49:30] forth all of that is there within the
[49:33] Old Testament here you have with
[49:35] in the Old Testament everything that's
[49:37] laid out but yet those the prophets when
[49:39] they were speaking they did not know the
[49:42] time the Spirit of God through Peter
[49:44] here says in verse 11 or in verse 12 the
[49:47] salvation the prophets have inquired and
[49:49] searched diligently who prophesied of
[49:52] the grace that should come to you they
[49:53] were looking you see when the Spirit of
[49:56] God dealt with their lives they were
[49:57] looking for this to come they were
[50:00] expecting and it goes on in the very
[50:03] next scripture searching what or what
[50:05] manner of time the Spirit of Christ
[50:07] which was in them did signify when it
[50:09] testified before the sufferings of
[50:12] Christ and the glory that should follow
[50:13] you see they didn't know when everything
[50:17] was going to transpire they did not know
[50:19] when everything was going to happen but
[50:21] they stood upon the word that God had
[50:25] given them to stand upon and to think
[50:28] that how that Peter would you know pick
[50:31] this up here within these scriptures and
[50:33] he would go on to further speak of our
[50:36] conduct and I'm not going to read it for
[50:38] sake of time but Peter would go on to
[50:41] speak of this and he moves to this place
[50:45] in the scriptures and he says if we can
[50:48] in the in the verse 18 he says for as
[50:51] much as you know that you were not
[50:53] redeemed with corruptible things as
[50:56] silver and gold from your vain
[50:59] conversation received by the tradition
[51:03] from your father's but with the precious
[51:06] blood of Christ as of a lamb without
[51:10] blemish and without spot I want you to
[51:13] notice this we have been redeemed and
[51:16] Peter remember who is speaking to even
[51:19] as remembered when brother Jason DeMars
[51:20] was here he pointed this out here were
[51:22] Jews that were scattered throughout and
[51:24] here the Holy Spirit is making this
[51:26] known you have been redeemed back to God
[51:29] and you are redeemed here and and from
[51:33] the vain conversation of traditions that
[51:36] you've received from your fathers and in
[51:38] in in how that God has brought you and I
[51:41] not to dead works but to a living works
[51:43] remember living works is by a living
[51:47] faith and so then the work
[51:49] those things that are declared and are
[51:51] brought forth out of our life the
[51:53] Prophet would call it like this and
[51:55] works his faith Express he says it is a
[51:57] holy faith bringing forth
[51:59] holy works so it's not our works it's
[52:03] the Spirit of Christ working in us and
[52:06] through us now think of this here he
[52:10] goes on to make this statement he says
[52:13] who
[52:14] verily was foreordained look at this now
[52:16] verse 20 who verily was foreordained
[52:18] before the foundation of the world but
[52:21] was manifest in these last times for you
[52:23] who by him do believe in God that raised
[52:26] him up from the dead and gave him glory
[52:29] that your faith and hope might be in God
[52:32] seeing ye have purified your souls in
[52:36] obeying the truth through the spirit
[52:39] unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see
[52:43] that you love one another with a pure
[52:44] heart fervently being born again not of
[52:47] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[52:50] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[52:53] forever for all flesh notice I picks
[52:56] this up now for all flesh is as grass
[52:59] and all the glory of man as the flower
[53:02] of grass the grass withereth and the
[53:05] flower thereof falleth away but the word
[53:08] of the Lord and do it forever and this
[53:11] is the word which by the gospel is
[53:13] preached unto you there is a part of us
[53:18] we've been born again of the Spirit of
[53:20] God that is eternal it does not fade
[53:24] away but it comes more into view in our
[53:29] lives and yet our outside there is a
[53:33] fading away there is we see it just in
[53:37] our natural bodies the everything we
[53:40] feel different things that we never felt
[53:41] before we see the things of aging but
[53:44] yet on the inside on the inside of the
[53:47] inside there is no weakness but rather
[53:51] it gets more glorious and we find that
[53:55] it's Christ Himself being formed in our
[53:58] life and more and more
[54:01] as we walk with him our lives are to be
[54:04] reflecting Christ more and more just
[54:07] like as it came through the church ages
[54:10] it's the same way that it is coming even
[54:13] within our lives as individuals so Peter
[54:16] within the whole portion even of these
[54:19] scriptures Peter is bringing such a
[54:22] relativity or such a reality that the
[54:26] glory of man it fades but the word of
[54:29] the Lord endures and this in itself is
[54:32] brought to light through the unfolding
[54:35] of the life of Christ think of this
[54:37] Peter could not have even spoken these
[54:40] words had it not been for the revelation
[54:44] of the suffering of the Lord Jesus
[54:47] Christ and that of redemption whereby
[54:50] Peter himself becomes a partaker of that
[54:54] sane life this would not be something
[54:57] that Peter could even declare but Peter
[55:00] is standing here declaring this with an
[55:03] assurance that this life is not all
[55:07] there is this life is just merely a
[55:10] passing that's it it passes by so
[55:15] quickly but yet though this life our
[55:18] journey everything is so vitally
[55:22] important and how God is working in our
[55:25] lives and this is where that in the time
[55:28] that as we deal with things go through
[55:31] certain things as we've been looking on
[55:33] this victory over discouragement there's
[55:36] things that can come our way that can be
[55:38] very discouraging all things all around
[55:41] us to try to discourage us sometimes
[55:44] even when it comes to infirmities and
[55:46] sufferings and things within our body
[55:48] sometimes there's things that you've
[55:50] prayed about and here it is a week weeks
[55:52] months and things themselves it seems as
[55:54] it continues to linger you know you can
[55:57] become very despondent or Vera or
[56:00] discouraged but yet within it all where
[56:03] Peter directs our attention within this
[56:06] suffering that takes place is to know
[56:09] what God has done for us and to know
[56:12] that then either suffering that we're
[56:14] going
[56:15] through is just as temporary as this
[56:18] life is right now it's only for a season
[56:21] and we have a body that's waiting there
[56:24] brother bantam places it like this
[56:27] pardon me he places it in this manner in
[56:36] the message who is this Melchizedek and
[56:39] he speaks of their in in Corinthians 2nd
[56:44] Corinthians if this earthly body be
[56:47] dissolved this earthly Tabernacle we
[56:49] have another one we have bypassed that
[56:53] to come straight from God the attribute
[56:56] to be flesh to be tempted and tested by
[57:00] sin you know it's very simple if you
[57:08] think of it in this way let's say that
[57:10] there are brakes that they're going they
[57:11] need to put on a 747 all right
[57:17] that's a jet let's just say that those
[57:20] brakes now let's say that the
[57:22] engineering of those brakes and they
[57:24] make them and then they bring it into
[57:26] their test lab and the guys are designed
[57:29] to say no no don't test it
[57:32] no don't test it I would say well you
[57:36] already sound like you have doubts but
[57:40] you see the part of the testing is only
[57:44] to prove what is strong and what is weak
[57:50] the testing does not take away from it
[57:54] being brakes the testing does not make
[57:58] it breaks that's that's exactly how it
[58:03] is and I hope we've got that example
[58:05] when it's gold the proving doesn't make
[58:08] it gold the proving only reveals the
[58:12] gold that's all the testing does it only
[58:16] brings to light what is already there so
[58:20] it doesn't change anything it doesn't
[58:23] add to it just simply brings to light
[58:26] what's there so then
[58:28] this is where the profit is he saying we
[58:31] bypassed that we came straight from God
[58:34] the attribute to be flesh to be tempted
[58:37] and tested by sin but when testing of
[58:40] his word is over then we are taken up to
[58:45] this body that was prepared for us
[58:47] before the foundation of the world it is
[58:49] the word there that we skip to come
[58:52] right around down here to be tempted and
[58:54] tested
[58:55] he said if we're to come through that
[58:56] there'd have been no temptation we
[58:58] didn't know it all things that's the
[59:00] reason Jesus knowed all things because
[59:02] he was the word before he was flesh then
[59:05] we become the word and he says here we
[59:08] are formed to the word image to be a
[59:11] partaker of the word feed on the word by
[59:15] being predestinated since the beginning
[59:18] so it is as he goes on to talk about
[59:21] that spark of life that which was hungry
[59:23] that which was in you already that was
[59:25] desiring was looking for God it was
[59:28] looking for that counterpart it was
[59:31] desiring and how that God Himself by the
[59:35] deposit here is the seed of God within
[59:38] our life and then by the deposit of his
[59:41] seed life
[59:42] coming and quickening that seed and
[59:44] raising it up remember the seed within
[59:47] it has everything already and it just
[59:51] has to be quickened and come forth once
[59:54] it's been quickened it grows in the
[59:57] atmosphere and the presence and the
[1:00:00] image of Christ is being formed and
[1:00:02] coming forth in our life that is the
[1:00:04] forming into the word image let me just
[1:00:07] drop this here and I'm not gonna labor
[1:00:09] on this when we are born again of the
[1:00:11] Spirit of God in our soul we are fully
[1:00:14] adopted in our soul fully but after this
[1:00:21] now brings way for us to have a Dominion
[1:00:24] to have a life within us that the desire
[1:00:27] that we live by we no longer are living
[1:00:30] by their old at dimming nature but we're
[1:00:32] living by the nature of that second atom
[1:00:35] and our desire is
[1:00:37] please the Lord that's why that we bring
[1:00:40] our lives in subjection to the word amen
[1:00:44] that's why we submit our lives in
[1:00:46] humility because our desire is to please
[1:00:48] the Lord not to think of this this
[1:00:52] testimony that Peter himself he shares
[1:00:56] this now I want you to think about this
[1:00:58] for a moment here you have where the
[1:01:01] scripture would speak in the Gospels of
[1:01:04] how that Peter was one when the Bible
[1:01:07] says that Jesus would begin to speak to
[1:01:09] them concerning the suffering that the
[1:01:12] Son of Man should suffer remember it was
[1:01:15] Peter who took him by the hand and the
[1:01:18] Bible says begin to rebuke him and say
[1:01:21] it shall not be so Lord and remember the
[1:01:25] disciples themselves you see the
[1:01:28] disciples they they recognized who the
[1:01:32] Lord Jesus was by revelation and yet
[1:01:36] they also did not see they did not see
[1:01:39] the necessity of suffering in order to
[1:01:42] bring Redemption they did not see a
[1:01:45] price had to be paid and in reality the
[1:01:47] Pharisees didn't see that either the
[1:01:50] Pharisees did not see that neither did
[1:01:52] the Pharisees relieve or recognize there
[1:01:55] had to come a change in their lives they
[1:02:00] believed they were free you see what
[1:02:04] they declared as freedom is what I'm
[1:02:06] able to do and conform outwardly to I'm
[1:02:10] able to conform to all of the traditions
[1:02:12] all the oriole I'm able to conform to
[1:02:15] that but you see were not to be
[1:02:17] conformed were to be transformed
[1:02:21] conforming can take place by good
[1:02:24] morality strong demeanors and many
[1:02:26] things like that but a transformation
[1:02:29] requires the power of Almighty God to
[1:02:34] lift you and I from the condition we
[1:02:36] were born in and bring us into a place
[1:02:39] in the kingdom of his dearly beloved son
[1:02:42] that's what the purchase of the blood
[1:02:45] did for you and I it now released the
[1:02:49] power of God
[1:02:50] that's able to bring us into a place of
[1:02:54] reality where we are living by his power
[1:02:59] his strength by a living faith and what
[1:03:04] a contrast this is to what Peter has has
[1:03:07] where he has been before Pentecost
[1:03:10] remember Peter spoke many bold things
[1:03:13] before Pentecost but he didn't have what
[1:03:16] it took to back up what he was saying
[1:03:19] but you see now that his faith has been
[1:03:22] quickened watch this in 1st Peter 3:18
[1:03:25] the Bible said for Christ also hath once
[1:03:29] suffered for sins the just for the
[1:03:32] unjust that he might bring us to God
[1:03:35] being put to death in the flesh but
[1:03:38] quickened by the Spirit what I want you
[1:03:40] to see is Peter here is clearly pointing
[1:03:43] out the suffering was not in vain it was
[1:03:48] for a purpose you see because when the
[1:03:51] disciples out when the Lord Jesus had
[1:03:54] been taken
[1:03:54] they were distraught what has taken
[1:03:57] place here it's like everything has been
[1:03:59] ruined the whole thing has been messed
[1:04:01] up we thought he was the one that was
[1:04:03] going to redeem Israel he is the
[1:04:05] Redeemer but there must be suffering and
[1:04:08] here this is something that we find so
[1:04:12] clear within the scriptures here as
[1:04:14] Peter is pointing out this suffering was
[1:04:17] with a purpose
[1:04:19] he went there with you and me in mind
[1:04:22] and we were in him God did not come down
[1:04:26] haphazardly and wonder is somebody going
[1:04:29] to feel sorry for me he went with a
[1:04:32] purpose there was a purpose for what he
[1:04:36] endured the Bible says in Hebrews 12
[1:04:39] that he endured the cross if it's
[1:04:46] something delightful you don't have to
[1:04:48] endure it are you with me
[1:04:51] those words don't come up endurance
[1:04:53] comes up when there is great opposition
[1:04:55] when there is great pressure when
[1:04:58] everything all types of discouragements
[1:05:00] can kind of try to come your way but
[1:05:02] sinn here Jesus chose to focus not on
[1:05:06] the cross but on the joy he was an
[1:05:12] example for us so this was a purpose
[1:05:15] that had to be remember he had to go to
[1:05:17] Calvary there had to be an offering up a
[1:05:20] suffering of purchase had to be made for
[1:05:23] us so it was with the purpose in 1st
[1:05:25] Peter chapter 4 verse 1 and verse 2
[1:05:29] pardon me verse 1 for as much than as
[1:05:37] Christ had suffered for us in the flesh
[1:05:41] no look on the scripture it's dealing
[1:05:44] with this where he went to Calvary for
[1:05:48] us he hath suffered for us in the flesh
[1:05:50] who is he suffering for for us see this
[1:05:55] is Peters dealing with this depth this
[1:05:57] suffering here that the Lord Jesus
[1:05:59] Christ he was not just suffering but
[1:06:02] this suffering that he was enduring was
[1:06:05] for us so you realize a great principle
[1:06:10] and suffering suffering is not just
[1:06:12] always about us and the molding of our
[1:06:15] character but suffering itself is also
[1:06:18] for the benefit of others arm yourselves
[1:06:23] look how Peter says arm yourselves this
[1:06:25] this word arm is just a very powerful
[1:06:27] word arm yourselves likewise with the
[1:06:30] same mind it means to have that same
[1:06:31] military expedition arm yourself with
[1:06:34] likewise with that same mind for he then
[1:06:37] hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased
[1:06:39] from sin this is where Peters letting us
[1:06:41] know he that have died to sin when it's
[1:06:44] laid the old and old man down when in it
[1:06:47] come to God and said Lord I no longer
[1:06:49] want to walk this way I want to accept
[1:06:52] the salvation of the Lord Lord I want to
[1:06:55] receive your life and me I want to be
[1:06:57] sanctified I want to receive that life
[1:07:00] that token that assurance and this is
[1:07:02] what Peter is speaking of because
[1:07:04] remember with this suffering of the Lord
[1:07:07] Jesus he did not lose power he gained
[1:07:11] power
[1:07:13] he stood in the midst of the disciples
[1:07:14] and he says all power in heaven and
[1:07:18] earth is given unto me
[1:07:20] he gained power through his suffering oh
[1:07:25] my that he look at this that he no
[1:07:30] longer should live the rest of his time
[1:07:33] in the flesh to the lust of men you help
[1:07:36] a birth of birth is a painful thing a
[1:07:41] birth does not listen a birth is not
[1:07:44] schooled into you the Holy Ghost is not
[1:07:47] schooled into anybody
[1:07:49] it's predestinated experiences with God
[1:07:57] it's not something you can teach in it
[1:08:00] it has to be something that's a call
[1:08:02] it's a yearning for life that's what
[1:08:05] it's calling for it's not calling for a
[1:08:07] display it's yearning for life because
[1:08:10] that's what the Holy Spirit is it's life
[1:08:13] you recognize if that life that same
[1:08:16] spirit if it's not moved down into the
[1:08:19] soul where there now becomes a life that
[1:08:23] beats in pulsation and harmony with
[1:08:26] Almighty God it'll fade if it's just on
[1:08:30] the spirit it'll fade like the grass
[1:08:32] fades it will fade and wither just like
[1:08:35] our bodies do but when it comes to the
[1:08:38] owner of the soul when the Holy Spirit
[1:08:41] makes its way to that of the owner of
[1:08:44] the soul it is just as good tomorrow as
[1:08:48] it was two years ago or 50 years ago
[1:08:51] because it cannot corrupt nothing is
[1:08:55] wrong with the manna it's the location
[1:08:57] that it's held in that's why we don't
[1:09:02] want to just hold this Holy Spirit in
[1:09:05] our minds yet he wants our minds we
[1:09:08] don't want to hold it just in our spirit
[1:09:10] but we want it to be held in our soul to
[1:09:13] where we can say it's no longer I that
[1:09:17] liveth but Christ that liveth in
[1:09:20] me and this is what Peter is bringing to
[1:09:26] us here what this suffering here there's
[1:09:29] a need for a suffering there's a need
[1:09:31] for a dying out that leads to the
[1:09:35] suffering for his namesake for he said
[1:09:37] that he no longer should live the rest
[1:09:40] of his time in the flesh to the lust of
[1:09:43] men but to the will of God so now once
[1:09:48] this life has entered in we recognize
[1:09:52] that there is suffering according to the
[1:09:57] will of God Peter goes on to say in
[1:10:01] first Peter 5:1 the elders which are
[1:10:04] among you I exhort who am also an elder
[1:10:08] and a witness of the sufferings of
[1:10:12] Christ and also a partaker of the glory
[1:10:16] that shall be revealed Peter is lending
[1:10:19] note I'm a witness many suffered but I'm
[1:10:22] also also a witness of the glory that
[1:10:26] shall be revealed so have received of
[1:10:29] that life will read have been received
[1:10:31] of him and I recognize his suffering was
[1:10:35] for me he was wounded for my
[1:10:40] transgressions he was bruised for mine
[1:10:43] iniquities this is what Peter saying
[1:10:46] that realization that the sacrifice of
[1:10:49] Calvary
[1:10:50] I am a partaker of that live by a
[1:10:52] reality that I am free you see when that
[1:10:55] revelation strikes the heart of a person
[1:10:57] where you realize it's personally for me
[1:11:00] right there sin is dead it's done it's
[1:11:04] dead right there you recognize that that
[1:11:07] life it was for you you are the very
[1:11:11] reason that he gave his life for you and
[1:11:15] you recognize that he who is the judge
[1:11:19] became our attorney he went to Calvary
[1:11:24] and he took all the documents and riding
[1:11:27] and Horten it says that was against you
[1:11:30] and I and he blotted it out
[1:11:32] you know what he blotted out he didn't
[1:11:34] do away with the law he simply changed
[1:11:36] our nature so that we're no longer
[1:11:40] represented by that first Adam who sold
[1:11:43] us in the sin but we are represented by
[1:11:46] that second Adam unto righteousness
[1:11:49] we're under new representation repartee
[1:11:57] kurz of this Peter goes on to say at
[1:12:00] first Peter 2:21
[1:12:02] for even hereunto were you called
[1:12:06] because Christ also suffered for us
[1:12:09] leaving us an example that ye should
[1:12:12] follow his steps who did no sin neither
[1:12:17] was guile found in his mouth that's
[1:12:19] deceit who when he was reviled reviled
[1:12:22] not again when he suffered he threatened
[1:12:26] not you can go ahead and raise your hand
[1:12:29] and say help me Lord when he reviled he
[1:12:38] reviled not what we're looking at when
[1:12:43] we look at the word you recognize the
[1:12:46] life of the word when it's moved inside
[1:12:48] of you you no longer desire the world
[1:12:51] the love of the world is gone it's
[1:12:54] Christ and Christ alone and this is
[1:12:58] where we desire to police and this is
[1:13:00] where that the Spirit of God within us
[1:13:02] will bring conviction and strike our
[1:13:05] hearts and rather than whether something
[1:13:07] said or not even our thinking being
[1:13:09] wrong he was reviled he reviled not
[1:13:18] again when he suffered you see this is
[1:13:20] for you and I to have strength within it
[1:13:23] a faith that when we approach the word
[1:13:27] that you and I can look at that and say
[1:13:29] that though not in the same quantity but
[1:13:32] the same quality of life is in me you
[1:13:37] realize that when you take one drop and
[1:13:39] you've heard this before you take one
[1:13:41] little bit out of this lake and you take
[1:13:43] one little teaspoon
[1:13:44] within that one teaspoon it still has
[1:13:47] the same molecular structure and all
[1:13:50] those things all the components that's
[1:13:52] within the quantity there of that Lake
[1:13:54] brother saying you would know that more
[1:13:55] than me you have those things within
[1:13:58] there like that you see the Holy Spirit
[1:14:01] that part where God subdividing himself
[1:14:04] and give us that part of his life it has
[1:14:07] within it the same quality that was in
[1:14:11] the fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:14:13] that is why that Paul could speak to us
[1:14:16] as the elect children of God and say put
[1:14:19] on has the elect of God put on sink into
[1:14:25] and then he goes in two circumstances
[1:14:28] that come our way that will require us
[1:14:31] to lay down that other garment what's
[1:14:36] what he did this is this this scripture
[1:14:38] is just so phenomena tremendous one
[1:14:42] leadership here when he was reviled
[1:14:44] reviled not again when he suffered he
[1:14:45] threatened threatened not again look
[1:14:47] what he did but committed himself to him
[1:14:51] that judgeth righteously do you
[1:14:56] understand that the Lord Jesus was not
[1:14:58] suffering as being called a drunkard he
[1:15:03] was not being called well this guy
[1:15:04] running around with he's not that that's
[1:15:06] not he was standing for the word and
[1:15:10] when he was standing for the word that's
[1:15:14] why they hated him they said that would
[1:15:18] be a man make yourself God but look here
[1:15:21] in them very even in the pressure I want
[1:15:24] you to catch this here Peter here having
[1:15:26] an insight to be able to look and even
[1:15:29] through the stages where the Lord Jesus
[1:15:31] himself is even coming to this place
[1:15:34] through pilots Hall you know there in
[1:15:36] Herod's court and so forth here he is
[1:15:38] there before them all what did he do he
[1:15:41] committed himself to him that judgeth
[1:15:43] righteously that's something there that
[1:15:46] the only thing and the greatest thing
[1:15:47] that we can ever do in the midst of
[1:15:49] suffering and that will actually give us
[1:15:52] a release from discouragement to say
[1:15:54] Lord you're the judge of all this
[1:15:59] this scriptures pertains when you know
[1:16:02] listen you know standing for the word
[1:16:04] you're not going to be patted on the
[1:16:05] back you're gonna be misunderstood I'm
[1:16:11] not saying that we make ourselves
[1:16:12] misunderstood I'm saying that even to
[1:16:15] make a stand on the word of what God has
[1:16:18] made known to you it's not going to come
[1:16:20] without suffering
[1:16:21] it comes with suffering so this is a
[1:16:27] this is an angle this is a part within
[1:16:29] that suffering who his own self bare our
[1:16:32] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[1:16:35] being dead to sins should live unto
[1:16:36] righteousness by whose stripes you were
[1:16:39] healed for ye were as sheep going astray
[1:16:41] but are now returned under the Shepherd
[1:16:45] and Bishop of your souls he goes on to
[1:16:50] this here so here we are as sheep sheep
[1:16:53] we need to be led first Peter 5 verse 8
[1:16:58] Peter said be sober be vigilant because
[1:17:01] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[1:17:04] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:17:07] devour or destroy that's what he's doing
[1:17:13] whom resist how resistant steadfast in
[1:17:18] the faith so our resistance is by the
[1:17:24] power of God
[1:17:25] of the residing of God's faith in our
[1:17:28] life remember faith is not being able to
[1:17:34] explain what's going on
[1:17:37] faith is not being able to understand it
[1:17:40] and neither does faith require you to
[1:17:45] come back at the devil and throw the
[1:17:47] quote book at him and all the scriptures
[1:17:49] he's a liar you don't want to give time
[1:17:54] to a liar are you with me
[1:17:57] you come to a place in life that you
[1:17:59] recognize my time is too valuable to
[1:18:03] give
[1:18:05] you know I'm saying you can have
[1:18:08] situations where you run around the bush
[1:18:10] with a person and you finally come and
[1:18:12] say I ain't going around the bush no law
[1:18:14] we don't travel this bush we've done
[1:18:17] water pass in the ground ain't going
[1:18:19] there no more the Bible said when he
[1:18:25] came against them in the book of Jude a
[1:18:28] bringing railing accusation for him
[1:18:30] against that of Moses body the Bible
[1:18:33] didn't say that he went on this was
[1:18:34] going to be him that's going to be in
[1:18:35] that rate he said the Lord rebuke you in
[1:18:39] the Bible said it didn't bring railing
[1:18:41] accusation don't waste your time the
[1:18:43] satan already knows his outcome the
[1:18:45] purpose of him even talking to you is to
[1:18:48] try to discourage you Satan never comes
[1:18:52] to encourage you and believe me he'll
[1:18:59] use the word he knows the word yes he
[1:19:03] does he knows it he knows the quotes he
[1:19:07] knows how also to use them but I'll tell
[1:19:13] you when God gets a hold of it you watch
[1:19:15] the devil could run you down with
[1:19:17] scriptures and quotes and put it on such
[1:19:19] a way but you let a man of God surrender
[1:19:21] to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost
[1:19:22] take a hold of that word you watch it'll
[1:19:25] bring out a total different real light
[1:19:27] about it and it actually will back the
[1:19:30] devil right up you know why it matters
[1:19:32] who's handling the word so don't try to
[1:19:35] even handle the word with your mind amen
[1:19:40] just stand there steadfast in faith I
[1:19:49] know this is simple but sometimes when
[1:19:52] it's coming you just simply have to say
[1:19:54] thank you Jesus he comes again
[1:19:57] thank you Jesus he comes again thank you
[1:20:01] Lord he's a liar whom resist steadfast
[1:20:09] in the faith knowing this was important
[1:20:13] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:20:16] accomplished in your
[1:20:18] that are in the world you know what he's
[1:20:20] saying you put that devil on the run
[1:20:22] that says you're the only one this is
[1:20:26] happening to you because of you he said
[1:20:30] you need to be aware that the same
[1:20:31] afflictions they might come in different
[1:20:34] avenues but it's all working for the
[1:20:37] same purpose and this is where you need
[1:20:39] to stand that I'm not alone you know
[1:20:43] Jesus when he was going to Calvary he
[1:20:45] told him there in John 16 you're going
[1:20:47] to leave me alone but I'm not alone I'm
[1:20:50] not alone he said the father is with me
[1:20:54] I'm not alone the things that are
[1:20:57] happening you know
[1:20:58] the devil would like to make it out that
[1:21:00] you and I are odd balls
[1:21:02] the things that are happening to us oh
[1:21:04] it's so strange nobody else deals with
[1:21:08] that he's a liar he's alive that never
[1:21:12] come from God hmm nah but the grace of
[1:21:23] but the God of all Grace who has called
[1:21:26] her son to eternal glory by Christ Jesus
[1:21:28] after that ye have suffered a while make
[1:21:34] you perfect establish you strengthen you
[1:21:37] settle you to him be glory and Dominion
[1:21:40] for ever and ever amen
[1:21:44] now watch our Paul we'll pick this up
[1:21:47] here in 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 13 he
[1:21:50] said we have in the same spirit of faith
[1:21:51] according as it's written I believed and
[1:21:54] therefore have I spoken we also believe
[1:21:56] and therefore speak knowing that he
[1:21:58] which raised up the Lord Jesus shall
[1:22:00] raise up us also by Jesus and shall
[1:22:04] present us with you so you're going to
[1:22:08] be presented and we're going to be
[1:22:09] presented with you by the Lord Jesus
[1:22:13] after all of testing and proving is done
[1:22:17] he will raise us up with you and present
[1:22:21] us together for all things look at this
[1:22:23] in verse 15 for all things are for your
[1:22:26] sakes that the abundant grace might
[1:22:29] through the Thanksgiving a
[1:22:31] many read down to the glory of God for
[1:22:35] which cause we faint not for that cause
[1:22:42] you see for that cause Paul is
[1:22:45] establishing here as Peter has been
[1:22:47] laying out here is a purpose in
[1:22:50] suffering
[1:22:53] remember the Prophet takes us in that in
[1:22:56] many of the messages that he'll deal
[1:22:57] with from the resurrection proof of
[1:23:00] Resurrection and fallible proof grace
[1:23:01] newsflash in history there you know so
[1:23:04] far he'll go through all that and he's
[1:23:05] dealing with to where he says they come
[1:23:07] to a place they're walking on the road
[1:23:08] of Emmaus and they look at it just like
[1:23:10] it was like a waste what happened to him
[1:23:12] how could this have happened
[1:23:15] marketers you see their understanding
[1:23:17] was not opened within that as we've
[1:23:20] spoken there they didn't see that they
[1:23:22] looked at all of a sudden it's just like
[1:23:24] what what was the purpose of this they
[1:23:27] didn't see that and if we're honest
[1:23:30] there's many times most of the time we
[1:23:34] don't understand the purpose of what's
[1:23:36] going on we don't know that the tests
[1:23:41] and trials that we go through now we
[1:23:44] have no idea of what it is preparing us
[1:23:47] for we know and have an assurance
[1:23:50] it's a molding of our character we know
[1:23:52] that it's not accidental but it is
[1:23:56] predetermined by God but we don't know
[1:23:59] where one is God preparing us for oh
[1:24:04] brother Samuel he's preparing us for the
[1:24:07] other side I agree with that but
[1:24:09] remember there are things that God when
[1:24:12] he molds and shapes you and I he can
[1:24:14] mold and shape our life for just a
[1:24:17] moment's service he can mold and shape
[1:24:20] us for something further on down the
[1:24:22] line you see sometimes there's things
[1:24:25] you know pardon me
[1:24:37] I never forget when you know I had only
[1:24:40] been teaching for my second year and so
[1:24:45] I was very close to graduating with my
[1:24:48] masters are going to be going to I want
[1:24:51] to be a principal one of the things that
[1:24:55] you know one of the reasons that I
[1:24:56] wanted to be a principal because I knew
[1:24:59] I'd get more money and money was a need
[1:25:03] what I started out right out of college
[1:25:05] with was $23,000 as a teacher you think
[1:25:09] you begin to think man I went to school
[1:25:11] all this time but I never forget a
[1:25:15] gentleman that I had as the mentoring he
[1:25:17] was a prince the principal at the
[1:25:19] building a student taught at and you
[1:25:21] know I had had people that had I had not
[1:25:23] put my name in but I'd had people that I
[1:25:24] had associated with there in the school
[1:25:27] building where I taught and then others
[1:25:28] that had known me they put my name
[1:25:30] before the superintendent over there and
[1:25:32] they had given me words of commendation
[1:25:36] regarding that so as I called up you
[1:25:39] know the principal that was there at
[1:25:41] that school and I told him I said um I
[1:25:44] said Montez I said yeah I saw I said you
[1:25:47] know I said there's the principal
[1:25:49] opening I said it's coming here at my at
[1:25:51] my building and I said I know I said um
[1:25:54] I was wondering I said would you write
[1:25:59] me a letter of recommendation he said no
[1:26:02] I didn't say no harshly so I asked him
[1:26:10] again we talked for a little bit so I
[1:26:12] said Montez I said by the way I said um
[1:26:14] do you think you'd be able to write that
[1:26:16] for me said no he said Sam he said what
[1:26:19] I've told you is this he said you've
[1:26:22] only been teaching for two years he said
[1:26:24] you need to teach at least five years
[1:26:25] before you can ever be prepared to start
[1:26:28] learning what a principal does I want to
[1:26:33] be honest with you that's stung man
[1:26:36] that's stung but you know what he was
[1:26:41] right he was right because he even threw
[1:26:45] out the time after the five years was
[1:26:47] passed and I had the different ones
[1:26:49] assistant superintendents from places
[1:26:50] that I had went and did internships with
[1:26:52] them and they're out why where's your
[1:26:54] resume at where's this and where's that
[1:26:55] I said I just at that point time then I
[1:26:58] said I just don't feel led to do it I
[1:27:00] don't see how I could do it but you see
[1:27:02] where to come down to even in the last
[1:27:04] some of the closing years before I
[1:27:06] stepped away from teaching I wanted to
[1:27:08] do it but you know I wanted to do it I
[1:27:10] could care less if they did gave me any
[1:27:12] increase in pay whatsoever I looked at
[1:27:14] the effect of being able to influence a
[1:27:16] building what I've seen is is being able
[1:27:21] to affect that culture and be able to
[1:27:24] bring out of people what's there that's
[1:27:26] what mattered I didn't matter if they
[1:27:27] paid me anymore or not what I'm trying
[1:27:29] to tell you is is that what I thought I
[1:27:31] was ready for I wasn't
[1:27:35] God knows win this was even in your jobs
[1:27:38] you're not God knows you see your tests
[1:27:40] and trials are not some erroneous things
[1:27:43] out here they'll come through the
[1:27:44] appointments where God has you the doors
[1:27:49] that he opens for you those things you
[1:27:52] experience the testings and the trying's
[1:27:55] right there because it's not God doesn't
[1:27:58] separate or compartmentalize things but
[1:28:01] God prepares you and I for what he has
[1:28:04] for us sometimes do we experience
[1:28:08] disappointment like the thing that I
[1:28:10] just mentioned for maybe you put in for
[1:28:12] a different position or whatever more
[1:28:13] but you see God knows God knows you know
[1:28:18] don't don't look at it and I pray you
[1:28:20] know you understand what I'm saying
[1:28:21] don't take it that they passed up the
[1:28:23] best one in the crop buddy they don't
[1:28:26] know what they did when they bypass me
[1:28:28] but take it that you've committed
[1:28:30] everything to the Lord and if that was
[1:28:33] God's will there wasn't enough CEOs or
[1:28:36] whatever more to keep that from you but
[1:28:40] remember God does not bring you into
[1:28:42] position and then you fail but he molds
[1:28:45] you so you're ready for that
[1:28:47] Joseph though it was prophesied of his
[1:28:50] life he wasn't ready to step on the
[1:28:53] throne but the brem tells us in prisoner
[1:28:57] Jesus Christ
[1:28:58] a very small remark that's made in there
[1:29:01] he
[1:29:02] had pride in his life and it had to be
[1:29:05] dissolved
[1:29:06] what's pride self so there had to be the
[1:29:10] prison was necessary he was necessary
[1:29:16] greater humility that what God had
[1:29:20] already declared you see God's plan for
[1:29:23] Joseph's life
[1:29:24] it couldn't be altered but God knowing
[1:29:27] the plan he had for his life
[1:29:28] all of these appointments were suffering
[1:29:31] that was molding and shaping him for
[1:29:34] what God had for his life hi this is why
[1:29:40] Paul says here for which cause we faint
[1:29:43] not watch cause it goes on to say here
[1:29:46] but though our outward man perish it
[1:29:49] does doesn't it our outward man perish
[1:29:51] yet the inward man is renewed day by day
[1:29:55] so the outward man is perishing but yet
[1:29:59] Bini inner man is being renewed
[1:30:01] refreshed our youth is being renewed as
[1:30:04] an evil the inner man is the outward man
[1:30:10] is perishing for our light affliction
[1:30:16] which is but for a moment you catch this
[1:30:18] in the scripture it's a season for a
[1:30:21] while a moment worketh for us a far more
[1:30:27] exceeding and eternal weight of glory
[1:30:29] while we look not at the things which
[1:30:31] are seen but at the things which are not
[1:30:33] seen for the things which are seen are
[1:30:35] temporal but the things which are not
[1:30:37] seen are eternal now think of how this
[1:30:42] Paul would you know declare as God
[1:30:46] revealed himself to Paul there on the
[1:30:50] road to Damascus he told him in verse 16
[1:30:53] of Acts 9 I will show thee or show him
[1:30:56] how great things he must suffer for my
[1:31:00] namesake
[1:31:08] how many of you know there's things that
[1:31:10] we suffer sometimes it's not for his
[1:31:12] namesake
[1:31:16] it's very important to catch that and to
[1:31:20] discern that you know it's like somebody
[1:31:23] doesn't study for a test and they get an
[1:31:25] F
[1:31:25] oh I'm suffering you are suffering
[1:31:29] self-inflicted
[1:31:32] well I prayed but you didn't apply
[1:31:35] yourself you didn't study the Bible says
[1:31:39] study to show thyself approved come on
[1:31:44] now
[1:31:46] so there's times when they're suffering
[1:31:48] now that's suffering itself it's not in
[1:31:52] vain if we learn from it you might
[1:31:55] suffer and it stings awhile but you say
[1:31:58] Lord by your grace Lord I'm not gonna do
[1:32:01] that again I'm gonna be prepared you
[1:32:11] love him this reality look what this
[1:32:18] reality did for Paul Inlet Paul to
[1:32:21] suffer for others suffering on behalf of
[1:32:24] you realize that Paul suffered many
[1:32:26] things he didn't have to suffer he
[1:32:30] didn't have to suffer those beatings he
[1:32:33] didn't have to suffer and being let down
[1:32:35] in a basket he did not have to suffer
[1:32:40] that you realize Paul could have lived a
[1:32:42] godly Christian life which he did and he
[1:32:46] would not have had that suffering but
[1:32:48] his suffering the things that he
[1:32:50] suffered is because of what God had
[1:32:54] called him to carry the gospel and it
[1:32:57] was not for him it was for others Paul
[1:33:01] could have said you know what it's just
[1:33:02] easier for me I'll just stay home will
[1:33:08] facetime they didn't have him
[1:33:14] but you see it was something God put
[1:33:17] that burden in his heart not only had
[1:33:21] God revealed I want you to catch this as
[1:33:23] he's bringing this not only had God put
[1:33:26] a steadfastness within pulse with
[1:33:28] impulse heart that Paul could not be
[1:33:31] removed from the love of God Paul
[1:33:34] declares that doesn't he in Romans 8 who
[1:33:36] shall separate us right but it also he
[1:33:39] put a burden in Paul's heart for the
[1:33:43] Gentiles a burden doesn't mean you
[1:33:48] always want to do it but you do it for
[1:33:54] the love of God the love of his people
[1:33:58] that's a burden I believe with all my
[1:34:01] hearts that's what we really in our
[1:34:04] lives and I just hold it in for us as an
[1:34:07] assembly really need to pray and say God
[1:34:09] what do you want me to do it's easy for
[1:34:16] you know two or eight or just 10% of the
[1:34:19] people to carry it but God don't want
[1:34:20] 10% of the people to carry the church
[1:34:23] but it's a ask Lord what would you have
[1:34:26] me to do what's the burden Lord for my
[1:34:31] heart you see that's why many times I
[1:34:35] don't like asking for volunteers you
[1:34:39] know why that gets old you can volunteer
[1:34:43] out of feeling condemned I don't want
[1:34:45] you to volunteer how to feeling
[1:34:46] condemned it's got to be a burden on
[1:34:50] your heart because when it's a burden
[1:34:52] you do it
[1:34:53] even when you don't feel like doing it
[1:34:56] that's a burden it's easy to say I don't
[1:35:00] want to do that I want to do this this
[1:35:01] come but when it's a burden you do it
[1:35:03] and they don't have to worry and look
[1:35:05] around and say or am I so and so on and
[1:35:07] they're suppose we got this or we're
[1:35:09] there okay I know that's hard but if you
[1:35:14] say Amen it helps
[1:35:17] we want to have this is the Scriptures
[1:35:19] we're to be people of a burden when you
[1:35:22] have a burden sometimes you suffer
[1:35:24] through things you suffer through
[1:35:27] opinions you suffer through comments you
[1:35:29] sup you suffer for him you see so this
[1:35:35] purpose here my goodness
[1:35:41] without reading these scriptures let me
[1:35:43] just refer to him for time sake Peter
[1:35:46] picks it up here you can read it later
[1:35:47] in acts 2 when he is speaking on the day
[1:35:51] of Pentecost after the quickening powers
[1:35:54] come I want you to notice the contrast
[1:35:56] as he says it here in acts 2 it's
[1:36:00] contrast to what they thought walking
[1:36:04] with him when they didn't even
[1:36:05] understand remember the Bible says in
[1:36:07] mark 9 when they came down from the
[1:36:08] mountain they begin to question one
[1:36:10] another what's he mean rise again you
[1:36:13] know what it meant
[1:36:14] rise again and when they came on the
[1:36:16] road to Emmaus Luke 24 are you a
[1:36:19] stranger you don't know what's happening
[1:36:21] here these days how did the chief rulers
[1:36:23] in chief priests they took him and they
[1:36:25] crucified him and they did this but you
[1:36:28] see once the real of the revelation has
[1:36:31] struck Peters heart and they recognized
[1:36:34] this suffering was not in vain it was
[1:36:37] with a purpose then Peter could say in
[1:36:42] acts 2:23 him being delivered by the
[1:36:46] determinate counsel and foreknowledge of
[1:36:50] God ye have taken and my wicked hands
[1:36:53] have crucified the slain I think of how
[1:36:56] Jesus declares that they're standing in
[1:36:59] pilots Hall when he said unto them he
[1:37:02] said thou could have no power over me
[1:37:05] except it be given thee from above jesus
[1:37:12] knew the appointment he he recognized
[1:37:16] this suffering he even as he recognized
[1:37:19] it so clearly he said my cup he told she
[1:37:24] told Peter from Peter with the cut off
[1:37:26] the ear shall I not take
[1:37:29] my cup that which is intended for me did
[1:37:35] he pray if it's possible but you see
[1:37:38] what he's doing
[1:37:39] he's enduring the cross a man the
[1:37:45] Prophet tells us so clearly it was there
[1:37:47] at Gethsemane is where the real death
[1:37:50] took place that's where the real death
[1:37:54] happened there is when he died there too
[1:37:57] will so think of this a vow that Peter
[1:38:02] would bring this down we recognized this
[1:38:05] was not something that just happened by
[1:38:09] chance but trials rather ARF ordained
[1:38:12] and purpose by God for our perfection
[1:38:15] and his glory being revealed and
[1:38:18] reflected in us 2nd Corinthians 4 verse
[1:38:20] 8 says we are troubled on every side yet
[1:38:24] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[1:38:27] in despair you know what this is Paul is
[1:38:32] speaking of that dual person the inner
[1:38:35] man is renewed the outer man perishes
[1:38:38] the outer man's fading feels the
[1:38:41] pressure but the inner man has joy in
[1:38:44] the Lord
[1:38:49] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:38:53] but not destroyed always look at this
[1:38:57] always bearing about in the body the
[1:38:59] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:39:02] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:39:06] our body always not just sometimes
[1:39:10] always bearing it about that dying in
[1:39:13] our body who is it that gets in the way
[1:39:17] it's us
[1:39:19] there's a part of us that gets in the
[1:39:21] way you know brother Graham will always
[1:39:24] say let william branham step out of the
[1:39:26] way you hear brother Branham will open
[1:39:28] up in prayer I was loving an invisible
[1:39:30] Union he said now Lord let the man part
[1:39:32] step aside see it's recognizing this
[1:39:36] part we see that you see this is why
[1:39:39] would we look at one another we don't
[1:39:42] we're so sad for come on man you don't
[1:39:44] have no reason to be sad you might be
[1:39:46] sad as far as you're feeling the
[1:39:48] pressure in here but there's joy in your
[1:39:51] soul it's joy you can sense sometimes
[1:39:56] you sense discouragement fears can come
[1:39:58] and other but in your soul there's joy
[1:40:04] that joy is is that I don't know this is
[1:40:08] gonna come out I don't know it's gonna
[1:40:10] be unfolded here I don't know when the
[1:40:12] season is over all I know is is that he
[1:40:16] is holding my hand he's the one that's
[1:40:21] directing me through this tests and
[1:40:26] trials are not random
[1:40:30] they're not just oops you got mine how
[1:40:34] did God give you mine no they are
[1:40:36] specific that's why even in your
[1:40:42] appointments and my appointments of
[1:40:44] where we are even in this time God will
[1:40:47] take the circumstances and things that
[1:40:49] surround and they're used as tools to
[1:40:53] shape and mold and make you and I
[1:40:55] through testings through trials from
[1:40:58] your job from your schooling from all
[1:41:00] those things it is right around to mold
[1:41:03] and shape you and I all of that I trust
[1:41:10] that that's very clear I look at it from
[1:41:15] my life I'm not out in the workplace as
[1:41:18] some of you are but my testings my
[1:41:21] trying it comes with what God has called
[1:41:23] me to so it's not that I have been
[1:41:28] removed from testing and trials as a
[1:41:29] matter of fact I feel like it's been
[1:41:32] added
[1:41:36] sure but you see God uses the
[1:41:40] surroundings and you say well I can't
[1:41:43] wait to get out of this well I can't
[1:41:44] wait to get out that I can't know if God
[1:41:47] opened the door for you stand stand and
[1:41:53] let God mold and may
[1:41:55] you and shape what he has for your life
[1:41:59] he's not the author of confusion for
[1:42:02] which we live look at this for which we
[1:42:05] live are always delivered unto death for
[1:42:08] Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus
[1:42:10] might be made manifest in our mortal
[1:42:12] flesh I'm just going to read a few
[1:42:16] places here brilla Brown tells us here
[1:42:19] at the familiar reading place on the
[1:42:21] Cimmerian Church H where the Lord Jesus
[1:42:23] is looking there upon the Simonian age
[1:42:25] you know some Myrna means bitter they
[1:42:29] were suffering here the Lord Jesus as I
[1:42:33] know he said there he is walking in the
[1:42:35] midst of his people there he is the
[1:42:38] chief Shepherd of the flock but does he
[1:42:40] hold back the persecution does he stim
[1:42:43] the tribulation no he does not he simply
[1:42:46] says I know your tribulation I am not at
[1:42:51] all and mindful of your suffering what a
[1:42:55] stumbling block this is to so many
[1:42:57] people a stumbling block is what an
[1:43:00] offense they're offended by this
[1:43:04] by and by they're offended one why
[1:43:06] haven't you moved why haven't you done
[1:43:09] this I've been praying about this for a
[1:43:11] long time what a stumbling block this is
[1:43:16] too many people like Israel they wonder
[1:43:20] if God really loves them think of this
[1:43:23] when brother drowned I went through the
[1:43:25] greatest travel his life Satan could not
[1:43:28] tell him there wasn't a God what he
[1:43:32] trying to tell him is he don't love you
[1:43:36] listen what he said boom BAM said he
[1:43:39] came up next to me and he said look at
[1:43:42] all the people you prayed for and they
[1:43:45] got well and he goes through and gives
[1:43:48] him an account and then he lays out the
[1:43:50] suffering the sacrifice where he would
[1:43:52] come home get changed and go out on the
[1:43:55] field as far as working come back in and
[1:43:58] you know go and pray for the sick he
[1:44:00] lays out all the suffering that he has
[1:44:03] done and then he comes around and tells
[1:44:05] him he don't love you
[1:44:11] this was something the Prophet is
[1:44:15] speaking to you and I not out of
[1:44:17] knowledge but we have read it from the
[1:44:22] scriptures this morning is not knowledge
[1:44:25] it's not theology this is life
[1:44:30] experience as a believer this is an
[1:44:36] experience what the Prophet is laying
[1:44:38] out right here is an experience from his
[1:44:41] own life where Satan himself has come to
[1:44:44] accuse him and remember all of those two
[1:44:48] outer realms was in agreement with what
[1:44:52] Satan was saying well that ain't around
[1:44:55] that faith on the inside it held it
[1:44:59] couldn't be moved what is that that's
[1:45:01] the real love of God it rose up in the
[1:45:06] midst of that time he said when I was
[1:45:08] about ready to say if that's how he's
[1:45:10] going to be but he said oh think if that
[1:45:15] typos had been there think of that new
[1:45:18] birth hadn't been there it holds you in
[1:45:21] the Missis I did the Prophet understand
[1:45:24] that in that time he did not understand
[1:45:27] it he did not understand you see
[1:45:36] sometimes it's one thing God will tell
[1:45:39] you and say it's because you failed to
[1:45:41] go out when I called you that's one
[1:45:43] thing God will tell you but for us to
[1:45:46] really come to a place to let everything
[1:45:49] go and allow him to mend our lives you
[1:45:55] think he wasn't hurtin he was even after
[1:45:58] that was spoken remember he wanted to
[1:46:01] take his life but it couldn't end it
[1:46:06] there was a purpose to be fulfilled and
[1:46:11] that experience would be an experience
[1:46:16] that he would relate to you and I and
[1:46:17] says don't ever
[1:46:20] fail to do what God has called you to do
[1:46:23] he would even relate to you or not
[1:46:26] listen to me now sometimes there's
[1:46:28] things that we even suffer after that
[1:46:34] God has made known to us our
[1:46:37] disobedience and yet we still suffer let
[1:46:42] me give you an example standing in
[1:46:45] Christ the mystery of God revealed the
[1:46:49] Prophet begins to speak about how he's
[1:46:51] feeling physically in his body what did
[1:46:54] he say he said you know he always makes
[1:46:59] it hard on me when I come back here and
[1:47:04] he said he did does that because I
[1:47:07] failed to go out in the first place I
[1:47:10] thought he got over it he did he learned
[1:47:13] but sometimes that suffering is needful
[1:47:17] to say remember remember remember Lord I
[1:47:24] want all that gone but remember remember
[1:47:29] even meet he's sitting there that day
[1:47:30] when they wanted to reopen the tax case
[1:47:32] this same message and a flash across the
[1:47:35] wall come back to Arizona and she had
[1:47:37] said to him bill I know God told you to
[1:47:40] go out there but he did he tell you to
[1:47:41] come back right see he's suffering he
[1:47:48] even suffered for decisions when he went
[1:47:50] ahead and went even though he told the
[1:47:52] Brethren in Africa on that trip were not
[1:47:53] to go here were to stay here you note
[1:47:57] that that's an example for you and I to
[1:48:00] recognize let every day be unfolded by
[1:48:02] God no go try to plan everything out
[1:48:06] let it be unfolded by God let God order
[1:48:10] our lives let me come down here what a
[1:48:15] stumbling block this is to so many
[1:48:16] people like Israel they wonder if God
[1:48:19] really loves them how can God be just
[1:48:21] and loving if he stands by and watches
[1:48:23] his people suffer that is what they
[1:48:26] asked in Malachi 1 verse 3 1 1 through 3
[1:48:29] the burden of the word of the Lord to
[1:48:31] Israel by Malachi I
[1:48:32] loved you sayeth the Lord yet ye say
[1:48:34] wherein has - loved us what's not Esau
[1:48:38] Jacob's brother saith the Lord yet I
[1:48:41] love Jacob and I hated Esau and laid his
[1:48:44] mountains and his heritage weighs for
[1:48:46] the Dragons of the wilderness he says
[1:48:49] see they could not figure out God's love
[1:48:55] they couldn't figure it out so because
[1:48:59] they couldn't figure it out it causes
[1:49:01] him to stumble they thought that love
[1:49:05] meant no suffering
[1:49:08] that's this age you realize that it's
[1:49:14] this age love meant no suffering they
[1:49:18] thought love meant no suffering they
[1:49:20] thought that love meant a baby with
[1:49:23] parental care but God said that his love
[1:49:26] was elective love the proof of his love
[1:49:29] is election that no matter what happened
[1:49:34] come that's a big statement no matter
[1:49:36] what happened his love was proven truly
[1:49:41] by the fact they were chosen under
[1:49:44] salvation because God had chosen you to
[1:49:46] salvation through sanctification of the
[1:49:49] Spirit and belief of the truth he may
[1:49:51] commit you to death as he did Paul he
[1:49:54] may commit you to suffering as he did
[1:49:56] Joe that is his prerogative he is
[1:50:00] sovereign but it is all with a purpose
[1:50:03] if he did not have a purpose then he
[1:50:06] would be the author of frustration and
[1:50:08] not of peace he's the author of peace
[1:50:16] the Bible clearly declares he's not the
[1:50:19] author of confusion God's got a purpose
[1:50:24] the purpose of his suffering the purpose
[1:50:28] of our suffering and yet the love itself
[1:50:32] love it has nothing to do we're in
[1:50:36] hostile loved us his love is that of
[1:50:39] election
[1:50:41] that he chose us and he brought us to
[1:50:46] himself that in itself is proof enough
[1:50:51] of his love that is the love of God
[1:50:54] manifested to you and I and to think of
[1:50:59] this how that Paul would speak and
[1:51:02] express this than I may know him in the
[1:51:05] power of his resurrection and the
[1:51:09] Fellowship of his suffering the stand
[1:51:22] you know frustration is a it's a it's a
[1:51:27] bad thing it's a result of a series of
[1:51:33] unexpected events that provide no work
[1:51:37] toward a common goal
[1:51:38] in other words seems without purpose
[1:51:43] that's how the disciples looked at what
[1:51:47] had taken place they didn't understand
[1:51:50] but after Pentecost it's different
[1:51:54] they understood suffering is for a
[1:51:58] purpose it's for a purpose
[1:52:04] peace peace is the result the series of
[1:52:11] unexpected events things we haven't
[1:52:14] expected that provide work toward a
[1:52:18] common goal in other words it's with a
[1:52:20] purpose and we can look at that and say
[1:52:22] I don't know what is going to come from
[1:52:28] this but I know at the end I will be
[1:52:33] stronger I will be stronger if you focus
[1:52:39] where we focus on the test on the trial
[1:52:43] on the suffering to be very discouraging
[1:52:49] but if you focus to him who's the author
[1:52:53] of peace and committing everything into
[1:52:57] his hands I mean committing it not
[1:53:01] trying to mitigate it and do this and
[1:53:03] arrange this but commitment say lord
[1:53:06] help me to be patient and to gather out
[1:53:12] of this suffering what's needed for your
[1:53:16] glory I tell you God knows what he's
[1:53:24] doing god knows what he's doing I you
[1:53:28] know I've stood here and I've testified
[1:53:29] to you many times many times there even
[1:53:32] when I was teaching school you know what
[1:53:33] yes I was teaching
[1:53:36] but there was so many things that I
[1:53:38] needed to learn I didn't need to learn
[1:53:40] how to multiply and divide in fractions
[1:53:42] that's not what I needed to learn but
[1:53:44] there were things that God allowed from
[1:53:47] co-workers and from kids that certain
[1:53:57] ways that I would handle certain things
[1:53:58] God was there okay now how you gonna
[1:54:00] handle it you bring someone in there on
[1:54:06] a behavior plan severe behavior handicap
[1:54:10] known to throw chairs I'll just tell him
[1:54:15] sit down and you can't touch
[1:54:28] you have to make in the document
[1:54:30] accommodations god knows what he's doing
[1:54:36] things within those times like that God
[1:54:40] showed me what sweetness will do to
[1:54:46] where it'll take a heart that really is
[1:54:49] raging and that heart can come right
[1:54:53] there and you gain favor was that
[1:54:57] necessary
[1:54:57] it was for me it was for me I needed
[1:55:00] that as I need all of his continual
[1:55:04] mouldings from my life
[1:55:07] you needed that when you have people
[1:55:09] teachers and different ones you know
[1:55:12] challenged you and want to you know the
[1:55:14] poked at you for certain things I'm
[1:55:19] saying this because the things I trust
[1:55:22] that we gather from here sometimes we
[1:55:26] can be so occupied with running from
[1:55:30] what God is using two motifs now you
[1:55:36] hear me we can run from it you know God
[1:55:40] will mold us even with the people that
[1:55:42] surround us you will he molds us
[1:55:49] he'll shape us the molding and the
[1:55:51] shaping is about us dying that he might
[1:55:56] live God knows what he's doing if we can
[1:56:03] just rest within that part of it rest in
[1:56:06] him then we can have victory over
[1:56:09] discouragement we can have victory you
[1:56:15] believe that
[1:56:20] have joy in the midst of the trial and
[1:56:24] the joy the midst of the suffering I say
[1:56:27] like this Lord help me and I can learn
[1:56:32] even of things that have been
[1:56:35] self-inflicted
[1:56:36] let me learn because you said you'd make
[1:56:40] all things work together for the good
[1:56:41] you didn't say all things were good
[1:56:43] he'll make all things work together for
[1:56:46] my good according to those who are
[1:56:49] called according to his purpose we're
[1:56:51] just passing through here this time but
[1:56:56] God is in control it's with a purpose
[1:57:02] let's pray Lord Jesus Lord Jesus you are
[1:57:11] our life Lord
[1:57:17] Lord Jesus as we Lord examine our lives
[1:57:23] by the word
[1:57:25] the lordís with such clarity the Lord we
[1:57:30] can see suffering is for purpose we
[1:57:35] don't always see it or do we don't when
[1:57:37] we're in the midst of it we don't but
[1:57:40] the thing Lord that I know from my heart
[1:57:43] and perhaps it's been the same thing
[1:57:44] that struck other's hearts that I
[1:57:46] realized that the things Lord that even
[1:57:49] that I've been through went through
[1:57:52] where you've spoke to my heart has not
[1:57:55] just been for me it's been Lord at
[1:57:58] different times where I'm able to sit
[1:58:00] down and I'm able to help others not me
[1:58:04] but being able to be yielded that you
[1:58:07] can come right through that gift that
[1:58:09] you're placed in my life and Lord where
[1:58:11] it reaches out to that person or
[1:58:15] sometimes not only here but times Lord
[1:58:18] when I've sat down Lord and retreats and
[1:58:20] camps Lord with young people been able
[1:58:22] just to set their one on one Lord with
[1:58:24] things that they're facing they're
[1:58:26] dealing with Lord it's never it's always
[1:58:30] the Lord God been so tremendous how that
[1:58:33] there's things that you'll bring right
[1:58:35] along these things the Lord many times
[1:58:37] that I've went through and all my and
[1:58:42] just see how that Lord their accountants
[1:58:43] begins to change when there's things the
[1:58:46] Lord God began to be spoken that father
[1:58:48] begin to make known things that's been
[1:58:51] spoken in their mind
[1:58:53] oh god you are so merciful Lord this is
[1:59:00] not about us
[1:59:02] it's not just for us but I asked Lord
[1:59:06] God that you would help us that like
[1:59:08] Peter Peter and the rest of the
[1:59:10] disciples then seen the value of
[1:59:16] suffering they seemed that it was not
[1:59:20] something that necessarily would bring
[1:59:24] rejoicing yet they would have joy in you
[1:59:30] they would have joy in you Lord they
[1:59:36] recognize that nothing was by chance Oh
[1:59:41] father help us Lord
[1:59:45] help us Lord but knowing that God you
[1:59:51] you and your infinite wisdom you permit
[1:59:55] these things to come around
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:01] what sometimes maybe here I'm speaking
[2:00:05] Lord two hearts who have that
[2:00:08] remembrance before them Lord and there
[2:00:11] wasn't something that Lord that brother
[2:00:13] branham when he would come back into
[2:00:14] town that he was grudging against but it
[2:00:17] was just a reminder and you allowed that
[2:00:19] to remain father I pray that Lord that
[2:00:27] you would help us help each and every
[2:00:28] one father that's here under the sound
[2:00:31] of my voice or God may there's one Lord
[2:00:36] that doesn't know you may they know you
[2:00:39] may they come to surrender may they come
[2:00:44] Lord to suffer to let go of their life
[2:00:46] and realize the Lord Jesus that there is
[2:00:50] a life that Lord has been given a life
[2:00:56] that Lord can take their life that is
[2:01:01] surrendered and through that life the
[2:01:04] will of God will be unfolded
[2:01:09] brannad Lord Jesus may our lives be a
[2:01:12] clearer a pure and a true reflection of
[2:01:16] your glory mold us and make us Lord
[2:01:19] Jesus that we might not in everything
[2:01:23] bring glory to you I pray that you'll
[2:01:27] touch those Lord that are sick in their
[2:01:29] body
[2:01:30] Lord God may you just move Lord for
[2:01:34] these needs some that are here some that
[2:01:36] are not with us this morning Lord
