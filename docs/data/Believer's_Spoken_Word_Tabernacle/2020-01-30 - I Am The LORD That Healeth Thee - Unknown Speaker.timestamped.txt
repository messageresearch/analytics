[29:34] love you and faith in your father Jesus
[29:37] [Music]
[29:41] praise the name of the Lord well you're
[29:44] glad to be here tonight
[29:45] amen
[29:48] your body may not feel like it but your
[29:51] soul it's so glad to be here
[29:53] so let's turn here in the scriptures we
[29:57] just don't want to go just to two verses
[29:59] where we've been drawing from here in
[30:01] Exodus 15 and I want to just read these
[30:06] two verses of Scripture tonight verses
[30:08] 25 and verses 26 and
[30:15] verse 25 it says and he cried unto the
[30:21] Lord and the Lord showed him a tree
[30:24] which when he had cast into the waters
[30:28] the waters were made sweet very made for
[30:33] them a statute and an ordinance and
[30:36] there he proved them so this was not a
[30:39] show it was God showing them letting
[30:42] them know a statue an and ordinance it
[30:45] was it was a word and I'm so glad that
[30:48] God gives us this by experience this is
[30:52] an experience so here in verse 26 what
[30:55] we're going to read in verse 26 is
[30:57] actually the casting of the tree into
[31:00] the waters when this comes about in
[31:03] their life and he said if thou wilt
[31:06] diligently hearken to the voice of the
[31:10] LORD thy God and will do that which is
[31:13] right in his sight and will give ear to
[31:17] His commandments and keep all his
[31:20] statutes I will put none of these
[31:23] diseases upon thee which have which I
[31:25] have brought upon the Egyptians for I am
[31:29] the lord that he Levine that's what I
[31:33] really want to emphasize on tonight that
[31:35] last part for I am
[31:38] the Lord that healeth thee
[31:41] amen may God bless you bless the word of
[31:44] being seated tonight
[31:45] truly as we look there in the scripture
[31:48] we we have the promise that God has has
[31:52] given to us we realized that as the Lord
[31:54] was speaking to the children of Israel
[31:57] in that time in verse 26 he he makes
[32:01] known to them even a covenant of his
[32:03] word that if they will give diligently
[32:06] and hearken diligently to the word and
[32:08] will do what is right in his sight and
[32:10] give ear to his Commandments in other
[32:13] words to be fully taken with him with a
[32:15] desire to please him that truly God
[32:19] himself has made this this this
[32:22] declaration that I will put none of the
[32:25] diseases upon thee which I have brought
[32:27] upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord
[32:29] that he loved thee now undoubtedly they
[32:32] you know this situation and the
[32:34] experience that they had witnessed here
[32:36] within the the bitter waters God would
[32:40] take this experience and let it be an
[32:43] experience to them that they would give
[32:45] witness that when there would be bitter
[32:47] situations that they would come into
[32:50] there would be times that their bodies
[32:52] they would suffer they would be
[32:54] afflicted God never said you'll never be
[32:57] sick you'll never be afflicted you'll
[32:59] never go through those things we realize
[33:01] that back in Eden as we keep moving back
[33:04] to that place that it was there they
[33:07] walked without any sickness whatsoever
[33:10] Adam or Eve they never had experienced
[33:13] any cold they never experienced a
[33:16] headache there was never any toothache
[33:18] there was no sickness whatsoever but we
[33:21] realized that what allowed sickness to
[33:24] enter sickness itself was only an
[33:26] attribute or an attribute of sin of
[33:29] unbelief and how that when they fell
[33:32] from the word then we find aware that
[33:35] that of death sets in and we know that
[33:37] sickness all of that is associated with
[33:40] death and with sin and as we were just
[33:43] looking at this last week and looking at
[33:46] how that even in our lives in our bodies
[33:49] even for as a child of when our soul has
[33:53] been completely redeemed it has been we
[33:56] have we have come under that reality by
[33:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet there
[34:02] are two parts of our life that has not
[34:04] been redeemed yet our body is still in a
[34:08] state that our body has not been
[34:10] redeemed now we still we steal from
[34:13] within our lives we have to battle
[34:16] within our lives to keep our spirit
[34:18] clean to actually keep out things that
[34:21] are that are unwarranted and how the
[34:23] enemy would want to try to attack in
[34:25] through those gates of our spirit but
[34:27] things be to God for the seal of the
[34:29] Holy Ghost on our soul we thank God for
[34:32] that it becomes more dear and more
[34:33] precious to us as the days go on and we
[34:37] realize that that that in itself we have
[34:39] within it the same Living God that is
[34:42] dwelling within our lives and is there
[34:44] to guide and direct us I want you to
[34:46] look at these words I I'm not going to
[34:48] dwell so much on them tonight but it's
[34:50] very much similar to that of verse 26 in
[34:53] proverbs chapter 4 verse 20 he said my
[34:57] son attend to my words incline thine ear
[35:01] unto my sayings let them not depart from
[35:07] thine eyes keep them in the midst of
[35:10] thine heart for they are life unto those
[35:15] that find them and health to all their
[35:19] flesh
[35:20] this is the greatest health plan there
[35:23] is
[35:25] it's health to all our flesh what is the
[35:28] attending to the Word of God giving
[35:31] ourselves to the Word of God we're not
[35:32] serving God there's not one of us here
[35:34] tonight I believe as a as a child of God
[35:37] we are not serving God because of what
[35:39] we can get out of him but this happens
[35:41] to be one of the benefits when we are
[35:43] walking in the presence of God serving
[35:46] the Lord we have the promise of this
[35:47] word and in this word there is no well
[35:50] maybe he will heal me well if it's the
[35:52] Lord's will I think of how dr. Bosworth
[35:55] would say it like this he said those are
[35:57] faith killing words if it be thy will to
[36:01] heal me he said then we don't say those
[36:03] words like that you know many times when
[36:05] you read that you realize why even
[36:07] brother Brandon brother bras words were
[36:09] so close when you read many of the words
[36:10] that brother Bosworth you know they were
[36:12] sitting right there right next to one
[36:14] another but I'll and those are things
[36:16] that just struck me even you know when
[36:18] we approach the word of God how that we
[36:21] realize we are not to approach it in a
[36:23] maybe or if it be thy will but we
[36:26] realize that when we are praying for
[36:28] healing we are always in the will of God
[36:31] it is in God's hands entirely
[36:38] amen and this is the promise that we
[36:42] have is that then we are not serving God
[36:44] because in our life well you know in my
[36:48] life I need to you know to have a better
[36:50] life or I'm sick and I need to be well
[36:53] that's not why we're serving God this
[36:56] just happens to be the benefits of a
[36:59] heart Venna that gives complete place to
[37:03] the Word of God I believe that with all
[37:06] my heart I'm oh how many are witness to
[37:08] that tonight they are life under those
[37:10] that find them and health to all their
[37:14] flesh now look here in in in the message
[37:18] and condemnation by representation
[37:20] brother Brandon would put it like this
[37:22] he says our Heavenly Father we bring to
[37:26] you this great line of sick people God
[37:29] just think many of these in here I
[37:31] trusted every one of them are your
[37:33] children and born of the Spirit washed
[37:36] in the blood filled with the Holy Ghost
[37:38] and and ready for the coming and Satan
[37:41] can't get them that way to make them sin
[37:45] he can't get them to make them doubt
[37:48] your word is wrong they go ahead and
[37:50] follow it just as to the letter but then
[37:53] he tries to come along and afflict their
[37:55] body because he knows that their bodies
[37:58] still sin but their soul is saved their
[38:03] body's got to go back to the dust of the
[38:05] earth but their soul goes to God so he
[38:08] tries to afflict that part what he can
[38:15] yeah when the saw has been sealed Satan
[38:18] cannot afflict the soul
[38:20] Satan could come and he can try to
[38:23] afflict the body he can even come and
[38:25] try to afflict the mind by injecting of
[38:28] thoughts but he cannot afflict that soul
[38:30] that soul has been healed there has come
[38:34] a and not just a permanent but an
[38:37] eternal healing there is no sickness no
[38:41] more in the soul with the actual curse
[38:44] of the snakebite has been lifted from
[38:47] off of our life so we are living in that
[38:50] of under the shed blood of the Lamb and
[38:53] yet within our bodies we can still
[38:57] experience sickness and we have to war
[39:00] and we battle but how great it is to be
[39:03] in this battle how wonderful it is now
[39:06] notice I'm so glad that you included
[39:10] salvation for that body - aren't you
[39:13] glad
[39:14] because you realize that it just don't
[39:17] it's not just something that just comes
[39:19] just even as just to be an earnest of
[39:23] the resurrection which brother brand
[39:24] goes on to say this is the earnest of
[39:26] the resurrection the healing of our
[39:28] bodies we realized that here there is an
[39:32] end Paul would say it like this in the
[39:34] book of Thessalonians there is the end
[39:37] of our salvation now if there was the
[39:39] beginning of our salvation with the
[39:42] deliverance and the healing of our soul
[39:45] but there must come that of a body that
[39:49] matches our soul and to think that the
[39:52] God is not making you know elects that
[39:55] of a wedding guest you know the
[39:57] scripture talks about all who do not
[39:59] have the wedding garment on you realize
[40:01] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon
[40:04] your soul is a clear it's the token it's
[40:07] a clear sign you have God a garment
[40:11] there on the other side you've got a
[40:13] body like Peter said that is reserved
[40:17] it's undefiled it's unspotted there is
[40:20] no weaknesses within it it is there in
[40:23] the presence of God that feel for me
[40:25] body
[40:28] hallelujah and then through all of this
[40:30] how that there will be and comfort that
[40:34] of the glorified body where you and I
[40:37] will live eternally and that's where
[40:39] brother Branham would say in the message
[40:41] future home he said what is he says what
[40:44] is the future hold its eternal life in a
[40:47] human body
[40:49] hallelujah glory we were not we were not
[40:53] made to live out there remember this is
[40:56] our home
[40:59] now notice when Jesus came here he sent
[41:03] forth the disciples and he told them I
[41:06] want you to go preach saying in matthew
[41:08] 10:7 go preach saying that the kingdom
[41:10] of heaven is at hand now we know that
[41:13] the kingdom of heaven is that which is
[41:16] to set down here upon this earth but as
[41:19] yet the kingdom of heaven has not set up
[41:21] on this earth but there has been an
[41:23] issuing of the kingdom of God into the
[41:26] heart of the believer by the Holy Ghost
[41:30] and so Jesus noticed he is telling them
[41:32] announce and I want you to declare the
[41:35] kingdom of heaven is at hand I wish I
[41:39] could just preach on that a little bit
[41:40] but to think of it here an announcement
[41:43] and here we are two thousand years even
[41:46] so later but that announcement it still
[41:49] is a declaration it was announcing to
[41:52] Satan that what was done there in the
[41:56] disobedience of one here stands one to
[41:59] be able to bring back and restore all
[42:02] that was lost in the fall so I'm going
[42:05] to announce it and not only did he
[42:08] announce and he said I am going to put
[42:10] my life into my children and win since
[42:14] now you have permitted them they will
[42:17] permit you
[42:21] hallelujah I
[42:23] [Applause]
[42:26] feel like preaching but I
[42:30] the kingdom of heaven is at hand
[42:34] notice what he said heal the sick
[42:37] cleanse the lepers raise the dead cast
[42:41] out Devils freely you have received
[42:43] freely guilt and think about this they
[42:46] hadn't even received the the do Thomas
[42:49] power of God the Holy Ghost but they had
[42:52] received authority from Almighty God
[42:56] from the Lord Jesus I want you to put
[42:58] this together now you and I have
[43:00] received the Holy Spirit and think of
[43:03] the word that we have received what God
[43:06] has personally given us because the Holy
[43:08] Ghost is the Word of God made flesh in
[43:12] you
[43:13] hallelujah you and I have been
[43:16] authorized by the king himself heal the
[43:20] sick cleanse the lepers raise the dead
[43:24] cast out devils and yet in our strength
[43:28] we can't do it but there is one behind
[43:31] us I am the Lord that healeth thee I
[43:36] am not once now will be I am the Lord
[43:41] that he loved thee
[43:42] hurled sums 9110 there shall no evil
[43:47] befall thee neither shall any plague
[43:50] come nigh thy dwelling I think one time
[43:53] when my daddy was there on
[43:55] we were living out there you know right
[43:59] out of Salina and in him close to
[44:01] Rockford and you know down on that side
[44:03] of the state I guess we can claim it as
[44:06] Ohio but it's just to me as flat as a
[44:08] pancake and you can you know see things
[44:10] for well we'll just be anyhow what was
[44:13] happening is is that he could see in
[44:15] round that Fort Wayne area there is
[44:17] always tornadoes around and that's all I
[44:19] remember growing up it was nothing but
[44:21] tornadoes coming around that Fort Wayne
[44:23] area and I remember that one time my
[44:26] daddy when he came out there and and
[44:28] here came a tornado and it was coming
[44:30] and he could see it he said Lord you
[44:32] said in your word that not a plague
[44:35] shall come nigh thy dwelling he said so
[44:38] storm you gotta turn you can't come this
[44:41] way
[44:42] [Laughter]
[44:44] the storm turned
[44:48] [Applause]
[44:51] hallelujah
[44:53] now notice this neither shall any plague
[44:56] come nigh thy dwelling you know brother
[44:58] Branham talks about this in the earlier
[45:00] years of germ warfare coming up on this
[45:03] earth
[45:05] are you with me but this is the promise
[45:08] you and I have neither shall any plague
[45:11] come nigh thy dwelling
[45:14] that'll mean that we act ignorant and
[45:16] we're smart about it but we've got a
[45:18] promise and you say why is that promise
[45:21] so certain because all of these things
[45:23] that are all around us it's enough to
[45:26] where you could walk paralyzed in fear
[45:28] but let me tell you you don't have to
[45:31] walk in fear I am the lord that he loved
[45:34] thee I will not let a plant from not-bad
[45:39] dwelling I don't care what they create
[45:42] in a laboratory I will not let a plague
[45:44] come nigh thy dwelling
[45:46] [Music]
[45:54] probably some of you have read a little
[45:56] bit about I hope I get it pronounced
[45:57] right the coronavirus or whatever more I
[46:00] looked a little bit in it and that was
[46:01] it one thing I come back to though what
[46:04] I look at is I read a little bit in it
[46:05] but the first thing even before all that
[46:08] the first thing i suppo i thought of is
[46:09] the prophet of god has already spoken
[46:12] concerning Jorma germ warfare
[46:14] but you know there's a greater germ
[46:17] warfare that's going on
[46:19] it's a germ warfare of sin
[46:22] but God in this hour he's sent an
[46:25] inoculation
[46:26] it's not a different serum it packs
[46:30] within it the same authority that was
[46:33] given there on the day of Pentecost
[46:37] the enemy can try to engineer this and
[46:40] engineer this but brother the blood has
[46:43] never lost his power never lost his
[46:46] power Amen that's what this message
[46:49] comes to do is to reveal the power and
[46:52] the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:55] aren't you glad for that now I want you
[46:58] to look at this here for a moment in
[47:00] Psalms 105 37 it said he brought them
[47:04] forth also with silver and gold and
[47:08] there was not one feeble person
[47:12] among their tribes I
[47:16] read that promise was looking at this
[47:19] for some time and I couldn't help but
[47:21] read that and I thought of how the
[47:23] scripture says they which are alive and
[47:26] remain
[47:30] did you think of it in this manner how
[47:34] that mini brother brand would say like
[47:36] this he said for somebody with cancer he
[47:37] said how he said that he said it can
[47:40] come down to the very last moments he
[47:41] said and then once he said God will step
[47:43] on the scene and reverse that death has
[47:46] tried to come but then the earnest of
[47:49] the resurrection comes and reverses that
[47:52] you see friends the disease and
[47:54] everything it has its boundaries it can
[47:57] only go so far and remember before the
[48:00] Satan can ever even touch your body
[48:03] although my body and your body is still
[48:05] sin he can't touch it till he gets
[48:07] permission
[48:09] are you with me you can't touch it
[48:11] remember if we see that in Joel chapter
[48:14] one but to think of this in that manner
[48:17] I wonder how many will be standing here
[48:19] and and we know that when that sweep
[48:22] comes over there Oh Mound that
[48:24] resurrection morning to think of how
[48:27] that the dead in Christ shall rise first
[48:29] and when we begin to see them they will
[48:32] come to us oh brother we will see them
[48:35] none of the rest of the world will see
[48:37] them but we will see them after you
[48:39] talking about a spark and a stimulation
[48:42] of our faith
[48:45] there will be a spark and a stimulation
[48:47] of our faith because what we will see is
[48:51] the word standing before us and we know
[48:54] that we are a part of that word and we
[48:57] will be changed in a moment and a
[49:00] twinkling of an eye
[49:02] crooked bats come up straight I
[49:07] could go on and on with that one right
[49:10] there but there has been and there will
[49:13] be testimonies that will spend
[49:16] triumphant by the faith of God that will
[49:18] give that final witness that the hold of
[49:21] death has been lost I want you think
[49:23] about not a feeble one among
[49:26] here come here here come a message
[49:28] listen to me now this is simple I know
[49:30] but here come a message and in that
[49:33] message it came and then let him know
[49:35] that that I have heard your cries and
[49:39] that message begin to unfold God sending
[49:43] his messenger identified by the pillar
[49:45] fire and the word and how that he went
[49:48] here they come out of Egypt think about
[49:51] it they came out of Egypt they did not
[49:53] come out carrying food we know they had
[49:56] unleavened bread but yet they did not
[49:58] come out with the food supply one food
[50:00] trucks following him down the road but
[50:03] they came out and you see even in that
[50:05] right there God was testifying that I've
[50:08] got all of this I am your provider what
[50:12] do what was God saying within all of
[50:14] that data pertains to you and I right
[50:17] now you don't need to weigh I am your
[50:22] everything I
[50:24] am your provider I have already thought
[50:28] of everything that will be needed all
[50:31] along the way
[50:33] in that wonderful he already thought of
[50:37] it and so we find that even when we look
[50:39] at Moses you know
[50:41] how brother Brandon would call it you
[50:43] know doctor Moses and say Moses had a
[50:46] medicine chest and all he said if we
[50:48] could just look in that medicine chest
[50:50] now I want some big cabinet you know
[50:52] that had something on the wall but it
[50:54] was it was something where he there was
[50:57] a promise that was made and that was
[50:59] given in that medicine chest you see
[51:01] there were things that you know perhaps
[51:03] that maybe you didn't think of but to
[51:06] think of how that there would be hurts
[51:08] and aches and cancers and blindness and
[51:11] dumb deafness had done this that would
[51:14] would arise on their way to the promised
[51:18] land
[51:19] but God said I've got everything covered
[51:22] aren't you glad for that Bill Graham
[51:25] said oh he said there would be one to
[51:27] say Moses my father he's been over here
[51:30] he broke his leg today he fell and he
[51:33] broke his leg well what do you got for
[51:35] him he said well let me just look and
[51:36] see yeah thou will obey my voice and do
[51:40] all our command output none of these
[51:42] diseases upon you has the Egyptians for
[51:44] I am the lord that heal him that healeth
[51:47] thee telling that
[51:49] glory oh my here he is he's seriously
[51:53] sick my baby has got colic or pneumonia
[51:57] and how that we find that that how that
[52:00] God moved down and he healed all the
[52:03] diseases and God kept them perfectly all
[52:06] the way through there were babies that
[52:09] were born along the journey you know
[52:12] sometimes we we skip over the simple
[52:15] things that are laying here in the
[52:16] scripture that pertained to us in our
[52:19] journey is that right because the things
[52:22] of it is is that how we enjoy if friends
[52:24] I believe with all my heart we enjoy the
[52:26] great revelation but if that really
[52:28] doesn't ever come down to where it puts
[52:31] on shoe leather and I'll say it like
[52:32] this you can put it in your lunch box
[52:34] then it's not really fully been revealed
[52:37] but when it's revealed its power is
[52:40] revealed and it comes down into a simple
[52:44] everyday walk with God
[52:48] sometimes we good that's why I think God
[52:51] we need to be reminded of this brother
[52:53] and said there were many babies that
[52:54] were born there were mothers that were
[52:57] in distress
[52:58] when babies were being born Moses this
[53:01] you know crying out this mother she's in
[53:03] distress we're gonna lose her what
[53:06] should we do let me look in the band I
[53:08] am the Lord that healeth thee
[53:12] understand you that sounds like the same
[53:15] prescription over and over
[53:19] absolutely is the same prescription
[53:23] tonight
[53:25] well there were those who fell and broke
[53:28] their leg there were those brother brems
[53:30] said that got pneumonia and he said even
[53:33] when they would come there and they had
[53:35] a sick baby and Moses would tell them
[53:37] and the Lord that healeth all thee he
[53:40] they said here's their response he said
[53:42] thank you doctor Moses will go use it
[53:44] Lord you said you was the Lord that God
[53:47] that healeth the baby we believe notice
[53:50] the promise was given and
[53:53] they had to take that promise and say
[53:56] thank you milord they began to pray and
[53:59] they began to move with that word that
[54:02] was given them for their situation for
[54:05] their need you and I've been given a
[54:07] word
[54:09] the next morning the baby was playing
[54:12] that's it I'm the Lord that healeth thee
[54:14] he now he says there wasn't one feeble
[54:16] crippled or blind that come out of the
[54:18] wilderness with them and you know
[54:20] brother bran would say it like this he
[54:22] said you give me a doctor
[54:24] that had that kind of a reputation
[54:29] give me a doctor you know everybody when
[54:31] they're getting ready they want an you
[54:33] know a new doctor or they want a surgeon
[54:35] and nothing wrong with that you know you
[54:37] don't want somebody say well you're not
[54:38] done my best and they they have killed
[54:40] everybody they operated on I'm doing my
[54:42] best using the way you know what you do
[54:44] your best when maybe we just need to let
[54:46] you practice on dummies you know or
[54:48] something you know but the reality is
[54:50] you want to check you want to make sure
[54:51] this person knows what they're doing let
[54:55] me tell you something he wasn't Moses
[54:57] that established a reputation it was God
[55:00] unfolding his reputation among his
[55:03] children in that hour and brother even
[55:06] in this hour we're living way on the
[55:09] other side of this but God barreled a
[55:12] little body and God declared in this
[55:15] hour to you and I and they ain't gone
[55:17] away from it that is reputation is still
[55:20] the same I'm the Lord that healeth all
[55:23] thy diseases
[55:26] same prescription I
[55:31] don't have to go to the laboratory
[55:33] what are we gonna do this virus is
[55:36] coming out oh my goodness what are we
[55:38] gonna do quickly somebody and it's just
[55:41] like I was you know here before church a
[55:43] few hours and everybody's so excited
[55:45] that the Australians have come up and
[55:47] been able to you know somehow whatever
[55:49] they do you know formulate that or get
[55:51] the corona virus and now they can be
[55:53] able to make vaccines they're so
[55:55] thankful for that and you know my heart
[55:57] I thought you know how sad it is
[55:59] because now the world it's almost like a
[56:01] relief and you know one person they had
[56:03] a nurse I believe that now has come back
[56:05] after heaven the coronavirus has come
[56:07] back now they they they they they are
[56:10] not no longer with the symptoms or
[56:12] anything like that and they're now back
[56:14] working in the hospital and you think
[56:17] now once you think about it if we could
[56:19] tune in ears how much you had find among
[56:21] people go boy I thought it's gonna be
[56:24] real bad catastrophe boy this is really
[56:27] to have a man thinking this is over hey
[56:28] let's go back to Sinan
[56:30] you understand it's only it's only
[56:34] there's scares and fears but in there
[56:36] wonderful for you and I we can walk in
[56:39] peace I don't know what other virus is
[56:42] gonna come up I don't know a lot of them
[56:44] but it's all taken care of
[56:48] so how taken care of now notice this you
[56:53] know brother Brown I want to read this
[56:55] statement to you he says now concerning
[56:57] that in that I'm the Lord that he lives
[57:00] on that diseases and notice he says here
[57:03] for forty years in the wilderness
[57:04] without was only one medical one
[57:07] prescription I'm the Lord that healeth
[57:09] all thy diseases and he did it this is
[57:12] something very big he did it because
[57:15] they took him at his word and just set
[57:20] their self free
[57:24] the word brings freedom
[57:28] but just simply taking it well I don't
[57:31] know if I can't about you making it it
[57:33] ain't about you making it it's not your
[57:35] word it's his word he will bring his
[57:39] word to pass through our life it's just
[57:42] to take him at his word and just set
[57:46] ourselves free
[57:49] notice the scripture goes on in Exodus
[57:51] 23 25 and he says ye shall serve the
[57:54] Lord your God and he shall bless thy
[57:56] bread and thy water and I will take
[57:59] sickness away from the midst of thee
[58:02] notice how its worded I will take
[58:05] sickness away from thee sickness comes
[58:08] upon you comes upon me no heal me and he
[58:12] comes and takes it away
[58:16] Deuteronomy 7:15 and the Lord will take
[58:19] away from the all sickness who will the
[58:23] Lord sums 30 verse 2 O Lord my god I
[58:28] cried unto thee and thou hast healed me
[58:32] psalm 34:19 many are the afflictions of
[58:37] the righteous but
[58:39] the Lord delivereth him out up that's
[58:43] all
[58:45] who does that the Lord does that
[58:50] he acts 10:38
[58:54] notice here they are in sin in
[58:57] ministering the word they're identifying
[59:01] the working God was present in Christ
[59:04] verse 38 how God anointed Jesus of
[59:08] Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with
[59:11] power who went about doing good and
[59:13] healing all that were oppressed of the
[59:16] devil for God was with him
[59:21] somebody say all
[59:23] not some all
[59:27] his track record is still the same
[59:31] tonight
[59:32] everyone that'll have faith and take him
[59:35] at his word he still is the same tonight
[59:40] because oppression can come in your
[59:43] natural body oppression can come in your
[59:46] spirit in your mind come on now healed
[59:50] all that were oppressed of the devil for
[59:54] God was with him
[59:56] just so that somebody here tonight being
[59:59] president would understand this is weeks
[1:00:01] this was not something here of just
[1:00:04] recent God knows our need tonight
[1:00:09] hallelujah Matthew 4:23 and Jesus went
[1:00:14] about all Galilee teaching in their
[1:00:16] synagogues preaching the gospel of the
[1:00:18] kingdom and healing all manner of
[1:00:21] sickness and all manner of disease among
[1:00:25] the people and his fame went throughout
[1:00:28] all Syria and they brought unto him all
[1:00:33] sick people that were taken with divers
[1:00:36] meaning different types of diseases and
[1:00:38] torments and those that were possessed
[1:00:41] with Devils and those which were lunatic
[1:00:44] and those that had the palsy and He
[1:00:47] healed them
[1:00:50] Matthew 8:16 when the even was come they
[1:00:55] brought unto Him many that were
[1:00:57] possessed with devils and he cast out
[1:01:00] the spirits with his word and healed all
[1:01:03] that were sick
[1:01:06] verse 17 here it is that it might be
[1:01:11] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[1:01:14] prophet this is out of isaiah 53:4
[1:01:16] saying himself took our infirmities and
[1:01:21] bare our sicknesses he was fulfilling
[1:01:25] that this was not well you know we got
[1:01:27] away free goes to Calvary no he let it
[1:01:29] be no I am the Lord that healeth thee I
[1:01:31] will say I was the same one that was
[1:01:34] there although in the Old Testament that
[1:01:36] healed them when they were sick and now
[1:01:39] that same God is here walking God was in
[1:01:43] Christ and himself Oh think about it
[1:01:47] here he took our infirmities you know
[1:01:50] that took means he reached out and took
[1:01:52] them paralyzed remember Jesus as a
[1:01:55] gentleman he was not gonna walk he
[1:01:57] doesn't walk in he doesn't heal to show
[1:02:00] his power he's not a show-off but what
[1:02:03] it was there were hearts that were
[1:02:04] welcoming him they had needs in their
[1:02:07] lives and when he walked in I want you
[1:02:10] to understand this tonight there were
[1:02:11] needs that they had in their life and
[1:02:13] all they had to do was have faith in him
[1:02:16] and when that thing that was bothering
[1:02:18] there that had been binding them all
[1:02:21] they had to do is have faith in Him and
[1:02:23] Jesus walked right in and lifted it
[1:02:28] he took our infirmities the disease's
[1:02:33] weaknesses
[1:02:36] weaknesses of things you realize you
[1:02:39] would say well I don't have no weakness
[1:02:41] in my body no there are certain things
[1:02:42] that go along genetically you know
[1:02:45] brother Ram talks about an adoption
[1:02:46] serious he said if God Terry's long
[1:02:49] enough he said I hope one day you know
[1:02:50] to be able to come in and you know he
[1:02:52] said I hope Joseph is here and
[1:02:54] ministering and everything else and he
[1:02:55] said and I'll no doubt come in he said
[1:02:57] with the palsy because all the branham's
[1:02:59] get the palsy come on now you you've
[1:03:02] heard that in the message you see
[1:03:04] brother Branham one ignorant that there
[1:03:06] are weaknesses that can't abide in our
[1:03:08] body but we are not going to give in to
[1:03:10] it I said we're not going to glorify we
[1:03:14] are not going to set there and like
[1:03:16] making out an insurance policy say well
[1:03:18] you know what you know I am starting to
[1:03:20] feel a little funny you know mama had
[1:03:22] this and now we've got a promise I am
[1:03:24] the lord that healeth a
[1:03:28] you might be the one that God said it's
[1:03:32] been you that the cycle is going to be
[1:03:34] broke
[1:03:35] you might be the one that is the
[1:03:37] testimony to come forth to say his word
[1:03:40] has come into that place in my life and
[1:03:43] I really I don't have to be and live
[1:03:46] under that
[1:03:50] that's all in God's hands isn't it oh
[1:03:53] man what you understand all of this is
[1:03:56] by faith himself took our infirmities
[1:03:59] and bare our sicknesses he just took
[1:04:03] them and carried him
[1:04:07] oh my notice the Bible says in Matthew 9
[1:04:12] 35 and Jesus went about all the cities
[1:04:15] and villages teaching in their
[1:04:17] synagogues and preaching the gospel of
[1:04:20] the kingdom and healing every sickness
[1:04:22] and every disease among the people
[1:04:26] here is to the disciples in Luke 9 6 and
[1:04:30] they departed and went through the towns
[1:04:33] preaching the gospel healing everywhere
[1:04:36] you see what Jesus even what we read at
[1:04:39] the beginning what Jesus wanted them to
[1:04:41] know is that the word has power in it
[1:04:46] are you with me he did not want them to
[1:04:49] rest upon because we are not we know we
[1:04:52] do not rest upon that will when I pray
[1:04:55] for the sick they get healed because we
[1:04:57] realize there's many that can stand in
[1:04:58] Matthew 24 the Lord you know did not
[1:05:01] cast out Devils in that all right here
[1:05:03] they were doing this before the Holy
[1:05:04] Ghost ever come but how much greater it
[1:05:07] is when the Holy Ghost has come into
[1:05:11] that and made alive to a son and
[1:05:13] daughter of God and the word is there
[1:05:16] present in their life and for them to be
[1:05:19] able to stand there in the face of the
[1:05:21] enemy they're not only living above sin
[1:05:24] Omaha ver locking in authority above sin
[1:05:28] and they've got authority over the devil
[1:05:34] are you with me they went about healing
[1:05:37] everywhere this before the Holy Ghost
[1:05:39] came
[1:05:43] is that right
[1:05:45] Luke nine men look nine and ten and the
[1:05:50] apostles when they returned they told
[1:05:52] him all that had done they had done and
[1:05:54] he took them and went aside privately
[1:05:56] into a desert place belonging to the
[1:05:59] city called but the setter that the
[1:06:03] Bethsaida and the people when they knew
[1:06:06] it followed him and he received them and
[1:06:09] spake unto them of the kingdom of God
[1:06:12] and healed them that had need of healing
[1:06:22] none of that
[1:06:24] could have been done if they did not
[1:06:27] have faith
[1:06:29] they had to have faith
[1:06:32] listen to me they had needs in their
[1:06:35] life what we don't read in the scripture
[1:06:38] but we do know by the teaching of the
[1:06:41] word is that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:44] Himself is the one that stimulates by an
[1:06:49] operation of the Holy Ghost he'll come
[1:06:51] and stimulate our faith are you with me
[1:06:55] you see God doesn't say well I'm gonna
[1:06:58] bypass your faith no he comes to
[1:07:00] stimulate your faith because the promise
[1:07:02] is to you
[1:07:03] are you with me that's why brother
[1:07:06] Branham could stand on the platform he
[1:07:07] said that was not my faith he said that
[1:07:08] was an operation of the Holy Ghost that
[1:07:10] came to stimulate your faith God has
[1:07:13] healed you by your faith
[1:07:15] there's a whole separate part the Lord
[1:07:17] willing we'll we'll look within those
[1:07:19] things there but it's faith our own
[1:07:20] personal faith but we need we need that
[1:07:25] there's times we need strength from the
[1:07:27] Lord we need that and that don't mean
[1:07:30] you're not you're not mud well you're
[1:07:32] not much for believer that don't mean
[1:07:33] that at all we need strength sometimes
[1:07:39] thank God for that
[1:07:41] jesus said unto them in mark mark 6 for
[1:07:44] what's this a prophet is not without
[1:07:46] honor but in his own country and among
[1:07:48] his own kin and in his own house and he
[1:07:53] could there do no mighty work
[1:07:57] here's the mighty God think of this this
[1:08:00] is the mighty God who opened up the Red
[1:08:03] Sea
[1:08:04] standing in flesh part of the Jordan
[1:08:08] this is the mighty God that spoke
[1:08:10] through Elijah this is the mighty God
[1:08:13] who spoke through Moses and
[1:08:16] think of it he could do no mighty work
[1:08:19] there why
[1:08:22] because of their unbelief
[1:08:28] God operates by faith
[1:08:35] that's why I listen to me now that's why
[1:08:38] anything that would be contrary or would
[1:08:42] be a hindrance to your faith at all cast
[1:08:45] it out whether it's out of your mind or
[1:08:48] out of your life cast it out get rid of
[1:08:50] it
[1:08:52] and then take his word he could there do
[1:08:57] no mighty work save that he laid his
[1:08:59] hands upon a few sick folk and heal them
[1:09:04] I think brother Branham had just comes
[1:09:06] to me brother Branham would say it like
[1:09:07] this and restoration of the bride tree
[1:09:09] he said quit fighting at it
[1:09:12] he said let God come and take you to the
[1:09:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost let God come
[1:09:18] and take you to your healing let God
[1:09:21] come and take you to your deliverance he
[1:09:24] doesn't need our strength to do it he
[1:09:26] just needs faith in Him is
[1:09:30] that right as he said did you believe
[1:09:32] I'm able to do this so he laid his hands
[1:09:35] on a few sick folk and healed them now
[1:09:38] notice this here in Matthew 85 you're
[1:09:40] familiar with this this portion we've
[1:09:42] administered out this many times but
[1:09:44] here was the this interior one of the
[1:09:47] times in the scripture where you had
[1:09:49] someone come where the word was spoken
[1:09:51] and their servant was made whole in this
[1:09:54] here notice in Matthew it's verse 6 of
[1:09:58] Matthew 8 he said Lord my servant lieth
[1:10:03] at home sick of the palsy grievously
[1:10:06] tormented how many know sickness is a
[1:10:09] torment
[1:10:12] sickness is a torment it you know
[1:10:15] sometimes you know spirits can take
[1:10:17] bodily form a cancers and other things
[1:10:20] like that and then there's other times
[1:10:21] it just comes upon the body it is a tor
[1:10:24] mentor
[1:10:26] and he was grievously poor minute and
[1:10:31] Jesus said unto him look at these words
[1:10:33] I
[1:10:34] will come and heal him
[1:10:41] but here the roman centurion said
[1:10:46] you
[1:10:48] don't need to come but speak the word
[1:10:53] speak the word only and my servant shall
[1:10:57] be healed
[1:10:59] it was settled God was in Christ it was
[1:11:03] settled with him that the word that was
[1:11:06] spoken because he knew what it was to be
[1:11:08] under Authority he knew the authority of
[1:11:11] the word that was resting right there
[1:11:13] just speak the word and my servant will
[1:11:16] be made whole
[1:11:22] hallelujah the word going forth
[1:11:26] notice this
[1:11:30] how lujah
[1:11:32] glory be to God in the highest
[1:11:37] hallelujah I
[1:11:40] think of who we were and I think I gave
[1:11:42] this testimony in a prayer meeting if I
[1:11:44] gave it for a Thursday night then you
[1:11:45] forgive me for my some timers but there
[1:11:48] was a there was a young lady that had
[1:11:50] you know her sister you know they would
[1:11:53] be the family Reynolds family that we
[1:11:56] were praying for where the young lady
[1:11:59] had died in that passed on and that in
[1:12:01] that car accident her sister had come in
[1:12:03] the prayer line brother Andrew and I
[1:12:06] were standing there and you know I
[1:12:08] didn't know who it was and but brother
[1:12:10] Andrew knew and and so then brother
[1:12:13] Andrew was talking to me in that time
[1:12:14] and then then he calls me late that
[1:12:16] night and as he had left the meeting and
[1:12:18] he said can I call you real quick he had
[1:12:20] got a call we had prayed that God that
[1:12:23] the Lord would move upon the sisters
[1:12:26] heart and God would break that fear that
[1:12:28] was upon her life
[1:12:31] because after a situation you know how
[1:12:33] this sometimes when tragic or traumatic
[1:12:36] things take place
[1:12:37] things sometimes their knee there has to
[1:12:40] come that to break that away well you
[1:12:43] know God was working on both ends
[1:12:45] because I think she was that night
[1:12:46] they'd went over to brother Matt
[1:12:48] Morris's Church for for a meeting as
[1:12:50] well but it they called back and said
[1:12:52] that my sister called me and she said
[1:12:55] I'm free
[1:12:59] so brother Andrew is wanting to you know
[1:13:01] to reverse you know if we were to talk
[1:13:03] about that and and and he said she asked
[1:13:05] her sister what time was it and the
[1:13:09] Astra what time that was it was at the
[1:13:11] same time see God was working God was
[1:13:15] working it was God who did that very not
[1:13:18] one person with her whoever was praying
[1:13:20] whether his brother Matt or whoever it
[1:13:22] wasn't the man or a person it is God who
[1:13:26] healed that situation you know when it
[1:13:29] comes down to show you and I
[1:13:31] isn't necessary for the flesh to be
[1:13:34] there what it is is sin the word
[1:13:39] hallelujah speak the word only
[1:13:43] you've been given the worse speak to
[1:13:47] that situation
[1:13:50] this same Lord Jesus said if I can just
[1:13:54] step into mark 16 verse 17 in that
[1:13:57] portion these signs shall follow them
[1:14:00] that believe in my name shall they cast
[1:14:03] out Devils they shall speak with new
[1:14:06] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[1:14:09] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[1:14:12] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[1:14:16] the sick and they shall recover notice
[1:14:18] it didn't say pray for him he just said
[1:14:21] lay hands on the sick we believe in
[1:14:23] praying for the sick but the Prophet
[1:14:25] would pick that verse up and say see it
[1:14:27] is the same life but was there in
[1:14:30] Elijah's bones when they threw the dead
[1:14:32] man on him that man came back to life he
[1:14:35] said it is simply the quickening power
[1:14:37] of God that is in the body of Jesus
[1:14:41] Christ
[1:14:42] hallelujah
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:51] hallelujah
[1:14:53] brother Branham reads this scripture
[1:14:56] here in the message God's provided way
[1:14:57] of healing what a wonderful message he
[1:15:00] reads this scripture out of Psalms 103
[1:15:03] and he comes into this place bless the
[1:15:06] Lord verse 2 O my soul and forget not
[1:15:08] all his benefits who forgiveth all thine
[1:15:11] iniquities who healeth all thy diseases
[1:15:17] so a brother Samuel why does it seem
[1:15:20] like that really tonight we're putting
[1:15:22] the emphasis on him because that's who
[1:15:23] it should be put on that's why brother
[1:15:25] Brandon would say it now he said now
[1:15:27] look you said every one of you he said I
[1:15:29] want to look at your pastors your
[1:15:31] ministers that are standing up here they
[1:15:33] are standing identifying with this word
[1:15:35] he said when I'm gone Jesus is not gone
[1:15:40] you see what the Ministry of Malachi
[1:15:43] thought it is to identify its hyung
[1:15:46] going getting a church ready and to
[1:15:49] identify that the resurrected Lord Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ is here present among us
[1:15:55] he's working in his body
[1:16:02] who forgiveth all thine iniquities
[1:16:07] remember in marriage and divorce he had
[1:16:10] some different ones after brother
[1:16:11] Branham came out of there he was given
[1:16:12] you know the the pillar fire and allowed
[1:16:15] him to pronounce how God came down and
[1:16:17] aligning pronounce that grace because of
[1:16:18] those false unions and things that had
[1:16:20] been made in people they had they had
[1:16:22] they you know they had come into a lot
[1:16:24] of those situations and things and here
[1:16:26] they were setting I think of how that
[1:16:28] brother hankins and I think brother
[1:16:30] mental Friesen was there in those times
[1:16:31] people absolutely had bags packed and
[1:16:34] ready to split their ways because they
[1:16:37] wanted to be true to the Word of God but
[1:16:40] grace came in on the scene
[1:16:42] and said don't you never do it again and
[1:16:45] teach your children never to do it and
[1:16:49] remember somebody broke as they spoke up
[1:16:52] you know brother Ram picked it up in
[1:16:53] later messages and said I
[1:16:55] can't forgive sin who can say this they
[1:16:59] said that same thing to the Lord Jesus
[1:17:01] come on now well who can who can do this
[1:17:04] but you see what it was it wasn't
[1:17:07] brother branham doing it he was given
[1:17:10] the charge by the word it was what God
[1:17:13] was saying to his people God just
[1:17:16] borrowed his prophets body and lips
[1:17:21] girl repeater god I feel good how about
[1:17:25] you
[1:17:29] oh and brother Brahim he closes the book
[1:17:30] right after he reads this scripture
[1:17:32] closes it in a message cause provider
[1:17:34] where healing he said I say tonight this
[1:17:36] scripture is fulfilled
[1:17:38] this day in your presence all he says
[1:17:42] heals us of all of our diseases forgives
[1:17:45] all iniquities today the word is made
[1:17:49] manifest today
[1:17:52] glory be to God think about this here
[1:17:56] Peter and John walking around the gate
[1:17:59] called beautiful
[1:18:00] we were they were walking around here as
[1:18:02] a lame man he had been lame from his
[1:18:04] mother's womb this was not even a
[1:18:06] situation that he had Ahad had come
[1:18:08] across or this sickness had come into
[1:18:10] his body
[1:18:12] this was something that came he from
[1:18:14] when he came out of the womb
[1:18:16] but Peter and John said look on us
[1:18:20] what they were calling him to was to the
[1:18:24] ever-present reality of the Living God
[1:18:27] silver and gold have we none he said he
[1:18:32] was expecting are you with me he was
[1:18:35] expecting he was sitting there expecting
[1:18:37] something they took his expectation and
[1:18:41] put the expectation is something much
[1:18:45] greater than just a temporal thing come
[1:18:49] on somebody they put his expectation now
[1:18:52] in the word and in the name of Jesus
[1:18:56] Christ raisa the Bible said the man was
[1:18:59] instantly healed they began to walk and
[1:19:02] not just walk he began to leap and
[1:19:04] praise God that
[1:19:07] got the devil stirred up Bodrum said on
[1:19:11] the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost
[1:19:12] was poured out the devil didn't even get
[1:19:14] out of his bed
[1:19:17] but he said right here the devil got up
[1:19:19] on the side of his bed and started to
[1:19:21] pout
[1:19:22] yes sir you know why because it was that
[1:19:26] same life in action
[1:19:33] what he had experienced think about
[1:19:36] running this was a devil this was a
[1:19:38] spirit that had this man bound a
[1:19:42] lameness and think about it all the
[1:19:45] rumors that had been maybe coming all
[1:19:47] the way down through hell of the Lord
[1:19:49] Jesus Christ and to think about it they
[1:19:51] were they had to heed to the authority
[1:19:54] of the word that was there they had the
[1:19:56] backing of the Holy Ghost within their
[1:19:59] life I
[1:20:03] think of the situation you know her
[1:20:06] brother Danny's team and telleth there
[1:20:08] was a brother who was pastoring in
[1:20:09] Mexico and they were she was trying to
[1:20:11] cast out a spirit doing the best that he
[1:20:13] could do and that spirit wasn't even so
[1:20:16] he went and he got a picture of a half
[1:20:18] of the pillar fire in Houston Texas and
[1:20:20] he pointed that to that light are you
[1:20:24] catching me he pointed there to that
[1:20:25] light he said you know what that is and
[1:20:28] you know what that devil had to
[1:20:32] recognize that and this is what he said
[1:20:35] listen to me he said well he said that
[1:20:38] same message that was brought right here
[1:20:40] he said I am under that and I am
[1:20:43] represented by that same God the spirit
[1:20:46] left
[1:20:50] Alleluia
[1:20:53] that is why the Prophet when he would
[1:20:56] refer to that picture he said God had
[1:20:59] his picture taken with us
[1:21:05] hallelujah
[1:21:08] glory be to God
[1:21:11] blessed be the name of the Lord they
[1:21:14] identified that name the name of the
[1:21:17] Lord Jesus Christ they let him know that
[1:21:20] this is by the name of Jesus Christ
[1:21:23] through faith in his name was this man
[1:21:27] made whole
[1:21:30] many other scriptures I could read but
[1:21:32] I'm just going to just bring it down
[1:21:34] here tonight Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ
[1:21:38] the same
[1:21:41] yesterday today and forever Hebrews 4:15
[1:21:46] for we have not an High Priest which
[1:21:48] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[1:21:50] our infirmities our diseases but was in
[1:21:54] all points tempted like as we are yet
[1:21:57] without sin let us therefore come boldly
[1:22:00] unto the throne of grace that we may
[1:22:03] obtain mercy and find grace to help in
[1:22:06] the time of need
[1:22:10] but the Brandon would say it like this
[1:22:12] closing
[1:22:14] all he said how when we think about all
[1:22:17] these things
[1:22:18] the Great Physician is now present he
[1:22:23] wants to heal the sick and afflicted
[1:22:30] he wants to make those who are weary to
[1:22:34] be strong he wants to make those who are
[1:22:38] afflicted to be well I'm going to go
[1:22:41] ahead and read this next part as well
[1:22:43] because I believe within this here you
[1:22:46] look at how there should be worship and
[1:22:49] Thanksgiving in our prayer he said
[1:22:51] although a great physician as our hearts
[1:22:53] bleed out we black like that sheep we
[1:22:57] hear your spirit moving back to us my
[1:23:00] sheep know my voice and we love to shout
[1:23:03] thy praises we love to weep in my
[1:23:06] presence for joy we like to express our
[1:23:09] feelings to thee because we love you
[1:23:12] with all that's within our whole soul
[1:23:15] mind and body loves the Lord and we pray
[1:23:19] God that you will give us this deeper
[1:23:23] and deeper continually may it become so
[1:23:27] real to us that the world will fade and
[1:23:29] all of its folly then there will be no
[1:23:30] more thoughts of it it'll fade out into
[1:23:32] eternity it had a beginning now may it
[1:23:35] have an end we know it will and now we
[1:23:38] pray God as we your children stand here
[1:23:42] making intercession for each other in
[1:23:46] the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:23:49] for the infirmities that is in our body
[1:23:53] caused by sin of the past and of the
[1:23:58] wickedness of the world and our mortal
[1:24:01] flesh so subject to all the enemy
[1:24:04] because it's still sin and we say that
[1:24:08] the Bible declares unto us plainly the
[1:24:12] Holy Ghost helps our infirmity and
[1:24:17] intercession we come to the Father this
[1:24:21] morning humbly believing that you will
[1:24:23] make intercession for us now that as we
[1:24:25] confess our sin and our wrongs and our
[1:24:27] desires for thee our hearts are hungry
[1:24:30] to be well so that we can serve and do
[1:24:34] the work that you would have us to do
[1:24:37] Granite Lord as your elder would go
[1:24:39] forth with the anointing to lay hands
[1:24:41] upon the sick may the spirit come forth
[1:24:43] healing we ask it through Jesus our Lord
[1:24:50] as I'm going back over and just reading
[1:24:53] just just looking at these things and
[1:24:55] praying I thought as I come upon that
[1:24:59] part where brother Branham makes a
[1:25:01] statement for the infirmities of our
[1:25:04] body caused by sin of the past and of
[1:25:08] the wickedness of the world and our
[1:25:10] mortal flesh so subject to all the enemy
[1:25:12] because it's still sin I thought of that
[1:25:15] that that statement what would come to
[1:25:18] my heart
[1:25:19] when we look at that because we know
[1:25:21] that that that sickness we know that sin
[1:25:23] we know that those things that sometimes
[1:25:25] you know from the past may be what
[1:25:27] somebody did in their in in their past
[1:25:29] before the Lord had got ahold of their
[1:25:31] life maybe their their bearing some
[1:25:33] effect of that within their body yet
[1:25:35] their soul is completely sealed and it
[1:25:38] isn't that God's punishment but I want
[1:25:39] to just bring you to a point in the
[1:25:41] scripture that I believe that will help
[1:25:43] you
[1:25:43] when Elijah went to the woman in 1st
[1:25:47] Kings 17 and he spoke to her remember
[1:25:51] here she had just enough to make one
[1:25:54] little cake and they were going to die
[1:25:56] her her and her son was going to half
[1:25:58] that they were going to die but the word
[1:26:01] of the Lord rang out you know to see
[1:26:03] we're in obedience she put the word
[1:26:05] before anything
[1:26:08] and when she did that God seeing her
[1:26:12] heart within that it rang out for that
[1:26:15] saith the Lord the mill barrel will
[1:26:18] never go empty the crew savoia shall not
[1:26:22] fail
[1:26:27] now this is me personally I don't
[1:26:30] believe that it was just like flour
[1:26:32] falling on the ground I don't believe
[1:26:34] there was oil to running off running out
[1:26:36] of the crus to her house but I believe
[1:26:37] every time that she had a need
[1:26:41] what she had need was there
[1:26:46] are you with me she didn't have to go
[1:26:49] somewhere else what she had need up was
[1:26:51] in her own house and
[1:26:54] let me just say it like this this was a
[1:26:57] place that Elijah was abiding in
[1:27:03] and the Bible said when the boy fell
[1:27:06] sick and that remember what she said men
[1:27:09] of God are now come to call my sin to
[1:27:13] remembrance and Elijah took the boy and
[1:27:17] remember Elijah wasn't searching for the
[1:27:20] answer Lord had thou come to bring evil
[1:27:23] upon this paper and then Elijah as he's
[1:27:27] looking for the answer God let's see no
[1:27:29] the answer is in the body are you with
[1:27:34] me I said the answer is in the body of
[1:27:38] Jesus Christ and
[1:27:41] he laid upon the baby
[1:27:47] and it came to life and this is what's
[1:27:52] important is because after that was done
[1:27:55] the closing words out of the widow of
[1:27:57] Zarephath out of her mouth she said now
[1:28:00] and knowest that the word of the Lord is
[1:28:05] in my mouth
[1:28:08] you see notice it wasn't just that God
[1:28:11] had given to her what would sustain them
[1:28:14] and that would carry them through in the
[1:28:16] fan-in through that of the famine but it
[1:28:18] was a Ministry of life that God would
[1:28:21] let her know that my word is greater
[1:28:25] than your past
[1:28:27] she was worried about her past she was
[1:28:31] worried that her past was going to
[1:28:33] travel her but God let her know my word
[1:28:37] is greater than your past
[1:28:40] you say what does that mean you don't
[1:28:43] have to knuckle down or be subservient
[1:28:45] to any sickness under that healeth all
[1:28:50] thy diseases
[1:28:54] the stand
[1:28:58] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:29:02] hallelujah
[1:29:04] and the Lord that healeth all thy
[1:29:07] diseases
[1:29:10] there would be to God
[1:29:13] hey men and we are convinced that
[1:29:18] as the word of the Lord will spoke the
[1:29:21] Bible said when that was spoke to the
[1:29:23] woman that the mill barrel will shall
[1:29:25] not fail nor The Crucible the Bible said
[1:29:27] and that spake the Lord by elijah the
[1:29:31] word the sustained in the famine came by
[1:29:34] the mouth of Elisha it was God's word
[1:29:37] God used the mouth of Elisha to speak it
[1:29:40] when death came about of sudden tragedy
[1:29:44] and it was a tragedy that for her the
[1:29:46] enemy was trying to tie her back to past
[1:29:49] come on now wonder bring fear and one to
[1:29:53] try to hold something over her head come
[1:29:55] on somebody but God let him the word has
[1:29:59] brought a clearing of everything when
[1:30:02] the abstract to the title deed has come
[1:30:05] it clears everything that was ever
[1:30:08] against you
[1:30:13] brother Simon what does that come to
[1:30:15] you've got a right to stand toe-to-toe
[1:30:17] with the devil and say you're nothing
[1:30:19] but a liar you're a bluff
[1:30:23] come on somebody
