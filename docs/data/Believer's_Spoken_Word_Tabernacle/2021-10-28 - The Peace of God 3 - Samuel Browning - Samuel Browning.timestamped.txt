[29:13] [Music]
[29:22] amen
[29:23] it's words that really speak of a
[29:25] request from our heart
[29:27] amen that we just desire that
[29:30] not only we thank god for the change
[29:32] that he's brought in our life
[29:34] but to also know the grace of god that
[29:36] accompanies to mold us
[29:39] to shape us
[29:40] to change us brother brahman said it
[29:42] like this he said god will take
[29:44] the sons
[29:46] and he conforms us to his image
[29:49] with nail scarred
[29:51] hands
[29:53] it's tremendous how god deals with our
[29:55] lives and works with us
[29:57] molds us and you know the the reality of
[29:59] it is as as sons and daughters of god
[30:02] we want to be more like him
[30:05] we want to be more like him once that
[30:07] that change has taken place in our life
[30:09] and that desire to want to be more like
[30:10] him is is is is is that of god moving
[30:14] with in our life
[30:16] and the only thing we have to do is
[30:17] yield
[30:18] more and more and you know that's it
[30:20] sounds very simple and it is
[30:23] but sometimes there's so many things
[30:25] that get in the way so many complexities
[30:27] but you know there's only one that can
[30:29] resolve that
[30:30] and that's him
[30:32] the one who's calling for it
[30:34] he's the one that can bring that about
[30:36] in our life to where we can rest because
[30:38] there's not one of us here
[30:40] that can make the word come to pass
[30:42] there's times that you all know we
[30:44] fellowshipped about things you wanted
[30:46] maybe something me too wanted something
[30:48] to go in a certain way or maybe we
[30:49] prayed about this or you know whether it
[30:51] was healing whatever it is
[30:53] and it and it wasn't anything that we
[30:55] could do i mean abraham prayed and asked
[30:58] god to let ishmael live before thee
[31:01] is that right
[31:03] and god just moved right on over top of
[31:05] that as though he didn't even hear it
[31:06] and he spoke directly
[31:08] to regarding isaac
[31:10] is that right
[31:11] the lord jesus prayed and said let this
[31:14] cup
[31:15] pass from me
[31:17] three times
[31:18] aren't you glad that god didn't answer
[31:20] that prayer
[31:22] i am
[31:23] without that where would we be tonight
[31:26] but you see what were those prayers all
[31:28] about
[31:29] god shows even in these things for you
[31:32] and i that god would even allow to show
[31:35] that in that to relate to you and i that
[31:37] there are times that even that what we
[31:39] ask for it deals with things about our
[31:42] humanity
[31:44] are you with me
[31:45] the lord jesus he he knew he knew what
[31:48] laid before him brother bannon put terms
[31:50] like this in souls in prison now he said
[31:52] jesus even prayed to dodge
[31:55] the cross
[31:57] those are exact words
[31:59] now his desire and he knew did he not
[32:01] know the purpose he was called to
[32:03] he knew the purpose
[32:05] he knew the purpose all along and he
[32:07] stated that all along but knowing the
[32:09] purpose
[32:10] did not
[32:12] make it easy at that moment to fulfill
[32:15] it
[32:16] but aren't you glad that god would sow
[32:18] condense into such a place that he could
[32:20] experience that that you and i could
[32:22] know what it's like that he could know
[32:24] what it's like when we could go to him
[32:26] and say father i'm struggling right here
[32:29] lord i need help i want to come into
[32:31] that place of committal that place of
[32:33] surrender you say brother samuel even as
[32:35] a believer as a believer
[32:38] as a believer
[32:39] amen to continue to just trust the lord
[32:42] i i'm so glad about that i am so
[32:44] thankful for that that we have
[32:47] that of our high priest who can be
[32:49] touched by the feeling of our
[32:50] infirmities
[32:52] amen so don't ever let the devil tell
[32:54] you anything other than that
[32:56] we have one
[32:57] who understands us
[33:00] amen when he raised on that easter
[33:02] morning he took back
[33:04] the human body
[33:07] now the human body as it sits there on
[33:10] the throne of god so what what is that
[33:12] god relates to you and i is able to move
[33:16] and relate to you and i through
[33:17] understanding what it was like to walk
[33:19] in humanity
[33:22] oh aren't you glad for that i said god
[33:24] i'm thankful for that let that same
[33:26] understanding work through my life
[33:29] amen let's just pray tonight
[33:32] let's go to him in a word of prayer you
[33:33] have a need upon your heart let's just
[33:35] let's just put it before him tonight

[38:10] without father without mother without
[38:12] descent having neither beginning of days
[38:15] nor end of life
[38:17] but made liken to the son of god abideth
[38:21] a priest continually
[38:23] now consider how great this man was unto
[38:26] whom even the patriarch abraham gave the
[38:29] tenth of the spoils
[38:31] and verily they that are of the sons of
[38:34] levi
[38:35] who receive the office of the priesthood
[38:37] have a commandment to take tithes of the
[38:40] people according to the law that is of
[38:42] their brethren though they come out of
[38:44] the loins of abraham
[38:46] but he whose descent is not counted from
[38:50] them received tithes of abraham
[38:54] and blessed him that had the promises
[38:57] and without contradiction the less is
[39:00] blessed of the better
[39:02] and here men that die receive tithes but
[39:05] there he receiveth them of whom it is
[39:08] witnessed that he liveth and as i may so
[39:11] say levi also who received tithes paid
[39:15] tithes in abraham
[39:17] for he was yet in the loins of his
[39:19] father when melchizedek met him amen may
[39:23] god bless you bless the reading of the
[39:24] word as you're being seated
[39:29] you know brother branham would take
[39:32] and he would speak
[39:33] two messages with
[39:36] uh the
[39:38] the name
[39:39] of melchizedek in it and we you're
[39:42] familiar with that melchizedek great
[39:44] king and and and and great king and and
[39:47] um
[39:48] and prince and then he would come around
[39:51] in 65 there and speak the message who is
[39:54] this melchizedek
[39:56] and you re brother branham would start
[39:58] within it there's many there's there's
[40:00] many parts within both of those messages
[40:02] and i just feel drawn to that
[40:05] here
[40:06] within looking at the peace of god
[40:08] because when we are speaking of the
[40:10] peace of god
[40:12] and one thing that i realize and i
[40:14] believe we realize as believers is you
[40:16] can't take the word
[40:19] and separate god from his word for god
[40:22] is the word
[40:23] and it and the letter alone will do no
[40:26] good without the spirit
[40:28] but it's the spirit that gives life to
[40:31] the word it
[40:32] gives breath gives inspiration puts the
[40:35] word into action into motion and it it
[40:38] reveals god to be the same brother
[40:41] brandon picks this up with this of
[40:43] melchizedek and he speaks of how
[40:46] this is a much uh there's much dispute
[40:49] about this person of who this is and
[40:51] brother braham said there's many
[40:53] different schools of thoughts he said
[40:54] there's one school of thought that
[40:56] claims he's just a myth and he wasn't
[40:59] actually a person
[41:00] and the other would say he was a
[41:02] priesthood brother brahm said that part
[41:04] about a priesthood would seem the more
[41:05] likely he said but in in but in reality
[41:09] of where he says it's spoken he says he
[41:12] was a person not a priesthood
[41:15] because he was a man and his soul is a
[41:18] man so not he's not an order but he's a
[41:22] person so when we see this when we look
[41:25] back into the scripture if you think
[41:27] back to the scripture we just read
[41:29] without father without mother without
[41:32] descent having neither beginning of days
[41:35] nor end of life there's only one person
[41:38] that that description fits and that is
[41:41] god himself
[41:43] is that right so it's a very the very
[41:46] person is eternal and this is why it
[41:49] could only be one person and that is god
[41:52] and so we recognize that within this
[41:55] that this was the pre-figure
[41:57] of the lord jesus himself and we could
[42:00] pick that up in psalms and go through
[42:01] that
[42:02] and i want to take us back into a
[42:04] scripture to even how that isaiah was
[42:07] picked up in the spirit and not only did
[42:09] isaiah see
[42:11] the offering up of of the sacrifice
[42:14] wherein that god himself would come down
[42:16] and and god would would pay there would
[42:19] be the price that would be paid for you
[42:21] and i in redemption but yet isaiah was
[42:25] also lifted up to be able to see the
[42:28] condescension
[42:29] of god himself coming down to where god
[42:33] would take upon a human form
[42:35] and how that isaiah would record it in
[42:38] isaiah 9 6 that he would be called his
[42:41] name would be called not that his name
[42:43] is but his name would be called you know
[42:47] it's just like how you could refer to
[42:49] somebody and you know somebody might
[42:51] mention their name and you say well
[42:52] that's a lovely person but their name's
[42:54] not lovely you're only speaking an
[42:57] attribute of that person when their name
[42:59] is mentioned
[43:00] and then in other times you could say oh
[43:02] that person's critical you're only
[43:04] speaking an attribute that comes out
[43:06] when that name is mentioned and so here
[43:08] are the attributes that isaiah is caught
[43:10] up in by the spirit of god that would
[43:13] describe that of of of the lord jesus
[43:16] he's wonderful he's a counselor my
[43:19] goodness i mean to be a counselor you
[43:21] know when you look at a counselor isn't
[43:24] so much a talker a counselor is a
[43:26] listener
[43:28] is that right
[43:29] you know sometimes we we fail so many
[43:31] times we're ready to try to we want to
[43:33] solve problems but solving the problem
[43:36] sometimes isn't saying anything it's
[43:37] simply being a good listener
[43:40] hello
[43:41] he's a counselor he's account he knows
[43:43] how to bring counsel how to console our
[43:46] lives he's so his name is called
[43:49] wonderful counselor the mighty god the
[43:53] everlasting father and the prince of
[43:56] peace
[43:57] and of the increase of his government
[43:58] and peace there shall be no end now to
[44:02] recognize how god when god came down and
[44:06] he's you know as he makes himself known
[44:08] to abraham here in this place as being a
[44:12] pre-figure of the lord jesus here here
[44:15] it is it has god himself is coming down
[44:18] and he meets abraham and i want you just
[44:20] to draw from this a moment he meets
[44:23] abraham before abraham gets back home
[44:26] and it's after the battle is over
[44:29] and all of those types come into there
[44:32] in that place remember
[44:34] it was on
[44:35] because he serves him bread and wine and
[44:38] it was there at pentecost i'm talking
[44:40] about back in acts 2
[44:43] this is where the bread and wine came in
[44:46] as god himself here the lord jesus was
[44:49] seated on the right hand of god with
[44:52] power and authority and he sends back
[44:55] the holy ghost the same jesus now
[44:58] coming into the lives of the believers
[45:00] but remember how they were in the upper
[45:01] room they themselves had fought the
[45:04] battle and now after the battle they are
[45:08] receiving the bread and the wine
[45:11] that of the holy ghost that because the
[45:14] holy spirit remember and the word are
[45:16] not two separate things we're talking
[45:18] about god that word the living god
[45:21] become wrapped up in the lives of his
[45:23] children and here at the end time it was
[45:27] necessary that this revelation be made
[45:30] known because before the church gets
[45:34] back home
[45:35] before the church is raptured the church
[45:39] would return to the original power that
[45:42] was at pentecost that god would once
[45:45] again
[45:46] reveal himself in the fullness of his
[45:49] word bread and wine and he wasn't giving
[45:53] it just to anybody but he gives it to
[45:55] abraham
[45:57] remember abraham was offered there were
[46:01] many kings around at this time and
[46:03] abraham is tested he is tempted he is uh
[46:08] you know let me give you the goods for
[46:10] going down here and bringing back the
[46:12] captives but abraham
[46:14] rejected
[46:16] any of the spoil because he said my life
[46:19] has not been lived for material or
[46:22] earthly goods i have lived my life to
[46:25] loosen captives that prisoners might go
[46:28] free are you with me he he came in
[46:31] contact with that of ladies here where
[46:34] lady osea is right you've got to write
[46:37] for certain things we have rights for
[46:39] things listen the prophet had a right to
[46:41] be a trapper he had a right to do that
[46:44] but you see as a sheep of god we're not
[46:47] so much interested in what our rights
[46:50] are as far as well i can do this and i
[46:53] can do this let me just say it there's a
[46:55] lot of american rights and privileges
[46:58] here in this nation that contradict the
[47:01] very rights of almighty god
[47:04] you know a person can live in sin smoke
[47:06] and do everything else and that's an
[47:08] american privilege there's a freedom to
[47:10] it but that's not the freedom of god the
[47:14] freedom of god calls us from bondage
[47:17] because that's not real freedom real
[47:20] freedom is only in the person of jesus
[47:24] christ
[47:25] you see this is why that even people now
[47:27] as it's heading into a weekend right now
[47:30] you know how it is many times this is
[47:31] where people start getting their jump
[47:33] start on on a thursday of heading into a
[47:36] weekend and they'll have the reprieve of
[47:38] what they're looking for this weekend
[47:40] some even going and doing things that
[47:42] they really don't want to do and know
[47:44] it's tearing down their lives but
[47:46] they'll go ahead and do it but what a
[47:48] contrast of the believer we are not
[47:51] sitting here tonight against our own
[47:53] will we are here tonight worshiping god
[47:56] we are living for god in a true liberty
[47:59] it's not something that we have to make
[48:02] ourselves to do oh sure the flesh gets
[48:04] weak the flesh gets tired sometimes but
[48:07] there is a resource on the inside where
[48:10] we have been set at liberty in jesus
[48:13] christ and we desire to please him
[48:18] so you know brother branham talks about
[48:20] this of where her god how god had come
[48:23] down and he reveals himself to abraham
[48:26] and i want if you look at the setting
[48:28] hear the setting all the kings
[48:30] everything is taking place right there
[48:33] in that time remember the war was over
[48:35] the slime pits the oil fields all those
[48:38] things there was contention all around
[48:40] at that time all these kings are present
[48:43] ruling powers but right there in that
[48:45] moment it's as though there is a tent of
[48:48] meeting with abraham and melchizedek it
[48:52] shows that a believer can be so isolated
[48:56] in the presence of god to where lady
[48:59] osea and every other king is not able to
[49:02] affect or penetrate your life i'm
[49:05] talking about a privilege that you have
[49:07] as a believer that whether wherever
[49:09] you're at you're able to have a meeting
[49:12] with this melchizedek the living god
[49:19] and abraham notice
[49:21] abraham the scripture would record how
[49:24] abraham he reckoned abraham recognized
[49:28] who this was out of all the other kings
[49:31] there abraham never paid tithe because
[49:34] the tithe when you traced it on back it
[49:36] was that of an honor it's recognizing
[49:38] the presence of a great one that that
[49:41] they would do that in the lands but to
[49:43] notice abraham never he never divided up
[49:46] his tithe and said well i'll give some
[49:48] to sodom i'll give some to this one i'll
[49:51] give some to this one but he reserved
[49:53] the tithe
[49:56] and remember the tithe is that ten
[49:58] percent
[50:00] it might be a small part but remember
[50:03] god is taking a tithe out of the earth
[50:08] are you with me what is that tithe that
[50:10] tied in tithe is his beloved
[50:15] is that right when he descended in
[50:17] revelations 10 he had a little book open
[50:21] the book was opened but the little book
[50:24] meaning that of the lamb's book of life
[50:27] that this word would call forth to the
[50:30] sons of faith in this hour that they
[50:33] would recognize melchizedek almighty god
[50:36] appearing in his word in the fulfillment
[50:39] before we get home and to recognize our
[50:42] time of departure is nigh
[50:46] because we have met melchizedek the
[50:49] living god before we get back home
[50:53] so to think that within this
[50:56] uh this greatness of how
[50:58] that you know that the surrendering of
[51:01] our lives and you see remember as we
[51:04] read last week regarding the peace of
[51:06] god
[51:07] remember and in the book of um
[51:10] uh
[51:10] in the book of of hebrews it speaks
[51:14] that the god of peace that brought our
[51:16] lord jesus from
[51:18] from the grave
[51:19] you see it was the god of peace
[51:22] god peace and once you think of the word
[51:24] peace it's harmony
[51:28] harmony can you imagine up here tonight
[51:30] i mean you know let me just go over here
[51:32] and you might want to plug your ears
[51:33] just for a moment but can you imagine if
[51:35] here i am just up here and say let's
[51:37] let's sing amazing grace
[51:39] and you'd say i thought it's supposed to
[51:41] be how sweet the sound
[51:44] i mean it sounds like a mess
[51:46] right
[51:47] why there's no
[51:48] harmony but harmony is where things
[51:51] blend together
[51:55] you say brother samuel oh that takes the
[51:57] holy ghost i agree but the bible says
[52:00] before the holy ghost came verse one of
[52:04] chapter two they were all in one place
[52:07] and one accord before the holy ghost
[52:10] came
[52:11] how much more for holy ghost believers
[52:14] to lay hold on a promise that if our
[52:17] lives can be brought in such unity and
[52:20] it has to be in order to receive the
[52:22] promise of god the holy ghost it has to
[52:24] be in order to receive any other promise
[52:27] that we have need of we have to come in
[52:29] unity and harmony with god oh don't let
[52:32] the devil try to sell you short as
[52:34] though that oh my you need some super
[52:37] power and something to come down and do
[52:39] it for you all we need is the god that
[52:42] has already delivered us
[52:44] brought us this far
[52:46] to help us to turn ourselves loose to
[52:50] where he can go ahead and do what alone
[52:52] he can do
[52:57] if abraham could recognize in the middle
[52:59] of this you think abraham when he
[53:02] approached us with his servants this
[53:03] battle you think abraham was going about
[53:05] it casually not at all he he gathered
[53:08] his trained servants and armed them
[53:12] is that right but god was letting him
[53:15] know he was pleased because the battle
[53:18] the battle that he engaged in was not a
[53:21] battle of ill motives
[53:24] this battle was about remember he
[53:27] pursued the bible says unto the utmost
[53:29] of dan and the prophet takes it in the
[53:31] hebrew series he said he went to the
[53:33] lowest parts of hell he pursued down to
[53:37] the lowest part in order to deliver and
[53:40] bring back every captive or you know
[53:42] what it shows it doesn't matter how far
[53:44] a person is gone or how far they think
[53:47] they've gone you can't outrun the reach
[53:50] of almighty god surely goodness and
[53:53] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[53:56] life
[53:57] it'll pursue after pursue after me
[54:00] so here we find this piece of god in
[54:03] romans 5.
[54:05] this is where this piece of god residing
[54:08] within our hearts it's that same piece
[54:11] of god that brought our lord jesus
[54:13] from
[54:14] from the grave is the same god of peace
[54:18] same god of peace that brings forth sons
[54:21] and daughters of god from
[54:23] death to life
[54:26] is that right
[54:27] amen now notice
[54:29] when we look at this here romans 5 1
[54:32] says therefore being justified
[54:35] by
[54:35] faith
[54:37] we have peace with god
[54:39] through our lord jesus christ
[54:43] justified by faith
[54:45] by whom also we have access by faith
[54:48] into this grace wherein we stand and
[54:50] rejoice in hope of the glory of god
[54:55] ephesians 2 14 says he is
[54:58] our peace
[55:00] and this is a peace that the world
[55:03] cannot give
[55:04] the world talks about peace
[55:06] remember even in the days of of there of
[55:09] israel in the
[55:11] in in uh
[55:13] the heading into judgment
[55:16] where jeremiah is standing there
[55:17] remember hananiah
[55:19] and all the rest of there were many
[55:21] false prophets
[55:23] that at that time that were standing up
[55:26] and wanting to proclaim peace to the
[55:28] people now i want you to understand this
[55:30] they looked at jeremiah and the rest of
[55:33] them you guys are troublemakers but they
[55:35] weren't troublemakers
[55:37] what it was is they were going to battle
[55:40] against the enemy that was taking peace
[55:44] from the people of god sin doesn't bring
[55:47] peace
[55:49] sin brings confusion and bondage and
[55:53] everything else that accompanies it you
[55:55] attack everything every every every
[55:58] situation doubt and everything else that
[56:00] accompanies sin but what accompanies
[56:03] righteousness
[56:04] peace
[56:09] remember in the old testament a man was
[56:11] made righteous
[56:12] by doing righteously or doing what god
[56:16] said to do it really is no different
[56:18] today except by the new birth it's not
[56:21] us doing it's us yielding and it's god
[56:23] fulfilling his word
[56:26] so this this eternal peace this is what
[56:29] this this this piece of god is it's an
[56:32] eternal piece of the soul that brings a
[56:35] son or daughter of god back into full
[56:36] harmony with almighty god it doesn't
[56:39] mean that there aren't times in our
[56:41] spirit and in our flesh where we can
[56:44] experience fears
[56:47] we can have troubling times that can
[56:49] come up to try to trouble us that has
[56:52] nothing to do with the eternal peace of
[56:55] almighty god that is there residing in
[56:58] our life that's in our soul you say what
[57:00] brother say now how can i be out here
[57:02] paul wrote of it we will have fears
[57:04] within and without
[57:06] is that right but you see how paul paul
[57:08] could to speak of where uh you know here
[57:11] we are we're cast out but we're not
[57:13] forsaken
[57:15] see everything is balanced right out
[57:17] we're talking about the circumstances
[57:20] but i'm not alone god is present god is
[57:22] here a god that's over this circumstance
[57:26] let me tell you something god wants you
[57:28] to be his helper but he doesn't want
[57:30] your strength
[57:33] he wants you to be your his helper but
[57:34] he don't want your help
[57:37] he wants us to yield to him and now we
[57:41] become like the glasses on his face
[57:44] we become like the glove on his hand we
[57:47] become like the shoes on his feet we
[57:50] become his hands his legs his feet upon
[57:53] the earth because he is the vine and we
[57:56] are the branches
[57:59] you've been ordained as a channel of god
[58:01] sure circumstances come up sometimes
[58:03] things and listen things take us by
[58:05] surprise but remember within that time
[58:08] this is where the eternal peace of god
[58:10] where you come and you fall right back
[58:12] up on that because that is your grounds
[58:16] of victory it is the victory that will
[58:18] master every circumstance every
[58:21] situation is the peace of almighty god
[58:26] brother samuel i'm a sister you're still
[58:28] a priest in the army of almighty god
[58:32] brother samuel i don't know this much
[58:34] here it doesn't matter what you know is
[58:36] you know god
[58:37] and a life that can yield it can invite
[58:39] child to come on the scene
[58:41] god's not moved by how many quotes we
[58:43] know how many scriptures we know how
[58:46] much we can put it together god is moved
[58:48] when there's a heart that says if i can
[58:50] backtouch the hymn of his garment i know
[58:53] that i shall be made whole yes
[58:56] oh my because it's in him
[58:59] it's in him that our purpose becomes
[59:01] clear
[59:02] abraham recognizes when he meets
[59:04] melchizedek blessed be abram of the most
[59:07] high god
[59:09] abram began abraham receives a
[59:12] revelation that your your origination or
[59:16] origin is not in time it's of the most
[59:20] high god and abraham just so you know it
[59:23] you went down there and you went and
[59:25] there were kings that were whipped but
[59:28] remember your motive and your intent you
[59:30] have followed my voice you've followed
[59:33] my word you left the land of your
[59:35] nativity you've come out and you made a
[59:38] separation now notice oh man i'm gonna
[59:40] preach why it's coming as he had
[59:43] separation there and lot was gone from
[59:45] him he had power as a son of god don't
[59:49] you see where the enemy wants to try to
[59:51] bind our lives is to try to get us to
[59:54] mix up with the world and i'm not
[59:56] talking about going out here i'm talking
[59:58] about even in our attitude sometimes our
[1:00:01] thoughts about things sometimes
[1:00:04] oh god help us yes
[1:00:07] because we've got power as a believer
[1:00:10] when we're separated unto the word of
[1:00:13] almighty god abraham had power
[1:00:16] and lot had no power to withstand the
[1:00:20] present-day conditions
[1:00:22] is that right
[1:00:24] but it was in here melchizedek unfolds
[1:00:27] is unfolding the mystery of abram's life
[1:00:31] so this shows to you and i
[1:00:34] this shows
[1:00:35] that you know an effectual life
[1:00:38] is lived
[1:00:39] when we have
[1:00:40] confidence in what we're doing yes amen
[1:00:44] because we're living out the will of god
[1:00:47] when you know you're in the will of god
[1:00:49] you can have confidence
[1:00:51] you can have things that even that
[1:00:54] i mean let me just you know there's many
[1:00:56] different other testimonies and
[1:00:58] sometimes and you know you can we can
[1:00:59] fellowship on this that at times when
[1:01:01] you know you're in the will of god and
[1:01:03] everything isn't laid out
[1:01:04] i stood behind pulpits and here i am
[1:01:08] i i just have you know little things
[1:01:11] laid before me not a lack of study i'm
[1:01:13] talking about other places when i've
[1:01:14] gone out to minister god what would you
[1:01:16] have me to do or i have just a you know
[1:01:18] a little title a little something wrote
[1:01:20] right here lord
[1:01:22] you know you know the needs of the
[1:01:23] people you know you know what's taking
[1:01:26] place you see just to know that i'm in
[1:01:28] god's will just like you know you're in
[1:01:31] god's will you may not know what's going
[1:01:33] to come next but you know right now i'm
[1:01:35] standing in the will of god
[1:01:39] so whatever comes god's got it
[1:01:42] amen because i'm not alone
[1:01:45] i'm not alone
[1:01:46] you know so when we find this i want you
[1:01:49] to think about this in our lives the way
[1:01:52] has a scripture
[1:01:54] would declare this
[1:01:56] and it would speak there
[1:01:58] on how god
[1:01:59] becoming flesh the condems sending down
[1:02:02] as brother braham says in that stage
[1:02:05] where he met abraham where he was he's
[1:02:07] still condescending and later became
[1:02:10] jesus christ and so here is his
[1:02:12] condescending and notice
[1:02:15] notice now here as paul is writing
[1:02:19] of this same one the same god who became
[1:02:22] us this was a god think about how he met
[1:02:25] abraham he did not meet abraham as a
[1:02:28] judge he met him as the priest of the
[1:02:32] most high god because you and i didn't
[1:02:34] need a judge we were already guilty we
[1:02:38] needed a priest we needed somebody that
[1:02:41] could stand on our behalf and
[1:02:44] melchizedek was god was revealing
[1:02:47] himself there in the form of melchizedek
[1:02:50] is i am the one who's standing on your
[1:02:52] behalf as a matter of fact abraham i've
[1:02:55] been pulling for you from eternity
[1:02:59] oh there were many forces that tried to
[1:03:01] influence you and turn you around from
[1:03:04] leaving your land of nativity but there
[1:03:07] was a greater attraction and a greater
[1:03:09] pull abraham what was that pool that
[1:03:13] pool was the living god coming together
[1:03:16] with a believer
[1:03:20] so here's tans
[1:03:23] the lord jesus and i want you to
[1:03:25] remember
[1:03:26] here he is he rises
[1:03:28] as paul would write it after the
[1:03:31] similitude of melchizedek
[1:03:34] now it wasn't the earthly veil out here
[1:03:36] but god
[1:03:38] god
[1:03:39] created
[1:03:40] that veil that he could come down and
[1:03:42] step into
[1:03:44] just as much as you know it's a very
[1:03:46] it's not a very good example but just as
[1:03:48] much as this is my my jacket this jacket
[1:03:51] is nothing without me
[1:03:53] are you with me
[1:03:55] but a jacket when i put that jacket on
[1:03:57] the jacket the jacket itself that is
[1:04:00] samuel browning's jacket he is clothed
[1:04:02] in that jacket
[1:04:03] and this is how brother brown begins to
[1:04:05] talk about god unfolding himself down
[1:04:07] through these stages
[1:04:09] and revealing all the way through now
[1:04:12] when he become flesh
[1:04:14] and to think he's made the lord jesus
[1:04:16] here is a priest a high priest made
[1:04:19] after the similitude of marquette what
[1:04:21] kind of assemblitude are we talking
[1:04:23] about
[1:04:24] paul writes of it he was made not after
[1:04:27] the law of a carnal commandment but
[1:04:30] after the power of an endless life amen
[1:04:34] are you hearing me
[1:04:35] he wasn't made after a carnal
[1:04:37] commandment
[1:04:39] let me tell you you weren't made a
[1:04:41] christian by a church creed
[1:04:43] you weren't made a believer by recite
[1:04:46] this and do you believe brother rem's a
[1:04:48] prophet and do you believe this and
[1:04:50] recite this you were not made after a
[1:04:52] carnal commandment but because a carnal
[1:04:55] commandment has no power to create
[1:04:59] but only god himself can create and the
[1:05:02] same way that god became flesh in the
[1:05:05] person of jesus christ is the same way
[1:05:08] that god becomes flesh in you as a son
[1:05:11] and daughter of god oh my we were once a
[1:05:14] creature of time but now that the holy
[1:05:17] ghost has come we have been made in that
[1:05:20] same semitude after the power of an
[1:05:23] endless life
[1:05:26] what are we talking about the king of
[1:05:28] righteousness
[1:05:30] the king of peace
[1:05:32] so the new birth
[1:05:33] brings us back to the divine order of
[1:05:35] god
[1:05:38] to have that the power that inherent
[1:05:40] that word is the dunamis the inherent
[1:05:43] power
[1:05:44] that is possessed in our lives
[1:05:46] and i think we could fellowship on this
[1:05:48] i won't dwell on this but i think we
[1:05:50] could fellowship on this point is god
[1:05:52] help me to live and continue to live in
[1:05:54] a place to where that same power that
[1:05:56] picked me up and changed me that that
[1:05:58] same power can flow because all that i
[1:06:00] have need of you packed it within me and
[1:06:02] the holy ghost is there to bring it to
[1:06:04] pass
[1:06:07] he has made us
[1:06:08] the bible says in revelation 1 this the
[1:06:11] prince of the kings of the earth
[1:06:14] he hath washed us
[1:06:16] he hath loosed us he gave of his own
[1:06:18] life
[1:06:21] to wash us
[1:06:22] to lose us
[1:06:23] you see right there at calvary
[1:06:26] brother branham tells us all the way
[1:06:27] through the message clear up through 65
[1:06:30] but even back down in here in the in the
[1:06:32] late 50s in questions and answers
[1:06:34] brother bram says when that death took
[1:06:36] place on calvary he said god reckoned
[1:06:39] you dead at the same time
[1:06:41] you right there you were dead the
[1:06:44] penalty had already been paid because
[1:06:47] you are always a part of god you are
[1:06:51] always a part of the world so the gospel
[1:06:54] is not telling you something that you
[1:06:56] aren't but the gospel is calm and the
[1:06:59] power of god has come to speak to your
[1:07:02] life and let you know you're free you
[1:07:04] can walk free the peace of god belongs
[1:07:07] to you
[1:07:09] everything that you have need of
[1:07:12] it belongs to you because he hath made
[1:07:15] us
[1:07:16] he did not a church not a carnal
[1:07:18] commandment he hath made us
[1:07:21] kings
[1:07:22] and priests
[1:07:24] unto the church no
[1:07:26] unto god
[1:07:29] oh my
[1:07:30] so he's the first
[1:07:32] of many brethren god condescended
[1:07:34] becoming one of us and the same holy
[1:07:37] ghost remember as it descended
[1:07:40] and coming down out of the heavens
[1:07:43] god screaming as he was coming down
[1:07:46] how this is my beloved son and whom i'm
[1:07:50] well pleased to dwell
[1:07:52] it was it took them the devil god to
[1:07:55] identify the sacrifice to john
[1:07:59] so the prophet was resting in the same
[1:08:02] holy spirit that had come to him and
[1:08:05] revealed the word that this is what
[1:08:07] you're to look for and he waited for
[1:08:09] that announcement and here came the dove
[1:08:12] of god
[1:08:13] and what is the dove of god it's the
[1:08:14] holy ghost
[1:08:16] and the dove itself is the symbol of
[1:08:19] peace
[1:08:23] the symbol of peace
[1:08:25] this is why the dove coming down
[1:08:29] upon the lamb
[1:08:31] humility
[1:08:32] will come to humility
[1:08:35] it'll dovetail together
[1:08:37] and i want you to see this it's the same
[1:08:39] thing within our lives but this is where
[1:08:41] satan works is to try to pull back and
[1:08:44] keep
[1:08:45] that coming together
[1:08:47] not just in the new birth but even after
[1:08:49] the new birth is come
[1:08:54] so this is where the notice this
[1:08:57] accompaniment
[1:08:58] that comes
[1:08:59] it's king
[1:09:01] of righteousness and king of peace and i
[1:09:03] want to say this to you those are not
[1:09:05] attributes
[1:09:06] that's who he is
[1:09:09] he is
[1:09:10] righteousness
[1:09:13] he is peace
[1:09:16] this is who
[1:09:18] he is
[1:09:20] now i'll say it like this
[1:09:22] then as as brother branham would say it
[1:09:25] how he was he revealed himself
[1:09:29] in that stage of creation when he came
[1:09:31] to abraham and revealed himself
[1:09:34] as melchizedek in the form of
[1:09:37] melchizedek as priest of the most high
[1:09:39] god and then later became jesus and now
[1:09:43] ascended up on high he's the high priest
[1:09:46] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:09:48] our infirmities he is sitting there
[1:09:50] with the bloody garments on he is there
[1:09:53] the bible says hebrews 9 24 he is there
[1:09:56] to appear for us in the presence of god
[1:09:59] we need that high priest right now
[1:10:03] and i'm not talking about because of a
[1:10:04] sinful life you and i at one time were
[1:10:07] ignorant and out of the way and there
[1:10:09] are things you might have still been
[1:10:10] ignorant in but the high priest is one
[1:10:13] interceding on our behalf he's one that
[1:10:16] even in our mistakes in our failures
[1:10:18] there's one who intercedes on our behalf
[1:10:21] it doesn't matter if you have failed
[1:10:23] five times 50 times he still stands
[1:10:26] there just as
[1:10:28] faithful amen man can't make people
[1:10:31] faithful like this a church can't do
[1:10:33] that but god can
[1:10:35] and god does
[1:10:37] so deceive this of how that he become
[1:10:40] into that place remember
[1:10:42] there will come a time
[1:10:45] there will come a time where the
[1:10:46] sanctuary will become smoky
[1:10:48] there will come a time where as it
[1:10:51] speaks in the book of daniel that him
[1:10:52] that's filthy be filthy still
[1:10:54] right is that right when the rapture of
[1:10:57] the church is gone as it speaks in first
[1:10:59] thessalonians floor
[1:11:01] uh uh or hear the catching away of the
[1:11:04] bride of jesus christ i'm telling you
[1:11:06] there is no blood then upon this earth
[1:11:10] that's why brother graham said people
[1:11:11] will still be coming to altars and
[1:11:13] everything else thinking they're getting
[1:11:15] saved
[1:11:16] why because even right now now listen to
[1:11:18] me we believe in emotion but i'm what
[1:11:21] i'm trying to point to is you see things
[1:11:23] where people sometimes are worked up
[1:11:25] under emotion and then they can get them
[1:11:27] maybe to a commitment or maybe they're
[1:11:29] singing a certain song and my they get
[1:11:31] the feeling a little bit or or whatever
[1:11:33] and they come up but it's not a right
[1:11:35] conviction they're getting them a
[1:11:37] thought of a grandma of an aunt or or
[1:11:39] they're putting a thought of way out
[1:11:41] there and then just take taking it out
[1:11:43] there instead of pointing it out that
[1:11:45] the god who condescended he paid a price
[1:11:48] but that's not it he paid that price so
[1:11:51] he could clean your life up that he
[1:11:53] himself could come and take charge in
[1:11:56] your life with a real relationship
[1:11:59] they don't preach the relationship
[1:12:04] are you with me and melchizedek reveals
[1:12:07] relationship
[1:12:09] blessed be abram of the most high god
[1:12:11] and he brings substance oh my god
[1:12:16] as that will be culminated
[1:12:20] so
[1:12:21] at the change of the body
[1:12:24] when he steps
[1:12:25] and he changes
[1:12:27] from lamb
[1:12:29] to lion
[1:12:32] it's time for rapture
[1:12:35] when he changes his vesture
[1:12:38] our atoms will be changed
[1:12:41] because as his garment is changed so
[1:12:43] ours be changed
[1:12:44] it will match the change that's going on
[1:12:50] see he has everything arranged
[1:12:52] everything's already been prepared
[1:12:55] so but in the meantime
[1:12:58] praise the lord in the meantime
[1:13:01] as he as brother branham could put it
[1:13:03] there
[1:13:04] in in the church ages
[1:13:06] his present office
[1:13:10] is high priest
[1:13:12] he's still interceding until that last
[1:13:16] name
[1:13:17] is splashed beneath the bleach
[1:13:21] and brother brand puts it like this and
[1:13:22] souls in prison has been thoroughly
[1:13:25] redeemed
[1:13:27] with this turtle when the baptism of the
[1:13:29] holy ghost has come to quicken and make
[1:13:32] redemption
[1:13:33] a revelation
[1:13:36] then we go
[1:13:38] so in the meantime
[1:13:39] here we are
[1:13:41] let's go
[1:13:42] matthew 5 9
[1:13:44] blessed
[1:13:46] are the peacemakers
[1:13:50] if he listen
[1:13:52] if you and i we are called blessed are
[1:13:54] the peacemakers for they shall be called
[1:13:56] the children of god we are identified as
[1:13:59] a peacemaker
[1:14:01] but it's not peace like the world gives
[1:14:04] it's the peace of almighty god
[1:14:07] remember melchizedek king of
[1:14:09] righteousness king of peace then if that
[1:14:12] same peace the god of peace has
[1:14:15] transformed our lives then our lives are
[1:14:19] peacemakers
[1:14:22] that's what we are to be called blessed
[1:14:24] are the peacemakers
[1:14:28] now a peacemaker is one
[1:14:30] who's peaceful in character
[1:14:33] and even in motive
[1:14:36] is that right
[1:14:37] now
[1:14:38] we can be very honest here
[1:14:41] we've not always fit that description
[1:14:44] oh i said brother brown brother samuel
[1:14:46] how i thank god for the blood and the
[1:14:47] new birth i'm talking about even after
[1:14:49] the new birth
[1:14:51] right sometimes our motives in the holy
[1:14:53] spirit would check us because of our
[1:14:55] motive
[1:14:57] it wasn't necessarily what something was
[1:14:58] said it's the motive behind it
[1:15:02] is that right
[1:15:03] blessed are the peacemakers now notice
[1:15:06] in second corinthians 13 11
[1:15:09] finally brethren farewell
[1:15:12] be perfect be of good comfort be of one
[1:15:16] mind
[1:15:17] live in peace
[1:15:19] i mean believe this is possible right
[1:15:22] how many believe you're called to it
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:25] i'm going to believe it whether i feel
[1:15:26] like it or not
[1:15:28] i'm going to make a stand on that word
[1:15:30] i'm called to this
[1:15:31] now there's no way that we can can look
[1:15:34] at this in ourselves and say be of one
[1:15:36] mind
[1:15:38] that that that is impossible when it
[1:15:41] comes to merely just us as humans it can
[1:15:43] sometimes it can go for for a period of
[1:15:45] time remember there was such a unity
[1:15:47] down there when they begin to build
[1:15:48] build the tower tower of babel right but
[1:15:51] look what that unity led to
[1:15:53] confusion
[1:15:55] it's a confusion that filled the whole
[1:15:57] earth but yet
[1:15:59] unity itself wielded great power
[1:16:03] but it matters what you're united around
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:08] is that right
[1:16:09] notice the admonition
[1:16:11] live in peace
[1:16:13] and
[1:16:14] the god of love and peace shall be with
[1:16:18] you
[1:16:18] so look at this word peace that's used
[1:16:20] here
[1:16:22] this meaning
[1:16:23] you know
[1:16:24] you have many that are there let me just
[1:16:26] go to the second part of it it means not
[1:16:28] to make peace
[1:16:30] but to cultivate
[1:16:33] or keep
[1:16:34] peace
[1:16:36] harmony
[1:16:37] to be at peace
[1:16:38] live in peace so
[1:16:40] god has entrusted us as peacemakers
[1:16:44] right
[1:16:46] attributes sons and daughters of god
[1:16:49] that have been brought from death unto
[1:16:51] life by the very god of peace
[1:16:54] that our lives we would live in peace
[1:16:59] is that right this is our responsibility
[1:17:02] this is not god's this is our
[1:17:04] responsibility now watch look at this
[1:17:06] condition live in peace
[1:17:08] and the god of love and peace
[1:17:11] shall be with you
[1:17:13] so to live in peace
[1:17:17] then it invites the accompaniment of god
[1:17:20] who is the god of love and peace
[1:17:23] you see it's it's standing
[1:17:26] in that place
[1:17:27] living in peace to where you're going to
[1:17:29] cultivate
[1:17:31] that and you know what the cultivation
[1:17:33] as you'll see here in just a moment
[1:17:34] isn't out here like paul listen i want
[1:17:38] you to do this and do this don't disturb
[1:17:40] my peace i'm trying to cultivate peace
[1:17:42] no no cultivating begins here
[1:17:44] this cultivation's here here
[1:17:47] are you with me
[1:17:48] come on friends if we're sons and
[1:17:50] daughters of god and god god is calling
[1:17:52] us to a place to control the elements we
[1:17:55] got to control these elements first
[1:17:57] right here
[1:17:59] this is what the new birth brings us
[1:18:02] back into the divine order
[1:18:04] under melchizedek
[1:18:06] that we have we don't allow the enemy to
[1:18:09] sell us anything short of that notice as
[1:18:12] a peacemaker that is set forth by the
[1:18:14] indwelling of the peace of god there's
[1:18:16] there is a love for peace as a child of
[1:18:19] god
[1:18:20] amen there's a love for peace
[1:18:23] it's something we we strive for
[1:18:28] even when there's things sometimes it
[1:18:29] has to be maybe sad
[1:18:31] correction
[1:18:33] i can just speak for myself as a pastor
[1:18:35] as a minister i don't love those times
[1:18:38] a matter of fact many of those times i
[1:18:39] dread those times
[1:18:41] if god allows me to know it before a
[1:18:43] service and then after the service is
[1:18:45] over oh
[1:18:47] i i don't you know you
[1:18:48] you only see one part of it but that's
[1:18:50] the same thing with for for you as well
[1:18:54] we we are we are made people to be at
[1:18:57] peace now that doesn't mean going up to
[1:18:58] somebody and says i'm going to tell you
[1:19:00] off i really don't want to do it but i'm
[1:19:01] going to tell you off
[1:19:03] no no we're not talking about the same
[1:19:04] thing
[1:19:06] the intent
[1:19:09] what's the intent behind it see a
[1:19:11] peacemaker is one who has the right
[1:19:14] intentions
[1:19:15] are you hearing me
[1:19:17] remember
[1:19:18] the antichrist spirit daniel revealed
[1:19:21] the spirit of god takes the cover off of
[1:19:23] him and says he will come in by
[1:19:25] flattering you
[1:19:29] is that right
[1:19:31] flatteries what is that that's false
[1:19:33] peace
[1:19:38] so this this is genuine so this is our
[1:19:41] responsibility to cultivate peace in
[1:19:44] order to invite the god of love and
[1:19:46] peace how many want how many want to
[1:19:48] invite more of god i want the god of
[1:19:51] love and peace i want god i want to
[1:19:54] cultivate in such a way that god is able
[1:19:57] to come down i'm not talking about when
[1:19:59] a situation is going my way i'm not
[1:20:01] talking about all when a person is in
[1:20:03] agreement and i'm not talking about that
[1:20:05] but for myself i want the accompaniment
[1:20:09] of the god of love and peace you say why
[1:20:11] would you why would you desire that if
[1:20:13] you have the peace of god in your life
[1:20:15] because we are called to live in peace
[1:20:18] cultivated and sometimes in the midst of
[1:20:21] battle it can get weak but when they
[1:20:24] when my life can be lived in a place
[1:20:27] that will invite
[1:20:29] the god of love and of peace
[1:20:33] you see the one of the greatest tricks
[1:20:35] that the enemy puts on people
[1:20:37] is they go to look for other resources
[1:20:39] of peace
[1:20:42] [Applause]
[1:20:44] and listen there's nothing wrong with
[1:20:46] certain outlets
[1:20:47] but brother and sister let me tell you
[1:20:49] something gardening might be all right
[1:20:52] hunting might be all right fishing might
[1:20:54] be all right
[1:20:55] some of those things that you can do
[1:20:56] maybe little outlets maybe it's just
[1:20:58] going and shooting guns or or something
[1:21:00] like and that can be something that you
[1:21:02] you would like let me say this to you
[1:21:05] that will never ever take the place
[1:21:09] never take the place of cultivating
[1:21:12] peace in your life
[1:21:14] like prayer will
[1:21:17] turning on a message
[1:21:20] and listening to the voice of god oh
[1:21:22] brother samuel i come and hear you read
[1:21:24] quote shame on you you ought to be in
[1:21:26] the message you should be listening to
[1:21:29] we are going to give an account we've
[1:21:31] got it on our phones on our tablets over
[1:21:34] the center i don't understand everything
[1:21:36] like that remember put it on and say god
[1:21:39] open my understanding lord i want my
[1:21:42] life to be a vessel that's open to the
[1:21:45] enrichment because this is not the voice
[1:21:48] of a man these are not william branham's
[1:21:51] thoughts these are the thoughts of
[1:21:53] almighty god
[1:21:57] you would pay a minute to go to the top
[1:22:00] doctor sometimes when your doctor says
[1:22:02] something you say can i get a second
[1:22:05] opinion let me tell you something we
[1:22:07] need a second opinion instead of stop
[1:22:10] taking the devil's opinion or our own
[1:22:12] opinion or our neighbor's opinion we
[1:22:15] need to go to the god of the amen we
[1:22:19] need to go to god and say god what do
[1:22:22] you say amen amen
[1:22:31] cultivate
[1:22:33] by drawing from the fountain
[1:22:36] of his own life
[1:22:39] draw from the god of peace
[1:22:45] cultivate it you know
[1:22:47] cultivate right now
[1:22:49] that's where you actually prepare ground
[1:22:53] for crops
[1:22:54] it's where you prepare
[1:22:56] ground for seed
[1:23:01] you know even
[1:23:04] satan works to try to hinder
[1:23:07] that cultivation right
[1:23:10] let me just step back for a minute here
[1:23:16] god allowed it to be showed in the
[1:23:18] scripture
[1:23:20] a man by the name of elisha was all out
[1:23:22] of sorts
[1:23:25] he was a prophet
[1:23:27] ordained by god to hear from god
[1:23:30] be in contact with god
[1:23:33] but here he was brought into a situation
[1:23:35] are you hearing me
[1:23:37] he was brought into a situation
[1:23:40] that he could look at he could look at
[1:23:42] ahab look at look at them and say you
[1:23:43] know what
[1:23:45] if it wasn't for
[1:23:47] jehoshaphat standing here i won't even
[1:23:49] look at you
[1:23:51] you know why elijah said you ain't a
[1:23:53] believer right right
[1:23:56] not just said all you want you just want
[1:23:58] to take up time
[1:24:01] are you hearing me
[1:24:03] you see sometimes you see what it was
[1:24:05] now here's where elisha he has to take
[1:24:08] authority in that situation
[1:24:12] he's either going to let
[1:24:14] that dominate the situation because
[1:24:16] there's needs are you hearing me there
[1:24:19] were needs there was a jehoshaphat there
[1:24:21] there were needs that were there he
[1:24:22] cannot let that one individual
[1:24:26] affect everything
[1:24:29] so what he does in humility it says go
[1:24:32] get a minstrel
[1:24:33] right right what's he doing cultivating
[1:24:36] peace
[1:24:38] and sometimes you and i are in those
[1:24:40] places because we're still here in this
[1:24:42] humanity
[1:24:44] sometimes we get all twisted up and tore
[1:24:46] up and and everything else and you know
[1:24:48] you sometimes you might feel anxious or
[1:24:50] this or that and
[1:24:52] we say god
[1:24:54] i need a refreshing
[1:24:56] amen
[1:24:57] i need a minstrel
[1:24:59] all right i need to as brother baby said
[1:25:01] put on some good gospel music
[1:25:04] oh no lord i i'm going to put on a
[1:25:06] reading of the bible and that's all good
[1:25:09] you should
[1:25:10] i'm going to put on a message and you
[1:25:12] should there are times that i've done
[1:25:13] that as well but then there's other
[1:25:15] times that i can sense that maybe things
[1:25:17] are so tore up i have nothing to prove
[1:25:21] to the devil that's right true i am a
[1:25:24] son of god
[1:25:25] because god has declared it with his own
[1:25:28] spirit you are a son of god a daughter
[1:25:30] of god because god has declared it
[1:25:32] personally to your life there is not one
[1:25:35] situation that dictates who i
[1:25:38] am remember he brought jesus upon the
[1:25:41] mount if thou be the son of god what do
[1:25:44] you want get him to try to clown for
[1:25:46] himself we don't clown for the devil
[1:25:50] it's not us proving to the devil
[1:25:53] he'll have us chasing here chasing there
[1:25:55] chasing here chasing there chasing here
[1:25:57] chasing there
[1:25:59] no
[1:26:00] elisha invites
[1:26:03] it says bring a menstrual
[1:26:07] i like that brother richie because i can
[1:26:08] testify to that
[1:26:10] you know what he saw he recognized his
[1:26:12] weakness
[1:26:14] he said i need help
[1:26:16] he didn't remove him from being a
[1:26:18] prophet
[1:26:19] he just needed help in that situation
[1:26:23] this is where the cultivating of peace
[1:26:25] sometimes sometimes friends we're aware
[1:26:27] of it
[1:26:28] in our lives you're aware of a time
[1:26:31] but you know what there's a time to say
[1:26:33] something and there's a time to be quiet
[1:26:35] there's a time when we're not even in
[1:26:37] the right place
[1:26:39] right well just gonna it's absolutely
[1:26:41] the truth
[1:26:43] these are this is parts of mature sons
[1:26:45] and daughters of god mature sons and
[1:26:47] daughters of god isn't oh every single
[1:26:48] time i step out there and i speak to the
[1:26:50] mountain and it moves sometimes the
[1:26:52] mountains are out there the mountains in
[1:26:53] here
[1:26:54] this is where the real mountain is this
[1:26:56] is where the real mountain is
[1:26:58] [Music]
[1:27:00] let me let me try to wrap this up here
[1:27:02] this part
[1:27:03] second corinthians 13 11 let me read the
[1:27:05] same verse in the amplified bible
[1:27:07] finally brethren farewell
[1:27:09] rejoice
[1:27:11] be strengthened
[1:27:12] perfected
[1:27:14] completed
[1:27:16] made what you ought to be let me say
[1:27:18] lord i want to be perfected i want to be
[1:27:21] completed i want to be what you want me
[1:27:22] to be i want all of the virtues of jesus
[1:27:26] christ to flow through my life faith
[1:27:28] knowledge patience temperaments i want
[1:27:30] to grow old lord god as a stature and
[1:27:33] the living god
[1:27:35] right
[1:27:39] so i want to be what you what you've
[1:27:41] called me to be
[1:27:42] i want to be that
[1:27:44] be encouraged and consoled and comforted
[1:27:48] be of the same
[1:27:50] agreeable mind
[1:27:52] one
[1:27:54] with another
[1:27:56] live in peace
[1:27:58] and then
[1:28:00] the god of love
[1:28:02] who is the source of affection
[1:28:05] good will
[1:28:07] love and benevolence toward men
[1:28:11] i'm talking about the fountain
[1:28:13] i'm talking about the fountain that's
[1:28:14] open in the house of david
[1:28:16] i'm talking about the fountain live in
[1:28:18] peace remember
[1:28:20] brother bram said what causes the dove
[1:28:21] to take its flight
[1:28:24] is when we start
[1:28:26] getting a little bit like a wolf
[1:28:28] we're still getting huh
[1:28:30] i've got brother bram said even when we
[1:28:32] think
[1:28:33] we've got a right just our thought about
[1:28:35] it entertaining that thought just
[1:28:37] entertaining the thought can cause the
[1:28:39] holy spirit to be grieved
[1:28:41] but samuel a thought let it pass on
[1:28:44] through
[1:28:45] as soon as you catch it for what it is
[1:28:47] bringing in obedience
[1:28:51] bring in obedience remember your source
[1:28:54] of strength comes from the lord
[1:28:57] if you're not feeding on the word you're
[1:28:59] not in prayer like you should be you're
[1:29:02] weak
[1:29:04] and thoughts themselves listen we deal
[1:29:06] with thoughts but you see your source of
[1:29:09] strength
[1:29:10] is from god himself
[1:29:13] that even when you feel like i'm not
[1:29:15] getting anything but you know you're
[1:29:17] doing his will when you're in prayer
[1:29:20] remember prayer isn't just your prayer
[1:29:22] closet the bible said pray without
[1:29:23] ceasing
[1:29:26] praying at all times as paul would write
[1:29:29] and and and getting into the word
[1:29:30] getting into the message listen to the
[1:29:33] message the message should not be a
[1:29:34] foreign thing to you
[1:29:37] so brother samuel i want more of god get
[1:29:39] into the message
[1:29:41] and pray and ask god to reveal himself
[1:29:43] to you don't allow the enemy to try to
[1:29:45] block it out like it's it's some great
[1:29:47] algebraic theory it's not algebraic
[1:29:50] theory it's the sovereignty of god who
[1:29:52] comes and reveals his word
[1:29:56] that's what it is and isn't the mind of
[1:29:58] a pastor it isn't the mind of a prophet
[1:30:00] this is not the mind of a man god let
[1:30:03] you and i see it he didn't even complete
[1:30:06] seventh grade
[1:30:09] are you hearing me
[1:30:10] god let you and i see these things these
[1:30:13] are things that did not come from the
[1:30:15] mind of man it's from the mind of
[1:30:18] god what should i do i'd say let's take
[1:30:22] of this bread and wine
[1:30:23] i'd say let's take of this communion i'd
[1:30:26] say taking that communion in and
[1:30:29] cultivating peace in our lives
[1:30:33] is who this melchizedek is
[1:30:36] the god of love
[1:30:38] live in peace and then the god of love
[1:30:40] who is the source of affection good will
[1:30:43] love and benevolence toward men and the
[1:30:45] author and promoter of peace will be
[1:30:48] with you
[1:30:50] no wonder paul could write
[1:30:52] in ephesians 6 15
[1:30:55] and your feet
[1:30:58] part of our armor
[1:31:00] brother richie part of the armor is
[1:31:01] shodding our feet with the
[1:31:03] preparation
[1:31:05] of the gospel
[1:31:07] of peace
[1:31:09] because remember we we are as was
[1:31:12] prophetically described in isaiah
[1:31:15] publishing peace
[1:31:17] and that peace is
[1:31:19] our god
[1:31:20] reigns
[1:31:22] but no matter what is taking place in
[1:31:25] the home our god
[1:31:28] reigns our god is supreme our god
[1:31:32] reigns no matter what takes place our
[1:31:35] god
[1:31:36] reigns
[1:31:37] because our feet are shod
[1:31:40] with the preparation of the gospel of
[1:31:41] peace
[1:31:43] let me close on this verse mark chapter
[1:31:45] 9 verse 50.
[1:31:47] salt
[1:31:48] is good
[1:31:50] but if the salt have lost
[1:31:53] his saltiness
[1:31:55] wherewith
[1:31:57] will you season it
[1:31:59] have salt
[1:32:00] in yourselves
[1:32:03] and have peace
[1:32:04] one
[1:32:06] with another
[1:32:08] so salt we know what salt is
[1:32:11] but yet how we think of it
[1:32:15] salt many times we think of table salt
[1:32:16] we think of all kinds of salt and we
[1:32:19] look at this of where that this
[1:32:20] scripture would write
[1:32:22] and has in the other parts of the gospel
[1:32:24] how could salt lose its savor
[1:32:29] salt in its purest form salt
[1:32:32] not like what we've got as table not
[1:32:34] necessarily table salt and these other
[1:32:35] things but salt in its purest form i
[1:32:38] think it's sodium chloride
[1:32:40] as that comes together
[1:32:42] it will never
[1:32:44] corrupt
[1:32:45] on its own
[1:32:48] are you hearing me
[1:32:49] salt will never corrupt on its own but
[1:32:54] there's two things
[1:32:55] that can impact
[1:32:57] salt
[1:33:00] and that's conditions
[1:33:02] where things themselves can come about
[1:33:04] and dilute it
[1:33:06] and water it down
[1:33:10] or
[1:33:11] they can shoot an electrical charge into
[1:33:13] it
[1:33:14] that tries to
[1:33:15] bring about a chemical change to try to
[1:33:17] fragment that electron i i'm not
[1:33:19] interested in trying to understand all
[1:33:20] that but i took those two things and
[1:33:22] looking at it
[1:33:23] that's conditions conditions that would
[1:33:26] try to come about
[1:33:29] or additives
[1:33:30] when things is added to salt
[1:33:33] and it's called salt but if it's got an
[1:33:36] additive in it it has an expiration date
[1:33:38] because the additive not because of the
[1:33:41] salt
[1:33:42] the additive is what makes it
[1:33:44] non-effectual
[1:33:47] what is it what is the salt the salt of
[1:33:49] god is the holy ghost
[1:33:53] we're to have salt in our lives and be
[1:33:55] at peace among ourselves
[1:33:58] see this is where as brother branham
[1:33:59] would take care of how you know he said
[1:34:01] you find things he said were testimonies
[1:34:03] and lives and how our lives as believers
[1:34:06] let me just read you a few of these
[1:34:07] statements here or at least refer to
[1:34:09] them of how that our lives and his and
[1:34:12] in our very own lives there's got to be
[1:34:14] a contact no they'll take salt and
[1:34:16] they'll put it on meat and it'll
[1:34:17] preserve that meat now obviously you
[1:34:19] know you've seen it it's not just a
[1:34:20] sprinkling of salt you got to cover that
[1:34:22] thing with salt is that right
[1:34:25] but it's got to be a salt
[1:34:27] that isn't diluted
[1:34:29] or there's not been a chemical change a
[1:34:32] salt that has withstood the conditions
[1:34:36] that has withstood things from around it
[1:34:38] because when it makes contact it's the
[1:34:42] salt that will save or savor and that's
[1:34:45] why brother branham would take this
[1:34:46] scripture and run it through the message
[1:34:49] over and over and express of how that
[1:34:52] our lives are our character should be so
[1:34:56] salty
[1:34:57] anybody anything salty
[1:35:00] i know some of you thinking you have
[1:35:02] something sweet and they need something
[1:35:03] salty you're like i need something sweet
[1:35:05] did you some street well i need
[1:35:07] something salty
[1:35:09] vicious cycle
[1:35:12] speaking from experience
[1:35:16] but what happens when something's salty
[1:35:19] uh you've been to restaurants i've been
[1:35:21] to restaurants
[1:35:22] anymore you get thirsty
[1:35:24] i've had certain things from when i was
[1:35:26] a teenager 13 14 years old i'd get woke
[1:35:29] up in the middle of the night with
[1:35:30] thirst and i began to realize there's
[1:35:31] certain places
[1:35:33] that i i didn't want to eat and if i did
[1:35:35] eat there i made sure i started drinking
[1:35:37] a lot of water
[1:35:39] and ate it earlier in the day so i could
[1:35:41] try to get all that quenched down i
[1:35:42] won't call off the names of those places
[1:35:47] sometimes you get packets of that dark
[1:35:49] colored sauce and put it over the nice
[1:35:51] rice and
[1:35:52] you're gonna pay for it
[1:35:54] high and sodium right what happens it
[1:35:57] comes to a certain time you find
[1:35:58] yourself you think goodness man i don't
[1:36:00] know why i'm so thirsty tonight
[1:36:04] boy i'm so thirsty you put it down i
[1:36:06] mean you're walking around

[1:36:18] that's the same way with the salt
[1:36:21] of god
[1:36:22] in our lives
[1:36:24] it'll cultivate peace

[1:37:06] life that's it right there
[1:37:09] it's a salty

[1:37:18] like him
[1:37:20] he said he well you know as he goes on
[1:37:22] he says that's the way you make the
[1:37:24] world
[1:37:25] or draw from a draw he said the way they
[1:37:28] get thirsty
[1:37:30] is be salty
[1:37:31] is to act like that your testimony
[1:37:34] brother bram says oh there goes a woman

[1:37:52] me because every one of us tonight if we
[1:37:54] look at that tonight thing fussy brother
[1:37:56] samuel there's some times i've been
[1:37:57] fussy as a matter of fact i was kind of
[1:37:59] fussy in the tent before i came tonight
[1:38:01] god came to abraham and sarah's tent and
[1:38:03] they just had had a fuss that morning
[1:38:06] what did brother ram tell us is anything
[1:38:07] too hard for the lord he said well it
[1:38:09] was was satan was trying to block the
[1:38:12] oncoming visitation

[1:38:42] this is powerful we'll contact others
[1:38:45] not necessarily our flesh
[1:38:47] but our spirits
[1:38:49] why because who is seated
[1:38:51] enthroned in our spirit the lord jesus
[1:38:56] the the god of peace till our spirits
[1:38:59] will contact others and make them crave
[1:39:02] to be the people and live the life that

[1:39:18] this and i say god
[1:39:21] let my life let me live
[1:39:24] continually realizing the responsibility
[1:39:27] that i have
[1:39:29] i believe we realize it but i think
[1:39:31] sometimes we we can get so caught up and
[1:39:33] we can look at things but to realize the
[1:39:35] responsibility we have to live in peace
[1:39:38] and living in peace it invites god
[1:39:42] it invites god the god of love the god
[1:39:44] of peace to come on the scene
[1:39:47] so that salt we we want our lives to be
[1:39:51] salty
[1:39:52] our lives too
[1:39:54] but i don't want i don't want to be
[1:39:55] affected by the conditions
[1:40:00] listen there's a lot of things
[1:40:03] where people have become you you get to
[1:40:05] looking at the wrong things entertaining
[1:40:07] the wrong things listen sometimes you
[1:40:08] get around the wrong people
[1:40:10] right
[1:40:11] and you think oh
[1:40:13] i'm a believer
[1:40:15] they're not going to permeate my shield
[1:40:17] i'm sealed by the day of redemption oh
[1:40:19] really
[1:40:21] nobody's we're not we're not talking
[1:40:22] about the seal on your soul but we're
[1:40:24] talking about even that of your spirit
[1:40:30] you hang on you hang around critical
[1:40:32] people you become critical
[1:40:36] is that right see knows what he's doing
[1:40:38] what's the whole objective to try to
[1:40:40] hinder the working of god oh my
[1:40:43] let's pray
[1:40:46] father
[1:40:48] how we lord we stand in need
[1:40:51] of you once again this evening
[1:40:54] lord jesus
[1:40:56] this is the very prayer within our lives
[1:40:59] having salt in ourselves
[1:41:02] and being at peace
[1:41:05] among ourselves lord
[1:41:08] i believe lord as paul when he would
[1:41:10] write that where we've been preaching
[1:41:11] from that charity does not behave itself
[1:41:16] unseemly
[1:41:18] lord we realize that every
[1:41:21] behavior every action things that come
[1:41:23] out
[1:41:24] it starts inwardly
[1:41:26] sometimes lord thoughts being
[1:41:28] entertained things lord being built up
[1:41:30] over time
[1:41:31] and not really taking it to you
[1:41:35] to really lord
[1:41:37] consider you i think of how that paul
[1:41:39] would write this
[1:41:41] consider him
[1:41:43] i wonder lord
[1:41:45] we could tell everybody else our
[1:41:47] problems we could go to this one and
[1:41:49] complain
[1:41:50] we could go to this one and complain we
[1:41:52] could talk about this or that or maybe
[1:41:54] lord it's a situation lord that
[1:41:57] the healing lord in the body
[1:42:01] maybe lord it's for a life right here
[1:42:03] tonight that's in need of a full
[1:42:04] deliverance
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:07] but lord
[1:42:08] regardless of what the need is
[1:42:11] may we take that counsel consider
[1:42:16] him
[1:42:17] may we consider you lord god
[1:42:20] who's in our midst
[1:42:23] consider you lord god
[1:42:26] and that our lives would be cultivated
[1:42:30] cultivated
[1:42:31] [Music]
[1:42:34] lord jesus
[1:42:35] no wonder satan battles
[1:42:38] wanting to try to take lord and put all
[1:42:40] sorts of things lord in front of prayer
[1:42:43] having time lord with you and getting
[1:42:46] our lives so
[1:42:48] cluttered up lord sometimes it's not
[1:42:50] cluttered up necessarily with things
[1:42:52] that's sinful or evil
[1:42:56] but lord it's just things that it gets
[1:42:58] in the way
[1:43:01] and satan's desires to try to take from
[1:43:03] us
[1:43:05] that contact with that inner man where
[1:43:07] we're living
[1:43:09] with the peace of god
[1:43:11] flowing
[1:43:12] through our lives
[1:43:14] lord every one of us here is children of
[1:43:16] god
[1:43:17] [Music]
[1:43:18] there's times lord god where a thought
[1:43:20] could come into our imagination
[1:43:22] and paul tells us
[1:43:24] you got to cast that imagination down
[1:43:27] but lord
[1:43:29] no matter what it is
[1:43:31] oh how we know lord god what strength
[1:43:34] comes lord god from you
[1:43:36] where the peace of god just flows lord
[1:43:39] into that gate of imagination from out
[1:43:41] of the soul and would just permeate into
[1:43:44] that court that's out there lord god
[1:43:47] it would affect lord take over the
[1:43:49] reasoning
[1:43:50] take over lord god that gate of
[1:43:53] affection that's out there in the spirit
[1:43:56] to where that that love part well it
[1:43:58] might want to pull back
[1:43:59] this one did me wrong or this one said
[1:44:01] this or this but the peace of god the
[1:44:04] love of god
[1:44:05] we could just say lord
[1:44:07] flow through me lord
[1:44:09] flow through me
[1:44:11] the peace of god
[1:44:12] would flow
[1:44:14] to those gates or god
[1:44:17] help us lord tonight
[1:44:21] forgive us lord for living beneath our
[1:44:23] privileges
[1:44:25] forgive us lord in the times that we've
[1:44:27] looked and here we are we're looking and
[1:44:29] saying god i need peace god i need peace
[1:44:32] and yet lord god you've provided right
[1:44:35] for us lord god
[1:44:37] where our lives can be cultivated in
[1:44:40] peace
[1:44:41] there's a source there's a fountain
[1:44:44] and that fountain is you lord god
[1:44:48] lord you said you never leave us nor
[1:44:50] forsake us
[1:44:51] but you be with us even in us to the end
[1:44:53] of the world
[1:44:55] may we draw
[1:44:57] from the god of peace
[1:44:59] the same god
[1:45:00] who changed our life raised us up and
[1:45:03] made new creatures out of us lord
[1:45:06] may we draw from that same
[1:45:09] source
[1:45:12] for our homes
[1:45:14] for our everyday life
[1:45:18] lord god
[1:45:21] if i had a choice
[1:45:24] that you would give me a choice and say
[1:45:27] samuel
[1:45:28] would you want to be known as a
[1:45:30] peacemaker or
[1:45:32] would you rather
[1:45:34] to be known as a preacher
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:39] or as
[1:45:40] one who lays hands on the sick
[1:45:43] and i've come down
[1:45:45] and i've responded to their faith
[1:45:48] and they've been made whole
[1:45:50] or one who would
[1:45:52] speak in other tongues and prophesy and
[1:45:54] many other different things would you
[1:45:56] want all of that or one of those
[1:45:58] or would you rather be known
[1:46:02] as a peacemaker
[1:46:04] lord
[1:46:05] i don't need to pray about that
[1:46:07] i want to be known
[1:46:09] i want my life to be known as a
[1:46:12] peacemaker
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:17] lord jesus knowing that many times in
[1:46:20] our lives
[1:46:21] sometimes the lord to make peace
[1:46:24] sometimes we have to act dumb
[1:46:27] lord to hold things together sometimes
[1:46:30] sometimes the lord it requires
[1:46:32] taking blame
[1:46:34] it requires
[1:46:36] in order to hold things together
[1:46:39] in unity
[1:46:41] that's just not myself lord as a pastor
[1:46:44] that's as a husband
[1:46:46] that's as a father that's as a brother
[1:46:50] all within the economy of god
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:46:53] but help us lord
[1:46:56] help us lord to realize
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:01] because in order to make peace
[1:47:04] this peace that we've received
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:08] became me
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:11] that i might become you
[1:47:13] by grace
[1:47:15] the bible says you opened not your mouth
[1:47:19] neither was there any
[1:47:20] guile found therein
[1:47:23] help us lord
[1:47:27] i do not believe lord god that this is
[1:47:29] attainable within my own humanity nor in
[1:47:32] the humanity of any of the other of
[1:47:33] these people
[1:47:36] but i do believe lord god that it is
[1:47:38] [Music]
[1:47:40] attainable
[1:47:41] in the dna
[1:47:43] of a son and daughter of god
[1:47:45] i do believe that that strain lays
[1:47:48] within this tree of life
[1:47:52] that i've been brought into lord
[1:47:55] but you'll never overpower me
[1:47:59] you'll never say samuel get out of my
[1:48:00] way i'm gonna go make peace no

[1:48:52] nonsense
[1:48:54] help us lord
[1:48:57] to realize
[1:48:59] that's only a trap of the enemy
[1:49:03] to hinder
[1:49:04] the peace of god
[1:49:06] from moving in our life
[1:49:09] because it might be one of those people
[1:49:11] it might be somebody that that i would
[1:49:13] meet in the next moment
[1:49:15] that they need
[1:49:17] a visitation
[1:49:18] of the peace
[1:49:20] of god in their life
[1:49:23] i want to be a channel
[1:49:25] i want to be an instrument

[1:49:51] and continue lord to eat
[1:49:53] and eat
[1:49:54] and eat and eat
[1:49:58] as your prophet would tell us lord
[1:50:01] he said you must feed
[1:50:03] your experience
[1:50:06] the holy ghost he said does not feed on
[1:50:08] emotion
[1:50:09] it feeds
[1:50:10] on the word of god
[1:50:12] and if you don't feed it
[1:50:14] it'll die
[1:50:16] the lord that can that can pertain to no
[1:50:18] matter where a person is at in their
[1:50:20] walk with you but if that person has
[1:50:22] ever been sealed by the spirit of god
[1:50:25] they don't lose the holy ghost because
[1:50:26] the holy ghost cannot die
[1:50:30] but lord it's where our lives are not as

[1:51:07] so that my senses might be exercised to
[1:51:10] discern good from evil
[1:51:13] feasting on it doesn't mean that i've
[1:51:15] got to sit there in front of it and my
[1:51:16] hands are folded and i'm setting up

[1:53:21] the
[1:53:23] way that he wants me
[1:53:26] to live
[1:53:28] that i want to give

[1:54:07] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:54:10] thank you lord god
[1:54:13] thank you for your mercy lord jesus
[1:54:19] you know i just think of how brother
[1:54:21] branham when he
[1:54:23] preached that message in images of
[1:54:24] christ
[1:54:26] brother branham said it like this he
[1:54:27] said as this church
[1:54:29] is having a revival
[1:54:32] you know it was a special time they were
[1:54:33] getting ready to head into special
[1:54:35] meetings special services and brother
[1:54:37] ramsey referring to that oncoming time
[1:54:39] there at the tabernacle and he said
[1:54:41] while this church is having a revival
[1:54:44] i want a personal revival
[1:54:47] and he said what it is he said i want
[1:54:50] more of the holy ghost
[1:54:53] to take over more
[1:54:55] of william branham
[1:54:57] he said i don't care what plane i've got
[1:54:58] to come on to have it i want more of the
[1:55:01] holy ghost and he makes his statement he
[1:55:04] said i want more of the holy ghost to
[1:55:06] make me more
[1:55:07] of a servant
[1:55:09] like he was
[1:55:13] because the holy ghost is power
[1:55:16] for service
[1:55:19] this is our desire
[1:55:21] sometimes the service that we're called
[1:55:23] to do
[1:55:24] there's a lot of things that if god said
[1:55:27] can anybody go with anybody go out here
[1:55:29] tonight and on the end of the the the
[1:55:31] boat ramp there's going to be people out
[1:55:33] there and i need you to walk on the
[1:55:34] water
[1:55:35] i'm sure tonight we say lord you know i
[1:55:38] i'd be mourning
[1:55:39] i'd do that lord no problem but then
[1:55:42] what if one of the lord said you know
[1:55:43] what
[1:55:44] i need someone
[1:55:47] that's able
[1:55:48] to express
[1:55:51] love
[1:55:53] i'm gonna have somebody say something
[1:55:55] against you i'm gonna have this or my
[1:55:56] dad but i need someone who who would
[1:55:58] like to have
[1:55:59] and and let that be a testimony and let
[1:56:01] the holy ghost
[1:56:03] operate that service through you
[1:56:05] well lord i
[1:56:07] i
[1:56:08] i walk on water
[1:56:09] no no no
[1:56:11] see we all would want that but those are
[1:56:14] those those times
[1:56:17] those are
[1:56:19] the times that i don't want to say are
[1:56:21] few and far and in between
[1:56:23] but you see the power for service if
[1:56:25] that's all that our life was as
[1:56:27] believers walking on waters miracles
[1:56:29] after a miracle as i heard one person
[1:56:32] say if it was every time we prayed it
[1:56:34] was a miracle it'd no longer be called
[1:56:36] miracles
[1:56:38] but that's the holy ghost is power for
[1:56:41] service it shows itself
[1:56:45] when it comes time
[1:56:47] when there's disagreement
[1:56:49] when there's disunity
[1:56:51] this is where it shows
[1:56:55] when when peter writes
[1:56:57] of those seven virtues the statue of a
[1:56:59] perfect man he's not writing about oh
[1:57:02] you get all these things and you set
[1:57:03] back they're in you
[1:57:05] they're all ready it's like
[1:57:07] inside of this bible is packed every
[1:57:10] promise inside of every seed of god is
[1:57:12] already packed every one of those
[1:57:14] virtues and the same god who packed it
[1:57:16] in you is the same holy ghost that opens
[1:57:20] and unpacks it
[1:57:22] as it's needed
[1:57:24] when you need virtue when you need
[1:57:26] patience when you need temperance
[1:57:28] [Music]
[1:57:31] that's what the holy ghost does
[1:57:33] and what does it do being that of a
[1:57:35] pyramid it reflects that city that we
[1:57:37] are of
[1:57:38] it reflects that city
[1:57:41] oh my this that's my desire
[1:57:44] that's my desire
[1:57:46] that's your desire tonight
