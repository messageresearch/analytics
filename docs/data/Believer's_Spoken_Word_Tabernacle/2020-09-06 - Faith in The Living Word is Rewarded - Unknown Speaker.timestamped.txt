[38:11] prayer
[38:12] for the service the reason i haven't
[38:14] even on the thursday nights i haven't
[38:16] when we've had somebody in even though
[38:18] i've known like brother andrew and
[38:20] brother wayne i
[38:22] you know knew that well in advance
[38:24] because i've not made it public
[38:26] even with these meetings i've not made
[38:28] it public so that
[38:30] just to open it up to everybody
[38:33] because i think and that's pretty much
[38:35] with every assembly right now you know
[38:37] it's
[38:38] we've only got so much space and to try
[38:41] to
[38:41] position people around and now some of
[38:44] you that's come and i know some of you
[38:46] have family that come
[38:47] and i want to understand don't you
[38:48] understand this some of you have a
[38:50] family or you have a friend or somebody
[38:52] that comes and visits you
[38:53] you're able to uh you know you you know
[38:57] uh well if they're coming with you or
[39:00] something you're able to see all of that

[39:05] cautionary and that's what i've tried to
[39:06] do i've tried to make sure we can still
[39:08] remain
[39:09] spaced apart with everything because i
[39:11] just tell you right now
[39:12] this virus is not a conspiracy
[39:17] i didn't get married many man but that
[39:18] ain't i'm not preaching right now

[39:50] um that they're actually working in a
[39:53] coveted unit
[39:54] right now and so they don't come here
[39:57] during this time because they just would
[40:00] not want to
[40:01] risk anything of a transmission however
[40:04] you know i really appreciate that and
[40:07] appreciate each and every one and
[40:09] you know there'll come a time my
[40:12] man we won't even have to bring talk
[40:13] about this or commend this but i'd say

[40:30] just things that i just say that and you
[40:33] forgive me if i'm not
[40:34] politically correct because but i ain't
[40:36] trying to be
[40:37] sometimes you have to say it's so simple
[40:39] but um we just want to try to do that

[41:19] browning we need to hear from jesus
[41:22] he's the one that can help us
[41:25] heavenly father lord
[41:29] we've come here this morning with
[41:33] a desire that's to hear from you
[41:38] but lord you're such a gentleman
[41:42] i always think about lord how brother
[41:43] john lafontaine would put it over the
[41:45] years he said
[41:47] you're such a gentleman that you give us
[41:49] the
[41:50] first opportunity to come in here and to
[41:53] worship you
[41:55] and to make you feel welcome lord
[41:59] there's just no doubt about it when i
[42:00] was sitting back there and
[42:02] in these services lord oh god
[42:08] i just think lord many could just drive
[42:10] right by this building
[42:12] they could drive right by it to them
[42:15] it's just another building
[42:18] god this is a place you've given us to
[42:20] meet with you
[42:22] this is a place got a soul-saving
[42:24] station
[42:26] it's a lighthouse lord not because of
[42:30] the bricks or the mortar or the roof or
[42:32] the carpet or the pews
[42:34] it's because of you lord
[42:37] and father you said if i be lifted up
[42:40] i'll draw
[42:41] men unto me dear god that's the greatest
[42:44] desire that we have in our lives
[42:46] is that you would be exalted we don't
[42:49] want our will
[42:50] exalted we want you to be exalted
[42:53] so lord we just we want to say thank you
[42:55] i i believe god is a congregation we can
[42:58] have joined together and

[46:00] christ amen amen god bless you
[46:05] um i want you to if you turn with me i
[46:09] want to go back into the book of
[46:10] jeremiah
[46:13] and um
[46:19] thank you musicians i appreciate that
[46:30] i didn't tell you where
[46:34] jeremiah 38 verse 7. i'm going to go
[46:37] back and read this before i go forward
[46:40] here this morning just so that everyone
[46:42] with us and those that have been
[46:45] here were able to come back into this
[46:47] this time remember
[46:49] this this time that we're reading about
[46:51] in jeremiah
[46:54] is where uh god it's in the final
[46:57] moments
[46:58] before um israel is going to be carried
[47:02] away
[47:02] exile there's already been um
[47:05] daniel and others have already been
[47:07] taken to babylon
[47:10] jehoiakim one of the other kings right
[47:13] before
[47:14] zedekiah they've already been taken
[47:16] they're down in babylon right now
[47:18] and these are the last here in the
[47:21] closing out if we can
[47:23] see it in this way remember israel had a
[47:26] church ages as well
[47:28] they went through a dark time with that
[47:30] time of ahab so this is a closing out
[47:32] and if we can look at in this way this
[47:34] what we're reading about
[47:36] is actually would be like the lady will
[47:38] see an age
[47:39] to that of israel it's a closing out
[47:42] it's a time to
[47:44] really be sealed away with god it's a
[47:46] time to let god be your refuge because
[47:48] judgment and the wrath of god is certain
[47:52] but i'm so thankful that if as just as
[47:54] that is certain i'm grateful that we can
[47:56] find a certainty
[47:57] in christ under the blood a place that
[48:00] we can rest
[48:01] and we've got a certainty just just to
[48:04] know it's a certainty it's not something
[48:05] we can explain it's just
[48:07] it's a certainty from within our soul
[48:10] amen jeremiah 38 7 now when
[48:13] abed elect the ethiopian once you notice
[48:16] this man's not a jew
[48:18] he's a gentile when abed malek the
[48:21] ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was
[48:24] in the king's house
[48:25] heard that they had put jeremiah in the
[48:28] dungeon
[48:29] the king then sitting in the cave in the
[48:32] gate of benjamin
[48:33] abedmelik went forth out of the king's
[48:35] house and spake to the king
[48:37] saying my lord the king
[48:40] these men have done evil in all that
[48:43] they have
[48:44] done to jeremiah the prophet whom they
[48:46] have cast
[48:47] into the judgment into into the dungeon
[48:51] and he is like to die for hunger in the
[48:54] place where he is
[48:55] for there is no more bread in the city
[48:59] then the king commanded ibm elect the
[49:02] ethiopians saying
[49:04] take from fence thirty men with thee and
[49:07] take up jeremiah the prophet out of the
[49:08] dungeon
[49:09] before he died so i bet milleck took the
[49:13] men with him
[49:14] and went into the house of the king
[49:16] under the treasury
[49:17] and took fence old cast clots
[49:21] and old rotten rags and let them down by
[49:24] cords into the dungeon
[49:26] to jeremiah remember as we looked at
[49:28] that a few weeks ago
[49:30] you see the care not only did jeremiah
[49:32] need to be raised up
[49:34] he need to be brought out of the dungeon
[49:36] while the princes the princes
[49:38] were the ones that said this man speaks
[49:40] a treasonous message
[49:42] cast him into the dungeon so while some
[49:45] were trying to tear
[49:46] down the message there were others who
[49:49] said
[49:50] this is the message of god and they
[49:52] wanted to lift that message up
[49:54] amen they recognize this is the answer
[49:56] against judgment
[49:58] and abandoned a gentile caught that
[50:02] so he says put old clots old rags i
[50:05] i'm glad it did i'm just how the spirit
[50:08] of god just brought that to us a few
[50:09] weeks ago
[50:10] it wasn't new rags it wasn't
[50:13] beautiful rags sometimes we think that
[50:16] god's got to dwell in beauty
[50:18] but real beauty is character
[50:22] and so it takes lives that the rest
[50:26] nobody would want but god takes old rags
[50:29] old clot
[50:30] you and me lives that can be let down
[50:34] and as they're let down oh it comes up
[50:36] and
[50:37] how they were instructed jeremiah put
[50:39] this underneath you know so that the
[50:40] cord that you're pulled up by doesn't
[50:42] harm you i don't want anything of this
[50:44] word
[50:45] to be taken away i want everything of
[50:49] this word
[50:50] to be fully empowered in my life amen
[50:55] oh my what carefulness and so
[50:58] at bedme like the ethiopian verse 12
[51:00] said unto jeremiah put now these old
[51:03] cast clots and rotten rags under thine
[51:05] armholes under the cords
[51:07] and jeremiah did so so they drew up
[51:09] jeremiah with cords and took him out of
[51:11] the dungeon
[51:12] and jeremiah remained in the court of
[51:14] the prison
[51:16] can you turn with me over to now
[51:18] jeremiah 39
[51:19] verse 15. now
[51:23] what we're going to read about is the
[51:26] same abedmalek
[51:28] he took notice he had a there was
[51:31] something that what had pressed on him
[51:33] of the word that he knew jeremiah is
[51:37] god's prophet
[51:38] now zedekiah says jeremiah the prophet
[51:40] but it didn't have the same kind of
[51:42] impact
[51:44] zedekiah we've been looking at he didn't
[51:46] have the same he did not have a
[51:48] revelation
[51:49] that this is god's spokesman this is the
[51:51] mercy of god to us
[51:53] but abimelech had that and abhamalik
[51:56] made it personal now the word of the
[51:59] lord came
[52:00] unto jeremiah while he was shut up in
[52:02] the court of the prison saying
[52:04] go and speak to abed molech the
[52:07] ethiopian
[52:08] so now the word's going to speak to him
[52:10] personally
[52:11] saying thus saith the lord of hosts the
[52:14] god of israel
[52:15] behold i will bring my words upon this
[52:18] city for evil and not for good
[52:20] and they shall be accomplished in that
[52:23] day
[52:23] before thee but i will deliver thee
[52:28] in that day saith the lord and thou
[52:31] shalt
[52:32] not be given into the hand of the men
[52:34] whom thou art afraid
[52:36] for i will surely deliver thee and thou
[52:39] shalt not fall by the sword but thy life
[52:42] shall be for i pray unto thee
[52:44] because thou has put thy trust in me
[52:47] saith the lord
[52:51] amen isn't that wonderful amen
[52:55] let's let's just look at this thought
[52:57] here this morning
[52:58] at least to start into faith in the
[53:01] living word
[53:02] is rewarded faith in the living word is
[53:05] reward may god bless you bless the word
[53:06] as you're being seated
[53:12] so you know i look at this here and
[53:16] it's just um something as we've been
[53:18] looking at it we
[53:20] took for you know unbeknownst to me i
[53:24] was just
[53:24] you know this is where i was so caught
[53:26] up but the lord had other plans
[53:28] for the past two weeks and and then how
[53:31] god would all unfold it you never use
[53:33] you see a thought but you don't know how
[53:35] that it's all going to be unfolded
[53:37] you something inspiration is there but
[53:40] nonetheless throughout the past few
[53:42] weeks we even seen
[53:43] what a contrast was taking place uh
[53:47] during this time you had princes of
[53:49] judah
[53:50] who they themselves mile was a prophet
[53:54] zara zedekiah knew jeremiah was a
[53:57] prophet
[53:58] um the rest of the people they knew
[54:01] about jeremiah being a prophet
[54:05] and even when you really begin to look
[54:07] at and i can't really move into this
[54:08] even the babylonians knew jeremiah was a
[54:11] prophet
[54:13] and to see that within it we've seen how
[54:17] that zedekiah was so concerned
[54:20] with himself what if i do this what if i
[54:22] give in what if i
[54:24] he was so concerned about losing what
[54:26] his prestige was he
[54:28] he had a greater value on his prestige
[54:30] as king
[54:31] than he did on surrendering to the word
[54:34] of the lord
[54:35] you know there's things that that can be
[54:37] about your life that
[54:38] it seem pretty value it might be
[54:40] something that a person values but
[54:42] when you really get to consider it what
[54:45] what is it and
[54:46] how does it pack stack up
[54:49] compared to that of eternal life and i'm
[54:51] not just talking when we say eternal
[54:53] life
[54:54] i'm not just talking about well you know
[54:57] when i pass from this life you know i
[55:00] live on that's
[55:01] that that to me is only a smidget of it
[55:05] eternal life is where you receive the
[55:08] life
[55:09] that you should have had in the
[55:11] beginning
[55:13] the reality is you're not even living
[55:16] until you've received the holy ghost
[55:20] that's real reality it's not just well
[55:22] you know
[55:23] um uh well i just you know need to make
[55:27] preparations for you know for death it's
[55:29] it's so much deeper than that i
[55:31] i i think you know thank god for every
[55:34] life that even
[55:35] in sometimes in their dying beds i've
[55:37] been right there where they can't even
[55:38] respond and
[55:39] i come in and talk to them and ask them
[55:42] to squeeze my hand if they can hear me
[55:44] because you know one of the last senses
[55:45] that'll go
[55:46] and and i hear that and i look at that
[55:50] and i think you know how satan's
[55:52] objective is to keep a life
[55:54] from really surrendering and then it
[55:56] gets right down to that place and you
[55:58] might say well brother samuel at least
[56:00] they gave their life to the lord that's
[56:02] that that's true at least they
[56:04] surrendered their life to the lord
[56:05] i'm grateful that at least they're not
[56:07] going to be going to hell
[56:11] i don't have a security of rapture for
[56:13] them that they're in the bride i don't i
[56:16] don't don't have that
[56:17] i but but but as far as salvation yes
[56:20] but you see
[56:21] salvation itself when we're looking at
[56:23] some of this even in john 3 it says that
[56:25] you
[56:25] might be saved so we look at we want a
[56:29] great security and that's in christ i
[56:31] think what a value it is
[56:33] for us to be able by god's grace that we
[56:36] can
[56:36] really give our lives to him that he can
[56:39] live
[56:40] his life through us and so when i
[56:43] when i look at this with abimelech this
[56:46] man
[56:46] has risked his life remember he's he's
[56:48] the he's a king
[56:50] servant and and remember the
[56:53] to the the message has been looked at as
[56:56] treasonous that
[56:57] it's so against the princes of judah
[57:01] and these men should that should have
[57:03] been rallying around what god
[57:06] was doing and what god was declaring but
[57:08] instead
[57:09] they took us opposition against it like
[57:13] we see of the pharisees
[57:15] same way we see how cain rose up in
[57:18] opposition to abel
[57:19] it's a spirit that rose up in opposition
[57:22] to the word that god was vindicating
[57:26] and made known in that hour but this man
[57:28] he interceded
[57:29] for jeremiah there was i want you to
[57:32] think of this
[57:34] this is a man he's a gentile he could
[57:37] not even go in the temple to worship
[57:41] he didn't couldn't go in the temple to
[57:42] worship this man
[57:44] think how paul would put it like this we
[57:47] were on the outside
[57:48] of the covenants there was nothing paul
[57:51] would bring that out in ephesians 2.
[57:53] there was no
[57:54] that was to the commonwealth of israel
[57:56] we understand the hidden part within it
[57:59] you say what are you trying to say i'm
[58:00] trying to say that there was nothing
[58:02] written down
[58:04] that where abomilah could say my
[58:06] goodness i'm gonna have faith in that
[58:08] but how much greater for you and i
[58:10] there's word that god
[58:12] has given to you and i in the scriptures
[58:14] in his word
[58:15] that you and i might have faith in what
[58:17] he has said but it just goes to show
[58:20] it's got to be more than just faith
[58:22] within the written word although that is
[58:24] great
[58:25] but there's got to be faith in the
[58:28] person of jesus christ
[58:30] and he is the word amen
[58:35] he knows this man knows jeremiah is
[58:37] god's prophet
[58:40] not just the prophet he knows he's god's
[58:42] prophet
[58:43] he also knows this is the servant with
[58:46] the word of the lord this is not a man
[58:50] just quoting the bible let me say it
[58:52] like that
[58:53] he does not quote in the bible as we
[58:55] look down here on thursday night there's
[58:56] a great difference between the bible and
[58:58] the word of the lord
[59:01] many can have the bible but they don't
[59:02] have the word of the lord
[59:04] the word of the lord is the inspiration
[59:07] of the holy spirit
[59:08] that comes upon the word to make it
[59:10] alive and real
[59:12] and those names that are sealed in that
[59:15] promise
[59:15] for that generation when the inspiration
[59:18] comes upon that word
[59:19] it reveals the characteristic of jesus
[59:22] christ
[59:23] and as it does that it calls out the
[59:25] character
[59:26] of jesus christ from our life that's to
[59:29] be expressed what is that that's the
[59:31] calling of the names
[59:32] that are wrought in the book in the
[59:34] promised land
[59:37] hallelujah her glory be to god
[59:41] [Music]
[59:44] he's received the testimony of the word
[59:47] and his actions speak
[59:50] you see in verses 16 and 17
[59:54] i want you to notice as i want you just
[59:55] to take this in
[59:57] god lets them know the words are going
[59:59] to come
[1:00:00] the judgment the wrath that's being
[1:00:04] poured out
[1:00:05] it's going to be in verse 16 it's going
[1:00:07] to be accomplished in that day before
[1:00:09] thee
[1:00:11] remember god said famine was going to
[1:00:13] come
[1:00:15] when you read in the book of
[1:00:16] lamentations
[1:00:18] lamentations is the spirit of god
[1:00:21] grieved
[1:00:22] in the heart of the prophet jeremiah
[1:00:26] the word has to be spoken but if the
[1:00:28] word does not come without
[1:00:30] feeling are you with me god does not
[1:00:33] look upon you and i
[1:00:34] as brother branham would put it as god
[1:00:36] inspired to his heart
[1:00:37] in standing in the gap he said people
[1:00:39] are not just made out of sawdust
[1:00:42] there's a feeling behind it when that
[1:00:43] word would come
[1:00:45] amen but jeremiah the spirit of god in
[1:00:48] jeremiah
[1:00:49] speaks of how they hear the babies
[1:00:51] crying out
[1:00:52] for famine and their tongues were
[1:00:54] cleaving to the roof of their mouth
[1:00:57] what i'm trying to say is they abamalik
[1:01:00] and the rest of them they were there
[1:01:03] they witnessed
[1:01:04] judgment already being poured out before
[1:01:07] the people were taken away
[1:01:09] there was judgments already coming about
[1:01:13] in the city famine where they were you
[1:01:15] know contending for one another's child
[1:01:17] we're going to eat yours today eat this
[1:01:18] one tomorrow this is right in the
[1:01:20] scripture
[1:01:23] this was already taking place
[1:01:26] all of that that was breaking around and
[1:01:29] caving
[1:01:29] in but there was a word
[1:01:33] of assurance a place of
[1:01:36] mercy that abimelech and
[1:01:40] others have found refuge in the word
[1:01:43] of the lord amen
[1:01:48] who am i praise god you see
[1:01:51] these are my things when you if you go
[1:01:53] on and read in these scriptures we
[1:01:54] looked at with zedekiah
[1:01:55] zedekiah was blind to the promise
[1:01:59] he was blind to jeremiah this is why
[1:02:02] when he tried to escape zedekiah now
[1:02:05] that they pursued after him
[1:02:07] they killed his sons in front of him and
[1:02:09] then they put his eyes out
[1:02:12] why he was already blind to what was
[1:02:14] going on
[1:02:16] brother sister one thing i'm thankful
[1:02:18] for god
[1:02:20] has not given to you and i that we would
[1:02:22] lead ourselves
[1:02:23] but if we'll look to him there's a
[1:02:26] presence of the living god
[1:02:27] that comes down into our life into our
[1:02:30] homes
[1:02:30] and it's not us trying to figure out how
[1:02:32] do i answer this question
[1:02:34] how do i lead my son how do i leave my
[1:02:35] daughter how do i lead my wife
[1:02:37] there's a presence of a living god
[1:02:39] that's real leadership
[1:02:41] that all we have to do is yield to his
[1:02:44] presence brother
[1:02:45] he will lead and guide us into all truth
[1:02:48] [Applause]
[1:02:51] i believe that with all my heart not
[1:02:53] just believe it i know it to be the
[1:02:54] truth
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:59] praise the lord i know i'm talking to
[1:03:01] i'm talking to lives and hearts that
[1:03:02] know that same thing
[1:03:04] once you think of this so all that's
[1:03:06] going to be going on around you
[1:03:08] but in that same day i will deliver the
[1:03:12] verse 17
[1:03:13] in that day yes amen in that day when
[1:03:16] the spirit
[1:03:17] of destruction is upon the people
[1:03:21] my spirit is upon you to deliver you
[1:03:26] this is god's promise it was not it's no
[1:03:29] abomination like
[1:03:30] well you're going to be completely
[1:03:31] exempt from this i don't know
[1:03:33] i don't know what abimelech had to go
[1:03:35] through i don't know
[1:03:36] if there might have been certain meals
[1:03:38] that he i don't know but one thing i do
[1:03:40] know
[1:03:41] god made a promise in his word he said
[1:03:43] i've never seen the righteous forsaken
[1:03:45] i've never seen a child of god have to
[1:03:47] bake bread i just know this one saying
[1:03:49] the word came and told him don't worry
[1:03:52] about the squeeze that's coming
[1:03:54] just trust in the word that's come to
[1:03:56] you it's god that'll make a way
[1:03:59] [Applause]
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:00] amen so if babylic wasn't storing up
[1:04:03] food like i better go buy a campbell
[1:04:05] soup
[1:04:05] that was not what abamelec was doing
[1:04:07] amen
[1:04:09] he was not listen to me the word comes
[1:04:12] to let you and i know
[1:04:14] yes you have to go grocery shopping come
[1:04:16] on now
[1:04:17] sure you have to go grocery shopping in
[1:04:19] order to have food in your house
[1:04:20] but you see that comes to a place even
[1:04:23] within this
[1:04:24] abamalec is not trusting in his own
[1:04:27] prevention
[1:04:28] he did not provide this mercy
[1:04:31] god provided it he accepted it
[1:04:35] that's why god said don't take any care
[1:04:38] don't get worried with anxious care
[1:04:46] hello you damn give me the name of those
[1:04:50] waiters that fed elijah by the book
[1:04:54] did elijah go into hiding with we got
[1:04:56] this dry
[1:04:57] food that we'll pull water over it and
[1:04:59] it'll turn to mashed potatoes
[1:05:02] i'd rather starve
[1:05:05] he didn't go into there with natural
[1:05:07] food and they hauled it up there with
[1:05:09] crates come on somebody
[1:05:11] elijah went there because that's where
[1:05:14] god said
[1:05:14] you get there and i'll sustain you
[1:05:19] in christ in this revealed word
[1:05:22] underneath the blood
[1:05:23] we've got the promise i'll sustain you
[1:05:25] he said i'll provide
[1:05:27] for all of your needs
[1:05:32] sometimes we act as though god needs our
[1:05:34] help he needs our assistance he don't
[1:05:36] need our help
[1:05:37] he don't need our assistance
[1:05:46] i mean after all when when the sandwich
[1:05:49] came to elijah
[1:05:50] i mean elijah just wasn't sitting there
[1:05:52] and saying okay god
[1:05:53] bring it on over here and feed me no he
[1:05:55] recognized god provided he took it
[1:05:57] right right so you see the balance
[1:06:01] within it he wasn't just sitting around
[1:06:02] and
[1:06:03] you know they're fanning him and he's
[1:06:04] there on the on the chair and
[1:06:06] oh my yeah i'd like another one of those
[1:06:09] and
[1:06:09] would you come and feed it to me no no
[1:06:11] he still he had to go
[1:06:13] and take and receive what god was
[1:06:15] providing in the natural
[1:06:17] same way in the spiritual he was
[1:06:19] trusting
[1:06:20] in the word of the lord brother i
[1:06:23] believe that was on my heart
[1:06:24] that's what the holy spirit is even
[1:06:27] working in our lives right now
[1:06:29] what is the level and the depth of your
[1:06:31] trust in me
[1:06:36] god knew these hours were going to be
[1:06:38] here he knew these situations were going
[1:06:40] to be here
[1:06:41] this is not taking him by surprise
[1:06:45] he steal the almighty god
[1:06:48] [Applause]
[1:06:54] what a contrast was taking place
[1:06:58] while the rest of the city was
[1:07:00] experiencing judgment
[1:07:02] friends you see this is the gripping was
[1:07:05] going in
[1:07:06] even in jeremiah's heart if they only
[1:07:08] would have turned
[1:07:09] now they weren't going to keep back the
[1:07:10] wrath and the judgment
[1:07:12] but if they only would have turned mercy
[1:07:15] said
[1:07:16] go out and surrender yourselves to the
[1:07:18] king of babylon
[1:07:20] go out and give yourselves to them
[1:07:24] that's why that looks like a treasonous
[1:07:26] word
[1:07:27] but such a contrast while the rest of
[1:07:30] the city
[1:07:31] is involved in chaos
[1:07:34] and famine and things that are taking
[1:07:37] place
[1:07:38] the bible records it in the book of
[1:07:39] lamentations ravishings and everything
[1:07:42] going on
[1:07:43] all around what a contrast in the midst
[1:07:46] of it
[1:07:46] abamalik was resting in the word of the
[1:07:50] lord
[1:07:50] let me just say this very clearly this
[1:07:53] man
[1:07:54] had joy amen
[1:07:58] wish i could really preach on that this
[1:07:59] morning this man had joy
[1:08:01] praise the lord you see it depends on
[1:08:04] what you're looking at
[1:08:06] right right if he was looking at all the
[1:08:08] destruction going on around
[1:08:10] there it ain't no joy in looking at that
[1:08:12] but you see there's been a word that's
[1:08:14] attracted
[1:08:15] his attention hallelujah it's in a word
[1:08:18] that's been fulfilled
[1:08:19] and it had attracted his attention it
[1:08:22] brings real joy in our heart
[1:08:24] what brings real joy not that i know
[1:08:26] every event that's going to unfold and
[1:08:28] happen and
[1:08:28] how this is going to be and how that's
[1:08:30] going to be that's not the joy
[1:08:32] the joy is that he said i will deliver
[1:08:35] thee
[1:08:35] the sword will not touch thee i will
[1:08:38] bring you out
[1:08:42] amen amen hallelujah
[1:08:45] because thou have put your trust in me
[1:08:51] think of it
[1:08:52] abamalik here a gentile
[1:08:56] ethiopian he caught and he heard the
[1:08:59] mercy in the word of god
[1:09:02] god's no respect to persons
[1:09:06] you see even though the city jerusalem
[1:09:10] oh it was known as a city of praise
[1:09:14] it was known as a city it was not one
[1:09:16] paying tribute but it was one that other
[1:09:18] cities pay tribute to it
[1:09:21] you see it's the the character
[1:09:24] it was the character of the life they
[1:09:28] had gotten away from
[1:09:31] remember jerusalem was not the walls
[1:09:35] jerusalem was the character of christ
[1:09:39] in his people
[1:09:42] you with me they got away from that soon
[1:09:45] as they got away from that
[1:09:46] it didn't matter how many strongholds
[1:09:48] they had how many bull works it did not
[1:09:50] matter
[1:09:51] how their walls were their gates their
[1:09:53] locks that
[1:09:54] itself did not matter that was not their
[1:09:57] strength
[1:09:57] their strength was jehovah
[1:10:01] the lord was their strength and they got
[1:10:05] away from that character
[1:10:06] are you with me now so while israel when
[1:10:09] they
[1:10:10] the jews had gone away from the
[1:10:12] character of that no
[1:10:13] that jerusalem there was a prophet
[1:10:16] that was standing there and calling them
[1:10:19] back
[1:10:19] and letting them know you drifted from
[1:10:22] that character
[1:10:23] and that character of what jerusalem
[1:10:25] really is
[1:10:26] there was a man who was a gentile and he
[1:10:29] saw the representation
[1:10:31] of that jerusalem in that message
[1:10:34] brother
[1:10:35] are you with me now we see a
[1:10:38] representation
[1:10:39] in the message that god has sent to you
[1:10:41] and i
[1:10:42] it's a representation of a new jerusalem
[1:10:47] it's the holy ghost that's been sent
[1:10:50] back
[1:10:50] among his children not a portion but the
[1:10:53] entire fullness
[1:10:55] of the holy ghost it's the spirit
[1:10:58] of our homeland that's brought us back
[1:11:01] [Applause]
[1:11:05] he was an ethiopian but he identified
[1:11:08] with the character of jerusalem
[1:11:14] [Music]
[1:11:19] makes this statement in christ the
[1:11:21] mystery i'm going to read this
[1:11:25] he says since he he was made all things
[1:11:29] was made
[1:11:30] for him and by him and since that's true
[1:11:34] we should make our identification
[1:11:38] should be with him we should be
[1:11:42] identified ourselves with him
[1:11:45] because he has identified himself with
[1:11:48] us
[1:11:49] that's a big mouthful
[1:11:52] he has come down to identify think about
[1:11:54] this
[1:11:55] the god of glory
[1:11:58] came down and took upon a body made
[1:12:01] in the likeness of sinful flesh he came
[1:12:04] down
[1:12:04] and identified himself with us his
[1:12:08] subjects that he might be
[1:12:11] a faithful and merciful high priest
[1:12:16] but that ain't just 2 000 years ago amen
[1:12:19] that made a way so that the high priest
[1:12:22] could come to your door
[1:12:24] the high priest could come to your life
[1:12:26] he could come
[1:12:27] and take a word that'll identify the
[1:12:30] situation
[1:12:31] and the condition in your life and be
[1:12:34] able to address
[1:12:36] that situation and say there is a blood
[1:12:39] that takes care there is a life in that
[1:12:42] blood
[1:12:42] that will minister to the remnant what's
[1:12:44] he doing he's coming down
[1:12:46] he don't withhold himself he comes down
[1:12:48] and makes himself
[1:12:50] known to you and i yeah i think about it
[1:12:53] god could say a lot of things
[1:12:58] there's a lot of times with things even
[1:12:59] as i'm studying and just just giving
[1:13:01] just looking to the lord and
[1:13:02] praying over things and sometimes our
[1:13:04] inspiration and
[1:13:05] things will start but when i always look
[1:13:08] at things i don't try to
[1:13:09] figure it out but i look at it that the
[1:13:11] heart's desire is
[1:13:12] is that sometimes you can say things you
[1:13:15] can go through and
[1:13:16] identify this unfolding and this and
[1:13:18] that but there is even a greater
[1:13:20] where you can catch that and preach the
[1:13:22] character of christ
[1:13:24] in that unfolding because that's who has
[1:13:26] to be over the people and take effect on
[1:13:29] our lives
[1:13:30] sometimes i hope you understand me
[1:13:32] sometimes words
[1:13:35] can can can sometimes get things off
[1:13:37] track
[1:13:38] not the words but i hope you understand
[1:13:40] what i'm saying
[1:13:41] when the gospel is made to be in
[1:13:45] amen simplicity that ain't me trying to
[1:13:46] make it simple that's got to be him
[1:13:49] we should be identified with him how
[1:13:54] by living for him not just a confession
[1:14:02] so many people take a confession got to
[1:14:04] a place now
[1:14:05] are you a christian i'm methodist well
[1:14:08] that's a long way from being
[1:14:09] making yourself known as a christian
[1:14:12] look what the methodist does i'm baptist
[1:14:14] well look what the baptist does i'm
[1:14:15] catholic look what they do
[1:14:18] but the only way that you can actually
[1:14:21] be a
[1:14:22] christian is for christ to identify
[1:14:26] himself in you
[1:14:32] it goes on it says now you say i'm
[1:14:33] pentecostal he said that don't mean a
[1:14:35] thing
[1:14:38] it's christ identified in you
[1:14:44] but samuel i believe the message that's
[1:14:46] wonderful
[1:14:47] but has christ been identified
[1:14:50] in you amen amen
[1:14:53] i'm not talking about your failing i'm
[1:14:55] talking about is
[1:14:56] he identified in you
[1:14:59] [Music]
[1:15:00] that's when he has recognized you
[1:15:05] remember the word came back to abimelech
[1:15:11] it came back it came personally a bed
[1:15:13] millet had identified himself
[1:15:16] with the word in that hour before you
[1:15:18] can identify yourself with the word the
[1:15:20] word's got to be revealed amen how can
[1:15:24] you know how can you know
[1:15:25] what to identify with if the word's not
[1:15:27] revealed
[1:15:29] oh glory be to god i spoke with tongues
[1:15:32] devils do too i shouted the muhammadans
[1:15:35] buddhism
[1:15:36] everything else shouts the indians
[1:15:37] scream at the snake dance sure they all
[1:15:39] do
[1:15:40] cults clans and everything else scream
[1:15:41] and holler they holler and shout at a
[1:15:43] baseball game
[1:15:44] but when christ is identified in you
[1:15:49] what is the holy spirit trying to speak
[1:15:51] here he's letting it be known
[1:15:53] don't put your rest and stop
[1:15:56] in an emotion
[1:15:58] [Applause]
[1:16:00] emotion comes with it but don't put your
[1:16:03] stuck
[1:16:04] in an emotion this is talking about
[1:16:07] a deep inner work where jesus christ
[1:16:10] comes in
[1:16:11] and he takes care of that old sin nature
[1:16:20] he'll never come where he's not invited
[1:16:22] though
[1:16:23] when christ is identified in you
[1:16:26] identifying
[1:16:27] his self then you are christlike
[1:16:30] which the word christian means to be
[1:16:33] christ-like
[1:16:34] there is your identification now and
[1:16:37] since
[1:16:38] he is our identification then we should
[1:16:40] be
[1:16:41] identified with him by living for him
[1:16:48] thank you lord you might say salmon i
[1:16:50] don't know everything
[1:16:51] god don't ask you to know everything
[1:16:53] amen but what god is dealing with your
[1:16:55] heart going
[1:16:56] on in his word he's drawing you to him
[1:16:58] you identify with that word you say amen
[1:17:01] to that word
[1:17:02] you don't look about well i don't know
[1:17:03] if i can do this and i don't know if i
[1:17:05] can do that
[1:17:05] you stand on that word and say i can do
[1:17:07] all things through christ who
[1:17:08] strengthens me
[1:17:11] it's not your power doing it
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:15] it's his power there's power in this
[1:17:17] world
[1:17:20] hallelujah i tell you the greatest thing
[1:17:24] you do is you say well i just can't get
[1:17:26] rid of my pants
[1:17:27] i can't get rid of my earrings or i
[1:17:29] can't get rid of my pornography or i
[1:17:31] can't get around on this
[1:17:32] you can't get rid of it but i can tell
[1:17:34] you there's a living lord jesus christ
[1:17:37] if you give yourself to him he'll give
[1:17:39] you power to overcome that
[1:17:41] if you'll be honest with him and say
[1:17:43] lord i don't want this to know more
[1:17:45] about my life
[1:17:46] i want to be identified with you i'm
[1:17:49] tired of struggling to live right
[1:17:52] i want the liver the doer of the world
[1:17:55] to come on the inside of me
[1:17:57] you start identifying like that that
[1:18:00] invites him
[1:18:01] to come and identify himself
[1:18:04] in you
[1:18:04] [Applause]
[1:18:11] there's no excuse but
[1:18:14] samuel that's awful hard just swallow it
[1:18:17] down there ain't no excuse
[1:18:20] there's a place a lot harder than this
[1:18:22] place
[1:18:24] now if it had been you and i let's just
[1:18:26] be honest you and i would have just went
[1:18:33] oh one more
[1:18:41] that's the difference but peter picks
[1:18:44] this up this is one now
[1:18:45] who's been identified with him in acts 5
[1:18:48] 31
[1:18:48] him talking about jesus him hath god
[1:18:52] exalted with his right hand to be a
[1:18:54] prince
[1:18:55] and a savior for to give repentance to
[1:18:59] israel
[1:18:59] and forgiveness of sins and we are his
[1:19:03] witnesses of these things
[1:19:09] peter said i know he's been seated in
[1:19:11] power
[1:19:13] i know he's a high priest how do you
[1:19:15] know because i have the expression
[1:19:18] the transformation in my life because i
[1:19:21] in my life i am seated in power
[1:19:24] as a son of god
[1:19:27] that's what the holy ghost does it
[1:19:30] brings the dunamis the power of god
[1:19:33] that it actually seats you in the right
[1:19:36] place
[1:19:36] [Applause]
[1:19:41] it takes away that old nature and it
[1:19:44] places you
[1:19:45] in the lamb's book of life
[1:19:48] your name was already right there you
[1:19:50] didn't do that
[1:19:52] god came and did that for you it was god
[1:19:55] that stirred up your life
[1:19:56] it was not your faith it was god's faith
[1:19:59] that came and gave you faith
[1:20:13] and so also we're witnesses of these
[1:20:15] things
[1:20:16] and so also is also the holy ghost
[1:20:20] whom god hath given to them that obey
[1:20:23] him
[1:20:24] let me just drop this down
[1:20:28] full obedience you've heard this
[1:20:29] statement probably most of you have
[1:20:31] full obedience to the word grants you
[1:20:34] the token
[1:20:37] this is the paradox we're talking about
[1:20:38] obedience
[1:20:40] god is not just looking at actions
[1:20:44] let me just be very simple here you
[1:20:46] could take a person
[1:20:48] that's got shorter hair than me
[1:20:52] it's hard to believe in it
[1:20:56] they might have all sorts of things that
[1:20:57] they've come in here with or or what
[1:20:59] have you
[1:21:00] and you might look at and say well they
[1:21:02] got to get rid of this and got to get
[1:21:03] rid of that and got to get rid of this
[1:21:04] and got to get rid of that
[1:21:06] got to get rid of this got to get rid of
[1:21:07] that got to get rid and you got to
[1:21:08] borrow other people's fingers too
[1:21:13] but all it takes is one moment
[1:21:17] in his presence
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:22] all takes us one moment in his presence
[1:21:25] and that heart is turned in obedience
[1:21:30] it's gone brother it's over
[1:21:34] it is finished
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:21:51] it's hearkening to god's voice it's the
[1:21:54] dove coming
[1:21:55] to lead the lamb just as he led the lamb
[1:21:58] to calvary the dove led the lamb notice
[1:22:02] where was the dove remember the spirit
[1:22:04] left him in the garden
[1:22:06] are you with me it left him in the
[1:22:08] garden but it led him
[1:22:11] why showing that in order for this
[1:22:14] life to come to you and i the same holy
[1:22:18] spirit
[1:22:18] that came upon the lamb of god would be
[1:22:21] the same dog
[1:22:22] that would lead lambs of god better
[1:22:25] written in the lamb's book of
[1:22:27] life it would lead us to a place
[1:22:30] of surrender that the life of the lamb
[1:22:33] of god
[1:22:34] which is god's own life could come
[1:22:36] manifest in
[1:22:47] oh glory be to god
[1:22:53] this is where the scripture says in
[1:22:54] hebrews 11 6.
[1:22:57] i'm trying to get to the point here
[1:22:59] without faith
[1:23:01] it's impossible to please him
[1:23:06] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:23:09] that he is
[1:23:11] he's a living god the living god and
[1:23:14] that he is a rewarder
[1:23:16] of them that diligently seek him
[1:23:20] i want to read here just a few
[1:23:22] scriptures
[1:23:25] in isaiah 40 verse 9
[1:23:28] these scriptures it would speak of god
[1:23:30] coming
[1:23:31] and restoring israel but remember it
[1:23:34] speaks in type of the bride and once
[1:23:36] these these scriptures have been
[1:23:37] resonating within my heart here for some
[1:23:40] time
[1:23:41] he says oh zion verse 9 that bring us
[1:23:43] good great good tidings
[1:23:45] get thee up into the high mountain o
[1:23:47] jerusalem that bring us good
[1:23:48] tidings lift up by voice with strength
[1:23:51] lift it up
[1:23:52] be not afraid say unto the cities of
[1:23:54] judah behold your god
[1:23:57] behold the lord will come with strong
[1:23:59] hand
[1:24:00] and his arm shall rule for him behold
[1:24:04] his reward is with him and his work
[1:24:08] before him he shall feed his flock
[1:24:12] like a shepherd he shall gather the
[1:24:14] lambs with his arm
[1:24:15] and carry them in his bosom and shall
[1:24:17] gently lead those
[1:24:19] that are with young what care
[1:24:23] amen what kind isaiah 62 11
[1:24:28] behold the lord hath proclaimed unto the
[1:24:30] end of the world
[1:24:31] say you to the daughter of zion behold
[1:24:34] thy salvation cometh
[1:24:35] behold his reward is with him and his
[1:24:38] work
[1:24:39] before him and they shall call them
[1:24:42] the holy people the redeemed of the lord
[1:24:45] and thou
[1:24:45] shalt be called sought out a city
[1:24:49] not forsaken
[1:24:52] you see god knew all this was going to
[1:24:54] come about but this is the promise
[1:24:56] in the regathering of israel not just in
[1:24:59] them coming back
[1:25:00] from babylon this is talking to the 144
[1:25:03] 000
[1:25:04] that's going to receive their visitation
[1:25:07] a city
[1:25:08] that is called forsaken but you will no
[1:25:10] longer be called
[1:25:11] forsaken you will be called shout out
[1:25:14] who is it
[1:25:15] that it sought you out it's the holy
[1:25:17] spirit
[1:25:18] that has shot you and i out
[1:25:22] our lives listen to me a life that is
[1:25:25] out in
[1:25:26] sin it speaks of a forsakenness
[1:25:31] it speaks of a life that's without a
[1:25:33] comforter
[1:25:36] this is what god had a problem with the
[1:25:38] priests and the prophets in the time of
[1:25:40] jeremiah
[1:25:42] and the other times they kept on
[1:25:44] prophesying peace and
[1:25:46] peace and peace and peace but they never
[1:25:49] dealt with the iniquity that was in the
[1:25:50] heart
[1:25:52] there was a wound that needed to be
[1:25:54] dealt with
[1:25:56] there was some hurt there was iniquity
[1:25:59] that needed to be dealt with but instead
[1:26:01] all they were doing was patching it out
[1:26:04] patching it up
[1:26:04] instead of really ministering the remedy
[1:26:07] there's only
[1:26:08] one faith that can minister to a real
[1:26:10] remedy
[1:26:11] of a heart of a womb of a sin sick soul
[1:26:15] and that's a word that lets you know if
[1:26:17] you don't get it taken care of
[1:26:19] it cankers and when tankers spread it
[1:26:22] dies
[1:26:24] if you've got the least little bit of
[1:26:26] twins this morning
[1:26:28] i would let that twins become greater
[1:26:31] and don't
[1:26:31] allow the enemy to deaden it
[1:26:47] i think there ought to be some sons and
[1:26:48] daughters rise up and have some real
[1:26:51] righteous indignation toward the devil
[1:26:55] i ain't set in this condition no more
[1:26:57] amen
[1:26:59] you're not putting it over on me no more
[1:27:08] a lot of times we get mad at ourselves
[1:27:09] for doing stupid stuff
[1:27:11] but we really need to get mad at the
[1:27:12] devil
[1:27:15] sometimes we say oh why did i put the
[1:27:17] water there or why did i do a tear or
[1:27:19] what i'd do a tear oh dummy me
[1:27:21] why did i do this we really need to get
[1:27:23] mad at the devil
[1:27:26] glory amen
[1:27:30] hallelujah how do we stand face to face
[1:27:32] with him
[1:27:33] stand on the word yes right amen brother
[1:27:36] stands in the message of shame and he
[1:27:38] stands before all the people and he says
[1:27:40] you know what
[1:27:41] even as he prays he said god forgive me
[1:27:44] he said it's got to a place he said
[1:27:46] when i'm praying he said it's almost
[1:27:47] like we're just asking the devil
[1:27:49] devil could you leave he said shame on
[1:27:52] us
[1:27:52] we ought to stand there and observe the
[1:27:55] devil
[1:27:56] take your hands off
[1:27:59] i'm not ashamed of this word it has
[1:28:02] power in it
[1:28:03] to free and to loosen it
[1:28:15] behold we said notice in these
[1:28:18] scriptures
[1:28:20] he comes notice he cometh behold
[1:28:24] he cometh
[1:28:27] right now we are looking and expecting
[1:28:30] the second coming the physical
[1:28:34] return of the lord jesus christ but do
[1:28:37] you realize
[1:28:38] he's already here
[1:28:42] he's come by his word
[1:28:46] the day of pentecost sealed the first
[1:28:49] coming
[1:28:49] yes you're with me
[1:28:53] the light it sealed it and it opens up
[1:28:55] that of the second coming
[1:28:56] where they're expecting we're expecting
[1:28:59] his
[1:29:00] literal return but remember before
[1:29:03] we can ever be part of that to be part
[1:29:06] of that coming
[1:29:07] he's got to come to us and come in us
[1:29:12] this is where the scripture said that
[1:29:14] salvation cometh
[1:29:16] behold he cometh amen
[1:29:19] amen amen his reward is with him
[1:29:23] this this term reward means the fair or
[1:29:26] the passage
[1:29:27] that's needed to pay the fair
[1:29:31] glory his reward is with him
[1:29:34] the holy ghost is not something separate
[1:29:36] from god
[1:29:39] amen it is the token it is jesus christ
[1:29:42] it is almighty god coming in to that
[1:29:45] life
[1:29:45] it is that fair that's already been paid
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:49] is the reward
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:30:04] rewards with a body change
[1:30:08] that ain't it there's also going to be
[1:30:10] rewards handed out those who stood
[1:30:12] faithful
[1:30:14] hallelujah amen oh we could go on on
[1:30:18] that
[1:30:18] that there are rewards but you know what
[1:30:20] we're not interested and i believe this
[1:30:22] on my heart we're not doing what we're
[1:30:24] doing for rewards
[1:30:25] [Music]
[1:30:26] it's going to be rewarding enough i
[1:30:27] think of like that old black brother
[1:30:29] brother branham
[1:30:29] calls back and they're talking about him
[1:30:31] oh what's going to do with your robin
[1:30:32] crown when he gets there he said don't
[1:30:34] you talk to me about no robin crowd
[1:30:36] he said when i get there i just want to
[1:30:38] see jesus
[1:30:39] i want to see the one who paid the price
[1:30:42] for me
[1:30:42] i want to see the one who came and drew
[1:30:45] me to himself
[1:30:46] i want to see the one who changed me i
[1:30:48] just want to worship him
[1:30:52] our goal is not rewards in there but let
[1:30:56] me tell you
[1:30:56] every reward from the change of the body
[1:30:59] to all that
[1:31:00] god god gives for each and every part of
[1:31:02] our life
[1:31:03] let me just tell you there's no glory
[1:31:05] that we can take in it
[1:31:07] it's because god has given you and i the
[1:31:10] grace
[1:31:10] to be able to yield our own lives to him
[1:31:26] paraphrase over these
[1:31:30] jesus is here and he gathers his church
[1:31:33] together
[1:31:38] you want to make a church
[1:31:43] small church
[1:31:46] i i ain't trying to say nothing you you
[1:31:49] understand what i'm saying
[1:31:51] i'm just trying to say at that time
[1:31:56] he walks up to his and he says who do
[1:31:59] men
[1:32:00] say that i the son of man am right
[1:32:06] some say you're elijah
[1:32:09] some say you know you're john the
[1:32:13] baptist come back
[1:32:15] some say you're jeremiah's are you you
[1:32:17] catching
[1:32:18] what it is they recognize
[1:32:23] what they see in him it's a vacation
[1:32:26] that's been in the others
[1:32:30] it's the same one that's identified
[1:32:33] in the rest of them
[1:32:36] this is what a bed malek saw in jeremiah
[1:32:40] it was not just jeremiah
[1:32:44] he was not just oh i loved jeremiah no
[1:32:47] his
[1:32:47] remember god when god spoke to him
[1:32:50] he never said anything oh because you
[1:32:53] love jeremiah
[1:32:54] and you really like this about jeremiah
[1:32:56] no god recognized
[1:32:58] that abimelech's faith but he found
[1:33:01] a hiding place in christ that was
[1:33:04] ministered
[1:33:05] through jeremiah the prophet
[1:33:09] jeremiah couldn't hide him but jeremiah
[1:33:11] had a message of christ
[1:33:13] and that message said get under the
[1:33:15] blood and you get under the blood
[1:33:16] and you will be found where they have
[1:33:20] escaped
[1:33:23] who do men say that i am now you know
[1:33:28] peter and this wasn't peter
[1:33:32] i remember i wonder you know how they
[1:33:34] were all sitting around
[1:33:35] and this comes out peter said thou art
[1:33:38] the christ
[1:33:39] the son of the living god that wasn't
[1:33:42] this noggin up here
[1:33:45] there was a seed on the inside
[1:33:51] though that seed had not been quickened
[1:33:53] yet
[1:33:55] but in that moment it spoke up
[1:34:06] it's just like as a young person or
[1:34:07] whoever else or whatever
[1:34:09] that reality that quickening may not
[1:34:12] have struck your heart yet
[1:34:14] but there's something about it with this
[1:34:16] word that you know
[1:34:17] this is jesus christ revealed people can
[1:34:20] try to tear down
[1:34:22] this message and what and more you tear
[1:34:23] down the message you're tearing down
[1:34:25] jesus christ
[1:34:29] flat and simple but there's something
[1:34:31] about it even though you could stand
[1:34:33] there
[1:34:33] and you know your life ain't lining up
[1:34:35] but what is it there's a seed on the
[1:34:37] inside that says i can't explain it but
[1:34:39] i know it's the truth
[1:34:42] i know it's the truth what is that
[1:34:45] that's a representation
[1:34:47] preach with me if you only let it have
[1:34:49] the right way
[1:34:50] that same one who's moving across that
[1:34:54] right now if you only let him come in
[1:34:56] he'll quicken that seat
[1:34:58] and it'll be raised in power
[1:35:00] [Applause]
[1:35:06] [Music]
[1:35:08] who do you say that i am
[1:35:16] this same revelation brought authority
[1:35:20] to loosen and to bind
[1:35:24] what brought the authority to loosen and
[1:35:26] bind the word
[1:35:28] listen the word ministered made them
[1:35:30] aware
[1:35:31] of their rights as sons they didn't have
[1:35:34] the power
[1:35:35] yet they had exclusive they didn't have
[1:35:38] due to muslims
[1:35:39] but when the word listen how can you
[1:35:41] know what belongs to you
[1:35:42] unless the word comes to let you know
[1:35:44] this belongs to you
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:48] as many as received him to them gave him
[1:35:51] the exclusion
[1:35:52] to become the sons of god he took the
[1:35:55] word ministering to you
[1:35:59] you didn't see it in yourself i didn't
[1:36:01] see it in myself
[1:36:02] but it took him he knew what was inside
[1:36:06] of you
[1:36:07] this word
[1:36:13] brother samuel why is this coming so
[1:36:16] strong like this
[1:36:16] because i believe the holy ghost is
[1:36:18] trying to tell us it's more than just
[1:36:20] coming to a message church
[1:36:23] it's more than just knowing brother
[1:36:25] brown is a prophet
[1:36:26] it's more than just you having a bible
[1:36:28] in your house
[1:36:30] it's more than you being a real good
[1:36:32] devotional person
[1:36:34] it's much deeper than that thank god
[1:36:36] that all those things that you know
[1:36:38] it's deeper than that it's where
[1:36:41] christ has to be identified in you you
[1:36:43] say how do i know when he's identified
[1:36:45] in me
[1:36:46] it isn't that well i haven't been
[1:36:47] walking on water i've been turning water
[1:36:50] into wine
[1:36:50] no you don't need to turn water into
[1:36:52] wine he turns your life from chaos
[1:36:55] into joy he took away what was down on
[1:36:58] the inside of your life
[1:37:00] he removed that old sin nature there's
[1:37:02] no desire
[1:37:03] for the things of the world what did
[1:37:06] that a living god
[1:37:22] that same phrase and christ the mystery
[1:37:26] and he says who do you say i am now
[1:37:32] it's always easy people can look back in
[1:37:34] history
[1:37:36] but who do you say he is now
[1:37:40] amen can i read it
[1:37:45] well he's a philosopher he had this
[1:37:48] social religion
[1:37:49] he's a good man we believe his teachings
[1:37:52] is right
[1:37:52] it's subject to be lived by i think it'd
[1:37:55] make us all better if we did
[1:37:56] we we ought to have our churches and so
[1:37:58] forth that's a
[1:38:00] santa claus story
[1:38:09] it's not expressions of some church that
[1:38:12] we should express something
[1:38:14] that's true
[1:38:18] well i'm in a methodist or i'm a baptist
[1:38:20] let's bring it on into our rings
[1:38:23] well i believe in this doctrine i
[1:38:24] believe in this doctrine i'd rather be
[1:38:26] identified with jesus christ
[1:38:28] i don't want no turn being
[1:38:30] identification from me
[1:38:31] i want to live lord jesus christ to be
[1:38:34] the identified one
[1:38:36] right here in our midst
[1:38:38] [Applause]
[1:38:41] you're not careful you exile him
[1:38:48] huh we can't you can't invite jesus and
[1:38:50] put him in a box
[1:38:52] you got to let him be jesus and you got
[1:38:54] to invite him because he's jesus
[1:38:56] and you want him to be jesus you want
[1:38:59] him to help himself to your refrigerator
[1:39:01] you want him to help him help himself to
[1:39:03] your coffee pot you want him to help
[1:39:05] himself to your chair
[1:39:06] and take his shoes off and kick his feet
[1:39:08] up you want him to feel at home
[1:39:10] in your life
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] you want people when they look at you
[1:39:17] they may not know where to go to church
[1:39:18] may not know who your pastor is may not
[1:39:20] know all this right here but they look
[1:39:22] at you
[1:39:22] and they come up and they know that
[1:39:24] there is something about your life
[1:39:26] you're a christian
[1:39:29] it ain't important that they know who
[1:39:31] your pastor is it's
[1:39:32] important that they know jesus christ is
[1:39:35] living on the inside of you
[1:39:41] it's not expressions of some church then
[1:39:44] we should express something
[1:39:45] it's a life that you don't live yourself
[1:39:49] oh i can only do this if i can you're
[1:39:52] missing it
[1:39:56] don't let the devil complicate it right
[1:39:59] that's right
[1:40:02] well i can't do it in our own nature our
[1:40:04] own will
[1:40:05] you can't do it i tried as a young man
[1:40:10] and fell
[1:40:10] flat on my face why would god let me do
[1:40:14] it
[1:40:15] because god knew this gospel is not
[1:40:18] about
[1:40:18] your human strength amen
[1:40:22] god don't want our human strength
[1:40:26] he wants us to yield to him amen
[1:40:29] can i preach yes
[1:40:34] man too many times the reason people
[1:40:36] don't get the holy ghost
[1:40:37] is because they want the holy ghost
[1:40:38] added to their life instead of
[1:40:40] recognizing
[1:40:41] you need to get rid of your life because
[1:40:44] the holy ghost
[1:40:45] ain't going to come in and live in the
[1:40:47] same house
[1:40:48] got an old filthy spirit is living here
[1:40:51] he won't share rooms he won't cohabitate
[1:40:55] he's got to have the uppermost seat
[1:40:58] what do you say when you repent and you
[1:41:01] say
[1:41:01] god i gotta have the holy ghost more
[1:41:04] than
[1:41:04] anything else i'm tired of this life
[1:41:07] then you're getting somewhere
[1:41:09] [Applause]
[1:41:09] [Music]
[1:41:14] hey that's how it is with other things
[1:41:17] within your life even in the molding of
[1:41:19] our character
[1:41:24] it don't just stop and it just you know
[1:41:26] it's something that god deals with our
[1:41:27] heart
[1:41:30] it's a life that you don't live yourself
[1:41:32] but he comes in you
[1:41:33] and lives by himself and you become a
[1:41:36] prisoner
[1:41:37] to any human intellectual being at all
[1:41:39] you're led
[1:41:40] by the spirit lebron said somebody says
[1:41:44] how do i know i'm not losing my mind
[1:41:45] maybe a man
[1:41:46] loses mind does that if you have the
[1:41:48] mind of christ christ expresses himself
[1:41:50] through you
[1:41:50] and he shows that it's him you've not
[1:41:52] lost your mind
[1:41:54] some people under illusions of things
[1:41:55] goes out and becomes insane
[1:41:58] come on we've all seen nuts
[1:42:02] well that we know that's wrong but that
[1:42:05] you know the devil trying to impersonate
[1:42:07] the real thing before it gets there
[1:42:09] that's always a bogus
[1:42:10] right but a real man is to lose his own
[1:42:14] thoughts
[1:42:15] lose his own thinking and not come up
[1:42:16] blindly you come up with your right
[1:42:18] senses are you catching this very simple
[1:42:21] but you come up with your right senses
[1:42:24] and christ takes you over and expresses
[1:42:27] himself
[1:42:28] whether you come to the altar here or
[1:42:30] whether you let
[1:42:31] where god meet you in the altar of your
[1:42:33] heart you come with your right senses
[1:42:36] and you say god i want you to take
[1:42:39] me over
[1:42:46] goes on he says now when he uh paragraph
[1:42:49] 2 24
[1:42:49] when christ takes you over he'll express
[1:42:51] that word right through you
[1:42:53] because it's him he is the word and then
[1:42:56] you can see the expression of christ not
[1:42:58] some illusion
[1:42:59] a real genuine christ expressing himself
[1:43:02] right through you
[1:43:06] amen i've read a scripture here but
[1:43:10] i'm not going to go through and read
[1:43:12] this one either for sake of time but
[1:43:14] it's there
[1:43:15] mark 8 where jesus has said
[1:43:20] he talks about if any man is going to
[1:43:21] follow after me
[1:43:25] he has to first deny himself
[1:43:28] and take up his cross
[1:43:33] his cross and follow me
