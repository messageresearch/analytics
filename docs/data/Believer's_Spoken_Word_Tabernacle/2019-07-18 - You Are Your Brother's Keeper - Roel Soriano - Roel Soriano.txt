really believe that tonight amen then we can stand like this as the Spirit of God in our life amen like Zerubbabel and say who art Thou O great mountain before Zerubbabel amen thou shalt become as a plain a man and you know it so many times we have we we we always have needs we have things that we're praying about and we're looking to God but you know sometimes we don't always see and this is where faith is so much greater than our sight because even then our feelings because you know your feelings can lie to us amen even our thoughts amen even the thoughts itself like brother cadre spoke here last Thursday night those thoughts if those thoughts are not according to the Word of God then we cast every one of them down amen and let me just put it let me just put it very clear like this that in even a thought that would come with the scripture come with a quote if it is any way to try to isolate your I outside of the body of Jesus Christ it is a lying spirit amen because there's only one that we are made to receive from and that's the Living God amen and anytime that he has anything to say to us and if he even corrects us the correction is glorious because it lets us know he loves us you know my flesh all my flesh just like your flesh can say oh oh but you know really correction itself when we look at in the scripture I love the word the word correction in the scripture when you look at it it means restoration now how many of us ever ever spanked our children and then didn't want anything to do with them no the reason we corrected him because we loved them and wanted to see that little thing in their life curbed out I'm glad that God loves me enough to correct me Amen I'm glad you know what that means it means his eyes on me amen when he corrects me and says I don't don't be thinking that way don't don't don't go that way that I'm so grateful for his mercy aren't you a man it's so good to be a Christian in a man it's good to be under the blood amen hallelujah amen so thankful for God for what he's done in this hour and what he's doing amen in this hour we just want to give the service here turn it over to brother Rowell and for many for here we recognized brother role has been with us many many years and brother o.l comes from the Philippines there in Manila where a pastor as an assembly God has used him for those of you that don't know God has used brother ol2 too as a vessel to to spread this message and they've had upon his heart he started many many years ago I don't even know how many years ago it was in what they called mystery Expos because you know a lot of the denominational ministers and things like that they want to know more things so they would invite them in prepare a meal for him and then invite them in and then just begin to you know teach amen the doctrines of the message and then eventually these pastors and ministers would turn around and say bye after the seventh or tenth day I think it was they turn around and say where are you getting this from so then when they ask naked men that's when they introduced this is the messenger for this age and they would introduce God's prophet brother branham and identified these are things in the scriptures and you see what it is they used scriptures to prove the doctrines of the word and I believe that with all my heart that's exactly what this message was sent to you and I to restore Bible faith how many of you love your Bible I love my Bible more don't you I just I look more and more just the light of God's Word and and there's been many churches many whole churches that have just they've come come to the Lord the church and the congregation they Pat ties them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so if just it's just tremendous how God works amen and so we just we think God for brother o-l he and sister Cindy man as they're here with us and I want to say I just so appreciate amen my buddy my friend my brother brother Randy amen and and the church Oh Lorraine calling my buddy my friend cuz he is he puts up with me amen so we just just had wonderful fellowship here so we just thank God for it and just appreciate each and every one of you and how many's expecting tonight amen let's just pull on the gift of God god knows what our need is tonight he knows what your need well knows what my need is and the thing that we want to do we want to recognize his presence amen and just enter right in you just you just pull on the gift of God god knows what you have need of tonight and say Lord helped me to see you tonight I might there might be a veil here that is a Filipino but let me see Jesus tonight amen that's who I've come here to see that's who have come to have contact with is the Living God tonight amen so it's brother royal would come maybe as he's coming right now if we could let's just sing the song amen Amazing Grace amen I'll tell you day by day as I go on here's Grace it was amazing to me before but it's more amazing to me now amen it's so amazing amen not only that he could save me to take a life and then continue to mold and shape my life and my you talking about long-suffering you talking about his patience I've been one right here that can i think tell you God has patience God's long-suffering aren't you glad amen let's sing this Amazing Grace see grace how sweet the sound let's say wretch like me I once was lost [Music] I was blind now [Music] twas great was great [Music] [Music] a man like me thankful for Amazing Grace good to be now to the Lord thank the Lord he has brought us back me and my wife and we have been coming to this church for maybe about 20 years now and I want to say it's always been a blessing and I think by the peccato buddy Jim opening the door to me and then later on whether someone and I became good friends and he was just in the Philippines last year and while we had a wonderful time we invited Kerry they were a big blessing to our country the Saints in the Philippines and this year we are again in expectation because the Browning's are going to be coming over again in October the Brits are youth meetings we have what we call the Manila youth between the last week of October and then I also asked the brothers to it's our big convention of the year we have the biggest convention of the year November 1 being a holiday dopings being a Catholic nation November 1 it's All Saints Day so everybody goes to the cemetery except for the bride so we preferred to gather together at our place at our church and just hear the word of God minister ministered and praise the Lord together and so I greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ my Saints in light I which we call the Church of Dover cover they greet you matter of fact they're a lot of them are streaming the services now so and brothers in the Philippines they're extending their greetings to you by the Sam and the congregation here by the island Impero mother van and gay weather Rolando jens's and all those other brothers that you met last year in the Philippines they're happy to send their greetings with me to you than their Christian love to the Saints here in the Lorraine Scheffel and amen so the Lord just pleased upon my heart to just have a little Bible study if that's all right and we just go through the scriptures maybe some coats of the prophets oh and I'm going to speak about the subject which I entitled you are your brother's keeper this is a lesson on brotherly kindness hallelujah okay I don't see it on the screen it's okay okay it's not very clear but you probably really you are your brother's keeper lesson unbrotherly Camus and the Bible said in first John chapter 3 if you can all stand with me so we can read the word together I heard by the run desires in the audience god bless you been already looking forward to tomorrow amen we'll be at the service but run this place tomorrow I understand okay first John chapter 3 verse 11 and 12 people want to talk about the message this is the message verse 11 for this is the message that you've heard from the beginning that we should love one another in say men not as Cain who was of the wicked one of that wicked one and slew his brother and were forced lui him what was the reason his to his brother because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous go to another scriptures in Romans chapter 12 verse 10 to 13 this is st. Paul's admonition to the church he said be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love in honour preferring one another not trying to compete with one another but prefer one another when it comes to honor not slothful in business but fervent in the spirit serving the Lord how many knows how she served its other your aptly serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope patient in tribulation continuing instant in prayer and distributing to the necessity of the Saints that means anybody had a need you should be always a week be willing to help meet that need distributing the student message necessity of the Saints and given to hospitality who another scriptures Galatians chapter 5 verse 13 to 15 st. Paul said for brethren ye have been called unto Liberty only use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself but if you bite in the bar one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another these are the words of the Lord let's pray family father we now ask that you take this words take the service take your servant anoint this words the lips of your servant and to the minds and hearts of the audience Lord and we're just expecting a wonderful time in the service Lord and just ask that you give us the revelation of the words that we just read you want to thank you Lord and we ask that you come now and extend your hand and meet the need that is best represented in this service tonight for we want you to receive honor and glory in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray I mean thank you Lord we have a great responsibility to be our brother's keeper in this day and age were problem says we we now live in the darkest of all the ages the Bible says iniquity will abound in this age and the love of many shall wax cold in this age more than any other aids in the history of mankind but early kindness is needed the church is one thing this world is one thing kindness from people that believe God and we believe the word and you should be able to we should know our responsibilities as Christians we need to look after each other not only after each other but who Bible said the Lord said love your neighbor my - who is my neighbor church mates or just the masses believers are they our neighbors or do we consider the Baptist's the Methodists the Catholics our neighbors do or perhaps even the sinners out there in the world because I believe that we have a we received a perfect message from the Lord and this message he us brought us to a state of maturity and the mark of maturity for me is selflessness Philippians chapter 2 verse 4 says look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let's not be overly concerned about our own needs like we come to prayer meeting and we usually want to play pray for our own needs you know the bills we have to pay a tuition for the children you know medical services houses and cars the things that we need but a lot of times you forget the needs of others but if if a person is truly matured in the Lord has truly grown in faith and his spirituality he focuses less on himself and becomes he becomes Christ centered less and less of yourself and more and more more and more of Christ the RAM said is that said it like this you die to yourself and let the Holy Spirit live it's live its life through you hallelujah this is an overused quotation I would say but I'd like to read it once again God is calling us to live for others that bein Calgary where Bama said this he was just one man referring to the Lord Jesus the perfect man he gave his life and he made an example for you now what was what must we do now the first thing I want to say is Jesus never lived for himself his life was spent for others and that's perfectly eternal life when you say you go to church and you do good things that's fine but when you live your life to yourself you haven't got eternal life because eternal life is living for others that's how you know you got it it's because you spend your talents you expend your energies even you use your life to bless others to benefit others that's that's that's how you know you have received eternal life whose eternal life is living for others you are responsible for your brother as well the Bible states you're responsible for me and I'm responsible for you we should be our brothers keepers as Christians in Genesis chapter 4 and verse 9 going back to what happened to Cain and Abel after Cain slew Abel he killed his own brother the Lord asked him verse 9 and the Lord said unto Cain where is Abel thy brother and then he said I know not and my brother's keeper good question well in the first place God is going God is not going to ask Cain the question if he is not responsible for his brother he said but he the older one the more experienced one should we say huh and it should be looking after his brother but we saw what happened instead of looking after the welfare of his brother there was a lot of pride and a lot of jealousy and in which led to hatred and in the end he came killed his brother what was the reason the Bible gave it to us because his brothers work was righteous because of Abel's righteousness Cain became prideful and became envious and he was very jealous because God accepted his sacrifice God received his worship and rejected Cain you see what a bit but would have been the most the sense it the sensible thing to do is for Cain to Humble himself and ask his younger brother Abel Abel what happened I did my best to worship God but he did not receive my sacrifice how come he receive yours can you please share with me what did I do wrong that would have been the most sensitive sense a sensible thing to do right but he was lifted up in Pride and became very jealous of his brother to the point of hating him and he killed him right on the altar hallelujah added to that he denied his responsibility and lied to God I don't know where my brother Abel is and behind my brother's keeper can you imagine this God was speaking to Cain and Cain lied to God and even deny this responsibility that God entrusted to him to be eased to take to look after his brother said am I my brother's keeper of course there's no sense of asking you the question where is your brother Abel in the first place what's the sense of God asking me the question where's your brother Abel who which tells us that we are responsible for our brother we must not shun that responsibility that God has given to us to look after the welfare of our brother you are your brother's keeper whether you like it or not you have a responsibility to look after your brother look after his well-being the other responsibility to keep keep him away from harm and even defend him against this enemy against anybody who wants to harm him because you are your brother's keeper you need to see to it that your brother's needs are met you need to be a helper amen you need to be ready to come to the rescue of your brother every time he's in need hallelujah you are responsible in the Book of Luke chapter 22 verse 32 the Lord said about Peter Peter I prayed for thee I have prayed for they that they die faith they'll not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brother I think God is trying to tell us something here after you're converted that's after you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost because this was what was lacking in Peters life he was serving God he was you know he was praying for the sake and maybe preaching the gospel but he didn't have the Holy Ghost Alleluia it's a good thing that he still had faith and he was holding on to his faith it's a good thing that Jesus prayed for Peter hallelujah and I want to tell you the good news that Jesus prayed for you don't believe me look at John chapter 70 and read the whole chapter and Jesus actually prayed for you Alleluia oh I'm so glad that Jesus prayed for me like Peter amen he when he denied the Lord Jesus his faith was failing hallelujah but thank God that the Lord has prayed for him so that his fail his faith fail not aren't you happy that somebody paid for us hallelujah not just anybody but the Lord Himself prayed for us that our faith amen our faith our faith is our revelation God gave it to us in the first place how can it fail when God gave it to us hallelujah so praise God amen but it's not it's not enough to have faith amen and try to live a Christian life somebody told me I was talking to him the other day and said little well don't you think it's it's difficult in our day and age to live a truly Christian life and I said it's I'm sorry but it's not it's not difficult it's impossible it's impossible for us to live a Christian life without the Holy Ghost amen amen we need to have the Holy Ghost hallelujah I don't care if you have all the books I mean you have all the messages of the Prophet all the eleven thousand eleven eleven hundred messages I don't care if you if you can memorize memorize all the sermons you understand all mysteries the Bible says hallelu it will amount to nothing Alleluia you need to be born again you need to be baptized by the Holy Spirit into the body of Christ hallelujah that's the only way you can go in there's no other way fix the Holy Ghost to convert a person the pastor can't do that not even brother Branham can do that nobody can do that hallelujah but the Holy Ghost hallelujah the Holy Ghost can baptize you with a bit of power and the very life of God Alleluia and bring a true conversion amen so the Lord said after after your conversion after thou art converted Peter then you can strengthen your brothers do you say strengthen yourself and try to perfect yourself remember last time I told you I a piece of sermon called praying for the perfection of others because I don't care if you're perfected you think you're going in the rapture alone you need me to go in the rapture amen the RAM said it's not going to be a freak body it's not going to be missing a limb or missing a finger it's going to be a complete body all names that are written in the Lamb's Book of Life hallelujah we'll be in the rapture but they have to come to perfection not just you I need to come to perfection - you can't make it without me - we'll help me - well love me because you are responsible for me you are my keeper I am your keeper we need to watch after each other and look after one another it's a responsible responsibility hallelujah I hope you're enjoying this we're just reading the scriptures huh hallelujah yeah Colossians chapter 4 verse 12 to 13 it's about Epirus who is one of you Paul said a servant of Christ saluted you always laboring perfectly fervently for you in prayers that she may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God my what a ministry and Papa Roz laboring always laboring and fervently praying for you for what reason that she may stand perfect and complete hallelujah you know the will of God for I bear him record is verse Paul commending Epirus I bear him record that had he had a great feel for you and them that are in Laodicea and them in hierapolis there wasn't a pop Rah's that prayed for Saints in Laodicea you are the purposes of today and you need to be praying for the Saints in Laodicea doing the best that you can to help them hallelujah grow in the Lord that they may stand complete and perfect nothing short of perfection will make it there hallelujah God looks after the welfare of the least of us Emily knows that Matthew 25 verse 14 and the King shall answer and say unto them verily I say unto you inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these of my brethren ye have done it unto me God Christ Jesus looks after the welfare of the least of us and then we want to be the best and the biggest and the smartest the most Revelator the most gifted hallelujah we want to be the best but Jesus is looking for the least amongst us and what you do whatever you do to help the least amongst the body of Christ the least of these my brethren brother Branham said in one coat that would have been me the least in the body would have been me hallelujah hallelujah if you did it to me you did it unto God Galatians chapter 6 verse 10 says and as we have therefore opportunity what an opportunity we have it today amen you won't have it after the rapture you won't have it in the Millenium this is your opportunity Alleluia as we have therefore opportunity let us do good and to message believers it says let us do good and to all men especially and to them who are of the household of faith oh not just church mates not just people in the message but all men but especially people in the message especially church space especially Christians Philby the Holy Spirit because they are our brothers and sisters are you listening they are our neighbors hallelujah Paul demonstrated this love for his brother for for a brother brotherly kindness in tell him on chapter 1 verse 15 to 18 if you're acquainted with the story of onesimus am i right and they suppose he was a runaway slave he actually stole from his master and he got caught in Gaudin in prison that's where Paul met him in prison and Paul started to share with him about the gospel of salvation and he received the word and he became a changed person and now he became converted verse 15 says for perhaps therefore departed for a season that thou should have received him forever he was writing this letter to Philemon Aneesa was mastered hallelujah because he onesimus has wrongfully won he said Paul was trying to explain he departed for a season that thou should receive him forever Oh hallelujah there's a reason why he departed hallelujah so that he can come back to you and you can receive him forever hallelujah we're talking about eternity here hallelujah verse 16 not now as a servant but above a servant a brother beloved he became a convert he didn't used to have a spirit of price hallelujah but in priests and he received the Spirit of Christ and now Paul was returning or neza was to Philemon now he is a brother hallelujah not don't receive him as a servant anymore but above a servant a brother beloved especially to me but how much more unto thee both in the flesh and in the Lord if the house can't be there for a partner of mine Paul was filaments partner hallelujah you are my partner I believe but assemble is my partner hallelujah you should've seen us work together in Samarra come by oh come on we're partners together in the gospel in the Lord's vineyard hallelujah Paul was saying if you consider me a partner if he can't be there for a partner receive him as myself oh my receive a criminal receive somebody that robbed me well if you are my partner you should love me I should be welcome in your home if I'm your partner hallelujah and Paul was saying a nation which has become a brother he's no longer a servant eaten did him not as a servant anymore but treat him the way you treat me hallelujah we are on equal footing now because he has become a brother hallelujah therefore receive him as she received myself oh my what a commendation this criminal this rascal hallelujah is as good as me now do you verse 18 if he has wronged thee look at Paul's kindness or all the art put that on my account oh my if he owed you anything I'll pay for it that's the Christ in paws hallelujah he paid the debt that he did not owe and we owe the debt that we could not pay Christ Jesus paid at all on the cross hallelujah at the cross he paid it all glory to God hallelujah he did listen he did not just pay the down payment and expect us to pay a monthly amount motorization for the rest of our lives and work our way into heaven now it was paid in full paid in full hallelujah if you think your brother OSHA's something charge it to my account Jesus said receive your brother as she would receive me this is the Commission now I'm trying to tell you how grave your responsibility is to receive your brother I should receive Christ my regardless of church affiliation let me just rip the the the fonts are a little small but we can I can read it for you well one said thirsting for life 1960 if we can discern the spirit of one another and realize if a man comes in I don't care what church he belongs to if he's got the Spirit of God on him he's my brother I say amen to that Alleluia hallelujah he doesn't have to belong to my church he doesn't have to belong to a church the fellowships with me hallelujah a church that doesn't differ with me in my understanding of the doctrine if he's got the Spirit of God he's my brother oh my I love this hallelujah and I don't care how great he is how intellectual he is how powerful he can speak if there's if he's trying to receive the wrong thing I don't believe it's my brother yet but it's what he's trying to do if he's trying to save souls or do something for God that's a brother who my god help us to accept a man

this is the right teaching it's kind of hard for foreign minister to do that because if I if I'm sitting in the congregation I would be asking how sure are you now that you've got the right thing amen so what they did they open their pulpit wide to us message preachers and so we go there visit their churches on a regular basis and minister to them the message of the hour little by little until they come to an understanding but the message is all about hallelujah and out of the 60 churches had opened their doors to us 24 of them are now solidly believing the truth of this message glory to God I thought men assembled that's not a bad number that's not a bad person taste at all 24 out of 60 and we have led hundreds of congregations from denomination in this way hallelujah you think we can do this without the Holy Ghost No hallelujah and so we give him all the glory they give him all the honor because he's the one that's doing this amen hallelujah let's continue on he said seventy three churches sponsoring my meetings and they had a great meeting going on and I had a brother setting on the appropriate Oh up on the platform and a district press Peter called me that day and he said I resent that Bell Bell Oh what did bad random dude I resent that better when you had a man on the platform that was baptised world he said how could you do that and badman said why or the man said why why did you do that I said her mom said well it's my brother are you listening a man that's been baptized wrong and bourbon calls him my brother and lets him on the prophet or on the platform of his meeting and he was reprimanded for it and somebody resented it that he did it said why why what did you do it I said his he said he's he's my brother a submission I did it he's my brother the presbytery might be thinking he's a devil this man was a devil when Bannerman was saying he's my brother I want you to know he's my brother that's why I left him standing on the appropriate or on the platform with me because that's my brother I said now he said you know what we done oh this was just a fad now this press Peter was threatening by Braille he said we've draw the line and cut you out from among sense we will no longer sponsor your meetings you're not one of us anymore we draw a circle and rolled you out and I said now I'm going to draw a little line above you and cut you back in again I said I bring why you're my brother I'm riding on it I don't care what they believe I believe that Jesus Christ is not divided all one body we won in Hope and doctrine won in charity I think we're seeing that a lot in this church how long do you on what Christian soldier right Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever I'm riding on it hallelujah I guess by now you understand what I'm driving at but early kindness be kind to one another love one another serve one another hallelujah because if you devour one another now Paul was not talking about literal devouring you know I don't think people were eating one another during post time but II Men character assassination even speaking evil about each other hallelujah but biting all the jealousies and envy hallelujah all the grudges against one another hallelujah oh my I think of the message movement as I read this verse if you devour one another here who do you expect to help you you've already devoured your brother if you devour one another then who else can help us tell me hallelujah as the recent Bevin said if you have nothing good to say about your brother it's better to zip your lip up be quiet don't say anything at all because if you destroy your brother's honor you're destroying yourself the one who can help you you're trying to devour him oh my goodness you're supposed to protect him and support him and defend this integrity because this your brother Murr I mean messes fellowship said I have learned to love brother Joseph he meant butter Joseph Jose here's what I like about him many things first being a Christian brother second you can depend on what he says I like it I like a man when he tells you anything he'll stand by it don't you like that kind of a person it says something he stands by it another thing is he's my friend whether I'm right or wrong oh my I'd like to have friends like that you have a word in English I think you called you call them Fairweather friends they're only your friends as long as you're right as long as the weather is right you know people you know how are complaining because of the heat there's a heat wave there's a warning against heat wave supposed to strike tonight today tomorrow a couple of days but I love this kind of weather I love it hallelujah amen I don't like Fairweather friends I'll do it hmm whether I'm right or wrong but mom said this is what I like about butter Joseph whether I'm right or wrong he's my friend now anybody can be your friend while you are right can you relate to this as long as you're right assume you're alright you're okay you're doing nothing wrong they're your friends anybody can be a friend when you're in the right but when you're in the wrong then his steel your friend now that's not all times that I am right and I wonder about people in the message that think better Benham do not come did not commit any mistakes everyone said I'm not always in the right I'm not always in the right you know big the biggest part of time of the time I'm perhaps around I didn't say it but I'm said it the biggest part of the time perhaps I am wrong but whether I'm wrong or right josepho say is my friend I have seen him in his hard trials and I've seen him in his time when the public knows nothing about when he comes up against testing time he's always stood by my side like a brother and I appreciate that very much Oh hallelujah don't you appreciate friends that that will stay with you even if you're wrong I'll do it you appreciate them don't you but when other people other other believers are in the wrong you're very quick to keep away from them you want people to befriend you even if you're wrong but when other people are in the wrong you don't want anything to do with that I'm telling you that's not brotherly kindness but mommy didn't do that but even I appreciate brother Joseph bow say because even though he's in the wrong is fixed by him too thick or thin because it's a brother message believers that good are good at rebuking good approving people around we were wrong to do this you're wrong to do that it's the right way to do go about doing things we're so good we've mastered the art of proving people wrong but the book of Galatians says yes rebuke people who are in the wrong but also try to restore them listen brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault here with our spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of what meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted we are not always right brothers in sisters in the church may sometimes be wrong like better Benham most of the time they may be wrong but what do you do with they're wrong when they commit a mistake or when they're at the fall hallelujah well st. Paul said if your spiritual you're supposed to restore your brother no this is the instruction for people who are spiritual of course Connor people don't do this they crucify people who are in the wrong they shame them they'd Estela tip them they call them they call them all kinds of bad names evil names hallelujah but Paul said restore such a man in the spirit of witness neatness considering thyself that thou also be them tempted lest thou also be tempted in other words do it in humility I'm finding people find it hard to receive that they're in the wrong when the person telling them that they're in the wrong are not doing it it's not doing it in the spirit of meekness you know you can rebuke a brother in the spirit of love because truth always hurts amen but you can speak the truth in love the Bible says speak the truth in love we believe the message is the truth but I know a lot of people that don't speak the message in love they're speaking the message in pride in yourself righteousness not in the spirit of meekness they are Carla I thought I told better I thought better Sam you know I know a lot of people that grow grow in the knowledge of our Savior Jesus Christ but the Bible said grow in grace first grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Savior Jesus Christ people forget about grace if you come next Sunday this coming Sunday maybe that would be my message the message of grace but may God help us to grow in grace first before we grow in the knowledge and of our Savior Jesus Christ before we grow in the knowledge of all the mysteries the deep teachings in the Messick's holiday first we need to grow in grace for all you know you you have not received the message if not for the grace of God [Applause] verse two says bear ye one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ what bear your brother sins bear your brother shame don't be ashamed to be identified to your brother when he's in the wrong your brother needs company in its comfort he needs enlightenment you need somebody to share with him encourage him hallelujah amen bear one another's burden don't be selfish think about your own burden your own trials and problems in life you forget about your brother but we have a commission to bear one another's burdens this is the way we fulfilled the law of what the law of Christ this is not the law of Moses this is the law of Christ is that the Old Testament this is the New Testament hallelujah this is a better Testament Alleluia forgive and restore fellowship snatcher of a perfect man but ban said when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter oh my you're quick to condemn because you don't know what the person is going through but perhaps he committed something wrong he made the wrong decision hallelujah because he's going through some of the hardest trials in life and the way to do it Berman said put yourself in place in his place on the matter where his shoes know where he's coming from try to understand the brother hallelujah my brother sin against me said Peter shall I forgive him he said seven times a day Peter thought that was a lot shall I forgive him seven times Lord listen but seventy times seven 490 times a day we're talking about brotherly kindness here some of us can only be kind to a brother up to a certain point okay you did it to me trice already you can you can do it to me again five times it's too much but the Lord said 490 times you have to forgive your brother every day Oh may God help us may God help us I need that brotherly kindness in my life he said seventy times seven see brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is all out of tune don't be impatient with him see be kind to him go anyhow that works but remember suppose was saying go and fellowship with him help the brother tells him what he's doing wrong tell him where he's out of the world go anyway hallelujah the hardest person to deal you know I was a I learned a choir in the beginning when I first started out in ministry because there was no choir director we had no musicians no we I was just doing it everything by myself I was this song leader I was the minister I was a Sunday school teacher I was the choir director and the hardest person to deal with is the man that tries his best to sing but they stone death brother branham says when the brother is all out of tune what do you need to do don't be impatient with him he'll catch on amen just don't be impatient it's be kind to the brother don't count him out as yet be patient hallelujah hallelujah at the end of the day he'll catch on he'll be singing in tune oh yeah Birnbaum said brotherly kindness is the virtue for the age at first I was thinking this was for John Wesley's age because John versus AIDS was the AIDS of Philadelphia and Philadelphia means brotherly kindness the love of bredrin so I thought Bobby the kindness was for John Wesley's age but better Berman said differently in a message statue of a perfect man he said after Columba the Dark Ages come in there and then comes Sardis which meant death Luther hallelujah what then what come next after Sardis Luther then comes filler dope Philadelphia godliness worsley holiness just the just shall live by faith sale said Luther sanctification through Wesley and then come in brotherly kindness through the Laodicea so in laodicea this was what God is still God is looking for God is working in the hearts of people hallelujah so that they can be kind to one another they can begin to love their brothers hallelujah then come in brotherly kindness rule day you Tasya and if we believe the great message of the second appeal of Elijah in the last days shall sweep the land this great message shall sweep the land when in Laodicea what is the virtue for the Aged brotherly kindness hallelujah in the most sinful age in the darkest of all the ages when the iniquity shall abound and the love of many shall wax cold Matthew 24:12 brotherly kindness is needed in this age do you care for your brother the steamiest names but mom said now you might say look I sure don't like brother Nevel or I sure don't like brother Jones I don't like better so-and-so and something like that but just let something happen to him brother your heart is broke it just nearly kills you see we can obtain brotherly kindness and feeling for one another you have taught me to be honest there's people in our church that we don't understand perhaps you don't express it but in your heart you think oh here comes this brother again I just hate him with a passion I just hate the way he dresses the way he speaks the way he reasons out I just hate everything about him the RAM says you might think you might say I hate but I don't I don't like better than ever I don't like Barbara Jones and so on and so forth I don't but let's something happen to him if the brother meets an accident in a car wreck maybe maybe or or he he hasn't he suffers a stroke or a heart attack and is confined in the hospital your heart is broke amen it's alright to have feelings sometimes as human beings we have ill feelings we don't understand each other perfectly we have differences purposes it's alright hallelujah but that that doesn't that shouldn't keep us from loving our brothers and sisters in Christ something happens to them your heart is broke hallelujah that's how you know you have brotherly kindness if your brother is hurting your heart is hurting too if a family rejoices because something good happens to their family you are rejoicing with them too I'll do it something bad happens your heart is broke that's when you know you feel for your brother how do we why that's familles name blasphemous name but one said why do you care for that brother because you broke bread with him here at the author I sure will tonight you fellowship with him you shook his hands you worship with him he is your brother and he might do something in the flesh that you would disagree with because he's just kind of saying which you ought not to do but you shut him a little I wanna I wanna hear you say Amen hey I'm I am I speaking to normal people here I'm I am addressing human beings here hallelujah it's normal we shine him a little because it did something wrong we didn't like what he did either you show me shed him a little bit but one said but we which you ought not to do but in the bottom of your heart if something happened to your brother for the dead brother it just nearly kills you or that sister I hope that's the way you feel hallelujah amen don't young the brother or the sister just because he's a little wrong he said in the outer turn God is able to correct that and who knows if God wants to use you to correct that but how are you going to correct it if you share him you cut your fellowship from the brother or sister don't call him and don't touch him don't want anything to do with him because you don't just usually dislike him no from the bottom in the bottom of your heart if something happened to that brother it would just nearly kill you or that sister why because you'd take communion with him amen you wash one another's feet you worship with him like we worship tonight all together in under one spirit under one anointing under one message hallelujah under the banner of the name of the Lord Jesus hallelujah that your brother that your sister hallelujah if anything bad happens to any of them you'll feel bad it will just nearly kill you hallelujah that's why better burn in in standing in the in the gap I hope you're not still not being bored are still enjoying this just a few slides don't lose the feeling for the people that's the key to brotherly kindness pray that God will place into my heart that's something I lost out here in that complex he was saying this about himself but when I'm built a complex because he was hurt so much by what people say or see here so he developed a complex it is so easy to build a complex relabel says if you're honest you may not realize it but you have built yourself a complex go back and check it with the scripture and see this right or not and go from there yeah don't lose the feeling of the people see you must remember they are not made out of sawdust your brother's not made out of sawdust they have feelings the same as you do have feelings they are made of flesh and blood they are human beings and they have a soul within them oh my hallelujah thank you better burn all things speech in 1962 if you'd come seeking the Holy Spirit and let him let let the the faith that you've got in him add to that virtue and to that what brotherly kindness second Peter chapter 1 verse 7 until you're built in the full stature of Christ and then the last thing that is that the last thing is love with God the Holy Spirit seals you to your destination stature of a perfect man amen are your waist aware that the statue of a perfect man is the statue of Christ there's no other perfect man but came statue of the perfect Christ but all these features hallelujah can be in a person when he is born again hallelujah you can be like Jesus you can have all these virtuous Alleluia some people like to work into these virtues like one of em said it's a lather and a lot of people they they want to work into this virtuous Word so that they can have faith word so that they can have a virtue and knowledge and patience and all these mergers but if you think about it how can you work faith how can you work your way into faith think about it all these churches they come to you by the grace of God by the power of the Holy Spirit by the power of the resurrection of Jesus Christ you don't work your way into anything this all happens by grace and the Spirit of God is the one to and do you with this virtuous hallelujah don't talk to me about a God power when you can even love your brother and you cannot impersonate it it's got to be real in you but one said you cannot impersonate you can impersonate it but as I said last night it's just like a blackbird booting pick up feathers in his wings and saying see I'm a peacock but he just added them and pushed them in and who here he's a fake pika Alleluia if there is something on the inside of him made him push them out he that will be a peacock certainly but some people are trying to do something to look like somebody somebody else or impersonate somebody else because they thought they did it and you see what it does it brings us back into a red wall and form again this message has brought out us out of denominationalism it brought us out - amen traditional religion rituals and forms hallelujah but we see it again in churches we see it again divisions brother tearing down a brother a preacher tearing down a fellow minister hallelujah but we try our best sometimes we took they try to put feathers colorful feathers so that we can look as the bride of Jesus Christ it don't work that way if you're just forcing yourself into it it's not doing you any good but urban cultures just withdrawal and form it's the blood the life that electrifies and sanctifies your life that's right whom I thank God for the blood of Jesus hallelujah oh look at this I have a few slides left look I want you to look at this quotation the comforter has been better been who said it he was praying he said and father from the depths of my heart I forgive every enemy oh my goodness he's not talking about people in the Vatican these are talking about Baptist Methodist and people in the denomination when it says enemy it says forgive my enemy Lord teach me in my heart let me forgive my enemy Oh God I could go to them lovely in my heart and was there washed their feet and do anything that I could just so they don't miss the glorious sweet by-and-by look at this caught Asian look at the Prophet the Prophet praying to God God changed my heart teach me to forgive my enemy it's the spirit me he doesn't it didn't mean people outside the church because he said teach me so I can wash their feet he's talking about people in the church right in this assembly people that that hold communion with him people that fellowship and worship with him people that he washes the feet of during communion if it washing her spirit was Lord helped me to forgive my enemy I think of Jesus knowing Judas but that was the very demon that would betray him he washed his feet and wiped it with a towel prayed for him just like the rest of the disciples oh my goodness everyone said Lord give me that heart give me that hallelujah teach me to to forget my enemy hallelujah are you listening what if I was talking about people that are perceived to be enemies in the church they're not really your enemies they're only perceived to be your enemies I mean no Judas was a real enemy he was a devil but brother banner was praying for people who he's able to wash their feet Oh think about it people in his own Assembly his friends doesn't misunderstand him but he doesn't understand hallelujah he said God teach me to forgive me and me teach me O God to be able to wash their feet and love my brothers and sisters what was the reason it's not for my own sake of God I want to do this I will humble myself before them and do them service so that they don't listen it's not for me it's for them there's no greater love than this then a man lay down his life for his friends John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life Jesus fulfilled this case amen John 3:16 Jesus fulfilled this but we have to fulfill this one first John 3:16 it's not hard to memorize John 3:16 first John 3:16 let's read it hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for own families for own selves we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren you need to do what Jesus did that was the ultimate sacrifice Jesus did on the cross hallelujah he redeemed us I want with I won't read that verse but I would read this one Township Redemption Alabam said a man as a soul and therefore that soul is a part of God and even in its fallen state yet it's the most greatest specie of all the species of the earth is the man and then get him in connection with his maker he becomes a Superman oh this is powerful an ordinary man becomes a Superman when you get him connected to his maker hallelujah almost because he's the son of God he becomes acquainted with his maker with a creator of all things and when that man they're acquainted with his maker becomes a part of his maker he comes back he comes back into fellowship with his maker every divine word becomes a living reality to him and they believe so that's why you you know I think of the the tribe people who we work with there's a lot of them I can name probably about 30 churches tribal churches where you have to there's no other way to get to the places where where they live to the churches that we started where they go to church but to walk 13 hours walking up the mountain you have to cross the swamps up the hill cats amen braved the snakes you know and whatever wild animal is out there in the forest to reach these people 13 hours you have to stop and sleep in a certain point and continue on the next day to reach these people and when we reach these people they don't they hardly have clothes they don't even have sufficient food they don't have education they don't know hygiene in the Philippines there called marginalized people and I look at that word marginalize you know they're some kind of people of less importance people that the society doesn't benefit from they're worthless people in other words hallelujah but do you realize that these people have souls that were created in the image and likeness of God and all that's needed to happen is for death to be connected to their maker and they become Superman hallelujah if believing every promise of God Amen that's close with this thank you for your help brother BAM said divine healing and I appreciate many of you people are poor people and tonight you probably may be put in there put in the last nickel in hand that's on the offering on that great day when we stand up there at the judgment seat of Christ and you hear those heathens screaming when I after he hear my name called and I got to come up and stand stand on the tape recording will be played and the screen will show it all in some of those natives and heathens from other countries saying all better Brennan if you hadn't have come I'd have been lost and then God will look down on you and say you were the one for attention think about it that's great that's better banners ministry I mean in the Philippines there's probably at least 8,000 believers there 10,000 believers eight to ten thousand believers in the Philippines I heard in Uganda there was about 28,000 came to water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in Uganda there's a revival taking place even in the nation called China there are two hundred groups at least that believe this message in our country hallelujah there are a thousand bellissimo met them they're little people they're black people but there are our bridge ins there are the original Filipino people hallelujah that don't know their right from their left they don't have a education they don't even know the basic hygiene hallelujah but they have souls and they heard the message of grace and they received the word and they became connected to their maker hallelujah and they became Superman hallelujah they became a part of the bride of Jesus Christ but that David one says hallelujah when they call my name when my name is called and and and probably it's given its reward the heathens will say if you hadn't come you wouldn't have heard this message it would have been lost and God would look at you wherever I'm said look at you the ones that supported the work you're the ones that sent me your doors are sent by the random you may have not seen and Negrito or an ayah but a symbol has met some of them you may not see how they look how they dress how they smell you don't know I need an idea but praise God they are your brothers because they heard the word if you see the same message that you receive and we want to give God all the praise and honor and glory or what is doing I don't have the energy to go on so please come take the service god bless you pray for us amen we will be visiting some more churches but under 20th August we'll be heading back home to continue the work of the Lord you are responsible for your brothers and sisters you are your brothers thank you and God bless you [Applause] have you been challenged you know these are we just had read through some of these scriptures on Sunday and you know when Paul says in Colossians 3 put on therefore as the elect of God holy bowels of Mercy and that whole phrases we were looking at there on Sunday put on means sink into sea by being born again of the Spirit of God we have an access the humility in our heart to be able to humble ourselves and sink in to this garment of humility boughs of mercy forgiveness long-suffering you know just as I mentioned the here on Sunday there is no way that a person can do this without the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost gives us power to submit ourselves you know even in times when we know we're dead wrong you're with me now even when we know we're wrong but yet when there's something there on the inside that says that's not right there's a strength on the inside we can just yield to Jesus he's in the ship we just need him to step forth amen yield to him and he takes - he takes control say brother sent me what do you mention this is why we need a refilling of the Holy Ghost every day of our life because we cannot forgive we cannot have humility we cannot do any of these things just by simple mental recognition we need him when we see something in the word like what came tonight to us and how God would speak so plainly though the reality when the word comes and challenges our heart it should bring us the place to say lord I need more of you I see where I am and I see where I need to be I need more of you and he's the one the supernatural God the Living God the power of the Resurrection to bring us from where we are to where we need to be you know I thought about this with the with what was spoken here tonight and no matter what might be that we you have been through or I have been through here's where it comes down the things that brother Branham was mentioning here and through the scriptures this is the thing that you can we can really look at is it our desire to see this fulfilled in our life it's not about what our feelings are right now there's not one person in here who says I enjoy being wronged not one of us we're not being honest we don't we don't we don't look at and say oh I don't bother me what people think you're lying it does bother us it matters it's the reason we say that many times is because of pride we get into a place of saying well I'll just say this so it don't seem so bad the reality is if we can just be honest with God because just like we like somebody to say hey that was wonderful you did a good job just as much as that encourages us the same thing the other when someone says that was terrible we need we need the grace of God and I would say it like this you know as the Holy Spirit brought it here tonight in Galatians 6 bear you one another's burdens you know that's the first thing that that brother branham he used that scripture through the hebrew series you're aware of it he used that scripture when we go to one another and we go to one another in Christian love and we're long-suffering with a brother or sister and then brother Brown will use that in Galatians 6 if that brother or sister will not heed to that correction then that's when we go to matthew 16 are you with me that's when because they won't heed to the love of god that's reaching out to try to correct them but oh my how where our heart as a believer it reaches out to one another i'll tell you my desire is not to correct people is that your desire y'all with me i know i know it's it's we've been here some time but it's been good ain't it i don't get joy out of correcting people matter of fact you know there's things when i sit around with brothers or different ones at the table there might be something said that's a little bit wrong and maybe they didn't finish this just right but let's go on and have fellowship amen let's go on I'm not there to try to censor everything that one another saying you didn't finish that quote just right you didn't finish that scripture just right but we're there to exalt the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I believe one thing if we can see one another's hearts say God help me to know the heart of one another then we can have a little bit more long-suffering amen don't you love the Lord amen I just tonight I think this would be good in this moment right here I'd say Lord let this be fulfilled in my life let it be fulfilled in my life to all men you know God allows situations to come up when it says forgive one another's as Christ as God for Christ's sake has forgiven us we say Amen to the word haw amen well God has to allow situations to come up to say here's the practice here's the practice say lord help me Lord Jesus Lord I need more of you Lord I need more of you amen amen how many would say Lord I want a trip to Calvary tonight I want more of the love of God poured out in my solenoid amen let's just could we just stand and maybe as you're standing next to your family or brother or sister or brother to brother or sister to sister could we just lay hands on one another and let's just really pray earnestly pray for that brother pray for that sister that you have your hands on maybe it's a husband and wife maybe it's just your brother or your sister in the Lord but less as a sister to the sister or so forth let's just really earnestly pray you pray for that one you have your hand on Lord let the love of God so fill their heart as they're praying for you Lord Jesus dear God your word has come father by the unction of your spirit tonight Lord
