heavenly father we come before you lord god we're all vessels of clay on the potter's wheel this morning father even lord people may not realize god but what you've given me to speak lord jesus is just as much for me as it is for them father so i ask you lord to help us god i pray that you would mold us and make us into your likeness this morning god whatever you'd have for us whether it be correction or encouragement or whatever it be god i ask you lord let our hearts be open to receive from you god and i pray that only your true word father would come forth from my lips and into the people's hearts god not something i would rot lord but something you rot in your people grant it lord i pray bless this congregation now bless brother sam while he's away in jesus christ's name amen amen god bless you this morning most of us are familiar with each other but um it sure looks from up here like you all have grown so that's a good good thing to see um and uh you know i was just thinking this might be an odd odd thing for a visiting minister to say but i just is is the one that does the housekeeping around here here this morning who does the housekeeping it's a group okay i just wanted to compliment you all every time i come here this is one of the cleanest buildings and i just want to say thank you because sometimes a lot of times they don't want to be acknowledged but um you know they're doing things behind the scenes that nobody ever sees and and i just want to let you know uh strangely i'm not looking for it i'm not in the back with a white glove but i just i just want to give you a compliment and tell you thank you for doing such a wonderful job on the house of god god bless you each one participating for it so if you would open the numbers 22 chapter 22 and verse 41 of numbers and we just want to bring greetings from brother paul lafontaine and the church back home and for those of you who don't need me that don't know me i'm i i'm not much so i don't have much of an introduction but just helping serve with brother paul back home um as an assistant uh as his assistant and just doing all we can so um brother sam's been a real blessing to us and it always seems i know i know he don't go and listen to our services but every time he comes brother paul especially he'll be on a series brother sam comes in and just caps the whole thing just finishes it right off and brother paul just say well that caps that one you know i mean it's just to me it's it's a work of the holy spirit and i and i don't know if you've noticed this but if you watch the the the ministry there's there's some mighty things going on not just in the word that they're bringing forth but if you watch their lives there's something they're going deeper and if and if you know if you know how this works in the economy of god if they're going deeper you watch and your life will go deeper as well because they're leading the charge amen so get behind your pastor i always i have a heart for the pastors and helping them any way i can so get behind him support him support the word support him with your presence here and i could just go on and on in those things but we'll we'll go to the word here numbers 22 41 i'm going to bounce around a little bit just to lay a foundation and it came to pass on the morrow that balak took balaam and brought him up into the high places of baal and fence he might see the utmost which is the end part of the people and then if you could go to numbers 23 and verse 13. 23 and verse 13 and balak said unto him come i pray thee with me unto another place from whence thou mayest see them thou shalt see but the utmost part of them and shall not see them all and curse me them from thence now i want to go to verse 16. and the lord met balaam and put a word in his mouth and said go on again unto balak and say thus and when he came to him behold he stood by his burnt offering in the princes of moab with him and balak said unto him what hath the lord spoken and he took up his parable and said rise up balak and hear hearken unto me thou son of the poor god is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent hath he said and shall he not do it or hath he spoken and shall he not make it good behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed and i cannot reverse it he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob neither hath he seen perverseness in israel the lord his god is with him in the shout of a king is among them god brought them out of egypt and he hath as it were the strength of a unicorn surely there is no enchantment against jacob neither is there any divination against israel according to this time it shall be said of jacob and of israel what hath god wrought and notice that's not a question that's an exclamation mark behold the people shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey and drink the blood of the slain i want to turn over real quick to john 15 john chapter 15 verse 15. jesus speaking says henceforth i call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth but i have called you friends for all things that i have heard of my father i have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you let's pray one more time lord jesus we ask you god to just take your word now and plant it in our hearts help me god to get fully out of the way that you could speak i ask it in jesus christ's name amen amen you can be seated i know i'm reading a lot of scriptures here at the beginning but i just want to read one more ephesians 5 because i just want to lay a foundation for what i have on my heart and this is really speaking everything that i want to say here but we'll just expound a little bit ephesians 5 verse 25 brothers i added this one in the back so sorry about that husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it and i thought well we could take a sermon on that and switch gears but we'll just leave that alone but notice as christ also loved the church and he gave himself for it verse 26 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish notice he's going to watch over this bride so closely that one day he's going to present himself a glorious church he's going to present himself a church and if he's going to present the church to himself he's saying here i'm going to provide the work that's going to present the church in this way and so i want to take a thought this morning and i and i didn't have a title until the back and i don't even know that it's a good title but i want to call it a work god hath wrought despite the utmost parts and we'll go into this further a work god hath wrought despite the utmost parts and um a brother gave me a book i'm a bit of a perfectionist um a bit as a is quite an understatement i'm a pretty big perfectionist i like i just like things now you're going to think well he was in the back with a white glove i promise i wasn't i'm a big perfectionist and and and uh you know it's got it's it's blessings it's curses it's good it's bad and and i i expect a lot of myself sometimes that extends to others i i just i just have a lot of times too high of expectations and when you're that built that way uh you set yourself up for a lot of disappointment too so um so a brother i was talking with him just just having some fellowship and he said well i i got this book a couple years ago he said i'll give it to you well he ordered it and it was a used book and so he handed it to me and he said i just want to let you know i the highlights in it were not mine for you he said they were it was a used book they were there before but it's it's about this perfectionist and i'm a slow reader and things so i i'm not too far in it but something that's really spoken to me that so far as the guy laying a foundation the author is and he's saying you know we live we live in a world that is is expects perfection it's it sets a bar of perfection that is very difficult to reach whether it's in your your job uh your job may set a standard of perfection that you know really you just you can't do anything to please the boss nothing you do is going to be good enough or what you do you know it hey that's great but let's do better you know the company is always going to be looking for how we can do better and you know if you're a business owner i i guess that's what makes a successful company but you know you have a world of of it's it's competing for things and unless you set a bar of perfection that's way up here you're not going to be used very much because people are demanding perfection because they have things like you know the the the you know fixer-upper show and and uh joanna gaines and all these things and and you know you have you have fashion that is is expecting perfection out of you if you wear something that's a little outdated you're looked at funny you know you got to keep up with the times you got you know and my goodness you know brothers and sisters as christians will never meet that bar because we're just old-fashioned anyway in in the way we believe in things and the way we dress is so they say um i i think that you know a sister that dresses modest is a beautiful thing in the sight of god and should be in the side of man but you know it's just an appreciation that we have for our sister so thank you sisters for dressing modestly and don't feel like you have to go out and reach that bar because you know one thing you'll never attain it it's always moving but the second is that's not true beauty anyway what you see in in the magazines and things in in in fashion world that's all it's either airbrushed on or it's computer it generated and so it sets this this this vision before you of perfection that is just listen it's it's fake it's fake perfection you'll never accomplish it because they take it and they throw it through a computer and that's what they do with it magazines set the it's it's a perfect picture it's it's so perfect they but they set it up that way that wasn't you know that that lady had to clean her house and and pick up the the kids toys in the yard before they could even take that picture and maybe they bring things in and set things up to to add a little bit to it to make it look so perfect and appealing to you and then you have you know this the the models and things you have hollywood and in in the news you have the news in in in in politics you know politics with this whole covet thing you'll you'll never and now you know now i hear of people you know they'll beat you up if you if you're not complying with the the standards and things that you know it's just it's just the times we live in and it's and it's a bar of perfection that you you just you'll never you'll you'll you'll meet it and then it'll move and if you meet it again it'll move again and so sometimes as family members you know again i mean being a perfectionist sometimes as a father i can demand i can extend that perfection on my children or my wife i can and you know we do that to our families we can do it in the church we can expect perfection out of out of imperfect people you're dealing with imperfect people in an imperfect world despite what the front satan wants to put on it but it's it's a perfection that that you you're you're expecting out of imperfect things so we put high expectations on ourselves which as i said it sets us up for for many disappointments can you say amen so we went on we went on a vacation and and you know i'm just going to drive this home a little bit we went on a vacation and you know we're sitting there we're camping and as we're sitting around the campfire you're watching you know trucks and campers go out you know and you're kind of admiring and things and i don't know what it was but it was like all the trucks and campers that pulled in afterwards got bigger and newer and nicer and better and you know it was a real test in uh uh discontentment it was you know the there's you know it's it's i i'd like to have a truck i've been wanting a truck for some time but just different circumstances and things and finances you know you try to get it all set up just right but then you know well maybe i can settle for something a little bit less than what i want but then you see something like you know the brand new f350 pull in pull in a four-story camper and you're like man that'd be good to have you know but it but you know it sets this bar that really i mean i'm not it's not out of god's reach but really it's out of my means right now and so i could go buy that but i'd have to you know sell my home and go live strictly in that but you know you you but you there's a feeling in this world i've always you gotta keep up with the joneses you gotta you know somebody you know somebody in the church gets a new vehicle and you're like man i'd sure like that you know and then and then your your eyes become you know it kind of becomes the star in your eyes and you know you're just you didn't realize how hard that they've worked or how long you know young brothers that brothers you know in his 50s 60s he's put in his time and and he deserves the truck now you know so uh don't don't try to match up you know i think i said it last time to the young couples you know you'll spend the first five years this is a dave ramsey thing he said you'll spend the first five years trying to live up to the standard to to where your parents are but the problem is is you didn't see everything that they had to go through because you were blind to it growing up because mom and dad just provided it you just got to enjoy it so you want to can take that enjoyment and continue that into your marriage but you don't realize you're not thinking that that took them a long time i'm really preaching to myself here getting convicted you know that took a long time for them to get to so you know brothers and sisters my my young friends you know just keep keep going forward keep keep doing what you're doing and and you know pray and god will bless you it might not be today you might have to settle for something that that might be in our to what we want less but you know just just keep going at it and god will bless you with it one day he said seek ye first the kingdom of god and then these things will be added unto you so seek that first my young brother and sister be faithful in the little things and god will bless you and much so and i want to encourage you to i'm kind of all over the place but i just i've had a lot on my my mind here lately but you know getting to take this little time of rest you know it was a it was it was a time to really unplug and and you know in this age of perfection and along those lines you know i want to encourage each of us young and old and ministry the the ones in the back the ones cleaning the church the ones you know just whatever you're doing if you if you if you don't necessarily have a job in the church and you just come and you pull on the gift you still have a job and daily living and things and and you really need to unplug from that because because because this life demands perfection and because we are imperfect beings it makes us tired it'll drain you and you really have to unplug from that and you know we would go different places my wife and i just to get a little rest and things but but i i never really unplugged like i did this last this last week and until now because we went our phones were out of data um because i just i don't want to pay too much so i you know we share just like two gigabytes of data which is really low but you know it gets us by but anyway so but you know it so that ran out the we didn't get good reception because we're back in the woods so we didn't have connection to the wi-fi we didn't have the data and i'll tell you what and and my pastor said you know brandon just shut your phone off put a message on there that you're out of town you can get a hold of me if they need me but just just shut her down and i took him up on it this time i always thought that i did that but i really did it this time and i'll tell you what i finally relaxed and i'll listen a couple of times i saw the news and i could feel myself start like getting nervous and i just thought no you know what just just unplug from it all just unplug from it all and i want to encourage you to do that brothers when you go out on vacation you do not need to keep your phone on that's right my wife is taking good notes right now i'm thankful my family got to come with me i haven't been able to yet so i appreciate them she she really puts in the sacrifice so thankful thankful for that but you know you you really it's you're i don't want to i don't want to be mean but i'm going to say it straight you're not that important shut it down you are important but not important enough that you can't shut your phone off or or at least you know put it on vibrate put it in airplane mode do not disturb throw it down don't connect to the wi-fi don't look at the news the world's going to go on without you you know but shut it shut it down and brothers and sisters i'm gonna okay so we got the brothers i'm gonna get the sisters but i know the brothers are just as guilty so we'll stay on this remember i only read the scripture about christ laying down his life for the for the for the bride so that was talking about the husbands we didn't get to the sister so here you are brothers but to unplugged from the social media listen social media people enjoy looking at your photos and things they enjoy seeing about your life i'm sure but but though life will go on for them without you and and you know especially if you're a business owner or something you know these things are important but just get away from it for a while and and you know i i had a couple of things that i wrote here if you're depressed get off the social media if you're anxious get off the news if you're stressed shut your phone off for an evening say well i can't go out of town right now well do it for the evening i promise you just listen try it if it doesn't work you can come back and tell me i'm wrong one day might not be enough sometimes it takes a couple days okay i'm not i'm not trying to make excuses for myself if you want to come back and tell me i'm wrong but i'm telling you sometimes we're so plugged into things in in this this realm of perfection that's demanded of us that that we just it takes us a couple days to unwind and get out of it take it for what it's worth but i promise you it'll help you you know jesus said that he got god gave us a day of rest and he did that for a reason because he knew the human body amen he knew the human body you say well brother you're preaching psychology no i'm preaching the creation of god god the creator knew that that we weren't meant to be to be it it is but we're not meant to be in this fast-paced environment this rat race that's that's why you have anxiety and and that's why brother branham said it'll be complete neurotics because it's just there's such a demand on you and there's and and i'm so totally taken too long on this worst part but i i pray that this helps you and i pray that encourages you you know i especially i see the young faces and and i just say you know if you can get this now you know you'll be so much better off later just just establish these things in your home now amen and and as your family grows you'll see the importance of these things when you tell yourself you can't do it you can't unplug you'll know that these things are controlling you instead of you controlling it paul wrote all things are lawful but all things are not edifying and profitable for my good all things are lawful he said but i won't be brought under the power and that word power actually means a slave of any right so if you say brother i can't do it i just can't do it well just simply know that you have become a slave to that thing and you have to ask yourself that question do you want to be a slave to anything or do you want to just be a slave to jesus christ amen so are we all familiar with the story of balaam is anybody not so if you if you're not i'd encourage you to read numbers 22 to 25 because i just want to draw some things out of here for a moment numbers 22 and verse 5. i want i just want to pull a couple things out of here numbers 22 verse 5 he sent messengers balak did therefore unto balaam the son of beor of pathor pethor which is by the river of the land of the children of his people to call him saying behold there's a people come out from egypt behold they cover the face of the earth and they abide over against me now i want i want to i i've got this highlighted because i want you to notice the testimony that the children of israel have they cover the face of the earth they didn't really right at that time they didn't really they had just come out of egypt they're traveling on into the wilderness and but this is the testimony of god before the people round about is that this people is so great that they cover the face of the earth and he's calling for balaam come because they their theirs they're set against me come now therefore i pray thee curse me this people for they are too mighty for me so that's the testimony of the people of god they cover the face of the earth they're so mighty they're too mighty for me pear adventure i shall prevail if you curse these people i'll prevail that we may smite them and that i may drive them out of the land for i walk which means i perceive i understand and know that listen now watch his words he whom now blesseth is blessed and he whom now cursed is cursed but i want you to watch the first thing in here so we talked about the testimony that that is going before the children of israel the what what god the work that god's doing in the people and then i want you to notice that balak is is appealing to balaam he's trying to appeal to him and he's trying to puff him up and he's trying to set a bar of perfection before him and he says the people who you bless are blessed and the people who you curse are cursed but i want you to notice in genesis 12 and verse 1 you don't you don't have to turn there genesis 12 and verse 1 now the lord had said unto abraham abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from the father's house unto a land which i will show thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing watch now this is god talking and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that cursed thee and in thee shall families of the earth be blessed so god god is the one who said this first now i don't know if balak caught wind of that if he knew this part of the testimony of the children of israel or or what it was but notice he twists the words god said i will bless who bless you i will curse who curse you balak is saying balaam who you bless is blessed and who you curse is cursed but watch numbers 22 and verse 12 god even told balaam the truth and god said unto balaam thou shalt not go with them thou shalt not curse the people for they are blessed in other words i have blessed them you cannot reverse that and then they testify to balak numbers 24 and verse 9. he couched he lay down as a lion and his great lion who shall stir him up blessed is he that blesseth thee and curseth is he that curseth thee so god's reiterating this through the prophecy he takes control of balaam's vocal cords and he's and he's telling them look i've blessed them and who blesses them is blessed who curse them is cursed and yet balak and balaam are trying to get this curse out knowing the truth that it can't be done god set it up listen we're we're set up on the basis of god's word god set this up on the basis of his word that who i bless is blessed who i curse is curse and no man can undo that and so there so the word of the lord is coming to these men trying to get them to understand look you're you're beating against the air it's not going to work try as hard as you want to but it can't be done so balak in our opening scripture balak took balaam to look at the worst part of god's people he took him and he and he wanted he said that that end part that utmost part that's that's the worst part it's the back side of the people he said i don't want you to overlook the whole thing i don't want you to see the the beginning from the end i don't want you to see it's just this part that lags behind a little bit they're the worst among them so i want to come i want to show you their bad parts i want to show you this bad side because if you see this side of them surely surely you'll be able to curse them surely this god will let you curse this people if you see all the things if you see their worst parts satan is the accuser of the brethren he constantly tries to show god our utmost parts now listen i have a very bad memory so if i say anything here that you heard me say before just a minute okay but satan's the accuser of the brethren and so satan's always trying to say hey did you look what they did did you look what she did did you did you look at look you know they know that they shouldn't be looking in the fashion magazine at that and and really wanting to be that but look at look at you see what you see what she's looking at look did you see what he did he he blew off the handle did you see that he's got an anger issue look at that this is the worst parts of them god you've got to see this people just give up on them let me have them fully how can you say this is your people look at the bad parts look at these parts so this is what balak is trying to do to get to get balaam to get god really to be able to let balaam curse this people the prophet of god said the utmost parts were their worst parts the things that they've done wrong these are all things i pulled out that he talked about the the utmost parts he called them the rotten parts the lowest and little parts the bad parts the scattered parts they they were at the end they're they're scattered a bit they're not keeping up with the group maybe you know and and here he is here listen now if you think you're the weakest of christians here's here's satan here's here's bala saying hey come around look at look at this one lagging behind a little bit don't don't look at the rest of them up there look at this one look at this brother not living like he should just yet he's still going to church yeah i know that but but look at him look at him he might be trying but he's failing don't you see the failures don't you see the the the they're the weakest among the christians but then we have a prophet come in our day who says when the weakest of christians get down on their knees satan trembles [Applause] i'm giving you a different testimony of this morning i'm giving you a different testimony despite what you may think of yourself despite what satan tells you you are i'm trying to tell you what god says you are. satan shows god our lowest moments the times we give into the flesh the places where we're little in or have a lot more growing to do the places that make us feel bad about how our walk with the lord has been right listen anybody else have those because i'll if i could raise both my feet too i would and and and you know and satan knows that that satan knows my bent and that perfectionism i hopefully that's the best thing to call it it's the best i know satan knows that i'm bent that way so he's constantly bringing things up he's constantly leaving my my utmost parts before me he's constantly taking me back to the mistakes i've made he's constantly bringing up these things and and i imagine it's the same for you imagine he's constantly he wants you to focus on those things the places where you feel small in in your walk in the lord the places where you know that you need to be doing better but you you're just you're still struggling in that area you're still fighting now if you're giving in listen you're just giving in but if there's something in your heart and and you're just you're saying but god i don't want to be that way but you find yourself doing it and you say but brother you're supposed to be preaching the gospel in christianity i am because paul said the things that i don't want to do i find myself doing and the things that i want to do i can't seem to do so don't look at me in a pious attitude and say well you brother or these brothers and sisters because i can tell you you got a religious spirit if you're feeling that way because i am preaching the gospel and if you feel that way about your brothers and sisters then go tell paul go tell the prophet paul that he was he was a heathen go tell him that he didn't he can't say those things and be a christian but i will preach to you that there is a power in the gospel that if you stay with it just like i said with the natural things that you have in your heart's desire if you'll stay with it then you will get there by the grace of god because remember it's a work of the holy ghost it's not a work of yourself it's not something you can do within yourself go ahead and try and try you may but you'll wear yourself out doing it you have to be completely reliant on the holy spirit you have one thing that you got to do and that is surrender and listen i'll give you a quote you can go look it up i can't tell you where it's at but i found it and it ministered so much to me he said the woman wrote in questions and answers 1964. i can tell you that much a woman a woman writes in because he says i don't i don't know who you are but then the prophet starts speaking to a woman so i guarantee you that was a woman that wrote that question in and she says i i have a problem submitting do i have an evil spirit and he says why do you have problem submitting it's just like and he goes into this thing and again taking it from the woman's standpoint so i know he knows this was a woman and he said it's like sister you spending all your life trying to keep yourself pure and chaste and then one day you take a husband and you get married and then you give yourself fully over to him everything that you kept chase and pure all this time in your single years you give fully over to him in your married years and he said it's just the same with god it's just that simple you just give yourself over to him you just it just depends on what you yield to i i'm trying to think out how to break that down more but you yield to it you give in to it it depends on what you give into and then he answers the question do i have an evil spirit and he said no i don't think you have an evil spirit but that is an evil spirit that tells you you have an evil spirit isn't that good and i'll tell you because listen satan will look at the things that you do wrong and he say boy you took on a spirit girl you got a spirit right there right right here back at this date this time back when you did this okay so god delivered you of that but you did it over again over here so you took a spirit here okay god forgave you for that you're moving on with christ but you did it over here again so so you took on a spirit there and eventually you might take on a spirit if you keep down that path but i'm telling you it's the devil that makes you think that you took on a spirit amen but god responds he says you come here and show me their lowest parts but then he tells he tells balaam we'll read it in a quote here in a minute and he says but this is god's response to the prophecy of balaam he says you came to show me their lowest parts but i'm looking at them from the heights i'm looking at them from beginning to the end god's second blessing so so this is the second time that balaam and balak tried this and this is the second blessing that god tells about the children of israel it was one of justification god looking at his people through an atonement brother branham said they had a smitten rock that god was looking at them through they had a brass serpent that god was looking at them through and sometimes we look at each other the way balak showed balaam the children of israel the way satan looks at us and i really i sometime maybe for back home this was just a fresh thought that i've been thinking on so you're getting it for the first time so good or bad but i want to hone this a little bit more sometime about about the body of christ and how we view each other we've hit on that quite a bit this morning so i don't think i'll go on it more but but i just think it's really important you know we can it being in a local body and i think you should be in a local body i think you should find a a church to call home i think you should find a pastor to call pastor i i believe that those things are important for you and and and and you know it's something that that man has put there in that area to help see you through to heaven we we all want to make it to heaven and god puts a man he puts a local body there he puts people in that body to to send you an encouraging text to to talk to you and to give you a smile and things and to encourage one another god sets up the body of christ that way and sometimes we can we can look at each other especially in the local body and we get so carnal with it and and you know i'll just be honest sometimes in positions in church especially you get you get carnal and there's carnal impersonations brother branham called it and you get in this carnal mindset you know don't try to bring your job not that god wouldn't use what what he's called you to do in the natural sense to to help out in the church but don't bring that that work worldly work mindset into the church because it doesn't work here that's not how god set this up you don't well i because i do this at work i i gotta do this at church well it might not be that way your pastor might not set it up that way he might he might not want you to be fully how you are at work helping in the church is that okay but but you know we get we get carnal and and we get in this mindset and then we start looking at each other through this through through the utmost parts there's a scripture that that our pastor was speaking on and he and it says looking beyond the flesh we have to look beyond the flesh at one another because we are imperfect human beings because we are in this flesh we are going to make mistakes we are going to have times where we we we disappoint one another and we offend one another a little bit and things and you know we need to forgive forget and move on amen so we see each other's fleshly parts and then we can draw conclusions about one another and then we run each other down to others and that that shouldn't be so we shouldn't do that but see what that's compared to here because god doesn't look at you that way and he doesn't want us to look at each other that way amen so i want to take this thought of of god looking at this people and and he says i don't even see let's let's go to numbers 22. just pull it up so i catch it right let me make sure i have that right i'm sorry numbers 23 numbers 23 19. verse 21 i'm sorry well let's just catch 20. i'm that's it's all so good he says behold i i uh behold i have received commandment to bless and he hath blessed why did he do that because god said those who i bless will be blessed and those who i curse will be cursed but watch now he says balaam saying and i cannot reverse it no matter how hard i try i cannot reverse this blessing now i'm not talking about the children of israel here i'm talking about you i'm talking about you your life your family the people sitting next to you the people over in in petersburg michigan uh the the body of christ god this blessing on this people cannot be reversed the blessing on your life i want you to make that personal the blessing on your life cannot be reversed verse 21. he listen this is how god sees israel and this is how god sees you he hath not beheld iniquity in jacob listen jacob as a man was a shyster he was no good just a liar and and yet god said jacob have i loved and esau have i hated and here he's saying i hath not beheld iniquity in jacob and it's not just that jacob it's the children of israel now the descendants of jacob and he's saying i don't even see these things that you're trying to tell me and and and that can't be reversed and then he says neither hath he seen the perverseness of israel perverse is a is a is a big word right hope i don't get myself in trouble if somebody you know we we they're designated a pervert that's going to be hard for them to get by right i mean that's just you're always going to look at them that way right i mean that that's like one of the worst things you could be called today but god says for art for us for me the times that have been perverse in my life god says i don't even see it right i don't even see it now i want to i want to shift gears here or take this a little bit deeper matthew 26 are you with me matthew 26 verse 27. you don't got to turn there if you don't want to um they're pulling it up quickly for us and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it now watch for this is my blood of the new testament testament is a covenant this is a new covenant this is a new thing that god is saying i'm doing right and remember what god blesses can't be reversed this is my blood or the new of the new covenant which is shed for many for the remission of sins so again just pulling in the body here so we have christ telling his disciples to drink of something that is representative of his blood it's the life-giving source which is the blood of his body he says his blood is shed for remission of sins now i something about the human body that's fascinated me is i can't remember the name of the position in the medical field but when they're doing a a an open heart they actually shut down the heart they they they bypass the lungs and all they do is they run the blood through a machine that puts some oxygen in it and it just keeps cycling it and it's running through your body so this thing essentially becomes the heart but they shut down the breathing they shut down basically everything else the only thing keeping you alive the life-giving resource is the blood amen so the life is in the blood take all the blood out of you and you're dead there's no life there right so you understand it it had to be blood it's the life-giving resource it's so jesus is saying i'm going to shed my blood and this is going to be for remission of sins so it's it's it's a it's a in and in communion it's a symbol it's it's that you're identified with christ partakers of him with the body in other words you're identified or showing you're plugged into christ in his body where the life is bringing everything under the blood and brother branham said it's a showdown nothing standing between you and the savior but we we realized i'm just saying that to say how important the blood is in in this remission of sins okay remission is a release from bondage or imprisonment it's a release from it it's forgiveness or pardon of sins it's letting them go as if they had never been committed watch the power of the blood watch this blessing that's been pronounced on you by jesus christ himself that cannot be reversed it's forgiveness it's pardon it's letting it go as if it was never committed it's remission of the penalty it's deliverance it's liberty it's divorcement of sin divorcement it means that sin has expired it's dead and it's not it's it's to not discuss the topic now i want catch this now i hope you're catching what i'm saying this is the blood the power of the blood of jesus christ in your life that god said i'm going to die my blood is for remission of sins and when you believe that this is the benefit that you get your debt that you could not pay has been completely washed away and not only that but god's saying i don't want to talk about it no more this is a topic that we're not going to discuss anymore so that's why brother branham could bring out that this goes in the sea of god's forgetfulness this is justification just as if you never did it in the first place and god is saying i don't want to talk about it so we we satan continually brings it up and then we continually bring it up to god and god's saying hey i don't want to talk about it it's under the blood forget it the italians say forget about it i don't want to talk about it no more and and it's a it's a divorcement now one thing that i thought about when i was when you know i was studying this is divorce you know nowadays divorce is just not what it used to be divorce and and if you've been divorced there's situations that come up and and i'm i'm sorry sorry for you and and and i just i i really am my my parents are divorced and it's it's an awful thing but divorcement nowadays seems to be some strange thing where you still stay in contact you're still buddies um you still get along because you've been married all that time but yet you're divorced and i don't understand that but it's why why get divorced in the first place but when this divorcement that god's talking about is a complete cutoff it's it's death it's just it's it's a you know divorce is a death that never dies nowadays because it's something you always you always go through there's always situations come up where you do have to maybe communicate or something and it's just it never ends but death you might mourn that person but there's but there's i think how to say this there's a little bit of closure to it right and so this is the divorcement that god's talking about is it give up a debt to neglect that uh it's it's not to hinder it's to depart and leave so all mutual claims are abandoned satan has no claim over you when you when you apply the blood that there is no sharing of you at that point god says they're all mine this is the blessing that i've spoken over them and i don't want to hear about it it's it's it's a break of it says satan you have no claim on them any longer it's to go away and leave someone behind not taking him as a companion you know if you if you if you've sinned in your past you've done something awful and you've repented and brought it under the blood leave that companion back there walk on with christ don't take him with you quit carrying the load jesus listen god is giving you permission to let it go he's given you permission to let it go hebrews 9 22 and without shedding of blood is no remission and then scofield writes the sin of the justified believer interrupts his fellowship it does interrupt fellowship if there's sin in your life then you can't have complete fellowship the way god wants to have fellowship but is forgiven upon confession always on the ground of christ propitiation sacrifice now i'm going to get into some scriptures are you still with me i have no clue what time it is boy we've been going a long time um i want you to catch a couple things though first john 1 verse 6. first john 1 verse 6. okay if we say that we have fellowship with god and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin not from some of your sin from all of your sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us now that's not saying that's not reversing what i'm saying that's saying i i that's acknowledging i am a sinner and i do need the blood of jesus christ if you didn't sin then there's no use for the blood but if you acknowledge that yes i have sin and i do need the blood of jesus christ is what he's saying then he goes on he says my little children these things write i unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father jesus christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world so notice the reach and the depth that this blood goes amen and i want to just grab verse 12. i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for why for his name's sake god didn't just set this up based on good behavior okay i'll forgive them and then they sin and okay now you're out then you repent okay you're back in no he's he put some skin in the game he said i'm gonna set this up based on what i'm doing for you i'm gonna set it up because this is my name at stake so you have you have i just want you to catch us this morning you have such an outstanding blessing over your life that i don't care how you feel about yourself i i do but i don't it doesn't matter in the end it doesn't matter what the devil says to you it doesn't matter what other people have said to you or about you you have such a blessing over your life and it cannot be reversed amen boy i've got a lot on my fork yeah proverbs 24 16 for a just man falls seven times and rises up again but the wicked shall fall into mischief so the justified man doesn't matter how many times you fall get back up get back up get back up if you fall get back up it doesn't matter how many times you fall jesus what i just shared with you jesus does not keep record of that he only sees you standing that's the only way he wants to see you is to see you standing amen now brother do you got that picture i want to show you something and then we'll expound on this because this is really something i believe that that satan has done through so brother branham talks about the doctrine of balaam the scripture talks about that brother branham expounds on it for us right so revelation speaks of the doctrine of balaam but brother branham said that you can't you know nicolaitanism is is conquering the laity it's a group of men a hierarchy see that's why that's why the workforce doesn't work in the church there is no hierarchy now i say that the pastor is the pastor right every church is sovereign so don't say i'm saying anything different but i'm just saying it's it's this hierarchy that men puts up and and it's it's to have rule over people and and you know we find it in the catholic church we find it in the different denominations but it's not to enter that's not the way that god wanted it set up and so you have this doctrine of the nicolaitanism which means to conquer the laity and then you have so once you conquer the laity you have to have a tool to do it by and it's the doctrine of balaam it's it's man's ideas it's man injecting it's man it's man adding and taking away from the word to to to have this conquering authority over the people to hold them it's what satan does to you in your mind it's the battle of the mind that's exactly what the doctrine of balaam is is to get you think something about yourself other than what the word says so man has taken this thought of penance and and this is a man-made thing this is a man-made doctrine it's a doctrine of balaam that man has to do something in order to gain acceptance with god in order to gain forgiveness of sins but we just read in the word that when you confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive you your sins he doesn't say that you have to go and walk from the back of the building up to the front on your knees he doesn't say that you have to go stand up on your head up against the wall he doesn't say that you have to go light a candle or that you have to go burn incense he doesn't say there's blessings when you pay your tithes but you don't it's not even something that that i i want to say this right but it's not something that god requires of you for your salvation you cannot buy your way into heaven give that's great that's charity you should do that but don't expect god to gain favor with god because you give a lot of money if you give a million dollars if you had a million dollars and you put a million dollars in the tithe plate especially so everyone can see not i know it's just you're on the front row brother and and you know jesus used a sister that gave what was it two pennies and he said she gave more than all of you so if this sister gave two pennies to the brother next to you is million dollars there there's no difference it doesn't this one doesn't give favor because he gave more money it's the condition of the heart that god's looking at in the giving but god's looking at the blood amen so this thing of penance now i was talking with in some fellowship and a brother said he said there's no penance in true repentance and so i got to looking at the word and it just it just something god dropped in my heart i believe and this is what came to my mind and you see the word penance you can take the letters out and make it say penance but what do you have to remove to get there you have to remove the cross you have to remove the word of god you have to remove the blood amen in order to get a man-made doctrine of penance so i'm telling you this morning i want you to be free from any bondage from any anything that satan or man has put on you because this is the truth of the matter that there is no penance and repentance penance gets us looking at ourselves and makes us look back rather than looking forward repentance gets us looking at christ into and and to get up and keep pressing toward the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus any spirit that would require penance of you is an antichrist spirit and i'll say that as loud and boldly as i can that is an antichrist spirit god hates what balaam did even told him god told him the angel of the lord stood before the donkey and he said your way is perverse before me he told balaam that anything that takes man away from the truth of the matter is despicable in the sight of god so don't listen to man who puts you under a doctrine of penance it's false teaching if our heart condemns us god is greater than our heart that's first john 3 20. then it says if the son of uh if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed john 8 36 can are you still with me a little bit longer it's 12 30 so i think i've gone exactly an hour brother said this is the message of the hour just a little bit longer i promise i'll go quick god is not a god of guilt i just this is this is what god laid on my heart as i'm getting to the meat of it now after now if i was a better preacher maybe god is not a god of guilt he's not a god looking to make life more difficult this is something god's been speaking to me personally he don't god's not out to make life more difficult and make you live under a cloud of confusion and condemnation and guilt and fear he said he came that you might have life and have it more abundantly and i and i don't know how to say that too much different than what i just did but it i i just want to i i just that's what my heart is beating at right now amen is god is not a god who makes you feel guilty he's not a god who beats you over the head he's not a god who set some some hierarchy or some system in place that that you just can't live up to that is not what god had in mind that's why i'm trying to tell you that god died he shed his blood so that you could have a blessing that cannot be reversed and and it's just our fleshly in our flesh and our thinking and and sometimes our expectations of one another that just it just makes us think this way listen a lot of people and brother branham said he thought this way too a lot of people still today say well god is an angry god of the old testament but jesus loves me but if you know your scripture and if you'll pray for revelation you'll see that god and jesus are the same god just changed who he was he changed his mask as it were he came in the flesh they're the same the holy spirit it's not three persons it's three offices i am a father i am a son and i'm a husband it's the same thing with god i am one person not three amen i know you know that here but i'm just it it's it's just you can't separate god like that and then brother branham comes and he brings the revelation jehovah of the old is jesus of the new year it's the same person so so god who may have appeared angry at times listen i just read to you in numbers and god is giving a blessing that that's not an angry god that's a god who loves his people and who's for them amen so we can't hold things over our own head and we can't hold things over other's head god never demanded sinless perfection now i know that i knew it would get quiet right there god does not demand sinless perfection out of you he had to provide the way that is a man-made doctrine when god said be perfect as my father is perfect that perfect is not the perfection that this world has set up or that man in balaam's doctrine has set up that means he's speaking of a growth and it's a growth into maturity he's speaking of adoption when he says that he's not telling you you have to be perfect today if you're not perfect until you're perfect god doesn't accept you that's not what jesus said he said he said my children my brothers he called them friends and john listen this is what's so beautiful that's why i read john 15 is because he said i'm i'm not calling you servants anymore i'm calling you friends because i'm revealing everything that the father is saying to you and this is a revelation that god has revealed that you don't you don't have to live under condemnation you know i he says i've done this it's it's a it's a it's a growth it's i'm not demanding perfection from you i've provided the perfection for you all you have to do is walk in it amen he said he would never put on us more than we can bear he'll never ask of you more than what he can supply we say well that it's just too great this trial is too great and we and we kind of keep in that mindset and that's how we look at that scripture but really god can put as much on you as long as he provides for you what you need amen he said let us go over from point a to point b from one thing to another from glory to glory and not one will be plucked from my hand let me just jump here if the musicians want to come listen when we look at this this doctrine of balaam where it's brought up and god says i hate it is in revelations when he's talking about the church ages and just showing that god will always provide the way he's always made a way he it's it's based on what he's done not what you've done when he says that in the church ages he also says to him that overcometh and it's god providing the way through he didn't say that as a distant god looking down on the uttermost parts it's he says it when he's walking in the midst of the candlesticks he's right there he's right with us walking through the age he's right there with us his blood is still on the throne his blood is still on the mercy seat despite what anyone would say god is still his blood is still just as powerful today as it ever has been i want to catch one i'll read those last two quotes real quick brothers it says all right the church seems to have almost completely been cut off just a little dwindle talking about through the church age and they had got away from the great spiritual meetings and were kind of relying upon works god don't want us to rely upon works that's a sign of organism organization we take miss jones over some wood and we'll take so and so their children over some clothes and that's all right but don't you depend on that don't you do that brother that's good deeds a good citizen a good decent citizen will do that but what it takes to be a christian is a born-again experience the baptism of the holy ghost all right dwindled off they was resorted to works instead of love and faith getting them more and more all the time as it went on i've got some scriptures here that i'm just don't don't have time to read but you know the scripture by by faith are you saved not of works lest any man should boast but it's by grace it's by faith and what god's done for you amen paul wrote to the galatians who hath bewitched you that ye should not obey the truth before whose eyes jesus christ hath been evidently set forth crucified among you this only what i learned of you receive ye the spirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith it's not by the law it's by faith [Music] and how do you get faith you say brother i just don't have the faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god that's why i tell you i'm not trying to to attach you to some church or to some to brother sam or some other minister or anything but i'm trying to attach you to jesus christ and you come because this is where the word is preached and if the word is preached your faith will be lifted that's just how god set it up amen let's skip that last quote i just feel to stop there so i i pray this was a blessing to you and i pray that you could see because it's just laying maybe a long foundation but that especially that last part is just what started burning in my heart for you this this morning is just to really to really see that anything that makes you rely on works is a doctrine of man and and i'm telling you if you don't believe me go read get your bible and do a little study because god says i hate that i hate the thing that takes you off of the true word of god amen you can stand to your feet and i sure sure appreciate you and i and i know brother sam would be very happy with the things way things operate here and you always make me feel real welcome and and i just really appreciate you all and you're you can see the desire to serve god in your eyes each one of you so i don't know what you're going through i don't know what you've been through i don't know what your past is i do care for you so when i say i don't care i don't i don't mean it that way but what i'm trying to say is it's remitted if it's not bring it under the blood get it under the blood this morning listen you don't don't come confess it to me i'm not the mediator confess it to god he's the one that his his what he did he's the one it's his blood on the cross it's his blood that stands between that mad main thing of penance and makes it repentance something he doesn't want to talk about anymore so get it under the blood and move on that seems so easy but it it is yes it is it's just this flesh that gets in the way [Music] i'm not a good singer so i'm gonna i'm gonna say my prayer here and turn the service over but if you need prayer i'm happy to pray with you i'm happy to put my faith with yours if if you you know don't don't come confess to me what you did wrong but if you need me to pray with you i'd be happy to do that amen let's bow our hearts together lord jesus we come before you and lord it's it's a sacred thing for me god for a minister to to hand over his congregation for a service that means to me a world because he has confidence and trust in me not in me but the gift in me lord and i just pray that i've surrendered and i've yielded to you fully so that you could speak i just still feel that last part burning in my heart god and and i just pray lord maybe i should have spent more time
