[27:49] commit ourselves Lord into your hands
[27:52] for your glory in the name of Jesus
[27:54] Christ
[27:55] amen amen if you would let's turn to
[27:59] Deuteronomy chapter 1 I don't want to
[28:02] read a few verses of Scripture before we
[28:04] let you be seated tonight
[28:16] let's begin at verse 21
[28:25] remember the setting of this scripture
[28:28] Moses is speaking to the new generation
[28:32] and it is very is at the time of
[28:37] preparing them to cross over and he's
[28:42] revisiting some of these important
[28:45] points with them in verse 21 he says
[28:50] behold the LORD thy God hath set the
[28:53] land before thee go up and possess it as
[28:56] the Lord God of thy father's hath said
[28:58] unto thee fear not neither be
[29:01] discouraged now Moses is recording he's
[29:03] recalling what he spoke at the beginning
[29:07] because you see God cannot and will not
[29:12] change his word his word doesn't have to
[29:16] be modified whatever that God has spoken
[29:19] he will fulfill so it's not a new
[29:23] promise it's bringing now the promise
[29:26] that has been made into effect so he's
[29:29] revisiting this and he came near unto me
[29:32] every one of you and said we will send
[29:34] men before us and they shall search us
[29:37] out the land and bring us word again by
[29:40] what way we must go up and into what
[29:43] cities we shall come and the saying
[29:45] pleased me well and I took 12 men of
[29:48] Yueh one of a tribe to us and brought us
[29:50] word again and said it is a good land
[29:53] which the Lord our God does give us
[29:55] notwithstanding you would not go up but
[29:58] rebelled against the commandment of the
[30:00] Lord your God and he murmured in your
[30:03] tents and said because the Lord hated us
[30:07] he hath brought us forth out of the land
[30:09] of Egypt to deliver us into the hand of
[30:12] the Emirates to destroy us whether shall
[30:15] we go up our brethren have discouraged
[30:18] our heart saying the people is greater
[30:22] and taller than we the cities are great
[30:25] and walled up to heaven and moreover we
[30:28] have seen the sons of the Anakin's there
[30:30] I want you to watch this what what we've
[30:33] just read here
[30:35] from verse 27 because the Lord hated us
[30:39] he brought us forth out of the land of
[30:41] Egypt to deliver us into the hand to the
[30:44] hammerites to destroy us that's a lie
[30:46] that is a lie now you tell me where they
[30:52] get the influence to say this about God
[30:54] they didn't get it from God they got it
[30:57] from demons that came to attack the word
[31:01] it is an outright lie so how do you
[31:04] compare a lie how do you combat a lot
[31:07] you've got to come at it with truth so
[31:11] here Moses picks up in verse 29 then I
[31:14] said unto you this is what Moses said
[31:16] even during this time dread not neither
[31:19] be afraid of them the Lord your God
[31:22] which goeth before you he shall fight
[31:24] for you according to all that he did for
[31:28] you in Egypt before your eyes and in the
[31:32] wilderness where thou has seen how that
[31:33] the LORD thy God bare thee as a man doth
[31:36] bear his son and all the way that you
[31:38] went until you came into this place may
[31:42] the Lord add his blessing to the word as
[31:44] you're being seated I like to speak to
[31:51] you tonight just on a thought and
[31:55] opening upon this here victory over
[31:58] discouragement Satan's tactics have
[32:04] never they haven't changed he still uses
[32:08] the same tactics today that he that he
[32:11] used even in the beginning and it's
[32:14] something that we need to look at and be
[32:18] mindful of that Satan cannot overthrow
[32:21] the Word of God
[32:23] he's never overthrown the Word of God in
[32:26] any generation there's been people that
[32:28] he's overthrown but he's never
[32:30] overthrown the word because if Satan
[32:33] could defeat the word he'd be able to
[32:35] defeat God because God is the word so we
[32:40] recognize that within it that you know
[32:42] when we look at this God is not a man
[32:45] that he should lie nor a son of man
[32:48] he should repent he never has and he
[32:51] never will have to take back one word
[32:53] but we know that God has never he's
[32:57] never miss spoken he's never had an oops
[33:00] moment but everything that God has said
[33:03] he will fulfill it the only thing that
[33:06] God needs is that there would be people
[33:09] who would be believers that he can then
[33:13] improve his word through believers and
[33:16] every word that God proves through
[33:19] believers it's a paradox because it's
[33:22] the Almighty God proving his word
[33:24] through flesh now I want you to look at
[33:29] this tonight when we look at it these
[33:31] people that were looking at they had
[33:33] brought an evil report against the
[33:36] promise of God they were looking at the
[33:39] opposition instead of the God who made
[33:41] the promise and you know when they made
[33:44] a statement that they said that he hates
[33:46] us that's a lie
[33:48] he brought us up here in the wilderness
[33:50] to destroy us that's a lie
[33:52] when you see there there comes a moment
[33:54] where within the discernment you've got
[33:57] to be able to discern that and withstand
[34:01] that and call him a lie
[34:02] I don't care where it's coming from it's
[34:05] just like when Jobs stood there and
[34:07] after Jobe had faced everything
[34:09] his wife remember that Satan had said I
[34:12] will call job to curse you to your face
[34:15] and here the Satan had moved in and his
[34:18] wife no doubt was so discouraged and so
[34:21] distraught she said why don't you
[34:23] discuss God and I but say but joged was
[34:26] able to discern that that wasn't really
[34:29] his wife but that was an evil spirit
[34:32] because he said you speak like a foolish
[34:35] woman he was able to recognize that you
[34:38] see there was all sorts of things that
[34:40] was coming at him to discourage him and
[34:43] here tonight with in every within every
[34:46] one of us that's here whether it's been
[34:48] previous days today or coming days we
[34:51] will always have to battle
[34:53] discouragement discouragement is
[34:55] something that has the people of God we
[34:58] are always faced with you'll find where
[35:00] there's always an
[35:01] position and an obstacle that will
[35:03] always come and it will always try to
[35:06] attack the promised notice all the way
[35:08] through the journey it wasn't until they
[35:11] got to this place that when he sent
[35:14] people over to spy out the land that
[35:16] those people came back with an evil
[35:19] report and they said we're not able to
[35:21] go up and take the land and the
[35:23] Scriptures recorded right here what
[35:26] actually took place is by the things
[35:29] that were being spoken by these men it
[35:32] actually discouraged the heart you see
[35:34] Satan cannot overthrow the word but if
[35:38] he can somehow bring discouragement in
[35:41] the heart he's got you it's just like
[35:43] when it comes to any promise whether
[35:45] it's for healing deliverance the Holy
[35:47] Ghost whatever the promise is that God
[35:50] has made that the Lord is dealing with
[35:51] your heart
[35:52] he'll try within every measure to try to
[35:55] discourage you you see it even within
[35:57] the prophets life he tried to come at
[35:59] the prophet and discourage him how many
[36:01] times that brother Branham said then he
[36:03] said I'm going off the field one time he
[36:05] was going off the field because they
[36:07] were making him God then brother Brandon
[36:09] came back around again and then after
[36:11] the opening of the seals he makes known
[36:13] to us he said I've got discouraged and I
[36:16] said I wasn't going to preach the gospel
[36:17] no more I had developed a complex
[36:20] because he said people it seemed like
[36:22] people weren't listening to me you think
[36:25] but you think the devil don't fight the
[36:26] ministry but devil will fight you as
[36:28] well
[36:29] the devil will get you looking at all
[36:31] sorts of things that if you look at all
[36:33] the negative and you look at everything
[36:35] else well what about this and what about
[36:37] that let me tell you something that will
[36:39] never bring faith to your life but if
[36:42] you can look to the Lord who made the
[36:44] promise he will give you a good courage
[36:47] that you yourself will be able to have
[36:50] victory over discouragement the salmon
[36:54] are you telling me there's times I'm not
[36:55] going to be down I never said that
[36:57] that's not what we're talking about
[36:59] within the word but there is a way my
[37:02] prayer and my heart's desire tonight of
[37:04] what God is so laid on my heart for
[37:06] weeks is that there wouldn't be that of
[37:08] an armament you would be able to take
[37:10] from here and be able to stand
[37:12] toe-to-toe with
[37:14] level right here tonight and in every
[37:16] other day that he comes along your way
[37:18] and be able to discern it and call him
[37:20] what he really is
[37:22] a liar he is a liar now I want you to
[37:28] watch this they spoke evil against the
[37:30] promise of God but God will always
[37:32] fulfill his word by his spirit now as
[37:36] they came back and they discouraged the
[37:38] people and you know when we look at it
[37:41] you see God in fulfilling his word God
[37:44] is not calling for our people within
[37:47] this place that would be such a mighty
[37:50] people within themselves
[37:51] that's not what God needs all God
[37:54] requires is faith if thou canst believe
[37:58] all things are possible
[38:01] that's all God needs is faith and you
[38:04] know what God realizes that it's
[38:06] impossible for you and I just to have
[38:09] faith within ourselves so God Himself
[38:12] will move in such a way in your life in
[38:15] a service in your personal life to build
[38:18] faith in Him
[38:19] for the promise you see all of these
[38:22] things they are to be accumulated in our
[38:24] heart the things that God has done for
[38:27] you and I have the testimonies and what
[38:29] God has done don't leave them scattered
[38:31] loosely as though they are loose events
[38:33] they are not loose events they are
[38:36] happenings and spiritual happenings of
[38:39] the Lord that you are to accumulate in
[38:42] your heart and whereby your faith is
[38:45] built in him for the promise now watch
[38:48] this here Satan's desire is always to
[38:52] try to discourage you'll get you
[38:54] focusing on the wrong thing who calls
[38:56] you to focus on everything that's going
[38:58] wrong this is not going right and this
[39:01] and that
[39:01] and pretty soon see what you're focusing
[39:03] on is what you'll talk about and what
[39:06] you talk about shows what you've been
[39:08] thinking on shows what's in your heart
[39:10] and pretty soon you've got such an
[39:12] atmosphere of doubt and everything
[39:14] that's all around if you could look at
[39:16] it in your home it's cloudier and greyer
[39:18] then the skies are in Ohio there's all
[39:21] sorts of things that are around there's
[39:23] no sunshine that's going forth
[39:25] whatsoever why
[39:26] you're occupied with discouragement but
[39:28] let me tell you something God's Word
[39:30] cannot be defeated and God will see his
[39:35] word through now watch this how the
[39:39] scripture portrays and lets go into this
[39:41] here in just a little bit in numbers 13
[39:45] here if I can just move through a few
[39:47] places here in the scripture I want you
[39:49] to watch the happenings of where when
[39:51] they actually come back into the camp
[39:53] and we break into this time that Moses
[39:55] is calling their attention back to
[39:57] remember when they went over into the
[39:59] land the Bible tells us in numbers 13
[40:02] 2010 it was the time of the first ripe
[40:05] grapes to appear so now there is fruit
[40:08] that is present in the land that they
[40:10] would be able to bring back and they did
[40:13] bring back that land the Bible tells us
[40:15] in verse 33 that they cut down from
[40:17] fence a branch from one cluster of
[40:20] grates and they bare it between two upon
[40:22] a staff and they brought of the
[40:24] pomegranates and of the figs so they
[40:27] were not want and blaah of there being
[40:30] fruit in the land but remember in the
[40:32] mouth of two or three witnesses let
[40:33] every word be established
[40:35] there was grapes there was pomegranates
[40:37] there was figs that was there that they
[40:40] had actually brought back now I want you
[40:42] to watch this in the word these buncha
[40:44] Liars what they said they made a
[40:46] statement here later in in the word as
[40:49] they were recording their event and they
[40:52] said that this is a land that eateth up
[40:54] the inhabitants liars
[40:56] that was not the truth they were
[40:58] actually holding what was the truth but
[41:01] yet they themselves lied God's Word had
[41:05] already been declared so what's
[41:06] happening they're liars they're telling
[41:09] lies and by the people who are there
[41:11] that are entertaining these lies you
[41:14] know one thing they should have done
[41:15] they could have went right to Moses and
[41:17] Aaron and said you know what here's
[41:19] what's happened but instead the Bible
[41:21] says they went to Moses and Aaron and
[41:23] before the whole congregation you see
[41:25] Satan just did not want to come at Moses
[41:28] and Aaron it would have stopped right
[41:30] there it would have ceased right there
[41:32] but because God allowed listen to me now
[41:35] God allowed it to be that way
[41:38] that the whole congregation the
[41:39] tribesman and then they would hear this
[41:42] and all of a sudden you find a murmuring
[41:44] you find a weeping you find a moaning
[41:47] that moves through the heart of the
[41:49] people why is that they are discouraged
[41:52] who discouraged them did god discourage
[41:55] him no Satan had discouraged them how
[41:59] did Satan discourage them by telling
[42:01] them lies now watch this here when you
[42:04] look at this the Bible goes on to tell
[42:06] us that even they not only bearing V&B a
[42:09] fruit but they even said in themselves
[42:12] surely the land floweth with milk and
[42:14] honey in verse 27 they also went on to
[42:17] say that the people the Strela in the
[42:19] land they're very strong and the cities
[42:21] are walled up and very great but I want
[42:23] you to notice the Bible in verse 30 it
[42:26] said in Caleb steeled the people before
[42:30] Moses this was necessary the word steal
[42:34] here means to be silent it's a
[42:38] commandment shut up it's a commandment
[42:41] stop talking you knew Caleb represented
[42:44] he represented the tribe of Judah the
[42:46] Lion of Judah was roaring out if the
[42:50] lion was roaring it was telling the rest
[42:53] of them shut up the lies that's been
[42:56] told down through the ages the Lion of
[42:59] the tribe of Judah has roared in this
[43:02] hour and said shut up
[43:04] it's lies lies oh my so here Caleb as he
[43:12] stands here he begins to make known and
[43:15] we see how that these men would may even
[43:18] make a statement and say all the people
[43:21] in verse 32 all the people that we saw
[43:24] in the in in in it in that land are men
[43:27] of great stature liars that's a lie
[43:30] there was none of this the truth did
[43:33] they see people of a nakum yes but it
[43:36] was not all giants lies and we were in
[43:42] our own sight as grasshoppers they were
[43:45] not grasshoppers another lie but in
[43:48] their own
[43:49] site you see what it is is lies now now
[43:53] look within this you and I are looking
[43:55] back in the scripture and looking over
[43:58] this but you see they didn't need a
[43:59] Bible to know this was a lie
[44:01] come on they didn't need a search
[44:04] program to know this was a lie they
[44:06] didn't need to have a phone that had
[44:07] access to the message in that hour what
[44:10] they needed is to meet the God face to
[44:12] face
[44:12] who made the promise of that hour and
[44:15] when they met that God face to face they
[44:17] had faith that that God would fulfill
[44:19] what he said he would do are you with me
[44:23] but instead of it here they are in the
[44:25] midst of it and they're entertaining
[44:27] this they're taking all this in they're
[44:30] listening to it their reasoning they've
[44:32] got imaginations you know when these
[44:34] guys when these guys begin to speak we
[44:36] were like grasshoppers every one of them
[44:38] knows the power within these words you
[44:40] know your words got power your words
[44:43] will either bring faith or they'll bring
[44:44] doubt in your home that's why it's very
[44:47] important that your language should not
[44:49] be a negative language there's many of
[44:51] you maybe you never even cussed in your
[44:53] life and there's many of us then maybe
[44:55] God God has taken that right out of our
[44:57] life but yet still within the midst of
[45:00] the time to talk negative the Prophet
[45:01] identified that is the devil's language
[45:04] we are never to be entertained as a
[45:07] matter of fact brother Graham said when
[45:09] you go to saying I got little faith he
[45:11] said don't say that he said you say I've
[45:13] got great faith you see we're not lying
[45:16] we're testifying according to the truth
[45:19] of God's Word oh my if you let it be
[45:24] this circumstances that's all around you
[45:26] can discourage you O Muhammad watch how
[45:31] that here within the midst of it this is
[45:34] being dismantled this evil report that
[45:37] has come up into the land now I'll think
[45:39] about this here in the Bible has it has
[45:41] it records here's a testimony and
[45:43] witness this is the fact sheet this is
[45:46] his this is Satan's facebook profile in
[45:49] John chapter 8 the Bible says that like
[45:53] this he was a murderer from the
[45:55] beginning and abode not in the truth
[45:57] because there is no
[46:00] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[46:03] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[46:07] the father of it so what is Satan he's a
[46:11] liar
[46:12] when he speaks a lie he speaks of his
[46:16] own it originated every lie originated
[46:20] was Satan
[46:22] glory be to God so he's a liar and on
[46:25] the basis I want you listen to me now
[46:27] he's a liar and on the basis of the word
[46:30] confirmed by the Spirit we can take
[46:32] Satan right back to the word and stand
[46:35] there because God's Word cannot fail I
[46:41] want you to watch what David and David
[46:43] place a few of these parts for us in
[46:45] Psalms 119 verse 160 thy word is true
[46:50] from the beginning and every one of that
[46:54] righteous judgments endureth forever in
[46:56] Psalms 12 verse 6 the words of the Lord
[47:01] are pure words as silver tried in a
[47:05] furnace of Earth purified seven times
[47:08] what is pure the words of the Lord now
[47:13] think of this as we look on here in
[47:15] Psalm 62 in Psalm 62 verse 1 here is
[47:19] here is the text that the Prophet would
[47:21] take for that of the message Shalom and
[47:24] I want you to look at where we're at
[47:25] we're in the time of a closing out of
[47:28] civilization in the time when the day
[47:30] star itself has been born within our
[47:33] hearts it is there is declaring within
[47:35] our hearts there is a new day rising on
[47:39] the scene are you with me so the notice
[47:41] for us in this hour if you've been born
[47:44] of the Spirit of God it is Shalom the
[47:47] light of God has entered into your life
[47:50] and we are dwelling in Christ but all
[47:54] outside of that woe is the darkness that
[47:57] is upon the earth now watch how David
[47:59] says this in verse 1 truly my soul
[48:04] waiteth upon God truly not fictitiously
[48:10] not deceitfully true
[48:12] my soul waiteth upon God so there is a
[48:16] true expectation from him
[48:19] cometh my salvation he only is my rock
[48:23] and my salvation he is my defense i
[48:25] shall not be greatly moved how long will
[48:29] you imagine mischief against a man ye
[48:33] shall be slain all of you as a bowling
[48:36] wall shall be and as a tottering fence
[48:38] they only consult to cast him down from
[48:42] his Excellency do you realize the demon
[48:46] spirits that have been congregating all
[48:49] the way down through time
[48:51] do you realize what they have sought to
[48:52] do is to tear him down from this
[48:55] excellency they wanted to hand the
[48:58] church titles at a Trinitarian doctrine
[49:01] of that is absolutely inspired from hell
[49:04] and have want to diminish the very name
[49:07] of the Lord Jesus Christ that wanted to
[49:10] take it away as though he's just a base
[49:12] thing as though he was just a good man
[49:14] but notice within all of this they want
[49:17] to remove him from his Excellency let me
[49:19] tell you something go time's my change
[49:22] go darkness gets greater but yet God's
[49:25] Word cannot fail he's the same God
[49:28] tonight as he ever was to the real heart
[49:32] of a believer when Christ is seated
[49:34] there in the throne of that heart the
[49:36] excellency our God is dwelling there and
[49:40] to them every word is yay an amen glory
[49:44] be to God they only consult to cast down
[49:48] from his excellency now notice consult
[49:50] consult who they delight in lies they
[49:56] bless with their mouths but they curse
[49:59] inwardly this is the same thing the
[50:01] Pharisees did in that day their heart
[50:05] their mouth was near but their heart was
[50:07] far away their whole purpose was to tear
[50:11] him down do you realize that Satan Paul
[50:14] identifies this right in the gospel do
[50:16] you really think that the devil was
[50:18] going to try to keep people from trying
[50:20] from emerging in and trying to take the
[50:23] word and pull
[50:24] the word not at all even where John
[50:26] himself would identify by the Spirit of
[50:29] God beloved he said try every spirit are
[50:34] you with me it was calling for
[50:36] discernment
[50:36] he said Nichols that Antichrist that
[50:38] you've heard of it is right now it's
[50:41] right among us he was identifying that
[50:43] spirit that was right among the church
[50:45] in that hour Paul even told him as he
[50:48] called him together
[50:48] he said there's going to be Grievous
[50:50] wolves enter in after my departure and
[50:52] there's going to be men that'll rise up
[50:54] speaking perverse things we see this
[50:57] through the scripture that Satan's
[50:59] objective is he cannot listen he cannot
[51:02] dismantle the kingdom of God he cannot
[51:05] remove the Lord Jesus from the throne
[51:08] and from the fulfillment of the word but
[51:10] what Satan's objective is to try to do
[51:13] is to paint it full of lies and to make
[51:16] it seem in some way that he's not the
[51:19] same God that he doesn't keep his
[51:21] promise but let me tell you something
[51:23] he's still the same yesterday today and
[51:26] forever
[51:27] whatever he bit before his still do it
[51:30] today that yes his excellency his
[51:33] excellency is this power its nature its
[51:37] character revealed hmm my soul look what
[51:43] David goes on to say my soul wait thou
[51:46] only upon God notice this speaks of a
[51:50] word being preeminent for my expectation
[51:54] is from him aren't you looking for the
[51:56] next president no I'm looking for the
[51:58] King of glory hallelujah this kingdom
[52:02] it's overthrown every other Kingdom come
[52:06] on somebody this kingdom right here
[52:09] overthrew every other Kingdom this
[52:11] kingdom will continue to grow until
[52:13] every kingdom is delivered unto the Lord
[52:17] and His Christ his anointed he only who
[52:23] all of this he only is my rock and my
[52:28] salvation David what about your 401k no
[52:32] he only is my rock they've been what
[52:35] about you
[52:36] about the stock market no he only is my
[52:38] rock they've been what about no he he
[52:41] only is my rock and my salvation he is
[52:46] my defense David what are you going to
[52:49] do when they put pressure
[52:50] he's my defense i shall not be moved in
[52:57] god is my salvation and my glory the
[53:00] rock of my strength and my refuge is in
[53:04] god
[53:05] trust in him at all times you people
[53:07] pour out your heart before him god is a
[53:10] refuge for us now let me tell you
[53:18] Caleb's filled the people that was
[53:21] necessary all of that that was going
[53:25] through the camp
[53:26] k-dubb stood up and silenced it I hope
[53:32] you're with me I trust you're born of
[53:35] that same line of the tribe of Judah you
[53:38] hear negative things you ought to rise
[53:40] up and say shut up come on somebody
[53:44] things are coming come on now it's time
[53:47] to call it in order we don't want his
[53:51] lives around
[53:53] amen we're not trying to whitewash
[53:55] things but the devil is the one that
[53:58] wants to sell people lives and tell them
[54:01] all sorts of things look at this he'll
[54:02] tell them they're okay and everything's
[54:04] going all right and then he'll turn
[54:06] around to the real children of God that
[54:08] are born of the Holy Ghost and he'll try
[54:10] to punch at you every day you'll try to
[54:12] come at you at different times he'll try
[54:14] to come at you in every little way to
[54:16] try to discourage you he'll try to is
[54:19] his best to come but notice within it
[54:22] all God stands true to his word
[54:25] I'd say it's very clear when brother
[54:28] Brown was asked a question brother
[54:29] Branham the devil keeps coming and
[54:31] telling me I'm not a Christian and
[54:33] brother Branham answered the individual
[54:35] and said now brother Branham you know
[54:38] what should I do
[54:39] brother Graham said now if your life it
[54:41] copes with the word now that's a very
[54:43] big statement that we could preach on
[54:45] that for the rest of the night you've
[54:47] got to see that every
[54:48] of your life copes with the word that
[54:50] means from your soul not your mouth not
[54:53] your head but from your soul your soul
[54:56] punctuates every word of God with a man
[55:00] if your soul can punctuate it with a
[55:03] name and not that you agree with it not
[55:05] that it's just casual not that it's just
[55:07] something you subscribe to but if he
[55:10] indeed is your life then you can stand
[55:13] there and absolutely take the opposite
[55:16] of what the devil is trying to say you
[55:20] see the devil is one of those as we said
[55:22] moments ago he'll tell other people
[55:24] you're okay you're all right and
[55:26] everything's fine and then he'll come
[55:28] around upon others and he'll try to wear
[55:30] them out but it's being able to discern
[55:33] the devil when we want listen friends
[55:35] when it comes down to it we've got to
[55:37] make here I my trust is only in the Lord
[55:40] that very opening Scripture that very
[55:42] first scripture in Psalm 62 speaks and
[55:46] is the Ministry of the initial evidence
[55:47] of the Holy Ghost truly my soul trusts
[55:51] in God
[55:52] nothing else it's not resting in a
[55:54] sensation it's not resting because of
[55:56] this it's not now he alone is my rock
[56:01] no but Rose I know the message not
[56:03] because I believe brother man is a
[56:05] prophet no he alone is my rock truly my
[56:09] soul waiteth on the Lord glory be to God
[56:14] so someone has got to stand on the word
[56:17] and call the devil a liar that's the
[56:23] truth you see even when you look in this
[56:26] time
[56:27] here's Joshua and Caleb they're cutting
[56:29] their standing right there and calling
[56:31] the devil a liar you see in this hour
[56:35] what you think about this how many times
[56:36] you find it right through the tapes in
[56:39] the message how many times brother
[56:41] Branham will bring right back up and
[56:43] he'll bring up he said remember the
[56:45] first time when I went out what I
[56:46] preached before I left this Tabernacle
[56:49] those of you that listen to the message
[56:51] you know he says I always come back to
[56:54] that it was like during David meeting
[56:56] Goliath Goliath and dis hours making his
[56:59] boast but there's got to be some
[57:02] to go and meet him don't you don't you
[57:04] see God in this hour he came on the
[57:08] scene and he was vindicating his word oh
[57:10] my elder brother ramble say it over and
[57:13] over
[57:13] he said the pillar fire did not come
[57:15] because of me he said he came for us and
[57:19] he said he came by me he said because I
[57:21] was standing on the world of truth let
[57:24] me tell you something if we are standing
[57:26] upon that same word that same pillar of
[57:30] fire that accompanied and delivered this
[57:32] word that same angel of the Covenant
[57:35] it's here tonight he's here with us as
[57:38] the children of God to back up every
[57:41] word to back the devil off any hope that
[57:44] he might have and to be able to proclaim
[57:46] that every word of God is JN amen
[57:51] somebody's got to call him a liar
[57:56] sometimes it has to be the pastor to do
[57:59] it sometimes it's got to be you to do it
[58:02] come on somebody sometimes you've got to
[58:06] do it right in your home that's enough
[58:09] that's a lie
[58:10] were you talking about me no I'm talking
[58:13] about you I'm speaking to that spirit
[58:16] come on somebody this for recognize we
[58:19] are dealing with demon spirits that
[58:22] would love to try to affront and to come
[58:25] into the home and try to attack the Word
[58:27] of God but as children of God that have
[58:30] access to his name let him stand right
[58:33] there with the token apply as they Satan
[58:36] you're alive you have no place here
[58:40] [Applause]
[58:43] we're living in a different time so what
[58:47] God is still God and God ain't altering
[58:53] his promise he don't got to change it to
[58:56] make it a more easier read he don't got
[59:00] to do it so it becomes a more cool hit
[59:02] thing and people can understand it
[59:05] better if it's wrote in a different way
[59:07] nope he himself who gave the word
[59:11] and deliver the word it's here to reveal
[59:14] the word as a matter of fact the Prophet
[59:16] tells us in the seals how Satan sly and
[59:19] slick deceptive manner he said there's
[59:22] absolutely nobody that can outdo him but
[59:25] the holy go this is where Paul could
[59:34] have such a confidence within the
[59:36] revelation that had been delivered
[59:39] through him he said if any man in him
[59:43] any angel from heaven you see where
[59:46] Paul's bringing it down he said I don't
[59:47] care if it's an angel from heaven I
[59:48] don't care if it has all these signs and
[59:50] the hands and all this other stuff can
[59:52] go on and whatever more I don't care if
[59:55] it is contrary to this gospel let him be
[59:59] accursed
[1:00:00] Paul said I don't care who they are Paul
[1:00:03] even put it to himself he said though we
[1:00:05] Paul said if I would happen to go astray
[1:00:10] don't you drift from this revelation
[1:00:16] let him be a curse but you see as we
[1:00:20] said moments ago remember any any
[1:00:23] Kingdom or country has spies in it we've
[1:00:28] got spies from other nations here and
[1:00:30] we've got spies from our nations in
[1:00:31] their country spies and Satan has spies
[1:00:35] Satan spies are to come within the word
[1:00:39] and to try to take from us the promises
[1:00:42] that belong to us try to make it out as
[1:00:45] though it's just for a day gone by you
[1:00:48] know God really don't move like that now
[1:00:50] God used to move like that before Biddy
[1:00:52] don't move like that now Satan spies
[1:00:54] will come along and tell people well you
[1:00:56] know it God really looks on your heart
[1:00:58] he does but what's in your heart will
[1:01:00] reflect on your body if your hearts not
[1:01:02] right with God it'll show outwardly and
[1:01:05] he will tell people well you know it
[1:01:07] really don't matter where you go to
[1:01:08] church that you know just as long as you
[1:01:10] go to church that's another lie it's all
[1:01:13] of these things of how that the devil
[1:01:15] himself will try to present lives notice
[1:01:18] he's not going to try to take the word
[1:01:20] on inner in and in a way from the people
[1:01:23] but he's going to give them
[1:01:24] this interpretation on it so that when
[1:01:27] they accept his trepidation they
[1:01:29] themselves have actually been removed
[1:01:31] from the original gospel by Satan's lies
[1:01:34] and let me tell you something
[1:01:36] Satan spies are not born of the truth
[1:01:39] they are transplanted or they are
[1:01:42] planted or crept in and the whole
[1:01:45] objective listen to me now do you
[1:01:47] realize that these men do not even
[1:01:49] realize that they are deceived
[1:01:51] themselves Paul tells us in the book of
[1:01:54] a first Timothy he said they are
[1:01:57] deceiving and being deceived and the end
[1:02:00] their end will be destruction according
[1:02:03] to the deception that they themselves
[1:02:04] have been ministering and be under I'll
[1:02:06] tell you what it's important in this
[1:02:08] hour to be under the truth it's
[1:02:12] important to abide within the truth and
[1:02:14] the real reality of the doctrine of
[1:02:17] Jesus Christ I'll tell you even other
[1:02:19] lies that's come around here especially
[1:02:21] over the last few years and seem to be
[1:02:23] prominent it's rare that people feel I
[1:02:25] can somehow that they don't need to go
[1:02:27] to church no more they'll just stay home
[1:02:29] and get it from the horse's mouth that's
[1:02:31] a lie from the pits of hell that is
[1:02:33] nothing that the Prophet ever thought
[1:02:35] it's us in stand in the scripture it is
[1:02:38] not according to the original gospel it
[1:02:40] is not the truth it is a lie whom I
[1:02:47] think of this Satan's spies surely you
[1:02:53] all don't believe that Satan would say
[1:02:55] oh the message of the hour I couldn't
[1:03:00] get around that no he follows where
[1:03:04] truth is remember if he can't keep you
[1:03:07] from it he'll try to push you beyond it
[1:03:11] this is where that the Bible had these
[1:03:14] men and women brothers and sisters the
[1:03:16] Bible records it in revelations chapter
[1:03:18] 2 that they themselves had tried them
[1:03:21] which said they were apostles you know
[1:03:23] an apostle is one who is sent right one
[1:03:27] who is sent so they were they were
[1:03:29] saying they were apostles you know what
[1:03:31] they were saying they were saying that
[1:03:33] they themselves were actually sent by
[1:03:35] God but if they were sent by God
[1:03:37] remember
[1:03:37] the Bible says how can they preach and
[1:03:39] let they be sent and Jesus said as the
[1:03:41] father has sent me so send I you
[1:03:44] and there was proved out in that hour
[1:03:46] that these men were not apostles they
[1:03:49] found them to be liars I wonder how long
[1:03:52] it took them before they finally found
[1:03:54] them as liars they found it where these
[1:03:56] men were not staying true to the gospel
[1:03:59] that Paul had preached they begin to
[1:04:02] twisted they begin to move it in some
[1:04:04] manner but the elect of God not by their
[1:04:06] intuitiveness not by their smartness not
[1:04:09] by having a paragraph here and here and
[1:04:11] having their smartphone in church and
[1:04:13] looking it up they would know it by the
[1:04:16] characteristic that these this ministry
[1:04:19] is trying to do away with the very deity
[1:04:22] of Jesus Christ it will your honor was
[1:04:24] doing it was trying to remove holiness
[1:04:27] from the people and the Prophet takes
[1:04:30] this exact scripture and he said these
[1:04:32] people for them holiness was not a
[1:04:34] phrase it was a way of life and he said
[1:04:37] because it was a way of life with them
[1:04:39] they could spot and they tried these
[1:04:41] individuals by the word that Paul had
[1:04:44] given and they found him to be last you
[1:04:46] know what that was that was the true
[1:04:48] Church of the Living God
[1:04:49] remaining holiness unto the Lord now you
[1:04:53] think about it in your life in my life
[1:04:55] and for you and I remaining holiness
[1:04:57] unto the Lord if there is anything that
[1:05:00] comes our way that does not dovetail
[1:05:02] with the word and hold up the Word of
[1:05:05] God the Prophet tells it just like this
[1:05:06] he said let it be a liar if someone
[1:05:09] would tell you that you've got a right
[1:05:10] to be baptized in the name of the Father
[1:05:13] and Son and Holy Ghost let him be a liar
[1:05:14] to you he said if someone tells you it's
[1:05:17] all right to Bob your hair and things
[1:05:19] like that yaller wear a hat in church
[1:05:20] for a bonnet to be a covering you let
[1:05:22] him be a liar to you for the word of God
[1:05:25] is the truth any of these things that's
[1:05:27] against the word let it be alive let it
[1:05:33] be alive just that's it it's a life so
[1:05:36] this is our holiness unto the Lord you
[1:05:38] say holiness is much deeper although I
[1:05:40] believe in a real holiness in our dress
[1:05:42] the way that we conduct ourselves the
[1:05:44] way that we dress ought to be holiness
[1:05:46] unto the Lord the way that we're at
[1:05:48] - they have the garment on the inside of
[1:05:50] our life it ought to be holiness unto
[1:05:52] the Lord and the way that we have so
[1:05:55] reserved ourself has the sacredness of
[1:05:58] the bride of Jesus Christ that we are
[1:06:00] reserved only unto Christ alone that our
[1:06:03] life our mind our body all of that is
[1:06:06] reserved for him and his word my hands
[1:06:09] were reserved to praise the Lord I might
[1:06:12] have to work I might have to do
[1:06:13] different things my eyes might have to
[1:06:15] you know read certain things but the
[1:06:17] reality my life upon this earth was
[1:06:20] meant to serve the Lord
[1:06:22] it was meant to reflect the glory of God
[1:06:24] it was made to manifest God in this
[1:06:27] generation it was made to be a
[1:06:29] tabernacle where the Holy Ghost himself
[1:06:32] would dwell and reflect his same nature
[1:06:35] his Excellency would be reflected
[1:06:38] through my life my life was not meant to
[1:06:40] be my own my life was meant to be alive
[1:06:43] that was served for his purpose
[1:06:45] this is holiness unto the Lord think of
[1:06:50] this here the dove of God on the inside
[1:06:52] leading us Romans three three four what
[1:06:55] if some did not believe shall their
[1:06:57] unbelief make the faith of God without
[1:06:59] effect
[1:07:00] god forbid yay let every let let ye and
[1:07:06] let God be true but every man a liar let
[1:07:13] God be true but every man alive
[1:07:16] notice 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 verse
[1:07:19] 18 notice but as God is true I love this
[1:07:23] as God is true our word towards you was
[1:07:29] not yaen named for the Son of God Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ who was preached among you by us
[1:07:35] even by me and Sylvanus and timotheus
[1:07:38] was not yay and nay but in him was yay
[1:07:43] let me just ask you what if you were
[1:07:45] going to a church that they would tell
[1:07:47] you you know what this promised God
[1:07:49] don't really he don't care about this or
[1:07:50] more what if they told you that and you
[1:07:52] went to a church well how do you know
[1:07:54] this really don't apply no more
[1:07:57] how could you have faith that God will
[1:08:00] keep the other part of his words you see
[1:08:04] faith is based on the Word of God and if
[1:08:07] you're going to tell me that one word
[1:08:09] all that still don't apply to this day
[1:08:11] then you have been able to extract and
[1:08:13] cut away a part of God then what what
[1:08:16] makes it so that you'll keep the rest of
[1:08:18] his word can't you see that this is what
[1:08:21] Satan if he can take one little point in
[1:08:24] the word and put a question over it he
[1:08:26] has got you dismantled but God's desire
[1:08:29] is we're by his Spirit to so breathe
[1:08:32] upon his word just so move through our
[1:08:35] life so we're in discouragement would
[1:08:37] want to come the breath of God moving in
[1:08:39] our life will absolutely dismantle
[1:08:42] discouragement sometimes people don't
[1:08:51] even realize when they're discouraged
[1:08:57] you understand what I just said some
[1:09:00] people don't even know when they're
[1:09:01] discouraged they're so caught up with
[1:09:04] everything that's wrong but the reason
[1:09:08] they don't recognize their
[1:09:09] discouragement is because they're right
[1:09:12] and they don't realize that that
[1:09:16] discouragement has so ate upon them in
[1:09:19] such a way that they're lifted up in
[1:09:21] pride and they don't realize that's
[1:09:25] discouragement you're actually
[1:09:29] discouraged but you see we need to
[1:09:32] understand God's Word is true notice
[1:09:34] this Paul goes on to say for all the
[1:09:37] promises of God in him are yay and in
[1:09:40] him Amen unto the glory of God by us
[1:09:46] first Timothy 4:1 the spirit speaketh
[1:09:49] expressly that in the latter times some
[1:09:51] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[1:09:54] to seducing spirits and doctrines of
[1:09:58] devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having
[1:10:05] their conscience seared with a hot iron
[1:10:08] now watch this this is conditions you
[1:10:10] see where these conditions are at these
[1:10:12] conditions are in the same place it was
[1:10:15] with the children of Israel we're fixing
[1:10:17] to break over into that Millennial day
[1:10:20] where is Satan all along and where is he
[1:10:24] sought he didn't he didn't seem you know
[1:10:26] right there within each if he came
[1:10:28] against him but notice a mixed multitude
[1:10:30] came out and all the way through the
[1:10:33] wilderness journey but then it comes to
[1:10:35] this place and he wants to discourage
[1:10:39] this place this is what the message was
[1:10:45] all about are you with me this is what
[1:10:48] it was all about and yet he's coming to
[1:10:52] try to bring discouragement you see the
[1:10:54] message never come so we'd have churches
[1:10:57] there is a result and a necessity of
[1:11:00] that are you with me there was a need
[1:11:02] for that but that was not so that we
[1:11:04] would have churches like the rest of the
[1:11:06] churches that was not the purpose of the
[1:11:08] message coming or so that we would have
[1:11:10] something different to preach but the
[1:11:12] coming of that message was bringing us
[1:11:15] back into that place that God had
[1:11:18] intended from the very beginning all of
[1:11:20] the types and shadows that was hidden
[1:11:22] that showed that God's desire was to
[1:11:25] bring us back to himself that you and I
[1:11:28] have a body that is waiting on us
[1:11:30] on the other side come on somebody there
[1:11:34] is a wedding supper to press for there
[1:11:36] is a millennium there is a future at
[1:11:39] home but gave heed to seducing spirits
[1:11:45] and doctrines of devils
[1:11:47] notice what's watch in this hour in
[1:11:50] Revelation 19 the Bible speaks of the
[1:11:53] bride of how it was granted unto us to
[1:11:55] be arrayed in fine linen clean and white
[1:11:57] for the fine linen is the righteousness
[1:11:59] of the saints
[1:12:00] verse 9 it says write blessed are they
[1:12:02] which are called under the marriage
[1:12:04] supper of the lamb and he said unto me
[1:12:06] these are the true sayings of God amen
[1:12:12] this message is not the ideology of man
[1:12:16] you understand friends Peter Ricker
[1:12:19] Peter recognized within that hour
[1:12:21] P
[1:12:21] was there to the Jews Paul was given
[1:12:24] that ministry unto the Gentiles which
[1:12:26] was hidden in the covenants back there
[1:12:29] and this was open to Paul and his Paul
[1:12:31] would minister these things remember the
[1:12:33] Jews had a hard time with understanding
[1:12:35] this but remember what Peter told him he
[1:12:38] said there are people who are unlearned
[1:12:40] and they are wrestling to their own
[1:12:42] destruction things that Paul said that's
[1:12:45] hard to be understood let me just say it
[1:12:47] to you like this when the God gave his
[1:12:49] prophet in this hour
[1:12:50] you see God gave to us eyes it was not
[1:12:53] the eyes of William Branham looking at
[1:12:56] the scriptures but it was God's thoughts
[1:12:58] that were being made known to you and I
[1:13:01] concerning the Word of God in this hour
[1:13:03] I tell you what you know what it does it
[1:13:05] opens up the Bible and makes the Bible
[1:13:08] become a new book the blood the Bible is
[1:13:11] no longer a closed book but let me say
[1:13:12] this to you without the Holy Ghost the
[1:13:15] message is still closed the Bible is
[1:13:17] still closed but with the Holy Ghost in
[1:13:20] your life it becomes open and you
[1:13:22] recognize and see the real purpose and
[1:13:26] the real meaning of his coming in this
[1:13:28] hour right blessed are they I'll tell
[1:13:32] you're blessed tonight you've had a
[1:13:34] divine invitation to the marriage supper
[1:13:37] of the Lamb let me tell you something
[1:13:39] you're just not on the guest list
[1:13:40] you are the reason there is a marriage
[1:13:42] supper hello yeah you were the one in
[1:13:46] whom it was made in mind all the little
[1:13:48] doilies on the table all the little
[1:13:50] fixtures that are reminders of the
[1:13:52] remnants of God's divine grace it was
[1:13:55] all been set aside oh ma
[1:13:57] what color is it that the bride loves
[1:13:59] the bride loves that blood the bride
[1:14:01] loves that one and that pureness
[1:14:03] it is all been set there by the Lord
[1:14:06] Himself and even as we sit there at the
[1:14:09] marriage supper of the Lamb it will be a
[1:14:11] memorial that is reset there we overcame
[1:14:15] in this life by the bread and by the
[1:14:18] wine that was served to us by our milk
[1:14:21] incident the Lord Jesus Christ it will
[1:14:25] be a time of communion there because
[1:14:29] right here when you stand and take
[1:14:30] communion here you're a testimony the
[1:14:33] Lord's coming
[1:14:35] and what's coming I am a witness that
[1:14:37] he's coming as long as you do this you
[1:14:43] do shew the Lord's death till he come
[1:14:46] you show that his death was not just a
[1:14:49] happening it was for you
[1:14:51] you show I was I was the reason he came
[1:14:54] and Annie and he came and he's come in
[1:14:57] me and because he came and he came in me
[1:15:00] he's coming back for me for here with me
[1:15:03] he came the corporal body ascended back
[1:15:06] up sent back the Holy Ghost and now that
[1:15:08] the Holy Ghost have been accepted in the
[1:15:10] Holy Ghost
[1:15:11] I will also be received in that place
[1:15:13] that we has reserved to meet you and I
[1:15:15] hey there is an appointed place for you
[1:15:19] now I'm telling you these are not the
[1:15:22] sayings of a man these are the true
[1:15:25] sayings of God how do you fight Satan's
[1:15:29] lies truth revelations 21 you okay they
[1:15:38] gonna be much longer
[1:15:39] revelations 21 even as he he sees the
[1:15:42] New Jerusalem descending from God
[1:15:44] they're out of heaven as a bride adorned
[1:15:48] for her husband in verse 5 and he that
[1:15:50] said upon the throne said behold I make
[1:15:53] all things new
[1:15:54] and he said write for these words are
[1:15:57] true and faithful you know the Bible
[1:16:01] says I believe it's isaiah 42:5
[1:16:03] it says he will not he will not cease he
[1:16:07] will not be discouraged until he has
[1:16:10] accomplished
[1:16:11] do you realize he's had much to be
[1:16:14] discouraged about how many times were
[1:16:18] maybe we've looked beyond things we've
[1:16:19] missed certain things or we've let down
[1:16:22] on this and had to be corrected there
[1:16:23] but do you realize he's looking at his
[1:16:26] word and because listen now because he's
[1:16:29] looking at his word that's why you
[1:16:31] correct us that's why he'll chasing us
[1:16:34] that's why he'll rebuke us you won't
[1:16:37] know what he's doing he is breaking a
[1:16:39] lie that would like to try to hold back
[1:16:42] from us the truth that belongs
[1:16:45] yes well this is a such a hard hour to
[1:16:51] raise children in our children that's a
[1:16:53] lie but some you say in any in a hard
[1:16:57] hour I'm saying you're looking at the
[1:16:59] wrong thing I'm saying God is still
[1:17:03] greater than any devil God is greater
[1:17:07] than any circumstance
[1:17:09] I don't care there's a lot more pitfalls
[1:17:12] there's a lot more temptation remember
[1:17:14] brother Ram tells us he said with you
[1:17:16] would go to start telling he said your
[1:17:18] children your temptations you had he
[1:17:20] said they'd laugh at you because what
[1:17:22] they face is much greater now but it's
[1:17:24] still the same devil and there's one
[1:17:27] antidote and there's one remedy for the
[1:17:29] devil and that is the Lord God Himself
[1:17:33] God didn't give us a word he gave us
[1:17:36] himself to fight the devil with come on
[1:17:39] somebody program tells us he said that

[1:23:26] that he was on his way to drop off
[1:23:28] Rebecca at school the kids and on the
[1:23:32] radio there came this program that was
[1:23:34] wanting to explain how creation was
[1:23:38] formed and lay all this scientific
[1:23:41] evidence in Bodrum says I I he said I
[1:23:46] came out he said in I realized he said
[1:23:48] it was Satan just trying to punch it me
[1:23:51] he said I came out and dropping Rebekah
[1:23:53] off to school he said I got back in the
[1:23:56] car and I watch I started to turn it
[1:23:59] back on he said but then I'll thought
[1:24:03] I'll get into that same stuff again so I
[1:24:06] turned it off you see first of all he
[1:24:09] recognized I don't need that junk they
[1:24:14] can say what they want to say on their
[1:24:16] YouTube channel I don't need that junk
[1:24:18] you understand we ought to be the Bible
[1:24:22] says keeping yourselves in the love of
[1:24:24] God praying in the Holy Ghost building
[1:24:27] up your most holy faith we don't
[1:24:31] entertain lies we we are lovers of the
[1:24:37] truth amen and the truth is not a
[1:24:41] doctrine it is the person of Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ for he said I am the way the
[1:24:47] truth and the life but a bantam says I
[1:24:51] turned it I turned it off can I read
[1:24:53] this to you he said I was going on up
[1:24:56] the street and Satan said to me said do
[1:24:59] you know that this man that you called
[1:25:01] Jesus was just a man like one day in his
[1:25:04] day like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts he
[1:25:07] was just a man that they begin a few
[1:25:10] people together around him and say he's
[1:25:12] a great man after a while he become
[1:25:15] greater and and then he become a God to
[1:25:17] him and and it scattered all over the
[1:25:19] world since he's dead and that's all and
[1:25:21] brother Graham said I thought how a liar
[1:25:26] you are got the point it may not be good
[1:25:29] grammar but you got the point how a liar
[1:25:32] you are that's the first thought but
[1:25:36] Samuel the devil's been talking me
[1:25:38] how do I know when he's lying nyng nyng
[1:25:40] nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng nyng
[1:25:41] nyng a naming he opened his mouth I
[1:25:46] thought how a liar you are and then I
[1:25:51] turned as I was crossing Graham Street
[1:25:53] and I said Satan you that's talking to
[1:25:57] my conscience you know brother Graham
[1:26:00] said don't let him stand in your
[1:26:01] conscience questions answer 64 he said
[1:26:04] don't let him stand in your conscience
[1:26:05] and punch at you I'd like to ask you a
[1:26:08] few things
[1:26:10] who was that the Hebrew prophet spoke of
[1:26:13] that would come who was that unknown in
[1:26:16] Messiah who was it upon those men who
[1:26:18] first saw him and told his life
[1:26:20] thousands of years before he got here he
[1:26:23] says who was it that it foretold just to
[1:26:26] the letter and when he come they said he
[1:26:27] was numbered with the transgressors he
[1:26:29] was wounded for our transgressions and
[1:26:31] he was he may one made his grave with
[1:26:33] the rich and he would rise up the third
[1:26:35] day and he did and then he promised the
[1:26:38] Holy Ghost and I've got it so you might
[1:26:41] as well get away from me because it's
[1:26:43] written in the word and every word is
[1:26:46] true then he left just give him the word
[1:26:55] that does it he can't spend that word
[1:26:59] for it's inspired no wonder David could
[1:27:04] say the word of the Lord has tried he's
[1:27:06] a buckler to all those that trust him
[1:27:08] some proverbs 35 every word of God is
[1:27:12] pure
[1:27:13] he's a shield unto them that put their
[1:27:15] trust in him Deuteronomy 33 29 happy our
[1:27:28] towel Israel who is like unto the old
[1:27:31] people saved by the Lord
[1:27:33] the shield of the help turned us down
[1:27:35] and who who is the who is the sword and
[1:28:21] the Holy Spirit revealed to her said I
[1:28:24] see what it is there's a lie that's been
[1:28:26] totally a black sheet that's been
[1:28:28] following you it's got your pastor and
[1:28:30] them all worked up he said and that was
[1:28:32] told to you by man that was professing
[1:28:34] divine healing he said what did he say
[1:28:36] sister don't pay no attention to them
[1:28:40] you know why it's a lie
[1:28:44] come on somebody you see paying
[1:28:47] attention to lives allows that sheet to
[1:28:50] follow you can see it here tonight poke
[1:28:54] poke poke poke come on somebody and the
[1:29:01] devil rules another time and said oh
[1:29:03] he's God on the mountain but he ain't
[1:29:04] God in the valley God said I heard that
[1:29:07] challenge
[1:29:08] I heard that challenge I'm just caught
[1:29:13] on the mountain and not God on the
[1:29:14] valley I proved to you that on God in
[1:29:17] the valley oh my if David himself think
[1:29:22] about it if David would have entertained
[1:29:25] what Goliath was saying Goliath was was
[1:29:28] saying a lot of stuff but every bit of
[1:29:31] it David tied it all together and said
[1:29:33] it ain't nothing but a lie because David
[1:29:36] said it what David what are you looking
[1:29:37] at look at his armor look at his spear
[1:29:40] look at his size David said I to an
[1:29:42] uncircumcised Philistine
[1:29:45] he don't got a covenant he don't got a
[1:29:47] God backing him up but I am a covenant
[1:29:50] you there's a covenant god I'm
[1:29:53] circumcised in the Covenant I've been
[1:29:55] anointed by God and that devil cannot
[1:29:58] stand before God's people
[1:30:00] David the luteal and stature had a great
[1:30:03] big God standing on the inside and stood
[1:30:06] there and called the devil a liar
[1:30:10] Shamgar got tired one day getting beat
[1:30:13] up he got fed up with it I know it might
[1:30:17] just be one little scripture in the
[1:30:20] Bible where he took an ox coat but you
[1:30:22] see there was a mystery written in his
[1:30:24] life and it was sealed up into this hour
[1:30:27] and the Prophet could go back there and
[1:30:29] say Shamgar
[1:30:30] he got to thinking one day when they got
[1:30:33] back time for them to Philistines and
[1:30:35] them to come up and take his crops he
[1:30:37] got to thinking I am a seed of Abraham
[1:30:40] I've got a covenant you know what he got
[1:30:42] to thinking on he got to thinking on who
[1:30:45] was behind him let me tell you something
[1:30:47] it's not a church backing but it's the
[1:30:50] backing of heaven by Almighty God
[1:30:53] himself this is where we are weapons of
[1:30:59] our warfare are not carnal but they're
[1:31:04] mighty through God to the pulling down
[1:31:06] of strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:31:11] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:31:15] into the obedience of Christ
[1:31:19] your allies there's a victory over
[1:31:21] discouragement I'm hot I told you I was
[1:31:25] coming down I want to get to this point
[1:31:27] right here you can look at Caleb and you
[1:31:30] could say Caleb how could you be so bold
[1:31:33] you ain't even in the land yet how can
[1:31:37] you be talking about a promise so sure
[1:31:39] that you you're not even in the land yet
[1:31:43] but you know what it was
[1:31:45] Caleb's heart was already in tune with
[1:31:48] God his heart was already in the land
[1:31:52] hallelujah he was speaking from his
[1:31:55] intellect he was speaking from his lips
[1:31:57] he was speaking from his heart if God be
[1:32:02] for us who can be against us I tell you
[1:32:07] what you know you know that devil can
[1:32:09] say well who are you to say that any
[1:32:11] promises yours you don't even have the
[1:32:13] Holy Ghost yet but you've got a rock to
[1:32:16] stand there and call the devil a liar
[1:32:18] and say the Holy Ghost belongs to me
[1:32:21] they mail it belongs to me
[1:32:24] God has vindicated his word to be the
[1:32:27] truth and not only that but you can look
[1:32:29] down in your life and see how God has
[1:32:32] dealt with your life where he is moved
[1:32:34] in your life where he has worked to
[1:32:36] dismantle holds of the enemy you can
[1:32:38] stand on the Word of God tonight and you
[1:32:41] can call Satan a liar
[1:32:43] I don't care the devil I don't care of
[1:32:46] all the doctors reports and everything
[1:32:48] else that's been said you're able to
[1:32:50] stand on the authority of God's Word and
[1:32:53] say Satan you're a liar let me tell you
[1:32:57] some what the preaching of the gospel
[1:32:58] does it dismantles Satan if you could
[1:33:04] watch right here let me tell you
[1:33:05] something I'm not just saying this right
[1:33:07] here I have a witness this and
[1:33:09] counseling sessions over and over again
[1:33:12] then right there where there would be
[1:33:14] such negative talk coming in I just
[1:33:17] can't or I this or I that and you say
[1:33:20] but the same and what did you do just
[1:33:21] wait it on him I'm as helpless as
[1:33:25] helpless can be y'all realize it ain't a
[1:33:30] lot of hate ain't like well there's been
[1:33:32] so many battle there been a lot of
[1:33:33] battles right back there in that room
[1:33:35] and a lot of em and where Satan himself
[1:33:37] has been warped by the Lord Jesus let me
[1:33:42] just be clear by the Lord Jesus and when
[1:33:47] it's been right there let me tell you
[1:33:49] something you can watch how that when
[1:33:51] the Spirit of God begins to move down
[1:33:53] I've watched it to where people that did
[1:33:55] not have seen like the faith more
[1:33:57] seemingly so far away from him and you
[1:33:59] watch the Spirit of God moved out and
[1:34:01] the Holy Spirit begin to give a word and
[1:34:04] then man I feel the stream is open I
[1:34:06] feel the opening you say what do you do
[1:34:08] I get right in that stream and allow the
[1:34:10] Holy Ghost who's doing the talking to
[1:34:13] keep on talking and you watch the very
[1:34:15] countenance of the person begin to
[1:34:17] change you know what's happening Satan's
[1:34:20] holds are being dismantled the lies that
[1:34:23] he has told it is being exposed he is
[1:34:27] being called a liar by the Holy Ghost
[1:34:30] that's the same way it isn't services
[1:34:32] Devils can be there upon you trying to
[1:34:35] discourage you keep you back where

[1:34:41] and you've met your end wants to do
[1:34:42] deflecting upon God but remember you can
[1:34:45] stand upon God's Word and say I'm a
[1:34:47] believer you know brother Ram says when
[1:34:52] you repent and are baptized in the name
[1:34:53] of the Lord Jesus Christ he said if you
[1:34:55] don't receive the Holy Ghost you may God
[1:34:56] a liar he cares to you 1963 but I

[1:37:37] leg and bend it back and try to take
[1:37:39] their toe and move it out of joint to
[1:37:42] bring the person to submission Satan's
