love him today yes sir and we want to overcome Satan today um I believe scripture really has to guide us I I'm really I should have testified a long time ago um with my father's heart attack and back in 2017 and I do apologize but it's all God's timing he gave me scripture had no idea what to do with it um took obviously seven and a half years to come up here uh but the I just discern the spirit prayed and prayed and prayed what does this mean Finally Revealed it and um I am blessed to be in front of people that understand Revelation and have taught me Revelation so thank you yes sir I'm looking at a bag of prayer cloths and that's truly your prayers have saved my life so thank you um it knew nothing about the message in 2017 um but you know sometimes God has a scary way of teaching and you know when you get a call at your dad's having a cardiac event you you get scared so I went to the cardiac unit in fairv hospital hospital and uh my uh my stepmother and I witnessed the massive heart attack right there just as soon as I walked into the door um and he was in a coma for about 3 weeks it was terrible worst traumatic thing I've ever been through um and you know during that coma is when uh my wife and uh my mother-in-law and sister mercy and sister Olga introduced me to a prayer cloth and said it came from bwt I said what's that they told me all about it but they didn't push it on me they didn't over describe it they were patient they their faith was just steadfast and but they were silent too they were just were very patient I do remember that and thank you very much I thank my family uh for that love and for the church your love as well please can you clap for yourself and for Jesus please thank you it must have been a Thursday service that you guys uh they got from the church Friday Night We snuck in there because there was quite a spiritual battle going on uh when you have half a family that believes in Christ the other half that doesn't and there's a coma and there's a person's life on the line it gets very tense and dramatic so we had to sneak it in there uh we all four or five of us prayed around his his body he's in a coma still and then that Saturday morning I went by myself and literally put my feet on or put my hands on his feet and his eyes came right right open it took it took only eight hours for him to come come awake with the prayer cloth on him so thank you very much I still a lot of confusion I still had scripture there in the following months um and you know that scripture was uh Genesis 26 and it's about Isaac digging up his father father's Wells and how Satan through the Philistines had stopped them up with the Earth and um he just kept telling me dig dig dig dig out the soil prise the Lord and um yes sir really didn't know what that meant other than have faith um what was hard is when he survived got out of the hospital still tension with the families he wasn't going to be in my life the way he used to be um he went back to smoking went back to drinking went back to his ways and that's why it took me so long to testify um and you know those things can follow you you think you're defeated you think you're defeated but you're not um but I truly thought I was I truly thought it was why did this happen it was just it just so a few months ago I made the decision to reconcile with him and meet up with him um and I just had to speak the name of Jesus to him and just see what he his reaction so I'm like if we're already at a bad point so he can't get worse so I met up with him I I just hugged him said I love you and I said um do you know that Jesus Christ saved you when you were in a coma and he said yes I do um and I said what how do you know you're in a coma and he said he had a vision or a Dream It's the only thing you can remember wow and it was me and my brother he said you guys had these huge fancy cameras and you were on a train and you were traveling the world on this train it was a strangest dream because a train can't go over water but it was happening and you guys were sh shooting a film and the title of the film was 33 and he said I did some research on 33 and it's a very Angelic number and it brought me to Jesus Christ and that he was 33 years old when he was crucified not sure the hidden meanings of the dream but the point is it got him to know that Jesus saved him and I thank Jesus Christ for that I thank his word I thank Genesis 26 um and I'd also like to declare this testimon is for both my parents uh I'd like to declare my mom is cancer free as of a couple months ago and um I searched for scripture there couldn't find out anybody God brought me back to Genesis 26 again and digging it up digging it up she had she had so many unresolved emotions with her her parents that passed away and her husband my stepfather who passed away uh and her brother and her firstborn son who who's still with us but is not a Believer uh I believe he is but we're just digging and digging and having faith and praying for him uh his name is Dean so please pray for him please pray for my dad his name is Joseph Savage um and I'm just not going to give up so one thing at a time and I thank you guys so much please just pray pray pray keep praying um that so good and thank you for the testimony isn't just mine it's yours too because of the prayer cloth and I found that in scripture as well uh Revelation 12:11 speaks of overcoming Satan and it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of your testimony and uh their testimony that means our testimony so it's not just for me and my family it's for all of us uh in the prayers and Drake wants to sing and just praise the Lord so thank you very much all [Applause] right there go I I'm

a beautiful day amen I I'll take the Christmas as long as the sun is shining there's always something about it you know when the sun is shining it just seems like it just does something for you and you know we we live in a place uh here in Northern Ohio which to me I love it uh and I'm glad I do because if I didn't my you always be looking for somebody else but we we live in a place that you know they they tell us when those the the gray skies and things start coming over that we don't get enough vitamin D during the winter time and that that lack of the vitamin is actually what'll lead to gloomy thoughts that's right depression and other things like that that we have to battle and sometimes not talking about maybe things severity but you know I'm glad that there's a vitamin that's always present that no matter how how cloudy the scon the skies might get the Lord Jesus is always the same amen and he is he is the joy of our life and we can always find strength from him and I do appreciate these days like this I do appreciate that and you know what if we didn't have cloudy days sometimes how could you ever really appreciate the sunshine is that right it's the same thing Even in our Christian walk if we did not have the valleys and most of our walk with God is valleys we would never appreciate the mountain tops amen don't you love him this morning amen so good to be together and uh of my on behalf of my wife and myself I want to just say thank you last week for uh the gifts and the the thoughtful words words that were expressed and I so appreciate that very much we we together and I want to say thank you and may God richly bless you I didn't let the apple pie get me to where it started a downfall you know one cheat day turns into two week month then you're just a cheater you know cheaters never Prosper but uh amen you love the Lord amen we are so thankful for his Mercy this morning and perhaps as we just bow our heads and our hearts in prayer and just go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord how thankful we are for the privilege and the opportunity that we have to be able to come together Lord and to assemble ourselves Lord as brothers and sisters of like Precious Faith Lord there's one objective there's one desire that we have and father that's to see you glorified Lord that's oh God the greatest desire of our hearts is Lord the coming of the Lord father it's in your presence Lord nowhere else do we feel at home outside of your presence Lord and Lord Jesus to think that God that one of these days that the same presence of God that we dwell in that Lord that you would come and move upon our lives and our hearts and not only change us but change us from glory to glory and your presence would come Lord time and time again Lord our hearts Lord just long for that time Lord that God even after Lord that of the Rapture and return back here during that Millennium where the knowledge of the Lord shall fill the Earth the land sea and sky oh God a a work of sanctification upon the Earth Lord your presence moving Lord among us and then oh God the future home setting down lord just as you have Lord tabernacled yourself in our lives Lord to think that one of these days when the Earth itself will be restored to its upright condition father as we will dwell in the presence of God that Lord Jesus throughout all of this Earth to We The Very plan of God that where eternity Lord will be hide right back together Lord we love you Lord I pray God let there not be one heart Among Us those that would stream or archive that would miss that Lord that's the Lord that's the Glorious Mark that we have before us Lord oh God any achievement that we could ever achieve in life it never Lord would amount or matter as it would oh God father to stand there Lord on that day and Lord everything that we would do for you Lord may we do it father as unto you Lord I pray that you would give us Grace this morning as we would look into your word and Lord we just desire to be just a mouthpiece that you could use you see Lord the needs that we have here and Lord I just want to follow you father we ask that you'll just have your way now Among Us in a special way in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen amen if you will turn with me to Ephesians chapter 4 amen I'm going to I want I don't want to read I do but I don't want to read all the vers here this morning we've um went into this and if we could let's read here verses verse one Paul said I therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation that's the feast where with ye are called that Feast that we've been called to how many knows we've not just been called um to the Pentecostal Feast but we've been called To The Feast of Tabernacles and that's that's where God has brought us to now and I don't want to dwell so much in that because it's his presence dwelling in temporary booths it's God dwelling we're living in that hour where Christ and his people are one would you go to verse two Brianna please with all lonliness and meek with longsuffering forbearing one another in love go ahead and go to the next verse please endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace and then if you would just skip down with me to uh verse 22 Paul says that ye put off concerning the form former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness it's so it's not it's not us creating ourselves we are his creation that's right we are his workmanship it's God bringing forth for himself in our lives so it's it's all of speaking of the rest amen may God bless you and bless his word as you're being seated and I want to just read one more scripture here where Paul would say in verse 27 neither give place to the devil and then in verse 30 he would say and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption and I would like to if the Lord would help us we've been um looking here for a few services and some things that the Lord just really uh begin to inspire to my heart here just a few weeks ago and looking at sometimes things that can become hindrances and it's not things that are all together obvious but it's things that can become so subtle and that's always Satan's is always his disguise and his way is to try to in any way come under cover remember brother BR would tell us when he's preaching the first seal he said that Satan is able to outsmart anyone he said but there's one that he cannot outdo and that's the holy spirit so this is where we want to rely upon God so completely is Lord I I want your leadership I want I want your discernment within it because Satan is very subtle in in our Humanity our human our humanness can never pick him up or detect him it takes the spirit of God within us because it's a spiritual battle and Satan's desire when we look at this with hindrances Bri if you want to go ahead and switch that please when you look at this with hindrances it's just like it's just very simply it's things that would hinder us or prevent and remember you and I God has called us to be the branches of the vine the bran the vine itself cannot bear fruit without the branches but the branch cannot bear any fruit without the life of the vine flowing through it and there's many things that like brother brand would tell us in the message uh of where that Satan would like to he use the terms clog up the channels of Our Lives to hinder and to prevent things it's just like if you have something in your body and something is not operating correctly like sometimes with the heart and maybe there's a buildup of you know cholesterol whatever more and I don't mean to damper anybody's day but um you know sometimes when those things aren't working right when the flow of the blood is not right that can be a serious thing it can cut off the flow of the oxygen to certain places and certain limbs of the body so there's always a way that God God has made for you and I that we are washed with the washing of Water by the word the the it is the it is the ministering of the word of God the transforming power that has the ability and to take care of the sin question and it also has within it the strength to cleanse you and I continually keeping us in a place that God himself might be able to make himself known through our lives and if you can we can just see it in that way this is what God has called us to be as channels now I had no idea uh what brother uh Drake was going to refer to and I think I heard this within here but this was something was striking my heart yesterday and um and when I looked at this in the scriptures and this scripture just kept moving in my heart and there's a statement brother brandham was saying kept striking me as I was going back through the message humble thyself yesterday and that is where remember when they came to this place um that Elisha Jehoshaphat was there with with ahab's uh son I believe it was and when he come to this place they had went off without taking provision for water and they came to a dry place and they were now they needed they needed an answer and God himself provided an answer through a channel but I want you to notice before they ever could could get an answer and the digging ever come that way God had to first get his ordained channel for that inspiration would flow through which was Elisha he had to get him in the right mood is that right Elisha would said you know he looked over there you know and he said look if it was not for Jehoshaphat I would't even look at you and it wasn't he was saying that to be you know in one way indifferent I'm not trying to lift Elisha up but you know to recognize that here when you have something that's rejected rejected rejected rejected but it's because of jehoshaphat's presence that brought Elisha there on the scene where Jehoshaphat was willing to Humble himself and say look there is no way out of this situation we need the help of God and here an ordained Channel by the name of Elisha he he's he he knew exactly what was needed for his own life bring me a Minstrel and as the minstrel would begin to play that song it changed changed the atmosphere and as it began I I don't know what song he played but I can you know pretty much tell you like brother Bram says he probably wasn't playing or singing Nearer My God to thee maybe he was saying I'm taking it back you know I'm going to take back my attitude I'm going to take back the right way I I don't know what he was I don't know but you know brother Bram would you know he would always say that in regards to Paul Raider when they came in and they were singing certain songs and Paul Raider said wait a minute who's dying here me or you so there's just certain songs that call for certain occasions and so God knows that I mean that you know taking it back what the enemy called for me I don't think that would probably be appropriate for a funeral but I don't know I mean it may happen so I don't want to make a tradition out of it but you understand what I'm saying and and I think to me when you can see a humility that Elisha realized I'm not in the right frame of mind I'm not in the right condition I I I need a minstral to play a song and let me just say say it to you and I like this you and I were in no condition to be able to receive from God in this hour but God himself descended down it was not anything of the Earth or any Earthly musician but God himself who set forth every promise in his word he came forward and took the book and loosed the seals thereof and there is a new song that has broke out and the word itself has changed the atmosphere to where we're not looking at our inabilities or at least that's God's desire and the effect of dwelling in the atmosphere of the word it takes us beyond the human Veil to where that we're not relying upon man because that's even where uh the ladyo seean age which we're still in that age but that's exactly even where Pentecost got off is relying upon the human Veil God sent them super Supernatural gifts is that right and brother BR says that you have taken the supernatural gifts and made a tradition out of genuine articles it it had to always happen it had to always be this way and so when it wasn't when it when God God every way that God works brother B says you'll never pull something out of God God is Sovereign amen it's always Sovereign and so we always want to be in that place as we been looking at this for some weeks of just being in a place to where we're a channel that inspiration can drop into because we're made we we are the listen if there's anybody upon the face of the Earth and I'm not elevating us I'm just saying I'm elevating God's forn knowledge that if there is ever a people that is to be inspired that inspiration can only come and move within the seed of God that can actually be inspired by God the same inspiration that struck the prophets and they would write beyond their own understanding now the same inspiration comes upon the word to make the word live and that inspiration operating through you and I it makes it makes the word or interprets it according to how God thought it and he spoke it so there is no glory of our own amen God has set this atmosphere and that's where Satan he wants to try to always to poke that atmosphere always trying to get us out of that atmosphere and try to you know bring us down within things but remember it's the word that creates the atmosphere it's not mind over matter it's not positive thinking because the only thing that's positive is the word of God that's what's that's where we get into the real things that are positive and so now here comes a need of a situation we need water and water is a type of the spirit of God we need this water and the inspiration comes upon Elisha and he says get your shovels out thus saith the Lord make this Valley full of ditches I don't know about you but sometimes you know you can get tired of digging certain things you know brother Willie you know what I'm talking about you can get tired of digging but can you imagine they might have got a little tired when they were digging but you know what you want water we want more water we just don't want a trickle of water we just don't want a trickle of water God has promised us in this hour not a trickle of water even as it shows in the Book of Ezekiel we're not even called to ankle deep water we're not even called to waste deep water but we are called to water that you can swim in Hallelujah and what that speaks of in the Book of Ezekiel we are called to a complete full Birth by the word of God that has been delivered through Malachi 4 we have received a word from God that brings complete and total Deliverance through a complete relying upon almighty God I thank God for his grace Amen to lead us on out into those places and and give us Grace and so here notice he said for thus sayith the Lord You shall not see wind you neither shall you see rain yet that Valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye and your cattle and your Beast it's going to have to be a lot of water because they've also got to take care of the cattle and the Beast East Now watch how brother BR says this and humble thyself he says just keep praying keep digging yeah don't stop just like Elijah told him dig ditches out there when you get down and you hit an old Tin Can how many ever been digging and hitting things rocks and everything else yeah when you hit an old tin can say I'm too tired I mean sometimes I've dug and I've hit Roots I mean you almost feel like where do I where do I go on or do I just look the planet somewhere else when you hit an old 10 can say I'm too tired throw it out of the way and keep digging just keep digging cause we've got to dig we just got to dig that's all because if you expect to miss the tribulation you better start digging now for myself I'm preaching to myself there I'm going to start digging deeper than I ever Doug how many want to dig a Little Deeper amen I I certainly want to dig a little deeper and how that the spirit of God would so move through our lives that to comb out the things that maybe you know it's something that goes much deeper than maybe the trench where we're at right now but the ditch the deeper that we can dig it out the brother R says the more you can dig out the more of the water of the spirit that flow from Emmanuel's veins can flow out to you because it's a supernatural working they didn't have to supply the water God supplied the water it was a supernatural happening all they had to do was get the dirt out of the way and let me tell you the biggest pile of dirt is this right here and you right there that that's the dirt we got to get out of the way the Earth this Humanity that that that so much of the carnality God help me to dig it out of the way that the spirit of God can flow right down as a channel that's right so we want to look at one of these hindrances here this morning we want to deal with this subtleness of pride pride you know as we can speak of it is you know brother BR would classify it and he would talk about those tiny he says it like this tiny horrible Little Devils called pride and he would speak of them in in that way and you know in different things of how pride is one of the worst things that the devil could ever put on you and remember that Pride itself when we consider it I want you to cons I want you to look at it and think of it in this way when you look down through the scriptures and looking with things Pride itself is really a condition of what's going on in the heart it's things that that the thoughts that are there now listen e every one of us we have to battle because let me remind you this first birth is a product of Pride against the word of God when Eve herself took some was talked into taking some better way and talked into it by the fact of that you shall be as God's God had already given his word which was to bring the atmosphere of Faith but when she begin to listen to Satan's wisdom wisdom begin to just kind of hinder the Faith as she listened to it let me tell you Satan isn't going to hold back from Earthly wisdom or from his wisdom attacking the word of God the prophet said every time that God reveals something to you he said Satan will always come and try to show you all the defects within it and he says just as faith has an atmosphere wisdom has an atmosphere as well wisdom if we begin to listen to wisdom and looking at how can this be how's that going to happen it can bring about doubt and Gloom and we can get down is that right and wisdom itself it can also come and a and an atmosphere can actually uh cause us to raise up and do something or act out on something that is actually ahead of God's timing and his program Satan is always at work and it's so subtle how Pride will come in there I mean think here they were great meetings in heaven and here the the subtleness that came in in in in heaven where Lucifer got lifted up in his heart he was sitting right in the presence of God do you realize he was God's right-hand man Ezekiel called him the cherubim that coverthe was also he was so close to God like a a rightand man of Fellowship but it just goes to show that no matter how close that a person can be that Pride itself is always there to try to work right in I I tell you friends we've seen it throughout the ranks and times like that that it can take many times even a supporting Ministry that Pride can get in there and pride would begin to move and it'll break things apart and though it might look like well I'm not apart from the word but if our spirit is not with the spirit of the word it doesn't matter how right we are here with the letter it's the spirit that gives life Hallelujah the spirit doesn't travel by our knowledge the spirit Travels by the conviction of the Revelation in our heart and there's a confidence in this word and when that confidence is there and it's flowing in our life it's not us taking the message it's the spirit taking the message to the people of God that's right I don't care if a man can preach his way out of a paper bag he doesn't have to be a good preacher to be used of God come on Friends it has to be a vessel that surrendered that that get out of the way and bring Jesus Christ on the scene he's the one that's to be lifted up in this hour if God if it took some great preacher and and don't misunderstand me to me brother brandom is a masterful preacher and I I don't say that because of eloquence I I I I just I read when I read the prayers when I I'm listening in my heart I what it is is that here is a life that's so humble right God showed you and I he took an example he didn't even have a seventh grade education and God showed you and I it doesn't take intellects because God doesn't need intellects it's just a surrendered vessel that knows they're nothing and that's where Lucifer he he got lifted up and himself and pride come in and you know every time you read through the scriptures from Isaiah 14 which I referred to then you can go into e Ezekiel and you find that there it was the prince of Tyrus that same Spirit got upon him and he be got lifted up in his heart he began to you know look at everything and remember the prophet of God Ezekiel I identified that spirit that was working in the kings of Tyrus and he identified it not as a present happening but he identified it clear back when the when the volcanics of this Earth were belching forth and he talked about the beauty that was within Lucifer and he said oh you were beautiful until the day that iniquity was found in thine heart he had it you know you say well how could it be beautiful because he was created by God right when God create are you hearing me now when God creates by his word it's a beauty that has some substance to it Satan wants to try to smear these different things as though that this is beauty we don't want to be Satan's model we do not want to be he his his one that parades his his stles around and what he we don't want to be that we want to take up on the beauty which is of a real character Lord hallelujah Hallelujah now the Bible says the fear which is the reverence the worship of the Lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the forward mouth do I hate I want to read you this prayer I it's just turn me around that just stay with me I'm trying to make sure my eyes can see it brother brand said kind heavenly father I I just want you to listen to this we approach thee in the name of thy beloved Child Jesus to thank thee for the blessings that thou Hast given to us we unworthy people and thou has redeemed us all together by Grace by election of God thou has called us into this blessed hope that we have tonight in Christ Jesus and we thank thee for it and now as we're gathered here tonight in this lovely big city we pray that you'll come down into our midst there's no building on earth worthy for you to step into there's no people worthy for you to speak to but thou has not considered that Hallelujah aren't you glad for that amen hallelujah notice he says you've come uh to the poorest to the low to the ignorant to the outcast and we thank thee for we're so glad that you're a God like that what could we do if you were hoty and indifferent right but thou are not that kind of a father you're sweet and loving forgiving and that just makes us love you that much more amen now father now father you don't beat us as the cruelty of a serpent but thou loves us as the love of a father Can Only Love forgive us Lord we are all guilty of sin and indifference towards thee and let the blood blood thy blood atone for us tonight and he goes on to say in the next few words Lord circumcise the lips and may Jesus Christ be exalted not only our lips and our hearts but may he be exalted before this audience tonight amen just say it like this how God chooses brother Brandman says it like this to meet in the Realms of men he said sometimes God would meet in great company of men sometimes God would meet there's a scripture were 500 that were there not all of them went on into the upper room but 500 500 of them there was a meeting that was there but then we know that after that brother Brown would say and yet here's times where God will meet with just one he met with the woman at the well I I mean to tell you the truth God you know God when you get to looking at it right here this morning and I think it'd be something we can just apply to our hearts we we we can be sitting here with a number of people but I believe that God comes to have a meeting with every one of us in a personal way I believe God comes to speak to us in a very personal way and and we're not worthy of it I'm not worthy of it it don't matter it doesn't matter what where you and I are at there's nothing that we have done that is worthy of his presence to come among us but there's one thing that that will always invite him is a heart that is humble before him and say Lord come and speak to me Lord Lord come and move upon my life Lord I need you you may be things you're praying about the decisions in your life and here you are you didn't leave them out in your car and you truly you didn't do that sometimes we can get them so on our minds that they can actually they can actually cause our minds to go here depending on how weighty the decisions can be but you know if you can just lay them before God I believe God I I know he will I've experienced it where he'll come and give you an answer it may not exactly be the answer that we're looking for it may not even be the answer all the way every step of the way but God knows how to bring us to where as it were the dials of our life become so tuned into a place the prophet would say it like this he said oh that we can become tuned down to his presence and to recognize that the angels of God are here as a matter of fact to recognize the theophanies of God and here we are he said if we can become tuned down I'm not tuned up tuned down in humility to his presence so Lord take the dials of my life Lord and let them be tuned right Lord to where it'll be timed into the frequency of the Supernatural and the inspiration of God can flow if there's any static of Pride Lord Lord let the static of Pride be put aside Lord show me Lord let the dials Lord I don't want my hands but I want your hands upon the dials of my life Lord I want a clear picture Hallelujah God knows exactly how to meet in our life and just to remind us it's all because of his love you know when when listen friends if we can just always keep this before us and and thinking about God's mercy and his goodness I I don't care how far that God has brought you don't ever forget that it's him that's done it this is one this is one of the Great this is one of the greatest uh if I could say it like this dynamite against pride is remembering that without him we're nothing Hallelujah but like brother Bram said he said oh the think like that quote I read he comes to the outcast he comes to the lowly he comes to to those who don't deserve it and we never one deserved it brother B said I think of little Rosella Griffith setting up there he said in the balcony an alcoholic he said nobody wanted anything to do with her he said but God cared so much he went right there to her heart and discerned that heart he let her heart out of the condition she was in she was buried in shame it looked like there was no way out but God was not hoty and indifferent he went right to her need he led her in Deliverance she became a testimony of God's delivering Grace I'll tell you what I think of that my heart just oh I tell you I begin to reflect on that last night and I said God if it wasn't for your mercy Lord where would I be Lord if it wasn't for your mercy Lord the direction I was headed but Mercy stepped in I didn't turn my heart he turned my heart I'm not here because of what I did it's here because his grace overr my will my will even looked at it through a natural way and say I can't do it but his will it overrun and said I'm your wayall I'm your way so always remember it's because of his love this is why God would tell him there in Deuteronomy thou are a holy people unto the Lord thy God God don't have no problems reminding his people who they are you're a set aside people unto the Lord not to your own thoughts not to your own thinking you have been purchased by me I redeemed you amen the Lord thy God ha chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the Earth the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people you were the fewest of all people but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto his fathers ha the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondman from the hand of pharaoh king of Egypt God kept his promise his love that's been bestowed upon us is him coming in this age and not only revealing his word but vindicating it with his presence and touching our life that's the love of almighty God and he's shown his love to you and I let me tell you when he descended in Revelations 10 the mighty Angel he had a rainbow round about his head his whole coming is his mind was on his com his Covenant is his word his word is his thoughts his thoughts is his heart he has never departed from it Mission has never been aborted no matter how bad it ever looked God's never had a button he don't have a button that says abort Mission he doesn't have that and I'm talking about not only on his plan but you're part of his plan you might have looked for a button many times but there is no button in God's word of abort Mission but it's God bringing us into a place to realize I have begun this good work in you and I will perform it until the day of Jesus [Applause] Christ right up to the nanc before the rapture I'll be working I'm glad about that aren't you I'm glad that God didn't send a message and say you know what I'll just sit by the clock and wait for the time to get there it's Friday you know we can just chill out drink sweet tea there's only three more hours left we'll just we'll just wait but God said no I've sent a word because the word itself if the word don't take flesh then the word itself has not actually produced what the word has announced that he's come to do because the word God delivered his message and now the same spirit of God coming back around and is taking that message and that message is being sown into the hearts and lives of the people and it's the same spirit of God that comes right behind that word and vindicates it where the Dynamics come upon the mechanics to make that word live amen sometimes we want Dynamics just like this but you know it all has to start with the mechanics if you don't have no mechanics what are the Dynamics going to produce right I mean it can produce excitement but we're not that's not the goal God's not coming to Rapture excitement he's come to Rapture the word because when it is an excitement brought by the word it's a joy that rises on the inside to know that I'm not here because of me I have not done this because of me but the grace of God has slipped down from that realm and it's dropped into my heart and of a way that I cannot see out God himself has an in my eyes to see and I see Victory I see Victory I see myself as a conqueror in Christ [Applause] Jesus thank you Lord this is why Paul you know Paul warned he he wasn't just warning the early uh church but he was warning all the way down through that don't get in your your mind that well you know God blinded Israel and look at us andul said don't don't boast no don't boast he said they they they they were blinded for our sakes that's right see God had a hidden Mystery God had a bride for Joseph God had a mystery that he was going to take a people for his name sake he hadn't forgot about Israel Hallelujah why we've been in this Feast he hadn't forgot about Israel amen it's ready at that moment to turn we are it is ripe for the Rapture and the anointing of the Holy Spirit that's upon the bride to fall upon those two witnesses that will stand there with the characteristic of Moses and Elijah's Ministry and call the people back to the true atonement so Paul said don't boast don't boast don't boast he said it in these words you said be not High minded but fear be reverence the grace of God has come by our way and without him we're nothing amen this is why the why the prophet said not him that runneth or him that willth but God shows Mercy it's God does it you can't brag on it at all there's not a thing that you did God by Grace saved you not you yourself if you got something to brag about but but you haven't got nothing to brag all Praises goes to him it's him this is why we are his achievement see it's not it's not us it's not us trying to achieve something say you know Satan would like for us to look at that well I have to become this or I have to do this and and what he's trying to do is draw us out in our own human efforts that's right now listen human efforts and yielding are not the same thing right yielding is where you release your strength to him you let him take your hand and guide it into the sleeve here and then guide it into the sleeve there is that right right now I want you to think within this we we're not we're not our own achievement we're not the achievement of some church we are the achievement of Jesus Christ let me tell you the message that God has delivered to you in this hour was the achievement of whereare that God was not able this is the prophet's word in the message token thew in the Earthly Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ where the Prophet said he was not able to break through there meaning that and they everywhere he was going they were disbelieving and even in his hometown running him out didn't want nothing to do with him and then the religious called him be elub and everything else remember the Bible said many mighty works could he not do I want you to think about it the all that the Living God that that created the very world the Earth that they were standing on and it shows that because of their unbelief he could not do many mighty Works he could have did it but if he would have went ahead and did it that would have been Pride are you with me it would have been showing what he could do he was tested we know that the Temptations is that right but the prophet tells us in the message token he said but notice he said he's finally been able to break through and he said think about the countless Miracles that he's done he said notice I didn't say I did them he did them brother Randon would say in false anointed ones at the end time he would say it is not what I knew it's what I surrendered myself to I'm not the one who performs these Miracles I just happen to be present when he does it and God moved through that vessel that friends listen that was not just a quote for you and I to to to just look at that was a statement that God was making to the Bride of Jesus Christ he's letting you and I know all you have to do is be standing present standing present where standing on the side of the Lord and when you stand on the side of the Lord then the Supernatural will follow the word Miracles follow when the word goes first amen right the wine never came before the water was in the vessels the water in the vessels led to the wine amen the woman of zarapa first went and made ready for cakes then the miracle followed right is that right that's why when the scripture said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and then the miracle will come we his achievement this is why when Paul would write now you notice when Paul would write this by the spirit of God if none of these things had anything to do among a body of Believers among a church then he never would have wrote it he would have just they just put separate books in the Bible but it's showing how that spirits will try to work to bring hindrances sure and Satan is so subtle brother BR says I say through or no Paul said I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think that's true is that right now that don't mean that you walking around and running yourself in the ground cuz that's not humility either that's right are you hearing me a lot of times what that is that's excuses but humility is recognizing the God who is speaking and that it's him that comes to fulfill his word through our lives and US surrendering through him that's God's program it's not the instrumentality of man God has not entrusted it to his church do this perform this but he has entrusted his word to himself and he is the word this is why that they were required to go wait for the Holy Ghost to be endued with power from on high not just to live a good life one or two or three days out of the week but to be ued with quickening power that will make that word live and make it come to life and will produce the same life that was within the Corporal body of Jesus Christ amen and so it's God working through his Machinery hallelujah it's God working that's good you see when God works through his channels it's God that's shown right but when when man cuz we know man can can get under the anointing can preach and all those other things but it's always got to come back to the display of the word of God I want you to think how when brother Brown would say go on to say this let me finish reading the scripture but to think soberly how incredible to think soberly that it's it's God it's not me come on Amen to think soberly we're in a we're in an age friend where you can look you you could become drunk without going to a bar because I'm not talking about natural thing you can become intoxicated with the cares of life you can become intoxicated with politics you can become intoxic at with sports on come on whatever you're drinking is how you starting feeding or acting be careful what bottle you're hitting on you want to make sure you're hitting on the new wine that brings a stimulation a revelation that is putting you under the inspiration of the word of God in this hour that this world is not my hope I'm just passing through to think soberly and takes courageous yeah according as god notice who has done this God has dealt to every man a Measure of Faith this why brother brand would say over and over through the message and I just marvel as I just go through and comb some of these things again when brother brand was said you know he was asked countless times and brother R refer this all the way up in into 65 there where he says where people he said here they've been filled with the Holy Ghost and he said there were some of them begin to come to me and say now that we've been filled with the spirit of God shall we begin to seek for spiritual gifts it's natural I mean when listen let me just say it to you like this when God does something for your life it's it's a natural thing to want to serve him I don't know I you know you don't know what capacity that God's going to have you to serve in but the think about you say well is that scripture yes it was when Paul met him on the road to Damascus what did he say what would you have me do that's the same thing when it came to Moses it was God revealing to Moses the commission so let me just tell you the revelation of this word does not come to produce sedentary complacent people come on brother if the holy spirit that was within the living creatures would put them in motion with the word if that same spirit is in us then our steps of our life are always forward and in the work of God for what God has called us to do it will highlight Jesus Christ homies with the right attitude but B said you know and and just think about the subtleness now think about subtleness how the attitude can slip in there brother BR says like a man you know always wants to do something he said that's usually that's the people God's not going to use right he said but it's usually those and brother R will say it it's those who wanting to get away from it even when God would make knowing something to do and they'll say me no way not me I'm not the one for that Lord no that's exact that's the exact words of the prophet he said like you take one guy that'll say Lord give me the power to move mountains I tell you I'll do something for you Lord if you let me move mountains brother Bram said no he wouldn't because he can't even move himself to the right attitude see the word discerns motives and objectives the word is alive amen it is amen are you with me true the word is alive and this is why brother Bram could say the M he said many of the times he said every one of us have a Ministry now he breaks it up into the whole part of the body dealing with when we come into the land with Housewives and everything else it's God working through every one of those channels and he said many of the times God has to drive us into the correct Ministry because you see even in some of those points and some of those things we always have to be careful God knows what we're able to handle amen and and let me just tell you this right here God has not God gifts and callings are without repentance you know the Rich Young Ruler he had the gift to be an evangelist brother Brown picks that up he says where he was and he lifted up his eyes in hell and he said go tell send somebody from here not where I'm at but over there in Abraham's bosom where the promise send somebody back and tell them don't come the way I've come right brother B said that was the call of evangelist if he would have just yielded his life to the Lord amen he could have used his influence hallelu God couldn't work through that upon the lives of others but he thought too much of his own possessions is so good true there's a lot we could deal with on that there let me tell you something when it all comes down to the Rapture listen friends if you're not in tune with God right now the Rapture you're not going to know when that's taking place if you're not in tune with him right now if there's anything that's that's distorting the Airways right now in your life you need to get that out of the way because the Rapture morning God's not going to clear out the airwaves that's what the washing of Water by the word is to do right now is to get all the channels cleared out and the token to be applied is because there's an urgency in this hour the geese start getting together this time of the year the birds start getting together they're getting ready for a great migration there's nobody has to tell them that they are born there's an instinct and the prophet says science calls it Instinct but I call it God hallelujah hallelujah it's a pulsation that moves in your heart that says clear this out lay that aside get this right get ready why oh my thank you Lord because the Rapture is upon us and I'm going to tell you friends this right here Rapture morning is not going to be something when we're going to get an alert on our phone the world will go on like they always have churches will go on have an altar cause and think they're getting saved you said the scripture on that the the Bible said whosoever is filthy let him be filthy still there'll be no salvation during the time of the tribulation let me tell you a little Glimpse as we saw I'm just going on this as he's taking me down there what happened in Western uh North Carolina and uh Eastern Tennessee down there where sister Gloria is from and in that area I'll tell you what that that how things that my goodness the mess that it it is right now that's only a little scratch yeah compared to what's going to be in the tribulation you think when Co and everything else come against us and look I'm not in here to talk politics and everything else let me just set it straight it's real Co won no fake thing it was a real [Applause] disease say am man if you want to or not that's a truth I'm not talking about what people did with it politicized and everything else but here's is what I'm trying to say those things like that are a minor thing oh yeah right but what's coming upon this earth right you might want to be careful cuz you might have a key to this church and you might be the only one sitting in here I'm not telling you that to scare you I'm saying in this hour hey it's an hour to get checking up cuz on Rapture morning brother nothing matters and you know what you need to live that kind of a life now that's what the Holy Ghost produces that's what real Joy produces it produces a life that is Carefree in the Holy Ghost and is enjoying itself in God I don't want to be bound down with everything else in the world I've been there are you hearing me I've been there I've been there where the devil wants to bind me down in my mind with the fences and everything else I don't want to live [Applause] there but Pride I'm trying to get somewhere here pride is the way to destruction yes it is all the way right to through destruction and you know what the devil has so much pride he wouldn't even get right right that is so good when the fall took place in Eden here the presence of God come down they had so much pride that they didn't come out running and say Lord forgive me I've fallen I've fallen but because God is Not hoty and indifferent he could have sat there and said now look what I told you look what you have done you have been terrible look what's no but he came down running through the garden crying out Adam where are you Adam where are you let me tell you brother and sister he came the same way down in our lives he came down in your life in my life your life might be a Garden of Eden now but it wasn't a Garden of Eden our lives were rubbish Heats but when he came in he's the sign of prosperity when he comes in our life he's the one that as it says in the time of the Millennium will cause the cactus in the desert to Blossom as a rose he's the one coming into our life where the channels have been open and the rivers of God are flowing it is him that is produced in our lives another Garden of Eden where he is habitating in our life as husband and wife together in a blessed Union am he's proving his victory right in the midst of Satan's Eden pride is the way to destruction yes it is the Bible said a hotty Spirit goes before a fall right that's a spirit listen friends that's a spirit that's upon this age Revelations 3 because thou sayest my I'm rich increase with Goods I don't got to need of nothing you know I I I don't need that I I I know I love God but I'm asking you do you love God enough to where you'll stand loyal to his word amen amen God's Des does want charter members God doesn't want your name on a book he he already put your name on the book before the foundation of the world Amen and that's the book that matters and if your name has been put there it is the character that matches the word when it's revealed in this hour it's like a magnet coming to a magnet it's magnetized to his presence amen but that's the spirit I I don't need of nothing I I don't I don't have to cater to that I don't have to bow down to that let me tell you something friends you know the prophet of God takes us over there and he says it like this in the Sixth Seal he speaks of how that in the Book of Revelations remember the Bible said they will seek for a place to hide because you know why they have rejected the hiding place that's been provided which is Christ Jesus the word and the Bible said they will call for the rocks and mountains to fall upon them the prophet said it like this in the message the second seal he said what it is they've sat in meetings just like this and they've turned down the presence of God dealing with their lives I say oh God let us be sensitive clear out every bit of Pride I I would rather listen friends it it doesn't it pride is not worth hanging on to Pride is not worth missing the Rapture for oh God give us Grace to let it be dug out of our Lives Amen Let me just try trying to narrow this down cuz there's no way that I'm going to get finished here I want you to think of this in the message humble thyself if you haven't listened that message in a while I don't know how many times I've listened that message over the years was like 32 minutes or something like that it's very very short message but that message message right there to me is such a it's such a key to the operation of the word of God in our lives you take that perfect strength perfect weakness so many of those things like that but let's just let's just try to hone in on this part of it here brother Bram says I've always found out that the man that humbles himself is the man that God exalts when you take a person with his chest out and knows everything and you can't tell him nothing and he is arrogant brother BR said that's a person that never gets anywhere so it's kind of like being on a treadmill you say you're going to go for a run you know I've got a treadmill in my basement I I now I used it I used it Faithfully for many years you can probably tell right now I can see you ain't using it now but I this is just me this ain't UNS spiritual so don't oh man I I just don't like staring at basement walls I try to listen to a mess message and things like that but I just don't like staring at basement walls gray walls and that's just me it ain't nothing spiritual it's just me I I I like getting out and walking like I mean if I even I got a bundle up and put hats on my head and and mittens on my hands I I I I like getting out into light but to think about it when when arrogancy is in our life it's like running on a treadmill you could have said man I ran miles today and didn't go nowhere right that's what arrogant now watch what it does it produces even a false sense of achievement that's a subtleness of Pride like I'm really getting somewhere and I'm really get and sometimes we can we can look at that maybe it can be even through what we are able to understand how our knowledge of the word will pick up and because listen friends let's just be honest we here we are by the grace of God not because of what we've merited but the message that God has delivered to you and I and God in his grace not only delivered it but opened our eyes to what we see is Jesus Christ I I mean God has delivered a perfect interpretation his mind his thoughts have been declared you think that it's not going to need the Divine accompaniment of his grace to help us remain humble come on oh brother Samuel I I've got all the strength I need to stay humble I it's it's wonderful we want to Humble ourselves by the love of God but God knows our abilities and he knows how to keep us humble he's more determined to fulfill his word through you and I he's more determined than our determination to remain humble I thank God for that yeah man man man man man why don't we just go for lunch and come back you get in trouble but I don't want to get I just this just so many things just Bubble Up in your heart for things you know to help us and to minister to us and that's how I that's how I look at it friends to me I look at it like brother Aaron if you was over at the house and you were getting ready to leave us wait wait wait wait we didn't even get the Apple pile the apple crisp sit down man hey you you can leaving out the best part we better get all food W Happ me but I want you to notice this this subtleness just how how quickly that that came in there where Nebuchadnezzar was a man that he was he was an instrument being used by God he was an instrument that God used to bring judgment right but Nebuchadnezzar the reason you we that Babylon was the the a Mighty Kingdom as it was was because God had permitted it to rise up to chasen Israel that's why the prophet of God said he said all of this talk about communism he said that is not the focus no he said it is Roman Catholicism right if I had to read all the quotes that he said that he called preachers out for preaching it right he said what that is it's a tool that God is using right he would go on to tell us he said by the way voice of God in this last days that message he said by the way he said Russia he said really less than 1% is communism right but it's that percent that is the ruling percent right but he's what did he say watch that purple curtain which is what Rome right Catholicism is that right now remember she had many daughters now what are her daughters you had them where they took out and you know Luther they Luther inspiration struck Luther's heart nailed those 95 pieces there to the door under the inspiration of God under the man anointing and Luther he he he stood out on the word that was revealed in that hour the just shall live by faith that Revelation was power over the devil in that hour it was power over that black horse rider is that right and now it was not Luther that started the Lutheran organization that was fallen angels that got in there after that word and they denominated you know what denominate is it's where you put a wall around things but God's word is meant to go forward you don't just stop it's like out here in this field out here in this field they just harvested the beans over there those beans when they started out were little sprigs like this that came out right you don't get a combine out there when them sprigs are up like that they're not ready but the life that was within that be that went in the ground that life will come back to itself again Luther was only the beginning stage amen right then Here Comes Wesley anointed by the the spirit of God and it begins to proclaim the sanctifying power of the blood of Jesus Christ there were Lutheran than those that take upon that name no you know what they weren't called Lutheran before they were called Christians right is that right now I know some man of lame labeled them that because they were following Luther's message but what they were following is they were following Christ that had revealed himself through Luther cuz Paul said follow me as I follow Christ that's why you got to be careful who you're following no who they're following are you hearing me friends somebody leads you right in a ditch can lead you right into the tribulation can lead you right into hell but you want to be sure you're following Christ and he is the word Wesley arose by that inspiration he took out and then preached a sanctification message then as that word went on then here came a word that that was dropped in the hour of the restoration of the gifts it wasn't perfect but the restoration of the gift is a supernatural back among the people of God again the rumor became stronger that he's alive the rumor had started through Luther a rumor he's alive then he gotten stronger through Wesley and then here came the rumor even stronger through the supernatural making itself known there at the at the Ze Street with the gifts amen but God didn't stop there hallu because that's still not back to the original seed no no are you hearing me now but the Original Seed is to reproduce Christ himself again in the lives of his people are there gifts absolutely it's a part of it you can't cut away what he was back there it's him becoming brighter and brighter and brighter and more clear under that perfect day he's still the same yesterday today and forever we are justified by faith we are Sanctified by the blood we are baptized with the Holy Ghost and we are positioned as Sons and Daughters of God in Jesus Christ a word to bring us from Glory unto glory amen think about think think about I want you to think about this think about where we're at right now I think about where even just a few years ago the understanding and the things that I see now I didn't see it in that depth right a few years ago and I'm not just talking about a depth of Doctrine and how things are coming together I'm talking about me I'm seeing me more clearly that's what I'm talking about and as I'm seeing me more clearly how are you seeing you more clearly because I'm looking at him he he's becoming in plain view and you know and you know the view that he's becoming is not an external view but it's Christ himself unveiling himself in you in me he's un faking he's taking the veil off Hallelujah and it's you eyes that are beginning to see things that as he deals with our hearts in love well sure Lord I'll lay that aside prise God sure Lord I'll lay that aside remember he's not hotty and indifferent when he comes he doesn't come as the like like a cruel father and no it's his love because he wants surrender right because it's not just see legalism is where it's taking and you do this and you do that it's not surrender legalism is not surrender you can have all the p's and q's out outside right here and still not have the surrender that God's looking for but the love of God comes to bring surrender in our hearts that's good well I said I was going to stop here and then it's your fault but here was Nebuchadnezzar when the Bible says that in his heart his heart got lifted up yes it did yes it did that's right and his mind hardened in Pride now you would say you know how could that have how could that have happened true because he he got to looking at all the achievements he got to looking at everything can I bring it down to you and I look at all the understanding that God's given us look at the message that God has given us look how that this word has come and overthrow spirits that have had lives bound look look how it's done in such a boy I tell see the subtleness of pride is such a fine line between self- Glory glorification and glorifying God it's such a fine line within that and I say Lord help me to always remember help me to always remember that it's you lord it's you don't you stand in amazement of how that he works through your life that's so good I stand In Awe I I I'm just I'm just saying this you've heard me say it many times but many times what I stand in awe of and I Rejoice is not that the outcome or the situation or anything has been you know resolved or I've got I see the final answer but it's just where he would drop in my heart to know Samuel I've got this there you go there you go and that right there get it it gives such such peace and such joy in my heart to know he's got that that itself brings a worship and you say how's this going to happen like Abraham I don't know what's going to happen on the mountain when we get up there Glory but I know this we're going to go worship God's asked something very great of you Abraham but I'm going to go worship Him Glory and you know what was the most greatest worship that Abraham did was not altogether of the altar being being built and the and the wood being laid in order that itself was only showing what was already in his heart yes all right and God allowed his heart to be displayed praise God you have been in God's heart all along but he didn't keep you in his heart cuz he believes his own word faith without works is dead but God has revealed himself as part and portions of himself and let me tell you something it's his heart that is coming and is going to lift Us in rap [Applause] hallah hallelujah it's God coming back for himself so God is accountable to his own word Faith Works expresses faith God working out in your life my life through all your failures through all my failures and God himself working throughout our life is the expression of his faith that he has in his own word the prophet said it's not you believing it's God in you believing his own word through you thank you Lord I feel like boy the dirt's flying now now man start flying when you start looking at that man make room more I want more of the grace of God I want more than man life feel like singing that song I don't think I could sing it I want to dig a little deeper in God's love I want to dig a Little Deeper it's an old one but it's a good one BR but Nebuchadnezzar he got he got hottie he got hottie and God turned him out like an ox to eat grass yeah his fingernails grew out and long he like an eagle yeah you could look at that and say what are you doing you're not supposed to be feeding on that kind of stuff what are you doing why why are you letting yourself go like that but God permitted it because he hardened that's right his heart was lifted in Pride the Bible said his heart was lifted up and his mind was hardened in Pride that's that's that's beautiful friends there's a time to be stubborn some of you are thinking now you're talking my game now but there's a time not to be stubborn when P when Peter says be steadfast in the faith that means be stubborn in the faith so there is such a thing as a good stubbornness but there's also such a thing as a bad stubbornness we want that stubbornness that'll stand in the faith of God's word and say I don't know how but I know what God has said he will perform it amen he don't need me to help him he just needs me to yield to him just say it like this don't don't let any Pride linger around our lives Pride leads to destruction leads to many things but oh the grace of God has called us to live and to walk higher say God tune every dial of my life if it's not you know we we always want to be right right in tune that's why we come and we're hearing the word of God because the word comes to bring checkups it comes to make sure that everything's lined up right I I think you know in my you know you have it on your electronic devices and things like that I guess but I get all these things that notify that hey you need to update this right here tonight cuz this fixes bugs and this fixes security and all this right here it'll be on my from my laptop to my iPad to my iPhone and everything else you need to update cuz there's bugs bugs and everything else security encryption everything else you know what it is it's things that's out there that if I don't stay updated those things can affect me one of these things and then I wonder why is this going haywire why isin't this working right why isin't this doing this but you know what not only do them bugs those updates go with those I'm not losing nobody am I not only do those updates stay with brother Shan we'll have we'll talk later those those updates on there it it it protects against bugs and all that malware and things like that but you know what if there's times if I didn't

order for you to see this document you got to you got to get to the update which will also install the updated version of that app I didn't lose nobody did I you see this is why staying in sync with the Holy Spirit it helps us stay right in step with what God is wanting to do and sometimes when there's things that's not exactly working just right it's always good to check Lord I want a fresh update I I I need to be ly up cuz sometimes within the world and other things like that we can get knocked out of sink and let me tell you if you've not received the download of the Holy Spirit just say God clear the cash of my heart clear clear everything Lord I don't want nothing in my heart I don't want the operating system of Samuel Browning I want the operating system of God Amen I want to be a part of his Network I want to be baptized into the network that I can receive visions and texts and FaceTime and and I can hear from God I want to be a part of that Lord amen and you know what that's casting aside Pride to say Lord I need thee I need you Lord don't you love him this morning amen God bless you musicians come Paul are you going to lead amen amen hallelujah God is so good isn't he the Lord is so good so mindful so merciful I'm so thankful amen I wonder as they come and just prepare to to play something let's just let's just talk to the Lord here just a few moments and I'm sure that every one of us perhaps maybe you'd like to be remembered in prayer God knows behind your your hand he knows behind my hands Lord I Want to Be Remembered in prayer he knows what you have need of he knows and you know what he's not ashamed he's not ashamed to you he's not ashamed to me he'll come right down amen Heavenly Father Lord we are standing Lord as your children so thankful for your great Mercy Lord Upon Our Lives Lord we we we cannot take any Glory we wouldn't want to but we can't Lord we're your workmanship the father I pray that God for every one of us as we're were gathered here Lord we are fully aware of this subtleness of how Pride can come in [Music] Lord and father we're looking to you we're looking to you Lord help us God even as your Holy Spirit just evaluates and just goes through our heart Lord that's that's even one Victory right there over Pride Lord is that we would be willing to stand under the washing of Water by the word and say Lord comb through every area of my life if you find Lord any high-mindedness if there's in anything Lord maybe even in something that because like you said today that pride comes so subtly and I I need more than my finite mind Lord I need the great scan of your mind Lord Just Lead Me Lord even as we lord even would walk out of this place today Father this is our our commitment from our hearts is just continue to speak to us and guide us give us the discernment of the Holy Spirit Lord that father that we would be able to discern the enemy that would want to come and make the army of the Living God formal powerless lukewarm may we not only discern it Lord but withstand it now Lord individually as soldiers of the Living God Amen we are called to take the word amen and to apply it to our own Liv lives and to stand shoulder toosh shoulder with the word of God having Lord the blood upon our hearts Lord father carrying the word not on a new cart but over our hearts now Lord this is the Lord in this this hour this is a this is an overcoming of that hindrance of pride is to say Lord if there there's anything in my life if there's anything that's wrong anything that's out of line Lord I I I don't want an arrogant Spirit Lord I I want you to correct me because I I want to please you Lord I I want your word because you come Lord to make your word known to us that that we in turn might take it nourish it cherish it and discipline our lives to that word Lord I I want you to be on display Lord wherever I go wherever we go we we do not want it to be known that Samuel Browning passed this way or Lord they can put their name in that but we we want it to be known that first and foremost this was a Christian that passed this way here's one who loved God above everything even willing to come to me when maybe he said something or she said something out of line and I didn't hear them say it but in their heart it wasn't said in the right spirit and they would turn and say forgive me I I didn't say that in the right way there is a Christian Lord God this is an age of such imagery an age where pictures and everything else would be set before us Lord God I can't think of anything greater when you would send Lord God this great message in this hour how we thank you Lord for every book for every tape Lord but dear God you're not coming back to to Rapture books and tapes it's where Lord God that that word has become flesh in our lives where the very character of Jesus Christ has been reproduced in our lives that is what your Prophet called the welcoming spirit that would welcome you back to this earth Lord God to take us home not our spirit but your spirit Lord help me help us Lord God as our hands Lord have been lifted up Lord you know the needs behind every hand Lord hearts and lives Lord that father might be in need Lord of full surrender might be in need of the Holy Ghost but lord they're not ashamed Lord God in your presence Lord just say father I need you

hands Lord the desire Lord I want to dig deeper Lord I want to dig deeper I want more of this Earth more of Samuel laid aside Lord as they would put their own name in it to dig out more of ourselves Lord laying it aside Lord that the spirit of God might flow Lord such in a greater way through our lives help us Lord [Music] sometimes Lord the very trials and tests that we and I ask you to forgive us sometimes are things Lord that as you permit to come our way that sometimes Lord that we complain when it first hits and and we get to looking at it sometimes the longevity of the time but Lord God I'm thankful that father Your Grace is present to override in our lives but sometimes lord it's through those very things that you work to help us to remember it's not your strength Samuel it's my strength amen and in your time of weakness my strength is complete oh God help us Lord Oh Lord we don't want to make excuses for our weaknesses we want to surrender them friends I don't know what your weakness might be this morning but would you just want to in this presence Lord I Surrender my weaknesses because it's those things of the weaknesses that you will take it and pour yourself into those areas and use yourself to accomplish the job granted Lord God I pray Lord take every heart and every life Lord according to the needs Lord behind the hands and the requests Lord from their heart would
