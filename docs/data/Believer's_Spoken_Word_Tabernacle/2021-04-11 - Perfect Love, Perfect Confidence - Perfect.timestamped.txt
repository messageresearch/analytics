[43:31] amen amen first john chapter 4
[43:35] verse 17 and we're just going to read
[43:37] just a few verses of scripture and then
[43:40] i'm just going to let you have your
[43:41] seats
[43:43] and i just want to encourage you her
[43:45] brother carlos give them
[43:47] a testimony any time and i know you know
[43:50] this
[43:51] as as children of god but any time
[43:53] there's testimony and there's
[43:55] and we see victory that's not the time
[43:58] to start up
[43:59] to pull back from praying that's a time
[44:01] to move forward even more
[44:03] in prayer and the enemies on the run
[44:05] keep him on the run so you just
[44:08] even if you say well i pray in the
[44:10] morning but he asked sister irma
[44:12] different needs will come to your heart
[44:14] throughout just
[44:14] right there even while you're walking
[44:16] you're driving maybe you're carrying a
[44:17] tool up just
[44:18] lord jesus just touch my sister lord
[44:21] just
[44:21] because we're certainly a body and we
[44:24] are thankful
[44:25] to the lord for his mercy i want to just
[44:27] read these three verses scripture
[44:30] herein is our love
[44:33] made perfect or brought to a completion
[44:37] that we may have a boldness which is a
[44:40] free and fearless confidence a cheerful
[44:44] courage
[44:45] and assurance that we may have boldness
[44:48] in the day of judgment because
[44:52] as he is so are
[44:55] we in this world we're a reflection here
[45:00] of what he is there he ascended on high
[45:04] seated at the right hand in authority
[45:06] and power
[45:07] that reflection has come back into our
[45:09] life wherein
[45:11] now is manifested of power and authority
[45:14] over sin this transformation
[45:18] there is no fear in love but
[45:21] perfect love casteth out
[45:24] fear because fear
[45:27] hath torment he that feareth
[45:31] is not made perfect in love
[45:35] we love him because
[45:38] he first loved us
[45:41] may god bless you bless the reading of
[45:43] the word as you're being seated
[45:45] i'd like to speak to you this morning
[45:47] for a few moments on perfect love
[45:50] perfect confidence brother branham as he
[45:53] would
[45:54] look around and he would you know take
[45:57] experiences that he himself
[45:59] had from wildlife and other other things
[46:02] he would
[46:03] he would notice and howl that seeing god
[46:06] within nature and he would
[46:08] he would be able to direct that god
[46:10] would would help him to see it what some
[46:12] things that was taking place even in the
[46:14] body
[46:15] of jesus christ and among the people of
[46:18] god
[46:19] and he would speak of the greatest
[46:20] hindrance that was actually in the
[46:22] church
[46:23] and he said that's fear everywhere is
[46:26] fear
[46:27] but perfect love casts out fear
[46:31] he says the reason you're fearful is
[46:34] because the right
[46:35] temperance of love has never entered yet
[46:39] but when there's real love all fear
[46:41] passes away
[46:42] when you really love the lord
[46:47] you see he says love love has no fear
[46:49] love
[46:50] cast out fear and what makes fear
[46:54] is a lack of confidence if you lack
[46:57] confidence
[46:58] it'll make you fear but if you love
[47:01] it'll cast away that fear now i want you
[47:04] just to
[47:04] stay with me here just a little bit as
[47:06] i'm laying this in
[47:08] is not saying that fear won't come
[47:11] but perfect love will cast it away
[47:16] so we want to just deal with that a
[47:18] little bit he says it but if you love it
[47:19] cast away that fear
[47:21] and that's the way that god wants his
[47:24] church
[47:24] not so many as charter members
[47:28] he wants members that's loyal
[47:32] loves believes and has confidence
[47:36] in him and you know when you
[47:40] look at it he would always take this
[47:41] brother man would take this approach and
[47:43] i think it's a very
[47:45] fitting example that we look at and he
[47:48] would deal with how he says
[47:49] what if it when i was going overseas
[47:53] that he said i got my wife and i begin
[47:56] to just
[47:57] lay down certain rules and say and i go
[48:00] away
[48:00] you better not be flirting with any
[48:02] other man you better not be you know
[48:05] having any other man around the house
[48:07] you better not be doing this and then
[48:09] she would come around with the same
[48:11] response and say well let me just give
[48:13] you a few words of advice
[48:14] you better not be around any other woman
[48:16] when you're overseas you
[48:18] better not be eating dinner with them
[48:19] you bet that in itself would not be love
[48:23] that's fear that's a lack of
[48:26] confidence are you with me brother brown
[48:30] brings it down he says i'm afraid that
[48:31] that's what's come into the church
[48:34] is that of a ritualistic legalism
[48:38] because you see the reality when we we
[48:41] get to dealing with it
[48:43] you know when the right love is we've
[48:45] looked at this for a little bit when
[48:47] when the right temperance of love comes
[48:49] in
[48:50] and that could be between husband and
[48:52] wife
[48:54] and and brother brown will use this
[48:55] example in perfect faith music standing
[48:57] in the gap in other places
[48:59] to where that he says even if my wife if
[49:02] i
[49:02] knew that i would if i did something
[49:05] wrong
[49:05] she would forgive me he said i love her
[49:09] and i wouldn't want to do anything
[49:12] to hurt her that's how
[49:16] that's they're in a filial love but when
[49:19] the
[49:19] that in the agape love when the love of
[49:22] god has come into our heart
[49:24] we're not serving god out of fear
[49:28] i want you to keep this in mind the fear
[49:30] of the lord
[49:31] is clean it's not a slavish fear
[49:36] you're not living this life because if i
[49:39] do that
[49:40] god's going to get on my case he's going
[49:42] to punish me
[49:44] that right temperance of love is still
[49:46] not there yet because
[49:48] though when the love of god has come
[49:50] into your life
[49:52] you can do whatever you want but if his
[49:54] love is there
[49:55] you don't want to do wrong
[49:58] you want to please him
[50:02] he's he's the desire that's that's there
[50:05] of your life and this is why when we
[50:08] when we see this
[50:09] how that god would speak through paul
[50:11] because remember
[50:13] god gave israel the law but remember
[50:16] it's still even of all the sacrifices
[50:19] that they could offer
[50:21] of the blood but yet it can never deal
[50:24] with
[50:24] the conscience the soul the nature the
[50:27] remembrance of it was always there but
[50:29] god
[50:30] made a promise and when god makes a
[50:33] promise
[50:33] that's god committing himself
[50:36] by his word to his people
[50:40] there's there's no there's no other
[50:42] commitment that god has to you and i
[50:45] then as god would give us his word when
[50:48] god gives his word
[50:49] he's obligating himself
[50:52] and this is why when the scripture paul
[50:54] would pick it up in romans and he would
[50:56] write
[50:57] that not the hearers of the law are just
[50:59] before god
[51:01] but it's the doers of the law and he
[51:03] says for when the gentiles in verse 14
[51:06] which have not the law do by
[51:09] nature the things contained in the law
[51:12] these having not the law are a law
[51:16] unto themselves see god
[51:19] coming in and he he deals with the
[51:22] nature and he changes the nature so that
[51:26] the law and our nature are not contrary
[51:29] but now by the new birth that nature
[51:32] within us
[51:33] is god's own nature it's god's own life
[51:36] it's a son and daughter of god that's
[51:38] expressed it's not
[51:39] something different from the word it is
[51:42] the word
[51:43] now expressed in our life
[51:46] so it's by nature see the very writing
[51:49] of the word
[51:50] is there it's the nature of the word in
[51:52] our life
[51:53] as he says which show the work of the
[51:56] law
[51:56] written in their hearts and their
[51:59] conscience also bearing witness and
[52:02] their thoughts the meanwhile accusing or
[52:04] excusing one another
[52:05] there's things that you can speak of in
[52:08] your own life that maybe there's things
[52:10] that can take place
[52:11] around you and yet within you there's a
[52:14] reality that holds you and says
[52:15] i won't i'm not going that direction i
[52:18] don't know about that i'm not going that
[52:19] way it can be
[52:20] family or whoever it is there's a
[52:22] standard not
[52:23] outside of you it's a standard of the
[52:26] word
[52:27] inside of you that even when you don't
[52:30] understand things sometimes
[52:32] this is why you can stand as the prophet
[52:35] of god
[52:36] and he would stand there and he says now
[52:38] i'm going to turn off the tapes on the
[52:40] first seal
[52:41] he says i always wondered why i was
[52:44] against
[52:44] that organizational system he says now
[52:48] i know why he could see the innocency
[52:51] and how it would so
[52:53] progress and there's things brother and
[52:55] sister that you or i
[52:57] may not be able to put our finger on but
[52:59] there's just something about it there
[53:01] that says
[53:02] i'm not going to go that way i it may
[53:05] not be nothing wrong with it that way
[53:07] but i'm not going to go that way i want
[53:09] to just be pleasing to the lord amen
[53:16] first john 5 3 for this is the love of
[53:19] god
[53:20] that we keep his commandments i want you
[53:23] to understand
[53:24] this keeping of his commandments is not
[53:26] us walking around with them
[53:28] and reciting it's when a need arises
[53:31] it's even when his word as it goes forth
[53:34] there's a reference to that word there's
[53:36] an observing of that word
[53:37] when you've got a need in your life you
[53:39] keep his commandments i'm the lord that
[53:42] healeth all thine diseases
[53:46] and his commandments are not grievous
[53:48] they're not
[53:49] burdens and they're not like oh why do
[53:51] we have to do this and why do we have to
[53:53] no the love of god when the love of god
[53:55] has entered into our life
[53:56] it's not grievous to serve the lord
[54:00] it's not grievous when his word comes
[54:02] forth and his word
[54:04] is dealing it's not grievous because
[54:06] it's who we are
[54:08] it's part of our nature this is why
[54:11] second corinthians 5 14 for the love of
[54:14] god
[54:15] constrainteth us as i i i it's
[54:19] a love slave it constraineth us because
[54:21] we thus judge
[54:22] that if one died for all then we're all
[54:25] dead
[54:26] and that he died for all that they which
[54:29] live should not live henceforth
[54:32] unto themselves but unto him which
[54:36] died for them and rose again see this is
[54:39] what the love of god
[54:41] it does it brings us to a place we're no
[54:44] longer living
[54:46] for ourselves and if we
[54:49] should even start in a direction maybe
[54:51] you've got a right to something or
[54:53] or what have you but the love of god
[54:55] will will bring conviction in your life
[54:58] because
[54:59] in that part the love of god will never
[55:01] abide
[55:02] with selfishness or or that and i tell
[55:05] you
[55:05] great is the love of god it prevails as
[55:08] we read
[55:09] some weeks ago floods cannot drown it
[55:12] there's nothing that can compare to the
[55:15] love of god
[55:16] paul said charity never
[55:24] it hasn't failed in your life look what
[55:26] it's produced in your life
[55:30] when people would have gave up on you
[55:32] when you gave up on you
[55:34] god didn't give up on you his love was
[55:38] projected
[55:39] kept on being projected and grace steps
[55:42] in to produce what love has called for
[55:46] charity never fail
[55:51] heavens and earth will pass away but my
[55:54] word will never pass away
[55:58] hallelujah glory be to god as the black
[56:02] brother testified he said i'd rather be
[56:04] standing on god's word than standing in
[56:06] heaven
[56:08] are you with me and he quoted that
[56:10] scripture and brother branham would pick
[56:11] it up
[56:11] he quoted he said because the word says
[56:14] heaven ever
[56:15] shall pass away but my word shall never
[56:18] pass away i'd rather be standing in the
[56:21] word than standing in
[56:29] praise the heaven i tell you brother you
[56:31] know brother ben says when the love of
[56:33] god comes into your heart
[56:35] into your life it drives out
[56:39] it casts out unbelief you see remember
[56:42] as brother bram says as you believe you
[56:45] become love
[56:46] the love of god bring projected as
[56:48] you're just taking that word in
[56:51] not just to hear ever but just absorbing
[56:53] saying
[56:54] amen lord be it unto me it drives out
[56:57] all the unbelief it draws drives out to
[57:00] things of the world
[57:01] and that's why you don't have to worry
[57:03] when the love of god comes in
[57:05] you're not worried about smoking you're
[57:06] not worried about drinking you're not
[57:08] worried about others other things
[57:10] why because the love of god has come in
[57:13] it has cast out unbelief it's cast out
[57:16] fear
[57:17] you're not walking around will i fail
[57:19] him next week
[57:20] you know there's a greater substance
[57:23] inside of you
[57:25] that is holding you
[57:28] and you're aware of it greater is he
[57:31] that's in me
[57:33] than he that's in the world hallelujah
[57:36] he comes in you no longer you know it's
[57:39] a
[57:40] your whole affection is upon him you're
[57:42] no longer walking around well they're
[57:44] narrow-minded and
[57:45] oh they don't believe this and they
[57:47] don't believe that you need to let the
[57:49] right temperance of love come in
[57:52] then his word is no longer grievous it's
[57:54] no longer why do we have to do this or
[57:56] why
[57:56] listen don't take that in one way of
[57:58] scolding yet i could be scolding you
[58:00] but look at it that there's a greater
[58:02] love for your life
[58:04] you don't have to it's not walking
[58:05] around by what the church teaches
[58:08] this and brother brown you know brother
[58:09] samuel says this it's got to go deeper
[58:11] than that what we're speaking of
[58:13] there's correction that has to come i
[58:15] have to correct my children
[58:17] if i love them but god's correction lets
[58:19] you and i know
[58:20] he loves us and there is a deeper
[58:23] life a deeper walk for you and i it's
[58:27] deeper than you
[58:28] keeping the word it must become god in
[58:31] you
[58:31] keeping his word
[58:36] see love love cast out fear amen
[58:40] now let me just work with this just a
[58:42] moment here
[58:43] the scripture says if our heart condemn
[58:47] us god is greater than our heart and
[58:49] knoweth all things
[58:50] to be able to look behind and say well
[58:53] this if the same things are being done
[58:55] then you can't have confidence so
[58:57] there's a place that we
[58:58] resolve we draw our confidence from
[59:02] that knowing that where we are standing
[59:04] with god
[59:05] in our heart that there's been a passing
[59:08] from death unto life and beloved if our
[59:13] heart condemn
[59:14] us not then we have confidence
[59:17] toward god if it condemn us not let me
[59:21] just say it like this
[59:22] if there's something that's in the way
[59:25] the enemy's always going to try to stand
[59:27] there
[59:28] when it comes time to obtain promises
[59:30] and he's going to rattle
[59:32] off all your failures
[59:35] but the scripture says beloved i write
[59:38] unto you you sin not if any man sin
[59:41] we have an advocate with the father
[59:44] jesus christ the righteous
[59:48] you see we've got a place where we're
[59:50] standing that we know
[59:52] within ourselves then yes there can be
[59:54] mistakes but yet the love affair in our
[59:57] heart
[59:57] there's not a desire to do wrong
[1:00:00] the desire is to please him
[1:00:04] don't confuse temptation with desire
[1:00:08] are you hearing me don't confuse
[1:00:10] temptation with desire
[1:00:12] temptation can be a pull a thought and
[1:00:14] everything
[1:00:15] and temptation when it comes it'll seem
[1:00:17] like it's your voice
[1:00:19] it's not your voice you say how do i
[1:00:21] know it's not my voice
[1:00:22] because your voice is a genuine voice of
[1:00:24] the word that
[1:00:25] before that will just sweep you away but
[1:00:28] there's something
[1:00:29] there on the inside that resists that
[1:00:31] that's the real voice of god
[1:00:36] temptation is not desire they're two
[1:00:38] separate things
[1:00:40] satan comes to try to tempt
[1:00:43] pool i want you to think of this here
[1:00:48] whatsoever we've got confidence that
[1:00:50] whatsoever we
[1:00:51] ask we receive of him because we
[1:00:54] keep his commandments and do those
[1:00:58] things that are
[1:00:59] pleasing in his sight it's one thing to
[1:01:02] be pleasing on one another's side
[1:01:03] but this is a whole different ball game
[1:01:05] being pleasing in his sight
[1:01:06] you see it's his life pulsating within
[1:01:09] us brother
[1:01:10] and sister when that life is that life
[1:01:12] has moved into us
[1:01:13] he observing the life of himself
[1:01:16] he sees himself on display
[1:01:19] in your life that's how he can stand
[1:01:23] there as a faithful high priest and
[1:01:24] inner seed and he could say father they
[1:01:26] didn't mean to do it why because your
[1:01:28] nature
[1:01:29] has been changed
[1:01:32] romans 8 1 there is therefore now no
[1:01:34] condemnation
[1:01:36] to them which are in christ jesus
[1:01:39] who walk not after the flesh
[1:01:42] but after the spirit notice you're not
[1:01:44] catering
[1:01:45] the the desire within you is not towards
[1:01:47] the flesh the desire
[1:01:49] is toward the spirit
[1:01:52] romans 8 33 who shall lay anything
[1:01:57] to the charge of god's elect it is god
[1:02:00] that justify
[1:02:02] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:02:04] that died yeah
[1:02:05] rather that's risen again who is even at
[1:02:08] the right hand of god
[1:02:10] who maketh intercession for us brother
[1:02:13] branham would take the people in the
[1:02:14] message desperation
[1:02:16] i can fill it he said upon your minds
[1:02:18] how do i know
[1:02:20] when this token's been applied look what
[1:02:23] you were and what are you
[1:02:27] there's evidence look look look what you
[1:02:30] wear
[1:02:31] and what you are look what you were
[1:02:33] before this token
[1:02:34] was applied to your life what your
[1:02:37] desires were
[1:02:38] before and now what your desires are

[1:02:52] filled with the spirit you're so in love

[1:02:57] be
[1:02:58] the truth he says your life's full of
[1:03:01] joy

[1:03:05] to be
[1:03:06] i didn't say it's what you want it to be
[1:03:08] yet but it's different
[1:03:10] from what it used to be
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:14] so when we see this here god's approval
[1:03:17] i want to just
[1:03:18] just deal with this part of it the
[1:03:20] perfect love perfect confidence
[1:03:21] god's approval of us there's only one
[1:03:25] there's only one place of god's approval
[1:03:27] and that is
[1:03:28] in the beloved brother brown would say
[1:03:30] it like this the cloudy skies and storms
[1:03:33] of life
[1:03:34] are no signs of god's disapproval
[1:03:38] and i want to ask you sometimes
[1:03:40] sometimes there's still
[1:03:41] battles with this oh this is going wrong
[1:03:44] this is going wrong oh i must i tell you
[1:03:46] i must have lived such a
[1:03:47] terrible life and i wait a minute are
[1:03:49] you talking about things before the
[1:03:51] blood
[1:03:54] how can you talk about things before the
[1:03:56] blood's been applied
[1:03:59] are you with me you see there are things
[1:04:02] stormy clouds why do you say that
[1:04:04] because
[1:04:05] when the blood has been applied the past
[1:04:08] has been
[1:04:08] dealt with your present
[1:04:12] is certain and so is your future
[1:04:15] god is not one who hangs things over our
[1:04:18] head and said i'm gonna make you pay for
[1:04:20] this
[1:04:21] the rest of your life that's a spirit
[1:04:24] of torment rebuke him
[1:04:27] cast him down he has no
[1:04:30] place
[1:04:34] you can't live in the past and go
[1:04:36] forward with god
[1:04:39] cloudy skies are no sign of god's
[1:04:42] disapproval
[1:04:44] neither are bright skies and still water
[1:04:47] signs of his love
[1:04:48] and approval his approval of any of us
[1:04:52] is only in the beloved his
[1:04:55] love is elective which he had before us
[1:04:57] for us before the foundation of the
[1:04:59] world
[1:05:00] does he love us ah yes but how shall we
[1:05:03] know
[1:05:04] oh i like that we shall know
[1:05:07] because he said so so already in his
[1:05:10] word
[1:05:11] he's already declared his love to us in
[1:05:13] his word
[1:05:15] and manifested that he did love
[1:05:19] us you see somebody could try to mess
[1:05:21] with you and say
[1:05:22] well that's wrotten in the word but that
[1:05:24] promise ain't for you
[1:05:25] but here's where you can put it right
[1:05:27] back in the devil's face and say
[1:05:29] it's not only been written but the love
[1:05:32] has been manifested to me
[1:05:38] hallelujah and manifested that he did
[1:05:41] love us
[1:05:41] for he brought us to himself and gave us
[1:05:45] his spirit placing us as sons
[1:05:49] and how shall i prove my love to him
[1:05:52] by believing what he said and by
[1:05:55] conducting myself with
[1:05:57] joy amidst the trials that he in his
[1:06:00] wisdom
[1:06:01] allows to come to pass i got quiet but
[1:06:04] it's all right if you just say it just
[1:06:05] keep his word say lord
[1:06:06] help me if i'm not at that point yet
[1:06:09] help me to get to that place to conduct
[1:06:12] myself with joy
[1:06:13] now you know joy joy ain't flipping out
[1:06:16] here
[1:06:17] you know where it's just based on how
[1:06:18] things are rising and falling you know
[1:06:20] what real joy is
[1:06:21] the joy of the lord is my strength you
[1:06:23] know what that's based on
[1:06:24] it's based on the fullness of his joy
[1:06:28] his life his love the holy ghost
[1:06:31] inside of you that's the real joy of the
[1:06:34] lord
[1:06:35] because all around us we'll face
[1:06:37] disappointments
[1:06:38] we'll face cloudy skies we'll face a lot
[1:06:41] of things but the
[1:06:42] joy of the lord is that i know in whom i
[1:06:45] have believed
[1:06:47] and i am persuaded that he's able to
[1:06:50] keep that
[1:06:50] which i've committed unto him against
[1:06:52] the day that's the joy of the lord are
[1:06:58] you with me
[1:07:02] hallelujah let me read this in romans 5
[1:07:06] 1. notice therefore being justified by
[1:07:09] faith
[1:07:09] we have peace with god through our lord
[1:07:11] jesus christ by whom
[1:07:13] also we have access by faith into this
[1:07:16] grace
[1:07:17] wherein we stand and rejoice
[1:07:20] in the hope of the glory of god
[1:07:23] we've got something to look forward to
[1:07:28] the devil ain't got nothing to look
[1:07:29] forward to
[1:07:32] the only thing he's got is a lake of
[1:07:34] fire
[1:07:36] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:07:40] but notice how paul will pick this up
[1:07:42] and not
[1:07:43] only so
[1:07:46] that's big words that is not our only
[1:07:49] glory like
[1:07:50] boy i tell you i can't wait till i get
[1:07:52] out here one of these days oh i just
[1:07:54] can't
[1:07:54] wait man when you're not reading the end
[1:07:56] of the story here
[1:07:58] we're not only glorying in the
[1:08:00] expectation
[1:08:01] of the change of our bodies of the
[1:08:05] resurrection
[1:08:06] of the dead in christ we're not just
[1:08:08] glorying that we have an assurance
[1:08:10] that right there i'm part of that i'm
[1:08:13] part of that rapture
[1:08:14] because that rapture is in me i've been
[1:08:17] cut away from the things of the world
[1:08:20] but that's
[1:08:20] not the only glory
[1:08:25] we glory in tribulations also
[1:08:32] if you just say
[1:08:36] lord jesus i'm going to take a big swig
[1:08:38] of the holy ghost and swallow that one
[1:08:39] down
[1:08:41] [Applause]
[1:08:42] hey you might as well be honest with him
[1:08:45] i'd rather be honest with him i'd rather
[1:08:48] stand there and say lord
[1:08:49] i'm not to that place to that level yet
[1:08:51] but i believe that lord
[1:08:53] that's what i'm looking for in my life
[1:08:56] god's not after pretenders
[1:08:58] he's after those who are honest before
[1:09:00] him he can
[1:09:01] move for those who are honest
[1:09:06] but we glory and tribulations also
[1:09:09] knowing that
[1:09:11] tribulation worketh patience
[1:09:15] and patience experience and experience
[1:09:18] hope and hope maketh not ashamed
[1:09:21] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:09:24] in our hearts
[1:09:25] by the holy ghost which is given unto us
[1:09:27] simply
[1:09:28] put we are aware even though we may not
[1:09:32] sign up for it
[1:09:33] we know that tribulation it's working
[1:09:36] endurance the tests and trials that he
[1:09:39] permits
[1:09:40] to come our way it's god molding us
[1:09:43] he's shaping our character and as we
[1:09:46] as that character is being molded and
[1:09:48] shaped listen to me
[1:09:49] the same expectation you have in the
[1:09:51] coming of the lord
[1:09:52] is the same expectation when you're
[1:09:55] going through the midst of a test or
[1:09:57] trial
[1:09:58] that you can stand there and say i don't
[1:10:00] know how it's all going to unfold
[1:10:03] i don't know how it's all going to come
[1:10:05] out but i
[1:10:06] am expecting god to move on the scene
[1:10:10] i'm not running around and jumping and
[1:10:12] saying look at this tribulation
[1:10:14] glory to god no the glory is that
[1:10:17] there's a love of god in my heart but i
[1:10:19] know
[1:10:20] he's with me he said he'd never leave me
[1:10:23] nor forsake me so i know regards of my
[1:10:26] feelings or how i feel
[1:10:28] that's what his word said and i've got
[1:10:31] his word inside of me
[1:10:33] and i'm expecting god to show up
[1:10:36] i'm expecting god to lead me through
[1:10:39] this test
[1:10:43] hallelujah
[1:10:47] and there might not be a time where
[1:10:48] you've got his hands it might be him
[1:10:50] packing you along
[1:10:52] but regardless he's got us
[1:11:00] hallelujah this is why paul would say
[1:11:03] that christ
[1:11:05] his prayer was that christ would dwell
[1:11:07] in our hearts by faith that we would be
[1:11:09] rooted and grounded in love that that's
[1:11:12] the good soil
[1:11:14] in love to draw because for a plant
[1:11:18] a plant a plant draws its nutrients not
[1:11:21] from its leaves
[1:11:22] it draws the nutrients from the ground
[1:11:25] is that right
[1:11:26] it's what's in the ground that it draws
[1:11:28] from when
[1:11:30] when when storms come about when there's
[1:11:32] times of drought
[1:11:34] there's got to be a source there's got
[1:11:36] to be roots that found water
[1:11:37] when there's dryness above when this
[1:11:40] feels dryness there's got to be
[1:11:42] an anchor that deep down in there that
[1:11:44] says i'm
[1:11:45] tapped into water oh we might feel weak
[1:11:48] and
[1:11:49] we're discouraged but deep down there's
[1:11:51] a source
[1:11:52] we're tapped into greater is he that is
[1:11:55] in you
[1:11:56] that he that's in the world it's a level
[1:11:58] god that steps forward
[1:12:00] in that moment
[1:12:03] hallelujah god let me just say it to you
[1:12:06] god has already spoken over your life
[1:12:09] god has already spoken
[1:12:11] in your life surely the lord will do
[1:12:14] nothing but what he reveals his secrets
[1:12:17] to his servants the prophets
[1:12:20] and the lion hath moroid who will
[1:12:23] fear the lord god has spoken who
[1:12:26] can but prophesy let me just bring it
[1:12:29] down to our life
[1:12:30] god has already spoken by the seal
[1:12:34] of his presence what could the devil
[1:12:36] take away
[1:12:37] or add to that what are you saying i'm
[1:12:40] talking about a finished work
[1:12:43] by a god who finishes what he starts
[1:12:52] hallelujah there's something to remember
[1:12:56] something to remember remember god
[1:12:59] he wanted israel to remember he wanted
[1:13:03] israel to remember
[1:13:04] i brought you out of egypt i sought out
[1:13:06] places for you to put your tents
[1:13:08] i did all this brother said it like this
[1:13:12] in perfect faith
[1:13:13] when we were sinners alienated without
[1:13:16] god
[1:13:16] in the world in that muck of mud
[1:13:19] he said as i talked about this morning
[1:13:22] god
[1:13:23] come to us
[1:13:26] oh i come to god no you didn't god came
[1:13:28] to you
[1:13:32] god sought you you never saw god
[1:13:35] no man can come to me except the father
[1:13:37] draws him first and
[1:13:38] god came down in that muck what you were
[1:13:42] and sought you out and brought you out
[1:13:46] that ought to create a perfect love
[1:13:49] see when we're not this is where we're
[1:13:52] putting the real evidence
[1:13:53] on what he has done he came to where you
[1:13:56] were
[1:13:57] and he brought you out oh there was a
[1:14:00] mighty hold upon your life
[1:14:02] that first nature that pharaoh that
[1:14:05] scoffed at the word
[1:14:06] that pharaoh that thought he had it but
[1:14:08] there was a mighty one
[1:14:10] who came into your life a mighty one who
[1:14:14] begin to overthrow
[1:14:15] doubt and unbelief and fear and begin to
[1:14:18] dismantle holes
[1:14:19] who is that that's a god who loves you
[1:14:23] and that ought to create
[1:14:26] a perfect love look what she was
[1:14:31] look what you are
[1:14:34] i'm talking about evidences now look
[1:14:36] what's your word
[1:14:37] look what you are what did that somebody
[1:14:41] that loves you
[1:14:42] can't you have faith in what he promised
[1:14:44] you then real genuine love
[1:14:47] will create a confidence in his word
[1:14:54] amen
[1:14:56] i think there's times we need to
[1:14:57] rehearse the word
[1:15:00] come on now the devil does enough
[1:15:02] rehearsing they're trying to whoop
[1:15:04] around and try to beat
[1:15:05] try to put different things and and you
[1:15:07] know that devil he knows he can come and
[1:15:08] try to quote the word and try to tie you
[1:15:10] up
[1:15:11] he'll try to put condemnation on your
[1:15:13] life are you hearing me this morning
[1:15:15] but you let god get a hold of you see he
[1:15:17] can't overthrow
[1:15:18] the work of god in your life but he's
[1:15:20] trying to hinder it
[1:15:22] he's trying to hinder the confidence
[1:15:24] because if you
[1:15:25] can have confidence in what god has made
[1:15:28] you
[1:15:29] what he's done in your life and you know
[1:15:31] you're walking and stepped with him
[1:15:33] there in a devil can stand before you
[1:15:38] are you hearing me this ain't pie in the
[1:15:40] sky this is thus saith the lord
[1:15:45] he caught me i like this to me this is
[1:15:46] something we need to break forth in a
[1:15:48] testimony service
[1:15:50] this is what needs to be said he caught
[1:15:52] me when i was nothing
[1:15:54] i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand
[1:15:57] he caught me he loved me when i was
[1:16:00] unlovable
[1:16:01] he loved you when you was unlovable he
[1:16:04] changed you the brother said just like
[1:16:08] the colored sister
[1:16:09] when she said i'm not what i ought to be
[1:16:11] i'm not what i want to be
[1:16:12] but that i know i'm not what i used to
[1:16:15] be
[1:16:15] she knowed she had come
[1:16:18] somewhere something
[1:16:21] happened
[1:16:24] that's the measuring stick on the inside
[1:16:27] are you with me
[1:16:28] that's a standard that you live by on
[1:16:30] the inside that you know
[1:16:32] that you've been brought from somewhere
[1:16:34] he changed you
[1:16:37] oh my you see he's seen something in you
[1:16:40] seen something in me
[1:16:41] look at the people he said that's
[1:16:42] unsaved today millions and he said but
[1:16:44] nobody can take your place
[1:16:46] you're in god's economy no one can do it
[1:16:49] that's his love to you oh he says and
[1:16:52] then won't your love
[1:16:53] reach right back to him and there's a
[1:16:56] love affair
[1:16:58] no matter what the situation is
[1:17:02] no matter what the situation is its
[1:17:06] circumstances is governed
[1:17:09] by this love that creates faith
[1:17:12] [Music]
[1:17:14] god loves you you love god you love one
[1:17:17] another
[1:17:18] that brings faith now
[1:17:21] every situation we face we need faith
[1:17:25] is that right when the faith of god has
[1:17:27] moved inside of our life
[1:17:30] it brings the change the transformation
[1:17:32] the new birth
[1:17:35] and we need faith for every situation
[1:17:40] no matter what it is it comes up it's
[1:17:42] not that you don't have faith but
[1:17:44] sometimes we're looking and
[1:17:45] you know what is your praying about
[1:17:46] things in the lord do i go this
[1:17:48] direction
[1:17:49] do i go that direction or something
[1:17:51] arises and you're facing it and there
[1:17:53] ain't no going around it
[1:17:54] right there ain't no saying you know
[1:17:56] what i'll turn it off and
[1:17:58] come back you know and resume the next
[1:18:00] time
[1:18:01] no there's things in life you just don't
[1:18:03] you can't shut it off
[1:18:05] this ain't a game you got to face it
[1:18:10] is that right that's many things what's
[1:18:11] wrong with this generation they
[1:18:13] i just turn it off i just reset it i
[1:18:14] just get a passcode you know you can't
[1:18:16] get around it
[1:18:17] life situations you've got to face it
[1:18:20] head-on
[1:18:22] is that right sometimes let's just be
[1:18:25] honest well let me just preach a little
[1:18:26] bit here
[1:18:28] let's just take a couple examples here's
[1:18:30] a man by the name of sham guard
[1:18:31] we're there in one scripture yeah one
[1:18:34] scripture
[1:18:35] it doesn't even go into details about
[1:18:37] shamkar but the prophet of god in this
[1:18:39] age could go back
[1:18:41] and he could deal with deal with
[1:18:42] shamgar's life shamgar was a man who
[1:18:45] they raised their crops and here they
[1:18:47] get them to a place of harvest time
[1:18:50] and sham guard could look out there and
[1:18:51] say my this is gonna be enough food to
[1:18:54] sustain our family here for the
[1:18:56] for the winter boy we're gonna this this
[1:18:58] is gonna be good
[1:18:59] you see because every time when it would
[1:19:02] come to that place
[1:19:03] of harvest philistines would show up
[1:19:07] and they wanted to take all the labor
[1:19:10] that had been put in there brother brahm
[1:19:13] talks about how satan would want to try
[1:19:14] to come into a church
[1:19:16] he said even he said even in your life
[1:19:18] he said when a promise has been given
[1:19:20] you
[1:19:20] and he says you're standing there and
[1:19:22] the devil come and whisper and say
[1:19:24] look at you you're you're still not well
[1:19:27] yet you're still not healed yet yeah
[1:19:29] but you see shamgar in this day not
[1:19:32] you know for years years he had taken
[1:19:35] that weapon
[1:19:37] are you with me but he didn't have to
[1:19:39] take that weapon
[1:19:42] something started changing he started
[1:19:45] looking at that crop
[1:19:47] thinking about his family and about that
[1:19:49] time
[1:19:50] he's looking around and he hears the the
[1:19:52] philistines come
[1:19:53] marching in and he looks at himself how
[1:19:56] can i do this
[1:19:58] i'm not a warrior i don't even know how
[1:20:00] to fight with spears and
[1:20:01] and this and that and there's 600 of
[1:20:03] them coming but you see
[1:20:05] listen to me at that moment brother bram
[1:20:08] said
[1:20:08] god moved in you know why because he
[1:20:11] began to faint
[1:20:12] not in terms of defeat
[1:20:16] it came to a spot where he said not
[1:20:19] today
[1:20:22] his thoughts begin to change and notice
[1:20:26] he could not move himself to where he
[1:20:29] needed to be
[1:20:30] but he began to think in a manner of
[1:20:33] considering
[1:20:34] himself considering his family and about
[1:20:37] that time
[1:20:38] god moved in shamgar got angry
[1:20:42] let me tell you something you need to
[1:20:44] get angry with the devil
[1:20:51] if there's one old booger we need to
[1:20:53] cancel you need to cancel him
[1:20:57] are you hearing me
[1:21:00] sam god made a statement not today
[1:21:04] he began to think i know i don't know
[1:21:06] how to fight
[1:21:07] i know i don't know how to do this but
[1:21:09] something begin to move within him
[1:21:11] this is what belongs to us and he said
[1:21:15] i am a seed of abraham
[1:21:18] i've got a covenant i'm a circumcised
[1:21:22] child of god and they are uncircumcised
[1:21:25] oh notice how god begin to move
[1:21:29] and the thoughts begin to flood in on
[1:21:31] his life
[1:21:32] and he stands there and takes an ox goad
[1:21:35] and he beats 600 philistines
[1:21:40] you know why god begin to move
[1:21:46] he could have had all sorts no doubt
[1:21:48] condemnation around same on you you're
[1:21:50] not a very good daddy not a very good
[1:21:51] husband you're not this you're not fat
[1:21:53] but about that time it was something
[1:21:55] moving within him not today
[1:21:58] not today let me just tell the devil not
[1:22:00] today
[1:22:02] not today
[1:22:03] [Applause]
[1:22:07] there's a lot why john could write
[1:22:09] whatsoever is born of god
[1:22:11] overcometh the world
[1:22:14] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:22:17] the world
[1:22:18] even our faith amen perfect faith
[1:22:22] because we know we can't have faith
[1:22:23] without love
[1:22:25] but perfect faith and i want you to
[1:22:26] listen you there are some of you that
[1:22:28] are sitting here you've heard these
[1:22:30] statements for years
[1:22:31] but it's time it's time we need to apply
[1:22:34] prayer of faith is a
[1:22:35] master of all circumstances
[1:22:39] i'm gonna tell you there's circumstances
[1:22:40] that have come about in our life
[1:22:42] maybe in your life you never would have
[1:22:44] dreamed you'd be facing
[1:22:46] that's true but let me tell you
[1:22:48] something you're not
[1:22:50] alone
[1:22:53] perfect faith is a master
[1:22:56] of every circumstance perfect faith
[1:22:58] don't make circumstances go away are you
[1:23:00] hearing me
[1:23:02] it don't make them go away you don't
[1:23:03] make it well i spoke to and it didn't go
[1:23:05] away
[1:23:06] perfect faith is not making
[1:23:07] circumstances going away
[1:23:09] perfect faith brings a prevailing and an
[1:23:12] overcoming to master something
[1:23:14] means to prevail and to overcome
[1:23:17] jesus faced circumstances
[1:23:21] over and over this was not the lamb of
[1:23:24] god going to calvary
[1:23:25] circumstance free all the fullness of
[1:23:28] the godhead bodily within him
[1:23:29] no circumstances around him quite the
[1:23:32] contrary
[1:23:33] circumstances were always around demons
[1:23:36] of sickness
[1:23:37] demons of torment
[1:23:40] demons that would get in the weather try
[1:23:42] to drown him
[1:23:44] come on now demons that would come
[1:23:47] around try to get among his brethren
[1:23:49] all of these things he was faced with
[1:23:51] circumstances
[1:23:54] he stood in the face of death had to
[1:23:57] face that circumstance
[1:24:01] but here's what faith faith we know is a
[1:24:05] revelation is that right
[1:24:07] when that revelation's in our heart
[1:24:10] we're standing on that
[1:24:12] i don't know how god's gonna do it maybe
[1:24:14] there's times that god will reveal
[1:24:16] this is going to come out this way
[1:24:17] you're going to do this you're going to
[1:24:18] do that
[1:24:19] and there's other times it doesn't hey
[1:24:21] you say that scripture
[1:24:23] come on the hebrew children king
[1:24:26] we don't know if our god's going to
[1:24:29] deliver us out of this furnace
[1:24:31] but we know one thing wing bound he's
[1:24:34] going to deliver us out of your hands
[1:24:41] that's faith faith let me just say
[1:24:44] something
[1:24:44] faith mastering a circumstance um
[1:24:49] the stats gives stats family over in
[1:24:52] germany

[1:25:08] right sister statscliff i love this
[1:25:10] personal thing she wrote to brother
[1:25:12] branham
[1:25:13] branham she said i must have not had
[1:25:16] real faith
[1:25:17] because my baby died he said oh no quite
[1:25:20] the contrary
[1:25:21] he said showing that you had real faith
[1:25:23] that even when god
[1:25:24] didn't answer it the way you wanted you
[1:25:26] stood solid
[1:25:30] faith doesn't mean that we get all the
[1:25:32] answers the way we want them that ain't
[1:25:34] faith but
[1:25:34] faith stands on his word
[1:25:39] wipe the contrary you've got great
[1:25:42] faith because you stood on his word that
[1:25:45] no matter what like joke
[1:25:47] yay though he slay me
[1:25:50] i will serve him
[1:25:54] perfect love perfect confidence
[1:26:00] faith believes that god will work it out
[1:26:03] this a mighty big statement
[1:26:05] i don't know how he's going to do it but
[1:26:08] he'll do it anyhow
[1:26:13] oh it masters every
[1:26:16] circumstance

[1:26:49] i'm talking about circumstances can
[1:26:51] arise situations
[1:26:53] and they come before you fear has
[1:26:56] torment
[1:26:57] fear can try to dominate fear can try to
[1:27:00] drive you
[1:27:01] to do things that you'll do it that it
[1:27:03] isn't even
[1:27:04] it isn't even right with his word it's
[1:27:06] out of fear and fear brings worry
[1:27:09] uncertainty a lack of confidence let me
[1:27:12] just tell you something
[1:27:13] our confidence is not in

[1:27:29] these nations are more than i how can i
[1:27:32] dispossess them
[1:27:34] thou shalt not be afraid but thou shalt
[1:27:37] well remember
[1:27:38] what the lord thy god did unto pharaoh
[1:27:40] and unto all of egypt
[1:27:42] you see how he's combating fear remember
[1:27:45] where he brought you from he brought you
[1:27:48] from there
[1:27:49] look where he's brought you to this is
[1:27:52] how you stand
[1:27:53] in the face of fear and say food devil

[1:28:00] thine eyes saw
[1:28:01] signs wonders the mighty hand the
[1:28:04] stretched out arm
[1:28:05] whereby the lord thy god brought thee
[1:28:07] out so shall the lord thy god do

[1:28:30] that was upon your life i've changed
[1:28:32] your nature
[1:28:33] i'm the god who did that all you did was
[1:28:36] surrender
[1:28:37] to my word and i performed my word
[1:28:41] i'm the same god and i'll act the same
[1:28:43] way in this time
[1:28:48] god said i'll send the hornet that
[1:28:51] wasn't a bunch of bees going in there
[1:28:52] either
[1:28:53] it wasn't somebody in a big old yellow
[1:28:54] suit going in the hornet is the angel of
[1:28:57] the lord
[1:28:58] are you with me that's the hornet the
[1:29:00] angel the lord that would go in there
[1:29:02] and bring a sting upon their life and
[1:29:05] fear
[1:29:06] fear would take a hold of them because
[1:29:09] they were witnessing
[1:29:10] what the mighty god was doing
[1:29:13] through his people
[1:29:17] jesus said i'm coming down jesus said
[1:29:20] when he stood here perfect confidence in
[1:29:21] the word
[1:29:22] destroyed this temple three days i'll
[1:29:24] raise it back up
[1:29:26] comes close coming now getting close to
[1:29:29] the time of the crucifixion
[1:29:30] he says john 12 27 now is my soul
[1:29:34] troubled what shall i say father save me
[1:29:37] from this hour
[1:29:38] but for this cause came my hand unto
[1:29:40] this uh on to this
[1:29:41] hour father glorified thy name then
[1:29:43] there came a voice from heaven saying i
[1:29:45] have both glorified it and will glorify
[1:29:47] it again
[1:29:48] now into the garden hebrews 5 7 who in
[1:29:51] the days
[1:29:52] of his flesh when he had offered up
[1:29:54] prayers and supplications
[1:29:56] with strong crying and tears unto him
[1:29:58] that was
[1:29:59] able to save him from death
[1:30:03] and was heard in that
[1:30:07] he feared
[1:30:10] the son of god feared
[1:30:14] now he wasn't fearing who he was
[1:30:18] are you with me this is the joy that we
[1:30:21] draw from to conduct
[1:30:22] in the midst of trials but what he
[1:30:25] feared
[1:30:26] was what he knew about the crucifixion
[1:30:30] it's just like something can come your
[1:30:32] way you got cancer
[1:30:34] or this has come about fear could come
[1:30:37] in
[1:30:38] oh you know this could be oh your life

[1:30:43] might be in a wheelchair you know your
[1:30:45] back you know how it is
[1:30:46] you know how this could
[1:30:49] fear can come in
[1:30:53] but here's how he overcame fear
[1:30:56] nevertheless
[1:30:57] not my will thy will
[1:31:01] it's to draw from the joy of the lord
[1:31:05] that you know who you are
[1:31:08] facing circumstances facing
[1:31:11] circumstances remember samuel
[1:31:12] in order to master this i've got to know
[1:31:15] faith
[1:31:16] is not knowing faith is just something
[1:31:19] that
[1:31:20] brother greg it just drops and you can't
[1:31:21] explain it somebody say how do you know
[1:31:22] that i don't know it just
[1:31:24] it's just something just it just tells
[1:31:25] me i i don't know how to explain it
[1:31:28] it's just it's there i don't know how it
[1:31:30] just it's
[1:31:31] dropped from here to there
[1:31:36] oh aren't you thankful amen when
[1:31:38] situations arise
[1:31:40] we can stand there and look to god and
[1:31:42] you know you might be driving down the
[1:31:43] road
[1:31:44] and you've been praying and all of a
[1:31:45] sudden it just breathing
[1:31:49] i don't know how to explain that and yet
[1:31:52] you're still in the midst of a situation
[1:31:55] boy it's like
[1:32:00] the answer is already arrived
[1:32:03] but in the meantime we stand upon his
[1:32:06] word
[1:32:09] he cannot fail we keep his commandments
[1:32:13] you see this is why brother brown said
[1:32:14] you know when he talked about when
[1:32:17] when when greece jumps you know you're
[1:32:19] frying your eggs and the grease comes
[1:32:20] out and he says it
[1:32:22] it hits your skin he said it ain't the
[1:32:24] grief
[1:32:25] that burns you it's the fear
[1:32:29] [Music]
[1:32:30] hey the waves couldn't take peter down
[1:32:33] all right
[1:32:34] man my phone responding to me

[1:32:44] i'm talking about in god's word right
[1:32:46] now amen
[1:32:48] the waves didn't take peter down it was
[1:32:50] his fear
[1:32:52] listen to me he had substance faith
[1:32:56] but brother braham says that he began to
[1:32:58] lose substance
[1:33:00] when he started looking at the waves
[1:33:06] what should i do look to the one whom
[1:33:09] you said lord
[1:33:10] didn't he come and he said come i'm
[1:33:12] sorry
[1:33:13] the carlos he didn't explain well you
[1:33:15] know this is this is a molecular
[1:33:16] structure that
[1:33:17] nah
[1:33:21] he started walking but when he started
[1:33:22] looking at the at the wave starting to
[1:33:24] consider
[1:33:25] fear got in but you know what
[1:33:28] he did one thing that was so awesome
[1:33:30] lord
[1:33:31] help me let's not sing
[1:33:36] and jesus came over and stretched down
[1:33:38] his hands
[1:33:40] and picked him up you see
[1:33:43] this is where david said psalms 56
[1:33:47] 3 what time i am afraid
[1:33:51] i will trust in thee
[1:33:56] what time i am afraid i will trust in
[1:33:58] thee
[1:33:59] psalm 62 8 out of the message shalom
[1:34:03] trust in him at all times
[1:34:07] you people pour your heart out before
[1:34:09] him god is a refuge for us
[1:34:12] see if we can stand there and just take
[1:34:13] god at his word brother ram says it like
[1:34:15] this
[1:34:16] just say i love you lord i know you're
[1:34:17] going to answer because you promised me
[1:34:19] you would
[1:34:19] i just know you're going to do it and it
[1:34:22] takes
[1:34:22] away all fear
[1:34:30] so the devil wants to tell you well if
[1:34:31] you were a real good christian fear
[1:34:33] wouldn't come
[1:34:34] you've got authority to back him up
[1:34:38] fear has torment you've got authority to
[1:34:42] back him up
[1:34:43] fear we can experience fear out here in
[1:34:45] this realm but we know where we're
[1:34:47] standing with god
[1:34:49] and that perfect love gives us perfect
[1:34:51] confidence to stand there and say
[1:34:53] i don't know how you're going to do it
[1:34:55] lord but i know you're working
[1:34:58] anybody know what i'm talking about when
[1:35:00] you had to stand there with things and
[1:35:02] it seems like
[1:35:03] opposition is passed it's just piling up
[1:35:05] against you but you could stand there
[1:35:07] and say i don't know how
[1:35:09] but i know this is your word and i'm
[1:35:11] gonna stay
[1:35:12] right here on this world
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:21] hallelujah let's stand
[1:35:26] brother brown was going through
[1:35:27] something in his life
[1:35:32] brother brown got into a place and he
[1:35:34] says this is going from the second pool
[1:35:36] into the third pool
[1:35:38] he got to a place where he said
[1:35:42] he was afraid afraid of failure
[1:35:48] i think that's very fitting because you
[1:35:49] see where the time where he was at
[1:35:52] and that's the same thing that god made
[1:35:53] known to joshua
[1:35:55] as i was with moses i'll be with you
[1:35:58] also
[1:36:00] be strong and have a good courage don't
[1:36:03] be afraid
[1:36:04] don't be dismayed and brother joy
[1:36:08] bilabram talks about walking by a radio
[1:36:10] and a preacher was on there preaching
[1:36:12] about the resurrection
[1:36:14] brother brown as he's walking by there
[1:36:16] he says i notice he said something began
[1:36:17] to strike me
[1:36:18] the minister was quoting things from
[1:36:21] general
[1:36:22] patton and he began to quote it he says
[1:36:25] and general patton was telling them
[1:36:27] he says send me more men sent him
[1:36:30] another group of men
[1:36:31] those men were dying and general patton
[1:36:33] told him said
[1:36:35] i need more men but you keep losing he
[1:36:37] said i've told you
[1:36:38] i want men and don't send me cowards
[1:36:41] i need men that are ready to die for
[1:36:44] this cause

[1:37:08] then he said something brother bram said
[1:37:09] something spoke to my heart
[1:37:12] and he said i remembered also something
[1:37:15] that president eisenhower said
[1:37:18] he talked about he said when he would
[1:37:20] put that bullet in the gun

[1:37:42] it but i'm gonna stand
[1:37:44] on his word i'm gonna keep plugging
[1:37:46] bullet after bullet keep praying
