Hallelujah How Sweet the Sound I once was lost but now I found a hopeless an empty [Music] place if not for gra I'd be a hopeless case a hopeless case an empty place if not for gra hallelujah hallelujah oh thank you Lord [Applause] Jesus we're certainly living in a great hour amen you know when we look around us and we see the things that are taking place continually and the pray requests that went up we're always in line when we pray for the Peace of Jerusalem we realize that there'll never be peace on the earth in the system that it is but we know what we're praying about because there is a promise that God himself will bring everything centered right there we know that where we're standing in this hour by God's grace we've received a rapturing message rapturing Grace than you Lord we know the very next thing that is to come amen is the re is the rapture and we step into the wedding supper then from there into the millennium my what changes will take place even in Israel at that time when the bride's off the scene the 144,000 gets her call you know when that when the news struck and I didn't comment too much on it on Sunday but when the news struck on Saturday the first thing that struck my heart because you know that Israel is always on top of things if if there's anybody you want to know where that person is ask Israel but I couldn't help but something and I I didn't I didn't read up on it but something just struck my heart and I was with some other ministers on Saturday morning and I I said you know what I can't help but resonate in my heart is they know that evil was all around them somehow I wonder I said if there was just a little bit of laxness that got in there that's because Israel wouldn't have permitted that you wouldn't permit that I I wouldn't permit we wouldn't permit the enemy to come into our home wouldn't permit the enemy but you see even now you're finding out reports Egypt told them right Egypt let him know certain things and I I just say it in this way it it shows that Israel's All Surrounded and one thing about it you know God is with Israel amen God is with God is with his people you know why because there's 144,000 yes sir that are to be sealed that's right that's why Hallelujah you know why the Merc mercy of God is still here because they're still elect to be brought in the blood's still on The Mercy Seat the lamb is still speaking with full Authority and in this hour that we're we're living and I think man is the Bride of Jesus Christ David spoke of it in Psalms 27 we're surrounded we're surrounded yeah but ain't it wonderful that as psalms 27 goes on to read that our focus is not about on everything that's around us right that doesn't mean that we're ignoring it that don't mean we're becoming laxed it's quite the opposite when we have a desire to dwell only in the house of the Lord that's the secret to Victory right there that's the secret to preparedness that I don't have to try to scope out every way the enemy is trying to get me all I have to do is keep my eyes on him and keep that desire and keep everything clear and God himself will unfold every tactic of the enemy Hallelujah I got confidence in him don't you amen it's it's a it's I tell you it's a horrible atrocities that the things that um you know no wonder my wife I I didn't realize about it but my wife just said you know they're really I guess in the states here they're telling the people as far as the young people and everybody else stay off the social media and stuff because of things that'll be posted and everything else and you you can't even grasp how that people could be that heartless but I want to tell you what it is it isn't man it's Spirits that's right and those Nations themselves let me just tell you like this those nations are actually benefiting from things that Israel has found out that's good that's from their medical Technologies to on and on and on that's right and they don't even know why they hate them right right but it's a spirit because you see within the midst of it God's made a promise promise that he's going to bring Israel back you and I are that hidden part inside of there the mystery that's of God that's being worked out but God made a promise and I'll tell you what God ain't never had to repent you don't ever have to back up and say I made a mistake I didn't realize it going to be this hard God is right on time he's right on time God is going to gather his people home I tell you I'm thank God there's a place of safety there's a place of hiding we want to pray for them we want to pray for them and I know you have been continued there within Israel and uh that God will just continue to be merciful there I I just I I know it in this way and I I don't say it in overconfidence I just said there's a rest in it God just the littlest place but God's watching over it you know you might feel so small God's Watching Over You amen an't it powerful littlest place and yet it's a place that's most hated it's Spirits it's Spirits it it's it's spirits but aren't you glad that the holy spirit is present yes he has brought peace in your heart peace in your life and that's what he wants to do tonight no matter what the situation is he's here the Prince of Peace amen our Shalom don't you love him tonight and so good to be gathered here together tonight in his presence so glad to have amen the different ones from uh brother Nathaniel there and and the church there and we're just so thankful to have all our visitors here with us so to have sister Kiara been a long time since you've been here amen so we're glad to have brother codre here with us and I told him like I do each time you're at home you're at home you just obey the Lord and we're just we're thankful that brother codre would come by our way tonight aren't we amen and uh I know brother kre doesn't need any introduction but we just want the Lord to have his way tonight and we just want to just pull on the gift of God I believe just as brother Nathaniel was praying here that God knows the needs that we have on our hearts he knows the directions that we're praying about God knows those things and he cares and God has such a way that he can say it word by word and then there's times where God will say things that it's like in code nobody else will catch it but you catch it that's good pre and it's so clear as though everything was said and wrote out right here true and the God will say it because it's so personal to you and you get that message and if you tried to say something to somebody else about say well I didn't hear him say that that's right but you see the spirit of the Lord the spirit of Truth he comes and reveals to us what we have need of I'm glad I'm aren't you glad he's that personal amen amen Brother codre come on tonight and amen we just want to let's continue to sing that song where would I be oh you only know I'm glad you see through Eyes Of Love a hopeless case and empty [Music] place where would I be you all youy through a hopess [Music] amen praise the Lord ain't it good to be in the house of the Lord tonight yes amen we thank God for his grace and his Mercy amen and how God Is So intentional you know and everything he does there's a purpose right you know there's nothing that catches God off God off guard you know the devil does stuff and there's never been a time where God says got me that's right there never been a time that's right in your life and my life and anybody that we know God knows everything that's going to take place you know so what should that do for the believer that should encourage us amen to know that God is in control of Our Lives amen but again it's good to see everybody amen we thank God for all of you amen and uh certainly appreciate brother Samuel amen just allowing us to come and you know and the the most thing that we have in common is the Lord Jesus Christ amen let us all stand we'll have a word of prayer and we'll get right into the word of God tonight if you have a unspoken request you can acknowledge it to the Lord by up lifted hand amen let's pray Lord Jesus father you see our hands are lifted to you Lord and Lord you know Lord the need Lord you know our desire father Lord let our desires be according to your will Lord for Lord if we know it's your will we pray according to your will nothing are standing a way of it coming to pass so Lord God give us your thoughts Lord not our thoughts Lord Lord give us your ways not our ways Lord Lord that it'll be you praying lord lord lord it'll be you interceding interceding for the need in our lives Lord and Lord we pray the blessing of the Kingdom upon the congregation tonight Lord that father God youd move in such a mighty way Lord Beyond just a TR traditional Thursday night but Lord a God who can speak Lord and speak specifically and directly Lord Lord to that need that's been sent up to you in prayer and Lord we know Lord God that you are more than able to do what you said you would do Lord Lord we pray father that you would in in hearing Lord you would give us understanding Lord and and and seeing Lord Lord we would see what you have us to see Lord and now Lord we lay ourselves aside father we practice the greatest gift given unto man Lord and us moving out of the way Lord that you could have relations with your creation one more time in the name of Jesus Christ we pray Lord and as we always say Lord forgive us Lord for our sins and iniquities Lord the transgressions Lord that we've committed Lord even the things unknowingly Lord that's a stench in your nostrils Lord father make us aware Lord God and give us the will to do it and make it right Lord so we can stay under that atoning blood that's atoning even so right now in the name of Jesus Christ we pray let church say amen amen amen praise the Lord if you have your Bibles let's turn to Genesis Chapter 18 amen praise God Genesis Chapter 18 and we're just going to read um one verse out of here and then we're going to go to habaka the second chapter Genesis 18 and verse 14 the Bible says is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son amen let's go to habaka chapter 2 habaka chapter [Music] 2 verse one the Bible says I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the towels and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t amen may the Lord at a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats by God's grace tonight I want to use for a subject The Mystery of Life The Mystery of Life amen you know when we speak of Life uh you can't talk about life good life without talking about God because outside of him we're not really living we're not really living life and and and and and life God say he he's come to give us life and life more abundantly amen so not just any your regular life but an abundant life and this Abundant Life should speak of Christ amen but what I want tonight by the grace of God is as a people of god let's have an attitude adjustment Hallelujah on cuz when we look at life we can be very stubborn and we we and me I we all would say I want my life to go this way but I'm here to say that your life is hidden and revealed in the mystery of God that's right Hallelujah so what you may look at concerning life is not what God is looking at and what you might want to come out of life is not what God may want to come out of life so our attitudes should just to should adjust to the way God is revealing the mystery of our life Hallelujah and you know church when you when you speak of a mystery I don't want to say of something that's that hasn't been revealed Hallelujah because we're in a day we're in a time where the mystery of Christ who is life has been revealed Hallelujah so what I'm saying tonight is who you are Hallelujah your life should be standing in looking at you in the mirror Hallelujah the things that happen to us the things that take place it shouldn't Hallelujah we shouldn't be shocked Hallelujah but we should look at these things and say hey God is in control Hallelujah and you know God God God has a way of doing things to bring out the best of Life Hallelujah that's right and that's what it's all about Hallelujah God wants to bring out the best in you Hallelujah he wants to bring out the best of your life Hallelujah the best best of your strength the best of your abilities Hallelujah the best of who you are concerning life but it looks like a mystery because to get the best of us you got to receive some strength Ain get too many amens on that one brother sers Hallelujah to get the best out of her she got to go through some pain Hallelujah to get the best out of us you may have to go down a road Hallelujah that's still a mystery Hallelujah and you know church when we look and we read the Bible right here where God told Abraham Hallelujah he told Abraham look look look before I go into this just let me peek it back off what brother Samuel was saying about Israel Hallelujah as we look at Israel and we see all these things taking place it has to be this way Hallelujah Israel has to fight Hallelujah the world has to turn again Israel why because God said so in his word hallelujah so the mystery of Israel Hallelujah Israel's life has been revealed to the bride of Christ Hall so we should see these things and we should Hallelujah say this is a joyous occasion hallelujah hallelujah this for us oh my if I can say it like this for us this is not a time of pain but for Israel it is see Israel is receiving the pain and we are receiving the joy of Life Hallelujah because in their pain we're being revealed Hallelujah in their pain we're getting ready to step out of here hallelujah so when we look at life and everybody else is saying oh it's a war it's a war it's a war all the pain all the agony all the lies we're standing back saying thank you Jesus because the miss history of this time that's been appointed is unfolding right before our eyes so a lot of times when things happen in a stressful and painful mode we have to take an attitude to judgment and ask ourselves is this God hallelujah because when you look at things through a natural lens of Life you'll miss God hallelujah because God is hidden and revealed in Simplicity and he also so Hallelujah he reveals himself Hallelujah not to the wise amen right but to the simple-hearted the simple-minded and you would think of God who's Hallelujah who doesn't have to be taught wisdom who who who needs no more strength who needs no more help anything about him Hallelujah it would seem very mysterious but God came down and he put the mystery of life right in our hands Hallelujah right in our face Hallelujah therefore church when we look at life and the different things that happen to us we ought to look through a different lens to say Lord I appreciate what you're doing Hallelujah because you're getting me ready for something amen you know just brings me Hallelujah hold on for a second it brings me uh to the scripture or to the message the prophet preached called birth pains Hallelujah and when he talked about birth he included pain with it Hallelujah birth pain and for you mothers who have had a child the Bible says when that mother is in travail she remembers pain and stress and all these things until the baby is born when the baby is born Hallelujah that life Hallelujah takes away all the pain the revealing Hallelujah of what was inside the revealing of the mystery Hallelujah brings joy to that mother Hallelujah although she had contractions and although she had Mourning sickness and although her walk had to change her wardrobe had to change she experienced pain at the pain but when that baby is born she remembers the pain no more W Hallelujah so church it's the mystery of what's inside of you being revealed through pain that has us rejoicing [Applause] Hallelujah now we know how this work you pull I preach and right now some of you in relaxed mode on you're just chilling but I want you to understand Hallelujah there's a mystery being revealed it it's being revealed right now about you and your life you say brother my life is all jacked up that's because there's something about you God is trying to unfold God is trying to unveil Hallelujah and God will never get the real you without any stress and pain and there are things in us that we didn't even know was in us hallelujah until we get on that path amen amen hallelujah look God God loves a challenge Hallelujah and you know what the Lord's been doing with me brother Samuel most places I've gone you know the services have been a little different huj more than just a regular service you know I was in if you don't mind me testifying for a second I was in Canada about two weeks ago and we were having some Youth Services and and you know I was in my hotel room and just like any other minister you just trying to catch the mind of God you know you cuz you when you speak you want to speak life Hallelujah preaching to me is not about me showing you my Revelation preaching is about me getting out of the way so God can have a one onone with you that's so God can ask your prayers so God can hear your thoughts and desires so God can confirm the Ministries that you sit up under Hallelujah so God can show you that he's with you Hallelujah that's what Ministry is to me Ministry Hallelujah per se for me is not coming down showing you Hallelujah everything I know in the Bible they can do that in the Baptist Church Hallelujah but when we come together and we sit under the umbrella of the word hallelujah we should walk out of here knowing that we made a connection Hallelujah but I think sometimes Hallelujah can I step on this yes sir Hallelujah I want to make sure I ain't out of order Hallelujah cuz I'm very unconventional Hallelujah Church Hallelujah whether we realize it or not Hallelujah God does things Hallelujah to make us question if he's still God that's good Hallelujah come on now you say brother what do you mean in the proud of your life life paying tithes and serving God filled with the Holy Ghost you'll go through a trial that you have no answer for what is he doing he's bringing out a mystery that was there all along and the only way it's going to come out is if you continue to this is my this is my subject H if you continue to live life Hallelujah because a lot of times people get saved and they stop living because they want to make sure everything is in order they worried about this one watching and that one watching the dos and the don'ts and and the laws and the bylaws and all these things and they can't even enjoy life hallelujah what do you mean the life of redemption Hallelujah God has saved me I'm not on my way to hell I'm on my way to heaven so when we come to church there should be an atmosphere of joy amen yes sir because life is meant to be lived yes sir the scripture says if you try to save your life you'll lose it h if you give your life you'll get it back again H so which one are you doing hu that's good when we come to church we should be making a contact amen but what do you mean a contact H contact it applies two things a giving and a receiving H and most of the time we always want to be on the receiving end Hallelujah but no to make a contact Hallelujah you got to give out something also yes sir Hall and right now I'm on the giving end of the contact Hallelujah and you may be on the receiving end Hallelujah but then again if I'm looking through your eyes you may be on the giving end of it pulling Hallelujah on Amen so where are you in this relationship tonight Hallelujah are you making a contact H cuz we have to give and receive and receive and give to have a contact with Christ up in here if there's a true Spirit of the Lord in you you got to give me something [Applause] tonight Hallelujah because that's how God works God gives he receives God gives he SS and he reaps Hallelujah and when we have have a service when we come to church it should be two things going on that should be a contact being made from sewing and reaping Hallelujah giving and receiving Hallelujah and if you're not giving or receiving you're just here come on now and if you are just here you're not an expression of life because this wood is here these are here this carpet is here these lamps are here hallelujah and every else that has no life is here so that should be something different about us when we come together Under the Umbrella of the word of God but the turn of Life The Mystery of Life he told Abraham Hallelujah you pull I preach Hallelujah yes sir church he told Abraham he said at the appointed time what appointed time the appointed time time of life see God will speak a word and walk off and want you to live that's good PR on he'll speak a word and don't fulfill it that day don't fulfill it that week or that month or maybe that year but he still wants you to keep living because the only way you're going to get up to that promise is for you to keep living and believing what God has said Hallelujah the only way we're going to see God is if we keep walking hallelujah what did he tell Abraham he gave Abraham a promise of a seed of a child at the age of a hundred or whatever he was and then he told Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect good he said said walk before me sir and be thy perfect Hallelujah so if you want anything from God you got to make steps Hallelujah if you want anything from God hallelujah you have to Hallelujah become one with what he said to you amen we can't just sit back and expect God Hallelujah to do it all on his own without you being on one of those ends of the connection Hallelujah you like Brother D what are you talking about amen I'm trying to create an atmosphere in here tonight so right now I'm binding some Spirits Hallelujah Church the prophet of God will say what good is it for the minister the study Hallelujah lay with God and prepare and do all these things and get anointed and for the church not to be anointed so I need you just as much as you need me Hallelujah if we want to see God it has to be a group at fight Hallelujah he said you get out there you you label and you pray and you study and do all these things and you get out there and start preaching and you feel resentment ohy because there's things going on in your life and I'm trying to Hallelujah set your life free Hallelujah but resentment is in the way or you come in and you trying to preach a Word of Deliverance Hallelujah but you feel the spirit of bondage because people got things in their lives they haven't been delivered from let me say I was in Canada and about 15 minutes before service service started at 7:00 and we got to church church was packed all the power went out all the power went out no air condition no nothing this is in the middle of the summer and you know I was in a hotel room the Lord was dealing with me I kept hearing a voice you know within my spirit saying prophetic anointing prophetic anointing and I'm thinking yeah I know see it's it's a mystery to me now cuz I'm I never heard those two words together you know I've heard prophetic word hallelujah you know a prophetic word he's gave a prophetic word you know and now I'm hearing prophetic anointing and you know church I was sitting there and I thinking prophetic anointing and then I get to church all the power goes out and I had this all the stuff that I wanted to preach and I wanted to lay out and I couldn't use none of it Hallelujah cuz the lights was out so now I got the I got the freestyle that's good Hallelujah see sometimes life will make you freestyle brother you might have this laid out and that laid out and God will let you go down a path Hallelujah where it looks like there is no Direction but let me tell you something God is still in control when the lights go out God is still in control when you have no more power God is still in control so it's all right for the lights to go out sometimes that's just God showing you that he's with you adjust your attitude so you know we was in there and and and if if we sit still long enough when we get in those situations where Hallelujah God is producing patience Hallelujah you get in those situations where you want to react so fast if you sit still long enough you'll see God is in the midst and you know Church the lights didn't went out we got no power no nothing and the pastor he was like oh my what we going to do you know and I'm thinking you know I wanted to put this quote up I wanted to say this I wanted to say that and I'm like man now I can't do none of that and it forced me to go sit down and lean even more on God [Applause] and sometimes God will cut your lights out yes sir cuz he want you to lean a little bit more Hallelujah I'm not saying that you're not leaning but he want you to lean a little bit more Hallelujah and you know if you lean Hallelujah completely on him that mean he is your support system and now the lights go out Church what are the chances what are the chances the light go house and there's a brother in that church who works on generators the lights go out and he has both of his generators at church Hallelujah both of his trucks are are are mobile generators so what they did they took cars and plugged up into his church trucks just to get the lights back on Hallelujah but they got the lights back on but there was no AC no nothing in the middle of the summer so we started preaching we started having church church you can tell when God is in the building yes because when God is in the building your flesh goes out the window Hallelujah and I challenge you tonight if God is in the building you won't feel tired you won't feel lazy you won't feel disinterested but you'll get a charge from somewhere because you feel it's presence so good this brother while I was preaching a brother plugged up a fan and I wasn't hot even the pastor he say he was sitting there when he cut the fan on he was like I ain't got cut the fan off it's making too much noise see In God's Presence the mystery of life becomes so simple the things that you think you might need you really don't need to serve him Hallelujah and we had church and the anointing of God came down and the anointing was so prophetic God was doing things in people's life that they've been waiting to see Hallelujah parents and their children at the altar praying together rejoicing together worshiping together all because the Lights Went Out [Applause] GL but those who are in the flesh they look at at they saying man we ain't got no lights yes we did Jesus is the light of the world hallu yes church do you realize when the lights go out certain parts of your body react Hallelujah for more Hallelujah GL if we cut the lights out right now your peoples will get bigger come on cuz there's something about us that's not meant to stay in the [Applause] darkness but look God tells Abraham you're going to have a son you're going to have a child we know the story Abraham and Sarah they laugh and then Sarah tries to produce this life without God the mystery to be revealed will always be revealed Under the Umbrella of God's hands that's good and then church they get to the place where they be they just begin to live now I'm going to say some things that's going to be challenging for you because when we look at ourselves we look at ourselves as let's make sure we got all our ex's cross and our te's cross and dots and all these things and I'm a Christian come on come on come on remember that quote when a prophet of God said what made it a masterpiece that's so good bring it now it was the flaw hallelujah hallelujah it was the flaw that made that statue of Moses a masterpiece H cuz even with the flaw in it everything that was in Michelangelo's mind was still in front of him whoa boy that's heavy right there boy woo even with the flaw in the hu even with the flaw in the Statue it still revealed everything that was in the sculptor's mind so even with all your flaws you'll still reveal everything that God has in his mind concerning you yeah we make mistakes praise God hallelujah see it's the fla that shows I am a child of God the prophet of God said a righteous man is not a sinless man on on yeah I know you thought it was the other way around no uhuh he said a righteous man is not a sinless man he said what makes him righteous is that he's confessing the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said a righteous man does what falls seven times come on but he gets back up see that's the Mystery of Life falling down and getting back up to what complete what was started in God hallelujah but life is full of Cycles sir and you have to right now be able to catch the cycle you're in you know in the Book of Genesis when Joseph Hallelujah was when he made his way to the throne his life was a mystery a mystery of pain that's right but not reflected in his life everything he went through pain struggle pain struggle but when you saw Joseph you didn't see that that's right you saw a man that love God how could you see that cuz he kept living good preaching come on now and if you keep living your pain won't get the best of you if you keep living your struggle won't get the best of you all it can do is lead you right to your purpose and position in Christ hallelujah what started Joseph's Journey jealousy that's right you mean to tell me the mystery of his life being revealed started with hatred and jealousy you said no brother digs he had a dream that his sheep and their she and they was going to bow down no uhuh that wasn't the start of it that was just the dream the start of it was when they sold him into slavery yes sir that's right and then he had to live Hallelujah to catch up with what he dreamed [Applause] oh Hallelujah yeah and there are some things that are prophesied in this Bible there are some things that are prophesied in this message and it's time for you and I to catch up to it it's time to catch up to be that church Hallelujah without a spot blemish Oro hallelujah it's time for that church to catch up with the prophet of God was saying when she recognizes who she [Music] is she'll be an invincible Army Hallelujah good church good preach so we got the lights back on we had service of powerful service the week after that I went to South Africa first service lights go out again but that prophetic anointing was there too so what God was doing for me was telling me don't panic this is the way I get all eyes focused on me cuz you know when you have meetings you have joint services and you have things that you've done for years and years and you get in there sometimes it's just a traditional program and you know what starting to get on my nerves we have these annual meetings and things we've been having for years and years and nobody get closer to Christ people come in church with spirits in their life walk out with spirits in their life people come in church depressed walk out depressed people come in in church struggle walk out still struggling when are we going to get over the hump to where when demons get around us they get uncomfortable Hallelujah they get uncomfortable either they say hallelujah church we had a service and the power of God started falling down in the place Hallelujah those Hallelujah who didn't know God they started running out of the church because demons started manifesting wow that and that was just the mystery of life being revealed H there's something in you tonight and let me say it like this this word I'm preaching is going to bring it out it's going to bring it out Hallelujah in a way tonight to set you free or it's going to bring it out in a way to provoke you Hallelujah to challenge what I'm saying and Abraham and Sarah hallelujah how do they know the path of life and look church as they walked and as they live Hallelujah Abraham found himself doing things that the father Faith shouldn't have been doing all right that's good first things first Abraham gets out who knew God would call the father Faith with a Lyon spirit inside of them that's good but that had to be revealed so Abraham can go to the next stage so what God will do he'll let us go through things that things that may be weighed down inside of us that's still there connected to your sticky nature that trial will bring it out so you can move [Music] on Hallelujah don't feel bad Hallelujah God is using that to uncover a mystery of life hallah and God used that Hallelujah put Abraham in a position where he lied just so God could come in and stand beside him are you reading your Bible God didn't leave him when he told a lie God God came and defended him that was a part of the mystery how could God defend a Li it wasn't the LIE he was defending it was the promise he told him he was defending Hallelujah so as you walk and you live and you believe you might make mistakes but God will always stand beside his promise God will always come and defend his promise so if you make mistakes Hallelujah don't stay there keep on stepping Keep On Walking keep on living I promise you God will do his part yes sir yes sir he he said God defeated a liar no God defeated his word and then he goes to the king he says Hey give her back to Abraham and you go to let my Lyon Prophet pray for you see God has a way of doing things that's why we have to adjust the way we look at our trials and our tribulations Hallelujah because there's always something greater coming out of it Hallelujah because life is being revealed and you know Church from that point Abraham told a boldfaced lie you know why so he'd never have to do it again that's good once God uncovered it it was sitting way down there once God uncovered it Abraham never had time to lie again because God came in and showed Abraham I'm still here with you even in your faults even in your failures even in your error I'm still here with you so you don't have to lie just believe Hallelujah and what I'm saying tonight Church you don't have to run from God just continue to live and walk God will stand by your side if you believe Hallelujah and from that point Hallelujah God always showed up Hallelujah Abraham went out to fight three kings Hallelujah with 316 or 18 servants but it took him coming through a lie to get to that place where he could trust God prise God because all the way up to that place God gave oh my church listen to this God will give you a word and speak a word in your life knowing that in that moment you don't believe it boy that's heavy think about that sir church he gave promises to different ones in the scripture knowing that in that moment they were going to go through certain things that didn't make them look like believers they were going to go through things that were going to question whether they were Servants of God or not Hallelujah God his first reason for choosing David was a man at his very own heart but the cycle of Life led him to adultery that was in his path and that was something he had to overcome Hallelujah so God let him go down that path go down that way why just so he could conquer it and God lets us go down certain ways certain Avenues certain roads just so we could become conquerors amen no I'm not condoning sin Hallelujah the Bible says great is the mystery of [Music] godliness so getting to that point of perfection is a mystery getting to that point Hallelujah where the attributes of God is coming out of you it's a mystery what is it it's life being lived amen hallelujah but we have to understand the Cycles Hallelujah don't get nervous I ain't going to be too much longer that's good brother but we have to understand the cycles and how God do things look God will speak a word or give you a position knowing you ain't ready for it I ain't talking about position in the church I'm talking position in the word he'll give you a word pronounce it in your life knowing that you don't understand it you ain't ready for it yet you said BR d what what what you talking about he walks up to the disciples and what he's doing he's testing their life he walks up to them he says who do men say that I am he want to know what do they think about life he said who do men say the some say Jeremiah some say Isaiah or one of the prophets but then he says who do you say I am and Peter says Thou Are the Christ the son of the Living God and now Jesus is feend too speaking to his life he's going to uncover a mystery about Peter that none of the other disciples had ever heard before H he said Peter Flesh and Blood have not revealed Us in you but my Father which is in heaven and he says by this Hallelujah I'm going to build my church and then Christ comes down Hallelujah to give him Authority Hallelujah that he ain't even ready for he said whatsoever you shall bound on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loose in heaven do y'all understand Peter wasn't ready for that but God gave him that Authority you know how he got there he had to walk and do it said brother what do you mean remember Jesus told Peter now after he told him that Hallelujah scripture says and he gave him the keys to the kingdom he wasn't even ready for the Keys of the Kingdom but God had gave it to him I I I I hope I hope your hands are getting real itchy cuz I'm trying to give out some things that Christ has already given to us he's gave him position he gave him a word of authority that Peter could even believe yet he wasn't even ready yet but one thing about God once he speaking it can't come back once he giv it to you he can't take it back what it comes from your heart to his heart he can't take it back Hallelujah look how does Peter get there he has to walk into that Revelation he has to walk into that mystery being revealed but look church he God gave him all that spoke all that into his life and then he says to Peter Hallelujah Peter are you going to follow me yes Lord I'mma follow you every I'm do everything I'm going be with you all the time I believe this message ain't going no way Jesus say the co going to cry three times and you going to deny me oh man he went from I'm giving you the keys to the kingdom whatsoever listen to the listen listen to what he gave him he said whatsoever you bind is going to be bound whatsoever you loose is going to be loose and then he gets there Hallelujah and afraid to be identified with Christ when he already had the power to bind [Applause] unbelief well are you in your cycle are there things that you haven't possessed yet that Christ has given you already he told him I give you the power to bind and loose and and flesh and blood and revealers to you and they go to Peter say there go one El with Jesus he said no I wasn't right and you know what we'll say we'll say man if I was there boy I would have walk man please how they would have seen the power of God all on my life you know what I say if you was there you'd be doing exactly what you're doing right now in this service that's good Hallelujah GL Hallelujah good preaching Glory that's exactly what you'll be doing sir Hallelujah because this is just a different dwelling place with the same revelation with the same revelation of God hallelujah and what you're doing right now while the word of God is being preached will be the same thing you'll be doing on the shores of Galilee with Jesus walking the [Music] [Applause] shores you can't fool life amen life has to be lived in our church he gets there and he says I I know not the man that was once I thought he had the power to bind I thought he had the power to loose I thought he had the keys to the kingdom amen come on I thought he had the revelation of Jesus Christ that the church was being built upon but now Hallelujah he's having a struggle with being identified with what God said he is what a mystery yes sir oh my sometimes Hallelujah we question our walk with God that's right Lord why am I going through this I I thought I was a servant I thought I was your son and this and that you got to keep walking Hallelujah life is full of things that you have no answer for just keep walking it's up to God to make it clear hallelujah amen hallelujah it's not up to us to make it clear it's up to Christ to make it clear that's why we call him savior that's why we call him Lord that's why we call him healer Hallelujah if you're not healed tonight it's not up to you it's up to Christ you just have to keep walking keep living life but the key to it is you have to do it in Joy cuz m Ing and complaining or get you coming to that same spot for 40 years y'all think the journey in the wilderness they were just going over hills and mountains and going all over this place they were going in circles in their attitude they kept bypassing the exit get back to the exit again and they added UD still the same they get to the exit again the attitude still the same so God kept the exit closed up why because they wouldn't let the life be lived they wouldn't let it be revealed in Christ they're stuck on what they was in Egypt that's so good oh my that's so good oh my Hallelujah but God will speak things into our lives knowing we're not ready for it just so he can come and stand beside [Music] us oh my church that's what he did with Peter he told Peter the COO cck three times you going to deny me all that Peter said man no no Lord not me I'm with you I got the Revelation and then they start putting pressure on his life the journey started putting pressure on him h maybe some of us our family members putting pressure on us by the church we go to or what we believe and brandit and all this other foolishness and nonsense trying to put pressure on us but pressure is what lets you know that the baby is about to be delivered let's make sure we looking at it right Hallelujah I wonder how many of you sisters ever had a baby with no pressure and if you say amen I say we got some aliens in here brother we got some aliens in here you say brother why would you say that because if you can have a baby without any pressure you will break the scripture that's so good Hallelujah God say a woman got to have baby child birth in pain Hallelujah so that's a part of the mystery of life being revealed Hallelujah pain is a part of you being in God's will ohen Peter not even ready for what God pronouncing is like everybody all right he's not even ready for what God pronounced in his life and he comes and he says I know not the man then they come back to him again and say take go one there he said I know not the man and the third time they come they say yeah that's what there Peter say you you I told y'all come on he had to let Peter go through that to get that cussing demon out of him that's a good one that's a good one right I'm I'm going to say something going to shock you that cussing demon was in him when he was Healing The Sick that's right listen listen listen we going we going to go a little deeper that curing demon was in them when they was having communion right right all right that's right but it took him going down a certain path Hallelujah so God can reveal what's in his life oh my it wasn't to embarrass him it was to let him know where he was standing the Bible says that it's going to be a shocker but it's scripture the Bible says count it all joy when you fall into divers Temptation the Bible don't say slap yourself in the back of the head when you fall it say no count it all joy what is it what does that mean that mean that God loves you so much he won't let you continue in error but he'll let you fall so you can see where you at and get back up and not do it [Applause] again and listen Church Peter falls Peter curses everybody out denies the Lord and the scripture says and then he looked into the face of Jesus can you imagine God s you this and then you do this and then y'all have to look at each other wow you can't deny Christ is looking right at you and he told you you was going to do it but what is it it was for your good what did it do it made Peter realize where his life was it was time out for playing Church sir oh my where are those people hallelujah that when you come to church that there's such an expectation that the preacher can hardly stay on what he has in his notes where are those people who's been home listening to a message or studying something and then the preacher comes and confirms it where are those people who have prayers they've been praying about and then the pastor comes and starts to answer their prayer through the word of God where are those people hallelujah who had a song on their heart and then the song leader comes without any request and just sings that song where are those people who are tapped into the mystery of God's will hallu church that's what it should be when we come it should be a contact oh my look he speak things and know the people not even ready for it he told he said David is a man of the God's very own heart and let David path of Life take him through adultery and premeditated murder sir sir oh my I'm trying to encourage you cuz no doubt me preaching this right here somebody here going through something all right and I'm talking about some serious stuff yes sir some stuff that you not proud of some stuff that shouldn't be sitting on these PS right that's why it's so direct because God wants you to know it's time to clean it up Hallelujah and he wants you to know that that nasty stinking dirty thing that's in your life he's still standing beside you Hall the mystery of God's life being revealed look Church Hallelujah the only way for Jesus to come listen to me good the only way for Christ to come and be revealed it had to come through the line of a [Applause] prostitute the mystery of Christ being revealed first Hallelujah had to let a young girl leave a house and be led into prostitution young girl named Rahab her life was that way why so she could be put put in position to receive Israel when they came to receive the spies when they came she had to have the house on the wall come on nobody else can have that house but a [Applause]

military army leader house where did they go they went to the prostitute house Christ was revealed in [Applause] prostitution now now if you stuck on yourself you can't you can't rejoice in that you stuck on yourself you think you better than everybody else you can't rejoice in that that's right Hallelujah but you look Rahab had to go the way of prostitution U just to be in position Hallelujah

took a idol worshiper Hallelujah Ruth Hallelujah to marry that Boaz look where her life let look at the mystery of Ruth being reveal I can go on and on with this but I don't want to what I'm trying to say tonight we focus so much on the bad we don't even realize that Christ is in it if we go all the way back to the Garden of Eden and then I'm going to try to B bounce off us we go all the way back to the Garden of Eden you say man I was nothing but the devil the devil got in got his seed in and he messed up everything did he did he or was that the mystery of Christ being revealed Hallelujah you

plant life that's right you can't have plants without water and sand plants need what dirt right every seed needs dirt every promise in your life needs dirt it needs a foundation H but like I said before the dirt in our life is good dirt right amen hallelujah this the kind of dirt they build houses on this the kind of dirt they plant foundations on that's right Hallelujah but look Hallelujah mineral Kingdom makes room for plant life the plant kingdom Hallelujah the plant kingdom makes room for the animal kingdom Hallelujah because the animals eat the plants which the plants eat the minerals Hallelujah and then hallelujah the animal kingdoms make room for who us the human beings amen because we eat the animals and while we eat the animals we eat the plants and we drink the water Hallelujah all the kingdoms are survived in us hallelujah but then it don't stop there's another kingdom what is it the kingdom of [Applause] God W so it all Hallelujah is revealed in Christ every human every animal every plant even the water is identified in him he said said you drink of me you'll never thirst [Music] again he called him Hallelujah he's identified in every Kingdom In The Water Kingdom Hallelujah he says I am that Living Water oh my you go to the plant kingdom he says I'm the lily of the valley the rose of Sharon you go to the Animal Kingdom he says I'm the lion of the tribe of Judah hallah he says I'm the dove I'm Jehovah eagle [Applause] you go to the human Kingdom he says when you see me you see the father [Applause] hallelujah oh my and then when you go to the Godlike Kingdom he says let us make man how in our image in our likeness everything about this world is revealed where in the mystery of life amen and you are that mystery revealed woo oh my oh my church let's not be discouraged but let's be glad about what God is doing church I want you to understand pain struggle brings out who you really are and it may happen at an unexpected time or unexpected moment where you ain't even ready for it and it just happens why because God is bringing out who you really are look Church job wasn't ready for it it was just a bet it was a bet between God and Satan Hallelujah but then once he got in it the mystery of who he was started to be revealed Hallelujah he's going through a hard trial lost his money lost his cattle lost his family his wife saying his breath don't smell good all these things he wasn't expecting none of that but then when they asked job what's going on job said blessed be the name of the Lord wo what was the church he kept living oh my and then he started pointing out his trials he started putting his trials in a good light instead of a bad light he told his wife he said hey do you expect to see all good and no evil at the hand of the Lord oh my the more the trial went on the more the mystery of his life came out sure and that's what it should be for you guys that's what it should be for us the more we test it the more we try the more we come into the image of Christ but don't be afraid to keep living I know it's probably been what about a year since I've been up here maybe about a year it's a lot didn't happen since then I have a grandson turning one next week and I'm seeing so much in him I'm seeing how at first he could only recognize his mother's voice you know he was comfortable with her voice right you know because they had such a connection when he was in the womb what was that connection love Hallelujah see the connection of conception should be based upon love not the physical touch it should be upon love Hallelujah because when that woman begins to carry that baby she's carrying a token of love so she can adjust to all the pains she can adjust to how everything Hallelujah makes her walk different and what she has to eat different all everything she does different why because she loves what's being develop inside talk to me sisters Hallelujah but then Hallelujah there Comes A Time Hallelujah where what's inside begins to inflict pain W oh my if you don't give it what it want it'll start to kick inside the womb when it's hungry it'll start to kick if you feeding the wrong thing it'll spit it all back up Hallelujah Church what are you saying brother digs that life inside of you you have to give it what it wants I'm talking about the Life of Christ now you have to give it what it wants because if you don't you're going to be sick down here living life but then it comes a time n months later where the baby is ready to be revealed and develop Hallelujah and she goes through pains labor pains and then she delivers the baby only to never remember those pains again unless she's asked about it right sisters don't be talking about about that pain unless you ask them about it they don't look at their children and say man you had me in labor for n hours they don't do that till you make them mad they don't even remember the pain when they look at you all they just see is what's been delivered am amen The Joy Hallelujah of something Hallelujah coming from you my and then church this is this is the greatest stage not about to close but as you see that child that child I see my grandson he starts to crawl but you know our expectation crawling is all right we can't wait till he can walk cuz we know that's the potential of the child Hallelujah crawling is the stage Hallelujah but what we looking for is them steps but we have to let them crawl because crawling is what builds them up to have strength enough to stand up on his own so we have to let him crawl and I'm here to let you know God has to let us crawl Hallelujah because crawl is what makes us strong enough to stand up on our own and as that child gets strong enough crawling then it'll start pulling up on his own standing up and looking at you smiling what is he saying get everything out of my reach H Church natural types are spiritual once you start to stand up on your own then you can reach out and grab what you need Hallelujah the things of God that are in your reach now you can reach out and grab it you don't need no help Satan better get out your [Applause] way Hallelujah and he go through the house and he say put everything up high not even realizing that he's growing you going to have to put it up higher and higher and higher and higher that's why we go in church Satan wants these things to be out of our reach but we're growing Higher and Higher and Higher and Higher and if I can't reach it naturally I'll stand up on something Hallelujah yes sir and if I can't do it by myself I get somebody to help meall yes sir oh but then it's going to come a day H I'm about to close when you see that child just all by himself standing up and it's become so natural to him he's not even realizing that he's standing up on his own and like some of us you look at that child and you catch him standing up and he say hey boy come here boy ain't ready yet but got all the potential to do it h so what do you do you keep encouraging him to walk hallelujah hallelujah what God does he grabs Us by the hand and he walks us out there to it Hallelujah let you know you ain't by yourself come on let's do this together Hallelujah he rocks you out Kayla walks you right out there to it Hallelujah and let you know you are more than able to do it but what happens Hallelujah when that child falls down what do you do you pick them back up and you say do it again hallelujah it's the falling down that gives that child [Applause] confidence come on musicians I'm closing it's the falling Downs in life that gives us confidence to trust God yeah the scripture we read is there anything too hard for God in my closing I get to think about the butterfly the caterpillar rather in the early stages of his life cycle it crawls everywhere it goes it even looks ridiculous you look at the calip you be like poor thing right but that's the stage of life it's in that's right it looks like such a struggle it looks like it's such a struggle but that's the stage it's in it it would much rather go around some things but it has to crawl over it it wouldn't even want to touch it but it has to touch it that's the only way it can get there and some of you are in a caterpillar stage you wish you didn't have to touch it but you got to touch it you wish you could go around it but you got to go through it because that's the stage and you're just so tired of touching it you're just so tired of coming into it but keep living Hallelujah because what you don't realize Hallelujah you know what I don't believe this just me I don't believe that that caterpillar has an expectation for a cocoon come on it just lives Hallelujah and then there's a time and a season where it comes into a change and it looks very ugly Hallelujah this change is very ugly but something is happening inside W Hallelujah something is happening inside that trial of Life something is happening Hallelujah that's going to project what Grace W Hallelujah and it lays in that cocoon for a certain amount of time what got it into that cocoon its own struggles the struggles of Life got into the Cocoon and now in the Cocoon what is it doing to that cocoon it's going through a mystery that is so good yes sir nobody can see the colors nobody can see the wings nobody can see the development in it Hallelujah everything is hidden and revealed in that ugly filthy cocoon and we looking at I don't I don't know if they bride they might they might be sery look what they did they just in something so filthy and nasty hold on hold on there's something going to come out of that hold on God is up to something hold on church then next thing you know you see a crack of a wing come out pushing out of that field H then you see another one kind of push out of the field they think know something beautiful buses out Hallelujah and it never lives life like that again Hallelujah Now everywhere it goes Hallelujah it flies everywhere it goes what is it reflecting it's reflecting Grace everywhere it goes it's reflecting Grace it's reflecting the change of life and that's what we want we want Hall the mystery of Grace to be revealed in our lives Hallelujah no we don't have all the answers but just keep living amen keep living God will make sense out of it trust me I've lived in the world and the world doesn't even compare not even in the same sentence not even in the same category as living for Christ Hallelujah ask your pastor he got a testimony hallelujah hallelujah we we wasn't born butterflies we had to crawl into this thing that's right Hallelujah we had to get ugly Hallelujah but but but but if I could boast on Christ look at me now oh my Look at me now every praise is to our God every Hallelujah to our god hallu oh my let's pray let's pray let's pray hallelujah praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah Lord we love you and we thank you Jesus for all your goodness all your mercy Lord and we pray father you would just bless the
