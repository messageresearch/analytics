Father I know I don't have to look beyond my own life what looked like to be impossible and what was things that uh others could look at and say well Sam because that's what they they knew me as oh this is just a time this is just just a season but you know when you meet God face to face it was no longer just a season right it changed amen the desires the nature on the inside changed once we meet God fully in that way just full surrender just fully surrendering then he fully comes in and there's a difference it's not us making a difference it's god making a difference and I'll just say it like this that I can just remember when I looked at my life and I thought my all the times that I tried all the times that I failed and that was standing right before me but I'm so thankful that in that moment God's grace swept down and it's to accept what he did it's to accept what he did at Calvary and that Calvary calvary's not a stop stopping point Calvary is a way that's been opened that we can walk into that place with him where we could not get to God God came to where we were yeah and he he made a way as Paul said in the book of Hebrews he he made a way and Calvary made a way oh my I'm so thankful for Calvary aren't you amen Calvary made a way for us for us to have our Calvary our death to self a real dying that Christ might be born in our lives amen don't you love him tonight my it's just such a joy to serve him a't it amen God bless you amen it's so good to be here in the house of the Lord and and we certainly welcome our visitors uh Alberto is that correct all right see you and uh Ella am I right okay all right it's good to have you as well well good to have all you home folks visiting with us tonight and and uh my goodness how do I uh col I was going to say c i i i knew when I walked in i' seen you up here it's good to have Colton here with us and honestly I don't know how I forgot his name because I Call On Him enough in the youth meetings and so so good to have each of you here amen so good to be in the house of the Lord in it amen I know um we're just so so thankful for God's mercy if you hadn't heard the news uh we brother joshu and sister Sharon they welcome their little boy little Stephen and so we're thankful for that and uh just want to ask you just to continue to keep them in prayer they're doing well uh they're doing very well so really keep them in prayer also I think the prayer request that was uh made mention here regarding uh sister Carmen sister Irma's Father which would be brother Carlos's father-in-law um he's in the hospital he's not doing well and um he needs a real touch from the Lord uh I was asking Brother Carlos you know uh where everything stands as far as even when in his life and he said he's he's given his life to the Lord and so we are thankful for that and um they've given right now he just had got a call and that's probably why he's not here he just had got a call they've only given him uh 24 hours now the thing of it is is that that's all the doctors know and so we just want to be in prayer and we know that nothing's impossible with the Lord remember like we preached on Sunday where it looks like there's no hope that's when God steps in God all the way through the script scriptures all the way through the scriptures God is one who comes and breathes hope into these situ an expectation why because of God because of him amen let's just let's go before the Lord in prayer tonight amen heavenly father there are no doubt Lord there's requests and needs upon every heart Lord but father as we come Lord before your throne Lord Jesus we come Lord with with the Thanksgiving in our heart that Lord that you have made a way father and we're coming Lord before the throne of grace Lord once again this evening Lord we're asking for Mercy we're asking for Grace Lord in these moments Lord you see the need Lord that is there father brother Carlos's father-in-law and sister man sister Carmen Lord their father Lord Jesus age is nothing to you Lord there's no situation that's beyond you father so Lord we're just asking Lord For Your Divine Touch oh God in his body father Lord we know that God there's a a settl that comes Lord in our hearts that when we can know Lord where one Lord has made their peace with you but Lord I know the desire Lord is that they would remain here with us Lord and we just Lord we understand that Lord I think as I stood there just the other day Lord and just Lord just just talking of those things knowing Lord what that means as their father now Lord Jesus we just ask Lord that you would just move on the scene Lord we know Lord that we're always Lord in the Divine will of God when we are praying and asking for healing because Lord whether that healing is in this Dimension or the next Lord we have an assurance Lord your word word never fails Lord because you cannot fail Lord so we're standing Lord upon that word and we ask God for your Divine Touch and strength Lord in his body and I pray God that your presence Lord would just be so evident in the room and may you Lord just move Lord for the family as well even in this time Lord that oh God such a a peace and a looking to you father I pray Lord dear God we thank thank you Lord also for the report Lord of brother joshu way and sister Sharon Lord and the welcoming Lord of little Steven and we just

every request Lord I know there's it's already been lifted up before Lord but we just ask that Lord once again again that you would come by our way and speak to our hearts Lord you know the needs Lord that are setting here Lord before us tonight and father you're more than enough Lord you're more than able Lord to minister Lord to the hearts Lord may you come Lord Jesus and help us Lord together to step aside and speak to our hearts Lord in a personal way minister to every need now Lord we just commit Lord this service Lord into your hands father we pray in Jesus name amen and amen amen God bless you thank you musicians if you would turn in your Bibles with me I'm going to just read a verse of scripture here and then we'll allow you to be seated and I want to the Lord will help us tonight I'd like to speak to you on a thought we've been dealing with this on the on the mind and you know we were looking at that part in in job where Satan was really U making job think that it was God who was putting all of this on him it was God that was doing it and yet it was really only God permitting it but it was Satan doing it numbers of a lot of scriptures where job speaks of what he's actually uh believing at that moment but remember the prophet said as long as job as he could make job think that way he had him whipped yeah and so when we're looking at this we understand that remember Peter would take and write in the scriptures very familiar scriptures as Believers uh we take these scriptures and we are strengthened and encouraged when we go through tests and trials and frankly with tests and trials you're either in one coming out of one or heading into one it's it's one or the other because this is part of our molding grounds while we're here and uh I don't mean to be the the trumpeter of good news or bad news but but it's it's true those are the molding places that God permits to take our way and this is why that Peter would write beloved think it not strange when that fiery trial has come to try because sometimes we think my you know it seems like you're blindsided where did this come from and where where did this but remember the prophet also told us in Victory Day He said when God gives you a trial that's showing he's got confidence in you so good you know we we many times put the confidence out here in well if God allowed me to walk on water and if God allowed me to pray for the sick and all those things have their part and they have their place but when God permits a trial to come your way that's God's sign of confidence oh my see if we can just Lord let that just let it drop down to the fifth rib but I I mean just Let It Drop there you know amen let's read this first verse of scripture 1 Peter chap 1:13 Peter said wherefore gird up the loins of your mind I'm sorry I didn't give you a chance to turn to it two services in a row bad habit wherefore gird up the loins of your mind now notice this is not something that God's going to do do for us but we have access and God equips us to be able to G our minds with the right things wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just speak here for a few moments on overcoming in the Battlefield of the Mind overcoming in the Battlefield of the Mind I certainly believe that we're we're Overcomers we're not survivors but we are called to be Overcomers and in order to be an overcomer we've got to be have battles that are faced that we Face things that are before us it's kind of like a testimony you can't have a testimony unless there's been a battle but you know a testimony itself is that result of of a battle that is taken place and a victory that has been won and notice how that Peter would write of this and this phrase you find it throughout the scriptures of giring up thy loins and Peter would write of it in terms of the mind and the whole point within this is when we and ourselves our mind we you know we' have to go back and to think of how that the the Bible is written it's an Eastern book and it's written in this term where you'll find gird up the loins you'll find that giring because they wore they wore the long garment and that long garment was it had to be where they would take the Garment there from the back and the the men they would take it and they had a belt or a GLE here and they would pull that up that that part they would pull from behind and so that it would their way would not be impeded or hindered in order to be ready to move it was a place to where they can actually you're in a place of of strength because uh of where that the source of strength you know how it is even in your uh with your hips and things like that there's so many things that you and I we depend on with our hips and you sometimes you don't think of it after so long of a time but if you start getting a little trouble in your hips or something but that's a real source of strength that is there within even in your body and how that they would be admonished to take this like when in AA would tell Gesa take my staff G thyself and run and take the staff to the baby you would find that each one of these times it was to remove any hindrances that would be in the way remember when they were to eat the the Passover there in the in Exodus 12 it said they were to eat it with their feet shoden with a staff in the hand and with themselves being girded ready to go at a moment's notice and you know in this time and an hour we're living in the scripture would speak of it in Ephesians 6:14 just one part there of our armor it would tell us how to stand with this armor on having your loins gir about with truth so this is this is the giring that we we want we want our loins gird about with truth this is a place to where that if you can think of it in this way that that first every thought itself it can be in like a seed I I don't know about you but there's there's places that even when I look around my flower bed there at the house there's areas where I have had to deal with certain weeds and I don't know where they come from I honestly I didn't plant those weeds there but there's other parts of the house I never have to worry about those weeds but it's in certain areas you know and then and then there's times where you have what always Marvels me and and just please bear with me a moment on this what always Marvels me is how that that they're they're can be a weed that's growing and it will actually be a weed that when its leaves actually look like the plant that it's growing in I've marveled at that how that we have a weed and it's growing right in the midst of a hydran I have to look I'm looking at that leaf and I'm saying that doesn't that that doesn't look like the rest of the leaves but you know just in passing they don't catch it sometimes it's went for a period of time and finally I'm pulling that weed up and it's went like this it's this tall it's but it's something because you don't notice it because of how that it Blends in if it was something so obvious and there are weeds that are very obvious but you see Satan doesn't come to attack us on the obvious things Satan wants to just sometimes just have a little seed all it can take is it can be blown through in the wind and then we take that seed and if you begin to take that seed in and just to dwell on that seed it begins to give it the nourishment that's needed and you'll find it begins to affect even the way that you will look at things and the way that even that you will conduct yourself just stay with me here this is why that even when you think about let me just let me just stop here for a moment when you think of it in this time remember when the prophet was standing right up there and here was his little little baby and here she was she she was she was passing and and there you know there was his wife you know and where she had passed remember brother Bram tells this and he tells in a few places especially in 1965 and I want you to listen very carefully he says here I was standing there and Satan he said about that time came right up next to me and he said huh and that's how he's going to do you look what you've done when you came in you Ste you slept in your work clothes in the chair you went and prayed for the sick and he said uh you know know and how they were healed God healed them and he began to go through a whole list of things and this is what I want you to catch the prophet said everything that he was saying was true you see where that's at the Gate of reasoning reasoning is a gate of judgment are you with me yeah see Satan see listen even within things within even how that comes remember how Nathan remember when David was in his wrong in his error Nathan never just bust in the door and said hey you were with basba he didn't do that you know what he did he came in that service he took his text and he began to stir up that gate of judgment and he got it to a place to where when David said that man is guilty finally Nathan stepped back and said you're the man see what happened the the gate came open God even says in his word come let us reason together reasoning is fine as long as it's with God's word but once it is against the word of God we turn it down God's word is above every other word heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away let God's word be truth and every man's word be a lie so if there's anything that comes in your mind that wants to exalt itself above the word of God cast it down I don't care if he's coming and he's wanting to point out your faults you hang to the word of God and you stand upon the word because as a Believer you've got grounds to stand on yes sir Hallelujah I just read here here just just here the other day brother BR was talking in the message having conferences he said there was a man he said here he what he said he would get saved and he said all of a sudden he said he get out here he said the devil start working on his mind and he said and he said he would go back and forth with the devil well I know I'm saved and and I know that and he said finally he said that old man he said he got tired of all that and he said I'm going to tell you what I'm going to do he said I'm going to get an old knob and I'm going to drill it right here in the ground because I have met God's requirements I am saved and anytime devil this is what he said anytime devil you ever come back to me and say that I'm not saved I'm going to point you to this knob in the ground when you tell me the Holy Ghost is not for me I'm going to point you to this knob in the ground when you tell me healing is not for me I'm going to point you to this knob in the ground let me tell you something God gives you a place where you can point to his grace touching your life and you operate from that Grace where God has begin to deal with your life and you know what it does it doesn't get weaker it only gets stronger you know why you're feeding your experience Lord hallelujah having our loins G about with truth remember brother brah said everything he was saying was the truth and finally brother Braham said it like this I want you to think of this these words had come in through the gate of reasoning and it come down through there and the prophet said I was about ready to say if that's how he's going to be you see it was made it in the mind had come into the Mind here and where that here in the gates of reasoning but he said there was something that rose up from the inside and said though he slay me yet I'll serve him and that wasn't that wasn't brother brandom as far as to point him to him and his strength his strength Came From Within when he was at a point of of breaking yet the word you cannot deceive the word the word spoke in that moment this is why David could say in Psalms 27 the Lord is the strength of my life I don't have to ask you but there's all through here that there's times that you have felt like uh you just felt like what's the use and and just giving in but there is a strength that keeps pressing you onward that's strength is not you I don't care how Resolute you are as a family you have no glory in this at all it is God's glory in your life it's God who gives us the courage to press on Hallelujah notice in this time in this day like the prophet would say it in this way and I just want to refer to a few of these places before I go further in diving into this but just just to listen here just for a moment I I don't have these up there I want you just to listen to them brother BR said in a day brother when there's all kinds of isms and fanaticism it's time to G yourself with the truth and Jesus said I am the truth and it says you got to know where you're standing and you have to know as you know where you're standing you've got the whole armor buckled on it's gir about buckled down good and tight and pulled down with the truth of God's word anchored in your heart all devils in hell can't upset you then you're able to go meet Satan and say it's written and Satan can say oh did you take up servants no sir but I believe Jesus Christ uh did you do this stand no sir but I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost Buckle it about and GED with truth oh that's in Redemption by power brother Bram said that big belt and and you know I don't have a picture of the Armament here but it's a big belt that will hold everything together if that belt gets loose then everything can start sagging on that armor but the belt's got to stay tightened up are you hearing me it's got to stay tightened up and sometimes the belt gets loose and you got to reach down and tighten up that right watch this brother Bram is talking about and he says you notice when you begin to feel like you're slacking or the devil says it's no use reach down and tighten up the belt a little bit pull up the sword a little tighter in the hand and go forward like that be ready for the March so you know there's times when we're going to feel like we're slacking and the devil says it's no use that's the time to reach down and tighten up the Buckle that's the time now listen we got all we got a lot of things all around us we got a lot of things that would like to try to fill our mind but let me just say this to you it is your responsibility and my responsibility as what we feel and place in our minds now watch this in the scripture we read for our text wherefore G up the loins of your mind and be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ now you know that before there can ever be any battle that's actually put in Array we want to talk about this Battleground a moment this battleground of where actually forces will meet one another is what they call No Man's Land and greatest battle ever fought brother B says there has to be a place selected there's a mutual ground a no man's land that they fight here at this place they they just don't one fight over here and one down here and one run over there there's a Battlefront where they meet and test their powers and where each Army tests its strength against the other Army and mutual meeting place now he says when the great battle started on Earth there had to be a mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and that Battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for the place of the battle where it was begin and that is because that decisions are made from the mind and from the head it's a Battleground now watch this he says the Battlegrounds where you've got to meet your enemy is in the mind you've got to make your choice it meets you in paragraph 70 he said decisions are made in the mind the head there is where Satan meets you and the decisions are because that God made a man that way see there's a way God God made us that way remember when he when when when he came when Gabriel came with that announcement to Mary the Bible said she cast in her mind what manner of saying this was and remember the first thing that that remember the angel Discerning that and it begins to point her to the scriptures to do what he begins to settle her mind praise God are you hearing me now because you see what happened when he points to settle her mind it brings her to a place to where she's now opening to the word that's coming to her it's not that she didn't believe Isaiah 9:6 Isaiah 7:14 she did but you see when the word itself was beginning to point and say you are what the word was talking about then in her mind she's Tre troubled what's going on here but the word listen this is the power of the word it comes to change the atmosphere it comes to change the situation it is the spirit of God just like Genesis 1 he brewed over the Earth to change the conditions thank when Satan came to Eve what did he have to do first get her to open her mind before the ACT took place it had to be received in the mind oh my this is why even with we talk of the new birth the new birth is not bypassing the mind but it's receiving the word in our mind and we're receiving that word that has the authority and The Power Within it to drop down and change our lives completely it's a bomb when it drops down it'll clear everything out when we can just say Lord be it unto me oh Lord I give my life to you Lord take anything out Lord that's unlike you I just want to serve you Lord with all my heart with all my life Lord cutting everything out Lord and the word will do that 1 Peter 4:1 for then for as much then as Christ ha suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that hath suffered In the Flesh hath ceased from sin then he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lust of men but to the will of God Amen so the mind that we that Peter is writing of here is talking about the mind of Christ talking about God's own life this is how this is how we fight our battles this is how that we approach everything let it be passed through the mind of Christ we want to arm ourselves with that mind arm ourselves with that life that word in our life that's what we want we don't want it just in our knowledge we want it in the midst of our life where we're living from that realm and listen friends there's things that we come to that we maybe don't have exact ly the answer to situations can come and they can take us by surprise but let me just tell you there's nothing that takes God by surprise but it's up to you and I to bring every thought in subjection to The Obedience of Christ and give no way allow the devil to give no excuse no reason of why that this could be remember we are sheep you've got rights but if you're a sheep you'll forfeit your rights right we've got rights to a lot of things but remember when we as Lambs we are willing to lay our rights down for him brother BR says in Satan's Eden he said I want to speak to you on something or bring something to Enlighten you to the promise of God for this age he said something not something that somebody else was in some other day but them things are all right but we all refer to those things but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with the scriptures that's written here that would en lighten you to know make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you did you catch that block it before it gets to you so it's coming at you but you want to be able to block it well how do you block it you block it with a word when a man is going to fight he wants a sparring partner that is going to fight like the man he's going to fight and so this is why God lays his word in sometimes we can set right here are you hearing me now we can set right here and we can think my you know that's wonderful and that's tremendous and sometimes we can look and you know but God's what God's wanting to do is that word to come down in our life and come to a place of application because there's going to be situations that come that that cause us to come to a place of applying the word of God in our lives it comes to that the word must be applied the word was meant to be live now so we want to keep those punches off of us we want to learn the tactics of the enemy he says that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can amen so if he wants to that yeah a punch is going to come as far as to connect with you but you've got to have something in there where there's a strength to get back up it's a strength to keep on to keep pressing on but the main thing is is steady to keep the punches off of us now watch this when we think of it when you think of this message that brother BR preaches in Satan's Eden he deals with the reasonings and how that you know intellectual gospel where you know he says how that you know how he talks about how that a man you know had had a particular um aori him before him and the man he said when his crowd came out he said that man's crowd he said oh my they were you know just dressed to the nines and my just intellectual just I mean great you know theologians and things and he said when my crowd begin to come in of where the those who were coming to the meetings where brother Brandon was ministering he said you had people on Cs and stretchers and you know they didn't look like much or anything else he said they came and they sat down and he said but God be to move on the scene and to touch lives and heal lives begin to restore you see you see what the difference is the word was meant to minister to every part of man this word never came to massage our mind it never came to uplift an ego but the word of God itself came to uplift that part that God knew before the foundation of the world that you and I were Sons and Daughters of God you and I may not have ever come in in a wheelchair in our CAU but spiritually we were bound we were wrecks we were miserable we needed a living God we needed something more than just religion we needed something more than church we needed the Lord Jesus Christ we needed a living God a living God who makes himself real we needed God in a real way sir in that same message Satan's eaten brother Bram also takes up that point where he says I understand around here I hope you're I hope you're with me I'm talking about how we GD our loins about with truth it's knowing where we're standing brother BR says I I understand he said around here he says it's being said 1965 Satan's Eden why doesn't brother Brandon preach on the Holy Ghost that's always been a quote on Marvel of thought find one service where he doesn't see what it was it was the age it was an overlapping it was looking back to isus of Pentecost and here you had the word being delivered isusa was not the restoration no that was gifts coming back but the restoration was back to the word himself the promise that the son of man Christ in his fullness would return once again is that right understand brother Brown he's not he's not preaching on the on on the Holy Ghost brother Brown says oh he says here's the answer he says here's what it is he said the Holy Ghost is the person of Christ in you that's Quicken to every word for this age don't watch it he said so much in demonstration watch it in action right are you hearing me there can be a lot of demonstrations in the house of God but what matters is the action That Goes Forth even on the outside are you hearing me see it's taking it back to the word because the word itself will always be the word the word will always act like the word the word will always behave according to the word oh my I love that this is keeping the punches off of us now notice in Romans 6:7 for he that is dead is freed from sin that's that's so important he that is dead is freed from sin now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death hath no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once but in that he liveth he liveth unto God likewise reckon now Paul wasn't a southerner this is the word likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto God through Jesus Christ Our Lord that word reckon this is what it is it's a word that deals with reality if I and I don't know how to pronounce that word reckon that my bank account has $25 in it it has $25 in it otherwise I'm deceiving myself this word refers to facts not suppositions likewise reckon yourself in other words think this is exactly what God has made away for me let me tell you something he does not have to go back to Calvary to pay for one sin or one failure he doesn't have to take one more strip to heal somebody else he said I'm the Lord that for for us all th iniquities I'm the Lord that heal us all thy diseases he did it once and for all and you and I are beneficiaries of that work at Calvary it's not what you're looking at you're looking at the lamb it's to believe what he has done for me and I accept that and I walk according to that that's Reckoning Yourself Dead your your thoughts it comes into your life and this is how you think I am a Christian I am a believer I am filled with the Holy Ghost I am a Son of God I am a daughter of God Amen yes sir Hallelujah not about whether you're worthy or not you never could be worthy he has made me worthy I'm talking about how we're overcoming in the Battlefield of the Mind oh I need to get good enough to receive the Holy Ghost you'll never get good enough it's except God's word and say Lord the promises for me I Lay My Life down on the line Lord I give my all I surrender everything anything Lord that you see that's in the way Lord remove it out of the way I don't want anything in the way between you and me you rent The Veil and two I don't want any veils in my life Lord hallelujah you're approaching as a Son of God as is a daughter of God verse 12 very very important scripture you see Romans six I love the book of Romans I love all the Bible I guess I can't say one but you know Romans six is a real sanctification chapter but sanctification doesn't end with sanctification sanctification goes on are you hearing me so this is not a chapter we cross out of and we we never go back into it the very next chapter is the chapter that I read to you last week out of Romans 7 where Paul said when I would go to do good evil is present is that right so watch this this this is just this is application in verse 12 let not sin what is sin unbelief what is unbelief anything that's against God's word hallelujah now the devil can say well you know it isn't that God's Not A Healer but he's not your healer he's a liar because let let me tell you something you did not read in the scripture where it just had a list of names and you had to try to find your names he he included it all in there I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases by his traps we were healed I'm part of that we my name is in that we amen it I was the reason that he came from glory and came down and paid the price I was the reason brother Roco he got up on that Easter morning I am that reason Hall yes Hallelujah let not unbelief anything contrary rain in your mortal body you know what something is this word to rain it means be it's basilio which means to exercise like a kingly approach I don't feel like this and then all of a sudden the actions start going down we start listening to that and we get down I I don't feel like I'm saved I I don't feel like much of a Christian let me tell you something God God wants to build and his desire is to stabilize every life and every heart amen are you hearing me that's God's desire then you know what the only way that'll ever be EST established is by the word of God it's the word of God that builds your life up listen I'm not reading something off the back of a cough sir I'm telling you the word of God that I've experienced in my own life it takes the word to build your life up Hallelujah this is why why do you think Satan wants to try to feel your mind with so many other things we can get the feeling comfortable in our walk with God and we begin to get so close so many other things are gathered around in our mind that we think on WE dwell on and eventually we start talking about see this is why the scripture said this is our charge gir up the loin of your mind gir your loins about with truth that's our charge Hallelujah yes sir neither now what why don't rain don't let it rain in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace amen questions and answers part four if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be overcome or got rid of you ready for this deep one take the very vice versa from it because the devil's a liar that's good if the devil makes you think you know if you know you're a Christian and he tries to make you think you're not a Christian just take the Versa and say I am a Christian as long as your experience matches in God's word say I'm a Christian and anything else the same way that's great yeah good goes on down in paragraph 69 same same quote God grant you're overcoming ever who you are may your thoughts just go right back the other side and say I am a Christian I am a believer Satan you have no hold on me now watch this brother BR the very next quote says frankly I'm standing here right now saying the same thing to keep from fainting right here at the pull pit I've almost fainted four or five times I've almost pitched over the pull pit that's the truth God knows that's right now he wasn't getting ready to pitch over because he didn't think he was a Christian he's talking how Satan is battling him even in his mind in his body he's feeling the weakness within his body and he's standing at his post of Duty and Satan is there attacking him and he's getting ready feels like to pitch over four or five times and he said I'm having to take the exact opposite of it you see it applies to every part in every phase of our life when Satan you know one of the ways that you always know that it's Satan that's talking is you can always tell when he comes it never comes with encouragement it never comes in a way to point you to Calvary he don't want you to see Calvary are you hearing me he don't want you to see that there is a way back he do not he does not want you to see that there is one who is standing on your behalf but you know what when the spirit of God will come and tell us we're wrong there's something on the inside that rises up we're pointed to Calvary and because the word of God is hidden within our hearts by the new birth there's a desire that rises up and saying Thank You Lord God for your mercy there's a repentance that goes out of our heart forgive me Lord for my wrong Lord is that right thank God for that thank God for that convicting power there on the inside that'll convict us when we're wrong but Satan when he comes he can take a hold of the same quotes same scripture but you'll always feel an oppressive condemning pressure and spirit behind it because Satan cannot offer you any atonement is that right and the other part the brother Brown lays it down so clearly when your experience matches God's word you're able to stand right there and say I am a Christian matches it by what that you hit seven days out of seven no but that your life itself on the inside my desires is for him that's so he is my all in allwe hallu oh my brother brandom you know and he's asked even another Place talking about overcoming remember brother R would tell us on overcoming you've got to recognize the devil and every one of his tricks not just that well the devil that's just some bad thought no the Devil is a is a is a real being just as much as the Holy Spirit when it said when he the spirit of Truth has come it's a real being a holy spirit is a real being it's the person of Christ so where thoughts themselves I know I've said this to you many times but thoughts themselves are not just random things that just come flying by our away it's Spirits that's trying to get at us that's what it is it's Satan wanting to get at us he's one to one to try to th and hinder you realize this is why Satan knew what was coming on the road to Abraham and Sarah's tent who do you think stirred up that fight in the tent that morning come on friends who do you think stirred that up when here they were fussing and and they had you know a good fuss but you know what they didn't know what was coming down the road but Satan was trying to get it stirred up so that they would miss their visitation is it no Marvel how Satan will try to get get to us right before service every time Saturday night Sunday morning Thursday Every Time come on now but for all you perfect ones I'll just fellowship with the rest for just a moment how Satan wants to try to get at everything and try to punch at everything you know why he's afraid of that word coming and being received in our lives cuz the word will expose him the word will cast him out oh my there's a real devil and then to recognize in order to overcome it you've got to recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one in you has already overcome him and by his grace you are more than a match for him There's real overcoming when you recognize you're able to look back across your life and you see not what I used to be are you hearing me I'm I'm telling you what the prophet said here this is how this is how you recognize you can look back and realize hey I'm not what I used to be there's no condemnation in my life there's no opposition to the word of God the my my spirit and the spirit of God there is an agreement with the word of God then you're able to look back and when you can see that are you hearing me when you can see that then the prophet said then you realize you've overcome because how can you be defeated when the Overcomer is inside of you you've already overcome but so many times we get to looking at other things and to realize wait a minute who brought me where I'm at right here who changed my life who changed my desires who changed my nature who did this and you begin to Fellowship on the Overcomer and overcoming there's things no doubt that you and I come to you come to I come to things in your life right now that you're facing battling right and you know what you could have never faced it before it's just like when they go through brother Bram would liken it when they were doing the battle of the Civil War in this nation and brother BR would take it and how he would say it like this you know how did Grant take Richmond how did different ones take you know as they're going through a progression of a battle when you look at even when Joshua came into the promised land they didn't go and you know take this one and and then go over here but they there there was a taking of Jericho then it went to AI it just kept on unfolding all the way through because remember what Canaan represents it's a land of overcoming come on now it's a time of battle it's a time of War let me tell you something this is why Satan will try to come and he'll try to come right at you and try to talk you out of what God has already put in your life don't you lay your weapon down that's why the prophet could turn around said brother Nev don't you ever lay that weapon of the word down Satan will try to make you doubt your weapon your weapon is sufficient you might say I've been rebuking him all day keep cutting at him chop a hole through him it might be this small right now keep whing with that word I know what God did for me I know what God has done in my life you keep whacking at it the prophet said that's what Abraham did he said when that old gloomy Spirit came that he says it like this that gloomy spooky Spirit came around Abraham and wanted to try to taunt him he said Abraham took the sword he said he whacked it if it stayed there whacked it again again whacked it again he said he poked a hole poked a hole and eventually the hole got bigger sometimes we get tired we get weary yeah we get weary but remember listen to me your feelings are not your absolute I love to feel the Pres of God yeah I do but your feelings are not your absolute your absolute is the word of God am there'll be times in your life when you're walking remember the prophet said it like this he said when I was a young Christian he said Satan he said would beat me around the stump on my feelings he said he would you know come he said I'll tell you he said Till I finally learned he said it ain't based on my feelings it's based on the word of God that I have met God's requirements that's settled right this is this is the strength and as we're giring the loins of our mind as we come to these things this is how we take fears doubts there's things that we deal with of things that God brings us to deal with complexes fears we didn't even know was down in there that's true things that he brings us but you know what but remember God would does not in the business of overwhelming you and I he's in the business of displaying his overcoming power through our lives so the only way we can take these areas is as we come to them and as we come to them we take the word of God when one Rises its head we chop it off brother Ram tells a story about a man that he said you know he had a dream and the devil was a little bitty old thing and run up to him and and said you know it said boo and he jumped back and the devil got bigger boo he jumped back and the devil got bigger finally the devil got as big as he was was going to overcome him he know he had to fight with something so he looked around and he couldn't find nothing to fight with kind of sounds like Samson sounds like shamgar Hallelujah he just picked up the Bible and he and the devil said boo he said boo right back notice he picked up the Bible and the devil said boo he said boo back and the devil got little and little and little and finally he beat him to death with the word notice he picked up the Bible yes sir and he began to boo back to the devil you know what that symbolize that ain't you holding on to this leather or imitation letter it's you taking a hold of the word and standing in there on the word regardless of how you feel regardless of any other thought it's casting down every imagination and holding God's word to be the truth and say Boo devil these are my promises boo devil take a hold of that word and stand there Toe to Toe with Him Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah you know what the word puts him down to size for what he really is hallelujah this is where the scripture says in Ephesians 4:27 neither give place to the devil that means don't give him don't give him any place it'd be like you know if we appear on the platform somebody said hey you know what we'd like to bring bring a a fish tank and put it up here sorry no we' like to just put one right here we can we can put one right here we put a fish tank right here sorry you're not going to put one right here but but it's an empty space it's sitting for fish tanks you're not going to put one in here are you hearing me neither give place to the devil that means give license or a place some means of authority of acting now remember remember this cannot take place unless we permit it right it can't it can't it can't come in it cannot happen unless we permit it now listen what the prophet says here just I want you to listen let me just drop this in if Satan can get through there if he can get by all these conscience and things he gets right down here in the end of the spirit in the mind you'll never look at one of them until first you have to let him in here you have to let him in do you realize what he's bringing you and I are the ones in control we're in control of the thoughts that we receive sometimes we wonder why does it seem like that that that this is why there's a weakness why why does it seem like I I you know that things are are just a little weak it depends on what you're taking in it depends on what you're feeding on sometimes we ready we're ready to go out man I'm ready to go out for battle and War we don't go out to battle and War on hype are you hearing me well I'm a Son of God I'm a Son of God you don't go out to battle on hype right you go to battle with the word of God Amen yeah are you hearing me it's wonderful to be encouraged and we should be encouraged right it's just like when we and I played football we had pep rallies at times on Friday and oh man everybody you know in the stands and things you'd walk through the gymnasium or Auditorium man they were all hyping but let me tell you something going out there was not based on their hype there had been practice all week long studying play studying film taking tests on different movements of the opposing defense and offense it was a grueling task right so it wasn't the pep rally that made me ready it's the word of God hallelujah I want you to think of this here he says you have to let him in then when he gets in he's got control now watch what he'll do he'll begin to use the conscience he begins to use this Outlet taste feel smell hear imaginations conscience memory reasons affections he'll when he gets in now how does he want to use them he wants to use them to put separation between you and God he wants to use him well yeah he's a Healer but your case he'll want to get in upon memory well remember remember how many times you failed him then he'll want to get in upon the Gate of affection he'll want to get in upon every one of these Gates now listen if he gets in he begins to use those Gates Right are you understanding me because one of these days we we will not have to have a stinger taken out of memory one of these days we will not have to have where I don't where where no longer the thoughts and things like that and memories one of these days why it will all be cleared away when we step from this dimension into that other dimension we will not receive another human Spirit we will have a theoy it will replace that human spirit and then we take upon a glorified body of what a body of this earth when we come back cuz we're always meant to live in a three- room house because we're not going to be walking around with all these memories that's right are you hearing me but you see how Satan just likes to be so selective if you start entertaining it he can get right in there say well you're not that good of a Christian you know you're not that you're not that good he can start working on that and the prophet would take it he said don't you let him stand anywhere GL he can start to stand there and want to accuse you what's he trying to do hinder you and it start to affect you you know how it affects you it'll affect you in your prayer life it'll affect you in your approach to the word it'll affect you in coming to the house of God because why he's trying to come against faith in your life listen friends that's why it's so important to have the soldier to have the Holy Ghost the word of God down on the inside not just in our mind that can go away quickly the prophet talked about that woman who was a Sunday school teacher she you know she dressed saintly and godly and everything but she got in a neighborhood and started going to another church where they guess they dress scandalously and she begin to see certain things and here she is looking at how they're addressing and said well if they can do it I can do it too it was presented in her mind in reasoning that's right if she would have had the good man of the house there Faith the word of God the word of God would have stood right against that and said but it's not right and not fit woman should be dressed in modest apparel that doesn't mean what's the latest on GQ or whatever the magazine is it means free flowing un clinging on and on we could go within there in the script you see but reasoning caught a hold of it if she would have had something down there on the inside it would have stood against it I'm was going to preach as it's coming to me there might have been things that even as sister sometimes there's certain things that you bought and you realize when you got it home something just ain't right here something just ain't right I I don't feel right in this what should I do don't reason with it just take it back yeah are you hearing me don't reason with it you because listen it's a holy spirit of God that's trying to protect you he's the word he watches over you and I you can take up something and you know reasoning can strike well this ain't that bad or this ain't that bad but then there's something about it that I just can't feel settled within it don't reason with it amen that even comes friends even the way that we can approach even serving God don't try to reason with things well you know God will accept this and God's okay with this and God's all right with this listen don't accept reasonings anything that reasons against the word let me just say what the prophet said is your enemy anything that reasons against the word of God is your enemy and anything that's for the word is your friend oh my he began to use let me just try to finish this part tie it up he began to use all those different little channels as long as he could get in that's why Satan listen Satan can use imagination oh yeah Satan can put in my mind you know what brother Aaron's got something against you you know why he's setting on you brother Aon might be tired now what happens if I entertain that if I entertain it a thought then begins to register and then I'm the one who starts acting funny and I've created all this has been created because just a thought has come he's got something against me I know it I could tell by how he looked he might be hungry and tired it might had nothing to do with me it might just be what he's looking at in terms of that he's really trying to focus in on the word maybe he's you like this or something but you see look you see how Satan can do that and then what's he trying to do get right in there and when he if it can let him in like yeah you know what other any other time he'd be smiling I mean his smile would be covering up everything nose eyes and everything else he'd be smiling there is true you see if I go along with that who will it affect it'll eventually affect him but it'll affect me yep I'll go to bed with it at night I'll drive with it woo getting somewhere but I'm not going to go all there tonight but see when he can get into this he can get into it if we let him into those Outlets I don't know about you but I just want to put up the sign CU it's already there no trespassing no trespassing no trespassing right brother BR says he's got to come in your mind first and you have to accept it it can batter against you but it can't get to you until you accept it you know what that batter means constantly blows repeated blows not just insinuation these are blows lot of hot air hard blows let me let me let me tie this up here this is where these things and this is where it starts friends listen I I know I I I know I we we we come here and here we are set and sometimes this the most comfortable most relaxing place that we've had all week sometimes this the most restful time right I don't want you to bring blankets or nothing like that here you know and pillows but I mean it's sometimes the most peaceful most relaxing because we're going like sometimes you it's just times you're going like a house on fire and things on your mind and everything and you know but as we're going along and I want you to think about that of having our loins G about with truth and GD up the loins of our mind and it matters the things that we feed on I I know we hear that said an awful lot but it's very true remember this Battleground is called No Man's Land it's kind of like on this stage as I was saying moments before we can put on this stage if this is a room we can put up here whatsoever we choose we can fill it with what we choose we can fill it with you know having a butcher block having a buffet table we can fill it with whatever we want but there are some things that you would just simply say as I was saying about the fish tank and other things you would say it don't belong there it don't belong fish tank is fine at your house in front window whatever the Butcher Block fine in your kitchen but it don't belong up here right don't belong up here having like a whole Pantry up here a shelf that's filled with cereals and everything else don't belong up here right there's just certain things that don't belong but you know who it is that determines what gets put there in our mind us sometimes we we we should be praying listen we should be praying for Revelation that's true but let me just say this to you it's kind of like when I go through and I'm getting ready to to minister and there's things sometimes that it's like I've told you sometimes these thoughts and things we're coming to it's it's taken months to finally get into something of this part but you know as I come to it I just go through and I'll just study quotes and quotes and scriptures you probably think man you got them all included no I don't but I'll just go through and study and study and stud you know why I just want to fill my mind right now I want my heart to be filled but I want my mind you know why because I want the Holy Spirit if there's something that he decides to pull out and retrieve that I don't have in this outline he knows what we have need of I want him to be able to retrieve it so don't worry about trying to make sense out of it just just F your mind with the things of God fill it with truth when truth has come to your life life gge yourself with that truth when the word comes to encourage you and strengthen you on what you ought to be looking at just don't let it pass by but take it right up next to you and say I'll take that thank you Lord you know what that's doing that's taking up the Bible and saying boo devil let me read this in closing BR says when you get to thinking about Divine Healing get to thinking about Christ keep him on your mind if there be any praise if there be any virtue the Bible says think on these things isn't amazing how you can sit in church and the devil have you going down the uh the aisles of Target Walmart maybe not Target but but just around the corner ain't it amazing he can have you thinking man this must be the problem at working this is how we're going to solve it isin't it amazing right here how Satan want you know why because your mind is a place that God wants it to be right on the word to receive the word this is why it's so important even as we come into the house of God we come in in prayer I I know sometimes friends we come in on Thursday nights we come from our workplace we come from other things and we've got the cares of life and what but whatever you can do even when you're on the way here say Lord let my heart be prepared for you Lord let it be prepared for you this is why the singing the music is all into a place to get us settled to help us and help us to enter into that place of worship for the word to be able to come forth if any thought comes by well maybe it couldn't be so get it off your mind right quick think on things that's positive never let a negative thought pass through this is what's key don't let it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your thoughts positive Jesus don't think sitting there in the wheelchair that you're hopeless and helpless you're not not don't let that negative thought ever pass through don't let it anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop like the old farmer said I can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barreled shotgun and said I can sure keep him from roosting so do you the same thing and you too don't let them Roost let them pass right on through here's the shotgun both new and old Testament a double barrel and it's very good too it keeps them away the promises of God that's why we want to Avail ourselves with the word of almighty God we can't keep thoughts from passing through but we can keep them from rooting this is where the scripture said let not sin therefore rain in your mortal body don't let it remain don't let it anchor down don't let it start building the nest one piece of straw another piece of straw another piece of straw another p and pretty soon there's a stronghold pretty soon there's a place that's given pretty soon there's a place that's created a place that's given there this is where we want to stand and hold the word of God and any thought that comes in contrary to the word of God you may not even have a written scripture on it but you know his character you know his character and you look at that and you say the way that thought come that's not according to the character of the Lord Jesus you know why you know him you know him to be the same Lord Jesus you have been acquainted and and connected and United with the character of Jesus Christ don't you love him don't you just want to Just Surrender everything and all that you got Lord let every part of my life let's just stand together let everything and all that is Within Me Lord let it be fully surrendered to you yes Lord I think here if God terries on Sunday and not here tonight two young sisters Lord willing on Sunday that's going to be baptized one was our first time here this past Sunday and when they came here and I begin to after everybody was gone begin to talk to them as they came to me in the office they begin to testify of how that the message was brought across their path Lord and the voice than you Lord is what had struck their heart God hallelujah and they heard that same voice and their desire was what do I need to do cuz I want to serve God with all my heart H so my wife and I worked with a sister it's sister Bernice Lord willing you you'll get a chance to meet her if you hadn't you'll get a chance to meet her on Sunday then just as I was coming in the parking lot right here just coming down the road coming into church I got a call from another young sister say brother Samuel I want to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hall sister Muriel I said let me if you let me park I said we we'll talk and we'll pray together prise so I stayed out in the parking lot and we prayed together over the phone just begin to just lay some things in you know with the scripture but s why why are you saying that I'm saying that today is the day of salvation that how God deals with a heart and a life and how God would bring their hearts to a place to realize I want to serve God with all my life all my heart I want to surrender everything to him I want I want him to be the center of it all I I want to commit my life to the Lord you know there's there's not one of us that could face this battle no that's going on out here there's the the the battle that's on right now the spiritual Force the Demonic power that is there there you flesh and blood cannot face and withstand that that's right there's only one thing that can withstand it and that's the word of God yeah and God brought the word of God down so simple to you and I that we can take a hold of the word of God we can take a hold of that word to accept him as our savior we can take a word take a hold of because remember he's already done it for us it's us accepting it don't don't argue about it somebody comes pays your hospital bill you don't argue with the man who's paying the bill you just say thank you thank you when somebody you know somebody across the way at times I've been setting out to dinner in different places and come to find out hey someone so took your bill I don't go arguing with trying to find out who is it who is it I just say thank you come on the rest of you do the same thing except you might be praise breaking in there thank you we're happy about it let me tell you something there's someone that picked up our debt we didn't even have the money they're wanting a credit card that could cover sin debt but he paid the price he shed his blood and he sent back the Holy Ghost to seek you and I out and bring conviction to our heart to point out to us this is what I did for you on Calvary this is why I rose on that Easter morning this is why I sended it high over every reprint and parity and over all of those things and sent back the holy spirit this is why for you I just say it like this tonight if you don't know him what an opportunity to really Surrender Your Life to him and it's an opportunity to say Lord let the word go down on the inside Lord let it fall to the inside let it and Lord let my life I want my life I want that responsib possibility of ging it about with truth cuz you're not going to do that for me I have to do that I want to take that I said Lord I want to pick it up remember when you begin to feel slack the prophet says and the devil says it's no use I won't ask you to raise your hands but probably the devil has told you it's no use you know how you're to respond at that time tighten it up pull the sword a little tighter to you tighten it up with truth I am one of his I belong to him amen you you've got you've got a right to tighten that up that's how we tighten it up and as we walk out of here we walk out of here with that real determination and surrender in our hearts Lord I'm going to surrender my time I'm going to surrender my thoughts I'm going to surrender Lord sometimes we become so busied with cares of life and they're real all around us real there's no there's no make belief that they're real but Lord I want to surrender I want to surrender show me Lord lead me on things of the sacrifice and those things Lord leave me there I want my life to be GED about with the truth Lord and the word that you and I have receiv received when we walk out of here listen take that word like that man with a Bible and you take that word and you stand right against the enemy and say Boo back boo back and the word puts him down to his great size you love him tonight amen let's just pray together heavenly father I thank you Lord for your mercy tonight you're so you're so good to us Lord you are you're better to us than we are to ourselves Lord Lord your care your love your mercy to us Lord father you see Lord Jesus the needs Lord that have been Lord right here Among Us Lord father you see father each each life each heart you know where each of us are

would you make yourself known to them in that way Lord Jesus Lord God if it's as a savior make yourself known to him that way let him see Lord that the price was paid it's now to accept what you've done Lord I than Lord as your spirit Lord it'll lead us it leads us the Bible said the goodness of God leads us to repentance Lord it leads us Lord to that place of laying down our life at the foot of Calvary Lord God father surrendering Lord Our Lives Lord that father that you Lord Jesus might have control and take full Liberty and preeminence in our lives help us Lord every one of us Lord this this battle that we have spoke about here over the past few services tonight Lord in overcoming the battlefield in the mind this is where overcoming is at Lord this is where we are met Lord help us to fill our minds with the right things Lord sometimes Lord we can just it's just sometimes it's even cares of Life Lord right Lord God I've had different ones Lord of Believers at different times will

overcoming Lord battles Lord that are set before us but there's an overcoming there's overcoming Grace Lord Lord Jesus we can never look at our failures and receive the strength that we need to overcome Lord when we can look to you when we can look in our lives Lord and realize and see that reality that greater is he that's in me and Lord God we can place that before us and say Lord by your
