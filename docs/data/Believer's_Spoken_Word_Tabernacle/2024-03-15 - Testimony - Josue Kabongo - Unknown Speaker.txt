prayer right amen how precious that is we um tonight I want to um just ask that you would uh keep in mind um there's a brother that I don't know really if um anyone here has met him but he and I were together in um uh Mexico there last year in the meetings and then uh he attends brother Ron Peterson's church I had um been with um we had had some fellowship there before uh when we were in Arizona at one time his brother Warren I can't pronounce his last name he's from the Philippines but he's been in uh Arizona for a number of years really good brother but he he had text me uh last week and asked that we'd keep him in prayer he's going to Pakistan um and you know there's two things going on right now there's the holidays for their beliefs Ramadan and then also the approaching of Easter so uh he's going there to be with a Brethren he said his expectations are real high and and brother Warren he's went into some he's went into some tight places already um but the brother Warren has a just a wonderful Ministry and so I know you may not know him but I'm asking that you'd keep him in prayer I I can't pronounce his last name and uh but I know brother Warren and I know he certainly would appreciate that I told him we'll be bringing it before the church and we'll try to bring it up again on Sunday and then next Thursday he's going to be there for a few days and so we just want to be praying for him I also want to ask you to pray for I know I you've been praying for it I I appreciate the request that's been going up for uh the different needs um that have been around that are not even a part of our assembly but they're on our hearts like uh brother Ron Spencer and uh sister Ruth Hoyer and I know there's many others that um are dealing with cancer that we may not even know by name but God knows them and they're just as important as of these other request that's that's made known and we want to just continue to keep each one of them in prayer as well is Brother Bill that the Lord would just completely restore his voice back you know the doctors they've said that that that would be but we are I I told him today when he would came in the office but I was here earlier and left and I said sounding it's coming back but we want to keep our brother in prayer the Lord will just continue to strengthen him and what I've asked for is that God would just so completely restored he'll be able to stand right here and sing again amen I mean to me there's to me there's just nobody can sing hymns like brother Bill and I I really mean that he's got a he's got a real gift with that and um so we just so appreciate that my neighbor Gabe um my wife had a chance to speak with his wife the other day and um uh just asking that you would keep them in prayer i' just been just so that you understand my heart I've I've not I've not intruded I've not tried to knock any doors down or walls down I've continued to let them know I'm here for you we're here for you but I know right now that there's a lot he's 49 years old his name is Gabe Vasquez and uh you know it's a miracle right now that he's still alive they only gave him three to four weeks a couple months ago and so he's coming into his last chemo treatment and um it's a lot a lot of questions they have on their on their heart my wife was expressing that as far as with from his wife and I know she's wanted me to talk to him but she's wanted the door to open his wife has and you know I just I've just been praying about I'm asking you to help me pray I know he told me before he said Sam he said with the first go around he said it said it brought me closer to the Lord but you know he's in a place right now that a lot of questions of why you know where sometimes where a person can be almost a little bitter but I'm asking you to just keep him in prayer I've a lot of things I have on my heart and things but I'm just looking I'm waiting I'm looking to the Lord and I just want to be mindful of his leading I've got some things I don't want to say it out right now I want to keep it close to my heart heart but would you just continue to keep that in prayer I know you have been but just just want to see the Lord move for him whatever whatever the way I I want everything to be ready there and love to see nothing more than the Lord just completely restoring that's what it really is I'm just praying for but um tonight if we could just stand together and I certainly appreciate the musicians and before I ask brother joshu he's I know he's got some on this presentation but I just want to read one verse of scripture as our brother would prepare to come and I've asked brother joshu to share his testimony tonight we he was going to try to share it in one time that we had together with a testimony service but it just didn't work out for him to be here and as a matter of fact fact um it needed some more time and I've heard I've heard bits and pieces of his testimony but there's things that I had not heard until we were setting back in January 1st at sister Judith's house and um that right there was something I looked at and I said this we we it needs to be shared every every testimony is important but I want you to look at this tonight as we turn to Psalms 139 thank you musicians Psalms 139 and then I'm going to just we just turn it right over to brother joshu as a matter of fact brother Josh if you want to go ahead and come and we can get you set up with your laptop here and he's got some slides I know this is going to be it's it's going to be very good tonight and uh you can come on up here I want to read in just Psalms 139 and you know David without prolonging uh anything right here uh David in Psalms 139 in verse 13 He said for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou Hast covered me in my mother's womb and I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that my soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect in other words had not been completely come into form and manifestation and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were f fashioned when as yet there was none of them and I love verse 17 how precious also are thy thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them amen could we just bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord is this moment Lord of this service Lord that you have given to us father we know that there is nothing greater than Lord your word and father you have given your word and as we see Lord as your word has went forth Lord and you have Lord found us Lord it was not us that found you but you have watched over us Lord all throughout our journey Lord and dear God we ask tonight you would bless Lord this testimony service this time lord for brother joshu as he would share father his testimony Lord dear God we are so aware and more aware in our hearts tonight that God as your thoughts Lord we are one of your redeemable thoughts Lord and father to think and to realize how precious your thoughts are towards us Lord father you knew us oh God before there was Adam Stardust or molecule you knew us Lord we were with you there Lord that's exactly what Lord job could Lord recall as you would bring his attention that beyond all of the suffering above Beyond everything that he was going through you would take him back to Lord the right foundation and you would ask him where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth Lord I'm so thankful that we have a solid foundation to rest on and that Foundation is none other than Jesus Christ himself Lord we love you and we thank you tonight we ask that you would just bless our brother bless your children tonight Lord father as this testimony has being given Lord I pray may you just Lord even ministering to hearts and lives of your love and your tender care Lord and how that you watch over us Lord we love you and we thank you once again father in the name of Jesus Christ amen maybe as you're being seated why don't you turn around and shake hands with someone the okay God bless you um before I start I just want to uh langage I might lose the process of thought through what I'm going to say throughout this testimony so um just understand that and uh other thing is that I'm not good a public speaker uh if I mispronounce something uh please bear with me um as Brother Sam uh Samuel said uh last year I had this burden in my heart to share what God has done in my life but um uh it's been years actually God doing something I'll be like oh God if you do this I'll testify if you do this for me I'll testify but all this thing accumulated that I forgot I didn't have enough time but since last year when we were going through the immigration process for my wife um that's when I start heing uh feeling this burden to share all that God has been doing um so it's going to be very lengthy also bear with me on that I just want to bring in some more details that this can help somebody who might be going to the same thing um so the uh testimony I'm going to give tonight is going to have two parts one is uh about all everything you guys know about my wife what God did last year so that's what I want to start with because it's a little shorter than the whole testimony so uh that's why you want to uh call Sharon to come here and uh so I can uh glorify God and then uh uh together with you people of God because you prayed it's also the answer to your prayers so uh in 2001 that's uh when uh after school and starting working that's when I start looking for uh somebody to get married to so I went around uh according to what I thought was normal to do uh and uh through the leading of Brother Sam but after few trips uh that were not successful so I start having this burden uh to uh go back uh home in Congo to get married there but I resist that I didn't I didn't like that at all because I knew the and out of immigration system and I've been through that before I didn't want to go through that again and it's uh more expensive and somebody abroad we don't know who they are what's going on so I resist that for a long time but uh as the burden was growing so I pray that God if this time I'm I'm making this trip uh somewhere else I was going I believe in Kentucky if things don't go the way I think should go then I will know that it's a sign from you that I have to go back to Africa so I went uh uh with uh one of the brothers uh who prays in uh um Lima we made a trip to Kentucky um uh on our way back that's when I realized that uh maybe this time you might be the best but after a few weeks uh that's when the person I was interested in uh said that uh he was not going to work so I was like either way it's God's will because it's the prayer that is being answered also so that's when I start uh talking to Sharon uh in Congo Sharon is a daughter of my former Pastor when I used to be there uh she was younger when I left uh but uh when I start thinking about who am I going to talk in Congo and all that I spoke with her dad so uh she was also finishing her high school and everything that's how we start talking of Sharon but we didn't know how things were going to end uh because I did some research uh about the immigration process how things uh work with fiance or marriage things like that so the information that was there at the time was that within a year somebody who fiance can bring uh who is fiance to a foreign uh uh person can bring them back in the US so that's how I decided that we can go ahead and uh bring her up here as a fiance so we can get married in the church here but um things didn't turn out as we expected because the pandemic the covid pandemic didn't do Accord to us uh there was like a big backlog of uh cases at the the uh immigration uh offices that to treat the cases that were being introduced it was taking so long because they were treating the cases that were there before so that's uh how we cut uh delayed so long so we just kept praying that uh God would make a way so that they can tweat our case give us the answer so I think everybody in this church prayed for that also uh until uh God answered but you know sometimes uh God want to see how patient we are but uh you most of the time we fall short on that uh because we are human but uh I decide that before it's taking too long so I'm going back to Congo just get married and uh come back and wait uh until the immigration answers the request so I went there in uh February of uh 2022 uh I believe yeah that's where when we get we got married in Congo um in the church there so even though I had wished to have the uh wedding ceremony here so it was against my wish but God knew everything uh I went there we got married so I spent one month there uh the in March I came back the same day I cut here that's when I got the uh email from the immigration that they answered the request uh positively so now uh after that there was another process to go through the case to be sent to the um National visa center uh where the case number will be assigned before it sent to the Embassy in Congo where Sharon is or was and uh it took also like almost three months to get the cas to the um National visa center and we were hope that that summer she would come here after the case reached the Embassy to our big surprise when the case reached the embassy uh we couldn't get the appointment we they told us that there is no uh like open space for appointment for interview at this time we were like desperate because uh they were given the same reason that the covid uh made the thing more iated and for that specific uh counil in Congo they had stopped tweeting cases of uh fiance visa so we were like there was no uh hope that anything would come out there because they said the only possible availability for interview would be in 2025 so we we were all shocked and uh despair settling and all that but again we turn to the prayers here every Thursday every Sunday here everybody was praying and uh from the bottom of our heart we say thank you again and uh we know that God answers prayer that's uh uh what happened that after uh three three month from June to September we didn't hear nothing and uh we prayed we prayed until in June uh in September we got a opening that they would answer they will give us the interview in in November this was like a big surprise because uh I did also research uh in the at the council us Council in Congo uh even with people who did the student visa to come here to study it was the same answer the availability would be until 2025 so we were like there was no hope ins sight but God made a way that uh through his power he opened the Kate for us so that she can have the interview she did it she cut the interview done I was there and uh uh they granted her visa to come here and we cut here so since then I've been trying to uh testify of what God did but I didn't have time uh last time I was going to do it during the testimony session here but I got uh booked at work and I was not able to so this is to say that um there is no need to be in a despair because we have a God that can do what men cannot do so we want to uh give glory to God because he's worthy of it so thank you so much again God bless you for praying for my wife so you can go back I wish she could speak English would talk by herself but yeah so all is just uh one of the path uh of B uh a everything that God has been doing in my life and this was like the last episode if it was a series it would be like episode one two three so yeah so from uh the beginning uh that I made this slide so that he can uh help us because I can lost the idea of what I'm trying to do so uh so I just want to read uh we can read together uh so um that's Psalms 22 2225 I will declare thy name onto my brethren in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee he that fear the Lord praise him all ye the seed of Jacob glorify him and fear Him all ye the seed of Israel for he hasn't despised or AB the Affliction of The Afflicted neither has he hid his face from him but when he Cried unto him he heard my my praise shall be of the in the great congregation I will pay my vows before that fear them that fear the lord that fear Him this uh scripture is uh what um inspired me to share it's uh because uh we we are human we have more tendencies to be ungrateful uh but uh God calls us to the opposite side of that to be grateful and if God does something uh we need to make it known to others not only to let them know that we are special no it's because to let them know that there is a God that is able to do uh things that are Beyond us so um going back to my uh uh uh Early Childhood that's where I want to start just to set the uh the step footstep of uh how thing unfold afterward is that uh I didn't have a very uh good uh or happy childhood because from the beginning it's been uh all always uh series of hardship poverty uh suffering uh uh a lot of things that I canot give details of everything but um as you can see that from early on I didn't grow up for my parents uh my dad I didn't see him at all so I just heard that he passed away I was baby or something like that uh and uh my mom um she didn't have a stable place to stay also so I was staying with my grandparents uh I didn't see her much neither so because she was uh elsewhere but at age 8 around 8 she start getting sick and sicker also and uh so forth around age nine she went on and passed away so I stayed with my grandparent I saw her uh dying so nothing that could be done no uh money to give her like good health care and all that she also had a baby which uh was uh around 2 years old or 3 years old and uh because when she passed on the baby you know when a baby lose the mom they they sometimes they can't handle it well uh she start getting sick also and uh we didn't have money my grand parents didn't have money to uh bring her to hospital either so uh she suffered I was watching and looking as she was dying slowly and uh she went on and died uh we couldn't even afford the cemetery so they had to bury her behind the house uh so that's uh from then I was very uh uh in hopelessness I was becoming very isolated I didn't want to do anything with anybody you want to share anything I was just kept to myself uh very inter so uh I very very introvert so it was not because I didn't have something to share but it was just because it was too much so I couldn't uh um so that's when my grandparent decided to uh leave the big city where they lived went to the village and uh together with me they took me there uh they did that the field work farm work uh to meet their needs at the same time um I start going to school in this Village uh so I do the field work of them and pay my school because in Congo we are not so privileged to study for free you have to walk uh pay the the school for yourself if you don't pay so the government doesn't care so I did this few filled uh work and paid uh my school as the time went on and that's when I uh found out that um the way to escape this feeling of hopelessness and uh the isol isolation and everything so I really fell in love with school in a way that I could miss everything but not school because that's where I was in company of other student and uh so I really liked school a lot it was one of the mechanism to uh num the the hurt I had and uh also my grandparents were Pentecostal believers they prayed in Pentecostal church so uh I went to church with them and uh I really to escape again beside the school I'm not sure if this is fine um yeah uh so I really became also more involved in uh that church or Pentecostal church because they had a lot of praying a session of fasting and praying or that so it was an an opportunity for me to express what I was feeling in me in prayer so I was praying a lot and um staying a lot in uh in the church um because just to escape all this uh thing going but uh it didn't uh help a lot but he did for the time uh a certain point there was a uh campaign Evangelical Evangelical campaign where people came uh in the SE in the village with uh a big organization organizing a preaching session so we didn't know who they were so we turn out that it was message uh Believers from the big city that came in this The Village to do the campaign to bring in uh new Believers so at this time my grandparents were were the one who attended that Campa campaign at jco uh because believe it or not there was a big reputation in Congo that those who believe the message where um I'm not sure how you say it in English people who worship aen uh idolatry something like that so a big stigma if you believe the message they look up ah he worships a men uh and uh there was so many Catholic Church um also Pentecostal church around so nobody had much to do with the message churches but uh it turns out that it was because people didn't know actually the content or content of the message they just heard uh they didn't know what is inside the message actually that's uh why people held this belief but after this campaign and uh the preacher that was there uh was uh had the gift of healing so people saw really that God can walk mightly uh like right now because we used to you know go to church pray fast and do all these things but seeing God working uh like in real time was like strange to people but when they saw that people start believe in the message so uh my grandparent along them they believe the message I was still in a Pentecostal church so because I didn't want to be uh uh labored as a man worshipper so uh but from time to times because uh uh what we call children rights how you call child rights or you know the right of children uh it's not as exalted in cono as it is in here so sometimes they will be like you go to church today with us or you don't eat okay so I have them to go uh with them so uh from the time to time when I got there uh they preach uh it was like a Sunday school I feel like the teaching was pretty good but the the prayer part because I was so attached to the Pentecostal church I didn't feel the prayer the the warmth of praying like the way I was in the Pentecostal church because we didn't have time it was like uh Sunday school so no time for that it was just teaching and letting you go uh but then time the teaching took over my uh uh assumptions my uh belief like this is pretty actually good so comparing to what we're doing in Pentecostal church and this St teaching so I become pretty much uh convinced but I was not concerned I was like ah it's good but uh uh then then at the same time years went on like two years until when I got almost in uh High School one year before high school uh that's when I became con convinced that this is the best is the truth so there is no way that I can be uh foot in foot out so I need to uh become uh involved so uh at the time I got also High School uh and this high school I went on was a Catholic church school so in a Catholic Church you have to attend the mass uh or you you're not part of the school so and at the same time I became very involved in message the message and that's when I get in this school where they forc me to go to the Catholic church every Thursday and every uh Sunday Thursday morning because they had the mass before school you go to the mass and you go to the school meeting and then you go to the class if you don't attend this mass at the morning meeting at the like school assembly they'll call you up front and they'll beat you until you bleed and uh so that's uh how it was and this happened I couldn't uh do that because I knew what the Catholicism was and what the message says about it so when I go to school I don't attend the mess I get beaten every week I'm like so this is becoming too much it's either I stick with this or I give it up and uh but if I give it up where else I could get a good education because it was the best school in the city the town uh that had good reputation uh uh and this was uh what you call here equivalent of 11th grade at the beginning that's when it became more severe so uh one day I got beaten so I made up my mind that morning that uh this is it so I'm not going to uh come to the school again uh I had to quit and go to a public school uh a public school which didn't have a good reputation compared to uh Catholic school so uh when I got there um many people knew me because I had also relatively good reputation in the school because of uh good grades and every that uh people were disappointed to see that I was leaving but I didn't have Choice um some of two other brother two other person that really trust me decide to live at the same time with me for some reason so I uh went to this school the following year which was like the year of graduation from high school in Congo we have the system of national examination uh naal which means uh the in 12th grade they send this exam at the end of the year you do it so they sent the uh examination to the capital somewhere where they uh give the uh correction and then they publish who has uh succeeded or who has failed the year then they have to restart again so at this time I didn't have a mean to repeat any class because I didn't have money I didn't have a I had to succeed and finish because if I don't finish uh I not be able to afford the next year to repeat the year but when I left went to this uh other school uh and we did the final exam the national exam so my generation from the Catholic church that was in 12 gr that Year everybody failed except one person who was not as bright as we thought and uh but where where I went which was didn't have good reputation so uh we passed almost at 85 87% of person I'm like wow so that's why I was thinking for the scriptures says whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed so it was that if I didn't believe in God H to stand by what was right to leave this school I was going to fail together with this generation and uh then but God didn't leave me he made a way that uh I was able to succeed so that's a small detail of my uh childhood growing up until things went South uh that's uh What uh will lead us to how I get to United States because even growing up I had ambition you know you were in a village you studying you feel like you are people think you are smart but there is no way you can get ahead because in K it's not how smart you are it's who you know or how much money you have to succeed in life uh but here I was in Village but I had ambition in me I I want to become this I want this this but there is no way to get to that uh but uh God knew everything from the beginning so uh that's uh After High School though I stayed in the village uh one of my uncles who had some business in the city called me to walk with him but I knew that he's not believer and his wife was uh even more not believer uh they could have a bad influence on me I may not uh progress well so I refused I stayed in the village doing field walk uh given that I was close to the church where I was uh praying uh and I was also helping the pastor of that church um like a treasure uh keeping the church finance and things like that yeah I was helping that way and also teaching Sunday School uh so until two years later uh I start now uh leaving the village going selling stuff stuff around uh and it led me to go uh to this uh place I'm going to show you now so this is how it all started uh we I left the village now I'm around the country Selling Stuff buying stuff and everything so uh originally uh on this map this is in Congo this is where I'm from right there where uh the light is that's my Province so it's 26 province in total so I'm from here but as I was doing these things uh I found myself up here you can see the distance so I was there uh selling things uh because when I left here first I went to the capital city kinasa where I bought Stu and went through the this is Congo River this is the Congo River so I went through this River to this part of the Congo where I sold things and bought all the stuff were going back to kinasa still on the Congo River so uh you can do your Google search you find out that Congo River is a second in the world or something like that powerful long and very can be also very dangerous um so uh on this was on October 28th in 2009 that's when this uh event happened so I uh was in this uh on this River in something called a barge I'm not sure if you know the barge it's uh a big metallic case pushed by a marine engine so we had our Goods in this barge and uh selling back to kinasa but it happened that uh we were in the wrong place at the wrong moment how so we came with the budge somewhere here from here from here we came from on the river to somewhere here that's where they accosted I believe that's how you say it they accosted the barge to change the engine or to maintain the engine and everything uh so we have to spend the night on this place um without us knowing that at the village where we had we had were both uh accosted there was like a tribal conflict going on the village uh it was a inter Community uh fighting going on it's been boiling on for a long time but this day was actually the fiful day or uh Dreadful day so that's when we slept there it was a Wednesday night so now on Thursday morning that's when the fightings broke out in these two Villages so one of the Village People came to this village where our boat was and uh start fighting so they killed almost everybody or the majority of the Village um they killed a lot of people and came back when they finish in the village they took over so now they came to the river which is like their po or where the people come with goods and all uh put their goods in the ships to ship them away yeah yeah Port so they came now to the port and our B was are casted and we are it's like on a river so you don't know where to go it's uh if this side is water and this is the village where they killing people so you stuck there there's nowhere to go that's how we stayed there uh as they came they were shooting everybody who was moving anything that moves they shoot they kill um so they came they approached us it was around 9:00 a.m. in the morning so they start shooting from AAR so uh the only place to hide was like the stack of corns in uh in uh what you call uh in bags and there's corn in bags and uh Cava and other goods St stacked up in on the BGE so you can hide under each one of these things uh but I head somewhere I sat down like and the pile of cones and my knees to my chest just not to be seen so unfortunately I saw them coming and uh this one person had a rifle and he went down in one knees and and he shoot so I didn't know if he he pointed at me I saw he pointed at me but I didn't know uh I didn't hear the pain or anything so that's when I see one of my leg falling down I'm like I'm sitting down but my leg is falling down what's happening I look like this it was um blood going all over and my leg was laying down I couldn't I'm like o now um I got shot so uh as I'm trying to because I didn't even feel pain at first so uh when I try now to scream or cry after I felt the pain that's when I realized that I had a lot of bones in my mouth like bones in mouth what happened again so I had reflex to touch my head just to make sure that my uh uh skull was not uh blown up but my head was intact so I touch my mouth that's when I heard my lip laying on my uh uh Shen here so turns out that the bone I heard in I felt in my mouth was like my teeth that c blown out by a bullet so I was here uh uh I'm like this is it so it's over uh but uh uh there was nothing I could do at this time other than cry to God I really cried at that time because uh the what they were doing that was that when they shoot people people fall down and they will come uh if you you didn't die they will cut the uh the throat so they can finish you so when they came almost about to come over the barge uh God intervened so God J that there was one of their member of the army or their Rebel group came from the village running and yelling very high and screaming uh they because they had a chief somebody in higher rank who were like leading the battle here there and he came yelling that uh the chief says to stop stop stop killing and preserve the ammunition wow they were like because this is the buge and they were like at the door of this church coming in that's when this men came in yelling and screaming so uh for some reason they stopped uh carrying people throat that were because they had machetes and knives and the rifles um they stopped and they now start just collecting people valuables uh like uh if you have money they come they take it they take everything and uh so when uh they reached the barge where I was uh there was like so many people other other people that were also shot dead the one that were living that were still alive on that b were like uh five that were shot with me but the rest were dead like that were shot also uh the one that were left alive were some of the people from The Village Who had who knew each other with these people prior to this conflict so uh this was like uh almost after 12 we start they they shed me around 9 so at 12: after they were they still collecting things taking every uh money everything they had to take so and the time went on now they didn't know what to do with me because uh this is not the first time I have an accent because at that in that region I had an accent because I was not from that region for so it's where am I uh so it's uh from here to there so they speak so many different dialects and and when I speak I have a big accent so nobody doesn't recognize me from their region like so where is he from so some they start speculating about where I'm from and uh so that was one of I believe maybe one of the reason they didn't finish me because they identified me as not a threat to them so um as they start now trying what to do with me um a small uh canoe came around a for those who don't know African Cano it's like this uh but it was much smaller uh but in this Cano they had to transport two uh two people let's see three people it was one person who used to walk on that Port of uh entry uh to the Village from a he used to be a uh government agent so he had also a good reputation so they want to save him because he was shot also and he survived he was shot in the right arm uh he survived he survived and they want to save him uh now they like and one of other person whom they knew also they want to save this two people but uh that's when they cut this canoe to C them across the the river because the village was bound down so there was no way to take care of them but the only way to save them was to go across the river right here this is the Congo RC where I'm from and this is in green is another Congo a smaller Congo uh it's another country but it is separated by Congo River right there so this all events are happening here so we have to cross the River from there to here uh in hopes to find uh medical care but uh that that's when they put these two people in the canoe and they about to leave so when they about to leave that's when I start screaming more I'm like if I stay here so I'm done um so I screamed even more they like they didn't know what to do with me because they did stop killing people so it's like okay the only way what we can do for him is to put him with these people and uh cross the uh the river that uh when they decided uh to put me in the same boat with these people and uh to send me across the river of these people uh to get the um first aid that's when I think that Psalms 234 to5 says yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy Road and thy staff they comfort me thou prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies because they were the one who were meant to finish me but they were the one who helped me to go across and got saved so that scripture came alive right there so uh when I got uh to get uh on this canoe it was because the weight was too much five people in this canoe was like uh we could think also uh but because it's Congo River is Big it's like uh more than uh to cross it's like up to 00 meters to cross across the so uh they went back and forth among themselves to be to agreed as to put me in this canoe or not after back and forth they decide to put me in and this canoe almost s was like a small part like this that was left above the water and uh we crossed the river we cut the other side of the river almost around 4: p.m. uh uh what we found there was even worse because people from all water ports around the cities were crossing there people that were shot didn't die uh they were in this V so we cut we found even more people there that were already shut and uh laying all over the places there's no hospital there is no a nurse or a doctor it's like there was only one nurse actually who didn't know what to do now because he's used to treat like small cats from people Fe treat fever and things like that but now he has like uh uh these people shut all over so he's he doesn't know what to do he's just going by people he empathize with trying to keep them like T nor to helm come the pain so we were just laying there knowing not what to do and uh the pain was so much that I didn't even know where I was again or what was going on I didn't feel pain no more so I was just there until uh almost uh 5 6ish p.m. that's when uh at the same time when these things were going G on the North the news went across the river that the massacre is happening so the United Nation heard also the same news they sent a motorized boat uh to the north through the water so when they reached there uh they found us and uh they start picking up people to rescue them to bring them to the uh cities where there was aspiro and things like that so the uh picked me up uh it was almost at 6:00 p.m. that's uh when uh I realized that I almost died or something because I didn't know where I was I didn't know what was happening just as as at one point that's when I felt pain when I felt pain I trying to to scream in pain because my leg was dangling like this sorry this thing so loud okay so my leg was dangling so it was like so much pain and uh the sight movement you can feel like every nerve in your body screaming so when I felt this pain I screamed so that's and open my eyes so one of the people around me was like shocked he was like you really still alive like what do you mean that's in my heart so that's when I realized that maybe I was out already and uh didn't know that but just when he said that and I because when uh he said that I found myself on people shoulders to carry me to the boat that's when oh I'm on people shoulders um I got to the boat um and they sent uh brought us to a bigger city we got there around 8:00 p.m. there was a big city um big hospital but no medical equipment so we we spent a night in this hospital without care so what they did was just uh because my leg was so dangling so they just put two planks of wood along my leg and tied it up so that it doesn't move as much um I we spent a night there the following day uh to evening again that's when they picked us up to another bigger city we cut there at night and uh it was also a big hospital nice hospital with medical equipment but no doctors so we spend the night in this uh Hospital um but uh at this time already I was um almost rotten because nobody could come to that door if I'm here nobody could come to that door because the smell was so bad he was like R was like past everything going on so uh there was no almost no hope at this point because we like what's the point uh there was no point but uh God in his big plan he says the plans he has for us is the plan of success and not the plan uh that to harm us so um in his plan he has already prepared that's uh what I say here after these three Hospital almost with no medical care the fourth day this big city we cut in was called info um and uh God Made A Way in a way that in that same city there was a small hospital that small hospital was founded by an American missionary uh uh missioner how you say yeah so this American missionary you can find him on we on Google he had a calling to co to Congo brazaville to help people through the uh Health Care he is a doctor so uh he had found this small hospital and each year they are a volunteer from around the Americas like United State and the South America who called there to volunteer uh helping people uh with different cases that are not treatable by African means so when they uh that that same year that same night when we C in info that's the same night that a team from here uh from America cut in this in that hospital to volunteer and uh he happened to be uh he happened to be a special orthopedists so that's why I called them Angels sent from God so uh that's uh when they heard this that this team arrived almost the same night as we the same night we got also in that City so in morning they sent request to see if they could come to the this hospital and treat us so um but they didn't want to come to this one hospital because maybe they were not familiar with the instrument there but they request that they bring us to that small hospital where they were so when we got there it was also at night that's why I said like fourth day after being shot no medical care that were appropriate so uh that's when we got there we were many people and uh they had to do what they could do um to save whom they could save and uh and the only way to save some was amputations so they amputated almost everybody in before me that went in to O because they couldn't save the infection was so much um uh so so when my time came and my case was even more worse because it was in the thigh uh in the thigh for those who are familiar with uh um physiology and everything there are more fat more um creas in the thigh than other part like arms and cough so when you have infection in the thigh it's more uh difficult to to control then if you have it elsewhere so at this time my infection was so spread that he went way back in the bones and and infection in the bone it is almost impossible to treat also yeah so that's uh everybody went before me and got amputated so I was like now I'm going to be amputated uh that's why you see at the beginning I talked about a uh Dreadful day or a faithful day Dreadful day because I was so afraid of become Ang kept from when I was young so I would be like if I con Street see andap people I would be feeling so bad I be like trying to help everybody who but I was thinking as a young person if ever I become handicapped there was no o to leave I have to kill myself but now I was before that same fact that in next few minutes I'll be amputated and uh it was worse than knowing that I cut shot and then uh when I cut in over for some reason this doctor um that's uh after surgery one of the surgeries because I'm going on to have more surgeries so uh for some reason this doctor here is the one the chief orthopedist uh Dr ol he was accompanied by this Dr Carlos and there is another doctor who is not in a picture here but him is the founder of this uh small Hospital over there so when I went in a they did surgery and for some reason they decide not to amputate me I'm like this C to be card because there's no there was no explanation and uh beside me there was only one other person that was not unrated uh him had just a shot in the lower part of the lake in the cough and it was like the bullet like went through the bone but the bone was not broken in half yeah that's why he didn't get amputated but he had also infection but because he was in the lower part of the bone of the leg was not as bad um so when they preserved my leg it was like the only way to do this is like intense antibiotic treatment so that's why they did um the picture is not as clear if you see that there is like two barel of fluid those flu are not like the IV fluid as we have them even though I was having the IV flu IV antibiotics but was like irrigation this antibiotic irrigation uh it ca right inside my leg to irrigate the leg and there is a collection back on the side so is like 24 hours just running there and cleaning and being collected at the same time I'm getting also uh antibiotic through IV and other means so this went on for months so after this first surgery it didn't succeed the infection was not controlled so they brought me back in the war again after few weeks uh no change because the infection was so much spread inside the bone that antibiotic didn't do nothing so um eventually the doctor the team that came did leave went back to America uh and uh I was just with uh uh him uh Dr Joseph Harvey so uh he continued the antibiotic treatment as he saw that there was no success he decide to go in and cut the parts of the bone that were infected to stop the spreading so uh he brought me to O he cut the bone at the end of surgery he showed me like big out of the bones I'm like wow this is my bone here uh so he did that and brought the two ends of the bond together in hope that he can uh grow and heal each together um and uh I had a a device called external fixer I think you guys are familiar with that I had this thing the whole time so afterward after months and months of treatment without success that's when uh I had decided that I had to go somewhere else but you can wonder how uh who helped me through all this process uh uh I didn't have nobody no one I was in a foreign country I was bed bound I was uh I didn't know even much of languages spoken around so I was throughout cared for by God himself because because from the first city we cut in uh after we got picked up by the un uh that came with a motorized boat in that City there was one person who didn't know me nothing but just because he heard my story that I'm far away from my uh Province and um I have nobody here to care for me so this individual decide to leave everything that he had to accompany me everywhere that's him is somebody I never knew I never seen he just decid to leave all that he was doing and start working with me throughout these whole hospitals until the day I left brazille to come here to America we were still with this person so there is uh nothing that can explain that water than the hand of God so uh after I left uh uh bra uh left in Fondo this uh uh doctor this is just some of the pictures for what the care I was getting there this is the medical team this is one of the victims this is another victim that got amputated you can't see his arms but his arm is amputated and uh this is medical staff and this is the team that took care of us so um after I left there I was transferred to brazaville uh still in the care of United Nation um usually uh United Nation when they take people as refugees they are in a camps like it's Collective treatment you don't get special treatment because you're not special than anybody but God made me special not because I was special so um these people took care of me in a way that when I cut you brazaville I was loded in a hotel for more than a year and they paid everything um and I took uh I cut a health treatment the first one was another surgery they did surgery uh in brazaville but they couldn't control the infection because at the same time the lake was like has a hole from top to bottom and the infection was pouring from both sides so um the only thing that was holding the leg together was fixer the external fixer but in brazille the doctor was thinking if this thing stays in for too long it can cause something even worse so now we have to take the fix out to give the bone the time to uh heal from infection and then uh they took the fixer out my legs was like stayed like this he said instead of leaving it like this let's put a cast on he put on a cast and uh uh left a hole on top and bottom to give space for infection drainage but after few months is like it's uh it's not helping because the bone didn't heal uh so he took the cast out so then I have only a broken leg walking around with it on crutches so at this point there was no other uh in there hope inside because everything that could have been done has been done and at this time I'm going to be to content with uh working on crutches the rest of my life with a broken leg and infection running through it so I got so discouraged and so despair that I didn't see the mean of living again because I knew that I'm in a foreign country nobody to lean on so there's nothing I can do physically to help myself for future for anything things so all this brought me down bad so I was like when I compare my situation with my ambitions and everything I'm like no no no way to live like this so one day I DET that I was going to end my life so I was in my uh Hospital uh uh Hotel hotel room uh but at the same time I was going I uh going to a a church that was around the the block where I lived uh I was going there that's where I met uh this pastor uh he a pastor Bosworth both of he went on to pass away uh last uh last two years in 2020 one uh he he passed away but he was a person that God used to preserve my life at that time because when after uh deciding that I'm going to end my life I'm like but I still love God so I have to go to church and then see what happened after that I went to church that Sunday morning uh when they start we sang and everything when he went up to the pet to start preaching so he called my name and said uh he need to see me after the service so I didn't know what was going to happen after the service that's when we sat down with him and he told me that God told me that you want to commit suicide I'm like what how did you know that and he said so why do you want to commit suicide and he went on to uh talk to me uh to encourage me and showing me scriptures that's when I gave up on that uh idea so is to say that uh in every step of the way God has always always somebody or some instrument to help you get to the uh your destiny so at this time uh we we start praying again so that God can make a way for me to get uh health care I needed but the only what I mean was to go abroad to the West here or Europe Canada Australia where there is like Advanced science to to treat but how would you get there no way so there's no money there is no somebody you know so that's when I met with somebody else who told me that you could request from un uh for you to be transferred from your where you are to another country I'm like how is that possible it's like yeah they can okay let's put Faith on it and uh go forward so uh but for un to act they have to have a proof material of proof that where you were at the time they cannot treat you so uh now it was another battle that opened up because I had to get a official document that testify that everything has been done there is no help for him here he has to go elsewhere that's when I start uh going after the chief uh physician of the the Congo the the Congo is like a like a chief of cabinet somebody who works in the Ministry of Health so who can provide a document but to get to them it's a big big process is like it's like going to see the president himself so we went back and forth with my physician he's like for to see him he's somebody who travels who he doesn't have time to see anybody like uh somebody like a patient no you have to to be somebody in the ring to see them like who can do go see him for me no nobody so we start praying so that God can make a way for me to see him so we prayed prayed prayed until at the end God opened the door again and uh we went to see this person he was just right after the minister of the health things like that so he uh I talked with him and then he wrote this letter which I brought to the UN and and uh explained to them that I then I WR I made the formal application demanding uh resettlement so uh for people who are familiar with the un u uh organization resettlement is when they decide to take you from one uh place resettle you to another place uh uh because of your safety or things like that so but this one was not going to be based on Health Care uh resettlement that's uh when um uh I cut this document and uh did the application but through these old things what I saw was like uh what helped me uh sustain uh what sustained me was more of broadly love I was caring from people in the church uh people who really embraced me like uh even though I didn't know anybody but they were there to support and everything so that's when I really and God helped a lot also so he said be still and know that I am God I will be exalted among the heaven I will be exalted in the Earth so the UN in Congo worked with a n n is uh I think you guys familiar with n is uh self organizations that works independently from the government so uh this NGO was called um uh medic fre who African Physicians or a physician from Africa something like that so this NGO was working with uh unhcr uh in a way that when there is refugees who are sick so un would give this people this uh patient to this NGO for them to take care of them and then do the report to the uh un uh for the financing purposes and then when I cut this letter from the doctor so un told these people to follow my case uh that they can go up to the end uh to get me approved for um resettlement but for some reason uh as you know when God is in the move the devil also is in the move so uh the devil was not happy so happy that the light was pointing at the end of the tel so uh some of the people in this NGO start putting blocks in the process until to the point that uh because when there is a request such like this the UN would uh present the case to countries who are in a partnership with them most of them is US Canada and European countries and Australia so they are in a partnership with un if un has refugees who need uh resettlement for safety reason or health reasons you will present the case to all these countries so there's one that is going to accept say okay we want this patient to come here and we can take care of them so my Cas was already sent out to the uh countries that would accept uh but at the same time I was just waiting for a delegation to come see me and we go from there but these people went on to tell the UN HCR that no he's healed he doesn't need any he care so no need for his settlement so like wow this is uh I got troubled because there was no way that could be true but uh at the same time uh in Exodus 14 13-4 it says and Moses says unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show you to you today for the Egypt Egyptian whom he have seen today he shall see them again no more forever for whereas ye have seen the Egyptian today the Lord shall fight for you and you shall see hold your peace so that's uh when God intervened again and uh I presented the case to the UN when uh uh when they told me that you are are healed and everything so I presented the facts and uh letter and everything so I told them that these people have to show you also the same evidence that uh some health authority showed them that I'm Healed so that you can decide uh so unfortunately for them they didn't have any material proof so that's when they got in big trouble after me actually when I left so because they wanted to uh interfere with the care of a patient so which is not good for business with un so um that's uh how uh the hand of God was showed again shown again in this situation so um through this all is not just saying I'm not saying it just to uh for some certain reason it's for somebody who might go be going through the same things or orse they may know that there is no thing that is impossible for God and if God has already uh made a way for you no matter what will arise uh God will come to the uh to the finishing of that purpose so that's in 2015 that's when I got here um from the Congo uh I was uh surprised to see that God had already prepared a new family not only uh physical or caral family also Christian family so I was there uh got a new family when I as soon as I landed from the airport I saw these people welcoming me whom I didn't know I didn't heard about them and everything and uh they took me right straight to their house and uh since then they've been like a family to me as you can see them over there they've been here a few times some of them and uh uh uh to show that even though I lost my parent early a in age didn't grow up with the feeling of being loved as a child and everything but this family showed me more than I could expect they really really love me more it go beyond I don't know if people who are raised with parent uh can feel that but if you have your parents say thank you to God because not having your parent early in age it's a feeling that only somebody who experienced that can explain but if you have parent please be thankful to God and say thank you um so this that's when I feel that feeling that people who have their parent can feel also is when I got uh this family because we have they believe some they believe they are Baptist they live believe something different I believe the message and we lived in the same house but we wouldn't know that we have different beliefs so they showed me real love so not only uh through with them I went through three other surgeries here as you know when I got here in 2015 I got a surgery in in uh June or uh in June that was just to control my infection and to get the bone I the leg to be able to work again because I've been on crotches for six years uh prior to that so um I get the first I got the first surgery they did uh were able to put a plate inside and control the infection and I was able to walk but we fa a shorter leg so I was uh liming so the only way for me to walk on my two feets or to have a lifted um heel yeah that big shoe I used to wear so that's how I was able to work uh and uh and also believe it or not that doctor that that that did that Sur told me that you'll be happy with this for rest of your life that's because there is no technology that can help you cow your leg again I'm like doesn't matter now I can walk that's all I wanted so but I didn't give up my uh my faith in the ability to walk on my uh both feet with same length because God when he start doing something he would not leave it unfinished he will go it to the end so this was already God in move so when he told me this I doubted but I'm like since he is the certified uh physician so I going to hold on that for now but I'll not give up fighting so uh God also intervene that he left that hospital then when I went for one of the follow up I met one of his assistant who took over him and uh presented him with the cas I'm like uh what's what are the possibilities to get my leg lengthen again he's like oh you know what uh actually there is this new technology that just got popular now it is that they can put a a rod inside your bone and get your I'm like is that really yes but at the time I was not uh I didn't have a good insurance because the government assur insurance is selective there is certain cases that they don't they don't cover and but at the time I was still on government insurance but I was in school I'm like for now my purpose is to finish school get uh private insurance and I have to get this thing done and God also intervened through the schools I finished and uh went back to him and uh he said um we can do it but I'm not very experienced in this domain but I know somebody who is more experienced than me uh that can help you I'm like okay um you can refer me to them he said yes uh he happened to be that he worked at the uh uh University Hospital and uh at this time I was I was already applying the job at the uh and I can't accept that uh and the same time I can't accept at the uh that's the same time I went to see this doctor that was a specialist and uh he said yes he can do it uh but I had to be like one year at work before I can leave for like medical reasons and things like that so one year later he was able to do the surgery and put in the rod uh to lengthen the leg so uh which was another miracle because uh putting a rod in your bone that is going to craw to make your leg leg longer is something I've never heard of so for me it was hand of God again so it's something to be thankful to God so that's why I testify that God he can heal by Miracles um but he can also heal by the hand of mens but through all the glory come back to him am so um and last year that's when when they were able to take out the rod out of my bone so I have my both legs same length I can walk actually uh so actually I can challenge anyone to you to a Race So that but is to say that God is faithful God who amen who whose eyes are on The Sparrows he watches us so that's why I want really to be thankful because in through all this also God provided people that were there to support so it is oh is the battery okay of on Okay so this is the family that supported me throughout this process again through prayers encouragement uh it's more valuable than anything I can uh count on so it is uh with uh all all of my heart I say thank you to each one and each of you for all the effort you've done supporting me through the prayers through the enouragement everything uh I I can't call names here it's going to be too much so God bless you it's uh been a good um support and uh all the this is also another testimony that not knowing English not being out being out of school for so long and being able to come back study finish and start working it's not that I'm very smart now far from that God helped me through also your support so I really want to say thank you to you uh for all that uh so as I said here from patient to caregiver so I was cared for for so many years so now God has given me the opportunity to care for other people amen so it's uh those are the testimony so we need just to trust in God in everything that's uh because there is without all without God all this will not be able to from the human uh conception it's almost impossible but seeing what God has made has done we have more reason to trust him so it's uh um God the things I've said here that God has done in my life uh he can do it to each and everyone if you trust in him in the same way because brother Bram says here um for the first part of Psalms there he says our fathers trust in thee they trust and thou deliver uh Juds delivered them they cried onto thee and were delivered they trust in thee and were not confounded so God will never let you down for any reason so brother Braham said on went on to say listen to this if God doesn't act the same when this uh uh when the same circumstances AR arise then God is guilty of being partial to his people God's sovereignty demand demand uh sovereignty demands of him to walk in every case like he did the first case or he was wrong when he walked in the first case if God doesn't act in the same way he did the same way he did on the first case he will if he will act different to the second case then he acted wrong when he acted on the first case if God healed the sick in the Old Testament is cut to do in the New Testament and today or he did wrong when he healed them back there he is Hebrews chapter 45 got to act the same every time and he will do it when the same Faith meets the condition the fault is in us not in God for we see him on some and many work many work create outstanding Miracles we know it the critic cannot say it's not so for we see it amen uh prove it and there it is so it is uh God is uh is not partial amen as if your faith meets the same demand same requirement God will act so um it is um that's the point of this testimony so um he it for me he will keep doing it what he has done is what I have said here is just little part so many other things I could say but the purpose of time I have to stop here and want to say keep trusting God is able to do anything so God bless you for all your prayers and all your support I hope uh I'll keep getting uh strength from all this testimonal as well God bless you we just stand I just want to sing song sing with our voices Ben if you just want to jump on the piano real quick let's sing this song and then I'm going to ask brother Josh way to pray if you've got a need or request on your heart I I think about how when brother brandham talked about the the mother when she was led of the Lord to pray for the little child and she prayed and brother brandham when that lady came with a baby up to the platform the Holy Spirit announced that your baby was already healed when that sister prayed for him and brother bradam he pointed out to us and he said what it is he said that mother that sister was a mother she would have more of a compassion and a sympathy and been able to reach for that child than what I would and I believe that was same thing with each of us as we've gone through certain things and we hear request mentioned that is a testimony that's not just what God has brought us through but it's a witness what God has done for one he'll do for another and God puts you and I into a place to where we're able to step into the shoes and pray for one another that's right so every every circumstance test trial so forth It's Not only God molding and making us but it's where we come more in tune to be more of an intercessor as a spiritual priest for one another I want to just sing this song just just the course one time through you made a way
