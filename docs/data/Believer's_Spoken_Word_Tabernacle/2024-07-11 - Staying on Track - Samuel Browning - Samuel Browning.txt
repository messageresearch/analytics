into your hands and we ask oh God for every need now Lord you would meet everyone according to your word in Jesus precious name amen and amen amen amen thank you musicians let's look here in the scriptures of Matthew uh chapter 14 I'm going to skip right there and and not read from job we've as a congregation we've been uh pulling from there and I think perhaps tonight I may be turning a corner on this with fear so you uh that are what I think but you know there's a lot of this here I didn't even anticipate months ago so it's just wonderful to be led by the Lord because it's all about God coming and ministering to our needs and God it just shows that here God can take right from his word the word is just as inspired tonight as what it was when the inspiration fell upon the writers and if that same inspiration can strike our heart tonight and we can move into that why we every everything that we have need of it's in him and it's already finished and we just desire one thing God let our faith rise to be able to to see him and claim what belongs to us and receive it in our lives Amen in Matthew 14:22 and the scripture said and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water now I want you to notice this here is the word coming in their midst and now they've recognized the word who he is it is I Be not Afraid now Peter in the presence of the word of God the word made flesh the Lord Jesus bid me to come to thee and he says come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but verse 30 when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and begin beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me incredible the first part of the verse he he he he did he did the worst thing he could do get his eyes off Jesus but the last part of that verse he did the greatest thing that any person could say say Lord save me that's right yes sir uh we could say amen glory be to God and and close it tonight immediately Dre Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore didst thou doubt and when they were coming into the ship the wind seized and then they were in the in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the son of God amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I just uh in looking at this thought and uh in overcoming fear and its effects and we've looked at a lot of these points within here I remember it was job who said the things which I feared had greatly come upon me things I feared greatly had come upon me and this is what really was just pulsating through my heart as I've looked at this and had this before me now for for months and just kind of looking over these things and just waiting you know within the thoughts and as God continues to build things and this is really a thought that's just so pulsating here upon my heart in this moment and that is just really staying on track staying on track and I how many enjoyed the service on Sunday amen with brother rap and I tell you we certainly were blessed and uh I think for sure if you've never seen or uh beheld a teacher Ministry you saw a real teacher there on Sunday that's a real teacher and so we so appreciate that and I really appreciate brother rap and uh my I I enjoyed that um uh that service I enjoyed what the Lord had to say to us and you know uh there's nothing new that God is going to say to us but I'm so glad for all the perspectives that God brings because when any perspective that's of God we're going to see Jesus Christ to be the same but there's things the way God will take things and just you know like brother B says a teacher will take it and just take nuggets polish them don't really explain them so much just polish and go on and go on and just kind of moves through so quickly and and that how God just so took the gift and I appreciate it because I know uh we were certainly blessed in our hearts amen you know every little every little thing that takes place in our life along the way it's it's to increase our walk with God that we would go forward and so when we look here in the scripture and and thinking of this thought I want to just say it in this way that when we think of a vision and you know uh a man one of the brothers that asked brother Branham said brother brandham I would just ask that you would pray that God would let me see a vision and brother Bram put his arm around the brother and he said brother he said every time that you open the Bible you see a vision he said when when you open the Bible he said just ask God to speak to you and say Lord speak to my heart because he said every time we open the Bible we see a vision and that's a thing that we want our eyes to be I want my eyes to be so Anointed with the holy spirit it's things that I'm not trying to see or you're not trying to see but just to be in tune with God that we can see and as God would Inspire his word and and we can see him and as he ministers to our life and you know brother Bram he he takes it in this way when we're looking at Faith and he'll take of this this portion all throughout the message and in the message perfect faith and he'll he'll deal with this but I'll say this with any Vision we always are are know that for sure that every vision and every Spirit every gift must always speak according to the word if it doesn't speak according to the word and you know it isn't about that you or I have to be I believe the Bible says study to show ourselves approved but you know it might be something that you might not be able to put your finger on but the prophet said in the message thirst 1965 he said if there's something a little off he said there's that that on the inside he said it will say something is just not right about this and so this is where we're relying upon the holy spirit we're not relying Upon Our Own reasonings not re relying upon flesh but we're relying upon Christ who is the word because the holy spirit is not not different person it's the word himself inside of you and so when we think of this and you know so every time when something comes from God and when when the word of God speaks to you and it's received faith is activated in the word of God not a feeling not an emotion or anything outside of the word of God because faith can only find its resting place in the word of God you say why do you say that because your feeling and your emotion can leave you after the service is over but where what has to be is that there is a faith that'll stand in the word of God that no matter when the enemy comes and would like to try to knock the confidence out of you that God has instilled In You by his word you have to stand on the word and not your feelings not your emotions Hey listen it's a wonderful thing when God speaks to us it's a wonderful thing as his presence moves over us but the whole reality is that our faith would be positioned in the word of God so much so to where us and the word are not separate but the promise that we have need of and what God sees we have need in our life we now become veiled in that word and as the prophet said we're in the word looking out by eyes of faith and see it already as a finished work because faith has only one resting place faith has only one place that it can work worship and that's in the word of God so within this of Faith you know we might have certain feelings but they're all secondarily to the word of God and so it's the word of God that's lasting it holds within it transforming power it's the word of God that comes to loosen us from Fear because fear is a lack of confidence it's a lack of confidence and this is what the word of God comes to do is cast out fear is to Deliver Us From Fear God does not want any one of his children to live below their Privileges and that would be to walk in fear you might say well I have this in my family or I have this but if you look to the word of God you cannot find one place in the word of God where there is a such a thing as this promise but for you it's this way you find everything in the word of God that's yay and amen amen and this is where we rest is within the word of God not our feelings so it leads us to a place of supreme confidence in the word of God where the finished were in that finished work of Calvary and I want you to think of how the prophet he would say it like this how that remember the little boy that was in Finland that was raised up remember that and remember a brother Bram I always like how this is I just just really pondering on this remember brother Bram told him he said to write it down and he said write it in the fly Lea of your Bible and so you remember even the prophet himself you know looking and beholding uh when they were in Finland and I I don't really want to get caught up in the story but I want to just say it in this way God had given a vision years before that there was a little boy in somewhere that was going to be raised up you know when the prophet saw that event he didn't even realize what was happening they stopped and all of a sudden when he got into to a place and a position he begin to notice the pine trees and and begin to notice the trees and he's the one who sent Jack Moore and he said go get your Bible go get your Bible see what's written in there because he begin to recognize I I've seen this somewhere I I've seen this surrounding somewhere and the prophet said when that begin to line up this is what he said he said you can line up every demon out of hell and it could not stop that word from coming to pass now think of that that's a vision the prophet would say like this in perfect Faith he said that's God speaking in this day by a vision but he says if that Vision was contrary to this he says then that would be wrong this is more this is more than the vision if any Visions contrary to the word leave it alone it ain't of God God don't contradict his one word amen so what was the purpose here of the message coming to you and I was not to wear that even around brother brandham and brother brandham himself you you hear it through the message through 1950s and on through even through 1963 he says the whole purpose of the message I I tried to get the people to recognize they don't need a certain person to lay hands on them and and they he said but I failed within that he said if you can just recognize it's Jesus Christ in our midst the the holy spirit is anointing the word he said let him lay his hands on you and the work is finished now he wasn't doing away with altar calls he wasn't doing away with laying hands on the sick because that's part of the Bible is that right there's times where we need our faith inspired there's times where we need and we join our faith together so I just say it like this if I've got a need in my life I'm not going to ask God to come on a certain way I want to come on his plane and if God calls and says listen I I want you to go forward I want there's going to be hands laid upon you that's steal the word of God it takes faith in God's word for it said if there be any sick among you let them call for the Elders of the church if there be any sin it shall be forgiven them let them anoint them with oil and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and God shall raise them up the Bible said in Mark 16 they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover yes but this is where we're this is where we're at that even with the word itself now I want you to notice how the prophet takes this there's just this these words as he says this here in perfect Faith the very next statement I didn't put this one up there but he says if this word or maybe I did if this word told you something catch that if this word told you something then you can have the same confidence that that's what's going to happen if it if it says they shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover if faith that perfect Faith got a hold of that you'd pass by this prayer line jumping and shouting when you left here it's over it's over it's all finished so what if somebody doesn't jump and shout it doesn't mean that they didn't have perfect Faith perfect faith is a saddness if there's an emotion based on anything else it's wrong it should be on the joy of the Lord there might be somebody walk through and they're just crying and just say thank you Lord because of how they're made up but they have a settl it's over it's finished I heard God I heard the word say to me and here you you quote the scripture well you're just quoting a scripture No but this is the word and the word said to me that's why you're setting in a service or maybe here you are in devotion or here you are walking through the week and here the holy Spirit the word of God will speak to your heart you have a need in your life and it'll speak to your life that this promise is for you that that healing is for you and the Lord that Health all thy diseases you might have memorized that verse but when the Lord speaks that to you that's a direct word from from almighty God when he says the Holy Ghost is for you that's a direct word from God it's a promise but now the word has spoke to you personally hallelujah hallelujah that's how we walk by faith is the word taking the word I say tonight it ought to be When We Gather here Lord I want the word to speak to me Lord I want the word to speak to my life amen I want to be moved and inspired and and walking on with that word so notice when they they cried out when they saw that what they thought was a spirit but here the word settles them and the word has that effect to settle us that's good we can have a lot of wonderings of what's this or what's that but listen the word will always correct the air the word will always settle listen that's why the that's what the gospel came to do the gospel has never and never does produce anxiousness the gospel doesn't produce depression that's right you see this is where this is where when the enemy can take a hold of things and and want to try to and and getting our eyes over here and maybe I'm missing over here and I I'm missing out on something or I'm this and it just it gets us in such a place but the word never ever comes to trouble Our Lives the word comes to settle us hallelujah now notice the Bible says that in Hebrews 11:1 faith is the substance anything we do we must do it in faith if we don't do it in faith it's un un belief right so it all is by faith and the Bible tells us that the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith unto Faith so and and it's un it's impossible to please God without faith now Faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen now I want you to notice when Peter here he he sees the Lord and he ask him bid me to come unto thee unto the water you know that's that's like when you could be sitting right in a service and here the word is beginning to speak and you say Lord speak to me Lord speak to my need Lord speak to my situation now he's already calmed one fear where they were afraid now here Peter after that fear has been dismissed now he says bid me to come unto you why the word has got to speak unto me I don't want to just resume I don't want to venture without Authority I don't want to imagine it I want the word to speak to my heart the word that comes and speaks to My Life deals with my heart and draws upon my life and the word said come is that right and he be to walk on the water going to Jesus now then the Bible tells us that in verse 30 when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid now fear had begin to set in now I want you to notice this how that the prophet places it in perfect Faith Peter was doing all right until he got scared this same word come is just like Mark 16 which I quoted James 5 which we quoted on laying hands on the sick it's the same Word of Promise that God you know God is able to inspire that word to our heart listen friends let me just let me just say it in this way the things that I'm speaking on here tonight on overcoming fear and its effects and staying on track it's about staying in a place where God is able to come and to inspire you by his word Satan's objective is to move you out of the channel of inspiration he don't care how much you you could you could you could come to church you could s around he doesn't care how much as long as he can stop up that channel but when the channel is open and and it's available for inspiration how many knows that job he was a prophet God spoke to him by inspiration but yet God did not let job know what was going on and that inspiration he wasn't receiving was worrying him now you and I have the benefit to know that what God even in this hour our flesh can get troubled when we don't have answers for certain things but we know him who is the answer this is why as a father as a husband on and on you don't have to have all the answers you have to be in contact with him and know him who is the answer he has he is the answer for every situation in our life the word is applicable we may not see it we may not know it we may not understand it but we want the grace of God to stay stable and steadfast and holding to the word even when we don't understand and being a channel that inspir ation can drop at any time now I want you to look at this with Peter here I think it's paragraph 107 here where the Prophet says there was that storm that was up upon the sea and it was a terrific thing here he is Peter maybe it was in paragraph 109 that that's where it's at and the B brother BR says this he said Peter he stepped down and he said it's the Lord I'll just walk but when he got his eyes on the way he got scared what come into his mind the first thing this is what the first thing was I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk see the word does not bypass our mind the word comes through our mind this is even where Satan came to Eve to lead her astray he first began to move upon her mind and she received it in her mind this is why when even the new birth and here coming to Mary she was troubled in her mind but the word came to settle her to bring her to a place of yielding Us in the word that when as she could receive the word then the holy spirit will finish the work that he has started in your life this is why the word it can't just be something in our mind but yet it starts with receiving the word in our mind but as we will water that word as we will water and receive that word that word will drop from here to there that's not your job to do that that's his job that's what he promised that he would do is that all right first thing this is what Peter said I'm going to walk on the water because the word said not because it makes sense but the word has said that I'm to walk on the water and this is what I'm going to do but then the next thing the prophet said he looked at his symptoms right yeah he looked out there and seen how big them waves was and he got scared and when he did he went down what was the fault where was the failure when he got his eyes off the word let me tell you every one of us sitting in here tonight no matter where you're at in your Christian walk with God your strength your success and and the blessing upon your life is keeping your eyes on the word of God when Elisha was was was was directed there and the mantle came across his life it's just like when the Holy Spirit takes a hold of a life and they begin to repent of their sins begin to seek after God how could you and I seek after God if God hadn't come and knocked on our hearts is that right but Elisha notice he be he burns every bridge behind him he separates from all unbelief let me tell you something you don't need a prophet to tell you everything that's wrong in your life right amen are you hearing me the word of God the prophet the holy spirit is still here and there's things listen if you'll step out in faith the word has said this the word said I'm to dress like this the word said I'm to forsake this the word said I'm to lay that down if you'll keep your eyes on the word it will take you through to Victory and the thing that once mastered and ruled your life you will now rule it H Hallelujah Peter got to looking at the waves Glory my he looking I mean the wind is blowing conditions I mean let alone you're walking on water but then the conditions right the conventions became tumultuous oh my they were they weren't they weren't listen who who's Ever Walked on Water besides the Lord Jesus then put conditions with it the conditions did not Merit even a stroll down a sidewalk boisterous wind a storm let alone walking on the water but you see what mattered was is the word had spoke to his heart you know God can take a heart and a life and speak to that heart they might read a track it may not even be they picked up the Bible at first but there's been a track that's been written and that track they begin to recognize and think where am I what is my purpose what am I doing here what what why am I here why is my life this way you know God could inspire a person to ride a track like that here's the end result is the same God that could Inspire it that way that will cause you to reflect in that way if you'll yield to him the spirit of truth will take you into all the truth which is the person of Jesus Christ himself he'll take you all the way God takes you and I all the way it's up to us Lord just keep me on track Lord notice what he feared happened he got to looking at the waves and the conditions and what he feared happened what he believed happened and when he believed he could walk he walked when he believed and got scared in his belief then his substance left him faith is the substance of things hoped for but when he got to looking at the way the substance left him are you hearing me this is why it's very important listen this is very important why the prophet said that you want to make sure you don't yoke up and cutan me up with unbelievers you might say well my spouse is not a Believer that's not what we're talking about we're talking about being completely identified with Jesus Christ let me tell you something you I tell you God can bring it in such a way through the book of Peter Paul laid it down in the book of Corinthians that you can live such a salty and a sweet swe life and a character of Jesus Christ through your life that will cause your husband or your wife to take notice there's something different here and this is a real Christian let me tell you something Satan is always in the business of trying to put fear in the hearts when it comes to God's word cuz he knows the power of this word working in a life of a Believer and when that word begins to work in a life you become a display of God's grace and this gospel will walk in shoe leather with places that it may never have got to before but you become a living witness of the grace of almighty God you can underestimate yourself but don't ever underestimate the word of [Applause] God oh friends I'm talking about God's word then his substance left him he still professed his faith the prophet said but he didn't have the substance that substance would have went right over top of the white cap and went right onto him if he has the perfect face but he didn't have it he thought he did he did at first notice he did at first he didn't swim out he had substance Faith but when he got to looking in other things right this is why the prophet said when you are healed don't go out in company with unbelievers where they're my friends or they're my buddy let me just say this to you there ain't no buddies or friends in Hell job said hell is naked there ain't no ain't no such things as my buddies and my friends this is why that within this right here you always want to evaluate every relationship in your life is is it adding value in your life or taking value from your life the word will never take value or devalue your life but the word will always bring value to your life because the word itself is the very character of almighty God hallelujah hallelujah and here his substance it begin to leave him it begin to it begin to move out as he begin to look at other things this is why brother BR says associate with people who believe like you believe that's why sometimes you might be able to talk to somebody at work and there's a good conversation and then maybe the next day here they are are and man I mean it's just a mess of what's going on you know at that time as a Son of God you excuse yourself cuz you realize this is not an atmosphere that's Fit For A Son of God to dwell in the Bible said cast not your pearls before swi you are not called to prove anything it is God who proves his word through your life so don't let the devil beat you up and run you down you are called to be an example and God will prove his word and does through your life amen but he lost that he he had Faith at first and he was willing to venture out W the Lord told me to do it it's got to happen so he steps down right out of the boat and takes off he never thought about it the waves and how contrary they would he never got that in his mind but when you get to thinking well now wait you know I've been sick so long the prophet said stop you might as well go back to the boat but when you quit thinking about that you say brother Samuel what am I I've been sick for so long or maybe I battled this besetting sin so long or I've carried this weight for so long and I've tried to overcome it but you know what what you need to do is like Peter when you see the word in our midst and he's dealing with your life ask the word bid me to come to you and don't take your eyes off the word that's Hallelujah the word will dismiss manle every fear the word will dismantle all unbelief the word will cause a confession to come from in here that will cast out anything that's unlike the word of God hallelujah the word has cleansing power within it Jesus said sanctify them through Thy word Thy word is true and we are washed with the washing of Water by the word hallelujah as we surrender as we submit the word it cleans oh my you might as well go back to the boat but when you quit thinking about that that's where Satan battles friends is right in our thoughts he knows if he can just maybe get one little thought or one little thing and try to cool you down a little bit just settle you down a little bit that's all he's interested in doing he just wants to get your eyes off of the one who is the word and I tell you what when you get your eyes on yourself you're in trouble when you get your eyes on your symptoms you're in trouble because let me tell you something you and I here we are in a natural body but as Sons and Daughters of God we are of the supernatural almighty God we are Sons and Daughters of God by the spirit of God that's dwelling in us this on the outside this ain't the real Samuel it only Bears the resemblance of that which is on the inside that's why the prophet said you've never seen seen the real William brandom the Will William brandom is that which is on the inside this only Bears the image and the reflection just like that wall takes those words that's good Hallelujah so as being there of Supernatural people we are called it called to battle against those Supernatural forces now you and I listen just our own thinking won't do it but our thinking has got to be the word isn't it amazing sometimes we how Satan wants to so pile things on and M we come out and we think man I got a clear week ahead of me and all of a sudden there is so many things that come your way they're not even on your reminders list you don't even have bells set for him on your calendar but it comes your way and and it's just things that you know can just begin to so bombard your mind until your mind itself it's just trying to take your vision away from the word of God W that's Satan that's one of his tactics is to try to do that because if we get our eyes off the word then that's where we lose our Victory now watch this Abraham I love this I I I love this in the word and the prophet quotes this scripture out of out of Romans 4 Abraham considered not his own body now dead neither the deadness of Sarah's womb he watch this he didn't think about it didn't even consider it now let's look at this for a minute he didn't think about it do you think that the thought didn't come through his mind sure it did Abraham how do you want your oats this morning honey huh you think the thought you think the thought didn't come the thoughts came but he didn't dwell on [Applause] it the word itself is what cast that that thought out brought it in obedience to the word that was already spoken yes sir watch this he didn't even consider it that means to dwell and come into the Mind's Eye focus upon it it wasn't even brought to the understanding why because the Bible said who against hope believed in hope that he might be the father of many nations the expectation was there you're not going to get any younger there's nothing going to change in your life there's no condition but he believed in Hope why how did he have hope because Faith Delivered to him an expectation God has said that I would be a father of many nations and he's revealed that Sarah is the channel that's right I know in our minds we think when I when I read this I go over and I appreciate these things in the scripture Genesis 17 the Bible said when God told him you're going to bury it ain't going to be Ishmael it's going to be through Sarah it's going to be Isaac and the Bible said he laughed right that's where you get Isaac's name he laughed now but you don't find that in the New Testament you don't find that you find in Romans 4 he staggered not at the promise of God he was strong giving praise to God but here in the Old Testament it allows you to see that Humanity but it begins to show you in the New Testament that God has never ever considered our Humanity he knows we are but flesh but he is the remedy he's the one that gives us strength to where you and I can say how could I have laughed how could I have doubted but it's something down on the inside of you as a real son and daughter of God that's magnetized to the promise of God to believe God above every circumstance Hall my it wasn't even in understanding if you talked to Abraham you might have thought he was living in denial remember he was making payments on the baby are you hearing me this is why the needs you've got in your life you need to start making payments on it payments how do I make payments on it begin to say Thank You Lord thank you for the promise maybe it's the promise of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord for the Holy Ghost thank you Lord God for healing in my life thank thank you for deliverance Lord you need to begin to thank God for the promise because the truth is it's already a finished work it's just our faith raising to that place oh notice he didn't even consider it all he just considered what God Said and went on as long as Peter did that he walked amen this is the same Peter that said at Thy word amen I'll let down the net amen right it was Elijah that said on Mount Carmel I've done all this at Thy word right you see you always want to make sure that what you're doing is according to the word of God the word the Bible tells us in Hebrews 12 and verse 2 looking unto Jesus who's the author and finisher of our faith I thought that was beautiful and so such a uh an incredible point on Sunday I know it's very simple but it's very true even when we're coming for any request that we have don't look for anything else but Jesus I like that that's good well my friend did this you don't want to do what your friend did cuz you're just an impersonator you want to get your eyes on Jesus is keep your eyes on him looking you have besetting sin you have weights remember then how do we loosen this the Bible said lay them aside but notice we receive our strength and our confidence the molding and and making and perfecting of our life by looking unto Jesus you know how powerful it is to see the Lord Jesus to look to him you may not even see everything already in your life but if you can clutch a glimpse of him you can stand like Paul wrote it in the book of Hebrews and said we see not all things but we see Jesus why he is the end of all things Hallelujah I see him I see the Messiah Among Us I see his sign Among Us I see him vindicating his word I may not understand it all but I know it's him I know he's touching my life I may not see everything but I see him therefore we look not at things that are seen But at things that are unseen right is that right cuz the things that are seen are temporal your symptoms are temporal your conditions are temporal your failures are temporal mistakes are temporal your shortcomings are temporal come on Friends your fears are temporal but that which is of the Unseen is eternal I'm talking about the word of God that will give you strength in this [Applause] life yes [Music] sir my symptoms themselves that's the greatest brother brandom called it like this symptoms I'm just trying to get somewhere to tie this together here symptoms is the worst enemy because God has to fight against symptoms symptoms listen you know why cuz symptoms are something tangible I feel this I sense this there they seem so real nobody's saying that they're not real God never told never said about those 10 that came back saying there were giants over there he never said you guys are liars ain't no Giants over there but you don't find Caleb and Joshua talking about Giants are you hearing me I don't know if brother rap said it here when we were fellowshipping there on Sunday but I I like how it was put but he said he said you know he said here those 10 those 10 uh spies they brought the Giants in the camp by their conversation right they talked about him until it was wailing in every house wow is you see fear spreads like wildfire yeah it'll spread they they had a morning session every home was mour by their testimony are you hearing me their testimony brought Giants and nobody else saw it brought them present what about Believers where the word of God is pulsating in our heart that we can bring Jesus Christ present to know that I'm Healed I'm delivered I'm free because the word has said so it's finished at Calvary the death blow has been dealt has a Believer called to bring Jesus presence to call him on the scene hallelu Abraham you're a little Hunchback how many years now it's greater Miracle what' you say I said greater Miracle it was already a miracle when he called me and got a hold of my life drew me away from my family gave me breathed into my life a real strength and give me a peace he even guided me through everything give me Grace to separate from my daddy from lot all along the way he gave me Grace that even when I filtered he gave me Grace to rise back up again thank you Lord matter fact you talking about a miracle I am a [Applause] miracle he maybe couldn't shout like he used to shout but his soul was still on [Applause] fire hallelujah look at you oh it's a greater Miracle but look you you can't even you can't even father children no more stream of life is dried up but it's a greater Miracle look at Sarah's life it's a greater miracle now let's get back here to Peter here try to bring this together you know Peter he didn't get out of the boat and try to look for a bridge you know sometimes we we can look at the word and we're trying to find out how H how's it going to be we don't have to worry about the how that's true you know if you just take those three letters of how and move them around you'll recognize it's the greatest thing you can see is who yeah it's not how it's who who it is that's speaking unto you not the how you you how and the brother Ram told us like this he said that wasn't Abraham's business how it's going to happen it ain't your business ain't my business it ain't my business to watch how God he'll change and transform my life I don't know how he does it but I know he does it he did it for me and I've watched him change other lives I don't need to know the mechanics of it I just know the Dynamics of it it works the word works [Applause] how many witnesses with me on that Peter didn't go looking for a bridge you know some underwater prop how can I walk over here now he's already made me to come how am I going to get there he he he didn't even look for that you know what God had asked him to do something he had never done before God might be asking you to do something you've never done before but if you'll listen to the word the word will take you and direct you all the way through amen come on friends when God got a hold of Our Lives it doesn't matter if you were raised in a message church when God got a hold of our life it's a new walk it's a new way things begin to change about our life like Ruth coming back into the land our dress begins to change we're conforming to the word of God our language begins to change why because the grace of God in the land is dealing with our life we're walking among people rubbing shoulders among people that we never thought we would be in the midst of before but here in the presence of God we are walking in accordance to God's word and God will see us through Hallelujah Peter how you going to how's this going no Peter that was not even in his mind he wasn't in his mind how are you going to make it through this how are you going to get over this how are you going to the word has said come I think that's powerful friends cuz we can set in the service and the word of God can move right among us and we can close our Bibles and get up out of church and nothing this is why when the word of God and the spirit of God is moving you need to have some dialogue with his presence when the spirit of God is moving and speaking you need to say Lord pass by my way blind barus had a need he knew he was coming by and blind barus said thou son of David have mercy on me be quiet boy be quiet be quiet we don't do that around here be quiet he crowed the louder it wasn't because of his loud screaming his faith his faith stopped the master and that's the same thing right in this service as we come to the house of God let me tell you something you might have only a speck of Faith but if you'll let that Speck of Faith go tonight and say God come Lord speak to my heart speak to my life Lord consume my life Lord take this out of my life if you lay it out like that watch God come by let me tell you that's why we don't come to the house of God to be entertained I wonder what brother Samuel's got to say tonight wonder what brother ion's got to say tonight wonder what brother so and so's got to say tonight when I've come here to the house of God I have come to receive from God I'm here to say Lord speak to my needs Lord speak to my life Lord Speak Lord I want the word to speak to my heart that's the TR cuz there's some boats we need to get out of are you hearing me there's some situations we need to walk out of there's some hurts we need to walk out of there's some unbelief we need to walk out of there's some sin we need to walk out of there's some depression we need to walk out of and we need to ask the word Speak to My Heart Lord but when he got his eyes on the waves see when you get out don't take him put your eyes back on your circumstance well the doctor said I might have this the that's the best of his knowledge when he says you might have that the rest of your life but there's another report that says by his stripes you are healed there's another report I'm the Lord that Health all thy diseases there's another report that says he is still that ever present God who can be placed in the waters of the bitterness of sickness and situation and he will sweeten the Waters of marrow hallelujah hallelujah there's a barrier we got to pass that barrier you get out there and walk in that bar wants to push against you wants to push against you I'm trying to do go back to the ship go back to the ship go back to your Realms of being Comfort go back into that place let me tell you if God call if the word called you out then the word is there to see you all the way through it'll take you all the way through let me tell you something the same God that has taken a hold of your life and transform your life is the same God that can take a hold of a loved one's life and transform it let me tell you what the prophet said in the message Paradox he said you can take a man that's sitting in a meeting like this and criticize it he said you watch God take a hold of that man that man will become the biggest testimony that God has of the power of God why God takes a hold of that man so good hallelujah hallelujah we just want to listen and we want to take the word now let me let me get down on this now now let me narrow it down on this staying on track and sometimes we got to get back on track remember the prophet in the vision of the Bride in the preview yes she was walking and step but she got her eyes on the church world right got her eyes on and she just was watching them go and go and oh my how bad it's getting well the Bible said when you begin to see these things lift up your head for your Redemption draws nigh in other words don't become the chief political expert on things don't become the expert on all this well brother brother Samuel the prophet said where do plant potatoes till he come that's true but he didn't tell you to become a potato expert he didn't tell you to set up shop at at the I Center on how to grow all these varieties of of potatoes and what that is talking about you commit every need physical need but don't ever let your physical needs be put before your spiritual needs your heavenly father knows exactly what you have need of the Bible said seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added unto you how many know that's the truth truth that's God's word so sometimes notice I love how brother Ram takes this in desperation he said of how Peter he said You know here he was he got he got scared and he says like this he says though a mistake in trying to follow the Commandments of God now not that he was mistaken for following the word of God but he made a mistake by getting his eyes off the word right is that right the man man was doing what God told him to do he said now you Christian tonight you're in the line of duty trying to follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and a cancer grabs you death grabs you a cancer tubercular whatever it is in the line of duty you have the same right that Peter had Lord save me or I'll perish in desperation he called out and a hand reached and picked him up you have the same thing but he screamed out save me Lord he heard my despairing cry from the Waters Lifted Me Now safe am I that's it when you cry out hallu well I'm just going to have I'm just going to have faith let me tell you something if you're sinking that's a time of humility to say Lord save me you know that's Faith come on somebody well you know you you shouldn't have to have hands laid on you that's the word of God yes amen are you hearing me sometimes we've got ways that we're trying to make God come on our terms and we've got a come according to God's word if you want a miracle you have to follow the word amen are you hearing me now this is why the greatest Miracle has Our Sister Christina walked into this water she is walking into this water and God has given the instructions of repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you do what the word says first and then the miracle will follow the word is that right Hallelujah put your faith in the word I don't care how many times you've tried I don't care listen friends this is where you need to say God I'm tired of using My Own Strength I'm going to surrender my strength to the word because if you'll surrender to the word the holy spirit is the enforcer he'll take you to the Holy Ghost he'll take you to your healing he'll take you to every Divine promise that he's made yes he will you cry out brother Braham said it like this maybe it's a woman mother whatever it is a little son grandson nephew whatever it is cried out in dispay got heard he said but then we find out in the sinking God heard him and in the line of duty he started to sink he failed no matter if you fail that don't have one thing to do with it we all fail we're a failure to begin with we got somebody standing now with a strong hand who can reach us and take us above the water thank you Father if you've made a mistake some woman made a mistake some man made a mistake some boy or girl made a mistake don't sink scream out in despair Save Me Lord or I'll perish get desperate about it God will hear you he always hears a desperate Soul remember desperate is not to be in a point of Despair desperate are you listening to me now desperate is to be sincere yeah can I have just a few more moments the Bible I'm I'm just trying to drop to sin on getting back on track this isn't you know God just comes down and Pats us on the back God's interested in you living in Victory God's interested in you and me walking on track are you hearing me he he gave his word and his word is to every generation now when sickness came in or sin came into the camp of Israel in numbers 21 the Bible says in verse 7 the people came to Moses and they said said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee first thing they recognize they're wrong are you hearing me now we're talking about getting back on track they recognized they were wrong they prayed unto the Lord that he take away the serpents from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make thee a fiery serpent set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten when he lookth upon it shall live not just to look on it just to say my my there it is but look at is able to see the end of that poison able to see the end of that snake bite you know how he's able to see it you see sometimes we got too much in our way we can't see clearly amen well what I have to do you got to there has to be a sincere confession get everything out of the way amen they said we have sinned against the Lord and we sinned against you Moses they confess their sin Let Me Tell You Friend friends that is the greatest thing that Satan has wanted to take from the Church of the Living God and I'm going to say it I think it's something he's wanted to take from the message ranks it's been put to such a place where this where this let me tell you you've got to follow the Divine prescription that God has laid out we are sons of God but we got to come according to the word and the word is the path back into the Homeland we never are above the word of Acts 238 is that right quoting right out of the message indictment just as it's coming we've got a path right back into sunship right through the word so if there's anything in our life we want to get it out now Peter himself here's confession was Lord forgive me I got my eyes on symptoms I got my eyes off the word there's repentance right there save me I got my eyes on my own circumstance Lord forgive me I got in my eyes and had my own pity party we got quiet now but I'm talking about Victory and Liberty in our life am so you want to be able to look and see the end of that you want to be able to see the end of the Tormentor you want to see the end the Bible said you should see the desire upon your enemy are you hearing me you want to have clear eyesight you can eyes can't be clear as long as there's unconfessed sin you've got to get sin confess and get it out oh brother Samuel you know I don't ever sin the Bible said whosoever said he didn't sin is a liar he's deceived this is why Paul said I got to Die daily I'm not talking about a loose life but we realize sometimes we've entertained the wrong thought sometimes we've even said the wrong things and sometimes it isn't even what we've said we've reacted on thoughts that have come into our mind that is no more of God than nothing Hallelujah Lord have mercy we want to look on this we want to look on this serpent that's already been judged sin is judged I don't have to live with it any longer you can tell the devil tonight you might have rode in my car with me but you got to find another way [Applause] home you might have come here tonight but you ain't going home with me not in my car buddy you're not welcome in my home you're not welcome in my life hallu that is so good and when they beheld The Serpent of brass they lived they looked at it in the right way they received the virtue that the word had given they received it in their life and you know what it did it took care of every of every venomous every venomous symptom it took care of every symptom of the poison of that of unbelief and sin it takes care of it let me tell you something I do not worry about when I take medicine oh my little Aon when I take medicine I don't try to figure it out it's this going to go to this and is this going to I don't have to do that I just take the antibiotic as it's prescribed and if I'll do and take the medicine as it's been prescribed the medicine will go to work brother and sister in this day God didn't give us a new prescription he just to tore the seals off and restored the original prescription to the Church of the Living God repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost brother we didn't have just some little guy coming out of the lab this was the chief pharmacist himself this is the great physician that has stepped down in this hour Hallelujah the conditions the need called for it hallelu oh my brother Samuel what does this have to do with overcoming fear everything because when we get our eyes off the word and get anybody been distracted you know how they say it on the road no texting and driving right I've got friends I've got buddies and they do it I want to grab their phone they're putting it up above they're steering well doing it I almost want to say let me out of the van and you go ahead and go there ain't no text message from nobody that's worth that's right getting in an accident for right you know what that's called distracted driving you know what distracted is is to get your attraction your attention off of where you need to be focused and Satan has got a lot of distractions at this hour he's got a lot of enticements to try to lure and pull upon that flesh pull upon your spirit listen friends even with things that you yourself or I could look at and say well this isn't necessarily sin or this isn't sin sometimes you'll get our attention and we'll get distracted off on a hurt or an offense or a grudge or bitterness and we'll get our eyes all off of where we need to and we wonder how am I sinking well we're sinking cuz we got our eyes off the word but if we can look and say Lord save me there's a strong hand that can reach right down and lift us up brother he'll Lift us up and he'll walk us right where we need to be you step out of your ship and let him he'll take you to where you need to be praise name Hallelujah let me let's close on this here 2 Chronicles 6:24 yall almost get to where you don't believe me when I say that 2 Chronicles 6:24 but watch this there's a lot lot you can read this whole chapter later on you're familiar with it but when you read it just look how it says when Israel would get in trouble in any situation they get in trouble if thy people this is Solomon's Prayer be put to the worst before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall return and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house then hear thou from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy People Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest them and to their fathers you see how simple that is you know what that just takes just humility brother brah tells us the whole prescription he says remember where you've drifted from repent and God will bring you back there'll be a return remember repent return that's God's prescription notice God made that provision even where Solomon would make that prayer and I think tonight as we stand if there's things that we can look at let's just stand in his presence we want to be like Jonah Jonah Jonah Jonah held on this prayer brother Aaron Jonah held on this prayer here is Solomon had prayed this prayer but Jonah knew his confidence was it was God that had made intercession through Solomon and Jonah had went down God called him to go to neva but Jonah took a ship to Tarsus and you know why I took that ship brother Brown tells us in a man running from the presence of God that Jonah took that ship because he thought the people wouldn't hear him his thinking caused him to take that ship but you know what even in the midst of that time here he is thrown over the ship here's here here's where it starts the guys are like what's going on let's loosen the ship let's throw this over throw this over throw this over finally Jonah here's confession right here's confession throw me I'm the problem I wonder how many of us tonight could say Lord I want to throw my attitude out amen I want to throw out my thinking about things I want to throw out my feeling feelings are real but they're they're they're not serving me they're taking me away from what you've called me to do I'm ready to get back on track and when they threw him over God had prepared a fish took a hold of Jonah took him down but Jonah in the midst of that time well I want you to watch the Power of repentance it was moving in his heart Jonah got down there he said though I'm cast out of thy sight Lord but yet I'll look to your Holy Temple Jonah which way is it I don't have a GPS out here but I've got God's positioning system inside here I just know to look to Faith in the promise that said if you're ever in trouble and they will humble themselves and call on my name I'll hear from heaven and here he was in the midst of a situation Jonah powerful words that we quote many times he spoke and said they that observe lying vanities right forsake their own mercies yes they do I tell you we can observe look contemplate focus in on the things that's around us and you know what it will do nothing for us but bring us down we start sinking we just start sinking in doubt we start sinking in in a place why when we get to looking and get our eyes off the word let me tell you something let me just say this very simple I know it's very simple but let me tell you friends when God gives you a promise in a service we might have sat here maybe for an hour and there might have been one thing that struck your heart one thing if you'll take whatever God spoke to your heart and you take that thing as the prophet said and you begin to nourish it you cherish it right you know you become sensitive to it you know when a my my wife I'm going to tell this honor and I hope I don't get nothing afterwards but my wife before our children came she was a sound sleeper but after the children came and even to this day one little move I think Zachary could move his toe she's up she's up it's just it's just that lurt that that attribute comes out right hey what's going on what's going on I mean this is not a a normal time for you to what what's going on something going on in your body what I'm trying to say is is when that after tribute was awakened now she's become sensitive to the needs of her household and see the word itself the spirit of God it comes breathes upon the word quickens the word to our heart take that word to your life and begin to nourish it become sensitive begin to pray over it brother Samuel it's just one promise listen it only takes one promise in the heart of a Believer and it can run every devil back to hell the Bible said and Jesus stood before the tomb of Lazarus Jesus wept you see when you take that word in your heart nourish it be sensitive to it say Lord I I want to you know with like the baby you you're nourishing you're you're holding you're you're cherishing it and this is where the Prophet said let us nourish it let us cherish it and with real Godly discipline let us obey it that's what we want don't we amen let's just pray Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you for your mercies tonight Lord thank you Father for guiding us Lord and speaking to our hearts you help us Lord to see our needs Lord Lord I'm so glad it's you've never made you've never made the gospel comp licated no no it's very simple It's You Lord you give us and you help us to understand what we need to understand at that moment now I pray father right here tonight Lord maybe maybe the promise Lord and as your word has been spoken it's swept over our lives maybe it's been Lord for a need of healing maybe Lord for the Holy Ghost maybe Deliverance Lord in a life maybe Lord a healing that goes beyond that of the Physical Realm that goes right into the spirit where no surgeon can reach but in this great medicine bag of yours Lord my father you're the Cure and the answer and remedy for every needu now Lord as your word you've spoke to our hearts tonight Lord with lives and hearts Lord that you've called to us to come [Music] out of situations called us Lord to come beyond our own belief like Jonah Lord to cast aside Lord our thoughts we want to Lord we want to stay on track and we want Lord to receive the grace of God when we've got off track we want to take the grace of God to get back on track [Music] tonight Lord I Thank when Jack Cole was they were pinning him down in that courtroom that day in Florida cuz there was a little lady little girl where her braces were taken off and she walked across the platform they set a trap for for Jack hole right they said she was never healed Jack Cole said yes she was she walked across that platform and the judge said give me one scripture where anything like that has ever taken place where somebody was healed and then all of a sudden they get to the other point and it returns father brother Gordon Lindsay stood up in that courtroom and he said you're honor there's a scripture where Peter was bidden to come and walk and as long as he looked to the Lord Jesus he could walk but when he got his eyes off of him he began to fail the judge picked up the gavel Struck it and said case dismissed the word had settled it h now Lord right here tonight you're the amen you're the settle of every doubt yes sir of every dispute you're the answer to every question Lord hallelujah now father may your presence Lord that's here may you just take your word Lord to every heart I believe that's already been going on Lord while the word's being preached the word has been speaking to our hearts Lord father maybe there's a heart here tonight that says Lord bid me come to you bid me Lord now father as we're here to entertain you Lord to take your presence in Lord to our lives I wonder as our heads are bowed how many would say [Music] Lord You've bid me come and I'm going to walk to you Lord my eyes on you Lord I'm going to leave this boat behind Lord and I'm going to walk to you whatever the circumstance maybe it's a besetting sin maybe it's a weight maybe it's a grudge maybe it's bitterness maybe it's hurt maybe it's a habit but
