world to me amen no matter the trial the test what means everything to me is it is well with my soul amen that's what you know what what separates our lives from other lives it's not us making ourselves different but it is God that has come to quicken what he placed inside of us and then that brings us as brother Brown we use the term throws us into subjection to the word and here we are being formed to the word image as we're feeding on that word to us we see the way the world is we see the framework we see the system and this whole system that is upon this earth right now is a religious system it's a religious order that started out of rebellion that fell in heaven came down to Ernie but it's not the true religion religion is only a covering but oh my we've got more than a country there's been an atonement made for us there's been a perfect blood that's been shed for us amen and the God who came down and he shed his own blood he has come with a personal Jubilee message to our hearts the Holy Ghost has said you were within my mind before the foundation of the world I've never forgot about you but all of redemption stories all of this was all pointing it was all calling for this moment I believe just any moment any moment we're gonna be caught away I believe that with all my heart you know and we hear the prayer requests that were read and I thought as I was standing there I thought you know of how we were you know reading and the one that they mentioned with little Liliana and I just in my heart I just just said right there I said it's a line vanity it's a line vanity you said brother Sammy you're choosing you're ignoring facts no no what I'm looking at there's a time when the truth is not the truth there is a greater truth is that right the Giants in the land was not alive that was the truth but the truth was God said I've given you the land that was the truth so we we choose we look at the truth and the promise you say when and how with every need well we don't know when and how but as believers we pray we commit it to God and we expect God to move amen and that I believe tonight the Lord is gonna come down tonight he's already here amen I brought him with me you brought him with you all the licks of fire that's together my it's hard to tell what will happen here tonight but God will come down and take a gift that he's placed in brother Jerry's life and the Holy Spirit will come right in and step into that and take that word and for what you and I have need of tonight God will pour out his inspiration upon that word and a word that has been an encouragement and has has defeated the devil time and time again God will come right down tonight and show once again that his word is the ultimate weapon that has been given amen so we we thank God for that tonight and we just want to just give and give right over into the word and just so thankful my brother Paul sister Susie amen so they came all the way up here to hear their pastor tonight but we're glad to have you brother and sister Suzie it's so good to see you good to see each and every one of you amen tonight and we're we're ready we're hungry we're ready to receive from the Lord would you sing that song with me how great is our God amen you know I I don't want to take more time but I got to looking at a little something I didn't look it up and just stumbled across it you know how the Bible says that the stars sing he said though he said even though creation seems there's a man that they caught these these electromagnetic pulsations from stars and it sounds like a symphony that's being played then they captured that of the wells echoing out or the joy they put it all together and when they put it all together it sounded just like this how great is our God God they're singing praises to God how great is hotdogs amen let's sing it together brother Jerry comes to minister the word of the Lord amen [Music] is our God sing with me how great [Music] our great [Music] [Music] No at all Oh how to do ah [Music] distrust [Music] and always me every say name of Allah [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] hey man let's just vibes and word of Prayer before we go to the scripture tonight Heavenly Father board were thankful to be here tonight are together with believers here Lord in Ohio we ask God that you will anoint me now Lord to be able to yield to you that you may speak to the people and help them dear God bless them tonight we ask for your glory in Jesus Christ's name Amen if you could turn me into book of first John chapter 4 I'd like to read verses 17 through 21 what I want to speak on tonight is fear verse 17 herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world there is no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us if a man say I love God and hateth his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love God and we had hath not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also a man you may be seated we all have to do with fear in our lives and theirs fears of many things theirs sometimes people feel fear failure sometimes they fear rejection sometimes they fear sickness there's people who fear being alone these are all fears that weigh heavily on us and there's many others I guess we could mention tonight types of fear that is in our lives but it paralyzes our spirit and they can damage our relationships and it definitely hinders our faith faith and fear cannot exist together hebrews 1 xi tells us that faith is being certain of what we do not see being certain of what we do not see it's an absolute belief that God is constantly working behind the scenes in every aspect of our life that's faith the phrase fear not is used 63 times in the Bible I believe that the enemy uses fear to decrease our hopes and limit our victories sometimes people worry that God won't come through and their time of need they fear that God won't be there for them sometimes people fear that God doesn't love them because there's things go on happening to them and going on in their lives and he well if he loved me these things wouldn't be happening to me but the Bible tells us we suffer with Jesus we shouldn't fear that God doesn't love us or that he'll come through for us for the Bible tells us he first loved us he loved us before before you were ever formed in the womb of your mother God loves you I can prove that by the scripture because the scripture tells us that before Jacob and Esau were even born God said he loved Jacob and how do you know God loves you he called you he said no man can come to me except the father calls him perfect love casts out fear if for instance like to light these lights in the building here you've got to work according to the laws of electricity otherwise the lights won't come on - brother branham gives an example and says if I had crops on this hill and I had water on this hill he said the only way I could get the water over there - all those crops is by complying to the law of gravity to move that water from here to there and it's the same thing with our healing we must work according to the law of God and and his only belief all things are possible to them to believe perfect love brother Branham says casts out all fear perfect love casts out all fear brother em says love and faith is the same thing perfect love casts out all fear which gives faith when fear is gone faith is perfect so you see why Satan wants to use fear fear of your sickness fear of your illness fear that well I won't I won't make it fear of death there's people who have fear of death we you know if I was to ask anybody here tonight there would be nobody would say I want to die nobody wants to die that's in their right mind but to die the Bible says is gain if we die in the Lord we live so Satan should not be able to torment us with fear of death brother Adam says death is just a vehicle that takes you from this dimension to that dimension some people are scared he won't keep his word but I know that he does he does keep his word he has always kept his word I'd like to read from 1st Corinthians chapter 13 first corinthians chapter 13 verse 1 though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity I am become as sounding brass and tinkling cymbal charity is love and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though I have all faith so that I can remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away brother Branham speaking about that scripture he says it's talking about love and he says it says when that which is perfect is come he said which is love perfect love and perfect love will never pass away amen do we believe he's Almighty God if he's not capable of looking out for us then he's not Almighty God if he's not capable of doing all things then he's not all mighty God if he's not capable of knowing all things then he's not Almighty God but I believe he is I believe he knows everything I believe that he's taking care of everything I commit my life into his hands I commit my soul into his hands my being my living everything myself I committed into his hands how things are going to come out I committed into his hands how is this problem going to be his resolves I committed into his hands I've been in the midst of things to where I looked for a way out I looked for a way to resolve the situation I was in and I would come up with what I thought was a good idea love how to do it and it would fail but when I stood back and committed it to God and watch what God would do then God always does it perfectly [Applause] if you have the right kind of love for God you won't have one speck of fear we're still growing in love we all have filial love but the love that is talking about is agape love that's perfect love love that when you're you know people fear that perhaps their children won't come and give their lives to the Lord if you've got the right kind of love agape love you can pray and say God do whatever you need to do to them if they got to come down to face death then let them come down to face death if I've got to to say goodbye to them in this life to see them in the next life is what I want I'm willing to lay it all down before God no one would like to see their children's lives in a wreck but if that's what it takes Lord then I that's the right kind of love see the filial love will get you into trouble the filial love you know it wants to well there might my son or there my daughter and make some kind of excuse warm or make some kind of loophole form that the filial love but the agape love says I want to see him saved at any cost the breath says you can't have faith until you have love and when you've got perfect love then it casts out all fear all a double L all fears love drives fear out then faith comes in and takes the place of fear one of the greatest hindrances brother branham says to the believer to Christians is fear the reason they're fearful he says because they don't have the right temperance of love that never entered into that yet I'm not saying these to condemn us we all fight fear but if we'd love God with the agape love and realized as the scripture said he loved us first I like the song that that says he knew me yet he loved me so he knew everything I would ever be in my life everything I would ever do he knew every failure every mistake every fault and he still loved me now that's the kind of love that you can count on that's the kind of love that will drive out fear when you really love the Lord then you can trust him Jesus says in the Book of Luke he said fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to bring you the kingdom we live in a time where a lot of people are perplexed the Bible tells us we're living in a time when men's hearts fail them for fear there was one time that I wanted to mention in the scripture there was a time when the children of Israel came out of Egypt and when they came out they got down by the Red Sea and all of a sudden Pharaohs chariots and armies showed up on the horizon and they looked and they cried out to Moses said was there not enough graves in Egypt that you had to bring us out here to die you see fear had gripped them they were looking at the circumstance they were not looking at the Jehovah God was there to take care of that they were not looking at that Jehovah could do the impossible and they cried to Moses and Moses said fear not but stand still and see the salvation of the Lord and remember the Lord said to Moses why cry speech and go forward whatever I think about that I think about when we first was starting to work here back years ago in the 80s and every time somebody would go through a trial or something like here brother bill said go forward you remember that he said why Christ beat and go forward and he told him raise your rod and then God did the impossible he you know you could not part water but God did it to me must have been with the breath from his nostrils because it just blew the water back on either side not only that but he told them they were going to walk through on dry ground now I will tell you something when you first move water the ground ain't dry when it rains outside how long does it take for the ground to dry up but he said you're gonna walk through a dry ground so he breathed on the Red Sea and it split and there was dry ground to walk on God said I'll not stop until I get me hotter upon Pharaoh and his army in his chariots and with the same water he parted for the children of Israel across through and he said a hardened Pharaoh's heart that he'll follow after you they follow laughter of course we all familiar with the story Pharaoh's army got drowned by the Red Sea [Music] fear not they had a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night yet they so many times were overtaken with fear it is because they didn't trust Jehovah that's why when they came down to the time to take the land and they sent the ten spies out and then you know they came back and and when they came back some said we're not able why it was their fear they said we look like grasshoppers in their sight that was their own imagination fear working on their imagination as I heard brother joel for nice a knot on one of them went over and said hey what do I look like to you it was their own imagination but time after time Jehovah had proven that he was taking terrible and he has proven over and over and over again in our lives that he is taking care of us and every aspect of our lives and he cares about even the smallest my new things in our life then we ought to be able to trust him because he's come through time and time again like the song says he'll do it again [Music] we look at Moses God had a purpose in Moses he had a purpose for Moses to fulfill brother Branham says God's got a purpose for you and I to feel and he said the sooner we get in that place that it'll save he said God and yourself a lot of trouble Lord spoke to Abraham says the word of the Lord came to Abram and said fear not Abram I am your shield I am thy seeding great reward fear not I'm your shield I'm there to shield you I'm there to take care of you fear not the Lord came to Isaac told him fear not I'm with thee and I'll bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham sake Deuteronomy God talking to the children of Israel he said fear not neither be discouraged doesn't matter if you're going through something doesn't matter how long that it seems to be going on don't become discouraged God is working behind the scene remember when the angel came to Daniel and he said fear not Daniel I've been sent from the presence of the Lord and he said God herds you on the first day and dispatched me to come down and bring you the answer but said I was beset by the Prince of Persia and he said Michael had to come down with his angels and fight so that I could get through 21 days Daniel prayed he didn't quit he didn't give up so I'd been praying about this one situation for a long time doesn't seem to be getting anywhere keep on praying keep on believing remember when John Ryan came and was prayed for my brother branham for his eyes he was blind went off the platform still blind humming background got back in line come back up brother branham said I said you already healed he said well I can't see brother brems said I realized that him being Catholic background he had to have something for him to do he said so I told him you everywhere you go you say by his stripes I'm healed you remember the story he was out on the corner selling newspapers extra-extra hear all about it by his stripes I'm healed everywhere he went by his stripes I'm healed you know what it did it was getting rid of the fear in his life he kept claiming the promise by His stripes I'm healed until the day of his visitation and look at when the day of his visitation was was when somebody was mocking him and in the face of somebody mocking him God restored his sight the children of Israel God spoke to them and said when you are come nigh into battle that the preach shall approach and speak unto the people and say unto them hear o Israel the approach this day in the battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be terrified because of them why why is he saying this what for what why should they not be terrified for the Lord your God is he that goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to save you time after time God gave them victory why would they doubt him when it come time to cross over when God had gave them victory time after time against insurmountable odds tells them again in Deuteronomy 31 he said be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid to them for the Lord thy God he it is that does go with you he will not fail thee nor forsake thee that's not going to follow you he's not going to forsake you I've dealt with people that had fear of failure fear of failure I dealt with it within my own life when I first went to Dixon the devil would come to me and say every ministers been here before you failed you're gonna fail too I was talking about the Tim Pruitt on the phone one time about it and he said we'll praise the Lord brother Jerry if the devil's telling you you're gonna fail it means you have it but I say this if God's the one that's in control how could we fail he said he would never fail us no forsake us so if God's want to control to your life you can't fail he said that all things there's that word again a double arrow all all things work together for the good of them that love the Lord they are called according to his purpose alleluia told remember Boaz told Ruth said fear not I will do all the tower requires I love that reading that story about Ruth because you know why I feel like I'm reading to buy myself the Bride of Christ because that's who Ruth typed the Gentile bride fear not remember the time of the famine and Elijah God had told him there's a woman down here a woman that I've got that's going to take care of you and he's sent him down there and when he got there he saw the woman and he said give me a drink and she she said all right and he says why you're going to fetch a drink said make me a little cake remember she said I've only got enough to make me and my son a cake and we're going to eat it and then we're gonna die and he said fear not it's what he said - he said fear not go and do his taoist said but make me a little cake first and he said bring it unto me and afterward make for thee and thy son already he was talking about a multiplication here because she said she only had enough to make one and he was telling her to make two and he told her the crew savoia will not run drying the mill Barrow will not run empty prints she had to overcome her fear and believe him but what did she have to lose she was going to die what have you got to lose there's not anything in this world that's worth missing the rapture this world has nothing of value to offer all the riches in this world are not worth it because every one of them will pass away [Applause] nothing's worth missing eternal life we've got nothing to lose so give it all over to him committed in his head you know if you sincerely commit it to God you won't be worrying about it anymore king of syria had declared war on israel and every time the king was syria would send his troops down to a certain place to to come against Israel Elijah would tell the king of Israel don't go to that place and it kept happening till the point to where the king of Syria said which one of you is for the king of Israel and he said and one of the service is not none of us he said but there's our prophet down there that tells the king of Israel if things you say in private so the king of Syria gets this idea I'll just go down and get that man so he sends his armies down there and a great number and they surround they hear that Elijah Elijah is down in Dalton so they go down and surround the city at night and one of the morning Dawn's Elisha's servant goes out and sees the hills all covered with the soldiers and chariots of Syria he comes back in he tells it Elisha we're doomed we are doomed we are so surrounded they have found you Elisha says there's more with us than there are with them and you imagine a servant looking around the same Elisha are you little touched in the head right now I don't see anybody for us but I remember Elijah said prayed said Lord open his eyes and when he opened the servants eyes he saw the hillsides there was chariots of fire and angels surrounding all around and then Elijah prays and smites the soldiers blind now I'm not blind where they couldn't see but blind where they couldn't tell who he was he walks out and says the man you're looking for it's not here I'll take you to where he's at and so they follow him and he takes him down to Samaria and then after he gets them down there he says Lord open their eyes and they look and see whether act and they write the myths of the enemy all around him and Elijah tells the king of Israel just feed them don't kill him just feed them and send them back to their king they did that and all the raids against Israel stopped see God had a way of defeating the Syrian army Isaiah tells us fear not for I have redeemed thee I have called thee by name thou are mine we belong to it you many times here brother branham free and he'll say Satan take your hand off this daughter of God were this son of God we belong to him Satan doesn't have any claim on us but he tries to work you know where fear works it's not in your soul fear works in your spirit realm works through reasoning and imagination and these different things in the spirit realm Satan comes and he worked builder and preach the message greatest battle ever fought and he said the battleground Satan pick was your mind and that's where fear tries to work in your mind but friends look forget reasoning don't let your imagination get carried away with you Mary the angel came to Mary and told her fear not you have found favor with God you're going to have a son you're gonna be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost and you're gonna have a son his name will be called Emmanuel so here she is with child and Joseph is fearful he doesn't know what to do if he if he takes Mary to himself then how is he going to look on him that he doesn't care because they said all she's been with some soldier Joseph didn't know and he didn't he in because of fear he didn't know what to do but the Bible says while he thought on these things the aims of the Lord came to him and told him fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is inner is conceived of the Holy Ghost Zacarias wanted a son angel Lord came to him and said fear not your wife Elizabeth who was barren is going to have his son and his name will be called John Zacarias couldn't believe it so he so the angel says you'll not speak you'll not be able to speak you'll be dumb until the day the child is born and from all through her pregnancy Zacharias couldn't speak nine months of no speaking but when he the child was born his speech come back to him and you know what the first thing he said his name is John I said something on Sunday about Jai restore remember when the servant came sire gyrus was there speaking to the Lord want him to come free for his daughter and the servant came and said don't trouble the master any longer she's dead and Jesus says to him fear not believe only fear not believe only the Bible tells us that the hairs of our head is numbered brother branham you say I haven't lost a one God knows where they're at you said if the hairs of your head are numbered fear not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows remember all the fear the disciples dealt with when Jesus was being taken peter was overcome with fear that's what caused him to deny had then he knew the Lord they didn't know what to make of it they they because when Jesus had told them destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up again they didn't understand what he was talking about they just believed it you know the other men around that heard they thought that he was talking about the tabernacle that Solomon had built he imagined Peter and rest on saying well that would really be something but if he says he can do it I believe it they didn't understand it so when the women came down to the to the tomb they they still were not understanding they didn't know what was going on and they come down there and the stone was rolled away and there was an angel there that told him fear not I know who you seek his Jesus but he's not here he goeth before you into Galilee go tell his disciples you know why the Angels say fear not because fear was on them but when the angel told him fear not he's risen then that dissolved their fear they still did how could he be risen they still didn't understand but they believed what the angel told them the Lord says in Revelations chapter 1 when John the Revelator saw him he said when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and have the keys of hell fear not brother branham went beyond the curtain of time I was just listened to something about it just this week and he went beyond the curtain of time there comes so many people to greet him and his first wife hope came too greedy and she said my precious brother and she hugged him and then another woman comes up and she hugs brother browning Branham and says my precious brother brother Francis I don't understand this and then hoping the lady the other lady hugged each other and there was no feelings of humanity there brother ministers I don't understand this and the angel spoke to him the voice spoke to him said this is what you preached the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love and nothing can enter here without it brother Brent says I'm more determine to my life that you can't make it there without perfect love friends I don't know how this body's going to change but I'm not in fear over whether it's going to do it or not I believe it's going to change I'm looking forward to it I don't think it'll hurt a bit sister it's just going to change so I know it's written in the Bible the prophets gather with their people bril dreams yes I remember that Scripture he says well then you gather with your people never brother branham was he was fearful before this he didn't want to be just a spirit floating around or something so he kind of had a fear about it and then the Lord allowed this to happen and one of the things brother branham asks is will they be real can I touch them that was what he was afraid of that would just be floating around wouldn't be able to touch one another and all these things he says yes they're real you can touch them it dissolved his fear concerning that matter because he saw what perfect love was Paul told Timothy for God hath not given us a spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind the book of Romans Paul says we have not received let me just back up I'll read all this in verse 14 whereas many has led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together and I'll just throw in this last verse because I really like it Romans 8:18 well I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us we've not been given the spirit of bondage again to fear but the spirit of adoption we are children of God if if we're children then he loves us unconditionally in one service titled exhortation of the divine healing brother branham there was a woman that came up before brother branham and he said I see that you've really been suffering and he said Astra did she believe him to be God's prophet he said you know you're coming up here is a testimony to everybody that you believe in divine illy where you wouldn't come up here that he told her you know because the people come into the presence of that angel standing there with him at first it would strike little fear in them and he'd tell him fear not that's that's just him and after he tells this lady that then he says you you have cancer that's what it is said you're suffering with cancer he said you believe God heals you just come here about a minute to me because I'm gonna pray for you that God will bless you and heal you and he prays for her and then after he prays for she goes to walk off and brother Brendan says just a minute he said I I feel something I filled that spirit of cancer he says sister come back here a minute he says maybe it's still on you and then he comes back near to him he says no it's nice gone he said all I feel it coming from over here said it's a kindred spirit it's another demon of cancer he said they're sympathetic with one another and he NE says calls out this man laying on a cot and says you're dying with cancer and says you've got cancer of the of the spleen and it's through your kidneys in your stomach and your inwards is it really God heals you the gods healed you and then he talks about those demons and he says it's like birds of feather they flock together and he says these spirits he said like doves we'll go together he said well then they don't hang out with buzzards but buzzards hang out with buzzards and he says that that's what I'm talking about is these demon spirits and that spirit he said of cancer was on that man was sympathetic because the spirit was cast out of that woman brother and said you know the cancer is a devil it's a demon and he said the angel of the Lord appeared to me and he told me that with I believe that when I pray not even cancer will stand before my prayer and he said there's been more healings of cancer than any other thing in my ministry perfect love casts out all fear the Brenham said he was praying the message unconditional covenant he said he leads us all into perfect faith perfect love one for another make us Lord so much in love that it be hard for us to leave the building that's the kind of love we wanted our miss that's the kind of move of the Spirit we wonder miss where you feel like you wouldn't want to leave here recently I preached back at home I don't remember which sermon it was but it was just your recent and I went to walk out the back afterwards and I usually go back there so I can stand and greet the people as they come out and brother Jim Horner had stepped out and then he stepped back in and when I came back out of the office and he was still standing back in there he says I don't want to leave he said there's something about the presence the Lord here I don't want to leave that's how we want God in our myths hallelujah let's stand Heavenly Father we come before you tonight we thank you for your word there Lord we thank you for words of encouragement Lord and a faith Lord and instruction Lord it shows just how much you love your people we think you Lord for taking the time to come down and be with us here this evening Lord Lord bless your people continue to bless them I pray Lord God Jesus Christ name better words that was real counsel counselor tonight I really believe that it would it would behoove us just take time and go back over that service you know just something they just kept coming to me as the jury was minister god the greatest compliment that we can give to God is to have faith in what he said and you know in every one of these instances of how the Lord ministered every one of those for the scriptural hearts even those things that was brought out of brother branham's life you'll notice every one of them his experiences suppose tell me what were you saying that it isn't just something to where we just look at in the word at just just to look at it but God wants to make that word live within us and so God is the one working in all out of their lives you know brother Branham made mention brother Ruth Jerry made mention of the time brother bad I mean we've all heard that most of us maybe some of you have brother Brown was talking about going beyond the curtain of time and before then we had a lot of his fears wandering you listen to the message go to 1953 brother branham goes into the latter part of that message he makes a statement when he's down with sickness and he says looking at his wife he says sometimes I even wonder if I'll call me now that's hard for us to try to think after how God has used the problem so much that he would make a statement and say sometimes I even wonder if I'm called sister meaning being a faithful helpmate she said you ought to be ashamed of yourself to say that brother Brett said what it is he got he got to look in at something of what General Pat had said and if I put this bullet in a gun if that bullet don't go off I'm going to take it out and I want to put another bullet in if that little go off I want to take that out and put another bullet in with Brett said what it is he said I've always been afraid of failing of failing receipt god allowed the experience to come and God let him know this whole sickness he was dealing with he needed to accept the commission that God had already confirmed the joy soon as brother Graham said and Lord I accept it with Rev said that moment the fever broke the Silas condition left and he said right there he said I'm determined if that bullet fails I'll put another one in he said God can't fail see it wasn't experience it wasn't just looking at something with and I hope you understand what we're saying it's an experience God brings his word to pass and as that word is coming to past and that experience it cast out all fear sometimes we wonder with experiences and things that we go through and test a traveler but we know that all things work together for the good tests and trials are not they're not droppings that just happen to come over in our life this kind of wants to get out of this guy and the spirit doesn't like it but the inside man is anchored in God that's where God takes control and I just those things tonight how the Holy Spirit came both for our heart everyone else from the Red Sea that was an experience that's an experience did they not see God did not God tell them before if you're not sure he did but yet now experiences come and all of those experiences and you say Lord let me just lift up my eyes and remember this one thing no matter what the experience is it was said over and over as the Lord would take brother Jerry through this and this is exactly how the Lord has brought this message to us in the end time it is to cast out all fear and that was you were in his mind before the foundation of the world I've always loved you I sought you out and that's where faith takes hold that's where faith in rest he knows the end the same one who holds the beginning he holds the end it's securely that's what love does and bring security I love that love cast out fear faith in step in all we the Lord the Lord spoken tonight it's already been clearly said but say Lord with every experience let the word come let it cast out the fear fears not in the soul spirit realm it's a mine see these things that the Holy Spirit spoke tonight so clearly God knows what we have need of tonight and that right there if you can take that that reality right there to realize it's not your soul it's a spirit room it's your mind now the devil try to punch engine and his brother Brett says try to make you think that you're not seen but he says you know you're not what you used to you know you have believed every word Satan comes with him while the trying to try to get us to entertain even as was said this sickness this fear comes with this or this situation this with us and let us just say Lord and just commit myself to commit this situation it's in your hands same God who sought me out the same God brought me to him the same God who's done the work of my life that same God is working even
