[39:02] as well also with brother edy Cardona
[39:05] that may be also another email I need to
[39:07] get out in the morning I've got a touch
[39:09] base with his son
[39:10] Richard's already been doing some of the
[39:13] legwork force here and I'm going to
[39:15] appreciate that we we don't know exactly
[39:18] we want to be able to have something for
[39:20] brother edge so some sort of a service
[39:22] so I'm just trying to work on that and
[39:24] then we'll let you know all the details
[39:27] more willing tomorrow morning so
[39:30] everybody okay amen
[39:33] well let's we'll read one verse of
[39:35] scripture then we'll let you have your
[39:36] seats in 1st Corinthians 14 and 26 how
[39:41] is it then brethren when you come
[39:45] together every one of you
[39:47] half an assault half a doctrine half a
[39:51] tone half a revelation half an
[39:53] interpretation let all things be done
[39:57] unto edifying and may God bless you as
[40:04] you're being seated bless His Word I
[40:10] want to look back on to this thought
[40:13] here just a little bit I actually
[40:14] thought they were just gonna go on but
[40:18] the Lord just seemed like it just
[40:19] wouldn't let me go on and earlier the
[40:22] other morning I just just was pressed in
[40:25] this direction and knowing there was
[40:26] still something here that we're looking
[40:28] at Paul he's taken this time in first
[40:32] Corinthians 14:2 to express to the
[40:36] church because they had the gifts
[40:38] operating there within the the Church of
[40:42] Corinth and and I think that that's
[40:45] something that as brother Branham would
[40:47] bring us in the scriptures and show us
[40:49] that every local body there the nine
[40:53] spiritual gifts are to be a part of that
[40:56] local body and to recognize that with
[40:59] within it when we when we see it it's
[41:02] things that God has said in the church
[41:05] and it's all for the edifying of the
[41:07] body and I don't want to get ahead of
[41:10] myself here but when you look at how
[41:12] that that that Paul would would write in
[41:15] place this here you'll see in different
[41:18] times in the scriptures and for that
[41:20] first Corinthians 14 where Paul is
[41:22] telling them when you come together and
[41:24] you'll say it a couple different times
[41:26] and when you recognize that when we we
[41:29] see it it's just like this there we know
[41:31] that the Bible tells us to forsake not
[41:33] to assemble ourselves together and to
[41:37] recognize that when we when we come
[41:39] together that we are expecting that God
[41:42] will make himself known in our midst we
[41:47] we don't know what he's going to do but
[41:49] we always know he'll always come
[41:51] according to his word and when we come
[41:54] here and we gather we're not here just
[41:56] to see well let's see what's going to
[41:59] happen as believers we recognize that
[42:01] when we're coming here we're coming to
[42:04] hear from God we've got needs in our
[42:07] life there are there are our we need to
[42:09] be spoken we need we need God to speak
[42:12] to us we need we need God to move on the
[42:15] scene not just for us but there's such a
[42:16] variety of needs that could be among us
[42:19] for healing
[42:20] deliverance for the baptism of the Holy
[42:22] Ghost there's so many different
[42:24] diversity of needs when we come together
[42:26] and I'm glad that it's not in our hands
[42:29] too as to that we would be the ones
[42:32] meeting those needs but God is the one
[42:34] who is who is the one to meet those
[42:36] needs but Paul is is just he's making
[42:38] known to them to the congregation to the
[42:41] people here that let all things be done
[42:44] unto edifying on a set like this there's
[42:46] really there's really nothing wrong with
[42:49] somebody coming and they have a soul
[42:50] there's nothing wrong with somebody that
[42:53] they have something upon their heart but
[42:56] yet Paul is letting it be known that
[42:58] when he's dealing with this Paul he is
[43:01] telling them because Paul seems
[43:02] something spiritually here that this is
[43:05] what the people are resting upon they're
[43:08] actually resting their faith and their
[43:11] walk with God that they've got a song or
[43:13] they've got a doctrine instead of
[43:15] letting it be resting in Jesus Christ
[43:18] now let me just say it to you like this
[43:20] if a person is resting within that and
[43:23] then they don't have that within a
[43:25] service and that's where their rest is
[43:27] that they feel as though they ain't even
[43:29] been to church and you know how it is
[43:31] sometimes if a person you know they're
[43:32] you know a person may feel like that
[43:35] they got to be the one that's doing the
[43:36] preaching or they got to be the one
[43:38] doing the singing and if they didn't do
[43:40] it and there's little things in the
[43:41] service if it's not done well then I
[43:43] didn't come to church but the reality is
[43:46] is that God in every service there's no
[43:49] service that we ever want to get in a
[43:52] pre-programmed
[43:53] format as to how God is going to work
[43:56] because the reality is you can never put
[43:59] God in a box if you ever go to try to
[44:01] put in lines and putting God in a box
[44:03] God you will just move right on out but
[44:06] God will always show up and to remember
[44:08] everything that is done is for the
[44:11] edification of the body of Jesus Christ
[44:15] and so every gift does say it like this
[44:18] every gift that God has is for the body
[44:21] it isn't for the person who has it it's
[44:25] for the body even a person a person who
[44:28] has a gift to sing it isn't for them
[44:31] it's for the body
[44:32] a person who has a gift to preach it
[44:34] isn't for them it's for the body and to
[44:37] recognize that this was in it there's a
[44:39] lot to be said here but there is in
[44:42] everything and don't just don't
[44:43] misunderstand me and don't take this
[44:44] lightly every one brother man would say
[44:47] it over and over as a matter of fact he
[44:49] you say like this he says that every
[44:51] person in the local church
[44:54] has an individual ministry so a person
[44:58] you might look and say well I don't
[45:00] think that I cover in one of the nine
[45:02] spiritual gifts but remember if you are
[45:05] born of the Spirit of God baptized into
[45:08] the body of Jesus Christ every member is
[45:11] subject to one of the nine spiritual
[45:13] gifts and in God as brother Ram will
[45:16] tell us he said God can use this person
[45:18] tonight and he says mummy says the
[45:19] Spirit of God will move he said and
[45:21] never used that person again however we
[45:24] do see where you know brother Branham
[45:26] will teach us that and show us that but
[45:28] then there teams tend tends to be
[45:30] tendencies where you can see different
[45:32] ones who will speak in tongues like
[45:34] brother man will call out junior Jackson
[45:36] he'll call out brother Neville in
[45:37] different ones and I believe with all my
[45:40] heart that with all of us we want to be
[45:43] in such a place to be available when God
[45:46] wants to use us you want to be in a
[45:49] place to where you don't have to say
[45:50] Lord I would but we we want to be in a
[45:54] place to where that God can use us
[45:55] because when we're in a place in
[45:58] fellowship with God we are sensitive to
[46:01] his leading we're sensitive to his voice
[46:03] in a matter of fact we lose sight of
[46:05] self and we're very keen upon what God's
[46:09] desire is and so when I look at this
[46:12] brother man with jealousy said every
[46:14] church every person in that church has
[46:17] an individual ministry and that
[46:19] individual ministry goes together with
[46:21] the rest of the body
[46:24] to edify the body of Jesus Christ so no
[46:26] ministry is to be on an island by itself
[46:30] as those that my you know it sticks out
[46:35] no edge to go and blend with the rest of
[46:38] the body and
[46:40] I think of that mother so much we can
[46:42] run with this on an individual ministry
[46:45] but you know many of the times when we
[46:47] look at things and I've looked at this
[46:49] over over the years of how that many
[46:52] times when we we talk about the gifts
[46:54] being among us many times the only gift
[46:57] many times that is actually seen that
[47:00] will can be witness many times in the
[47:03] congregation is that of tongues and that
[47:05] of interpretation but the gift of wisdom
[47:08] listen brother sister the gift of wisdom
[47:10] is not limited to being in the house of
[47:13] God the gift of wisdom can move the Holy
[47:15] Spirit move upon a lie and you might be
[47:18] fellowshipping with a brother sister or
[47:20] you feel burdened upon your heart to get
[47:23] together with this one and say I don't
[47:26] know what it is don't try to figure it
[47:27] out just be sensitive to the Lord pray
[47:30] about it and you watch how God the
[47:32] wisdom of God can come right down into
[47:34] that time and it can be something that
[47:37] happens through a car maybe it's through
[47:38] you sitting down with them and God can
[47:40] minister right to them and give them the
[47:44] encouragement that they need how is that
[47:46] through a gift of wisdom even that the
[47:49] gift of healing remember brother man I'm
[47:50] talking about the woman who walked in
[47:52] and she saw this she was drawn to that
[47:54] little baby and and was just pressed
[47:57] upon her go pray for that go pray for
[47:59] that baby she said no there you know in
[48:01] herself no brother branham will take
[48:02] care of that you know when he prays for
[48:04] she could not get away from that unction
[48:07] and she went and obeyed that and brother
[48:09] Branham tells us he said and when when
[48:12] the baby came up on the platform he
[48:14] tells the person he says your baby was
[48:17] already healed when that sister back
[48:20] there prayed for it God heard her prayer
[48:23] you know to me I believe God let that be
[48:26] for you and I to confirm it to show us
[48:29] that he's God of the whole temp and then
[48:32] that to me is the Ministry of Malachi 4
[48:34] is to identify the presence of Jesus
[48:38] Christ that is among us that desires to
[48:41] to make himself known and to work among
[48:44] his people there's so much with it but I
[48:47] believe it with all my heart and the see
[48:49] how that you know this where was she
[48:51] prayed and God heard that prayer this
[48:53] was a bird look at this nobody would
[48:56] have known that you and I wouldn't have
[48:58] known that to even know that account if
[49:01] it hadn't been called out and recorded
[49:03] on tape nobody in the congregation would
[49:06] have known about that let me just say it
[49:08] to you like this there's a lot of things
[49:10] that God can use us and God can do with
[49:13] us and there's times that God wants to
[49:16] use us and then sometimes as he uses
[49:18] he'll step back and test us and say what
[49:21] are you gonna say about it why are you
[49:24] gonna guilt and sometimes God wants us
[49:26] to testify on some of those things and
[49:28] then there's other times where there's
[49:30] things that you it's just like you know
[49:32] that are said and God doesn't want it
[49:34] said it all my goodness that requires a
[49:38] lot of wisdom to know what needs to be
[49:41] said and what because we never want to
[49:44] draw attention to ourselves we want all
[49:48] the focus to be upon the Lord Jesus
[49:50] Christ you say what do you mean and what
[49:52] I mean is that I want somebody's face
[49:55] resting in the Lord Jesus Christ not
[49:58] resting in the fact that oh it's brother
[50:00] Sam they're gonna be here this weekend
[50:01] oh if brother Samuel is not gonna be
[50:02] here you know I need to be pray for it
[50:04] is not my prayer it is your faith in the
[50:08] finished work out Calvary Amen I don't
[50:13] want somebody resting in me I want you
[50:15] resting in Jesus Christ amen because to
[50:18] tell you the truth
[50:19] gadi God doesn't have to have just my
[50:21] hands God can use the hands of your wife
[50:23] God can use the hands of your husband
[50:26] are you isn't me my my my now when we
[50:31] when we look at this God Paulus is
[50:34] telling them when you all come together
[50:36] he's dealing with the godly edification
[50:39] that it's about the body the gift is not
[50:43] something for you to profit from but
[50:48] rather used to bless his name to bless
[50:51] his body the gift and I'll say it like
[50:54] this the gift is not it's not something
[50:56] to wear the gift has to
[50:58] used at that time remember this is where
[51:01] Pentacles got it wrong they thought in
[51:04] order to have that they had Church
[51:06] somebody had to speak in tongues and
[51:08] they failed to recognize that it wasn't
[51:11] about that that those gifts are given
[51:14] that for God to speak directly to his
[51:17] church and when that is based on beneath
[51:20] it's like this when you're making your
[51:23] food in your kitchen now talk to the
[51:25] sisters but everybody everybody can
[51:27] relate to it because the brothers
[51:28] appreciate this you know you don't use
[51:31] the spatula for everything you do you
[51:33] use the spatula when you are maybe
[51:35] mixing up you know brownies or the cake
[51:38] batter as husbands we use it to lick it
[51:40] out of the bowl do you know then you
[51:42] have other utensils you have a whisk
[51:44] you'll use sometimes you have made me
[51:46] you know the the fork you're used to
[51:48] beat the eggs up you based on what the
[51:51] need is is what determines what tool
[51:53] that you use so it is God who takes the
[51:58] the Arsenal of his tools and he uses
[52:01] them that it would edify the Church of
[52:04] the Living God
[52:05] if somebody is sick in their body and
[52:07] and maybe he'll God will move down and
[52:09] here comes a gift of healing where to
[52:12] pray the burden like I decided that
[52:14] little woman you know we don't even know
[52:15] her name it's not necessary she was
[52:18] moved by the Holy Ghost to pray for that
[52:22] little baby and God can take that gear
[52:24] and it moves for that situation for that
[52:27] need at that time same way with wisdom
[52:30] same way with tongues same way with
[52:31] interpretation we recognized that it's
[52:34] not something that God would have us to
[52:37] be anxious about it's like when it comes
[52:41] to you know even to to singing it isn't
[52:46] that you know and that that that a
[52:48] person who is gifted with in singing
[52:50] that every service that they have to
[52:52] sing I think it's a blessing when they
[52:54] have yielded to God and God will lay
[52:56] songs on their heart it's very important
[53:00] let me just tell you special singing is
[53:03] very important I think we're in a heart
[53:06] when it says well I've got to sing
[53:09] that's something that's wrong but
[53:11] in a heart and I believe what we have
[53:12] here we have hearts that say you know
[53:14] Lord whenever that you want to use me
[53:18] you know whatever the burden is the need
[53:21] because God has a way through singing
[53:23] that God can communicate even his word
[53:26] through singing we know brother Branham
[53:28] tells us that and shows us that even how
[53:30] God can even communicate his word even
[53:33] through singing so many different
[53:34] examples in the Bible even how brother
[53:37] Branham when he would come into the
[53:38] church and he's sitting back in his
[53:40] office he said I'm all tore up he said I
[53:42] was all tore up he said but I set back
[53:45] there he said and I listened to that
[53:47] song service and it made me ready to be
[53:50] able to come out here that's why I
[53:52] believe it's all my heart it's important
[53:55] to be in the house of God not just to
[53:58] hear the word of God it's important to
[54:00] be here for the song service I know
[54:04] sometimes it runs a little different on
[54:06] Thursday but brother and sister I
[54:07] believe we can buckle down on Sundays
[54:09] and we can really work to make sure that
[54:11] we are here and the church said Amen so
[54:17] we want to be available and stay
[54:20] available you know when we women look at
[54:23] it here you know the word of edify is
[54:26] where it works to promote one another's
[54:31] growth in Christian wisdom and piety and
[54:33] happiness and holiness and affection and
[54:36] now Paul let me go on here in the
[54:38] scripture here because I need to get
[54:39] somewhere in verse 27 If any man speak
[54:43] in an unknown tongue let it be by two or
[54:47] at the most by three and that by course
[54:49] and let one interpret but if there be no
[54:52] interpreter let him keep silence in the
[54:55] church and let him speak to himself and
[54:58] to God now one thing I want you to
[55:00] notice that you know here the Holy
[55:03] Spirit moves through the Prophet in this
[55:05] hour and he teaches us that when the
[55:08] Holy Ghost is moving that there is also
[55:11] a godly restraint and a stewardship that
[55:15] is placed even in our hands wherein he
[55:19] said that you know brother ben shows us
[55:21] that a person said hold on
[55:23] just couldn't keep it in no dad said oh
[55:25] yes you can see it lets us know see
[55:30] here's what it does you see what the
[55:31] whole thing is it lets us know as sons
[55:33] and daughters who we are in position we
[55:36] are not the Bible listen to me now
[55:38] the Bible says quench not the Spirit
[55:40] despise not prophesying it shows when
[55:44] Paul dealt with that in these'll vessel
[55:46] and Aika that there was obviously some
[55:48] things that could have caused people in
[55:50] the Thessalonica Church to actually want
[55:53] to just camp down and say no sir we're
[55:56] gonna have none of that let me just say
[55:58] this anywhere that the gifts are and
[56:00] they ought to be in the in every local
[56:03] body it cannot be held in the manner I'm
[56:06] gonna hold sub so tight so nothing I
[56:08] know nothing of the wrong nothing will
[56:10] happen at all you say what is that to be
[56:14] trust God who gave the word the same God
[56:19] who gave the word and if somebody gets a
[56:21] little bit out of order
[56:22] hey the Holy Ghost is present to be able
[56:25] to help that person because we want to
[56:28] believe that their desire is really to
[56:30] edify the body maybe they just needed a
[56:33] little help you with me sometimes these
[56:39] are things you know that where it's it's
[56:42] mentioned I think you know I listen to
[56:46] on Sundays message and I I just love
[56:49] brother Alexander you know the way he
[56:53] said I couldn't help but I just started
[56:54] laughing you know I said that's exactly
[56:56] true he says some people are so
[56:58] interested in putting stuff in order
[56:59] they name got when that may be like
[57:02] words that I'm saying there but you
[57:04] understand there's two things you know
[57:05] that I I know I've said it to because
[57:07] I've been through it I've been through
[57:09] it over the years where people are so
[57:11] tight with church order and they're so
[57:13] tight with everything else and you know
[57:15] I've been down that path I'm not running
[57:17] down that path again
[57:18] I've been down there I've been down
[57:20] there where people are so tight on
[57:22] things and you in over 45 minutes and
[57:25] so-and-so prayed and when they prayed
[57:27] they they they when they prayed this
[57:29] long I mean are we watching watches or
[57:32] what
[57:33] when and what are we here for you know I
[57:38] mean it comes down to a place to where
[57:40] then I think that people are basing
[57:43] rapturing faith upon how things seem to
[57:47] be just exactly right
[57:49] that's not rapturing faith how things
[57:51] are orderly it's like the pipes in your
[57:54] house you want the pipes clean so the
[57:56] water can flow that's what order order
[57:59] does not camp down or crack or quench
[58:02] whatsoever they've got to be controlling
[58:04] it all in order let me stay on this and
[58:08] then the reality is we don't need to
[58:10] control it we need to let God control us
[58:14] amen so think of this that by course huh
[58:18] you know yeah Paul blows he says let let
[58:21] him verse 28 sorry if there be no
[58:23] interpreter let him keep silence in the
[58:24] church and let him speak to himself and
[58:27] to God let the prophets speak two or
[58:30] three and let the other judge if
[58:31] anything be revealed to another that
[58:33] sentence by the first hold his peace for
[58:38] ye look at verse 31 for ye may all
[58:40] prophesy one by one that all may learn
[58:45] and all may be comforted I've said this
[58:52] I've said this and mentioned this and
[58:54] many of you know this but I witnessed
[58:58] even as a as a young boy I witnessed
[59:01] even as a young man how God would would
[59:04] move and work right here within the
[59:06] assembly and many of you you you know as
[59:08] as pillars in this assembly of leaving
[59:11] we were getting ready to make them move
[59:12] over here into this building there it
[59:17] was something that as far as if it
[59:18] looked at the natural site and the
[59:21] reasonings of man it seems scary how in
[59:24] the world are we going to do that but
[59:28] you see God it's just the Lord just
[59:31] taking control within it and I never
[59:33] forget you know yeah there was
[59:35] opposition there was people that became
[59:37] fearful of it but I'll never forget the
[59:40] one midweek service where the Spirit of
[59:43] the Lord moved down
[59:44] and brother bill here here the Lord just
[59:47] in the Lord used him to speak to us as a
[59:50] church at that time on a midweek service
[59:52] and it spoke to us at that time and and
[59:55] I believe it said it like this and I
[59:57] recall it that I have ordained my
[59:59] servant James Browning to lead you over
[1:00:02] there through this transaction to this
[1:00:05] place I'm telling you right now there
[1:00:08] was not a question in the building there
[1:00:11] of what God that that was God that had
[1:00:13] spoke there that night it was something
[1:00:16] that resonated in the hearts of people
[1:00:18] I'm looking at different ones right now
[1:00:20] that you stood on the banknote I'm
[1:00:24] looking at different ones of you you and
[1:00:25] your husband stirring on the baton or
[1:00:27] you know brother Louie went on home to
[1:00:29] be with the Lord but brother Louie was
[1:00:30] one of the first one by the lily Miranda
[1:00:32] he said we'll be there at the bank
[1:00:35] different ones right through the
[1:00:36] assembly said we'll guarantee this note
[1:00:41] but it was bigger payments than we had
[1:00:44] ever did before but God by His mercy in
[1:00:49] seven years everything was paid off for
[1:00:57] a little group there in no way in the
[1:00:59] world I reasoning could have wrapped
[1:01:01] around that but as I'll tell you what it
[1:01:03] was it was moving in season and intact
[1:01:06] it moved right into the hearts of you
[1:01:09] his people and you recognized hey this
[1:01:11] is our building
[1:01:12] oh my but what I'm saying is that look
[1:01:18] within that there was not a place that
[1:01:21] we could find per se in the scripture
[1:01:23] that spoke to us regarding that
[1:01:26] particular thing but seek God it's just
[1:01:29] like when we're praying for something
[1:01:31] and somebody might be praying about do I
[1:01:33] move here or do I move there or maybe
[1:01:36] not even praying at all but the Spirit
[1:01:37] of God will move down and say what's
[1:01:39] tomorrow on your job this and this could
[1:01:42] be there
[1:01:43] I believe he's still the same God I
[1:01:45] believe God cares about everything
[1:01:48] tail in our life and I still believe
[1:01:50] that God is glorified in our midst he
[1:01:54] works the same way do I have let me to
[1:01:58] say like this do I have to have that
[1:02:00] every service no but I've gotta have God
[1:02:05] I've gotta have God every service Jesus
[1:02:08] Christ must be present but however he
[1:02:11] wants to work I want him to work
[1:02:15] hallelujah I never forget you know the
[1:02:18] times of different ones were going
[1:02:19] through situations and the Spirit of God
[1:02:21] moved down and spoke you know even right
[1:02:24] here within the services now I hope you
[1:02:26] understand what I'm getting to is that
[1:02:28] there were needs this was not people
[1:02:32] just showing up and say well you know
[1:02:34] God has used me in the past to speak in
[1:02:36] tongues so we're coming to church
[1:02:37] tonight and and I believe I'm gonna
[1:02:39] speak in tongues and I it is not that
[1:02:41] way at all it is based on what is a need
[1:02:44] and that's the same way it is listen
[1:02:46] that's the same way when it comes down
[1:02:48] from ministry I'm not preaching what I
[1:02:50] want to preach I'm preaching what God
[1:02:53] has laid upon my heart even this subject
[1:02:58] right here and God has really opened it
[1:03:00] and expanded it out but way back I think
[1:03:03] it was even in September when a lot of
[1:03:05] these things we were looking at it but
[1:03:07] when I come back even from the
[1:03:08] Philippines I said God does this what
[1:03:10] you want for right now because I
[1:03:12] realized that God is able to move and
[1:03:16] minister to the needs just as he has
[1:03:19] need of it but this is what he wanted
[1:03:23] this is what we had needeth I afraid God
[1:03:27] just helped us that we can grow within
[1:03:30] this of godly edification Paul would say
[1:03:34] like this in verse 33 for God is not the
[1:03:37] author of confusion but of peace as in
[1:03:41] all churches of the saints now I'm just
[1:03:45] going to just you know just look at a
[1:03:48] few things let me just drop a few points
[1:03:50] here that the the use and of everyone of
[1:03:53] this of the gifts brother Graham would
[1:03:56] tell us over and over in different place
[1:03:57] in the message it's to edify it's to
[1:04:00] melt together
[1:04:01] the body of Jesus Christ is not to bring
[1:04:05] divisions over and over he would say
[1:04:08] that and I love how brother Brown would
[1:04:10] say says God's got some to preach the
[1:04:12] gospel some to teach the gospel some to
[1:04:15] play music some to be deacons speak with
[1:04:19] tongues interpret tongs pray for the
[1:04:21] sick prophets all of those are said in
[1:04:23] the church to edify it and bring the
[1:04:26] church together and everything it goes
[1:04:29] together is to make us love him more
[1:04:32] brother Brent tells he said seeing
[1:04:34] visions he said well seeing visions is
[1:04:36] as natural to me as you getting hungry
[1:04:39] you just get hungry he said visions just
[1:04:42] come to me that way then brother Ram
[1:04:44] goes in to talk about how people are
[1:04:46] born he said to be singers and is the
[1:04:49] same quote they born to be singers he
[1:04:50] talks about how that he was actually
[1:04:52] going to you know play by piano four
[1:04:55] four four four Becky and he and his
[1:04:57] sister meet he walked up there and they
[1:04:59] were you know gonna try to strike a few
[1:05:01] chords he said here comes this little
[1:05:02] eight-year-old boy no brother Brandon
[1:05:06] when he describes that I'm glad he
[1:05:07] describes it this way he said here he
[1:05:09] come he said you know without any shoes
[1:05:11] on his feet his hairs all messed up and
[1:05:13] looks all raggedy he don't even look put
[1:05:15] together he's about that little boy
[1:05:16] looked at him said what's he trying to
[1:05:18] do but then said I was just trying to
[1:05:20] pick out a few chords
[1:05:21] he said that little boy took ahold that
[1:05:23] piano he said he started playing songs
[1:05:25] he said he played silent night he said
[1:05:27] then he ran over to the star-spangled
[1:05:29] banner' and I want you to notice by
[1:05:31] looks he didn't look like he'd have that
[1:05:34] kind of a gift you know God has a way of
[1:05:40] just you know he loves to display his
[1:05:44] majesty
[1:05:45] God will take things remember like they
[1:05:47] told about Paul they said all dollars
[1:05:49] Madi and speech and you know
[1:05:51] contemptible you know and looks I mean
[1:05:53] look at him he looks real weak Paul let
[1:05:55] him know that it is not the man's
[1:05:57] stature
[1:05:58] it is the Word of God that Pat's power
[1:06:02] and here brother Graham tells you said
[1:06:05] that little boy said he was just a mass
[1:06:07] he said he was just a master at playing
[1:06:09] that piano he was born a musician it was
[1:06:12] a gift to know how to do it there was
[1:06:14] something in him that just told him how
[1:06:16] to do it and brother branham he would go
[1:06:19] on and in another place here he would
[1:06:21] deal with he says of these nine
[1:06:23] spiritual gifts and he says now if we'll
[1:06:25] just it will just let the Holy Spirit
[1:06:28] have his way they perfectly operate if
[1:06:31] you just won't get excited and try to
[1:06:33] just take what you think yourself now I
[1:06:35] don't think anybody's getting excited
[1:06:37] here but I think what we need to do is
[1:06:40] we need to make ourselves available and
[1:06:43] we're making ourselves even more
[1:06:45] available to where God how that you if
[1:06:48] you want to use me you know even
[1:06:52] testifying it is edifying to the body
[1:06:57] everything remember what I've said many
[1:06:59] of these things things that take place
[1:07:01] in an individual ministry you know there
[1:07:04] is people that even that I think right
[1:07:06] now I can't I won't call the individual
[1:07:08] out but the person that very many times
[1:07:11] and some of the times that here it is
[1:07:13] I'll end up getting a card in the mail
[1:07:15] and I'm not telling you all to send
[1:07:17] cards but this person they will send me
[1:07:19] and it has been that way over the years
[1:07:21] they'll send me and sometimes there's a
[1:07:23] letter tucked inside of there and the
[1:07:24] way things are wrote but I can tell you
[1:07:26] right now it's every time it's precisely
[1:07:28] right on time and the things that will
[1:07:32] be mentioned and and just you know just
[1:07:35] in that time just encouragement and
[1:07:37] edification you say what do you do with
[1:07:39] those well well in my office at home I
[1:07:41] have got four baskets and I'd keep every
[1:07:47] one of those cards and things that have
[1:07:50] come in not just from that person but
[1:07:53] from others as well I get a little down
[1:07:56] I reach back and I pulled that out and I
[1:07:58] say aha devil let me just set this up on
[1:08:03] my desk you can go ahead and read it now
[1:08:05] I'll get this one
[1:08:09] that is no different
[1:08:11] brother branham walking down when he got
[1:08:13] a little down brother Bram said he would
[1:08:14] walk down in his den and he would look
[1:08:17] at his hunting trophies and people
[1:08:18] probably thought he was looking at his
[1:08:20] hunting trophies and admired him for the
[1:08:21] rest of that's not what he was doing he
[1:08:23] said when he looked back on that hunting
[1:08:25] trophy sometimes he might see a trinket
[1:08:26] over here that somebody sent him and he
[1:08:29] says it takes him back to a time of how
[1:08:32] God had used him it would encourage him
[1:08:36] amen
[1:08:37] oh my boy this is just down where the
[1:08:40] rubber meets the road in it nothing
[1:08:42] fancy about this is just straight-out
[1:08:44] baloney baloney sandwiches tonight but
[1:08:47] they operate perfectly you know and
[1:08:49] brother Graham said this is where many
[1:08:51] times he said people make mistakes
[1:08:52] people sometimes they get all influenced
[1:08:55] and kind of heat up a little by the Holy
[1:08:56] Ghost and but he said it's wonderful to
[1:08:59] be stimulated but just wait on the Lord
[1:09:02] he said God God will use us he'll use
[1:09:05] all that he said just be satisfied you
[1:09:07] know you're his look what he says he if
[1:09:10] he wants to use you he'll sure do it he
[1:09:12] knows where you're at God don't God
[1:09:16] don't need to say you to have a forward
[1:09:18] address he knows where you're at now I
[1:09:21] want you to think of this here in
[1:09:22] tonight there's three distinct parts and
[1:09:25] I want to hone in on this part of it
[1:09:28] there's really three distinct parts with
[1:09:29] this how can you make a V how can you be
[1:09:34] make make yourself available to be used
[1:09:37] or to receive anything from God like
[1:09:41] this if you stay in it so you Paul all
[1:09:45] the way through this chapter even when
[1:09:46] you become together if when you come
[1:09:47] together if you come together when all
[1:09:49] of that is dealing will come together
[1:09:52] how can in the other point how can you
[1:09:54] be used unless you're in a place
[1:09:57] spiritually to be used see this is where
[1:10:00] it comes down to stewardship
[1:10:04] anything remember Satan is going to be
[1:10:08] out to try to stifle it always got to be
[1:10:13] mindful that that don't mean looking
[1:10:14] around fearful it just means just let
[1:10:18] your life be refreshed in the love of
[1:10:20] God Jude would say it in Jude one you
[1:10:23] know building ourselves up you know most
[1:10:26] holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost
[1:10:27] keeping yourselves in the love of God
[1:10:29] the other thing is is that when we look
[1:10:31] at this and we think of the whole body
[1:10:32] now think of this here we come together
[1:10:35] Thursday nights Sunday nights
[1:10:38] but us coming together here and how God
[1:10:42] is will even move right here it's very
[1:10:46] much that we have to be mindful of what
[1:10:50] even is done outside of church is that
[1:10:55] many of the times you know brother
[1:10:57] Graham said they'd read about st. Martin
[1:10:58] and you see how the Holy Ghost was
[1:11:00] moving he said but many people what they
[1:11:02] fail to look at was st. Martin is how
[1:11:04] much time he spent in prayer this is
[1:11:09] these are things that when we look at it
[1:11:11] I want to just kind of take a little bit
[1:11:14] of a direction here with this right now
[1:11:19] in out of Romans 15 Warren and I want to
[1:11:22] examine in another part of edifying that
[1:11:25] must be it must be in order for that way
[1:11:29] even when we come together for there to
[1:11:30] be edifying and however God is going and
[1:11:33] however the Lord would use us in Romans
[1:11:35] 15 1 Paul said we then that are strong
[1:11:38] ought to bear the infirmities of the
[1:11:41] weak and not to please ourselves now we
[1:11:46] know it's not my strong he's talking
[1:11:47] about fully converted filled with the
[1:11:49] Holy Ghost let every one of us please
[1:11:53] his neighbor for his good not not for
[1:11:57] your good for your neighbors good to
[1:12:00] edification
[1:12:02] for even Christ pleased not himself but
[1:12:08] as it is written the reproaches of them
[1:12:11] that reproached thee fell on me hmm
[1:12:20] so when I when I I'm just just looking
[1:12:23] at this and moving down through here if
[1:12:25] we could just I want you two to skip
[1:12:27] ahead those who run the slide skip ahead
[1:12:29] to Roman's 14 and you look at this in
[1:12:32] Romans 14 it's referring now Paul this
[1:12:34] is what Paul is referring back to for a
[1:12:35] moment 15 and Paul is dealing with this
[1:12:38] in verse 17 about the eating meat and
[1:12:42] and so forth and how that that would
[1:12:44] seem to be you know a troubling among
[1:12:47] the the congregation you know because of
[1:12:49] many of those things were offered to
[1:12:51] idols and things like that and you know
[1:12:53] sometimes you had those with the real
[1:12:54] weak conscience and it could really
[1:12:56] bother so verse 17 for the kingdom of
[1:12:59] God is not meat and drink but
[1:13:03] righteousness and peace and joy in the
[1:13:07] Holy Ghost for he that in these things
[1:13:11] serveth Christ is acceptable to God and
[1:13:16] approved of men now this is something
[1:13:20] where a person is making a decision even
[1:13:24] inwardly even in regards to how will
[1:13:28] this affect the body and nobody else in
[1:13:31] the body knows about it maybe your wife
[1:13:34] or your husband knows about it but
[1:13:35] nobody else knows about this decision
[1:13:38] but yet you look at the situation and
[1:13:40] you make a choice even though you have
[1:13:43] Liberty but you realize I'm gonna serve
[1:13:47] Christ in this right here because I
[1:13:51] don't want to offend anybody
[1:13:57] you're with me verse 19 let us therefore
[1:14:02] follow after that means seek after the
[1:14:06] things which make for peace and things
[1:14:10] wherewith one may edify another we want
[1:14:15] to seek for peace we want to seek for
[1:14:19] whatever would edify one another not
[1:14:22] what edifies us because remember that is
[1:14:27] never of God self edification is never
[1:14:30] of God that's what Paul is even dealing
[1:14:33] with in our opening text in first
[1:14:35] Corinthians 14 26 that was dealing with
[1:14:38] something of self edification it's not
[1:14:41] self it's God who uses his gifts so
[1:14:46] things let's follow after the things
[1:14:48] which make for beats and things are with
[1:14:51] one may edify another now Paul comes
[1:14:54] into this with a meet in verse 24 meat
[1:14:56] for me you know for the sake of eating
[1:14:59] meat destroying not the work of God all
[1:15:02] things indeed are pure but it is evil
[1:15:05] for that man who eateth with offence now
[1:15:10] remember some were remember what Paul is
[1:15:13] dealing with is some they realized that
[1:15:16] these this meat that they were eating
[1:15:19] had actually been from an animal that
[1:15:21] had been offered to an idol to a to a
[1:15:25] true to another God and so to them in
[1:15:28] their mind they're looking at it if I
[1:15:31] eat this because remember when you would
[1:15:33] bring an offering you also ate of that
[1:15:35] offering so to them and their mind
[1:15:38] they're looking at this a person that
[1:15:40] could be weak in their mind and let me
[1:15:42] just say it to you like this we are not
[1:15:44] to look down upon people who would be
[1:15:46] weak in their mind but you trust by
[1:15:50] God's grace and through real edification
[1:15:53] that they grow in the Lord is that right
[1:16:01] amen so you know it's not like somebody
[1:16:04] coming in here you know when somebody
[1:16:05] says whatever the sudden you know I'd
[1:16:07] come to church here you know but you all
[1:16:08] have drums you might want to find
[1:16:10] another church
[1:16:12] but saying I would come here but you
[1:16:14] know you all have you know uh you know
[1:16:17] streaming you might want to find another
[1:16:19] church then but said no what if they're
[1:16:23] weak no sometimes there's things we have
[1:16:25] to really discern out he understand
[1:16:30] we're looking at some things here and
[1:16:33] Paul is bringing together here it is
[1:16:36] good
[1:16:37] verse 28 verse 21 it is good neither to
[1:16:39] eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything
[1:16:43] we're we're we're by thy brother
[1:16:44] stumbleth or is offended or is made weak
[1:16:48] I realize this is what Paul and I really
[1:16:53] want this if you I really want you to
[1:16:55] zero in on these things right here if
[1:16:57] there's anything you really even zeroing
[1:16:59] in even more Paul right here in this
[1:17:01] remember he is edifying the body edify
[1:17:04] is to promote Christian wisdom is to
[1:17:08] build up things that we become we move
[1:17:12] in by wisdom in these things he is
[1:17:16] instructing them how to handle things
[1:17:18] that the body be not hurt that a part of
[1:17:23] the body would be not hurt because when
[1:17:24] we come to the house of God looking if
[1:17:26] there are things that are being done
[1:17:28] outside how in the world are we gonna
[1:17:30] have unity inside is that right now you
[1:17:36] look at this right here Paul didn't have
[1:17:38] Facebook to deal with
[1:17:39] we knew Paul didn't have Twitter
[1:17:42] accounts to deal with we do but it was
[1:17:44] the same spirit there's just all
[1:17:46] different kinds of avenues so here you
[1:17:51] know there when we look at it we the
[1:17:54] thing with our responsibility Paul is
[1:17:57] bringing to us a responsibility within
[1:17:59] our lives but we would live such a life
[1:18:01] that would edify the body and would not
[1:18:05] bring divisions oh my let me just let me
[1:18:09] let me go on here just a little bit
[1:18:11] there's some things here let me go on in
[1:18:13] 1st Corinthians 10 verse 23 all things
[1:18:16] are lawful for me but all things are not
[1:18:19] expedient all things are lawful for me
[1:18:21] but all things
[1:18:22] edify not
[1:18:25] well being whatever Nepal blowing back
[1:18:29] to me this with the me whatever sold in
[1:18:30] the shambles that eat asking no question
[1:18:35] for conscience sake for the earth is the
[1:18:38] Lord's and the fullness thereof pause
[1:18:40] let him know if you buy meat out of the
[1:18:42] shambles don't ask where it come from
[1:18:46] from the besides of its cat or dog girl
[1:18:49] don't ask where it come from just take
[1:18:52] it and eat it what for conscience sake
[1:18:56] pose let them know this is even in your
[1:18:59] life how to live in victory if any of
[1:19:03] them that believe not bid you to a feast
[1:19:05] and ye be disposed to go whatsoever set
[1:19:09] before you eat asking no question for
[1:19:12] conscience sake but if any man say unto
[1:19:16] you this is offered in sacrifice unto
[1:19:18] idols eat not for his sake that showed
[1:19:21] it and for his conscience sake for the
[1:19:24] earth is the lord's and the fullness
[1:19:25] thereof conscience I say not thine own
[1:19:30] but of the other for why is my liberty
[1:19:35] judge of another man's cost enough
[1:19:37] Paul's asking the question what he's
[1:19:39] wanting him to think
[1:19:41] for I by grace be a partaker why am i
[1:19:45] evil spoke enough for that for which I
[1:19:47] give things whether they're for you eat
[1:19:51] or drink or whatsoever you do do all to
[1:19:53] the glory of God give none offence
[1:19:56] neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles
[1:19:59] nor to the Church of God even as I
[1:20:02] please all men in all things not seeking
[1:20:07] mine own profit but the profit of many
[1:20:11] that they may be saved Paul is teaching
[1:20:16] the thoughtfulness about the body this
[1:20:19] is not compromised but you see sometimes
[1:20:24] listen to me now sometimes the simple
[1:20:27] edifying is not advertising your
[1:20:30] liberties there's things I'll tell you
[1:20:35] that it doesn't matter where you go
[1:20:37] there's things that still and things
[1:20:40] that could bother somebody there's
[1:20:42] things listen to me now I'm getting real
[1:20:44] personal now there's things that you can
[1:20:46] post on the internet things that you can
[1:20:49] put out there and you might say well
[1:20:51] I've got liberties I've got this and
[1:20:53] I've got that already you're in a
[1:20:54] defense you need to think about
[1:20:57] everything you do you are a
[1:20:59] representation of the kingdom of God you
[1:21:02] are a representation of your family you
[1:21:06] are representation of everything that
[1:21:08] stands for you are representation of
[1:21:10] what this message is all about you don't
[1:21:14] want to be a wrong advertisement of what
[1:21:18] it's all about there's some things that
[1:21:22] just you know to say it you say brother
[1:21:24] Sammy do you get on it I don't get on it
[1:21:26] at all but I know enough when the Holy
[1:21:28] Ghost pushes and presses on my heart to
[1:21:30] know that there are things that don't
[1:21:33] need to be said there are things that
[1:21:35] don't need to be mentioned there's a lot
[1:21:37] of times that there are words and things
[1:21:40] that are divisive that bring divisions
[1:21:42] there that calls hindrances here
[1:21:49] it's true everything except there's got
[1:21:53] to be an edifying but sometimes they
[1:21:55] edify is what we in ourselves so you
[1:21:58] know what somebody may not understand
[1:22:00] this come on somebody not trying to dig
[1:22:05] up quotes I'm not I'm gonna put all
[1:22:06] these quotes out there you're in the
[1:22:08] wrong spirit God don't want you dividing
[1:22:13] the word of faith book he wants you
[1:22:16] living out the word and there might be
[1:22:19] things that are entirely fine but don't
[1:22:21] post it we're interested in people being
[1:22:29] helped not questions arising we know
[1:22:33] what questions and people's minds
[1:22:36] arising of what setting here we don't
[1:22:38] want that we want Jesus Christ when he
[1:22:41] comes in our midst he has the right
[1:22:43] alone we have to be mindful of it you
[1:22:50] see many times we're looking for I want
[1:22:52] to see the power of God I want to see
[1:22:53] the power of God and said you and God
[1:22:55] said I want to see the power of God take
[1:22:58] control of your fingers the power of God
[1:23:00] take over your motives the power of God
[1:23:03] it takes over in humility that says I'm
[1:23:05] not going to post this preach brother
[1:23:11] said this is write down where the rubber
[1:23:16] meets the road is not a time to air at
[1:23:20] the Flaminius st. right up front it is
[1:23:22] not a place to air grievances well I've
[1:23:27] got to get this off my chest how about
[1:23:29] taking it to the Lord in prayer
[1:23:32] if you're offended don't go to somebody
[1:23:35] else and spread and spew your poison to
[1:23:39] somebody else take it to the Lord in
[1:23:41] prayer I'm not just preaching to you I'm
[1:23:43] preaching to you who's on the internet
[1:23:44] too he's putting everybody is coming
[1:23:48] right down to a couch near you everybody
[1:23:55] that's how serious this is edifying that
[1:23:59] is that that that that in order that the
[1:24:02] whole egos can work freely and let me
[1:24:08] just say that is right upfront there's
[1:24:09] enough of working to keep sin out of the
[1:24:12] church I don't need people advertising
[1:24:16] it you said I thought you said are
[1:24:19] things that were permissible there's
[1:24:20] some things that undoubtedly do not need
[1:24:23] to be on the internet who Lord Jesus we
[1:24:28] don't want to stumble people good good
[1:24:34] and this yeah I mean there's some
[1:24:36] pictures you have family pictures you
[1:24:38] know what they belong in your family
[1:24:40] album not on the internet come on
[1:24:46] somebody it's understanding about these
[1:24:49] things really you know people say well
[1:24:50] you're not everybody ought to be fine
[1:24:52] with Christmas now everybody ought to be
[1:24:55] this but not everybody is hello somebody
[1:24:59] we're brother Samuel they just need to
[1:25:01] be mature in the Lord I'll just read
[1:25:03] scriptures that where within these
[1:25:05] things we have to be mindful I hope this
[1:25:10] is clear just to see just as it's coming
[1:25:13] just as it's I'm just trusting in him
[1:25:15] I'm not trusting in myself because I
[1:25:17] need we need him to make it clear but we
[1:25:19] don't want people to stumble I don't
[1:25:22] want somebody to stumble amen I'm
[1:25:26] because to me what God has given us in
[1:25:28] this hour this glorious revelation this
[1:25:32] message that brings about a living
[1:25:35] reality of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:25:38] it brings us from off the pages and
[1:25:41] brings it right down real in our life
[1:25:43] it's a life changing word that brings
[1:25:46] sons and daughters of God in the full
[1:25:49] maturity back into their sonship amen
[1:25:53] it's circumcise us places us back into
[1:25:56] the company why it is a promise that God
[1:25:59] has made in this hour we don't want any
[1:26:02] leaven
[1:26:05] we want the crew the Christ of God we
[1:26:09] want the Lord Jesus Christ to have full
[1:26:12] preeminence in our life and I'll say it
[1:26:14] like this if there's pictures and
[1:26:16] whatever more that you've got that you
[1:26:18] know
[1:26:19] oh those deftly shouldn't be posted they
[1:26:21] might even be things that you leave a
[1:26:23] one in your family album old Jesus they
[1:26:27] might be things where you need to think
[1:26:29] about how you're dressing things you're
[1:26:32] doing you might need to just say Lord I
[1:26:34] want to dispose of this but dispose of
[1:26:36] anything in me that is not edifying you
[1:26:41] because everything we do brother Brandon
[1:26:43] brought us down into this and I'm
[1:26:45] closing brother Brent brings us down and
[1:26:51] reminds us in the adoption series and he
[1:26:56] tells us he says you must remember he
[1:27:00] says your walk with God he said how he
[1:27:04] said you must be in harmony with God and
[1:27:07] harmony with one another and he dealt
[1:27:11] with that and he took us into Eichen how
[1:27:13] aiken got into things and aiken troubled
[1:27:17] the body and they just say it to you
[1:27:20] like this we're not here to have a pity
[1:27:22] party for the devil if there's something
[1:27:25] where the devil has pulled any wool over
[1:27:26] any eyes we are here as sons and
[1:27:29] daughters of God to say get out of here
[1:27:31] you don't have no place here
[1:27:35] are you with I believe that that we need
[1:27:39] that we really need this this should be
[1:27:43] a real edification I'm not saying we
[1:27:45] don't have it but I just say as the Lord
[1:27:47] just bringing it to my heart I I just
[1:27:48] felt pressed to come back into this here
[1:27:51] this week and let me just close here
[1:27:54] Ephesians 4:29
[1:27:57] we'll just close on this one let no
[1:28:00] corrupt communication proceed out of
[1:28:06] your mouth corrupt a meaning it's
[1:28:10] kinkers okay it's Pinker
[1:28:15] but that which is good to the use of
[1:28:20] edifying that it may Minister grace unto
[1:28:26] the hearers brother Brian would tell us
[1:28:30] like this he says in Christ the mystery
[1:28:33] when he gave look he took time in the
[1:28:35] beginning of Christ a mystery and I
[1:28:37] thought you know I've said this many
[1:28:39] times over but I look at the things that
[1:28:42] were said such counsel in the beginning
[1:28:45] of that message Christ as the mystery of
[1:28:47] God revealed and such counsel he gave us
[1:28:49] as a body of believers
[1:28:51] for what reason that Christ the mystery
[1:28:55] may be clearly displayed in our lives
[1:28:59] it's not the big foxes that spoil the
[1:29:03] vines it's the little foxes that spoil
[1:29:07] the vines but bream says love one
[1:29:11] another any love one another
[1:29:17] anyhow talk nice about one another
[1:29:26] he said say nice things about one other
[1:29:28] he said and then the Holy Spirit is
[1:29:31] pleased I want to talk about making
[1:29:34] things up I'm not talking I'm making
[1:29:36] things up that ain't you that I mean you
[1:29:38] just that's lying to that's a real good
[1:29:43] faith no God don't want you to lie
[1:29:45] that's not edification that's falsehood
[1:29:49] but there's there there's things that
[1:29:51] that that you know that when we when we
[1:29:53] look at it that there's things that we
[1:29:55] can say to be able to minister grace to
[1:29:59] one another and to edify things that we
[1:30:02] can say the brand wouldn't even say it
[1:30:05] like this he said when you know he said
[1:30:07] maybe he said there's a little something
[1:30:09] between this brother and this brother
[1:30:11] he said don't say anything that would
[1:30:14] side or stir this brother up against man
[1:30:16] he said but on the contrary he said say
[1:30:19] something about this brother drops some
[1:30:21] things about this brother he said that
[1:30:23] will provoke this other one provoke unto
[1:30:26] love and good works
[1:30:31] but say I'm just saying but what you're
[1:30:34] saying is the word and the word has
[1:30:37] power within it amen
[1:30:41] when I talk about making things up but
[1:30:42] we're talking about edifying edifying
[1:30:45] let let no corrupt communication and we
[1:30:47] you and I we all know hey we've learned
[1:30:49] this from when we was in kindergarten
[1:30:51] and preschool if you ain't got nothing
[1:30:53] good to say something you got a visual
[1:30:55] image already don't say nothing at all
[1:30:58] right

[1:31:04] all men as much as lieth within you

[1:32:03] fervent prayer warrior it's something
[1:32:07] that maybe is not seen or all-together

[1:32:33] body can be edified to realize the Lord
[1:32:37] that and I believe we realize it the
[1:32:41] Lord you would help us to be more
[1:32:43] sensitive that's why you bring these
[1:32:44] things to us you stir up our pure minds
[1:32:47] you may help us to be sensitive with it

[1:33:34] things even Lord of myself just for just
[1:33:36] that may be the limited place is Lord at

[1:34:06] that beats here tonight that every life
[1:34:09] Lord as a son and daughter of God they
[1:34:12] want to do that which is pleasing to you
[1:34:14] nor to be able to edify the body of
[1:34:17] Jesus Christ to be a vessel that is set
[1:34:20] aside that's used of you Lord for your
[1:34:23] glory God I pray tonight Lord forgive us
[1:34:30] Lord in areas Lord that where we've let
[1:34:34] down God as your grace comes to minister
[1:34:38] may it Lord the searching within the
[1:34:42] hearts man not cease but may it continue
[1:34:44] to move forward may this become Lord
[1:34:46] that which is ever before us now to
