you Lord this morning will you come just break the word to our hearts anoint Lord speaker and here together we pray that in all things you might receive glory and honor Lord in Jesus name he god bless you certainly good to be in the house of the Lord and good to be gathered with you this morning and I definitely can concur with brother Brian I think this is the third day of sunshine since since but we just welcome back sister Caroline amen it's so good to be in the house of the Lord and want to just mention to you Lord willing to be an email coming out to you of Senate and it should be coming out to you tomorrow brother Jason DeMars is gonna be here with us on this coming Thursday it's the first time brother Jason DeMars would have been here with us and what brother Jason DeMars he does mission work with the Persian countries and specifically Turkey with the Iranian refugees that are gathered there there's a video clip inside that message that will take you to YouTube and allow you to watch about 3035 minutes the film so you get a little bit of a background before brother Jason DeMars before he'll be here on this coming Thursday and I believe it would kind of help a little bit give a little bit more of a background and to see what God is doing one of the statistics that's on there that just it just was watching it again and looking at it there is approximately right now they they identify fifteen hundred believers in Iran fifteen hundred that's incredible in that video of the Persian Persia unveiled it takes you into the lives of some of those brothers who are one or two of them are actually pastors there in Turkey and actually what they had to go through in the Iranian prison that you usually don't come out of and such a testimony of the power of God of how the Lord moved there and then you these are brothers and the work that God has put that burden upon brother Jason to Mars and we so thank God for that don't leave we need each and every one and it certainly is a body and we just thank God for His grace and so this morning let's look into the word and Exodus chapter 3 now wasn't intended on this I actually you may times you hear me say this and with his only work hit a little Paul's button from where we were going on these previous Sunday's the Spirit of the Lord directed me down this this pathway in the channel we started looking at it on Thursday night and I want to follow up with this starting out here this morning on victory over discouragement so evidently God knows he knows what we need so if he says pause and go this direction we just obey Him amen is that right I mean if you order a hamburger and I bring you our chicken you're gonna say this you've got the order wrong right I can only serve the food he only fixes what we have need of verse 11 just two verse description will let you have your seats and Moses said unto God Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt and he said certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountain I want you to notice this certainly I will be with thee and this shall be a token a sign a distinguishing mark unto you that I have cynthy when thou has brought forth the people out of Egypt ye shall serve God upon this mountain may God bless his word bless you as you're being seated we started looking at this on Thursday night and I'm gonna run order willing this will run a little bit of a different angle here discouragement itself is something that every one of us face have faced and will face there's things that we would love to be able to look at and be able to have something in this life to say I'll never be discouraged but that longing them that we have there is a place where they will no longer be any discouragement but yet it's just like everything else it's many times how we look at it you know sometimes there's things that God will do to direct us and instruct us and guide us in his word tell us don't do this do that and we need that God will also lead us and guide us and show us truth on how that we ought to be looking at things within his word and then there's times that God will move back and actually show us in his word how that some of the behind the scenes and how things are working and how that we and ourselves need to actually look and conduct ourselves in these times the one thing about it is that we realize that it falls to us in the midst when discouragement comes that it falls to us what are we going to do about it when discouragement does come and it should ought to be a question that resolved or resound in our hearts what what do I do when discouragement comes and I think no doubt that probably every one of us as believers we would know that the real resource and what we need to go to is the Word of God but sometimes even when we go to the Word of God we go back to the word and we come with our same mold of thinking our same thinking that has been a channel and pathway that has actually got us to where we're at the word met the Word of God itself never leads us to discouragement but the Word of God itself if within our channel if our channel isn't exactly properly correct then it has to be realigned and remoulded in order that God's Word can go forward so when we look at this here this morning you see within Moses life and you know to receive victory in the midst of discouragement just turn these down just a little bit Ben please just a tad bit we would see that in discouragement to really receive victory over discouragement it's by the Word of God and when you look at how that God was speaking here is the Lord speaking to Moses personally he knows that God is talking to him he knows that God is calling him for the duty but yet in the midst of this time he says Who am I so here Moses is in a place where he has come to a place to know and recognize his own human weakness and within that God would would as see fit that Moses by the way I am certainly going to be with you and this is gonna be assigned to you a token I'm gonna bring you right back to this place and that'll be a sign that I've sent you now my question is did Moses not know that God was sending him he did when he got down to Egypt did he not know that God had sent him he did he knew that God had sent him but Moses God is mindful and God is showing to us his faithfulness and mindfulness of our frailty and our frame that God would actually provide tokens signs that would actually speak back to us now think of it this mountain itself was not a mountain that would talk but yet when Moses would come back to this place to think of it the journeying out of Egypt and and things that they had went through within just those few chapters and to come back to this moment and yet when notice when Moses would come to this place it would be something when he would get there that seeing that mountain it would actually be able to refresh him it would encourage and now most of you know even when you've started out some of you were schooling some of you on your job and maybe you're on training and some of you you just get married and other things come along and you know it's helpful you receive encouragement bet you're on the right pathway it encourages you when when certain things are let known like hey I think that you're doing really well here on that drywall all the mudding and all of these things are going well or hey you know what you stabbed that person good with the needle you did exactly right all of those things are necessary to encourage us we we look for those encouraging things and you know what God knows now you can look at it and say oh Samuel I don't need any encouragement you're lying you do need encouragement I need encouragement all around us we have all sorts of things that would actually if we focus on it it could actually so discourage us and drive us into such a depression and when I look at this throughout the journey that even when he would see this you know sometimes there's things you can just look at and it will actually help you with what you're going through how many times brother branham said all of those things he says I have pictures of my hunts I had trophies mountain and he said sometimes when there's such chaos going on in the house from people coming in and out I slept down he said to that din and I'll just think back to those hunts he said then he said I'll look at that picture and I'll see that brother and that brother was with me on the hunt and then I remember how God met that need and I remember and he says bout that time he said it Julian takes a couple of them he said I'm back up there on the first floor and I'm ready to start ministering the needs again see God knows how to encourage you and I now I want to just look at this example here you know brother branham here he was in a time in his ministry and you know it probably would be something for you and I that maybe we would be able to easier understand it if it had been something that had taken place in his life where this complex had been built before the seals were open but it wasn't it was something that had been developed over time and it actually came to an apex to a point after the seals were open where the brother man will actually talk about it three months after the seals have been open and it begins to go through what has taken place within his life and now one thing that we look brother BAM here he is in the midst of this time and I'm just gonna refer to it he talks about how that God had spoke to him and said I'm gonna give you an everlasting sign and brother BAM is driving along the roadway and he says Lord where is that everlasting sign that you've told me about and brother bam is driving along through there and he said the Lord spoke to him and said I'm gonna give you an everlasting sign and blow them said he said that again and he said he told me look westward from where you're at notice where that where it was pointed to sign the sign was not pointed back east the sign was pointed westward you see many of the times when we're looking at it it's it's moving on when God is showing us these signs even and bringing Moses back to this mountain he's gone down to Egypt the people are brought back to this mountain it'll be a token to you it'll be assigned to you upon seeing this mountain where was this mountain this mountain was in the pathway a necessary stop in as Wednesday were coming to the promised land and here God tells the Prophet in the midst of this time to look over there to your West and where you're at and brother brems said I you know he said I just you know he said I just felt the Spirit of the Lord now slowed down the truck and I looked over and I saw a mountain with Whitecaps on it and I said I don't see no everlasting sign about that now hope you're with me he looked at that mountain and said I don't see no everlasting sign about that oh god help us to be honest it's just like when somebody saw oh yeah yeah I see it I see it I see I see what are you seeing I don't know but I see what you're saying no you don't just be honest do you know it's like sending in the in in the museum and they're saying oh did you see that cow that's sitting under that tree yeah yeah yeah where's it at underneath the tree oh come on somebody but you see the Prophet this is what I want you to don't miss this he's being honest I don't see this as an everlasting sign he just sees a mountain but notice when God moves on the scene it's now going to be a personal everlasting sign to him oh my god tells him your name is wrote all over it I thought what is it brother Brent says started getting real weak and you know he said he'd talks about how perspiration started to break out on his hands and he's begin to recognize at just that moment but the Rebbe says where I had failed God and how that I had let down on on things and brother Adam goes into talking about how that the peaks of this mountain and what he's seen here on this mountain and the Lord tells him in this place here he tells him he says he said to me that let that stand that mountain if there ever is ever a doubt in your mind remember this place come back here God gave him a place to come back to if you ever get doubt in your mind come back to this place I'll tell you what it wouldn't matter if there's an airline ticket cost a thousand dollars it would be worth it come on some but this because this is talking about the life and the commissioning the ministry right here if you ever doubt it come back to this place aren't you glad that God gives you a marker aren't you glad that you got a marker you can come back to to know where you've met God and different things that God has done in your life markers you can come back to who gave you those markers God did now look how brother branham is reading here in the message the 3rd Exodus he's just read the text here in the message the 3rd Exodus and brother man makes this statement he says not noticing before but feeling very deeply inspired of the Spirit this morning I just caught that then about serving God upon this mountain God sending his servant back where he had run from he give him the sign of a mountain never noticed it till just then this will be an eternal token unto you he's reading the text and you can hear it in the message he stops us I never noticed it till now you see what's happening he's already come now standing in jeffersonville but now in the midst of this time he solved the sign affair but being a true word prophet it's also got to be identified in the scriptures come on somebody it's got to be identified in the scriptures and here God confirming it there and then God letting it be known right here in the word I have brought you back to this mountain and this is where you'll serve me in the message indictment or the random watch these words he says now take us Lord mould us Lord take me with them I want to go with them I'm going up to Calvary now Lord by faith you don't get away from Calvary you got to go back to Calvary amen because that's where the work is finished Amen when Paul would speak in Hebrews 12 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith remember it was the prophets and has the children of God if we can only get caught up into that realm he said where you can look in that bloodstream and recognize as a son and daughter of God that your sins are completely gone and you stand as a son and daughter of God in the presence of God and then to think here in the taking of the book in this hour where he's already paid the price but now the lamb comes on the scene he takes the book it's a finishing up her redemption what does he do he reveals himself as the Lamb that has been slain there was blood all over this lamb hey man it is a time of the fullness of redemption where is it going back to Calvary understand down through the ages this this message we've received what did it have it had to be a restoring there were things that were lost there were past that were taken down through the way but we had to go back to the real starting point we didn't go back to the starting point of some Mannesmann we have taken clear back to the very mind of Almighty God and we see that same pathway that moved down through Paul's ministry so much that the Prophet could say I have preached what Paul preached and we said we're resting on that revelation is that right a lot of pathways a lot of angles no wonder the Prophet would tell us he says if you read the Bible and you don't see Jesus Christ in every verse come back to this message Christ is the mystery of God revealed go back and read the Bible again well how do you have to read it you've got to read it through a remoted way you miss me so to think of this the words that the Prophet would use now take us Lord mould us take me with them I'm going up to Calvary now Lord by faith I'm going with this congregation now just mold me over Lord I've did wrong now think of this here here recently I was going to just quit preaching the people wouldn't hear me they just kept on doing the same thing I got discouraged I built a complex now think of it he's preaching he's pouring his heart out he's putting listen everything you sacrificed it's wrapped up in this and what he's saying instead of seeing fruit actually being produced he's actually having people stand against him he's having them tell him you know what brother mom's coming to town pin your hairs up cuz we don't want him to preach in about cut hair just pin it up come on somebody they were going you see they weren't welcoming and notice it was discouraging you know matter of fact brother rod said here I have been in my life he said times I walked out of a meeting after the discernment has taken place on the platform he said they take me out putting me in the car he said I'm set they're kind of betwixt two places and I would hear people walk right by the that said in the meeting and say that what nothing but a bunch of psychology tonight and brother man said I thought God why are you letting me do this why are you letting me put myself out here like this he got discouraged and so with discouragement this is one of the things that has to be watched for he built a complex he didn't blame it on the devil are you with me he built it and a complex itself is a way of thinking you know but these are not just definitions but even how brother Bram would go through it and explain it it's a way of thinking it's a mold you get into it's a casted you just revert right back to it it's a complex but brother and notice he says Oh God a couple Sundays ago when you give me that sign out there and reading a Bible see you told Moses just as that dream was that there was a mountain too and it would be assigned to him and then right at the end of it - no I had left a lot of sick people a ministry not only in the prophetic but in teaching the word and praying for the sick HUC be objective within it God's program cannot be stopped but what was the objective just get him discouraged like what's the use what's the point don't you realize that's exactly the way the devil will fight you he will get you looking at y'all your failures and all your mistakes all your shortcomings he'll get you looking at everything else what's the use I tell you what's to use the Eternity is what's the use is to be with the Lord Jesus and to have his peace his comfort his direction his guidance right now but when a person becomes discouraged oh my it's a desperate thing they're very despondent it's almost like you can talk to them and you're just talking to a wall because it just seems like words are not penetrating but I am so glad that God know just exactly what you and I have need of it and what we have to say lord help me to catch it help me to receive it just like the Prophet said I don't see no everlasting sign about that but after God got ahold of that mountain then it became a sign to him you know what he could ride by that mountain and that mountain would preach to him come on somebody it was a sign when Moses got back to Sonya he got back to Horeb that mountain would preach to it I've sent you I've called you I've given you the strength all this way you say what would that do that would refresh Moses just say I'm ready to get up and go again no wonder we need encouragement Romans chapter 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world who's he talking to brethren he didn't say unbelievers he doesn't say the carnal believers yet this very same text of Scripture can be taken and preached for the new birth and this very same text of Scripture can be taken and ministered to you and I if you have been born again of the Spirit of God from your soul you recognize that in your soul it's sealed away but you recognize I must be careful and not be conformed to the world in my thinking it's so easy for things just to sweep but this is why Paul goes on to say to the Brethren but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind you know every once in a while if God carries this Saints will have to be renewed but the renewing of the sanctuary ain't tearing it down and down and building it back again it just means when have to have new cushions have to have new carpet maybe have to have new paint we need to renovate renew it why that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God now let's take another example here this morning a man by the name of Elijah look in the scriptures of many tremendous things that God used that spoke through Elijah and here you find in the opening of chapter 19 verse 1 this has happened right after Mount Carmel Mount Carmel has just taken place even after Mount Carmel Elijah has already ran ahead to Jezreel and met 1/2 as he was entering back in there he's already let him know that the abundance of rain I hear it and it's coming and you know what's tremendous powerful things that's already been apart and accompaniment in Elijah's ministry to see what took place on Mount Carmel Maya what a wonderful wonderful thing but it wasn't just something to be looked upon but God had a reason for doing that because remember the children of Israel right and mixed all around there they were halting between two opinions and God knows exactly how to bring the heart around of his children and the only way his heart of his children would be brought around it's not going to be by words his children will be brought around by him and he is the word so the word itself it is a person it's not just words that will turn it around listen if words can turn you around then Seminary preachers could help you out but words alone can never turn you around it takes the very power of God moving behind that word and that word to be made alive and it deals personally with your heart and you know it's not a man speaking but you know that it's God that's speaking to your heart it's just a direct communication and channel between you and the Lord now watch this here at first Kings chapter 19 verse 1 and they had told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword that's guy I don't even gonna preach on this right now but what a crybaby you know who's running that household but I'm going there today verse two then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if I make not thy life as the life of one of them by tomorrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to bare Sheba which belongs to Judah and left his servant there so he makes he comes back into Judah you know brother BAM when he deals with it and you look at those two spirits coming up even through the church age their brother BAM said between that of Judah and that of is Ray said Judah was always the more spiritual line very much like the true vine you with me so here notice when he is when he is pursued by Jezebel he comes back into bear Sheva he comes to a place that is actually occupied and a part of Judas inheritance and he leaves his servant there you know his servant no doubt was a great companion to him it was someone he could you know that would help him someone that would minister to his needs someone that could actually talk to him in different times but this time it was something that even his servant himself was not able to help Elisha it was something to wear that his servant was left right there you know even within our lives sometimes even when we look at it between husbands and wives and you know it's such a wonderful thing to be able to have that companionship and be able to minister to one another and you know sometimes the ministry from husband to wife and watch the husband is simply not about even saying anything it's simply just about being there no don't preach with me it's simply just about being there it simply may be just no a touch on the hand it simply maybe just you know just in just helping them through it because sometimes people don't feel like talking now I'm not the only one or is everybody else in here like that way sometimes as well don't raise your hands I know you I'm your pastor and I can tell you right now sometimes you don't feel like talking it might be such a situation that's happened in your life but you know what you realize it ain't the time to talk right now hello it's being sensitive it's waiting on God to know when do we move what do we do in that time let me tell you something that's the same way it is in your home that's between a husband and a wife and even with your children or grandchildren it isn't always johnny-on-the-spot acting when you feel like you have the word but you also have to have the right spirit to go along with the word sometimes it's not even about what you say it's you yourself in the way that you can create an atmosphere by having the word so in your heart and in your life that you can actually make such a melody and create such an atmosphere that it will change things in that home and there's also times that you know what you need to get away Loredana knows we're going this way but you need to get away there's some times that I just I need to go mow the grass sometimes I need to go put my hands in the dirt now I know for some of you that's work but for me that that's relaxation where I can get out there in my mind I think I think so good when you know when either I've got a bow a gun or my hands are in the dirt around my house I think so good in the midst of that time and there's some times where I just need alone time brothers can you say Amen sometimes your wife will look at you and say what do you thinking about nothing impossible for you but not for me I'm in a wonderful place called nothing land what's there nothing nothing and it's wonderful this sounds silly it might sound silly and it might sound simple but the reality of it is it's very important that we understand these things now notice this he went a day's journey into the wilderness now you see it would look like this is entirely when we see it why is he going off and leaving his servant but he's in a place right now he's so despondent of what has taken place and he goes off into the wilderness and the Bible says he came and he sat down under a juniper tree I don't know if y'all ever looked this up but I was just looking at this again the juniper tree I don't know how to really lock in it to a tree that we have here but it looks to be a tree that might be you know in height as far as maybe with you know sometimes it's not real tall but it's real spread out it has a real spread canopy where you can really get a lot of shade underneath it it's a welcome sign of refreshment and rest and here he finds a juniper tree and he goes some sets under it and he requested for himself that he might die he's in trouble he's in trouble and same way with you and I when we get off to ourselves we can get in trouble come on somebody you said brother seven women I thought you just talked about sometimes getting alone but getting alone with who getting alone with who sometimes this is of this is something that's very it's not good you know the Bible said it's not good that man should be alone and that word good in the Hebrew is spelled be a V it's not good that man should be alone the word alone nothing word good sorry the word alone is spelled BA D it's bad and he requested for himself that he might die and said it is enough now O Lord take my life for I am NOT better than my father's aren't you glad that you don't hold the keys you're not going nowhere till God is finished and you better make sure that you're always ready to go because you never know when you're finished there's none of you have or me included don't even have the guarantee of tomorrow or even hours from now I don't care how young you are you don't have no guarantee you need to make sure that you are ready to go and ready to go means that you are so locked in that the reason that I'm here in this life is to serve his purpose I'm not here for me I'm not here for any other reason I'm here to serve his purpose Lord let me die let me go home Lord I'm no better than my father's and as he lay and slept under a juniper tree behold then an angel touched him and said unto Him arise and eat you let him sleep that he's came and touched him rise eat a hoot and behold there was cake Baken on the coals and a cruse of water and his head he didn't even have to leave his bedroom and go to the kitchen table it was right there right beside him the nourishment he needed was right beside him and they angel touched him I'd wake up eat drink take nourishment I just set up no doubt he's in such a condition right now he don't know is it Tuesday is it Wednesday well Sunday just yesterday you don't know but God said I'm not asking you what day it is this is all I want you to do right now rise up eat and then I'm gonna put you back to sleep god knows what he needed he didn't need a sermon right now come on somebody he was completely washed out as a matter of fact brother better put it like this his nerves were already overworked he is having a breakdown but LEM said he was frustrated he said the Elijah was in a place that many of us get into many times let me read a few of those places we get into them at different times he tells us even warns us as ministers and I believe it's fitting to us as people of God but them says you watch after your Mount Carmel experiences he said you watch you're gonna have a juniper tree wherever a man has a blessing and the power of God pulls down and does something look out Satan's on the track remember the next day Monday after a good day on Sunday it's gonna be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock the confidence out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you his nerves were already shot mr. Behm says now he said there's men that can overworked themselves they don't say Millennials but it says there's men that can under work themselves some of you'll get that there's some that are overworked and some that are under work come on somebody they'll name nobody's names but you notice boo damn goes on to this he said you know he said God's got a juniper tree in those times or else they're gonna go to pieces but them so we all hit them experiences it always said but the mercy of Jehovah to his servant God knows your trials he knows all about it and he comes down he said he knows his servant needs some rest he just put him to sleep for a while and why is laying there waiting to recuperate or praying to die Blue Diamond goes on and into places like this and and I read from this so to understand brother Bram said there is the grace of God to his servant resting him now if I asked you what spiritual about this event you tell how they angel touched him the cakes are spiritual to [Music] sleeping is needful to if he don't get nourishment and he don't get rest he'll be no count come on somebody God knows this he'll be no count he needs rest so God don't keep waking him up and say hey Eliza I want to tell you know he just wakes him up long enough to feed him and then he puts him back down to sleep what's God doing well he knows what he's doing this man's overworked come on somebody buh-bam said these human bodies no wonder he said Jesus said come aside into the wilderness and let's rest and mother Graham says you know he said there's some guys that don't think they have to rest but we find out they burn out pretty quick if they don't take a rest they wreck up somewhere and that's where brother Billy Graham is that tonight trying to overshoot the mark these human bodies are strong but they need rest Oh mom brother mem says you need to take a little rest while he was laying then or the tree got quite and his nerves aren't you glad for that boo quite disturbs God did what kind of pills that gospel it platen his nerves it always amazed me you know my dad my dad could go to sleep at a drop the hand like this my dad I'm stressed I don't operate that way I'm stressed I'm walking and I need to go somewhere I need to do something when my dad could always just drop the head huh I'm discouraged I'm not built that way now maybe you are don't spiritualize it oh brother Samuel I'm more at rest don't try to spiritualize your sleepiness God quieten his nerves she fed him he woke him up again fed him again and put him back to sleep you mean God would treat a son of God like this yeah even a mature one God said you need a little mothering right now I'm gonna give you some mothering you stood for me I'm gonna stand by you in this time you've taken the heat you been under the pressure I'm gonna minister to your needs right now in this time brother brother said you know he said you find the time he said to where John Wesley had actually made a statement I'm afraid to rest I ain't got time to rest but the branch says you find yourself broke up if you don't take those wrists rest are important now don't anybody go planning a vacation where you miss every Sunday from now on that needs to kind of rest you need this is where you actually get rest for your soul you'll actually be encouraged in the house of God if you can receive it it ain't far from you it ain't even clear up here it's right beside you right there all you have to do is rise and eat sometimes instead of juniper trees we make shopping malls come on somebody buying clothes will never refresh you you know run your credit up come on friends sometimes you see what it is it's these these things that want to come out it Oh we'll just do this and just do that and just do this but realizing there is a place that you can really find nourishment and strength do you realize there sometimes I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but every one of us have been at places maybe different levels of discouragement and sometimes you've been in places where you just don't have the duration to even be able to utter out a prayer but from your heart you'll say lord I [Applause] don't even have the words to put together help me Lord y'all repeater God and he's mindful of that right there to come and minister what we have need of though my notice here he took him up there was a cake Baken on the coals a crucifer at his head and he did eat and drink and laid him down again you know Elijah didn't even asked where did this come from this man had already been eating miracles hey man he already had Ravens showing up to his table already what would you like today on your bologna sandwich hallelujah he didn't have to go far to receive but what he did this is what I want you to catch what he did have to do is set up and eat he had to eat what was provided it wasn't a junction I don't feel like that right now no no he needed it and then he needed to go lay back down what's what God says to him in verse 7 and the age of the Lord came again the second time and touched him and said arise and eat because the journey is too great for thee so God has somewhere he's minded him to go Elijah doesn't see this right now but God tells him arise to meet the journey is too great for thee now watch this verse 8 he arose and did eat and drink and went in the strength of that meat forty days and forty nights that was more than organic and one grass-fed that was thrown fed right there he went in the strength of this meat forty days and forty nights but where did he go to unto Horeb the Mount of God where's he doing same place that Moses went back to he's coming back to the mountain of God where God's presence has set down I want you to watch this he's going back to sacred sands that's where the prophets said he said that when there's things that can arise about your life he said when doubts and fears can arise oh he said there's that certain place that you can always come back to that you know that you met God anybody know what I'm talking about house I'm not talking about an emotion I'm talking about you can go right back to where you know he changed your life and set it up on the throne of your heart and when things around you doubts and fears and everything else where do you go back to you go back to the sacred sands where the devil cannot put one of his feet that is a place reserved for you and God alone and sometimes you've got to revisit those sacred sands your honors brother branham in the message visions of william branham brother Branham was talking about the different visions remember how that they would come go pray for this one and so forth the one about mrs. mrs. cradles mrs. Kadel mrs. Cato's daughter and and she had wrote and said come to south Boston little badminton pack up in the car and they believe out of Jeffersonville and when they leave out a Jeffersonville they realize oh they come and reel us in in a place called South Boston it's called New Boston now this is what mrs. K towhead Road it's a place called South Boston but brother branham recognized when they got out of Jeffersonville they had went on a drive for so long and they realized that is not the way to get there it's actually New Boston so you know what brother Graham said he said we went back to Jeffersonville and started from there and there was somebody in Jeffersonville that knew about New Boston and they could tell us go here you say why didn't God lay that out like he did for the other visions god knows what he's doing to me them visions I preached sermons from their visions of a person's walk with God it shows even in their visions of how to be patient how to wait on God and even in that vision right there it shows that even when a direction had been taken out of Jeffersonville and yet they were headed in the wrong direction where did they go back they went back to Jeffersonville and started from there there are times where you and I have to go back and start from the foundation from the sacred sands think of this Elijah going back to this two mountain horrible now what if Elijah would eat this meal and just took off running somewhere else he ended up in the same and Ben stayed in the same condition he was in because after 40 days the strength was going to wear out you see it's what happens many times to us if we're not careful what God is moving and dealing in the life right there don't just rise up after God has nurtured you and fed you boy pre Scott I feel like going on I don't know go to Horeb if you don't get back to Horeb and get remoted and recast again you're going to end up in the same fix are you with me this is the Lord showing you and I teaching us you can go in that strip you can go a lot of places pray scholar I feel I feel wonderful and be careful if you're not careful in 40 days you'll be in the same fix why do I gotta go use the strength to get the horrible get back to sacred sands get back to a place where God can remote you let me tell you something you can make everything your refuge you can make your job your refuge you can try to drown out your problems you can try to put your head in the sand and pretend like things aren't going on but listen let me tell you something right now it's to receive nourishment within your heart taking in of the Word of God and really being nourished in the things of God and make your way to Mount Horeb to where that God Himself can speak to your heart and remote you once again now you know scholars say it actually is only about 11 or 12 days journey from where Elijah was at to Mount Horeb now some of them scholars save it and lied you're just kind of wandering around I'm not saying that because the Prophet don't say that because what I believe that he's going to Horeb and there's a place he's got to get there - horrible not just anywhere you see this is what it's important to know with what God is doing for you it's important to understand the nourishment he's given you notice and he came thither unto a cave and Lodge there and behold the word of the Lord came to him and said to him what doest thou here Elijah I don't believe for a moment that God was saying what are you doing here God was asking him not so that Elijah would be the one to tell him okay like I didn't realize while you were here know God's asking him to consider think what are you doing here remember the word of the Lord came to him in none of the previous verses the angel touched him he didn't say the word of the Lord came to him the angel just touched him woke him up said rise eat put him back to sleep woke up rise eat the journeys great for you put him back to sight but when he gets to Horeb the word of the Lord comes to him sometimes I've wondered and I think I understand as a pastor sometimes why I have to wait I understand sometimes why that you have to wait that sometimes we need nourished before we can ever ever be properly counseled because we're in no state of mind or demeanor to be counseled but God knows how to nourish strengthen and get you to wake and speak to you at Horeb aren't you glad for that glory be to God he knows how to bring us to that place because first of all he'll I just got to be nourished he's got to be refreshed before he can ever be remoted verse 10 and he said I've been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts for the children of Israel have forsaken that covenant thrown down thine altars and slain by prophets with the sword and I even I only am left don't raise your hands but you've been there maybe you feel that way this morning I'm the only one that's where discouragement will get you now in this way in this way yet it's applied to our lives but yet with Elijah he says and they do seek my life Elijah what he's looking at and look listen what he's talking about is all that he has seen and experienced and yet Elijah is a man gifted by God to be able to see the unseen and isn't it striking how that God will allow you sometimes to see the unseen and then other times you don't see the unseen but what you don't see doesn't mean that something's not happening see God is teaching Elijah a lesson here and through this lesson it's something that can be ministered to you now he's actually trying to minister victory over discouragement the cakes the water all those things that was not the victory over discouragement I hope you're with me this morning you see if mail-id you would have said praise God manna I'm ready to go right now but he really wasn't feeling that way I'll read your statement here in a minute even when he got and left there from the right from the cakes in the water he still wasn't feeling that way at that time but if he would have mistaken that and just taken the cakes and the water and went he'd ended up in the same condition that he was in before but right here is where he actually needs to be remoted and you know God has a way of talking to you and I sometimes God can just come out and say things point-blank but then there's other times God knows how to speak to you and I that will get the point and it's scary we get the point in more and more than more ways than what words could say think about what Elijah has declared here that they have forsaken my covenant thrown down my altars slam the prophets I'm the only one left and they're seeking my life and the Bible says in verse 11 that he the Lord spoke to him and said go forth and stand on the Mount before the Lord and behold the Lord passed by God had a place that he wanted him to stand and the Lord passed by now what God is actually going to do here is reenact the effects of the passing of the Lord in Elijah's ministry he's actually speaking to Elijah so Elijah can understand it and here as the Lord passed by a great strong wind rent the mountains and break in pieces the rocks before the Lord but the Lord was not in the wind are you catching it he was not in the wind the wind had an effect on the rocks and renting the mountain but that was only because the Lord was passing by in Elijah's ministry the Lord passed by and the wind stirred up persecution the wind stirred up all of this tore moil against him but the Lord was not in the wind and after the wind an earthquake but the Lord was not in the earthquake and after the earthquake a fire but the Lord was not in the fire and after the fire a still small voice God has just laid out right here what has taken place in his ministry so far things that have happened you have stood for my word you have stood true to it it has turned Israel upside down they call you a fanatic they call you crank they call you old old old ball head all of these things they don't even want you as a matter of fact the first lady of the land said she's going to have you instead what should have brought liberty and blessing has caused you to run for your life I mean after all you just shared the gospel of Liberty and now they hate you they put you out don't want nothing to do with you they don't seem like that makes sense does it don't worry it didn't make sense for Elijah either don't worry you know if I'm making a statement I've got some things to read to you and it was so when Elijah heard it heard what the still small voice that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entering in of the cave and behold there came a voice unto Him what does thou here Elijah and Elijah repeated the same thing that he had already said before and noticed this within the midst of it here if God this is a wonderful thing he has let he has let God know my zeal and my jealousy for you I am jealous and zealous for the message you have given me but if God don't help him his jealousy and his Selya sness has put him out here if God doesn't help him and realign him remote him recast him he'll remain out there but you see what God is doing God has allowed this time because he is actually teaching Elijah human weakness don't raise your hand nobody likes to have their human weakness exposed if God doesn't help him he's going to stay in seclusion no time goes on to talk about it like this and perfect strength I don't think I have these for you but I can get him to you tomorrow he said he had come to the end of his road then program said he was in pretty bad shape he had come to the end of his knowledge he didn't know what to do next I've done what you've told me to do Lord I stood by your word I've told the truth all of them's gone away there's nobody left here I ain't got anybody to preach to ask your logic if we could we could just if we could ask you Elijah Elijah what Mount Carmel what kind of meeting was ahead that was a flop I mean God came down the Lord really moved in such a way but he didn't see fruit y'all getting quiet on me he didn't see fruit do you realize he did not leave that mountain saying glory to God there's people right here that really believe it no he thinks he's the only one did you see zeal and jealousy for the Lord for the message is good but don't you let it get you off to yourself and so that you're the only one you better make a trip to Mount Horeb and ask God Lord remove me Lord God recast me because obviously the channel in the way that I'm going about it I am isolating myself because I am so jealous and zealous for the message discouraging how is it in your life when you don't see fruit that you think you want to see in your life encouraging or discouraging sometimes the hardest thing within our lives is to see our own growth sometimes it takes years to be able to look back and actually see you've grown because a lot of times but listen don't miss this the real first part where growth takes place is the same way it does when God is dealing with your heart to even bring you to the new birth it takes place on the inside to where you can even catch to where that how that you're even a pro and you're looking at things a whole lot differently than what you used to and then you see growth come out of your life think about this here he is he's so discouraged he's so despondent he's not seeing the people respond the way he thinks they ought to respond hey listen this happens to every officer in the church it happens to you it happens to song leaders and whatever more that's why it's very careful we must always be careful not to handle things out of discouragement the greatest thing I can do for you if I'm discouraged I maybe need to take a break and get somebody in here yeah good man is hard to tell what I'll do when I'm discouraged lord have mercy they won't even listen to me they asked me for advice they had never loosened me on squirming right now I better get somebody in huh I'm gonna say you know what I I'll just go down the brother Erikson for Sunday morning and get refreshed no with me discouragement is a real thing God's gotta help me hide you here he needs help brother Bram says it was then at this point he got weak yet standing true confessing his weakness and everything he's at a point let me die I know better than the rest of her but God said come on up on the mountain I'm gonna give you a new message I'm going to send you a new message now where the RAM said when God got done with him there on Horeb he said here he is he said he looks a mess he said how he's dressed he said an 80 year old man he said but when he came off the mountain that day he said I'd say he act like he was 16 years old you know what it was the cakes the water got him to Horeb and when he got the hole up God was bringing him back to his commission they lied to us now at the place completely human weaknesses exposed he could do no more but that's where God steps he's coming off that mountain refreshed like a 16 year old person think about it when we correctly stand on the word it brings us to the end of us it brings us to the end of us it takes the word coming in our lives to lead us to a complete birth and then after the new birth onto a place of full maturity Elijah wasn't seeing results he couldn't see him he couldn't feel him but it didn't mean the message wasn't having an effect it's not a public show you see God was bringing Elijah to this that you stood from my word my word has had an effect he's got to help him now this is what brother Graham wouldn't mention it just like this to us can I have just a few more moments but LaRon wouldn't mention I like this in perfect strength he said now he said it'll never do us any good it'll never it will never be until every person that professes to be a Christian will forget his own ability and yield his self to God then God can achieve his purpose by sending not a revival brother but what he needs to do first his sin the killing so we can revive he says you've got to die before you can be born again he needs a killing of ourselves this Tabernacle needs are killing and me with it all of us we need a killing so that we can be revived in a new life a new mold a new hope a new experience we need first a day of mourning a place of yielding in the spirit place for both of em says later on down we can get to a place where we can surrender our souls and lives even to the house wife to the farmer to the mechanic whoever we are we got to surrender completely to God and know that we are nothing and then let God start from there he'll starts moving and working and that includes all of us everyone that's the thing we got do God let Abraham his stream of life die up because they live because Abraham he fathered an Ishmael God let his stream of life dry up God is putting him into a condition to where it will take God to move on the scene this is where Elijah's at this is where Elijah is that and this is where when we are dealing with discouragement this is where we are rythm says he goes on and says we need to be cut down and boiled over God have mercy on me God take me and mould me God take me it's all about all about me and there's much that's no good God cut it off as my prayer this morning circumcise my heart and ears my being make me Lord make me something whatever he wants me to be is that your prayer so you see what the real enemy is this discouragement things happen and Elijah can't see what's going on he don't realize and God has to tell him after God causes Elijah in the very next scripture he tells him Elijah okay come on I want you to go verse fifteen return on that way resume to the wilderness of Damascus and when thou comest anoint Hazael to be king over Syria and jehu the son of nimshi shall tell anoint to be king over israel and elisha the son of shaphat Bema shalt thou anoint to be prophet in thy room he comes the past and whom him to escape at the sort of hazy L shall J who slay and embed escape her from the sword of Jehu sound Elijah slay yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel I imagine Elijah's heart dropped when he seen that preview seventh there she comes again marching onward Christian sold seven thousand the message it will produce it is having an effect he didn't feel it was that's what he was discouraged he was so zealous and so sailed but he had to be remoted God didn't need to remove the word he needed to remote hi-jon bring him to a place to where he can minister to him victory over his discouragement that's the same way God does you and I we can either choose to take other refuges we can choose to take other means but remember those means it's just like pills whether it's ten hours five hours 12 hours or 24 hours it'll be again but there is a place when you're discouraged God will refresh you and bring you to Mount Horeb but you've got to go to Mount Horeb you've got to be determined to get to Mount Horeb and then God can help you go and return on your way you might be sending you this morning and you might think right now maybe you're not even you don't even find the juniper-tree right now this morning and I'm telling you God's got a juniper tree for you you didn't sports it is in politics God's got a real juniper tree for you it's the very tree of life himself the Lord Jesus Christ amen it's got it's got branches it's got leaves upon it it's able to refresh you bring you shade protection and what you have mean all you got to do is make it underneath this juniper tree and when you're coming underneath that juniper Theresa and Lord refresh me Oh God maybe your soul is so vexed with sin there's no peace at all but you say if I could just get to that tree if I can get to that place to where I can have that refreshment that strength within my life I can get to Mount Horeb god knows where you're at this morning a lot of things no doubt in your life have been went the way you wanted them to go maybe some things that's happened that's literally blew your world apart but remember he knows all about your need God could have preached on Elijah he could have tore him up one side and down the other that ain't what he needed right here you with me he needs encouragement he needs encouragement no wonder Paul would admonish us his father's father's discouraged not your children unless they be angry there's a certain amount a certain place a certain point we come to so that guidance and leadership can still go forward I'm glad that he knows the balance aren't you I'll tell you this morning no matter what it is that you where you're at let him be your juniper tree and if you've received strength and nourishment maybe you're right now on day 27 of your strength and nourishment just check your compass make sure you're going to Horeb make sure you're going to Horeb make sure you're not just running on strength and then all of a sudden here once again once again let Simon are you saying if I get the Horeb I'll never be discouraged no I'm just saying that'll be one area of your life that you've got victory you might find the juniper tree again but it won't be for that same thing are you with me I believe God's interested in every heart this morning I believe he's interested in you I believe he's interested in me let's pray Lord Jesus Lord my trust is in you Lord this morning that God that you could take such a simple thought Lord things you begin to Lord just just inspiring or through the week but why mine just never Lord saw it coming Ord for these for this service here this morning but you know our needs Lord what I couldn't yesterday I couldn't get away from it Lord they came so great in prayer that I had to set everything else aside and move right into this channel Lord father I thank you I think your Lord you know yesterday I told you thank you because the Lord even and myself as I studied it I cried I cried and in a bit of times the Lord I would I would shout thank you lord I could see myself Lord right here in these scriptures the believers the Lord I'm speaking to this morning they can see themselves right here in these scriptures to know that you are mindful that you don't come by away and say come on get up what are you down about you don't have nothing to be down about you ought to be the happiest people in the world there's times for that there's times for that and I'm so glad that there's a time for everything there's a time to laugh there's a time to cry there's a time for all of these things lord help us within marriages husbands and wives help us Lord to be sensitive one to another helpless as as a family as a church and help us to be sensitive Lord to the needs of one another sometimes the Lord people don't need paragraphs and everything else they already know it what they need is somebody will show a little bit of care before you could ever speak to Elijah right here in the word this is a pattern how many times your prophet would visit this from the earlier parts of his message all the way clear up to the closing messages in 1965 on this juniper tree [Music] my lord you show us just how you minister to Elijah you show us the Lord how to minister you show me as a pastor I thank you for that Lord lord knows I've made many mistakes but how I thank you Lord God for teaching me correcting me and helping me to see this sometimes the Lord where I beat myself up or what I've said god I want to help this person or these individuals Lord how do I get to them but then the Lord when I see this right here I realize oh yeah that's a truth and then Lord God as you took me down through times sometimes the Lord it's been some time pass it isn't me as a man but father you place the gift in my life as a pastor that you'll come down Lord God and you'll take that gift I'm not just a preacher I'm a pastor from my heart my heart for your people specifically for this people right here ort I'm glad Lord that you show us but sometimes people just need nourishment encouragement to rise and eat encouragement to rise then once they get to a place they get to Mount Horeb then the word of the Lord can come or Jesus this meant so much to me but I know this wasn't just for me this morning this was for us saluted it was for us as your children father the needs or God that are throughout this assembly this world I pray that God may each and every one take may we take what you've said here and gain victory over our discouragement will never Lord encouragement that we get from err anything other than the Word of God he will last but the encouragement that we'll get from the word it should lead us to Mount Horeb [Music] where we can be remote in our thinking sometimes Lord it's not the word the word is never the problem it's our thinking our molding your prophet and Lord on the opening quotes I just read he asked you take me with the congregation and remote me remould me Lord Lord here in your presence hearts Lord God that would be honest before you say lord help me lead me Lord God if I need to be remoted or recast the way I'm looking at something to help me Lord if I've developed a complex about something a way of thinking that molding Lord helped me Lord help me God to be remoulded Lord because it's not your word that's the problem your word is right on track but let my seal and my jealousy for you Lord let it be lined with your heart Lord because in the results that I would say oh I don't see any results Elijah left Mount Carmel oh what a mighty visitation you gave him the word what to do there he didn't go on his own account it was my vision he went there he obeyed your word every step of the way and yet Lord he's looking at all of the accusations what people are saying about him he's an outcast all these things that are spoken and then on top of it churches have put him out don't want nothing to do with him that Jezebel's feared that first lady the land she says I'm gonna kill you if I find you he doesn't look like there's any fruit that's come out of it [Music] but all I think how your prophet said it Lord he said what Elijah didn't see is what took place on Mount Carmel that day it gave courage to the 7000 to step out Oh God sometimes things that we can't see sometimes the order we get tunnel vision we need a renewing of our vision we need Lord help to get out of that tunnel vision help us the Lord we don't want that old only even I only I know Lord not there that's a sign right there our cor jealousy we need to get this on the right line the right way help us help us each and every one lord I pray that you Lord God moved for every heart there this morning father hearts and lives that Lord where there's lives that really need to know you in a real deep personal way Lord they need Lord God to really come to the Tree of Life that great juniper tree Lord and experience that real redemption of their soul Lord where it's not a church life it's not belonging to a church because that won't save them Lord they could come to this church faithful and be lost and go to hell because it's not a church that save them it's the precious blood of the Lamb and it takes that blood being applied to their soul that will literally change their nature and their life and Lord to where that it becomes a fire a fire of God on the inside of their life a strength granite Lord may they find refuge in you Lord comfort and rest in you Lloyd help us Lord in the name of Jesus Christ sweep all the my swing let's just stand this worshipping mouths [Music] oh my [Music] a man just let the Holy Spirit water that

in in a real place it's wonderful it doesn't matter what you have what you don't have your ambitions your outlook all your focus is just him Lord nothing else matters but you because you know it's like this you can work and work and work and work for something that you value but just take a walk through Jaime's flea market you'll find things out there that people work for maybe pinch pennies for maybe saved for and now it's out there for sale or you don't even have to go there just wait to bulk trash pickup day you'll find things that people have set and beside the curve that maybe they allowance they they cut back and they said you know we're all they're gonna have maybe so much chicken today and so much this and because we want this sulfur and then you see where it's at its temporal the same are you saying we shouldn't have that's not what I'm saying I'm saying that in all of those things you can do everything and think once I get this once I have this this will send nothing satisfies nothing outside of the Lord Jesus Christ nothing satisfies everything else is like a dangling carrot and it's not God dangling carrots it's the enemy but we're not to follow carrots we're to follow after him next time you're tempted I think I need to go here I think uh how about just saying you know what body flesh you're gonna obey me we're gonna go talk to the Lord because you see there's a control tower on the inside that'll send out signals against the control tower in your body and that control tower sent out so hey hey hey hey hey hey you better be praying hey you better get in the word what's it doing it's sending out a warning against the body and if you'll just go and slip away to start worshipping him you'll find you didn't need that new shirt after all you didn't need to go run your credit card up come on friends we're talking about a real release here in him all these other things that Satan's eaten to try to feed all these other things make this the release and you'll feel better here you'll feel better there pretty soon you'll be donating that one to Goodwill to make the Lord your refuge let him be your all sufficiency let him be the joy of your life that's a real juniper-tree that's a real place where you can rest and say Lord God in you I find my refreshment oh my he's got cakes he's got water they're for you he's got what you need to be
