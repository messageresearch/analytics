[24:36] like to determine with me to
[24:39] Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 1
[25:10] remember now thy crate my Creator in the
[25:13] days of thy youth while the evil days
[25:16] come not nor the years draw nigh when
[25:20] thou shalt say I have no pleasure in
[25:22] them while the Sun or the light or the
[25:26] moon or the Stars be not darkened nor
[25:29] the clouds return after the rain in the
[25:32] day when the keepers of the house shall
[25:34] tremble and the strongmen shall bow
[25:36] themselves and the grinders cease
[25:38] because they are few those that look out
[25:41] of the windows be darkened and the door
[25:43] shall be shut in the streets when the
[25:45] sound of the grinding is low and he
[25:47] shall rise up at the voice of the bird
[25:50] and all the daughters of music shall be
[25:52] brought low also when they shall be
[25:55] afraid of that which is high and fears
[25:57] shall be in the way and the almond tree
[26:00] shall flourish and the grasshopper shall
[26:02] be a burden and desire shall fail
[26:05] because man goeth to his long home and
[26:08] the mourners go about the streets or
[26:10] ever the silver cord be loosed or the
[26:14] golden bowl be broken or the pitcher be
[26:17] broken at the fountain or the wheel
[26:18] broken at the cistern then shall the
[26:21] dust return to the earth as it was and
[26:23] the spirit shall return unto God who

[29:32] you I know he couldn't we couldn't call
[29:37] everyone here this morning as far as
[29:39] calling you by phone and everything but
[29:43] I know that you've heard by now that my
[29:48] beloved brother my dad my mom's husband
[29:56] our dad he's went on to his reward I
[30:05] don't know when he when he stepped on
[30:09] the other side I know he wasn't using a
[30:13] cane I don't believe he was shuffling I
[30:22] know he went shuffling but I'm thankful
[30:30] to God for the life that was lived here
[30:35] among us I turned into this parking lot
[30:41] here today as I'm coming down this road
[30:44] there's so many memories everywhere I
[30:46] look I don't just see my dad I see other
[30:51] brothers it's went on before I see
[30:52] brother al Copa when I turned into this
[30:55] I seen them standing brother Gomez
[30:58] sister Elia brother al my dad standing
[31:00] by that sign when the church was just
[31:03] purchased and what Thanksgiving it was
[31:06] for us to be able to have a place
[31:08] together you know I see I was able to
[31:14] see a little bit behind the scenes and
[31:16] know the dedication the desire that that
[31:20] my dad had in his heart that there would
[31:21] be a place for God's people to worship
[31:24] and you know
[31:28] when I look here in this scripture I
[31:31] just yesterday morning was there with
[31:36] brother and sister keener and we were
[31:38] there ministering in that funeral and
[31:41] that yesterday morning I I noticed that
[31:46] everything changed on me when I got up
[31:48] and got going and I thought why do I
[31:50] have two funeral texts why then when we
[31:59] got over to the hospital and we were
[32:01] sitting there waiting you know
[32:04] immediately I said no I could see the
[32:08] gravity of the situation and my heart
[32:10] I'm saying no no but I look at this
[32:15] scripture in Ecclesiastes 12 and I
[32:18] remember when brother browning my dad
[32:20] when he stood here on a New Year's Eve
[32:22] service and he read that first scripture
[32:24] there and then this is probably 10 years
[32:26] ago and he read that scripture and he
[32:28] says he said you know what the evil days
[32:30] are its old age he said because the
[32:35] things that you have as a year as a
[32:38] young person and not just young as far
[32:40] as in you know in your 20s but even
[32:42] thirties forties so forth you have
[32:43] strengths that can be yielded to the
[32:47] Lord you have a lot of things that
[32:52] you're able to do is you would yield
[32:54] yourself to the Lord and he he made a
[32:56] statement within that and he made a
[32:58] statement that night he says don't wish
[33:01] your life away but he said make it so
[33:05] that every day it's yielded for the Lord
[33:08] that he might have his way you know
[33:11] sometimes we we do we all we do we go
[33:15] through times in our life and we think
[33:17] well I just can't wait till we're done
[33:19] with this an hour then with this project
[33:21] or done but each and every day I I
[33:24] remember that night that stood out to me
[33:26] so much I just took that as a real
[33:28] counsel and so when I would go to start
[33:31] wanting to get through something I'd
[33:34] always think back and I'd hear that
[33:35] coming back to wait a minute enjoy each
[33:38] day look what what can be done for the
[33:42] Lord in that day you come Don down
[33:46] further here in this passage that that
[33:48] we read and you find in the latter parts
[33:50] where everything as far as within the
[33:52] day would seem to go on but yet it says
[33:55] no one no one has the strength to carry
[33:57] on in the things that normally would
[34:00] take place
[34:01] strong men bowing themselves music that
[34:04] should be heard it's just as though it's
[34:07] silenced and then it goes as though a
[34:09] silver cord as as a scripture said that
[34:12] when that silver cord be loosed it's
[34:14] like this on a chandelier where you have
[34:17] something that within this that if it
[34:20] were to fall there's a delicous there's
[34:23] it's delicate even when they're having
[34:24] the crystals around it but yet if that
[34:27] cord or any of those links would give
[34:29] way down it comes but you don't know
[34:33] when that link will give way you don't
[34:36] know when the when the glass will be
[34:39] broken none of us and we realize this
[34:42] have the promise of even the next moment
[34:45] or even tomorrow so it doesn't mean that
[34:49] we live our lives in fear because as we
[34:52] serve the Lord we serve Him because we
[34:55] love Him because He first loved us so
[34:59] our love and devotion is to him our
[35:01] desires to please him and to serve Him
[35:03] to make every moment every every moment
[35:06] every time count for the Lord and I
[35:09] thought you know where my dad so many
[35:13] times I would tease him if you don't
[35:15] mind I want to read this little
[35:17] scripture he some of you know he
[35:19] preached this from the scripture many
[35:22] times and that was out of first Timothy
[35:26] chapter 6 verse 12 he said fight the
[35:30] good fight of faith lay hold on eternal
[35:33] life whereunto thou art also called and
[35:37] has professed a good profession before
[35:39] many witnesses and I would tell Dad I
[35:43] said dad you've preached so many angles
[35:45] and parts out of that
[35:46] I don't know if I could ever minister
[35:48] out of it but yeah I would I would kind
[35:51] of tease him a little bit within it but
[35:53] what I knew is is that within any of our
[35:56] lives it must be by experience whether
[35:59] we're preaching with this voice or
[36:02] whether we're preaching with this voice
[36:03] it must be by experience and that was a
[36:06] life that truly it was by experience
[36:09] that was lived out I saw over the course
[36:12] of the time I looked back over thee well
[36:16] it was actually about an even 10 years
[36:18] ago or so and I just got back from
[36:20] Africa the second time and dad said
[36:23] Sonny said when you go back he said I'd
[36:25] like to go back with you because he's
[36:27] seen when I came back that time I had
[36:28] had a lot of meetings and he wanted to
[36:30] go and help me and dad always had a
[36:32] burden for the missions always had a
[36:35] burden for the missions and yet the last
[36:40] time I think that he went was when he
[36:41] went with you to the Philippines I
[36:43] believe and you know I was usually I was
[36:47] used to my dad being so strong where he
[36:50] planted his whole yard in grass and then
[36:54] got on a flight the next morning and
[36:56] went to Honduras to minister meetings
[36:59] and so for me you know one of the things
[37:01] and I know that some of you you saw it
[37:03] as well I was used to my dad always
[37:06] being so strong where it was just like
[37:09] he didn't wear down he just kept going
[37:11] he just kept going and you know I think
[37:18] back and and pawned that and I look back
[37:20] over the past years and ten years and
[37:22] even the past five years and I saw his
[37:26] steps get slower but yet
[37:37] dad always wanted to be in the house of
[37:41] God you'd like to aid him up last year
[37:44] when July when I had to put him in the
[37:47] car and we took him into the hospital
[37:48] you remember he couldn't come back here
[37:50] to the to church until October he had
[37:52] that whole situation he went through
[37:54] with his foot and how many times that we
[37:57] as a congregation some of you I
[37:59] understand are new and even from even a
[38:02] few years ago but throughout the time of
[38:04] how that God has miraculously moved for
[38:08] brother browning when he couldn't even I
[38:11] was a junior getting ready to become a
[38:13] senior and here he has a stroke I walk
[38:16] into his office that day he can't even
[38:18] talk there's nothing that is audible he
[38:22] can't move his right side at all and you
[38:27] witnessed and I witnessed God completely
[38:31] restore him I never forget when he
[38:36] ministered in Honduras and I was there
[38:39] in 1996 and he spoke the message at thy
[38:43] word Lord I'll let down the net and he
[38:46] was ministering and he came to a place
[38:48] the people had already been praying for
[38:50] him and they knew the condition he put a
[38:53] penny he had in his pocket out here and
[38:55] he put it with his left hand now and he
[38:57] in the midst of ministering he reached
[38:59] and he grabbed it and when he grabbed
[39:01] that and picked that up that whole place
[39:04] erupted it was just such a faith Bank
[39:07] came in there on that on that Friday
[39:08] night service I never forget that in my
[39:11] life it was all things were possible the
[39:16] people seen that they had been praying
[39:18] for it and there's many different things
[39:20] is even here in 1999 18 years ago in
[39:24] February when my dad was going in there
[39:30] was some complications that happened
[39:32] with his heart they had to rush him from
[39:34] Sandusky over to st. Vincent and his his
[39:38] lungs were filling up on the table well
[39:43] you know how when you're setting in a
[39:44] room and we're in a little room and all
[39:46] of a sudden a priest walks into this
[39:47] room
[39:48] I knew that that didn't mean good things
[39:52] but my memoir Browning my mom and myself
[39:56] were there my dad had been ministering
[39:59] on Thursday nights on a subject it is I
[40:03] be not afraid I don't know how many
[40:06] parts he had already spoke on it but we
[40:08] were praying there that night and I
[40:10] remember hearing the words come forth it
[40:15] is I'd be not afraid and you know how
[40:17] you have your brakes on the front of
[40:19] your trousers my mom remembers and on
[40:21] her dress
[40:22] it just Benton the dress and bent the
[40:25] bit my trousers in front right over it
[40:27] came from right here the prints of the
[40:30] Lord just moved right through there
[40:33] that priest sensed it and everything and
[40:35] then they came back all of a sudden here
[40:37] comes a doctor and doctor comes in and
[40:38] says hey it's all reversed it's all
[40:43] reversed and my dad asked me he said son
[40:47] he said where were you at from me I said
[40:50] well dad you remember I said we came in
[40:52] he'd like like towards you like this I
[40:54] said we were down in a little room I
[40:56] said on down that way he said that's the
[40:58] direction he came from he said there was
[41:01] a fog rolling in on me he said but he
[41:04] came to me and said your work is not
[41:06] finished yet you must stay God knows
[41:19] what he's doing Paul says in the
[41:28] scriptures
[41:30] for I'm not ready to be offered in the
[41:33] time of my departure is at hand
[41:39] Paul goes on to say I have I've fought a
[41:43] good fight of faith
[41:46] I finished my course I've kept the faith
[41:51] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[41:53] crown of righteousness which the Lord
[41:55] the righteous judge shall give me at
[41:57] that day and not to me only but unto all
[42:00] them also that love his appearing that
[42:06] very portion of word for I'm now ready
[42:08] to be offered even in that phrase it
[42:12] refers to that of a drink offering
[42:14] that's poured out which is a life that's
[42:18] a given and I I look at it over the
[42:22] times and is here I just had a little
[42:33] moment when I came back from the funeral
[42:36] yesterday my dad was at my house and he
[42:39] was sitting there on the couch I
[42:45] mentioned to him I said we were just
[42:48] talking about some things and he said I
[42:50] want to go down I want to see your
[42:51] basement I want to look around this okay
[42:53] so he came down and he's looking around
[42:56] he began to tell me you need to do this
[42:59] you need to do that so okay dad I said
[43:01] what is this stuff I need this is what
[43:03] you need son okay then I looked at him
[43:06] and I was so struck by different things
[43:08] I said dad I said I want to say this to
[43:09] you I said I want to say thank you for
[43:13] the testimony and the life the gospel
[43:17] that you preached I said the true
[43:19] standard of this message that you held
[43:21] that it wasn't a letter but it's the
[43:24] person of Jesus Christ I said I want to
[43:27] say thank you and I hugged him I didn't
[43:30] know there was the last moments as far
[43:34] as to be able to have that kind of a
[43:36] converse
[43:37] with him but what a consolation that we
[43:41] do have in the midst of our grief in the
[43:44] midst of our sorrow
[43:45] there's many lives that I can look out
[43:47] around through this assembly where God
[43:52] used as the Prophet said God will take
[43:55] the makeup of the messenger of the age
[43:59] to catch the people of the age that st.
[44:03] parallel works even in an assembly to
[44:06] see how that God Himself he here he took
[44:10] an individual that didn't beat around
[44:13] the bush
[44:13] he spoke straight and administered to a
[44:17] lot of people I see different lives
[44:20] around here that it was a life that was
[44:23] yielded to the Lord I I remember him
[44:25] driving from Salina three-and-a-half
[44:27] hours even for a midweek service if
[44:30] there was a need he would take off and
[44:32] go and then sometimes here was you know
[44:36] dad was usually up with me when I'm
[44:38] getting up for school in the morning but
[44:40] that particular morning because he got
[44:42] in real late you rest a little bit
[44:45] longer and then he would finally get it
[44:47] right before I got on the school bus but
[44:49] I what I've seen and what I witnessed
[44:51] and I say this to you what you've seen
[44:54] here is the same thing I've seen it on
[44:57] it was true throughout and that all
[45:03] glory belongs to the Lord you know I
[45:11] thought about it this morning when I
[45:13] finally got home and I thought about how
[45:15] the Prophet said how what he would give
[45:17] to have some more time with his dad I
[45:22] thought about different ones of you
[45:24] that's lost your loved one close loved
[45:28] ones I started going through my mind
[45:30] they had even a greater impact greater
[45:34] impact you know I can't say that I
[45:41] wouldn't want him to come back here
[45:43] because I miss him already but I don't
[45:51] want to be selfish because I know right
[45:54] now he's not suffering he's not asking
[46:00] for strenght and you know where I'm
[46:02] helping him get up out of the chair or
[46:03] anything and I know I have the utmost
[46:09] confidence according to the Word of God
[46:11] that there were already loved ones and
[46:15] saints of God that were gathered there
[46:18] at the river to welcome him home
[46:23] amen what it's a comfort within that the
[46:29] sámi was your heart broken
[46:30] it's broken absolutely for many of us
[46:37] you know especially for many that even
[46:40] had where it was even more even of a
[46:44] closeness
[46:46] gonna be our x i i know from my mother
[46:49] they they were best friends for me i
[46:55] told my boys today and they knew it i
[46:57] said my dad he wasn't just dad he was my
[47:01] buddy he was my buddy and I'm gonna miss
[47:10] him we're gonna miss him but you know by
[47:15] the grace of God soon and very soon we
[47:18] shall see him amen so I just I covered
[47:24] your prayers myself or the Giri a mom
[47:27] family we covered your prayers when
[47:31] everything would be made known with the
[47:34] arrangements for the service we'll get

[47:40] aware of them
[47:41] but I want to say I love each and every
[47:43] one of you I appreciate you in the Lord

[47:49] when I talked with the Deacons right off
[47:50] the bat with everything
[47:53] that I'll be there this morning I said
[47:55] we will be there I said that's the way
[47:57] my dad would have had it and for me
[48:00] there's no other place to come to to see
[48:05] brothers and sisters of like precious
[48:06] faith in the midst of this time and just
[48:10] to be able to draw strength from one
[48:13] another I'm so thankful for the body of
[48:16] Jesus Christ I'm thankful for God's
[48:18] Amazing Grace and thankful for the
[48:22] message that God has sent to us in this
[48:25] hour that we might have a true pathway
[48:30] that is laid out before us a true
[48:33] reality a true face a true hope a
[48:38] blessed assurance I think God for His

[48:51] and every one of you may God richly
[48:54] bless you is my prayer amen
[49:11] [Music]
[49:15] mmm-hmm I'd like to read a passage of
[49:19] scripture from Psalms 90 some 90 was
[49:29] wrote by Moses it was a prayer of Moses
[49:43] Lord thou has been our dwelling place in
[49:47] all generations before the mountains
[49:50] were brought forth or even thou had us
[49:53] formed the earth and the world even from
[49:56] everlasting to everlasting thou art God
[49:59] thou turnest man to destruction and
[50:02] saith return ye children of men for a
[50:05] thousand years in thy sight are but as
[50:08] yesterday when it is past and as a watch
[50:12] in the night thou carry us them away as
[50:16] a flood they are as asleep in the
[50:21] morning they are like grass which
[50:23] groweth up in the morning that flourish
[50:26] and growth up in the evening it is cut
[50:31] down and withereth for we are consumed
[50:34] by that in Europe and by thy wrath are
[50:36] we troubled
[50:37] thou has set our iniquities before the
[50:40] our secret sins in the light of thy
[50:43] countenance for all our days are passed
[50:46] away in thy wrath we spend art years as
[50:49] a tale that is told some years ago when
[50:59] we were in the building over on Gary
[51:03] Avenue my dad got up and read from this
[51:08] scripture and
[51:13] he said I know this sounds like a
[51:15] funeral service but he he took and said
[51:24] that from where it said that our lives
[51:27] are like grass grow with up in the
[51:29] morning and the evening it's is cut down
[51:32] it's withered then he went to the last
[51:35] verse I read to you it said we spend our
[51:39] years as a tale that is told and he said
[51:43] our ears it's like a book and what we do
[51:52] in our life is wrote in that book it's
[51:55] wrote by our life and he said whatever
[52:00] we we do it's in there but by the blood
[52:08] of Jesus Christ God erases the parts of
[52:16] our sin and he said the book starts out
[52:27] when we begin our lives even at birth he
[52:36] says and it goes through the pages of
[52:38] time and then there comes a time when
[52:42] the book is to be closed it's the last
[52:46] testimony that would be in it it has
[52:49] been lived and spoken and the book is
[52:54] closed and once it's closed nothing can
[52:58] be added to it nothing can be tooken
[52:59] away from it any minister dad and was
[53:08] trying to get across the point that
[53:10] people would look at their lives and
[53:13] would take count of their lives and what
[53:16] they were doing and how they were living
[53:18] in and what was going down in their book
[53:23] and knowing that there was gonna come a
[53:28] time when it'd be the last chapter the
[53:32] last paragraph the last sentence the
[53:34] last word and he was it was a message
[53:43] actually of salvation that he preached I
[53:49] remember I never forgot that service and
[53:57] when I moved to Tennessee I was there
[54:02] only a few months someone passed away
[54:06] and I had to preach the first funeral
[54:07] service I'd ever preached in my life and
[54:09] I used this text from what I'd heard my
[54:14] dad preached this work started in
[54:20] September of 1982 I was there
[54:27] the very first discussion that was made
[54:30] to have a service a meeting I was there
[54:35] when we decided that we would rent a
[54:40] room into why I was only 19 years old
[54:48] and I saw my dad stand against great
[54:52] adversity and he stood for truth even
[54:58] when it seemed like that there were so
[55:01] many that wouldn't stand with him but he
[55:07] held on and I believe it was
[55:14] his life his testimony his book this
[55:24] book to a lot of you brought you here I
[55:39] thought about what I spoke a week ago
[55:45] about brother Branham when he went
[55:47] beyond the curtain of time and he there
[55:50] was a many of them come saying my
[55:52] precious brother and there was one young
[55:57] woman in the angel said you know who
[55:59] that is said you let her to the Lord
[56:01] when she was 19 years old and I thought
[56:05] there are some did my dad led to the
[56:09] Lord this went on and they'll be there
[56:12] to meet him one of them people was his
[56:19] his very own dad and his mom he led them
[56:30] both to the Lord and I know they were
[56:34] there degree he said to me this week he
[56:43] said when the resurrection takes place
[56:46] he said it's like brother Branham said
[56:50] it's not a million miles away said we'll
[56:55] speed up and they'll slow down and he
[56:58] said him will will have a time here
[57:01] together but we won't be seen by the
[57:05] world I thought of a sister strange at a
[57:11] time
[57:12] somewhat that he was talking to me about
[57:15] they had just seemed to come up I hadn't
[57:27] been able to come up here for some time
[57:28] because of things that was involved with
[57:31] my family and I couldn't get away but
[57:37] when those things were resolved and I
[57:39] was free my family was free we begin to
[57:44] make plans while my wife and I had to
[57:46] come up to visit our families our folks
[57:51] and we had originally planned to come up
[57:56] earlier but I felt I needed a little
[58:04] more time because I wanted to make sure
[58:09] I had a good amount of money for the
[58:12] trip
[58:16] but I see now it was hauling God's hands
[58:20] and I'm thankful that he allowed me to
[58:22] spend this last week with my dad
[58:30] I'm thankful that I was there with my
[58:33] mom and my brother seems like there's
[58:37] been so many times that I wasn't able to
[58:39] be there because of living so far away
[58:44] but God was gracious to me this time
[58:50] [Applause]
[59:03] let's live our lives as a tell is told
[59:11] knowing that our life and our testimony
[59:16] lives on after we're gone and knowing
[59:21] that maybe many of us have loved ones
[59:25] and friends that are there waiting and
[59:27] we're looking forward to see them again
[59:31] and I believe I believe it's getting
[59:35] really close I believe it's very close
[59:39] my brothers and sisters I don't believe
[59:42] we got too much more time to wait and
[59:46] I'm looking forward to it I love you
[59:54] and I appreciate your love that you've
[59:57] had for my family and the respect that
[1:00:00] you had for my dad I want to thank you
[1:00:11] for your faithfulness

[1:00:22] of prayers

[1:00:39] words of eternal life Lord your prophet
