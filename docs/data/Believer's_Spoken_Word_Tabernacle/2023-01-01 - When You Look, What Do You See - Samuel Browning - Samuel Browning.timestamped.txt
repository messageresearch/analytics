[36:57] lot of things that through
[36:59] Our Lives individually and church and on
[37:02] and on there's a lot of things that
[37:04] transpire but you know what nothing took
[37:06] God by surprise
[37:09] through every test or every trial
[37:11] through everything God is faithful
[37:13] and we're standing here

[38:23] because even over um I don't want to
[38:25] take too much time but it's very
[38:26] interesting some of you probably looked
[38:28] at these things but the uh you know even
[38:30] when they look at it and they'll let you
[38:33] know
[38:34] it's necessary for sickness for your
[38:37] body to build immunity
[38:38] and you know that time and you've seen a
[38:40] lot even with children things like that
[38:42] where everything was so closed off and
[38:43] closed up and it was just like things
[38:45] came and knocked people off their feet
[38:47] that normally would not have knocked us
[38:50] off our feet but it's just it's
[38:52] something and you know when you look at
[38:54] that and even in the spiritual realm
[38:55] that's why there's things that comes
[38:57] around our way but you know what it does
[38:58] every test and every trial we don't come
[39:01] weaker through every test and every
[39:03] trial he put strength in US
[39:06] we grow stronger and stronger amen amen
[39:11] now we don't maybe feel stronger but
[39:13] what the strength is is him in US

[40:14] that you're so mindful to take account
[40:16] of each need Lord and to come in such a
[40:20] personal way that Lord that's beyond my
[40:23] mind of understanding Lord I I can't
[40:25] understand how that Lord you come into a
[40:28] congregation Lord and no matter what the
[40:31] size is but you'll come Lord and you'll
[40:33] speak so personally to every heart

[41:09] asking God for that anointing of the
[41:12] Holy Spirit to fall afresh upon us the
[41:15] Lord and Lord God may we be lifted Lord
[41:18] out of this since-bound realm Lord God
[41:22] for we have need of you Lord it was

[41:32] was needed to go down their lord into
[41:35] Egypt and to withstand all the tides
[41:38] Lord of doubt and accusation and
[41:41] everything that would try to flood but
[41:44] God what he found there Lord it carried
[41:47] him through and it was you that led your
[41:50] people out so this morning Lord may you
[41:53] just come in a personal way Lord God and

[42:18] myself Lord and and just look to you oh

[42:33] glory of God we ask it Lord in the name
[42:36] of Jesus Christ amen

[44:50] make a way for that because it's nearing
[44:52] that those that time in that moment and

[45:25] just to keep that in prayer amen may God

[45:30] Luke chapter 2 verse 7.
[45:33] and rather than I've had you standing
[45:36] here for a moment so if you don't mind
[45:37] let me just read a scripture then we'll
[45:39] allow you to have your seats as I
[45:41] continue to read in Luke chapter 2 verse
[45:44] 7 and she brought forth her firstborn
[45:47] son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[45:51] and laid him in a Manger because there
[45:54] was no room for them in the End Amen may
[45:58] the Lord bless the reading of the word
[46:00] as you're being seated
[46:01] if you wouldn't mind I'd like to
[46:03] continue to read here
[46:04] in the scriptures
[46:06] amen
[46:08] in verse just continuing right there in
[46:11] verse 8.
[46:13] and there and there were in the same
[46:15] country shepherds abiding in the field
[46:18] keeping watch over the flock by night I
[46:22] want you just to remind remember I I
[46:25] um last week as we started into the
[46:28] thought guided to the word made flesh
[46:30] I'm not going to background on that but
[46:32] it was dealing with
[46:34] and the wise men and we brought it we
[46:36] got it to a certain place of what we
[46:38] were speaking to of coming to being led
[46:41] to that of the word made flesh and so
[46:45] here we pick up with the Shepherds and
[46:46] we realize these are two two separate
[46:49] um uh accounts the Shepherds were there
[46:52] at the birth but the wise men did not
[46:54] come until two years later
[46:57] but we're still we're focused on the
[47:00] same glorious event that has that has
[47:03] taken place so let's in verse 8 there
[47:05] were in the the same country
[47:07] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[47:09] watch over their flock by night and lo
[47:12] the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and
[47:15] the glory of the Lord Shone round about
[47:17] them and they were sore afraid and the
[47:20] angel said unto them fear not for behold
[47:24] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[47:27] which shall be to all people
[47:30] For unto you is Born This Day in the
[47:33] city of David a savior which is Christ
[47:36] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[47:39] you you shall find the Babe wrapped in
[47:42] swaddling clothes lying in a manger and
[47:45] suddenly there was with the angel a
[47:48] multitude of the Heavenly Host praising
[47:51] God and saying glory to God in the
[47:53] highest and on Earth peace Good Will
[47:57] toward men
[47:59] and verse 15 and it came to pass as the
[48:03] Angels were gone away from them into
[48:05] heaven this is I wanted just to hone in
[48:07] on this right here as the Angels were
[48:09] gone away from them into heaven the
[48:11] shepherd said one to another let us now
[48:15] go even unto Bethlehem
[48:17] and see this thing which has come to
[48:20] pass which the Lord hath made known unto
[48:23] us
[48:24] so this message has been declared
[48:29] and they are responding to it and say
[48:31] what we've heard let us go see it
[48:36] and once you remember
[48:38] even
[48:40] when the event of the disciples let me
[48:42] just let me just Traverse a little bit
[48:44] forward here when the disciples were
[48:47] standing there
[48:49] and the Lord Jesus after his
[48:51] resurrection and he's taken up and he
[48:53] ascends up after after being there with
[48:56] them for 40 days upon the Earth and
[48:59] walking around after his resurrection
[49:01] remember he he ascends and they're
[49:04] standing there I mean you know they're
[49:06] already it's been Supernatural event
[49:08] after Supernatural event after
[49:10] Supernatural event on and on through the
[49:13] 40 days but you know here you're saying
[49:15] here is one you're beholding this and
[49:19] you're just seeing here he is is Raising
[49:22] and he's rising up and he's ascending
[49:24] and remember as they're standing there
[49:27] beholding that the Angels spoke to them
[49:30] and said why are you standing here
[49:33] gazing
[49:36] I mean they were looking at a tremendous
[49:39] event but remember when he Ascend when
[49:43] he's ascending now it's time for the
[49:47] Holy Spirit to be poured out
[49:49] right so now the angels that remind them
[49:53] hey you need to stop just looking at it
[49:56] you need to go become one with it
[49:59] so there's a there's a part when we see
[50:02] this that the Shepherds they heard it
[50:04] but now it was called they were drawn to
[50:07] the place or they moved to say Let's go
[50:10] see what the Lord hath made known unto
[50:12] us I think that's a great way to
[50:15] approach everything is Lord what you've
[50:17] spoke to me I want to see it
[50:19] I want to see it in my life
[50:22] I want to see that word come to pass in
[50:25] my life
[50:27] and the Bible said they came with haste
[50:29] and they found Mary and Joseph and the
[50:32] Babe lying in a manger and when they had
[50:34] seen it they made known the saying
[50:37] abroad and said what was told them
[50:39] concerning this child and all they that
[50:42] heard it wandered at those things which
[50:44] were told them by the Shepherds but Mary
[50:46] kept all these things and she pondered
[50:49] them in her heart and the Shepherds
[50:51] returned glorifying and praising God for
[50:54] all the things that they had heard and
[50:56] seen as it was told unto them
[50:59] I want you to think of this
[51:01] in this moment of where that you and I
[51:04] are standing even in this moment because
[51:08] I want you to think that how that we can
[51:11] look
[51:12] at the Bible we can look at the
[51:14] scriptures and we recognize that the
[51:18] Bible it's not just a book of History
[51:22] but it's a book of Prophecy
[51:24] it's where that when we read the
[51:26] scriptures we're not reading about
[51:29] events that have taken place in the past
[51:33] where there's no connection to it
[51:35] whatsoever
[51:36] but it we are reading the Bible and not
[51:40] just reading we're seeing the Bible
[51:43] because the spirit of God the author
[51:46] that moved through the lives of these
[51:48] individuals that moved upon the prophets
[51:51] to write all the same God is the same
[51:54] God who comes and he pours himself into
[51:58] his word and makes it alive to where
[52:01] that you and I are not looking at it as
[52:04] history we recognize it is prophecy of
[52:08] Our Lives because there's one goal that
[52:12] God has had through the entire
[52:13] scriptures
[52:15] and the spirit of Truth the holy spirit
[52:18] that has come to think of how that God
[52:21] would would promise that he would
[52:24] deliver the spirit of Truth to lead and
[52:27] guide us into all truth and as I shared
[52:30] this with you this little bit of where
[52:32] we're going uh from some weeks ago and
[52:35] standing here on a Sunday right after
[52:37] the service and it's just the holy
[52:38] spirit's so stirring in my hearts my
[52:41] heart after that service of the precious
[52:44] and and blessed reality that God has
[52:48] given that we might be able to be led to
[52:53] the place of a real true birth
[52:57] to where we can have a real Assurance in
[53:01] God where we can have a no-so where we
[53:06] can have that of a of a real full
[53:09] reality and I I just don't take that for
[53:12] granted because all around there's a
[53:14] there's so much confusion and if not for
[53:17] the spirit of Truth you and I would be
[53:21] in that same confusion
[53:23] it is the grace of almighty God in this
[53:27] hour of where we're standing it's just
[53:29] like for the wise men they were guided
[53:31] where they were guided because of the
[53:34] Heavenly sign and it drew upon them it
[53:37] didn't draw upon every every Magi it
[53:40] didn't draw upon everyone as a matter of
[53:42] fact not everybody saw it
[53:45] they saw it because they were ordained
[53:47] to see it
[53:48] they couldn't help but see it
[53:51] and it moved them it caused them to
[53:53] forsake and lay aside and even put their
[53:56] lives at risk because it was something
[53:58] that meant more to them that sign and
[54:02] look they weren't just something
[54:03] following blindly they recognized when
[54:06] they saw it they seen it this is what
[54:09] was prophesied in the word and I'm
[54:12] seeing it identified
[54:14] this was a star should arise out of
[54:17] Jacob and they followed that there was
[54:19] there was an assurance in their lives
[54:22] and it was guiding them to the word made
[54:25] flesh
[54:27] and I want to say it like this Paul over
[54:30] and over here Paul is given the
[54:33] commission to come among the Gentiles to
[54:36] take this light that the hold of Satan
[54:40] and darkness that is upon the Gentiles
[54:43] would be driven back would be broken by
[54:46] the Light Of God as God would come and
[54:49] make known and declare the mystery that
[54:52] he had hidden himself from the beginning
[54:56] of before the world ever began and
[54:59] remember how Paul Paul will speak of
[55:01] this in the book of Ephesians as the
[55:03] mystery of God and you'll speak of this
[55:06] mystery that's been committed to me and
[55:09] the whole mystery is Paul brings it all
[55:12] the way down in Colossians chapter 1
[55:15] that this mystery that Paul is speaking
[55:17] of it's God letting you and I know the
[55:21] full purpose and the full counsel what
[55:24] everything has spoken about is God God's
[55:27] desire to dwell in man once again
[55:33] that's what it's all been about is that
[55:36] God would come down and God would
[55:39] Tabernacle deity would once again be
[55:42] failed in flesh
[55:44] Hallelujah
[55:46] and so God supplied his grace his grace
[55:50] supplied the leadership to the word made
[55:55] flesh and when I say the word made flesh
[55:59] I'm not just speaking of just looking at
[56:02] the word made flesh in Jesus Christ or
[56:05] the word made flesh through the prophet
[56:07] or the word made flesh through your
[56:09] mother or the word may flesh through
[56:12] your father or the word may flesh
[56:13] through your pastor I'm saying the word
[56:16] made flesh in you that's what we've been
[56:19] guided to
[56:25] so when we think of that you know the
[56:29] way it's not an easy way
[56:31] the way to the word may flesh in our
[56:33] life
[56:34] I'm a witness of that it's a journeying
[56:37] because you know why you got to let go
[56:39] of your own ideas
[56:41] we've had to die to ourself
[56:44] you see nothing else could bring about a
[56:47] death except the Water of Life
[56:50] the water that raises up that seed on
[56:53] the inside is the same water that causes
[56:56] rot to our ideas it rots it eats away
[57:00] and our thoughts our ideas it eats away
[57:03] at that old first nature nothing else
[57:06] could bring that rot But the Water of
[57:09] Life
[57:10] because every other water would a
[57:13] cistern water would tell you it's all
[57:15] right
[57:16] you're good
[57:17] but we needed the Water of Life that
[57:19] would actually begin to just tear down
[57:22] and take away everything of of this
[57:25] because really that first nature that's
[57:28] the hindrance that's the Trap that is
[57:32] the prison house that is the garbage
[57:35] dump that is the rubbish Heap that is
[57:38] the past house and that's why we need
[57:40] and have needed God's grace to come to
[57:43] you and I to Lift Us in a real true
[57:46] birth
[57:47] that's why I'm brother random let me
[57:49] just read this to you as I as I begin to
[57:51] just set the stage here he says it is
[57:54] your life and his life they find one
[57:57] another not at a church not at a
[58:00] building not at a Creed not in good
[58:02] works notice his life and your life
[58:06] right his life in your life
[58:10] but where we find is in the cross where
[58:13] we are crucified with him that's where
[58:15] you find Christ you don't find him by
[58:18] doing better
[58:19] turning a new page starting a new life
[58:22] you don't find Christ you find Christ
[58:25] only in death not in a Manger not in a
[58:30] confession but to be nor to believe in
[58:33] certain Creeds and fables you don't find
[58:35] Christ there but to think a true servant
[58:38] is one that is going to take you to him
[58:41] and he's the word
[58:43] a person could say Christ is on Earth
[58:46] today but a real servant will take you
[58:49] to him because he's here in the form of
[58:53] his word and it is the word that brings
[58:56] life because he is the word and a true
[59:00] servant will take you there is the
[59:02] pathway easy it's not an easy way it's
[59:05] not and it's not the way that is the
[59:07] choice of the world it is a harder way
[59:11] it's a choice that must be made in every
[59:15] individual has to make that choice
[59:17] there's decisions that we're making even
[59:19] here this morning and a real true
[59:22] servant anointed by the spirit of God
[59:24] leads or directs or takes us and points
[59:28] us to that place of where the word is
[59:30] made flesh
[59:31] he is the word he's the Bible made
[59:34] living and when you die to yourself with
[59:37] Christ like a corner wheat then the word
[59:40] lives in you and it brings forth the
[59:43] same results as it did in that living
[59:45] corn of wheat that had to drop into the
[59:48] Earth
[59:49] I want you to think of the scripture
[59:51] here
[59:52] in Isaiah 7 14.
[59:55] I just I'd love to read all the
[59:57] scriptures that surround it
[1:00:00] because there's a battle going on a war
[1:00:02] but this is God's answer
[1:00:04] verse 14 therefore the Lord himself
[1:00:07] shall give you a sign
[1:00:09] Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[1:00:13] a son and shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:00:18] which is God With Us
[1:00:20] or with us is God what a what a sign
[1:00:25] that God would give now think about
[1:00:27] there's been many signs
[1:00:29] that when we think because this prophecy
[1:00:32] has was spoken concerning of the coming
[1:00:35] of the Messiah
[1:00:37] and there's been many many many signs
[1:00:40] that men remember man is is looks for
[1:00:44] signs and there's been many signs that
[1:00:48] have been placed out there that Proclaim
[1:00:50] safety uh we've seen it you know from uh
[1:00:53] you know well maybe not not many of us
[1:00:55] we've not seen the whole thing with the
[1:00:58] Titanic but we've heard it and we've
[1:00:59] heard things where things have well this
[1:01:02] is going to be the newest and best thing
[1:01:03] and this is going to be and and
[1:01:05] everything itself it fails and think of
[1:01:07] even with the Titanic when they said
[1:01:09] this is a ship that even God can't sing
[1:01:13] just like the Tower of Babel they were
[1:01:16] making a Tower of Babel everything
[1:01:17] notice when they made that statement
[1:01:19] regarding the Titanic yet they were
[1:01:21] tempting God but they were proclaiming
[1:01:23] it was a place of safety but God showed
[1:01:26] them there is no place of safety there
[1:01:28] is no works of man that is a place of
[1:01:32] safety
[1:01:34] there's only one provided place of
[1:01:36] safety and to think all the signs all
[1:01:39] the achievements that's ever been done
[1:01:41] because we're reading about the sign
[1:01:43] that God had given and God said I'm
[1:01:45] going to give you an eternal sign a
[1:01:49] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[1:01:51] shall call his name Emmanuel I want you
[1:01:54] to think of that question why was it a
[1:01:56] baby
[1:01:58] and that's a simple question
[1:02:00] but it's a very it's a very important
[1:02:02] question why was it that it had to
[1:02:05] become a baby had to become so simple
[1:02:07] that God said I will give you a sign and
[1:02:11] it's going to be a super sign now think
[1:02:13] of it this was this is God's super sign
[1:02:17] and the world would laugh at it
[1:02:22] a Super Saiyan the devil would laugh at
[1:02:25] it a super sign
[1:02:27] but yet this God is is coming down where
[1:02:31] he's going to live with his people in a
[1:02:34] super sign and you know this sign right
[1:02:36] here it would not just be a sign for
[1:02:39] that day but it would be a sign for
[1:02:41] every day it would be a sign for the day
[1:02:44] that you and I are living in right now
[1:02:48] now think of it in this way I want you
[1:02:51] to understand this he is the way
[1:02:55] but Samuel that's simple I know that but
[1:02:57] he is the way
[1:03:00] God never entrusted the way to nobody
[1:03:04] else
[1:03:05] when the fall came in Eden God never
[1:03:07] sent nobody else
[1:03:09] he came himself
[1:03:13] he came down to see he knew what had
[1:03:16] taken place but God came down
[1:03:20] to come to come and to move on the
[1:03:23] behalf of man now I want you to think of
[1:03:25] this he is the way God has given many
[1:03:29] signs you know how precious it is that
[1:03:32] God would give a sign even when it looks
[1:03:35] like through that of Noah God would give
[1:03:37] a sign through Noah and it would be a
[1:03:40] sign that when God would prepare and
[1:03:42] have an art prepared for safety for
[1:03:45] those who were wanting and Desiring to
[1:03:48] escape judgment
[1:03:50] that message that God would send that
[1:03:53] sign if it would be a sign of judgment
[1:03:55] for all who wanted to reject the word
[1:03:58] but it would be a sign of Mercy for all
[1:04:01] that would say that would heed to that
[1:04:04] word and enter into that place of safety
[1:04:07] think about this when it would come to
[1:04:09] the burning bush think of how that they
[1:04:12] would stand there at the burning bush
[1:04:13] sure Moses met God there God dealing
[1:04:17] with Moses but think about what God was
[1:04:19] saying in a sign there was a sign that
[1:04:22] was being given and God was letting the
[1:04:24] people know in that hour that I am a
[1:04:27] covenant keeping God I have remembered
[1:04:31] my word
[1:04:33] what a confidence because that sign
[1:04:36] itself has never ceased every time God
[1:04:39] comes on the scene it is God letting you
[1:04:42] and I know I have not forgot about my
[1:04:46] promise
[1:04:47] what I've said I'm here to fulfill that
[1:04:50] it didn't matter how much bondage they
[1:04:52] were in it didn't matter how dark it
[1:04:54] looked it didn't matter how Bleak it was
[1:04:56] God let him know I'm a covenant-keeping
[1:04:58] God and I've come down to deliver
[1:05:02] it's a sign of delivering sign that was
[1:05:06] taking place there at the burning bush
[1:05:08] think of how when God would come down
[1:05:11] think of how it you know brother Brandon
[1:05:14] would play it so plain like this he said
[1:05:16] think of how God when he created heavens
[1:05:18] and earth he spoke to the angels around
[1:05:20] and said let us he said but when God
[1:05:22] came down in the Plan of Redemption God
[1:05:25] came all by himself
[1:05:29] all by himself he came in the Plan of
[1:05:32] Redemption and to think of how through
[1:05:35] the Red Sea let's look at that for a
[1:05:36] moment I I tell you when I think of this
[1:05:39] brother random would say it like this if
[1:05:40] I just want to read this he said this
[1:05:42] sign at the Red Sea God showed that he
[1:05:46] would make a way for those who were
[1:05:48] trying to do right and follow his
[1:05:51] commandment oh my that's shouting
[1:05:53] grounds right there
[1:05:54] that was a sign that God said I will
[1:05:57] make a way for those who are trying to
[1:05:59] do right and desire to follow my word no
[1:06:03] matter what cuts it off God proved that
[1:06:05] the Red Sea and gave a sign that he
[1:06:07] could open the Red Sea in every
[1:06:10] Temptation he'll make a way of Escape
[1:06:12] mother don't believe it Daddy don't
[1:06:15] believe it the church don't believe it I
[1:06:17] don't care who don't believe it if you
[1:06:19] believe it God Will Make A Way of Escape
[1:06:21] he gave a sign that he word they were on
[1:06:25] their way straight to the promised land
[1:06:27] where God promised them and the Red Sea
[1:06:30] shut them off and they got in trouble
[1:06:32] remember what the people wanted to do
[1:06:34] they wanted to go back
[1:06:37] oh man the Way's too hard look you
[1:06:39] brought us out here to kill us but Moses
[1:06:41] didn't bring you out God brought you out
[1:06:43] [Applause]
[1:06:45] amen Moses his life the word made flesh
[1:06:48] there was a sign of what God was leading
[1:06:51] you to the same victory that Moses had
[1:06:54] that pulsated in his life that when
[1:06:57] discouragement Rose in the house
[1:06:59] discouragement Rose in the church
[1:07:01] discouragement Rose all around he had a
[1:07:04] victory a fire that the devil couldn't
[1:07:06] put out
[1:07:09] there was a victory in his life
[1:07:14] Glory
[1:07:15] when the Red Sea shut him off and they
[1:07:18] got in trouble they didn't know what to
[1:07:19] do
[1:07:20] God showed that he'd make a way of
[1:07:22] Escape in every Temptation in every
[1:07:25] trial
[1:07:27] you can't quit smoking take God one time
[1:07:31] you can't quit lying can't quit stealing
[1:07:34] can't quit having a temper you can add
[1:07:35] you can just add on in there take god
[1:07:38] with you one time if you don't feel like
[1:07:40] going to church and you can't get
[1:07:42] anywhere take god with you one time take
[1:07:45] his promise he proved at the Red Sea
[1:07:47] he'll make a way of Escape God has many
[1:07:50] signs
[1:07:54] now when we read about
[1:07:57] the birth
[1:07:59] of the Lord Jesus
[1:08:02] remember
[1:08:03] it was in the time right close to the
[1:08:06] birth
[1:08:08] when a persecution arose
[1:08:11] hear the baby was here it was at the
[1:08:14] time to be delivered
[1:08:16] the pressure the persecution all that
[1:08:19] was rising at that time the taxation you
[1:08:22] must go back to your place of nativity
[1:08:24] and they had to get back there
[1:08:27] it had to be in Bethlehem God knew that
[1:08:31] everything was arranged it wasn't
[1:08:33] happening
[1:08:35] maybe with all the ways that they
[1:08:38] thought and it's just you and I can
[1:08:39] relate to that there's things that has
[1:08:42] happened that we did not look at or
[1:08:45] expect for it to happen this way and
[1:08:47] that's the same way with the Rapture
[1:08:49] we're expecting the Rapture is that
[1:08:51] right and I'm sure that God in every
[1:08:54] little place and every Junction of time
[1:08:56] there are going to be things we do not
[1:08:58] know about but oh if we can just be in
[1:09:01] step with him we're ready when that next
[1:09:04] step comes
[1:09:06] but here they were a pressure arose a
[1:09:09] persecution arose and there's spread
[1:09:12] there's things that in the midst of the
[1:09:14] time that when that is being formed in
[1:09:16] your life think about this in your in in
[1:09:19] your own life to where when you are
[1:09:22] dying and you're coming to life there's
[1:09:24] a pressure they'll have things where
[1:09:26] friends will turn against you and family
[1:09:28] and everything else will come against
[1:09:30] you and Satan will do all he can what's
[1:09:32] he trying to do stifle that life from
[1:09:36] coming to a full birth
[1:09:39] he would like to hinder the prophecy of
[1:09:42] the word
[1:09:43] that's why Paul could say I travail in
[1:09:46] Christ together until now until Christ
[1:09:50] be formed in you Paul was identifying
[1:09:54] there there is a work within the Life
[1:09:57] coming to a full birth which is the word
[1:10:00] made flesh and Paul said I'm laboring
[1:10:02] under that leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:10:05] that's pointing you leading you
[1:10:08] directing you to a real victory in your
[1:10:11] life that's encouraging you when
[1:10:13] Associates and everything else around
[1:10:16] says this is too much right now I got to
[1:10:19] get this taken care of and I'll never be
[1:10:21] able to get Beyond this and now no keep
[1:10:23] pressing that's the moment to press
[1:10:26] that's not the moment to pull back
[1:10:28] that's the moment to press
[1:10:32] Hallelujah it's not the moment to pull
[1:10:35] back away from the word it's a time to
[1:10:37] press on it's a time to press here it's
[1:10:40] a time to go beyond our own feelings
[1:10:46] we're in the hour of the press
[1:10:50] the Press is on
[1:10:53] we're in the hour of the press to press
[1:10:55] on to Perfection everything that you and
[1:10:58] I receive from God in our life will not
[1:11:01] be given out on a silver spoon
[1:11:05] that everything we get from God
[1:11:07] every promise it's going to be a battle
[1:11:11] we're not wrestling against God our
[1:11:13] battle is with our own selves
[1:11:15] and allowing the enemy to come and to
[1:11:17] hinder and move upon the flesh move upon
[1:11:20] the spirit move upon the mind but
[1:11:21] everything we get that is worth getting
[1:11:23] it will require a press in this hour
[1:11:27] it's easy to live a lukewarm life the
[1:11:29] rest of the world is living a lukewarm
[1:11:32] life but it takes a press in this hour
[1:11:35] to stay on fire for God
[1:11:38] brother Sammy I got fire in my soul but
[1:11:41] you got to keep that fire Kendall
[1:11:44] you've got to press against everything
[1:11:46] that wants to try to stifle that you've
[1:11:49] got to press against it
[1:11:56] think about how God
[1:11:59] think about this I just love it
[1:12:02] God could have fully Could Have Become
[1:12:04] a fully matured man
[1:12:06] but he didn't
[1:12:09] God came down
[1:12:11] and they gave a sign
[1:12:13] and that sign that God
[1:12:15] he became a baby
[1:12:17] I want you to notice where these where
[1:12:19] the Shepherds were directed
[1:12:21] they were directed by the message you'll
[1:12:24] find him
[1:12:25] in the stable
[1:12:28] that's where you'll find him
[1:12:30] so they were going to have to Journey
[1:12:32] from where they were on the hillside
[1:12:35] to go to where the word had told them to
[1:12:37] go
[1:12:38] if they were hearing the word and would
[1:12:41] have never moved they'd have never saw
[1:12:45] the word that they had heard made flesh
[1:12:49] now I want to just I know probably the
[1:12:52] title's up there but I want to just re
[1:12:54] remind you just this this is the thought
[1:12:56] it's on my heart when you look
[1:12:59] what do you see
[1:13:02] when you look what do you see
[1:13:04] when we look in upon this word what do
[1:13:07] you see
[1:13:09] you see because the world
[1:13:12] you know from
[1:13:13] these past weeks and on and on and uh I
[1:13:17] I don't have nothing against going to
[1:13:18] Israel I'd like to go someday myself but
[1:13:20] you know I it's not not necessary but
[1:13:23] I'd like to do it
[1:13:24] but you know how many would you know
[1:13:27] wanting to go and or if we can just go
[1:13:29] to Behold a Manger
[1:13:31] if we can just go to behold that
[1:13:33] that's not where he's at
[1:13:36] that's not where he's at that was only a
[1:13:38] sign of what he wanted to do in you
[1:13:44] where will I find him
[1:13:46] notice the word would come where we
[1:13:49] would find him we will find him wrapped
[1:13:50] in a swaddling cloth and we'll find him
[1:13:53] there in a Manger think of how that God
[1:13:56] borrowed the womb of a woman
[1:14:01] God came down himself God supplied both
[1:14:05] sperm and egg and God brought forth a
[1:14:09] tabernacle his own dwelling his own
[1:14:12] Tabernacle God that that creation which
[1:14:15] was a creation of God and God would
[1:14:19] bring that forth and God would step down
[1:14:21] God would borrow the womb of a woman the
[1:14:24] very God of Glory would come down and
[1:14:28] become one of us and God would be veiled
[1:14:31] in his creation
[1:14:34] and in that creation
[1:14:36] here it would reveal God's glory would
[1:14:39] be revealed as Emmanuel think about it
[1:14:42] he who is the creator of heavens and
[1:14:45] earth he and whom the earth and the
[1:14:49] fullness thereof belongs to him he who
[1:14:52] is beyond all riches he who it speaks
[1:14:56] his riches are unsearchable he who it is
[1:14:59] that brought forth everything that was
[1:15:02] needed in this earth he's the one who
[1:15:04] put it here whether it be the oil the
[1:15:06] gold on and on he put it here but he who
[1:15:09] was The Riches of them all he became
[1:15:12] poor he came down for you and me
[1:15:16] and the way that he chose to do it he
[1:15:19] didn't choose to come as a fully matured
[1:15:21] man God had appeared and come down in
[1:15:25] flesh many times and there had been
[1:15:27] visitations and we could go on through
[1:15:28] that in the Old Testament but the
[1:15:30] difference was it was not in the
[1:15:32] Fulfillment of the prophecy that God's
[1:15:36] told the woman I will give thee a seed
[1:15:38] and thy seed shall bruise the head of
[1:15:42] the serpent
[1:15:44] but God had to borrow in order to
[1:15:47] display his riches
[1:15:50] God became one of us
[1:15:53] I want you to think of this how brother
[1:15:55] Brandon would place this here I I just I
[1:15:57] find this very striking
[1:15:59] he says how God he said I think when God
[1:16:02] With Heaven in his mind
[1:16:04] of what would be appealing to the human
[1:16:06] being appealing to the human being
[1:16:09] it is to the believer it is appealing
[1:16:12] when our God
[1:16:13] becomes one of us
[1:16:15] that's appealing to the believer
[1:16:18] when God becomes one of us
[1:16:20] is that right that's appealing but you
[1:16:23] know he says to think how that God would
[1:16:26] cross himself and become our dust that
[1:16:29] he would become our stock a human stock
[1:16:31] the Creator who made all things oh he
[1:16:35] said how the word was made dust flesh
[1:16:38] and dwelt Among Us Jehovah the word
[1:16:41] became human became dust and tabernacled
[1:16:44] with us an everlasting sign that shall
[1:16:48] never end
[1:16:50] that was only the beginning
[1:16:54] true he came he didn't become a fully
[1:16:57] matured man he came as a baby why there
[1:17:00] had to be a birth it was speaking to you
[1:17:03] and I that that's the word itself was
[1:17:06] made flesh it came in a very simple
[1:17:08] manner because it was going to bring to
[1:17:11] you and I what was needed we needed a
[1:17:13] birth
[1:17:15] we needed to be born again we didn't
[1:17:18] need to be made over
[1:17:20] we'd have the same flaws the same issues
[1:17:22] we needed a birth
[1:17:26] is that right this is why in order to
[1:17:29] get that life to you and I in order for
[1:17:32] the price to be paid God himself had to
[1:17:35] come down and he went through every
[1:17:37] stage of life
[1:17:39] he knows what it's like as a boy he
[1:17:42] knows what it's like as a teenager he
[1:17:44] knows what every step of the way is like
[1:17:47] he knows the pressures he knows the
[1:17:49] Temptations He knows all of those things
[1:17:51] and he did that he did that for
[1:17:54] Redemption for you and I
[1:17:56] that when that word has you and I can
[1:17:59] look to that and that word all becoming
[1:18:02] flesh in our life what is it it's once
[1:18:05] again the same God walking in a Linda
[1:18:08] veil of a teenager God walking through
[1:18:11] the veil of a young man a young lady a
[1:18:14] man and a woman the same God veiled in
[1:18:18] his creation
[1:18:20] glory be to God in the highest
[1:18:23] it was Abraham's faith that United the
[1:18:27] spirit and the flesh together
[1:18:29] that's why this poke it is Abraham's
[1:18:32] seed when he came he took not on the
[1:18:34] nature of angels but he took upon Him
[1:18:37] Abraham's seed uniting the Flesh and the
[1:18:41] spirit together
[1:18:42] I don't know about you but anytime
[1:18:44] you've ever borrowed anything
[1:18:46] or maybe you've had somebody borrow
[1:18:47] something from you
[1:18:51] I know we've always had people we had to
[1:18:52] go back and ask hey
[1:18:54] you uh
[1:18:57] you you asked to borrow that right
[1:19:01] it wasn't donated
[1:19:03] oh yeah yeah yeah
[1:19:05] so borrow
[1:19:07] borrow means to temporarily use
[1:19:11] it means it's been surrendered I mean
[1:19:13] because look if
[1:19:14] somebody goes in to your house and I
[1:19:18] don't you know
[1:19:20] Albert Sammy We're All brothers and
[1:19:23] sisters here y'all know but I'd probably
[1:19:25] get your dander rougher a little bit if
[1:19:27] I went in there and took your favorite
[1:19:28] broom I said Oh Brother Ray won't mind
[1:19:30] this you know he's my brother in Christ
[1:19:34] right
[1:19:37] you'll know about that in a little bit
[1:19:42] but you see
[1:19:45] right it's different if I come and I ask
[1:19:48] and say brother do you mind would you
[1:19:50] can I borrow that song I don't just go
[1:19:53] into his house and take it that's called
[1:19:54] theft
[1:19:57] are you hearing me now
[1:19:59] God's not a thief
[1:20:01] the Bible said a thief and a robber
[1:20:04] cometh to kill and destroy
[1:20:08] but he has come that we might have life
[1:20:11] more abundantly he borrowed a womb he
[1:20:13] didn't force himself upon Mary he made
[1:20:16] his word known and Mary said how is this
[1:20:19] going to be how is this going to happen
[1:20:21] how's this going to come to pass he said
[1:20:23] here's how this sign will be produced in
[1:20:27] your life the Holy Ghost shall over
[1:20:30] Shadow thee
[1:20:33] what was happening as the word was being
[1:20:36] spoken the spirit of God was drawing
[1:20:40] upon her life not taking from her but
[1:20:43] causing her to yield
[1:20:45] you may borrow my life
[1:20:51] whoa
[1:20:54] oh he borrowed the womb just the same
[1:20:56] way that he borrows our bodies
[1:21:00] sure this body this body itself is not
[1:21:03] is not what God had in mind even though
[1:21:06] the picture on the the album is when
[1:21:09] when we were in the best of our of our
[1:21:11] time but that was before this negative
[1:21:14] there was a positive you don't have a
[1:21:16] negative I know a lot of young people
[1:21:17] they don't know what negatives are
[1:21:19] maybe some others but you know we used
[1:21:21] to have back in the days called a camera
[1:21:22] and it wasn't on the phone
[1:21:24] and I'm not talking about the Polaroids
[1:21:26] either but you know there had to be
[1:21:28] you'd have negatives and if you got a
[1:21:30] negative you could take that negative
[1:21:32] and go have another picture made and it
[1:21:34] was better than taking you know maybe
[1:21:36] some other picture you took that
[1:21:38] negative but the only way you got a
[1:21:39] negative is because it was taken from a
[1:21:42] positive
[1:21:43] is that right there was a picture taken
[1:21:46] before the foundation of the world
[1:21:49] amen that's not the negative that's the
[1:21:52] positive but that positive had been
[1:21:55] deposited down here and though this is
[1:21:57] the negative it's bearing the reflection
[1:22:00] of the positive that I always was a son
[1:22:04] or daughter of God this is just a
[1:22:07] borrowed body
[1:22:12] glory be to God and one of these days
[1:22:14] think about it where my body and my
[1:22:17] flesh flesh you know Body Spirit where
[1:22:19] he gives me such fits and you know it
[1:22:21] doesn't want me to pray it wants me to
[1:22:23] be lazy it wants me to read it wants me
[1:22:26] come on now I'm not just talking to me
[1:22:27] you know he wants to get into that oh
[1:22:29] you know you just need to relax and and
[1:22:31] this and that oh you know you don't need
[1:22:33] to go to church I mean hey you get
[1:22:35] somebody else you know you're kind of
[1:22:36] tired and this and that that old body if
[1:22:38] I gave into that it wouldn't be so easy
[1:22:41] but one of these days this body that I
[1:22:44] have borrowed and said hey buddy I need
[1:22:46] to borrow you today because I need to
[1:22:48] use your voice chords the Holy Spirit
[1:22:51] has put something in my heart I need to
[1:22:54] borrow you yeah but what am I going to
[1:22:56] get in return I'll tell you what you're
[1:22:57] going to get in return one of these days
[1:22:59] what you have yielded there's gonna come
[1:23:02] a sweep over this life and what has been
[1:23:05] surrendered in a borrowed way will be
[1:23:07] changed
[1:23:09] to match what's happened on the inside
[1:23:12] oh you're talking about a super sign an
[1:23:15] everlasting sign I want to ask you can
[1:23:18] he borrow your life
[1:23:21] can he borrow your body
[1:23:25] can he use your life to be a witness
[1:23:28] come on now don't get quiet on me
[1:23:30] can he usually think about it can he can
[1:23:32] he use your life to be a witness to your
[1:23:35] family to your Associates it will your
[1:23:38] life can he borrow it will it Point them
[1:23:40] there is a real real reality of deity to
[1:23:45] be tabernacled in flesh
[1:23:48] now remember there's a lot of other
[1:23:50] signs
[1:23:51] but before
[1:23:53] before we get any other sign because
[1:23:55] remember
[1:23:56] there's signs that are in the scripture
[1:24:01] such as speaking in tongues prophecy a
[1:24:05] lot of those things in there and God put
[1:24:07] them in and God didn't take them out
[1:24:09] but God never gave any any of those as
[1:24:12] the delivering sign
[1:24:15] praying for the sick and you know
[1:24:17] healing Miracle healings and broken
[1:24:19] Miracles but but there's one sign that
[1:24:21] is the super sign
[1:24:23] it's the greatest sign it's the sign
[1:24:25] that is above every other sign it's that
[1:24:28] sign that must be sought after first and
[1:24:31] that's the sign
[1:24:32] that God gave originally and that's of
[1:24:36] the Holy Ghost coming into the life and
[1:24:40] transforming it
[1:24:42] then everything else as he has needs of
[1:24:45] it it'll go you're saying brother Sammy
[1:24:46] what I'm saying that our experience is
[1:24:50] not based on any other sign
[1:24:54] it's based on the sign of the word made
[1:24:57] flesh in our life
[1:25:01] come on now
[1:25:03] that's what God God brought us a
[1:25:05] deliverance from that because look God
[1:25:08] delivered you and I from a confusion
[1:25:10] that we might walk with a fearlessness
[1:25:14] a boldness that we might have boldness
[1:25:17] Before the Throne of God that I know
[1:25:19] that the sin question has been settled
[1:25:23] I know that my life has been changed why
[1:25:26] because there has come a new creation on
[1:25:29] the inside in my life think of how they
[1:25:33] moved in when such a such a haste in
[1:25:36] that time you know think of how that God
[1:25:38] when he came to the Shepherds you know
[1:25:41] it didn't bother them
[1:25:43] I mean you know how
[1:25:45] how within it all God bypassed the
[1:25:48] theologians bypassed so he bypassed all
[1:25:50] of them he didn't go down to Jerusalem
[1:25:52] and but God here that here came on that
[1:25:55] here was Shepherds that was out there on
[1:25:57] the hillside by biting with their sheep
[1:26:01] they were doing what they were supposed
[1:26:04] to be doing
[1:26:06] and notice what happened here the Angels
[1:26:09] Came and began to announce to them
[1:26:12] let me tell you what's taken place in
[1:26:15] Bethlehem as they can ring out and say I
[1:26:18] want you to go to Bethlehem and see this
[1:26:21] thing which has come to pass the Lord
[1:26:23] hath made known these things that that
[1:26:26] here it is you'll find him you'll find
[1:26:29] the one that is to bring great joy the
[1:26:32] one that is a savior is born go and
[1:26:34] you'll find him you know what the call
[1:26:37] was is that you will see the word made
[1:26:41] flesh
[1:26:43] if they wouldn't have went they'd have
[1:26:45] never saw the word made flesh they
[1:26:47] couldn't go halfway and see the word
[1:26:48] made flesh
[1:26:50] justification is not the word made flesh
[1:26:53] they couldn't just go to sanctification
[1:26:55] and the word be made flesh it had to
[1:26:57] come to a full experience with God to
[1:27:00] where now the word and now God's life
[1:27:03] our life has met up and now the word is
[1:27:06] made flesh
[1:27:08] his life dwelling in our life you know
[1:27:11] it didn't bother them because the
[1:27:13] message that was being given in that
[1:27:15] moment was that the Messiah is here now
[1:27:20] he's on Earth right now he ain't coming
[1:27:22] he's on Earth right now that was a great
[1:27:25] message to them he's here so if he's
[1:27:29] here where's the at
[1:27:32] I need to find him
[1:27:34] this announcement there's a savior you
[1:27:36] know why I need saving I need
[1:27:38] deliverance and saving is where to save
[1:27:40] me from my sins I need Deliverance I
[1:27:44] need what was promised to come fully in
[1:27:47] my life
[1:27:48] all the massage on Earth you know what
[1:27:50] it didn't bother them then they begin to
[1:27:52] bring out how the Angels begin to
[1:27:54] worship
[1:27:55] laughs
[1:27:57] you know the first time the Angels Was
[1:27:59] Heard singing was over in job
[1:28:01] oh I'm not going to get there
[1:28:03] but that was the first time they were
[1:28:05] singing there was in heaven but now when
[1:28:08] creation here was upon her arms and what
[1:28:10] was coming to Earth what the rejoicing
[1:28:12] was over there was the lamb being
[1:28:15] offered up to make a way back for the
[1:28:17] Sons and Daughters of God that's what
[1:28:19] the rejoicing was there but now on Earth
[1:28:22] hear the angels are singing and
[1:28:25] rejoicing because now that lamb that was
[1:28:28] that was projected there is now on Earth
[1:28:32] the way has come down
[1:28:36] why do I get happy why do I Rejoice I'm
[1:28:39] not just rejoicing because the way is
[1:28:41] here I'm rejoicing because the way is
[1:28:45] here
[1:28:46] I've met him
[1:28:48] I know him
[1:28:49] it's a joy
[1:28:52] the way home is assure it's a reality
[1:28:56] that's what brings joy in our hearts
[1:28:58] this is why we glorify God we're not
[1:29:00] glorifying God because we've heard a
[1:29:02] message we're glorified God because what
[1:29:05] I've heard I've seen and I see it in my
[1:29:08] own life
[1:29:10] I see this word working and it brings a
[1:29:13] joy in my life
[1:29:17] oh I'm not beside myself I'm not crazy
[1:29:20] yeah I've lost my mind but I've got the
[1:29:23] mind of Christ I've got something that's
[1:29:25] satisfied I've got something that keeps
[1:29:28] me I've got something that keeps and
[1:29:30] gives me joy when sadness is all around
[1:29:33] there is a victory
[1:29:40] so what do you see
[1:29:42] when you look and you behold the word
[1:29:44] may flesh
[1:29:46] what do you see
[1:29:48] what is it to you
[1:29:51] is it just a church
[1:29:53] is it just a message
[1:29:56] is it just more
[1:29:58] teaching
[1:30:00] what do you see
[1:30:03] you see they they didn't just see they
[1:30:06] didn't see a teaching
[1:30:07] but they saw the word may flesh you know
[1:30:10] what that was that was a sign that sign
[1:30:13] of the word made flesh it was a sign
[1:30:15] calling them to the purpose that God had
[1:30:19] for their lives
[1:30:20] God's desire to be made flesh in their
[1:30:24] life
[1:30:26] and that's God's desire
[1:30:29] in our lives
[1:30:31] that that word would be made flesh
[1:30:34] oh brother Brahm says I'll give them a
[1:30:37] sign
[1:30:38] I'll be in their flesh I'll be like them
[1:30:41] they'll be like me
[1:30:42] he told the angels to look over
[1:30:44] the Angels told the Shepherds go look in
[1:30:47] the manger and see and you'll see what I
[1:30:49] mean that sign wasn't just for Angels it
[1:30:52] wasn't just for Shepherds it's for the
[1:30:55] world to see and believe that God dwells
[1:30:58] in flesh
[1:31:00] and through the offering of that flesh
[1:31:03] he Sanctified our flesh that he might
[1:31:06] dwell within us God in you Christ in you
[1:31:14] think of how brother Brown says it like
[1:31:16] this
[1:31:17] well he said I've received some mighty
[1:31:19] fine Christmas presents a movie camera
[1:31:20] many other things guns and things that
[1:31:23] people love me and they gave me how I
[1:31:25] appreciate all that but all this eternal
[1:31:28] life the Blessed assurance that Christ
[1:31:30] lives in us that his fullness dwells
[1:31:34] within us makes us rise and act
[1:31:37] different
[1:31:39] that that's what when we really behold
[1:31:42] the word may flesh let me tell you
[1:31:44] something there are people in lives
[1:31:47] that set on the platform
[1:31:50] even when you look in the Deep calm the
[1:31:52] Deep
[1:31:53] that didn't recognize what it was all
[1:31:55] about
[1:31:57] there was even the men that could look
[1:32:00] like T.L Osborne and said when we saw
[1:32:03] William Branham we saw Jesus Christ
[1:32:05] speaking of that life reproduced again
[1:32:07] what was spoken in the Bible
[1:32:09] when brother Bosworth could make a
[1:32:11] statement and he would pull on the on
[1:32:13] the in in on the coattail of of brother
[1:32:16] Vale and say I have waited years to see
[1:32:19] the ministry of Jesus Christ reproduced
[1:32:21] and I've seen it right here
[1:32:23] I'm not just talking about because these
[1:32:25] are things in writing
[1:32:27] but you see what it is you know what it
[1:32:29] was a sign of it was evening lights
[1:32:31] God promised in the evening time there
[1:32:34] would be light
[1:32:36] what was that light about the light
[1:32:38] itself was not to where we come and we
[1:32:41] rally around the messenger you must hear
[1:32:44] the message but what is the message
[1:32:46] speaking about
[1:32:48] who is the message revealing what is the
[1:32:51] message calling us too
[1:32:53] the message did not call us to worship
[1:32:56] the prophet
[1:32:58] the worship the message that did not
[1:33:00] call us just to gather around a group of
[1:33:03] teachings but the real manifestation is
[1:33:06] God and Christ are one it's time for the
[1:33:10] marriage of the Lamb has come
[1:33:13] it's an everlasting sign
[1:33:17] it's an appealing sign it doesn't appeal
[1:33:20] to the world but it appeals to the
[1:33:23] evening light people
[1:33:25] because there's a longing in our hearts
[1:33:28] it was something we craved we longed for
[1:33:31] what was it it was for almighty God it
[1:33:35] was a deep calling to the Deep
[1:33:39] an everlasting sign God said I'll give
[1:33:41] him an everlasting sign
[1:33:43] the whole version shall conceive
[1:33:47] it was not a work of man
[1:33:50] it's not in the work of man in your life
[1:33:53] it's a work of the Holy Ghost
[1:33:55] it's God coming down in your life
[1:33:58] personally it's God coming down God
[1:34:01] bringing forth in our life
[1:34:04] his own life
[1:34:08] what do we see when we look
[1:34:10] what do we see
[1:34:12] I tell you what I see I see Jesus Christ
[1:34:16] I see the god of Glory
[1:34:19] that's what I see I see the God who is
[1:34:22] rich in Mercy that desires to bring
[1:34:25] Deliverance to every heart in every life
[1:34:27] I see a god who's greater than the birth
[1:34:31] of a Browning I see a god who's greater
[1:34:34] and you put your last name to it I see a
[1:34:36] God who is more than Mindful and mighty
[1:34:40] to take care of whatever the situation
[1:34:42] might be in my life
[1:34:44] hallelujah or it might be hard and these
[1:34:47] things are pointed out and this is
[1:34:49] pointed out and that's pointed out but
[1:34:51] remember when God's pointing things out
[1:34:52] you know what God's doing God is
[1:34:54] speaking to you and I he's letting us
[1:34:56] know don't stop there keep going go all
[1:34:58] the way don't stop when the holy
[1:35:00] spirit's speak into our life don't pull
[1:35:02] back let our ideas fade away let our
[1:35:05] thoughts fade away because when God has
[1:35:07] brought forth that Eternal sign in your
[1:35:10] life there is no devil no trial no task
[1:35:14] nothing can take that away it's an
[1:35:16] eternal sign it is the Seal of the
[1:35:19] Living God it's a circumcision that has
[1:35:22] been made without hands it is a birth
[1:35:25] and your life is the Nativity grounds
[1:35:28] that Christ is displayed through
[1:35:31] you look at all those parts when they
[1:35:33] put the nativity scene in let me just
[1:35:35] tell you what that is when we really
[1:35:37] look down in your own life you say
[1:35:39] brother Samuel my life my life a Manger
[1:35:42] yeah you know I was a Manger because a
[1:35:44] Manger was a stinking rotten place
[1:35:47] and I don't care how good you were how
[1:35:49] good I was or I was raised in a message
[1:35:51] church at first birth is a stinking
[1:35:53] rotten birth
[1:35:55] I don't care how long it's been that's
[1:35:58] where it come now he came down and was
[1:36:00] born in the fireless oh my
[1:36:03] the manure didn't stop him the stench
[1:36:06] didn't stop him it was an appointed
[1:36:08] place
[1:36:09] you don't have to worry about it Jesus
[1:36:12] gets in there the manure Fades away The
[1:36:15] Stance Fades away he gets born right
[1:36:17] there that's it
[1:36:20] oh I can't quit this I can't quit that
[1:36:22] just invite him in let him come in he's
[1:36:26] the one that brings the quit
[1:36:30] and brings you alive
[1:36:33] to where your life what comes out of
[1:36:35] your life when the word comes forth amen
[1:36:37] yes the Lord Jesus be it unto me Lord
[1:36:40] according to Thy word be it unto me Lord
[1:36:42] according to Thy word yes Lord Jesus let
[1:36:45] it be Lord in my life
[1:36:46] what's happening it's a crucifying
[1:36:50] the life I live now
[1:36:53] in the flesh
[1:36:54] it's not me it's living
[1:36:55] but it's Christ who liveth in me
[1:36:59] it's Christ in me
[1:37:02] the hope of glory
[1:37:04] you're talking about an eternal sign
[1:37:07] God Made A Way
[1:37:08] that you and I
[1:37:10] could have that real
[1:37:12] true experience
[1:37:16] a place where we can put our foot down
[1:37:18] where there's a place within our life
[1:37:20] that I know I've met God
[1:37:25] tell you
[1:37:27] we understand it's more
[1:37:29] it's not our works
[1:37:31] it's not what we could do
[1:37:33] we could never Merit his grace
[1:37:38] as he went searching all throughout he
[1:37:41] came into Bethlehem he came searching
[1:37:43] and no place no place
[1:37:47] was there any room
[1:37:49] but God knew where the place was going
[1:37:51] to be
[1:37:53] God knew in this age where the place
[1:37:55] would be
[1:37:57] God knew he had children in this hour
[1:38:00] whose lives oh
[1:38:02] would be you know it doesn't matter what
[1:38:04] everything you could stack up but God
[1:38:06] knew
[1:38:08] I've got a place that I've reserved
[1:38:10] there for myself
[1:38:11] oh it's not the life right now that
[1:38:13] they're living but I've come to redeem
[1:38:14] what belongs to me
[1:38:18] so when you look
[1:38:19] what do you see
[1:38:21] I tell you I see the Mighty God
[1:38:24] when you look in the manger of your
[1:38:26] heart I mean when you look into that
[1:38:27] manger of your heart what do you see
[1:38:30] do you see the Living God
[1:38:32] do you see the word may flesh do you see
[1:38:35] Christ in your in your life well brother
[1:38:37] Sammy I agree with all the words that's
[1:38:39] good but is that fulfillment of the
[1:38:42] works that I do shall you do also is
[1:38:44] that present
[1:38:45] is it the same life that he lived
[1:38:48] if it's the same life that he lived
[1:38:49] that's an eternal sign
[1:38:51] but if it's not there yet to the same
[1:38:53] life that he lived keep pressing
[1:38:56] I said keep pressing until it comes to
[1:38:59] that place
[1:39:01] and when that life has come in your life
[1:39:03] you've got to press beyond your doubts
[1:39:05] you got to press me on all your
[1:39:07] discouragements let me tell you
[1:39:08] something right now the very thing that
[1:39:10] you start moving away Satan wants you to
[1:39:13] move away from prayer
[1:39:16] he wants you to move away from playing
[1:39:19] getting into the message and playing it
[1:39:22] I tell you I'm telling you brothers and
[1:39:24] sisters there's a power within that
[1:39:30] I sit there and as I'm as I'm listening
[1:39:32] or I'm walking having it going I tell
[1:39:35] you it's a channel it's an inspiration
[1:39:37] that just comes and it just moves let me
[1:39:39] tell you something you're setting an
[1:39:40] atmosphere in your home what do you want
[1:39:42] to invite in your home
[1:39:44] come on now there's going to be channels
[1:39:46] and things that are going to try to move
[1:39:48] into your home what do you want in your
[1:39:49] home
[1:39:50] if you want angels to visit
[1:39:53] I'm telling you get into the message
[1:39:56] start praying just put the message on
[1:39:59] and play the message just say God Lead
[1:40:01] Me Lord Lord speak to me you know what I
[1:40:04] have needed I think that's a good way to
[1:40:06] start this year out
[1:40:08] I think it's a good way to say you know
[1:40:10] what Lord I'm going to consecrate myself
[1:40:12] into that life on the inside I want that
[1:40:16] baby remember he wasn't born a fully
[1:40:19] matured man
[1:40:21] you're not born fully matured but it is
[1:40:24] a birth and you grow to maturity
[1:40:28] but you've got to feed that inner man on
[1:40:31] the things of God
[1:40:33] there's things you and I as we started
[1:40:34] out as a little a little baby or a
[1:40:36] little kid a little toddler even things
[1:40:38] right now I look back to my daddy and
[1:40:40] them and told me when I was a teenager I
[1:40:42] didn't understand why they were saying
[1:40:43] it I knew they were talking with an
[1:40:45] urgency I didn't understand it at that
[1:40:47] time now I do
[1:40:50] I understand it you know why I've grown
[1:40:52] to that place I understood what they
[1:40:54] were talking about that's the same way
[1:40:56] it is as we're growing in Jesus Christ
[1:40:58] but make sure you've had that birth on
[1:41:01] the inside where your Nature has been
[1:41:03] changed and then feed yourself with the
[1:41:06] word of God
[1:41:07] let the word of God change your life
[1:41:11] let it transform you from Glory unto
[1:41:14] Glory unto Glory let the sheer be a
[1:41:17] declaration in your heart in your life
[1:41:19] what do I see when I'm looking in there
[1:41:21] what do I see I want to look in and I
[1:41:23] want to behold his Beauty
[1:41:25] I don't want to just come to church I
[1:41:27] want to Behold Him I want to give myself
[1:41:29] to him I want that word
[1:41:31] perfect and change my life I want to
[1:41:34] give myself to it I don't want to just
[1:41:36] come and hear it and go away I want to
[1:41:38] give myself to the word I want to take
[1:41:40] that word Lord I want to see what you've
[1:41:42] said I want to go with haste and I want
[1:41:45] to look in upon that word I'm going to
[1:41:46] look upon that word because what I give
[1:41:48] myself to look upon I will become

[1:45:36] that just causes everything to rot away
[1:45:38] that is Discerning the things in the
[1:45:40] life that is working to hinder Lord I

[1:47:24] oh God to think that you chose us Lord
[1:47:28] we unworthy
[1:47:30] unfit
[1:47:32] but God in your choosing Lord you've
[1:47:37] seen what was beneath everything that
[1:47:40] was in our life that part of yourself or
[1:47:43] as the prophet would use the
[1:47:44] dramatization
[1:47:46] that little egg that the eagle knew that
[1:47:49] was hers all along
[1:47:52] Lord you came and you sought us out Lord
[1:47:55] and you've drawn us the Lord to yourself
[1:47:58] granted Lord May
[1:48:00] as Lord every life and every heart we
[1:48:03] look to you father
[1:48:04] that God that word be made flesh

[1:48:11] in the name of Jesus Christ

[1:48:16] but don't you love him
[1:48:19] amen may God
[1:48:22] amen just have
[1:48:24] his wonderful way
[1:48:26] in our life
[1:48:28] if there's one thing just as that
[1:48:31] just as everything else pointed
[1:48:33] to that great announcement into that
[1:48:35] great event May May Our Lives be
[1:48:38] be just as much may that light
[1:48:41] Upon Our Lives let it be that it points
[1:48:45] in our homes
[1:48:47] Families Our Associates let it be that
[1:48:50] it's it's a light that's pointing our
[1:48:52] life is leading others
[1:48:54] to Jesus Christ
[1:48:56] as an announcement that the same God
[1:49:00] that has come here that you you wonder
[1:49:03] and you you look and say what makes you
[1:49:05] different or what church you belong to
[1:49:06] or what
[1:49:07] there's something about it that
[1:49:09] I I want that same reality that you have
[1:49:12] I I may not be able to explain it but I
[1:49:13] want that same reality
[1:49:16] I believe that's in our homes
[1:49:18] I want that same reality I want that
[1:49:21] same perseverance I want that I want
[1:49:23] that that where there's a fire that's
[1:49:25] living in your life Daddy I want that
[1:49:28] fire that's living in your life that's
[1:49:30] what I want our lives what is it doing
[1:49:32] pointing them to the word made flesh
[1:49:36] but you see it's not pointing people
[1:49:38] to a Manger
[1:49:40] it's not pointing them to a prophet it's
[1:49:42] not pointing them to a pastor it's not
[1:49:45] pointing him to a church not pointing
[1:49:47] them to a deacon I believe the word
[1:49:48] ought to be made flesh in every life
[1:49:51] but all of that is pointing to God's
[1:49:54] desire
[1:49:55] to be made flesh
[1:49:57] in your life
[1:49:58] that's what it's all about if our life
[1:50:01] is the correct billboard and display for
[1:50:04] Jesus Christ what it's displaying and
[1:50:05] crying out God in Christ are one there's
[1:50:09] a real experience there's a God who
[1:50:11] desires to move down the Living God and
[1:50:14] dwell in Tabernacle in your life
[1:50:17] what do I have to do let him borrow
[1:50:21] let him have
[1:50:22] say Lord I turn my life over to you
[1:50:25] well brother Samuel I've got these
[1:50:26] Ambitions let him borrow them
[1:50:28] turn them over to him
[1:50:31] I've got these dreams dream over to him
[1:50:33] let him borrow him
[1:50:34] he can do more in his hands
[1:50:39] that little lad's lunch would have only
[1:50:41] fed him but when he got in the hands of
[1:50:43] Jesus
[1:50:45] it fed a multitude and not only did it
[1:50:48] feel in being a multitude there was some
[1:50:50] worship going on afterwards they had 12
[1:50:52] baskets to pick up
[1:50:54] because what he does he multiplies it
[1:50:56] shows there's no end to this life
[1:50:57] there's no end the same Holy Ghost he
[1:51:00] gave he gives it the same way it's with
[1:51:02] the same strength the same power the
[1:51:04] same Glory the same Authority he keeps
[1:51:06] on giving it
[1:51:08] [Applause]
[1:51:09] and you know what after it's all said
[1:51:11] and done every time there's 12 baskets
[1:51:13] 12 is worship there's always worship
[1:51:16] when he comes

[1:58:52] foreign
[1:58:53] [Music]
[1:58:56] [Applause]
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:29] so glad I'm Yours Hallelujah
[1:59:35] you know I think as we come into this
[1:59:37] this moment
[1:59:39] even in this year and rededication and
[1:59:41] renewal
[1:59:42] you know
[1:59:44] it's a wonderful time
[1:59:47] to even you start out
[1:59:51] and reading your Bible and I know we say
[1:59:53] well but the same I read my Bible and I
[1:59:55] well I trust we do but I you know it's
[1:59:58] it's one of those times that
[2:00:00] I found for myself over the years here
[2:00:04] just taking I because it's easy for me
[2:00:07] to get out on the trail and just start
[2:00:08] studying and I don't I want to just read
[2:00:11] sometimes there's times of study I'll
[2:00:13] get into that and it's just I can get
[2:00:15] going on that
[2:00:16] but you know I'm talking about where you
[2:00:18] just take the Bible and read it through
[2:00:20] in a year it's still hard during those
[2:00:21] times but I've I've done it in a manner
[2:00:23] the reason I've done it I've shared that
[2:00:24] with you before
[2:00:26] just so it keeps me just just focused on
[2:00:29] this
[2:00:30] and I just have that that look that that
[2:00:33] little bit of time that is right there
[2:00:35] and then of course you know I I studied
[2:00:37] things will just run out after that but
[2:00:38] there's so many things available to us
[2:00:41] so many apps
[2:00:43] that are available I've used apps I've
[2:00:45] used things that just keep things that
[2:00:47] and it's good I'll tell you what I I
[2:00:49] will say this to you there have been
[2:00:51] many times
[2:00:52] where I've done that because I can stay
[2:00:54] just focused on this but there's been so
[2:00:56] many times where different things out of
[2:00:58] right then and there
[2:01:00] things will strike and then what starts
[2:01:03] being ministered right here is things
[2:01:05] that's coming right out of
[2:01:06] the devotion in the morning
[2:01:09] because the Holy Spirit just starts to
[2:01:11] move right on the scriptures and and
[2:01:13] different things and there's messages I
[2:01:15] haven't even preached from a few years
[2:01:16] ago of just some things just that was
[2:01:18] striking in there
[2:01:20] but what I'm just saying in this manner
[2:01:23] make it a purpose
[2:01:25] make it a purpose don't don't try to
[2:01:27] listen don't try to be well I'm going to
[2:01:29] read it I'm going to read this much no
[2:01:31] even if you start with something you
[2:01:33] know just start if you start with the
[2:01:35] Book of Matthew wherever you're going to
[2:01:36] start at but just turn out to that I
[2:01:39] think it ends up being what 85 verses a
[2:01:41] day or something like that
[2:01:43] you might think that's very carnal but
[2:01:45] I'll tell you what in order to have a
[2:01:47] fire you've got to have wood
[2:01:51] you got to have wood
[2:01:54] and sometimes it's just a little bit of
[2:01:56] an accountability of something like that
[2:01:57] that you can you can look at I'll tell
[2:01:59] you what it's been a blessing
[2:02:01] just going through because I'll tell you
[2:02:04] what
[2:02:05] the message
[2:02:08] it's God's light
[2:02:10] this Bible has become a new book
[2:02:15] you see it all the way through
[2:02:19] and I just would just set yourself upon
[2:02:21] that
[2:02:22] say God
[2:02:23] I'm just going to dedicate myself just
[2:02:25] let just let God let God bring forth the
[2:02:27] results let him bring forth the results
[2:02:29] just give ourselves to him and I think
[2:02:30] what a song
[2:02:32] that we can sing I'd like to sing that
[2:02:33] song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus a lot of
[2:02:36] distractions a lot of things will try to
[2:02:37] get our attention and you know what
[2:02:40] just set our hearts up on this I'm not
[2:02:42] going to give my time and energy to
[2:02:45] things I can't even change
[2:02:48] you know what I'm saying
[2:02:50] I mean you ain't gonna change politics
[2:02:55] you ain't gonna change no sports team or
[2:02:57] you know you're rooting for them ain't
[2:02:59] gonna do you ain't gonna let's give our
[2:03:01] thing let's give ourselves to the things
[2:03:02] that matter
[2:03:05] let's give ourselves say Lord I want to
[2:03:07] just reconsecrate myself to the things
[2:03:10] that matter I I believe I believe this
[2:03:12] right here I know it to be true that if
[2:03:14] we consecrate ourselves more to him all
[2:03:16] the other things in life the anxieties
[2:03:18] the frustrations and that'll just go
[2:03:20] because that is a result of those things
[2:03:23] but if we just turn our eyes upon him
[2:03:25] you'll you'll find the peace of God
[2:03:28] just moving in
[2:03:30] you'll find your approach only one that
[2:03:31] there won't be problems but you'll just
[2:03:33] find your approach to things and you
[2:03:34] know what I don't know but I know God's
[2:03:36] going to make a way and you'll even be
[2:03:38] looking at yourself and say wow
