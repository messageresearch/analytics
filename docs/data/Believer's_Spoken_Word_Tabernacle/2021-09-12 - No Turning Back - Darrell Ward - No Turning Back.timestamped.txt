[29:52] every
[30:06] god bless you you may be seated just a
[30:08] moment
[30:10] and if anything at all we have you up
[30:12] and down you say you had your exercise
[30:14] today
[30:16] but
[30:16] we just are so thankful to the lord for
[30:18] his mercy here this morning
[30:20] giving us another opportunity to be able
[30:23] to come together
[30:24] amen in the precious name of the lord
[30:26] jesus christ and
[30:28] the lord is so good to us last night
[30:31] amen what a what a wonderful service and
[30:34] a word that god brought to our hearts
[30:37] and you know
[30:38] the things that god does as soon as
[30:41] it resonates in our hearts the scripture
[30:43] says he's the high priest of our
[30:45] confession
[30:46] we begin to confess what god has already
[30:49] done for us
[30:51] it's settled
[30:52] and we we certainly expect just even for
[30:56] god that god is fulfilling his word i
[30:59] think it was so fitting last night i
[31:00] don't know if you
[31:02] caught it or not
[31:04] but i thought it was so fitting
[31:06] you know sometimes you look in a service
[31:08] and you can find in a service sometimes
[31:10] where there is
[31:11] something sometimes we have to press
[31:13] through things
[31:14] and there's things that you you notice
[31:16] other times it seems like things just so
[31:18] flows just so nicely
[31:20] and i looked at it last night i you know
[31:23] the young people here they were they had
[31:25] to start again and again
[31:27] and you say brother sam does that make
[31:28] you nervous no not a bit i was to me i
[31:32] was more proud that they stood there and
[31:33] said we're going to get this right
[31:36] you say why would that be because that's
[31:38] typical of a christian walk
[31:40] not every day goes right right as we
[31:42] have it planned or think about it and
[31:44] things come up and i thought it was so
[31:46] fitting last night with even how god
[31:49] brought the message and the message that
[31:51] was spoke because the things that was
[31:53] spoke to us god announcing that no
[31:55] matter what obstacle that you have in
[31:57] your way
[31:58] that god is greater than every obstacle
[32:02] greater than every situation and see god
[32:04] had that whole service he had it
[32:06] orchestrated
[32:07] it was arranged in everything that god
[32:10] does god doesn't do things by chance and
[32:12] so there's things that god permits to
[32:14] come along and it's it's an arrangement
[32:16] by god right here this morning while
[32:19] we're here
[32:20] we know there'll never be a gathering
[32:21] like this again some of us will be here
[32:24] some of us won't there'll never be a
[32:26] quite a gathering maybe just like this
[32:28] again but god is mindful and he has
[32:32] every bit of this arranged
[32:35] this who's supposed to be here is here
[32:38] and so we're just looking to the lord
[32:41] and i want to just welcome our visitors
[32:43] here this morning may god bless you
[32:46] and we just want you just to feel at
[32:48] home
[32:49] i want to just say before brother daryl
[32:51] comes we are very thankful that brother
[32:54] daryl made the sacrifice to be here with
[32:56] us
[32:56] this weekend and uh so thankful for
[33:00] that each of you as you made the
[33:02] sacrifice and throughout the times to be
[33:04] able to be here in these services and we
[33:07] had these
[33:08] these services that here and that are
[33:10] coming well we've had these planned out
[33:13] uh since uh may april
[33:15] and just to have these times just
[33:17] feeling on our heart and know that god
[33:19] is mindful of our need here this morning
[33:22] so whatever you have on your heart or
[33:24] the need in your life just just put it
[33:26] before god this morning and just invite
[33:28] him to say lord speak to my need
[33:31] because
[33:32] he he will come
[33:34] and he'll speak and minister personally
[33:37] to your need and when he does that just
[33:39] receive it just just receive what he has
[33:42] for you just let him just minister to
[33:43] you in a personal way
[33:46] this week perhaps as many of you know
[33:50] brother rowell soriano went on home to
[33:52] be with the lord
[33:53] and uh
[33:54] so that was when i we think of that that
[33:57] was
[33:58] quite a loss and um brother rowell was
[34:02] just going to be here in october
[34:04] 62 years old and
[34:06] for me to stand here i don't want to
[34:07] take the time away today
[34:10] perhaps there's other things at a
[34:11] different time that i'll share but what
[34:13] a great soldier a great general that has
[34:16] went on home
[34:17] to be with the lord
[34:19] just the things that as i expressed you
[34:21] here just a couple weeks ago when i was
[34:23] just putting things together
[34:25] to show you the pictures that where we
[34:27] had we had sent money as a congregation
[34:30] to
[34:30] raise up a a church there
[34:33] in pakistani and when we
[34:35] that that church that everything has
[34:37] been raised up but they don't have doors
[34:39] and they don't have windows and brother
[34:40] roell had just texted me here
[34:42] at the end of july and said brother
[34:44] samuel would you all be able to help
[34:47] this congregation now get the windows
[34:49] and the doors in because the brothers
[34:51] they worked all the way through
[34:53] you know they've had lockdowns like like
[34:55] it's nobody's business
[34:57] and
[34:58] so they've but they've worked all the
[34:59] way through it and even brother o'ell
[35:02] i had a i even had a an email or brother
[35:05] or well even during the whole time he
[35:07] titled the email i've got it he sent it
[35:09] in july
[35:10] evangelism during the pandemic
[35:13] and where you you see where there were
[35:15] there were lives where they were going
[35:17] out and ministering just as they had
[35:19] always and hearts and souls were coming
[35:21] to the lord and they were baptizing them
[35:23] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[35:26] and i just i remember opening that and
[35:28] looking at it and then of course you
[35:30] visit a lot of things you know as it
[35:31] comes along
[35:32] for me there's no way that i can in
[35:34] these few moments share with you of
[35:36] everything that you'd see that brother
[35:38] rowell
[35:39] is so connected with but the one thing
[35:41] that i do look at it when i begin to
[35:43] just look to the lord and i said lord
[35:45] you know you you never replace anybody
[35:47] you just don't say well this person here
[35:50] they went on and now they just replaced
[35:52] you don't replace anybody because god
[35:54] doesn't make carbon copies
[35:56] that's not god's way brother brown made
[35:58] it clear he said god doesn't run his
[36:00] business like a sears and rose road buck
[36:02] harmony house
[36:04] that's why god has palm trees oak trees
[36:06] and on and on and on but the one thing
[36:08] about it is it was just meditating in
[36:10] the office the one day and it just
[36:11] because this has laid so heavy on me
[36:13] this week and you know grieving within
[36:15] the the whole part of it there
[36:17] uh
[36:18] i just was just looking to the lord and
[36:21] the one thing the lord just spoke to my
[36:22] heart with on it within this is how that
[36:25] with brother o'ell you take a life that
[36:28] was just so yielded to god
[36:30] and what we see all everything that that
[36:33] was that was accomplished it was because
[36:35] of a life that was just yielded to god
[36:38] and what god had called him to do
[36:40] it was god
[36:42] who did everything through brother roell
[36:45] and brother rowell just allowed god to
[36:47] do it a lot of things that even brother
[36:49] oil did was very i would say
[36:51] unconventional in its thinking but god
[36:53] needed that and used that in order to
[36:56] reach and even to start those mystery
[36:58] expos where you had
[37:00] those different ones being worn to the
[37:01] lord that was outside of the box
[37:03] thinking but it was right in the mind of
[37:05] god to be able to reach that thousands
[37:08] and thousands of souls and i just always
[37:11] um you know i just not only appreciate
[37:13] brother rowell's uh
[37:15] his love and his zeal for the word of
[37:17] god but i also appreciated his humility
[37:20] his down to earth and you know you can
[37:22] just you just i always appreciated that
[37:25] that spirit about him
[37:27] uh you know and just we just
[37:29] we're definitely gonna miss him and uh
[37:31] we're missing even though you know he
[37:33] was here only one time out of the year
[37:35] and
[37:36] you know would be with us generally
[37:37] about a week or so but sister cynthia
[37:40] and the girls sister paula sister indy
[37:43] the whole church there the overcomer
[37:45] worship center and all the saints
[37:47] throughout the philippines
[37:49] they're really missing him
[37:51] and uh sister cynthia has just continued
[37:54] to convey that
[37:55] uh you know even
[37:57] texts and things that you know just a
[37:59] lot of the news that you have to get
[38:01] used to
[38:02] and so you just i know you've been
[38:04] praying for them just continue to hold
[38:06] them up in prayer that the lord will

[38:11] merciful to them and give them strength
[38:13] as well during this time
[38:15] amen we certainly we love brother rowell
[38:17] we just just appreciated his ministry
[38:20] and you know one by one we find out nine
[38:23] there's just there's more there
[38:26] on the other side and i believe we're
[38:28] really close
[38:29] i believe we're really close and i
[38:31] believe with all of my heart it's in the
[38:33] time like this may god help us not to
[38:36] lose focus
[38:37] amen we're right we're right at the
[38:39] final stretch we're right here we can
[38:41] see the finishing line
[38:43] it's the time not to lose our focus but
[38:45] to really be focused in and say lord
[38:47] help me be zeroed in with everything
[38:50] evaluate everything that comes across
[38:52] our pathway evaluate it just don't look
[38:54] at it and say well this is a blessing of
[38:55] god evaluate it if it's a blessing of
[38:57] god it'll draw me closer to god
[39:00] but if it's something that comes along
[39:02] that's good but it's not going to draw
[39:04] me closer to god then i can't call it a
[39:06] blessing of god
[39:07] so we we know as believers to discern
[39:10] these things and discern it our desire
[39:12] is to be closer to the lord

[51:54] hands this morning for your glory for we
[51:56] ask it in jesus name and the bride says
[52:00] god bless you saying she may be seated
[52:03] i want to share a quote with you brother
[52:04] bryan says now job was a man that
[52:06] carried out god's commandments to the
[52:08] letter exactly
[52:10] and satan knew that
[52:12] but he said if you'll just let me have
[52:14] him i'll make him curse you to your face
[52:17] so god told him he said now he's in your
[52:20] hands
[52:21] but don't you take his life
[52:24] and satan even stretched that as far as
[52:26] he could on that
[52:28] but no matter how far satan stretched
[52:30] that he could not take his life because
[52:34] god said so
[52:36] he said do with him what she will but do
[52:39] not take his life and the father said
[52:43] the prophet said that satan stretched
[52:44] that as far as he could stretch that
[52:48] yet he could not take his life he took
[52:52] every friend and everything that he had
[52:54] almost his complete life but he couldn't
[52:57] take his life
[52:59] but job still helped right on see there
[53:01] was no turning back
[53:04] you see when a man or a person has once
[53:06] really come into contact with god
[53:09] with that genuine revealed faith that
[53:12] god
[53:12] is well that's what we need this morning
[53:15] is to have an understanding of god is
[53:18] amen not god was not god will be but
[53:21] what god is right now
[53:25] hallelujah there is nothing no time
[53:27] nowhere that could ever separate that
[53:30] man from his god i believe it was paul
[53:32] said there's no strife no hunger no
[53:35] pearls neither living creatures or death
[53:37] or anything that can separate us from
[53:39] the love of god which is in christ jesus
[53:43] you are securely anchored in him
[53:46] because you were ordained to that
[53:49] life
[53:52] [Music]
[54:01] we are here because god placed us here
[54:03] for such a time as this amen and god
[54:06] never placed us here to fail but he put
[54:09] us here that we would overcome amen and
[54:11] i want the devil to know this morning
[54:13] we've got the answer to every question
[54:18] amen we are not an organization we are
[54:21] not a denomination but we are his body
[54:23] on the earth in this hour amen
[54:27] hallelujah you're anchored in him
[54:29] because you are ordained to that life
[54:32] oh hallelujah
[54:34] you can't fail no more than god can fail
[54:37] job stayed with the word because he knew
[54:40] the word would not fail amen and no amen
[54:45] nothing can keep god's word from
[54:47] accomplishing that which it's set to do
[54:50] the prophet said god's purpose can never
[54:53] be defeated
[54:55] there is nothing that can defeat it so
[54:57] how happy we are to be today
[55:03] resting upon the beautiful revelation of
[55:06] the word of the living god that there's
[55:08] neither things that the present nor
[55:10] things that can come there's no sickness
[55:13] no sorrow no death no perils no nothing
[55:16] can separate us from the purpose of the
[55:19] living god what god has imagined in his
[55:21] mind what god has purposed in his heart
[55:24] to bring the past there is no demon
[55:27] there is no power there is nothing that
[55:30] can ever separate god's immortal eternal
[55:33] plan
[55:36] hallelujah
[55:37] it must be as god said
[55:40] [Applause]
[55:42] hallelujah the things the prophet of god

[58:10] sister years ago down south carolina she
[58:12] wrote a song

[58:35] a stronger wind than this to keep me
[58:37] from my promise it's going to take a
[58:39] stronger wind than this to turn me
[58:42] around it's going to take a stronger
[58:44] wind than this hallelujah to keep this
[58:47] eagle down

[58:52] was predestinated to fly
[58:55] there is no wind that'll hold me down

[1:06:59] saying lead silas may be whining a
[1:07:01] little bit he might have sunk dinner
[1:07:05] but god was looking down in the banister
[1:07:07] of time and god said that's my boys down
[1:07:09] there and god came down and he said i'm
[1:07:11] going to sing bass there's something
[1:07:14] about family harmony
[1:07:16] oh hallelujah and god came down and
[1:07:20] began to shake that prison house
[1:07:22] and the chains began to come off
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:33] [Applause]
[1:07:34] shut the walls down to the prison house
[1:07:37] so i've come to receive your praise your
[1:07:39] backs against the wall praise his name
[1:07:42] you feel you can't go out just raise
[1:07:44] your hands and say greater is he that is
[1:07:46] in me
[1:07:47] [Applause]
[1:07:52] we live in a nation of freedom thank god
[1:07:55] we got freedom of speech we certainly
[1:07:57] have
[1:07:58] but probably said the first thing you
[1:08:00] know
[1:08:01] is they'll try to stop all this
[1:08:04] you know they asked the holocaust
[1:08:05] survivor
[1:08:07] he said how
[1:08:08] did you allow this to happen to your
[1:08:10] people
[1:08:11] you know what he said
[1:08:13] it was so subtle
[1:08:16] right
[1:08:17] they came in and just began to change
[1:08:19] a few laws
[1:08:21] and we thought oh well you know that's
[1:08:22] not so bad it'll blow over in a year or
[1:08:25] so
[1:08:27] he said then there's a few others and
[1:08:29] done something else
[1:08:31] something else and he said it was only
[1:08:33] when we had to wear
[1:08:35] the
[1:08:36] star out on the street to go to the mark
[1:08:41] to show our
[1:08:45] star
[1:08:46] that we was different than the other
[1:08:48] people
[1:08:49] only then that we realized we were in
[1:08:52] trouble
[1:08:54] friends we enjoy freedom
[1:08:56] thank god we live in a great country
[1:08:58] we've got our problems but it's still
[1:08:59] the greatest country on this earth
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:04] but the prophecy the first thing you
[1:09:05] know is they'll try to stop all this
[1:09:07] they'll take our freedom from us
[1:09:10] so subtle they'll try to quit praying
[1:09:12] they'll try to quit praying for the sick
[1:09:14] and put a band on it
[1:09:17] and just remember
[1:09:19] when the persecution rises
[1:09:21] the church comes to its very height then
[1:09:25] it's always at its best
[1:09:29] oh brother all this is happening what's
[1:09:31] going to happen to the church i'll tell
[1:09:32] you what's going to happen it'll be our
[1:09:34] finest hour
[1:09:37] hallelujah
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:40] no matter what they do remember god is
[1:09:43] working it all together for our good
[1:09:45] according to romans 8 28 all things work
[1:09:49] to the good amen
[1:09:51] all things then no matter what they try
[1:09:53] to do god will turn it around and make
[1:09:56] it for your good somehow
[1:09:58] [Applause]
[1:10:01] god working it all together jesus said
[1:10:04] my sheep hear my voice and i know them
[1:10:06] and they follow me and i give unto them
[1:10:09] eternal life and they shall never perish
[1:10:14] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[1:10:17] my head
[1:10:18] my father which gave them me
[1:10:21] is greater
[1:10:23] than all
[1:10:26] you need to put that on your
[1:10:27] refrigerator no you need to take soap
[1:10:29] and write it on your mirror when you get
[1:10:30] up in the morning to wash your face
[1:10:32] right there on your mirror you need to
[1:10:33] see it my father
[1:10:36] is greater
[1:10:37] than them
[1:10:39] and no man is able to pluck them
[1:10:42] out of my father's hand
[1:10:46] there's not a wind strong enough there's
[1:10:48] not a devil big enough there's not a
[1:10:50] situation great enough that's able to
[1:10:53] shut this bride down
[1:11:00] we are god's covenant people
[1:11:04] you are the covenant people of god god
[1:11:06] tore christ apart at calvary making the
[1:11:08] covenant swearing by himself and he took
[1:11:10] the body up into heaven which will
[1:11:12] return someday but the spirit he gave
[1:11:14] back to lead the church the same life
[1:11:17] that was in christ jesus
[1:11:19] is in the church tonight by the holy
[1:11:21] ghost doing and acting and performing

[1:11:29] got the covenant we are a covenant

[1:16:17] years ago
[1:16:19] my father-in-law he worked for eastman
[1:16:20] chemical company and had a little
[1:16:22] intramural softball league inside the
[1:16:24] company
[1:16:26] so he had a little team
[1:16:27] he asked me to play on it because when i
[1:16:29] was younger i was on a state
[1:16:31] championship softball team pitch for him
[1:16:33] so he wanted me to play of course i was
[1:16:34] playing outfield at that at that time
[1:16:36] with with him
[1:16:38] and so down at eastman there was a big
[1:16:40] water tank
[1:16:41] and there's a guy working on it and this
[1:16:43] certain team was playing
[1:16:44] and these guys were standing out in the
[1:16:46] outfield and the guy on the tank he
[1:16:48] could see the ball team he could see the
[1:16:49] ball game so he was up there supposed to
[1:16:51] be working on the tank but he's watching
[1:16:53] the game
[1:16:55] and those guys out there in the outfield
[1:16:56] the pitcher would pitch the ball and
[1:16:58] crack they just
[1:17:03] and it got so bad that the outfielder
[1:17:05] you know i guess it's getting hot out
[1:17:06] there
[1:17:07] he had his glove on top of his head
[1:17:09] and every time he hit the ball just
[1:17:15] and the guy up on the tank he yelled
[1:17:17] down he said hey buddy what's the score
[1:17:21] and the guy said
[1:17:22] it's seven to nothing
[1:17:25] he said y'all losing ain't you
[1:17:28] he said i don't know
[1:17:31] we ain't batted yet
[1:17:35] oh
[1:17:36] hallelujah i want the devil to know
[1:17:38] we've not even stepped up to the plate

[1:19:13] telling us you can do it you can make it
[1:19:16] amen don't turn back don't give up don't
[1:19:19] quit now
[1:19:21] [Applause]
[1:19:26] amen
[1:19:27] run with everything that's in you
[1:19:30] isaiah said no weapon that's formed
[1:19:33] against thee shall prosper and every
[1:19:35] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[1:19:36] judgment thou shalt condemn this is the
[1:19:39] heritage of the servants of the lord and
[1:19:41] the righteousness is of me saith the
[1:19:43] lord
[1:19:45] satan gets to howling
[1:19:47] gets to blow in his poison breath
[1:19:50] the winds get to blowing stronger
[1:19:53] just remember this
[1:19:54] eagles were built
[1:19:56] to take strong
[1:19:58] winds
[1:20:00] the harder the wind the higher they fly
[1:20:04] the harder the trial the stronger the
[1:20:06] wind the greater we fly
[1:20:09] eagles are a special built bird amen
[1:20:14] hallelujah
[1:20:16] he can go where hawks can't go
[1:20:20] oh they can go up so far but the wind
[1:20:23] turns them back the out at the altitude
[1:20:25] turns them back
[1:20:28] but not the eagle he can fly higher and
[1:20:30] higher because his genetics says he can
[1:20:34] do it
[1:20:36] you see the strong wind actually
[1:20:38] vindicates
[1:20:40] who he really is
[1:20:44] you know they used to take the wheat and
[1:20:46] the chaff you know how they separated it
[1:20:47] how they used to do it in the days of
[1:20:49] ethiopia they would throw it up into the
[1:20:50] wind
[1:20:52] and the wind would separate the child
[1:20:54] from the wheat so the strong wind
[1:20:56] blowing does two things
[1:20:59] it separates the chaff
[1:21:01] but it gathers the wheat together
[1:21:07] oh god
[1:21:10] amen a prophet said that the eagle's a
[1:21:13] special bird to take this food he has to
[1:21:15] be made up to go into those atmospheres
[1:21:17] there's another thing about him in order
[1:21:19] to get up there he has to have strong
[1:21:21] wings
[1:21:23] his feathers won't fly out of him
[1:21:25] because he can't see
[1:21:26] other birds of their feathers that fly
[1:21:28] out of them they can't stand when they
[1:21:29] get up there but the old eagle can soar
[1:21:31] with another bird kate 100 yards off the
[1:21:33] ground without flopping himself to death
[1:21:34] he thought they said you know that's
[1:21:35] right they'll just beat the air and
[1:21:37] punch an old crane or something bumping
[1:21:38] up and down trying to ride the waves and
[1:21:40] stagger over where an eagle just sets
[1:21:42] his wings and rides on the wind his
[1:21:45] feathers are strong they don't move they
[1:21:47] don't give he just maneuvers his body
[1:21:49] and he sells away and that's the way of
[1:21:51] every believer he doesn't run from
[1:21:53] pillar to post from place to place
[1:21:55] methodist this week baptist next one
[1:21:57] this week another the next he just sets
[1:21:59] his faith in god's eternal word
[1:22:01] and he sails away
[1:22:03] riding on the waves of the air
[1:22:06] oh just look at those great big wings
[1:22:08] that god has given us
[1:22:13] take your stand amen
[1:22:15] stand there upon the rock
[1:22:17] when you really realize
[1:22:19] that god has revealed to you the truth
[1:22:21] of the thing
[1:22:22] there's nothing in the world
[1:22:24] that's going to defeat you in it
[1:22:26] you're absolutely undefeatable
[1:22:30] you are absolutely undefeatable
[1:22:33] not you
[1:22:34] but the god that's in you
[1:22:38] jesus the body but the word that was in
[1:22:40] him not mary but the word that was born
[1:22:42] from her
[1:22:45] it's not this flesh that's undefeatable
[1:22:47] but it's what's on the inside of me that
[1:22:50] deposit that my father placed in me
[1:22:53] there's not a wind strong enough
[1:22:56] i think of the three hebrew children
[1:22:58] shadrach meshach bendigo
[1:23:00] and it was mandated by the government
[1:23:03] everyone would bow before this image
[1:23:07] or be burned
[1:23:08] in the fire
[1:23:10] king said whenever you hear a harp a
[1:23:12] horn a guitar what piano whatever any
[1:23:14] kind of instrument you hear when you
[1:23:16] hear that sound you are to bow your knee
[1:23:19] to this image
[1:23:21] and the prophet said it was actually an
[1:23:22] image of daniel the prophet
[1:23:26] i said now what are you boys going to do
[1:23:30] is it old king
[1:23:31] you blow all the horns you want to blow
[1:23:34] you pass all the mandates you want to
[1:23:36] pass
[1:23:37] we will not bow to the image
[1:23:41] some trust in chariots some trust in
[1:23:44] horses but we will remember the name of
[1:23:46] the lord our god my trust is not in my
[1:23:49] ability my trust is in the one who gave
[1:23:52] me the promise
[1:23:55] the name of the lord is a strong tower
[1:23:57] that the righteous run into and they
[1:24:00] are
[1:24:00] safe
[1:24:05] he said well we'll see what happens here
[1:24:07] you boys want to mess with us we'll show
[1:24:09] you who we are
[1:24:10] we'll test out this holy ghost religion
[1:24:12] you've got
[1:24:14] we'll see what it does i'll tell you
[1:24:15] what we're going to do we're going to
[1:24:16] burn it out of them
[1:24:21] i got news for the devil it's been tried
[1:24:23] many times
[1:24:25] amen you can't burn the holy ghost out
[1:24:28] of somebody you can't take fire and burn
[1:24:30] the holy ghost out of somebody it's fire
[1:24:32] itself
[1:24:34] [Applause]
[1:24:37] hallelujah
[1:24:38] hebrews 12 29 says our god is a
[1:24:41] consuming fire and the fire of god will
[1:24:45] consume anything that the devil tries to
[1:24:48] bring against his people
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:51] yes sir
[1:24:52] that's right they tried to pull it out
[1:24:53] of john
[1:24:54] couldn't boil it out of him in hot
[1:24:56] grease
[1:24:57] you can't boil it out you can't scare it
[1:24:59] out you can't run it out you can't stomp
[1:25:02] it out you can't put it out you can't
[1:25:04] blow it out
[1:25:06] it's here to stay there is no turning
[1:25:10] back
[1:25:12] so they heated up this furnace seven
[1:25:15] times hotter
[1:25:17] than ever before
[1:25:19] no king nebuchadnezzar you know
[1:25:22] this priestly robes and said we're gonna
[1:25:24] watch them now boys we're going to watch
[1:25:26] them scream
[1:25:27] and they're going to recant now or
[1:25:29] they're going to bow now
[1:25:32] hey boys give you one more chance before
[1:25:35] i put you in there you want to bow you
[1:25:37] want to come under this mandate that
[1:25:39] we're mandating to you
[1:25:44] no turning back
[1:25:47] i don't know what my god will do but
[1:25:49] there's one thing i do know he is able
[1:25:52] to do it
[1:25:59] think of this in their haste to burn
[1:26:02] god's people
[1:26:04] they killed their own people throwing
[1:26:05] them in the fire
[1:26:10] think of that satan oh god
[1:26:13] satan will destroy his old kingdom
[1:26:16] trying to destroy this bride
[1:26:18] but he will never do it
[1:26:22] all the fire did they threw them in the
[1:26:25] fire it killed the people that threw him
[1:26:27] in there and the only thing the fire did
[1:26:30] was loosen their bands so they could
[1:26:32] shake hands with the fourth man
[1:26:37] all it did was open up the bill
[1:26:40] oh
[1:26:42] all it did was open up an opportunity
[1:26:44] for fellowship and many times god will
[1:26:47] allow things to come into your life to
[1:26:49] open up an opportunity to show you how
[1:26:52] big he is
[1:26:57] [Applause]
[1:27:05] thank you lord i like that
[1:27:10] i think of the disciples
[1:27:12] out on the sea that night
[1:27:14] they were having
[1:27:15] a testimony service
[1:27:18] you know it'd be
[1:27:19] it'd be a lot better off if we testified
[1:27:21] about the goodness of god instead of
[1:27:23] complained
[1:27:26] about our problems that's right
[1:27:30] you get too many amens out of there but
[1:27:35] and satan thought
[1:27:36] that they were on their own because he
[1:27:38] didn't see jesus around
[1:27:40] but just remember just because you can't
[1:27:42] see him
[1:27:44] doesn't mean he ain't there
[1:27:49] put that right underneath that other one
[1:27:50] i told you to put on your fridge
[1:27:54] just because satan couldn't see him
[1:27:57] didn't mean he wasn't watching
[1:28:00] and satan said i'll drown the whole
[1:28:02] bunch i've got them right where i want
[1:28:04] them now i'll drown a whole bunch of
[1:28:06] them and he began to breathe and blow
[1:28:09] out of his nostrils the prophet said a
[1:28:10] great powerful wind of his poison breath
[1:28:13] and it hit the sea and the sea became a
[1:28:16] nervous prostration
[1:28:17] and he said and sin from satan will make
[1:28:20] anything have a nervous prostration
[1:28:22] and that's the reason we got so many
[1:28:24] nervous breakdowns and so much the
[1:28:26] insane institution that's filled up
[1:28:29] they're not in the institution no more
[1:28:30] they're running the government
[1:28:35] the world has gone insane
[1:28:39] i was in atlanta airport the other day
[1:28:40] and a guy come walking through the
[1:28:42] airport like this he had a robe from
[1:28:43] here to his to to the shoes was dragging
[1:28:46] the ground looked like count dracula
[1:28:49] wow
[1:28:50] i sent that to my wife look at this
[1:28:53] but the funny thing was the guy that was
[1:28:55] sitting over there with the ball cap
[1:29:01] people's going insane
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:08] and so he probably said sin from satan
[1:29:10] don't make anything have a nervous
[1:29:11] prostration that's the reason so many
[1:29:13] nervous breakdowns institutions filled
[1:29:14] up when people get to running through a
[1:29:16] 30 mile an hour zone 90 miles an hour
[1:29:20] squealing their tires and burning the
[1:29:21] rubber off of their tires turning
[1:29:23] corners
[1:29:24] and go 15 foot and turn off in front of
[1:29:26] you
[1:29:29] is that not the truth
[1:29:31] it happens all the time you think where
[1:29:33] in the world are you going right
[1:29:35] right
[1:29:36] like mcdonald's gonna run out of a
[1:29:37] cheeseburger or something
[1:29:40] it's insane
[1:29:43] people you can't even look at somebody
[1:29:44] in a red light you're afraid they're
[1:29:45] gonna shoot you over road rage insanity
[1:29:51] they're in a nervous neurotic state
[1:29:54] they don't know what to do and all the
[1:29:55] world is nervous and upset they don't
[1:29:57] know where they're standing they join
[1:29:58] one church and then they run to another
[1:29:59] church and let a little every little
[1:30:01] thing run in here and run in there
[1:30:02] running to and fro it's because that
[1:30:05] satan has begun to push out his poison
[1:30:07] breath he's beginning to blow his wind
[1:30:10] of strife breaking churches apart
[1:30:14] separating brotherhood
[1:30:16] making people think they're a little bit
[1:30:18] better than somebody else
[1:30:20] they belong to a better bracket
[1:30:24] they belong to a better church
[1:30:26] all tactics of satan
[1:30:29] to break our fellowship
[1:30:32] it didn't happen out there it's
[1:30:34] happening among our own
[1:30:36] ranks
[1:30:37] people are pulling come on friends
[1:30:39] they're dividing their self they're
[1:30:40] pulling themselves against preachers or
[1:30:41] tapes only and preachers and oh my what
[1:30:44] is it it's satan's poison breath trying
[1:30:46] to break up the brotherhood but he'll
[1:30:48] never stop this bride amen
[1:30:53] the prophet said there's only one church
[1:30:55] and that's the church of jesus christ
[1:30:57] she stands on the unveiling word of god
[1:31:02] and the winds got so contrary and the
[1:31:04] boat was all waterlogged full of water
[1:31:06] and the cells were torn and the oars
[1:31:08] were breaking and the great white caps
[1:31:09] the prophet of god said one place 20
[1:31:11] foot high just rose up and swept the
[1:31:13] little boat from one way to the other
[1:31:14] and all hope was gone and when all hope
[1:31:17] was gone after they was pressed from one
[1:31:19] wave to the other but jesus was sitting
[1:31:21] high up on the mountain and the prophet
[1:31:23] of god said he was watching them the
[1:31:25] whole time he watched satan begin to
[1:31:27] blow he lets the waves begin to rise he
[1:31:30] watched the cells tear and the oars
[1:31:32] broke and you know what he said no doubt
[1:31:34] he stood up and said i'll tell you right
[1:31:35] now it's going to take stronger wind
[1:31:37] than this
[1:31:41] and right in the midst of that great
[1:31:44] storm yes yes jesus come walking
[1:31:48] on the water
[1:31:50] amen
[1:31:52] maybe you're in a great storm right now
[1:31:54] friends i don't know maybe you're going
[1:31:55] through the hardest time of your life
[1:31:57] right now but listen to me do not focus
[1:31:59] on the storm
[1:32:01] focus on the one who walks on the waters
[1:32:05] he walks on the waters of our storms
[1:32:09] remember what peter said peter said lord
[1:32:11] if it's you bid me to come he said come
[1:32:14] and peter stepped out of the boat
[1:32:17] and started walking
[1:32:19] on the water
[1:32:20] himself
[1:32:22] as long as he looked at jesus
[1:32:25] as long as he looked at jesus as long as
[1:32:27] his focus was upon jesus the storm had
[1:32:30] no power over him
[1:32:34] but when he began to look at the wind
[1:32:37] and the waves when he got his eyes off
[1:32:39] the promise
[1:32:41] he began to sink
[1:32:44] listen to me friends no matter how
[1:32:45] strong the wind is no matter how much it
[1:32:48] blows keep your focus on christ
[1:32:51] stay
[1:32:52] with
[1:32:56] let me say this things are happening in
[1:32:57] this hour the sin of this age i want the
[1:32:59] devil to know it'll take a stronger wind
[1:33:02] than this
[1:33:04] because you see jesus said we're going
[1:33:07] to the other side
[1:33:08] yes
[1:33:09] did he not say that get in the boat
[1:33:10] we're going to go to the other then
[1:33:12] where are they going do the other side
[1:33:14] why he said so
[1:33:17] there ain't no way big enough they ain't
[1:33:18] nowhere strong enough to stop god's word
[1:33:21] from coming to pass no turning back
[1:33:24] satan ain't got to win he ain't got a
[1:33:26] plague he ain't got a storm he ain't got
[1:33:28] a fire he ain't got a trial that'll stop
[1:33:31] this bride oh hell cannot stop it it's
[1:33:34] ordained of jesus christ to be so and it
[1:33:37] will be so upon this rock i'll build my
[1:33:41] church and the gates of hell shall not
[1:33:44] prevail against her but she will prevail
[1:33:48] over them
[1:33:52] amen
[1:33:54] amen
[1:33:56] balak tried to get balaam
[1:33:58] to curse god's people
[1:34:03] but he couldn't turn them back
[1:34:06] israel had come this way there was no
[1:34:07] need to try to stop them because god
[1:34:10] doesn't promise them the land they were
[1:34:12] going over
[1:34:15] there's no need to try to stop defense i
[1:34:16] want the devil to know he will fail all
[1:34:19] his tactics will fail
[1:34:23] amen
[1:34:24] we are moving just the same we are going
[1:34:26] on just the same no
[1:34:29] turning back
[1:34:32] because i want you to know i want you to
[1:34:34] hurry i want you to know
[1:34:36] we are moving on
[1:34:38] but we are not alone
[1:34:42] we are never alone
[1:34:46] the bible says for he saith i will never
[1:34:48] leave thee
[1:34:49] nor
[1:34:50] forsake thee
[1:34:52] amen no matter what we go through we do
[1:34:54] not go through it alone
[1:34:58] jesus christ god's son who's the
[1:35:00] architect of the church he come to this
[1:35:01] earth and laid down the foundation when
[1:35:03] he met the devil he was tested by the
[1:35:05] word and he said it's written men shall
[1:35:07] not live by bread alone when he took him
[1:35:08] to the pinnacle of the temple he said
[1:35:10] it's written see the material look at
[1:35:12] the material he was putting in his
[1:35:14] church not emotion not sensation but
[1:35:17] thus saith the word of god the bride
[1:35:19] doesn't stand on emotion she doesn't
[1:35:21] stand on sensation she stands on the
[1:35:23] word of god the promise that he's given
[1:35:26] us will not fail us
[1:35:30] took him to the mountain and showed him
[1:35:32] all the great programs he could have he
[1:35:33] said it's written all the word of god
[1:35:35] was time tested he's the great captain
[1:35:37] that's going before us with his own
[1:35:38] bloody coat waving but to the redeemed
[1:35:40] brought by the blood of jesus christ he
[1:35:42] has bought a church by the holy spirit
[1:35:44] that's tested every boat and every
[1:35:46] person that's ever anchored in this
[1:35:48] great church of the living god it's a
[1:35:49] time-tested material
[1:35:54] amen david said
[1:35:57] whether shall i go from thy spirit
[1:36:00] or whether shall i flee from thy
[1:36:02] presence
[1:36:03] for thou earth to her
[1:36:05] if i ascend up into heaven
[1:36:07] the heart there if i make my bed in hell
[1:36:11] thou art there
[1:36:12] if i take the wings of the morning and
[1:36:14] dwell into the other most parts of the
[1:36:16] sea
[1:36:17] thou art there
[1:36:19] even thou shalt thou hand lead me and
[1:36:22] thy right hand shall hold me
[1:36:25] ain't you glad daddy's got to hold him
[1:36:31] with him on the mountain
[1:36:32] the heart there when i'm in a valley
[1:36:35] that worked there in the good times thou
[1:36:38] art there in the hard times thou art
[1:36:41] there
[1:36:42] in my joy thou art there in my sorrow
[1:36:45] thou art there in my despair thou art
[1:36:48] there when i'm shouting the church down
[1:36:50] thou art there
[1:36:52] when i feel lonely like there's no one
[1:36:54] else within a thousand miles of me thou
[1:36:57] art there
[1:36:59] yeah though i walk through the valley of
[1:37:01] the shadow of death thou art with me
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:15] the architect
[1:37:17] that made jesus what he was
[1:37:19] has made you what you are
[1:37:22] satan is defeated
[1:37:23] he knows he's on the earth he's going

[2:13:38] you're our friend that sticks closer
[2:13:40] than a
[2:13:42] brother lord i think of that
[2:13:47] footprints on the sands of time
[2:13:50] they looked back and they saw two sets
[2:13:52] and then all of a sudden they only went
[2:13:53] down to one set say what what happened
[2:13:55] the other person said well
[2:13:57] that was a time
[2:13:58] that he was carrying me
[2:14:02] oh god
[2:14:03] how we're so thankful lord
[2:14:05] like brother darrell gave that example
[2:14:07] lord with allie how he just he reached
[2:14:09] back lord with his hand and lord the
[2:14:12] fright that was on her face
[2:14:15] that she was placed on solid ground
[2:14:18] it turned to the biggest smile
[2:14:20] lord jesus how much more lord god that
[2:14:23] you're watching over us lord
[2:14:26] father in these times no wonder peter
[2:14:28] would write by inspiration of the holy
[2:14:30] spirit think it not strange
[2:14:33] for the fiery trial that's come to try
[2:14:36] you
[2:14:37] lord jesus so many wonderful reminders
[2:14:41] that you spoke to our hearts
[2:14:43] that the strong winds
[2:14:46] only come to vindicate the eagles
[2:14:49] a test or a trial
[2:14:51] it only comes to prove the real gold
[2:14:55] on the inside
[2:14:57] lord jesus
[2:15:00] we just lord as the prophet if she would
[2:15:02] ask lord
[2:15:04] and express that to us in that message
[2:15:06] three kinds of believers he said lord
[2:15:07] just give me the grace to go every
[2:15:09] through every trial
[2:15:12] go through every trial i think of lord
[2:15:14] when he was there i believe in the
[2:15:15] adoption series and he began to talk to
[2:15:18] his wife he said i just want to go on
[2:15:19] home i want to go on home and he said
[2:15:20] the voice just spoke back to him the
[2:15:22] lord spoke back to him and said are you
[2:15:24] trying to dodge things
[2:15:26] and he said forgive me lord
[2:15:29] lord jesus our flesh
[2:15:31] would love to dodge things
[2:15:34] we would love to lord
[2:15:36] but father
[2:15:38] we know that lord jesus there's not a
[2:15:40] test or trial there's nothing can come
[2:15:42] our way without you first permitting it
[2:15:45] the storms of life and what comes even
[2:15:47] lord times of gloom and things that
[2:15:48] comes i pray right now dear god may may
[2:15:52] a child of god
[2:15:53] not allow the enemy to turn that around

[2:15:56] somehow that's their fault that's an
[2:15:58] attack of the enemy lord and may they
[2:16:00] recognize lord god that just as you
[2:16:03] spoke in simplicity through brother
[2:16:04] daryl on the other side of that gloom
