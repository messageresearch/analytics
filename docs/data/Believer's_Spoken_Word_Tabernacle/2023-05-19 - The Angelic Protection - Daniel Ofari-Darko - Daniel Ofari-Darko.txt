Church of God to be saved to sin no more and that day when we got there before his presence who will tell our testimonies what I love about that the angels will look on us and do not understand the way we portray our joy with our great testimonies because what we have gone through they don't have that experience so they will park aside and you and I will sing praises and will live the name of our Lord amen and we are looking for that day beloved brothers and sisters God bless all of us greetings from your brethren from Ghana to all of you amen amen well tonight as usual when we gather around like this then we need to feed upon God's word Hallelujah because the bible say that all shall pass away by the word of God will abide forever greetings from Sister Rita to all of you mom he greet you Mr Rosa she greets you and all of you okay God bless you let's be on our feet instrumentalists and musicians thank you very much when I need you I'll call you again okay let's build on our feet for a word of Prayer gracious Lord we thank you once again this evening by Your Grace has found us in your presence thank you for taking care of us throughout the day but our going and our coming has all been your Mighty hands thank you Father for your protective wings now you spread over us thank you for supplying us with all our needs thank you for delivering us from all the traps of the enemy and Lord this evening also we have come into your presence by thy same Grace be with us O Lord as we are going to turn the pages of the scriptures father if you don't come on the scene it will be meaningless we pray therefore Lord Jesus Come into our midst and use me of father as instrument and let something come out for me Lord to be a blessing to your people Lord Jesus I pray that we will say Glory Be unto thy name for it's good that we have been here we thank you we bless you Lord in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen well let's uh turn our scriptures quickly to some psalm 34. amen Psalm 34 and we read verse 7 to 11. and then we'll read Psalm 27 as well let's take Psalm 34 first verse 7. the angel of the Lord encampered around about them that fear Him and deliberate them oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusted in him oh fear the lord hear his Saints for there is no word to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but did that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing Come Ye children he acting unto me I will teach you the fear of the Lord Psalm 27 10 verse 1 to 4. the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and fell though and hosts she will then come against me my heart shall not fear though War shall rise against me in this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in this Temple the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of his word amen let's take our seat tonight we want to speak on this topic the Angelic protection yeah many many times we have to be conscious of what God does in our lives not sometimes but always amen and we know that we are human beings but it is not our ability it's not anything that we do ourselves but always just the grace of God amen so we want to see tonight the Angelic protection now David here was saying something that the angel of the Lord encompet around about them that fear Him and deliver them meaning God is always around his people enjoy in trouble last time in a confused state God is always with his people to deliver them and they say oh taste and see that the Lord is good my he said taste it you must test it Hallelujah every one of us must test it it is your own taste not my taste your taste cannot be my taste and maintenance cannot be your taste Hallelujah we made taste of the same food right now if I order what food can I even mention right now at all right now and I say okay let our taste well our desk may call for more salt Others May say that oh no the salt is too much others may try to you know request for some cayenne pepper because it's not spicy like how I like it amen so it is your own taste not someone's taste because when you test it yourself then you can come out with testimony Hallelujah when you test it yourself when the situation arise you know how to stand he said taste he said oh taste and see the law is good blessed is the man that trusted in him oh no wonder no wonder that that day when the book of NASA was trying to you know put fear in the three Hebrew children that if they don't bow down to the image he was going to bend them up but what did the brother say they said King we are not careful to answer you this we know the god that we said will save you from your hands because they have tested and they know how God can deliver them from the hands of the book of days that's very famous they have already tested the Lord hallelujah so they know the ability they know the power of God they said we are not careful to answer your king but we assuring you we are not going to bow down to your image right Nebuchadnezzar said well if you will not bow down I'm going to ban you they heated the finance seven times and they threw this Brethren inside can you imagine the soldier that threw them into the fire their Flames came up and passed on them and they died and these three brothers were standing jumping in the fire and they were worshiping God Hallelujah nobody asked them to do that there's two because they have the taste of God already David said Test the Lord come and Test the Lord and thank God we have tested the Lord in this message of this hour and we know how sweet the Lord is oh Hallelujah and and also in the book of uh uh Psalm 27 in the seven he said the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear on this Earth behind the egg outside the Earth Whom Shall We Fear Hallelujah he said the Lord is the strength of my life or Whom Shall I be afraid when they're Wicked even my enemies and my foes came up upon me to eat of My Flesh they stumble and fell though and whole shouldn't come against me my heart shall not fear the world should Rise Against Me and this will I be confident and one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord today because of fear people end up protecting themselves falsely people go you know to to much for to see for magical powers to protect themselves because of fear now when you come politically we know that almost all Nations under this Earth are protecting themselves because they don't know what the future is going to be for them Every Nation UK is protecting herself Germany protecting herself United States protecting herself Germany Russia all the countries are protecting themselves because of fear and even Nations that are so poor that their citizens don't have food to eat when they get money instead of buying food they go and buy ammunitions and and you know all kind of thing because of fear they want to protect themselves but all those protections are vain there is no protection that's what passes the protections of God and that is the reason why the Bible said that the angel of the Lord encompassed around the people that fears here Hallelujah so your protections is nothing if Jesus Christ is not your protector amen now we know that in the Old Testament when the worshipers they worship under the blood in those days uh the high priest would go into the holiest of holies and whenever he goes there he is going to seek favor for the people because they need protection they need blessings they need healing they need security and that's the only source of their power and freedom of their Joy so the High Praise will go into the holies of holies with the blood of animals of course because he's going to meet the presence of God between the cherubims the angels of the Lord the moment the end he entered there with that ordinance then the place changed with the presence of God amen and he goes there with the bells ringing around the Hem of His garments because you cannot go into the presence of God silent that God to be noise over there Hallelujah and the best will be ringing here and there to signal that God has descended and so when it come on from the holness of holies he bring the peace of God upon the congregation he bring the blessings of God upon the congregation he brings the healings of God upon the congregation now as it was in those days under the blood of animal how much more you and I Hallelujah who are under the blood of Jesus Christ when the prophet said is the blood of God himself without no limitation perfect blood eight power has no beginning and has no end it has no expiry date amen that is why that sacrifice was done once and for all amen today he will tell you be careful the way that you treat this was because the angels are always beholding the face of my father your angel is always beholding the face of God that is why anybody ought to be careful about you Jesus himself said that now let's look to something here it come to a Time then Abraham called his servant his servant and told him that go into my country and look for a wife for my son Isaac because I don't want him to marry he said don't take any woman in this canal land I don't need that and there are no circumstance you a Believer marry an unbeliever so that thing was from the beginning Hallelujah he said don't marry any woman in this land go to my country and the servant said master what about if the woman is not willing to follow me here Abraham said the God that I worship he will send you an angel and the angel will guide your way Hallelujah and Yahweh will be prospered now when the servant got to the land he prayed a prayer he said oh Lord God of my master Abraham this is my mission I am here to take a wife of my master Isaac please bring me good speed the the dumpster that will arrive here and I'll ask give me water to drink and she will say I will give you and I'll give you that of your animal also let that be the wife of my master Isaac and the Bible says he barely finished with this prayer then Rebecca appeared Hallelujah and as she he prayed exactly it happened so to cut the short story he asked is there a room in your father's house he said yes then his brother Laban rush and met this man by the well and took him home they prepare a place for him now when you realize that God has blessed him he said well why don't you allow me to go with the woman please don't keep me here don't don't wake me he said no why why will we give you the woman just like that give us a course whereby we can allow the woman to go with you and the servant says something let's read it in Genesis chapter 24. Genesis chapter 24 and verse 37 and he said and my mustard made me swear saying Thou shalt not take a wife to my son or the daughters of the Canaanite that's 24 37. in Westland I dwell but thou shall go unto my father's house and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son and I said unto my master Pera Adventure the woman will not follow me and he said unto me the Lord before whom I walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shall take a while for my son of my Kindred and of my father's house amen so Abraham promised his servant that no matter their situation I know the God that I serve will send you an angel because that has been his experience throughout all his life the angel has spoken to him on several occasions and for that matter he knew that the angel will always be around his people so if I am sending you in the name of the Lord I know definitely that the Lord is going to send you an angel brother sister let us be conscious that God is always around us Amen in the name of his guiding angels let us be conscious of that and know what exactly we ought to do at all times amen now let's come to the life of Moses we all know what happened to him in the land of Egypt and he has to Escape run away from Egypt to the land of media he lived there for some time Prospect married brought forth songs and as it was he has a particular place that he always go and Grace the animals but one particular day it's the thing is always one day it is always one day that day something happened he saw unusual sin and it attracted him a bush burning with flames without the leaves being consumed he said let me turn around this and seek it well so when you turn then he heard his name mentioned Moses don't come further for where you are standing is the Holy Ground why was there a Holy Ground because the angel of the Lord was standing there and therefore remove thy Sanders and Moses obeyed the instructions now what Moses was running away from this Angel wants him to go back for it that is where the confusion came Moses said no no no no I can't I'm not ready to go you say you are going Hallelujah it's a lord if I go what am I going to tell the people the women ask me which God have sent me say when they ask you that question tell them I am I've sent you amen but let us see what he performed because Moses himself would doubt initially he said what is in your hand he says a rod cut it on the ground he cast it and he turned to a serpent and everybody's afraid of a serpent well those who have the courage to take serpent well I don't know I don't think I would do that anyway oh yes I don't think I would do that taking a serpent putting the serpent around my neck for what purpose now he said take it by the tail you see that is unusual God we are worshiping because nobody would take a snake by the tail you'll be dead but because the angel of the Lord was there and was instructing Moses the unusual thing will happen he said take it by the tail and he reached it and took it by the tail and 10 into the rod he said put your hand in your bottom we put it bring it out it was leprosy he said no no no no no he said put it back you put it again Bring It On he brought it say yes if they don't believe the first sign that I God have sent you do you believe the second sign and we don't know what happened brother sister when Moses was convinced that God have sent him indeed to deliver the people he went to back to Egypt and when they stood before pharaoh there were three oppositions in Egypt Moses was going to face he went to pharaoh that said the Lord let my people go if I don't say who is that God that iron Pharaoh the king of the whole world to allow his people to go and if Allah Israelites to go who do the work Moses I'm sorry a pharaoh demanded what's he said well you want to know that God Iran cast my rod on the on the ground he casted down and he tend to what's happened again and they were laughing you see they were laughing pharaoh and all the Egyptians in the palace were laughing at Moses why because they realized that as for days Janice and generous can do it better is a magical trick we have been doing it here always oh is that so yes we also know that Satan has always impersonated the way of the Lord right from the beginning and you can do to impersonate the work of God they call Janice and generous and they came up they also cast their rod they turn into serpents perhaps bigger than that of Moses amen and they were laughing Moses you see what we told you this is a magical trick but before they realize that of Moses raised it head and swallow the rod of Janice and swallow that off Jam race is that two so that was swallowed that day and the great was also swallowed Hallelujah and Moses picked his Rod back until today they are swallowed they did not know that Moses were not standing alone but the angel of the Lord was standing by Moses and that is what the world don't know about you beloved brothers and sisters maybe you yourself don't know but tonight I am telling you that there are angels around you so long as you remain the child of God oh wow amen and amen now look at Moses the man whom was sent to bring the people and you stand and you challenge him it means you don't know what you are doing that is why people should be very careful those who are challenging the message of this hour they should be very careful I'm giving them free advice I will not judge them Hallelujah they should be very careful brother sister because angels are on God well we all know what happened Pharaoh became so stubborn after all these things he still didn't want the Israelites to go till God struck the whole nation with pestilence and problems and templates troubles here and there right and at the long run you have to depart said Moses tell the Israelites to kill animals let them apply the blood as token for I'm going to send Death Angel to enter into the homes of the Egyptians when they come and you see the blood on your lentils they will pass over amen it's a sign of obedience it's a sign that you will agree to the Covenant that God have written failure to do that you are more than dead and they did it exactly and God with this power or by his power he pulled all these people out from Egypt but look at what happened after they left Egypt Pharaoh said what mistake have we done by allowing Israel to go no I've repented let's go back and bring them again let them come and continue with their liver because they have to work for us and they mounted up their army the Chariots the food soldiers thousands and thousands and thousands of them they pursue Israel and by that time Israel has also come face to face with the Red Sea and they didn't know what to do oh brother they were crying here and there asking Moses Moses are they're not grapes in Egypt and you have brought us here to die Moses and it's always Moses Hallelujah Moses didn't lead the way it was the way that the angel LED Moses that got them to that position and when they saw the Dust of the movement of pharaoh Chariot coming towards them oh my the agitation became so great they didn't know what to do Moses have you brought us here to die this is what we asked you that let us be peaceful in Egypt now look at what God did the bible say that while they were approaching Israel then the pillar of fire came and stood between the Egyptians and the Israelites oh my God and in the night it became a light to that of the Israelites and to the Egyptians it was Darkness can you imagine this who would perform this is only the god that we worship amen Exodus Exodus chapter 14. let's let's compare something there quickly and come back Exodus 14. and verse 18. okay and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I've gotten me honor upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his husband verse 19 and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to this so that the one came not near the other or the night who did that the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord and it came uh verse 21 okay and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong East Wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of Israel went into the Maze of the sea upon the dry ground Hallelujah and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the Egyptian pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all fellow horses his chariots and his Horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the horse of the Egyptian through the pillar of Fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians oh my yes sir God is still doing that God is looking to your enemy through the pillar of Fire and when God is looking through the pillar of fire for your sake against your enemy that you know what is going to happen victory victory victory oh Hallelujah I say Lord continue to look to my enemy through the pillar of Fire amen verse 25 and took off the acharya's wheels that they dread them heavily so that the Egyptians said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians and the Lord said unto Moses stretch out thy hand over the sea that the waters May Come Again upon the Egyptians upon their chariots and upon their Horsemen and Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea and the Sea returned to his strength when the morning appeared and the Egyptian fled against it and the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea all these things happen because God dispatched an angel to take care of them that same angel was the one that protected Moses when he was born as a baby a child Hallelujah and there was a decree by Pharaoh that all the children of the Jews should be should be killed but by faith the Bible said that by faith Hallelujah the mother and mother of Moses kept this child and they made they built a cat and played this child in and released this child on the River Nile and we all know that it is said that the Nile crocodiles are the biggest you know crocodiles one of the most biggest crocodiles in the whole world and they were all around the water and this boy or this baby crying to attract crocodile maybe they have eaten and they were looking for some dessert so that little baby could have been a better desert a good dessert for them but the angel of the Lord kept protecting this child and these are swarm this touch one this is swarm being between the crocodiles and none of them was able to catch it that it landed where Pharaoh's daughter was taking her shower and that was the saving point of Moses and that same engine the prophet said when you are born God give you that angel and that and you stay with you through life so it was that same engine that kept Moses from the crocodile now it was that same angel that said Moses bringing the Israelites from Egypt to the promised land oh brother we still have dangerous guidedness amen I said we'll still have Angels guiding us amen and amen and God told his people I am sending my angel before thee to guide and to protect thee for a very sweet communion but it is always bad amen God don't send his Angel to guide us that we should do whatever we want to do God don't send his angels to guide us and we think that okay we are the angel of the Lord guiding us so we can do anything whether good or bad no God don't appealed for that when God's son is angry to guide us it is for a purpose he wanted to remain in God's way that is the reason he wants us to remain in God's way that is the reason and so he said I am sending my angel before thee can we read that quickly also quickly Exodus chapter 23. Exodus chapter 23 verse verse 20. Exodus chapter 23. he said behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared beware of him and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him I am sending my angel before thee to keep thee in your way and to bring thee into the place which I God have prepared Hallelujah made him be very careful of that angel and obey his voice provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions today how many people are provoking the angel of the Lord amen you can provoke the angel of the Lord with your character you can provoke the angel of the Lord with your behavior you can provoke the angel of the Lord with what you do and what you ought not to do Hallelujah but you see there was a question here he said Beware because he will not pardon your transgression Hallelujah we remember this uh you know seditious enough personalities like like Dayton Korra and abiram when they stood against Moses and they were challenging Moses Moses you take too much upon yourself you think you are the only holy man amongst us why are you making yourself as your God on us they provoke the angel of the Lord right and you say Moses separate yourself from these people separate yourself from this unbelievers don't be on you call your it's a frosting but that is the truth it's still in that scripture and that scripture will never lose its power that's parody he said separate yourself from this unbelievers I will deal with them because they have provoked me then Moses was anointed that day and he stood before the congregation he said any of you who don't want to suffer destruction separate yourself from data Quran and abira as if it was a joke but when the angel of the Lord speaks it has to perform Moses came and stood before the congregation he said today you will know that it is not me but it is the Angel of the Lord if these people die a natural death then take me as a false prophet the bible say that Moses has barely finished his statements when the earth cliff the angel broke the Earth he opened the Earth and pushed this unbelievers in put all their family and everything that they had and you close it again you don't provoke the angel beloved brother sister God have given us position in him and that position it is not we fend for it it was given to us by his grace and the Lord has put us to honor that position the Lord expect us to be very careful of that position that he has given us the Lord expect us to do good to glorify his holy name by accepting his word not putting our own ideas because that don't help anyone your idea can be good for you but ask yourself when you bring it to the word where do you place that that is why you say let every man's word be a lie and let my be the truth Hallelujah it's about if thou shall indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thy enemies and an adversary unto thy adversaries for my angels shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the amorites and the hitters and the parasites and the Canaanites the hevice and the jebusites and I will cut them off those are not bow down to their doors not serve them nor do after their works but thou shall utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images and ye shall serve the Lord your God and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and now I will take sickness away from the midst of thee you see the conditions you see the benefits that surrounds obedience to God's word these are the benefits he said I will what I'll bless thy bread and thy water and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee there shall nothing cause they are young nor be Barren in thy land the number of thy days I will fulfill Hallelujah amen this is what God promised them and now let's listen to what the prophet said here I am I'm quoting from the guy he said the guide has understanding how to go and what to do God has always sent a guide to his people God has never failed he sends a guide but you've got to accept that guide that is the situation you go to accept that guide amen you see you've got to believe it you've got to go the way he says if you get into the Wilderness and your God say we go this way and yet you think you go that way you are going to come up lost then when God sends us a guide to guide us we've got to follow that guide no matter what we think what looks reasonable and what look ridiculous we are not subject to divide that the guide is the only one amen that God is the only one and thank God in this time of ours we have the guide no matter what you think you don't reason the word of God you only believe it is it that's the reason why today many people are throwing themselves of the dish from out of this message people that we knew people that were respected people that will cherish people that we we said amen when they were preaching the message of this hour today what do we hear it's a reasoning you don't reason you only believe amen you only believe the Angelic protection in the Book of Revelation Jesus Christ was showing John how the angels Hallelujah were placed in his hand in fact the prophet called Earthly angels they were placed in the right hand of God for the purpose of the seven Church ages and this were going to be the angels that were going to guide the people of God the bread of Jesus Christ if I without a guide you will not see the way without those Angelic guidance you will not know the way so God purposely revealed that Revelation to John Hallelujah and we realize that in the Revelation chapter 4 also there were four living creatures that the Bible said that they were surrounded the throne and one half the face like a a lion one have a face like a man and one have a face like an ox and the other one has a face like a flying eagle now these were established in the old time when God divided the armies of Israel into four parts you know they had four battalions one two three and four yeah and the first one we realized that it was done taking the north position in the East was Judah and their enzyme was a a lion okay in the West Was Ephraim and the Ironside was the first of mine and then when you come to the South it was Reuben and yeah and son was an ox and so when you bring it into our time of this end time these were the spirits that guided the bread of Jesus Christ what about the Antichrist move to cause commotion they call the bride to come up and see amen when the Antichrist jumped on a white horse with a ball without an arrow to deceive the world and everybody thought that it was Jesus Christ it was one of these angels that called The Bride which was John John come and see and John saw that if John didn't have that Angelic protection do you think he would have seen it Hallelujah and when the Antichrist realized that he has been exposed he went back without he came back with another color that time there was an angel also calling the Bride come and see he did it till when you got to the fourth time he has mixed all the colors and have gone colorless you don't see what it is the Bible call it pale and that was going to be the most deceptive age but the devil didn't know that that was a time God also released the angel that have the character of a flying eagle and nothing can be hit from the eagle as much as the Fly High the clearer he sees on the ground that is why in this end time beloved you and I we can never be deceived Jesus himself said that the elect cannot be deceived because we have a guardian angel that is guiding us oh Hallelujah and that is the reason why we have the power today to go to that to the throne and say give us the book we have authority now Hallelujah we have authority now they were guiding angels and today we see that is same inspiration guiding the book of Acts Matthew Mark Luke and John and praise be to the name of our God that we are the continuation of the Apostles amen remember Peter was imprisoned and Angel descended open the prison door he said Peter go back and stand on the street and preach the word you think God has not dispatched an angel around you you have them around you amen you have them around you Hallelujah amen now he said and then there was another Danger this little company just a young man and his little newly married wife he was talking about Joseph and Mary going along the road many robbers were in the land in those days um like Barabbas and so forth and what a parade that would have been to them to see just a little man walking along with a little woman to be a mother sitting on a little donkey and with a little stick in his hand for a group of wild mean men to write down and throw her off of there and do evil but you know if God is leading the way what difference does it make God will protect you to your destination there is no dangers when you are walking with the Lord oh can you say there is no dangers brother sister there is no dangers when you are walking with the Lord I will believe easily that there was a horse of Ten Thousand Angels walking along there with that man and that little donkey amen there's no danger if you're walking with the Lord Jesus evine this message of the hour there is no danger brother sister no matter where you found yourself one time when uh Elijah was in Samaria and he could see everything that happened in the king of serious bedroom and then he would tell the Israelites to be careful where they should go and where not to go and the king of Syria was so Furious thinking that he has some people in his own Camp revealing his secret to the Israelites and they told him a king don't think like that none of us will betray you but there is a map of God in Samaria his name is Elisha he is the one that's revealing your secret even though he doesn't come to your Palace they say yes sir all right so just Mount up go to Samaria go and ban uh Elijah and bring him here I will kill him today oh brother and the soldiers with their chariots with their I mean food soldiers thousands of them for one month cannot imagine for one man and they go to the place and when they surrounded the house of Elijah the seven so I said master he was calling on his master Elisha master we are finished the series have surrounded us and Elijah look at his servants it's all my servant be of Gucci for they those that are with us and more than what you see and he said Lord will you open the eye of my servant for you to see what has surrounded us and the Lord opened the eye of the servant and the servants saw angels not only with Charles but they were with Chariot of Fire oh Hallelujah and I've surrounded all over the mountains and amen and you know what happened this guy started jumping for joy because he realized that he had a security and when Jesus Christ is walking with you you have a security oh there is no cause for alarm there is no cause for fear the prophet said when you are walking with Jesus there is no danger oh hallelujah amen and amen and you know that Elisha blanded all the soldiers and he matched them up to the king of Israel these are my captives have brought them to you he said then let us kill all of them he said no don't do that give them food give them food you see you must do good to your enemy don't go to your enemy yes yeah don't say that that woman don't like me no that man don't like me no do good to them when they want it Jesus said when you do that you are heaping full of fire upon them vengeance is of the Lord Hallelujah Elijah said no don't kill them give them food give them Pizza give them hamburger give them ice cream let them enjoy and after let them go back and they did exactly so brother we are in the end time Hallelujah and as David said oh my I love that scripture let us read it let us read it again okay we are closing very soon let us read it oh brother um 27 Psalm 27 you can read with me psalm 27. you can read let me hear your voice okay let's read the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of my life or Whom Shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumble and they fell though and horse shoe and come against me my heart shall not fear though War should Rise Against Me In days will I be confident one thing Hallelujah amen this is a prayer of the believer oh Hallelujah and when you jump to that verse 11 he says what he said teach me the way teach me thy way oh Lord and Lead Me in a plain path because of my enemies Lord I want to be surrounded Always by your protection Lord without you I am nothing Lord I want to be under your Shadow at all times and the prophet said in them little fellows who could mistreat one of these by the way you should never do that you know Jesus said take heed that you dispatch not one of these little ones for their Angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven remember they have an angel when you are born he stays with you through life and now then when you get saved you have the Holy Spirit then and it guides you do you know that when Lazarus was he he was poor he has saw all over the body but did you know that that man had angels guiding him it doesn't matter whether you are poor or Rich evil a child of God you have an angel around you the bible say that when Lazarus died and just carried him to the bosom of Abraham where did they come from they were always around him they were always around him and when that rich man died he was buried so there is difference here brother sister take note of that not all the people are buried so when they live here Angels carried them straight and there are others who are buried and they go to hell and that was exactly what happened between Lazarus and this rich man I don't want to go into that story Hallelujah but you know it amen Hallelujah now let me call this okay and we'll close do you believe are you in a refuge you have a right to every privilege that God has if you are in there you believe that are you happy to be in this Refuge it's a question for all of us Hallelujah can you just sit back and let up the pressure say thanks be to God I finally made it I am here by the grace of God I am in the safety zone nothing can harm me now I am in a safety zone nothing can harm me now I am protected by the blood of Jesus Christ a company of angels are around me oh my God I feel good I felt good brother sister I say I feel good because I have confidence that whatever I go I don't go alone Hallelujah even in my troubles I don't go alone Hallelujah in my frustration I am not alone in my disappointment I am not alone in my joy I am not alone there are angels all around foreign there are angels all around last year let me share this testimony with you before I close last year there was a sister there is a sister in my church that was kidnapped by
