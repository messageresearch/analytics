bless this morning you'll be seated for just a few moments um I was asked to sing a song this morning I'll be seeing it here in just a moment um I don't know who asked that but I appreciate that I I don't uh I don't think of myself as a great singer maybe six out of ten maybe seven you know but uh I'm humbled that somebody would ask me um I do uh I do I'm always uh I'll just say it this way I love it when a plan comes together amen God has a way of doing things I was looking at my notes this morning and stuff and and then I looked at this I thought well this just ties in beautifully so it it's it's the mind of Christ and I just thank God for it and so I'll try my best um my throat's been a little raspy here the last couple days and so I had some hot coffee this morning and stuff and I know you're interested in my life story so I'll tell you this real quick um you know when I started out I actually started out song leading before I started preaching and I would get up and sing and I was just as nervous as could be and I've made such a fool of myself so many times now it doesn't bother me anymore but um um I would get up to sing and my throat would just close up like oh that's awful I can't hardly get anything out of my voice and so I would start I before I get up to song that I get this big cup of ice water first I start with the water fountain got some cold water and then I'd get a big cup and the more of this water I chug before I'd sing it the worse so again I just of course I'm an idiot I don't know nothing so um and so I went to a wedding one day and the brother's getting ready to sing and this other brothers tell me yeah his throat's been bothering he's been drinking hot water and tea all morning I'm like what's he doing that for he said well it opens up your throat I said oh I didn't know that I said yeah you never want to drink a much cold water before you sing all right you live and learn I guess so um so I made sure to do that here and so you you know you learn as you go on but anyway we'll try to sing this song this morning Lord help me and I I don't know I think we're gonna do it in a flat I don't know what you if you do it in something normally a flat I don't pray that well hopefully you know this one here we go amen pray the Lord bless you today as I kneel in the darkness in the middle of the night Lord I'm praying for Assurance everything's gonna be all right Lord I see another battle and it's out in front of me I'm afraid I won't be able and I'll go down in defeat but he said and do you remember it's where I brought you from won't you take a look behind you and see how far you've come and every time you ask me did it I deliver you so why would you be thinking that I wouldn't see you through [Music] it I calm the Raging Sea I spoke to the wind Hallelujah and it hushed and I gave you peace [Applause] I walked her right beside you just so you wouldn't fall and did it I leave all of Heavens just to die for your sins I searched until I found you and I do it all again now you're talking to the father as you kneel down on the floor Trials of this life lord well they've taken all my joy but you hear a voice so still hello he says I've moved like that before you know if you'd only surrender I would give you so much more and in it I walk on the water didn't it I calm the Raging Sea I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace [Music] call on the doctor right beside you just so you wouldn't fall and didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sins searched until I found you and I do it all again and now she's talking to her father in the middle of the night says my bills are coming to Lord and six days is not that long she hears a voice so still and low he says I've moved like that before and I'll do this little thing child and I'll give you so much more did it I walk on the water and I calm the Raging Sea I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace didn't I hear you when you called I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall and didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die before your sins I searched until I found you and I do it all again and did it I walk on the water and I calm the Raging Sea I spoke to the wind and it hushed and I gave you peace and I heard you where you called oh I walked right beside you just so you wouldn't fall and didn't I leave all of Heaven just to die for your sins searched until I found you and I do it all again oh thank you Jesus Oh Hallelujah he's worthy today just give him praise amen I made sure to lose the top button there before I started that one so praise the Lord no God is gracious I love that song it just has so much meaning because uh we've all been there and that's why we're here amen thank God for that amen we thank God for his grace and mercy if you have your Bibles this morning I invite you to stand with me for the reading of the word we're gonna look at the Nehemiah the sixth chapter Nehemiah the sixth chapter and before we read I just would like to ask you to Bow your heads with me as we look to the author of this word let's just pray gracious Heavenly Father you're worthy today we cried in our hearts Abba Father we thank you that you've been a father to us you're a father to the fatherless you're a you're a brother to those without a brother Lord when we were in our need when we were in that situation when our ship was sinking in the storms of life you were there for us Lord we didn't realize that the whole time you were in the ship but one day we heard an eagle Scream one day we had a revelation it was Christ in us the hope of glory and Lord your desire in each of Our Lives that you would be glorified and we just asked today Lord that we as we come and we submit ourselves to this purpose that you would indeed be glorified in each vessel here Lord we love you with all of our hearts and we just ask Lord that you would just be blessed in the midst of your people Lord you've done so much for us may we just give our our hearts and our attention now and and just punctuate your word with the amen and and believe with all of our hearts Lord everything you've done you've done for us you've been gracious to us and father I just ask now this scripture as it's read may you give inspiration May the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and understanding may it bless these people Lord maybe there's one today that's going through the storm of Life Lord it seems like many times we go from one trial to another trial but Lord You've ordained us to be changed from Glory unto glory and we're trusting as all things work together for our good that you would take preeminence in each situation here today and each life and that you would magnify Your Great Name to people that love you and they've submitted to you Lord without you we can do nothing but we're not without you today you promise to be with us you promised that if we would abide in you that you would bring these things to pass and we we confessed today and we believe for each believer here that we can do all things through Christ who strengthens us and now we just ask you to bless this word bless this time may you may you be a dissolver of doubts today may you answer the unanswered questions today may you lend strength to the weak today may you strengthen the weak hands may you confirm the feeble knees and following all these things we ask that you would come and do that which only you can do Lord you're a God that does the impossible and we believe you're for it now and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you Nehemiah the sixth chapter we're just going to read the the whole chapter so praise the Lord for that I am uh let's see here Nehemiah the sixth chapter I I probably make I probably make this statement every time but I really like the book of Nehemiah that's probably why I named my first child Nehemiah but um it's a really good book you should read it actually the whole thing's really good if you haven't read it so I'll praise the Lord uh Nehemiah the sixth chapter it says here and so um for those that are not familiar maybe just to catch us up real quick of course Nehemiah has returned to Jerusalem he's there to rebuild the walls he's gathered the people together and he's encountered some opposition and the opposition has been unsuccessful thus far in stopping the work so now they resort to the same thing the devil tries to resort to he knows he can't stop you so he just tries to scare you away from it so the end is going to try to put some fear in Nehemiah here and uh verse 1 here it says now it came to pass when sambala and tobiah and guess from the Arabian and the rest of our enemies heard that I had builted the wall and that there was no breach left therein though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates Sandlot and gesham sent unto me saying come let us meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono but they thought to do me mischief and I sent Messengers unto them saying I am doing a good a great work so that I cannot come down why should the work cease whilst I leave it and come down to you you gotta learn to prioritize amen I don't have time to argue with the Enemy I'm doing something really important you're doing something important right now hey man this is not our work this is a great work this is God's work we spend too much time fussing with the Enemy just tell me you know I ain't got time for this and nobody got time for that amen praise the Lord so he just just turns him down yet they sent unto me four times after this sort and notice what he does and I answered them after the same manner praise the Lord then since samblot his servant unto me in like matter the fifth time with an open letter in his hand wherein was written it is reported among the Heathen and gasmus saith that thou and the Jews think to Rebel for which cause thou buildest the wall that thou mayest be their King according to these words and thou Hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem saying there is a king in Judah and now it shall be reported to the king according to these words come now therefore and let us take counsel together then I said unto him saying there are no such things done as thou sayest but thou faintest them out of thine own heart just making it up and you know it notice for they all made us afraid saying their hands shall be weakened from the work that it be not done now therefore o God strengthen my hands in other words if he don't want me to do it I'm going to pray God helps me do it anymore hey man that's just how I feel about us how he felt about it amen afterward I came under the house of shamaya the son of Delia the son of Matthew who was shut up and he said so notice he's got somebody else now let us meet together in the house of God within the temple and let us shut the doors of the temple for they will come to slavey yay in the night will they come to slavery and I said praise God and I said should should such a man as I flee and who is it that being as I am would go into the temple to save his life I will not go in and lo I perceive that God had not sent him but that he pronounced this prophecy against me for tobiah and sambot had hired him there's the hireling amen therefore was he higher than I should be afraid and do so and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report that they might reproach me my God think that upon tobiah and Samba according to these their works and on the prophetess no diet and the rest of the prophets that would have put me in fear they would have that means they were unsuccessful praise the Lord notice now they're they're trying to scare fear-mongering it doesn't work verse 15 so the wall was finished Amen in the 20th and fifth day of the month ilu ilu in 15 two days and it came to pass when all our enemies heard thereof and all the Heathen that were about us saw these things they were much cast down in their own eyes for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God moreover in those days the Nobles of Judah sent many letters into tobiah and the letters of tobiah came unto them for there were many in Judas sworn unto him because he was the son-in-law of Shekinah the son of ARA and his son johanan had taken the daughter of Miss shulum the son of barakaya and they reported his Good Deeds before me and uttered my words to him and tobiah sent letters to put me in fear may the Lord bless their reading this word you may be seated so propaganda is not a new thing amen that stuff enemy's been doing that for thousands of years but you know what when you know where you're at in the Lord You're not moved by those things amen um I'd like to take for my thoughts today I'm trying to tie this all in together the herald of a greater world of course I preached a different couple parts about the greater world but I want to talk today about the herald of a greater world and as I start out here I I think it's important to go back to the beginning and look at what something we talk about a lot but uh you look at um the first uh book of the Bible in the first chapter you look at Genesis and and when God made man he made him for a great work amen he purposed them for a certain thing that he was to have dominion over the works of his hands he was to multiply and to replenish the Earth and God makes the decree let us make man in our own image after our own the likeness let him have dominion over the Earth and that brother Ram talks about this at length many different places he talks about his Revelation Series in 1961. he talks about it later when he's preaching the seals but he makes this point Adam he he knowingly and he willingly forfeits his right to life and his fellowship and his inheritance in the Bible tells us that through one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so Brother Bear makes the point it was Satan that held the keys of hell and death amen for for thousands of years he had the keys of hell and death but Satan never actually had dominion over the Earth or he never possessed what we would call the book of redemption why because only a man could take the book of redemption it wasn't ordained to be in the hands of a spirit or an angel and so when when man fell from his position of dominion brother Brown makes the point that book of redemption it goes back into the hands of the original owner amen so brother Brown makes the point that's no disregard to the angels Gabriel was maybe worthy or Michael but the Earth was never given to Angels it was given as part of the inheritance to men to you and I amen so that's why Satan could never take it it had to be a man that possessed it now Satan's not ignorant of this he understands that he can't possess it himself so this is the very reason he chooses to work through the agency of a serpent to engineer the fall of Man because he knew if he could inject himself into Humanity the one that was ordained to have the book if he can inject himself into humanity and keep them from possessing the book he doesn't have to possess the book himself he just has to stop man from possessing it as long as he can as he can stop man from possessing the book if he can stop God's promise from coming to pass that's as good as he needs so Satan knows he can't possess it but he's he's trying to stop man from taking it because remember in the beginning it was his desire not to usurp a kingdom but to set up his own kingdom he wanted his own kingdom he wanted to be like the the sons of the most high he wanted to set it up on the North Hill and do all these things so the brother Brian makes the point that uh you know Satan was almost co-equal with God and everything but as a creator and he actually makes the point in 1958 if if Satan was a Creator he would just go speak his own world in existence and go live on it so he he lacks this creative potential which by the way you have today remember that you have it it's in your tongue death and life are in the power of your tongue you can create an atmosphere you could actually go create a world if there wasn't a law of faith that was stopping you so God didn't ordained for us to go rule another world any more than he ordained for this world to belong to Satan he ordained this world for you to live in him and that's why he's not going to let you make another one or speak another one God said this is yours this is your inheritance this is your possession quit having a Wishful idea that I'm gonna go live somewhere in the buy and buy and I'm going to do this God has ordained us to rule and Reign on this Earth when you and I pass on if the Lord would tarry and we go to another dimension we're not just staying in heaven we're going to return one day to this earth not in the condition it's in now but a renovated Earth not the not a different love of clay but the same one done over the same one redeemed and a new heavens and a new Earth and that's where we're going to live we're going to abide with Christ in the New Jerusalem the Earth is going to push up and that City's gonna come down and Heaven and Earth unite and guess what you and I live at the very focal point of it amen because it was always God's purpose so Satan knowing this of course he he knows that they can influence the leadership of men a little squatter today actually if anything he's more of a squatter today because at least back then he had the keys of hell and death but he don't even have the keys of hell and death today Christ has descended Christ has defeated him Christ has humiliated him and made a show of him openly he is risen he led captivity captive and he today possesses the keys of death and hell and the grave so if anything seems even more powerless today before the believer amen that what was the work of God the the for this reason the Bible says was the son of God manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil knowing that Christ died and knowing that he rose he knows he cannot subvert the purpose of God so what's he gonna do he's going to do it here like Tobias sambla he's just going to try to make you afraid he's not going to tell you that it won't work out or that God didn't do these things or just say it's not for you because if you get you to be afraid if he can get you to disbelieve if he can get you to back down that's as good as he needs to do amen so he's just looking to stop you from realizing the work's already done amen you think about the Book of Revelation why was John weeping when he found that no one was worthy to take the book from the right hand of him that sat on the throne but the ramp says because the whole creation would have been lost so notice he doesn't have Satan doesn't have to get the book he just has to keep it out of your hand keep it out of the hands of man and this is why John is weeping if nobody can possess it that's as good as it Satan needs we're all defeated but thank God a voice and we're not John don't wait John it might look bad but I want you to recognize the lion of the tribe of Judah he hath prevailed to take the book and to open the book and to loose the seals thereof you don't have a reason to cry you might have had one but Christ come along and Christ has prevailed and Christ in you he has prevailed today this is our victory that overcomes the world even our faith God's not asking to suffer and die in the cross it didn't rise again you actually already did that in him by his Spirit that's in you you identified with him when he suffered you identified with him and he died but praise God you're identified when he rose again on the third day when he sat down and the Majesty on high he sat down at the right hand of God the Bible says you have been made to be seated with him in Heavenly places why am I so I say all this to make this point we look at the Book of Genesis in the original purpose of man and I make this point salvation is is peripheral to Redemption you say what do you mean by that what I mean by that is it was necessary for God to save men it was necessary for God to to to offer salvation to men and women but the purpose was Redemption amen it would be one thing just to save you from a certain fate or to save you from condemnation but he wants it to look like it was in the beginning because the whole order of the Earth has been distorted by the fall of Man so in order to restore or redeem the whole earth man must come back to his position he must come back to a place of dominion amen so salvation is a means to an end the end is redemption which is to bring back to the original condition in other words when you were in the pawn shop you you belonged to somebody before you were there and the one that you belonged to before is the one that come to buy you back listen you didn't belong to Satan in the first place he can't buy you back so when it comes along he tries to put a lien in your life say listen you can't serve God and you can't overcome you've got this problem and you've got this situation you come from this family you just remind him I didn't come from you in the first place I come from God and I'm going back to God this Earth didn't come from Satan it come from God and it's gone back to God it's going to be the way God wanted it amen so that means there's something in you that could be redeemed not everybody's got that Ram talks about it many places he talks about in the future home what was the difference between that that woman at the well oh my think about it now if she come to church today we'd be looking at her weird well shame on us amen that's God's daughter well listen she'd been married this many times and the man she's with now that's not her husband but you know what she had something the priest never had he might have sat under doctors he might have went to school he might have memorized the Bible but she had something he didn't have representation with God God looked at her before the foundation of the world said that's my daughter and no matter what situation she's in that was always my daughter and I'm gonna buy her back Satan's got no right to purchase her I'm the one that paid for it [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah she's got representation you if you're a son or daughter of God you're always represented in that amen what do you say his Spirit to you it identified you that's what you always were yeah you know the Lord really dealt with me about this when I was studying this you know God did all these things not just and I want to remind you this today God did all this not just out of an obligation his word now he is obligated to his word that's true but it's more than just obligation and then when Adam fell he should have come running for God he should have been looking for his father said father Where Art Thou but who was doing the running God wasn't sending angels God wasn't Meandering he wasn't saying well if I'd get killed if I've got time here come running brother Brandon said saying Adam Where Art Thou he was looking for Adam he wanted to find him it was him running for him and so I want to remind you I want to encourage you today that this whole Plan of Salvation that was done by God he's not just trying to finish his honeydew list he's not trying to cross off a check mark on the bucket list but you are the reason you are the purpose you were why he did everything it's a great love for you and I is what compelled him to run looking for Adam because you were in Adam when he fell but praise God you were in Christ when he rose we're no longer identified with that first Adam we're identified in Christ Jesus the first man Adam was a living soul but that last man he's a quickening spirit it's the power to bring out of the Grave it's the power to bring you out of sin it's the power to break Addiction in your life it's the power to heal the sick amen we didn't go looking for him he came looking for me praise the Lord I feel like singing again already amen he came looking for me he made a way when there was no way when your life wasn't just kind of bad you know when you were enemies of God in your mind you were alienated from God he come looking for you and maybe you run a little bit then even but you know what he chased you down anyway because God's got a plan when God makes a plan God sticks to the plan there's no plan being the kingdom there's no alternative if you're a son if you're a daughter of God God will not repent of that he will not change his mind about you it's settled in the heavens forever listen to The Very stars in the heavens testify of your purpose of your ordination listen I think I preached about this last time the architect but you brother M talks about The Clockwork of the heavens how everything was laid out in a certain place and the whole thing works we couldn't make a clock that perfect and listen if every one of those stars and their gravitational constant and every every every light and everything has a purpose how much more the Sons and Daughters of God the kingdom doesn't work without the people you're the people listen that's not being arrogant you're not taken from God let this mind be in Christ that was in Christ being you who didn't get a robbery we think we're world listen I'm trying to I don't want to Rob Glory from God you are the glory of God what is the glory of a man it's a woman his wife his bride for the glory of God on display in this age you're not taking anything from God he give it to you so when I say listen we can't have the kingdom without you I'm not saying that presumptuously I'm making a point if you're ordained it's part of that bride that elected body we can't do it without you this is all there is to it there you go so God's not looking just to save you or patch you up or put a Band-Aid on you he wants to bring you back to the original condition what's the original condition Adam spoke and it moved he could speak to waves if there was waves I don't know and then stop he could speak the mountains he could chuck him around whatever he's an amateur God so how is God going to do this you know it's interesting the answer is actually throws me how's that going to bring Redemption to pass well he made a promise to Abraham when he was still called Abram he said I'm going to call you Abraham you're going to be a father of Nations and in you Abraham the father of Nations All Nations will be blessed he made a promise to David and to his seat after him that they would Reign upon the Earth forever therefore the plan of God to exercise Dominion to bring restoration to bring Redemption was government oh my God I thought I'd get a few more listen we all do with the government the government and the government you make money the government shows up you pay money the government shows up you're born the government shows up you die the government shows up you buy property the government you sell property the government the government the government there's a problem how's this the solution well listen human government has failed thus far amen I'm not gonna get political on you but I mean I want to that's the problem then I said they will listen here well listen it's gonna fail no matter what some of it just fails a lot more epically than others some of it like falls out of the sky and some of it like blows up and catch some fire and falls into a Chasm and the train hits at the same time as a bomb and it's like wow just when you think that I don't know why I'm doing this now just when you think the government couldn't get any worse they surprise you every time praise God learn something new today that's in human government has failed because of the phone condition but this promised one the Seed of Abraham the seat of the seed and the son of David Isaiah prophesies about him he says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father the Prince of Peace I mean he's the Prince of Peace of the increase of his government and peace I'm gonna come to this idea of peace is the Prince of Peace amen of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of David and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment with Justice from his Force even forever the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this so there is a kind of government coming that will rain forever and it's a good kind we haven't seen it yet trust me and I've looked amen praise the Lord Hallelujah Brother Band says this the world falling apart or the falling apart of the world rather 1962. he said man's plans is falling apart God never offered us a Creed he never offered us a denomination I want somebody to show me in the Bible where he did I can show her you where he told you not to do it you show me where he said to do it you say well then brother Branham what did Jesus offer man a kingdom yeah hey man he's not just offering them redemption or salvation I'm going to save you he's offering it for the purpose of government for Redemption a kingdom that's what Jesus offered man a kingdom Hallelujah he and he is the king king of saints Lord of lords he offered us a kingdom not a politician denominational system but a kingdom pilate said are you the king of the Jews he said you said it he said if my kingdom was of this world my men would fight for me but my kingdom is of above right now I want you to think about this for a moment because all the prophets until John they preached of this coming Messiah they preached about this one that was to come Moses spoke about a prophet like unto them under Moses one that was going to be like him and all these prophets there are Heralds there are messengers of a coming Messiah but Jesus not the herald of his own coming amen he's not the herald this great one's going to come he's going to do this and that he's the one that's going to do it when he comes he's going to make his enemies his footstool so it's not until Christ comes that the kingdom is actually offered this government that Isaiah prophesied about the prophets could not offer it but the king of it the prince of it had to be the one to make the offer this Kingdom this government this rulership is what would usher in restoration or Redemption amen Luke 16 verse 16 the law and the prophets were until John since that time Hallelujah since that time the kingdom of God has preached and every man presseth into it so you don't get in the Kingdom by just uh you know signing up for a ticket or something it's not like a meal ticket you've got to press in you got to dig in a little bit amen there's something in you left that little Eagle in that egg or like a chicken or whatever you want there's something in you has to break out of the shell hey man if somebody does it for you it's not enough but God Knows by putting you in a situation you would gain the strength to overcome because you've got to press into this Kingdom amen amen so Jesus like I said he's not the herald of his own coming he's the herald of the Kingdom he's the herald of a greater World he's the herald of his own kingdom because it was necessary according to the word of God for Jesus to offer the kingdom unto the Jews first amen so this is the thing and this is where the Jews missed it he's not simply offering them a better alternative to Roman government well listen that's how the Romans do it but we're gonna do a better way well here's communism here's capitalism here no he's not offering just a better way he's offering the only way that actually works that produces Redemption amen they were looking for a political way they were looking to overthrow the Roman government they were looking to prop themselves up but Jesus didn't offer them that and when we look for that well we're going to be a better group of people we're going to be a better Church we're going to be a better class of people that's no different than what they look for no what he's looking for is a people that will give him the total preeminence and then he's not here today to endorse you because you supported his campaign he's not here today to you know hook you up with some insider trading because you believe in his campaign you work for his campaign no he's looking for a people that will submit 100 to him because that's the only kind of rulership that Redemption can produce amen his by offering this Kingdom he is offering them the issuing in of all things that pertain to Redemption amen you know Jesus talks about the uh the parable of the vineyard the vine dresser are you familiar with this Parable Jesus said there's a certain Vineyard and a husbandman let it out and uh and people took it over and they were working at it and stuff so he sent Messengers he said Harold he said prophets and they they would beat him out and throw them out and this and that and finally the husband says I know what I do I'll send him my son I'll send them the air surely they'll respect him and when that air got there they said this is the man's Heir let's kill him and then we'll take it and Jesus asked the question he says well what do you suppose they'll do what are you supposed to husband's going to do when they kill the son he said well he'll he'll utterly destroy those men they didn't know they were talking about themselves they'll utterly destroy these men and he'll set up new Vine dresses he'll set up new people over here thou has said it hey man in other words what you're saying it had to be offered to you but since you've rejected God Jesus says it's going to be given to a nation it's the Greek word ethos it's a people it's not actually America or Italy or whatever a people a nation can I say it this way a holy nation a chosen people a royal priesthood our government is not a certain government of man we are ruled our headquarters is in heaven and our Sovereign is the Lord Jesus Christ the one they rejected and let me remind you as Paul remind you God in his wisdom allowed blindness to happen to them so it wasn't just that you were smarter than them but God allowed blindness to happen to them that you and I would have this Grand opportunity that we have to be here today because if they had received it that would have been the end that would have been Redemption and so I hope that hits home for you just a little bit today that those people were blinded so you and I could believe this message today so you and I would have this opportunity amen God got a lot of people to go my think about this God a lot of people to be in captivity and to suffer and to be oppressed and go through a holocaust all the horrible things that have happened this people but he allowed it not only to bless them but for you and I so when you sit there and think well does God really love me look at what he allowed people to go through look what he let his son go through for you and I I can't have the kingdom without you because you're Kings and Priests unto God you have a part you're listen if if Christ is the air your joy airs with Christ so he can no more have it without you than he could with Christ because you are part of the inheritance that Adam lost Christ has received it he's got a more excellent Name than the Angels today amen so the nations were blinded so we could have this this blessedness of the Gospel amen you know we just got through the uh the holiday season I tell you what what praise the Lord I went to church here I don't know why I'm telling this story I'm gonna get myself in trouble went to church here a while back and uh I I was my one of my first times preached there and we got done afterwards I was talking about how I bought my daughter a BB gun here a while back and I said yeah I got it for for Christmas and because I said I thought oh boy and to be fair to actually I got it like in November but I just said it I'm like oh man oh that's a problem well Merry Christmas well the brother laughed at me and he had a problem with it so hope you forgive me but anyway I just bought it for because I liked it but we know we we celebrated this season and you know uh I think about it because the very night Jesus was born which wasn't December because it would have froze but uh the very night Jesus is born there were some Shepherds out in the country I think I preached about a while back but these Shepherds they're out there and the angels of God appear one night and I see fear not for I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people not just you and I but all people not just the Jews that were there that's that was the thinking of the Jews well he's here to bless the Jews no he's here for Good Tidings for all people all nations see the Heavenly Host is testifying what is coming out to his heralding and then the host appear they say glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward men now this heavenly host now I'm saying this for a reason they did not declare there would be peace on Earth because people that take it in the holiday season the U.N they take it say oh listen there's going to be peace on Earth that's not exactly what they said they said on Earth peace you say What's the difference brother well this is what it is they're saying on Earth there's gonna be peace not that the whole earth is going to have it necessarily amen they were not testifying that now on the whole earth there'd Never Be Another War there'll never be another disagreement there'd never be another problem they weren't testifying that men were going to achieve this peace on their own but what they're saying is on Earth there is now a means of peace in other words God is now offering peace it's not the peace between nations it's not the peace between family members or churches it's the peace between God and Men because that's the thing they'll act amen now on Earth God is offering peace or an olive Rich by Christ that's what the Kingdom's about amen so it's peace between God and man he's the Prince of Peace So what is it that's why I'm coming to if he's the herald if he's heralding a government why what's he The Herald of peace shalom in other words the the messenger has come to offer you something you didn't have peace with God because that's what you needed you say well I've got this problem I've got this in my past what you need is peace with God because when you make peace with God you can make peace with yourself you can make peace with your past you can make peace with your enemies amen because until you have peace between you and God you'll never achieve lasting peace anywhere else amen praise the Lord Romans 10 the Apostle Paul says how then shall they call on him and whom they've not believed and how should they believe in him and whom they've not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things the same thing the Angels talked about the gospel of peace how beautiful are the feet amen he's quoting Isaiah says how beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings that publishes peace that brings Good Tidings of good that publishes salvation so the gospel is peace to them that receive it that's why them that carry it their feet are beautiful perhaps you didn't know this about me I've got really pretty feet I I once considered a career I was gonna model my feet but I thought it wouldn't be modest so no I've got pretty feet now honestly if you look at them they look like like whales they're swollen or something but bubble says they're pretty you say why does it say they're beautiful they're not beautiful Aesthetics of it I'll just probably need to clean something up down there little hairy they're beautiful because of what they represent when you see these feet coming and they're carrying Good Tidings of Peace that's what makes it beautiful is what it represents so I'll just save you the trouble of rubbing my feet hey man they're not pretty because of how they look they're pretty because of what they represent the gospel is peace amen Christ is peace he brought peace but he is peace the book of Ephesians says he is our peace who has made us both one and has broken down the middle wall of partitioned between us having abolished in his flesh the enemy enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make it himself of Twain one new man so making peace so he is peace and then he makes peace and that he might reconcile both unto God and one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby and came and preached peace to the to you which were afar off into them that were nigh so he is peace he makes peace he preaches peace says all things peace it's shalom that's why brother random says when the light of this day the light of his hour shine upon this church this bright in the last days it was Shalom to you he said it's a new year he said if if you don't have the word it's a bad year you say a house is 2023 going to be as bad as 2020 or 2021 or 2022. well it depends on who you are right and then if you're without Christ it's the worst year yet I can about guarantee now you're sitting there going I didn't think it'd get any worse oh yeah that's one thing about us as human beings we think we've made a big mistake out of things we've messed it up we just find a way to make it worse well praise the Lord a couple of us are on us here amen that's the truth hey man but listen if you have seen the light of this message he said it's a good year for you you're going to have a good year it's shalom it's peace for you it's not the piece that you can go buy at a store it's not the peace that men try to find at a bar or in a needle amen it's the peace between you and God only God could give it if God give it no man can take it from you hey man we try to let everything take our peace if God give it to you no man can take it from you he come and preach peace listen he that's what he did with his own disciples and when he raised from the dead the Bible talks about them on the road to Emmaus and how they saw him and the scripture says they told what things were done in the way and how he was known to them and breaking of the bread I believe we live in a day like that amen I believe the word's been open to us I believe we've had a road to amaze experience we we thought it was William Branham we just thought was another preacher but it was Christ veiled behind the man not that William branham's Christ but he was hid behind that Ministry and when our eyes were open we recognized it was Christ in our midst that was doing these things and these men they testified the same thing and it says as they thou spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them to them peace be unto you John 20 then the same day evening being the first day of the week as here we are amen when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews then came Jesus and stood in the midst of them in the midst rather and saith unto them peace be unto you verse 20 and when he had so said he showed them his hands and his side then where the disciples glad when they saw the Lord then Jesus says to them again peace peace be unto you as my father hath sent me even so send I you verse 26 after eight days again his disciples were with him and Thomas with them then came Jesus the door is being shot and stood in the midst and said Peace listen here he opens this way every time peace be unto you why because I had a lot of reasons to be afraid they had a lot of reasons not do not have peace but he said I'm going to give you one to have peace Because I Said So peace be unto you why has he appeared to them so they would have peace why did the message appear to us in this day peace be unto you shalom it's breaking day don't be afraid don't fear my peace I give to you not as the word gives so I give listen in this world you're gonna have tribulation I I think one of the biggest things that people do as a Christian a big disservice brother Brown says you know we paint it real smooth like it's always going to be Joy it's always going to be happy but listen you're going to go through trials you already have amen give me a show of hands anybody been through a trial you ought to praise God listen you've got strength in your body you can testify I've been through trials but you know what he's brought me through trials you're gonna have trouble but fear not I've overcome the world that's why you can have peace listen he wanted to give Jerusalem peace the Bible says praying for the Peace of Jerusalem that's him he's the one they're not gonna have peace until he's there he is the desire of Nations and he wanted to give that he said I would have gathered you he offered them peace but they rejected it but he's offered us the same thing why because he's the herald of our greater world he performed a sign before them and the purpose of that sign was to offer that people peace and in this generation in this age we've seen the same thing on display we knew who Melchizedek was back there but who was this Melchizedek in this hour it was the Lord Jesus Christ the son of man doing the same thing offering to a people one last time I would have gathered you if you'd come out of denominations it could come out of your own thinking I would have gathered you but you would not but praise God there's a people Ashland had a resurrection out of dirt denomination there were some disciples gathered together and when he showed up to you it wasn't to invite you he indicted the world but to you he says shalom God's peace be upon you I'm not ordained you to be condemned I have ordained you for peace [Applause] the prophet says now we see when God gives a man an invitation and to do something or to receive that invitation that he's given he returns it down then there's nothing left after Mercy is spurned but judgment if you step over the boundaries of Mercy there's only one thing left and that's judgment that's the world today amen but that's not you and I today amen God spoke something to ah listen God declared his intention in an indictment but he declared his intention to you and I peace is my intent in case you weren't sure in case you weren't certain I want you to know why this message come to you and I peace now you might not have realized it but that's what it was about getting didn't realize it either the Book of Judges the book talk the Bible talks about Gideon he was there hiding behind the wine press he was the least of his father's house and the angel of the Lord shows up to him and the angel Lord says get in you're a mighty man of Valor here he is hiding now Gideon saw the angel of the lord I want you to remember this when he saw the angel of the Lord he despaired he said alas O Lord God for I have because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face he thought the Angels showed up I'm gonna die oh the angel of gods appeared to us in this generation we're all done for but the Lord said unto him peace be unto you peace be unto you fear not Thou shalt not die praise the Lord I tell you what I don't care what happens if 50 years go by and you hear one day brother Alex passed away he went on and died don't you believe him and I'm not dead I'm just somewhere else and then I shall not die but I shall live to declare the works of the Lord this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes if you live and believe that he that believeth on me though he were dead yet shall he live and if you live and you believe in this word he shall never die you shall not die you're not here to perish under the hands of midianites the angel of the Lord appeared to you not for your destruction but to tell you peace [Applause] I love this thing getting built an altar there into the Lord and called it Jehovah shalom it's one of us redempting Jehovah Shalom what made him Jehovah Shalom when a man thought he was going to die God said no I've come for peace that's what makes him Jehovah Shalom God's purpose when you deserve to die when you octave that when you feared death God said no you misunderstood I've come for peace not peace with the midianites I'm here to give peace with you be at peace I'm not here to make terms with the midianites I'm not here to negotiate I'm here to give you peace I'm here to give them trouble amen you say how can he be Jehovah Shalom if a people reject him and he's our peace one simply needs to look at the terms that he offers hey man see he's come to make a deal amen the Bible tells you about I said the stone this rock he said if you fall on this rock you'll be broken but if this rock falls on you you will be ground into dust he's going to ground The Rock and The Rock's gonna ground its enemies into dust hey man so here's his terms you can either surrender to me or I can defeat you hey man he's going to have peace even if he has to make it himself amen you know I I love this uh in the Bible I believe it's in second Samuel chapter seven I guess I should have wrote it down but I believe it's in second Samuel chapter seven you know the Bible talks about David when he had peace from all his enemies he had rest from all of his enemies and I think I mentioned this a while back but you know the reason he had rest from all his enemies is because he beat them all up and then he didn't sit there and negotiate my paperwork he defeated them all they come out against him and he beat him and more coming against him he went behind some trees and the mulberry bushes began to move and he defeated them he beats them off that's why nobody wants to fight him hey man praise God did you kill him we're on fire for that one amen praise the Lord we're not here today to negotiate we're gonna win we're gonna have peace one way or the other the world's not going to give it to you but you might be able to take it away from them well praise the Lord somebody listen David had peace through Supremacy the Bible tells us Christ he's going to come back with tens of thousands time ten thousands of his Saints that's us that's you and I what's he coming back to do to execute judgment on all the ungodly for their ungodly Deeds which they have ungodly commanded he's coming to subjugate anything that won't submit to him so this is the blessing of the Gospel but it's also the consequences of rejecting it and this is why Paul says that you and I we are ambassadors for Christ for the ram says if you're an ambassador from Heaven All Heavens is behind you and Heaven is consistent of the word amen praise the Lord that's why I said earlier our headquarters brother Ram says it is in heaven I know some people differ on that they think this certain place in Indiana is their headquarters or this certain Church my headquarters can't speak for anybody else my orders come from heaven amen here's my orders right here that's all I need if a man don't like it if a man don't agree with it that's on him amen but this is my peace offering right here Christ was a peace offering for you and I listen I love you all I love listen I love people I'm not real maybe the best shown it sometimes but I love people amen but listen not a one you died for my sins I didn't die for yours amen you are loyalty to one man the man Christ Jesus there's your peace there's your joy there's your Redemption [Music] in this age he offered a pardon remember pardon's not a pardon unless it's received as a pardon it's only peace as you if you receive it as peace that's up to you he offered pardon through this message why because the church is no longer his voice it's no longer his mouthpiece in other words the church was no longer a Herald of his coming which is ironic because brother Ram talks about that that publication The Herald is coming listen he's not coming he is coming but spiritually he's here that's what the message come to identify he's here now declaring himself it's not just that he's coming he has come through the full revelation of the word today and what was it it was peace to us so if you're troubling today I want to remind you the message didn't come to give you trouble some people get trouble when they hear the message I don't I think praise God that's for me that's my peace that's what settles me when when people rise against you when you've got sickness in your body when you don't know how you're going to pay the bills that's where my peace comes from it's not a bunch of zeros at the end of my bank account it's not that I jog 12 miles a day which I don't so that I'm in the best health or I you know I'm popular my peace your peace is in Christ because those things come and those things go but this Prince of Peace of his government of his peace there is no end [Applause] God come and spoke to Gideon getting looked like a coward look like a listen Gideon looked like the least of his father's house but God said no there's a mighty man of Valor listen let me say it this way that's a dangerous man it's a dangerous man wonders God's up there see that guy right there the dangerous fella be careful how you walk around him I preached a sermon on a while back I'm not going to preach it here today but he's listen giving himself doesn't realize how dangerous he is hey man think about that now listen when Jesus is in Simon the Pharisees house and they've got him shoved in the corner and some woman's washes feet and they're sitting there ridiculed that that was a dangerous man they didn't realize it that's not a man you want to trifle with that's not a man you want to mock that's the most dangerous man in Jerusalem that's the most dangerous man in Israel let's go hey man I'm saying something now listen if Christ is in you today then you are the most dangerous people in Sheffield you're not the weakest you're not the squishiest you're a dangerous people maybe you don't realize it maybe you like getting you think well I can't do nothing for God I ain't got no ability I ain't got no virtue listen you're a dangerous people because the same Stone of a fence that destroyed Nations is in you and God is literally judging people based on how they treat you think about that now I'm not saying that presumptuous that's the scripture but they blast you their blast if they curse you guess what yeah listen you're a dangerous people you're the most dangerous people in Sheffield Ohio you're more dangerous than gangs you're more dangerous than police you're more dangerous than governments you are don't hide behind the wine press now amen this crisis not like other men this Christ in you he's not like other men he's not a man to be trifled with you're not a people to be trifled with you are dangerous people why because God spoke peace to you God's Gonna preserve peace for you no matter the cost if he's gonna if he's gonna you sir if he's gonna not you serve if he's gotta assert dominion over everything else to give you peace he'll do it because he made a promise to you for peace brother Graham says now to you predestinated seed Shalom God's peace rests upon you because we're near the end now see how do I know we're near the end now we're right down near the end he says we're living in a wonderful time Shalom to you have the word down in your heart chose before the foundation of the world to hear the word for this day if you don't it's a bad year for you ahead if you are it's a great world not just a good year you got a great world ahead of you it's a greater world great world for you ahead a great day a great year coming new year Shalom God's peace be light upon you and when God's word is Vindicated in this age completely and you see it and believe it Shalom to you yeah amen the Bible says Colossians chapter 3 let the peace of God not just God let the peace of God rule in your hearts amen I make this point often uh I want to I want to bring it down with us I want you to really meditate on this let the peace of God rule in your heart that means you have to allow it brother I just I don't I don't have the peace I want to have as a Christian I wish I had a greater peace you have to allow it hey man sometimes we're the ones keeping it from ruling amen you must open up and allow him to rule because he's the Prince of Peace hey man the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus remember the thoughts that God has about you are not like other men's thoughts they're not like your own thoughts God says the thoughts I know the thoughts well God do you think this about me no I know what I think about you thanks it's funny that God's like you know what I know my own thoughts you don't even know your own half the time you think you know mine I know the thoughts I have doesn't matter what you say I'm not I have for you I know the thoughts I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace not of evil hello do you know is the question he knows he's not undecided about you today hey man he's not sitting there going well you know maybe I'll give him peace tomorrow maybe I'll feel differently about tomorrow I know he says and now I'm telling you I know my thoughts they're for peace and not for evil for an expected end amen so it's like I said earlier to reject it it's to reject reject peace to reject his word is to reject peace Brother bam time and time again you hear him on the tape we live in a neurotic age why is it so bad what happened they rejected peace 1956 they rejected the gospel it was peace we look at the world today we say how can it be so bad I would be shocked if it wasn't because they rejected the only peace that they could ever find it has to happen but it doesn't mean it has to happen to you and I amen if you receive him he will subjugate all your troubles he will enforce peace in your life it's like I said last time listen he excels at taking chaos and bringing it into order amen if your Life's a situation and everything's going haywire he'll come in and sort it out amen amen that's the problem we try to sort it out quit trying to do it he's the Prince of Peace let him do it allow him to do it amen because God is he's good at it amen doesn't matter what the chaos is in your life sickness poverty nervousness and the Bible says that he's going to rule the nations with a rod of iron amen if they rise up he'll Dash them with a rod like The Potter's vessel listen if you can rule the Nations what can you do in your life you believe he's going to rule the Nations do you believe of his peace and his Reign there's going to be no air doesn't even rule the Nations he can handle what you're dealing with today whatever you're going through lesson you're worth more than the grass which is cut down and burned tomorrow you're worth more than many sparrows amen you're worth ten thousand worlds to him if he can rule the Nations he can do it in your life let him allow him to do what you can't quit trying to manufacture your own peace let him do it brother man tells the story I love it he said he was car he was in Carlsbad New Mexico one day and he was in this cave they had a big old bat Den down there and all these bats were hanging around in there and he said it was spooky looking we got down there and this man he he gets down there the guy and he shuts the light off and there's a little girl and her her brother there and she starts to get scared milligrams so that's just about the way the times are getting when you see the church that fails to recognize God's word when you see our daughters of Zion going the way they're doing when you see our brothers that smokes and drinks and tells dirty jokes and things and still trying to hold their confession in Christ oh my it's dark it's pitch dark we see the sign of his coming It's always darkest just before the day then the Morning Star comes out to Hell the day and to Herald it to show its coming notice he said when they turn that light off that little girl she screamed to the top of her voice maybe you feel that way sometimes straight to give up just read a crown despair hey man let that little boy stand by the guy he's seen that guy switch the light off he looked at his sister she's having a fit she was screaming going up and down oh what's gonna happen next what's the matter what's the matter you know what he screamed he said Don't Fear little sister there's a man here turn on the light [Music] I don't know what each one of you is dealing with today but maybe you're like this little girl let me be that one like that boy to remind you there's a man standing right here and maybe he's not a million miles away he's just a few feet away listen he's as close as you'll let him be if you allow him if you let him come in listen the Bible says the words nigh you it's in your mouth it's in your heart he's as far or he's as close as you let him be let me testify there's a man here today right now in Sheffield Ohio there's a man here in your heart he can turn on the light he's come to Herald a greater world and he's here to turn on the light amen that light is your shalom that life dissolves the darkness and pushes back the darkness he said listen little sister you might think we're small and in a minority but don't fear there's a man here who can turn on the lights one brother's like I don't know if you're gonna get back to Nehemiah I'm here I got it okay it's under control thank God don't be tossed to and fro Nehemiah in the Bible that we read He Walked on heedless of the threats of his enemies he was not deterred from his purpose he was not moved to the left to the right he was not tossed by discouraging words he was not moved about by negative circumstances amen he was unmoved by gangsters because Nehemiah didn't look at what his enemy said let me just give this to you for a second Nehemiah wasn't looking at their words on the paper or what they said he was looking at their attention hey man don't look at a person's words people can say anything what was the intention behind it amen he didn't say oh we're all going to die and listen they're trying to help me out why are they saying that they're saying it because they want me to stop God doesn't want me to stop God wants me to go on therefore why should I value their opinion hey man they are wanting me to stop so I'm going to press on Amen they start spreading rumors you're trying to make yourself a king you're trying to take over you just want to position Nehemiah you just think you're special and listen Nehemiah like I said earlier he doesn't waste time trying to prove him wrong because it's not up to them anyway listen I know that the Bible said this in the message said this but this person says that some mommy thinks this about me and Daddy thinks this about me listen it doesn't matter what anybody says it matters what God is saying Nehemiah understood God put him there God ordinated for a great work you're ordained for a great work the work in your life is greater than just you the kingdom that you and I are a part of it's greater than just you it doesn't survive or fall just based on you the god that we serve is greater if you stay in the purpose of God it doesn't matter what anybody else says about it don't be moved by circumstances I love it they try to get him to hide in the temple hide a church let's just come out here listen to him either coming to kill you you just hide here you can you can do your job listen you can be a Christian here at church and just stay here and that's fine you don't have to go out you don't have to live that kind of a testimony anywhere else just just stay here keep your Christianity in this poor wall building and you'll be saved they might not like you out there if you go out there and I'll love his answer should a man like me flee what kind of person you take me for what kind of man do you think should a man should have people like you and I should have people like this flee we're gonna hide our lamp under a bushel yeah I love it amen who do you take me for who do you take this people for this is the most dangerous people on the face of the Earth listen when trouble troubles them they trouble trouble don't like coming their way because when Trouble Comes their way trouble comes out one way and it flees seven trouble don't like messing with the bride of Christ amen because the more you trouble the bride the more they just rise up they ordained to rise above every circumstance every storm and your Eagle wings they're more than sufficient when when When Storms Come and Trouble Comes you're built to fly over it I'm not fleeing from that I'll go right into it if that's where God leaves me I'll go right into it because I'm built to handle the pressure you're built to handle the pressure you might not think getting didn't think he was built for it he was built by God for the job Nehemiah was built by God this bride is built by God for the job amen I will not allow you will not allow fear to make your decisions I will not allow circumstances to change my possession if things move if things move me or whatever listen if circumstances and fear and feelings move you that's your leadership that's your God that's your leadership amen but if you allow him to rule then those things don't make your decisions anymore Christ makes your decisions listen if you let circumstance chances dictate what you do that's your Idol you've made it an idol well these people said this about me so I'm going to do this so that's your God that's your leadership fear makes your decisions brothers and sisters we are not to be moved by what we see or what we feel we're moved by what we believe hey man I move what I believe and I believe the same God to give Nehemiah a favor the same God that did these things the same God that spoke through William Brown he's the same God that's here today for you and I and he's given us a Shalom he will not abandon me because of the empty threats of some backsliders he will not forsake me because enemies have risen up your God is with you he's in you even until the end of the age listen God is not backed up don't abandon God he's never abandoned you hey man I tell you what you stand for god brother REM said he'll stand for you you remember your promise he'll remember his amen you know you see people I feel bad for people I really do but they go through different things and they go through situations and this church hurt him or this preacher heard him and now they're not going to serve God or they're going to stay home they're going to do this and I'm thinking listen those people they didn't save me it's like I said earlier they didn't die for me they didn't raise again for me God never did anything wrong to me why would I take it out on God who's been faithful the whole time yes hey man you stand for god listen God is not looking at your enemies today that are arrayed against you and considering Retreat well wow I didn't see that coming hey man he's going like I said he's going to rule the Nations I have to rule your bank account you can rule your health hey man so what's your trouble today Christ in you by faith makes you the master of all circumstances so don't be scared of your enemies they should be scared of you scare the one you represent hey man the scripture says one out the Red Sea not flattest or thou Jordan that I was I was happy to the Seas God looked down with Angry Eyes Upon the enemies of God and he took that same sea that was in their way and he destroyed the Egyptians he destroyed the heathen Hallelujah my my peace through Superior Firepower hey man you just remember that when the enemy comes at you with fiery darts remember you've got a bigger gun you've got more ammunition all Heavens backing you and I up today you'll stand on this word and you'll speak this word you've got every Power in heaven behind you there is more for us than against us let God be with us who can be against us peace shalom don't get worried you make your enemy worried when he sees you hold into your confession holding fast to the profession your faith that ought to worry your enemies I've sent letters I've name called I've thrown to everything I can of this bride and none of it moves them what can you do with the people like that you can't do nothing that's why the enemy is afraid that's why the Bible says he he's he's raging today like he is he knows he's got a short time there's nothing he can do and he knows it and Nehemiah said listen these things you made them up and you know it and I know it you're nothing but a bluff God will make your enemies testify against you he'll make him send letters to listen whatever happened there I don't know listen I've had doctors I've amen praise the Lord doctors that didn't know how it was going to be how this person is going to survive this person's not going to live they'll never walk in doctors have to confess God did a miracle they might not even believe in God God will make your enemies testify that there's a God among this people amen he'll make a banker a credit testify God still a provider he'll make sickness testify God's still a Healer hey man he's still Jehovah Shalom what you thought what the enemy thought was for evil God makes it for good one more scripture here brother bear I'm sorry Paul talks about it scripture Paul says the God of Peace shall Bruce Satan he's the God of Peace shall Bruce Satan under your feet shortly this is the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you amen I want you to amen that today amen the God of Peace shall put Satan under your feet shortly and the bride says amen I don't want you just to say I want you to let that resonate within your soul whatever you're going through whatever your troubles today there's an amen in my soul that when I hear the God of Peace this peace God will put Satan under my feet with every fiber of my being no matter what my feelings no matter what I'm going through I say amen he shall put Satan under my feet and that's my peace hey man don't just make it the confession but make it in your heart and confess with your mouth I'm saying amen [Applause] Didn't I Walk On The Water didn't I call him the Raging Sea I spoke to the wind that heart should he gave you what peace why what'd he say peace be still brother Ram said there was he was a man out there on the boat that night when it was pitched around like a little bottle stopper on the sea when ten thousand Devils of sea swore they would drown him him out there asleep he was so weak oh my God I'm just so weak listen Christ was so weak The Virtue went out of him and he was so tired from healing and going on that day until maybe the devil said we got him out here asleep now see that's what the enemy does he waits till you're in your worst condition says oh I'll get him out of their week I'll get him now they're tired I'll get them out they're discouraged we got him out here asleep now we'll go drown him was laying back there the waves didn't even disturb him hey man I love it the disciples they're like sleeping listen they thought he was unconcerned sometimes they say well God Karis thou not that we perish we're fixing to die there's still sleep wake up what's it take to wake you up listen all you got to say something I already told you we're going over we also scared him anyway don't you care Lord not worried about it why are you the ways didn't even disturb him he was a man when he was laying on that boat asleep but when he walked up there when they woke him he put his foot upon the barrel that boat said Peace peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed him that was more than a man that was God speaking through mortalips his son Hallelujah you see I love that next sentence and what Christ was then we have positionally the same Powers today granted in Christ Jesus where is the faith of the church believeth thou this stand your feet today go ahead but Satan on your feet get up arise and shine listen when the wind in the waves disturb them how do you make peace for him he still the problem he took care of it listen these were professional Sailors professional fishermen they've been on that sea um maybe dozens hundreds of times they've been on that seat but they're going across the middle but one night in the middle of the night they didn't seem like a good time to cross over did it Jesus wasn't worried he said oh no I I'm fixing to get my nap in oh I can't wait till I get mine today thank you wife for driving me home I'm gonna have some shalom you know why because the angel of the Lord in campus round about them that fear men deliver them and then you might be going through problems today you might be going through trials but you've got somebody in the boat today and listen all you got to do is call on him you ain't gonna shake him you ain't gonna smack his face and dump water on him you just say Lord Christ I need you Lord I do believe that you care and I'm going through maybe the storm of my life but you know what listen it's not just him it's him in you the God of Peace will put Satan under your feet listen today if you're going through something I invite you come up here and you put your brain up on this boat Edge whatever you want to do if you're going through depression you're going through anxiety whatever you're going through I want you to come and I want you by faith

that enemy under your feet today if you don't want to give you a piece you can just take it for yourself then listen the enemy is not the one giving it to you in the first place God gave it to you we live in an erotic age there's all kinds of anxiety and uncertainty and depression and different things but I believe today we can put our foot on that thing we can walk out of here with victory we can walk out here with shalom because it's for you it's not for everybody but it's for you he knows he knows his thoughts curious thoughts you aren't you don't just have thoughts of peace power heads Lord
