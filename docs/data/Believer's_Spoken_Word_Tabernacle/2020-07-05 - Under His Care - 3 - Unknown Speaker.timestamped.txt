[45:38] brother Matt when we spoke on the phone
[45:40] over a year ago who knew we'd be here
[45:43] like this
[45:47] evidently it was a good report and the
[45:49] report was received
[45:52] but we just certainly certainly
[45:55] appreciate you all amen and good to see
[46:00] each and every one of you and it's good
[46:03] to be in the house of the Lord this
[46:04] night
[46:06] amen let's turn in the word of the Lord
[46:09] if we tonight or this morning to psalms
[46:12] chapter one
[46:20] Psalms chapter 1 verse 1
[46:34] blessed is the man that
[46:38] walketh not in the counsel of the
[46:43] ungodly nor
[46:47] standeth in the way of sinners nor
[46:51] sitteth in the seat of the scornful but
[46:56] his delight
[46:58] goes here is this man who is blessed is
[47:01] now moving in his life but his delight
[47:06] is in the law of the Lord and in his law
[47:11] doth he meditate day and night
[47:15] he shall be like a tree planted
[47:19] by the rivers of water
[47:24] we know those rivers is old and new
[47:28] Testament
[47:30] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[47:35] sings in his season
[47:37] God's fruit in the season that he sends
[47:41] his messenger with that word
[47:45] his fruit in his season
[47:49] his leaf also shall not wither
[47:54] anybody ever like looking at withering
[47:56] leaves I
[47:58] mean nobody looks at a plant of
[48:00] withering leaves and says Oh in that
[48:01] beautiful
[48:03] but usually withering lead you say that
[48:05] it needs water
[48:09] but his leaf also shall not wither and
[48:14] whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[48:18] verse 4 the ungodly are not so
[48:23] but are like the chaff which the wind
[48:27] driveth away
[48:29] so after a period of time they dry up
[48:34] now when we look at these conditions
[48:37] here there's not this particular
[48:40] condition in verses 1 through 3 of this
[48:43] godly man as though that he's exempt
[48:46] from troubles he's exempt from pressures
[48:49] no same conditions around it same things
[48:55] that can come their way but the
[48:57] difference is one has a life source a
[49:03] hidden life source
[49:05] verse 5 therefore the ungodly shall not
[49:10] stand in the judgment nor sinners in the
[49:15] congregation of the righteous for the
[49:18] Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
[49:21] the way of the ungodly Shall Perish
[49:24] amen I'd like to speak to you once again
[49:28] on the fought under his care may God
[49:32] bless you bless the word as you're being
[49:34] seated I
[49:36] want to go to another portion of
[49:39] scripture that
[49:42] the Holy Spirit would direct Jeremiah to
[49:47] in the time where judgment is impending
[49:53] while judgment is impending you find not
[49:57] only has God spoke through Jeremiah and
[50:00] through Isaiah but you find the love of
[50:02] God even speaking through Jeremiah that
[50:05] they would correct and amend their ways
[50:08] God would even speak to them that to how
[50:13] their lives were to be conducted so that
[50:15] there might be seed that would return
[50:18] into the land
[50:20] we realized that in our lives we from
[50:23] the very fall when the fall took place
[50:26] that death entered in we realized sin
[50:31] entered in and all of that the curse and
[50:36] the judgments are there but God in His
[50:40] mercy he made provision and he told the
[50:43] woman I will give thee a seed
[50:47] and that seed would be that of his own
[50:50] life that of his own creation God would
[50:54] place that that seed that life he would
[50:58] bring forth that body and God would come
[51:01] in that body to redeem his children and
[51:04] though we walk in this world we
[51:07] experience sickness we experience many
[51:10] conditions of the fall but once our soul
[51:13] has been redeemed
[51:17] we're no longer lost
[51:19] we've been found and
[51:22] God has given us a promise yes the world
[51:25] will pass away however I'm gonna bring
[51:29] you back here
[51:32] so when we look at it we find in
[51:37] Jeremiah 17:5
[51:40] thus saith the Lord cursed be the man
[51:43] that trusteth in man and maketh his
[51:46] flesh his arm and whose heart departed
[51:52] from the Lord for he shall be like the
[51:57] heath in the desert and shall not see
[52:00] when good cometh
[52:03] but shall inhabit the parched places in
[52:07] the wilderness in a salt land and not
[52:10] inhabited
[52:12] but blessed is the man that trusteth in
[52:15] the Lord and whose hope the Lord is
[52:20] for he shall be as a tree planted by the
[52:24] waters and that spreadeth out her roots
[52:28] by the river and shall not see when he
[52:33] cometh but her leaf shall be green
[52:36] he will come but it will not be her
[52:39] focus
[52:41] the the conditions come but will not be
[52:44] her focus
[52:49] and shall not be careful in the year of
[52:54] drought neither shall cease from
[52:57] yielding fruit
[53:01] now
[53:04] in a very simple measure I look at this
[53:08] within the scripture and
[53:10] many times you know when if you were to
[53:13] plant flowers trees or other things
[53:17] around your house home yard
[53:21] many times you find that where
[53:25] sometimes we all could we'll take the
[53:29] holes and we're watering like this and
[53:31] we see the leaves we see the water
[53:33] dripping off the leaves you think oh my
[53:35] I've watered this one real good and we
[53:37] move over to this we've watered this one
[53:39] and come back water this one we go all
[53:41] around and and after you know 15 minutes
[53:44] 20 minutes 30 minutes they have watered
[53:48] everything we water these but yet
[53:51] the watering that we see on the top
[53:54] where the water is dripping does not
[53:57] mean that that plants been really
[53:59] watered
[54:04] some of you understand you know where
[54:06] things I think back to the greenhouse
[54:08] days and other times you know even round
[54:11] in our own home they'll sell hoses that
[54:14] the water goes through and then it'll
[54:16] just beat out and are just a little drop
[54:18] will drop out of there not a lot of not
[54:22] a lot of sound going on it's just
[54:24] dropping
[54:25] they have the hoses where you put in
[54:27] your bed and the little drip lines will
[54:29] come right out of there almost like
[54:31] replicating the greenhouse and it'll
[54:33] drop right into a plant it's just
[54:34] dropping trunk
[54:38] you might wonder and say well why it
[54:41] doesn't seem like that plant is getting
[54:43] us really water as much as if I have the
[54:46] the hose on it full throttle but you see
[54:49] here's the here's the part of it when
[54:52] it's dripping it's that water it's
[54:54] allowing that plant to drink and take in
[54:57] that water and what happens is as that
[55:01] plant it soaks in that water the water
[55:04] will actually go down beneath where the
[55:06] plant is at and the roots will follow
[55:10] that water down beneath
[55:13] when water is just sprayed around like
[55:16] this roots grow shallow
[55:20] and when they grow shallow eventually
[55:22] this is when things die
[55:24] now this isn't a hora culture or less
[55:27] than anything but I think how fitting
[55:29] remember God wrote his Bible in the
[55:32] heavens and even as it speaks here
[55:35] within the scriptures it shows that it's
[55:39] got to be more than just a watering out
[55:41] here it's gotta be a penetration down to
[55:45] the soul it's got to be a water that
[55:48] Justin might just come drip drip drip
[55:52] but if it's soaking it up this is why I
[55:55] think of the simple words that brother
[55:57] Bram would use he says if that little
[56:00] plant everything that's in it he says
[56:03] was in it when it was there as a seed if
[56:05] it will just drink drink not just be
[56:10] where the water's act and enjoying the
[56:12] water but drink
[56:15] take in of the water and so when the
[56:17] water goes down what they call a deep
[56:19] watering then the roots will follow it
[56:22] down so when we get into conditions like
[56:25] this out here after that they say about
[56:28] two to three years then it really gets
[56:30] to be an established plant and you don't
[56:33] have to go out there every morning at
[56:34] 5:00 in the morning and watering around
[56:36] and you know and the drip line why it's
[56:38] roots have went so deep it finds sources
[56:43] of water
[56:45] that in the midst of the drought its
[56:48] leaf is still green I
[56:53] believe that's the work of the Holy
[56:55] Spirit of what God's desire is is that
[56:58] our lives would be so connected with
[57:01] Jesus Christ
[57:04] God just doesn't want us to feel good he
[57:08] wants to take and that our soul would be
[57:11] so anchored in the Lord Jesus
[57:13] to where a whole life from that point
[57:16] he'd goes so deep to where a whole day
[57:18] life becomes wrapped up in him lack the
[57:21] roots it just keeps going deeper deeper
[57:23] deeper deeper deeper in him
[57:30] this is why when the scripture Paul
[57:33] would write in Ephesians three this was
[57:36] he prayed for this that he would grant
[57:39] you according to the riches of his glory
[57:41] to be strengthened with might by his
[57:45] spirit in the inner man that Christ may
[57:48] dwell in your hearts by faith
[57:51] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[57:55] love may be able to comprehend with All
[57:58] Saints what is the breadth the length
[58:01] depth and high and to know the love of
[58:05] Christ which passeth knowledge
[58:11] beyond this the love of Christ passes
[58:14] knowledge
[58:17] it can't be reasoned it passes beyond
[58:20] it's greater than any of our thoughts
[58:26] that you might be filled with all the
[58:29] fullness of God and this is why when
[58:33] brother Branham would speak concerning
[58:35] this and he would say in
[58:37] contrasting and saying many there for
[58:40] the fat errand age out of the Book of
[58:42] Revelations he said many he said the
[58:45] commentators have went all around about
[58:47] the depths of Satan he said they
[58:49] bypassed and he said because they don't
[58:51] understand it I think brother Bram says
[58:53] like this he says it's actually quite
[58:54] simple he said if we can just take he
[58:57] said the depths of God then we can
[58:59] contrast that and know what the depths
[59:02] of Satan is the depths of God is that
[59:05] there is a personal experience where we
[59:09] have passed from death unto life and
[59:11] brother Bram would say it's just like
[59:12] this it's an actual an experience where
[59:15] the depth of God comes in that man's
[59:17] life it's an actual personal experience
[59:20] of the Spirit of God indwelling him and
[59:23] his mind is illuminated by the wisdom
[59:27] and knowledge of God through the word it
[59:30] becomes a life that is illuminated
[59:35] what is the experience where you pass
[59:37] from death unto life this is why brother
[59:41] Ram would say away with experience and
[59:43] back to the word he wasn't talking about
[59:45] do away with experience he's saying that
[59:47] let everything the word is to testify of
[59:50] that experience in your life
[59:53] you see the deep watering of the word
[59:56] jesus said the kingdom of God cometh
[59:58] without observation
[1:00:00] sometimes we can look and say it doesn't
[1:00:03] seem like well this one's moving or this
[1:00:05] one's moving at what should we do keep
[1:00:06] the dripline going keep the dripline
[1:00:10] going and it keeps dripping and
[1:00:11] eventually that bowl bets around that
[1:00:14] tree that's there in that sack it's just
[1:00:17] saturating it's taking in and that water
[1:00:20] starts going down slowly it's not just
[1:00:22] running off I don't want this word to
[1:00:24] run off of me I wanna
[1:00:26] of this world brother I wanted to be my
[1:00:29] life to be so saturated with this word
[1:00:32] not about what I understand even when
[1:00:35] I'm listening to the message not that I
[1:00:37] remember everything he said I just want
[1:00:39] to be a saturated life
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:43] let it be saturated Lord in my life
[1:00:52] depth to that life where the roots are
[1:00:54] still growing tests and trials come
[1:01:00] winds come
[1:01:02] but the winds remember as the Prophet
[1:01:05] told us then bend that tree or that
[1:01:08] plant and you could say oh my goodness
[1:01:11] hold that tree oh it's bending he said
[1:01:13] but what's happening is the roots are
[1:01:16] being loosened up to give you a greater
[1:01:19] hold
[1:01:20] tests and trials are are not our enemy
[1:01:23] it's not against us but it's under God's
[1:01:25] sovereign oversight and direction then
[1:01:28] you can see not that God needs to see
[1:01:31] you can see there's a greater anchor in
[1:01:34] your life an acre beyond your knowledge
[1:01:38] or understanding it's a reality of Ag
[1:01:41] living God inside of you that it's not
[1:01:44] me holding on it's him holding me
[1:01:50] this is why Paul would say if you then
[1:01:54] be risen with Christ seek those things
[1:01:56] which are above where Christ sitteth on
[1:01:59] the right hand of God set your affection
[1:02:02] on things above not on things of the
[1:02:05] earth for ye are dead
[1:02:07] and your life is hid with Christ in God
[1:02:10] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[1:02:13] then shall ye also appear with him in
[1:02:16] glory
[1:02:19] think about winning the Lord Jesus
[1:02:22] comes in John 6 I've missed needs to go
[1:02:25] by Samaria
[1:02:26] the rest of disciples go off and they go
[1:02:29] to buy food there's food that's needed
[1:02:32] when they come back here they're
[1:02:36] witnessing that the latter parts of what
[1:02:40] takes place with this little woman at
[1:02:43] the well
[1:02:44] remember Jesus he speaks to them and
[1:02:47] they say you're not hungry and Jesus
[1:02:50] said I have meat to eat that you know
[1:02:53] not of and my meat is to do the will of
[1:02:58] the Father
[1:03:00] it was alive
[1:03:03] listen we talk we look at the life of
[1:03:05] the Lord Jesus and say well he was here
[1:03:08] and the promises are the quickening
[1:03:11] power comes in him as he walks about of
[1:03:13] the River Jordan but remember even
[1:03:15] though he was the word I hope you with
[1:03:18] me now he was the word but it did not
[1:03:21] mean that he didn't read the word
[1:03:25] he knew where to go and the Spirit gave
[1:03:28] unction he wasn't just up there flipping
[1:03:30] around in a scroll and saying well I
[1:03:32] wonder where it's gonna fall open today
[1:03:34] he was led by the spirit to go to Isaiah
[1:03:38] the Holy Spirit in that hour directed
[1:03:42] the word to that hour for its place in
[1:03:45] the word and he opened that and began to
[1:03:48] speak and when he when he read what
[1:03:51] Isaiah wrote under inspiration the
[1:03:53] Spirit of the Lord is upon me it was no
[1:03:56] longer words it was now the announcement
[1:04:00] of the word in fresh
[1:04:14] and the message letting off the pressure
[1:04:17] the brem says I met a woman here some
[1:04:20] years ago in a 10-cent store she was
[1:04:25] about 60 years old looked about 30 years
[1:04:28] old I said how do you do it sister
[1:04:32] she said brother Brown I've got two sons
[1:04:35] that's doctors thence that's older than
[1:04:38] you are
[1:04:39] and honest to goodness she didn't look
[1:04:42] over 30 years old
[1:04:44] she said here's what it is
[1:04:47] when I come to Christ when I was about
[1:04:50] 12 years old I sat down and thought
[1:04:53] about it i standed other religions but
[1:04:57] when I found the true and she said I
[1:04:59] come to Christ and took my case my soul
[1:05:03] my all to him and she said I've never
[1:05:09] had a worry since so now he promised to
[1:05:13] take care of all my troubles and said if
[1:05:15] he's not big enough to do it I know I'm
[1:05:18] not big enough to do it so what's the
[1:05:20] use of me worrying about it
[1:05:26] powerful
[1:05:28] powerful
[1:05:31] you're not even getting charged an arm
[1:05:34] and a leg for this session
[1:05:40] hallelujah this is body changing
[1:05:43] material
[1:05:44] this is life changing word
[1:05:48] hallelujah this is a balm in Gilead that
[1:05:52] brings healing
[1:05:56] now well you say how do I do it
[1:06:00] now don't let me go back he says Christ
[1:06:02] promised that he'd take all our worry
[1:06:04] all your worries cast your cares on him
[1:06:06] so what are you worried about worry
[1:06:09] builds up pressure pressure blows up so
[1:06:13] just cast your cares on him and quit
[1:06:16] worrying
[1:06:18] now well you say how do I do it just
[1:06:21] trust his promise he made a promise he
[1:06:26] would do it even in the time of death
[1:06:27] when the Death Angel comes into the room
[1:06:30] oh brother branham I know I'll be
[1:06:31] nervous oh no you're in the refuge no no
[1:06:34] you you you you know you're good you're
[1:06:36] going to die you got to go some way so
[1:06:38] you just get in that refuge feel safe
[1:06:40] you're safe as long as you're in the
[1:06:43] refuge remember he died for you he cares
[1:06:47] for you he died for you
[1:06:51] now let's take a look you say brother
[1:06:54] branham you mean when the Death Angel
[1:06:56] was knocking at the door you're still
[1:06:58] not gonna get steamed up no not a bit
[1:07:00] well how do you do that come to the
[1:07:04] refuge
[1:07:12] I'm glad we have a place
[1:07:14] I'm glad there's a refuge a
[1:07:19] refuge of our soul
[1:07:23] and in that refuge in Christ all the
[1:07:27] promises are yeah and amen
[1:07:30] every situation that may come your way
[1:07:33] or has come your way you know by a
[1:07:37] direct witness God has already made a
[1:07:41] promise that covers every situation
[1:07:46] sometimes the answer doesn't come in our
[1:07:49] timing or when we want it or the way
[1:07:51] that we're thinking about it but God in
[1:07:53] His grace he worked works with us in all
[1:07:57] of that whole situation to bring us to a
[1:07:59] place by experience to trust in him you
[1:08:03] see the word it's not just something
[1:08:06] that we just we just know David said now
[1:08:09] he says David said and I believe it's
[1:08:12] there in the Psalms where David said it
[1:08:15] was good for me to be afflicted now I
[1:08:18] have learned thy word
[1:08:21] because why affliction brings learning
[1:08:24] how do we learn through suffering
[1:08:29] hello you
[1:08:31] and nothing we glory in suffering but we
[1:08:34] glory in God's provision - no he's right
[1:08:38] here with me
[1:08:45] second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[1:08:49] let's Satan should get an advantage of
[1:08:52] us
[1:08:53] for we are not ignorant of his devices
[1:08:58] second Corinthians ten verses three
[1:09:02] through six for though we walk in the
[1:09:04] flesh we do not war after the flesh for
[1:09:07] the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:09:09] carnal but mighty through God to the
[1:09:14] pulling down of strongholds casting
[1:09:18] down imaginations and every high thing
[1:09:22] that exalteth itself against the
[1:09:26] knowledge of God and bringing into
[1:09:28] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:09:31] of Christ and having in a readiness to
[1:09:35] revenge all disobedience when your
[1:09:37] obedience is fulfilled
[1:09:40] I'm glad were under his care aren't you
[1:09:44] he has equipped us
[1:09:47] he has equipped us with his power
[1:09:51] he has equipped us with all that we have
[1:09:55] need of
[1:09:57] once you listen this how brother branham
[1:10:00] brings us in greatest battle ever fought
[1:10:03] Satan's army brings diseases
[1:10:07] that's what Satan is he's a destroyer
[1:10:13] Satan the whole kingdom of Satan is
[1:10:16] sickness death and sorrow and
[1:10:20] frustrations and worry all on Satan
[1:10:26] God is life faith joy peace over here
[1:10:33] attributes of two kingdoms
[1:10:41] and we're caught right in the middle
[1:10:46] when we have been born again we have
[1:10:50] been translated into the kingdom of his
[1:10:53] dear son our soul
[1:10:55] but this body must be born again
[1:10:59] just as our soul was born again our soul
[1:11:03] is no longer susceptible to sin
[1:11:06] we've been changed we've been sealed the
[1:11:10] desire has left our life but yet in the
[1:11:13] other two realms we can be affected from
[1:11:16] time to time
[1:11:17] they're right sickness disease and
[1:11:21] things that can come away even as Paul
[1:11:23] would deal right here by the Spirit of
[1:11:25] God even in our mind our thoughts and
[1:11:27] even within our spirit now notice this
[1:11:29] now that's the two great forces that's
[1:11:33] coming together right now they're
[1:11:35] battling they're battling right here in
[1:11:38] the building right now they battle day
[1:11:41] by day with you
[1:11:43] every force
[1:11:46] Satan comes at you to hit you with worry
[1:11:48] he'll come at you to try to hit you with
[1:11:50] frustration you try to come hit you with
[1:11:53] sorrow he'll try to come hit you with
[1:11:56] death
[1:11:58] they're battling day by day and just
[1:12:02] even how the Prophet would place it
[1:12:04] Satan doesn't say oh no oh yeah well you
[1:12:08] know I'll be out here waiting at the end
[1:12:09] of the street when you all get done no
[1:12:11] no he comes he's right in here
[1:12:13] [Music]
[1:12:14] is that right he's right in here but you
[1:12:18] know what we're not giving him the
[1:12:20] majority
[1:12:22] we're not giving him any place we're not
[1:12:26] giving him any fault if something wants
[1:12:28] to come in and say well my situation is
[1:12:31] too great no we're not giving the devil
[1:12:33] any place you might say well well I've
[1:12:36] given him place out there huh my fault
[1:12:38] I've entertained I've looked down you
[1:12:40] know upon myself but right here is a
[1:12:42] ground that the Prophet would tell many
[1:12:45] people standing on the prayer line
[1:12:46] you've prayed for a place that you could
[1:12:49] put your foot down for your healing he
[1:12:52] said this is the place for you to put
[1:12:55] your foot down Oh
[1:12:57] glory be to God Satan following you
[1:13:01] along that great big kingly priestly
[1:13:05] life trying to scare the liver out of
[1:13:09] you
[1:13:10] pretty interesting you need your liver
[1:13:12] you know that your liver is what helps
[1:13:15] you process your proteins your
[1:13:16] carbohydrates your fats you need that to
[1:13:19] be able to process the food
[1:13:24] your fortified a man with the gospel
[1:13:28] with the word of truth around your loin
[1:13:30] glory notice what he's doing he's
[1:13:32] getting the people the believer to look
[1:13:36] at their armor
[1:13:38] glory preacher that's what it is helmet
[1:13:42] of salvation the shield of faith and the
[1:13:45] sword
[1:13:46] waving it in your hand so
[1:13:49] if you've got it all sheathed up this
[1:13:52] morning it's time to get it out
[1:13:55] when do I put it back in the sheath when
[1:13:58] you stand on the other side
[1:14:02] you don't ever put up that sword that
[1:14:05] sword you're waving it in your hand
[1:14:08] no repeater God waving in your head
[1:14:12] Satan I'm coming to meet you you meet me
[1:14:15] in the name of science you meet me in
[1:14:17] the name of culture you meet me in the
[1:14:19] name of organization you meet me in the
[1:14:22] name of this that or the other Corona
[1:14:24] but I meet you in the name of the Lord
[1:14:26] God of Israel I'm coming after you give
[1:14:29] way even death itself can't stand there
[1:14:33] chop a hole right through it
[1:14:37] whatever name he wants to come under
[1:14:41] we come in the name of the Lord
[1:14:44] [Applause]
[1:14:48] Satan's army brings diseases and God's
[1:14:54] army is commissioned to cast them out
[1:14:59] amen there you are every time Satan
[1:15:02] throws any on
[1:15:04] unto you
[1:15:07] God's army is to cast Emma so there's
[1:15:10] nothing to prevent Satan from throwing
[1:15:12] casting diseases on us
[1:15:16] but we have authority
[1:15:18] we've got promises that belong to us I
[1:15:22] will take sickness from the midst of you
[1:15:28] I'm the Lord that he loved all the
[1:15:31] diseases
[1:15:32] by His stripes I am healed
[1:15:37] we can't stop were not immune from
[1:15:39] diseases from sicknesses from those
[1:15:42] things coming but we have Authority with
[1:15:44] the word to address the situation simply
[1:15:48] put we've got the answer to the devil's
[1:15:51] question a life that'll take that word
[1:15:54] you see it's not a sword as long as it's
[1:15:57] just a word I've just thought but when
[1:16:00] that word is taken into your heart
[1:16:02] brother it now becomes as Paul wrote
[1:16:04] taking the sword of the Spirit which is
[1:16:07] the Rhema of God it is that word that is
[1:16:11] revealed in our heart it's something
[1:16:14] that's personal it's not what we know
[1:16:16] here but it's something that down here
[1:16:19] we're just resting in that and somebody
[1:16:22] can say how do you know what I just know
[1:16:24] he said so and I'm trusting in him who
[1:16:28] made the promise
[1:16:32] every time Satan throws any on you every
[1:16:36] time
[1:16:37] God's army is to catch the mount
[1:16:41] that's the very technique that God used
[1:16:44] so God just didn't ask the devil devil
[1:16:47] if you don't mind um would you mind
[1:16:50] leaving them
[1:16:52] God cast him out
[1:16:55] he's not going to treat his it the devil
[1:16:57] nicely
[1:16:59] that's the very technique that God used
[1:17:02] Satan used the army of destruction to
[1:17:05] disbelieve God's Word and set him on a
[1:17:07] better Kingdom and Michael had and God
[1:17:09] cast him out God's method is cast out
[1:17:14] the evil
[1:17:16] cast down reasonings cast down
[1:17:19] superstitions notice don't try to reason
[1:17:22] them out cast them down
[1:17:28] casting down reasoning casting down
[1:17:31] superstitions casting down worried
[1:17:33] casting down diseases casting down sin
[1:17:36] you're above it notice notice this
[1:17:39] counsel of the Lord he's directing the
[1:17:43] children of God to the authority that
[1:17:46] they have been raised to
[1:17:50] he's directing them to the authority
[1:17:53] you're above it
[1:17:56] resurrected in Christ Jesus setting in
[1:17:59] heavenly places with every devil under
[1:18:02] your foot if he starts to stick his head
[1:18:06] in there you know you're dead your life
[1:18:09] is hid what is dead you're dead to your
[1:18:13] senses you're dead to your conscience
[1:18:16] your own human will would say yes I
[1:18:22] guess I but you're dead to your
[1:18:24] reasoning dead to all those things and
[1:18:27] you are buried in the name of Jesus
[1:18:30] Christ and raised with him and wherever
[1:18:32] he is there you are also
[1:18:36] you know the reality of it is is that
[1:18:40] being dead that realization of being
[1:18:42] dead to it it also deals with what
[1:18:45] you're feeding on what you're giving
[1:18:47] yourself to depends and will determine
[1:18:49] the strength you have to be able to
[1:18:52] wield that shield that that sword in
[1:18:54] your life this is not something that you
[1:18:56] can just come to church on Thursday and
[1:18:58] expect to live just a victorious life
[1:19:01] when I come to church you know once a
[1:19:03] week and well you know I come to church
[1:19:04] and and I said no your life you'll never
[1:19:07] have a victorious life until you really
[1:19:09] first of all if you've not been born
[1:19:11] again you're first of all need to have
[1:19:13] the victory of Calvary and the
[1:19:14] resurrection in your life that will lift
[1:19:17] you above sin the other part is is that
[1:19:20] for you to live a victorious life in the
[1:19:22] Lord Jesus Christ you've got to have a
[1:19:25] life that lives in the word and walks in
[1:19:28] the word and feasts on the word that
[1:19:31] doesn't mean you're memorizing
[1:19:32] everything it doesn't mean that you know
[1:19:34] all the chapters you know the quotes you
[1:19:36] know the vernacular that's not what it
[1:19:38] is at all it means you're drinking in of
[1:19:41] the Word of God you're taking it in and
[1:19:45] letting it drip down you realize when it
[1:19:47] drips down there's nothing necessarily a
[1:19:49] sound there's not something that's like
[1:19:51] oh my goodness you feel that drip no
[1:19:54] that drip think about the dude that was
[1:19:56] on your grass this morning did anybody
[1:19:58] hear that do come down last night no
[1:19:59] seen a lot of smoke from them fireworks
[1:20:01] but they're wonder what you didn't see
[1:20:03] that do coming down but the dew came
[1:20:06] down brother
[1:20:07] you know the dew is the promise to that
[1:20:10] of the heirs it was promised to Jacob
[1:20:13] that I would give you the do
[1:20:16] the do comes in the stillness of the
[1:20:19] night it settles down and to think about
[1:20:22] it in our lives to be able to stand
[1:20:25] there and to cast down and to be dead to
[1:20:28] all of our reasonings I'm not going to
[1:20:30] ask you to raise your hands but many of
[1:20:32] us we have made sometimes we've leaned
[1:20:35] to our own human we our own human mind
[1:20:37] instead of giving the mind of Christ the
[1:20:40] right away in our lives those are always
[1:20:43] the times that we have to say forgive me
[1:20:47] because there's only two ways right way
[1:20:50] wrong way God's Way our way
[1:20:54] what happened notice he says when one of
[1:20:57] them doubters got in heaven God kicked
[1:20:59] him out and what did he say to the
[1:21:01] soldiers that's raised in Christ when a
[1:21:03] devil comes along
[1:21:05] you see it is not we're not exempt from
[1:21:08] the devil coming along but when he does
[1:21:10] can't kick him out
[1:21:12] casting out
[1:21:17] brem says I'm crucified with him
[1:21:19] nevertheless I live not me even live but
[1:21:21] he that liveth in me the word going on
[1:21:24] before God cutting away with his sharp
[1:21:27] two-edged sword and brother Brown takes
[1:21:30] this the song that the woman wrote when
[1:21:34] she saw grant coming in there in victory
[1:21:39] there in the Civil War he says no wonder
[1:21:42] when grant took Richmond and that little
[1:21:44] southern woman seen seen grant coming in
[1:21:47] the inspiration struck her and she said
[1:21:51] mine eyes have seen the glory of the
[1:21:54] coming of the Lord he is tramping out
[1:21:56] the vintage where The Grapes with Wrath
[1:21:59] are stored he loosed the faithful
[1:22:02] lightning with his terrible Swift sword
[1:22:04] his troops are marching on
[1:22:08] listen this how did grant take Richmond
[1:22:12] just as he come to it
[1:22:16] you can't take it till you get to it
[1:22:20] you can't take Jericho's till you get to
[1:22:22] it but it belongs to you
[1:22:24] you can't take a on til you get to it
[1:22:27] but it belongs to you
[1:22:30] that's how God soldiers takes in
[1:22:34] sickness just as they come to it
[1:22:37] God might be dealing with your heart
[1:22:40] this morning to take sin he might be
[1:22:43] anointing your life this morning for you
[1:22:45] to lay down your life he's equipping you
[1:22:48] with his word his spirit his life to
[1:22:51] rise up and surrender your life God
[1:22:54] equips andin doused his children to rise
[1:22:58] what is it it's the drip of the holy
[1:23:01] spirit that
[1:23:02] saturation and moving down into that
[1:23:05] life to rise and take that promise
[1:23:07] notice just as they come to it
[1:23:13] that's the way they overcome their
[1:23:14] doubts
[1:23:16] and fears and things
[1:23:20] when one Rises
[1:23:22] they chopped him down
[1:23:25] the son died never faced this yet you
[1:23:28] will
[1:23:29] what will I do you'll take it when you
[1:23:32] get to it
[1:23:34] just like many of the things when you
[1:23:36] know I first started out serving the
[1:23:37] Lord I could not understand some of the
[1:23:39] battles and different things that some
[1:23:41] of the others maybe would have go
[1:23:42] through or whatever you know it's a
[1:23:43] wonderful honeymoon time and it still
[1:23:45] it's it's it's greater now serving the
[1:23:47] Lord after the things that God has
[1:23:49] brought me through had to Humble me
[1:23:51] teach me and he's still doing that he's
[1:23:53] been mighty long-suffering with me he's
[1:23:54] been very patient with me but I realized
[1:23:57] that there are things that within it it
[1:23:59] all must begin with first of all a life
[1:24:02] that is established it's rooted and
[1:24:04] grounded in him and then when we come to
[1:24:07] situations in our lives that's when we
[1:24:10] take them
[1:24:14] it's a little different for somebody to
[1:24:17] talk that's been through something
[1:24:19] you're with me then it is for somebody
[1:24:22] who's not been through anything and I'll
[1:24:25] tell you this is that you've been
[1:24:26] through that no that doesn't mean we
[1:24:29] discredit the Word of God there's a lot
[1:24:31] of things Paul did not experience but
[1:24:33] Paul was able to by the unction of the
[1:24:35] Spirit of God be able to admonish our
[1:24:37] lives
[1:24:38] marriage is on and on and on right but
[1:24:41] when we recognize within this all how
[1:24:44] much greater it is and God would place
[1:24:45] that even in the church to where there
[1:24:48] are experiences of things of how that we
[1:24:50] have come through so when we come to
[1:24:52] that this is how we overcome our doubts
[1:24:55] and fears and things why you've got
[1:24:57] greater is He that's in you
[1:24:58] there's already been an overcoming in
[1:25:01] your life
[1:25:02] when one Rises they chop him down move
[1:25:06] out of the way God cast him out like you
[1:25:08] did in heaven our great chief captain
[1:25:11] showed us how it was done now the
[1:25:14] scripture would go on and it would speak
[1:25:16] to us about casting all of our cares
[1:25:18] upon him I I don't have time to read
[1:25:20] this scripture right now but it would
[1:25:21] speak how we are to cast all of our
[1:25:23] cares upon him after humbling ourselves
[1:25:26] under the mighty hand of God because the
[1:25:30] enemies like a roaring lion seeking whom
[1:25:33] he may devour this is why the Spirit of
[1:25:36] God would call out and say be sober be
[1:25:40] village and why it shows if he's calling
[1:25:43] for soberness there must be a heightened
[1:25:45] drunkenness
[1:25:47] this world is drunk right now
[1:25:52] but so are we
[1:25:54] what kind of drunk are you I'm sober
[1:25:56] drunk I've got my right mind I've been
[1:26:00] intoxicated by the Holy Ghost I got my
[1:26:03] right mind I didn't used to have my
[1:26:05] right mind I'm a sober drunk I'm sober
[1:26:09] from the things and the drunkenness of
[1:26:11] the world but I'm filled with the wine
[1:26:13] of Almighty God the wine
[1:26:16] he has provided in this age the banquet
[1:26:19] Esther's fees I am taken with this wine
[1:26:25] whom resist steadfast
[1:26:29] in the faith knowing
[1:26:31] that the same afflictions are
[1:26:35] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:26:38] in the world
[1:26:39] in that a trick of the devil to make you
[1:26:43] think something odd about you you're the
[1:26:46] only one dealing with this you're the
[1:26:48] only one going through this
[1:26:51] God doesn't always come right away and
[1:26:53] give an answer
[1:26:56] this is where trust comes in
[1:27:04] but how encouraging it is we can see
[1:27:06] through the word of the Lord we can look
[1:27:08] back and say well yeah my brother and
[1:27:11] God brought them through the same God
[1:27:14] that brought them through the same God
[1:27:16] bringing me through
[1:27:21] this in this scripture here
[1:27:24] Psalms 12 25
[1:27:27] heaviness in the heart of man
[1:27:31] maketh it stoop
[1:27:34] this word heaviness means anxiety
[1:27:38] anxiousness
[1:27:40] worry maketh it stoop or the word to
[1:27:45] depress
[1:27:47] anxiety is one of those things that can
[1:27:50] come around we see the scripture the
[1:27:51] Lord Jesus would admonish us even in our
[1:27:53] lives that there are certain things do
[1:27:56] not be anxious about don't even try to
[1:27:58] entertain thoughts for tomorrow for
[1:28:00] sufficient unto the day is the evil
[1:28:02] thereof in other words there will be
[1:28:05] troubles and worries you've got things
[1:28:06] to deal with tomorrow don't don't don't
[1:28:08] try to entertain what's tomorrow say
[1:28:10] right and many times if the Prophet
[1:28:12] would deal with situations where people
[1:28:14] were dealing with nervous trouble and
[1:28:16] he'd deal dealing with heart trouble
[1:28:17] dealing with this and it would not say
[1:28:19] you know what your heart is bad and this
[1:28:21] and that but it would go right down and
[1:28:22] say your problem has always been your
[1:28:25] make up and
[1:28:26] yet I'm fearfully and wonderfully made
[1:28:29] come on now God didn't make a mistake
[1:28:32] and say oh no I put a little bit too
[1:28:34] much chloric in you I put a little bit
[1:28:36] too much melancholy I shouldn't have
[1:28:38] done that I'm
[1:28:40] fearfully and wonderfully
[1:28:42] made
[1:28:44] so they until now when we look at this
[1:28:47] lord help me to yield my life to the
[1:28:51] authority that you have placed within me
[1:28:54] this is our greatest challenge this is
[1:28:57] our greatest victory this is the
[1:28:59] greatest enemy that we face heaviness
[1:29:02] anxiety you know many times when they
[1:29:04] when they talk about I've studied it
[1:29:05] studied some things on it and when you
[1:29:07] look at with anxiety the way that things
[1:29:09] that would experience and no doubt every
[1:29:11] one of us to a certain degree some no
[1:29:13] doubt deal with it more than others but
[1:29:15] the one way that they'll describe that
[1:29:17] of anxiety is where you've got thoughts
[1:29:19] in your mind and all of a sudden it'll
[1:29:21] be one little thought or a situation
[1:29:23] that will take place and it will
[1:29:25] actually hijack the very neurons and the
[1:29:28] pathways that are within the brain and
[1:29:30] you would look at that and say oh
[1:29:31] brother samuel we don't even need God
[1:29:34] wrote about that in his word God wrote
[1:29:36] about it but the thoughts that were
[1:29:38] supposed to think God knew those
[1:29:41] situations and conditions would be very
[1:29:43] you know you just want you look at it
[1:29:46] sometimes in the prophets ministry where
[1:29:48] different ones were right there with him
[1:29:49] and they were never of their stomach
[1:29:52] condition had to take Rolaids and comes
[1:29:54] the rest of their life
[1:29:56] it wasn't that God's power was weak not
[1:29:59] at all but God proves in the midst of
[1:30:02] this situation that His grace is greater
[1:30:09] offense and think about this if those
[1:30:11] things would work in that level how is
[1:30:14] it that the enemy would want to try to
[1:30:17] come and bring situations and alive that
[1:30:20] would come about in panic or or where
[1:30:22] thoughts start going in a certain way I
[1:30:24] believe that we have received of God a
[1:30:27] word to combat that you believe that but
[1:30:31] a good word maketh it glad
[1:30:36] or David said in Psalms 94 19 in the
[1:30:42] multitude
[1:30:45] of my thoughts within me
[1:30:49] that comforts
[1:30:52] delight my soul now notice David
[1:30:56] separating
[1:30:57] thoughts
[1:30:59] battles the battleground in the
[1:31:03] multitude the word multitude here would
[1:31:06] be like a system and a series of
[1:31:07] branches like you would take maybe this
[1:31:09] plant right here it's got branches and
[1:31:11] off of those branches there's little
[1:31:13] things that start going it's just like
[1:31:15] the devil's ploy to try to get your mind
[1:31:18] going in a rat race
[1:31:20] though you've got to prove something to
[1:31:23] him you don't have nothing to prove to
[1:31:24] him
[1:31:25] come on when you know where you know
[1:31:29] where you're spending what God has done
[1:31:31] with in your life he can present all of
[1:31:33] your faults all your mistakes all your
[1:31:36] shortcomings he can look at you to a
[1:31:38] place to where remember even how sister
[1:31:40] Bruce was sitting there I make so many
[1:31:42] mistakes how can I possibly be the bride
[1:31:45] of Jesus Christ but notice what the
[1:31:47] Prophet does he takes her thoughts and
[1:31:51] he centers them back to the reality of
[1:31:55] what Christ has done in her life and
[1:31:59] then he tells her you're made up this
[1:32:01] way you get something on your mind he
[1:32:04] said you've got to go do it for the Lord
[1:32:06] you have to do it he said Satan will
[1:32:09] come and stand in the same way and he'll
[1:32:12] start putting things in your mind
[1:32:15] it's discerning between those thoughts
[1:32:20] remember we're talking about being
[1:32:22] planted in the rivers by the rivers of
[1:32:26] water
[1:32:27] drawing from him notice how he would
[1:32:31] mention this in the multitude of my
[1:32:34] thoughts within me by comforts delight
[1:32:39] my soul so David is able to receive from
[1:32:43] the comforts of the Lord to actually be
[1:32:46] able to combat when the enemy would come
[1:32:49] around or when thoughts even even when
[1:32:52] the enemy maybe would not come around
[1:32:53] but thoughts about himself how could I
[1:32:55] be this or how could I be there I think
[1:32:57] there's one thing that David this
[1:32:59] scripture has just so meant so much to
[1:33:02] me David said I have learned not to
[1:33:05] dwell and think on things too high for
[1:33:08] me
[1:33:11] but how the how the how are we thinking
[1:33:13] on things too high when we're trying to
[1:33:15] figure it out by our own knowledge when
[1:33:19] we're trying to reason out God has never
[1:33:22] made us to live by our reasoning this is
[1:33:25] a faith walk that is based and rooted in
[1:33:29] the love of Almighty God so David made a
[1:33:33] choice in the multitude when my thoughts
[1:33:35] are running every which way and all
[1:33:38] these things are springing out like
[1:33:39] branches that comforts delight my soul
[1:33:44] you know these are battle instructions
[1:33:46] here this is delight that we look at you
[1:33:50] should take delight in its to have
[1:33:53] something and it's caressed so lovingly
[1:33:56] to play with affection we're not playing
[1:33:58] with the word but we are taking the word
[1:34:00] affectionately into our lives that's
[1:34:02] what David is writing up here these are
[1:34:04] battle instructions that's given to us
[1:34:06] as it was to Joshua this book of the law
[1:34:09] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[1:34:12] thou shalt meditate therein day and
[1:34:14] night that thou mayest observe to do
[1:34:18] according to all that is written therein
[1:34:20] for then thou shalt make that way
[1:34:23] prosperous and then thou shalt have good
[1:34:28] success
[1:34:33] the brown would make a statement in the
[1:34:36] church age book no believer is more
[1:34:39] spiritually healthy and
[1:34:41] victorious than his knowledge of the
[1:34:44] Word of God and be adherence thereto
[1:34:53] it's to meditate on it that's to muse on
[1:34:57] it that's to dwell on it
[1:34:59] it's to think on
[1:35:05] in the multitude of my thoughts by
[1:35:07] comforts delight myself I don't have
[1:35:09] time this morning but let's look at a
[1:35:11] few comforts to
[1:35:13] delight our soul I
[1:35:16] am redeemed
[1:35:19] Psalms 107 verse 2 let the redeemed of
[1:35:24] the Lord say soul whom he hath redeemed
[1:35:28] from the hand of the enemy
[1:35:31] this is our promise in the word
[1:35:35] I'll just said let the redeemed of the
[1:35:38] Lord think so let him say so I'm
[1:35:40] redeemed I know that I have not only
[1:35:44] been bought but I have been brought back
[1:35:46] to God I'm redeemed
[1:35:49] notice in Ephesians 2:1 this is a
[1:35:52] thought I have been quickened I am a new
[1:35:55] creation in him notice you have he
[1:35:59] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:36:01] and sins where in times past you walked
[1:36:04] according to the course of this world
[1:36:07] according to the Prince of the power of
[1:36:09] the air the spirit that now worketh in
[1:36:11] the children of disobedience among whom
[1:36:13] also we had our conversation in times
[1:36:16] past in the lusts of our flesh
[1:36:18] fulfilling the desires of the flesh and
[1:36:21] of the mind and we're by nature the
[1:36:23] wrath of the children of Wrath even as
[1:36:26] others I have been quickened
[1:36:35] evidently God seemed that this was a
[1:36:37] need because this is not even where I
[1:36:38] was going to go in these notes today
[1:36:42] but that thought that scripture begin to
[1:36:45] just so pulsate in my heart is this
[1:36:47] morning I got up in the multitude of my
[1:36:49] thoughts that comfort still like my soul
[1:36:52] listen we got enough negative trash all
[1:36:55] around us we've got enough negativity
[1:36:58] all around us I tell you what be the
[1:37:00] best thing for people to do is turn off
[1:37:02] their news channels
[1:37:04] that'd be the best thing loose em you
[1:37:07] tell me being that I'd rather be in tune
[1:37:09] with this world and know about what
[1:37:12] God's Word is I'd rather have my life
[1:37:15] built up and faith then to let myself be
[1:37:19] open to a channel for fear
[1:37:25] whatever you give yourself to remember
[1:37:28] spirits travel with word I
[1:37:33] am righteous in him for he hath made him
[1:37:39] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:37:43] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:37:46] in him I'm not righteousness because of
[1:37:50] me my righteousness is because of him
[1:37:55] he has lifted me from the life that I
[1:37:59] was in he brought a change in my life
[1:38:01] what did that the righteousness of God
[1:38:05] not I will be I am
[1:38:08] John 14:26 I have the comforter he is my
[1:38:13] peace and he gives me peace I just wrote
[1:38:16] these little words in here above these
[1:38:18] scriptures will get it sent out to you
[1:38:20] in John 14:26 the comforter which is the
[1:38:22] Holy Ghost whom the father will send in
[1:38:25] my name he shall teach you all things is
[1:38:27] he has he brought comfort to your life
[1:38:30] you might be in the midst of a trial a
[1:38:33] situation something you have Jude you're
[1:38:35] holding right onto a promise of God but
[1:38:37] yet he's your comfort and
[1:38:41] bring all things to your remembrance
[1:38:43] whatsoever I have said unto you peace I
[1:38:46] leave with you
[1:38:47] my peace I give to you not as the world
[1:38:50] giveth give I unto you let not your
[1:38:53] heart be troubled neither let it be
[1:38:56] afraid
[1:39:01] he's my friend
[1:39:05] he's my buddy Oh you shouldn't say that
[1:39:08] no no the prophet said it he said Oh God
[1:39:11] will you let that sinner know of how he
[1:39:13] said you came down from glory that you
[1:39:16] might become buddies with us
[1:39:21] he is my friend a man that had friends
[1:39:25] must show himself friendly so if you
[1:39:28] feel like you don't got many friends how
[1:39:30] friendly are you
[1:39:33] it's like what people say nobody at the
[1:39:35] church loves me and you run to your car
[1:39:37] after every service
[1:39:40] it's just a trick of the devil that
[1:39:42] don't mean getting everybody's face
[1:39:43] either but it means show yourself
[1:39:45] friendly that might mean sipping this
[1:39:49] and opening these Oh Lord
[1:39:51] this was supposed to be comforts that
[1:39:54] delight my soul
[1:39:55] he is my friend and there is a friend
[1:39:59] that sticketh closer than a brother
[1:40:07] I'm under his care
[1:40:11] he adds to my life and watches over me
[1:40:14] can I just refer to this one this is
[1:40:16] what we read out of Matthew 6 this is
[1:40:18] when Luke talking about the birds he who
[1:40:20] takes care of the birds provides for
[1:40:22] them what they have need of they are not
[1:40:23] worrying about oh my goodness am I gonna
[1:40:25] have strong I wonder if they're gonna
[1:40:27] have this at the store I wonder is this
[1:40:28] going to be I wonder who I wonder I
[1:40:30] wonder what's coming up in the fall I'm
[1:40:31] wondering
[1:40:34] you know what you need to do become a
[1:40:36] bird watcher
[1:40:43] yeah hey Solomon my inspiration said
[1:40:47] come on here look at the end

[1:40:53] teach a lot of people a lot of things

[1:40:56] started looking at the Robbins you know
[1:40:59] just sit down and look at it a little
[1:41:01] bit and consider they're not worried
[1:41:04] they don't think you know they're not
[1:41:06] taking high blood pressure medicine
[1:41:08] I'm not saying if you're on and you
[1:41:10] understand what I'm talking about been
[1:41:12] there and they're not have caught up in
[1:41:14] these trivial things
[1:41:17] they're focused on the purpose that
[1:41:22] they're here for
[1:41:25] brother we've got a purpose we've been
[1:41:28] germanized by the Holy Ghost our purpose
[1:41:31] is to reflect Jesus Christ in this earth
[1:41:35] we are ordained for a rapture
[1:41:38] [Applause]
[1:41:39] I'm under his care
[1:41:44] he is the chief
[1:41:47] attending physician
[1:41:50] he is my surgeon when I need operated on
[1:41:59] he's my chiropractor when I need to be
[1:42:01] cracked back in line
[1:42:07] he adds to my life it's not me
[1:42:12] God Lord I'm gonna make this word live
[1:42:15] I'm gonna make it live in my life I'm
[1:42:17] gonna
[1:42:21] that's called frustration that's Satan's
[1:42:24] Kingdom
[1:42:28] the God's kingdom is life and peace
[1:42:32] what should I do just turn it on just
[1:42:35] sit there when you come to him when you
[1:42:37] come to church see ya here's the water
[1:42:40] soaker hose sit down like your Cedar

[1:42:51] drip drip drip drip drip drip drip you
[1:42:54] walk out of here you walking out
[1:42:55] flushing
[1:42:59] he's adding to my life
[1:43:03] one of the greatest discouragement in
[1:43:06] the multitude of our thoughts is where
[1:43:08] we feel like I'm not growing
[1:43:13] but God comes along and he'll show us
[1:43:16] the right mirror Satan has those funny
[1:43:19] mirrors Saint will try to take the word
[1:43:21] and show you like a little dwarf but
[1:43:24] when God takes by the Holy Spirit in a
[1:43:27] gift he'll take that word and brother
[1:43:29] you might see yourself small but you see
[1:43:31] a great big God who's on the inside you
[1:43:35] see greater is He that's in me king is
[1:43:38] adding to my life
[1:43:41] [Applause]
[1:43:45] not what I want to be
[1:43:55] know what out of me but I know one thing
[1:43:59] I
[1:44:00] ain't and I don't care if that in proper
[1:44:03] English I ain't what I used to be
[1:44:08] I'm under his care
[1:44:14] he will finish his work that he started
[1:44:19] in me being confident of this very thing
[1:44:23] that he which hath begun a good work in
[1:44:26] you will perform it until the day of
[1:44:28] Jesus Christ to realize he performs it
[1:44:31] as we yield I got confidence he'll
[1:44:34] continue to give me grace to yield
[1:44:37] he'll give me grace in trials and
[1:44:39] situations to help me to yield to his
[1:44:42] outworking
[1:44:45] most of you know the scripture huh I'm
[1:44:47] not gonna read this bank of scriptures
[1:44:48] here but he is my light Psalms 27 he is
[1:44:52] my light my salvation and my strength I
[1:44:54] have nothing to be afraid of
[1:45:02] he sustains me and I shall not be moved
[1:45:08] cast that burden upon the Lord and he
[1:45:11] shall sustain thee he shall never suffer

[1:50:33] that created the Oh Jacob then formed
[1:50:35] the Oh Israel fear not for I have
[1:50:38] redeemed thee I have called thee by thy
[1:50:42] name

[1:50:50] be with you through the rivers they'll
[1:50:53] not overflow you when you walk through
[1:50:56] the fire they shall not burn neither
[1:51:00] shall the flame Kindle upon you notice
[1:51:02] he didn't say you wouldn't go through
[1:51:04] waters you wouldn't go through rivers
[1:51:06] fire wouldn't come yet he said when it
[1:51:09] does come I'll be right there with you
[1:51:13] you're mine you're under my care
[1:51:18] I'm seeing you through thy comforts they
[1:51:23] delight my soul

[1:51:32] David said I will fear no evil
[1:51:35] yea though I walk through the valley of
[1:51:37] the shadow of death I'll fear and feel
[1:51:39] no evil for thou art with me thy rod and
[1:51:41] thy staff comfort me Joshua 1:5 there
[1:51:44] shalt not any man be able to stand
[1:51:45] before the all the days of our life as I
[1:51:48] was with Moses so I will be with thee I
[1:51:50] will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[1:51:52] verse 9 hath not I commanded thee be
[1:51:56] strong and of a good courage be not
[1:51:57] afraid neither be thou dismayed for the
[1:52:00] Lord that God is with thee whithersoever
[1:52:02] thou goest
[1:52:03] notice God does not say fear dismay of
[1:52:07] all that it will not say oh he won't be
[1:52:09] around no but this is what I'm telling
[1:52:12] you don't be dismayed
[1:52:13] well what do we have to become against
[1:52:16] that for the LORD thy God is with thee
[1:52:19] whithersoever thou goest
[1:52:24] hallelujah this is what happened right
[1:52:27] Roy Hebrews 13:5 let our conversation be
[1:52:31] without covetousness such things as you
[1:52:34] have for he hath said I will never leave
[1:52:36] thee nor forsake thee so that we may
[1:52:40] boldly say the Lord is my helper and I
[1:52:45] will not fear what man shall do unto me
[1:52:48] Matthew 28:20 and now I'm with you all
[1:52:52] the way even to the end of the world
[1:52:55] amen
[1:52:58] he will perform all his word he will
[1:53:02] fight for me
[1:53:05] Deuteronomy 3:21 and I commanded Joshua
[1:53:08] at that time saying thine eyes have seen
[1:53:11] all that the Lord your God have done
[1:53:12] unto these two kings so shall the Lord
[1:53:15] do unto all the kingdoms whether thou
[1:53:17] passes ye shall not fear them for the
[1:53:21] Lord your God he shall fight for you
[1:53:25] remember that the brand would tell us
[1:53:28] over and over he says if you go to
[1:53:30] strike start trying to fight the battle
[1:53:32] God can't find it
[1:53:36] let God fight the battle
[1:53:39] how do I do that give myself into his
[1:53:44] hands oh
[1:53:47] my you know the scripture that we love
[1:53:51] to quote so much who shall separate us
[1:53:54] from
[1:53:55] the love of Christ
[1:53:57] all those conditions that are around and
[1:54:00] Paul could say nay and all these things
[1:54:03] were more than conquerors
[1:54:06] is that right Paul would go on to say
[1:54:09] I'm persuaded
[1:54:11] all these other spiritual conditions
[1:54:14] Heights nor depth nor principalities nor
[1:54:17] all these spiritual forces that are at
[1:54:20] work
[1:54:21] that's what's at work in the unseen
[1:54:23] realm right now
[1:54:24] darkness pushing and encroaching and
[1:54:27] congealing together things that don't
[1:54:30] even agree why it's pale horse anointing
[1:54:34] it's gathering together that spirit is
[1:54:38] culminating together
[1:54:40] you see that congealing even things that
[1:54:43] don't even agree with one another but
[1:54:46] it's darkness gross darkness
[1:54:50] but in the midst of it I'm persuaded
[1:54:55] nothing shall be able to separate you
[1:54:58] say me from the love of God that's in
[1:55:02] Christ Jesus my Lord it's about personal
[1:55:04] that comforts delight my soul
[1:55:07] aren't you glad I
[1:55:10] won't read Psalms of ninety-one but I'd
[1:55:13] love to I'm dwelling in the secret place
[1:55:17] under his protection
[1:55:19] I'm safe I'm covered by his feathers
[1:55:27] let's send you it says Matt no no plates
[1:55:29] shall come now that dwelling that's
[1:55:31] right I'm dwelling in Christ my soul is
[1:55:34] sealed
[1:55:36] my body can get sick come on now it can
[1:55:40] experience all of that but my soul is
[1:55:42] safe in Goshen
[1:55:44] it's safe in the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:55:49] they're right you remember even when the
[1:55:51] Asian flu pandemic hit back in 1957 when
[1:55:56] that pandemic hit it was nowhere near
[1:55:58] the Spanish flu not a matter of fact
[1:56:00] there's not been anything close to that
[1:56:02] of the Spanish flu that hit way back
[1:56:05] there in the beginning of the 1900s
[1:56:07] nowhere in comparison but even when the
[1:56:10] Asian flu it was a pandemic brother Bram
[1:56:12] tux talks tells us he and a group of
[1:56:14] brothers were going out west to hunt
[1:56:16] every one of them came down with the
[1:56:18] Asian flu they weren't even able to hunt
[1:56:20] one day they came back
[1:56:22] came back and rested God raised him up
[1:56:25] it wasn't exempt from the Asian flu but
[1:56:29] it couldn't touch the soul what's the
[1:56:31] main important is is we've already
[1:56:33] received the vaccination for the soul
[1:56:37] amen were immune from sin we're immune
[1:56:41] from the devil's lies we've received the
[1:56:45] mind of Christ brother let me tell you
[1:56:48] that's a more necessary vaccine than any
[1:56:51] vaccine for corona
[1:56:54] there's people that when they get a
[1:56:56] vaccine for Corona they'll still be
[1:56:58] nutty they'll still be crazy they'll
[1:57:00] still be insane but if they ever get
[1:57:02] this vaccine of a baptism of the Holy
[1:57:04] Ghost brother it'll make them love
[1:57:06] everybody
[1:57:08] [Applause]
[1:57:09] it'll put the love of God in their heart
[1:57:12] and they will protest against sin and
[1:57:15] unbelief against doubt against disease
[1:57:19] against sickness they will be equipped
[1:57:22] with the power that's able to tear down
[1:57:25] Satan's Kingdom and his divisive schemes
[1:57:28] that's what this vaccine will do for you
[1:57:31] this vaccine will make you hate your
[1:57:33] brother it makes you love your brother
[1:57:35] [Music]
[1:57:37] hey man this is the real love of God oh
[1:57:40] it's not been legislated it's just a
[1:57:44] life of that constitution from the
[1:57:46] Lamb's Book of Life that life has come
[1:57:48] down and quick in that seed germ on the
[1:57:51] inside and we've been set free
[1:57:54] from this world
[1:57:58] then keep going
[1:58:01] I'm free
[1:58:06] so when the multitude of thoughts
[1:58:11] start to come your way
[1:58:15] what are you going to do that
[1:58:18] comfort sword
[1:58:20] delight my soul
[1:58:22] now you don't have to you you know this
[1:58:25] is just like a little small core
[1:58:27] sampling
[1:58:29] we took out of the scriptures that core
[1:58:33] sampling brother Haran it means it's
[1:58:34] loaded down there
[1:58:37] what I need to do just let it drip in on
[1:58:40] you
[1:58:41] saturate me real good and just setting
[1:58:44] them roots down deeper
[1:58:47] man this is a trying time did you see
[1:58:50] them I mean it's a trying time for him
[1:58:52] and they still got joy
[1:58:55] everything must go their way no
[1:58:58] what's the secret their roots spread out
[1:59:03] their leaves are still green they still
[1:59:05] got fruit man they must not have any
[1:59:07] problems in their life
[1:59:09] this in the fairy tale and in a pipe
[1:59:13] dream it's a reality when a man or woman
[1:59:16] is filled with the Holy Ghost they've
[1:59:18] got a source that they're tapped into
[1:59:20] then even in the midst of situations
[1:59:24] that come sometimes we could be so
[1:59:26] overwhelmed but we have an anchor a
[1:59:28] resting place to come back to
[1:59:31] in the multitude of my thoughts
[1:59:37] that comforts
[1:59:39] Delight
[1:59:43] it might be just one of these that you
[1:59:46] remember but it isn't about you
[1:59:48] remembering allow God to just quicken
[1:59:50] them to your heart
[1:59:51] if there was one thing that we could put
[1:59:54] we always want to put you know the kids
[1:59:56] work and we want to put all these
[1:59:57] reminders on the fridge

[2:00:03] on top of that one you came to see the
[2:00:05] first one for all of them
[2:00:11] we need to have a reminder on our phone
[2:00:13] to check the reminder that we put to

[2:00:32] I'm grateful
[2:00:34] God knows that even though we may not
[2:00:37] put it up as wallpaper but brother Matt
[2:00:39] there's something about it in the midst
[2:00:40] of those times
[2:00:44] that where those roots are tapped in
[2:00:47] it'll draw up out of there the reality
[2:00:49] of the love of Christ that has passed
[2:00:53] all knowledge and it stands there when
[2:00:57] fear would gonna come and say you're a
[2:00:59] liar fear perfect love cast out all fear
