[33:16] the lord taketh pleasure in his people
[33:19] and he will beautify the meek with
[33:21] salvation dude you realize every step of
[33:24] the way
[33:25] when God was even dealing with your life
[33:27] and my life
[33:30] God it was God taking pleasure in
[33:33] dealing with our lives
[33:35] even when it didn't seem like anything
[33:38] was taking place if you would have asked
[33:40] our family or anybody else around us
[33:41] they would say I don't think anything's
[33:43] taking place but God was taking pleasure
[33:46] and God takes pleasure in working with
[33:50] our lives and bringing us
[33:52] to a place of surrender
[33:54] filling us with his life
[33:57] walking
[33:59] inside of us every step of the way God
[34:01] takes pleasure
[34:03] God takes pleasure when we reach up to
[34:05] him and say Lord I need strength he
[34:08] takes pleasure
[34:11] it takes pleasure
[34:12] Paul said that's the pleasure according
[34:14] to his good will
[34:16] I'm so thankful for that aren't you glad
[34:19] that there's somebody holding you that's
[34:21] greater than you

[37:41] it in the name of Jesus Christ
[37:43] [Music]
[37:46] and God bless you thank you musicians
[37:49] amen
[37:51] I want to go to
[37:52] job 23 and
[37:55] I've been reading from this portion of
[37:57] scripture and uh
[37:59] here tonight I I didn't know if I would
[38:02] come back and touch this or not but uh
[38:05] uh just a little a thought and I I'm not
[38:09] going to try to get all the way through
[38:10] it here but I spoke this the Lord laid
[38:13] it on my heart to speak on the Sunday
[38:15] evening at brother Nathan Bryants and I
[38:19] just it was something that God began to
[38:22] deal with my heart on
[38:24] you know times when you take a scripture
[38:26] and you meditate on the scripture and I
[38:28] I personally believe that I've watched
[38:30] how God will come around and give answer
[38:32] and give direction for this and I always
[38:34] credit it that lord it's not me trying
[38:37] to figure something out but it's you
[38:39] that's laid that scripture on my heart
[38:40] and then God has a time when he'll come
[38:42] around and just just speak to that
[38:45] scripture and just you know bring forth
[38:47] what what it is that he wants for us and
[38:50] to minister to our hearts and so I just
[38:53] want to draw from job 23
[38:56] in verse 8 and the reason I say I I'd
[38:59] love to be able to preach it all here
[39:00] tonight but I it's not like when I
[39:02] preach out I know I'm not pastoring I
[39:04] have to move get through a subject and
[39:06] just try to hit skip Like a Rock
[39:07] skipping across the the water so I
[39:10] that's one advantage I have as a pastor
[39:12] I can just it's a slow drop and drop but
[39:15] these are things that we would look at
[39:18] here I believe God's been speaking to
[39:19] our hearts on just even the Practical
[39:21] Parts in our life because I believe the
[39:24] word it is to live in our flesh amen
[39:27] it's not just when we're at church the
[39:29] reality is our molding in our character
[39:31] is what actually takes place outside of
[39:33] church we receive the word in our hearts
[39:36] right here it's changing us it's giving
[39:38] us strength for even the molding that's
[39:40] taking place through the tests and the
[39:41] trials that we go through so verse 8
[39:43] behold I go forward but he's not there
[39:47] and backward but I cannot perceive him
[39:50] and on the left hand where he does work
[39:54] but I cannot Behold Him he hideth
[39:57] himself on the right hand that I cannot
[40:00] see him but he knows the way that I take
[40:03] when he had tried me I shall come forth
[40:07] as gold
[40:09] I'd like to just begin just to take a
[40:11] thought on this in his hands
[40:14] in his hands
[40:16] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[40:18] of the word as you're being seated
[40:21] brother Brown would say it like this and
[40:23] the message the Seal of God he says
[40:25] I've often said God help the day when
[40:28] men will be what they ought to be
[40:32] if I was against him I'd say I was
[40:34] against him it'd be again I'd be against
[40:37] him in everything I could be but I'm for
[40:40] him and I love him and I believe him and
[40:44] my life is in his hands to do with
[40:48] whatever he wants to because I believe
[40:51] that Christianity is the truth
[40:54] is that how you feel my life is in his
[40:56] hands to whatever he wants to do
[40:59] however he wants to use me whatever
[41:01] Avenue my life's in his hands and the
[41:04] message be certain of God brother REM
[41:06] says when you openly confess that God is
[41:09] the same God and your life applied in
[41:13] his hands to be Lord I'm the clay Thou
[41:18] Art the Potter then ask what you will
[41:20] and Faith Will Never Move it'll stand
[41:22] right there those circumstances will
[41:25] seem to fall from right and left but
[41:28] that faith never moves because you're
[41:31] certain that he's gone and of his God he
[41:34] keeps his promise he can't make a
[41:36] promise and break it if he's God he's
[41:38] got to keep his promise oh I love that
[41:40] he's got to stay with it
[41:43] so to think when we have openly conflict
[41:46] confessed and your life is applied in
[41:48] his hands in that of I'm the clay you're
[41:52] the Potter
[41:53] you know there's one thing for sure that
[41:56] a Potter and there might be you might
[41:59] find somebody out there on YouTube I'm
[42:00] not asking for any videos on it but you
[42:03] might find somebody that maybe is you
[42:05] know uh just you know in some way has
[42:07] only reused one hand I but I've never
[42:09] seen a Potter with just one hand I've
[42:12] seen everything the when I've studied
[42:14] over the years and whether I was going
[42:16] to minister on that of of a Potter I
[42:18] would sometimes I'm reading and reading
[42:20] just on things outside and then I'll
[42:22] look at certain videos that we can maybe
[42:24] you know you can try to tap into and
[42:26] I've never seen a Potter with just one
[42:28] hand but I've always seen it with two
[42:30] hands and where there are always one
[42:32] hand that's studying it there's another
[42:34] and but sometimes both hands are shaping
[42:36] it together then there's other times
[42:37] where that that Potter will put his hand
[42:40] down in it and he's working from the
[42:41] inside out and my is just a tremendous
[42:44] thing that both hands and I just want to
[42:46] say it like this we're in his hands and
[42:48] God has two hands
[42:51] job said on the left hand he worked but
[42:55] I can't Behold Him and on the right hand
[42:57] but I can't see him so job recognizes
[43:01] that there is a uh two parts and how
[43:04] that God himself will move and operate
[43:07] within our lives and you know I I would
[43:10] definitely say even here tonight that we
[43:12] would look at that and when we just can
[43:14] think just very temporarily without
[43:16] dwelling on it in this moment of it but
[43:19] we all enjoy the right hand of God and
[43:21] my the power and the expression the
[43:24] miracle the manifestation but there's
[43:26] also the need of the left hand as well
[43:29] and so God works on our lives with both
[43:32] hands and it's so important that right
[43:35] hand and left hand and we understand
[43:36] that God is a spirit and that these
[43:39] terms that even when it would say the
[43:41] arm of the Lord in the hand of the lord
[43:42] it's all figurative of God himself
[43:45] coming down and dealing with Humanity
[43:48] God revealing and making himself known
[43:51] to you and I think about that even in
[43:53] those uh terms where God would uh they
[43:57] use the term personification where God
[43:58] would even extend himself the arm of the
[44:01] Lord is extending his hand that God
[44:03] would so relate to you and I because you
[44:06] and I even within that have trouble
[44:08] relating to God but God would so come
[44:11] down and make himself known to you and I
[44:13] in those manners that I am the
[44:16] ever-present god and so you know we
[44:19] realize that even even here tonight as
[44:22] job would write about it that in whose
[44:24] hand is the soul of every living thing
[44:27] in the breath of all kind
[44:29] remember when Paul would stand there on
[44:31] Mars heel and he said uh here we live
[44:34] and breathe and have our being in him
[44:36] Paul was declaring that our lives that
[44:40] everything that is taking place there is
[44:42] nothing outside of the hands of God and
[44:46] yet not every life has been fully
[44:48] delivered into the hands of God think of
[44:51] it in this terms that even when that
[44:54] world war had started and then you know
[44:56] when uh everything was preparing to just
[44:59] wipe the world over but yet here they
[45:02] can't figure out we're coming up on it
[45:03] in November the 11th of Armistice Day
[45:06] they still do not know what is it that
[45:09] caused that that ceasing of fire but it
[45:12] was God who has it in his hands and he
[45:14] told the angels in the Book of
[45:16] Revelations hold the Four Winds until
[45:20] I've sealed my servants so the whole
[45:24] purpose is is not just the sealing of
[45:26] Israel but in this time the 11th our
[45:29] worker was to come and that 11th Hour
[45:32] worker is you and I who has received the
[45:35] same wages as the first hour the same
[45:38] experience that they had on the day of
[45:41] Pentecost the same son of man coming in
[45:44] his fullness and his power restored back
[45:47] to the Church of the Living God it's the
[45:49] moment of the 11th Hour worker and it's
[45:52] in God's hands
[45:56] a lot of things have went to where the
[45:58] world has been on its Brink and you know
[46:01] even when you think of coming into
[46:02] October and when the Cuban Missile
[46:04] Crisis and all these things but nothing
[46:07] could take place and nothing can finish
[46:10] it out until that last one has come in
[46:14] and that God himself has got all Israel
[46:18] in their place which I believe that they
[46:21] are and God will take his people in
[46:24] Rapture in rapturing grace before one
[46:27] bomb hits this the bride will be gone
[46:30] god holds the Reigns in his hands
[46:36] even as the prophet could say it like
[46:38] this he said you ever been in an
[46:40] accident and you wonder when you look
[46:42] back at that accident how did I walk
[46:45] away from there he said that's because
[46:48] the hand of the Lord was upon you
[46:54] oh my see God's mercy his our life is in
[46:59] his hands and so to think of it that you
[47:02] know within this time that what an
[47:04] opportunity that we have to make a
[47:06] choice in this hour God he doesn't make
[47:09] the choice for us and you might say well
[47:11] am I not in the choosing of God well
[47:14] when God's choosing what God chose and
[47:17] saw before the foundation of the world
[47:19] it only is an act that is taking place
[47:22] now if you are part of his choosing
[47:25] there you'll be part of the choosing now
[47:27] because you will recognize him and
[47:30] choose him in this hour as his influence
[47:33] moves across your life
[47:36] that's God himself he he comes to seek
[47:39] and save what was lost well you can't be
[47:42] found if you never was lost I mean you
[47:44] know I don't go find a you know a keys
[47:46] or look for keys to a you know a
[47:48] Cadillac I don't own a Cadillac so I
[47:51] didn't lose no Cadillac keys but God
[47:53] when he came he said Remember the son of
[47:56] man has come to seek and save that which
[47:58] was lost so God himself has come God
[48:01] wasn't lost we were and God came down
[48:04] and sought you and I out
[48:07] amen his presence coming by our lives
[48:10] think of this in John 10 27 my sheep
[48:14] hear my voice and I know them and they
[48:17] follow me and I give unto them
[48:20] eternal life and they shall never perish
[48:24] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[48:28] my hand oh what a promise
[48:31] Amen in his life where in his hands I
[48:35] give them eternal life and they shall
[48:37] never perish why because if we were able
[48:40] to perish I'm not talking about this
[48:43] outside this outside part right now this
[48:46] outside part it ages it's outside part
[48:49] gets weary it gets tired but that's not
[48:52] the part we're talking about we're
[48:54] talking about that inward part that seed
[48:57] of God that part of the word of God
[48:59] that's what God came to Quicken that's
[49:03] what God came to get a hold of because
[49:05] just as it takes there of sperm and egg
[49:07] father and mother that seed on the
[49:10] inside was the womb the bedding ground
[49:12] it was the womb that Christ might place
[49:15] his life and that his life might be
[49:18] expressed so you're not just a church
[49:20] member walking around with oh these
[49:23] blessings oh these blessings with out of
[49:25] power to live an overcoming life but
[49:28] when that overcoming life comes down and
[49:31] that seed is God's Throne his seed his
[49:34] Temple and when God sits there in that
[49:37] place his rightful place then you are
[49:40] rightfully pleased in Christ Jesus then
[49:42] you have authority then you have Victory
[49:45] and they're an Express through your life
[49:47] and that's the greatest blessing that
[49:48] works out to other blessings
[49:51] what a privilege it is to know our life
[49:53] is in his hands no man can pluck them
[49:56] out of my hand
[49:58] My Father which gave them me is greater
[50:02] than all and no man is able to pluck
[50:05] them out of my father's hand
[50:09] God's word God's Will and we're a smack
[50:12] in the middle of it
[50:14] you say well brother Samuel I'm seeking
[50:16] for God's will right now now listen to
[50:18] me the will of God the the most Supreme
[50:21] will of God is that you be born again
[50:24] is that you be filled with the life of
[50:27] almighty God that is the will of God and
[50:29] then from that in your life that's where
[50:32] everything itself begins to move through
[50:34] that's the thinking man's filter begins
[50:37] to filter out it when you got decisions
[50:39] coming up and things are coming your way
[50:41] you're looking at it saying Lord what do
[50:43] you say about this what do you see
[50:45] within this why because you have a
[50:47] filter you have a strength there is the
[50:49] will of God in your life and you're
[50:52] looking for his will in every day living
[50:57] gives a real rest doesn't it
[50:59] it gives a rest because we don't have to
[51:01] we're not fighting and wrestling with
[51:02] that we just Lord I I'm looking to you I
[51:05] I may not see it it may get down to a
[51:07] time when you're ready to start biting
[51:08] fingernails but just hold on don't don't
[51:10] bite them just look to God God let me
[51:12] just say something like this I don't
[51:14] want to say God has habits but I'll just
[51:15] say there's sometimes there's a lot of
[51:17] patterns in things to where that you
[51:19] find God showing up at the last moment
[51:22] to us as humans we're the ones who start
[51:26] sweating bullets but not God God knew he
[51:29] had to wait for Pharaoh's Army for them
[51:30] horses to start they could feel the
[51:32] breath on them God had to wait for that
[51:34] moment why because he needed to destroy
[51:36] what was after him
[51:39] God knows what he's doing it seemed like
[51:41] all all hope was lost when you know
[51:44] Naomi would say you you both of you uh
[51:47] Ruth and orpha going back to your your
[51:49] your your your your your Homeland going
[51:52] back but you see if they had went on
[51:54] back who would have brought Naomi back
[51:56] to her estate you say well Beau has had
[51:59] it but it had to come back it had to
[52:01] pass through that of a gentile bride to
[52:04] come back to her that same truth
[52:06] remember it was what Ruth received the
[52:09] seed of Boaz and through that life that
[52:12] came back then when it's handed back to
[52:14] the Jews to Naomi Naomi became a wet
[52:17] nurse what is it it will be an infant
[52:19] truth that he died from my sins that he
[52:23] became me he God came down he is the
[52:26] messiah
[52:27] oh mine through that infant truth it'll
[52:30] revolutionize their life hasn't it it
[52:32] hasn't revolutionized our life
[52:35] oh my they covered the grace of God so
[52:38] we look at this and I want to just say
[52:40] in his hands
[52:43] you know whatever little that we could
[52:46] have or whatever little that you think
[52:49] when you put it in his hands God can do
[52:52] something with it
[52:53] but when you put it in his hands you
[52:55] know it'd be like if you ever had people
[52:58] where they give you something then they
[53:00] want to tell you how to do it
[53:03] right now don't look around don't look
[53:04] around don't look next door I don't want
[53:06] you know they tell you you can use it
[53:08] but they're going to tell you in your
[53:09] mouth say well go ahead and I'll drink
[53:11] the sweet tea while you do it and then
[53:12] you can
[53:14] but we all know that right but you see
[53:16] with God
[53:18] putting it in his hands I want you to
[53:19] think like this that here when Jesus in
[53:22] Matthew 14 there was a little boy the
[53:25] prophet said was truant from school I
[53:27] guess this was the only time it'd be all
[53:28] right to be truant from school
[53:31] you know it's like when when our boys
[53:32] have to go for it maybe when Zachary had
[53:34] to go for a doctor's appointments
[53:36] everyone goes oh you're out of school
[53:37] early I don't know he's homeschooled
[53:39] he's just taking a break to come here
[53:41] right now but this little boy was truant
[53:44] and when he showed up
[53:45] they met there was a need that came up
[53:48] little did he know that that little
[53:50] lunch that he packed that day
[53:52] was going to become a miracle in the
[53:55] hands of the Messiah
[53:58] many times we left out of the day we
[54:00] don't think
[54:02] don't think prayed and and and all of
[54:04] that is important we prayed we we've
[54:06] looked we've had a devotion we've looked
[54:08] to the Lord and said Lord just guide me
[54:09] today Lord bless me today guide my
[54:11] footsteps today how little do we know
[54:13] that it's a moment and a day where our
[54:16] lives being placed in his hand and a
[54:18] situation that looks so Bleak but then
[54:20] when in his hands then it is multiplied
[54:25] this is where Jesus and I think this is
[54:27] important in verse 17 of Matthew 14 it
[54:30] says we have here but Five Loaves and
[54:32] two fishes he said bring them hither to
[54:35] me
[54:36] as long as you keep it you can't do
[54:38] nothing with it
[54:39] you know it's like trying to say you're
[54:41] trying to teach somebody how to write
[54:42] and they want to hold the pencil let me
[54:44] see it I said no no I'm gonna do it no
[54:46] you got to put it in his hands
[54:49] you got to put it in his hands sometimes
[54:51] that's the really and no matter how old
[54:53] we are sometimes that's what we struggle
[54:54] with is putting things in his hands
[54:56] because we want to we will have requests
[54:59] that we make known to God and then we
[55:01] want to tell God how to be God
[55:05] oh Lord
[55:07] help us Jesus notice this he commanded
[55:11] the five to sit down in verse 19 on the
[55:13] grass and he took the Five Loaves and
[55:16] the two fishes looking up the heaven he
[55:18] blessed break it gave the loaves to his
[55:19] disciples and the disciples to the
[55:22] multitude and they did eat and were
[55:24] filled and they took up the fragments
[55:27] that remained 12 baskets full and they
[55:31] had eaten were about five thousand men
[55:33] beside women and children
[55:36] so it's beyond five thousand
[55:38] but it just shows you I want you to
[55:40] notice it wasn't just enough
[55:43] it was more than enough
[55:46] he's God's Not Just Enough he's more
[55:49] than enough
[55:50] he's not just enough for your situation
[55:53] he's my more than enough
[55:57] this happened twice in the gospel it
[55:59] happened in Elijah's day the same God it
[56:02] happened when they were building the
[56:03] Temple and the people were to bring
[56:05] offerings and the finally they had to
[56:08] stand up and say tell the people Moses
[56:10] don't bring no more offerings we've got
[56:12] more than enough
[56:15] I'm not saying that here but I'm saying
[56:17] this it's more than enough
[56:21] is that all right notice it wasn't very
[56:25] much in that little Lads that little I
[56:27] could pack that thing around
[56:29] maybe a brown paper bag you know if you
[56:31] were like we were like most of us when
[56:33] we went to school or you were one of the
[56:34] cool kids that had one of those tins
[56:36] that could be dented with the Therma
[56:38] Senate you know that could hold about a
[56:40] shot of Kool-Aid in it you know but you
[56:42] know it wasn't very much in his hands it
[56:45] was it was just enough to take care of
[56:47] him but when it got when it was put into
[56:49] the Master's hands giving him to God's
[56:52] hands when it was given to his hands you
[56:55] might say brother Samuel I'm in his
[56:56] hands but if you'll give whatever
[56:58] situation whatever need it is give it
[57:01] into his hands and say lord it's just as
[57:04] little right here tonight I can't see a
[57:07] way out but put it in his hands
[57:12] oh brother random setting and the
[57:14] message it is on 1960 how God can
[57:18] multiply what we put in his hands in our
[57:21] hands it's not much in his hands he
[57:24] multiplies it by the thousands if we
[57:27] could only let him have what little we
[57:29] have our time our Attention our faith
[57:32] may not be too much but I say God let me
[57:35] just put my little time my little
[57:37] attention whatever it is whatever you
[57:40] say it's just a little bit put it in his
[57:42] hands
[57:44] [Music]
[57:48] huh
[57:50] but Brian says it like this
[57:52] I want you to think of this this to me
[57:55] is just a powerful quote Billy Graham
[57:57] said that little faith in the message
[57:58] preparation that little faith You've Got
[58:01] Tonight
[58:02] just enough to get you out to the church
[58:04] turn it loose put it in his hands and
[58:07] say Lord I don't care if they call me
[58:10] Holy Roller backwash whatever they want
[58:13] to I'm accepting the baptism of the Holy
[58:16] Ghost right now God Kindle fire in my
[58:19] heart let me come forth watch what it'll
[58:22] be in an hour from now you'll be going
[58:25] down the street singing I got the
[58:27] old-time religion
[58:29] notice how simple it is it's Satan that
[58:33] wants to complicate it but you see what
[58:36] it is is coming in tune and energizing
[58:38] that little faith that you had to even
[58:41] come to the house of God tonight if you
[58:43] just can put that into his hands how do
[58:47] I do that his word as he's revealing
[58:50] himself he's revealing his hands to you
[58:53] he's making himself known and if you
[58:55] just put it in his hands and say Lord I
[58:58] accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost I
[59:01] accept whatever your need is I accept
[59:04] that Lord God and he says watch what
[59:07] it'll be an hour from now
[59:10] when these five fishes and two loaves
[59:13] got put in Jesus hands he didn't have to
[59:15] tell them give me a month to Sunday so I
[59:19] can create a hatchery
[59:20] I need to develop a fish hatchery here I
[59:24] need you also to give me a couple Fields
[59:26] so I can plant some seed we can Harvest
[59:29] that seed we can beat that out and get
[59:31] that gluten whatever it is out of there
[59:33] and begin to make some bread he did not
[59:36] need that you see he bypassed everything
[59:40] else that you and I would know let me
[59:42] just say this God when God moves God
[59:46] will bypass all of our human reasoning
[59:50] God doesn't need our help as far as us
[59:53] telling him what to do he just needs us
[59:56] to take whatever it is and put it in his
[1:00:00] hands and say you know what I'm too
[1:00:03] small to carry this so I'm gonna put it
[1:00:06] in my Big Brother's hands
[1:00:14] on you cause you care for me
[1:00:18] these burns are too big for me I can't
[1:00:21] bear them but Lord God you said that if
[1:00:24] I would place them in your hands you
[1:00:26] would bear me up
[1:00:31] thank you Jesus
[1:00:33] in the message if God be with us wears
[1:00:36] all his miracles remember how Gideon
[1:00:38] when Gideon himself he had to act on the
[1:00:41] word he put the broth he put the uh the
[1:00:44] offering all on the Rock and hear the
[1:00:46] angel of the Lord veiled there uh you
[1:00:49] know in that of of of a human vessel he
[1:00:52] touched it with the rod and it went up
[1:00:54] and then you know of how that God led
[1:00:56] him along with the the you know the
[1:00:58] Sheep the skin of the sheep and on one
[1:01:01] time it was the dew on there and the
[1:01:03] next time Gideon said all right let that
[1:01:06] be dry and let do fall around it let me
[1:01:08] just say this to you right now I do not
[1:01:10] look down on Gideon whatsoever you can
[1:01:13] that's why we cannot compare one
[1:01:15] another's experiences we cannot I can't
[1:01:18] compare my experience to you you can't
[1:01:20] compare your experience to me because
[1:01:22] look at David you never find David going
[1:01:24] the Month of Sundays before David
[1:01:26] finally got convinced but you find
[1:01:28] Gideon where God is dealing with Gideon
[1:01:31] God's dealing with Gideon but you know
[1:01:33] what it didn't bother God whatsoever God
[1:01:36] as a matter of fact said let me tell you
[1:01:38] something son you need to get down there
[1:01:39] and hear this dream and if you're afraid
[1:01:42] to go take your armor Bearer with you
[1:01:44] because I need you to hear what's being
[1:01:46] said you know what God was interested
[1:01:48] God was not going to shame Didion
[1:01:50] because that would have never encouraged
[1:01:52] Gideon shaming us will never encourage
[1:01:56] us how does God encourage you and I
[1:01:58] encourages Us by his word by making
[1:02:02] himself known he said if I be lifted up
[1:02:06] I will draw all men unto me
[1:02:10] that's why I'm glad I don't got to pull
[1:02:12] him into him push me into him just lift
[1:02:14] him up
[1:02:16] Hallelujah now watch this act upon his
[1:02:19] word
[1:02:21] remember I'd be ashamed if I had to put
[1:02:23] the fleece down and then I turned around
[1:02:25] out why it's you and God personal
[1:02:29] let me tell you God ain't hitting and
[1:02:31] missing even in the service but if you
[1:02:33] just will just take the attention that
[1:02:35] he himself has so dedicated to your life
[1:02:38] that he would direct and studying and
[1:02:40] giving lame these things not only upon
[1:02:42] my heart but the way the inspiration
[1:02:44] would travel in this service if God is
[1:02:46] so mindful of you I say it's time to
[1:02:49] just reach out and take a hold of him
[1:02:51] like touching the Hem of His Garment and
[1:02:54] say if it means for me to lay the fleece
[1:02:56] down here and do to fall on it and then
[1:02:59] tomorrow I'll take the fleece up and say
[1:03:01] it let it be dry and let everything else
[1:03:03] around it be filled with do why that's
[1:03:05] between you and God
[1:03:08] you got to do something about it you
[1:03:10] have to act on the word of God
[1:03:12] notice what brother Ram says act upon
[1:03:15] his word and you'll see a real Miracle
[1:03:18] something will take place when you act
[1:03:20] upon his word like Gideon did he did
[1:03:23] what he told him to do like Noah did he
[1:03:27] did what he told him to do like Moses
[1:03:30] did he did what he told him to do now
[1:03:32] remember before they did it there was no
[1:03:35] Miracle right that's why the Bible said
[1:03:37] in Hebrews chapter 6 you have need of
[1:03:40] patience after you have done the will of
[1:03:43] God that you might receive the promise
[1:03:47] I've done the will of God well don't get
[1:03:49] impatient
[1:03:50] if you've done the will of God just wait
[1:03:52] for the fire to fall
[1:03:56] is that all right he said throw down
[1:03:58] your stick now watch out watch how
[1:03:59] brother Graham takes this with Moses he
[1:04:01] said throw down your stick in other
[1:04:03] words get rid of everything's around you
[1:04:06] and let me have it you say I got an
[1:04:09] awful temper give it to God he knows how
[1:04:12] to quieten it
[1:04:15] you mean there ain't a book in the
[1:04:16] bookstore no just this is very simple
[1:04:18] you don't have to spend no more money on
[1:04:20] Amazon you don't have to get another
[1:04:22] Kindle book on how to be uh you know a
[1:04:24] happy mad guy you don't have to get
[1:04:26] another book on how to be that the
[1:04:28] happiest Grump in town you don't have to
[1:04:29] do that
[1:04:31] I got an awful temper you see what it is
[1:04:34] just being honest with God lord I've got
[1:04:36] this and I I need help give it to God he
[1:04:40] knows how to quieten it I got a lot of
[1:04:42] lust he knows how to take it away just
[1:04:45] put it in his hands and watch what a
[1:04:48] miracle can do
[1:04:50] glory be to God
[1:04:55] how many want a clear future
[1:04:57] I do a clear future remember how brother
[1:05:00] Brandon when he had that parasite when
[1:05:02] he came back from Africa mandatorre him
[1:05:05] up you know with six months tore him up
[1:05:07] but then finally was wanting to know at
[1:05:09] that part when things were coming down
[1:05:11] into that and he was still dealing with
[1:05:12] still suffering from it had different
[1:05:14] effects from it and it was just
[1:05:15] something on his heart he wanted to know
[1:05:17] Lord what is my future he just pondering
[1:05:21] meditating on that and here the presence
[1:05:23] of the Lord came down like that of a
[1:05:24] typewriter and typed out a note where
[1:05:26] brother Graham could see it by vision
[1:05:28] and on that typewriter it was typed out
[1:05:30] your future is clear and the Hand
[1:05:33] reached down and took that that that out
[1:05:35] of that typewriter that was their
[1:05:37] Envision and just flung it out there and
[1:05:39] said your future is clear so not only
[1:05:42] did God write it God announced it
[1:05:44] and that's the same God that announces
[1:05:47] it for you and I
[1:05:48] [Applause]
[1:05:49] am
[1:05:51] I mean we're not meditating on other
[1:05:53] people's problems we have other burdens
[1:05:55] on our hearts for our brothers and
[1:05:56] sisters is that right but there's needs
[1:05:58] there's things that we have on our heart
[1:06:00] things that maybe we've got questions or
[1:06:02] things we're praying about things within
[1:06:04] the scripture and let me just tell you
[1:06:05] something God is mindful when you begin
[1:06:07] to think on him God himself will answer
[1:06:11] according to his word
[1:06:14] I want my future to be clear notice in
[1:06:16] Psalms 31 15 I love this scripture my
[1:06:20] times are in his or in thy hand don't
[1:06:23] you love that
[1:06:25] Lord have mercy if we can just put that
[1:06:27] all in right there it takes all the
[1:06:28] anxiousness out if David if David who
[1:06:31] did not have been the privilege of
[1:06:33] having the experience of the rest in our
[1:06:36] soul and David can have this kind of a
[1:06:39] testimony under the law where the Holy
[1:06:42] Spirit would come and remove and come
[1:06:44] and move and he could have that kind of
[1:06:45] a confidence my times are in thy hand so
[1:06:50] in other words the timeline everybody I
[1:06:53] remember remember that from school
[1:06:54] timelines right probably sister Anita
[1:06:57] still has to walk him through that I
[1:06:58] used to hate making timelines you know
[1:07:00] why I never could get them right I'd
[1:07:02] have this big old wide open thing at the
[1:07:04] at the beginning I've never I never get
[1:07:07] it spaced out right you know
[1:07:09] I really had to watch that when I was
[1:07:11] teaching tried to use you know a
[1:07:13] computerized things but because
[1:07:15] everything would be so so you know not
[1:07:17] not spread out exactly but notice God
[1:07:19] knows every little Junction every little
[1:07:22] thing along the way you might sit
[1:07:24] brother Samuel I'm afraid I'll miss this
[1:07:26] you can't miss it when you're seeking
[1:07:28] after him when you put God first how can
[1:07:32] you miss a Divine appointment in his
[1:07:34] word
[1:07:36] it's impossible that's why David could
[1:07:38] say in Psalms 1 1 19 that how a young
[1:07:41] man would cleanse his way
[1:07:43] now think of this our future you know I
[1:07:46] don't know what the future holds there's
[1:07:47] a lot of things that happen in the past
[1:07:49] years we did not expect certain things
[1:07:52] happening like it did
[1:07:55] I don't know what the future holds and
[1:07:58] I'll just be honest with you I don't sit
[1:08:00] around trying to put a prediction on it
[1:08:01] I know what judgment is looming I know
[1:08:04] where we're living in the end time we
[1:08:07] see things around us but you know what
[1:08:09] my objective is not to be caught up in
[1:08:11] predicting it I know it's here but I've
[1:08:14] been given a direction when you begin to
[1:08:16] see all these things lift up your head
[1:08:20] cause your redemption's drawing now
[1:08:24] is that right so God I don't know what
[1:08:27] the future holds but I know who holds
[1:08:29] the future
[1:08:31] I'll tell you I can't tell you how many
[1:08:33] times when there's been things that come
[1:08:35] along that come along my way even from
[1:08:37] teaching and everything else even before
[1:08:39] I got out of teaching college and you
[1:08:41] know you got to have a certain grade
[1:08:42] point average to get into the teacher
[1:08:44] School the last last part of it and man
[1:08:46] I'll tell you there's thoughts can come
[1:08:48] and worry you to death and you know a
[1:08:50] little if you let them thoughts linger
[1:08:51] man I'll tell you fear can grip a hold
[1:08:53] of you
[1:08:54] anybody with me tonight
[1:08:57] I mean you let certain things linger and
[1:08:59] you start pondering well what if this
[1:09:01] and what if that and what if this and
[1:09:03] what if that and what if this and pretty
[1:09:05] soon you're so much down the what if and
[1:09:07] what if Trail you're like where was that
[1:09:09] Crossroad where where did I leave the
[1:09:11] main road in my mind
[1:09:13] come on now friends I'm talking real
[1:09:15] life now there's things that come around
[1:09:17] we start trying to look at and we start
[1:09:19] trying to figure it out and we're trying
[1:09:21] to look for ways and trying to look for
[1:09:23] those things but you know when it comes
[1:09:25] back when we can come back to that place
[1:09:26] and say God you who got a hold of me and
[1:09:29] I'm in your hands
[1:09:31] Lord I need you to take a hold of my
[1:09:33] mind right now
[1:09:34] I know that my mind is given for me that
[1:09:37] I'm to rule over my spirit but Lord I
[1:09:39] really need some help right now
[1:09:41] there's some strength right now Lord
[1:09:43] when this anxiousness has wanted to rise
[1:09:45] up I'm not I'm not big to call on Jesus
[1:09:47] I need his savings strength because the
[1:09:50] Bible said he is the saving strength of
[1:09:53] his anointed amen
[1:09:56] amen hallelujah
[1:09:58] oh glory be to God oh brother Samuel I
[1:10:01] don't ever get down oh you're not being
[1:10:04] truthful brother Branham who stood there
[1:10:06] himself in perfect faith and then he
[1:10:08] comes back around and works made Faith
[1:10:10] expressed and he tells the people in
[1:10:12] perfect Faith he said I'd get gloomy
[1:10:14] times too
[1:10:16] right I get gloomy times too
[1:10:20] but he said here's what I do when I get
[1:10:22] them gloomy times I reach over and start
[1:10:24] reading Romans 4. he said that's what
[1:10:26] every time I do when I start feeling
[1:10:28] blue
[1:10:29] so don't go to New Orleans just just
[1:10:31] pick up Romans 4.
[1:10:33] you don't need to be singing the blues
[1:10:36] you need to be something that'll
[1:10:37] actually lift you amen lift you out of
[1:10:40] there right
[1:10:42] amen amen so notice in the message
[1:10:45] Shalom brother said do as David did put
[1:10:48] your future into his hands
[1:10:53] oh my
[1:10:55] you know I often said this like with the
[1:10:58] young people and things like that and
[1:10:59] mentioned in different places I said can
[1:11:01] you imagine how that when Samuel went
[1:11:03] down there to the house to anoint David
[1:11:05] to be king
[1:11:07] you know David if you understand it
[1:11:09] David was the young youngest of the of
[1:11:11] the family
[1:11:14] so he didn't have a younger brother that
[1:11:16] he could practice being a leader on
[1:11:19] so nobody thought to bring him in
[1:11:22] but God knew what lay in there
[1:11:26] because God needed somebody that he
[1:11:28] could lead
[1:11:31] and so when David you know Saul said
[1:11:33] Saul opened up the flask he said surely
[1:11:36] to the Lord my mate is here
[1:11:38] he opened up the flask and went to pour
[1:11:40] it on the first one said this got to be
[1:11:42] the one nope
[1:11:43] God said to the second one got to be the
[1:11:45] one nope gotta be no no no no no finally
[1:11:48] Samuel just sat down
[1:11:51] go get him he said you got another one
[1:11:53] you haven't done the fifth Samuel sat
[1:11:54] down and said go get him because we
[1:11:56] ain't going no further until you bring
[1:11:57] him what are you saying I'm saying don't
[1:12:00] accept nothing less than the will of God
[1:12:04] 's revealed something to you don't
[1:12:06] accept anything less than the will of
[1:12:09] God let me tell you something as a young
[1:12:11] person a young lady a young man you
[1:12:14] don't have to settle for anything less
[1:12:16] than a real experience you don't have to
[1:12:18] settle for anything less than a real man
[1:12:21] of God a real daughter of God you don't
[1:12:23] have to settle
[1:12:25] for anything less
[1:12:27] than the will of God
[1:12:30] truth
[1:12:33] well that was free
[1:12:35] David do like David put your future in
[1:12:38] his hands what is he
[1:12:40] he is revealed to me he is the revealed
[1:12:43] truth and my time is in his hands my
[1:12:46] time belongs to him I am his I am in his
[1:12:49] hand because he holds the time I don't
[1:12:52] know what the future holds but I know
[1:12:54] who holds the future so he who holds the
[1:12:57] future holds me
[1:13:00] why why should I think about setting
[1:13:03] forth this and that and the other other
[1:13:04] for the new year how many times we we
[1:13:08] know everybody first part of the year
[1:13:10] you want some good exercise equipment
[1:13:12] just wait till everything's broken
[1:13:16] I'm not talking about the equipment
[1:13:17] because it may not even be out of the
[1:13:18] box it may not have been used
[1:13:20] just wait till the Midway went to the
[1:13:23] garage sale in the summer then you could
[1:13:24] pick up some good equipment
[1:13:26] everybody make the New Year's
[1:13:28] resolutions no more Debbie cakes
[1:13:31] no more this
[1:13:39] oh man
[1:13:40] you say brother Samuel with that that
[1:13:43] that's kind of silly well listen I hear
[1:13:44] brother Brandon pray for a sister in the
[1:13:46] adoption part one and he asked God to
[1:13:48] help her to be able to lose weight
[1:13:52] so how you know what I've had to pray
[1:13:54] that many times
[1:13:55] we got quiet in here tonight he got
[1:13:58] quite I'm not saying that to be funny I
[1:14:01] transition to me when I hear things
[1:14:04] I'm listening to that that God cares
[1:14:07] about everything that sometimes the
[1:14:09] things that you might look at it may not
[1:14:11] be the well I need to really get down to
[1:14:13] size this and so it may not be that it
[1:14:16] might just be for the health part of it
[1:14:17] that in your life you might be in more
[1:14:20] control to surrender more to the Lord
[1:14:22] but God cares about those things
[1:14:26] so how do you know I've proved him and I
[1:14:28] know it
[1:14:30] so why should I think about setting
[1:14:32] forth this that and the other so I hope
[1:14:34] I didn't make nobody feel bad about your
[1:14:35] New Year's resolutions
[1:14:36] everybody today gonna go home tonight
[1:14:38] get that treadmill out honey get that
[1:14:41] elliptical out honey get that out
[1:14:44] make sure you're requesting it for
[1:14:45] yourself and not for your honey
[1:14:48] and we're praying for a different way
[1:14:49] for you
[1:14:50] I just put myself in his hands and walk
[1:14:55] like David did you realize that's what
[1:14:57] we have to do isn't that right brother
[1:14:59] Dave sometimes we can talk about putting
[1:15:01] situations in his hands but really the
[1:15:04] main thing that we need to put in his
[1:15:05] hands is the situation the need but we
[1:15:08] need to put ourselves because it's us
[1:15:10] that does the worry it's us that does
[1:15:12] the fretting it's us that does but but
[1:15:15] but what if this or or looking at it
[1:15:17] like this but if we can just put our
[1:15:19] self in his hands God knows our
[1:15:21] situations
[1:15:22] I just put myself in his hands and I
[1:15:25] walked like David did my time is in his
[1:15:27] hands knew that God held his future
[1:15:29] David didn't know what the future was
[1:15:32] but he know God had the future and I
[1:15:34] don't know what the future is none of us
[1:15:36] do but we know who holds the future
[1:15:40] listen David knew he had been anointed
[1:15:42] to be king he knew that that was a
[1:15:47] secret coming in his life he knew that
[1:15:50] the presence of God had moved down in
[1:15:53] his life and David knew that and he knew
[1:15:56] he's been anointed to be king and
[1:15:59] there's nothing going to take him away
[1:16:02] until that's been manifested let me tell
[1:16:05] you something you've been anointed for
[1:16:06] rapture
[1:16:07] you've been anointed you might say well
[1:16:09] what if I go before before the rest let
[1:16:13] me tell you you've been anointed blessed
[1:16:14] are they who die in the Lord they shall
[1:16:17] be of whom the second Death Shall Have
[1:16:19] No Power Over blessed are they who have
[1:16:22] part in the first resurrection what a
[1:16:24] blessing it is to be in Jesus Christ let
[1:16:26] me tell you something whether I go in
[1:16:28] Rapture or whether I go before it's just
[1:16:31] a blessing serving the lord and a joy to
[1:16:35] know him so what are you saying I'm
[1:16:38] saying I've not been defeat or Anointed
[1:16:41] with the spirit of fear of defeat or
[1:16:44] maybe but they're the spirit of God has
[1:16:47] anointed our lives with the certainty I
[1:16:50] can't lose
[1:16:52] I can't lose listen are you saying you
[1:16:55] haven't made no mistakes that's not what
[1:16:56] I'm saying I'm saying I can't lose
[1:16:58] because the most important battle has
[1:17:01] already been won and I have received a
[1:17:05] Divine impartation of that battle
[1:17:10] the victory has been released when he
[1:17:13] ascended up on high he gave out gifts
[1:17:15] what was those gifts he was imparting it
[1:17:18] was that part of himself as a Victor is
[1:17:21] coming on a Victorious parade we have
[1:17:23] received his life
[1:17:26] as it's been dispersed
[1:17:33] so God
[1:17:35] is a spirit
[1:17:38] and when we consider that these terms
[1:17:41] his hands it's God's dealing
[1:17:44] with us as Humanity
[1:17:47] his children in the Fulfillment of his
[1:17:49] word think of it this way in the message
[1:17:51] of personal experience with God
[1:17:54] brother Brahm says he has no hands
[1:17:57] but ours now
[1:17:59] when he walked on the shores of Galilee
[1:18:01] God came down created a body and God
[1:18:04] manifested himself through that body
[1:18:06] and what God did through Christ
[1:18:08] was displaying what God intended for
[1:18:10] every son and daughter of God to be
[1:18:13] a full-fledged child of God
[1:18:17] free
[1:18:18] from the world
[1:18:19] to be able to walk
[1:18:21] in a world of perfect faith remember
[1:18:23] like brother Daryl was reading from
[1:18:25] perfect Faith the last time how perfect
[1:18:27] Faith Masters every circumstance
[1:18:30] to me those quotes never get old
[1:18:34] they never get old it was just to me
[1:18:38] it's just inspiring how how the Lord was
[1:18:40] just bringing it last week and because
[1:18:42] how many times we've looked at things on
[1:18:44] the how and we don't know the how you're
[1:18:47] looking at a situation you think how
[1:18:50] right but perfect Faith does what it
[1:18:53] Masters the how
[1:18:55] it's not that how can come into a
[1:18:57] mountain but there is a Mastery over it
[1:18:59] puts it back in place
[1:19:01] my life's in his hands God's got this
[1:19:04] under control amen
[1:19:07] amen just like when that the situation
[1:19:08] when brother Brian senior came and
[1:19:10] knocked on the office last week and came
[1:19:12] in and the situation and you see and you
[1:19:15] hear of where things are at and I tell
[1:19:17] you the thing the burden that was so
[1:19:18] upon my heart was not just for her
[1:19:21] healing but the most important thing was
[1:19:22] I said God make a way
[1:19:25] that they can there could be that rest
[1:19:27] to where that soul
[1:19:29] can have that opportunity and so that's
[1:19:31] even on Friday night I was praying
[1:19:32] throughout the the time and then on
[1:19:34] Friday I had the young people we were
[1:19:35] praying together praying for that need
[1:19:37] before we started the Bible study ah to
[1:19:39] God be the glory amen
[1:19:42] oh my that there that God how everything
[1:19:44] just converts I don't have time to go
[1:19:46] through it it's a wonderful testimony
[1:19:48] but God has a way of lining everything
[1:19:50] up you know
[1:19:51] and so I just say it in this way he's
[1:19:54] here in spirit form no eyes but ours no
[1:19:57] ears but ours no tongue but ours so
[1:20:01] let's let him have everything
[1:20:04] The Secret of this is submitting
[1:20:07] yourself with Godly love into the hands
[1:20:10] of a loving father and letting him take
[1:20:13] you over
[1:20:15] Lord there's a situation on my job to
[1:20:17] submit yourself into his hands
[1:20:20] and let him take you over
[1:20:22] remember when brother Daryl came out and
[1:20:24] he gave the example and I've
[1:20:26] you know we it's one of those things I
[1:20:28] enjoy enjoy not just enjoy quoting it
[1:20:31] but you see the reality of it with a man
[1:20:33] he was trying to cast That cast that
[1:20:35] what he it was a spirit upon his wife
[1:20:37] that you know would start razzing him
[1:20:38] about going to a Pentecostal meeting and
[1:20:41] when you know he talked about what he
[1:20:42] was trying to do get her out in the
[1:20:43] middle of the floor and trying to cast
[1:20:44] the devil off of her and brother Brahm
[1:20:45] just told the brother his brother you're
[1:20:47] going about it all the wrong way
[1:20:49] brother Graham didn't say it won the
[1:20:50] spirit right
[1:20:52] right see he didn't say it on the spirit
[1:20:54] he just said you're going about it the
[1:20:55] wrong way why because look at the
[1:20:57] results
[1:20:58] look at the results was there a need
[1:21:00] there was a need but there is but The
[1:21:02] Way It Was going about it it would seem
[1:21:04] like that was the way never forget when
[1:21:07] you know you you hear
[1:21:09] um uh T Osborne give the testimony when
[1:21:12] brother Brown when the maniac came to
[1:21:13] the uh the platform and then we're all
[1:21:16] different you know I've prayed with a
[1:21:17] lot of brothers some brothers you know
[1:21:18] like I had one brother stood behind me
[1:21:20] in a prayer line he apologized to me so
[1:21:21] I'm sorry he said I beat you in the Back
[1:21:22] Eyes okay it's all right victories being
[1:21:25] won you know everybody's I mean
[1:21:26] everything's different you know you just
[1:21:28] you're going home but here's brother
[1:21:29] Brown I'm standing right here and T
[1:21:30] Osborne we're looking at this when this
[1:21:32] Maniac came up and they and and and here
[1:21:35] when when the Holy Spirit accepts that
[1:21:37] challenge and you know the story of
[1:21:39] where it goes down across the prophet's
[1:21:41] feet and then the liberty that comes in
[1:21:43] that building because the chief of that
[1:21:45] tribe of demon Saul
[1:21:47] that it's where the demons saw their
[1:21:49] Chief had been defeated not the physical
[1:21:51] man but the chief was in there
[1:21:53] right and they saw it been defeated and
[1:21:55] immediately when that they fled and when
[1:21:57] they fled notice brother Brown never had
[1:21:59] to come up and say you get off the cot
[1:22:00] you get out of the wheelchair you no
[1:22:02] what happened is when they saw that
[1:22:04] defeated then the rest of those demons
[1:22:06] scattered
[1:22:07] because see even in ranks there's
[1:22:09] rankings
[1:22:10] they knew they were defeated
[1:22:12] and the people just begin to get off the
[1:22:15] and everything else a different
[1:22:16] this is me and not just I don't just
[1:22:18] look at them as testimonies I look out
[1:22:20] on the house has God's desire to work
[1:22:22] through our lives then maybe you and I
[1:22:25] would look at it oh I gotta get this one
[1:22:26] off the car I gotta get this one out of
[1:22:27] the wheelchair I gotta get this no that
[1:22:29] didn't have to happen it's break that
[1:22:31] Spirit first
[1:22:34] and then I let God have his way
[1:22:36] brother Brown told that man he said go
[1:22:38] get it the next time get her a box of
[1:22:40] chocolates now I don't believe
[1:22:42] that you know was some special
[1:22:43] chocolates
[1:22:45] there's a lot can go through my mind
[1:22:46] right now some chocolates
[1:22:50] Lord help me
[1:22:51] I don't believe it was some special
[1:22:53] formula ingredient
[1:22:56] you say what was it it was the
[1:22:58] expression
[1:22:59] of love
[1:23:01] care
[1:23:04] that's what defeated the enemy let me
[1:23:06] tell you something you want to know what
[1:23:07] a defeat to hear me in your family in
[1:23:09] your home and on the job and everything
[1:23:11] else what will that be the expression of
[1:23:13] love and I would not be too big to ask
[1:23:16] God lord teach me how to love the right
[1:23:19] way
[1:23:20] help me Lord to see that in the right
[1:23:22] way because you know maybe someone
[1:23:24] didn't have that example but God ain't
[1:23:26] too big that he won't stoot down and
[1:23:29] teach you and I and say here let me put
[1:23:31] my hands on your life to show you
[1:23:36] I'm glad about that aren't you
[1:23:39] I'm glad he ain't too big brother Rocco
[1:23:41] I'm glad that God don't look down and
[1:23:42] say that's juvenile
[1:23:45] that's kindergarten I'm glad that God
[1:23:47] comes down he's still concerned about
[1:23:49] the ABCs
[1:23:52] I'm glad he's he's not too big that
[1:23:54] he'll come now and begin to take things
[1:23:56] or we can look at and say Lord I thought
[1:23:58] I had this figured out but I realized
[1:24:00] that I ain't even close
[1:24:06] Abraham says when God
[1:24:08] in the message greatest Valor fought
[1:24:09] when God can get a man in his hands
[1:24:12] so he can get his senses
[1:24:14] conscience everything cleaned out
[1:24:16] until it stands with God behind it in
[1:24:18] the spirit there's not a devil in the
[1:24:21] world can poke a doubt in there
[1:24:23] that's right he can come around and say
[1:24:25] you don't feel any better
[1:24:29] but what's behind there Faith a life
[1:24:33] that is in God's hands
[1:24:37] and I'll tell you God's hands are active
[1:24:41] God operates with his hands God molds us
[1:24:44] God shapes us God upholds us with his
[1:24:47] hands
[1:24:48] oh don't you love him tonight
[1:24:51] oh my
[1:24:53] think of that
[1:24:55] in job 23 and let me just close here
[1:24:57] we'll just stop here tonight
[1:25:00] Lord willing that we'll start picking up
[1:25:02] those hands
[1:25:03] but notice job said here and what our
[1:25:06] text was
[1:25:07] verse 9 on the left hand
[1:25:10] where he does work
[1:25:12] but I can't Behold Him I cannot proceed
[1:25:16] what's taking place
[1:25:18] he hideth himself
[1:25:21] on the right hand
[1:25:23] I'm not seeing any manifestation
[1:25:27] that I cannot see him
[1:25:30] but nonetheless
[1:25:32] I'm in his hands
[1:25:34] came back I may not know what's going on
[1:25:36] I may not even understand it I'm just
[1:25:39] reading just going over some more of the
[1:25:41] quotes you remember how we've read that
[1:25:42] about with the stats Cliff when the
[1:25:45] angel of the Lord told Brother Brown
[1:25:46] Don't Go Over There that's the hand of
[1:25:47] the Lord
[1:25:48] you know how it is sometimes you read
[1:25:51] across a quote here this evening just
[1:25:54] just looking at some things and
[1:25:55] remember when that was told don't go
[1:25:57] there don't rebuke it it's the hand of
[1:25:59] the Lord and brother Brown goes on to
[1:26:00] tell
[1:26:01] on tape in different places
[1:26:04] if you just look up hand to the Lord he
[1:26:06] begins to talk about what he speaks to
[1:26:08] the stancilar family he said look he
[1:26:10] says
[1:26:11] you don't know what would have laid down
[1:26:13] later in life
[1:26:15] but the brand even talks about that for
[1:26:17] his own children
[1:26:18] little Sharon when she was taking what
[1:26:20] what what what might have come later
[1:26:21] down in life for her maybe a road that
[1:26:24] she would have crossed in it
[1:26:27] but if God knows what's best
[1:26:30] a lot of things don't make sense to us
[1:26:31] and brother Brahm says it like this if I
[1:26:33] can remember the exact words Ram says
[1:26:35] like this when the angel of the Lord
[1:26:36] told him that don't touch it it's the
[1:26:38] hand of the Lord but remember say oh
[1:26:39] this is going to go over real good
[1:26:41] think about you have to tell the mother
[1:26:44] where the doctor has let that baby stay
[1:26:46] there for two days
[1:26:48] and you have to be the one to call and
[1:26:50] say
[1:26:51] it's the hand of the Lord
[1:26:53] I'm not to come there
[1:26:56] I don't just look at the one to have to
[1:26:57] be there to stand and tell it to me and
[1:27:00] when I think of that right now it causes
[1:27:01] my toes to curl up
[1:27:03] and I don't just say that it's true but
[1:27:05] I think about on the other end of
[1:27:07] receiving that
[1:27:10] to be able to receive that that's right
[1:27:14] and this is where the member sister
[1:27:15] stats Cliff asked the question
[1:27:17] and she was so troubled I must not have
[1:27:19] had faith for the Branham if I'd have
[1:27:22] had faith
[1:27:23] God would have raised her up raised up
[1:27:25] my baby
[1:27:26] I love I'm so glad this was put in the
[1:27:28] message amen I'm glad this was put on
[1:27:30] tape
[1:27:32] but he told sister staff with no
[1:27:34] you've got great faith
[1:27:36] because even when God decided to take
[1:27:39] your baby you've stood Hallelujah
[1:27:44] why I'm in his hands I don't know when I
[1:27:48] can't hold myself he's holding me
[1:27:52] because sometimes I feel I feel in
[1:27:55] control I feel pretty good but I've
[1:27:56] realized I'll just tell you I've
[1:27:58] realized that's the most dangerous time
[1:28:00] for Samuel Browning when I feel like
[1:28:02] that I'm I'm in control you might feel
[1:28:03] like you're on a Mountaintop but that's
[1:28:05] the time I need a most because it's no
[1:28:07] Marvel I need him when I'm down in the
[1:28:09] valley
[1:28:10] but it's the part about when I feel that
[1:28:12] I'm up here that's when I really need
[1:28:14] him most that's when I'm the most
[1:28:16] vulnerable
[1:28:19] aren't you glad your life is in his
[1:28:21] hands
[1:28:22] [Applause]
[1:28:26] amen hallelujah musicians come
[1:28:29] amen Benjamin if you could play that
[1:28:32] song my life is in his hands
[1:28:34] amen just thinking of that song
[1:28:37] I'll tell you tonight if your life's not
[1:28:39] in His Hands it'd be a good time to put
[1:28:41] it in his hands
[1:28:42] it'd be a real good time it just
[1:28:45] remember
[1:28:46] whatever little you have don't let the
[1:28:48] devil shame you because of your little
[1:28:50] faith or little this or little that let
[1:28:52] me tell you something there's a God here
[1:28:54] that can take little things
[1:28:57] and turn them into big things
[1:29:01] Matthew remember when we were out there
[1:29:02] last week out there Gathering little
[1:29:04] Twigs on fire remember that
[1:29:07] we had that little fire the fire going
[1:29:09] in our fire pit Matthew and Zachary came
[1:29:11] out there and helped me
[1:29:14] handed some things off to Matthew
[1:29:16] pulling out little little you know when
[1:29:18] you do trimmings around your house and
[1:29:20] stuff like that you put a little I put a
[1:29:21] little pile so I can get it little twigs
[1:29:23] and stuff
[1:29:24] grab the hold of that man I told Matthew
[1:29:27] I said you know I
[1:29:28] a big piece of wood in there they ain't
[1:29:30] catch a fire and they're not about to
[1:29:32] catch one
[1:29:34] but you know what you know what a fire
[1:29:35] starts with
[1:29:36] he starts with little things
[1:29:38] and I told him on the way back up there
[1:29:40] I said now that'll preach
[1:29:42] it just takes Little Things
[1:29:44] brother Brown says you want a Revival he
[1:29:46] said you'll be the Revival
[1:29:48] you let Revival start in Europe you want
[1:29:52] to see change well I want to see
[1:29:54] changing my own let it start in you
[1:29:55] whatever little it is put it in God's
[1:29:59] hands
[1:30:00] don't be ashamed let me tell you
[1:30:03] something that's what Satan would want
[1:30:04] to do he wants to try to shame you
[1:30:07] it is in God who makes you feel ashamed
[1:30:10] it's Satan that wants to try to make you
[1:30:12] feel ashamed brother Samuel what can I
[1:30:14] do
[1:30:15] the greatest honor to take him at his
[1:30:17] word and say Lord this is so small and I
[1:30:21] put it in your hands tonight and make
[1:30:23] that decoration if you don't if you're
[1:30:26] not giving your life to God give it to
[1:30:28] the Lord tonight put it in your sins
[1:30:30] Lord I need the Holy Ghost I need more
[1:30:32] than just a Justified life to where I'd
[1:30:35] accept you as a savior but all kinds of
[1:30:38] habits in my life I need Lord a real
[1:30:40] cleansing a real Deliverance Lord I Need
[1:30:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:30:47] don't struggle with it
[1:30:49] he said if you ask the father
[1:30:54] he said if a son goes to a father and
[1:30:56] says give me a piece of bread he said
[1:30:59] the father won't turn around to that son
[1:31:01] and give him a stone
[1:31:03] look at that and if we in the natural
[1:31:06] know how to give good gifts
[1:31:08] how much more the heavenly father when
[1:31:12] we ask him and that's where Jesus said
[1:31:14] if you ask him for the Holy Ghost
[1:31:16] you don't have to beg him you don't have
[1:31:18] to plead just asking
[1:31:21] say Lord I'm ready to accept the Holy
[1:31:25] Ghost
[1:31:25] and just let him move down in your life
[1:31:28] that's the testimony and watch where
[1:31:31] your life will be
