Oh God so thankful Lord for your mercy we love you Lord Jesus blessed be the name of the law god bless you tonight my own in my own I sound like I believe sound like I'm on you can hear me I can't hear me I need I know nobody had my microphone so these things up here are not for looks we didn't we need to use them so we need to get me something here in these monitors it's good to be back I just we just had such a wonderful time in the way I don't want to delay at all I want to go ride it and get right into some of the testimonies here tonight but if we could let's open our Bibles and go right to the Acts of the 14th chapter I have it up here also on the screen should give me VGA 1 VGA one place and I want to go right to here on the screen in acts 14 and 19 through 21 the Bible says and there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium who persuaded the people and having stone Paul drew him out of the city supposing he had been dead howbeit as the disciple stood round about him he rose up and came into the city and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derby and when they had preached the gospel to that City and had taught many they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch confirming I want you to watch what they did confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God and when they had ordained them elders in every city and had prayed with fasting they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed and and after they had passed through Cydia they came to Pamphylia and when they had preached the word in purga they went down to italia and they and they sent sail to Antioch from whence they had read had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they had fulfilled and and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles and I want you just to notice that in verse 27 we can read that again and when they were come and had gathered the church together they rehearsed all that God had done with them it's nothing that we have done of our own accord we are as just simply tools in God's hands and so this is what Paul this is what this is what they are exhorting to the to the church that they've called together they rehearse all that God had done with them and how he had opened the door faith unto the Gentiles and there they abode long time with the disciples amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'm sorry I forgot to put that slide next and you were just looking up there sorry about that sometimes it just takes me getting used to this and I've had to rotate it back and forth on this trip I want to just just look at a few things here because that's what I really feel this scripture was very it stood out to me about a month a month or so or two before we ever made our journey to the Philippines and I just loved that scripture in verse 27 that when they had called the church together and truly the Church of the Living God we realized it's not it's not a building it's more it's more than a building because we realized that there what you and I have here and are able to come together and we have a place that's called a church building but yet it wasn't until 300 years later after the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ and Pentecost where they actually had a church building they met in public houses and places like that so we realized that the church it was gathering together the believers and to think that what makes a believer a believer because they believe and and recognize that they the the very presence of the Living God personally with with our lives and it does something within our hearts when we hear testimonies of God's working there's ways that God will work through testimonies and as myrrh though our situation some of the details sometimes might be a little different but God is still the same God it's the same way with every experience there's not one experience that is exactly the same as far as the journey but as far as the experience of passing from death unto life that is the same but so we look at it into our hearts and our desire as believers is always to see the Lord Jesus Christ to see him glorified among his people and so when I look at this I think of the general orders that are given that still applied to us today as the Church of the Living God where Jesus said go you into the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and I if I could be very clear he never said go and play the gospel jesus never intended here that there's to be tape recorders sent out and then we substitute the preaching but the preaching of the gospel is what is still the the God's Way in delivering the word to his people we thank God for the message we thank God for the tapes and I believe that when we really have a real understanding of it and to recognize that it it's not it's not something different if it is it's outside of the scriptures but it's the continuity of the same Holy Ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost and the way that he worked there and has worked out through the ages he's still working the same way tonight so it's the general orders that are given to the Church of the Living God and here's here's the verse 17 and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover so then after the Lord had spoken unto them he was received up into heaven and sat on the right hand of God and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them and confirming the word with signs following this is one scripture that has so stood out to me when I was just just texting my wife just in regards to the the events that were transpiring in in the end the trip here to the Philippines I said this is this is exactly what I can just say is the Lord is present working with us confirming his word and we just we just seen confirmation after confirmation and God's working and I will just share some of those things tonight I want to just look at this scripture as well because I when I tie this in for a mission report I just don't want it to be of pictures but there's a there's a thought within it as well and we remember when the Lord Jesus is speaking of the coming of the Holy Spirit which remember that the the coming of the Holy Ghost to the believer was the reality that Jesus Christ himself had now been seated on the right hand of God so now all what he had declared all power in heaven and earth is given unto me now here it comes to be witnessed personally to the believer that the word that's been spoken is now comfort abiding in their hearts they walked with him upon the earth they were with him wherever he went they fellas shipped with him but now the very same one that they had fellowship with the very same one whom when John would say our hands have handled the word of life now that same God that had come down and dwelled among them that same God was now living on the inside of them and this is the promise where Jesus said when the Spirit of Truth has come in verse 13 he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me very clear anything that takes away from the deity of Jesus Christ and from Jesus Christ being preeminent and from him being seated on the right hand of God is not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is still glorifying the atoning work of the Lamb God and that glorification is that he is the same God in every way in every characteristic his nature has never changed and the greatest place for God to glorify this working is in the hearts and lives of his people where it manifests through our lives that indeed the victory and the answer of what all has been longing for has come into the heart of the believer and that the victory of Calvary and the resurrection is manifested through the life of the believer that he indeed has triumph over every principality and over every power and now that same life inside of us as believers it manifests and declares that indeed Jesus Christ is the Lord that's what the atoning work of Calvary does when God has done such a work and you can testify this in your life to where that the Holy Spirit takes alive and he begins to take a hold of that life and God will touch that life and even when God touches it sometimes he's not filled it all the way but he'll touch that life to let them know that I am alive and well because you cannot receive anything that you don't first believe in you don't go to a doctor and wonder if they're a doctor you go there you go there and here they are in the building and you believe when I go there they're gonna be able to help me and that's why you tell them Oh doctor I've got a pain here doctor I'm feeling like this here doctor I'm here you don't you don't go to the doctor and say are you able to help me you go they're already seen as a measure of faith and that's the same thing that when we approach and how God will touch a life and the whole thing got dealing with the life sometimes it's the genuine Holy Ghost the Living God with the purpose that God Himself who fully come into that individual and when God comes fully into a life that life will glorify Jesus Christ he becomes the center of that life through and through every decision then centers around Jesus Christ it's a real evident key of being filled with the Holy Ghost he shall glorify me see even when the Holy Ghost has come and something is wrong and here were convicted we repent why do we repent because the Holy Ghost inside of us that life there's the desire to please the Lord and if there's anything although it may not be something out here it might be something in here that may be a motive of thought and attitude something deep within that isn't even seen out here but yet the Holy Spirit will bring that conviction as a son and daughter of God because our desire is that he would be glorified and that's why the promises as he keeps his word the Spirit of Truth leads us into all truth not just mysteries but into all truth in our life why we do this why we do that it gets down into the heart and the matter of motives and objectives and all these things so he declares himself to be the same as the mighty conqueror elect how Paul says it here when he speaks giving a word of witness to the to the people how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by him by them that heard him God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and the divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will all of this is God confirming his presence coming through his word you believe that God when you when we read in the book of Acts you find how God worked marvelously in in different instances God knew exactly how to get his word to every heart there's there's miracles and there's things that were done and even in times to where God would see that those who are hindering were moved out of the way that the word could reach to this individual it just is something when we read the Word of God it's not just a book to us but we recognize this is God's pattern and we can have a faith in a rest in God know that God is working just like brother Shane when he prayed here tonight that even as we're praying for our loved ones in different ones many times we don't see God working we don't feel God working but God is working if you could see it or you could feel it it would not require faith we don't pray more desperately when we see God working we should have the same desperation in prayer when we don't see anything moving at all why because he promised and he cannot fail that's the fervent prayer of a righteous man Oh are there things sometimes that look discouraging to us absolutely there's things that happen that seem discouraging but in all things God cannot fail and I just think of this I don't want to read this whole part but how that Paul makes mention here in the book of Titus of what God had hidden within in himself in in the beginning Paul speaks of how that this hope of eternal life which God and verse 2 cannot lie promised before the world began but half in due times manifested his word through preaching God still manifest his word through preaching sick are healed through the preaching of the world Devils are cast out through the preaching of the word sick is healed through the preaching of the word hallelujah the Holy Ghost is poured out through the preaching of the word because the real preaching of the word is the preaching of the atoning work of the Lamb of God and the ministering of that is its finished no matter what the situation is it's finished he's already overcome he doesn't have to go to Calvary once again it's already the Bible says while Jesus was here walking upon this earth before every went to Calvary the Bible says he bore our sickness the Lambourn or sickness before every went to Calvary not some not partial all sickness hey man Isaiah 53 makes it real to our heart by His stripes we were healed there right not just some healing because of its just healing of some diseases then we have to strike away and say he was only bruised for some of our iniquities but the Bible said he was proves for our iniquities the entirety of it it's the same way with every sickness and every disease Oh glory it always declares Jesus Christ to be the mighty Conqueror I just want to move through this scriptures here here was Peter once again rehearsing the working of the Lord among the believers remember when they they came into among the Gentiles first with Cornelius and here was Peter with some of the Jews that were with him and now they've returned back to Jerusalem and the Bible says in verse 4 that last verse Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by the order unto them and I want you to notice in verse 18 of this slide it says and when they heard these things on the outpouring of the Holy Ghost when they heard these things they held their peace and glorified God saying then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life a believer will always recognize Jesus Christ what because what he does once he'll do again and again and again and again and when Peter rehearsed it it was the same pattern that happened to them and they could say that's the same God that's the same God working so we look at this here when when brother Jerry and I arrived I didn't know I just I just found this today I didn't know what the typhoon was but when we came in here you know when anything you do for the Lord how many you know that that Satan's always there to try to disturb it now what we ran into we're getting ready to land here in in in in in Japan in Tokyo that's where it's supposed to land over here and in Tokyo well we didn't know this typhoon was here now they had already just had a typhoon and I didn't even know this before we got there and there's been a high death toll before we ever got there of the typhoon that had just passed a week before that I didn't even know that I'm glad I didn't know it beforehand say the truth I didn't really find that out to the day but this typhoon what happened is is that our plane was trying to come in to land there and and and it got to a place those of you who's been on a plane before it got to a place where the runway I could see the white lines out there that's how close we were to the ground and about that time he just pulled the plane and we were back up in the air didn't even land it and and I could we could fill it coming down and it was you know even when you wrote on planes and enough and he'd be stilled you don't like filling that and we did that he tried to do that two other times we had to fly to another place I think it was is it Haneda there it's an airport just 30 miles or 30 minutes away by flight we landed there but they didn't let us get off of that airplane we had to set there for three hours so we were already on that flight what was it almost 14 hours on that flight 14 hours and then we had three hours setting there then they finally said we're gonna take you back to Tokyo and we're gonna try to get you off of there and so forth when we got back we had missed our flight so when we got there you know they said we're gonna have everything taken care of and so forth we got there I'm gonna come up on my phone on my on my Delta app is your next flight is Sunday morning at 9:30 I said that's unacceptable that's unacceptable and you know it had nothing to do with about staying overnight in Tokyo there weren't one thing brother Jerry can testify to this that he and I we never talked about we're gonna have to sleep in the airport tonight because they already told us that because of this this typhoon that water was just the buses and everything else had shut down in Tokyo and all the hotels were filled and people weren't going anywhere so you know with in at all that was not even the thought but the thought was we've got an appointment on Sunday morning he's gonna have to preach somewhere and I've got to preach somewhere this is not acceptable now that's where all my urgency became and upon us working and you know through the praying you know brother Jerry was doing the praying and I was doing the action I was the action behind the string you know the Lord you know we sit there and I sit there and God provided where I could get a delta rep on the phone because nobody there was helping us in the right way you know and III they were able to arrange a flight and everything and get us so that the next day we would be able to fly out of Tokyo in the morning flower to Shanghai and then from Shanghai we could fly down into Manila and get there on Saturday evening so we could be there for Sunday so I really thank God for making that available but this was the thing about it now I didn't get this air mattress that's a cardboard box that was my tempur-pedic mattress right there when I didn't get that till 3:00 a.m. now no you can't see you see brother Jerry's feet right here brother Jerry got one seat because everybody else was already everybody else's flights were so you had people you know that we're just taking up three and four seats and laying down you know they were just thinking about themselves and so brother Jerry is sitting there you know in the chair and there was and and I was down there I just had late on that low Liam floor I didn't even have that sleeping bag I just made my my backpack my pillow and you know yours on and off snoozing but finally at any rate thank God that God had kept us through that night and so we just we thank God for that that was a little bit of a brother Jerry said of the times I've been here he said I've never experienced going through this you know and that's the first time I think I had stayed over in an airport but but the Lord was was mindful and and helped us through it so here we come on Sunday morning and brother Jerry preached at brother Roel Soriano's he preached there on the Sunday morning and I was to preach at brother ray Soriano's brother Rho elz brother at elect bride assembly so I don't have any pictures when brother Jerry didn't have any they're from brother oels but this here is his brother brother ray Soriano and here at his assembly and I included two pictures that he sent me because on this when we were there he took off on a mission trip right after this this time here it was a day later he took off into I think it's called be cool be cool he took off and he bad they baptized 16 souls so they went right on a mission trip right from there and he baptized 16 Souls so they're very much working in in in the mission work that's going on right there and as I was as I was there you know with within the church this brother Oh L had shared something and I just wanted to share this with you brother Oh L had shared something with me just very briefly he was talking about how that you know brother ray in them he said they he said they just you know he said they they've just been disappointed they they need a church building well when I was there I went into the office and I thought you know what i was already resting at this is what i'm going to preach today and as i'm sitting there I gave brother brother ray my title and then brother wrinkles out and gives it to them on the internet and he comes back in a few minutes before I'm going to walk out and I said dude you mind I said we're gonna have to change that title I said because I've had a change here and the Lord just dropped in my heart just a scripture and we just preached from that scripture delight thyself in the Lord and he shall give me the desires of that word and we just just just preached it just just some things that the Lord brought together and just going through the scriptures with it and and and I had no idea you know brother Ola had just mentioned just you know just talking just mentioned very briefly but I had no idea the details but when I came out of there and I'm having to step over over people to even get in there to to the pulpit and there's like 300 some people there and they and as I'm ministering the word of the Lord it just things just start coming out and strikes me and I just said you need a they're building you need another place God's gonna give you another place and we begin to just just how the Holy Spirit was take it then I began to didn't examples begin to come to me of how God brought us to this point as an assembly there were things that begin to come out that I had never even thought of or put together and the long story short when I come out of it and coming out of this service one thing that they that the church and I put this in there just from the book of Acts and I'm going to read it but the Bible talks about how that the church itself was edified and I can tell you right now I had no idea of the things that they had went through with this property or this or that I had no idea about that but God did and God knew exactly what they had need of and it went on beyond just that of a church building and things in that nature but God knew exactly what those people had need of and God I tell you how mindful God is God was so mindful of the needs of the people that God he would allow me to think I'm going to preach something and then I get a few minutes from walking out and then I'm just writing down scriptures to walk out and preach those scriptures and bring that God knows what he's doing the people afterwards you know here we are I'm sitting with the Brethren they're there you know they they have a little place off in the second floor and I'm there with the Brethren and we were just fellowshipping and the Brethren were so the church different ones kept saying brother you'd have no idea today of the things that were were ministered and were spoken God knows that we needed that encouragement and you know the whole focus that they caught out of it because they hadn't pulled back from from from doing the work of the Lord but the whole focus came in is that whatever desire that you have first of all delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart that's first delight myself in the Lord then ever God will make everything else go bring everything else in order and they really just the Holy Spirit just took that and and brought that you know among among the people right after this we came brother Jerry and I we had Monday Monday we had we had off and we could kind of trying to reclaim some rests from what we missed on the trip and then we started in on Tuesday we had to make the trip to tag a tie which is about well I don't know exactly how many miles or kilometers it's when you talk in the terms of the Philippines of traveling you never talk in terms of kilometers or miles you're talking how long it's going to take you because they're naturally to get here I would say probably from Manila to Taggart I where we had to go it would might be the distance I don't even know if I'd save the distance from here to Sandusky I think that'd be too far but it took every bit I think of three hours for us to get there little more than three hours so we're up early on Tuesday brother Boyd when the deccan we he's been brother Jerry and I there so that when we get there then we're ready to step in on Tuesday they've already started getting a retreat together and let me just just move on here you find this here taggi tie is is like a it's like a tourist place a very very beautiful place right here brother Jerry brother Roy and myself larache taking a picture right here in front of a volcano this whole this whole Lake is actually a big crater but that's an active volcano right there it was actually as I had a little bit of smoke coming out of it when we were there but I mean when I say active it happened I think it been a hundred years but they kept talking about there was smoke and things coming out of this so it was this place to me was just it was beautiful and this is kind of a little thing but right along these areas right here where we're standing right here they have places like this Starbucks you can sit down and you could look out there tap volcano they have Starbucks there that you know that they're bigger than Bob Evans here they're the size of them and things you know and they love coffee over there they love coffee you know but they did this is a it's a real beautiful area a tagging time very beautiful area and that's where they had the youth retreat at and you can just see just some of the pictures of places like a very much of a resort area here is the the retreat and the training center that there were they held held the retreat and we're arriving there there's brother LL and sister Chi Chi and brother Jerry we're getting all checked in and trying to get things established with the schedule where we're at and I just say it like this that you know a brother Jerry and I that's the second trip that we've been on together but it's been such a blessing to to be able to work with him and I don't say that because he's here and I don't say it because he's my brother I say it because it's true because it's it's nice when you come in to them it's nice when you have ministry where you can work together sometimes you'll find out say well who's preaching with me and you find out say that way you know you're all going to be pulling the same direction you know and and and brother Jerry and and and I just was just like you know we were able to just just going back and forth you know between one another brother Jerry he took the the evening services at the retreat the preaching services and how many services what was due preached to evening in one morning three services he had to preach in in those in that time the burden that that where my part was is the teaching I had to two one-hour teaching sessions each of those days ahead so the two four sessions and then they had the questions and answer session the last day so we we laid in some things you see the musicians that are there these actually are some one of them's a pastor from one of the local groups they're around taggi ty and they've they put together the music and you know set everything up for that and you see just some of the young the young people that have gathered there and this is something I don't know if this have been I think this is the one you got that on the podium one this is one of those slides that's going to kick in sir she said not yet but I said you get the Holy Ghost first and you tell me what a husband because remember it's God fries so this seeking is this this is Europe you see some of the teaching we started out the first session their only love courtship and marriage and just going through some things with them on the vows everything comes through headship as well so we were doing some teaching there with them on that and then I don't know if this is I don't think I have the one in here of you and your preaching but brother Jerry was coming right back around there young people just so responded to the word of the Lord this is the first night I believe when brother Jerry spoken brother Jerry gave his testimonies of how God where he stood you know with the the truth and and and knowing that the message was the truth but coming to see and my a part of it in my apartment and he brought he brought the testimony from being a pastor son well we didn't know but there's a lot within this gathering here there was a lot of pastors children and so after this in those of you that's been to the Ruth retreats this is very much tailored like the winter youth retreated by the poem for the Barry except there's a lot more sessions in here as far as preaching and teaching a lot more but during their morning devotions from 6:00 to 7:00 this is what they would discuss and that was one of the things that came out is this was first service even of the impact of how things were even the clarity even on the teaching that was done on the vows and the courtship and so forth and then this of how that it's so touched those as pastors children how they were touched and their hearts they were very much moved within that so we just thank God for that this another the teaching session I think this was the second day and we just just dealing with this part on the duality of person that you have the outer man you have the inner man the inner man is to be strengthened and how that you have this the constant how your walk in the Lord and how God has has placed you in this life the things that you have to tend to as far as even with your work getting your schooling and yet balancing all that that it that you have to rely not on the outer man but rely on the inner man and the way the Lord had brought that here within it I end up taking two parts on this because with many of it you a lot of these young people they go they're going to school they're getting educated so then the way that we were dealing with this part you have that part and some of the young people here they've they've they probably may recognize the slide they've heard this when they were in my basement so a lot of these things that I've taught over there everything I taught the young people here have already heard it and seen this but it was you know in in regards to where even though you might have a master's degree and your pastor may not even have a high school education your ability to receive you do not receive based on your degree you receive and you recognize God by the eyes of your heart so you never ever ever say well this person doesn't have the status I have maybe I can't receive from that no you recognize the skills God's placed within you and just like I told them as I told the young people here God does not put you in earth in this earth without skills already laying within you that you come to the realization of what he's put in you and then you have that through schooling that refines those skills so we dealt with that then here here's here we are at the banquet they had this banquet on Tuesday night remember we still have one more day left here so they had this on Tuesday night that's brother le he drove us around and sometimes the first night we got there brother brother Alwyn he picked this up at the airport I thought we were in a race yeah I told Jerry I'm sitting in the backseat and I said man I said you know what I knew his gonna get the hit Jerry says because you weren't sitting in the front seat he said I know he said we came that close to their motorbikes you know there's no such things as Road lines you just you know they take four lanes of traffic I make a claims out of it you know so here they're giving presentations here in the banquet night and they had made some presentations and you know brother Jerry got his diploma as well we're thankful he graduated now and so he you know and brother Jerry we're going through this banquet of them brother Jerry you can see they've put the podium now into the hall where we hate at and brother Jerry's gonna preach that night and brother Jerry just preached a masterpiece that night about midnight and how that you know midnight in only lasts and there's one minute the one minute that follows it there's a freedom and God just Marvis Lee moved among the young people in that night everything itself there was a building that was taking place within these services here and and this was a young lady her name is DJ and she gave a testimony and the testimony she gave was in in the meeting one of the services and I think it was it might have been this I don't know it was the first day of the second day I don't remember I think was it might have been the second day where I was teaching and just some things as I had was in the middle of teaching and we got into a spot about the tests and trials of life and how it was just something how the Holy Spirit just honed right in and I was right there right beside her and just looking right at her and talking to her and I had no idea what she had just went through but then she gave that she gives this testimony and what the testimony was is how that here she is she's listening to a message but the Brennan was speaking and she's she's come up she's you know she's having to study in Manila away from her family and and and and and she's the doctors have diagnosed her that she has all over her ovaries and things be just covered with tumors it she's just just just in a bad condition on she's listening to a message and she's just looking to the Lord and she said on that message he said brother Branham calls out the color a dress that I'm wearing and he said he calls out on there and then he called out the condition that I was just diagnosed with she said right there she said as I was listening to them message she said I knew that that was my healing so this had just taken place just you know just a some days before and in the way that this as it came down and where she began to weep is because as the Lord began to tell her that the things that God has just brought you through and what you have come through is not about you it's a testimony for his glory that you might be able to share with us I had no idea but God knew that she shared it with brother o-l afterwards and brother Rowell shared it with with with brother Jerry myself then she gave a testimony that night and so you know you just see how God just just working there here's brother Jerry preaching that night and within the service you see a little bit more of the setup there here's the questions and answers part of the youth retreat so brother J myself are going back and forth and and brother o L in answering questions and man the questions just one started and then it just one right after another but I want to make this statement you see right here brother Gerry preached a message right here and he took they took the thought at thy word Lord will launch out to the deep and I watched how God masterfully took the word and just this was the last morning this was not a night service and the reason I make that statement is because it just doesn't have to be a night service when God moves God moves when he moves brother Jerry and I he can testify to this he had the same function in his heart he and I were setting at breakfast before we ever got here this morning and we were up you know were up early setting down there and drinking our coffee and things and we had received I had received a question that was passed over to me in the banquet and every question that that that we had it was something that I thought the jury and I kind of talked about him in the room that night and I said my eyes and I just we need the wisdom of God and how to how to approach this and so we went to bed that night he didn't know that brother oh ellan them here they were brother Roy had went back to the campground there was a situation that Harry was in counseling and dealing with and then it had him up high he couldn't sleep throughout the night because it was such a need that was there and before they ever came down to breakfast it just just the witness of the Holy Ghost of my heart it just said I'm not finished here yet and then you know brother Owen them came down and they were sharing as far as you know they just did just just you know had a hard time sleeping that night so forth and brother brother Jerry and I we got back up the room and I spoke that to brother Jerry he had the same witness of the Holy Spirit as well we prayed right there in that hotel room the power of God came right down in that room when he walked there to the platform after or up here right here after we had questions and answers you see these young people and this was a picture that sister chichi took this was this was afterwards I had a deed these were some of the latter people that I was praying for there was people all through there but then the one need that was there that a lot of these things there was so many needs I didn't you just you have that feeling there's needs there's deliverances it's needed there's there is a lives to be filled with the Holy Ghost and here with brother Jerry he'd just finished at the end and it just gives that little call I'll tell you what there were young people that couldn't wait to get out of their seats and oh and one individual where the enemy had so tied them up Satan was just dismantled in that service I mean dismantled I set back there and I'm sitting back there watching him preach I said I was sitting I said Satan your kingdoms coming down it was being dismantled one right after another I tell you it was just it was awesome to behold and that life I tell you what the one that young lady I told brother Jerry we went eight after this and then we came back you know to be with the young people here we came back into that room after we got done eatin and I told brother Jerry I said that young lady I said this is the first time I said she got joy on her face you could see her she would just feel with joy how god it's so moved on the scene of course these are activities then you know with the young people and brother oil and we we got in on the activities what the young people had a good time there and then of course brother Jerry and I'm Jerry Jerry said I need to step out here for some fresh air because they got stuffy well they love photos Filipinos love photos I think they're the ones who invented selfies and I'm really being serious about that brother Rowland I was talked about but we moved from here they wanted to take pictures you know and if we move just a little bit here was another round I told your acid journey if we move any more it's a new pose let's not move let's just do what we can you know to stay here but then we come to the convention here in Manila and this is back where all the believers come together there's multiple conventions going on at this time from what I understand but in November first they have it there all the people are off because during November first from November October 31st through November first all the people travel back to their home provinces and they go out into the graveyards and in the graveyards they drink and play cards and they're having a reunion with their people who's passed on so that's a big thing so they go back to their provinces and and so here that's why they have the fellowship on November 1st because everybody's off to work it's such a it's a national holiday so you here we are that the overcomer Worship Center this is brother Royals home church and we're actually going to have it right there in that building yeah this is how it looked before we went to the youth retreat they had already brought the pews out of the church and got them out there so that then they could set them up out here this is used as a parking garage as well during a normal Sunday because they just don't have anywhere to park the cars so here they are they've got to get all this together and in order and the brothers had it in order by the time we got back they had it in order this is what it looked like down down the street I only got why I only got the shot going one way I didn't I wasn't able to get a shot going the other way but this was all the believers that had come in there was a bus that come in from fungus and I a whole group of believers that came in for the convention that day so it these are just cars a believers going that way and then the other one so here is the here's the gathering of believers you can you could see that they're just I'll move to the pictures here these are just as their as together there's a little bit of a different angle there this whole area right here there were people inside the church because they can open the door so they can look out as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] yeah yes sir yes [Applause] [Music] yes sir yes sir yes Amen all right come on [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen I thought I was getting another clip that he said before too and I realized I wasn't recording I apologized to him already I'm sorry for the big map that was rejoicing and recording I was having a good time when he was preaching man the whole theme was the final voice to the final age so we had that brother Jerry preached the morning service and then the evening service we administered and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh yeah the thing and I know I know I mentioned this to you all the last time but that what happened but what the whole the building that we've been looking at this hole right here brother browning the church here we were we also were a part of this right here of seeing that that property and that that building would be acquired I think I mentioned it to you on the last time that the building that was their brother browning here in the church as an assembly we to see that that property when that that we're preaching in right now that's adjacent to the church that that property was was secured and they built in that the structure on it that now that they have the meetings in as well as the fellowship hall and that's what we're preaching right now is that clear okay I think I'd shared that with you before [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that night that that that evening service we preached I just took a just a simple thought the Lord had given me that previous Sunday come back home and I just preached that on the sons of God come back home and so we just we ministered that night and right here brother Jerry and the other ministers I just had just it felt letting my heart to to make a call for lives that wanted to surrender their lives hearts that wanted to receive the Holy Ghost come fully back home and and just it just the response were we had the people right there and lives that just had responded to the word and wanted to come come back home produções coming home hearts to be filled with the Spirit of God so here we are we prayed out I don't even know how long that we we prayed there that that that evening for the different needs it just seemed like there was they were already there all across and then it just kept coming down the aisle kept coming down the aisle to be prayed for and different needs and the different brothers I wanted the ministering that we're up there and those that were out I wanted everybody the ministry to come and to help us pray to pray for those needs that were there and then the ministers just came and worked right together and many I believe many lives receive from God what they had need of I believe her many that came back home amen and so I just see them the people here were worshiping even right there afterwards let me just try to hurry here here's the young people singing they're singing special this is that brother Rho elz Jerry I'll get to where he was at on this was the last Sunday morning this one was this November 3rd so I spoke there this time that brother Rho elz on that Sunday morning and we just just took a little thought there and and just ministered just something the Lord just dropped on a heart there that morning and brother o-l after the service was over a high you know just we're just talking how the Lord had just so wonderfully moved even in this service right here and once again you don't you don't know of the needs and of questions that are present but God knows every need and brother oil just told me after the service he said you have no idea that so many questions were answered within this service so I said thanks be to God amen things be to God brother Jerry was here he was back up in Tagget I and brother adelies assembly on this Sunday morning so he was he was up there and here he is ministry here within within this church and as brother Jerry I think it was was it before you ministered they started giving the testimonies so before he ministered this was the place here where they had the one one young lady whom God had did such a marvelous work for in that youth retreat she got up and she gave the testimony in English and and and just what she had said you know brother Jerry had just dealt with something in the manner he was dealing with the fact he said there say he said clinical depression is something in here where there's no external factors causing it he said but there could be depression where there's external factors that's causing that and how the Lord took him and and and brother Jerry just simply put it he said and that's your fault you're in that depressed state and it's external factors that's your fault you can be delivered and you can walk out of that and I'll tell you that's exactly what happened with that young lady she stood up and she then gave a testimony right here in this church and she said you know what what brother Jerry said it was my fault she said that's a truth but she testified I'm free then there is a brother and they where it gets past him to microphone around and brother adeline different ones I guess what they were saying when we got together that night they couldn't figure out why this brother he had been sitting in the church almost a year I know he hadn't made a move or nothing he'd have been sitting there and he got the microphone and know he's gonna testify and they thought I mean the brother hadn't even walked in water baptism yet or anything but he got the microphone and he testified what God had did for him in the November 1 convention and he said I'm gonna be baptized that morning for the Jerry baptized he was sent in assembly a year it seemed like well nothing's going on but you know God's working God's working sometimes we need to say lord help me to be patient with you because sometimes when you look at you can look at others and remember our impatience is not with others it's with God you must remember don't ever be impatient with God sometimes it seems like he's not working but that word when it goes forth it's working it's working so here brother Jerry gathered with the brothers and brother adlai right there he was actually brother oels chief musician in the church and now he's pastoring a church there and then you know here are some pictures I mean the kids love Jerry look at him all gathering around they asked him a I mean they he was telling us how they asked him a bunch of questions and you know the effect like with them with the children I mean the young people just really just really took also you know what brother Gerry the minister and the word just so reached and touched their lives got so personal with him and here with brother Adlai his wife and his that his daughter okay that's his wife and his daughter so we certainly I think God for that then that evening I didn't have to preach to service on Sunday I was living in the new dispensation brother Gerry got transported back to the old dispensation I would live in in grace he was under law he was made to preach to service on Sunday so he preaches at another brothers church actually a a relative of brother Oh al brother Jess up aunt Aggie ty it's just a nut but it's an hour and a half apart and they called a special Sunday evening service and here and this when we got there that night we we met up with brother Jerry and we got there now this is what I remembered and sometimes when we went to Honduras and you show it for a meeting you all were as already supposed to start at that service we missed a turn but that's how it is over there you know in times when you're there what time's the service seven seven o'clock comes around what time service yeah 7:30 you realize things don't run on American time so we're over there you just you know here we are brother Ella they get the coconut juice out and they put the pie out of them thinking I'm thinking they're already singing inside here's the church there are already singing it in there and they're bringing food out in front of us a pie and things I'm thinking you know it'd be like I sitting in the vest of you and you are singing in here and pies are coming out there what do you do well when your own doing wrong dude I had a piece of pie it's a pie I had a piece of pie Jerry didn't cuz he's getting ready to preach but I hate pie so here's the church and and and and the jury was ministering that night on spiritual warfare but then how God brings a deliverance and once God brings a deliverance then let him fill you once he's delivered you and so doesn't matter how many people are trying to prevent someone from coming to Jesus the devil's can hold so I took that picture so you could see I'm sitting on that little porch diría this was the house where we're at and we would go to eat there later they actually take care of that it's an Airbnb house and to pan around to show you they the congregation or it it was just so small I don't even know if that the platform was our platform was double the size would you say that Jerry of what that place was where you were preaching it was small I couldn't get in so it was really small but people traveled to be there travelled to be there they so enjoyed the word of Lord and I told brother Jes I said brother Genesis I said I was sitting out there I said and I was looking at people you know because people walking up and down the road you know going back and forth getting fruit and things I said Lord what he's preaching tonight there's so many people who need it and I was sitting there and I said God I said let one let that word fall on somebody as they're walking by well here come two guys trying to tie in two wires you know they you we call the electric company they don't call the electric company I don't know how they tell out of this conglomeration of wires what wires going to your house and how are you tied I don't know so these guys I watch them make their way down I'm sitting there and I want witness to how they get the ladder right there and here's the one standard of the ladder and he's standing there and his brother Jerry's preaching I noticed him start turning and brother Jerry is dealing with that part about the deliverance that comes to the come came to Legion and how lives that need to be that to be set free and that and he his attention is caught in that moment the other guys up there working and his attention is caught I said Lord let the seed be planet they might have just decided to do the electrical at that time that God God orchestrates everything so I'd rather just said brother Sammy you don't know he said when you we come back he said they might be in a church I said they very well not be here we are right after that meeting and and we had some fellowship with the brothers there and just some of the brothers there that had traveled up is this brother Timothy he's a pastor as well this brothers enacted he's a medical doctor brother rusty he's a pastor as well for the Boyd's the head Deacon with brother ll for their adlai and then brother Pete but the Pete is the first pastor that was one through the mystery expose he brother Pete you know you've heard about brother oil talk about the mystery expose brother Pete was a high man in his denomination one only a past where he was the high man but then when God opened his eyes to it brother Pete all men he is he's a special brother he's a special brother it's kind of been hard for his family because his family seems such a high figure and then they seem here setting under a ministry but brother Pete is so happy in the Lord [Laughter] [Music] the fetus another feat is really something else brother ah when he introduced giri of myself he says now there the Browning brothers and he did it the last time then he reiterated again this time he said you know Browning makes guns he said man he said now the first gun he said it's gonna preach he said of either it's a heavy artillery it shoots slow but it shoots he said now then the next kind of comes up as a semi and brother Pete was talking about it with Jerry and I after that after the November 1 convention he was saying oh man you know he was talking about the morning service and my other word come forth you know then he said tonight we got the atomic bomb and he just smiled so big you know it's just so so precious they're just so happy in the Lord and every little thing they could not think us enough for us coming and being there with them and I know they wanted us to express that to you you know when we went it was a busy time we really did and I like that we didn't have much downtime I like being there and working and and I just was so thankful just it's just wonderful when you begin to see fruits and the affect of the Lord working right there within the services sometimes you hear testimonies afterwards you know sometimes you don't even sometimes there's things sometimes you don't even know about but then it comes sometimes later to you of what God has done but it's just it's a wonderful thing just to see God working so I want to say I appreciate each of you that how you have you've supported it and also your prayers through your prayers because I know you were praying and you were praying for us that God would be with us and lead us within that and I'll tell you God heard your prayers he heard your prayers and directed all of this and how that all come together there's a lot of things that I know some of you may have seen certain things online and some of the services are online but even testimonies and things that we were shared with the jury and I from the from the youth retreat there were still testimonies that were coming in even afterwards from the youth retreat of wall that God had just done just to help to the young the ministering to the young people so we just give we give glory to God and I want to say just so thankful for his mercy and what a privilege it is to be able a men to preach this gospel and a privilege it is to be able to serve a man in the kingdom of God with you because we're coworkers together and and if it wasn't if it wasn't for your prayers and support we'd never be able to go but God God has seen to it and there's also some things that I'll talk about at a later time when it comes to some there's a warning one need over there that's brought to my attention but we'll talk about that in a later time but I just want to say God richly bless you and distrust it you were blessed so much more many other pictures but yet I think we've covered it and may God just richly bless you for all of your prayer and standing standing right here with the work of the Lord sometimes I can't my mind I'll be honest with you I don't I cannot say that my mind understands why God would have to why the Lord would take somebody from this country and bring them over here and use them over here when there's capable men who are right there for him to use I don't understand that I don't understand why God how God will bring somebody to stand right here in this pulpit might be a different stature and whatever more and God will come right through that and speak and say well you mean you're saying you don't know I God speaks but what I'm saying is is God does things the way he does it he does it because there is no glory goes to any flesh our resource and our help is not from any man it's from Jesus Christ he is our sufficiency and anything that we've received it's been because of him and the only thing we want to do all of us as what the Scriptures we read when Peter and them rehearsed to work in the Lord how God had used them God uses each and every one your testimony your life is impaction and how God uses you as a tool for harvest in this hour I say God uses may we be use for the glory of God amen let's bow our heads everly Father we give you things tonight Lord Lord of the small little things Lord that we have shared as far as just some of
