[36:17] brother Claudio he was in he was in
[36:22] earlier today I'd got a text from
[36:24] brother Greg I had been down to see him
[36:26] Saturday evening and brother Claudio he
[36:29] was in they were operating to stop some
[36:35] bleeding here today so I haven't
[36:39] received any update as of yet from
[36:41] brother Greg but we want to remember the
[36:43] Claudia's sister Suzanne's father we
[36:46] want to remember him in prayer that the
[36:48] Lord would just just be merciful to him
[36:52] in this time and so we want to just hold
[36:56] him up in a word of Prayer amen
[36:59] aren't you aren't you glad we have a
[37:01] place aren't you glad you've got a rock
[37:04] oh my rock that's that's higher than I
[37:08] when they would say lead me to the rock
[37:11] that's higher than I
[37:13] and I'm so grateful to God that we we
[37:15] have a refuge we have a place Amen where
[37:18] we can go to Amen I'm grateful for that
[37:21] because we you know so many times in our
[37:25] lives and many of you have even been in
[37:27] the journey a lot longer myself but you
[37:30] we realize so many times again and again
[37:33] we don't have the answers but he is the
[37:37] answer he is the answer for every
[37:40] situation amen and he he always he's
[37:45] always he's always on time he's always
[37:47] faithful he knows exactly what we have
[37:50] need of you know we don't as believers
[37:53] we we realized this is not just words
[37:55] that we expressed these are our
[37:56] experiences he's right on time amen it's
[38:01] you know we we look at it and many times
[38:04] when we're praying for different
[38:06] situations and different needs and
[38:08] sometimes the tendency that can even be
[38:10] around us is we want to try to make
[38:13] something happen or become anxious with
[38:15] it that's the part of the human part
[38:17] about our life but the reality as we
[38:20] know Lord if you just step to the bow of
[38:22] the ship if we can just help me Lord to
[38:24] get this outer man under control that
[38:27] you can take control then that's when
[38:30] it's that's when it's all over it's all
[38:32] settled
[38:33] amen so we just thank God for that over
[38:37] and over you know it's the it's the
[38:39] little things and I certainly don't mean
[38:41] to make light of anything but it's the
[38:43] little things that mean so much to us
[38:45] God's the the everything how God with
[38:49] details in our life and how he ministers
[38:51] to us with every with each and every
[38:53] need I also want to remember brother

[44:17] where you just finally come to a place
[44:19] in your diligently searching but you
[44:21] finally come to place and say lord help
[44:24] me because I can't even trace in my mind
[44:26] where I would have put him I remember
[44:29] one night I was walking around in the
[44:30] house and I was you know because I have
[44:33] boys that are driving now and and so I
[44:36] was walking around some one of them had
[44:38] given me the keys and so I put the keys
[44:41] in my pocket so I came in and I was
[44:43] looking on the key wreck I said who who
[44:45] had my keys my keys are hanging up oh I
[44:48] had the whole house searching finally
[44:51] I'm not through searching in the car
[44:52] reach back and they're in this pocket in
[44:55] his back pocket so I had to apologize
[44:58] I said forgive me but I wasn't used to
[45:02] having him in that you know I just did
[45:04] sometimes we get things on our minds and
[45:06] we just take stuff and put it and but I
[45:08] think God for His mercy aren't you I'm
[45:11] just so thankful to the Lord that he's
[45:13] mindful one I knew there was something
[45:16] else I had as well brother Jason to Mars
[45:20] he requested prayer they're going to be
[45:24] going back to Turkey and Egypt in early
[45:28] June they had a real they had a real
[45:30] good trip in February and the Lord
[45:35] willing they're going to be going back
[45:38] over over into turkey here back in June
[45:42] so we want to keep them in prayer the
[45:46] other thing is his mother-in-law was
[45:49] diagnosed with cancer and it's spread
[45:52] quite a bit they're doing chemo and he
[45:56] said we just joined with him there's
[45:59] Mary Hoffman Mary Hoffman so brother
[46:02] Jason to Mars which most do you remember
[46:05] brother Jason was here in the first part
[46:07] of December and their work that's among
[46:08] the Persian countries there so let's
[46:11] remember that in prayer as well so just
[46:19] just going back over that brother Ray's
[46:21] job situation the missions and
[46:24] missionaries and Churchill Lorraine

[46:30] lost souls for Angie Brown also for
[46:34] brother Jewell so for brother Carmelo
[46:38] and there's requests here for unsaved
[46:40] loved ones among among many to hear many
[46:44] different ones that are wrote down also
[46:46] brother herb and then also sister Rita's
[46:50] sister Teresa that for the radiation
[46:53] she's got six weeks for that and then
[46:55] the request that sister Patsy had here
[46:57] for her brother Dave and new bro that's
[47:00] moving back as well as her misty
[47:02] Flemming who's in the hospital and her
[47:04] mom's blood pressure and then also for
[47:08] brother Bobby carpet for his healing and
[47:10] the Claudio and sister Mary and the
[47:15] children so let's just remember each one
[47:18] of these requests in prayer and there's
[47:21] different ones that come to your heart
[47:22] as we're praying you you just take that
[47:26] always just be obedient to the Lord
[47:28] because if there's a need that stands
[47:29] out to you out of what's been read here
[47:32] or there's someone else that comes to
[47:33] your heart maybe it's someone who's back
[47:36] saluting they come to your heart just
[47:39] stand right in there it's the Lord
[47:41] putting that on your heart and just
[47:42] stand right in there and pray you know
[47:44] and sometimes we we look at things and I
[47:47] don't know probably every one of you
[47:49] have found yourself this way too you
[47:51] know you try to write down every single
[47:53] thing in every single need and you try
[47:55] to remember every single request and I'm
[47:56] talking about over the course sometimes
[47:58] of weeks and things and you know
[48:00] sometimes you you hear things you think
[48:03] I I wish I would have remembered that
[48:04] more I wish I would have remembered this
[48:07] and you know it's not that you Eve
[48:08] willfully forgot it sometimes we were as
[48:11] we're praying it's most important is
[48:14] that we recognize we're a body we're a
[48:16] body and you know the Lord is mindful of
[48:19] our needs and to think of how that he'll
[48:21] drop that need in that request it's not
[48:24] going unattended it's being attended to
[48:26] by the redeemed of the Lord taking that
[48:30] before the throne of God so tonight we
[48:32] just want to we just want to go into
[48:34] prayer here tonight and just ask the
[48:37] Lord would just move on behalf of these
[48:39] needs you love the Lord amen
[48:42] glory be to God you're glad we can have
[48:44] a time to come together and just pray
[48:46] amen and just take our take the
[48:48] petitions before the throne of the Lord
