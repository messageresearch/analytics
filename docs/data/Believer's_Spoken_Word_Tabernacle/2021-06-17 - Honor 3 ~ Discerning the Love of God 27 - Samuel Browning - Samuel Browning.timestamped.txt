[36:25] and you gave it to him and they opened
[36:27] up that my they're tearing that package
[36:29] off and
[36:30] my the package the outside looks so nice
[36:33] and then here's this old rusty truck
[36:36] back then they used to make
[36:38] trucks metal you know they weren't
[36:39] plastic i'm not talking about the ones
[36:41] we're driving but
[36:42] you know the ones you play with and you
[36:44] open it up and what's this
[36:47] you see everything looked kind of
[36:48] exciting with the package that was that
[36:50] was the wrapping on the outside but
[36:52] what you're after is what's on the
[36:54] inside and that's what real charity is
[36:56] it's
[36:57] what's beneath the wrapping sometimes
[36:59] the wrapping may not look like much but
[37:02] what's beneath that wrapping and what's
[37:04] in that life so that's what we want to
[37:06] look at in verse 4
[37:08] of first corinthians 13 says charity
[37:10] suffereth long
[37:12] and is kind charity envieth not
[37:15] it vaunteth not itself it is not puffed
[37:18] up
[37:19] it does not behave itself unseemly that
[37:22] means
[37:23] act unbecomingly or rudely it seeketh
[37:27] not
[37:28] her own in other words it's it's not all
[37:30] about me
[37:31] it's not easily provoked or reviled or
[37:34] angered and it thinketh no evil keeps no
[37:37] records of all the wrong that's ever
[37:40] been done
[37:42] amen may god bless the reading of his
[37:45] word as you're being seated
[37:46] i want to look a little bit more at this
[37:48] tonight on doth not behave itself
[37:52] unseemly and you know when we we look at
[37:54] this
[37:55] i believe as with all the word of god
[37:58] when we
[37:59] look at it we're very to be very honest
[38:02] and look into the mirror of god's word
[38:04] and
[38:05] see a real reflection in our life and
[38:07] really take inventory
[38:09] in our own lives that we want to see
[38:12] we want to see more of god we want to
[38:14] see more of his life flowing through our
[38:17] lives and
[38:18] we realize that it's it's just kind of
[38:20] like you know you look at your house
[38:21] there's a lot of things you can add to
[38:23] your house but
[38:24] if you don't move some things out then
[38:26] it no longer
[38:27] is complementary it becomes cluttered so
[38:30] you've got to take some things out and
[38:32] donate it or whatever you're going to do
[38:34] or move it here move it there or put it
[38:36] down in the basement and wait for 10
[38:38] years from now
[38:38] but anyway you've got to move some
[38:40] things out in order to have more things
[38:42] come in
[38:43] and that's how it is with god in our
[38:45] life there's things that we begin to see
[38:48] by the word of god things how the holy
[38:50] spirit will deal
[38:52] with our life because there's a desire
[38:54] in our heart
[38:55] to see more of him we we know that this
[38:58] this life that you and i in or that we
[39:00] are walking in
[39:01] it's just a fleeting space of time as
[39:04] james would describe it
[39:05] it's more than ju it's just like vapor
[39:08] it's just
[39:08] it goes by ever so quickly we're here
[39:11] just just for a season of time that our
[39:13] lives would be
[39:15] molded and shaped and prepared for that
[39:18] that time that is coming and that we're
[39:20] headed for
[39:21] so when we we look at this here tonight
[39:24] and think about this
[39:25] i want to just look at it in terms of
[39:28] that how the
[39:29] charity itself it doesn't it doesn't
[39:31] behave itself
[39:32] unseemly or unbecomingly or an unbeseem
[39:35] unseemly behavior or rudeness but there
[39:38] is actually
[39:39] instead it is that of an honor and you
[39:42] know
[39:42] with when we look at it in our life our
[39:45] character itself
[39:46] is molded by the life in us i never
[39:49] forget you know when
[39:51] we were my wife and i were expecting
[39:54] uh paul and you know i already had you
[39:58] know in my heart you know
[39:59] we we had had you know i wanted to name
[40:02] him after my dad and
[40:03] and you know i also wanted to put the
[40:05] middle name of who my dad reminded me of
[40:08] of his stand and things that he had to
[40:10] stand against and things from early
[40:12] years
[40:13] and so that's why his name is james paul
[40:16] and so when we looked at this i remember
[40:19] it happened to be
[40:20] in that year in school now some of you
[40:22] know that work in schools there's
[40:24] sometimes where you
[40:25] run into names that you think oh my that
[40:27] that was a good name i had picked out
[40:29] but they ruined that name for me
[40:31] but i had an individual in class that
[40:33] year whose names
[40:34] happened to be james that guy could
[40:35] steal you blind i mean he was good
[40:38] he could lie straight to your face and
[40:39] make you think he was telling the honest
[40:41] to goodness truth
[40:42] we knew this about this young man now in
[40:45] the midst of that i had a choice of do i
[40:47] continue to
[40:48] you know name him james but you see i
[40:50] wasn't naming him
[40:52] james based on that character that had
[40:55] held that name because
[40:56] when you really get to looking at in the
[40:58] scripture we cringe at the name
[41:00] jezebel is that right even god would
[41:03] pick up that name
[41:04] even as the name balaam and he would use
[41:06] the characteristic of what it
[41:08] represented
[41:09] clear there in the book of revelations
[41:11] but when you look at the actual name
[41:13] jezebel it don't have really a bad
[41:15] meaning but it's the character of life
[41:17] that was displayed that then looks at
[41:19] that name jezebel
[41:21] are you with me so sometimes when we're
[41:23] looking at this we
[41:25] we understand the character itself and
[41:27] that's who you really are
[41:28] our character is molded by the life
[41:32] that's in us that's that's who we really
[41:34] are you take that life
[41:36] and has its place within us there and
[41:38] brother brown would say it like this
[41:39] he speaks he says we've got to take the
[41:42] full gospel and
[41:43] we we have to identify ourselves as full
[41:45] gospel people
[41:47] let's mold our character we're invited
[41:50] to be molded
[41:51] in his image that we might reflect
[41:54] his presence the works that i do shall
[41:58] you do also
[41:59] the life that i live so shall you we're
[42:02] invited by god to take
[42:04] him as an example and let our
[42:07] character be molded like his oh what a
[42:10] thing it is he says
[42:11] then when we let his character be
[42:14] in us then we have become sons by having
[42:18] the mind of christ
[42:19] the mind which is his character your
[42:22] mind
[42:23] makes your character let this mind that
[42:26] was in christ
[42:27] be in you so he says it molds the
[42:30] character of a son of god
[42:34] so our life that of our first
[42:37] birth there was a molding of chara our
[42:40] character
[42:40] in this life but once once that life has
[42:44] come in the character
[42:46] of his life the life that was here
[42:48] inside
[42:49] of this vessel that was here that you or
[42:52] me or anybody else could
[42:54] know you as you were and maybe you
[42:56] weren't bad as what people would call
[42:58] but
[42:59] there's something that's taken place
[43:01] with you that in your life
[43:02] that you're you're not just a church
[43:04] member you're not just somebody who
[43:07] says i believe the message or or you're
[43:09] no longer
[43:10] bound there you know with all with
[43:12] different things and attributes of
[43:13] unbelief
[43:14] but god has come down in your life and
[43:17] your life is set on fire by god
[43:20] it's so there's a different testimony
[43:22] coming out of your life
[43:23] regardless of what you say your life is
[43:26] testifying
[43:27] because there's a new there's a
[43:29] different character of
[43:30] life that's moved on the inside of you
[43:33] it's not
[43:34] you trying to live this life but now it
[43:37] is god's own life that has come
[43:39] to unite with that part of himself that
[43:42] was sown
[43:42] in our life that came straight from the
[43:45] mind of god
[43:46] it was planted here within our body as
[43:49] we dropped from our mother's womb
[43:51] and now that life is on display and it's
[43:54] a molding and a reflection to where
[43:57] others look at you they look at me and
[43:59] say there's a christian
[44:01] there's a believer there's a life that
[44:04] that
[44:04] beats for god so all of that changed
[44:08] because
[44:08] a character of life has moved into our
[44:12] life
[44:12] and i just say it in this manner we're
[44:15] in a journey
[44:16] as we're walking here in this life we've
[44:19] bypassed our theophany we did not come
[44:22] from the attribute
[44:24] to the theophany then down to flesh
[44:27] jesus came that way
[44:29] is that right when he would ask he says
[44:31] glorify me with the glory that i
[44:34] had with thee before the foundation of
[44:36] the world
[44:37] that that theophany is that word body
[44:39] it's a body
[44:40] that's not made with hands it's a
[44:43] spiritual body
[44:44] but yet it's visible there in that realm
[44:47] it is that same realm on the other side
[44:50] where the prophet when he witnessed and
[44:52] he saw there
[44:53] he saw him walking around there in word
[44:55] bodies
[44:56] you and i bypass that to come down in
[45:00] here
[45:00] straight from the attribute and become
[45:03] flesh
[45:05] and you see this is here that where
[45:07] we're living this is the proving grounds
[45:12] you know there's a shipyard i believe
[45:14] it's out in new jersey or off the coast
[45:16] or whatever more
[45:17] they call it the proving grounds they
[45:19] take those
[45:20] naval vessels and everything else and
[45:22] they prove them
[45:24] before they ever commission them for
[45:27] war there's a proving that goes on the
[45:31] the bible says that every son that
[45:33] cometh to god
[45:34] must be tried and chastened and proven
[45:38] and that testing never stops in our life
[45:42] is that right as a matter of fact we are
[45:44] partakers of that
[45:46] right now in our life if we're not
[45:47] partakers of the chasing of the lord
[45:49] then the scripture said
[45:51] we're not sons we're bastards is that
[45:53] right
[45:54] for only sons are actually partakers to
[45:57] receive the correction of almighty god
[46:00] so this is proving grounds this is where
[46:03] the testing
[46:04] and the trials and testing there you
[46:06] know the temptations and
[46:08] everything come around this is where our
[46:11] character
[46:12] is molded and shaped in this time
[46:15] as much that as you and i we we
[46:18] i'll just say it like this for all of us
[46:20] because i believe all of us do
[46:22] we all want the easy stretch we all want
[46:25] the part about it's the flesh part of us
[46:27] we we don't want anything hindered or
[46:29] interrupted we try to look out sometimes
[46:31] for problems
[46:32] and everything else and we try to get
[46:34] away from this or get away from that
[46:36] but yet god remember in this time that
[46:39] we're here
[46:40] he's not the author of confusion
[46:43] he's not the uh he's not a frustration
[46:46] he's the author of
[46:48] peace he knows exactly what he's doing
[46:51] he permits things to come our way that
[46:54] you and i would think
[46:55] why where did this come from such as
[46:58] when david walked out of the city
[47:00] and a man spit on him now remember the
[47:03] messenger that was standing by david
[47:05] said shall i let that dog's head stay on
[47:07] it but
[47:08] david himself oh i wish i could preach
[47:10] on this
[47:11] david himself being a man under
[47:14] authority by god
[47:15] and knowing how god had dealt with his
[47:18] life
[47:18] all along david said don't you touch him
[47:21] god
[47:22] told him to do that are you with me
[47:26] he was able to discern that that this
[47:29] god told him to do that you see it's
[47:32] things sometimes that you and i
[47:34] we don't we don't understand and we we
[47:37] look at it and we see things taking
[47:39] place
[47:39] such as when the scripture says in love
[47:42] does not behave itself
[47:44] rudely or unseemingly or unbecomingly it
[47:47] shows that there are times that come our
[47:50] way
[47:51] will come our way that we might feel to
[47:54] act
[47:54] rudely or unbecomingly to that of a
[47:57] christian
[47:58] but you see this is where by the love of
[48:01] god within our lives
[48:03] there has to be a maturing in our lives
[48:06] you see
[48:07] god does not allow a test or a trial
[48:10] to come our way and give us something to
[48:13] show that we're a failure that's not
[48:15] what it is at all
[48:16] but a tester trial just like the tester
[48:18] trials
[48:19] that you're facing right now in your
[48:21] life and in your walk
[48:22] those tester trials could not have come
[48:25] years ago
[48:26] a month ago even a week ago it's for
[48:29] this moment because there's been a
[48:31] maturing
[48:32] of the very life inside of you
[48:35] that now it will take that test or that
[48:38] trial
[48:39] to further shape and mold our lives
[48:44] this is why as brother branham would
[48:46] pick this up over and over
[48:48] through through the church ages and he
[48:51] would deal with this of the molding
[48:53] the shaping the test of trials that
[48:55] would come our way
[48:56] and he would simply say it in this way
[48:59] character
[49:00] a character itself is a victory
[49:03] not a gift the holy ghost is the gift of
[49:07] god
[49:08] is that right you can't earn it you
[49:10] can't merit it
[49:11] it's the gift of almighty god but
[49:15] character itself is not a gift
[49:19] it's a victory so in order for there to
[49:22] be a victory
[49:23] there's got to be battles and there are
[49:26] battles
[49:26] to prove that there is a greater than he
[49:30] that is in you than he that's in the
[49:32] world to show
[49:34] that you are indeed an overcomer
[49:37] because you are operating by overcoming
[49:40] life
[49:40] through that very seed of god that's
[49:43] placed on the inside of your life
[49:45] i understand sometimes you feel like
[49:47] you're going to crumble sometimes it
[49:49] seems like things
[49:49] are coming from this way this way this
[49:52] way and you feel like
[49:53] i feel like i'm all surrounded around
[49:55] here you feel like this is coming and
[49:57] and this is coming but in the midst of
[49:59] it it's
[50:00] in that time that god himself he
[50:03] declares
[50:03] there's something greater than your
[50:06] humanity
[50:07] your resolve there is a greater one
[50:11] inside of the temple
[50:13] [Applause]
[50:14] hallelujah and god will use tests and
[50:17] trials to show you
[50:19] yes in our humanity there's a breaking
[50:21] point
[50:22] but you can't break that connection
[50:25] between the believer
[50:27] and his god hallelujah
[50:31] glory be to god in the highest character
[50:34] he said
[50:35] simply is never made without suffering
[50:40] a man without character can't reign
[50:42] because power apart from character is
[50:44] satanic
[50:45] but power with character is fit to rule
[50:48] let me just bring this down to um
[50:50] you know to maybe to to just to speak of
[50:52] this in this manner you've seen people
[50:54] that all of a sudden here
[50:56] now they are the ceos in the factory and
[50:58] they never wore boots and walked on the
[51:00] ground
[51:01] come on now i i watched people when i
[51:04] taught school
[51:05] they taught for maybe two years and then
[51:08] here they are in administration
[51:09] they have no business being in there i'm
[51:12] just going to speak plainly
[51:13] they've not walked long enough down here
[51:16] to understand
[51:17] everything that goes on
[51:21] are you with me you see god himself he
[51:24] did not come down
[51:25] to just this level or this level brother
[51:28] he came down to where the foxes
[51:30] themselves had dens
[51:32] but he himself had not a place to lay
[51:35] his head
[51:35] he came down in such a way the king of
[51:38] glory and how the prophet would put it
[51:40] and the scriptures would reiterate it
[51:43] it was a humiliation he donned the very
[51:46] robes of humanity
[51:48] to experience testing and temptation
[51:51] the bible says he learned obedience
[51:54] through the things which he
[51:56] suffered he learned the cost
[51:59] of what it meant to obey even when it
[52:02] came down and it was hard and
[52:04] flesh was being pulled upon one way hey
[52:06] listen
[52:07] you and i have never faced something in
[52:09] that grave when he said when he was
[52:11] there
[52:11] in the garden of gethsemane every demon
[52:14] out of torment was there
[52:15] it was like the stands where samson was
[52:18] at
[52:19] when all of them were mocking and
[52:20] scoffing and every demon out of torment
[52:23] was right there in the garden of
[52:25] gethsemane and the conference was held
[52:28] will you go through it and he said
[52:30] nevertheless
[52:31] not my will thine will be done he prayed
[52:34] that way
[52:34] three times aren't you grateful that god
[52:37] himself
[52:38] he paid away for you and i he made a way
[52:41] that you and i
[52:42] as he stood victorious in that arena
[52:46] in that time of test that he might
[52:48] release his
[52:49] life back to you and i that in the midst
[52:52] of this
[52:53] hour in the midst of your trial in the
[52:55] midst of your test
[52:57] that that same life might display itself
[53:00] as the victorious one
[53:03] glory be to god character is a victory
[53:07] it's not a gift a preacher can't hand it
[53:10] to us
[53:12] no it is it
[53:15] is a victory
[53:19] you see we recognize that within this
[53:22] journey that you and i are in
[53:26] how the spirit of god has come in it it
[53:28] quickens
[53:29] that seed on the inside the spirit of
[53:31] god comes
[53:32] with a purpose to quicken the seed of
[53:35] god
[53:36] the spirit of god did not just come upon
[53:38] us to anoint us
[53:40] it came to anoint the word that was
[53:42] already there
[53:43] in our life you see there's a there was
[53:46] a place
[53:47] that god reserved for himself
[53:51] hallelujah god already had prepared
[53:54] a place he made a way that that in this
[53:57] hour that when
[53:58] you and i would have a need that there
[54:00] would be a place that he himself
[54:03] could come and dwell oh a body has thou
[54:06] prepared for me god knew he would have a
[54:08] people
[54:09] in the midst of this generation when
[54:12] it's all sorts of things that are taking
[54:14] place
[54:14] but he already knew there'll be a group
[54:16] of people on earth
[54:18] it's predestinated it's one of the last
[54:20] horns that's on the lamb
[54:22] one of the seven horns is standing here
[54:25] that the lamb is protecting his
[54:27] rights by his life inside of his people
[54:30] that's redeemed by his spirit his
[54:34] power is preserved his glory is
[54:36] preserved
[54:37] brother we're not looking back to
[54:38] something in the past it's a living god
[54:41] right now the lamb is right here among
[54:44] us the living god
[54:45] is operating right here in our midst
[54:49] glory be to god in the eyes so here in
[54:52] this time
[54:52] this is the time in the hour that we are
[54:55] formed
[54:56] to the image of the word we're being
[54:59] matured
[55:01] when we're first born we're a spirit
[55:04] babe in christ
[55:06] and we grow we must grow
[55:09] you see this is why it's important to
[55:12] grow
[55:15] it's something that you know that even
[55:17] as you recognize
[55:18] of the importance it's just like being
[55:21] and recognizing the importance
[55:22] of being in the house of god it's
[55:25] recognizing that even beyond our
[55:27] feelings
[55:28] sometimes of well you know i'll just
[55:30] catch it by streaming or whatever more
[55:33] now if i'm stepping on your toes may i
[55:35] jump on them a little bit
[55:37] this is this should not be an option of
[55:39] though well it's just the same
[55:41] it's not the same streaming is not the
[55:44] same
[55:44] streaming should not be an option unless
[55:47] you are
[55:48] sick unless you're homebound
[55:51] it should not be organizing the weekly
[55:53] activities around
[55:54] well you know what this is kind of
[55:56] pressing so i'll just catch thursday
[55:58] night by a stream
[56:00] let me just give you an information the
[56:02] rapture is not gonna be
[56:04] live streamed it'll be a secret
[56:07] setting going away you won't get a
[56:11] pop-up to let you know
[56:12] hey they're streaming right now so you
[56:15] better get
[56:16] into the live service right now
[56:19] and to recognize it's here under the
[56:21] presence of god
[56:23] as god is dealing with our life and he's
[56:25] been maturing us
[56:26] he's molding us by his presence
[56:30] this is why the prophet could say he
[56:32] said you cannot be good just as good a
[56:34] christian
[56:35] staying home as you can be in the house
[56:37] of god if you look around the house of
[56:39] god or
[56:40] let's look in your living room it's you
[56:41] and somebody else or maybe just you but
[56:44] when you're in the house of god the
[56:45] prophet tells us when believers are
[56:47] coming together
[56:48] that it is more of a pillar of fire that
[56:51] is coming together
[56:52] it is scriptural that the bible said
[56:54] forsake
[56:55] not to assemble yourselves together
[56:58] even the more so
[57:00] [Applause]
[57:04] i'll tell you friends when when people
[57:06] don't do it it's because there's a
[57:07] spiritual
[57:08] deficient somewhere i'm going to preach
[57:11] straight
[57:12] because it's spiritually deficient the
[57:14] world
[57:15] is getting in the way
[57:19] oh my well that's free
[57:23] hallelujah now i want you to think of
[57:25] this when we look at it
[57:27] you see in our lives right now to be a
[57:30] form to the word image
[57:31] to be a partaker of that word to feed on
[57:34] the word these are
[57:35] key important points that brother bran
[57:37] brings out in the message
[57:39] we are formed into the word image we're
[57:41] a partaker of that word
[57:42] we are a partaker of the life of
[57:45] almighty god
[57:47] and we feed on that word we take in the
[57:50] nutrients of that word
[57:51] it's molding us and shaping us listen
[57:54] it's not this scriptures that we read
[57:56] even for a text
[57:57] it isn't you and i walking around and
[57:59] saying well i got to be a good boy or i
[58:01] got to be a good girl
[58:02] remember the bride is not standing on
[58:04] good behavior
[58:05] the bride does not stand on that the
[58:07] bride is standing
[58:09] on thus saith the lord she has come
[58:12] under the blood by the token life of the
[58:15] lord jesus christ
[58:17] it is not she is standing on good
[58:19] behavior it is the life of god
[58:21] inside of us that is bringing forth the
[58:24] behavior
[58:24] of what a real son and daughter of god
[58:27] is as a matter of fact
[58:28] it's the character of life that lay
[58:31] within us that drew us
[58:32] to him in this hour
[58:36] glory be to god so when this life is
[58:39] fully developed
[58:41] it's like a picture when it's fully
[58:43] developed in our lives
[58:45] when it's fully developed here that
[58:48] wheat germ that's placed inside
[58:49] of the crocodile fully developed then
[58:54] we go there the full development is
[58:56] stepping in
[58:57] to that other dimension the full
[59:00] development
[59:01] is that of the rapture
[59:04] you see there's a developing that's
[59:06] going on in our life
[59:09] hallelujah don't don't look at yourself
[59:12] look to him
[59:14] he's the one that is developing our life
[59:18] you see this is why that after it's all
[59:20] said and done this is
[59:21] where the scripture says in 2nd
[59:23] corinthians 5 and i don't want to spend
[59:25] too much time here
[59:26] that for if the earthly house of this
[59:28] tabernacle
[59:29] were dissolved we have a building of god
[59:32] a house not made with hands
[59:34] eternal in the heavens i want to just
[59:37] you know to think about this in a minute
[59:40] you know to look at it you know uh
[59:43] how many of you ever you ever uh you
[59:45] knew brother ernie villanueva
[59:49] okay brother ernie was always with
[59:50] brother biscuit and right up there
[59:52] that's where he was there was that
[59:53] brother bernie he went on home to be
[59:54] with the lord just last week
[59:56] there's a statement that he that he that
[59:58] he made i want to read
[1:00:00] this statement here to me i thought it
[1:00:01] was absolutely profound i had caught it
[1:00:03] you know it at one point
[1:00:04] he said many people think i'm just a
[1:00:06] human being that has come down to earth
[1:00:08] to have a spiritual experience
[1:00:10] no that's not right you're a
[1:00:12] supernatural being
[1:00:14] you've come to earth to have a human
[1:00:16] experience
[1:00:17] and your mission and your mandate is to
[1:00:20] overcome the human experience
[1:00:22] to overcome your eyes ears taste touch
[1:00:25] and smell
[1:00:26] conscience memory reason affection and
[1:00:29] imagination
[1:00:30] and have the holy ghost enthroned inside
[1:00:32] of your life
[1:00:33] i thought that is powerful man
[1:00:37] we're not a human come down to have a
[1:00:39] spiritual experience
[1:00:40] we're a supernatural being let's come
[1:00:43] down to have a
[1:00:44] human experience and overcome that human
[1:00:48] experience
[1:00:49] by the grace of almighty god my goodness
[1:00:53] i tell you
[1:00:54] hallelujah to think of this we we have a
[1:00:57] place
[1:00:57] and we're going and to think how paul
[1:01:00] would write of it like this
[1:01:01] in romans 8 for the creature was made
[1:01:03] subject to vanity
[1:01:05] not willingly but by reason of him who
[1:01:07] had subjected the same in hope
[1:01:09] because the creature itself also
[1:01:12] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:01:15] corruption
[1:01:16] into the glorious liberty of the
[1:01:18] children of god
[1:01:19] there's already been a liberty a jubilee
[1:01:22] that sounded inside of your life
[1:01:27] amen you've now been connected back with
[1:01:30] that part of the inheritance the earnest
[1:01:33] of the spirit of god has come and
[1:01:35] quickened you
[1:01:36] and raised you up from the life that you
[1:01:39] used to live
[1:01:40] and the way that you used to go and god
[1:01:43] has come down
[1:01:44] and he's raised up that life dividing of
[1:01:46] himself
[1:01:47] it shows that waiting there on the other
[1:01:50] side
[1:01:50] the way that that life how it's had the
[1:01:53] effect upon your life now
[1:01:54] you turn from the things of the world
[1:01:57] and this word
[1:01:58] has become your all in all jesus christ
[1:02:01] is your all in all it shows brother you
[1:02:04] once were disconnected
[1:02:06] but now you're connected back in
[1:02:08] heavenly places
[1:02:09] you've been tied back in to your
[1:02:12] representation
[1:02:13] that is standing there before the throne
[1:02:16] of almighty god
[1:02:18] blessed be the name of the lord and this
[1:02:21] creature
[1:02:21] this new creation this life it shall be
[1:02:24] delivered from the bondage
[1:02:26] of this corruption
[1:02:29] hallelujah in this body there's
[1:02:32] limitations
[1:02:35] there's limitations sometimes how long
[1:02:37] that we can
[1:02:38] go or endure and even a service is that
[1:02:41] right
[1:02:43] there's limitations it's a bondage of
[1:02:45] corruption we experience
[1:02:46] sickness is that right we experience
[1:02:50] weakness in the body of corruption we
[1:02:52] experience
[1:02:53] down times it's it's all the bible says
[1:02:56] hey if the high priest himself was
[1:02:58] encompassed about with infirmity
[1:03:00] how much more you and i the reason that
[1:03:02] he came down
[1:03:04] and had that experience for you and i
[1:03:06] that he might be the
[1:03:07] faithful and merciful high priesthood
[1:03:10] things
[1:03:10] pertaining unto god now i want you to
[1:03:13] think of this of a life of authority
[1:03:16] living a life of authority because now
[1:03:19] from the inside
[1:03:21] it's it's how god has come in that life
[1:03:24] what is manifested there as a son or
[1:03:27] daughter of god that
[1:03:29] has dominion i look at this in this way
[1:03:33] when brother branham not only would he
[1:03:35] stand there
[1:03:36] yielded to god on the platform and the
[1:03:39] angel of the lord would come down
[1:03:41] and demon after demon was defeated
[1:03:45] as the people's faith would raise to
[1:03:48] recognize
[1:03:49] there is more than a man who is present
[1:03:52] the one thing that this message it
[1:03:54] brought a reality
[1:03:56] it doesn't leave god at church
[1:03:59] [Music]
[1:04:00] when it came time in the home his wife
[1:04:02] was all the pieces and everything else
[1:04:04] she was a nervous wreck here he stood
[1:04:07] with that same kind of authority
[1:04:09] as the son of god he took dominion
[1:04:12] over the situation
[1:04:14] [Applause]
[1:04:16] glory be to god blessed be the name of
[1:04:19] the lord
[1:04:20] oh my i don't want to go there but to
[1:04:23] think of it this is a life
[1:04:24] of authority that you and i are called
[1:04:28] to live
[1:04:30] a life of authority so not acting
[1:04:32] unbecomingly but rather
[1:04:33] in honor to reflect the spirit
[1:04:36] of that land that we have been born from
[1:04:39] now here
[1:04:40] in the in the bible in matthew chapter 8
[1:04:42] just set this for a background here
[1:04:44] here comes a man the centurion in
[1:04:47] matthew 8 8 the centurion answered and
[1:04:49] said lord
[1:04:50] i'm not worthy that thou should has come
[1:04:52] under my roof now brother ram takes this
[1:04:55] and even in the message respects he said
[1:04:57] no doubt this man
[1:04:58] being a centurion had a wonderful house
[1:05:02] he said no doubt a big house but look at
[1:05:05] his response
[1:05:06] to the lord jesus he says i'm not worthy
[1:05:10] that thou should has come under my roof
[1:05:13] here he has
[1:05:14] he don't just have a house but brother
[1:05:16] it no doubt is an astounding house
[1:05:18] but he's talking to one that doesn't
[1:05:22] even have a place on this earth to call
[1:05:25] home
[1:05:26] but you see that he is not honoring that
[1:05:29] he's honoring the god that is there
[1:05:33] vindicating his presence he recognizes
[1:05:36] god his presence in christ and that's
[1:05:39] where his reverence and respect is
[1:05:44] now watch how he says this here for i am
[1:05:46] a man
[1:05:47] under authority having soldiers under me
[1:05:51] and i say to this man go and he goeth
[1:05:53] and to another come and he cometh
[1:05:55] until my servant do this and he doeth it
[1:05:58] when jesus heard it
[1:05:59] he marveled and said to them that
[1:06:01] followed verily i say unto you
[1:06:03] i have not found so great faith no not
[1:06:06] in israel so
[1:06:07] one thing that we begin to see here is
[1:06:09] that faith itself
[1:06:11] is based on one knowing
[1:06:14] the authority that they're given and
[1:06:17] that authority
[1:06:18] itself it comes by knowing their
[1:06:20] position
[1:06:21] and how that where we are placed under
[1:06:24] the word so this is where you and i have
[1:06:27] authority
[1:06:28] outside of the word we don't have
[1:06:30] authority
[1:06:31] is that right but it's inside of the
[1:06:34] word
[1:06:34] that we have authority when jesus could
[1:06:37] stand there
[1:06:38] he was the word he was not speaking to
[1:06:40] the devil something
[1:06:42] separate from what he was he was
[1:06:44] speaking to what
[1:06:45] he was what was quickened to him he
[1:06:48] stood
[1:06:48] upon that word in the face of temptation
[1:06:52] he knew what it was to be under
[1:06:55] authority
[1:06:56] is that right to think of how that when
[1:06:59] you see
[1:07:00] this that faith itself it will operate
[1:07:02] there
[1:07:03] with one who knows authority and is
[1:07:06] under authority
[1:07:09] lord be to god now i want you to think
[1:07:12] of this
[1:07:12] brother graham talks about this this
[1:07:14] this theory and
[1:07:16] many places in the message but brother
[1:07:17] brown talks about it here when he
[1:07:19] preaches a message jesus on the
[1:07:20] authority of the word the roman nobleman
[1:07:22] and
[1:07:22] on and on in this place of the authority
[1:07:24] of the word blue brown says
[1:07:26] hear this man he kept himself in the
[1:07:28] background
[1:07:29] he said you know he said i've seen wheat
[1:07:32] when you drive
[1:07:33] by the road and you look out there and
[1:07:35] you see the wheat and it's standing up
[1:07:37] just like this
[1:07:38] he said its head is sticking right up he
[1:07:41] said
[1:07:41] what it is he said that wheat itself
[1:07:43] it's got an inferiority complex
[1:07:46] so it's got to stick its head up like
[1:07:47] this and it shows
[1:07:49] there's nothing inside of that head yet
[1:07:52] but he said when the head itself bows
[1:07:55] that it shows
[1:07:56] it's got something in it because when
[1:07:59] the heart itself
[1:08:00] is filled with the love of god it bows
[1:08:03] in the presence of god because
[1:08:05] it recognizes i'm nothing without
[1:08:08] him you see when the life has
[1:08:10] compression
[1:08:11] from the stalk and it moves through the
[1:08:13] tassel and it moves into that part of
[1:08:15] the shock to where now
[1:08:17] it's time for the life itself to declare
[1:08:20] itself then the life
[1:08:21] brings forth a life of humility
[1:08:27] he said lord i'm a man under authority
[1:08:30] now brother brown would say it like this
[1:08:31] he said you know
[1:08:32] he said in his own line of work
[1:08:35] he saw who jesus was now think of this
[1:08:40] he of everything that he did in life
[1:08:43] think of this all these things all the
[1:08:46] training that he went through
[1:08:47] to get to where he was he he
[1:08:51] there had to be a quality about his life
[1:08:54] that all the way through he was a man
[1:08:56] who was under authority
[1:08:58] and that under that kept on moving him
[1:09:01] into a place to where
[1:09:02] he was entrusted with a century
[1:09:05] of troops it was in that line of work i
[1:09:09] hope you're hearing me
[1:09:10] in his own line of work he saw who jesus
[1:09:13] was
[1:09:14] because he could look in his own line of
[1:09:17] work
[1:09:18] he could recognize even who jesus was
[1:09:21] that i'm a man
[1:09:22] under authority they tell me tell your
[1:09:25] century to do this
[1:09:26] and i give the orders that's come down
[1:09:29] he recognized
[1:09:31] god was present in christ and that all
[1:09:34] that needed to be spoken
[1:09:36] was the word and as the word would go
[1:09:38] forth he recognized
[1:09:40] that god was present on earth to heal
[1:09:42] sickness
[1:09:43] to bring deliverance to set the captive
[1:09:46] free
[1:09:46] he recognized the presence of god
[1:09:50] that was there upon earth
[1:09:53] how did he recognize it by being a man
[1:09:56] who's under authority
[1:10:00] glory be to god now let's look at this
[1:10:03] just for a moment here
[1:10:04] on on order and authority
[1:10:08] you see we've been made kings and
[1:10:10] priests unto our god
[1:10:11] revelations 1 revelations 5 is that
[1:10:14] right
[1:10:15] there's a two-pole there's a two-fold
[1:10:17] part in our life
[1:10:18] you even see that when you read the song
[1:10:21] of solomon it speaks of how that
[1:10:23] uh you know the bride is and my how
[1:10:25] beautiful she is and then
[1:10:27] right within that same verse of
[1:10:28] scripture it'll flip and say terrible
[1:10:30] as an army with banners so there's a
[1:10:33] part within our life
[1:10:35] as kings that we reign in this life
[1:10:38] over sin over the flesh over the devil
[1:10:40] and over the world is that right
[1:10:42] we reign as kings under
[1:10:45] the king of kings and then there's a
[1:10:48] part in our life
[1:10:49] that is that of priesthood or priests
[1:10:54] now when we look at this with that of of
[1:10:56] a priest
[1:10:57] look how peter would give this example
[1:11:00] to you and i
[1:11:01] in our walk as priest unto god
[1:11:05] in verse nine you're a chosen generation
[1:11:07] a royal priesthood
[1:11:09] a holy nation of peculiar people that
[1:11:11] you should show forth the praises of him
[1:11:14] who have called you out of darkness into
[1:11:17] his marvelous light you've not just been
[1:11:21] brought into the inner court
[1:11:23] and all of a sudden your experience can
[1:11:24] be blown out no
[1:11:26] this is not a man-made experience
[1:11:29] you've been brought beyond just the holy
[1:11:31] place you've been brought
[1:11:33] back into the holiest of holies it's
[1:11:36] coming to a place to where
[1:11:38] it's no longer your light but david said
[1:11:40] he is
[1:11:41] my light the lord is the light of my
[1:11:45] life so it is that shekinah light it's
[1:11:48] his abiding presence that no matter how
[1:11:50] dark he gets
[1:11:51] no matter how windy it gets you know the
[1:11:54] stars themselves could be covered
[1:11:56] in the outer court and the light
[1:11:57] wouldn't shine is that right
[1:11:59] weapons out here there could be times in
[1:12:02] the spirit realm
[1:12:03] that the candle gets blown out is that
[1:12:05] right heavy maintenance area
[1:12:07] but inside of the inside when it's been
[1:12:10] lit with the life of almighty god
[1:12:13] there's not enough
[1:12:14] devils in hell that could ever blow that
[1:12:17] out
[1:12:18] it's not a man-made life it's god's own
[1:12:22] life that's burning in the heart of that
[1:12:25] individual
[1:12:26] [Applause]
[1:12:29] hallelujah is the same original
[1:12:32] fire that came down and consumed the
[1:12:35] sacrifice
[1:12:36] it's the same original fire that fell on
[1:12:39] the day of pentecost that same
[1:12:41] original fire the seven licks of it
[1:12:44] that have come in every generation it's
[1:12:47] the same
[1:12:48] original holy ghost
[1:12:53] amen so we have been called out of
[1:12:55] darkness
[1:12:58] and remember what paul said we weren't
[1:13:00] just in darkness
[1:13:01] we were we were sometimes darkness
[1:13:06] we've been called into his marvelous
[1:13:09] life
[1:13:09] which in times past were not a people
[1:13:12] but are now
[1:13:13] the people of god which had not obtained
[1:13:15] mercy
[1:13:17] but now have obtained mercy
[1:13:21] now watch how peter expresses this
[1:13:23] priesthood of our lives
[1:13:25] dearly beloved i beseech you as
[1:13:26] strangers and pilgrims
[1:13:29] abstain from fleshly lust which war
[1:13:32] against the soul having your
[1:13:36] conversation at your conduct
[1:13:38] honest among the gentiles that whereas
[1:13:41] they speak against you as evildoers
[1:13:45] they may by your good works which they
[1:13:48] shall behold
[1:13:50] glorify god in the day of visitation
[1:13:54] so the good works is the life that's
[1:13:57] lived according to the word
[1:14:00] right it's not us doing good works as
[1:14:03] far as
[1:14:04] i'm going to do this and i'm going to do
[1:14:05] this good works
[1:14:07] is the word being expressed
[1:14:11] we have been ordained unto
[1:14:14] good works amen
[1:14:18] so now notice this here in verse 13
[1:14:21] submit yourselves to every ordinance of
[1:14:24] man
[1:14:25] for the lord's sake whether it be to the
[1:14:29] king
[1:14:30] as supreme or unto governors as unto
[1:14:33] them that are
[1:14:34] sent by him for the punishment of
[1:14:36] evildoers
[1:14:37] and for the praise of them to do well
[1:14:39] now i want to remember
[1:14:40] this is the same man
[1:14:44] the holy ghost speaking through peter
[1:14:46] it's the same
[1:14:47] holy spirit that when they commanded
[1:14:50] them
[1:14:51] to stop preaching in his name the same
[1:14:54] holy ghost deserved that situation and
[1:14:57] said
[1:14:58] we are not going to stop preaching in
[1:15:00] his name
[1:15:02] they weren't being disrespectful but
[1:15:05] they recognize
[1:15:06] you cross the line as soon as you come
[1:15:09] against
[1:15:10] the word because they were not
[1:15:13] commissioned
[1:15:14] by the world they were commissioned
[1:15:17] by god this is exactly where our lives
[1:15:22] come
[1:15:22] as believers that how that in the midst
[1:15:25] of our life
[1:15:26] think of the lord jesus even when he was
[1:15:28] here he walked according to
[1:15:30] the ordinances and things that were
[1:15:31] there he never told the people in that
[1:15:34] day
[1:15:34] you know what you're following me uh you
[1:15:36] don't need to worry about paying taxes
[1:15:38] but he said
[1:15:38] give unto caesar what is caesar's but
[1:15:40] the verse says give unto god
[1:15:43] what is god's is that right
[1:15:46] being able to live that that life that
[1:15:49] recognize and be able
[1:15:50] to discern those things that when
[1:15:53] certain things cross the boundary let me
[1:15:54] bring this down personal
[1:15:56] there's things that you can look at in
[1:15:57] your life that sometimes doesn't seem
[1:16:00] very
[1:16:00] obvious and there's got to be a
[1:16:02] discernment of the spirit of god
[1:16:04] because you don't have black and white
[1:16:06] in front of you sometimes you have to
[1:16:08] discern things
[1:16:09] and you bring it in this way is this
[1:16:11] going to draw me
[1:16:12] and my family closer to god or is it
[1:16:15] going to get between me
[1:16:16] and my family and you've got to discern
[1:16:19] things in that way
[1:16:20] not about how much better it'll make
[1:16:22] your life how easier it'll be
[1:16:24] you've got to have discernment of the
[1:16:26] holy spirit
[1:16:27] because satan is like a roaring lion
[1:16:30] he's seeking whom he may devour brother
[1:16:33] he'll do nothing to throw anybody
[1:16:35] off the track you've got to have
[1:16:37] discernment by the spirit of god in this
[1:16:39] hour
[1:16:40] and discernment you don't get it off of
[1:16:42] a shelf but this is where
[1:16:44] that feasting on the word of god you've
[1:16:46] got to have
[1:16:47] more than milk it takes the meat of the
[1:16:49] word
[1:16:50] his presence that's delivered to sons
[1:16:53] and daughters of god
[1:16:54] to be able to stand in the face of satan
[1:16:57] and say
[1:16:57] i see what you're trying to do but i
[1:17:00] will not take a shoe latch it from you
[1:17:02] i will not receive nothing of sodom
[1:17:04] [Applause]
[1:17:06] i'm not here about me i'm here on the
[1:17:09] business
[1:17:10] of the king
[1:17:18] for so is the will of god that with
[1:17:21] well-doing
[1:17:22] you may put to silence the ignorance of
[1:17:25] foolish men
[1:17:27] as free and not using your liberty for a
[1:17:31] cloak of maliciousness
[1:17:33] like i don't have to because i'm a
[1:17:35] christian
[1:17:37] see this was what was a custom among the
[1:17:39] jews
[1:17:40] now come on friends don't get don't get
[1:17:41] a stick in the mud on me now this is
[1:17:44] what
[1:17:44] this is what peter is bringing out right
[1:17:46] here
[1:17:48] don't don't act in a way that well i'm
[1:17:50] free from all of that you know
[1:17:51] this is thing some of you that's older
[1:17:53] you've seen this there's people that's
[1:17:55] come right around this and it's sad to
[1:17:57] say
[1:17:57] they've come right around this message
[1:17:59] and what it was they were rebellious and
[1:18:01] hippies out there
[1:18:02] they came in here they never got a new
[1:18:04] birth they're still rebellious
[1:18:07] come on now they never change they
[1:18:10] cannot wear flip-flops in the natural
[1:18:12] but they wear tie-dye shirts in the
[1:18:13] spiritual and spiritual flip-flops
[1:18:16] subject to nothing at all they do what
[1:18:18] they want to do
[1:18:19] they do it when they want to do it now
[1:18:21] they you see what it is
[1:18:23] it's coming in they never receive a
[1:18:25] change of nature
[1:18:26] they look at the messages though it's
[1:18:28] something aligning with
[1:18:30] they always despised authority the
[1:18:32] message is not
[1:18:33] a despising of authority the message
[1:18:36] itself
[1:18:37] it came to tear down the very kingdom of
[1:18:40] satan
[1:18:41] and a hold upon the lies of god's people
[1:18:45] it came to break the sin and the hold
[1:18:47] upon that life
[1:18:48] that that life may walk free
[1:18:52] it never came to make arrogant people
[1:18:55] it never came to water your complexes
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:05] that ain't what the message came for
[1:19:08] the message did not come to make people
[1:19:11] more and to make them arrogant that is
[1:19:13] not a work of the holy ghost
[1:19:17] the message did not come to make them
[1:19:19] despise government
[1:19:22] come on that's a working in peter ii
[1:19:25] peter also in jude
[1:19:27] speaks that these brute beasts they
[1:19:30] despise
[1:19:31] dominion you know what a dominion is
[1:19:34] authority
[1:19:37] i'll tell you there's there's a holy
[1:19:40] ghost that can deal with an inferiority
[1:19:41] complex
[1:19:43] there's a holy ghost that can set a life
[1:19:45] free
[1:19:46] come on friends oh brother sam you don't
[1:19:49] know what happened to me in my past
[1:19:50] but are you going to hold on to that
[1:19:51] pastor are you going to let the spirit
[1:19:53] of god take you back
[1:19:54] into the mind of god and release that
[1:19:56] hole from upon your life
[1:19:59] come on you've been trying to escape
[1:20:01] things all your life and
[1:20:02] putting blame on everybody else and
[1:20:04] god's been trying to mold you
[1:20:06] and bring you to a place to where you
[1:20:08] submit to him and say god
[1:20:10] it ain't everybody else's i'm the guy
[1:20:12] that needs change
[1:20:21] my goodness the preacher came in there
[1:20:24] oh my as free and not using your liberty
[1:20:27] for a cloak of maliciousness
[1:20:29] but as the servants of god
[1:20:32] honor all men love the brotherhood
[1:20:35] fear god honor the king
[1:20:40] let me just refer to these places i'm
[1:20:41] not going to read them i refer to them
[1:20:43] god is in control let me just tell you
[1:20:46] something
[1:20:47] god is in control to who gets to be the
[1:20:49] supervisor
[1:20:51] in your shift
[1:20:55] god's in control and who gets to be
[1:20:57] president whether they know they are or
[1:20:59] not
[1:21:00] god's in control are you with me
[1:21:04] man's not in control
[1:21:07] god's in control god has this
[1:21:10] under his control satan can't make
[1:21:14] a move
[1:21:14] [Applause]
[1:21:16] [Music]
[1:21:19] well i'm going to read it now daniel
[1:21:20] chapter 2 daniel answered and said
[1:21:23] blessed be the name of god forever and
[1:21:25] ever for wisdom and might are his
[1:21:27] he changeth the times and the seasons
[1:21:30] he removeth kings and set us up kings
[1:21:34] who does it god does it
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:41] i mean thing brother branham could stand
[1:21:43] right there over and over when he
[1:21:44] preaches uncertain sound and
[1:21:46] throughout the message and he would let
[1:21:47] the people know everything that has
[1:21:50] taken place he said
[1:21:51] you can't have certainty in democracy
[1:21:53] brother branham would stand right there
[1:21:54] and said we don't even know if president
[1:21:56] kennedy really is the president
[1:21:58] but you see what it is it makes no
[1:22:00] difference whether it was done this way
[1:22:02] or done that way there had to be a
[1:22:04] pharaoh
[1:22:05] raised up who knew not joseph
[1:22:11] are you with me you see god is in
[1:22:13] control of these things
[1:22:16] this is why paul could go on to write in
[1:22:18] romans 13
[1:22:19] let every soul be subject under the
[1:22:21] higher powers for there's no power but
[1:22:23] of god
[1:22:24] the powers that be are ordained of god
[1:22:26] whosoever therefore resisteth the power
[1:22:28] resisteth the ordinance of god and they
[1:22:30] that resist shall receive to themselves
[1:22:32] damnation
[1:22:33] but samuel what are you saying i'm
[1:22:34] saying to you tonight
[1:22:36] that when we look at the line order even
[1:22:38] the authority
[1:22:39] where the roman centurion himself in his
[1:22:42] line of work
[1:22:43] by being under authority and recognize
[1:22:46] how
[1:22:46] that that authority would operate he was
[1:22:49] able to tap
[1:22:50] in and recognize how god is present
[1:22:53] and know that that same authority when
[1:22:55] the word is spoken
[1:22:57] that everything underneath that word is
[1:22:59] already conquered
[1:23:03] and to recognize let me just say this to
[1:23:05] you if your children or
[1:23:07] anybody else if they look down at adults
[1:23:10] and talk back to adults and everything
[1:23:12] else
[1:23:13] where does that line get drawn
[1:23:17] you know what that's called babylon
[1:23:19] confusion
[1:23:21] because you want them to disrespect
[1:23:23] teachers and then want them to respect
[1:23:25] preachers you can't you can't work it
[1:23:27] that way
[1:23:28] you see this is where the scripture said
[1:23:30] the spirit of this world
[1:23:32] it despises government and authority
[1:23:36] it's not the spirit of god that does
[1:23:38] that
[1:23:40] come on somebody this is why it behooves
[1:23:43] us you better be careful what you're
[1:23:44] sowing in your home
[1:23:47] i'm going to preach and running down
[1:23:48] there you better be careful what you're
[1:23:50] showing
[1:23:51] in your home if you despise so things in
[1:23:53] there
[1:23:54] that looks down upon that of authority
[1:23:57] and those places like that it doesn't
[1:23:59] stop there with that situation
[1:24:01] it continues on and on and on to
[1:24:04] eventually
[1:24:04] they'll be tearing down the preacher
[1:24:06] tearing down the pastor
[1:24:08] and eventually they'll be tearing down
[1:24:10] you because you haven't taught them
[1:24:12] how to hold the proper respect
[1:24:15] the powers that are the authority
[1:24:29] they're more coming with this meal
[1:24:31] [Music]
[1:24:33] you see rulers paul goes into this i i'm
[1:24:35] not going to read all of that but
[1:24:37] he goes into it rulers aren't bad
[1:24:40] he said they're a terror they're they're
[1:24:43] not a tear under good works
[1:24:44] they're set forth the government's
[1:24:45] magistrates and whatever more
[1:24:47] to punish the evil doers
[1:24:52] but samuel what are you saying i'm
[1:24:56] saying
[1:24:56] that every policeman i see everywhere
[1:24:59] i've been if i go in to get a coffee and
[1:25:01] i see him there
[1:25:02] i'll walk over to him and i'll let them
[1:25:03] know i appreciate all you're doing
[1:25:10] i seen a man that was you know maybe an
[1:25:12] official or whatever more
[1:25:13] look it's not all necessarily agreeing
[1:25:15] with the man but look at this
[1:25:17] look at even how that the nation has
[1:25:19] went right now
[1:25:20] you see what's happened in the spiritual
[1:25:22] in the spiritual
[1:25:24] seeds that were shown back there when
[1:25:26] the prophet could call it out
[1:25:28] in satan's eden an evening messenger and
[1:25:31] identify
[1:25:32] the characteristics that was taking
[1:25:34] place it was
[1:25:35] seeds that was being called out in that
[1:25:37] way
[1:25:38] the reason the delinquency is the way it
[1:25:40] is now is because the
[1:25:42] church got away and they rejected
[1:25:45] the word of the living god and now
[1:25:48] they're left to their own devices
[1:25:51] this is why you have those things all
[1:25:53] the way and the young people and those
[1:25:55] that's out there
[1:25:56] going all their ways what is it there's
[1:25:58] no purpose in life
[1:26:00] they're looking for purpose and there's
[1:26:02] always the enemies out there to try to
[1:26:04] scoop them up and try to give them a
[1:26:06] purpose and help them to be a channel
[1:26:08] you realize in the days of noah the
[1:26:11] bible says the earth
[1:26:12] was filled with violence through them
[1:26:16] they became channels for demonic
[1:26:19] expression but there was a man on earth
[1:26:23] by the name of noah who found grace in
[1:26:26] the
[1:26:26] eyes of god he became a channel
[1:26:29] where righteousness could be expressed
[1:26:35] hallelujah what an important time
[1:26:39] that we are living in
[1:26:43] we're living in an hour notice as it
[1:26:45] goes on in romans 13
[1:26:46] 7 render therefore to all their dues
[1:26:49] tribute to whom tribute is due
[1:26:51] custom to whom custom fear to whom fear
[1:26:54] honor to whom honor
[1:26:57] servants be subject to your masters with
[1:27:00] all fear
[1:27:01] that's reverence that's not that's not
[1:27:04] that that's not the kind of fear he
[1:27:05] taught my reverence
[1:27:09] brother brown tells us if you can't
[1:27:10] respect the man
[1:27:12] you respect the office that they hold
[1:27:18] not only to the good and gentle
[1:27:21] but also to the forward
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:25] well i don't know but i'd say lord just
[1:27:28] give me the good and gentle
[1:27:31] that's what my flesh called for lord
[1:27:32] give me the good lord i i'll take this
[1:27:35] burden
[1:27:35] give me the good and gentle one lord
[1:27:37] lord i prefer my brother give him the
[1:27:39] forward one lord
[1:27:42] not one of us would want the we don't
[1:27:44] want the forward one right
[1:27:46] and yet some of the very things that
[1:27:48] we're trying to escape
[1:27:50] from is the very tools that god will use
[1:27:55] to mold and shape us understand i trust
[1:27:58] that you have the understanding i'm not
[1:28:00] talking about somebody
[1:28:01] standing around and taking abuse or or
[1:28:03] this or that taking place in the
[1:28:04] workplace that's not right
[1:28:08] are you with me i'm saying where there's
[1:28:10] things that get evaluated that if it's
[1:28:12] constant and you look at it and you
[1:28:14] really have a real true evaluation
[1:28:16] and you've constantly got problems at
[1:28:18] work
[1:28:20] you might want to go look in the mirror
[1:28:24] i'm going to preach because it ain't
[1:28:26] everybody
[1:28:27] else when it starts happening like that
[1:28:30] it's just like somebody says well this
[1:28:32] pastor this this pastor that
[1:28:33] this church this this church this i got
[1:28:36] news for you
[1:28:37] it ain't all the churches and the
[1:28:38] pastors it's called look in the mirror
[1:28:42] because if it's the same things the same
[1:28:44] baggage is there
[1:28:45] oh my goodness
[1:28:46] [Music]
[1:28:48] come on friends these are things god
[1:28:51] god's not here to condemn us he's here
[1:28:52] to help us
[1:28:53] and set us free it's going home time
[1:28:59] amen i think we understand that and to
[1:29:01] have wisdom to look at it correctly
[1:29:03] for this is thank worthy if a man for
[1:29:06] conscience toward god
[1:29:07] endure grief suffering wrongfully for
[1:29:10] what
[1:29:10] glory is it if when you be buffeted for
[1:29:13] your faults
[1:29:14] you take them patiently but if when you
[1:29:16] do well and suffer for it
[1:29:18] you take it patiently that is acceptable
[1:29:21] with god
[1:29:26] here titus 3 1
[1:29:30] can i have just a few more moments thank
[1:29:32] you
[1:29:36] i'll read quick like brother john
[1:29:37] lafontaine say i'll pray i'll preach
[1:29:39] quick you listen fast
[1:29:42] but notice how titus
[1:29:45] would be instructed by paul now we read
[1:29:47] some scriptures before titus 3
[1:29:50] last week where he said these things
[1:29:52] teach and exhort or a couple weeks ago
[1:29:53] these things teach and exhort
[1:29:55] exhort the servants so this was part
[1:29:57] this was not tracks that were handed out
[1:29:59] there was actually services that titus
[1:30:02] took
[1:30:02] and preached on these things you know
[1:30:05] why
[1:30:06] titus was a pastor these are not the
[1:30:09] kind of things that you
[1:30:10] necessarily would go preach out in a
[1:30:11] convention
[1:30:13] it's it's there's a total different
[1:30:14] thing that's going on but this is a time
[1:30:17] where
[1:30:17] it's exhorting the believer it's
[1:30:19] encouraging them in the manner not
[1:30:21] not necessarily of things that maybe
[1:30:22] they don't even know but it's to remind
[1:30:24] us and god comes down
[1:30:26] in that season to encourage you and i
[1:30:28] when you and i
[1:30:29] are going through the battle here we are
[1:30:31] under the pressure
[1:30:32] and the word of the lord comes to
[1:30:34] encourage you and i
[1:30:35] it don't mold us the word itself don't
[1:30:38] come and shape us
[1:30:39] anybody what it does is encourages us to
[1:30:41] lay down our will
[1:30:45] put them in mind to be subject to
[1:30:47] principalities and powers
[1:30:48] to obey magistrates to be ready to every
[1:30:50] good work to speak
[1:30:52] evil of no man to be no
[1:30:56] brawlers but gentle
[1:30:59] showing all meekness unto all
[1:31:03] men who got quiet
[1:31:08] now watch how paul would bring this i
[1:31:11] love this
[1:31:11] this is where we stand we resolve from
[1:31:14] for we ourselves were sometimes
[1:31:17] foolish disobedient
[1:31:21] deceived serving divers lust and
[1:31:23] pleasures living in malice and envy
[1:31:25] hateful
[1:31:26] and hating one another but after that
[1:31:29] the kindness and love of
[1:31:30] our god our savior toward man
[1:31:34] appeared what was it
[1:31:37] had a meeting with melchizedek
[1:31:41] begin to reveal who you really are
[1:31:45] hallelujah not by works of righteousness
[1:31:48] which we have done well i'm going to
[1:31:49] stop doing this and stop doing that
[1:31:51] but it's the by the word we're laying it
[1:31:54] down by the unction of the word
[1:31:56] but according to his mercy he saved us
[1:31:59] by the washing of regeneration
[1:32:03] the transforming power renewing of the
[1:32:06] holy ghost which he shed on us
[1:32:08] abundantly through jesus christ
[1:32:10] our savior that being justified by his
[1:32:13] grace
[1:32:14] we should be made heirs according to the
[1:32:16] hope of eternal life you know what
[1:32:17] paul's just let it be known
[1:32:19] the reason you're different is because
[1:32:22] he came to you
[1:32:27] and they need you to be jesus to them
[1:32:33] hallelujah they might never read the
[1:32:36] bible
[1:32:36] but let it be that it's that life of the
[1:32:40] word that's projecting itself through
[1:32:42] you
[1:32:43] that what has appeared to you that
[1:32:46] marvelous
[1:32:46] light that brought you out of darkness
[1:32:49] that same light
[1:32:50] would shine forth
[1:32:54] this is a faithful saying and these
[1:32:56] things i will but thou
[1:32:57] affirm constantly
[1:33:02] now so this wasn't just a one weekend
[1:33:04] deal
[1:33:06] keep revisiting it that they which have
[1:33:09] believed in god
[1:33:10] might be careful to maintain good works
[1:33:13] these things are good and profitable
[1:33:16] unto men
[1:33:17] philippians 2 14 do all things
[1:33:20] without murmurings and disputings
[1:33:25] okay say lord help me help me he can
[1:33:28] he'll come to that lord help me you see
[1:33:32] what god is doing sometimes the
[1:33:34] circumstances that we said
[1:33:36] we're so interested in getting out oh i
[1:33:38] got to get out of this way
[1:33:40] when i get out of this i'll just be a
[1:33:41] better christian but god uses
[1:33:44] circumstances
[1:33:45] to mold us and shape us
[1:33:50] taking away parts that's really not
[1:33:53] us parts that we've been praying
[1:33:56] god let me die more to myself and god
[1:33:59] knows
[1:34:00] you and i wouldn't just do that just lay
[1:34:02] it down but it takes
[1:34:04] character mourning through suffering
[1:34:09] this is why that you might be blameless
[1:34:11] and harmless the sons of god
[1:34:13] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:34:15] and perverse
[1:34:16] nation among whom you shine as lights
[1:34:20] in the world holding forth the word of
[1:34:22] life
[1:34:25] let me end here
[1:34:30] here was a man down
[1:34:34] there in the book of esther by the name
[1:34:36] of mordecai
[1:34:38] her uncle there came a man one day
[1:34:42] here's haman haman gets up into a high
[1:34:45] position
[1:34:48] haman his heart is filled with hatred
[1:34:51] to the jews
[1:34:55] but he so he comes by all of them down
[1:34:58] through the
[1:34:59] you know coming out of the palace and so
[1:35:01] forth and everybody's bowing to him and
[1:35:04] oh yes amen and yes haman
[1:35:07] now mordecai's not a disobedient guy he
[1:35:10] submits himself to all the ordinance of
[1:35:12] men
[1:35:13] but that crossed the line right there
[1:35:16] mordecai said
[1:35:17] i ain't bowing to you i'm not doing that
[1:35:21] kind of reverence
[1:35:22] to you i'll reverence the position and
[1:35:25] if you say
[1:35:26] go do this or instruct this i'll do that
[1:35:30] but as far as bowing to you i ain't
[1:35:32] bowing
[1:35:33] i am worshiping no man
[1:35:37] you see this is discernment in the time
[1:35:40] of pressure when pressure was coming
[1:35:44] here was mordecai able to discern
[1:35:47] that what he should submit to and what
[1:35:51] should not be submitted to is that right
[1:35:54] brother branham himself over and over if
[1:35:57] you take it and just type in the word
[1:35:59] cuffs
[1:35:59] c-u-f-f-s and where he deals with how
[1:36:02] he's been brought in before
[1:36:03] kings and they you know take the cuffs
[1:36:05] out of the trousers and
[1:36:07] they do all these things and you got to
[1:36:08] walk before them and you can't never
[1:36:10] turn your back you got to back away from
[1:36:12] them
[1:36:12] you know you back up like this and you
[1:36:14] walk out and there's even how you talk
[1:36:16] to him and
[1:36:16] he brother brown says you don't say hey
[1:36:18] buddy or or this or that you know
[1:36:20] there's a way that you
[1:36:21] you talk to him brother brown would take
[1:36:22] that and think of all the messages on
[1:36:24] approach to god god's provided a way of
[1:36:26] approach
[1:36:26] brother brown would take that that
[1:36:28] experience and he would deal with that
[1:36:30] now
[1:36:31] he's had those experiences with kings in
[1:36:33] the natural
[1:36:35] he had a meeting with the pope that was
[1:36:37] arranged you've heard this
[1:36:39] they did they took the cuffs out and
[1:36:41] everything else and brother brown asked
[1:36:43] him he said now
[1:36:44] he said when i get in there what do i
[1:36:46] have to do all you got to do is bow down
[1:36:47] on a knee
[1:36:48] and kiss his hand he said that's out of
[1:36:50] the picture
[1:36:54] billy graham met with him
[1:36:58] all the rest of them met with him
[1:37:01] but here stood a prophet of god in this
[1:37:04] age let me tell you something
[1:37:06] that wasn't just the genes of branham
[1:37:08] that was a gene of god right there
[1:37:10] brother
[1:37:11] that was an elect child of god that was
[1:37:14] standing there
[1:37:16] that would represent the wheat coming to
[1:37:18] maturity in this
[1:37:20] hour that will not bow the creeds will
[1:37:23] not
[1:37:23] bow to darkness we'll not bow to the
[1:37:26] doctrines of man
[1:37:28] but we'll stand with just saith the lord
[1:37:34] hallelujah there's a strength and a
[1:37:37] power
[1:37:38] and a vision that has come with this
[1:37:40] message
[1:37:41] it's brought a boldness not an arrogance
[1:37:44] but a
[1:37:44] boldness to stand on thus saith the lord
[1:37:52] knowing the authority that we're under
[1:37:57] and that authority being governed to
[1:37:59] recognize
[1:38:01] things that come temptations come
[1:38:04] to act unbecomingly or rudely you can be
[1:38:07] pulled temptation is not sin
[1:38:11] you might have even succumbed to it but
[1:38:12] the spirit of god on the inside of you
[1:38:14] charity will not accept that
[1:38:18] you know what that means you're going
[1:38:20] through that test again
[1:38:23] and sometimes there's just certain
[1:38:24] things about us the way that we're made
[1:38:26] up
[1:38:27] well it's just a lot that's got to be
[1:38:29] rubbed out
[1:38:31] sometimes you wonder wonder why i
[1:38:33] attract these kind of people
[1:38:35] it's because there's certain things
[1:38:37] that's got to be rubbed out
[1:38:40] y'all going to preach with me
[1:38:43] god knows what it takes to expose
[1:38:47] the greenness in our life because man we
[1:38:49] feel like
[1:38:50] our raps are ready wish everybody else
[1:38:52] just get caught up here

[1:38:56] y'all you sorry hurry up and
[1:38:58] god says hmm

[1:39:13] i just want to submit i want to submit i
[1:39:17] i don't want to resist him

[1:39:20] fight the trial or the test
[1:39:22] i don't want to fight when the offenses
[1:39:24] and those things come brother samuel
[1:39:25] what should we do
[1:39:26] we should pray over brother brown would
[1:39:28] say it like this on the message super
[1:39:30] sense i find all throughout the message
[1:39:32] brother brown and there's things that
[1:39:33] where especially you'll find i know you

[1:39:36] in the tabernacle a lot i've noticed it
[1:39:38] when he's there in the tabernacle hill
[1:39:39] there's a lot of counsel that'll come
[1:39:41] out with things
[1:39:42] that's even taking place in the
[1:39:43] tabernacle and how to handle different
[1:39:45] things things that's coming up and
[1:39:46] brother braham says
[1:39:47] he said you just pray he said until you
[1:39:50] feel better about that person keep
[1:39:52] praying
[1:39:52] until you feel better about that person
[1:39:55] because it's something about it as you

[1:50:49] a lot of things you can see really take
[1:50:51] form
[1:50:52] wow it's that's a big difference but
[1:50:54] when it gets down to some of the
[1:50:56] finishing touches it isn't things that
[1:50:59] all together you're seeing
[1:51:00] fly off here this file but it's things
[1:51:04] that's necessary
[1:51:06] for the finishing touches just like
[1:51:09] it changes with wood and things like
[1:51:11] that when you're
[1:51:12] working with wood it'll change from
[1:51:15] where you're cutting it with the saw
[1:51:16] and things like this and then to
[1:51:18] eventually get down to a spot
[1:51:20] you've got sandpaper on it you're
[1:51:22] putting a certain type of finish on and
[1:51:24] it's not a maybe a real heavy sandpaper
[1:51:26] you're down to a detailing
[1:51:28] time in it and there's certain times in
[1:51:31] our life
[1:51:31] god's bringing us to in this hour you
[1:51:33] may not seem like you're seeing a lot of
[1:51:35] chunks fly off
[1:51:36] that don't mean that there's not work
[1:51:38] going on
[1:51:39] it's a time of finishing touches
[1:51:43] it's a time of of detailing
[1:51:46] and i'm grateful until the time that
[1:51:49] of the rapture or go by the way of the
[1:51:52] grave
