[54:45] here with us yeah I appreciate them
[54:52] being here and so Lord willing maybe you
[54:56] know we don't want to put too much
[54:57] pressure on brother Jerry but maybe some
[55:00] of you can kind of get him off to the
[55:01] side twist his arm a little bit because
[55:05] we certainly we I didn't want to I left
[55:08] it up to him and I understand as you
[55:10] would too
[55:11] but the Lord willing we'll be able to
[55:13] get a chance to hear from him here and
[55:15] just so appreciate brother Jerry and you
[55:18] know I don't say this because he's my
[55:20] brother
[55:21] when I grow up I want to preach like him
[55:28] so you pray for me he can he can get it
[55:33] done in a little few minutes and
[55:35] sometimes I have to work or maybe sweat
[55:37] a little bit more so I need more wisdom
[55:39] on that right there the Lord to help me
[55:41] but I really appreciate his ministry
[55:43] that's I've seen the blessing here I've
[55:46] seen the effects of it when we've been
[55:47] together overseas together and I just so
[55:50] appreciate our brother so we want to
[55:54] turn into the word of the Lord this
[55:56] morning and I'm just going to just
[55:58] express some things it's just on my
[56:00] heart out of Genesis 23 and perhaps some
[56:05] of the direction I'll go it's not it's
[56:07] not going to be anything and of course I
[56:10] would never want anything to be new or
[56:13] strange or different we we want to be
[56:15] right in step with the Lord and I just
[56:18] believe that God has a way of taking
[56:19] things and unfolding it to our hearts
[56:22] and ministering to to the time and where
[56:25] we're at so we want to look here in
[56:28] Genesis 23 and I'm going to read a few
[56:30] verses of Scripture then I'll let you
[56:31] have your seats this morning in Genesis
[56:35] 23 verse 1 and Sarah was a hundred and
[56:39] seven and twenty years old these were
[56:42] the years of the life of Sarah and Sarah
[56:45] died in her Jeff Arbor the same as
[56:48] Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham
[56:52] came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for
[56:55] her and Abraham stood up from before his
[56:59] dead and speaking to the sons of Heth I
[57:02] want you to notice that word half it
[57:05] means terror he stood in the presence of
[57:08] terror and said I am a stranger and a
[57:13] sojourner with you give me a possession
[57:17] of a burying-place with you that I may
[57:21] bury my dead out of sight may the Lord
[57:25] bless the reading of the word as you're
[57:26] being seated
[57:29] I just want to speak perhaps for a few
[57:33] moments on yeah that right there the
[57:37] revelation of the place of resurrection
[57:41] we find we know that through the
[57:43] Scriptures the scriptures themselves
[57:45] it's all the the Bible is a complete as
[57:50] every scripture is given by inspiration
[57:51] of God it all comes together with one
[57:55] complete goal and one desired
[57:58] achievement that God would achieve and
[58:01] we find that in many of the lives here
[58:03] there were types and shadows that were
[58:07] laid out that would speak of redemption
[58:10] that would speak of the working of the
[58:15] Lord in Redemption and we we want to
[58:18] just look at this for a moment but I
[58:20] just want to pause here for a minute
[58:22] there are many places in the scripture
[58:24] and when we we find here in in in the
[58:28] Bible we find here a situation or we
[58:31] find what has or what has come about is
[58:33] sarah has passed on and Abraham in verse
[58:37] 2 he has come to mourn and to weep for
[58:40] her and you realize that you know you
[58:44] the mourning and the weeping that
[58:46] Abraham was even displaying here was
[58:50] because of such a love that he had for
[58:53] Sarah I want just not to take this just
[58:58] lightly we we know that brother Branham
[59:02] would continue to refer to Abraham and
[59:05] Sarah as sweethearts of the Bible and to
[59:10] know that within this of sweethearts in
[59:13] all the scriptures would refer in 1st
[59:16] Peter chapter 3 and I'm not going to
[59:18] read all of those scriptures but it
[59:21] would refer to how that that even Sarah
[59:25] in her approach to Abraham and even as
[59:30] it would speak of how that even those in
[59:33] verse 5 it would talk about even how
[59:36] that the holy women of all
[59:38] who trusted in God they adorned
[59:40] themselves being in subjection unto
[59:42] their own husbands even as Sara obeyed
[59:45] Abraham calling him Lord whose daughters
[59:49] ye are as long as you do well and are
[59:52] not afraid with any amazement in reality
[59:55] is to understand that as a son and son
[59:59] of Abraham as a daughter of Abraham is
[1:00:02] that which is born of that same royal
[1:00:06] seed life remember it was Isaac himself
[1:00:10] Isaac was the the Promised One of
[1:00:13] Nathaniel good to see you man I didn't
[1:00:15] even recognize you probably cuz you got
[1:00:18] the same haircut I do pardon me but you
[1:00:22] know Isaac was the one in whom God said
[1:00:25] I will establish my covenant and we
[1:00:27] recognized that Isaac it was a type of
[1:00:30] of Christ and we see that within it you
[1:00:34] know when we look at this there's so
[1:00:35] much within it I'm not going to preach a
[1:00:37] family service here but you and you look
[1:00:40] at how that Sarah in Genesis 18 she
[1:00:42] would call Abraham Lord this was not it
[1:00:45] was made clear in the scriptures here
[1:00:47] that Abraham was not called Lord by
[1:00:51] Sarah because Sarah was afraid of
[1:00:53] Abraham the Scriptures have already
[1:00:55] declared that Abraham himself when it
[1:00:58] would even give and Express how that the
[1:01:01] the adorning should be that of a quiet
[1:01:03] and a meek spirit it should be the
[1:01:05] hidden man of the heart which is in
[1:01:07] which is not corruptible and we know
[1:01:10] that that would speak of the hidden man
[1:01:12] of it being Christ within the life of a
[1:01:15] believer we also realized that even
[1:01:17] within any marriage that within any
[1:01:20] marriage there the husband himself
[1:01:22] cannot come and begin he could but he
[1:01:26] won't work he can't demand and say well
[1:01:28] I'm head of the house or I'm this or
[1:01:30] that but remember leadership itself is
[1:01:32] to lead is to take is to take the reins
[1:01:35] by God's Word and be an example and to
[1:01:39] lead and and and let the atmosphere of
[1:01:41] the Holy Spirit just be so present in
[1:01:44] your life to think when I look at this
[1:01:46] how that Sarah herself she was not
[1:01:48] calling Abraham
[1:01:50] Lord out of fear but even there in
[1:01:53] Genesis 18 and you look when we look at
[1:01:55] that in Genesis 18 and you think about
[1:01:57] down through the previous scriptures
[1:02:00] Abraham and Sarah were on a journey
[1:02:02] together even though Sarah was not
[1:02:06] mentioned at first within that of the
[1:02:08] promise her name called out but yet she
[1:02:12] was identified with in there and God
[1:02:14] would later unfold that in in that time
[1:02:18] in Genesis 17 and when he would change
[1:02:21] Abraham's name to Abraham and he would
[1:02:24] change
[1:02:25] sorry i's name to Sarah and he or she
[1:02:29] would call him Lord and I want you to
[1:02:30] consider this she did not call Abraham
[1:02:33] Lord because Abraham had been a mistake
[1:02:36] free husband because let's remember he's
[1:02:41] one he's the one that told he's the one
[1:02:43] that told her you tell him that you know
[1:02:45] we're not husband and wife I don't want
[1:02:47] to get killed but there had to be we can
[1:02:52] go on and on down through that there had
[1:02:54] to be such a unity that was brought
[1:02:57] about of forgiveness but remember you
[1:03:00] can't have forgiveness without having
[1:03:02] love love is what brings about
[1:03:05] forgiveness love itself is what produces
[1:03:08] faith and faith is itself is based on
[1:03:11] forgiveness so it had to be something of
[1:03:14] a reality that was cultivated there in
[1:03:17] their home did they see one another's
[1:03:18] mistakes they did but you see through
[1:03:21] all the tests through all the trials
[1:03:22] through all the mistakes through all
[1:03:24] that was seen as Sarah herself she never
[1:03:27] removed herself from that leadership
[1:03:29] that God had placed her because one
[1:03:31] thing that I cannot believe that we can
[1:03:33] agree on
[1:03:34] she knew that Abraham had contact with
[1:03:36] God and when Abraham was wrong Abraham
[1:03:39] was willing to say forgive me I'm wrong
[1:03:41] this is what God has said that bring
[1:03:46] that brings a strength it brings a peace
[1:03:48] it brings a confidence and so to find
[1:03:51] that where this was such a love affair
[1:03:53] that was between Abraham and Sarah to
[1:03:57] where has we a broken here on the
[1:04:00] scriptures of where that Abraham himself
[1:04:04] would find a burying-place Sarah here he
[1:04:09] was in the land of Canaan but he there
[1:04:11] was a there was a burden upon his heart
[1:04:14] that I must find a burying-place an
[1:04:17] appropriate bearing place for Sarah and
[1:04:21] so when we look at this the Bible goes
[1:04:23] on to tell us in Genesis 23 verse 16 it
[1:04:27] says Abraham harkened under ephraim and
[1:04:30] abram way to a from the silver which he
[1:04:33] had named in the audience of the sons of
[1:04:35] Heth four hundred shekels of silver
[1:04:37] current money with the merchants and the
[1:04:39] field of a front which was in Machpelah
[1:04:42] which was before Mamre the field and the
[1:04:45] cave which was there in all the trees
[1:04:47] that were in the field that were in all
[1:04:49] the borders roundabouts were made sure
[1:04:52] unto Abraham for a possession in the
[1:04:56] presence of the children of Heth before
[1:04:58] all the dannion at the gate of his City
[1:05:01] and after this Abraham buried Sarah his
[1:05:05] wife in the cave of the field of
[1:05:08] Machpelah before Mamre the same is
[1:05:11] hebron in the land of canaan
[1:05:14] and the field and the cave that is there
[1:05:16] and were made sure unto abraham for a
[1:05:19] position of a burying-place
[1:05:21] by the sons of Heth now in in scriptures
[1:05:25] before that abraham had requested a a
[1:05:29] Sepulcher a tomb a burial place remember
[1:05:33] if Ron here when Abraham had had had had
[1:05:37] by unction Abraham chose this of a front
[1:05:41] and he's narrowed it down I want this
[1:05:43] place right here this is where I want
[1:05:46] our dead to be buried
[1:05:49] and remember in here in the scriptures
[1:05:52] that if Ron was going to give it to
[1:05:55] Abraham for free you can have it you
[1:05:59] don't need to pay it you don't need to
[1:06:01] pay us for anything but Abraham himself
[1:06:03] he refused for it just to be given to
[1:06:07] him but he said that there must be a
[1:06:10] price that was made Abraham did not try
[1:06:12] to barter the price
[1:06:14] it was not going to be just halfway just
[1:06:17] a little bit but it will had to be what
[1:06:20] is the full required price what's the
[1:06:23] value of this and this is where Efron
[1:06:26] would let it be known four hundred
[1:06:28] shekels of silver this was in the
[1:06:30] presence in the audience of the sons of
[1:06:32] Heth and here within that moment this
[1:06:35] purchase was made the money was weighed
[1:06:38] it was determined that this money it was
[1:06:41] not just silver coins that maybe didn't
[1:06:45] have the appropriate weight but every
[1:06:47] one of these shekels had the appropriate
[1:06:50] weight let me just tell you something
[1:06:52] this was a type of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:55] when Satan himself because this earth
[1:06:58] does not belong to Satan he's a squatter
[1:07:03] on this earth
[1:07:04] it belongs to Almighty God and the sons
[1:07:07] of God and when the devil took him up in
[1:07:12] Matthew Fortis would just refer to their
[1:07:14] he made and he dried to draw him into
[1:07:17] many different temptations if you fall
[1:07:19] down and worship me I'll give you all
[1:07:22] the kingdoms of this world and he said
[1:07:24] get behind me Satan hallelujah amen for
[1:07:29] thou shalt worship the Lord thy god in
[1:07:32] him alone shall worship he knew he knew
[1:07:37] by promise of the word that he would
[1:07:40] fall heir to every one of these kingdoms
[1:07:43] in the Millennium he was looking at it
[1:07:46] by that of sight and then to understand
[1:07:49] that it had to be an appropriate weight
[1:07:52] it could not be a man that was born in
[1:07:55] sin shaped in iniquity there had to come
[1:07:58] one where God would make a body God
[1:08:01] himself by that of creation God would
[1:08:05] create a body that God would be able to
[1:08:08] step down and pay the price for it could
[1:08:11] not be something that wasn't that was
[1:08:13] without the density of God's character
[1:08:16] the four hundred shekels it had to come
[1:08:19] with the very essence of this character
[1:08:22] it would be weighed in the scriptures in
[1:08:24] a just balance
[1:08:25] and it would be found that indeed this
[1:08:28] was the necessary prize and we read that
[1:08:32] in Isaiah 53 we find that price was made
[1:08:40] it was to restore what was lost in the
[1:08:45] fall to buy back the earth belong to God
[1:08:52] to buy it back we find that the
[1:08:56] scripture would go on to say in Genesis
[1:08:59] 25 we would find that where it would
[1:09:03] speak in in in in verse 8 of Genesis 25
[1:09:07] then Abraham gave up the ghost and died
[1:09:10] in a good old age and old men and full
[1:09:14] of years he served this purpose and was
[1:09:18] gathered to his people he goes on to
[1:09:21] speak of how that Isaac and Ishmael
[1:09:22] buried him in the Cave of Machpelah he
[1:09:26] goes on in verse 10 and says this was
[1:09:29] the field which Abraham purchased of the
[1:09:31] sons of Heth there was Abraham buried
[1:09:33] and Sarah his wife we will find that I'm
[1:09:36] not going to read all the scriptures
[1:09:38] here that are before me but to
[1:09:40] understand that in each one of these
[1:09:43] times when it came time and Jacob's
[1:09:45] passing here they are outside of the
[1:09:48] land of promise this was the land of
[1:09:51] promise this was that where it was it
[1:09:54] was made known this is the land of
[1:09:57] promise and noticed that within and how
[1:10:00] God had revealed to Abraham that he
[1:10:02] would you know give unto his seed for a
[1:10:06] possession you know for an inheritance
[1:10:08] Jacob has outside of the land Israel's
[1:10:11] outside of the land down in Egypt and
[1:10:12] Jacob passes on but before Jacob passes
[1:10:16] Oum he under inspiration let's known to
[1:10:20] each of the tribes of Israel revealing
[1:10:23] the characteristic that was within them
[1:10:26] and also their position in the land and
[1:10:29] then within it all he would give them a
[1:10:32] commandment and said maybe I want you to
[1:10:34] go bury me in that
[1:10:37] same cave that same field where Abraham
[1:10:41] and Sarah are buried I want you to said
[1:10:45] because it is there where Isaac and
[1:10:47] Rebecca are buried it is there where I
[1:10:50] buried Leah you see he is making sure
[1:10:54] that they are going to take him to this
[1:10:57] place don't leave me in Egypt don't you
[1:11:00] bury me here in Egypt when Joseph tan
[1:11:04] would come as it would be a root of
[1:11:08] their and how that you know Joseph and
[1:11:10] the rest of of his brethren they would
[1:11:13] take they would leave Egypt and take
[1:11:15] Jacob and they would bury him there him
[1:11:18] in that Sepulcher that was there that
[1:11:22] Abraham description would always refer
[1:11:24] to it that Abraham bought and purchased
[1:11:28] he would go on Genesis and speak of
[1:11:31] Joseph of how that Joseph when he was
[1:11:34] that was at the point of dying you see
[1:11:37] because here on this earth we have no
[1:11:39] continuing City there is a purpose that
[1:11:42] God has intended for you and I had to
[1:11:44] serve it was the same thing with Abraham
[1:11:47] and Sarah there was a purpose for them
[1:11:49] to serve and we find that Joseph here he
[1:11:52] was recognizing that the time of my
[1:11:56] departure is at hand he would say unto
[1:11:58] his brother and behold I die but he made
[1:12:01] them he made them aware he said when God
[1:12:04] the God who God will surely visit you
[1:12:07] you see there was a promise that they
[1:12:11] were living by that God is going to
[1:12:14] visit you when God visits God doesn't
[1:12:21] leave you where he finds you his visit
[1:12:25] comes with a purpose and this is what
[1:12:29] Joseph is recalling the promise that was
[1:12:32] made real to Abraham it was made real to
[1:12:36] Isaac it was made real to Jacob but what
[1:12:39] had been eight promise are you listening
[1:12:41] now what had been a promise
[1:12:43] it was now a time this is no longer the
[1:12:47] and the time of a promise to come we are
[1:12:50] living in the promise in the time for
[1:12:52] the fulfillment when all the rest of the
[1:12:55] ages have looked forward to we are
[1:12:57] living in a meant to be able to declare
[1:13:02] that this is the hour this is the time
[1:13:05] this is the season and Joseph would let
[1:13:08] them know that my bones don't you leave
[1:13:10] them here you take them with you when
[1:13:13] God visits you and the Bible would
[1:13:17] record of how that Moses it would speak
[1:13:20] and express it in the book of Exodus of
[1:13:22] how that Moses took the bones of Joseph
[1:13:25] and would not leave it within that place
[1:13:29] and then it goes on in the book of
[1:13:31] Joshua and speaks of how that they are
[1:13:34] buried they bury their taking that of
[1:13:37] Joseph and they buried there in that
[1:13:40] same place of where Abraham had had made
[1:13:44] the purchase now when we look at this
[1:13:47] here there's a scripture I want to read
[1:13:48] in Deuteronomy 29:29 a little scripture
[1:13:52] but it means a lot it says the secret
[1:13:55] things belonging to the Lord our God but
[1:13:59] those things which are revealed belong
[1:14:03] unto us when God reveals his word
[1:14:09] remember revelation is sovereignly given
[1:14:13] it's not because that were any better
[1:14:17] remember God let him know and
[1:14:19] Deuteronomy 4 he said the Lord had not
[1:14:21] done this yeah you know in a manner
[1:14:24] because that you would be just for
[1:14:26] special people but he said God has kept
[1:14:29] his promise that he made unto your
[1:14:32] father's we are enjoying the revelation
[1:14:36] and even where we are sitting on the
[1:14:38] threshold of the rapture even right now
[1:14:41] the rapture which we are dwelling within
[1:14:43] even now this is the promise that God
[1:14:47] had made unto the father's
[1:14:51] these secret things their secret you
[1:14:53] can't pry them out
[1:14:54] we can't pry em out these are things
[1:14:56] that God in His sovereignty will
[1:14:59] divinely reveal and I just say it to you
[1:15:01] like this even when it comes to needs in
[1:15:04] your life and even maybe you're sitting
[1:15:06] here saying I don't see all this clearly
[1:15:08] III lord I need you to speak to me have
[1:15:11] an open heart and say Lord will you come
[1:15:15] and reveal this word me Lord reveal this
[1:15:19] message to me Lord I want it to be
[1:15:22] something that is a part of me and I'm a
[1:15:24] part of it I see what you are in the
[1:15:28] lives of letters and I want that same
[1:15:30] reality inside of me there's a witness
[1:15:34] right there that you can lay hold on and
[1:15:36] the devil he tries to tell you it's not
[1:15:39] for you God will never tell you that
[1:15:41] that's a lie from Satan hallelujah God
[1:15:47] does not work that way but there's
[1:15:51] something tugging in your heart a hunger
[1:15:54] that's in your heart that says lurid and
[1:15:56] desiring Lord for this that you and make
[1:15:59] yourself known as the brother is say
[1:16:01] it's revelation then I would say like
[1:16:04] this in humility nor reveal yourself to
[1:16:07] me
[1:16:09] [Applause]
[1:16:11] Jesus Jesus cannot refuse a heart of
[1:16:18] humility
[1:16:21] he'll come where he's invited he even
[1:16:24] came to Simon's house
[1:16:26] Simon invited him to make mockery every
[1:16:28] but listen our hearts are not inviting
[1:16:31] him to make mockery of him our hearts
[1:16:33] are inviting him because we're longing
[1:16:35] for him and we know love Jesus reveal
[1:16:39] yourself to me Lord reveal your life to
[1:16:43] me in me and through me Lord I wash your
[1:16:46] feet Lord I'll kiss the son I'll make
[1:16:50] him welcome hallelujah I welcome you in
[1:16:53] my life Lord whatever you want Lord
[1:16:56] Jesus
[1:16:59] no that's simple but that's just as
[1:17:01] simple the Lord is the devil wants to
[1:17:04] make it complicated but it ain't it's
[1:17:08] all about surrender but those things
[1:17:11] which are revealed belong and to us and
[1:17:15] to our children forever once it's
[1:17:20] revealed it can't be unrevealed once you
[1:17:25] see it you can't unsee it because this
[1:17:30] has been a sovereign divine connection
[1:17:34] where God has revealed to you revelation
[1:17:37] is not knowledge revelation is even that
[1:17:40] which you cannot explain but it's
[1:17:42] something that resonates in your heart
[1:17:44] just say it is the truth it's more real
[1:17:51] to us than anything else around us it
[1:17:57] prevails it prevails beyond our emotions
[1:18:02] it prevails beyond any stop that's
[1:18:04] contrary it prevails over complexes it
[1:18:08] prevails above every DNA of every

[1:22:04] come up on the tree what was it it was
[1:22:06] that light that was on the tree it went
[1:22:09] into the ground it was hidden away in
[1:22:11] the winter and then the intensity of the
[1:22:13] Sun as it begins to come around it will
[1:22:16] actually cause that life to come back up
[1:22:18] into that tree what the life they went
[1:22:21] in the ground it will come back up what
[1:22:23] is it it is a resurrection
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:32] and here's job pardon me I just got a
[1:22:36] little bit warm but here's Joe Joe 19
[1:22:42] familiar scripture these aren't words
[1:22:46] that Jill desired to have old that these
[1:22:48] were printed in a book Oh glory verse 25
[1:22:56] of Joel 19 for I know that my Redeemer
[1:23:00] liveth I know you're never because there
[1:23:06] was there was that reality that had
[1:23:09] taken hold upon jobs life that are
[1:23:13] already taken ahold of his life and Joel
[1:23:15] said I know my Redeemer liveth
[1:23:21] you see this right here you can take
[1:23:24] that scripture and breach the Godhead
[1:23:27] because Jesus is not a separate person
[1:23:31] in man our Redeemer
[1:23:33] remember to redeem means to buy back
[1:23:35] bring back what belongs to you we always
[1:23:38] belong to God we come from God we go
[1:23:41] back to God and God came down in a body
[1:23:44] of flesh he came down under the
[1:23:48] anointing of Redeemer in order to redeem
[1:23:51] you and I back and jump said I know my
[1:23:55] redeemer liveth look wonder what he said
[1:23:59] and that he shall stand at the latter
[1:24:02] day upon the earth hallelujah and though
[1:24:11] look at this and though after my skin
[1:24:13] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[1:24:19] shall I see God whom I shall see for
[1:24:24] myself and mine eyes shall behold and
[1:24:28] not another though our reins be consumed
[1:24:31] within me
[1:24:33] Jobe knew my Redeemer liveth he knew
[1:24:38] there was - it was revealed to him
[1:24:42] there is going to be a resurrection
[1:24:45] there is one that is going to stand
[1:24:48] between that of a holy God and a sinful
[1:24:52] man God himself would come down and God
[1:24:55] would span that breach between that of a
[1:24:59] sinful man and a holy God and he would
[1:25:02] span that breach for you and I that vent
[1:25:05] through the release of that life the
[1:25:07] chasm that was within our lives he would
[1:25:10] come by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:13] and remove the chasm that was between us
[1:25:17] and God it would be the abstract to the
[1:25:23] title deed it would be that which would
[1:25:26] Tyus he was that which yokes us to the
[1:25:30] word it's that which unites us are you
[1:25:34] with me
[1:25:34] this is why when it came to Syria he
[1:25:37] came and he put on VH that of life
[1:25:40] though he came what was he doing it was
[1:25:43] that of the life that would come one who
[1:25:46] was able to span the breach one who was
[1:25:50] able to do what they could not do
[1:25:56] Jove had this revelation he had it and
[1:26:00] this is where Abraham had this
[1:26:02] revelation you see it was made known to
[1:26:06] them that's why Abraham you wasn't gonna
[1:26:09] give him just anyway you ain't gonna
[1:26:10] give it to him I'm gonna buy it and not
[1:26:13] just buy anywhere I want this place
[1:26:15] right here because why it was revealed
[1:26:19] this is the place of resurrection they
[1:26:26] were in that same channel that job was
[1:26:28] in God remember we can go on and on with
[1:26:34] this God look here's Abraham election
[1:26:39] here's Jacob grace right here if we have
[1:26:45] Abraham which is which is election we
[1:26:48] have Isaac which is love
[1:26:50] we have Jacob which is Grace and brother
[1:26:52] BAM will say over and over he said
[1:26:53] anybody read the life of Jacob no you
[1:26:55] gotta believe in grace then we have
[1:26:58] Joseph's perfection what do we have the
[1:27:01] pedestal we have that foundation of
[1:27:03] which the body would be built upon the
[1:27:06] masterpiece and each one of them notice
[1:27:10] they were moved by inspiration and
[1:27:13] unction there was a spiritual insight by
[1:27:16] revelation it was that same revelation
[1:27:19] that Abel would have think of it Abel
[1:27:22] and Cain would both go to worship but
[1:27:24] Cain would take fruits and Abel would
[1:27:26] take that of one of the firstlings of
[1:27:29] the flock who told able to take what he
[1:27:32] took it was God who spoke to Abel
[1:27:37] remember Cain was only doing what he
[1:27:39] heard preached it was not revelation but
[1:27:44] you see even though their daddy and Mama
[1:27:47] because look if Adam and Eve had told
[1:27:49] them anything differ look what it would
[1:27:51] have exposed about Adam and Eve but
[1:27:52] there was something within Abel there
[1:27:54] was a long and there was a longing in
[1:27:56] both of them
[1:27:57] to worship but with enable there was a
[1:27:59] longing to get back to life there was a
[1:28:04] long he didn't put that longing in there
[1:28:07] and unit put that
[1:28:09] in your life you might have tried to
[1:28:12] satisfy with a lot of other things but
[1:28:14] that terms can only be quenched by the
[1:28:18] lord himself you can't satisfy that
[1:28:22] first with the things of the world it
[1:28:24] only leaves you empty it only brings
[1:28:26] death but pad of God when you begin to
[1:28:30] satisfy that first on the inside and say
[1:28:33] Lord Jesus
[1:28:34] seal me Lord God Lord speak to my heart
[1:28:37] Lord leave me but I'll tell you you
[1:28:40] begin to be led from death unto life you
[1:28:47] led to a place of victory in your life
[1:28:52] people did not do this Abraham did not
[1:28:55] do it Joe they did not make it happen it
[1:28:57] was sovereignly given it was a mystery
[1:29:01] that was in their life and the only way
[1:29:05] a mystery becomes clear it's got to come
[1:29:08] where God will come personally and he
[1:29:11] will teach that to you and I your life
[1:29:15] and my life he came back to like the
[1:29:17] Tabernacle in the wilderness a man can
[1:29:20] unpack my life but the Lord Jesus I
[1:29:23] don't know Kassadin he unpacks our life
[1:29:28] and unfolds the secret of the mystery of
[1:29:32] our life he's the one Michael that
[1:29:34] revealed to my heart this is why I
[1:29:36] couldn't fit in with the world he's the
[1:29:40] reason little Aaron that's the reason it
[1:29:43] was always something about it in my life
[1:29:44] why was I different I tried to fit in I
[1:29:47] tried to fit in Mathew but there was
[1:29:50] something about it I just couldn't fit
[1:29:53] in you know what that was it was the
[1:29:57] mystery that was hidden there in your
[1:30:00] life
[1:30:00] [Applause]
[1:30:11] hallelujah didn't know what it was I
[1:30:14] tried to escape it I did everything it
[1:30:16] looked like going the opposite way I
[1:30:18] didn't know what was going on but one
[1:30:20] day one day he began to speak to my life
[1:30:30] and say you're different you're not like
[1:30:34] the rest what was he doing he was
[1:30:37] calling us and to himself
[1:30:48] and you can never be the same you can
[1:30:53] never be the same
[1:30:55] you have been changed
[1:30:59] he has come and brought deliverance and
[1:31:09] it keeps on unpack in your life this is
[1:31:13] where the candlesticks goes this is who
[1:31:17] you know married this he keeps on
[1:31:18] unpacking in your life because after all
[1:31:21] your life is what set aside as a life of
[1:31:24] service unto the Lord
[1:31:32] don't you loving they this revelation it
[1:31:38] struck their hearts there's a
[1:31:40] resurrection in that resurrection it's
[1:31:42] not in Egypt it's not just anywhere it's
[1:31:48] in Palestine that was of that was God's
[1:31:54] revelation to them now remember this is
[1:31:56] the literal will transfer over here into
[1:31:58] the spell that was a type of the
[1:31:59] spiritual but remember that was a clear
[1:32:02] revelation you could have tried to
[1:32:04] brother William put pressure on earth
[1:32:06] you don't need to go and bury him down
[1:32:07] there why don't run you gotta bear it
[1:32:08] down here why you got to do this for why
[1:32:10] do you have to do that let me preach
[1:32:15] this a moment you know Abraham bought
[1:32:17] that place right you'll read in the book
[1:32:20] of Acts chapter 7 and then you also read
[1:32:22] it in a place there in the book of
[1:32:24] Genesis you read to where he would
[1:32:26] actually display how it had changed
[1:32:28] hands and here Jacob would come with a
[1:32:30] price you know why it cost there is a
[1:32:33] price that every one of us must pay he
[1:32:36] made a way for you and I but the price
[1:32:38] that you and I have to pay is not with
[1:32:41] money it's with our lives
[1:32:49] he's here one road in the Bible there
[1:32:52] one road in here that that was my rope
[1:32:56] but it was a between the lines
[1:33:00] they were prophets and it was revealed
[1:33:03] to them that the first fruits was going
[1:33:05] to come out of Palestine now let's look
[1:33:09] here after Lord Jesus when he came he
[1:33:13] said in John 6:38 I'm come down from
[1:33:15] heaven not to do my own will but the
[1:33:17] will of him that sent me and this is the
[1:33:20] Father's will which has sent me that of
[1:33:22] all which he hath given me I should lose
[1:33:24] nothing but should raise it up again at
[1:33:28] the last day and this is the will of him
[1:33:34] that sent me that everyone that see if
[1:33:36] the Son and believeth on him may have
[1:33:38] everlasting life
[1:33:39] and I will raise him up at the last day
[1:33:46] but the sender I don't know how I'm
[1:33:49] gonna do it isn't about how you're going
[1:33:51] to do it
[1:33:51] this is him keeping his word what do I
[1:33:55] do lift up your eyes look to Mount
[1:34:00] Moriah all of everything else is going
[1:34:04] around lift up your eyes for it is there
[1:34:07] that God made it comes confirmation of
[1:34:10] that covenant it is the Lord Himself
[1:34:13] that provides the strength that you and
[1:34:16] I have need of for the body change that
[1:34:20] is already resting in our bosom he is
[1:34:24] Jehovah Jireh it's not us making
[1:34:32] something happen it's a quickening
[1:34:34] quickening quickening quickening the
[1:34:37] Prophet said we keep quickening and keep
[1:34:39] growing up until we grow up in him in
[1:34:41] rapture so what do I do by the same to
[1:34:46] keep looking in the word God deals with
[1:34:49] your hearts on things so thank you Lord
[1:34:51] it mold me shape me keep on keep on just
[1:34:53] letting God work because it's him that's
[1:34:56] working the Lord will perfect that which
[1:34:58] concerns me
[1:35:02] here came Jesus to the tomb of Lazarus
[1:35:08] and remember when Jesus came he wept
[1:35:12] Lazarus was his friend he stayed in
[1:35:16] their homes many times you with me maybe
[1:35:20] they had Friday night tape meeting so me
[1:35:24] I'll catch it on that one it moved him
[1:35:28] he wept Martha you know when she came
[1:35:36] Jesus told her said in verse 23
[1:35:39] my brother shall rise again and Martha
[1:35:41] said I know he shall rise again in the
[1:35:44] resurrection in the last day
[1:35:45] see she believes in the resurrection but
[1:35:49] Jesus was coming to announce right there
[1:35:51] that I am the resurrection and the life
[1:35:57] he was announcing the very one that
[1:36:01] racism in the resurrection he has come
[1:36:04] down I am the resurrection and the life
[1:36:10] and he that believeth in me not only in
[1:36:13] me though he were dead yet shall he live
[1:36:16] and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:36:18] shall never die
[1:36:19] believe us now this you ever think of
[1:36:22] this for a moment
[1:36:23] maybe I'm odd but Lazarus he goes by the
[1:36:29] way of the grave there's others brother
[1:36:31] just wait waiting in paradise
[1:36:34] Lazarus goes into paradise and remember
[1:36:38] here they are sitting around brother ray
[1:36:39] their fellowship you know any secrets on
[1:36:41] ma'amed I know I saw I know what I saw I
[1:36:43] saw the will in the middle of will
[1:36:44] they're all sitting around fellowship
[1:36:46] and here comes Lazarus right among
[1:36:48] Lazarus said hey you know what he's on
[1:36:51] earth now
[1:36:53] [Applause]
[1:36:57] let's rest made an announcement in
[1:37:00] Paradise the one that you saw you've
[1:37:03] been waiting on
[1:37:04] he's on earth now Alleluia
[1:37:14] man they probably had a praise break
[1:37:16] going all in Paradise town their every
[1:37:19] praise is to uh I mean you know because
[1:37:22] what was that they were ready they had
[1:37:24] been looking for this and the
[1:37:26] announcement came Lazarus said the one
[1:37:29] that you've been waiting on is on earth
[1:37:36] Lazarus said why we're here
[1:37:38] we're getting ready gonna be at any
[1:37:39] moment let's just fellowship a little
[1:37:41] bit
[1:37:42] Lazarus didn't know he was gonna be
[1:37:44] there for a little bit and he got called
[1:37:51] back out of there
[1:37:52] oh brother
[1:37:55] you think about what kind of a stir was
[1:37:58] going on in Paradise I'm telling you
[1:38:01] they were not around with their feet
[1:38:02] propped up sure they were resting but
[1:38:05] brother has their time itself was
[1:38:07] drawing nigh no doubt when that
[1:38:09] announcement came it stirred him up I
[1:38:11] mean they had to be stirred up like bees
[1:38:13] in a hive because this is what they had
[1:38:17] been waiting on this has what this is
[1:38:21] what had caused them to act the way they
[1:38:24] acted and talk the way they talk and
[1:38:26] move from here to there it this is the
[1:38:30] one
[1:38:39] [Music]
[1:38:43] and no Lazarus didn't write no book
[1:38:46] series been there and back
[1:38:51] he had a testimony though he said in
[1:38:58] John 14 let not your heart be troubled
[1:39:00] if you believe in God believe also in me
[1:39:03] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:39:06] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:39:08] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:39:14] go and prepare a place for you I will
[1:39:16] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:39:19] that where I am there ye may be also
[1:39:23] how many looking for that and whither I
[1:39:28] go you know and the way you know Thomas
[1:39:32] said Lord we know not whither thou goest
[1:39:33] how can we how can we know the way Jesus
[1:39:38] said I am the way the truth and the life
[1:39:42] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:39:48] all the recognize that after what was
[1:39:52] needed to be done with the depositing
[1:39:55] paying the penalty of sin and the
[1:39:58] unloading of sin has our scapegoat then
[1:40:02] we found that the Lord Jesus himself he
[1:40:05] taking their of the keys of death and
[1:40:07] hail from offer of Satan and now he
[1:40:10] moves into paradise and he begins to
[1:40:13] gather all of them and as they
[1:40:15] themselves already had a testimony now
[1:40:18] here he comes and when he comes
[1:40:20] brother Drake everyone could say that's
[1:40:23] the one that I saw Abraham said that's
[1:40:26] the one that came to a Sarah this is the
[1:40:28] lon
[1:40:30] Ezekiel said that's the one I saw and he
[1:40:36] led captivity captive
[1:40:40] the price had been prayed the ransom had
[1:40:43] come a messenger had delivered the
[1:40:49] ransom and the Bible says in Matthew 27
[1:40:54] 52 and the graves were opened loose and
[1:41:02] many bodies of the saints which slept
[1:41:05] arose oh yeah and came out of the graves
[1:41:14] after his resurrection and went into the
[1:41:16] holy city and appeared unto many he came
[1:41:20] out first they followed him now notice
[1:41:23] the Bible would go out remember has it
[1:41:25] said here and many of the bodies of the
[1:41:28] saints not all many there were many that
[1:41:31] had been buried in Palestine but not all
[1:41:35] of them were buried with Revelation not
[1:41:40] all were buried with this revelation in
[1:41:42] their heart but many could say this is
[1:41:46] where we as a Israel or as a Jew this is
[1:41:50] where we're to be buried and you know
[1:41:51] even how it speaks and as a ax and how
[1:41:53] that you know it just become a common
[1:41:55] thing and where we just bury here this
[1:41:57] is where were this is where were to be
[1:41:59] buried and he wasn't anything that was
[1:42:01] personal but you see what job it was
[1:42:03] personal I know my redeemer literally
[1:42:06] it was personal with Abraham it was
[1:42:09] personal with Sarah it was personal with
[1:42:12] all of the patriarchs down through there
[1:42:14] and this is why the scripture would say
[1:42:16] in the book of Hebrews these all died in
[1:42:19] faith not having received the promises
[1:42:23] but having seen them afar off
[1:42:27] there's many that's went by the way of
[1:42:30] the grave but they were aware that the
[1:42:33] promise of the rapture is in this hour
[1:42:38] they see them they seen it back eyes of
[1:42:43] faith and were look witnesses were
[1:42:46] persuaded of them when you're persuaded
[1:42:52] nobody can talk you out of it I'm not
[1:42:55] talking about a natural argument I'm not
[1:42:57] talking about up here I'm talking about
[1:43:00] where you are fairly persuaded by the
[1:43:03] love of God in your heart to where you
[1:43:05] yourself are no longer depending on your
[1:43:08] own righteousness but you are depending
[1:43:11] solidly on the righteousness of Almighty
[1:43:14] God and to know that my life is hidden
[1:43:18] in him they were persuaded and embrace
[1:43:24] them took them next to their bosom their
[1:43:31] life revolved around this others didn't
[1:43:37] understand well I can't should go here
[1:43:39] well why can't you go there why can't
[1:43:40] you do this why can't you just you know
[1:43:43] and I'm not even talking about sin but
[1:43:46] it was something to them that said this
[1:43:48] is what God has revealed to me and so
[1:43:53] every decision when it came to a job
[1:43:55] when you would go on and on they
[1:43:57] embraced these promises and confessed
[1:44:03] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[1:44:05] earth this same reality Paul would write
[1:44:13] child that this glorious reality the
[1:44:17] purpose and the grace that was given to
[1:44:20] us before the world began which was in
[1:44:22] Christ Jesus Paul would write in second
[1:44:25] Timothy 1:10 but now is made manifest by
[1:44:29] the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ
[1:44:30] who hath abolished death and hath
[1:44:34] brought life and immortality to light
[1:44:36] through the gospel
[1:44:38] where until I'm appointed a preacher and
[1:44:40] an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles
[1:44:43] God had brought it to light God has
[1:44:46] showed it all think about it they put up
[1:44:51] a seal on that tomb and said go make it
[1:44:57] sure they were trying to make that tomb
[1:45:01] sure as though he couldn't race he was
[1:45:04] not going to raise by his own strength
[1:45:07] come on it was that same quickening
[1:45:09] power they meant God living behind that
[1:45:13] veil of flesh it broke the seal a
[1:45:17] man-made seal it was man selling out
[1:45:22] that brought death in the beginning we
[1:45:26] understand that of the garden I don't
[1:45:27] need to go through that with a woman
[1:45:29] I've been here with the man but notice
[1:45:30] with that seal that was there he it had
[1:45:33] been a mystery it had been all their
[1:45:36] lifetime ever I can say like this and
[1:45:38] Hebrews 2 subject to the fear of death
[1:45:41] in other words the sons of Heth the sons
[1:45:45] of terror terror was all around but one
[1:45:48] would stand in the midst of terror and
[1:45:50] say I'll purchase this one was willing
[1:45:54] to go right in the myth of the terror of
[1:45:57] the heart of the arrows and was able to
[1:46:00] stand there and say I will purchase a
[1:46:03] bearing place hallelujah that we might
[1:46:08] have peace here's our peace he stood in
[1:46:15] the midst hallelujah for you and I and
[1:46:19] he has brought this him mortality and
[1:46:22] life to light through the gospel the
[1:46:24] seal the Roman seal was broken that
[1:46:32] message that had been sealed up was
[1:46:35] unsealed he broke the seals to reveal
[1:46:41] that secret of life after death
[1:46:44] he was the answer the one that was made
[1:46:48] known to Joel Abraham and on and on he
[1:46:50] was that very one
[1:46:51] he trapped openly over principalities he
[1:46:55] led captivity captive they he led them
[1:46:58] up after his resurrection they came out
[1:47:01] and they followed him in a procession of
[1:47:04] triumph and victory Paul would write he
[1:47:13] was the firstfruits you know the
[1:47:17] firstfruits are the one that come to
[1:47:18] maturity first the firstfruits were
[1:47:21] always that that God would have among
[1:47:24] the children of Israel to identify the
[1:47:26] firstfruits that the first church would
[1:47:27] always be identifiable and what the
[1:47:29] firstfruits himself ought to be that
[1:47:31] which has taken and offered unto the
[1:47:33] Lord it's that which is to be brought in
[1:47:36] the house of the Lord and the
[1:47:38] firstfruits come on now you see it God's
[1:47:41] just the firstfruits
[1:47:42] now firstfruits all those things that
[1:47:44] ties in tithing and those things like
[1:47:46] that listen God just don't ask you and
[1:47:48] me to pay ties he's a tithe payer he
[1:47:52] takes her tithes of all the earth come
[1:47:55] on now he takes the tithes of our life
[1:47:58] what's the tide of our life our soul the
[1:48:02] firstfruits call there is a time there
[1:48:05] is that which is brought into the house
[1:48:07] of the Lord lives that our surrender
[1:48:10] remember what does the tide do it comes
[1:48:12] to sustain the work of the ministry and
[1:48:14] the tithing of the Lord where God would
[1:48:17] call our hearts and our lives to him so
[1:48:19] that his life might be preeminent in our
[1:48:22] lives and fully minister as coworkers
[1:48:25] and redemption Oh glory be to God
[1:48:32] firstfruits he Christ became the
[1:48:35] firstfruits of them that slept remember
[1:48:38] Enoch was raptured Elijah was raptured
[1:48:43] neither one of them tasted death they
[1:48:46] went in rapture but here came Jesus the
[1:48:49] Keystone the Keystone he died rose again
[1:48:55] and win in rapture
[1:48:59] the man it was the Keystone that passed
[1:49:02] together the old and the New Testament
[1:49:04] and the Keystone is that part in the
[1:49:08] triumphal arch that joins both side of
[1:49:11] the arch together and it was showing and
[1:49:15] declaring that the blood that had been
[1:49:18] shed in pipe and then this over here
[1:49:20] here is the Keystone here is the very
[1:49:23] one that joins it all together they that
[1:49:28] were dead he raised they had died in in
[1:49:33] Waiting died in the faith looking afar
[1:49:36] off
[1:49:45] mmm
[1:49:48] I got a read description I keep coming
[1:49:51] around this thing and he Hosea 13 14
[1:49:57] this not only pertains to Israel this
[1:50:00] pertains this was an announcement by the
[1:50:03] Lord Jesus himself and Hosea 13 14 I
[1:50:07] will ransom them from the power of the
[1:50:09] grave I will redeem them from death Oh
[1:50:14] death I will be pipe legs
[1:50:17] Oh grave I will be vile destruction meta
[1:50:24] doctrine the person that's why he could
[1:50:29] say there then revelations one wouldn't
[1:50:32] even make himself known to John John
[1:50:34] said I fell at his feet had dead and
[1:50:36] what did he do he came to minister to
[1:50:38] John he said I am he that was dead and
[1:50:41] I'm alive forevermore I have the keys
[1:50:50] nobody could say they were dead than
[1:50:52] alive people could say I'm alive and now
[1:50:55] passed on but normally this one said
[1:50:58] this is the key stone he was he wasn't
[1:51:03] purchasing a burying-place paradise done
[1:51:08] away with he was making a place for you
[1:51:11] and I that we could come in into that
[1:51:14] for a resurrection if we go by the way
[1:51:17] of the grave he made the way for him
[1:51:19] that place is where the rapture will
[1:51:22] take place hallelujah this is why the
[1:51:26] scripture would say notice how distinct
[1:51:28] it is and and please bear with me just a
[1:51:30] few moments here in revelations 14 13 I
[1:51:33] heard a voice from heaven saying write
[1:51:35] blessed are the Dead which die in the
[1:51:37] Lord from henceforth yeh says the Lord
[1:51:40] they that they may rest from their
[1:51:41] labors and their works do follow him in
[1:51:44] Revelation 20 verse 5 and the rest of
[1:51:46] the Dead lived not again until the
[1:51:48] thousand years were finished this is the
[1:51:51] first resurrection blessed and holy is
[1:51:54] he that hath part in the first
[1:51:56] resurrection on such the second death
[1:51:59] hath no
[1:52:00] power but they shall be priests of God
[1:52:02] and of Christ and shall reign with him a
[1:52:04] thousand years what a promise that's
[1:52:08] given through and by our Lord Jesus he
[1:52:13] purchased the burying place for you and
[1:52:16] I that you and I could be buried in him
[1:52:20] [Applause]
[1:52:21] that is why that we are buried in the
[1:52:24] baptism we are buried in the name of the
[1:52:27] Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:52:30] our sins we are showing that we are
[1:52:33] identifying in his death and when you
[1:52:36] come up we are declaring but I'm no
[1:52:38] longer the same man that went down I'm
[1:52:40] identifying in a newness of life and
[1:52:42] then he comes and does what no man can
[1:52:45] do and that is baptize you into the body
[1:52:49] that's what the Holy Ghost does if that
[1:52:52] passes you into the place of
[1:52:55] Resurrection and rapture this is why
[1:53:03] Paul would would would would would
[1:53:05] express even that in his own life he
[1:53:09] said I want to be found in him in
[1:53:11] Philippians 3:9 not having my own
[1:53:12] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:53:16] that which is through the faith of
[1:53:17] Christ the righteousness which is of God
[1:53:20] by faith that I may know him you see
[1:53:28] these words if you just take them if
[1:53:30] there's something that you seemed like
[1:53:31] in your mind and you say I don't
[1:53:33] understand that
[1:53:34] just take the words that even being said
[1:53:36] right here and just pray Lord I want to
[1:53:39] know you I want to know you I want to
[1:53:46] know you that's all it takes
[1:53:53] then I may know him and the power is
[1:53:56] resurrection the Fellowship of his
[1:53:58] sufferings being made conformable unto
[1:54:00] his death if by any means I might attain
[1:54:02] unto which the word unto their means out
[1:54:05] of the resurrection of the Dead see
[1:54:07] there is the promise of the first
[1:54:10] resurrection there is the promise
[1:54:12] because the Bible go on to declare in
[1:54:15] many places Daniel 12 John 5 on and on
[1:54:18] even in the book of Revelation in
[1:54:19] different places where there will be a
[1:54:21] resurrection of all together but you
[1:54:26] want to be identified in that first
[1:54:29] resurrection he provided a place for you
[1:54:32] and I that we could come to oh my this
[1:54:37] is what Paul would go on in that chapter
[1:54:39] you know he would talk about his life he
[1:54:40] wasn't living you know living as though
[1:54:42] I got it made already
[1:54:44] Paul seen many things God had already
[1:54:47] quicken his life but with that what it
[1:54:49] did for Paul said I want to know him
[1:54:51] more I want to apprehend that with just
[1:54:56] later hold on my life Paul would say not
[1:54:59] as though have we're perfect not as
[1:55:01] though I had already attained this one
[1:55:05] thing I do as Paul would write I want to
[1:55:10] be after he I want to apprehend that
[1:55:11] which I'm apprehended of this is why the
[1:55:15] scriptures I know from the your
[1:55:16] scripture to us this is why the Bible
[1:55:18] has it would write in first
[1:55:20] first Thessalonians 4:13 I would not
[1:55:22] have you ignorant brethren concerning
[1:55:23] them which are asleep that you sorrow
[1:55:27] not even as others which have no hope
[1:55:30] we're sorrowing will miss them here in
[1:55:33] this lifetime but we've got a promise
[1:55:39] mother duck brother bill mama
[1:55:42] brother herb I forget anybody else you
[1:55:44] forgive me
[1:55:46] for brother Claudio and sister Dolores
[1:55:51] we've got that promise we are in
[1:55:56] expectation not that you're going to
[1:56:02] have to do this but if I were you one
[1:56:05] thing would be would be one thing you

[1:57:04] of sickness it's not a picture of sorrow

[1:57:09] this way everything is in perfection the
[1:57:16] same God but you have served the Lord
[1:57:18] you've been grace of the heirs of life

[1:57:29] sister Betsy you will walk together for
[1:57:32] they better dead in Christ shall rise

[1:57:52] mama you got a plumber with dad finally
[1:58:00] have to preach I've run we've got an
[1:58:02] appointment here there's an expectation
[1:58:08] they're sleeping
[1:58:10] as far as has it's turned in the
[1:58:12] scripture but they're more alive than we
[1:58:14] are they're not eating it's sleeping
[1:58:20] over there right in hell
[1:58:21] they're waiting to come back and take
[1:58:23] home glorified bodies glorified bodies
[1:58:28] because it is not a body that was made
[1:58:30] by man
[1:58:32] it was made by the glory of God hey man
[1:58:37] when we even as we step even right now
[1:58:40] in our soul its clarifying Jesus when we
[1:58:43] step from here into that other into that
[1:58:46] other body it's the way that's been made
[1:58:48] it's glorifying Jesus when we when we
[1:58:51] when we return to take a bit glorified
[1:58:53] body
[1:58:54] it's glorifying Jesus what is it it is
[1:58:56] called that he is manifesting the glory
[1:58:59] of Jesus Christ now unto him that is
[1:59:03] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:59:05] all we ask or say unto Him be glory in
[1:59:09] the church forever without end amen the
[1:59:19] Lord himself shall descend with a shout
[1:59:21] these were scriptures in previous these
[1:59:25] were scriptures that they've been
[1:59:27] waiting on but now is the hour where the
[1:59:31] Lord Himself has made his descent we're
[1:59:36] still waiting on the corporal body but
[1:59:40] the Lord Himself the fullness of the
[1:59:42] Spirit the word here he is descending in
[1:59:45] a shout a message that has gone out just
[1:59:49] like that message got a hold of Abraham
[1:59:51] that message got a hold of Isaac that
[1:59:53] message got a hold of Jacob you might
[1:59:55] look and say that was their daddy
[1:59:57] telling him that their daddy might have
[1:59:59] told him that because what had been
[2:00:00] revealed now belong to them and their
[2:00:02] children but they required God to make
[2:00:05] it a personal revelation in their heart
[2:00:07] but it wasn't their daddy's revelation
[2:00:09] it became their personal revelation and
[2:00:16] with the voice of the Archangel all he
[2:00:19] does offer me what has coming down the
[2:00:22] voice of the Archangel calling them from
[2:00:26] the graves but saying is everybody gonna
[2:00:31] raise at this time only the elect those
[2:00:34] who died in the faith those who hold in
[2:00:36] that revelation thank God for others
[2:00:40] that are saved and under don't
[2:00:41] understand me I just don't want to go
[2:00:42] that down going in that route but think
[2:00:44] about this here
[2:00:45] is the grace of Almighty God that would
[2:00:49] come into that moment and here they
[2:00:52] would hear the voice of God you ever
[2:00:56] think of that the voice of the Archangel
[2:00:58] hit ain't Jesus going Jesus never went
[2:01:01] down there and said all right everybody
[2:01:02] raise up it was the fulfillment of the
[2:01:07] word in his life it unlocked it unlocked
[2:01:13] they without us cannot be made perfect
[2:01:16] it's a fulfillment of that word listen
[2:01:18] it was a prophecy a word that's being
[2:01:20] fulfilled and sounded out through our
[2:01:22] lives has an effect very simple I know
[2:01:26] but that has an effect in your home that
[2:01:30] word sounding out it has effect it
[2:01:32] brings leadership in the home it brings
[2:01:34] stability in the home it brings love
[2:01:36] courage and ability in the hall then we
[2:01:41] which are alive and remain notice then
[2:01:42] the Trump of God shall sound gather
[2:01:46] together for the wedding supper we meet
[2:01:50] him in the air
[2:01:53] Alleluia now we meet him in the air here
[2:01:56] we are
[2:01:57] and fellowshipping with one another
[2:01:59] praise God brother you made it
[2:02:01] praise God sister you made it praise God
[2:02:03] you know to think of how this was going
[2:02:05] on and then after that time remember
[2:02:08] brother Brent said he gives us that time
[2:02:09] of about 40 days he said because we
[2:02:12] knows that if he would come before that
[2:02:14] time you I would be too busy looking at
[2:02:16] who made it and who didn't he said he
[2:02:18] wants all asked to be on him so he
[2:02:20] allows us that time to gather around and
[2:02:23] that's exactly I'm telling you you talk
[2:02:25] about these little times like this like
[2:02:28] the Bible says in the book of
[2:02:29] Thessalonians our gathering unto Him
[2:02:31] these are only foretaste of the glory of
[2:02:34] Almighty God what it does for us now to
[2:02:36] look around and see somebody and say
[2:02:39] praise God
[2:02:40] good to see in church this morning
[2:02:41] soldier good to see in church this
[2:02:43] morning
[2:02:43] think about it home that wraps your
[2:02:46] morning when we are standing there we'll
[2:02:48] be looking at one another and say praise
[2:02:50] God we
[2:02:52] made it by the grace of Almighty God hey
[2:02:55] man for my looking at were looking for
[2:02:59] one another so thankful for one another
[2:03:02] rather we made it by the grace of
[2:03:05] Almighty God and then the trumpet sounds
[2:03:14] and we behold him he wants full
[2:03:21] attention he's got everything prepared
[2:03:29] he's got the for a rotten meeting place
[2:03:31] he's already provided the garment
[2:03:33] already provided the ring he's already
[2:03:35] provided everything that we have need of
[2:03:38] a man he opened up that place so we can
[2:03:42] meet him in the expanse between the
[2:03:44] heavens and the earth he opened up that
[2:03:46] place that we could come right back home
[2:03:48] oh my to think of it now let me just
[2:03:51] bring it down I said a few more minutes
[2:03:53] I'll let you know when I get started on
[2:03:54] those moments but to recognize no no no
[2:03:57] comments about that brother Doug will
[2:03:59] when we understand this right here that
[2:04:01] that within Palestine it was speaking
[2:04:03] day had a revelation there was going to
[2:04:06] be that literally and there was a
[2:04:08] resurrection that was there but that was
[2:04:10] speaking of the type as we've been
[2:04:12] speaking of this those that are dead in
[2:04:14] Christ those that sleep in Christ those
[2:04:16] are sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[2:04:18] him all of these promises were speaking
[2:04:21] of a provided place for you and I inside
[2:04:24] of Jesus Christ and in there it really
[2:04:27] there might be one down in Africa there
[2:04:29] might be one out in the bush in Ghana
[2:04:31] there might be one that's way down on
[2:04:33] the south tip of South Africa there'd be
[2:04:35] one there in Costa Rica you know you're
[2:04:38] not talking about has they all spread
[2:04:40] out but remember there is one place for
[2:04:43] us to be gathered there is one place of
[2:04:45] Resurrection and one place of rapture
[2:04:48] and that is in Jesus Christ hey man hey
[2:04:55] man in that one place and I want you to
[2:04:57] hear these words the Prophet would say
[2:04:59] it just like this and questions answer
[2:05:01] 64
[2:05:02] he said I'm saying this to you in the
[2:05:05] name
[2:05:05] of a profit in the name of a profit the
[2:05:08] resurrection and rapture will be general
[2:05:11] all over the entire world no matter
[2:05:13] where you're at when that hour comes
[2:05:16] you'll be caught up to meet him there's
[2:05:19] nothing going to stop you no matter
[2:05:22] where you are
[2:05:24] oh what promises we have and you
[2:05:39] recognize wow I don't know what happened
[2:05:41] here wire it up and not for blast-off
[2:05:49] but we have this promise in our bosom
[2:05:56] Paul would say the earnest in other
[2:05:59] place he would say we have the
[2:06:01] firstfruits of the Spirit we're waiting
[2:06:03] for the redemption of the body because
[2:06:07] remember the atonement was a dual
[2:06:11] atonement it was the atonement to pay
[2:06:15] the sin debt for our soul and it was
[2:06:19] also to pay for the redemption of the
[2:06:21] body I love that the sinner of the King
[2:06:27] James Bible is Psalms 103 bless the Lord
[2:06:31] O my soul and all that is within me
[2:06:33] bless His Holy Name who forgiveth all
[2:06:38] thine iniquities first part of the
[2:06:41] atonement come on now and who healeth
[2:06:44] all than diseases
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:47] amen hey man it begins with the healing
[2:06:51] of the soul this body can still get sick
[2:06:55] but the earnest has already come on the
[2:06:57] inside you say what's that earnest well
[2:07:02] that earnest sometimes alone will cause
[2:07:04] a song to be sung
[2:07:05] I got a mansion over the hilltop
[2:07:11] call some to break out in a Hal and
[2:07:14] Louie house sister Mary would do it you
[2:07:15] know oh thank you G how she would do it
[2:07:18] oh thank you Jesus
[2:07:20] come on the hell it's the same effect
[2:07:22] you should have in our hearts as well
[2:07:24] there's an Ernest that has taken place
[2:07:26] in our life amen there's already been a
[2:07:30] rapture in going on and catching away
[2:07:33] catching us away from the things of the
[2:07:35] world taking the love of the world out
[2:07:37] of our life well in we couldn't do that
[2:07:42] but God coming down equipment in power
[2:07:44] it moves in our life you who were dead
[2:07:47] in sin and trespasses hath he quickened
[2:07:50] we've been raised up into heavenly
[2:07:53] places at one time we were subject to
[2:07:56] the things of the world but the world
[2:07:58] has lost its hold
[2:08:01] we've been loosed and buried in Jesus
[2:08:08] Christ hallelujah
[2:08:11] no don't just bury me anywhere that
[2:08:13] revelation says bury me in Jesus that's
[2:08:17] my place of resurrection that is the
[2:08:21] Ernest you're going in the rapture
[2:08:25] you've already raised the love of the
[2:08:31] world gone let me just say this to you
[2:08:35] this morning as we've said it all
[2:08:36] throughout if you're not into that place
[2:08:39] where you have that assurance you can
[2:08:42] have that this morning
[2:08:46] it's available to you all you have to do
[2:08:50] is invite him in if you've never
[2:08:52] repented repent he'll just say I need to
[2:08:55] see how can find this out it's first of
[2:08:57] all you can't find that out ask him to
[2:09:00] come reveal himself and as he reveals
[2:09:04] himself to you he'll listen the goodness
[2:09:06] of God leadeth you to repentance not the
[2:09:12] wrath of man the goodness of God and He
[2:09:17] will lead you every step of the way
[2:09:20] Oh send me oh if I get how do I get to
[2:09:23] know what this person knows and all
[2:09:25] these things are free no no you got the
[2:09:26] wrong focus these things that were being
[2:09:28] treats are not known by knowledge it's
[2:09:31] not because we understand everything
[2:09:33] it's by revelation something that burns
[2:09:37] in our hearts and I'm saying to you that
[2:09:41] saying God desires to make himself real
[2:09:43] to you that you would be found in this
[2:09:46] place of resurrection this place of
[2:09:49] rapture under the token under the blood
[2:09:53] where it's all settled then your head is
[2:09:56] lifted up above your enemies and you see
[2:10:01] that your future is clear what grace
[2:10:08] maybe this morning you just need
[2:10:11] strength in your body maybe you're a
[2:10:14] little weary
[2:10:17] and what it means to feel weary you know
[2:10:20] what it means to be weary maybe you're
[2:10:22] just a little weary but God's here to
[2:10:26] strengthen you and what God has revealed
