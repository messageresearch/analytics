there is Lord God there's nothing that we've done to make ourselves worthy the Lord how grateful we are for your love that was expressed to us your God made First Lord God Lord to us and now innocent Nord we give you praise and things Lord behalf of Lord God the needs more here we are journey Lord in this time Lord you know Lord brought every me on every heart you know just how to how to speak to that need more it may not be so much more the words that would be spoken today but father we believe that the Spirit of God has come to speak expressly to where the nor that you can direct our hearts by your word into you Lord who is the answer of all things to give us that direction Lord that we need or any stabilizing Lord God nor you're the one to do that more so father we just asked Lord just now that you would you had come Lord and make yourself real to every heart that's gathered here Lord may they know you Lord God that Lord Jesus in your love in your care or God how mindful you are Lord Jesus Lord for each and every need Lord we just ask the Lord as we give ourselves to you we want to do that unreservedly this morning we we don't want to hold anything back and not just for this moment but lord this is our request that father if there be anything in us Lord that's unlikely Lord take it out Lord and Lord as you take it out fill it up with yourself Lord God Oh Lord Jesus we love you Lord we want more of you Lord we want more of your life to be reflected Lord through us Lord we pray may you come Lord and do what only you can do long oh God we give ourselves to you we give you praise and things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ let's turn to John chapter 3 certainly appreciate that I don't know who put them up to that but that's one well preach on today my birthday that's what I'm gonna preach on my birthday today and preach on your birthday too this is the greatest birthday amen John chapter 3 verse 9 there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him now I want you to notice these things that he's pulling together thou art a teacher come from God he ties it together with no man can do these miracles that you're doing except God be with him hmm now watch how Jesus turns right through here and he lets him know this is the greatest miracle of all jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God we know that C is to is to understand him Nicodemus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God notice right there in verse 4 Nicodemus serious the Lord Jesus is speaking but Nicodemus is confined to earthly thinking how can a man enter back in to his mother's womb a second time even if a man could do that it would only produce the same birth that's already condemned that's all it would do it'd be the same thing all over again Jesus is not talking about the same thing all over again he's talking about a different birth except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so must be born of the water of the spirits I'm talking about the pool of water he's talking about the word God sends his word and the word that he sends the Spirit of God travels through that word to get a hold of the lives of the elect of God and to bring birth to their life notice how Paul said it so precisely he speaks of how that after you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation see every age has had the gospel preached to them and it has been peculiar to that generation always always identifying the true atonement you with me but it is the word that's coming and the Spirit coming through there to bring life verse 7 Marvel not that I said unto thee ye must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth now look at this mystery I probably won't deal so much with this scripture today but verse 8 the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit being born of the Spirit of God it is not something that you can explain it's a paradox it's the greatest miracle the greatest miracle it's something that not a church could do not a man could do it only Christ Himself can bring this birth about and it is a paradox one thing that is the same among every child of God is that there is an experience that is true to the word and they just let me just capitalize this on just a moment your experience as far as what you recall and how things transpired when God did the final work in your life might be different than how it was for me but there is one thing that is the same it's the same father doing the same experience so it'll produce the same life and the same fruit and the same works that's what is important wish I had time just to labor I don't have time to labor on that today maybe we can just have an evening service today y'all mind that at all okay we'll do it then after all this is my birthday right [Laughter] Nicodemus answered and said unto him how can these things be jesus answered and said unto Him art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things aren't you glad it doesn't take great learning to understand this it only takes a willing heart it's all it takes amen may God bless you and bless the word as you're being seated this portion of scripture that we just read no doubt to many of us are very familiar passage of Scripture and yet here is the it's a promise of the coming of the holy spirit that the Old Testament Saints and all of those who were looking down through time that were moved upon by the Spirit of God as the elect of God to worship God in the gate where he chose to place his name they were looking forward to two things in their day and those two things they were looking forward to was the coming of the Messiah but then in the coming of the Messiah of how that then the Spirit of God would visit not just to visit but would come and be poured out so they were looking they were looking forward to this and they had glimpses of it there there was glimpses of it that that would cause them to look with anticipation for what is coming it's just like what has repeated down through the Gentile Ages where you had those that have gone on before us they knew there was a day coming they were looking forward to that day they they worked with the strength and the enlightenment of the gospel of what God had done and was doing in their life and they fulfilled their part of the race yet we find that in this part of the scripture here that this is the very first time that within the scripture that we're the new birth is not just set forth in a type but it's it's it's mentioned the very not just mentioning but here this very essential doctrine which is the very basis it's the most important doctrine this is this is more than just a doctrine this is the life because without this the everything else doesn't matter but when we look at it the life itself there had been a types that was laid down in the scripture of the new birth and we we see that we dealt with that quite a bit here on you see the new birth beginning in Genesis 1 God even lays out that plan of redemption so it's all been laid out in tight all the way through the scriptures many different places but now the Lord Jesus makes this this declaration in this time that it's necessary that one must be born again and we know that that that that new birth is not just it's not just the same old life repackaged you know what I mean it's like things you know your your your parents you know kind of play a trick on you and you know you they give you they get this present out there for Christmas or for your birthday and you're looking at that and the man I can't wear that it's gotta be a good one and you open it up and it's an old pair of socks so you're all excited about something and all it was the old pair of socks it's something you already had that's not what the new birth is it's not something that you already have it's what it's needed and only he can give it so it is not a repackaging but it's a remaking it is a new creation in the same old temple got any worried about giving you beautiful wrapping you get the wrapping paper that matches the gift on the outside in the meantime he wants the gift on the inside that'll eventually lead this wrapping to the wrapping that he intended for it to have that's the paradox in itself is that here God has such a glorious gift inside of such wrapping paper that we might look at and say oh how could there ever come such and such out of Nazareth how could there ever come such and such hey listen friends you can apply that and put the name of your family tree and that's the very thing with every one of us how could there come any good out of that well as far as in the natural genetics there is nothing that would be good equal to that of God's own life but hidden beneath fault of that various gods choosing an election that he knows where each and every one of his children are now in the message questions and answers here in 1964 this is one of the only places I'm just gonna take my time a little bit and I hope that don't make you nervous but I want to make sure these things we drive them down when we're looking at this this quote I'm just going to touch it this to this morning but when we look at this here this is one of the the only places where brother vana will take the term kokuboro and who eat and describe it in this manner he says how can I take a cup o Burrell and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for me to do it I no doubt I'm speaking maybe it's um to farmers and some expert gardeners and whatever more you don't plant a tomato seed and expect to get green beans now that's everybody can understand that the only way it can be is because inside that cockerel inside that Kaka bra inside that Tucker Burrell has been transmitted from a kookaburra to a germ called wheat life that's the only way so the change doesn't change the kokuboro it simply takes out cocklebur a life and injects wheat life you with me see when brother ran it without me going into many of these quotes let me just let me just refer to a few things that you see of wheat and a cockerel because all of us there is nothing when you look across the spectrum of humanity we all come of the same as far as one blood one nation so forth and so on we can go in and trace all these things on back but the reality of it is is that what is down there beneath the shell of a capybara is what makes a difference remember the days of the Lord Jesus he was looking at some good-looking cockle burrows then guys kept the law perfectly but what he say you're of your father the devil so he's looking at a different what a life on the inside he's not ready what did he tell them he let him know you you do not have righteous judgment you're judging what's on the outside wife cuz that's the only thing they knew Jesus is trying to take them to a deeper life a deeper meaning then it's not you don't know somebody by the outside you know about who they are on the inside and who you are on the inside will come out to the outside that's what Jesus looking at him and said you are whited Sepulcher who it was dirty to touch a dead man come on somebody they couldn't even come in the camp but he's letting them know you are filthy yet you couldn't put a finger on the kokuboro oh but the inside was not that of Widger why because it could not recognize the visitation of God in that day oh my so it has to be transmitted from a cocklebur to a germ called wheat life that is just so precious in it it has to be as a brother Ram picks it up in 1965 trying to do God a service he picks up this cooker bro and weed again and he says I notice he says as the same thing we've said throughout the kokuboro and we both can rejoice in the same rain he said but it's what's down there on beneath is the soul kokuboro so see now we're looking at the nature because as far as on the outside we're all kokuboro hmm it's the live now notice this this word let me just deal with this word transmitted a little bit this word transmitted means caused something to pass from one place or person to another so to cause something to pass from one place or person to another so it's got to be transmitted from kokuboro to a germ called wheat life now you know a mode of transmission is like even in diseases and things like that you got to come in contact where it's at right you got to be there where where the diseases are at and so forth and then you know even how you know sometimes they're asking you before you go here and there get your shots and this and that and do all these things trying to do what build immunity man I can't even go there but God within within everything there is this this transmission because even like coming through this room right here Here I am I'm wearing a belt pack there's no wires that's attached to this sound system right here but yet what is taking place in this microphone there is a signal being sent from this belt pack to that receiver process through wires and it's coming out through all the signals and the things that's going over the internet and so forth you don't you don't see the signal you know when I step over here some of you don't all of a sudden on this side of the church go well part away we've got to let that signal come through the signal is passing through you signals are passing through this room is that right that's why the proper could say the very words of Jesus Christ and it's true they're still here circling around the around the earth and and he said if we had a device we could pick that up but you know it's not necessary that we pick up so much the natural words but it's necessary that we pick up the words of the fulfillment for our day and our generation and for that we're going to need something that is tuned in to the network amen we're going to need something that has a card inside of it that can be activated are you with me you can carry around the phone but if any inactivated no calls no service under set you can come into a building and get Wi-Fi whoo Oh glory to God you can get Wi-Fi but when you go out among the world you have no signal but if that phone has a card within it that has been activated Benny consent calls receive calls he can send messages receive messages it is right there you are in contact wherever you go it might be on a roaming fee there might be things you come in contact with that you've got to go around and navigator out but yet there is something that you know this has been navigated my signal bars might get real low but one thing I know my phone has been activated I might be in a place right now I need to move I might need to get away from some things right now if there do what in order for my signals to come back where they need to be you understand what I'm talking that's talking about a Christian life so the new birth is not we're all of a sudden you're always got five by five Power Bars glory to God I tell you boys got no no that's not that's not what a new birth is the new birth is where you recognize who you are and sin has become dead to you and so here you are you're looking and if you sense anything in your life if it's to move away from certain things you move away from it why why do you move away from it because the signal is what you value you value being led by the Spirit of God y'all know what I'm talking about sometimes people would call me I'll be right right down the basement um hey hold on hold on if I drop you I'll call you back when I get up why all that aluminum from that ductwork down there it makes it hard to even have the call so there is must be a mode of transmission now brother Ram goes on to say then you bury that caca burrow and it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat but in the cocklebur I don't know if you're catching this here is the clears the kokuboro inside it is put wheat germ life but when you bury the kokuboro the outside rots away and what is on the inside is what comes forth he's talking about you and you both use and the life notice and the life of the kokuboro has been taken out thank you lord but the nature of the coupler Burrell is still sticky sticky that's why it's easy to if it's sticky that means it's easy to stick to things and you have to get it unstuck how do you get it unstuck by the life within you will pause on that today and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again Porton will be until this new life what new life you see am I trying to make my a burl any better but if I'm feeding that man on the inside that man on the inside has strength to subdue and reflect the glory of God through a badger skin or a cockapoo he says win it when it comes forth it's no more Cocker burl butwe while it's here on earth in and out of the earth a cocker bro it's still sticky and it's got the nature on the inside of a week wow what a complex person you are and I am as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live there's a key at one time it never bothered you because the nature within was synonymous with the kokuboro but now there's been a change any bother shoot this coupler burl bothers you gonna beat a god that's going to bother you as long as you live so if you're not bothered something's wrong but the inside of you notice the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you that's the thing now let's let's look at this here just a little bit through the word I want to just begin speaking to you on from Puckle burl to wheat life and let's look at this in the word is God has laid this out of because we can never it's important in recognizing of we are where we've come from and the great plan of redemption it is absolutely necessary that we have our feet upon solid ground and I don't think we can we can ever ever get beyond that we should never that is never we're never to get beyond that the message of redemption because that's what it's all about notice how God comes along here in Genesis verse 3 and he speaks now to a condition that has arose upon the earth among his family his children and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life so here here an upright being is now cursed and now he must go up on his belly and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now god when we've looked at this many times in the word God is committing that of redemption is solely in the hands of Almighty God it's completely in his hands and he and he says I will give her a seat then we know the woman does not have a seat the woman is a bedding ground is that right so God is committing himself to supply and remember with seed seed has a germ of life with on the inside of it so God is committing that his life is going to come back into the human race but not just come back into it but with the purpose of for redemption so God let lets it be known here that it shall bruise this is what the seed will do this is one this is what it will do he's announcing it it shall bruise the head and thou shalt bruise his heel God lets it be known that the head notice what he's dealing with the head here's the effect of the life of the seed it goes to the root of the problem it deals with the head it doesn't you know it's like many times when you look at it if if if I was being attacked you know by a bear or something or you were you don't want to I don't want you to cut its arm off you're gonna make it matter I don't want you to cut its leg off you're going to make it more mad but if you will hit it in the head if you will take its head off then every other thing every other limb everything else will die because the head has been removed from the body so the head is that source of life so God is letting it be known that I'm not going to come and remove arms and remove limbs I'm gonna come and take off heads I'm gonna I'm coming in and this see that's coming that look to see that's coming is not gonna look like a mighty warrior but he is a mighty warrior hey man it's gonna be such a humility to wear that be the the the the people of that day were looking and the despised and rejected and how that here he will you know about his life going the bow will look just like and as far as in his looks and everything just like any ordinary man upon this earth but what is packed behind that vessel and behind that veil Oh glory you're talking about light and electricity that can light up on a city this light that is packed inside of that vessel is the very same light that said in the beginning let there be light is that same light in that vessel in that beginning that lights up every man that have come into the earth that true light what that light that's behind this vessel this was an ambush the devil didn't know it he was ambushed on Calvary he was ambushed how many times the Prophet said when he was walking up that hill and he said it how the blood spots was getting bigger he said the devil said this guy can't be the Son of God he said there is no way he would they would take that kind of stuff take that kind of punishment oh but I hear the words of the Prophet say but a son of God will put up a son of God will put up he will take the criticism how how can he take the criticism it wasn't because he was a Superman he took the criticism because his faith his focus was in the purpose that God had revealed to him who he was and why was here upon this earth I tell your friends have we let that purpose predominate and have preeminence in our life everything else around us it seems as nothing we're able to cast it down we're able to hold to do not allow it to get us down because why there's a greater purpose than my feelings there's a greater purpose I don't want this cocklebur getting in the way of that wheat life so I have to bring my a burl into subjection because my Oh bro can get his a bull feelings hurt and he gets his feelings hurt he'll hinder sweet life from expressing like it off - is that right Amen so here this is dealing with with the head the ruling part no one shouldn't watch this habit brother brown lays this out in the fees in churches I'm gonna read just a little bit here and I think this is just so precious he said we've come this far let me try to christian and crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as I have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden there by say men or two trees there no doubt in that the tree of life was Jesus remember when Jesus come he said I am the way the truth and the life the other tree is definitely Satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree amen now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship and once now I want you to just put on your spiritual thinking caps when we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there when we read the rest of this here now if we take this word and apply it to our lives personally to know that God has not allowed things to come around and things for us to be in in certain places a job and whatever more it's not something that God said oh no what in the world he's watching over our lives he knows what he's doing and let me just tell you right now there is a truth in the scripture where it says let every man be able to give my reason of hope that lies within him but you know what there's times when you're not to say nothing I've got a whole study I haven't been having brought it to you yet but there's things were from years ago I got to looking at it with the Lord Jesus you find there's times they said something to the Lord Jesus he just walked away you know what they would have said it this guy's rude no no he ain't gonna argue there's times the answer and there's times not to answer you only got so much time up on this earth you only got so much time use it wisely but we're not careful that kokuboro wants to get in the way and prove but the proof is in the pudding whoo now give you some good banana pudding right now with in vanilla whispers don't worry I ain't lost where where I'm having a good old time this is my birthday no better place to be brother Dominic than a house of God on my birthday all right notice he says now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship to manner they would never have been placed there they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of God in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute a misson son to God this is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of God was to share his eternal life with man now in Ephesians chapter in Ephesians chapter one I'm not going to have you turn there because of for sake of time but it features chapter 1 if you want to write it down and read it later it's verse 4 through 11 and appall moved by the Spirit of God notice here the first as he's laying this down you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world he goes into the choosing there and he brings it down to how then can we come back into or come back to what he has chosen will you never get away from his choosing but he makes a way that what he has chosen through the written chin of his blood that what he has chosen then can come back into expression he didn't choose you and I've said this and I'm gonna repeat it again the election of God is not like you and I playing kickball and recess we're all of a sudden you know we get everybody lined up against the wall and we're out here picking teams what we do carnality you understand you see that's the carnality of church church wants to pick people God ain't picking now he already chose but what he chose is back from his own loins identified these guys are my boys they're good-looking they look like their daddy but they came they and they come from from the genes it's right here you see and there's a love that I had for I didn't go out and pick somebody up and make up my Sunday or mine because they came of me that is the choosing of God you and I were down in this kind of a condition and now thinking about it how did we get in this kind of a condition you seen we're talking about Redemption now why do we need to be redeemed ooh you see it's good ask questions about is like when when people want to talk about the virgin birth well is the virgin birth why is it got to be the virgin birth why is it that's the point why because whatever God is doing its undoing something else so and answer that question it will go back to cerfancy now I've used that many times now notice this revelation is certain I'm gonna read this one revelation 13:8 all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him Satan whose names are not written I remember Isaiah 14 Satan's desire ambition I will ascend above the stars of God there write that phrase stars of God is messiahs brothers I will ascend above them but God keeps going and says but thou shalt be brought down so here oh but upon the face of the earth shall worship Him Satan no we're not talking about them that guy's name Alexander Crowley or whatever his name is we're not talking about that we're talking about a religious realm whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world oh my mind here the prophet said goes into this statement but that life talking about that life that comes out of the lamb could not and would not be shared in any other way then through the way of God manifest in the flesh now what's he talking about shared is he talking about shared as far as any mission and a returning yet emitting prophecy would come it comes back or is he talking about when that life moves and lays a claim upon a vessel how many believe that the Spirit of God the scripture tells us in the book of Peter the prophets are overed were moved up on by the Holy Ghost you believe that they were moved upon by the by the Spirit of God alright and what to do what did the Spirit of God speak through them it identified his coming it identified parts of who he is but identifying in parts did not produce Redemption all of that has to come together this was part of his eternal and predestinated purpose this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of His grace it was the plan of redemption it was the plan of salvation now listen closely he said God being a savior it was necessary that he predestinated a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being that's a powerful statement God couldn't make that man fall he couldn't do it and be just that is 100% correct multitudes of scripture very doubtless does a very pointed verse of Rael Romans 11:36 for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen watch this now man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first all right the cherubim was placed there at an at the gate these two at the gate right and he was placed there with the flaming sword - do I keep the way to the Tree of Life so I listened to close it off but it was to keep the way and the only way that that way could be unfolded to you and I is for the tree of life himself to become flesh he who was there had to come where we are but before God could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and say man had to fall the fall which would be caused by Satan had to have flesh to make fall Satan can't do nothing unless he's got flesh I don't know about you but I want my cocklebur reserved for the Lord to express himself through is that right Lord Jesus help me Lord that's why Paul could say let all bitterness malice let all those things be put away from you there right Paul would go on to say mortify therefore the members of your body right what why is he speaking that because I'm wheat life still inside of kokuboro but greater is sweet life in you than cocklebur out here so I had to come in flash Satan you know oh my we're gonna come back here's the world tonight Satan had to come through flesh also now watch this but Satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would Christ come in human flesh to restore the fallen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that Satan could not get to that that Satan could get to that beast and through that beast remember it didn't say he was a reptile the Bible called him in verse one beast of the field most subtle of all the beasts of the field they're right but notice here there had to be a way that he could get into the human flesh and caused the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race so Satan's desire was to inject himself into the human race that's his desire this is why as we said moments ago that the Lord Jesus could look upon the Pharisees and they could prove Abraham is my father they could go back and back and back and back and back and back and back and back and back but yet jesus said you're of your father the devil why he ain't looking at a natural seed this is a spiritual seed and what did he say your daddy your father was a murderer from the beginning what was he a murderer of the revealed Word in flesh that's always been that Satan manifesting himself a murderer of the revealed Word in flesh and listen friends that's where the prophets said in the in the church age book he said when they cannot withstand the work that God is doing through that man he said because they cannot deny it they cannot withstand it they go to start attacking the vessel in whom God is using that's a characteristic of Satan that's why you can see the anointing listen friends these are not these are not just minds of men just coming up with questions and innuendos or whatever more this is demonic anointing it's spiritual alleging but as they are anointed shell is the bride of Jesus Christ anointed they men when that anointed to listen to chatter were anointed to fly blu-ray and they're gonna try to straighten out the chipmunk chatter that's not my purpose my purpose is flying into the heavenlies hey man there's more Eagles there's Eagles that will fly into the heavenlies then the San friends we're not talking about converting people by proving things all right very one of you and I that can prove it it has to be God that can prove it if it can't be proven it's a man but when it can't be proven it's a surety of God amen [Music] the scripture said prove all things and hold fast to that which is good he is not speaking of our intellect proving all things is looking with spiritual discernment identifying the characteristic and the spirit all the way through that's why it must be the word coming that uncovers Satan oh my inject himself thereby into the human race even as Jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race Kyle repeater God my lord this is better than an apple crisp into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies locking to his own glorious one notice notice notice the instant the extent of this injection is not just to produce a new you a change on the inside but it leads you to a completion of what it's all about and that is back into the image that he in the beginning said smile and took the picture and put you in his family album that image is developing in you not like the instantaneous of your little iPhone camera no it's more like a Polaroid it is there it's being developed you're looking at that great thing it's been shot out look look look look at this look at this that's how you are in your life when you're seeing more of wheat life express through cocklebur oh-ho my glory to God I'm seeing more of that image of my look at that there and you're looking at things you're seeing it what is it this life is a darkroom our lives are developed for his glory hey Manny where do we we have the negative what's the negative you can't get a negative unless there's a positive somewhere in order to be a negative there has to be a positive where a picture was taken off and the picture that was taken the negative is placed right down in our lives and then as we come under the light of the hour what does it begin to do develop what that negative bringing forth that image that was there the whole time what image the image that was in his family album don't worry yeah in this family album you got all your hair you got your real teeth - absolutely but better than that we've got a we've got a real true disposition that's exactly right thank you Lord because when you get to the other side you can say praise God brother so-and-so is gonna be changed but now they're gonna be changed but that part about you that they bother is going to be changed also my goodness there will be husbands and wives walking down the streets of code together had to say that I love my wife to pieces that's the truth I don't know what I'd do without her notice this when Satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of God been man could not get to the tree of life in the garden certainly not it wasn't time but an animal animal that calls the fall had it not let animal life be shed was taken in his blood shed then God had communion with man again then there was to come a day when God would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore fallen man and make him a partaker of that life eternal oh my once you see this you can understand the Serpent's heed and knowing that it was no apple Eve ate it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling deceit the prophets were all a part of him Hebrews chapter 1 the Bible tells us that God in sundry times spake unto the father's through the prophets but in these last days notice Paul is bringing a distinction but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of all things but whom also he made the world's wandering in the separation that this was not just another prophet this is the god prophet this is he who us before all things who being the brightness of his glory the Express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now think of this the prophets as we said moments ago were moved upon by the Spirit of God they were able to receive transmission from God built-in receivers they could receive a transmission and would speak in utterance as the spirit would give him but then the Spirit of God would move back off of him then the Spirit of God would move on then the Spirit of God would move back upon him but here in this time when he became flesh there's a difference it's no longer just is not just a spirit the Spirit of God moving upon prophesying handing in and leaving but the Spirit of God is gonna come and remain here with me we're talking about Redemption Redemption this expressed image this expressed image as as it lays it right here it's the term you and I know character character a character of life your life is molded by the character inside of you and the expressed image is that which is an exact expression of any person anything immortan likeness of precise reproduction in every respect its effect simile a fax Jesus was God faxed to earth God faxed his image to earth here be behind that vessel behind that veil here was the very image of God I want you I want you to catch this now God did not send down another law or admits to a law he didn't need to do that what he needed to do was he come himself who is the Lord who is the lawgiver he didn't either come down and say oh man this is a rose let's make amendments to this oh this is a rose let's make amendments to this no no we're not talking about a continuation we're talking about one who is coming to do the work that he alone can do and needs to be done if he is saying you must be born again then he has to provide the way is that right now let's examine this because when we look at it when he came there's a different anointing it's the same holy spirit but now that the Spirit of God moving here it's coming as Redeemer anointed you see he's coming in Redemption he's coming to redeem it's a redeemer anointing notice how that the scripture says in the book of in the book of Galatians here in the book of Galatians here how that it speaks that we were an error in verse one yet we were children but we differ nothing from a servant though we'd be Lord of all having power and authority within you but yet that power and authority has not been expressed it's like a seed having within at all these bushels of tomatoes that you can make salsa out of you can make tomato and dumplings you can make spaghetti sauce but yet the seed itself has not been able to release what it is yet it's all in there that was you and I but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world we were always children but we were in bondage under what the elements of the world the first birth had us imprisoned it had rule and authority over us but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons this tree of life had to become flesh had to be made of a woman but it could not be it could not be God simply supplying life to a human egg but it had to be God creating both egg and sperm why because otherwise it's still polluted Satan still has a hold on it it is a blood that's tied in with the rest of it but it's got to be a blood that is different from all other blood and is not a blood that's Padian to where we are now ah it's got to take a blood that can loosen us that can break the hold of sin and change a blood that's able to say the person that generation the curse is broken it's gotta be a blood that why I can't speak there's gotta be one speak for me [Applause] hallelu any man the made of a woman made under the law now think of this in Romans 8 verse 3 Paul said for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh what love sending his own son in the likeness not sinful flesh but in the likeness of it sinful flesh would to be a birth like has been but this is a virgin birth and because he is of the virgin birth then he can announce it's time for new birth below could not do it now watch now it was weak through the flesh but God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us notice the righteousness of the law not that you become mr. and mrs. perfect the righteousness of the law is where God deals with the life on the inside he deals with the germ life were you with me he's dealing with that on the inside that's a real righteousness not a righteousness that you can put on and take off this is not a righteousness that you keep this is God's own righteousness no man could produce this this is God's righteousness this is to him be glory in the church throughout a league all ages who do I walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so God came down and he took his own laws and lived by him he took his own laws and live by how was he able to do that because that's who he is but the law was stone his nature in graven in it come on somebody the law the law itself Paul likens in one place the ministration of death how long did was this just a little bit here because the reality is let me just make this statement there was and there is nothing wrong with the law of God but something you just said it was engraving in stone that's right but that's not what God wanted to do God let it be known in that manner but his desire was to write it in you it meant wrong with the law it's our nature that needed changing they're right but you see this is why when the scripture says that the word in Gen in John 1:14 once made flesh the tree of life made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory right full of what grace and truth full of not just a little tinkling little bit full let me just drop this this is the gathering together for redemption the ministry of the son of man in the end time it's gathering together the ministry of the son of man and redemption for what it's the bride coming of Christ its Christ now dwelling behind his bride the same Jesus in bride form the parallels opened the side took out the elements comprise men of the church now here the bride stepping forth what is it it's that say that bride that words come from him she his bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life she is him who is she the Son of man revealed a son of man was here revealing feasts on a man but the Son of Man is revealed behind human skin you know but it took a son a man with a call to go out by wire to do what bring you an act to the place of a union very men to let you and I know hey this is the time this is the union time this is a time that all creation has longed for this is a time of redemption everybody else's that it's foolishness we don't need all that but to the electors something expires it scares us into position what is it we are part of Redemption amen we're not a type it's all tights gathered together ester Rebecca on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on full of grace God providing for you and I but we could not do grace full of grace shoutings of grace full of truth not just part through these are the true sayings of God full of truth what is truth truth is not a doctrine Pilate said what is truth hey Jesus said for this cause was I born to bear witness not of a truth but the truth what is the truth the truth from before in eternity reflected in the garden the truth is the person of Christ himself life I am come to bear witness to the truth my existence here was to be that perfect sacrifice that lies the web God himself injected back down into humanity Paul said the law was holy and the commandment holy and just and good romans 4 7 14 4 we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin nothing wrong with the law but it needed to be away to where this could come into man but what God the only way it could happen it would be by God himself coming down and taking his own laws and living by them how could he take his own laws by the very life itself being lived out through him what was being lived out the fulfillment of the law the fulfillment of the law was I do this I don't do this I don't do that I do this that's not what the fulfillment the fulfillment was from an inward work that desire to do only those things that please him he's the first of this new race that's the characteristic of every new birth desire to do only those things that please him glory be to God man so here in Redemption now let me just work with this just a little bit here I'm not going to ask you if you're getting tired Redemption but look at this redemption of his don't remember the leaves they thought injection of himself into the human race so he's got look Satan had to find a vessel that he could inject himself into right so God God is not looking over the span of humanity and trying to find wonder who'd be a good one hmm see Abraham David no no man was worthy are you with me see when we're not talking about bringing a continent continuation of this here but God himself provides for himself a body he's got to provide a body that he can step in to inject himself into not just move upon him prophesy and move back redemption is he comes to his own claims his own remains in his own on his own with his own i will walk in them you with me now John 1:32 and John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode upon him and I knew him not John you didn't you mean to tell me you didn't know you all related daddy what he's talking about he did know him in this way if some of us knew one another before we know one another how we know one another now come on somebody you don't know me like you used to know me I don't know you like I used to know you what's happened I know you in a different manner why there has life on the inside what we'll send out with the church on my life so I'm talking about you can have a church life I'm talking about when Christ is your life that's the difference where it is actually a pulsation it's a reflection of Christ it's not a okay we go to church this time the week and we do this we do that and we do this that's not what we're talking about we're talking about our life brought by a love affair brought by relationship and I said I drew him not but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him well here's the difference now this separates him from the prophets the prophets that would descend and move back but now it's remaining God injecting himself into the human race it was always the word and his birth he was the word he stood as a 12 year old boy no you're not I must be about my father's business he wants to live but when he walked into the River Jordan and he walked up out of the River Jordan here the Holy Spirit from God comes down and what does it do it quickens him to the word you know what God was doing he's showing an example of every son and daughter of God being born again Jesus didn't have a nature that needed changing come on somebody come on that had to be quickened he had to have the promises quickened to him i'ma tell you if the promises ain't quicken you can have a lot of knowledge about them but when they're quick and there's something in you that spans knowledge will not stand friends of me tell you something knowledge is no match for the devil it makes me a quickened word inside of you that this has become alive inside of me it is my life about whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizeth with the Holy Ghost this is the Redeemer anointing different from all the prophets this is the and this is the anointing that had come like the rainbow parts of upon the rest of the prophets but now it had come together God is light he was standing this light that lighteth every man here was this light behind the vessel behind the veil come on somebody and it light was not shown again and coming out again he went in here and it wasn't shown again until Klaus saw it on the road to Damascus and when Paul saw their life he said who are you lord he said I am Jesus whom thou persecute us God took the corporal body home but left himself here with us doradito god oma think about this the most glorious event happened right there at the River Jordan the most glorious event was not the birth wonderful that that virgin birth OMA how wonderful but you know the Prophet even says it like this and I believe you can agree that the the new birth is even more miraculous than the virgin birth but the greatest moment in history God and man coming together here is a vessel here is a body that has been prepared and this body that has been prepared the word remember Mary said how can this be seeing I know not a man Mary the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee is that right and the body God created a body for himself to come and dwell in God injecting himself into the human race Oh glory be to God he got to breed his back he's got to breed his way back so God injects himself into as you might remember here he is coming here in Jena Luke chapter 3 verse 21 when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in the a my well pleased louis god say here he was he was coming down from the heavens he was screaming down from the heavens the fullness of God the fullness of God he's going to visit the earth why there's a body on earth that the fullness can come into let me say this to you right now the bride of Jesus Christ is the body on earth that the fullness has - hey man it's Redemption the bride coming of Christ what did it do here the heavens are open heavens were closed off but the heavens were opened latest event in history God and man uniting together heaven and earth embracing and kissing one another humility met with humility the lamb and the doubt United here was a lamb coming down to the river he was always a lamb is that right and the Dove came to the lamb he was always a lamb the Dove coming didn't make him a lamb that does revealed him to be the lamb and the Dove coming to you reveals to you you are lamb is that right he is the Lamb's Book of Life he is that book that they forced flooded floor fitted in the garden that book that was forfeited in the garden did not have all the names that populate the earth it was that little book come on somebody the lab section and what is he doing Isaiah 53 dividing the spoil with the strong who are the strong they are his seed line the Messiah's brothers are the strong and he's dividing his see his life greatest event in history most sublime one of the most sublime here when God steps forward and what's he doing what's he doing what what is this whole coming of the death what is this it's Redemption this my word has created this body they're right my spirit my words our spirit in life they're right the word went forth the Holy Spirit come to that word that was spoken to Mary see the word had to be spoken first not the Spirit of God latter rain coming right behind that word to do what create in you and I what he already said he would do you miss me so here is that word here is here yes and what's he doing he's claiming what he himself has created my world has created that body alright I'm coming now to redeem what belongs to me what's he doing he must do that and when he's doing that he's also testified through him I will redeem the rest of my creation god this is where are the scriptures I'm conscious of time friends but I believe you need to pinch yourself I'll tell you this is not just something we're just looking at in church and just well we're getting done when we're not talking about churches I'm here we're talking about eternal life we're talking about things right now the way your attitude and things could be could make the difference for you right now you can say lord help me Lord God - Lord receive these things that are coming forth the Lord I forsake that tiredness or not weariness listen friends I'm tired and weary - you may not think so but I'm tired and weary but you know there's a word that God has given right here and I've asked God in my heart wine preached and I've had to do it now had to do it many times help me and give me the strength Lord - just say what you once said Lord here he comes here is this body that's prepared in the in Psalms 40 verse 6 sacrifice and offering thou did us not desire now did is not desire did not he require sacrifice he did but that is not what he desired mine ears look at this this is a key my nears has now opened that word open me noosed a channel has been opened the heavens have been opened there's one who's no longer just walking by a letter but one who is in contact with the author himself and the is to be expressed he that hath an ear to hear let him hear what the Spirit says what's he doing this being able to hear is delivering him from what has become church anity burnt offerings and sacrifices and everything and just they say it's delivering him from just church Hannity that's what the real Holy Ghost does it delivers us from being just carnal church members but we become spirit new by the Spirit of God where God speaks with divine option divine inspiration and it's glorious because the inner man has to tell the kokuboro sometimes shut up the devil can get on that Kaka Braun say you just think that way but the inside man said this is what God told me shut up you can even either come along with me peaceably or I'll drag you your choice but you're going come on now how many times I got to drag my a bronze stand right here and you got to drag your a bro right there oh there's wonderful those times in mind that with everything also are three parts and my goodness I really feel like going to the house of God man tyrant and then there's other times where you are having to tell yourself come on get with it yeah my my this is gonna be good not just now but if God carries burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required he didn't require this he did he did but this was not his desire this did not fulfill his longing you know how it is when you get a hunger for something in your house well you think it's in your house then I got a taste for something watch this what about this yeah what about this [Music] go to bed why nothing's being mentioned that that seems to appeal to you it about said the problem all the brothers staying quiet they want to say nothing some of the single ones raising their hands you won't be doing that longing buddy but there's something that's craving there's something that's long but they tell you something you think you were wrong you think creation was longing he was longing he's been longing to bring this Redemption plan before that was Adam sky that's your molecule he's wanted to hear your praises breathe from your lips from your life he's wanted this well he's been longing and you think you're longing for the rapture you're thinking you're longing to see his face he's longing to see you more than your only to see him and that is so great because sometimes with the perplexity of life and cares we can get down but the longing that he has and his place within us will not allow us to succumb to Kookaburra lism then said I know I come in the volume of the book it is written of me look at this I delight to do thy will who my god yea thy law is within my heart I have preached righteousness and every congregation preached it there not only did he say it but there's times he preached without words that's what I've said to you before preach every one of you preach and some of you are ordained to use words but every one of us are deign to preach what righteousness preaching laches of my wife your life though I have not reflect my lips o Lord thou knowest I have I've not hear thy righteousness within my heart I have declared thy faithfulness and that salvation I have not concealed by loving-kindness and that truth from the great congregation I have declared thy faithfulness he told me to come back to this and I'm going to the faithfulness it's one thing when you experience God's healing touch you experience an answer right then and there but it's another thing when you're in the midst of a trial in the midst of a temptation and the pressure is coming the pressures on the Lord Jesus himself here God allowed him to get as far as the mortality to the weakest point are you with me in temptation and here that devil came to him and said that's hungry turn these stones into bread there was a natural craving that wanted that he's dealing with repulsion of natural cravings what did he say here is I have declared thy faithfulness I have declared my faithfulness get thee behind me Satan for it is written thou shalt not live but by if every word of God he was standing on the father's word he wasn't overcoming because he didn't feel tempted and he was tempted temptation is not desire you miss me his resistance against the land there was a life from the inside that resisted against it this was filling the pool but on the inside what was he doing standing on the father's were not using any of his great supernatural powers no no he stood on the word he was offered position he stood I'm there remember in the word where Paul says neither height nor depth remember that neither height nor depth you know - depth deals with your perception your perception you know it is get on Google map and you look down even on this area right here some of you then hunting deer what will we do we'll get on them we'll get on the map will look down we'll try to find trails trying to find pinch points try to find certain things where we can get those deers they're coming in what are you doing you're at a different vantage point things look differently you're able to make different calculations different things and that is exactly where the enemy notice he takes him up onto a high place what's he doing showing different perceptions of things come on somebody well the enemy will try to bring a lot of perceptions our way but what's important that we stand on the word sometimes we can see something in a different way it's a different perception but remember the word remains the word neither height nor depth Satan did the first splice job he cut together and placed it together all the kings of this world sure it in the moments time but what he forgot to do he put all the glory spots in it you know it's like taking a shot of the Capitol building in Washington DC and not taking a shot of what lays behind it come on the hood and everything else that lays back there everything that lays back there all the projects and everything else it's like taking home ah this glorious Capitol what's behind it but that Satan as he presents all the glamour but I want to know what's behind it and the Spirit of God came to John and John was looking upon this woman and he wondered with great amazement but the Spirit of God is committed to his word and John is a part of that word and the Spirit of God did what took the cover off of her wool she's an evil woman and Hebrews 10 verse 7 I'm coming down I really am this is Paul referring to this then said i lo how come in the volume of the book it is written to me to do thy will O God above when he said sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin that would us not neither has the pleasure therein which are offered by the law there offered by the law see God's you see God God didn't want you or me serving him by duty I mean how you know you don't want anything but duty you don't want things by duty in your own home like Paul Raydor you know he kissed his wife run out the door he got down the solid sidewalk and got to thinking about her he ran back in and grabbed her and laid a good old smack on so one of the roles are different second one had a lot of feeling in it God don't want you and I doing things by duty listen friends that that's not maintainable I don't care how good intentions you can say oh god I promise our promises fail that's the god of gunny looking for a pledge Lord I'll be a church honey looking for no pledge god I that's not what God wants he just wants you he'll do the rest that's all he wants that's all ones he don't want promises he wants surrender offered by the law then said helo I come to do thy will o God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once before a law he takes away the first that he may establish the second he took away that life he took away that nature he took away that you and I walking in that measure he took that away that he might establish the second he establishes the second this is where Paul could say in Romans three the law has not been done away with but rather it's been established it's established what is it it's come to its rightful position in the hearts of his people like the ark setting down in the Old Testament it sets down sockets when the Bible says in Colossians to him I'm coming y'all still with me verse 2 Colossians 2:13 you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses so the devil wants to bring up your past God don't bring your past up when you've met his requirements it's been putting to see if forgetfulness oh yeah brother Sam there's no fishing why do you have to put a no fishing sign you don't remain you can't remain in the blood it ain't like your sins are stuck in the sea of forgetfulness oh that's a big bass so that's a smallmouth that's a big mouth that no no no no no no the blood dismantles it it separates it from you and it puts it back up on the one who brought the inspiration in the beginning that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does that's why when the blood of Jesus Christ is preached it is the Word of God for that hour the Spirit of God taken that word and the blood of God going forth what does it do it brings separation notice what he did blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to the cross blotting it out he didn't do away with the law he changed you and I that's the blotting out that was necessary he condemned sin in the flesh by what by the righteousness of the spirit of life dwelling behind that vessel that here is a life that lives pleasing under the Lord it took her out took it out of the way when people say oh he did oh we're in grace he did away with a lot no grace establishes the law grace establishes it he puts it in its place hallelujah James 1:21 wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls the engrafted word the engrafted is inborn implanted by nature implanted by others instruction he injected himself created a body injected his life into that body took his own walls lived by it paid the price went down bore our sins as the burden bear into hell deposit him there ascended back up released those in paradise that were waiting and rose with those arose with those Saints appeared and walked upon the earth for forty days that right and went on up in the process of that time appeared and then as he come back down moving around there among them with forty days then here there's a secret going away those Saints that had been resurrected now are caught away have you been resurrected if you've been resurrected you shall be caught away it was a secret God nobody else knew about it but they were being caught up and here he comes doing what he becomes the high priest of his own word and he sends back that same life to us enough there on the day of Pentecost what is it it's the new birth it's being born again of the incorruptible Word of God receiving the engrafted word implanted into our lives by nature God a great mystery God taking a color ball and putting wheat life on the inside of that talkable same old temple but a new creation on the inside the Sims I used to do I do them no more The Sims I used to do I do their no more the sins I used to do I do them no more it was a glad day when I was born again I don't want to do it grieves me anything that I do that displeases him it grieves me when I have a wrong thought about something sure that I'm telling you the truth friends well my attitude gets a little bit out of line it grieves me it bothers me you know what it is it's a kookaburra but thanks be to God they're sweet life things be to God they're sweet life that's the stream of the Tree of Life and that string of the Tree of Life is greater than any strain from the genetics of our natural birth greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world now you could say like Paul collations 2:20 I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not i but Christ liveth in me Paul sir you mean you're two different people kokuboro wheat life yet not I concur burl but its Christ wait life that liveth in me hmm and the life which I now live in the cocklebur oh I live by the faith the wheat life of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me in the middle of that quote having conferences in the middle of that quote the second paragraph and he put me my life here and my anyone knows that something happened to me I was a cocklebur and he made a wheat out of me I don't know how it ever come how could it ever be he that is born of the Spirit is like that of the wind when sit come when said God you cannot explain why because the tenderness of the love of Jesus Christ has struck your heart to the world and you are alive in Christ this is the new birth this is the mystery from kokuboro - we life this is the necessary reality to overthrow emilich this is dealing with a Mallick and it is his strength in you and in me we get weak yet he's strong you love him are you thankful are you thankful for what he's done for you thankful for what he's done what mercy and grace to bring this so clear to you and I and to draw from our lives you see this is the very grace of God - what draw from our life he know no pressure he don't want to pressure I delight to do thy will o God something to being drawn it's being drawn he's loosening my ear a channel a channel is opened when if there's any life any heart you want to be remembered in prayer there's things that I just say like this God knows he knows the depth and he knows just exactly where for each and every one of us are at but I say it like this because it is what I feel upon my heart I want this to become more personal I wanted to become more personal more real in me more of a whole more of a reality within my life this is the promise of God that this word would continue to quicken quick and quick and quick and catching us away if you here and you need that experience with God God is here to deliver that but it's not it's something that it has to be what you desire but I'll say this to you this morning don't try to form it in your imagination it's this or it's that it's Christ it's you letting go it's you giving your all saying Lord I'm not gonna try to do this Lord but lord I want you and have faith that what God he has spoken and he has promised that he is able to do everything all that you have need up he knows the circumstances he knows right where you're setting he knows every situation in your life but remember he's not just taken off an arm or a foot he comes for the head he comes to remove that ruling authority good to be won and want to be remembered in prayer so the Lord I desire that in my life water hallelujah God bless you I bless those hands how about someone who would say Lord I want more of you Lord I want more of that of that life Lord help me I don't want this cocklebur Lord to get in the way I want to die as Paul said die daily not just once in a while but I want to want to continue to die to myself lord help me Lord and you know he is he's going to help you he is your strength but make him your resource of strength giving yourself even from this moment just giving yourself over to him having faith and you're letting that word praying and looking to the Lord allow him to build and grow and move adding in your life allow him to do that say Lord I want more of you I've read it I read a quote there at the men's meeting I've read it here many times and the message images of Christ brother Ram said while this tabernacle is having a revival he said I want to have one in myself said I want more of the Holy Ghost to take over more of William Brennan I want more of the Holy Spirit so I don't care what plane I got to come on I want more of the Holy Spirit and they say Lord I want to refill I want more Lord I want more I got both of my hands up I want more Lord I want more of you Lord more and more over and over I hear your prophet say even in 1965 stand there saying old God made the Spirit of God coming quick in this Lord

believe and our belief let's put it into action let's go before the throne of grace the Bible said that we might have we might find help in the time of need that time of need isn't always when something's on your back or something's bothering you but a time of need is where you can recognize and say Lord I've got need of you Lord throne of grace Heavenly Father Lord this has been a longer Lord but I think you've forgiven me the strength and forgiving the people the strength Lord your God spiritually Lord just being able Lord to be in tune Lord look there are many hands that have went up Lord throughout this congregation there are many hearts Lord you've touched our hearts Lord Father you've spoken to us Lord in a more personal way Nord whenever we can never be the same when we walk out of this building today as we walked in we're either gonna leave closer to you or we'll leave farther away but God I believe Lord that hearts that have gathered here they've not gathered to leave out of your farther away hands that have been lifted up Lord God Lord throughout the building from those desiring Lord that true indwelling of your holy spirit Lord in their life they recognize Laura I need that change in my life Lord I need that Lord that that implanting Lord that weak life Oh God Lord I pray that God right now that as they raised their hand Lord may they recognize that God even in that that that was a defying Lord of the law of gravity itself Lord God that Lord there was something within them Lord that would cause them Lord God to move that hand Lord showing the daughter heart had been touched Lord and the desire or God that they have Lord that you have pricked Lord that you have moved upon Lord God that you might come Lord and quench Lord and feel Lord through a satisfaction Lord to where everything Lord that they would have in their mind of thinking I gotta get rid of this and I gotta get rid of that but father right now God to where you become the preeminent one Lord where it becomes Lord God you stepping forward Lord in everything else Lord that God would seem like the Lord making it impossible but where you come on the scene Lord God and you become the FEMA bear Fox right now Lord you become the delight of God of their heart right now Lord God and they set their focus Lord upon Lord to know Lord all that you have spoken Lord by way of your word Lord not and you come right behind your word Lord to fulfill your word Lord in our hearts in our life I pray dear God Lord granted here Lord this morning Lord that this soul God would be a beginning or God Oh father in many hearts and many lives Lord that it would be a birthday Lord God in many lives or God been Lord from this moment this service this time Lord that father very painful Lord they haven't say there is a difference Lord not something Lord that they're trying to do Lord but a change within them Lord Lord I believe this was on my heart that God when they have raised their hand and father by faith Lord they appropriated that promise Lord your God you're able to come right there and do the work right there I pray that God that way even when they walk out of this presence Lord and they go back on their cars and go home make their God in me may that presence Lord and that Lord not be removed from their mind but may they God with anticipation Lord may they wait

ought to be moved by the pulsation of the Holy Spirit there is a communication law taking place between you and your children mode the sons of God are led by the Spirit of God Lord we realized the high calling the word that has come to us in this hour a high calling Lord and like Paul we press on Lord and as Paul so said Lord not as though I had already attained rather I seek that I might apprehend that which I am apprehended of said I count myself not to have made it already as far as in his soul yes but Paul was seen to much of Paul's - oh Lord granted this morning Lord may we
