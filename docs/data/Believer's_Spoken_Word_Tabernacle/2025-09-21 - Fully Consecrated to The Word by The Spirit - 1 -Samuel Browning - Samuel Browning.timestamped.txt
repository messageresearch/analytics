[29:16] your amazing ways.

[29:27] breathing.

[29:34] loves me.
[29:36] The mountains,
[29:40] you're breaking down the weight of all
[29:44] my mountains.
[29:48] And even when it feels like I'm
[29:52] surrounded,
[29:57] you never leave my side.
[30:03] Lord,
[30:05] nobody loves me. Hallelujah.
[30:10] Like you love me, Jesus.
[30:12] Yes. I stand in awe.

[30:35] time.

[30:43] Jesus.
[30:45] I stand in all your amazing
[30:51] ways.
[30:53] I worship you long as I am.
[31:01] God, you are faithful and true. Nobody
[31:06] loves me like you. God, you are faithful
[31:11] and true. Nobody loves me like you.
[31:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[34:32] Word of God speak as brother Sam Mcomes.
[34:35] Amen. Looking forward to the word this
[34:37] morning.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:40] How many loves when God goes down into
[34:42] your life and individually it's speaking
[34:44] to everybody but you know he's
[34:45] individually speaking to you. Let's just
[34:47] pray that word of God speak this morning
[34:49] as a pastor comes. I'm finding myself
[34:56] at a loss for words.
[35:01] And the funny thing is
[35:04] it's okay.
[35:07] The last thing I need
[35:12] is to be heard
[35:17] but to hear
[35:20] what you would say.
[35:23] Word of God speak.
[35:27] Would you pour down my grave,
[35:31] washing my eyes to see
[35:36] your majesty
[35:39] to be still and know
[35:43] your in this place.
[35:47] Please let me stay and rest
[35:52] in your holiness.
[35:55] Word of God speak.
[35:58] Yes, Lord.
[36:00] [Music]
[36:03] Finding myself. I believe that this
[36:05] morning, Lord, in the midst of you,
[36:11] beyond the music,
[36:15] beyond the door.
[36:18] Lord, all that I need
[36:23] is to be with you.
[36:27] And in the quiet, Lord,
[36:31] hear your voice.
[36:34] Word of God speak.
[36:38] Would you poured out thy grave,
[36:43] washing my eyes to see
[36:47] your majesty
[36:50] be still and know
[36:54] you're in this place.
[36:58] Please let me stay and rest
[37:03] in your holiness.
[37:06] Word of God speaks.
[37:10] Sing that again. Word of God speak.
[37:13] Oh, word of God speak.
[37:18] Would you pour down my grace,
[37:22] washing my eyes to see
[37:27] your majesty
[37:30] to be still and know
[37:33] that you're in this place.
[37:38] Please let me stay and rest
[37:42] in your holiness.
[37:46] Word of God speak.
[37:50] So sing that as brother S. Holy Spirit
[37:52] rain down. Let's all stand as brother S
[37:54] comes.
[37:56] Holy Spirit rain
[37:58] [Music]
[38:01] down
[38:05] rain
[38:08] down.
[38:11] Oh,
[38:15] and friend,
[38:18] how we need your touch
[38:22] again.
[38:24] Holy Spirit, rain,
[38:28] rain down.
[38:32] Glor
[38:37] down.
[38:40] Let you powerful.
[38:42] &gt;&gt; Let your voice be heard. Come and change
[38:48] our hearts as we s
[38:53] [Music]
[39:01] rain rain down.
[39:05] Hallelujah.
[39:07] Hallelujah. Certainly there's no greater
[39:10] desire, amen, that we would have that he
[39:12] would just move among us in a special
[39:14] way.
[39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That the Holy Spirit would just so
[39:17] saturate our hearts and our lives aresh
[39:21] and we would leave from this place this
[39:24] morning should he tar different people
[39:27] than when we walked in.
[39:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Just more of less of us and more
[39:33] of him. And uh I certainly believe and I
[39:36] think we can agree together he's able to
[39:38] do the exceeding abundantly above all
[39:41] that we could think or ask.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; You believe that this morning?
[39:46] &gt;&gt; You know even every time when we come to
[39:48] the house of God,
[39:50] you know every service is always unique.
[39:55] Every service is unique.
[39:58] Every service is different.
[40:02] But you know what really makes the
[40:04] service
[40:06] is the expectation.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; It's the Holy Spirit just moving in our
[40:12] midst. And where there's an expectation
[40:15] in our hearts. And I pray that I pray
[40:19] that if any of that has been lost, may
[40:20] the Holy Spirit come
[40:22] &gt;&gt; with a great raise and warmth of his
[40:25] love and rekindle
[40:29] &gt;&gt; that in our lives. Because we are people
[40:32] of an expectation all the way down
[40:34] through the ages.
[40:36] &gt;&gt; They have lived for his coming. They did
[40:38] not know. Paul did not know that the
[40:41] coming of the Lord was not in his day.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "For we shall not all sleep."
[40:48] &gt;&gt; Paul was looking for the coming of the
[40:49] Lord in his generation. The prophet
[40:52] said, "Every one of them went into the
[40:54] grave running in stride with that
[40:57] message. Yes.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; And when the resurrection comes, they're
[41:00] not going to miss a beat. They'll come
[41:02] right They'll come out running right
[41:03] right in the stretch.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; They were people of expectation.
[41:08] &gt;&gt; They were believers. They had battles
[41:10] just like you and I do. We have to
[41:12] battle through commonality and
[41:15] commonness of life. We have to battle to
[41:18] where that the pressures and everything
[41:20] of life, it would like to try to pull
[41:23] from us an expectation to where we would
[41:27] just become
[41:29] ritual.
[41:32] And you know what can do that? Just
[41:33] life. Just allowing things to get
[41:36] between us and God.
[41:39] But I say, God, let everything be
[41:42] cleared out of the way. there's anything
[41:44] that is working to try to hinder that
[41:47] and take that out of the way. That's
[41:48] God's desire is that our hearts would be
[41:50] filled with such an expectation that in
[41:53] our hearts not just for a service here
[41:54] this morning but for every day of our
[41:57] life to expect his coming to expect God
[42:00] and to just expect him to move upon our
[42:04] lives and to speak to our hearts.
[42:06] There's no greater to me, friends.
[42:07] There's no greater pleasure than to be
[42:10] in his presence
[42:12] &gt;&gt; and that he would speak to our hearts
[42:14] and our lives. There's no And you know
[42:16] what? That's not something that's just
[42:18] confined here to this to this walls just
[42:22] here with this week. Just to give you an
[42:23] example, and I know you could share with
[42:25] this. I'm just driving
[42:28] and I'm on my way here and there's a
[42:31] message and I actually thought I had
[42:33] turned to listen to another message
[42:35] because I had to do a few tasks while I
[42:37] was on my way here. And I'm listening
[42:40] and I'm thinking, "Wow, that message is
[42:43] almost Brother staying out with starting
[42:45] out with some of the same things that
[42:47] I've been listening to out of this
[42:49] particular message over here." And I
[42:50] thought, "Wow, that's just more." And I
[42:52] thought, well, when I get to a stop, I
[42:53] can grab some of that and put that into
[42:55] another study. And I began to realize
[42:59] that message didn't kick over to the
[43:01] message that I was wanting to listen to
[43:03] at that moment. It reverted right back
[43:05] into the message that I had already been
[43:07] listening to a couple times through the
[43:09] week. And right there in that moment,
[43:12] the Holy Spirit just spoke something to
[43:14] my heart. And I pray that God will allow
[43:16] me at some point to share this with you.
[43:19] But it spoke to my heart. And I tell
[43:21] you, the presence of God just come right
[43:23] there
[43:24] &gt;&gt; in that car. And I just begin to
[43:26] worship.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you wish you had a
[43:30] self-driving car.
[43:35] Just begin to worship. Begin to thank
[43:37] God for his goodness. It wasn't just
[43:38] about the thought. It wasn't just
[43:40] something to speak, but what it was
[43:42] about was it was about him
[43:44] &gt;&gt; and him and who he is
[43:46] &gt;&gt; to me. What he is to me and what his
[43:49] desire is in our lives is that
[43:51] everything that he would remain
[43:54] completely the the full view of our
[43:56] lives. Amen.
[43:59] So good to be together together uh here
[44:02] this even this morning and so glad to
[44:04] have brother James, brother Justin, and
[44:06] good to have each and every one of you.
[44:08] Amen. Good to have brother Bobby and
[44:10] sister Michelle and Chrissy here with us
[44:11] this morning as well. Amen. It's good to
[44:14] be in his presence.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so let's just look to the Lord
[44:19] in a word of prayer before we turn into
[44:21] the scriptures. I want to say musicians,
[44:23] thank you so much. Amen.
[44:27] Let's just go to the Lord in a word of
[44:28] prayer here. Our heavenly father
[44:32] Lord as we just
[44:35] oh God are so thankful Lord for these
[44:38] moments that you
[44:41] Lord permit and you just give to us Lord
[44:45] allow us to come and Lord we thank you
[44:48] for the Lord the strength and the
[44:51] fortitude Lord to press beyond Lord our
[44:54] flesh our feelings beyond every thought
[44:57] for Lord we know that Lord there is a
[45:00] blessing Lord that is for us Lord from
[45:04] you. Lord, sometimes when we come here,
[45:07] Lord, as we come with tests and trials,
[45:10] as I heard brother Brian mention,
[45:12] sometimes Lord, with the pre pressures
[45:14] and the cares of life that we go through
[45:18] and Lord, yet if there wasn't the
[45:21] pressures and the cares, Lord, when we
[45:24] look at in our lives, Lord, perhaps
[45:27] Lord, we would not be as Lord fervent as
[45:30] we need to be in seeking you. And this
[45:34] is why that Paul would even write of
[45:36] this. Lord, we bear about in our body
[45:38] the dying of the Lord Jesus that the
[45:41] life of the Lord Jesus might be made
[45:44] manifest as well. And Lord, we are
[45:47] certainly do not count ourselves or
[45:49] think that we are able to bear these
[45:51] burdens or these pressures. But Lord, we
[45:54] allow and we go to you in prayer for we
[45:57] know that you are the way maker. Lord,
[45:59] you're the one to make a way through
[46:01] every circumstance and situation of
[46:04] life. And Lord, we ask only that you
[46:06] would just give us the grace, Lord. And
[46:09] may our vision be unhindered, Lord. May,
[46:12] Lord, it be focused upon you. And may we
[46:15] see you clearly, Lord. For truly, Lord,
[46:18] you're not absent. You've not, Lord,
[46:21] become disinterested, Lord, but yet
[46:23] you're standing right in the midst of
[46:25] your church, Lord. You're directing and
[46:28] governing over all the affairs of men.
[46:31] Father, you are our husband, our
[46:33] bridegroom, Lord. You are our lover,
[46:36] Lord, our savior, our redeemer. You
[46:38] care, Lord, for us, Lord. You watch over
[46:41] us, Lord. And we're so thankful for
[46:43] that. And we would ask that God, that
[46:46] even here this morning, Lord, may you
[46:48] just come, Lord, according to every
[46:50] heart and every need. Lord, we just give
[46:53] ourselves to you Lord unreservedly, not
[46:55] as not only as speaker but as hearer. I
[46:59] pray that God that may everything Lord
[47:02] Jesus just be Lord such a clear and an
[47:05] open channel to you and Lord if there be
[47:07] anything Lord in any channel of our
[47:10] lives that would be hindering Lord may
[47:13] you Lord bring that forth Lord direct it
[47:16] because our desire Lord is to bear fruit
[47:20] Lord to bear that expression oh God of
[47:23] of your own life there's no greater
[47:25] there's no greater name that we could be
[47:28] called than to be known as Mrs. Jesus
[47:31] Christ, a real Christian, a real
[47:34] believer. Lord, as the prophet said, if
[47:36] you love me, call me brother. Lord
[47:39] Jesus, we just ask here this morning
[47:41] that you'll presence will just sweep
[47:44] through this congregation, Lord. Move,
[47:46] Lord, upon every heart and every life.
[47:49] And Lord, we just ask that you would
[47:51] direct your word, Lord. And just give
[47:53] me, Lord, just even the direction I
[47:56] need, Lord. Oh God, under the
[47:58] inspiration that you've placed on my
[48:00] heart, I stand here, Lord, just as your
[48:02] servant, Lord, and a servant to your
[48:04] people, Lord. May you come, Lord, I
[48:07] pray, and minister to every need and
[48:09] every heart. May the love of God, so
[48:12] Lord, take a hold and wrap our hearts
[48:14] and draw us closer to you, Lord. I pray
[48:17] we commit this service, Lord, into your
[48:19] hands. And just ask God for your
[48:21] blessing now upon the word in the name
[48:24] of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to go into the word here
[48:30] into Leviticus chapter 8. And I'm going
[48:34] to ask you to keep your Bibles handy
[48:36] because I'm not going to I did not put
[48:39] up every single places and portions of
[48:42] scripture that I'm going to refer to
[48:45] here this morning. And I want to kind of
[48:48] build a little bit of a um of a
[48:50] background uh and where that we are
[48:54] going. And there's no way
[48:56] uh that with this particular uh
[48:59] subthought I'm I'm not going to get
[49:01] close. I'm not going to get finished
[49:02] here this morning. I know that. But
[49:04] we'll get to where he wants us to get
[49:06] to. And so in Leviticus
[49:10] uh chapter 8 and verse one, now this
[49:13] this whole uh portion of scripture, the
[49:16] whole chapter 8 is the installing of
[49:20] priests into the priesthood. Not only
[49:23] the high priest but the priest. And we
[49:26] recognize that our high priest is the
[49:29] Lord Jesus Christ.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; And I want to just make this very clear
[49:33] that the Lord Jesus Christ is not a
[49:35] different person than God himself.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; It's very key.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; God restored in this hour the revelation
[49:45] of the Godhead.
[49:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God brought that about
[49:49] not just to um you know just to tickle
[49:53] our ears or not just to be something
[49:55] that's good or to be something to bait
[49:56] it or to be something to look down on
[49:59] someone else. I believe we understand
[50:00] that. But God revealed that revelation
[50:03] of the Godhead. It reveals who you and I
[50:06] really are.
[50:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. And it brings to light in
[50:10] this hour where the bride body that's
[50:12] been been in building all the way
[50:14] through is coming to a time of the
[50:17] capping where the headstone. We've
[50:19] received the message of the capstone,
[50:22] the message of the headstone. And what
[50:24] God is doing is bringing a people into
[50:26] that place of maturity. So here's a
[50:28] bride body that's been going on down
[50:30] through the ages. And now God through
[50:33] through his word is bringing a people
[50:36] together that they might see God's full
[50:40] intended purpose that God would dwell
[50:43] supremely in his bride body.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[50:49] &gt;&gt; I know that might seem like a mouthful,
[50:51] but we'll just try to get through that
[50:53] within this time. Leviticus chapter 8
[50:57] and verse one. And the Lord spake unto
[51:00] Moses, saying, and I think that's key.
[51:03] God didn't deliver this to anyone else.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; It's to Moses.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Take Aaron and his sons with him, and
[51:12] the garments, the anointing oil, and a
[51:15] bulock for the scent offering, and two
[51:18] rams, and a basket of unleavened bread.
[51:21] and gather thou all the congregation
[51:23] together unto the door of the tabernacle
[51:27] of the congregation. And Moses did as
[51:30] the Lord commanded him. And the assembly
[51:33] was gathered together unto the door of
[51:35] the congregation. And Moses said unto
[51:38] the congregation, this is the thing
[51:41] which the Lord commanded to be done.
[51:45] Amen. May God bless you and bless the
[51:48] reading of the word as you're being
[51:49] seated.
[52:01] I want to just in speaking of of of
[52:05] these things and how that
[52:09] the priest would be installed. I want
[52:11] you to remember,
[52:13] we've read, we've touched certain
[52:15] scriptures throughout for the past few
[52:17] weeks and touched on a few things where
[52:22] Peter would write, "You are a royal
[52:24] priesthood,
[52:26] a chosen generation."
[52:30] And he would say, "You a spiritual
[52:33] priesthood." and how that not only you
[52:37] would be a part of the building of the
[52:41] body of Jesus Christ of how that a
[52:44] spiritual house, a spiritual dwelling
[52:48] place. So a a temple where God would
[52:51] would reside in in the life of his
[52:55] children. And that's where that's where
[52:57] the revelation of the Godhead comes in
[52:59] to be able to see and recognize. when we
[53:03] can see and recognize who who Jesus was,
[53:07] how God came down and became one of us
[53:10] that it was that same example that God
[53:13] desires to dwell the same way within our
[53:16] lives.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; And so that same that that same deity,
[53:21] that same that same uh quality of
[53:24] himself would would so reside within our
[53:28] hearts. And this is why that when we see
[53:30] this of the Godhead, we recognize that
[53:33] Jesus is not the second person of the
[53:35] Godhead. And I know these are very uh
[53:37] simple things but you know uh sometimes
[53:40] how that the uh our minds sometimes and
[53:43] how within this hour can become
[53:45] construed and I'm not necessarily saying
[53:47] our minds but I'm saying it for the the
[53:50] the whole and the benefit of all of us
[53:52] to recognize that when John would write
[53:55] by the spirit of God he would speak of
[53:57] the love of God and the spirit of God
[54:00] and where we would stand in God and he
[54:02] would say that we are in this world now
[54:06] as he is. And to recognize that it's
[54:09] it's where the perfection of the
[54:12] sacrifice of the blood of the lamb and
[54:14] the life that was in that blood has now
[54:17] come back upon the worshipper and
[54:19] brought the worshipper into this place
[54:23] of fellowship with God that God intended
[54:27] man to dwell with. Now within this part
[54:31] here, I what I want to speak on is is
[54:33] fully consecrated to the word by the
[54:37] spirit.
[54:38] And I want to go just a few moments
[54:41] here. I want to go back into Hebrews
[54:43] chapter 7 if you'll turn there with me.
[54:45] And as I said, there's few places I'm
[54:47] going to ask you to turn in your
[54:49] scriptures here this morning. I have it
[54:52] here in front of me, but I just I would
[54:54] rather turn to it. Um, sometimes it's
[54:57] some of those points where I just want
[54:59] to just move in here. Uh, and just to
[55:03] pick up a few things
[55:05] and I want you to see that with Paul
[55:08] himself. And when Paul, it could be none
[55:11] other who wrote the book of Hebrews. And
[55:13] it's not Paul's intellect, but remember
[55:16] the Bible says that men, holy men of
[55:19] old, were moved upon by the Holy Spirit.
[55:23] And they would write under divine
[55:26] revelation, God bringing and tying
[55:29] things together. And Paul being the
[55:32] messenger to that first age, Paul being
[55:35] uh the prophet of of God in that hour,
[55:39] Paul would be able to take that and show
[55:42] that of law and grace and how that the
[55:44] law had been completely fulfilled
[55:48] through the grace of Jesus Christ. and
[55:51] then be able to present this to you and
[55:53] I. And I want to say this that Paul, we
[55:56] we we we we have such a uh I believe a
[55:59] settleness here in our hearts to
[56:01] recognize that when Paul would write of
[56:03] these things and write all the way
[56:05] through the book of Hebrews, if we can
[56:07] sum everything up in the book of
[56:09] Hebrews, Paul is simply only declaring
[56:13] the position where the Lord Jesus has
[56:15] been exalted to that he's above it all.
[56:19] Amen.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; That it is very the very God become one
[56:22] of us. It's God become flesh. It's God
[56:25] become one of us. He he is the exalted
[56:28] one that's in our midst. He is the word.
[56:31] He's the living God. And Paul Paul
[56:34] catches this. Now remember Paul his the
[56:37] revelation that Paul has. Paul saw him.
[56:40] The prophet would say this over and over
[56:43] and point this out because it's very
[56:45] key. Paul saw him after his death,
[56:48] burial, and resurrection, and after the
[56:51] Holy Spirit had come. Paul met him after
[56:54] he had returned back to a pillar of
[56:57] fire.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:00] &gt;&gt; God condescended all the way down for
[57:03] redemption because in just that form of
[57:05] pillar of fire, he couldn't redeem you
[57:07] and I.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; But God had to now come all the way. He
[57:12] comes all the way down. And now that
[57:14] pillar of fire had become a man,
[57:18] &gt;&gt; right? It's just like when they came to
[57:21] the river Jordan, the pillar of fire led
[57:23] them all the way up to the river Jordan.
[57:25] But when they came across the Jordan,
[57:27] the pillar of fire revealed itself as a
[57:30] man,
[57:30] &gt;&gt; captain of the Lord's host. That's
[57:32] right.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[57:33] &gt;&gt; I'm here to lead all the way. So now
[57:36] that within this of the pillar of fire,
[57:38] now coming back within the finished work
[57:41] of redemption because when he uh purged
[57:45] our sins, the Bible said he has sat down
[57:47] on the right hand of God. And we
[57:49] understand that right hand means power
[57:52] and authority. And he is there until his
[57:56] enemies of being made his foottool until
[57:59] although that Paul would say we see not
[58:02] all things yet, but we see Jesus. And
[58:04] that's what's important even when it
[58:06] comes down even into our lives that you
[58:10] may not see everything about in your
[58:13] life that you desire to see and want to
[58:15] see. But I'll tell you, it won't come
[58:17] any other way except by the Lord Jesus.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; And when I'm talking about the Lord
[58:22] Jesus, I'm not talking about the the
[58:25] body. I'm talking about the spirit of
[58:28] the living God. Because when Paul met
[58:30] him on the road to Damascus and he said,
[58:33] "Lord, who are you?" He saw that light,
[58:37] Paul understood enough that when that
[58:39] light appeared, it's God making himself
[58:42] known to his people and he said, "Who
[58:46] are you?" He said, "I am Jesus whom thou
[58:50] persecutest."
[58:51] &gt;&gt; So how God came down and remember that
[58:55] body is God's body. God created that
[58:58] body to come down and pay the price for
[59:02] you and I.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Remember the prophet tells us in the
[59:04] token, he says in order for redemption
[59:07] to come, God had to get himself a son
[59:10] back again. And the only way that could
[59:12] happen is is God would have to create
[59:16] and bring forth a body. And God created
[59:20] that body by his word.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; Mary did not help it. Mary did not
[59:27] assist it. Mary did not lend an egg to
[59:31] it. It was indeed the creation of
[59:34] almighty God. Do
[59:38] &gt;&gt; you know how glorious that is that there
[59:40] could come through and through his life
[59:43] that you and I could be brought to a
[59:45] place to be so loosened and so free from
[59:48] our own family tree to be so loosened
[59:51] and to be free from any defilement of
[59:54] sin and unbelief through and by that one
[59:57] and perfect offering and the Holy Spirit
[1:00:00] coming into our lives to make that real.
[1:00:02] You are free.
[1:00:05] Hallelujah.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; That's how glorious the offering of the
[1:00:09] Lord Jesus Christ is.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; There's no other there's no other
[1:00:13] greater name, no bigger name than the
[1:00:15] Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "Who are you?" He said, "I'm
[1:00:20] Jesus."
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; Whom thou persecutest. Now Paul comes in
[1:00:23] here in Hebrews 7 and we referred to
[1:00:27] this even a few weeks ago and then last
[1:00:29] week and Paul picks up about this
[1:00:32] mysterious one who is is is it reveals
[1:00:37] himself as Melzdc. And notice how Paul
[1:00:40] uh points this out in Hebrews 7 that
[1:00:44] this one who met Abraham and whom
[1:00:47] Abraham gave a tenth of all here here he
[1:00:50] is the king of Salem, king of the most
[1:00:52] high God. And here first being by
[1:00:55] interpretation, verse two, king of
[1:00:58] righteousness, after that king of Salem,
[1:01:00] which is king of peace, without father,
[1:01:03] without mother, without descent, having
[1:01:05] neither beginning of days nor end of
[1:01:07] life, but made like unto the son of God,
[1:01:10] abideth a priest continually. So God
[1:01:13] come down in veiled himself in light in
[1:01:17] the
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; which is no marvel because the Bible
[1:01:21] says when the fall took place in the
[1:01:24] garden it says that they heard the voice
[1:01:27] of God walking
[1:01:30] &gt;&gt; right
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; God dwells in a body and so here God
[1:01:34] dwelling here in theophony ex revealing
[1:01:37] himself to Abraham in that hour. Now I
[1:01:41] want to just I want to tie this in here.
[1:01:43] Without father, without mother, there
[1:01:45] can leave no doubt of who this is.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; There's only one eternal one.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Is that right? And that's God without
[1:01:55] father, without mother. Is that right?
[1:01:59] But now so within this but with when he
[1:02:02] met Abraham this way as he met Abraham
[1:02:05] even standing before his tent door he
[1:02:09] could not redeem Abraham then because he
[1:02:12] had to come through and by a woman.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Is that Galatians 4?
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; God in order to redeem us who were under
[1:02:20] the law. We couldn't get out of it. We
[1:02:22] were held guilty. We were even though as
[1:02:25] we were offering the blood of the lamb
[1:02:26] but the blood of the lamb, the blood of
[1:02:28] bulls and goats was not a perfect lamb.
[1:02:30] It could not take away the desire of
[1:02:32] sin, we would allow us to stand in God's
[1:02:35] presence, but it could not deal with the
[1:02:37] where the real problem was at.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; And I'm glad that God provided a blood
[1:02:44] that could deal with the with the real
[1:02:46] issue.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; How we thank God for forgiveness.
[1:02:51] how we thank God for the grace of God
[1:02:53] and we need it. But I want to say this
[1:02:56] to you this morning. Don't live beneath
[1:02:58] your privileges to where you have to
[1:03:00] say, "Well, I'll always have this habit
[1:03:02] or this besetting sin or this." No, you
[1:03:04] need to understand the blood of Jesus
[1:03:07] Christ is a perfect blood. Amen.
[1:03:10] &gt;&gt; It was shed to free you, to loosen you
[1:03:14] to where that you would be able to claim
[1:03:16] and bring down into your life what he
[1:03:19] has provided for you and I.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be if you're a servant
[1:03:24] to anything, servant to an attitude,
[1:03:26] servant to a complex, you're living
[1:03:28] beneath your privileges.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Soon as God reveals it, stand against
[1:03:34] that thing and say, "I resist you, Lord.
[1:03:36] forgive me for allowing that to reside
[1:03:39] in my life that way.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; That is so good.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; Paul would go on to write considering
[1:03:47] how great this man is. But
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; let me just let me move here
[1:03:52] into the scripture and let's move here
[1:03:55] to verse 17 or verse 16
[1:04:01] or maybe 15. And it's yet far more
[1:04:04] evident for that after the similitude of
[1:04:07] Melzdc there ariseth another priest.
[1:04:10] Notice after the similitude Melzdc was
[1:04:14] made like unto the son of God. So when
[1:04:17] you're thinking of son of God don't
[1:04:18] think of flesh think of theophony think
[1:04:21] of light.
[1:04:22] Are you with me? Now God come down and
[1:04:27] God through the creation there creates a
[1:04:30] body that he himself might come for the
[1:04:33] purpose of redemption. And this is where
[1:04:35] the scripture says that he was made
[1:04:37] after the similitude of Melzdc. There
[1:04:40] ariseth another priest. Who is that
[1:04:42] priest? The Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; who is made not after the law of a
[1:04:48] carnal commandment but after the power
[1:04:52] of an endless life. For he testified,
[1:04:55] thou art a priest forever after the
[1:04:57] order of Melzdc.
[1:04:59] For there is verily a disanoing of the
[1:05:02] commandment going before, for the
[1:05:04] weakness and the profitableness thereof.
[1:05:06] For the law made nothing perfect, but
[1:05:09] the bringing in of a better hope did by
[1:05:11] the which we draw nigh unto God. And in
[1:05:15] as much as not without an oath, he was
[1:05:17] made priest. For those priests were made
[1:05:19] without an oath, but this with an oath
[1:05:21] by him that said, "The Lord swear and
[1:05:24] will not repent. Thou art a priest
[1:05:27] forever after the order of Melzdc."
[1:05:32] Brother Ram said Jesus could give his
[1:05:34] life. This man couldn't because he was
[1:05:37] life.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; He's not separating the two. He's
[1:05:41] showing us the same God come down. God
[1:05:45] condescending all the way down.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Because now notice as we see this this
[1:05:55] this this Melazdc by so much was Jesus
[1:05:59] made assurityity of a better testament.
[1:06:02] And he goes on in verse 23, they were
[1:06:04] many priests and they were suffered not
[1:06:06] to continue by reason of death. But this
[1:06:08] man because he continuthth ever hath an
[1:06:11] unchangeable priesthood. Oh, I love
[1:06:14] this. He is able also to save them to
[1:06:17] the uttermost that come unto God by him.
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; He's not a way.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; He's the way.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:30] &gt;&gt; The way was kept all the way when he
[1:06:33] placed the flaming the the cherubam with
[1:06:35] the flaming sword. The way was kept
[1:06:37] white. God was saying, "I'm going to
[1:06:39] make a way back for man to come back
[1:06:41] from where he fell from." All right.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; And so now notice what a what a to me I
[1:06:48] love that scripture. He is able to save
[1:06:51] them to the uttermost that come unto God
[1:06:53] by him seeing he ever liveth to make
[1:06:56] intercession for them. Let me just say
[1:06:58] this for you and I that not only when
[1:07:00] his blood was shed did he go back
[1:07:03] through and intercede for all of them.
[1:07:06] Listen, he descended to the lowest parts
[1:07:08] of hell.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. And he came there and rising
[1:07:13] up with the proof of his own blood and
[1:07:16] paradise which was a holding place. It
[1:07:18] was not hell. It was a holding place
[1:07:21] that was reserved there in the bosom of
[1:07:23] Abraham where the promise was to come of
[1:07:27] the redeemer.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; And when he comes there he's able to
[1:07:33] present and say I have paid the price. I
[1:07:37] have loosened and taken care of the
[1:07:39] debt. and what was against them where
[1:07:42] they they followed me by the revelation
[1:07:44] of the blood of bulls and goats. But now
[1:07:48] waiting for that perfect lamb. I am that
[1:07:51] perfect lamb.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Do you understand what the authority of
[1:07:55] that word was in Jesus third pull
[1:07:58] ministry? It was to declare I am he. I
[1:08:01] have done the work. I am finished. He
[1:08:03] was to reveal himself as the mighty
[1:08:05] conqueror. the one who has taken care of
[1:08:08] the sin problem and the sin issue.
[1:08:13] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:08:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says it's to the eternal
[1:08:16] lost, but it's for the elect.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; The manifestation of this word is not to
[1:08:22] show everybody how wrong they are.
[1:08:24] That's not what he's saying in that
[1:08:26] statement. Others can see it, but they
[1:08:28] don't recognize who it is, what it is,
[1:08:31] and what we're called to.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; But I say, "Blessed are your ears that
[1:08:35] hear. Amen.
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes that see.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Not just to be a part of a church.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Not just to be a part. The message is
[1:08:44] not a movement.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The message is the voice of
[1:08:52] God coming straight from the throne. Get
[1:08:55] under the blood.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Because you're not safe in a church. The
[1:09:00] only place of safety is under the blood
[1:09:03] where the Holy Spirit has sealed you in.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; For such a high priest became us, who's
[1:09:16] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from
[1:09:20] sinners, made higher than the heavens,
[1:09:21] who needeth not daily as those high
[1:09:23] priests to offer up sacrifice first for
[1:09:26] his own sins, and then for the peoples.
[1:09:28] For this he did once when he offered up
[1:09:31] himself. He did not offer himself up
[1:09:34] because of his own sins.
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; Those priests made by a carnal
[1:09:39] commandment that of the law, they had to
[1:09:42] offer sacrifices because they were
[1:09:45] standing in need.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; That's why there's no holy man.
[1:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; There is no holy man. There's not this
[1:09:56] personal. There's no personality when
[1:09:58] when we stand in Revelations 5 and we
[1:10:00] see from Revelations 5, Paul pointing it
[1:10:03] out in Hebrews 12 that there's only one
[1:10:06] that that is to be seen and to be
[1:10:08] visible and to be known that in him is
[1:10:11] all that I have need of and that is
[1:10:14] worthy is the lamb.
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; That's what this message come to do. The
[1:10:20] message did not come to to bring us in
[1:10:23] and you know here we become you know oh
[1:10:25] so isolated. We're not isolated
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; by our own thinking.
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; That's what denominations are. I'm not
[1:10:34] throwing down. Remember there's good
[1:10:35] people in there but they isolate. Well,
[1:10:37] you can't fellowship with them because
[1:10:39] of this and and they believe this and
[1:10:40] you can't do this and you can't do that.
[1:10:42] I say God, God has raised the standard
[1:10:45] to where the bride is not walking in
[1:10:48] fear of denominational spirits, but the
[1:10:51] love of God is so pulsating in her heart
[1:10:54] because she knows who he is and what he
[1:10:56] has done. And she resists that dominate
[1:10:59] denominational spirit that would want to
[1:11:01] put walls and fences and barriers.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:11:10] And notice the scripture here,
[1:11:13] verse 28, for the law, I love this,
[1:11:16] maketh men high priests, which have
[1:11:19] infirmity, weaknesses, but the word of
[1:11:22] the oath which was since or before the
[1:11:25] law maketh a son who is consecrated
[1:11:29] forever more.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; So what what has made him the word for
[1:11:35] that's who he is? It was the word that
[1:11:38] was made flesh.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; And so when we're speaking of this, when
[1:11:42] Paul would write in Hebrews about the
[1:11:44] blood of Jesus and we speak about the
[1:11:47] blood being applied to your life,
[1:11:49] there's no way it could be. There was
[1:11:51] not enough literal blood to go around.
[1:11:54] But to understand that blood was shed
[1:11:56] because it was needed for the remission
[1:12:00] of sins and the life that was in that
[1:12:02] blood is what comes to draw upon the
[1:12:06] worshipper and bring us under the blood
[1:12:10] in fellowship.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; That is so good
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; because outside of the blood there is no
[1:12:14] fellowship.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So to be fully consecrated to the word
[1:12:23] by the spirit. This is why Paul would
[1:12:26] write even in Hebrews 10 that brethren
[1:12:29] we have boldness in verse 19 to enter
[1:12:32] into the holiest by the blood of Jesus.
[1:12:37] You know the one thing it wasn't Paul it
[1:12:40] was God moving through Paul. Because
[1:12:42] when the prophet stood in this age,
[1:12:45] remember when he was taking beyond the
[1:12:47] curtain of time and he's standing there,
[1:12:49] I want you to understand that wasn't
[1:12:51] just a light thing. When he stood there,
[1:12:53] he he stands there in that moment and
[1:12:56] and after it's even been echoed in his
[1:12:58] to him, it's going to take perfect love
[1:13:00] to get here. This is what you call
[1:13:02] perfect love. And remember, the prophet
[1:13:04] asked this question. He did not ask,
[1:13:07] will I have to give an account? Will
[1:13:09] Martin have to give an account? Will
[1:13:11] Luther have to give an account? Will
[1:13:13] Wesley have to give an account? Will
[1:13:15] Pentecost have to give an account? He
[1:13:17] asked the question, "Will Paul
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; be judged?"
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; That's very good.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Listen, you know why? Because every one
[1:13:28] of those I just named has other
[1:13:31] messengers are declared to be messengers
[1:13:34] or stars in the right hand of God
[1:13:37] because their ministry patterned Paul's
[1:13:41] ministry.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; It's a pattern. God doesn't leave us
[1:13:46] open and say, "Well, you know what? Just
[1:13:48] create a new pattern now. Just create a
[1:13:49] new pattern." That's where Listen, man
[1:13:52] does that when they're not brought in
[1:13:54] contact with the Holy Spirit. But the
[1:13:57] Holy Spirit does not leave us up to
[1:13:59] drawing our own patterns or what's
[1:14:02] acceptable. You and I cannot even
[1:14:04] conjure up or come up with what's
[1:14:06] acceptable. Listen to me now. The
[1:14:08] prophet in this age did not come up with
[1:14:11] what was acceptable. But God took a man
[1:14:14] who was ordained for this position and
[1:14:17] his eyes were open to see beyond
[1:14:19] emotion, see beyond church doctrine. He
[1:14:22] was lifted up into the heavenlies to
[1:14:25] behold Jesus
[1:14:27] [Music]
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; beyond denominational ideas
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; beyond the isms of man.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; I say who did that? The Holy Spirit.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; It was Christ himself that lifted up
[1:14:41] through that gift that he could see
[1:14:43] beyond traditions and isms. Well, what
[1:14:45] about so and so? What about what so and
[1:14:47] so said? What about what they said?
[1:14:52] If you're going to a book review, who
[1:14:54] you going to listen to? Somebody trying
[1:14:56] to interpret the book or the author?
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; If the author is there, you'll say, "I
[1:15:02] don't have time for this. I can go
[1:15:04] straight to the source to know what his
[1:15:07] thoughts were when he was writing this."
[1:15:11] And that's why Paul met the pillar of
[1:15:14] fire. And the pillar of fire was greater
[1:15:18] than any rabbitic tradition. It was
[1:15:20] greater than the phariseic knowledge. It
[1:15:23] was greater than any saddism. And what
[1:15:26] was it? The pillar of fire took Paul
[1:15:28] clear back to the mind of God.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; That's the same thing now in this
[1:15:40] generation.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire has returned. That's
[1:15:44] why we're not referring back to oh so
[1:15:46] and so. Oh, well so and so. The pillar
[1:15:48] fire has taken us back to the mind of
[1:15:51] God. Taken us back to the doctrines of
[1:15:55] the apostles and the prophets. Jesus
[1:15:57] Christ himself being the chief
[1:15:59] cornerstone. It bypass seminaries,
[1:16:02] bypass denominationalism.
[1:16:05] Why? You're not being called to be
[1:16:08] consecrated to become a a member of a
[1:16:11] church.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:16] That's why, well, I'm a message
[1:16:17] believer. What makes you a message
[1:16:19] believer?
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; Well, I have pictures.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; They have pictures in Washington, DC.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Others have pictures.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I have books. There's men who
[1:16:31] don't even want to stand for this word.
[1:16:33] They have these books.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; In their ministerial libraries.
[1:16:39] That's not only makes you a message
[1:16:41] believer, but what makes you a message
[1:16:43] believer is Christ himself declaring
[1:16:47] that you have received the message and
[1:16:50] the message has been made known in your
[1:16:53] heart by the Holy Spirit. It's the Holy
[1:16:56] Spirit that makes the difference in your
[1:16:58] life. It's not because I can talk the
[1:17:00] jargon, not because I can hit certain
[1:17:03] phrases, cliches, and make things and
[1:17:06] fit this in. That's not it at all.
[1:17:10] Oh, it's because I can tie this and tie
[1:17:11] that. Remember Judas, the prophet said,
[1:17:14] was a preacher second to none.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; The man had a ministry.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? Judas wasn't a fly by
[1:17:26] night. Judas wasn't somebody standing up
[1:17:28] and serving Campbell soup. This guy
[1:17:30] could preach. Yeah.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; That's why that even when Paul would
[1:17:36] write, "Though I can understand all
[1:17:38] mysteries."
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "Many will come to me on the
[1:17:41] day, did I not prophesy in thy name?"
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So notice when all of this is is
[1:17:52] is the Lord Jesus who is being exalted
[1:17:56] here.
[1:17:57] So when Paul would write of this even in
[1:18:00] Hebrews 1, in Hebrews chapter 1, it
[1:18:04] says, "God who in sunundry times and in
[1:18:06] diverse manners spake in times past unto
[1:18:09] the fathers by the prophets." So how did
[1:18:11] God speak to the fathers? By the
[1:18:14] prophets.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; And why did God send a prophet?
[1:18:19] God sends a prophet to call him back to
[1:18:22] the word.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand, brother
[1:18:26] Brandon says they had the law, but they
[1:18:30] didn't have the word of the Lord.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; What is the word of the Lord? It's God's
[1:18:36] minds, God's thoughts. It's the
[1:18:38] revelation of the spirit that comes to
[1:18:42] make this live.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; And bring the people into that place
[1:18:47] with the word that God has ordained it
[1:18:49] to be.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Samuel, what are you
[1:18:53] saying? I'm saying when the word of the
[1:18:55] Lord has come through and by the
[1:18:57] prophet, it overrides reasoning.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. It sure does.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; You're not serving God by reasoning.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; If you're serving God by reasoning, it's
[1:19:07] dangerous, friends.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; That's to be outside of the veil.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm a pretty good guy. Hey, the
[1:19:12] rich young ruler was a real good guy.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; He stood right in the presence of the
[1:19:17] word himself, and the word himself
[1:19:18] couldn't even put a finger on his life.
[1:19:21] He said, "I've kept every one of those
[1:19:22] ten commandments."
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; But he lacked something.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? It's more than just,
[1:19:30] well, I have this down. I have that. But
[1:19:31] it's got to it's got to come to a place,
[1:19:33] you know what? At least that young man,
[1:19:35] he was honest enough to admit, I'm
[1:19:38] lacking something. What I need is
[1:19:40] eternal life. I need something to make
[1:19:43] this word live inside of my life. Amen.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; But when the word came to honor
[1:19:52] his honesty
[1:19:54] and touched
[1:19:56] his life,
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; it was too much.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; It's too much.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; I have to cut this. Oh, I have to get
[1:20:07] rid of this. The Bible said he walked
[1:20:10] away
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; sorrowfully
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; because he had great possessions.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; I say this to you. I wonder how much his
[1:20:19] possessions meant when the Bible says he
[1:20:21] lifted up his eyes in hell.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Cuz you know what? You can't take any
[1:20:25] possession with you.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friend. Hell
[1:20:31] is a real place.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; It was It was made for the devil and his
[1:20:37] angels. It was not made for any any
[1:20:40] human being.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; You say, "Why will human beings be
[1:20:44] there?" Because they've rejected
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; We don't choose what parts of him you
[1:20:53] can. What parts you want to receive.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:56] &gt;&gt; It's like a person that gets married
[1:20:57] simply because the man's got a good
[1:20:59] paying job.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; That's false.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; You didn't marry him. You married his
[1:21:05] money.
[1:21:07] Are you hearing me? Well, well, I love
[1:21:09] the Lord Jesus. But what what do you
[1:21:10] love about him? Because if you don't
[1:21:12] love his word, if his word is, well, I
[1:21:14] you don't need him. We don't need to do
[1:21:15] this or we don't need to do that. Then
[1:21:17] something about it, you're wanting to be
[1:21:19] married to him and even to claim that,
[1:21:21] but yet not really wanting him, but
[1:21:24] wanting some of his attributes. Oh, I
[1:21:26] want his grace. I want his mercy. But do
[1:21:29] you want him?
[1:21:32] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be tied down.
[1:21:39] I don't want I don't want to be having
[1:21:42] children and where the word bringing
[1:21:44] forth in my life and separating me from
[1:21:46] who I am and and I don't want that kind
[1:21:48] of a life. I want to be free.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; It depends on what your definition of
[1:21:53] free is.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; I'm as free as I can be this morning.
[1:22:01] Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; But I can tell you, I was a man prior to
[1:22:05] June of 1995, there was a man that was
[1:22:07] bound.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; Could not get free. Tried, but could not
[1:22:14] get free on my own. But when he came,
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; I've never been ashamed.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; I say that because of him. I'm not
[1:22:29] ashamed of him. How could I be ashamed
[1:22:32] of him for what he has done for me?
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; You know, Jesus said, "If you're ashamed
[1:22:39] of the Son of Man and his words in this
[1:22:43] generation, he'll be ashamed of you."
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it doesn't cost you
[1:22:52] anything. Even as young people, it
[1:22:54] doesn't cost you anything. you you'll
[1:22:55] not get you'll not get you'll not get
[1:22:56] anything thrown at you any tomatoes when
[1:22:58] they ask you where do you go to church
[1:23:00] if you said I'm a Baptist or I'm a this
[1:23:03] okay they they know that
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; but when you say well we follow the
[1:23:10] revealed word of the hour
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; and God has sent a prophet in this hour
[1:23:15] uhoh now
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; you're getting off your rocker
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; you know what's happening you're now
[1:23:21] being faced with an with with a put will
[1:23:24] Do you bear the reproach from this word?
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:23:29] &gt;&gt; You see the what it is is that it's
[1:23:31] comfortable to be identified with dead
[1:23:34] religion, but when it comes down to the
[1:23:37] living God, that's where it gets
[1:23:39] uncomfortable.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Thou being a man maketh thyself God.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; The Pharisees were comfortable in their
[1:23:47] religion. And the prophet said they
[1:23:50] didn't know the God of Moses. They only
[1:23:52] knew the history of the God of Moses.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, it's got to be more
[1:23:57] than knowing the history of the God that
[1:23:59] worked in William Brandham. But the same
[1:24:02] God that worked in William Brham is the
[1:24:04] same God that wants to work inside of
[1:24:07] your life.
[1:24:09] [Applause]
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Don't make this message.
[1:24:13] [Applause]
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Well, we're going to get somewhere here.
[1:24:21] In Hebrews 1 at sunra spake unto the
[1:24:26] fathers through the prophets hath in
[1:24:28] these last days spoken unto us by his
[1:24:32] son whom he hath appointed heir of all
[1:24:35] things by whom also he made the worlds.
[1:24:38] You could go on and read that when he
[1:24:39] says by his son listen the body has
[1:24:43] already went on
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; but his son that pillar of fire is still
[1:24:48] here. Hallelujah.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? Because it was not
[1:24:52] the flesh body that created the worlds.
[1:24:55] Ephesians chapter 2, who created all
[1:24:58] things by Jesus Christ. Who is Jesus
[1:25:01] Christ? The word. Who is his son? The
[1:25:03] word.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Right? John picks that up. When we're
[1:25:07] talking about the Son, we're talking
[1:25:09] about the word. When we're talking about
[1:25:10] the word, we're talking about God. We're
[1:25:13] talking about the spirit.
[1:25:15] [Applause]
[1:25:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The body there, the body has
[1:25:20] been raised up. But who is it that came
[1:25:23] and gathered the disciples and imparted
[1:25:26] himself on the day of Pentecost? It was
[1:25:28] the son of God,
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit, their inheritance being
[1:25:34] dispersed to their life. The coming of
[1:25:36] the Holy Spirit falling on this one, on
[1:25:38] that one, on this one, on that one,
[1:25:40] quickening them
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; into the body.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; And he's speaking through your life.
[1:25:48] He's still speaking. And you know what?
[1:25:50] He's not speaking a new message.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; This message that God sent to you and I,
[1:25:56] it's not a new message.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; It's a restoration message.
[1:26:01] [Music]
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; Some of you that go to some of these car
[1:26:05] shows, you know this well enough. Some
[1:26:07] of you could look at this car and think,
[1:26:08] "Wow, they used to have it at Osborne
[1:26:10] Park in Sunduski. Wow. Ain't that ain't
[1:26:12] that really nice? Open that Ford. Show
[1:26:15] me what kind of an engine. Well, what is
[1:26:18] it? It's a Chevy engine.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; That's not a restoration. A restoration
[1:26:24] is restore it back to its original with
[1:26:28] every original part, including even the
[1:26:31] doorork knobs.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; God has not left this up to man to patch
[1:26:39] this and patch that and patch this and
[1:26:41] patch that. The bride is not a patchwork
[1:26:45] a bride. She is a bride that is made up
[1:26:49] with the elements that went out of his
[1:26:50] side. The blood, the water, and the
[1:26:53] spirit. She is a bride that is made up
[1:26:56] word on top of word on top of word on
[1:26:59] top of word.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; That's so good.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Well, they don't have this certain part
[1:27:05] down at the part store. Well, let's find
[1:27:07] somebody who does.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; That's so good. Maybe you've got to go
[1:27:12] to somebody's junkard, what they
[1:27:14] classified as junk.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; We don't need this oddlooking stone.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; We don't need this cornerstone. Who put
[1:27:23] that oddlooking stone in here? But you
[1:27:25] what you find down there in that
[1:27:27] junkyard, you find something that is
[1:27:29] precious and it fits back in with the
[1:27:32] restoration. It's not what man calls
[1:27:35] foolish. What man calls great, God said
[1:27:38] it's foolish. Amen.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; My I haven't even got beyond the title
[1:27:47] slide here.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; This is why Paul would write, "We've
[1:27:55] been called to Mount Zion."
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; A blood that speaks better things. This
[1:28:04] blood is speaking. What What is it
[1:28:06] that's speaking? the chemicals, all of
[1:28:09] that that comprised of his blood. God
[1:28:11] created
[1:28:12] that blood. That blood went back down in
[1:28:15] the ground. But the life that was in
[1:28:17] that blood, God's own life,
[1:28:21] that life has become the blood.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And it is the life that is calling out
[1:28:27] to you and I. Don't stay away.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; There's fellowship.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; There's reconciliation.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:35] Now when we come into this here of being
[1:28:38] fully consecrated to the word, I want
[1:28:40] you to see how that within it.
[1:28:44] Remember when Jesus came to Nicodemus,
[1:28:46] he said, let me just refer to this,
[1:28:48] except a man be born of the water and of
[1:28:51] the spirit. He can in no wise enter. So
[1:28:55] there's a way to enter into fellowship
[1:28:58] with God. The water by the word,
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:03] coming by the word, it'll lead us in
[1:29:06] into that into water baptism. The water
[1:29:08] being the word,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; See the now and the spirit. So, no way
[1:29:13] to enter in, but by the word and the
[1:29:16] spirit. So, not just the spirit because
[1:29:20] listen now, I can't get all the way into
[1:29:23] this here this morning, but you can read
[1:29:26] Leviticus 8 when you you get home.
[1:29:29] The priests were not anointed. And I'm
[1:29:31] talking about Aaron's sons until the
[1:29:34] blood had been applied.
[1:29:36] The anointing did not go upon them until
[1:29:39] the blood was applied. This is why the
[1:29:42] spirit of God only comes to a heart
[1:29:45] that's taking that word.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; See, it's not something, oh, it's just
[1:29:51] an osmosis. It's just, no, no. God has a
[1:29:53] provided way. If we come to we come unto
[1:29:55] God by him. So to take to take that
[1:29:57] word, the Holy Spirit cannot come until
[1:30:00] the word's been applied. But let me just
[1:30:01] say this to you. The word can be applied
[1:30:03] so quickly, so simply. The prophet even
[1:30:06] says it like this. He says, "God can
[1:30:08] come right in this service while the
[1:30:09] word's being preached and a person can
[1:30:11] move right through justification,
[1:30:13] sanctification, and baptism of the Holy
[1:30:14] Ghost just like that."
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? So, we're not trying
[1:30:19] to set up a timeline. We're just all of
[1:30:21] this that we read in our text. It all is
[1:30:24] speaking of Jesus Christ.
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So now as as he would
[1:30:32] bring them here and let me just try to
[1:30:34] move into this place coming coming to
[1:30:38] this this part of it that when the
[1:30:40] priests were brought here um let me
[1:30:43] refer back pull this up again when God
[1:30:46] spoke to Moses of what to say to Aaron
[1:30:50] everything that was brought the garments
[1:30:53] Aaron didn't make his own garments
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; God made them and they were made by the
[1:30:58] wisdom of God. Yeah,
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; those garments would reflect God, would
[1:31:03] reflect his nature,
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; would reflect his humility, would
[1:31:08] reflect his righteousness.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; So, it wasn't Aaron bringing to God what
[1:31:14] he thought was necessary.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; God has given this declaration through
[1:31:22] Moses to tell Aaron and his sons. God
[1:31:25] said in Numbers three, I'm going to take
[1:31:27] all of the the tribe of Levi unto myself
[1:31:31] rather than the firstborn of the
[1:31:34] children of Israel. They they'll redeem
[1:31:35] it, but I've brought all that of Levi
[1:31:38] unto me. God speaking of how that he
[1:31:41] would take even unto himself, even from
[1:31:44] among the peoples, an elect
[1:31:47] predestinated
[1:31:48] royal priesthood, a chosen generation,
[1:31:51] and God would bring us to himself for
[1:31:53] what purpose? to serve his will.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; That's right. Right.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to think of this here. These
[1:32:04] priests when Aaron and his sons came,
[1:32:08] they did not nor did they have the
[1:32:11] ability to consecrate themselves.
[1:32:15] Just listen to me for a few moments.
[1:32:18] It was done by another.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:32:24] Moses was standing in thestead of God.
[1:32:28] But Moses was not standing there as
[1:32:31] though it was Moses consecrating him. It
[1:32:34] was the word of the Lord that Moses had
[1:32:37] surrendered himself to. So it was the
[1:32:41] word coming through the prophet that
[1:32:44] would actually initiate and bring them
[1:32:47] through and into consecration.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's good.
[1:32:55] He was God's representative. So all this
[1:32:57] speaks of the redeeming work of Christ
[1:32:59] from the sacrifice, the clothing to the
[1:33:02] anointing oil that sat on the priest in
[1:33:05] the service because to worship blood was
[1:33:09] required through a sacrifice to enter.
[1:33:10] You you can't worship without there
[1:33:12] being a sacrifice.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? God set said set all
[1:33:18] the requirements and he would be the one
[1:33:20] that would ultimately fulfill them.
[1:33:22] Jesus would say no man come unto the
[1:33:25] father but by me.
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; Right? He would say I am the door of the
[1:33:30] sheepfold.
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; If any man enter by me,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; he shall go in and out and find pasture.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "I am the way, the
[1:33:41] truth, and the life."
[1:33:45] Jesus was revealing who he was. He was
[1:33:49] and he still is the I am that I am.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Is that right?
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; No man can come unto the father unless
[1:33:59] come unto me unless the father draw him.
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:03] Yes, sir.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; You see, even in all of this right here,
[1:34:07] to have that that that that beauty that
[1:34:11] stands out before us, I think of where
[1:34:13] my dad would, you know, my dad, I would
[1:34:15] be sitting on the the couch and this is,
[1:34:17] you know, I was going through some real
[1:34:18] rough times in my life and uh so forth
[1:34:21] and just, you know, it's just so
[1:34:23] intertwined with the things of the world
[1:34:25] and things, you know, as just a young
[1:34:27] man and 17, 18 years old and so forth.
[1:34:30] And I remember him looking at me, you
[1:34:31] know, and no doubt I don't know how many
[1:34:33] sleepless nights and how he cried him
[1:34:35] and my mom and all those other things
[1:34:37] cuz you never want to see your your your
[1:34:39] child just being just taken away seemed
[1:34:41] like and and through the through the the
[1:34:43] confines of life and and so forth. And
[1:34:46] he would look at me and he said, "Son,"
[1:34:48] he said, "Do you believe this message?"
[1:34:50] I said, "Dad, absolutely I believe this
[1:34:52] message." And he would he would lower
[1:34:54] his head and he said, "No, you don't.
[1:34:57] because if you did, you would live it.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; That boy, you know what? I knew what he
[1:35:04] was saying. I knew he wasn't putting me
[1:35:06] down, but I knew what he was pointing
[1:35:08] out is that when you say you believe
[1:35:10] something, it won't just something come
[1:35:12] from here. It'll come out of here.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; That's the truth.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; You understand me? That's why the
[1:35:18] prophet in unveiling of God, he says
[1:35:20] it's got to be more than just something
[1:35:22] we say we believe it, but it's got to be
[1:35:24] Christ identified in us. And you know
[1:35:28] what? When you believe it, unbelief
[1:35:30] flees from your life.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Hey, Bri, you need you need things the
[1:35:37] way God works to get lives cleaned up.
[1:35:39] But don't just focus on little things
[1:35:41] here or there. You focus on him. He's
[1:35:44] the one that'll take care and clean the
[1:35:46] things up and direct you in your life
[1:35:49] and give you the power that'll break
[1:35:51] every spirit.
[1:35:53] &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you, fashions are not
[1:35:55] just something. They're devils.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Habits are spirits.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends. I'm not throwing off
[1:36:03] on anybody. I'm telling you, you got to
[1:36:05] call it for what it is. That's why you
[1:36:07] when you can't get free of something,
[1:36:08] it's a spirit.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; We don't need flesh and blood.
[1:36:14] Flesh and blood cannot take care of it.
[1:36:16] A spirit must be cast out.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; And the preaching of the word is here to
[1:36:23] bind the Satan.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; What's tormenting the mind, tormenting
[1:36:28] the life, hindering and wanting to keep
[1:36:30] a hold and oppressing and tormenting.
[1:36:32] But the gospel is the good news to say
[1:36:35] you are free.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; But you've got to act on it. Amen.
[1:36:41] &gt;&gt; You've got to want to be free.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; To be fully consecrated to the word by
[1:36:53] the spirit.
[1:36:55] Consecration is an action. It's an
[1:36:57] action. This word, it's an action of
[1:36:59] making something sacred.
[1:37:02] Ordaining someone or to consecrate is to
[1:37:05] ordain someone to a certain office.
[1:37:08] Now, I want to just pick this up here.
[1:37:11] The Bible says that Moses brought Aaron
[1:37:15] and his sons and he washed them.
[1:37:20] I want you to just stay with me here
[1:37:22] just a moment. He washed them.
[1:37:26] And when Moses as he came and he brought
[1:37:29] Aaron and his sons,
[1:37:34] all of the congregation,
[1:37:37] all of Israel is beholding this
[1:37:42] before the door of the tabernacle.
[1:37:46] So what what's being done is before they
[1:37:50] can ever enter in even into the
[1:37:53] tabernacle, before they can even enter
[1:37:55] in, it all starts. This is part of the
[1:37:58] entering in is submitting to the word.
[1:38:02] Amen.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; See, God's laying down a a type of what
[1:38:09] will be fulfilled as the Holy Spirit has
[1:38:13] been poured out in redemption.
[1:38:18] This whole chapter, friends, speaks and
[1:38:19] brings us clear through the clear
[1:38:20] through the church ages. But I want to
[1:38:22] just deal with this part here in verse
[1:38:24] six. And he washed them with water.
[1:38:28] And notice when he he washed them with
[1:38:31] water, God spoke this. But I want you to
[1:38:35] hear I want you to listen to me. It
[1:38:37] would require Aaron and his sons to be
[1:38:41] able to hear personally what God had
[1:38:45] spoke to Moses.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Because secondhanded revelation will
[1:38:50] never bring submission.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Because revelation deals with the heart.
[1:38:56] You see, it's why you try to when I'm
[1:38:58] trying to talk somebody in and I I I
[1:39:00] know that many times as we we work and
[1:39:02] you labor and we work to disciple and we
[1:39:04] should but to always remember this that
[1:39:07] it is not by words that we're going to
[1:39:10] persuade people.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; It's not by words that you'll get them
[1:39:14] into position.
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; There's good things with Bible studies
[1:39:20] and all that and I I've done that. I
[1:39:22] believe in that. But I want you to
[1:39:23] understand it's a condition of the
[1:39:25] heart. The heart, the Bible says, he
[1:39:28] that hath an ear, let him hear.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Not somebody else and tell him what he
[1:39:34] heard.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; But God through a prophet in this age,
[1:39:38] he told you as as Moses was telling
[1:39:42] Aaron and his sons, this is what's to
[1:39:44] this is what's to be. And he brought all
[1:39:47] that was needed there to consecrate
[1:39:50] them. You know what Aaron and his sons
[1:39:52] had to do? They had to believe it.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; And to simply, as Paul says in Romans
[1:40:01] 12, to simply present themselves there
[1:40:05] before the before Moses. Moses
[1:40:09] representing the word. Is everybody with
[1:40:11] me?
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Moses, I'm not talking about a man where
[1:40:15] a man is washing you in. Well, let's see
[1:40:17] if you'll fit our doctrine. Let's see if
[1:40:19] you'll fit our thinking. This is not
[1:40:20] this word is not a man-handled word.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; God never come to make a bunch of
[1:40:28] branomites.
[1:40:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:31] &gt;&gt; Thunderites or whatever more,
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Peruites or thisite or this or this or
[1:40:39] thisite.
[1:40:40] Those itites happen
[1:40:43] when Satan gets in there.
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; Satan's eating. The prophet says that he
[1:40:49] says Satan is interested in establishing
[1:40:52] his own image in the people.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; But the real ministering of the word by
[1:40:59] Jesus Christ through a faithful minister
[1:41:02] is not that you become little Samuels. I
[1:41:04] don't want you to be little Samuels.
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; I want you to be real Christians. Amen.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Bloodbought, word solid, spiritfilled,
[1:41:15] walking with the seal of the living God
[1:41:17] upon your life. Little
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; Messiah.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:23] &gt;&gt; If you're only known by this church,
[1:41:24] you're living beneath your privileges.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; You can't hide, friends, behind a title.
[1:41:32] You can't hide behind a ministry. You
[1:41:34] can't hide behind pictures.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why the Holy
[1:41:40] Spirit searching us out. He's not here
[1:41:42] to condemn. He's here to draw us out.
[1:41:44] Come out here where I can wash you.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; From what? Yourself.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Wash you from all your thinking. Wash
[1:41:56] you from all your previous ideas. Wash
[1:41:59] you from behold of sin upon your life.
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; How are we washed?
[1:42:07] by the washing of water
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; by the word.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; They come here and Moses happened to
[1:42:20] watch this. Listen to me. This is why
[1:42:23] it's very important. And I'm going to
[1:42:26] just say some things here.
[1:42:29] You might say, "Brother Sammy, this is
[1:42:30] your own personal belief maybe." So,
[1:42:35] but I don't believe someone steps out of
[1:42:37] preaching in a Baptist pullpit and
[1:42:39] starts preaching in a message pullpit
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; because they may not even be called to
[1:42:44] do that.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You say, "What has
[1:42:49] to be made?" Got to be made a search for
[1:42:50] qualifications first of all.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; But the other part of it is they may not
[1:42:55] be ordained for that.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; But let's just say they are. What's
[1:42:58] important is is that set in the word
[1:43:02] until you and the word have become one
[1:43:04] and it's washed you.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Listen friends, he's still changing us.
[1:43:08] But no man should stand up here unless
[1:43:10] he's met God face to face. And he knows
[1:43:13] where he's standing because the message
[1:43:15] of the hour will always elevate Jesus
[1:43:18] Christ.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour never came to
[1:43:22] mix Pentecostalism. No.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; It never came to mix church of
[1:43:27] Christism.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; It never came to me mix baptism.
[1:43:33] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is the pure
[1:43:38] unadulterated word of God by divine
[1:43:41] interpretation.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; It's the word that God promised in this
[1:43:46] hour cuz there's a bride
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; to be dressed in resurrection garments.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; And before she can have on those
[1:43:54] resurrection garments, she's got to be
[1:43:57] washed.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; That's why this message, I want you to
[1:44:04] think now. Don't let it be disjointed.
[1:44:06] Think about the scriptures I've just
[1:44:08] touched with you in Hebrews.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Who is this? This pillar of fire, the
[1:44:13] blood of Jesus, the spirit of God, the
[1:44:16] son of God, the Holy Spirit. It's God.
[1:44:19] God's own life. Who is this Melzdc? Who
[1:44:21] is this that has come down?
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; Who is this that's washing you and I?
[1:44:28] Who is this that's separating you,
[1:44:30] separating us? It's not us. Listen, I
[1:44:32] believe that we make declarations and
[1:44:34] when God deals with your heart, you
[1:44:36] should separate from unbelief. Well, I'm
[1:44:37] just going to wait till God takes it out
[1:44:39] of my heart. He's trying to
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Amen.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Don't be lazy.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; Good. I'm I'm standing on your word. I
[1:44:46] no longer want this in my life. Whether
[1:44:48] it's makeup, whether it's fashion,
[1:44:50] whether it's less, whatever it is, I no
[1:44:52] longer want this in my life. You're
[1:44:54] taking your stand with the word.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; And you watch the Holy Spirit. He's the
[1:45:00] amen to the word.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm still battling with this. It's
[1:45:06] not his fault.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; I'm not saying that to put anybody down.
[1:45:09] You understand what I'm saying? I know
[1:45:10] it's going to get hot and thick. We
[1:45:12] maybe need to buckle up for just a
[1:45:13] moment. But I'm trying to let you know
[1:45:15] you're not helpless.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; If God be for us, who can be against us?
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; I mean, here, what if Moses, he lets us
[1:45:29] be known? And let's say, let's say
[1:45:32] here's the door. They're to come to the
[1:45:35] door. Who's the door? The word.
[1:45:39] Maybe Aaron and them come there and they
[1:45:40] look his sons.
[1:45:43] My man, that's that's some nice water
[1:45:46] you got there.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; That's some good water.
[1:45:51] It doesn't matter how it does not matter
[1:45:53] how much Aaron and his sons could talk
[1:45:55] about the water.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; You know who made that water possible?
[1:46:01] Let's move ahead to the antitype, the
[1:46:03] Lord Jesus Christ. You know who made it
[1:46:06] pos possible that you and I could be
[1:46:08] washed thoroughly cleansed? The Lord
[1:46:10] Jesus Christ.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; It wasn't good enough just to look at it
[1:46:13] and think, "Wow, that's wonderful. Wow,
[1:46:15] that's beautiful. My, that's nice." It
[1:46:17] was meant to get into,
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Like the man who was bound with the
[1:46:23] infirmity. He couldn't get to the water,
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; but the one who sent the angel
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; came to him.
[1:46:30] &gt;&gt; He brought the virtue of the water to
[1:46:31] him.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yes.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; So here, Aaron and his son. But you know
[1:46:36] what? Listen to me now.
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; Before they could be washed,
[1:46:44] they had to be stripped.
[1:46:46] There's nobody in here takes a bath
[1:46:49] wearing, you know, go into bath with
[1:46:51] your clothes on.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; You got to be stripped.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm using words, you know, I'm
[1:46:56] using right down the scripture and
[1:46:58] message terminology.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; The prophet brings it on down and he
[1:47:02] brings us in in this. I want you to
[1:47:04] listen this. He said, notice the
[1:47:06] dressing of this high priest before he
[1:47:08] could enter the veil. He had to be
[1:47:10] stripped and dressed right to go in.
[1:47:13] That's what the church today needs is a
[1:47:16] stripping off of all these little cults
[1:47:18] and things and dressed in the
[1:47:20] righteousness of Jesus Christ and ready
[1:47:23] to enter in. That's the same for every
[1:47:25] priest, every son and daughter of God.
[1:47:28] We must be stripped.
[1:47:32] Right?
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Now, let me just tell you something.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; Moses was a gentleman. The word is a
[1:47:37] gentleman.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't sit there and rip their
[1:47:40] clothes off of them.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; But you know what happened? Faith cometh
[1:47:46] by hearing.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; They had to have faith in the word that
[1:47:51] they were hearing that this word itself
[1:47:53] and what it was calling them to as
[1:47:56] waters of separation to separate from
[1:47:58] unbelief.
[1:48:00] and they had to be willing to stand
[1:48:01] there and be stripped
[1:48:05] in order to be washed.
[1:48:08] Now, let me just let me give you a few
[1:48:09] examples here. Moses,
[1:48:13] here he comes.
[1:48:16] He has he's he has so much theology, so
[1:48:20] much ambition. My what a what a
[1:48:22] wonderful young man.
[1:48:24] Listen friends, the young people this
[1:48:26] message wonderful.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:48:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not just saying that. I mean that.
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Well, sure. Well, you don't
[1:48:34] you don't know this. You don't know
[1:48:35] that. Well, I I I just choose not to
[1:48:37] look at the hinder parts.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Sorry. I'm not up on the mountain with
[1:48:40] Balam. I'm down in the camp with the
[1:48:42] pillar of fire.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Don't mean to be sarcastic, but Paul was
[1:48:46] sometimes.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; You see, it just depends on where you're
[1:48:49] at. If you're up there seeing
[1:48:51] everybody's faults, come away from
[1:48:53] Balum.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Come away from Balum. Balamism is
[1:48:58] trouble.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; The doctrine of Balum is trouble.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; You got to get down in the camp where
[1:49:06] the pillar of fire and there is a power
[1:49:09] in order to cover sin and deal with sin.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? That's why even as a
[1:49:17] congregation, we're not sitting here
[1:49:19] ignorant that there's not problems and
[1:49:21] issues here. But you've got to be locked
[1:49:23] in to know there is one that is here
[1:49:26] among us that's able to deal and settle
[1:49:29] every situation.
[1:49:31] [Applause]
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You've got to be settled on that. Look
[1:49:34] unto Jesus.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; You need help with your young person.
[1:49:39] You need help my home. I need help here.
[1:49:41] I need help here. Look to Jesus.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Oh God, I pray that's who has set before
[1:49:49] us.
[1:49:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here is Moses and God said, "Take
[1:49:55] off your shoes.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; I don't even want anything between your
[1:49:58] feet and the ground." The prophet said,
[1:50:00] "I want your feet on the ground."
[1:50:03] &gt;&gt; He had to strip down.
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; You know, Moses was being stripped of
[1:50:07] his theology.
[1:50:10] &gt;&gt; Those 40 years, his ambition was being
[1:50:12] stripped from him.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; God allowed all that time walking
[1:50:16] around, walking around, walking around.
[1:50:18] Right?
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something, friends. Let
[1:50:21] me say this to you. God won't fight with
[1:50:23] nobody.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; God won't fight with nobody.
[1:50:30] He waits till you finally get tired of
[1:50:33] trying to do it yourself.
[1:50:36] &gt;&gt; And when you get tired of doing it
[1:50:37] yourself, he'll say, "I've been here the
[1:50:40] whole time.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; I've been watching over you the whole
[1:50:45] time.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to let nothing touch your
[1:50:47] life. Nothing can pluck you out of my
[1:50:49] hand. But just because you're written in
[1:50:50] my hand doesn't mean you can bypass the
[1:50:53] process. You still got to be washed by
[1:50:56] the word. And it's because you are an
[1:50:58] elected of God. You will long to be
[1:51:01] washed by the water of the word.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Cuz the rest of churches and everything
[1:51:07] else, I don't need to do that.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; That's not necessary.
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; Oh, God looks on the heart. He does.
[1:51:14] Yeah.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; And whatever's in the heart will come
[1:51:17] out.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; Moses had to be stripped of his own
[1:51:29] ideas.
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; He had to be loosened. And let me just
[1:51:34] say this. The Bible tells us in Hebrews
[1:51:37] 4:12, everybody all right? that the word
[1:51:41] of God is sharper, more powerful than
[1:51:44] any sharp two-edged sword. It it it
[1:51:48] cutting us under, dividing them bone
[1:51:50] from the moral,
[1:51:52] and we stand naked before him.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; There is no, in other words, there's
[1:52:01] nothing hidden from him.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:52:05] &gt;&gt; Do you understand when the word is
[1:52:07] revealing and what we're seeing in our
[1:52:10] own lives, you don't want to just walk
[1:52:12] out of here and think and reason away.
[1:52:14] Don't allow the enemy to reason away.
[1:52:16] But everyone should come to such an
[1:52:18] effectual part in your life. God, I want
[1:52:20] to be more like you. My my life has been
[1:52:23] searched. I don't want to just look in
[1:52:25] the mirror and walk away and be talked
[1:52:27] out of it.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:34] Hallelujah. Moses had to be stripped. He
[1:52:37] had to get to a place to where he had no
[1:52:39] ability that he could rely on. You know,
[1:52:41] Joseph, Joseph had to be stripped.
[1:52:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, you might say, "Well,
[1:52:47] Joseph, he he was perfection." That's
[1:52:50] true. That type stays where it's at
[1:52:52] until we get off of it.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; All right? You got to know when to get
[1:52:55] on and get off,
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; right? But the prophet tells us that
[1:52:59] Joseph felt like he was a great guy.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; See what it was. He could say, "Oh, no.
[1:53:04] I don't feel that way." But he was
[1:53:05] letting it linger. And God saw him
[1:53:08] entertaining that. He saw where that was
[1:53:10] at. He felt like he was a great guy. And
[1:53:13] God allowed him to get to a place, the
[1:53:15] prophet said, until he seen himself as
[1:53:17] nothing but a total failure.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; And when he said he got to that place
[1:53:20] and brother Bam stands out and says,
[1:53:22] "Glory, a total failure."
[1:53:25] Amen.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Then the remembrance came.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; To the man who had held the cup whose
[1:53:33] dream had been interpreted by Joseph.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; His failed me, king. This has just come
[1:53:38] back. You know why? It was his time.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; See, God has everything in time. It
[1:53:43] wasn't like God was just waiting around.
[1:53:44] Come on. Come on. The wine. The wine
[1:53:46] guy. Come on. Come on. Come on. God was
[1:53:48] working on Joseph. God works on both
[1:53:51] ends. Yes.
[1:53:55] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? God works on both
[1:53:57] ends.
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:53:58] &gt;&gt; And when Joseph was was ready,
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; that's right.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; He comes out of the dungeon, it's made
[1:54:06] known.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; He shaves himself. He's washed and he
[1:54:09] puts on different garments. Why? He's
[1:54:11] getting ready to go before
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; Pharaoh. That's right.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; See, the washing and the changing,
[1:54:16] getting ready to go before someone, it's
[1:54:17] part of the approach. Same thing with
[1:54:19] Ruth. When God spoke through Naomi to
[1:54:22] Ruth,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; remember she told Ruth, "Before you go
[1:54:25] down to the boyas, wash yourself.
[1:54:28] &gt;&gt; Get all that stuff off your face.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; Get all that stuff out of your life."
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:54:34] &gt;&gt; Come on, friends.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; Clean up and put raignment on and go
[1:54:40] down to the foot of the cross.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, does Paul, where was
[1:54:46] Paul? Paul was coming. Paul had
[1:54:49] everything down, man. He was a Pharisee
[1:54:52] of the Pharisees. He had everything
[1:54:54] right down to the line. He Paul could
[1:54:56] set it all out there, been taught by
[1:54:58] Gilia, and yet he was persecuting,
[1:55:02] standing against the very one
[1:55:06] that he had read about,
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; right,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; he could quote scriptures about,
[1:55:12] but because his eyes were not opened.
[1:55:16] But there on that road to Damascus when
[1:55:18] his eyes became opened,
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; let me tell you what opened his eyes.
[1:55:23] That pillar of fire, God coming down,
[1:55:26] Paul was on a mission
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; to arrest and persecute more to the
[1:55:32] death.
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; But God intervened.
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; And when God intervened in Paul's life,
[1:55:40] Paul at that moment, and I quoted it to
[1:55:42] you at the beginning, who art thou,
[1:55:43] Lord? He said, "I'm Jesus whom thou
[1:55:46] persecutest."
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; What happened to Paul? Paul was willing,
[1:55:50] now watch when this revelation struck
[1:55:53] Paul's heart.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Paul was willing to turn loose of where
[1:55:58] he had been tied to.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "What would you have me do? Go
[1:56:03] into a street called Straight
[1:56:06] &gt;&gt; and it'll be told you what to do from
[1:56:08] there."
[1:56:09] &gt;&gt; His eyes scaled over. And God has a man
[1:56:12] by the name of Ananas. Yes.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; And he tells Ananas, "Go lay your hands
[1:56:16] on him
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; that his eyes be healed.
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; They be opened, right?"
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; And that he received the Holy Ghost.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; See, that moment where he met the where
[1:56:28] he saw the pillar of fire, that was not
[1:56:30] when Paul was filled with the Holy
[1:56:32] Spirit.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; That's when it became absolute. That's
[1:56:37] when it became pearl of great price.
[1:56:39] He's willing to sell everything and
[1:56:41] become yolked to this. See, God reveals
[1:56:44] himself. God makes himself known. And
[1:56:47] that's why blessed are your eyes.
[1:56:48] Blessed are your ears that hear. And
[1:56:50] when you can see, hey, he's worth it
[1:56:52] all.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:53] &gt;&gt; When you can see it's him and you're
[1:56:55] willing to let go, it's not God taking
[1:56:57] this and God ripping this and God
[1:56:59] ripping this and God ripping this and
[1:57:01] God's ripping this out and God's ripping
[1:57:03] this out.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:57:04] &gt;&gt; God's not a monster.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; It's not him ripping anything out. All
[1:57:10] right.
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; It's where him revealing himself.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; And as you recognize him, it loosens.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:19] &gt;&gt; There's a loosening. There's a
[1:57:21] confidence. Listen to me. That comes
[1:57:23] through the washing of water by the
[1:57:25] word. It washes your conscience.
[1:57:28] &gt;&gt; It comes to It comes to to separate you.
[1:57:32] It comes to draw you unto himself. It
[1:57:35] comes to loosen. And you know what? It's
[1:57:37] not a fight. It's a letting go.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; It's a letting go. Now,
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; I know we always want to we always want
[1:57:45] to come back to the Jacob wrestling, and
[1:57:48] that's true. But who was Jacob really
[1:57:49] wrestling with? Well, he was wrestling
[1:57:51] with the angel of the Lord. No, no, no.
[1:57:53] Think deeper. Who was he really
[1:57:54] wrestling with?
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; Himself.
[1:57:58] &gt;&gt; Himself.
[1:58:00] That's what it is. And when Jacob got
[1:58:02] tired of being Jacob, that's when
[1:58:03] victory came. That's right.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; God leads us to a place to where we're
[1:58:08] tired of being us. You know what? I'm
[1:58:10] tired of this. I never forget. I stood
[1:58:12] in Brother Bill's basement and my you
[1:58:15] know, I I I just all I could say in that
[1:58:17] moment, I said, I'm tired of living this
[1:58:19] kind of life.
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; Tired of it. All these the promising
[1:58:25] this I'm going to be better at this and
[1:58:27] do this and do that. I'm tired of living
[1:58:29] this kind of life.
[1:58:34] Even God was dealing with my heart even
[1:58:36] even leading up to that time, letting me
[1:58:38] see certain things about the world. Let
[1:58:40] me see certain things
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; about situations in the world.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; And I would speak to others. But yet be
[1:58:47] right back out. Be right back. Be right
[1:58:49] back. Plans for that night. Plans for
[1:58:50] this. Plans for that. Plans for this.
[1:58:52] But it's got to come to a place to where
[1:58:54] we're tired of it.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Let me just say this to you friends.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; This is not just something if you can,
[1:58:59] you understand this. You have access to
[1:59:02] this labor
[1:59:04] not only as one who is coming into a
[1:59:07] place to come into fellowship with God
[1:59:10] and to be washed by the word to be
[1:59:14] clothed with the garments of the word
[1:59:16] but you have access
[1:59:19] that when the toils of life
[1:59:22] when circumstances of life when you've
[1:59:25] fallen in a trap when you've made a
[1:59:28] mistake let me just tell you something
[1:59:29] one a mistake does not define you.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Willful sin is so much different than a
[1:59:36] mistake. Oh, brother Simon, I still feel
[1:59:38] I have the desire. You'll always have
[1:59:39] the desire in your flesh.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; The spirit, Galatians 5, the spirit,
[1:59:46] capital S, lustth against the flesh.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; The flesh against the spirit.
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; Now, this doesn't sound like I'm
[1:59:53] preaching this, but it has to be gone to
[1:59:54] give that revelation. And it's something
[1:59:56] from the inside to where you know I'm
[1:59:59] free.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; You're God's free man.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; But you still need that washing of water
[2:00:05] by the word. That's why we're sitting
[2:00:06] here this morning. It's your the washing
[2:00:08] of water by the word that comes down and
[2:00:10] not only will bring conviction and deal
[2:00:12] with situations in our life, but it's
[2:00:13] here to loosen us.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; Anybody know what I'm saying?
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; You go through life, you journey through
[2:00:21] life. As you're walking through life,
[2:00:24] you know what? You you need the
[2:00:26] cleansing power.
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; And you know where that cleansing power
[2:00:30] comes from? As a dove filled with the
[2:00:32] spirit of God, it comes from the inside
[2:00:33] out.
[2:00:35] You say, "How does that come from the
[2:00:36] inside out?" By you surrendering to the
[2:00:38] inside man.
[2:00:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; And say, "I'm going to I'm not going to
[2:00:41] I'm I'm going to stop trying to live out
[2:00:43] here in the spirit realm and reason it
[2:00:44] all out and make sense of this and make
[2:00:46] sense of that. Come back to your
[2:00:47] God-given ground." Amen.
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; So, how do we come how do we come in? I
[2:00:53] know I just I haven't very got very far
[2:00:55] here this morning, but I want you to see
[2:00:57] this. It's a washing of water by the
[2:01:00] word loosed
[2:01:02] when Ruth came in there. When Esther
[2:01:05] came, when Esther before she could go in
[2:01:07] before the king,
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; she had to be washed. All right.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; They even took them for a period of time
[2:01:15] where they stayed there
[2:01:17] &gt;&gt; before they would come into that place
[2:01:19] before they had their night with the
[2:01:20] king.
[2:01:22] But when Esther's time came,
[2:01:25] Esther was unlike the rest of them. The
[2:01:27] rest of them told the king's
[2:01:30] chamberlain, which is a type of the Holy
[2:01:33] Spirit, "We'll take this and this and
[2:01:36] that, and I'll wear this, and don't you
[2:01:39] touch and say nothing else."
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; You know, I'm quoting scripture.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:01:45] &gt;&gt; He was a that that that he was a type of
[2:01:49] the Holy Spirit, the king's chamberlain,
[2:01:51] the word, the the the messenger here
[2:01:54] speaking in that time. But Esther said,
[2:01:57] "You know what? He wants
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; you. Show me the attire
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; that I need to go in before the king."
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; She, what did she do? Forfeit her
[2:02:07] rights.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; She surrendered her rights in entering.
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; And the king had delight in her. Why?
[2:02:15] What was it? Was it because of all the
[2:02:17] garments and everything? My No, she
[2:02:20] listen. As far as how that many of them
[2:02:23] smelled Oh, listen to me now. I've got
[2:02:25] to stand on this point. They all had to
[2:02:27] pass through a certain ritual of
[2:02:29] purification.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; They all had the same smell.
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; But the difference was one had an odor
[2:02:40] from her heart.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. to where it was not just something
[2:02:45] on the flesh,
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; something that was just an anointing
[2:02:49] that that that fell on Sunday and lasted
[2:02:52] through a portion of Sunday on Monday
[2:02:54] and Tuesday, but this was something that
[2:02:56] was down on the inside of her heart. The
[2:02:58] Bible said she had a meek spirit.
[2:03:03] [Music]
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; That was the difference. That's where
[2:03:06] God, that's where King of Azarus, a type
[2:03:09] of Christ, of Almighty God, he had
[2:03:11] delight. What was it? It was the
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; of her heart.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; He had delight.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Let's stand
[2:03:29] now. I want to just say this to you.
[2:03:39] Brother Brown makes this statement and I
[2:03:41] want to
[2:03:43] I want to read this
[2:03:48] because I want to say to you where the
[2:03:49] real key is willingness.
[2:03:52] Willingness. And I think that's pretty
[2:03:54] clear throughout.
[2:03:56] I want you to understand this, friends.
[2:03:58] I'm not here to preach a sermon.
[2:04:03] I'm not here to try to put something
[2:04:04] together.
[2:04:07] But this one thought as we've been
[2:04:09] dealing with this on a priest through
[2:04:11] the very life of Ruth. I just gave that
[2:04:14] scripture. Ruth was brought into that
[2:04:16] place. Wash thyself. Put on raignment
[2:04:19] and get down at his feet.
[2:04:23] Come there
[2:04:26] all the way through the scripture.
[2:04:29] But the very thing that was tied to and
[2:04:33] drawn to
[2:04:35] is because
[2:04:39] we're not going in the rapture because
[2:04:41] we feel the anointing.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; You can have this is listen to me now.
[2:04:48] This is why the prophet said you can
[2:04:49] have it the Holy Spirit
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; every hour of your life and be lost and
[2:04:56] go to hell.
[2:04:58] He didn't say that one time. He said
[2:05:00] that multiple places. And actually, it's
[2:05:02] said all the way through the message.
[2:05:03] It's just it's phrased a little
[2:05:05] different when he's telling people,
[2:05:06] "Don't hold to gifts. Don't hold to
[2:05:08] sensations. Don't hold to emotions.
[2:05:11] Don't hold because I've done this,
[2:05:12] because I've done that."
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; The whole thing is to getting people
[2:05:16] anchored in the word. That's where the
[2:05:18] bride is.
[2:05:20] &gt;&gt; Because that's your place of rest.
[2:05:21] That's your place of solidness. But when
[2:05:23] when brother Brown makes this statement
[2:05:25] that you can have it every hour of your
[2:05:26] life and still be lost and go to hell is
[2:05:29] because if it's just out here on the
[2:05:31] flesh and I'm talking about spirit realm
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; that's why the prophet says in Christ
[2:05:37] revealed in his own word he said you can
[2:05:38] love God and still be lost. Well, how
[2:05:40] could I love God and still be lost?
[2:05:42] Because it's not with his love.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:05:45] &gt;&gt; His love is only penetrated to the
[2:05:47] spirit and it's just where we're taken
[2:05:50] with, oh, I love God. Hey, listen. Let
[2:05:53] me just say this to you. I
[2:05:55] I I want to say this in the right light.
[2:05:59] In one way, in one way, in one way, it's
[2:06:03] almost a breath of fresh air to hear
[2:06:06] certain things coming out of the White
[2:06:07] House and to hear certain testimonies,
[2:06:10] to hear certain things and then you see
[2:06:12] this, oh, among all these athletes,
[2:06:14] among all these things, and I don't
[2:06:15] follow all this, but I want you to
[2:06:17] understand,
[2:06:19] I want you to understand this,
[2:06:22] but it's more than just being enamored
[2:06:26] with a person.
[2:06:31] Are you hearing me? I'm not downplaying
[2:06:33] anything. You understand what I'm
[2:06:34] saying? I mean, I'll take those things
[2:06:36] coming out of the White House rather
[2:06:37] before I'll take the transgender and all
[2:06:40] the funny business and everything else.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying I'm not I don't want to
[2:06:45] get in divisive things you but I think
[2:06:47] we can fellowship as believers. You
[2:06:49] would at least prefer that over top of
[2:06:50] the other stuff. But what I'm trying to
[2:06:53] say is is that if you look look look
[2:06:56] everything even that's happening right
[2:06:57] here there's things you find are
[2:06:59] congealing
[2:07:02] darkness is pressing and that's why the
[2:07:03] prophet said that darkness is pressing
[2:07:05] even all of those systems together and
[2:07:08] they don't even agree with one another.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; But it's darkness that's pressing it all
[2:07:15] together.
[2:07:18] But it's the spirit of God that's
[2:07:20] uniting his people together.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; See, God has brought us brought us to a
[2:07:26] place
[2:07:28] who whosoever would hear his voice, let
[2:07:31] him come. Let him be washed by this
[2:07:34] word. Let the word wash him. That's why
[2:07:36] I say friends, listen. This is why I I
[2:07:38] say this and I say it over and over.
[2:07:41] If you haven't, which you should have
[2:07:43] heard this already and should know this
[2:07:44] already, this is a message church.
[2:07:47] This is not a Pentecostal church. This
[2:07:50] is not a Baptist church.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; What are you What are you saying? I'm
[2:07:56] saying that the message that we are
[2:07:57] preaching is the message that God has
[2:08:00] sent in this end time.
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; This is the approach
[2:08:06] to God.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; It's revealing the path of the blood.
[2:08:11] How to get to God in fellowship.
[2:08:15] Thank God that the others that we can
[2:08:16] know know him as savior. I thank God for
[2:08:18] that. I listen I don't have no problems
[2:08:20] with with with that of inspiration
[2:08:21] pouring over from the lamb's book of
[2:08:23] life onto the book of life. But listen,
[2:08:25] I'm not called to preach to the book of
[2:08:27] life. I'm called
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; to preach to those who are in the lamb's
[2:08:30] book of life.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; But I'm called to express grace to all.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; I'm called to express grace even to
[2:08:39] lives that would be on the book of life.
[2:08:41] Because let me tell you something.
[2:08:42] Wherever that name is at, they cannot
[2:08:44] move from one book to the other.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; That's why in our lives, we're not we're
[2:08:49] not trying to make anybody something or
[2:08:51] this or that. But listen, you've got a
[2:08:54] call on your life. It's up to you to
[2:08:55] respond to that call.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; It's up to me to respond to that call.
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; It's up to you to say, "As for me in my
[2:09:01] house, we will serve the Lord. As for me
[2:09:03] in my house,
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; we will serve the Lord."
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; To be washed by the water of the word.
[2:09:10] And then to take the clothing of the
[2:09:12] word as the prophet says it like this.
[2:09:16] He says, "I'm trusting him someday. I
[2:09:18] don't know when for a crowning of my
[2:09:19] ministry. I've stayed as true as I could
[2:09:21] be. I don't know what it'll be. I don't
[2:09:23] know when it will be. Just when he's
[2:09:24] ready, I am. I don't care. I hope he'll
[2:09:27] he will crown my ministry of this of
[2:09:30] letting me take the clothes of the word
[2:09:32] and dress his bride in the cloth of the
[2:09:35] word and for his righteousness.
[2:09:40] So it whatever that dressing of the word
[2:09:44] that word being being dressed in that
[2:09:46] you laying aside our righteousness
[2:09:50] laying aside
[2:09:52] our ideas and I'll just be honest with
[2:09:54] you friends
[2:09:59] even as God brings us and we have
[2:10:05] stepped even into a place
[2:10:08] to where the blood's has been applied.
[2:10:10] The anointing has come and we are filled
[2:10:12] with the spirit of God.
[2:10:15] But we find from the working of the Holy
[2:10:17] Spirit in our life,
[2:10:19] he's still working
[2:10:22] to loosen us
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; from within.
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Ideas.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Come on. Some of you know exactly what
[2:10:30] I'm talking about. Ideas. Sometimes it
[2:10:32] wasn't even what you heard preached.
[2:10:33] Sometimes it has been. Sometimes you've
[2:10:35] you've had what in your spirit realm of
[2:10:37] how something's been presented in your
[2:10:39] conscience and it's taken you decades.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; It's not that it took God decades. It's
[2:10:45] that God's trying to work to get us to
[2:10:46] just let it go to do what? Burn that old
[2:10:50] leaven.
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; Some some have served God almost with a
[2:10:56] with a slave mentality
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; instead of as a son.
[2:11:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, if I mess up, he's going to get me.
[2:11:03] God's not out to get you.
[2:11:05] &gt;&gt; He is in one way. He was out to get you.
[2:11:08] He brought the blood to you.
[2:11:11] &gt;&gt; He was out to get you. He drew you to
[2:11:12] himself. And he's out to get you to take
[2:11:14] you in rapture. But he's not out to get
[2:11:16] you the way that you think.
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; He's not against you.
[2:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:22] &gt;&gt; He's for you.
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; And I want to say, Lord,
[2:11:27] like Peter,
[2:11:30] wash me completely.
[2:11:32] And Jesus said once you've been washed
[2:11:35] you don't need to wash
[2:11:38] but your hands and your feet
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; doings
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; goingings
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; how often every
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; day
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; that's why even we come and sit here
[2:11:51] washed by the washing of water by the
[2:11:53] word oh how God deals with our life he
[2:11:56] deals with certain things and what's he
[2:11:58] doing as we're we're standing with that
[2:12:00] word and submitting to it that word is
[2:12:01] bringing separation.
[2:12:04] &gt;&gt; You just you're sitting right there and
[2:12:05] you're saying, "Amen." And what's
[2:12:06] happening? The word, like brother Bram
[2:12:08] says, "Oh God, may the sword just move
[2:12:10] through us this morning." Just piercing
[2:12:12] as the word's being preached and
[2:12:14] separating us, Lord,
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; right in our life, just separating from
[2:12:18] all unbelief. What's the word doing?
[2:12:20] It's pressing it back.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; Being washed right where we're sitting
[2:12:23] and listening to the word. It's just
[2:12:24] that simple.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Just letting it. Let the word wash. Let
[2:12:28] the word have its way. Lord, separate me
[2:12:30] from all unbelief. Separate me, Lord,
[2:12:32] unto yourself. How many say, "Lord,
[2:12:36] that's my desire."
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; I mean that.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; I mean business. The rapture. The
[2:12:40] rapture is everything.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
[2:12:42] &gt;&gt; I want to be a real son and daughter of
[2:12:44] God. And I'm not saying that we're not,
[2:12:46] but I say for every one of us, let that
[2:12:48] be such an evaluation. If you haven't
[2:12:50] stayed or stood underneath the word and
[2:12:52] let the word wash you, I say, "Come."
[2:12:58] And I want to leave you with this
[2:12:59] thought.
[2:13:01] The Bible says whosoever may come,
[2:13:05] but it didn't say whensoever.
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:13:11] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:13:13] today is the day of salvation.
[2:13:18] &gt;&gt; Whosoever, not whensoever.
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; We don't want to just look at the door
[2:13:24] and look at the water and just look at
[2:13:26] the message and oh my, what a wonder get
[2:13:28] in it.
[2:13:30] Let the word wash you.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you the word the word will
[2:13:33] separate you from your anxiety.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will.
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; It'll separate you. And I'm not saying
[2:13:37] you have anxiety because you ain't been
[2:13:38] washed by the word. Understand what I'm
[2:13:39] saying? I'm telling you that this word,
[2:13:41] it will wash you. It'll separate you.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; It's able. It's able to come and put a
[2:13:48] separation between you and the torment
[2:13:51] of your past.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; That's the power
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; of this word.
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know why? Because God
[2:13:59] wants you to be free to worship.
[2:14:04] &gt;&gt; Let's just pray.
[2:14:07] Heavenly Father,
[2:14:10] Lord Jesus, how we our Lord are so
[2:14:14] appreciative
[2:14:16] of your mercy and your grace to us,
[2:14:19] Lord, right here, Lord, even in this
[2:14:21] assembly,
[2:14:23] Lord, as you've touched our lives,
[2:14:27] our hearts, and you've drawn us,
[2:14:32] Lord, to to come together
[2:14:36] and how we thank you for this the
[2:14:39] fellowship
[2:14:41] of the Holy Spirit through the word.
[2:14:44] Oh God, I I thank you, Father,
[2:14:48] for this living word.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; Lord, I see nothing but you.
[2:14:55] That's all I see is Jesus.
[2:14:59] I just see you, Father.
[2:15:02] I see you high and lifted up. I see you
[2:15:04] Lord
[2:15:06] above every situation.
[2:15:09] I see you Lord exalted in in my heart
[2:15:13] above unbelief.
[2:15:16] Lord we see you
[2:15:19] father. How we want to say thank you.
[2:15:21] That's before we even
[2:15:25] make any request. I just want to say
[2:15:27] thank you
[2:15:29] because Lord, like the song that was
[2:15:31] wrote by inspiration,
[2:15:33] not even in my wildest dreams that I
[2:15:36] think I'd see such things
[2:15:38] &gt;&gt; has the coming of the Lord the rapture
[2:15:40] mystery.
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; Lord God,
[2:15:45] it wasn't us.
[2:15:48] It wasn't us that found you.
[2:15:51] It wasn't us that found this message.
[2:15:55] It's you
[2:15:57] that came looking for us.
[2:16:02] I thank dear God
[2:16:05] a few weekends ago,
[2:16:07] 43 years ago,
[2:16:10] right over here, Lord, at the little
[2:16:11] YMCA
[2:16:14] right off of Tower Tower Boulevard
[2:16:18] was a little man by the name of James
[2:16:21] Browning
[2:16:23] would have a burden, Lord, upon his
[2:16:26] heart
[2:16:27] that yet he's not the one who rented
[2:16:29] that place
[2:16:32] another did.
[2:16:35] But Lord God, you used and worked
[2:16:37] through him
[2:16:39] within that meeting on that Labor Day
[2:16:41] weekend where hearts
[2:16:45] were restored back to the Lord
[2:16:48] that had fellowshipped under this
[2:16:50] message.
[2:16:53] Oh, they weren't out in the world
[2:16:55] running around. No.
[2:17:00] But Lord God, you drew them. And at that
[2:17:02] same meeting,
[2:17:06] I think of different ones like Sister
[2:17:08] Joe, Brother Herb,
[2:17:11] different ones, Lord, that were drug
[2:17:14] dealers,
[2:17:18] things throughout this city
[2:17:21] and you touched
[2:17:23] their hearts.
[2:17:26] Lord God, this work is not the work of a
[2:17:30] man.
[2:17:33] You raised this up, Lord. You didn't
[2:17:35] split it. You raised it up.
[2:17:38] It's your work.
[2:17:40] It's not a man's doing. Yet, Lord,
[2:17:43] you've worked through man.
[2:17:45] And it's been your word.
[2:17:48] A word, Lord God, that
[2:17:52] you would send,
[2:17:54] Lord God, to bring people not to where
[2:17:57] it would just reflect a man. Lord God, I
[2:18:00] don't want my image. I know my dad,
[2:18:03] Brother Browning, he never wanted his
[2:18:05] image to be reflected in people.
[2:18:08] Lord God, we've ran across that. We've
[2:18:10] seen that
[2:18:13] sometimes Lord certain things you can
[2:18:15] get around and you start listening and
[2:18:16] you'll start hearing certain phrases
[2:18:19] being said and these phrases and all of
[2:18:21] a sudden and then you start watching
[2:18:23] closely and then it'll become almost
[2:18:26] like exclusivity
[2:18:28] and you realize wait a minute wait a
[2:18:30] minute wait a minute we're called to
[2:18:32] freedom
[2:18:34] not to be excluding but to freedom in
[2:18:37] Jesus Christ.
[2:18:40] But Lord, I want to say thank you.
[2:18:43] I want to say thank you. Thank you for
[2:18:45] this word that you've sent, Lord.
[2:18:48] &gt;&gt; Lord God, thank you Lord for the message
[2:18:51] to be preached in purity, in power, and
[2:18:56] a demonstration.
[2:18:57] Thank you, Lord God, for each and every
[2:18:59] one of the gifts that you've allowed us
[2:19:02] to bring
[2:19:04] right through here, Lord, and be a
[2:19:06] blessing to us as an assembly.
[2:19:09] I thank you, Father, for the burden that
[2:19:11] you placed there, Lord, upon my dad's
[2:19:13] heart, Lord God. I I thank you, Father,
[2:19:17] for this word. Thank you, Lord God, for
[2:19:20] sending the prophet in this hour.
[2:19:24] But Lord,
[2:19:27] if my thanks
[2:19:30] was just limited to that,
[2:19:36] it still would not be to the degree of
[2:19:39] thanks
[2:19:41] that we should have.
[2:19:43] But Lord God, the greatest thanksgiving
[2:19:46] and way of thanks
[2:19:48] is to surrender ourselves to you, Lord.
[2:19:53] Lord God, it's more than talking about
[2:19:55] the past. It's more than talking about
[2:19:58] the pastor, more than talking about the
[2:20:00] prophet.
[2:20:01] But Lord God, it's to really get under
[2:20:03] the blood and get in fellowship with
[2:20:05] you. It's more than being associated
[2:20:09] with a church,
[2:20:11] Lord God. There should be a real
[2:20:14] association with you
[2:20:16] through and by the new birth. Lord God,
[2:20:19] may every young person, Lord, that's in
[2:20:21] here, Lord Jesus, there'll not be any
[2:20:24] rapture, there'll not be one go in the
[2:20:27] rapture
[2:20:28] without the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:31] And Lord, I pray as each one, Lord, as
[2:20:34] we've looked here in the scriptures and
[2:20:36] just Lord, not even getting into that
[2:20:38] place yet, but to know that God, there
[2:20:41] is a a process that you move through for
[2:20:46] the anointing to come upon our lives.
[2:20:49] Lord Jesus,
[2:20:51] you sent a word in this hour, Lord, to
[2:20:54] break the confusion.
[2:20:56] Even that statement I made moments ago,
[2:20:58] Lord God, that your prophet would make
[2:21:01] in those last few messages before he
[2:21:03] left the scene
[2:21:05] about having the Holy Ghost every hour
[2:21:08] of our life and still be lost and go to
[2:21:10] hell. That statement, Lord, is a som
[2:21:12] sombering statement and it should sber
[2:21:15] us. It should sober hearts, Lord God,
[2:21:18] but sobering to a place,
[2:21:21] not to where that it's left open to
[2:21:24] where we're somehow talked into a corner
[2:21:29] because Lord, the devil can never take
[2:21:30] from us what you've given to us. He can
[2:21:34] never break that seal. But the Lord, the
[2:21:37] coming of the Holy Spirit was more than
[2:21:40] just to be an anointing,
[2:21:43] Lord God, that we would even be under
[2:21:45] and cry
[2:21:47] and say, "Thank you, Lord."
[2:21:50] It was more than just an anointing that
[2:21:52] would make us, Lord,
[2:21:54] just for a season of time,
[2:21:58] just Lord, to be better. But Lord God,
[2:22:00] the anointing was meant to go to that
[2:22:03] soul
[2:22:06] and change the desire
[2:22:08] to where it's not just something, Lord,
[2:22:10] that we're
[2:22:12] just coming upon us and leaving, coming
[2:22:14] upon us and leaving, but Lord God, where
[2:22:16] the dove abides,
[2:22:19] it's abiding in our life by the new
[2:22:21] birth. Lord, I pray I pray God for each
[2:22:25] one. Lord, you know, I've not said these
[2:22:29] things even here this morning
[2:22:32] to be harsh, to be crude. If I have, I
[2:22:35] need to be at the altar.
[2:22:38] But Lord, I've said it
[2:22:40] from my heart, Lord, as you would lead
[2:22:42] me. I want to see each one
[2:22:47] walking in the inheritance that you have
[2:22:50] for them, Lord God. that Lord Jesus were
[2:22:53] every lie that the enemy would want to
[2:22:55] hang over, every reasoning or anything
[2:22:58] Lord that would want to hinder them or
[2:22:59] keep them back from the real
[2:23:03] life of God.
[2:23:06] Lord, a life like your prophet said, a
[2:23:08] priest of God,
[2:23:11] spending our lives
[2:23:13] in your service,
[2:23:16] worshiping you in spirit and in truth,
[2:23:18] interceding and petitioning, offering up
[2:23:21] spiritual sacrifices from the fruit of
[2:23:24] our lips.
[2:23:26] Lord, help us.
[2:23:29] May each and everyone, Lord, everyone,
[2:23:31] every one of us, Lord,
[2:23:34] I pray God, if there's one here this
[2:23:36] morning that's just, Lord, God
[2:23:40] looked upon the message, but has never
[2:23:42] come to a place to really stand and let
[2:23:47] the message of the hour, the word of
[2:23:49] God, wash them.
[2:23:53] Grant it, Lord Jesus. May they see May
[2:23:56] they see you. That's what I pray, Lord.
[2:23:59] I pray out of this service they've seen
[2:24:01] you Lord seeing that it's your desire
[2:24:03] Lord wasn't Moses his idea to Aaron and
[2:24:06] his sons but it was your word and they
[2:24:10] submitted to it
[2:24:12] grant it Lord I pray right here this
[2:24:14] morning may you Lord God I pray just
[2:24:17] drawing every heart and every life Lord
[2:24:21] into full consecration Lord continue to
[2:24:24] speak to our hearts Lord even Lord as
[2:24:27] this service Lord and at some point,
[2:24:29] Lord, that the last song will be sung,
[2:24:31] the last note will be played. But I
[2:24:33] pray, God, may the word that's been
[2:24:36] spoken, may it resound in our hearts.
[2:24:39] Even when we would leave out of here,
[2:24:41] Lord God, may the word keep on moving,
[2:24:43] Lord, and keep penetrating. Keep dealing
[2:24:46] with lives and hearts, Lord God. For
[2:24:49] Lord, we're living in a very late hour,
[2:24:52] Lord God. We're living in a place, Lord,
[2:24:55] we can't stand on our own works.
[2:24:58] When they came before that door, they
[2:25:00] had to be willing to be stripped of
[2:25:01] their own righteousness.
[2:25:04] Nothing of our rags of what we could do,
[2:25:08] but it's to accept
[2:25:11] your righteousness, Lord, to let ours
[2:25:14] down and be washed.
[2:25:17] And then after the washing,
[2:25:20] we can be clothed.
[2:25:24] Oh God, help us, Lord.
[2:25:26] Help us, Lord Jesus. You know every need
[2:25:29] that's here this morning. Maybe there's
[2:25:31] one, Lord, that's sick in their body.
[2:25:33] They've got an infirmity, Lord.
[2:25:35] Something, Lord, that's plaguing. And
[2:25:36] maybe, Lord, in their spirit or their
[2:25:38] mind. Lord God, I pray may the Holy
[2:25:41] Spirit just go right now, Lord. May the
[2:25:44] great washing of water by the word just
[2:25:47] go forward right now, Lord. I pray God
[2:25:49] as they're they're willing Lord their
[2:25:51] hearts Lord are open to you Lord this
[2:25:54] morning Lord may the spirit of God like
[2:25:56] the great pillar of fire that stood
[2:25:58] between the Egyptians and that Israelite
[2:26:01] army God may you just go and stand
[2:26:03] between them and that sickness Lord that
[2:26:05] disease that affliction Lord that mind
[2:26:07] battle Lord God may you minister Lord to
[2:26:10] them right now I pray grant it Lord fill
[2:26:13] every heart Lord I pray every heart Lord
[2:26:17] into that place of a condition that you
[2:26:19] might feel them. Lord God, bring them to
[2:26:22] that place of willingness, of surrender.
[2:26:26] Granted, Lord, I pray and make us, Lord,
[2:26:30] with my hands up, I ask you, make me
[2:26:34] more willing, Lord, where the prophet
[2:26:37] would say in the last part of
[2:26:39] recognizing your day and its message, he
[2:26:41] said, "Oh God, let there be a revival
[2:26:43] come in me, Lord. Lord Jesus, let them
[2:26:47] make me more willing. Make me, as he
[2:26:49] said, more humbler, make me more of a
[2:26:52] servant.
[2:26:53] Grant it, Lord God, I pray.
[2:26:56] Help us, Lord,
[2:26:59] in the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:27:04] Amen. Go ahead, brother Brian.
[2:27:07] More.
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:27:15] my love.
[2:27:19] The more that I release my cares,
[2:27:25] the more it takes control.
[2:27:31] The more that I can humble myself,
[2:27:37] the more he lifts me up. And every
[2:27:43] day I live,
[2:27:46] Lord, I love you more.
[2:27:53] And it gets easier
[2:27:57] to understand
[2:28:00] my
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; this road
[2:28:04] down.
[2:28:06] No more bravery.
[2:28:09] Oh, wondering.
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; I'm standing on solid ground
[2:28:20] to my future home and the voice I hear
[2:28:27] is yours.
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; Every day I live.
[2:28:33] Lord, I love you more.
[2:28:38] Oh,
[2:28:40] it's the more
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; and the lighter.
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, it is the more
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; it's the more tasty.
[2:29:02] Oh, and the more that I can humble
[2:29:08] myself,
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; the more lift me up.
[2:29:14] Every day I live.
[2:29:18] Lord, I love you more.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; The problems I had yesterday.
[2:29:31] Yes, Lord.
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:39] So
[2:29:40] [Applause]
[2:29:42] are now my
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:29:47] [Music]
[2:29:47] [Applause]
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; To my future home. And the voice I hear
[2:29:55] is yours alone. Every day.
[2:30:00] Oh Lord, I love you more.
[2:30:05] The more I surrender,
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; more.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; Oh, what a blessing it is
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; to have a heart
[2:30:23] &gt;&gt; with willingness to surrender.
[2:30:28] Lord, I surrender.
[2:30:30] The more that I can humble myself
[2:30:38] and every
[2:30:40] day,
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; oh Lord, I love you more.
[2:30:50] Remember, brother Brandon standing there
[2:30:51] in things that ought to be. Think about
[2:30:53] this washing of water by the word.
[2:30:58] He begins to speak to us
[2:31:01] about that going beyond the curtain of
[2:31:04] time
[2:31:06] and he says in that things that ought to
[2:31:07] be he says you know he says
[2:31:10] used to think he said we'd just be
[2:31:12] spirits floating by and I'd never be
[2:31:14] able to shake brother Neville's hand
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; right
[2:31:18] but this is what he says and things that
[2:31:20] ought to be he says but since the
[2:31:22] opening of them seven seals
[2:31:24] &gt;&gt; yes sir We know that's not the truth.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; You see, the opening of the seals never
[2:31:30] took anything away from him going beyond
[2:31:32] the curtain of time, but it only
[2:31:35] vindicated all the way through and he
[2:31:37] could see this is a place. And what it
[2:31:40] did, it made that even that much more
[2:31:41] clear as the prophet was walking on in
[2:31:44] my father's house as many mansions
[2:31:46] theophony.
[2:31:48] What What are you saying, brother Sam?
[2:31:50] I'm saying that the prophet as he stood
[2:31:53] there,
[2:31:55] he was willing to be washed
[2:31:59] when he told us, "Don't have a period
[2:32:02] after what you believe. Have a comma."
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; We believe all of this and all that he
[2:32:08] will continue to reveal.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; The prophet was an example of a believer
[2:32:13] walking into perfection. Amen.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; That had come through a perfect
[2:32:17] sacrifice and coming into perfection as
[2:32:21] the word separating.
[2:32:23] It's incredible when you used to go and
[2:32:25] you look how the prophet you just type
[2:32:27] in the table app. I used to think a lot
[2:32:30] of things you would find I used to
[2:32:32] think. Well, who changed the used to
[2:32:35] think? Because the prophet tells us in
[2:32:38] the message prisoner God loosened Moses
[2:32:40] from his previous thinking. Who was it
[2:32:43] that loosened
[2:32:45] the prophet from his previous thinking?
[2:32:47] Hey, he would have been just like you
[2:32:49] and I. Unless God came and revealed,
[2:32:51] we'd have still been going by our own
[2:32:52] thinking. But aren't you glad that God
[2:32:55] continues to come by your way and my way
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; and loosen us from our own thinking.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? I am.
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Let me make this comment before we go as
[2:33:07] well too about that anointing of the
[2:33:09] Holy Spirit.
[2:33:12] The difference is when it's
[2:33:15] just on the spirit, there's still all
[2:33:17] the desires within that life and it'll
[2:33:19] all come out still. And that's why
[2:33:21] brother Bram says, he says, you can take
[2:33:24] one. He said, they spoke with tongues.
[2:33:26] And he said, yet they're wearing shorts,
[2:33:28] they're cutting their hair, they're
[2:33:29] painting their face and doing all this
[2:33:30] and run. He said, and you try to tell
[2:33:32] them they don't got the Holy Ghost.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; What are they basing it on?
[2:33:38] The anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[2:33:42] But look at you. What's different about
[2:33:44] your life?
[2:33:46] Even when you're walking maybe tomorrow
[2:33:49] when you walk up, you wake up tomorrow,
[2:33:51] you're not going to feel like the
[2:33:52] presence you feel right here, right?
[2:33:53] Maybe maybe right now. I know sometimes
[2:33:56] when we wake up, we do sometimes that
[2:33:58] happens.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; But but what's difference is is that
[2:34:01] even when you don't feel his presence,
[2:34:03] you have the confirmation of his word in
[2:34:05] your life. Lo, I am with you always.
[2:34:08] Amen.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "How do I know that?" Look at
[2:34:11] the life that's being lived. No matter
[2:34:13] where you put your no matter where God
[2:34:15] put you, Daniel was still a believer
[2:34:19] &gt;&gt; in Babylon.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; You I don't care where you put Daniel,
[2:34:22] put him in a lion's den, he's still a
[2:34:24] believer.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; No matter where you put him,
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; the situations don't change. You know
[2:34:28] why? Why is that? It's not because
[2:34:30] Daniel was some great man.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; It's because there was a great God.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. who was living according to what
[2:34:36] could be lived in that hour. And Daniel
[2:34:40] didn't even have the Holy Ghost like we
[2:34:41] have the privilege of heaven.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; But he was able to live an overcoming
[2:34:44] life.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful for the grace of
[2:34:48] God?
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; Thankful for God's mercy. It settles us,
[2:34:52] friends. It settles us. And when we're
[2:34:55] settled, it affects how we walk in this
[2:34:58] life. It affects how you approach
[2:35:01] situations. It affects how even you
[2:35:03] approach the the mundane tasks of life
[2:35:06] cuz you're approaching it knowing that
[2:35:09] you've got all of heaven behind you and
[2:35:13] you've got a rest and you're in that
[2:35:14] rest.
[2:35:16] Don't you love him this morning?
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; I know I've kept you here. I've kept you
[2:35:20] a little longer. I didn't
[2:35:26] I know now you say we're used to it.
[2:35:30] But I trust with all of it. I trust. I
[2:35:34] trust. Oh God, we stand there even now.
[2:35:39] Lord, may our lives be fully consecrated
[2:35:41] to the word by the spirit. That's what I
[2:35:44] want, friends, with all my heart. Lord,
[2:35:46] if there's something I'm not seeing as I
[2:35:48] ought to see it, I want to see it the
[2:35:49] way you want me to see it.
[2:35:52] I want to see it the way you want me to
[2:35:54] see it. I want to see myself more
[2:35:56] clearly the way you see me, Lord. That's
