[36:41] store today
[36:42] just see his hand already in the service
[36:45] amen we know that we're here for a
[36:47] purpose
[36:48] amen
[36:49] God bless you Saints if you just want to
[36:52] go right to the word with me I think
[36:54] it's time amen I think the atmosphere is
[36:55] right we're going to turn to the book of
[36:57] First Corinthians
[36:59] the 13th chapter
[37:02] it being Thanksgiving time certainly
[37:05] want to wish you a wonderful holiday
[37:07] time with your family charity if you
[37:10] don't mind standing a little bit let's
[37:11] also take James chapter 1 and just
[37:14] verses 23 and 24 there
[37:20] now we just read an end time prophecy
[37:22] which is spoken to the general body of
[37:24] the church
[37:25] but I I like this scripture because
[37:27] James will take that that gen that
[37:30] General Church concept and he's not
[37:33] going to let you get away without
[37:34] receiving it on an individual level
[37:37] because James is speaking to an
[37:38] individual here he says you
[37:41] 've got to be a doer of the word
[37:44] uh uh verse 22 excuse me you'll be doers
[37:49] of the word and not hearers only
[37:51] deceiving your own cells for if any be a
[37:53] hearer of the word and not a doer he's
[37:56] like unto a man beholding his natural
[37:58] face again in a mirror amen before he
[38:01] beholdeth himself and he goes his way
[38:03] and right away
[38:04] he forgets what he looks like
[38:06] amen I love this example he he looks he
[38:10] beholds and he goes his way and forgets
[38:13] what he looked like amen that we don't
[38:15] want that to be us shall we have a word
[38:18] of prayer heavenly father that's our
[38:20] desire Lord that we could look into your
[38:22] word today and father that you would
[38:24] just be gracious to take control of this
[38:26] service these vessels Lord these gifts
[38:29] and Lord just anoint this word father
[38:31] that we could see a little more clearly
[38:33] I pray help somebody to come to a more
[38:35] perfect understanding under the perfect
[38:37] light of this perfect word father and
[38:40] Lord may it stick with us Lord let it be
[38:42] a revelation because otherwise we'll
[38:44] walk away father and forget what we look
[38:46] like but Lord show us clearly and let it
[38:48] change Lord our our pers our faith our
[38:52] confession and our perception of
[38:53] ourselves according to your word we just
[38:56] dedicate ourselves to you now in the
[38:57] name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
[39:00] amen we love you you can be seated
[39:03] so bear with me a few moments and I'll
[39:06] just uh find the flow here but you know
[39:09] I love this example uh that James gives
[39:13] of and Paul of the mirror of the word
[39:15] because the word is a mirror amen you
[39:18] can look into this word and it it it
[39:20] will tell you the truth it it won't lie
[39:23] to you like some mirrors do you know
[39:25] it's not a trick mirror it's a it's a
[39:27] it's a true mirror you look into it you
[39:30] find out where you're wrong you look
[39:32] into it you find out where you're right
[39:34] it can show you all of these things but
[39:36] the purpose of a mirror is to show you
[39:39] yourself
[39:40] amen that's that's the real purpose
[39:42] that's the real power amen of of you
[39:45] know the device of the word is is that
[39:47] it it can show you yourself and now it's
[39:50] not uh and especially in this day like
[39:52] never before we're able to look into the
[39:55] word of God right it's a blessed time
[39:56] because we're able to to hear the word
[39:59] read the word fellowship with the open
[40:01] word for this day and uh and because
[40:04] there's been an evening light that has
[40:06] shown on this word there can be a full
[40:08] recognition it's not like when you walk
[40:10] into a room you know as we all have done
[40:12] and you walk in a room in a strange
[40:13] house and you've never been there and
[40:15] and all of a sudden you see a little
[40:16] motion you know you're in a dark room
[40:18] and you see a little emotion out of the
[40:19] corner of your eye and it it scares you
[40:21] you know it you jump you start you run
[40:23] over and you flip on the light and when
[40:25] the light comes you're like oh it's me
[40:27] amen and that's that's uh that's the
[40:30] experience that we're having with the
[40:32] word for our day is it is I it's it's
[40:35] revealing to us our identity who we are
[40:38] and and what we look like amen and and
[40:41] and and and that's what's so important
[40:43] and but but James is saying the danger
[40:45] of it is what the James rebuke here is
[40:48] that he's saying you know the danger of
[40:50] it is you can look into this word but
[40:52] then when you walk away you know there's
[40:54] there's a certain level of Christianity
[40:55] where when you when you walk away you
[40:57] forget what you look like you forget
[40:59] what it said you forget your position in
[41:01] that word and I think you understand
[41:02] what I'm saying and and uh and and and
[41:05] but I love that because James rebuke of
[41:08] of of the believer here it's not based
[41:11] on the position of the believer James
[41:13] isn't saying what that mirror is showing
[41:15] you of yourself is wrong he's not saying
[41:17] your position in that mirror is wrong
[41:19] there's nothing wrong with what the word
[41:21] is saying you are the problem is when we
[41:23] walk away we forget what it what we look
[41:25] like amen so it's a it's not the it's
[41:27] not the word that has a problem or your
[41:29] position in that word but it's your
[41:31] perception of it and the way that that
[41:33] affects your daily life amen and uh
[41:35] that's where that that phrase comes in
[41:37] that we're familiar with of living below
[41:39] our Privileges and brother Brown said
[41:40] you know he said that's just about where
[41:42] our churches are getting we're children
[41:44] of God but we're losing our inheritance
[41:46] by our conduct the things that we do and
[41:50] put an emphasis here and the things that
[41:52] we permit to be done and the way that we
[41:54] live and act and so forth he says we're
[41:57] living millions of miles below our
[41:59] privilege so I want you to notice that
[42:01] living below our privileges amen is not
[42:04] just you know sort of the way that we
[42:05] think about all the time of a of failing
[42:07] to see the supernatural failing to have
[42:09] Miracles failing you know not receiving
[42:12] healing not receiving deliverances and
[42:13] things of that but it's actually living
[42:15] a life here on Earth amen where your
[42:18] life is not matching up to what the word
[42:20] is saying you ought to be amen amen so
[42:22] it's it's more than experiences it's
[42:25] more than Supernatural uh let's say
[42:27] Rewards or blessings raining down it's a
[42:30] question of identity amen we're living
[42:33] below our privileges because we are
[42:34] falling short of a revelation of our
[42:37] identity in the word of God Amen are you
[42:39] with me now amen and he says now he even
[42:41] puts it on the he puts a a
[42:43] responsibility on the ministry he says
[42:45] we ministers we ought to be ashamed of
[42:47] ourselves when we keep our congregation
[42:49] way below our privileges amen below
[42:52] their privileges he said the whole
[42:53] Christian church today is living
[42:56] thousands of miles below their god-given
[42:58] privilege because they're half asleep he
[43:01] said they're they're dismalike amen and
[43:03] that's what it means to live below your
[43:05] privileges is to live a life where
[43:06] you're just you're just slumbering it
[43:08] just kind of half the Sleep there's no
[43:09] you know there's no intent focus on on
[43:12] the word of God you just sort of you're
[43:14] coasting along you you join a church and
[43:16] amen you're just sort of in a half
[43:18] asleep Slumber but that's it's not the
[43:20] day for that this is the hour of
[43:22] Awakening amen it's an hour when we're
[43:24] to wake up and and realize that the word
[43:26] has a message that is trying to tell us
[43:28] and it's concerning you amen it's
[43:31] concerning you as an individual and
[43:33] that's that's the beautiful thing about
[43:34] this message to me and uh no doubt you
[43:36] you heard me preach on it many many
[43:38] times that that it's got to be a
[43:40] personal revelation of this message it's
[43:42] a wake up to sleeping virgins you know I
[43:45] believe in the in the in the allegory
[43:47] there in the in the in the parable they
[43:49] were all sleeping but it was the wise
[43:51] ones woke up amen amen so maybe a time
[43:53] in your life you've been asleep but this
[43:55] is the hour of Awakening amen because
[43:57] the bridegroom cometh amen now now see
[44:00] uh uh uh uh our perception of it I I
[44:03] don't know if brother Wayne administered
[44:04] here any on on misunderstandings he'd
[44:07] been preaching on that quite a bit at
[44:08] home just a wonderful series on
[44:09] misunderstandings and I was thinking
[44:11] about that about our failure to perceive
[44:13] one another you know we just struggle
[44:15] with that you ever think about you know
[44:17] you have you ever been in a situation
[44:19] you know where you you'll say something
[44:21] or you'll make a little joke and it just
[44:23] landed wrong and you know and and and
[44:26] you re your walk away from there and
[44:27] you're like oh I just totally
[44:28] misrepresented who I am and now that
[44:31] person has a wrong perception of who I
[44:33] am and what I believe and how I think
[44:35] well if you've done that with somebody
[44:36] else you know that somebody else has
[44:38] done that with you and to think you know
[44:40] it's a amazing how much we struggle with
[44:42] to see the inner the inner workings of
[44:44] the heart because there is not another
[44:46] person sitting in this church and I just
[44:49] slipped this in here to deal with our
[44:50] little disagreements and our little
[44:51] petty issues you know between one
[44:53] another you know there's not another
[44:54] human being in this church that you have
[44:56] a perfect perception of who they are
[44:58] because somewhere along the line they
[45:00] said something or represented something
[45:01] or or maybe they thought something but
[45:03] now they've changed now they've grown
[45:04] and you're holding them to something
[45:06] that happened not a single person here
[45:08] we've got a perfect perception well how
[45:10] much less uh the word of God why our
[45:12] perception of the word we have little
[45:14] things you know little religious ideas
[45:16] little opinions and so many things in
[45:18] the way of just seeing clearly who we
[45:20] are but that's what the word is for
[45:22] that's why the message is preached is
[45:24] exactly for that purpose to reveal you
[45:27] to you the image of what God thinks
[45:29] about you in this day amen that's what
[45:32] the word is that's what the message is
[45:33] it's a light coming on the mirror of the
[45:35] word the message did not come to add
[45:37] anything to the word it didn't come to
[45:39] take any thing out of this Bible but
[45:42] what it came was to shed light so that
[45:44] we could see what was already laying in
[45:47] there amen with a perfect perception and
[45:50] that's the very critical thing that's
[45:52] got to transpire in your individual life
[45:54] is you've got to come to a personal
[45:56] revelation of this word by the message
[46:00] of the hour Amen brother Branham said
[46:02] and recognizing your day which is where
[46:03] I'm getting the bulk of this material
[46:05] this morning he said I want you to
[46:07] realize and recognize the time that
[46:10] we're living because we're just about to
[46:12] run out he said and by this you should
[46:15] know the very hour and time and sign and
[46:21] message that you are to receive amen
[46:24] many people know the hour you know I've
[46:26] had co-workers who have talked to me and
[46:28] they they know the world's coming to an
[46:29] end they know things are falling apart
[46:31] they're understanding the hour that
[46:33] they're living in but they don't know
[46:34] the time because they don't know that
[46:35] it's the coming of the Lord is right now
[46:37] at hand amen and how many people know
[46:39] the time but they missed the sign they
[46:41] they failed to understand that God sent
[46:43] a prophet and there's many people who
[46:45] know that God sent a prophet amen but
[46:47] they have not really seen the message
[46:48] amen but you've got to know the hour and
[46:51] the time and the sign and the message
[46:53] you've got to realize and recognize amen
[46:57] amen I always ask in this way in this
[46:59] question what is the message amen
[47:02] because that's a question from my
[47:03] personal life amen that I found that
[47:05] maybe 10 20 years growing up in a
[47:08] message Church having believing parents
[47:10] having a good pastor preaching the truth
[47:12] amen was not enough to keep me from a
[47:15] religious and ecclesiastical experience
[47:18] amen where one day a young man is just
[47:20] walking I think on the grounds of a
[47:21] youth camp amen and ask in my heart what
[47:25] is the message and our churches are full
[47:28] of people who call themselves message
[47:29] Believers but they could not put it in a
[47:32] paragraph amen and and that's that's
[47:34] just exactly where the battle is right
[47:36] now brother amen everything is trying to
[47:38] keep you from seeing who you are
[47:40] amen I I bookmarked that for a moment
[47:43] there's a powerful quote on that I hope
[47:45] I remember to bring it out so so I
[47:47] that's my question this morning is what
[47:49] is the message to you amen is it uh you
[47:52] you know what it is an ecclesiastical
[47:54] terms but but do you see yourself in it
[47:58] is there a reckon has there been a
[47:59] recognition in your life that's me
[48:02] that's me amen
[48:04] like brother bran told the story about
[48:06] Willie Pruitt the little boy on a ship
[48:07] and his captain was sick you know and
[48:09] near unto death and that little boy was
[48:11] the only Christian on the boat and he
[48:13] said Captain I want to read you the
[48:15] Bible you know and he he read there in
[48:17] in Isaiah by his stripes we are healed
[48:21] he was wounded for our transgressions
[48:23] bruised for our iniquities but he said
[48:24] let me read it the way that my mother
[48:26] used to read it to me he said she always
[48:29] said to put your name in there so he
[48:31] read it again he said buy his stripes
[48:33] Willie Pruitt is healed amen he said now
[48:37] Captain you put your name in there the
[48:38] captain said okay he said buy his
[48:40] stripes John quartz is healed and the
[48:43] Lord healed the man because that's what
[48:45] makes the difference is is not just to
[48:47] know that it's laying in a Bible not
[48:49] just to know that there's a promise but
[48:51] there's something in your heart you can
[48:52] put your name in there friends amen can
[48:55] you put your name in this message amen
[48:57] amen because that's what it'll take not
[48:59] belonging to a message church or having
[49:01] the right Pastor or listening to the
[49:03] right Tate said amen said it's not
[49:05] putting your name on a book he said but
[49:07] know that your name is in heaven know
[49:09] that it's written on the Lamb's Book of
[49:11] Life amen and you can put your name
[49:13] there friends I don't know where you're
[49:14] sitting this morning but I know that I
[49:16] am in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[49:19] amen that is my position that is what
[49:21] this message has revealed to me I'm not
[49:23] just the son of Brian and Lucille
[49:25] Erickson I'm not just a member of True
[49:27] Word Tabernacle amen but I am an eternal
[49:29] seed of God my name is written on that
[49:32] book and I am right now in Heavenly
[49:34] places in Christ Jesus I can put my name
[49:37] there because of the message brother
[49:39] Bram said the bride is ready you say
[49:42] brother Nathan amen but I'm not ready I
[49:44] don't feel ready but brother Braham says
[49:46] the bride is ready so you know what the
[49:49] word is right your perception is wrong
[49:51] amen he said the Rapture is at hand amen
[49:55] it's at hand you say well brother Nathan
[49:57] but this has to happen and that has to
[49:59] happen forget your perception I put my
[50:02] name in there amen I'm ready the Rapture
[50:05] is at hand and I'm ready to go
[50:09] because it's personally revealed to me
[50:11] that this message came to call me out
[50:13] amen he said can we realize that
[50:17] can we actually believe that
[50:20] or is it a story that's been told is it
[50:23] a myth to us is it something that sounds
[50:25] real is it something that just on the
[50:27] outside we can believe or is it
[50:30] something that's in us that's part of us
[50:33] that's more than life to us amen What
[50:37] attitude do we set in in this Tabernacle
[50:40] hey man now that's something we all have
[50:43] to question ourselves amen where where
[50:45] do I where am I placing myself where am
[50:47] I at and and what I would want to just I
[50:50] would just trust the Lord with what uh
[50:52] the Holy Spirit would do something for
[50:53] you this morning amen with this little
[50:55] sermon that from this day that you just
[50:58] make up your mind from this day any
[51:00] encounter I have with the word of God if
[51:02] it's in prayer if it's going to church
[51:04] if it's listening to a message if it's
[51:06] reading my Bible every time I come
[51:09] before the word of God I will come with
[51:11] this attitude amen that I put my name in
[51:14] there that I realize that it's speaking
[51:15] of me that I belong there in that
[51:17] scripture it's not an abstract it's not
[51:19] an intellectual conception but it's God
[51:21] trying to reveal to me amen things about
[51:24] myself Amen brother Brown see that's
[51:27] true identification brother Brandon
[51:29] preaching on identification amen more
[51:31] than just about any other topic you know
[51:33] identification identification many of
[51:35] those he preached God is identified in
[51:37] his characteristics the identified
[51:38] Masterpiece of God he preached identify
[51:40] patient identification amen why because
[51:43] that's what the message is all about is
[51:45] to bring you to an identification of who
[51:47] you are and what position you are in and
[51:50] something he says over and over and over
[51:51] again I love this phrase in those you
[51:53] you run the keywords you'll see it all
[51:55] through those messages he says Identify
[51:57] yourself now in your present condition
[52:01] in your present condition and because
[52:04] he's saying you know what you know
[52:05] everybody thinks well if I had to live
[52:07] back in Bible times I would have been
[52:08] one of them 12 disciples well the
[52:10] statistics aren't good amen amen well I
[52:13] would have I would have listened to
[52:14] Noah's message I would have followed
[52:16] Moses out of Egypt I would have done
[52:18] that I would have done that but he said
[52:19] now but you got to look at your present
[52:21] condition and that's what is identifying
[52:24] who you are amen Oh Glory so it's a
[52:26] challenge to us friends but just look on
[52:28] the positive side of that just for a
[52:30] moment today Amen brother Braham said
[52:32] what you are now you will be there he
[52:34] said if you're a doubter now you'll be a
[52:36] doubter over there he said death can't
[52:38] do nothing but change your Dwelling
[52:40] Place friends amen so you if you're in
[52:43] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus then
[52:45] what you are right now that's what you
[52:48] are on the other side that's what you
[52:49] are in the mind of God death can't
[52:51] change that and sin can't change that
[52:54] you are a seed of God in your present
[52:57] condition amen it gives us Faith to know
[52:59] hey I've seen this message I don't know
[53:01] I don't understand all the things many
[53:03] things are mysterious to me but one
[53:04] thing I know there's been a revelation
[53:06] there's been a quickening and I've
[53:08] caught something that to know that I
[53:10] belong to this message he didn't call me
[53:11] a chicken he called me an eagle he
[53:14] identified me and if and I'm an eagle
[53:16] now I'll be an eagle over there I might
[53:19] be flying here now but just wait a
[53:21] little while because I'm an eagle
[53:24] I'll fly higher
[53:25] Larry God is trying to show you who you
[53:28] are
[53:30] amen and it's not about see and that's
[53:32] what it's got to be as a personal
[53:34] revelation of yourself in this word is
[53:37] this message you is it your calling is
[53:40] it your truth is it your life or is it
[53:42] just your church
[53:44] come on man isn't just your church amen
[53:48] because one thing we know for sure amen
[53:49] is that it's not about just all the
[53:51] doctrine you know and how well-taught
[53:53] you are and then you can dress the part
[53:54] and all those kind of things amen all
[53:57] that is on the religious level amen you
[53:59] know to understand the Mysteries and
[54:01] things brother bran said you don't even
[54:02] need a revelation Amen to see water
[54:04] baptism
[54:06] but the question is have you been
[54:07] baptized
[54:09] amen you got you know there's a whole
[54:10] lot of people in this word that could
[54:12] take the Bible and show you run you down
[54:13] through all the scripture to show you
[54:14] water baptism without even a revelation
[54:16] but they never been wet friends amen and
[54:19] what difference is it if you can
[54:20] intellectually explain the Seven Seals
[54:22] in the third poll and the Seven Thunders
[54:24] and all those kind of things but you've
[54:26] never been baptized
[54:28] with the Holy Ghost
[54:30] amen
[54:32] amen well then what good does your
[54:34] church do you then
[54:35] no friends that's not what it is brother
[54:37] Bram said the seals are open
[54:39] I know people got a problem with that
[54:41] but I don't because he said
[54:42] the seals are open and it's revealed to
[54:45] us
[54:46] revealed to us was listening to the
[54:48] seventh seal on the way to church this
[54:49] morning brother Brown just on and on you
[54:51] know it just could not go to the public
[54:53] because there'd be so many imitators it
[54:55] would just drag it down in the dirt
[54:57] but it wasn't for the public but it's
[54:59] revealed to us
[55:01] oh it's open France we see what they
[55:03] left off he said now you that want to
[55:05] debate
[55:06] amen this recognize your day it's quite
[55:08] a great message you know because you
[55:09] come under some real strong criticism so
[55:11] it just he's really he just really
[55:14] pushing his things he says uh really
[55:16] just just a a given a a strong answer
[55:19] here he says you that want to debate and
[55:21] fuss about serpent seed and water
[55:22] baptism and so forth you're blinded and
[55:24] you don't know it amen the God of this
[55:27] world has blinded you to it and you
[55:29] don't know it amen you don't know it now
[55:32] that's what he's saying about his
[55:33] critics about the critics of his message
[55:36] but how much worse would it be to be so
[55:38] blind Amen to see see he's saying look
[55:41] you know he got all the gods God has
[55:43] supernaturally come down Vindicated this
[55:45] message and revealed these mystery
[55:47] truths to the church and all you want to
[55:48] do is debate it and fuss about it how
[55:51] much worse would it be brother sister to
[55:53] claim to be a believer of this message
[55:55] amen but all we want to do is debate
[55:57] about it all we want to do is fuss all
[55:59] we want to do is fight and argue and
[56:01] stew with one another amen instead of
[56:03] live it this message is to be lived not
[56:06] to be talked about not to go out in the
[56:08] parking lot and swap quotes and try to
[56:10] blow someone's mind and make somebody
[56:11] think that we're spiritual
[56:14] what a blindness amen amen that's the
[56:17] problem we add around the message we got
[56:18] too many guys trying to inject their own
[56:20] ideas push their own understanding and
[56:22] all we've had is private interpretations
[56:25] we've had Decades of private
[56:27] interpretations of this message and all
[56:29] it's produced is a bunch of churches
[56:31] split churches and broken fellowships
[56:33] and things like that but I'm looking for
[56:36] a personal revelation not a private
[56:38] interpretation
[56:40] but for the quickening power to come
[56:42] into the church and reveal the sons and
[56:44] daughters who they are
[56:46] and where they stand and what we're here
[56:48] to do friends God give us a personal
[56:50] revelation
[56:52] brother Brown said oh
[56:54] what is the new birth
[56:56] it is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[56:59] personally
[57:01] to you
[57:03] personally
[57:04] to you that's how you know you had a new
[57:07] birth because it's revealed personally
[57:09] to you it's not the Creed of the church
[57:11] it's not with just what brother Samuel
[57:13] teaches no it's revealed personally to
[57:15] you amen now watch now now you say
[57:18] brilliant you're always preaching our
[57:20] religious spirits and things but but
[57:21] listen brother Branham put the contrast
[57:24] here it's a revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:26] personally to you versus what not you
[57:29] joined a church
[57:30] not you shook a hand not you've done
[57:33] something different you said a Creed you
[57:34] promised to live by a code of rules
[57:37] amen but Christ
[57:39] the Bible he is the word that was
[57:41] revealed to you and then it's no matter
[57:43] what anybody says it's Christ in you
[57:45] that's the Revelation that the church
[57:49] was built upon
[57:51] the church is built on Revelation and
[57:54] not not not a group Revelation but a
[57:57] personal revelation as it was with Peter
[58:00] amen when Jesus came to his church and
[58:02] he said he said who do men say that I am
[58:04] who do you say that I am amen amen now
[58:08] and oh and oh they had a lot of theology
[58:10] to talk about well some say
[58:12] some say this brother he teaches it this
[58:14] way but that one he says that you know
[58:16] and they're saying Elijah and some are
[58:17] saying Moses and some are saying this or
[58:20] that amen and that's all they had was a
[58:22] bunch of head knowledge that's not what
[58:23] he was looking for
[58:25] amen but then Peter who was ignorant and
[58:27] he was unlearned and he wasn't
[58:29] intellectual but he had something silver
[58:32] and gold Addy none but he had something
[58:34] he said I know who you are you're the
[58:37] Christ you're the son of the Living God
[58:40] Amen and Jesus said blessed art thou
[58:43] Peter you never learned that in seminary
[58:45] you never learned that by intellectual
[58:47] conception amen but the father your
[58:50] father in Heaven has revealed that to
[58:52] you
[58:53] Hallelujah it took a personal revelation
[58:56] to know that he was dealing with Jesus
[58:58] Christ that's why many people I followed
[59:00] away from this message because it was
[59:01] never revealed to them that it's not the
[59:03] thoughts of a Kentucky hillbilly but
[59:06] it's the son of man revealing himself to
[59:09] his bride
[59:12] and that same revelation of who Christ
[59:14] was turned back around he said and you
[59:17] are Peter
[59:19] you think you're Simon you think you're
[59:22] ignorant online you think you're just a
[59:24] fisherman but you're Peter and that
[59:26] Revelation that's in you is a rock upon
[59:28] which I will build the Bride of Jesus
[59:31] Christ
[59:32] foreign
[59:37] Peter had a revelation that's him that's
[59:40] the Christ but the same Revelation
[59:42] caused him to understand that's me
[59:47] that's me
[59:49] you see what I'm saying a personal
[59:51] revelation brother brand said it's a
[59:53] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[59:55] you Christ the mystery hammers it and
[59:57] hammers it he said God never dealt with
[59:59] a group he never worked through an
[1:00:01] organization he always comes to the
[1:00:03] individual
[1:00:04] he said it's an individual personal
[1:00:06] revelation and he said all hell is
[1:00:09] against
[1:00:11] revelation
[1:00:14] this that's what hell is against
[1:00:17] Satan's not angry that you go to church
[1:00:20] Satan's not angry that you dress
[1:00:21] holiness
[1:00:23] any more than he's mad at an Amish
[1:00:25] person
[1:00:26] amen buddies but what Satan fears as
[1:00:29] that brother Ram said the bride would
[1:00:31] get the revelation of who she is because
[1:00:33] if she ever gets that Revelation she
[1:00:36] will understand he's powerless
[1:00:40] oh Satan hates revelation
[1:00:43] but we love it
[1:00:52] the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:54] personally you all Hells against that
[1:00:56] friends every Power on this Earth that's
[1:00:57] under the control of the devil is
[1:00:59] against that Revelation you realize that
[1:01:01] politics political powers are against
[1:01:04] you come into the revelation of who you
[1:01:06] are amen academic powers are against you
[1:01:10] finding out who you are amen cultural
[1:01:13] Hollywood is against you being coming to
[1:01:17] the revelation of who you are oh you
[1:01:19] might join us you might go to school
[1:01:21] amen you might cast a vote you might do
[1:01:23] those things but you don't belong to
[1:01:24] that system because the power of that
[1:01:26] system is trying to keep you from this
[1:01:28] present and this precious present-day
[1:01:31] truth this evening light
[1:01:34] and it's your light
[1:01:36] the message of the hour is to rise up
[1:01:38] wake up and shine cause your light has
[1:01:41] come and the glory of God is risen upon
[1:01:45] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:47] she is him she has his characteristics
[1:01:51] she's full of his attributes
[1:01:55] and she's here to fulfill his very
[1:01:56] Ministry for she's bone of his bone and
[1:01:58] flesh of his flesh
[1:01:59] and only the Holy Spirit can reveal it
[1:02:02] to you personally that that's me
[1:02:05] that's me the preacher's talking about
[1:02:06] it's me
[1:02:09] that is the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:13] Bible says the holy the spirit has come
[1:02:15] into US crying Abba Father so the
[1:02:18] purpose of the Holy Ghost was not to
[1:02:20] build a Pentecostal organization
[1:02:22] or not to give us you know initial
[1:02:24] experiences and one-time experiences but
[1:02:27] the Holy Ghost was put into amen the
[1:02:30] True Church the true seed now I know
[1:02:32] there's a tear out there but that's not
[1:02:33] who the rain is for but the rain was for
[1:02:35] the seed amen and it's come into you
[1:02:38] making you cry I have a father putting a
[1:02:40] reality a revelation in your heart you
[1:02:43] didn't come from down here you're a son
[1:02:45] or a daughter of God
[1:02:49] so there's no adoption in any form
[1:02:52] without the Holy Ghost
[1:02:54] don't put that in a bygone day amen
[1:02:57] we're not you know the Holy Ghost wasn't
[1:02:59] just for the Pentecostals and the Holy
[1:03:01] Ghost is doing things in this bride the
[1:03:02] Pentecostals knew nothing about
[1:03:05] right amen
[1:03:06] brother Brown said the new birth is
[1:03:08] Christ
[1:03:09] a revelation
[1:03:11] God has revealed to you this great
[1:03:13] mystery that's a new birth
[1:03:15] now what are you going to do when you
[1:03:18] get all that group together
[1:03:20] see what it is got to be an individual
[1:03:24] Revelation not we'd Fellowship around a
[1:03:26] bunch of churches and you know put a
[1:03:28] picture of brother Brandon on the wall
[1:03:29] and
[1:03:30] no
[1:03:31] but it's a bunch of individuals who have
[1:03:34] received personally a revelation of the
[1:03:36] word for their day oh but when we get
[1:03:38] together
[1:03:40] amen then he said the revelations
[1:03:42] perfectly in Harmony and God is
[1:03:44] expressing through his word by the same
[1:03:46] actions the same not an intellectual
[1:03:49] conception but acts of another book of
[1:03:51] Acts amen oh making the word manifest oh
[1:03:56] he said if the church only knew its
[1:03:59] position but I'm so glad he said it will
[1:04:02] one day
[1:04:04] it will then the Rapture will go amen
[1:04:06] not come it'll go
[1:04:10] you know brother Nathan I've heard these
[1:04:12] quotes a million times I think you know
[1:04:13] what we're going to do we're gonna
[1:04:15] preach until we get it
[1:04:17] until we recognize it friends you you
[1:04:19] want me to come here and you know uh say
[1:04:22] well brother
[1:04:26] they just bring a button I want to hear
[1:04:27] a bunch of stuff I've never heard before
[1:04:28] and just you know have you blow my mind
[1:04:30] and get real deep and spiritual and
[1:04:32] things that's not even what Ministry is
[1:04:34] that is not end time evangelism but end
[1:04:37] time evangelism is to take the word that
[1:04:39] was once delivered to the Saints and run
[1:04:41] it all the way to the rapture
[1:04:45] if you ever hear brother Nathan Erickson
[1:04:47] preach something that didn't come out of
[1:04:48] this word in this message it was a
[1:04:50] mistake
[1:04:51] and pray for grace for me amen amen
[1:04:54] because see see friends this word amen
[1:04:57] is is working right amongst us and
[1:04:59] people are now coming to the revelation
[1:05:02] of who they are
[1:05:04] and the oh the Rapture is upon us
[1:05:06] hallelujah amen
[1:05:09] just keep going until we recognize it it
[1:05:11] takes people some time some people takes
[1:05:13] Decades of blowing of going to church
[1:05:15] and hearing quotes
[1:05:16] and a religious life and one day
[1:05:20] they just hold on that appointed time it
[1:05:23] just quickens amen that's what religious
[1:05:26] Spirits are trying to keep you from
[1:05:27] watch now what brother bran said about
[1:05:29] these denominational spirits and see if
[1:05:31] it's not right here in the message of
[1:05:32] the hour
[1:05:33] he said fast pray fast pray that's all
[1:05:36] you hear
[1:05:37] why do they do that they want a Great
[1:05:39] Awakening
[1:05:41] right they want the church to wake up
[1:05:42] they know everything's in a terrible
[1:05:43] condition they know spiritually the
[1:05:45] church is an apostasy the younger the
[1:05:48] young Generations are falling away it's
[1:05:50] a horrible thing happening in the church
[1:05:52] and they're aware of that and they're
[1:05:54] believing brother Braham said there will
[1:05:55] be an Awakening and they're good people
[1:05:59] not a bunch of devils out here they're
[1:06:01] good people
[1:06:03] amen but what have they done they have
[1:06:06] not recognized The Awakening of the
[1:06:09] Bride
[1:06:11] they have not wrecked now what a
[1:06:13] horrible state to be in to have your
[1:06:15] very heart crying out for an Awakening
[1:06:17] and not realize that the Awakening of
[1:06:19] the Bride has already transpired it has
[1:06:22] already occurred and it is occurring he
[1:06:24] said by being a Christian they feel the
[1:06:26] pull of the hour but they haven't
[1:06:27] recognized what's been done amen that's
[1:06:30] what making them feel that way they know
[1:06:31] something's supposed to happen but
[1:06:33] they're looking for it way off in the
[1:06:35] future to come now you be careful now
[1:06:37] this spirit is trying to come into the
[1:06:39] message it's not trying to stay out with
[1:06:41] the Baptist and the Pentecostals and no
[1:06:44] this is the Antichrist Spirit trying to
[1:06:46] Cloud your minds and cause you to miss
[1:06:48] this revelation of the Awakening of the
[1:06:50] Bride which bride you are amen see but
[1:06:52] he said he said they're looking for it
[1:06:54] way off in the future when it already
[1:06:56] happened right by you amen they have not
[1:06:59] recognized The Awakening now see it
[1:07:01] wasn't that they missed it there was a
[1:07:02] prophet many people recognize brother
[1:07:04] Branham as a prophet many people
[1:07:06] recognize a prophet it wasn't that they
[1:07:08] failed to know that there was a message
[1:07:09] because a Prophet by definition has a
[1:07:11] message that he brings but what did they
[1:07:13] miss the Awakening of the bride and how
[1:07:17] tragic it is that all around in message
[1:07:18] churches we have people amen who've
[1:07:21] never had a new birth amen it's not
[1:07:23] revealed personally to them and they and
[1:07:25] they're looking for something to come oh
[1:07:27] brother Nathan you know when that sweep
[1:07:28] comes when that short quick work comes
[1:07:31] when that bride of Revival comes I tell
[1:07:33] you don't look for it to come amen The
[1:07:36] Awakening of the Bride has already
[1:07:37] happened thus save the Lord the move is
[1:07:40] on for the bride
[1:07:42] don't miss it it's happening right now
[1:07:45] and the more that we wake up the more
[1:07:47] it's revealed the more real it is the
[1:07:49] more manifested it is
[1:07:51] don't miss this
[1:07:53] amen but they missed that he was a
[1:07:56] forerunner they missed that he was
[1:07:57] introducing something
[1:08:00] and they missed it friends it was not
[1:08:02] their religious it's not the religious
[1:08:04] status that makes a foolish virgin
[1:08:06] they're just as religious as the true
[1:08:08] but it's just a failure to wake up
[1:08:11] wake up this Prophet did not come to
[1:08:15] reform the churches
[1:08:17] you probably heard me use this phrase
[1:08:19] that the message is not a slightly
[1:08:21] better church with slightly better
[1:08:23] Doctrine what does that mean it doesn't
[1:08:24] mean brother Branham came so that we
[1:08:25] could see the doctrine of the godhead a
[1:08:27] little bit more clear and we could get a
[1:08:29] little bit better Church order and we
[1:08:30] could get the people to dress more
[1:08:32] scriptural and all those kind of things
[1:08:33] that's not what this message was wow
[1:08:35] we've had reformers come to the church
[1:08:36] Luther came and he reformed the church
[1:08:39] amen and Wesley came and he reformed the
[1:08:42] church but this Prophet was a restorer
[1:08:44] amen he was restoring our our
[1:08:46] understanding it was restoring us back
[1:08:48] literally turning us back to the hearts
[1:08:50] of the fathers literally reached Thorn
[1:08:52] us to an eating condition and what is in
[1:08:54] Eating Condition it's where an
[1:08:56] individual man walks and talks with his
[1:08:58] Redeemer there's no intercessor there's
[1:09:00] no prophets priests amen pastors there
[1:09:03] amen but it's a man walking with God
[1:09:05] that's why this message means everything
[1:09:08] to me amen I'm not looking to turn it
[1:09:10] into an organization I'm not content
[1:09:12] with a religious system
[1:09:14] I want to know him and fellowship with
[1:09:17] him and walk with my father
[1:09:21] glory be to God a restore and we are the
[1:09:23] restored bride of Jesus Christ but you
[1:09:26] can sit in a message church and be a
[1:09:28] reformed Pentecostal
[1:09:30] many are sitting a message churches and
[1:09:32] they're nothing but a Reformed Baptist
[1:09:34] they got the same Baptist Spirit they
[1:09:36] got the same natural uh nature about him
[1:09:39] and they just got slightly better
[1:09:40] Doctrine
[1:09:42] friends but it's got to be a personal
[1:09:44] revelation of Jesus Christ you got there
[1:09:47] has to be a new birth and then that old
[1:09:50] nature those old ideas that old church
[1:09:53] that old oh it's dead and you've got a
[1:09:57] new husband amen glory to God
[1:10:00] until this light illuminates the mirror
[1:10:02] amen you can't sit there and be a
[1:10:04] reformed
[1:10:05] you've got to be restored by this light
[1:10:08] you've got to look into this word and
[1:10:09] realize that it's talking about you
[1:10:13] otherwise you'll miss the Awakening of
[1:10:15] the Bride
[1:10:16] amen Brethren said you know they were
[1:10:19] like they were like uh back when they
[1:10:21] missed Jesus he said they were like the
[1:10:23] people today blinded by scientific
[1:10:24] proofs and Educational Systems and all
[1:10:27] these things and it's blinded them again
[1:10:28] and what blinded them the Simplicity of
[1:10:31] the message and the messenger oh I love
[1:10:34] this amen the Simplicity the very
[1:10:37] Simplicity of the message and the
[1:10:38] messenger has blinded them amen but see
[1:10:42] see so is it today he said God always
[1:10:44] makes it simple to get the people who
[1:10:48] will believe and trust him do you catch
[1:10:50] that I'll come back to it now he says I
[1:10:52] want you to believe and understand that
[1:10:55] God has spoken I want you to believe and
[1:10:57] understand that God has spoke this
[1:10:59] message
[1:11:00] did you catch that brother sister he
[1:11:02] said God always makes it simple and then
[1:11:05] he tells you why he makes it simple to
[1:11:07] get the people
[1:11:09] he makes it simple to get the people you
[1:11:13] see where God's heart is with this
[1:11:14] message God did not take these Divine
[1:11:16] mystery truths and put him up on top of
[1:11:18] a mountain somewhere with some Guru
[1:11:19] where you got to go through a a 12-step
[1:11:22] plan of Enlightenment to get to it amen
[1:11:24] or what what hope would some of us had
[1:11:26] to have if he hid it behind some
[1:11:27] intellectual achievement amen but he did
[1:11:30] it he brought this message down there is
[1:11:32] not a child there is not a there's not a
[1:11:35] feeble mind there is nobody amen with a
[1:11:38] desire to know this Revelation to whom
[1:11:41] God will withhold it he will not hold it
[1:11:44] back he wants you to see it he wants it
[1:11:48] to be revealed
[1:11:51] and our perceptions are wrong because of
[1:11:54] Decades of false teachers who did
[1:11:56] nothing but take these open truths and
[1:11:58] bury them under a bunch of
[1:11:59] intellectualism but that's not what the
[1:12:02] message came to produce but the message
[1:12:03] came to open the very pages of the Bible
[1:12:06] so you could look into that mirror and a
[1:12:08] flash of recognition strike your face
[1:12:10] and say that is me
[1:12:13] I'm hearing from my theophany
[1:12:18] I always was an eagle but I couldn't see
[1:12:22] it in the darkness of my religious
[1:12:24] experience but thank God for a new birth
[1:12:27] [Applause]
[1:12:30] thank God for the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:32] Ghost
[1:12:34] comes screaming into our hearts Abba
[1:12:36] Father
[1:12:37] this is me this is what I belong to this
[1:12:39] is where I came from this is where I'm
[1:12:41] going this is what I'm on this Earth to
[1:12:43] do
[1:12:44] he makes it simple to get to the people
[1:12:46] now I want you to believe it he said
[1:12:49] and understand God spoke it
[1:12:53] God spoke it
[1:12:55] we do not count time you're comfortable
[1:12:57] today can we take a little detour I'm
[1:12:59] just this just came to me today I was
[1:13:01] just just admit just meditating this on
[1:13:05] this on the way here you know because
[1:13:06] we're always talking about you know well
[1:13:08] you know it's a little code word we have
[1:13:10] around the message if somebody's just a
[1:13:12] little behind they're not really just
[1:13:13] listening to it and not really got a lot
[1:13:16] of Revelation about he said well that
[1:13:18] brother you know Wonderful brother he
[1:13:19] really just sees God's Center Prophet
[1:13:21] never saw the opening the word but and
[1:13:24] and that's true that's that's a reality
[1:13:25] there are many around this message that
[1:13:27] just they took God sent a prophet ran
[1:13:29] with it and ran with it ran with it but
[1:13:30] you know never really saw the richness
[1:13:32] of the seventh seal they never they
[1:13:33] never saw the bride's position the
[1:13:35] bride's all they missed the Awakening
[1:13:37] the bride and maybe it wasn't for their
[1:13:39] day maybe they played their purpose and
[1:13:40] I just thought today you know you know
[1:13:42] we preach that way but but thank God for
[1:13:45] God sent a prophet
[1:13:49] thank God for God sent a prophet because
[1:13:51] none of us would see that amen God sent
[1:13:53] a prophet brother sister and he said a
[1:13:56] prophet that was Vindicated and and his
[1:13:59] interpretation of this Bible is the
[1:14:01] final word for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:14:04] don't ever think that the Awakening of
[1:14:06] the Bride does away with the message of
[1:14:07] the hour but the message is her
[1:14:09] Awakening it is her identity it is her
[1:14:12] power it is her adoption it is her
[1:14:14] Authority
[1:14:15] and thank God for brothers who preach
[1:14:18] their whole life with nothing more than
[1:14:19] God sent a prophet because somebody
[1:14:21] preached God sent a prophet so I can
[1:14:23] preach the seven seal somebody preached
[1:14:25] God sent a prophet so I can preach the
[1:14:27] third poll somebody preached it
[1:14:29] [Applause]
[1:14:31] amen I just felt to say that I feel I
[1:14:35] feel to to just make sure we don't get
[1:14:37] the wrong emphasis here
[1:14:39] and think that we got out from under a
[1:14:41] prophet no amen it'll be the spirit and
[1:14:44] the prophet and the bride saying the
[1:14:46] same thing
[1:14:49] that's why I preached brother Brandon
[1:14:50] said
[1:14:53] but he makes it simple
[1:14:54] to get the people Brother Band said
[1:14:57] you've got to accept it in its fullness
[1:15:00] watch this in the power of its
[1:15:02] vindication
[1:15:03] and the revelation
[1:15:05] of what it is
[1:15:07] so if you've got a real revelation of
[1:15:09] what it is
[1:15:10] then you won't you won't reject the
[1:15:12] power of the vindication
[1:15:14] just like a lot of brothers oh you know
[1:15:16] the bride's got power she's got adoption
[1:15:18] her name uncheck's good as his you know
[1:15:20] she's she's got the ministry of
[1:15:22] reconciliation
[1:15:23] you know but then let her lay hands on
[1:15:25] the sick one time
[1:15:26] let the Holy Ghost fall in a meeting
[1:15:27] with oh that's that's Pentecostal that's
[1:15:30] I don't know about that I don't want to
[1:15:32] get emotional I don't want to get
[1:15:33] fanatical friends but there has to be a
[1:15:35] power of vindication
[1:15:37] there has to be
[1:15:39] a power of vindication and that's the
[1:15:42] fullness of it
[1:15:43] amen
[1:15:45] but but see you've got to accept it
[1:15:48] you've got to accept it because you have
[1:15:51] a part in this word
[1:15:53] you realize that you are the Bride of
[1:15:56] Jesus Christ
[1:15:57] and so you are the culmination of the
[1:15:59] Plan of Redemption all the wheels of
[1:16:03] History
[1:16:04] all the stories of the Bible amen were
[1:16:07] Shadows pointing to you
[1:16:10] not someone else
[1:16:12] this is it this is the Bride of Jesus
[1:16:14] Christ I believe that with all of my
[1:16:16] heart friends so every type every shadow
[1:16:18] of the Bible the Saints of old lived and
[1:16:21] died and had their life experiences for
[1:16:23] the purpose of describing you that's who
[1:16:26] you are yeah you made mistakes that's
[1:16:28] why they had to make mistakes you go
[1:16:30] through struggles that's why they had to
[1:16:32] go through struggles they got sick
[1:16:34] because sometimes you get sick old
[1:16:37] friends it was all amen for the for the
[1:16:39] purpose of bringing forth the Bride of
[1:16:41] Jesus Christ can you accept that today
[1:16:44] don't accept it for the church accept it
[1:16:47] for yourself
[1:16:49] I am the culmination of the work of
[1:16:51] redemption and I am here to manifest the
[1:16:54] attributes of God and take a rapture

[1:18:26] his affection you are the purpose of
[1:18:28] redemption
[1:18:32] emphasis the very word Minister means a
[1:18:34] servant amen you say brother Nathan
[1:18:36] you've got a complex about these
[1:18:37] brothers no they're my heroes they're
[1:18:40] great men to me but they're here to
[1:18:42] serve the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:18:45] and I'm here to serve the Bride of Jesus
[1:18:47] Christ because she is the Queen of
[1:18:49] Heaven she is the apple of God's eyes
[1:18:53] [Applause]
[1:18:56] that's who you are this word speaks of
[1:18:58] you the stories of the Bible speak of
[1:19:00] you Redemption speaks of you
[1:19:02] the plan of God
[1:19:04] focuses on you
[1:19:07] no matter who you are no matter where
[1:19:09] you came from you're in there
[1:19:11] a sister came up in a prayer line
[1:19:12] recently and she said Brothers you know
[1:19:15] I always wanted to be a Ruth
[1:19:18] and I ended up being a Rahab
[1:19:22] yeah she wanted to stay in church
[1:19:24] marry a good man
[1:19:26] you know and be stable and have a good
[1:19:29] testimony in all these things but one
[1:19:31] thing led to another she took her root
[1:19:33] through the world
[1:19:34] made mistakes made failures
[1:19:36] oh I wanted to be a Ruth
[1:19:38] but I was a Rahab
[1:19:40] but friends
[1:19:42] Ruth Rahab Tamar
[1:19:46] David amen every one of them are in
[1:19:49] there amen you might be a Ruth you might
[1:19:53] have come out of drugs you might have
[1:19:54] come off a bar stool you might have come
[1:19:56] out of every sexual immorality or maybe
[1:19:58] you came out of a church and your
[1:19:59] victory was over religious spirits but
[1:20:01] Ruth or Rahab whatever you are you are
[1:20:04] attached to this Scarlet thread you are
[1:20:06] a part of this story of redemption amen
[1:20:09] because somebody was a Rahab there had
[1:20:12] to be a Rahab
[1:20:13] and because somebody at her there was a
[1:20:15] roof there had to be a roof
[1:20:17] because God had all of them in mind
[1:20:21] amen so we took him out of every
[1:20:22] background every Walk of Life every life
[1:20:24] experience and he married them and he
[1:20:26] justified them by a marriage not by who
[1:20:30] they were not by where they came from
[1:20:32] not thank you by the way that they lived
[1:20:34] their life but by a marriage
[1:20:36] [Applause]
[1:20:38] by a name change friends oh you made
[1:20:41] mistakes they made mistakes
[1:20:44] amen Abraham was a type a perfect type
[1:20:47] of a believer
[1:20:49] amen and when God came and gave him the
[1:20:51] promise he fell on his faith and laughed
[1:20:52] face and laughed but then what do you
[1:20:54] find Written in Blood over on the pages
[1:20:56] of the book of Hebrews
[1:20:57] Abraham staggered not at the promise and
[1:21:01] you and I think with our intellectual
[1:21:02] our religious Minds we say stagger not
[1:21:04] he literally fell over
[1:21:08] but it's not Written in Blood
[1:21:10] what are you saying brother Nathan I'm
[1:21:12] saying a Believer is not somebody who
[1:21:14] never had a doubt
[1:21:16] a believer's not somebody who never made
[1:21:18] a mistake
[1:21:20] amen Thomas doubted but brother Brown
[1:21:23] stuck up for him he said don't call him
[1:21:25] doubting Thomas amen yeah it would have
[1:21:27] been better to have believed and not
[1:21:29] seen
[1:21:31] but that's how Thomas Was Made Up and
[1:21:34] the grace of God revealed himself to him
[1:21:36] anyway
[1:21:38] that ought to tell you something amen
[1:21:41] you Thomas amen you're you're thinking
[1:21:43] thoughts you ought not to think you've
[1:21:45] been reading websites you ought not to
[1:21:47] read you're struggling with things in
[1:21:48] your mind you ought to just believe amen
[1:21:50] but you've got those doubts and it's got
[1:21:52] you so tore up God I don't even want to
[1:21:54] think this way I don't even want to
[1:21:56] doubt this message God maybe I'm not
[1:21:57] even a believer
[1:21:59] but a believer's not someone who never
[1:22:01] had a doubt
[1:22:02] but all it takes is a personal revealing
[1:22:04] of Jesus Christ
[1:22:06] and you could and it turned Thomas
[1:22:08] around and he went out he was one of the
[1:22:10] greatest missionaries of the earliest
[1:22:11] church and his name is written on the
[1:22:13] foundation of that City and nobody can
[1:22:15] ever erase it
[1:22:17] do you hear me Thomas you're struggling
[1:22:19] with that doubt but you're a Believer
[1:22:21] you are a Believer and that's why you
[1:22:23] can't let go this message because that's
[1:22:25] what believers do they believe
[1:22:27] so you can still fulfill your calling
[1:22:29] you can still have a Ministry a Thomas
[1:22:32] can still be a preacher
[1:22:34] amen
[1:22:36] a believer's not someone who never had a
[1:22:39] doubt
[1:22:46] take David
[1:22:48] you know Nathan went to him and told him
[1:22:51] a story David was so religious
[1:22:54] so self-righteous God all indignant said
[1:22:56] somebody ought to kill that guy
[1:22:58] that rich man had all them sheep and he
[1:23:01] had a visitor come and he killed his
[1:23:03] neighbor's precious only little lamb
[1:23:05] what a terrible thing didn't realize oh
[1:23:08] that's me
[1:23:09] that's me didn't dawn run right away
[1:23:12] oh my many times we find out ourselves
[1:23:15] in that position where we're just going
[1:23:17] on so religious so self-righteous
[1:23:19] looking down on everyone else and then
[1:23:20] all of a sudden just God will just
[1:23:22] reveal something to you and you just
[1:23:23] feel like such a failure oh God that's
[1:23:26] me I I'm doing that
[1:23:28] that's me God
[1:23:30] what's wrong with me am I not a Believer
[1:23:32] do I not have the Holy Ghost
[1:23:34] but notice what brother Brown said and
[1:23:36] thank God for a message of Grace Luther
[1:23:38] Brown preached the message of Grace and
[1:23:40] he took that story and he said you
[1:23:41] notice that that rich man he did not
[1:23:43] kill that lamb for himself but it was a
[1:23:45] visitor it was for a visitor it was for
[1:23:48] a visitor and brother Bram said that
[1:23:50] visitor represented David's passions
[1:23:52] that's why David could commit a horrible
[1:23:54] act like murdering Uriah and taking
[1:23:55] Bathsheba and still be a man after God's
[1:23:58] Own Heart why because it wasn't
[1:23:59] accounted oh blessed is the man to whom
[1:24:02] God will not impute sin but he didn't
[1:24:04] lay it on David he put it on a visitor
[1:24:08] young man you question whether you got
[1:24:09] the Holy Ghost thinking those thoughts
[1:24:11] of lusts all the time you think that's
[1:24:13] you that's not you it's a visitor
[1:24:16] young lady dealing with suicide dealing
[1:24:18] with anxiety amen you saints that
[1:24:21] struggle with things and those thoughts
[1:24:23] come in don't build that a nest that is
[1:24:25] not who you are it's just a visitor
[1:24:29] blessed is the bride to whom God will
[1:24:31] not impute sin
[1:24:34] yeah we're gonna make some mistakes but
[1:24:36] I believe this bride is Justified and if
[1:24:39] she's Justified she must have done
[1:24:41] something in the first place
[1:24:43] but it's as if she never did it
[1:24:49] that's the problem we have so many times
[1:24:50] thoughts come to our mind and we're just
[1:24:52] willing to embrace it and say that's me
[1:24:54] that's me that's my identity I am
[1:24:56] depression I am sickness I am
[1:24:59] discouragement I am lust I am this I am
[1:25:02] that you're not
[1:25:04] it's a visitor
[1:25:08] just send that traveler on his way
[1:25:11] Hallelujah no you are a true worshiper
[1:25:15] you are a true worshiper
[1:25:17] amen that's not you you're the true
[1:25:19] you're the true bride of Jesus Christ
[1:25:21] the true worshiper God's provided a
[1:25:23] place of worship brother Graham said
[1:25:24] there's only one place you can worship
[1:25:25] God that's the place he provided not
[1:25:27] where you can climb to not the way you
[1:25:29] think about it not who you think you are
[1:25:31] or what you can do but God provides a
[1:25:33] place of worship and the place of
[1:25:34] worship that he provides brother bam
[1:25:36] said is where he put his name
[1:25:40] that's why we can worship god with
[1:25:41] Liberty that's why we can lift up holy
[1:25:44] hands now these hands might have done
[1:25:45] something to this morning that wasn't
[1:25:47] holy but when you lift them up their
[1:25:50] holy hands why because you're worshiping
[1:25:52] him under his name because he called you
[1:25:55] by his name and he has converted you
[1:25:58] from a from sin amen and put place you
[1:26:01] in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:26:03] and considers you not a servant but a
[1:26:06] son
[1:26:08] you're identified with Christ
[1:26:11] when you see his righteousness you can
[1:26:13] say that's me when the Bible speaks of
[1:26:15] his Holiness you can say that's me
[1:26:17] because he became your sin that you
[1:26:20] might become his righteousness that's
[1:26:23] who you are that's the name that you're
[1:26:25] known by now you might come have a
[1:26:26] horrible past and there's a whole lot of
[1:26:28] horrible crimes and horrible sins that
[1:26:30] are attributed to the name you were born
[1:26:32] with but that is not your name
[1:26:34] [Music]
[1:26:36] he didn't put his name on your sacrifice
[1:26:40] he put it in Jesus Christ the way the
[1:26:42] truth of life and he called you by that
[1:26:44] name by the new birth of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:46] and he says now bring your sacrifice
[1:26:49] and I'll receive it
[1:26:51] because
[1:26:52] it's where I put mine
[1:26:55] you're him
[1:26:58] that's me
[1:27:00] somebody say that's me
[1:27:02] that's me
[1:27:04] he called you by his name old and all I
[1:27:07] want to do with my life is glorify that
[1:27:09] name I want to live a life that would
[1:27:10] glorify that name
[1:27:13] you know the the churches today modern
[1:27:15] churches they they're always going on
[1:27:17] about you know they have this saying and
[1:27:19] I think I brought it up here before but
[1:27:20] you know I was created to praise the
[1:27:22] Lord I was created to praise the Lord I
[1:27:24] certainly praise is part of it but you
[1:27:26] can correct me if I'm wrong I've never
[1:27:28] found it in the Bible in just those
[1:27:29] words of just praising him because the
[1:27:31] way that they mean it we know is come to
[1:27:33] church on Sunday and sing the group
[1:27:35] songs and raise your hands and take part
[1:27:37] in the tradition and that's and that's
[1:27:39] praise but God has Legions and Legions
[1:27:42] of angels to praise him and they can
[1:27:43] hold the key better amen they can sing
[1:27:46] it better they can they can harmonize
[1:27:47] better friends but so it's not just
[1:27:49] about you know saying God's good and and
[1:27:51] and worship you and how I love him and
[1:27:54] all those things but the Bible says I'll
[1:27:55] bring my seed from the East and West I
[1:27:58] will gather my children from the North
[1:28:00] and the South everyone called by my name
[1:28:03] I created him for my glory
[1:28:09] for my glory Not Just Praise but for my
[1:28:12] glory I formed him I made him
[1:28:16] to glorify the name you know that Jesus
[1:28:18] glorified the name of a father what does
[1:28:19] it mean to glorify the name of God we
[1:28:21] know that God was a mystery amen and
[1:28:24] there were things about God we did not
[1:28:25] understand so he sinned his only
[1:28:27] begotten son and all that was in God he
[1:28:30] poured into Christ and so that we could
[1:28:32] understand him so that we could see him
[1:28:34] so that we could have fellowship with
[1:28:35] him amen and everything that he did was
[1:28:38] glorifying the name of the father amen
[1:28:41] if there's anything you like about
[1:28:42] Nathan Erickson anything anything any of
[1:28:44] just Little attributes or things you're
[1:28:46] like I like that about brother Nathan
[1:28:48] well what is that doing that's
[1:28:49] glorifying it's testifying of a father a
[1:28:53] good father to raise the son and
[1:28:55] instilled him with certain attributes so
[1:28:57] the life of the son glorifies the father
[1:28:59] that's why Jesus cried out he said
[1:29:01] glorified father glorify thy name and
[1:29:04] the father answered from heaven with a
[1:29:06] thunder he said I have
[1:29:07] and I will
[1:29:11] I will glorify it again that's why you
[1:29:14] can't just make Jesus one-third of the
[1:29:16] Trinity no all that was in God he poured
[1:29:20] into Christ
[1:29:22] amen I'm going somewhere now brother
[1:29:24] Graham said you know he talked to that
[1:29:26] Jew he said and the man said you can't
[1:29:27] Chop God into three pieces and give him
[1:29:29] to a Jew he said oh no of course not but
[1:29:31] he said you listen Rabbi What relation
[1:29:33] would the Messiah be to God he said he
[1:29:37] will be God in other words everything
[1:29:39] that God is the Messiah is amen
[1:29:43] everything that was mysterious and God
[1:29:45] is revealed in the Christ now let me ask
[1:29:49] you something in the light of this
[1:29:50] evening message Amen in the in the
[1:29:52] looking in the mirror this revealed word
[1:29:54] what relation will the bride be to
[1:29:57] Christ
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:01] come on now are you gonna take the Holy
[1:30:04] Ghost and make chop that into one third
[1:30:06] of the Trinity oh it wasn't God he
[1:30:09] poured it to Christ but all that wasn't
[1:30:12] Christ he has poured into the bride
[1:30:18] What relation
[1:30:20] they will be Christ
[1:30:23] be him bone of his bone and flesh of his
[1:30:26] flesh
[1:30:27] Spirit of his spirit
[1:30:29] [Applause]
[1:30:32] damn
[1:30:33] [Applause]
[1:30:37] who are we we're God and morphe gotta be
[1:30:40] on a mask God in flesh again
[1:30:44] Jesus isn't coming he's here
[1:30:47] it's the bride coming of Christ
[1:30:51] you have his attributes you have his
[1:30:54] ministry you have his character you have
[1:30:56] his reputation
[1:30:59] you have his righteousness
[1:31:02] oh friends
[1:31:04] hey amen amen it's right now don't put
[1:31:09] this revival in a future time don't wait
[1:31:11] for the supernatural to fall it's here
[1:31:15] it's veiled in The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:19] that's why I don't listen to someone
[1:31:20] trying to teach adoption and take the
[1:31:22] supernatural out of the church
[1:31:25] it's the same Spirit of cessation of
[1:31:26] gifts the FF Bosworth withstood when he
[1:31:30] stood at the debate platform he said I
[1:31:31] only have one question
[1:31:33] do the seven compound names of Jehovah
[1:31:36] apply to Jesus Christ and a man couldn't
[1:31:39] say yes because if they did then he is a
[1:31:42] Healer and he couldn't say no because
[1:31:44] then if it's not he's not a savior but
[1:31:47] Jesus Christ was a Healer and he was a
[1:31:50] savior and he was a miracle worker and
[1:31:52] he was a comforter and it was our peace
[1:31:57] the bride is him amen then she will have
[1:32:00] every attribute
[1:32:02] have every characteristic
[1:32:04] she will have every gift she will
[1:32:07] perform every sign in the Great
[1:32:09] Commission
[1:32:11] she will do everything that he did she
[1:32:13] will live his life she will do his works
[1:32:15] she will lay hands on the sick and they
[1:32:18] will recover
[1:32:20] y because all that was in God
[1:32:22] poured into Christ
[1:32:24] and all that was in Christ
[1:32:26] he poured it into you
[1:32:30] amen now you don't have a fullness of
[1:32:31] godhead in your body but you're part of
[1:32:33] it
[1:32:34] that's what I'm trying to preach you
[1:32:36] today and get you to receive it and say
[1:32:38] I know there's big ministers I know
[1:32:40] there's pastors I know there's gifts I
[1:32:42] know there's singers
[1:32:43] but I'm part of this
[1:32:47] I'm part of this
[1:32:50] that's me
[1:32:59] now there may be somebody under the
[1:33:01] sound of my voice
[1:33:03] that for the first time in your
[1:33:05] religious life
[1:33:07] it has dawned upon you
[1:33:09] that this message you've been believing
[1:33:11] and this church and its lifestyle its
[1:33:14] traditions and beliefs that you've been
[1:33:16] associating with
[1:33:17] is not a personal revelation to you
[1:33:21] you just joined a church
[1:33:24] Homa
[1:33:25] and you say oh brother Nathan I've
[1:33:27] missed the whole thing
[1:33:30] but let me place you in the scripture so
[1:33:32] you can see right where you're at this
[1:33:33] morning
[1:33:36] you are the woman
[1:33:38] that got up one morning
[1:33:40] like any other morning
[1:33:42] she went down to the well
[1:33:45] she got up went to church
[1:33:48] that morning and went there and was
[1:33:50] going through the motions
[1:33:52] like any other day
[1:33:54] not realizing it was a special appointed
[1:33:57] time
[1:33:58] because there was a man there
[1:34:02] and when she got there she didn't
[1:34:03] realize whose presence she was in
[1:34:06] but he began to speak with her
[1:34:09] why because she was the one he was there
[1:34:12] for
[1:34:15] you he didn't go to the Sanhedrin he
[1:34:17] didn't go to the great religious leaders
[1:34:19] brother Brahm said they wouldn't have
[1:34:20] received him but she was in the
[1:34:22] condition even in that condition even
[1:34:24] that sinful life she was living
[1:34:26] she was the one in a condition to
[1:34:28] receive him that's why he came yes
[1:34:32] and could I say something real bold this
[1:34:34] morning that's why I came today
[1:34:36] because Jesus is standing in front of
[1:34:39] you Thomas with bleeding hands
[1:34:41] it's not the signs in the ministry of a
[1:34:43] man it's the voice of God speaking to
[1:34:45] you revealing Christ to you he has come
[1:34:47] to fellowship with you with that will
[1:34:50] and he takes his time a little bit
[1:34:52] just starts moving just starts getting
[1:34:55] her mind going
[1:34:57] starts talking about water he said give
[1:34:59] me a drink
[1:35:01] so you know she half-heartedly lift her
[1:35:03] hand like every other Sunday Kind of
[1:35:05] mumbled a song under her voice you know
[1:35:07] he said you know that water
[1:35:10] you've been drinking
[1:35:12] it's not really doing it for you
[1:35:15] that broken cistern
[1:35:18] that fix you've been running from church
[1:35:20] to church fixed to fix that little
[1:35:22] besetting sin that thing
[1:35:24] that's not satisfying
[1:35:27] amen oh my well he was about to give her
[1:35:30] a drink
[1:35:31] he was about to lead her to a water
[1:35:33] where she'd never thirst again
[1:35:35] he was about to give her a personal
[1:35:36] revelation
[1:35:38] and he said something so precious to her
[1:35:40] friends
[1:35:41] because you know right where your life
[1:35:42] is at you just like that woman any of us
[1:35:45] you know we brother bam said we
[1:35:47] backslide every day
[1:35:49] so we look at things in our life and we
[1:35:50] know it's not right and that woman knew
[1:35:52] that she wasn't right but she didn't
[1:35:53] know that he knew
[1:35:54] right until he came and personally
[1:35:57] to deal with her
[1:36:01] and he said you know you've been going
[1:36:02] from husband to husband
[1:36:04] Church to church fix to fix
[1:36:09] but the one you're with now
[1:36:12] that's not your husband
[1:36:16] now catch this personally now
[1:36:19] the one you're with now
[1:36:23] the one you're with now come on
[1:36:26] the one you're with now
[1:36:28] the one you're with now
[1:36:31] that's not your husband
[1:36:34] that's not who you are
[1:36:37] Oh my he came to reveal himself
[1:36:40] personally you because you didn't belong
[1:36:42] to those husbands
[1:36:43] you belong to him
[1:36:45] could we stand
[1:36:51] the one you're with now
[1:36:55] is not your husband you've got a new
[1:36:57] husband now
[1:36:59] you're bearing his name but if you've
[1:37:01] never had a new birth
[1:37:03] if you've never had Jesus Christ come
[1:37:05] personally into your life and make all
[1:37:07] this Christianity this message all this
[1:37:10] that we preach a reality to you
[1:37:13] he's here to fill you
[1:37:15] he's here to meet you
[1:37:17] I would invite you to come for prayer
[1:37:19] maybe you want to have faith in your
[1:37:20] seed but whatever it is don't go another
[1:37:23] day
[1:37:24] without walking in the personal
[1:37:26] revelation of Jesus Christ because
[1:37:27] that's the hour that we're living in is
[1:37:30] the Awakening of the Bride many will
[1:37:33] miss it but not you because God has come
[1:37:35] you know that he's dealing with your
[1:37:36] heart he's trying to tell you you're one
[1:37:38] of mine foreign
