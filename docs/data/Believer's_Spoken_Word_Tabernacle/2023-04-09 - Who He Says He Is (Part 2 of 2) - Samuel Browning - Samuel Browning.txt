========================================

as him there's someone that's greater and is one that I have need of and then that's what brings true repentance and abhorrence for our sins and walking into the Waters of baptism as a candidate I am a candidate I'm identifying I'm registering a claim on the policy to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because it produces more than a good life oh sure it produces a good life you can only you can live right around the church and live a good life but the Holy Ghost is more than you live in a good moral upright life are you hearing me the Holy Ghost itself is a life that's quickened by the word of God it's alive where Christ is your everything you friends it's one thing to say is but let the Holy Spirit look back down over your life and is he really everything in your life is he your all in all is he the one that you base every decision on is your life really on fire for god well brother Sammy I don't believe you've got to be on fire you do in order to go in the rapture and if you don't get on fire there'll be something come along and it'll take you right out come on friends and you won't be able to blame it on nobody else no job no situation listen it's between you and God not between you and your neighbor you and your husband you and your wife you and your family you and your church it's between you and God when you stand there that day nobody will be able to point a finger at anybody else and say well it's their fault nope it's between us and God I say let our lives display the wave sheath over our children waving what is it there's more to come let our lives be lived let the wave sheath be waved in our homes we're Christians here what are you doing when we're when we're praying we're giving ourselves to the Lord we're dedicating this home to God what are you doing we're waving the wave sheath we're announcing hey there's more that's going to come the same life that Daddy received the same life that Mama received the same quickening power that made this home a different home this quickening power that has raised our lives up into bread to newness again it's for you also that wave sheep being waved what's it declaring you're a policyholder oh through their teenage years of struggle but the wave she keeps on waving glory be to God what is it it's God being Vindicated in the lives of his people in the Associates on your job what are you doing every day when you live you're living your life unto the Lord what is it it's a ways sheep being waved it's the announcing that we are in the land the lamb that the word has spoken of what was promised to come when it's not coming we are here it has arrived and I'm a witness I am as the prophet called it a messenger of the Covenant of his grace that's right you are a messenger of the Covenant when you've been born of the spirit of God bless Marriotts Hallelujah oh my Hallelujah oh Jesus Hallelujah anyone want to be remembered in prayer as we go before the Lord in prayer Hallelujah he's appeared to you he's appeared personally to your life for a reason for a purpose let's just let's let's receive that let's take that in let's draw upon that benefit if you need the Holy Ghost draw upon that benefit right now this morning if you need salvation draw upon that benefit if you need healing draw upon that benefit if you need deliverance from a besetting sin draw upon that benefit this morning Heavenly Father Lord Jesus you are indeed who you say you are you declare yourself to be the same right here Among Us and in the hearts of your people you're still the same yesterday today and forever Lord my heart thinks of that song he's alive and well living in me to tell the world that is still the same Lord that's what you're declaring right here this morning that's what you declare in our homes that's what you declare Lord sometimes we don't even know why we've gotten moved to different Associates or we had to go from one store to a different store sometimes we don't understand all that Lord maybe sometimes our traffic is blocked this way and then we're going this way and we Lord that we recognize Lord Our Lives it's that Lord with every movement Let It Be Lord God under the unction of the rushing Mighty Wind of that wave sheath being waved in our lives Lord it changes how we Act it changes how we look we live different Lord here's a witness that comes in our lives that we have passed from Death unto life and oh God how there is just absolutely no greater manifestation of your Victory on Calvary and rising from the grave then the revealing of yourself in our lives and through our lives that's the victory the victory that Calvary and the resurrection has brought to us Lord for each need that's gathered here this morning hands that have been lifted and raised you know the benefit that Lord that is needed at this present moment in their life and we like Abraham like Isaac like each one of your children when you would make yourself known to them they would begin to Worship You Lord in that appearing and they would give themselves to you Lord Jesus so likewise Lord as you've said in your word David would utter with his voice from his heart bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me forget not the Lord and all his benefits I'm the Lord that forgiveth all that iniquities I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases glory be to God you're the same one Lord who restoreth my soul you're the same God who moves Lord and brings Deliverance and steal the Lord God makes real the policy to policyholders that God had no longer becomes something we are fellowshipping around something we just hold in our hand but it's something that comes into our hearts and it's got a hold of us [Music] I pray God this morning if there's one that doesn't know you in that way may they come to that place may this be a moment right here this morning that God no matter where that life and no matter what it is may it be a moment that as you've appeared to him may they not Lord God allow doubt to come in but may they worship you in your appearing and give themselves like that little mechanic who obeyed the voice of the chief engineer well maybe there's wires that they tried to hook up in their life they tried to make promises live but right now Under The Obedience and the authority of the Holy Spirit [Music] you're giving a direction in their heart on the inside says yea Lord be it unto me Lord according to Thy Word then Lord you know how to touch wire with what in each part or we want to obey you we want to move we want to go beyond doubts go beyond all that that's what you're appearing has come is to dismantle every doubt your appearing has come to dismantle every thought of unworthiness you're appearing to us personally lets us know who we are and what you think about us glory be to God in the highest caiaphasis when you Rose but you appeared to chosen ones who believed you already so lord it's not a random act this morning nor in any service when you come and make yourself known to your children the predestined plan of the foreknowledge of God [Music] Lord right here this morning prayers that have been troubled we want to draw upon the benefits of this policy [Music] we're not people who don't know the policy maybe there's some here this morning might be their first time I don't know but God if our names are included in that policy then the word has come appeared to us to minister the rights that belong to us as Sons and Daughters of God [Music] and father if there's anyone that's been robbed of being a son and daughter of God maybe there's been benefits that the enemy has wanted to keep from them but I pray right here this morning God may you move down lord God for every need that's here the enemy that's wanted to trouble him Lord about their past may I pray God the justifier this morning Lord God is in the building right now that you move right down lord God into that life granted Lord that perfect love to cast out all fear for you've not given us spirit of fear but of power of love and of a sound mind blessed be the name of the Lord you've quickened us Lord from Death unto life we were once dead in sin and trespasses but you came to us oh Jesus some of the places you found us and the conditions you found to sin Lord [Music] but you came to us glory be to God the conditions did not stop you from coming but it was because Lord you came to us and begin to deal with our hearts maybe Lord with some maybe it was a track that they read at first [Music] maybe it wasn't even a message track maybe Lord they had stumbled in Lord to a Baptist Church and they Lord God had just felt a pool to receive you as their lord and savior but there was a hunger hunger thing but there was something Lord God that was calling a yearning a desire something that Lord God could not even be explained but it was for more of you [Music] Lord I'm so glad that you have not left it to us to find our way I'm glad Lord even right here this morning Lord there might be situations Lord that lives and hearts can be so entrenched in Lord that they can look for an Avenue and a door and he looks around I don't see no door but oh God you're the same God who came in the fiery furnace Lord God and made a way you're the same God who came down lord in Daniel Lord with Daniel and the Lion's Den you made a way Lord [Music] granted Lord as you came to us in our lives we Are Witnesses I'm a witness Lord I know there's other Witnesses here this morning Lord testimonies of the grace of God but you came to me Lord you came to us and that appearing was to make known the purpose and the grace that lay in you before the foundation of the world now here we are Lord help us Lord help us to serve that purpose what do we realize that the main purpose that we're putting on Earth is to be filled with the Holy Ghost to be born again then out of that purpose we can serve your purpose whatever the other parts
