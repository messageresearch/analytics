so good to know that you can turn to the word of god and get a promise and the good thing about god's promises and what i what i've found what i've come to understand is that our doubt can't even stop god's promises from coming to pass our doubt may hinder it but it can't stop it when god speaks something it must come to pass and that's why i like the word says you said i believe and because you said it's already done hallelujah it was finishing god's mind once he spoke amen all we got to do is believe it receive it god bless you choir we really really appreciate that amen i am so happy to be

that would keep us in the midst of everything we're going through lord as we would just turn our attention towards the word of the lord today we pray that you would speak to us for the words of life that give us strength to keep pressing in this journey you know the needs of your people god here today i pray that you have blessed him abundantly thank you for the pastor of this great church lord his leadership and god is uh opening the pulpit to us on this morning i pray a special blessing upon our precious brother browning and his family goddess in jesus name we pray amen amen let's give the lord a hand of praise you don't mind uh standing with me i will read the word of the lord um you have to forgive me this morning i i gave a lot of my voice to the concert on yesterday the night of worship i should say we had a wonderful wonderful time and but uh i i just when it's said sunday morning service i said i really really really want to be here in sheffield so i'm glad it all worked out and uh and we're just we're just excited about what the lord has in store i trust that the sermon will be a blessing to you on today and i want you to just turn with me to matthew 27. amen praise the lord uh just a few verses uh here on matthew 27 we'll start at verse 62. amen says now the next day that followed the day of the preparation the chief priests and pharisees came together unto pilate saying sir we remember that that deceiver said or he was yet alive after three days i will rise again command therefore that the sepulcher be made sure until the third day lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people he has risen from the dead so the last error shall be worse than the first pilate said unto them ye have a watch go your way make it as sure as ye can so they went and made the sepulcher sure sealing the stone and setting a watch amen praise the lord the lord had a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated we want to take for our title today their rock is not like our rock praise the lord so um as we just kind of get started here i'm reminded of a sermon the prophet preached and uh i know my redeemer liveth and he was talking about a chaplain one easter morning was overseas and uh while they were overseas in battle this easter morning the troops many of them that were wounded were inside the red cross hospital and he said on this easter morning the chaplain saw a nurse come in to the red cross hospital and she had just roses that she was giving out to all the soldiers and as she was handing these rope these roses out to the soldiers the roses just i mean that the soldiers began to just go into tears crying amen after receiving this rose and what was moving these soldiers is that they knew the area that they were in uh pretty much everything there was um dissolved through some of the gases that were released in the uh in the in the in the war is you know no trees no grass no nothing but when they saw that red rose it actually gave them a hope they said in the land from where we come there's still some green grass amen there's still some trees there's still some things growing and i don't care how hopeless life may look like right here where i'm standing i know where i come from there's still some life hallelujah sometimes we find ourselves in situations like that we backslide from god and it seems like things are just very uh i mean just uh uh just bleak and uh we just can't get any we can't we don't see no life nowhere around us but if we can just get back into the presence of the lord we'll find somewhere where there's life amen praise god some people are still on fire for god some people are still living for god amen but you know as as as the story was going you know the uh the prophet said you know these soldiers were just crying because they they they knew these roses come from back home and he said you know what i just need to get out this this chaplain said i need to kind of separate myself from the people and i need to get out amen and i mean these these guys just crying i wanted to maybe get outside and there was one soldier saying you know i'm getting to take a little mission out to the front line and uh the chaplain said hey let me go out there he says i got to go out and just kind of observe some things that have happened and we got to give a report he's like he's like i'd like to go with you i like to ride with you he says now if you go with me you're taking your life into your own hands he says that's fine i'll take my life in my hands but i need to get out of this place and go out and see so as they were out riding and just observing and writing their report on what they would what they saw out there the chaplain said he felt led a man to go to a particular rock hallelujah amen and um you know he um he couldn't understand why the lord had led him to this rock hallelujah but as he went over to the rock amen and he started praying and said lord why did you lead me here to this rock then god just began to deal with him pick up the rock lift up the rock hallelujah amen just he says he says just he says he didn't understand why everything around him was bleak no trees no grass just everything is is absorbed but he says but pick up the rock and when he picked up the rock he looked underneath the rock hallelujah and there was an easter lily starting to bloom under the rock glory to god and what he realized is that no matter what the gases did to the grass and no matter what the gas did to the trees amen this easter lily was protected by the rock hey glory and i'm here to tell you easter lilies this morning you have been protected by the rock that's why you could not die in that accident that's why the devil can take you out in the hospital with that sickness you have been protected by the rock and i'm here to tell you their rock is not like our rock glory hallelujah amen amen amen my you know so here you know we as we go through this thought today we want to understand we have a rock we have a rock it's it's it's very sure it's very certain that we're standing on a rock amen and we find throughout the scriptures the the the use of rock or the reference of god being a rock it's all throughout the scriptures and i want to just pick up a couple of them today first samuel 2 and 2. amen i want to read that to you first samuel 2 and 2 it says this there is none holy as the lord amen for there is none beside thee it says neither is there any rock like our god i just love the word of god neither is there any rock like our god we also find in psalm 78 and 35 and they remember that god was their rock they remembered that god was their rock and the high god their redeemer also in isaiah 42 and 11 it says this let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice the villages that khadar doth inhabit let the inhabitants of the rock sing let them shout from the top of the mountain now you know as i as i read that scripture you know i say let the inhabitants of the rock sing you know a testimony that come to me um brother diggs was uh preaching and i and i heard him minister uh on something that he was saying how he went to uh canada i believe it was and he had he had some services and the pastor told him this has been covet you know i guess it's hard to say when covet was was like really really spreading because it's still spreading it's something we got to live with amen brother brother branham called it a pandemonic that's it's a quote in there it's a pandemonic right and uh and you'll find it it's just something we live with amen just like the flu we live with it praise god we're not afraid of it we live with it we're protected by a rock brother diggs was talking he said he was going to canada the pastor says you know brother i didn't know i think and i should have canceled the services because all the people got sick you know just just a lot of people got sick and said i don't know what to do here uh he's like brother it's okay let's just go on with the services whoever's there let's just go on and it says he says i'm not gonna get sick so he went on and start preaching and one night he start feeling a little something coming on his body and he says oh my i don't told the pastor i wasn't gonna get sick and say i don't know what this is that's happening he says he kind of got up in the middle of the night and he began to just start humming a song to the lord amen and as he began to sing that song to the lord it led him into another song and every song the anointing just began to race and then it went from a second song to a third song he was really into the spirit and before you knew it he had forgot about his illness he forgot about the symptoms that were come trying to come down the inhabitant of the rock begin to sing and i want to encourage you when you're going through sometimes you don't know what scripture to turn to sometimes you don't eat i mean you can get through you can you can get down so bad you don't even know how to pray praise the lord but if you can just find a song that you can get begin to sing god will elevate you your spirit will get elevated the inhabitant of the rock begins to sing and god will bring you out of whatever you're going through hallelujah daniel 2 45 says for as much as thou saw us that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and that it breaking pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold and the great god have made known to the king what should come to pass here after and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure so daniel saw a man there in uh in his vision that there was a stone a rock cut out of the mountain without hands see we we got we got referenced in scripture that god is our rock oh hallelujah brother branham says this in the message what was the holy ghost given for he says there's only one way to find it there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands that rolled into the world and smashed it out and it become like weed or chaff on the threshing floors let that stone the christ jesus that stumbling stone to the world a stone of an offense a laughing stone a stumbling block to the church but a precious and a load stone to the believer a stone of assurance a stone of rest oh my resting i know that i pass from death unto life my soul is at rest hallelujah it says oh come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden and i'll give you rest to your soul a sign that's to be evil spoken of and the prophet to marry it'll be a signed shirt will but it'll be an assurance it'll be a love it'll be a satisfaction it'll be something that you know you pass from death unto life this lodestone this rock is a loadstone to the believer and brother branham i mean when he says that the word lowstone means it's the focus of attention so christ is my focus of attention christ is my attraction the low stone is what the magnet is magnetized to and it's christ that we're magnetized to as a believer oh hallelujah we're magnetized to the rock amen i can't go anywhere without the rock [Music] i can't live without the rock praise his holy name i don't want to go to work without the rock i don't want to go to school without the rock i want to be attracted and attached to the rock everywhere i go [Music] we know david picked up a rock amen and he threw that rock at goliath and brother branham told us amen something in the statement says uh it says that rock was moving at a thousand miles per hour what man could pick up a rock and throw it at a thousand miles per hour no man can do that that means david picked up a supernatural rock hey hallelujah david had a supernatural rock that would take out his goliath and i'm here to tell you got the same supernatural rock that'll take out your goliath a goliath of sickness a goliath of unbelief use your supernatural rock what is that it's the rock of revelation glory to god brother branham was preaching the message uh shalom and and uh when he when when he picked this sermon up to preach it he took a scripture out of psalm 62 and let's just go and read that psalm 62. oh glory glory glory the scripture just references rocks all over god being a rock amen here in psalm 62 truly my soul waiteth upon god from him cometh my salvation look at this look at david what he says he only is my rock [Applause] oh church you know this this really means something to me amen when when david um uh can say this you know let's just keep reading i'll get to it a little bit later says he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense oh my goodness my goodness my goodness you know i was gonna say let me just release it just i want you to get david's words he only is my rock go back in david's life and there was a time where he was on the run from saul praise god and as he's running from saul a man david runs into a cave and as he's trying to hide from saul it just so happened that saul comes into the same cave it was so dark in that it couldn't see each other but i can just imagine david didn't want to sneeze david didn't want to david did not want to give away his position and even one of david's men said you know the lord has led your enemy right into your hands he says if you let me go i'll smite him right now and you won't you won't hear from him ever again he says no i can't touch the lord's anointing so i believe he just made me cut a little piece of his garment or something like that and before you know it a saul rose up and walked outside of the cave and when he walked out david yelled from inside the cage and said saul why are you seeking after me and david realized that it was not hallelujah amen it was not the cave that was his rock [Applause] because the enemy came into the cave [Music] so this is why david could write it was not the case i was hiding from my enemy inside the cave but the enemy came into my cave but god delivered me from my enemy and that's why i can say he only is my rock sometimes we trust in so many other things but we should only trust in god he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defense i shall not be moved let's look at what david is writing to us how long will you imagine mischief against the man ye shall be slain all of you as a bowing wall shall you be and has a tottering fence they only consult to cast him down from his excellency they delighted lies they blessed with their mouth but they cursed inwardly salah my soul wait thou only upon god hallelujah for my expectation is from him here david says it again he only i'm not dependent on my boss i'm not dependent on amen what the doctor has to do and what he's recommending hey he only is my rock [Applause] he only is my rock and and it's a conjunction word that means david is thinking about this he's my rock and my salvation glory he is my defense i shall not be moved and god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god then he encourages us trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us salah amen surely men of low degree are vanity men of high degree are alive to be laid in the balance they are all together lighter than vanity trust not in oppression amen and become not vain and robbery if riches increase set not your heart upon them god has spoken once twice have i heard this that power belongeth to god [Music] also unto thee o lord belong with mercy for thou rendrest to every man according to his work i love the way david just kept focusing and talking about how god only was his rock that's the way we have to have to come god only is a rock sometimes our family is our rock when we get into a little tight spot we need some money we know to go to a certain family man by a certain friend and then sometimes when they don't have it god leaves you in a place where you have to depend on him and he's always wanted you in that place where he only was your rock when we look at this rock amen uh let me uh oh yes let me just get this one right here oh my god my god my god here um the prophet said something here in the message the contest it says it's a prayer to these prayers he says make us fit servants forgive our past bless our future guide us o lord god with thy mighty hand jehovah bless these ministers here bless all the laity all the visitors be thou with us lord we are your servants and we give ourselves holy to you who says for 1963 i can say for 2022 amen that the power of your spirit might have more preeminence in our life and in our being help us god forgive us and help us we pray raise up mighty men raise up mighty warriors of the faith it says open this year lord that hidden manna that rock beneath the rock that we might see the program of god cap off the pyramids of our life lord put the capstone christ jesus upon each and every one of us may his great magnificent holy blessings be upon us all may the fire of the holy ghost come upon us may the power of the resurrection be manifested god how we thank you tonight we're yours we give ourselves fully to you lord open to us the rock beneath the rock i was listening to brother eugene braun preached one time and he made a statement you know that as i was coming here today i can see so many churches and a lot of a lot of cars and parking lots and things that nature people going to church on sunday but uh but brother eugene made this statement he says everybody praise god that's going into the church most of them are going to have a bible most of them going to go a lot of them got it i mean it still is the the most sold book in in the world the bible everybody got one hallelujah but it's more than just having a bible what we need god to do is open the rock beneath the rock amen see what it is is that everybody amen is not looking through a prophetic lens so when it when they're reading the scriptures they're still blinded to some things praise god amen they have what we call a public manner it's what we call everybody has a bible it's called public manner but when you begin to look through a prophetic lens you get the hidden manner the rock beneath the rock and that's why i'm saying their rock is not like our ride [Applause] [Music] let's look at some hidden manner turn with me to deuteronomy 32. verse 1 says give ear o ye heavens and i will speak and hear o earth the words of my mouth deuteronomy 32 verse 2 my doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the dew as a small rain upon the tender herb and as it showers upon the grass and i love this because i will publish that mean i'm going to tell people about it because i will publish the name of the lord ascribe ye greatness unto our god look at what moses says he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways of judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right as he now now there are some things happening here in the book of deuteronomy uh you know we know that this is two laws i believe amen is what it means and uh and and so there's uh you know a a blessing for those that are honoring or and obeying god's word but then there's a curse to those that will disobey god's word right so here moses is warning the people and he said he he i'm gonna publish and i'm gonna just ascribe greatness to my god i wanna tell everybody about my rock now we get down into verse 18. i'm just skipping here as we read this verse 18 says of the rock that begot thee thou are unmindful some people forget where they came from they forget how the rock actually protected them they forget how the rock guided them and i mean the rock has been everything we needed but they forget that end times amen other rocks that begot thee thou are unmindful and has forgotten god that form thee never forget your rock skip down to verse 30 verse 30 and chapter 32 how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand till flight except their rock had sold them and the lord had shut them up the next verse for their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges now you can see where the title comes from right out of the scripture their rock is not as our rock even our enemies themselves being judges let's go back to verse 30 though some hidden manna now how should one chase a thousand and two put ten thousand to flight except their rock had sold them now what does it mean for your rock to sell you oh hallelujah amen i was just looking this up in the hebrew lexicon and what it what it meant is that the rock had to be given over to death so if your rock sold you then it means your rock was willing to die for you a a rock that is willing to die for you is not a normal rock this is again another supernatural rock a rock that is willing to die for me a rock that can protect me a rock that can keep me god let me stand upon that rock [Music] i love this rock you see um and you know this is where i i i want to just kind of get back to the scripture that we're reading because we had a rock there in matthew as i took it from matthew 20 uh uh 26 but you know if we would just kind of pick up these these people were trying to make it as sure as they could right here they here they they're coming to the uh the religious leaders that they come into pilots like you know what we heard that deceiver say that he would rise again in three days now if they didn't believe in him why are they there trying to make the the the tomb sure if they didn't believe what he said they had already amen came up in their own minds as to what the disciples were gonna do they're gonna steal them then they're going to start telling everybody that he rose again oh hallelujah amen but let's pick it up amen uh just just um we're going to pick this up over here in matthew 28. oh my give me verse 1. i just want to tell you uh the story oh i thank god i got we got a supernatural rock a rock that was willing to die for us look at this in matthew 28 says in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulcher amen and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it i like the way this reeds you see our rock was hidden behind a rock and they were trying to make it sure they had they had soldiers all positioned around it first they sealed the rock and then they put they put soldiers all around the rock to to make sure that the disciples couldn't get to it oh hallelujah but but but here's the thing amen they could not stop the prophecy from coming to pass with all of their natural efforts amen when god was ready to raise jesus he sent down an angel hey when god is ready to raise you he will send you an angel when god is ready to elevate you he will send something supernatural you will find out that their rock is not like you're wrong there rock was doing one with the seal on it but our rock was behind their rock but when the angel came down and moved their rock they found out their rock was not like our rock our rock was willing to die our rock was willing to rise again our rock oh jesus thank god for a rock like this our rock is our healer our rock is our deliverer our rock is our waymaker hey it's our rock oh hallelujah hallelujah he said i believe he said it is done so we we see this in scripture you know i won't uh i won't i won't i'll just get to just want to get you to uh verse 11 amen in this the angel rolled it away and and now these these these soldiers that were supposed to guard it they they and from my understanding they had hundreds of them hundreds of them and they're they're working 24-hour shifts they make they made it sure that the disciples did not get in here and and take the body out and then start telling this lie that he rose again they tried to make it sure some of your parents have uh young young young children that might be wayward and they're trying their best to amen to make sure that they'll never come back into the church they get involved in this and they get involved in that and they try to make it sure but i'm here to tell you you don't have to worry about that parent you ain't got to fight with them you got to wrestle with them all you have to do is remind them of what god said in his words and what god told me is that if i was baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of my sins he said i would receive the holy goats and then he said the promise is unto me and to my children those that are far off as men as the lord our god shall call and that's why i say don't wrestle with them don't fight with them just remind them say are you my child then it's not even up to you it's up to what i believe in the word of god hey i'm standing on a rock and i will not be moved by this verse 11 these soldiers have their own testimony of what happened it says now when they were going behold some of the watch see this is the soldiers leaving some of the watch came into the city and showed them to the chief priests all the things that were done here they're going to the priests and telling them what happened he rose again the soldiers are telling look there was an angel came down all of us was out nobody was able to do nothing with this i don't know who y'all fighting but y'all need to stop fighting this i believe the soldiers begin to testify hey this thing is real you better leave it alone he says he is rich and i'm here to tell you that verse 12 says that when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers emptied out their bank accounts you can understand this right now if i'm a soldier i'm not a jew i don't even have any this is not even to me i don't even know what this is all about says but if you're going to pay me to lie i'll do that i'll take the money but i'ma still tell people what happened you know why look you can't money cannot change what really happened it is no amount of money that can change that i was there when the stone was rolled away [Music] [Applause] i saw the glory of god coming down you can't take that out of me now if you don't want me to share that in your churches i won't come to your church but i am coming to i'm going to my house and i'm going to tell them what happened to me i'm going into my country and i'ma tell them and i'm gonna use your money to go spread it [Applause] oh jesus hey don't fight the rock all right all right say in verse 13 saying say say he say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept now you know you got to understand one of the brothers was sharing me in my church he says uh he had heard that the the those roman soldiers um if they ever got caught sleeping on a shift that was a death sentence so you got all these roman soldiers ain't no they did not not now the jews want them to lie and tell them that the disciples stole my white no y'all made it sure as y'all could all of us out there everybody didn't fall asleep maybe one or two but not not it's hundreds of us not everybody felt if you all want to believe that and you want to pay us to tell that we'll take the money and we'll still tell them the truth and if this comes to the governor's ears we will persuade him and secure you now i'm going to tell you something if i was one of the soldiers look you couldn't even secure this how are you going to secure me you fighting the wrong battle rather than fight the rock yield to the rock [Applause] surrender to the rock [Music] [Applause] so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is commonly reported among the jews until this day i can see him spreading two stories now this is what they told me to say i had to get money for this but now i'm gonna tell you what really happened this rock in scripture um we want to pick it up over here in exodus in a second this rock means a vast mass of stone and they say as the famous rock of horror and we find that in exodus uh 17 6 amen this this um this this rock amen is a vast mass of stone and i want to uh also just mention that when we when we say god is my rock we're saying god is the author and the source of all my blessings oh i love that god is the often the source of all my blessings this is why david can write things like the lord is my shepherd god is my help he's the source and of all my blessings he's my deliverer he's my provider he's my protector amen he's my king he's my savior he's my hope he's my redeemer he's my way out of no way he's my burden bearer he's my heavy load sharer he's my keeper he's my healer he's my strength he's my source he's my peace he's my all in all see when we pick up over here that this vast mass stone as the famous rock of horror let's pick it up in uh exodus 17. i'm gonna start reading at verse three so we get the the gist of this the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured this is the children of israel going through uh the wilderness let's catch this now they're going through the wilderness and the people murmured against moses and said wherefore is this that thou has brought us up out of egypt to kill us and our children and cattle with thirst and moses cried unto the lord saying what shall i do unto this people they'd be almost ready to stone me all right my and it says in the lord said unto moses go on before the people and take with thee of the elders of israel and there are where thou smote is the river take in thy hand and go behold i will stand before thee there upon the rock in horeb and thou shalt smite the rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and moses did so on the side of the elders of israel here's another one that's very strange how many of you all would leave here today and take a stick and go outside and hit a rock and expect water to come out most of us would not do that and this was a great challenge to moses but moses was obedient god put them in a situation where they could recognize something they'd never seen before and god says take your the same rod that you've been using and and down in egypt you got that right now take it and i'm going to stand on the rock now if he was not standing on the rock the rock would have never did what it was supposed to do but there was something supernatural happen with god standing on top of the rock once moses obeyed and just struck the rock water came gushing out verse seven says he called the name of the place my samara because of the childing of the children of israel because they tempted the lord saying is the lord among us or not some of us do the exact same thing we go from one trial to the next is the lord with me or not he proved himself in the last trial there's no need to question that maybe it's an opportunity for you to start exercising amen who you are in christ because later on this week we realized that uh moses got to a situation where that same rock god said you know speak to the rock this time but he went and tried to strike the rocky structure twice and got in trouble with god miss going into the promised land so so maybe god is trying to elevate you to get you to speak to your rod here's the a good thing about this moses struck the rock and when he struck the rock water came gushing out now watch what brother branham says here in the message ever-present water from the rock he says now we find out this calvary that they had and the waters of life gushed forth for the people now some people has upon their hearts and mind that all israel drank and that they packed up the camels and tied their hitches on their horses and so forth and took their kids and journeyed on into somewhere else and left the rock there sprinkling catch this now he says maybe people think that when moses struck the rock water came out all the people came gather around the the the rock got the water got the animals they got water and everybody just left the rock they're sprinkling they went on the journey brother adam said no that's not what happened they may say that is wrong he says the rock followed them [Applause] the rock followed them and the water followed them now this has got to be a supernatural rock have you ever seen a rock following somebody this is not your normal rock but maybe this is the rock beneath the rock hallelujah that rock followed them and that that that water followed them it says now in corinthians the 10th chapter i believe in the 11th verse you can find it that the rock followed israel wherever they went from that day henceforth the rock went with them and the waters followed them now you know i was um uh let me see here let me just make sure yes let's keep reading he says what a beautiful type a beautiful hold and an anchor for the believer today that knows that the rock was once smitten that water that once poured forth from calvary goes with us wherever we are amen oh my it's not go go back to a certain place and say well we did have water day before yesterday over there we got water today right here because that rock was christ and christ is the same yesterday today and forever see that rock followed israel they never followed the rock but the rock followed them i want you to just just just just bear with me even in some desperate situations you're gonna find that the rocks still follow them and even we get into some desperate times ourselves we will realize the rock is always there it says israel went on a journey but they had one thing to do that's keep the straight course right straight on the promised land the rock and the water followed them the rock following them first corinthians tells you so the temp chapter all right the rock was christ then when brother branham said go find it i said wow you say the rock followed them i said i need to find this one he said go to first corinthians 10. i did he said go find it i did it's right there let's look at it in the scripture i thank god for prophetic insight and there's many times i read this scripture and just never saw it no i just read it and just never thought anything about it until the prophet just kind of takes a magnifying glass [Music] and it says the rock followed them and and here's another thing i want i want to get to you before i read it i'm glad that when brother branham went beyond the curtain of time and uh and angel was showing them all around say look at all these people you know he say all these brands say no no no these are your converse he's like wow he says he says i want to see jesus he says no you can't see him right now he'll come to you and he'll judge you for the things that you preach to the people you know and he said he says well is uh uh is paul here he said yeah paul is here is his people here yeah they're here he says well i preached the same thing paul preached and said millions screamed out we're resting on that and when i found this particular quote i say he did preach the exact same thing paul preached because paul wrote corinthians brother branham didn't just come up with this on himself he said what paul said the rock followed them if the rock was moving back then it's still moving today [Applause] [Music] because he's the same yesterday today and forever first corinthians 10 verse one let's read it read it we'll read it fast moreover brethren i would not that ye should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized unto moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank up that spiritual rock [Music] the spiritual rock that followed him we're not talking about a natural rock we're talking about a spiritual rock that they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was christ brother branham preached the same thing that paul preached [Applause] we got a rock here church we got ourselves a rock and the good thing this rock never leaves you never for you sometimes you walk off without the rock but even when you leave the rock the rock is right behind you sometimes all you have to do is just turn and speak to the rock he's always there [Music] i'm trying to i'm trying i'm trying to i'm trying to rush i gotta i gotta read something to you i just i just sold so many things here uh let me let me slide up all right y'all a good church this is a good church to preach at i tell you oh glory to god we realize the rock was christ let's turn to another scripture here in second kings chapter 3. actually um while you turn to that i'm just reading a couple quotes brother ram says this in the message corinthians book of correction it says how this rock land there god had a rock that had stored full of water just a little rock perhaps no bigger than that desk you can get the size of the rock now he's telling you the rock is about the size of a desk it says but when moses smoked this rock there was enough water come from it to water two million people and not only that but as many cattle and sheep and things as they had with them it says oh when i see some of these artists who paint pictures of a little drop falling out of a rock and a kid standing there a little bucket and saying he says oh it never come like that he says it come out by bountiful gushers can i ask you a question this morning are you ready for the bountiful gushers of god's blessings so much you cannot even contain it oh it never come like that it come by bountiful gushes gushing out it watered over two million people besides their camels and and all their animals that rock was christ jesus a beautiful type a beautiful parallel to john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth him should not perish but have eternal life now he goes on and says this and notice what happened the only way they could get the water out of the rock judgment rod had to strike the rock the only way to get water out of the rock is the judgment rod had to strike her on donald we can get water from our rock judgment had to strike at calvary and because the judgment rod struck now we can get all the blessings you know your healing was laying at calvary your salvation was laying at calvary your rock was at calvary that rock the judgment rod had distracted the rock and moses smoked the rock and god's judgment struck upon the rock and when it did it gave forth his waters the people were absolutely god was just and let them die because they had but disbelieved him they're dishonored dishonorable they were reprobates they they did not deserve to live moses called them rebels rebellious against god and they deserve to die and all of us deserve death because we're rebellious against god correct notice we all deserve dying but god is so merciful he should have he should never thought of us but he was so merciful till he took the sins of every one of us and struck it upon his own beloved son christ that we might not perish but we would have eternal life we're going to see israel in a place where they were so disobedient and and their history just i i'll say like this their history reminds me a lot of us we do a lot of things in our life the same way they did in the scripture right and we find them in second second kings chapter three and i wanna i'm gonna start at verse 10 but before i get i'm just kind of trying to simplify this we wanted to set this up jehoram was the son of ahab and he was leading the kingdom of israel he was the king of the kingdom of israel he was upset that the moabites rebelled against israel and stopped sending their lambs and their rams and their wool things like that he got upset so he asked jehoshaphat to go with him and join him in a battle all right now what we find in scripture and i won't have time to read it we're going to start at verse 10 it says they went seven days journey without any water for the soldiers i need you to understand i think you can only go so many days without water and you might die i think it's like 14 or 15 days or something like that you'll die so if they've already gone out seven days no water if they turn around and go back it's still another seven days before they would find water so they are they found themselves in a very desperate situation now this is the son of ahab who was the worst king in israel right amen uh he brought all types of idolatry in you know so so so here uh uh uh uh um with with this this this man being here he said i want to go get uh joshua join me in in battle and we're gonna go out here and and defeat more uh the more bites let's pick it up in verse 10. um should have turned there myself i'm sorry second kings chapter uh three and verse ten glory to god give me one second actually you've got it down the screen i'll follow you um all right it says and the king of israel said alas that the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab but jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of the lord by him see they left out without inquiring by the lord they just went out on their own right he says but is there a prophet of the lord that we may inquire of him he says and one of the king of israel's servants answered see not now joram is not saying who's there he knows who is there but one of the service answers said here is elisha the son of shafat which poured water on the hands of elijah now you know elisha represents us glory to god and verse verse 12 jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him people know who to call when they need something the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him oh my my my let's keep reading and man he says in elijah said unto the king of israel what have i to do with thee now ain't that something you go on to try to get something from the prophet and you get a stern rebuke what have i to do with thee get thee to the prophets of thy father unto the prophets of thy mother and the king of heaven said unto them name for the lord hath called these three kings together to deliver them into the hand of moab now his words is not changing the mind of the prophet look at this elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth before whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah it was jehoshaphat that said is there a prophet and god god knew jehoshaphat said that so elijah said if it wasn't for jehoshaphat see some people bless because you're present i would not look toward see the keep reading keep reading keep reading and like he says but now bring me a minstrel and it came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him keep going he says and he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of for thus saith the lord you shall not see when neither shall ye see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water that you may drink both ye and your cattle and your beasts verse 18 and we'll stop here and this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand [Applause] i like to call that the and blessing the first blessings that there will be water in the valley the second blessing is that your enemies will testify your enemies will be defeated before you take me back to verse 17. keep that one on the screen while i read this quote to you the scripture says you will not see wind neither shall you see rain yet that valley shall be filled with water no wind no rain but yet there's going to be water rock beneath the rock looking at it through a prophetic lens let's see what a prophet says about this scripture in the message make the valley full of ditches he says you know someone told me not long ago said brother bran the music in the church is wrong i said it is i said do you think god changes in nature no he said i said then what when the prophet got all stood up and they said bring me a minstrel and when the minister began to play the handle lord came upon the prophet and the music brought the power of god then it'll bring the power of god now that's just exactly god steal the same god seeing the prophet you might not be a prophet but you can just be a minstrel or you can be part of it anyhow to bring the power of god your prayers can bring the power of god your fasting can bring the power of god your music can bring the power of god he says they started to pray amen and elijah got in the spirit and he saw a vision how he said uh and when he when he saw the vision he said go out yonder in that desert right where you're at and go to digging ditches and dig them out for thus saith the lord you'll not hear any wind any rain but there'll be water that'll come from the way of the wilderness why here's a prophetic lens why where'd that water come from he says from that rock that smitten rock that was in the wilderness that's right he says it was back there somewhere even in the desert situation the rock was still following him seven days without water but the rock was still following him seven is the number of completion the church has been wandering for seven church ages but we have found the rock praise god their rock is not like our rock [Applause] the water is still gushing from the rock revelation after revelation is pouring out we're getting water from the rock no wind no rain where did they get the water from from the same rock that was following them it took them seven church ages to figure out figured out that the rock was following them [Music] it was back there somewhere it says it might have been covered up but there was a smitten rock in there that moses smote coming through the wilderness and that's that smitten rock still lays yonder two to be touched tonight or today the waters of life here we see moses strike the rock the rock's giving out water and here we pick him up all the way over in second kings and mo and moses strikes in brother branham i mean when you read it there in exodus it never told us that the rock was following them paul picked that up and told us that the rock was following them and even brother branham saw it there in the scriptures said people think that they just got some water and drunk it and then said we had water yesterday and we had no no no no no no they didn't have to go back even to that same spot they had to keep moving on from there no and the rock was going to follow we saw the rock it was laid behind a stone but in three days that rock got up again because our rock was willing to die for us he got up from there and amen and he's still moving today there's a statement that brother branham makes and brothers if you all could just give me that picture i i usually have a little timer here on my phone so i don't preach too long and unfortunately my uh using the gps to come here i don't know why i didn't get any juice on my phone but it ran out it's the phone is done [Applause] but um this picture that i wanted to show you is brother branham and his son joseph there in arizona and they are on this rock and the rock is like the pillar fires there on the rock as well their hand raised raised up now let me preface this by saying this there are uh people that were with brother branham and there were things that were told to them that brother branham never actually put on tape now uh and some some people out i'll admit i think some have some far-fetched things uh you know i i get that so we can't go with everything but i want to say this let's not discredit everybody's testimony just because it wasn't on the tape all right let's let's not do that and i i i know there's a balance that we have to find here because some people might have a reason why they're telling you certain testimonies right but but but but don't discredit it because here's the way that i i'm able to kind of look at things uh there are some people just based on what i read in the message or listen to on the tape there are some some people can share testimonials like you know what i believe that because that's like the same nature what i hear on the tape that that's that that's that's the same i i might not be able to find the exact quote but that sounds right because of it it kind of flows it's got the same spirit right and that's how i'm able to balance it so i want to say this you know i preached this sermon you know at my church and after i preached it my song lady got up and he he made a statement it says um he was talking about this picture he said brother branham said that was the same rock that moses struck i said what so he said brother doug mchugh's i believe was a minister that was out there uh he he went to be prayed for by well not well they were out hunting brother brandon said he asked brother do you pray for people why are you out here i know you're out here trying to rest and relax but do you pray he says brother hold on god caught a vision prayed for him told him something about his mother and everything like that and and then he also told that brother says you know that that that picture that was the same rock that's what he told brother dover hughes now you can't find the quote where it says directly that but i will read you something out of the message to help bring a balance so you understand what the prophet said this is coming out of the message ever present water no i'm sorry i'm sorry the unveiling of god is coming from the unveiling god moses one time desired to see god god told him to stand on the rock and on the rock moses stood and he seen god pass by and his back looked like the back of a man god was in a whirlwind and and while moses while moses standing on the rock and look because sometimes we get into the semantics of this look if moses was standing on the rock and brother brahman says something about that rock that he's standing on and i told you that the rock moved that horror this must be the same rock yes sir brother branham says this i guess you all seen the picture out there the other day we stood by that same rock [Applause] and here is that light the angel of the lord right there where it clapped standing is right on the bulletin board there now again if the rock moved in moses day and the rock moved in jesus dead then the rock is still moving today and i know brother branham is not here but i believe we still have that same rock and their rock is not like our rock [Music] god richly bless you [Music] oh this message has been thoroughly vindicated church no doubt about it [Applause] we thank god for this rock that we have i tell you pick it up they might have they have they have public manner but not hidden manner hidden manner you have to look at it through the eyes of a prophet if a prophet would have told us i know i upon you father we thank you for your word thank you for speaking to us we know god that um these things still come because we want them it's because you annoyed us and god i believe that the timing was right i was finished with my sermon and you would rise up lord just to vindicate what was being spoken you knew exactly what the people needed to hear you've proven yourself once again you are the same yesterday today and forever thank you god that you still move thank you that you still live thank you for a church that has been placed in order father i just thank you for what i see here in the midst of these people you are alive oh glory to god you're real jesus and you want to manifest yourself in your people we would just yield to the rock just yield to it don't fight against it but yield to it you can do great things lord i put your blessings upon this congregation lord the pastor and god as we read the quote a little early that you raised up mighty men i believe he's one of those mighty men but i pray lord that you also give him the help that he needs lord you know the help that he needs here in this church raise them up with god may we all find our place in you may we step into the vision and do all that you've called us to do lord jesus we give you the praise we give you the honor we give you the glory but truly you are worthy to be praised amen amen thank you jesus glory to your name father oh my god and lift them up [Music] for i have not the strength to praise you need enough for i
