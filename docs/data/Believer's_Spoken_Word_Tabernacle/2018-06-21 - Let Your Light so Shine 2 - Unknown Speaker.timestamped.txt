[4:43] I come down the year before last
[4:46] November for stage cancer the rarest
[4:49] cancer of all cancers one of them 70,000
[4:52] people get it and I was completely
[4:54] covered the Lord God spared me and
[4:58] brought me home to be with my people and
[5:02] [Music]
[5:03] I'm just so happy I want to first
[5:07] testify about my dad you know the Lord
[5:10] had been putting on me for this whole
[5:11] last month that if brother if our
[5:16] brother Sammy calls a little line for us
[5:19] to be prayed and that was my cue to go
[5:21] up and bless the Lord a black the
[5:24] devil's eye well daddy got up and went
[5:28] behind me when brother Samuel called yet
[5:30] I knew then it was time to black the
[5:33] devil's eye so we had this big line and
[5:37] brother Samuel never does that so that
[5:40] was not a coincidence that was the Lord
[5:42] let me know it is your time well I get
[5:46] in the line and I told brother Samuel I
[5:49] said Samuel they have diagnosed me with
[5:52] cancer again my ovaries covers let that
[5:55] lymphoma
[5:56] I said but I know that's a lie of the
[5:58] devil I said and I'm up here just to
[6:00] testify to him and let you know that I
[6:03] said I want me and you to pray together
[6:05] and just black his eye and brother
[6:08] Samuel just jumped back just smiling
[6:10] ear-to-ear cuz you know God is his word
[6:14] you know and it's like I told daddy
[6:17] today our Lord God had to believe his
[6:19] own word so how much more do we have to
[6:21] believe what we speak but anyways daddy
[6:25] was healed he has completely healed from
[6:28] his lung problems
[6:30] he's been acting like my old dad
[6:33] and I am so thankful I'm so thankful
[6:36] that we got a mighty God well today I
[6:40] went to the doctor they did the second
[6:42] ultrasound on me the doctor walks in and
[6:46] she's smiling away and and she's like uh
[6:50] you're not gonna believe this
[6:52] she said there is not nothing on your
[6:54] ovary no math no nothing I gave them a
[7:00] boy to the war and I knew in my heart
[7:04] that you know I knew I was healed
[7:08] the Lord God didn't just heal me to
[7:10] bring me down here for nothing but how
[7:13] does he want to get glory our Father if
[7:15] he don't put things on us you know it's
[7:19] to us he gets the victory so I just want
[7:22] to let everybody know that I have no
[7:24] cancer that doctor said whatsoever and
[7:28] she was she was in total shock she could
[7:31] believe in herself so I just wanted to
[7:34] let everybody know how God how good our

[31:43] many other needs that were still praying
[31:45] for I talked with talk to us today with
[31:48] brother Alexander McGillis and brother
[31:51] Alexander he's he's feeling better he
[31:56] the thing that's bothering him right now
[31:58] is those incisions they made on him he
[32:00] had an incision is about a foot long
[32:01] where they drained him three liters off
[32:04] his lungs and then he has multiple other
[32:07] incisions are about an inch and those
[32:09] are the things that's really bothering
[32:10] him right now and and so let's just
[32:13] remember him in prayer that the Lord
[32:16] would just continue to to strengthen him
[32:19] and give him strength in his body so

[35:40] men light a candle and put it under a
[35:43] bushel but on a candlestick and it
[35:47] giveth light unto all that are in the
[35:49] house let your light so shine before men
[35:53] that they may see your good works and
[35:57] glorify your father which is in heaven
[36:01] amen may God bless you and bless the
[36:04] reading of the words your being seated
[36:05] tonight I want you just to think of each
[36:08] part of this of the scripture here
[36:11] everything is we know that this
[36:14] scripture is is made mention in two of
[36:18] the other Gospels and we see how that
[36:20] the very purpose of the light itself
[36:23] even where the Lord Jesus would would
[36:26] speak to us and admonish us I what a
[36:29] responsibility anything the word would
[36:31] speak to us it there's a responsibility
[36:34] that comes with it and when saying you
[36:37] are the light of the world we know that
[36:39] there must be if there is a candle to be
[36:42] lit then it shows that not only is there
[36:45] a source to light it present but there
[36:48] must be something that is able to be lit
[36:51] and when you look at this of how that in
[36:55] all of this that is placed here there's
[36:58] a placement also that is that is set
[37:01] forth and we get to looking at it it's
[37:03] dealing with our life that our life
[37:05] would be a display for others and we
[37:09] know that when we look at this in
[37:11] thinking of in terms of the word that
[37:14] eternal life itself is living for others
[37:17] and the light itself when the Lord Jesus
[37:19] would would speak this year that no man
[37:22] lights a candle and puts it under a
[37:24] bushel but he's rather it's put on a
[37:27] candlestick this is a divine placement
[37:30] and we know that candlestick
[37:32] is Christ himself it's to be placed
[37:34] within the body of the word bad baptized
[37:38] into one into that one body by one
[37:40] spirit
[37:41] so it's an illumination it's a light
[37:43] it's God's light himself that is shining
[37:46] through and is illuminated our hearts
[37:49] and our lives and to think that the
[37:51] purpose remember the purpose is that our
[37:54] lives itself is to point people to the
[37:57] source to Christ himself that's their
[38:00] various gods God is declaring within
[38:03] this hour it's just like a messenger
[38:05] when God sends that messenger the
[38:07] messenger points you he will declare
[38:10] that reality and point you to that
[38:12] reality that lays there behind that veil
[38:15] and that's the same thing that we're
[38:17] when we look at the display with that
[38:19] that is to be displayed through our
[38:21] lives as we were looking at that last
[38:23] week that it's to point people to a
[38:25] living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:28] and I look at this and I think of how
[38:31] the scripture says a city that is set on
[38:33] a hill you know when you look at a city
[38:35] a city as a place that's inhabited you
[38:38] you you'll never you can never drive by
[38:40] a city and not know that you've been by
[38:43] a city as a matter of fact the city
[38:45] itself is a place that you can actually
[38:47] begin to see from a distance there is
[38:49] light and light that shines within it it
[38:52] isn't just something a city is not
[38:53] something that when you just come upon
[38:56] it you say oh well we're in a city but
[38:58] there it actually has an illumination
[39:01] that that is lit up and to think of how
[39:03] that the Lord Jesus would even describe
[39:06] this that it's a city not set in a
[39:08] valley but a city that is set on a hill
[39:10] once again it speaks of positioning the
[39:14] word itself when the word itself it not
[39:17] only positions us in Christ but God
[39:20] knows exactly what he has for each of
[39:22] our lives and where we are to be
[39:24] positioned in this life and to think of
[39:27] it the whole positioning is so that our
[39:29] lives the light itself would shine
[39:31] through and I think about this of the
[39:33] city and and that that is set on a hill
[39:36] it's a place that's inhabited it's a
[39:39] place that has light within it if I can
[39:42] say like this
[39:42] it's a metropolis that is feel
[39:45] old with light if there's no question
[39:48] about it when you look at this city is
[39:50] it a city that is inhabited because if
[39:53] it's not inhabited there won't be any
[39:55] lights there and you know sometimes you
[39:57] think about places where it used to be
[39:59] places that was inhabited no longer
[40:02] everything has grown up they don't still
[40:04] have lights on in those areas but it
[40:06] shows that light itself has to come in
[40:09] to that life and it's lit that life and
[40:12] there's a positioning in there now look
[40:15] at that you know many times when I I
[40:17] look at it and I think about even when I
[40:19] I look at how that you know it's placed
[40:22] where when we look at the the the part
[40:25] of I think of the Underground Railroad
[40:26] you know and I like to I like doing I've
[40:28] done a lot of reading on that over the
[40:30] years and in just spare time and I look
[40:33] at how that there was there's many
[40:34] places all along this area here with in
[40:36] Ohio places Sandusky Oberlin and all the
[40:39] way through and one of the ways there
[40:41] was not only points that would be within
[40:43] the wilderness and that they would find
[40:45] on trees but it was they would know that
[40:48] a house was a safe house because there
[40:51] would be a light source in the window
[40:54] and that light source they would know
[40:56] there would be messages that was given
[40:59] by lightning we even see that even how
[41:01] God would it would it would have it laid
[41:03] out there an example there is a message
[41:06] of life that is to shine forth through
[41:08] our life that there is a true Liberty
[41:11] now I want to just kind of take this
[41:13] direction here tonight when we're
[41:15] looking at our our lives being being lit
[41:17] up that it points to a place of of true
[41:20] Liberty believe I'm said I like this he
[41:22] says what we need is candles lit
[41:25] what we need is lives lit a flame with
[41:28] the power and the resurrection of Christ
[41:31] shining forth the same kind of a light
[41:34] that he gave you believe that he said
[41:38] well you can say I'm crazy if you want
[41:40] to you can say I'm out of the will of
[41:42] the Lord if you want to but just one
[41:45] thing where I once was a sinner I've
[41:48] been saved where I was once gloomy and
[41:52] glum I'm happy in the Lord Jesus I know
[41:56] there's something half
[41:58] to me you think about that that that
[42:01] young man remember that here he was he
[42:04] was born blind and the disciples were
[42:07] asking about him and the Lord Jesus let
[42:09] it be known the condition that he was in
[42:12] was that the very glory of God might be
[42:16] made known and remember after the Lord
[42:18] Jesus had and moved and brought healing
[42:21] to his eyes remember his parents would
[42:23] not even stand there but his parents
[42:25] said he is of age ask him you see he
[42:30] they couldn't testify of what happened
[42:32] to him but only he could testify of what
[42:36] happened to him you see he was the one
[42:39] that had happened to and because there
[42:42] was something that happened to him where
[42:44] at one time he was blind he didn't
[42:46] matter he was standing in front of all
[42:48] the Pharisees in that day these were
[42:51] people who could quote go through
[42:53] scriptures and everything else he was
[42:55] standing right there in front of him but
[42:57] they could not figure out what is going
[42:59] on but he let him know he said this is
[43:02] strange you don't know where this man
[43:04] came from but I'm gonna tell you I once
[43:07] was blind but I now can see it was a
[43:10] witness and a testament tell you
[43:13] something friends the world is not
[43:14] longing for doctrine the world is
[43:17] longing for reality amen we're not we're
[43:21] not sit and called by God the Bible
[43:24] didn't say let your word so be
[43:27] authenticated it said let your light so
[43:30] shine it's a discipline it's a life that
[43:35] it's live for others to behold because
[43:37] once the life is lived then they can
[43:40] begin to ask questions it's like as we
[43:44] looked at it last week on a billboard
[43:46] don't ever try to put up a paragraph on
[43:48] the billboard who's going to read it I
[43:52] mean unless the guys that end up in a
[43:54] ditch but the only thing they do on a
[43:57] billboard is display a sign and they'll
[44:01] put up exit 140 to be that's it if
[44:05] you're hungry and that sign is something
[44:08] that's appealing to you has something on
[44:10] it you know
[44:11] interests in a lot of words the picture
[44:13] says it all and that's the same way with
[44:17] the display of the light of God when
[44:19] that light is displayed through our
[44:21] lives it says it all
[44:23] we don't have to try to talk to somebody
[44:26] to try to prove to them anything its
[44:29] Christ himself proving it through our
[44:32] lives I believe that with all my heart
[44:35] notice this it's a it's a time brother
[44:38] Babbitt said it like this he goes on in
[44:39] this quote he says it's like a colored
[44:42] sister said one time in a meeting she
[44:44] said I want you all to know one thing
[44:46] she said I'm not what I want to be and
[44:49] I'm not what I ought to be but there's
[44:51] one thing sure I'm not what I used to be
[44:55] hallelujah I tell you that's a good
[44:59] thing you know when you've passed from
[45:01] death unto life when God takes a hold of
[45:04] you and shakes you till your life
[45:07] changes and changes everything there is
[45:10] in you and makes you a new creature
[45:12] that's what we need some lighted candles
[45:16] bill them goes on to say it over here
[45:19] again he says tell them how the candle
[45:22] got lit that's all they have to know
[45:26] tell them what lit the candle tell them
[45:30] what is burning in there just tell them
[45:33] how it got lit let them get lit that'll
[45:36] take care of the rest of it look how he
[45:38] says you don't have to tell go through
[45:40] all kinds of great words that you know
[45:43] not to begin with and they don't mean
[45:45] nothing after you know it just tell them
[45:47] glory to God the Holy Spirit struck me
[45:51] and I'm a different man
[45:52] tell them how the candle got licked all
[45:58] the doctrine he'll take care of it once
[46:00] the candle gets lit we're not winning
[46:03] people by doctrine but let them know how
[46:06] the candle got live yeah
[46:08] you understand friends there's been a
[46:09] lot of things that's been a lot of the
[46:11] problem people have come to know
[46:13] doctrine but they've never met Jesus
[46:17] Christ
[46:18] and that's why when things come up and
[46:21] what they are looking at discrepancies
[46:23] and misses said here and this is said
[46:25] here what it is they're looking at
[46:27] things and they're looking at it because
[46:29] just to know the doctrines is to knowing
[46:31] in the flesh you know exactly what I'm
[46:34] talking about is to know him in the
[46:36] flesh brother mom said a good Baptists
[46:38] can take this Bible and tie your hands
[46:40] he said because he has note him in the
[46:43] flesh but it's not you're not saved to
[46:46] know him in the flesh it's to know him
[46:48] in the power of his resurrection I mean
[46:53] people can see look all around your jobs
[46:55] and everywhere you go you can see people
[46:57] when they're on the up-and-up
[46:58] let him get a pay raise I mean then the
[47:03] boss that they've been running down is
[47:05] the best guy in the world
[47:07] the world sees all of this the world
[47:10] sees all of the the Sunday School
[47:13] teachers I worked with them and you know
[47:14] they would want when they had a special
[47:16] need they would want to comment and they
[47:18] would you know at times want to ask
[47:19] questions and talk about things and yet
[47:22] it was known that they were sunday
[47:23] school teachers but yet they were the
[47:25] ones that would get on the PA system and
[47:28] announced happy hour starts at four
[47:31] o'clock you don't want to miss it huh I
[47:33] remember you know a sweet little old
[47:35] lady came by the one time and she came
[47:37] by my room and she said Sam why aren't
[47:39] you gonna go I said no I don't go then
[47:42] places Betty Christians don't go there
[47:44] she said well I'm a Christian I said
[47:46] well Betty there must be something
[47:48] different between me and you I said
[47:49] because the Lord Jesus completely
[47:51] changed my life I have no desire to even
[47:54] go to them places I didn't try one
[47:57] putting her down I just let her know
[47:58] what happened to me
[48:00] changed me it's not that I could go
[48:02] there and drink a coke I don't want to
[48:04] even go to them kind of places I believe
[48:09] that with all my heart you know there's
[48:11] a lot of things that when we look at it
[48:13] and I think brother brand will continue
[48:14] to move through this whole fault line
[48:17] and he he'll remind us of a man by the
[48:19] name of Hudson Taylor you know who was
[48:22] who was that who was a a man of God and
[48:25] brother Graham will remind us of this
[48:26] and and brother brand will talk about it
[48:28] of how that there were people who would
[48:30] ask this
[48:31] and you know I've been feeling what the
[48:34] holy ghost should I go ahead and go to
[48:35] to seminary and brother Brown would
[48:38] always refer this phrase even when he
[48:40] wasn't directly calling out Hudson
[48:43] Taylor's name but he would refer to it
[48:45] and say why do would you wait to your
[48:48] candles halfway burnt down go and it's
[48:51] just been lit and I believe that's what
[48:53] God desires in our heart it isn't that
[48:55] we need to set and but we've got to have
[48:58] everything put together you don't need
[49:00] to have everything put together go out
[49:02] there and tell them how we got lit and
[49:05] let me tell you something even when God
[49:07] divinely places things in our lives we
[49:10] realize friends that it is God who did
[49:13] that but many people still need to know
[49:15] how the candle got lit and that's what
[49:18] they need this world is craving for
[49:21] reality it'll need no more knowledge the
[49:24] Bible said knowledge increases and you
[49:27] risk me you don't need any more
[49:29] knowledge I agree that when we look at
[49:31] the doctrine of the word remember it was
[49:33] not intended just to be head knowledge
[49:36] but it was intended that it would bring
[49:39] forth and be divine revelation working
[49:41] in our life but let us make sure that we
[49:44] don't put the feast of unleavened bread
[49:46] out of order you with me let's make sure
[49:50] we keep all those things in the right
[49:53] order they meet the lamb they've had
[49:54] their pinnacles let's make sure of those
[49:56] things so when you look at this of how
[49:59] that the candle it got lit look at this
[50:02] example here in the scripture here's a
[50:04] man that we know by the name of Legion I
[50:07] don't know what his name is but we know
[50:10] him and the Legion wasn't even his name
[50:14] that was just amount of devils that was
[50:18] in him that's all it was we don't know
[50:21] his name but this is what I want you to
[50:23] look at that after the Lord Jesus had
[50:27] visited this area there was a need
[50:30] within his life back drew the Lord Jesus
[50:32] there you believe that Jesus wasn't just
[50:35] happenstance going around to different
[50:36] places but he realized that these
[50:39] appointments were he would even say I
[50:41] must need Joe by Samaria he was being
[50:44] directed and led by the Holy Ghost I
[50:47] believe that not only as the groom has
[50:49] led that way but I believe that's his
[50:51] bride that we are led the same way if
[50:53] he's a serpent bruzer were ordained to
[50:56] be serpent bruisers as well if he was
[50:58] led as the groom that same Holy Ghost is
[51:01] in right form and it's to lead us I
[51:04] believe that don't you
[51:05] now notice this this man the Bible this
[51:09] is one of the accounts here it was after
[51:11] he himself has been set free remember
[51:14] even many of the people came out of the
[51:15] city to see it there they came out the
[51:18] witness this man man he's been set free
[51:21] they heard telling the tales but I often
[51:22] wonder is it that they came to see him
[51:25] or they come to count how many hogs I
[51:28] don't know because after a while
[51:31] remember they prayed the Lord Jesus
[51:32] please get out of here you with me they
[51:36] came to see him and they came to see
[51:38] about the Hogs
[51:38] the swine but you see after everything
[51:42] had taken place then here the man the
[51:46] Bible says when he was coming to the
[51:47] ship he that had been possessed with the
[51:50] devil
[51:50] prayed him that he might be with him
[51:53] howbeit Jesus suffered him not but said
[51:56] unto him go home to thy friends and tell
[52:03] them how great things the Lord hath done
[52:05] for thee and have had compassion on thee
[52:09] and he departed and began to publish in
[52:14] Decapolis how great things Jesus had
[52:16] done for him and all the men did marvel
[52:19] how would you think of this wouldn't it
[52:20] have been a wonderful thing for him to
[52:22] be able to get in the ship with the Lord
[52:23] Jesus wouldn't it have been a wonderful
[52:25] thing for here in the midst of a
[52:27] campaign the Lord Jesus could call and
[52:29] say I'd like to ask brother I don't know
[52:31] what his name is but I'd like to ask him
[52:33] who was once an only jet I'd like him to
[52:35] stand up here tonight and give a
[52:37] testimony there is no doubt about it his
[52:39] testimony would have a resounding effect
[52:41] but his testimony would not have the
[52:44] same magnitude and impact as it would
[52:48] when he went back to those who knew him
[52:51] they knew how this guy was they knew the
[52:54] situation about his life in the Lord
[52:57] Jesus here he is this candle has been
[52:59] lit what's happened he's placed on a
[53:01] candlestick and he's sent right back in
[53:04] did the capitalist this is a a city or
[53:07] what is known as ten cities and this man
[53:10] goes in there and begins to publish
[53:11] which begins to preach he begins to
[53:14] Herald
[53:14] it begins to tell and you look at it in
[53:16] our lives you might not be a preacher
[53:18] but your life is a preacher it meant
[53:22] sometimes you use words other times you
[53:24] don't use words there's times you want
[53:26] our life itself it's the life that's
[53:29] preaching it's the life that's telling
[53:31] forth it's the life and here this man is
[53:33] declaring the compassion of God he's
[53:36] telling how his candle got lit how great
[53:40] things the Lord had done for thee you
[53:43] almost wonder when he came into the
[53:45] place you wonder people didn't say hey
[53:46] hey hey hey where's the kids at get him
[53:49] get him no doubt he probably went to his
[53:54] home first you with me it probably went
[53:58] back to his home first and when he got
[54:01] back to his home first
[54:03] maybe his his wife his children or
[54:05] whatever more maybe you know they had
[54:08] been witnesses of these things but now
[54:10] they're witnessing of a life and I
[54:12] wonder what he said to him but he no
[54:13] doubt he said I met Jesus let me tell
[54:17] you something he didn't have to hold
[54:19] seminars to prove to him he met Jesus
[54:22] there was a personal presence of the
[54:25] Living God that vindicated the words in
[54:28] his life
[54:29] there was a light that was shining there
[54:31] his life was a city that was set on a
[54:34] hill it was a candle that had been lit
[54:36] and placed on a candlestick no doubt
[54:40] about it when it came among his friends
[54:41] people he's annoying but here this life
[54:44] is showing now and they're able to say
[54:47] what happened to him
[54:48] he said all God had compassion on me you
[54:51] see what real godly compassion how
[54:53] opposite it is from the way that
[54:55] compassion many times is taught we
[54:58] understand if it was not for the
[54:59] compassion of God you and I would be
[55:02] soon but remember God's compassion does
[55:05] not just cover his eyes and pretend like
[55:07] nothing's wrong but his compassion
[55:09] brought him down to become one of us and
[55:13] do something about the problem and the
[55:16] issues of our life this man was a trophy
[55:19] of God's grace he was a trophy of the
[55:22] mercy of Almighty God if it had not been
[55:25] for the mercy of God where would his
[55:27] life have been he's telling how his
[55:30] candle got lit is why brother Ram will
[55:34] say and I read this to you last week as
[55:36] soon as God lights the candle take off
[55:39] if you don't know no more just tell them
[55:41] how they got lit let them get lit and
[55:44] they'll tell somebody else and we'll
[55:46] have a candle lighting time that's what
[55:48] we need
[55:49] anyhow instead of so much theology
[55:51] candle lighting that's all you have to
[55:54] don't try to preach just say how you got
[55:56] lit I got filled with something that's
[55:58] burning me up and that's all just tell
[56:01] them about the lighting time how it got
[56:05] lit and it'll give the light as it burns
[56:07] down and let that one light lights
[56:10] another one remember how they relate to
[56:13] lit the candle sticks as we've been
[56:15] talking about they did not they lit that
[56:18] from the fire that came out from before
[56:20] the presence of God and it lit that
[56:23] altar and consumed the sacrifice and
[56:25] then they took that fire and they lit
[56:28] that candlestick and then from that
[56:30] candlestick they lit from that flame lit
[56:32] the next lamp and from that lamp lit the
[56:35] next land it's the same original
[56:38] outpouring of the Holy Ghost it's the
[56:42] same original one it'll produce the same
[56:44] results glory to God hallelujah and that
[56:49] wonderful they men are your witness
[56:52] tonight that it produces the same
[56:54] results hey man it does the same thing
[56:57] it ain't got weaker it ain't got weaker
[57:00] as a matter of fact it's in such a
[57:01] strength and such a power
[57:03] it's got stronger in this hour hey God
[57:06] has raised up a standard
[57:08] where the enemy wanted to tear it down
[57:10] and and substitute it but God has raised
[57:13] the standard and he's made it real so
[57:16] that you and I can walk and have that
[57:18] same experience that they had that way
[57:21] you don't understand what that does that
[57:23] makes the Bible alive to you and I the
[57:26] Bible is no longer a book of stories
[57:28] this Bible then becomes prophecy for my
[57:31] life if there's something that's missing
[57:34] in my life like that hammer where they
[57:36] sought out Elijah and we can have faith
[57:39] to know that God is the same God that
[57:41] that same God that brought up that axe
[57:44] head is the same God that can bring it
[57:46] up in my life it puts us into contact
[57:50] with the Living God who expressed
[57:54] himself in a living supernatural way
[57:57] glory beaut of God if from one light to
[58:01] another light through her to be to God
[58:04] you love him look at this testimony of
[58:07] life it's a woman in an amazing there's
[58:16] many of these people right here that the
[58:18] Lord Jesus dealt was their life you
[58:20] don't know their names tell me what
[58:25] their name was that that really ain't
[58:27] important what's important is is that
[58:29] their life was changed that's what means
[58:32] more than anything not who they were
[58:34] if their life was changed now here
[58:38] here's the Lord Jesus he's speaking to
[58:40] this little woman and after he spoke to
[58:44] her here his disciples come in verse 20
[58:47] and upon this they come became his
[58:50] disciples and marveled that he talked
[58:53] with the woman yet no man said what see
[58:55] cast out or why talkest thou with her
[58:58] the woman then left her waterpot and
[59:02] went her way into the city and said to
[59:05] the men come see a man which told me all
[59:08] things that ever I did is not this the
[59:12] Christ then they went out of the city
[59:15] and came unto Him I want you to watch
[59:19] this
[59:20] who it is and what he did became the
[59:23] center and focus of her life who he is
[59:28] and what he did became the focus of her
[59:31] life I guarantee when we stand there on
[59:35] that day and we event eventually if
[59:37] there's a name that's put with this and
[59:39] we meet her her focus is going to be the
[59:42] same if you would have met this woman
[59:44] ten years later fifty years later her
[59:47] focus would still be the same because
[59:51] she has been lit hallelujah think of
[59:57] this mouth there had to be in her life I
[1:00:00] look at this because of the circumstance
[1:00:03] that surrounded there had to be such an
[1:00:06] accompaniment of the presence of God
[1:00:09] around her life and with her words for
[1:00:13] even people to actually give what she
[1:00:15] was saying the time of day you with me
[1:00:19] you know I know you said well bless I'm
[1:00:21] you yeah but do you realize friends that
[1:00:23] that's exactly what it must be even when
[1:00:26] Paul talked on the preaching of the word
[1:00:27] he said it must come with power and
[1:00:30] demonstration not with enticing words of
[1:00:32] man's wisdom if it ain't to come with
[1:00:34] enticing words of man's wisdom when
[1:00:36] standing and ministering the word it
[1:00:38] ought to be by the usher by the issuance
[1:00:41] of the Holy Ghost I believe it's the
[1:00:43] same way that within our lives that when
[1:00:45] we would talk to someone we better make
[1:00:48] sure that we're being led and we're not
[1:00:53] trying to prove somebody wrong
[1:00:55] that's not your God ain't send his word
[1:00:58] for that he sent his word that that word
[1:01:01] might be expressed it might even be
[1:01:03] somebody that even that you know may be
[1:01:05] sitting right around you but God has not
[1:01:07] sent his word for us to try to prove one
[1:01:09] another wrong there might be things that
[1:01:11] you don't see you don't see I like eye
[1:01:13] to eye but within the midst of it let's
[1:01:15] walk on with the Lord don't occupy
[1:01:18] ourselves with things like that notice
[1:01:21] this this woman brother Bevin said like
[1:01:23] this
[1:01:23] he said she could not hold her peace she
[1:01:26] ran into the city and her testimony was
[1:01:30] so stirring
[1:01:32] until they could not ignore her so they
[1:01:35] went out look at that mercy
[1:01:38] they couldn't ignore her I don't believe
[1:01:42] she was a pest but I believe there was a
[1:01:45] presence they could not ignore OMA and
[1:01:51] the Bible said that the people of sakaar
[1:01:53] believed Jesus he never did that again
[1:01:56] to them because of the woman's testimony
[1:01:59] that told her what she had done
[1:02:05] well Ram said it like this in one place
[1:02:08] he said this little lady he said in her
[1:02:11] house a prostitution
[1:02:13] she had Scrolls that she had kept and
[1:02:16] she had been reading these Scrolls she
[1:02:20] had been reading the words of the
[1:02:24] prophets and she was looking and
[1:02:27] remember which she came to the Lord
[1:02:28] Jesus
[1:02:29] she wanted a blank slate you understand
[1:02:32] what I mean you know you and I both have
[1:02:34] met people that they may have had a
[1:02:36] little bit of church background but you
[1:02:38] know when you come to them they have
[1:02:40] nothing of the Bible but yet within it
[1:02:42] in our time in our day days I'll tell
[1:02:44] you in many cases that's a good thing
[1:02:46] that's her that's a real good thing
[1:02:48] because many times it's so entrenched
[1:02:51] within the traditions and the thinking
[1:02:53] and you know we could go on and on on
[1:02:55] that one bring it on down home but when
[1:02:57] we look at it here her testimony was so
[1:03:00] stirring but to think of how that she in
[1:03:03] her life of where she was that that God
[1:03:06] came by and so illuminated her heart
[1:03:09] that she went back into the city you
[1:03:11] know there's no way they would have gave
[1:03:13] her the time of day think about this
[1:03:15] think about it there were men that
[1:03:17] within it she wasn't allowed to go to
[1:03:20] the well even at any other time the rest
[1:03:22] of the women went there was a difference
[1:03:25] she went there at a time when she was
[1:03:28] allowed but to think of it for her to
[1:03:30] even begin to even project some sort of
[1:03:33] a religious idea that is not legal
[1:03:40] boy there's got to be an authority
[1:03:42] burning greater in her by what authority
[1:03:46] are you bringing this message by the
[1:03:48] authority of the Living God amen you
[1:03:52] said she was a living witness of the
[1:03:55] message she herself was a reflection of
[1:03:58] the message has come
[1:03:59] oh my notice this the testimony of life
[1:04:04] look at this here many of the Samaritans
[1:04:07] of that city believed on him for the
[1:04:11] saying of the woman which testified he
[1:04:15] told me all that ever I did they
[1:04:19] believed on him because of her testimony
[1:04:22] so her testimony was not about her her
[1:04:26] testimony was about what he did for her
[1:04:30] sir testimony was about him you see she
[1:04:34] was a lamp that had been lit and
[1:04:37] remember the Lance must give light over
[1:04:40] against the candlestick it must
[1:04:43] illuminate and highlight the Lord Jesus
[1:04:46] Christ
[1:04:46] no girl would be to God so when the
[1:04:50] Samaritans were come unto Him they
[1:04:53] besought him that he would tarry with
[1:04:55] them and he abode there two days and
[1:04:58] many more believed because of his own
[1:05:01] word and said unto the woman now we
[1:05:05] believe not because of thy saying for we
[1:05:08] have heard him ourselves and know that
[1:05:11] this is indeed the Christ the Saviour of
[1:05:14] the world and once you think about this
[1:05:16] he did not reproduce that sign again
[1:05:19] with them of sakaar are you with me he
[1:05:23] only did at one time but what he did
[1:05:26] that sign is that sign coming forth and
[1:05:29] here she herself is a witness a living
[1:05:32] witness that my life everything all my
[1:05:36] troubles everything has been uncovered
[1:05:38] and I have finally brother brems said
[1:05:40] she finally felt found the man that she
[1:05:43] had been waiting on since she was a
[1:05:45] child
[1:05:47] she found the man she had been waiting
[1:05:50] home since she was a child I'm telling
[1:05:52] you there was a reality that was so
[1:05:54] burning in her heart that when they got
[1:05:57] there it that illumination it drew them
[1:06:00] to a place to where they came out of the
[1:06:02] city to hear him and the Bible said as
[1:06:04] we read more believed and is more
[1:06:07] believed on his work here is the work
[1:06:09] going forth he didn't have to reproduce
[1:06:11] the sign again her life in her testimony
[1:06:15] you say how could that be because there
[1:06:18] was an accompaniment of the positive
[1:06:21] presence of the Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:06:24] gave witness beyond even the words oh
[1:06:27] she said come see a man that's all she
[1:06:32] said come see a man she has a lot she's
[1:06:35] she's pointing to him she's showing them
[1:06:38] come see the Messiah come see this
[1:06:42] oh my milligram says she was full of
[1:06:44] eternal life they had to listen to her
[1:06:47] like a house on fire on a dry windy day
[1:06:50] you couldn't stop it away she went and
[1:06:53] not only that if she had not been filled
[1:06:55] up the men would have wouldn't have
[1:06:57] listened to her but she had something
[1:06:59] positive that she knew about it will see
[1:07:04] it that's why it was something different
[1:07:06] about her words it wasn't that a her
[1:07:09] voice had changed his something was
[1:07:11] different there was a light there was a
[1:07:13] life that was behind it I want you think
[1:07:15] of this she wasn't there for days or
[1:07:18] months at that well she got lit and as
[1:07:21] soon as she got lit she had found the
[1:07:23] love of her life she left her waterpot
[1:07:26] there
[1:07:27] she showed everything else became
[1:07:29] secondarily what was beating in her
[1:07:31] heart what she was longing for had
[1:07:34] become a reality everything else took a
[1:07:36] backseat right then it didn't matter if
[1:07:39] it was priority to get water that was
[1:07:41] second now Hill Christ was first he had
[1:07:44] stepped to the forefront of her life and
[1:07:46] here she went away and come see a man a
[1:07:49] testimony a life that had been lit by
[1:07:53] the power of Almighty God
[1:07:55] what's she drawn into to the Messiah
[1:07:58] you see this is where our lives our
[1:08:01] lives are not drawn people to the
[1:08:02] messenger
[1:08:03] our lives are drawn people to Jesus
[1:08:05] Christ if we truly are receiving what
[1:08:09] God has said sad and sin in this hour
[1:08:11] you see that's why I stand in contrary
[1:08:13] and in contrast when a person would say
[1:08:16] that the true ministry wants people to
[1:08:18] brother Adam that's a lie that's an
[1:08:20] error that is not the truth they point
[1:08:22] them to Jesus Christ
[1:08:23] even the Prophet said it over and over
[1:08:25] the Prophet never echoed those words but
[1:08:28] men have echoes those words without a
[1:08:30] revelation you understand little by
[1:08:34] little by little things can so easily be
[1:08:38] eroded away we plunked the people where
[1:08:40] the Prophet could say over and over
[1:08:42] again and it's the truth what he could
[1:08:44] see in that day he said we're not
[1:08:46] getting people to Christ I don't think
[1:08:50] there's any I don't think there's any of
[1:08:51] us that could argue against within those
[1:08:53] things that friends the reality is is
[1:08:55] that getting people to Christ that's the
[1:08:57] reality it's alive that's to be lived
[1:09:00] I'll tell you the I'll I'll be honest
[1:09:02] with you I don't care how deep you can
[1:09:03] talk I don't care if you and I can carry
[1:09:06] on the conversation and I can finish
[1:09:08] this quote and I can finish a lot of
[1:09:10] those and that that's not what it's
[1:09:11] about it's a life that's lived you don't
[1:09:15] matter how much it's where can your life
[1:09:17] be live well I love the message but I'm
[1:09:19] a question is do you love the Lord Jesus
[1:09:21] Christ if you love the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:24] then you love the message in the right
[1:09:26] way by being example of it not just
[1:09:29] going along with it because well I think
[1:09:31] everything that sounds real good no it's
[1:09:33] a life that's to be on display the
[1:09:35] commandment has come arise shine the
[1:09:38] light has come Lord would be the god
[1:09:44] think about this let me just kind of
[1:09:47] move here just a just a little bit here
[1:09:49] when we look at here here brother Graham
[1:09:53] said it like this in the message he says
[1:09:55] the only way we see Christ is when he
[1:09:59] reflects in each other
[1:10:03] I see Christ in you you see him and me
[1:10:06] and that's how we watch Christ the
[1:10:12] brother Brahma he goes on now you know
[1:10:13] with a billboard and a life it's got to
[1:10:17] create a hunger but yeah there has to be
[1:10:20] a hunger there something that can be I
[1:10:22] mean you could talk to somebody whatever
[1:10:24] as we kind of mentioned that last week
[1:10:26] about eating if friends money's not
[1:10:27] hungry don't try to force it on I mean
[1:10:31] it's like trying to tell somebody who's
[1:10:33] full hey come on man you you need a
[1:10:34] hamburger I'm full I don't want a
[1:10:36] hamburger for I'm full you see they can
[1:10:39] only be hungry but you see if they're
[1:10:42] hungry listen to me now if they're
[1:10:44] hungry as we said it last week nobody's
[1:10:46] going to probably go to McDonald's if
[1:10:48] what they displayed on the Billboard was
[1:10:50] the Big Mac that looked like an elephant
[1:10:52] stomped on it and where the patties are
[1:10:55] all off you know and really got the
[1:10:57] sauce that don't look like the orange
[1:10:58] sauce anymore and where the lettuce is
[1:11:00] all scraggly and nobody's gonna go for
[1:11:02] that say look that looks awful good
[1:11:04] they're hungry are you with me now
[1:11:07] they're hungry but that what's on the
[1:11:10] sign is not attracting them so there's
[1:11:13] got to be a hunger and there's got to be
[1:11:15] a right display that's why the world
[1:11:18] itself even the Prophet when he was
[1:11:20] hearing this time in the Spirit of the
[1:11:22] Lord was picking that up if people were
[1:11:25] not in a place they did not want social
[1:11:27] gospel there is a reality that there was
[1:11:30] a people that was longing for reality
[1:11:34] now think of it the Prophet addressing
[1:11:36] these things and many of you know what
[1:11:38] I'm talking about when you look back you
[1:11:39] look back at things that brother BAM
[1:11:41] says on tape and think about how that
[1:11:43] people look during that time they
[1:11:45] probably looked at him and saying what
[1:11:46] in the world are you talking about what
[1:11:49] are you talking about he's pointing out
[1:11:52] certain things look brother BAM is
[1:11:53] pointing out things about rock and
[1:11:55] roll's in alright but think about it
[1:11:59] what about now within these times that
[1:12:01] you know you can just look at certain
[1:12:03] things and you know it's just like how
[1:12:04] its advertised sometimes or how things
[1:12:06] will be put forth or you can see it on a
[1:12:08] video or one or more it looks like a
[1:12:10] club you with me it looks like a club
[1:12:14] they've got their lights in their discos
[1:12:16] and their
[1:12:17] everything else come on somebody
[1:12:20] it turned they turn to churches into
[1:12:22] theatres it turned it into shelves come
[1:12:27] on somebody kill the lights out here
[1:12:29] let's put all the lights on the state
[1:12:31] we're not here for a show we're here for
[1:12:34] the Mady gob to come down and move among
[1:12:37] us and save lives and change lives and
[1:12:40] heal the sick and bring deliverance
[1:12:42] we're not here for show we're here that
[1:12:45] God might move what a sad look these
[1:12:49] what we see now are not seeds this is a
[1:12:53] crop it's a crop so the in order for a
[1:13:00] billboard there's got to be it she calls
[1:13:03] a thirst to her eyes brother bream says
[1:13:05] it like this he says I can come to a
[1:13:07] meeting and I start preaching and I
[1:13:10] watch the people you can see whether
[1:13:13] they're interested or not in just a few
[1:13:15] minutes you look over your audience you
[1:13:18] can tell whether you're boring them or
[1:13:21] whether you're not that's the truth you
[1:13:24] can see it but what you look for is to
[1:13:28] see has the problem to go on tear is to
[1:13:31] see that Christ inside of you feeding on
[1:13:35] that word and he says I begin to see he
[1:13:37] said and that comes back to me and I'm
[1:13:39] being fed then it's reciprocating amen
[1:13:45] so now look at this here in this fault
[1:13:48] line we are not salesmen another ask him
[1:13:54] how to raise their hands if I say to him
[1:13:58] who likes salesmen I'm not gonna ask you
[1:14:00] raise your hands I like I like salesmen
[1:14:03] when I need to know certain things about
[1:14:07] something such as is this on sale no was
[1:14:11] the last time it was on sale all right
[1:14:13] when you think it's gonna be on sale
[1:14:15] because most the time on things now I
[1:14:17] know not everybody's like me in and
[1:14:19] thank God you know you're not and I
[1:14:20] understand that I it's because they can
[1:14:23] go in a real and we're going a real bad
[1:14:24] way but you know when you go into things
[1:14:26] I like I don't want them
[1:14:27] telling me everything I want to know so
[1:14:31] when I go I want to have my comparisons
[1:14:33] already I want to be able to ask them
[1:14:35] certain questions but you know sometimes
[1:14:37] the salesmen those you'll say I wanna
[1:14:38] buy this car right now
[1:14:39] I know I really don't need a car oh come
[1:14:41] on just take it for a test drive hell
[1:14:42] I'll be back in here I have some popcorn
[1:14:44] ready for you I'll have everything ready
[1:14:45] for it I'll take it for a test drive
[1:14:47] you know how they want to get you in
[1:14:48] that car because once they get you in
[1:14:50] your car and you start seeing yourself
[1:14:51] in that car they feel like they've got
[1:14:57] you well my point is that's a Salesman a
[1:15:02] Salesman tries to sell things whether
[1:15:06] they themselves even believe in it or
[1:15:08] know about it this is why we are not
[1:15:14] salesmen we're not trying to sell the
[1:15:19] gospel that's why I made the statement
[1:15:22] last week I'm not interested in trying
[1:15:25] to get everybody but I'm trying to get
[1:15:27] everybody but God desires to have
[1:15:31] because if you're trying to get
[1:15:33] everybody then there's all kinds of
[1:15:34] compromises that's me I look at it right
[1:15:39] now you know many of you have already
[1:15:41] received it you know you receive things
[1:15:43] in your and your mailbox sometimes
[1:15:46] postcards I'm gonna receive the postcard
[1:15:48] sometime I'm gonna tell me what a
[1:15:50] postcard from I were down in Florida I'm
[1:15:52] not talking about that I'm talking about
[1:15:53] a postcard and they'll be usually a
[1:15:55] pretty good-sized one come to such and
[1:15:57] such a worship here we have these in
[1:16:00] these activities and we do this for the
[1:16:02] youth and every Sunday we have a special
[1:16:05] Browns rally you know there's there's
[1:16:08] things that they put on there when look
[1:16:10] at look at the sad part of it sending it
[1:16:12] out in that manner in that way what are
[1:16:15] they trying to do draw upon people but
[1:16:18] it's not bringing people to the reality
[1:16:21] they're trying to sell them trying to
[1:16:26] sell them certain things we are not
[1:16:28] salesmen
[1:16:31] billboards if you're ever driving down
[1:16:34] the road and a billboard starts talking
[1:16:35] to you you need to get checked
[1:16:38] billboards don't talk
[1:16:41] billboards just display right Peter said
[1:16:45] to show forth his praises of him that
[1:16:49] called you out of darkness into this
[1:16:51] marvelous light notice brother BAM said
[1:16:53] we're not his salesmen we are his
[1:16:56] billboards don't think we're his
[1:16:59] salesmen he don't need any salesmanship
[1:17:02] just billboards salesmen try to persuade
[1:17:08] you right oh you need this sir you need
[1:17:14] that hey hey just you know just for a
[1:17:16] hundred more dollars you can hey that
[1:17:20] all adds up you know that a Salesman is
[1:17:24] they're just trying to sell and brother
[1:17:26] branham you know he keeps alluding to
[1:17:28] something when he's ministering and that
[1:17:30] message let your light so shine among
[1:17:32] men and and he says we're not ty said we
[1:17:34] don't want quick sales
[1:17:35] he said well you have people that say
[1:17:37] haha I'll tell you what for two weeks
[1:17:39] man I lasted real good for two weeks man
[1:17:41] I I'll tell you what I had Victor for
[1:17:43] two weeks but after two weeks brother
[1:17:44] Graham said that's a quick sale we don't
[1:17:46] want quick sales and any refers to
[1:17:48] something some of you I looked it up and
[1:17:50] I couldn't even understand what brother
[1:17:51] hand was saying so I had to pull it up
[1:17:53] on the screen I said what's he saying
[1:17:55] here brother brand was somebody said you
[1:17:56] know that had a call advertisement had a
[1:17:58] call H ad a CE o L so I looked it up and
[1:18:01] brother brands referring to that at that
[1:18:03] time he said you know that had a call
[1:18:05] thing that was going on what it was it
[1:18:07] was a little lik sir
[1:18:09] where a man himself had went into a
[1:18:11] doctor's office he had pain in his foot
[1:18:13] and he himself wanted to have you know
[1:18:16] be pain free so the doctor gave him this
[1:18:18] B vitamin lick sir so this guy I just
[1:18:21] took the formula changed it a little bit
[1:18:23] but this lick sir was a very powerful
[1:18:25] and and in very very something that was
[1:18:29] sought after because it had like 20%
[1:18:31] alcohol in it so even the dry counties
[1:18:35] it said pharmacies were serving it in
[1:18:37] shot glasses
[1:18:38] I'd say people felt good take it four
[1:18:41] times a day I'd say they felt really
[1:18:43] good
[1:18:44] but notice only was that's all he was it
[1:18:49] was a salesmanship it was that which was
[1:18:51] invented by senator and here he was
[1:18:53] selling this how this will help you this
[1:18:56] will make you feel better and we notice
[1:18:58] we understand that about the gospel
[1:19:00] we're not trying listen to me we're not
[1:19:03] trying to get people into the church we
[1:19:05] want to see people come into the Lord
[1:19:07] Jesus Christ if they come here they're
[1:19:09] go to brother Andy's there go to brother
[1:19:11] Paul's brother Jess I don't get we don't
[1:19:12] care where they go as long as you get in
[1:19:14] Christ and Christ once you get in Christ
[1:19:18] Christ will position you where you need
[1:19:20] to be are you with me that's the main
[1:19:24] thing is getting people to Christ we're
[1:19:26] not trying to get everyone hail I'll
[1:19:28] tell you what you are to come here and
[1:19:29] you ought to do this I'll tell you what
[1:19:31] man with this and we've got this and we
[1:19:33] got this program and we I think God we
[1:19:35] don't have none in program right I don't
[1:19:37] want stuff like that you know I might be
[1:19:38] simple I don't want more stuff to think
[1:19:41] about well the same you'll send out a
[1:19:44] newsletter about I don't want more stuff
[1:19:46] to think about
[1:19:49] you want a newsletter you might want to
[1:19:51] go somewhere where they do newsletters
[1:19:52] I'm not interested in all that other
[1:19:54] stuff I'm friends listen I don't say
[1:19:57] that there's things I understand it's
[1:19:59] important for us to know but sometimes
[1:20:01] it's things what are we really coming
[1:20:03] for are we coming for all these other
[1:20:05] things where people say well I really
[1:20:07] like the music it's gotta be deeper than
[1:20:09] that
[1:20:10] people say well I'll tell you what I
[1:20:12] really like to minister in the word it's
[1:20:14] gotta be deeper than that there's gotta
[1:20:17] be a rim there's got to be something
[1:20:19] that's real that you're hearing from the
[1:20:22] Lord Jesus Christ because everything
[1:20:24] else will get old
[1:20:25] it'll get old all this old convenor you
[1:20:30] with me things can become common but
[1:20:33] when it's something that's there you
[1:20:35] know your your ain't you're hearing from
[1:20:37] God it'll help you go beyond even in
[1:20:39] common times think of this brother BAM
[1:20:43] said it like this he said you may never
[1:20:45] see a vision you may never put your
[1:20:47] hands on a sick person and feel the
[1:20:49] charge of Almighty God make a skeleton
[1:20:52] of a of a man turned back to life again
[1:20:54] you may never see him standing yonder
[1:20:57] in three or four rainbows you may never
[1:20:59] see his image you may never hear his
[1:21:02] voice you may never he says within this
[1:21:05] oh boy
[1:21:22] here it is
[1:21:25] but you can still be a signboard that
[1:21:29] will reflect Jesus Christ look at this
[1:21:32] by a life that's been lived so pure and
[1:21:35] unadulterated from the world not
[1:21:39] cluttered up with dirty things around
[1:21:43] your life but a pure thing that will
[1:21:46] cause the hungry heart to hunger and
[1:21:49] thirst to be like you you may never do
[1:21:54] any of those things but what's important
[1:21:57] is is the life being reflected and the
[1:22:00] power and humility and purity keeping
[1:22:04] the life uncluttered keeping it
[1:22:08] uncluttered sometimes things can get
[1:22:09] mounted
[1:22:11] this can get coming in this can take it
[1:22:13] a little by little you talk to you talk
[1:22:16] to individuals I hope nobody here is a
[1:22:17] hoarder
[1:22:18] I don't want offend nobody's feelings
[1:22:19] but you take you people who are hoarders
[1:22:21] little by little ask them when you when
[1:22:24] you when you when you get a chance to
[1:22:26] talk with them the things that they'll
[1:22:27] say is I don't know how it got like this
[1:22:29] I don't have that like this I just
[1:22:32] started one garage sale and went to
[1:22:34] another garage sale and went through
[1:22:35] another grouts and it's truth friends
[1:22:37] they don't know how it happened and
[1:22:38] they've got a little path through the
[1:22:40] house and they don't know how it
[1:22:42] happened but see it started by little by
[1:22:45] little by little and things can clutter
[1:22:47] up quickly
[1:22:48] is that right many times the clutter
[1:22:51] clutter is not necessarily the things
[1:22:53] that you want out on display right
[1:22:56] clutter is things that you want move
[1:22:58] because you say maybe we don't need to
[1:22:59] have this out that we do this don't need
[1:23:02] to be here it's all clutter hey get a
[1:23:04] box and let's send it all out to
[1:23:07] Goodwill or Salvation Army let's get rid
[1:23:09] of the clutter around here and then
[1:23:12] we'll buy more stuff and
[1:23:21] I want to get to something here
[1:23:26] look at this part right here in axe I
[1:23:31] want you to watch watch this right here
[1:23:34] just my heart was just so pressed last
[1:23:37] week is after I was closing just to come
[1:23:40] in and look at this part here let me
[1:23:41] just try to wind this down here was a
[1:23:45] man by the name of Apollo the bible says
[1:23:47] born in alexandria an eloquent man and
[1:23:50] mighty in the scriptures and he came to
[1:23:52] Ephesus
[1:23:53] this man was instructed in the way of
[1:23:56] the Lord and being fervent in the spirit
[1:23:59] he spake and talked diligently the
[1:24:03] things of the Lord knowing only the
[1:24:05] baptism of John now watch this and he
[1:24:10] began to speak boldly in the synagogue
[1:24:13] whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard
[1:24:17] they took him in front of the Brethren
[1:24:21] they took him unto them and expounded
[1:24:25] unto Him the way of God more perfectly I
[1:24:28] want you to watch this they have
[1:24:31] understanding don't they but their
[1:24:33] understanding they brought him to the
[1:24:37] side they realized when he what he had
[1:24:40] spoken that he hasn't come all the way
[1:24:43] yet or seen everything he knew the way
[1:24:46] of the Lord but here's what they did
[1:24:48] they pulled him to the side and they
[1:24:52] talked to him privately you with me the
[1:24:57] Bible says whom when Aquila and
[1:24:59] Priscilla had heard they took him unto
[1:25:02] them and expounded unto Him the way of
[1:25:05] God more perfectly the point is I'm
[1:25:11] looking I was just drawn to this here
[1:25:12] just standing down and just jotting a
[1:25:14] few things last week at the end of the
[1:25:15] service is that within this part here
[1:25:18] watch the approach Aquila and Priscilla
[1:25:20] have a great amount of understanding but
[1:25:23] watch how they handle it they don't
[1:25:27] demean him they don't tear him down they
[1:25:30] take him unto themselves and then more
[1:25:33] perfectly they explain or they go into
[1:25:36] him and then after that
[1:25:38] Hey the man is recommended he's
[1:25:40] commended to the rest and it goes on to
[1:25:42] say even that he was helped much in
[1:25:46] verse 27 which had believed through
[1:25:49] grace for he mightily convinced the Jews
[1:25:51] in that publicly showing by the
[1:25:54] scriptures that Jesus was Christ
[1:25:58] I've just just drawn to some things you
[1:26:01] know sometimes things you come through
[1:26:03] over the years and I just put them to
[1:26:05] the side because they're just wonderful
[1:26:06] nuggets that you you come across and
[1:26:08] things that that brother Branham will
[1:26:10] mention here throughout the message and
[1:26:12] in witness in here brother BAM
[1:26:15] take takes an approach and he says he
[1:26:18] said and you think God I know where
[1:26:21] there's a fellow that I believe that I
[1:26:22] could lead to you and a way you'll go
[1:26:25] and talk to him in a nice way so how do
[1:26:29] you do John I want to talk to you
[1:26:31] tonight about going fishing now wait a
[1:26:35] minute wait wait wait we want to lead
[1:26:37] him to Christ but I'm gonna talk to him
[1:26:39] about fishing see what what what what
[1:26:44] the intent that the desire is is to lead
[1:26:47] him to Christ but evidently John likes
[1:26:50] fishing its own the only way that I'm
[1:26:53] gonna be able to gain favor with John is
[1:26:55] talk about fishing if you don't know
[1:26:58] about fishing then you might just want
[1:27:00] to be honest
[1:27:01] don't go try to talk about all the lures
[1:27:03] and stuff that you don't know just kind
[1:27:05] of talk about certain reports that
[1:27:07] you've read about how the walleye are
[1:27:09] biting this year and the different
[1:27:10] things like that but the whole part is
[1:27:12] to get it engaged this is not a Salesman
[1:27:16] this is a part of looking at the heart
[1:27:20] and the life of an individual remember
[1:27:23] what brother bream just said there's a
[1:27:24] man that I know I can lead to you Lord
[1:27:27] now go to talk to him and we'll talk
[1:27:30] about fishing he says all he says yes I
[1:27:35] love to fish pardon me this this wants
[1:27:38] to keep going he says yes I love to fish
[1:27:44] I'll just read it to you
[1:27:46] he said yes I love to fish he said talk
[1:27:50] to him for a while and talk about his
[1:27:55] chickens and or whatever farming he's
[1:27:58] going to do for a while until God opens
[1:28:02] up the way now see look look at the
[1:28:06] contrast here we've talked about Legion
[1:28:08] we talked about the woman of Samaria
[1:28:11] they're telling how their candle got lit
[1:28:13] that's the same thing that's going on
[1:28:15] here but he starts out talking about
[1:28:18] fishing now I wonder if you were sitting
[1:28:21] there and you and in like brother Joe
[1:28:24] and I were gonna go talk and all of a
[1:28:25] sudden here we are and I'm sitting there
[1:28:26] brother Joe and I'm thinking you always
[1:28:28] talked about perch he's talked about
[1:28:30] walleye he's talked about catfish he's
[1:28:31] talked about how many sheep head he's
[1:28:33] throw back he's talked when is he ever
[1:28:35] gonna talk about the Lord he's waiting
[1:28:38] for a door the fishing is only to make
[1:28:44] contact the talking about fishing is
[1:28:47] only to to try to talk with them a
[1:28:49] little bit opening up and it gives you a
[1:28:51] chance to send home the gospel then when
[1:28:54] you win that soul you present it before
[1:28:57] the father like I said I present the
[1:29:00] little present to my wife and I say here
[1:29:02] father was happiness you do it because
[1:29:05] you love it not a duty but a love amen
[1:29:11] now you might have to talk about fishing
[1:29:13] for a couple days you might have to talk
[1:29:18] about hunting or dogs or whatever more
[1:29:20] it might take a little bit right but
[1:29:25] what you're waiting on is the door to
[1:29:27] open oh my let me go - let me go - one
[1:29:32] more one one example here brother
[1:29:37] branham here let me I'm just going to
[1:29:38] close on this
[1:29:41] the bream says brother and he said I
[1:29:43] believe that we have the thing that the
[1:29:46] world must have we've got to approach it
[1:29:50] in a way he said what if you're a
[1:29:52] carpenter said I'll take the man on the
[1:29:55] India brother borders over here he's a
[1:29:57] carpenter I believe what if he was
[1:30:00] driving with a hammer like this and
[1:30:02] driving nails and I had an automatic
[1:30:05] hammer of some sort that I could pour a
[1:30:08] keg of nails into and hold it up like
[1:30:11] this and River River and drive them
[1:30:14] boards up like that a whole lot better
[1:30:16] than he could with his hammer now if I
[1:30:19] walked up to him and I said hi boy
[1:30:21] you're not even with it you know nothing
[1:30:25] about it while you're you're you're just
[1:30:27] mashing your fingers my you haven't got
[1:30:29] a product to begin with he said I'm
[1:30:31] offending him I'll never sell the hammer
[1:30:38] he said it's my approach with what I
[1:30:42] have my product I know it's better than
[1:30:48] what he's got but I've got to remember
[1:30:51] I've got to approach him in the right
[1:30:55] way so bill rehm says I walk up to him
[1:31:00] and says how do you do sir my name is
[1:31:01] Brennan - borders I see you're a
[1:31:04] carpenter yes sir I am
[1:31:06] I really believe you're a real carpenter
[1:31:08] - yes look out he's approaching I
[1:31:12] believe you're a real carpenter I was
[1:31:14] watching the way you was handling your
[1:31:16] hammer
[1:31:17] oh yes Old Betsy has been with me a long
[1:31:19] time I say yeah that's a good one
[1:31:22] sure good - and you could really handle
[1:31:24] it yeah go ahead talk to him in a while
[1:31:26] and I say did you ever hear of a new
[1:31:28] such-and-such a hammer I don't believe I
[1:31:30] ever did
[1:31:31] he said well here it is you put your
[1:31:35] nails in here and let's just tack those
[1:31:38] boards up the up and down here look at
[1:31:40] the time this doesn't and what a product
[1:31:42] I've got show it to him like that and
[1:31:45] say to him look over and says say to him
[1:31:50] take it
[1:31:52] try it for a few days and see what you
[1:31:54] think about it I'll be back if it's the
[1:31:58] right kind of a product it'll sell
[1:32:01] itself it's the approach with it if it's
[1:32:08] the right kind of a product it will sell
[1:32:10] itself and this is what brother brems
[1:32:12] Tolman he says I believe this holy ghost
[1:32:14] that we have is genuine he said but
[1:32:18] we've got to remember the approach that
[1:32:20] were taken with our brethren and he said
[1:32:23] I do believe they are our brethren it's
[1:32:26] the approach that we've got to take so
[1:32:29] to think of us that when we look at this
[1:32:31] tonight and look through this through
[1:32:33] the word that it's the approach that we
[1:32:36] would we would take and how then our
[1:32:38] lives are to be displayed and listen
[1:32:40] friends we're no different than any
[1:32:42] other age and any other time that's
[1:32:44] coming you and I are no different than
[1:32:47] any other person that's ever walked upon
[1:32:49] upon this earth we have to deal with
[1:32:51] pride and that comes even with truth
[1:32:56] that it doesn't it's not a part of the
[1:32:58] truth but it can come right around it
[1:33:00] because this first birth that we still
[1:33:03] walk here within this body remember it
[1:33:07] still is very susceptible to pride
[1:33:10] whether it's things that's spoken or the
[1:33:12] ways that it's things it's looked at
[1:33:14] Paul himself said I was given a
[1:33:17] messenger in the flesh from Satan to
[1:33:21] buff at me lest I should become exalted
[1:33:25] to recognize this grace that has come to
[1:33:28] us our light ah you know the main of the
[1:33:32] times that will sometimes get an even
[1:33:34] opportunity to be able to express
[1:33:36] something to someone else it comes by
[1:33:38] the life that's lived it's not about the
[1:33:41] thing everything that we can say it's by
[1:33:43] the life that's live God help us to live
[1:33:46] lives that are clutter-free if there's
[1:33:49] any clutter net clutter thought feeling
[1:33:52] attitude any clutter any unbelief god I
[1:33:55] want to remove the clutter I don't want
[1:33:58] there to be any any hindrance I don't
[1:34:00] want anything to block that light of the
[1:34:03] city on the hill
[1:34:04] if there's trimming that needs to be
[1:34:06] done let our laps be trimmed so that
[1:34:11] it's not all carbon up and smoked up and
[1:34:14] let it be trimmed so that the light
[1:34:16] itself is burning fervently because even
[1:34:20] when our lives all around we we just
[1:34:23] don't know from that of our neighbors to
[1:34:26] even the people in our job to maybe even
[1:34:28] somebody that's waited on you behind the
[1:34:30] meat counter for years you just don't
[1:34:34] know but this world is craving and
[1:34:39] longing for reality they're not wanting
[1:34:43] promises come on somebody they're not
[1:34:47] wanting promises they they want to see
[1:34:50] promises in a reality and I believe with
[1:34:56] all my heart
[1:34:57] the light of God shining through our
[1:35:00] lives it is a declaration to point
[1:35:03] people in this hour that the Living God
[1:35:05] is present and is on the scene that
[1:35:08] whatever that there is a need God
[1:35:11] Himself is sufficient to provide for
[1:35:15] that need it don't take a lot of words
[1:35:18] it don't take a lot of knowledge it just
[1:35:21] takes a lot of yielding it takes a lot
[1:35:24] of humility takes a lot and just let God
[1:35:28] direct it tell how you candle got lit
[1:35:32] hey man they want to talk about things
[1:35:35] within the scriptures let them talk
[1:35:38] about things in the scriptures see where
[1:35:39] they're gonna go from me personally when
[1:35:42] I sit down
[1:35:43] and I do Bible studies with different
[1:35:45] ones that don't even come here to this
[1:35:48] assembly I don't sit down with an agenda
[1:35:50] that's me let's take our Bibles and
[1:35:54] let's see where we go
[1:35:56] let's see where God will take us because
[1:35:58] there's God there's questions on their
[1:36:00] heart and I believe that God knows how
[1:36:02] to direct that there have been times
[1:36:04] where I've taken things on Bible studies
[1:36:06] where people have asked the question we
[1:36:08] want to know this and we'll sit down
[1:36:09] right with it and go right through it
[1:36:11] but the point but the thing of it is is
[1:36:13] that there's questions that people have
[1:36:14] on their heart and just
[1:36:16] number this remember this that many
[1:36:20] times in lives and hearts we want to see
[1:36:22] lives that are lit desire to see people
[1:36:25] that have come to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:36:28] and sometimes there's things that where
[1:36:30] there may not be necessarily where a
[1:36:32] person would come here don't look at it
[1:36:34] as a defeat that they don't come and
[1:36:36] darken these doors but has their life
[1:36:38] itself been taken from where they are
[1:36:42] you with me which I can always rejoice
[1:36:47] with those things right there if a
[1:36:49] person is taken they're taken from a bar
[1:36:51] room and they have met the Lord Jesus
[1:36:54] Christ as their Savior
[1:36:56] I can rejoice in that sometimes our
[1:37:00] testimony listen to me sometimes your
[1:37:02] light in the testimony it isn't always
[1:37:04] just pointing to that of where of the
[1:37:07] opening and the light of what God is
[1:37:09] open in this hour remember what that
[1:37:11] light is showing it's showing the Lord
[1:37:13] Jesus Christ if it's showing anything
[1:37:16] other than the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:37:18] not the true light are you with me the
[1:37:21] true light will always point people to
[1:37:24] the Lord Jesus Christ and they if they
[1:37:27] don't have a hunger and a thirst for
[1:37:29] anything deeper that's between them and
[1:37:31] God but let our light so shine that they
[1:37:36] might see our good works your loving
[1:37:41] tonight
[1:37:46] Heavenly Father
[1:37:50] Lord very simple and what I pray that
[1:37:56] for each of our lives in our hearts Lord
[1:38:02] in our homes or everywhere that we go
[1:38:06] late may our desire is that I liked what
[1:38:12] so shine Lord Jesus help us Lord to walk
[1:38:20] in that humility like Aquila and
[1:38:21] Priscilla what I look at those those two
[1:38:26] how many times they were mentioned in
[1:38:28] letters of commendation in words that
[1:38:30] would refer to other Saints a comfort
[1:38:34] what a life what a testimony and Lord as
[1:38:39] Paul would mention of them and countless
[1:38:41] places in the scripture to salute the
[1:38:44] Saints to see Lord God
[1:38:51] as they took a paulus to see that
[1:38:53] humility in that understanding Lord we
[1:38:58] ask God that she would help us
[1:39:02] opportunities Lord we never know when
[1:39:06] that opportunity is going to present
[1:39:08] itself
[1:39:11] sometimes Lord opportunities present
[1:39:14] themselves
[1:39:16] to those people the Lord maybe have been
[1:39:19] the very ones that have been skeptics 5
[1:39:24] the Lord God always in your hearts
[1:39:28] showing Lord that Lord God has helped us
[1:39:34] for we never know Lord in those
[1:39:36] opportunities we don't know Lord maybe
[1:39:39] the person that we're we've been talking
[1:39:42] to we've spoke to them Lord
[1:39:45] sit down with them in the scriptures
[1:39:47] maybe someone walking working right next
[1:39:51] to maybe a family member Lord
[1:39:54] Oh Lord Jesus
[1:39:59] may our lives be that or God truly a
[1:40:03] city that said only help us tonight Lord
[1:40:08] father my hand Lord hands are up Lord I
[1:40:14] don't want any clutter in my life Lord
[1:40:17] we don't want clutter Lord God we want
[1:40:21] it to shine in purity we wanted to shine
[1:40:25] in power not things that we have to say
[1:40:27] a life that is lived or Jesus that our
[1:40:35] lives Oh God
[1:40:38] a testimony a billboard a display
[1:40:44] help us tonight Lord father maybe for
[1:40:48] one that has an unbelieving spouse I
[1:40:51] pray that God may they be the best
[1:40:54] billboard Lloyd this Peter would speak
[1:40:58] about how the conversation the conduct
[1:41:00] in their life a testimony a billboard of
[1:41:07] the saving grace of Almighty God Brennan
[1:41:12] would give him strength Lloyd sometimes
[1:41:15] the winds and the trials sometimes smart
[1:41:17] things that said sometimes things look
[1:41:19] discouraging that I prayed tonight Lord
[1:41:22] God knowing
[1:41:28] and what has taken place in our lives
[1:41:30] it's real
[1:41:33] we're aware Lord God and what you've
[1:41:37] done in our lives you can take the
[1:41:41] hardest person
[1:41:43] and you could change him in a moment's
[1:41:45] time you could take a person Lord God to
[1:41:48] where that nobody would even want to
[1:41:51] mention their name but in your presence
[1:41:53] in a moment's time you can so touch that
[1:41:56] life like you did of that woman of
[1:41:58] Samaria that condition of her life she
[1:42:02] was hungry she was thirsty Lord and she
[1:42:09] found what she had been hungry for what
[1:42:12] she'd been thirsting for no doubt Lord
[1:42:15] throughout that city there were many
[1:42:17] others who were hungry who were thirsty
[1:42:19] or else they would have never responded
[1:42:22] to that billboard that went running down
[1:42:26] through that city with just a few words
[1:42:29] come see a man who told me hold that I
[1:42:33] ever done but they responded to that
[1:42:37] billboard Lord and they came to your
[1:42:40] feet Lord Jesus and they heard you
[1:42:44] they receive from you what she received
[1:42:48] [Music]

[1:43:07] by the power of God nor daughter it's
[1:43:11] not a picture of a candle but it's a
[1:43:13] it's a living flame living life a living
[1:43:17] reality Lord Oh God
[1:43:20] we can only declare Lord God from what
[1:43:23] you've done in our lives
[1:43:27] we love you Lord Jesus we appreciate you
[1:43:31] hood how we thank you Lord God for your
[1:43:35] great presence Lord and our lives

[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:35] [Applause]
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:42] one time probably many of you can relate
[1:48:45] to this I had a had a gentleman on my
[1:48:48] coaching staff the first year I got
[1:48:50] hired and he and I would ride together
[1:48:53] he was he was a pastor he would ride
[1:48:56] together I didn't ride with my other two
[1:48:58] coaches because I just didn't really
[1:49:01] care for all the atmosphere some he and
[1:49:04] I would ride together we got up there
[1:49:07] and we were scouting a game we'd come
[1:49:09] out and got done scouting the game out
[1:49:10] of the out of Michigan that time and and
[1:49:13] we come out of that game and we've done
[1:49:15] scouting and on the way home you know I
[1:49:17] happen to have a tape in the car and I
[1:49:18] said hey I said Leonard I said I see
[1:49:21] wanting some good preaching Leonard said
[1:49:23] sure man put on the token priest in
[1:49:26] Dallas Texas then we had a time in the
[1:49:28] car how many we had a time I didn't say
[1:49:31] nothing to him I didn't let him know
[1:49:32] this who this I'm one I didn't need to
[1:49:35] do all that but I put it on we were just
[1:49:37] rejoicing I just felt to do that man he
[1:49:39] said I ain't never heard nothing like
[1:49:40] this he said I never heard another he
[1:49:45] said somebody took this out here in
[1:49:47] Exodus 12 and took that token he said
[1:49:50] and started working man he said I never
[1:49:52] know like that
[1:49:53] and he's identifying with it and and you
[1:49:55] know you you know when you listen to and
[1:49:58] Allison and and Leonard after that you
[1:50:00] know there were things that it began to
[1:50:02] be an open door where where Leonard said
[1:50:04] he said you know what man he said
[1:50:05] sometimes he said these times he said I
[1:50:07] want you to come preach he said from my
[1:50:08] church there right there but you know
[1:50:12] our paths and things just kind of it
[1:50:15] separated after a couple years and but
[1:50:19] what I come to the point is is that God
[1:50:21] knows how to lead you at that time I
[1:50:23] felt I felt to go ahead I could do that
[1:50:26] because I didn't have to explain to
[1:50:27] anything they didn't have to look at a
[1:50:28] book cover I could put that right on and
[1:50:31] then you begin to play
[1:50:33] there was something about it but then
[1:50:36] there's other times where it might be a
[1:50:37] testimony out of your life and now
[1:50:40] you're talking about is what God has
[1:50:43] done for you personally because let us
[1:50:47] remember that in all that we do if
[1:50:50] whatever we are given what we are giving
[1:50:53] to someone we are saying my life is
[1:50:56] identified with this it's identified
[1:51:00] with this to be the truth
[1:51:03] amen may God help us god bless you
[1:51:11] tonight you're dismissed in the name of
[1:51:13] the Lord we'll just sing that again Lord
