[42:08] Heavenly Father
[42:10] Lord what a privilege it is Lord that we

[42:16] father Lord and oh God it's Lord more

[43:30] Lord for every life and every heart o
[43:33] God we just love you and we thank you
[43:36] now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[43:39] amen
[43:40] amen let's read First Corinthians
[43:43] chapter 10.
[43:45] and verse 16.
[43:49] amen
[43:57] did you get it
[44:05] First Corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[44:09] 16.
[44:11] the cup of blessing
[44:14] which we bless
[44:15] is it not the communion of the blood of
[44:19] Christ
[44:20] the bread which we break is it not the
[44:24] communion of the body of Christ
[44:28] for we being many
[44:30] are one bread and one body
[44:34] for we are all partakers
[44:37] of that one bread I want to read that
[44:39] verse again
[44:41] for we being many are one bread and one
[44:45] body
[44:46] for we are all partakers of that one
[44:50] bread
[44:52] and may the Lord bless you bless the
[44:54] reading of the word as you're being
[44:55] seated
[44:56] I'd just like to speak for
[44:59] a few moments this morning on one bread
[45:02] and one body
[45:04] and I know this is a
[45:07] later this evening or this afternoon
[45:09] we'll have communion service but
[45:11] the thought in itself is where we have
[45:14] worked and I just paused there from what
[45:17] we have been dealing with and come back
[45:18] into this thought
[45:20] of how that God working in the body of
[45:23] Jesus Christ because it's God working in
[45:26] US individually
[45:28] but we are not on an island
[45:31] all to ourselves
[45:33] we are we are a part of the body of
[45:37] Jesus Christ
[45:38] and so when we see this here in the
[45:42] scripture I want to go if we look into
[45:45] Luke chapter 22 and verse 14.
[45:49] and the Bible because Paul is referring
[45:51] to this and what we just read of what
[45:54] all of it what what it was speaking of
[45:58] and it says when the hour was come he
[46:01] sat down and The Twelve Apostles with
[46:03] him and he said unto them with desire
[46:06] have I desired to eat this Passover with
[46:10] you before I suffer for I say unto you I
[46:14] will not eat any more thereof until it
[46:16] be fulfilled in the kingdom of God
[46:19] and he took the cup and gave thanks and
[46:23] said take this and divide it among
[46:26] yourselves for I say unto you I will not
[46:29] drink of the fruit of the vine until the
[46:32] kingdom of God shall come
[46:34] and he took bread and gave thanks and
[46:37] break it and gave unto them saying this
[46:40] is my body which is given for you this
[46:43] due in remembrance of me
[46:45] likewise also the cup after supper
[46:48] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[46:52] my blood which is shed for you
[46:57] so recognizing when the Lord Jesus would
[47:01] say I have desired to eat this Passover
[47:04] with you here is arriving at a moment to
[47:09] where now it's going to move from just a
[47:12] type
[47:13] to the annotype being fulfilled where
[47:16] Israel had kept the Passover as God had
[47:19] given them but that Passover was
[47:21] speaking and was announcing that there
[47:24] was truly going to come a perfect Lamb
[47:29] of God one in whom where the animal life
[47:33] that life could never come back upon the
[47:36] worshiper but God made provision and he
[47:39] said there in Egypt after all the signs
[47:42] were given there came what was what was
[47:46] the most important was is that there
[47:49] would come a deliverance and the only
[47:51] way that Deliverance could come was that
[47:54] the blood of an innocent one would be
[47:57] applied
[47:58] so they would have to take a lamb it
[48:01] would be personal and they would slay
[48:03] the lamb they would they would Mark the
[48:06] the lentil and the doorpost and remember
[48:08] as we look at it it they never were to
[48:11] put the blood on the threshold because
[48:13] you're never to walk over the blood but
[48:16] we're always to walk under the blood and
[48:18] I think it's something that we look at
[48:21] in our lives that if when Jesus talks
[48:23] about the sheep and he says I'm the door
[48:26] of the sheep holding he that cometh
[48:28] through the door cometh come by me and
[48:32] then when he goes in and out he shall
[48:34] find Pastor I I believe it's the desire
[48:37] of every believer's heart that we
[48:40] understand we have to live in this world
[48:42] we walk in this world but I don't want
[48:45] to go anywhere that I can't go under the
[48:48] blood if I can't go out if I can't go
[48:51] under the blood then I don't want to be
[48:53] there because if Jesus is not welcome
[48:55] then I don't want to be there
[48:57] and we understand what that would mean I
[49:00] understand we get on the jobs and things
[49:02] like that and know that in many of those
[49:04] jobs and things that the Lord Jesus
[49:06] himself he's not welcome but it's quite
[49:08] a difference than going to other places
[49:10] in the world that you realize Jesus
[49:13] wouldn't go to those places and so when
[49:16] we look at this and examine of one body
[49:19] and one bread or one bread and one body
[49:22] and I want to read that once again in
[49:24] First Corinthians chapter 10 if you'll
[49:26] go back up to that for a moment it says
[49:28] the cup of blessing which we bless is it
[49:31] not the communion of the blood of Christ
[49:35] and the bread which we break is it not
[49:38] the communion of the body of Christ for
[49:41] we being many are one bread and one body
[49:46] for we are partakers of that one bread
[49:50] now in John chapter 6 when Jesus is
[49:54] standing there
[49:55] and remember there has been many that
[49:58] have followed him for the Miracles and
[50:02] the signs and the Wonders and and it's
[50:04] it's really got their attention but then
[50:07] when the Declaration came and they asked
[50:10] the question what must we do that we
[50:13] might work the works of God they're
[50:15] looking at what they know to be works of
[50:18] God and Jesus brings it in the
[50:21] Simplicity that the true work of God is
[50:25] that you would believe on him whom the
[50:30] father hath sent
[50:32] that's the true work I tell you let me
[50:34] just say it like this when you talk
[50:36] about the miraculous you talk about the
[50:39] supernatural there's no greater Miracle
[50:42] than being able to recognize him and to
[50:46] believe him and to receive him
[50:49] there's many miracles that's true but
[50:51] there's no greater Miracle than that and
[50:54] then that in our own lives to experience
[50:58] the Redemptive grace of God that changes
[51:02] us where all things are passed away and
[51:05] behold all things have become new that's
[51:08] the greatest Miracle there is
[51:10] that's what it's all about all of the
[51:13] other signs all the other wonders are to
[51:16] declare that he is here
[51:19] so it wasn't they were chasing after
[51:22] Loaves and miracles they were chasing
[51:25] after signs but all of that was done
[51:28] that it would get the attention to
[51:31] recognize there is a God who is present
[51:35] that has come down to meet your needs
[51:41] I want you to think of this here for a
[51:43] moment Jesus could say I am that bread
[51:46] that has come down out of Heaven I am
[51:50] that bread so we're not just speaking of
[51:52] and we understand
[51:54] of a natural bread we're not speaking of
[51:57] even as Jesus and they could say our
[52:00] fathers ate man in the wilderness but
[52:02] Jesus said they're everyone dead
[52:05] but here this was what was promised that
[52:08] Manna was all in type but this bread was
[52:13] speaking of that reality of what is to
[52:17] come and what would move down right here
[52:20] Among Us in this moment
[52:23] Hallelujah you okay brother Joey
[52:27] let's pray for our brother I just I've
[52:29] I've looked past it let's just pray for
[52:31] him by your heads please
[52:33] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I lay my
[52:37] hands O God upon my brother Lord
[52:39] according to the commission of your word
[52:41] Lord I pray that God that you'll bring
[52:44] Lord to release the Lord in his body
[52:46] right now Satan in the name of Jesus
[52:49] Christ I adjure you to take your hands
[52:51] off and I rebuke you in the name of the
[52:54] Lord Jesus Christ granted Lord I pray in
[52:57] Jesus precious name that healing Lord in
[53:01] virtue Lord would move Lord through his
[53:03] body right now for the glory of almighty
[53:06] God in Jesus precious name
[53:09] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[53:12] Hallelujah
[53:14] glory be to God
[53:16] I am that bread and he said except you
[53:20] would eat the Flesh of the son of man
[53:22] and drink his blood you have no life in
[53:24] you that stumbled many
[53:27] is that right
[53:28] because let me say this to you they had
[53:31] they had previous scripture they could
[53:33] go to and say hey wait a minute we're
[53:35] not we're not even supposed to eat
[53:37] certain things let alone the blood but
[53:39] you see now come what that was pointing
[53:42] to was that there would come a true
[53:45] reality where a person would be able to
[53:50] become a partaker not of an animal blood
[53:53] but of the blood of Jesus Christ which
[53:57] is what God's own life
[54:01] that's what would come to the believer
[54:04] and the believer would be a partaker of
[54:07] the bread of almighty God which is the
[54:10] word so let me just say this we cannot
[54:13] it's not just to be a partaker of the
[54:15] spirit but it's also when we're a
[54:17] partaker of the spirit we are also a
[54:20] partaker of the bread
[54:22] and if we're a partaker of the bread
[54:23] we're a partaker of the spirit because
[54:26] they that worship Him must worship Him
[54:28] in spirit and in truth
[54:31] is that right that's why we as Believers
[54:35] recognize our we're not walking under uh
[54:39] oh I felt the presence of God but our
[54:42] lives we're looking and there's a
[54:44] reality something in us that when I
[54:46] don't feel his presence there is
[54:48] something that is burning within my
[54:50] heart I know it's not I who is living
[54:54] but it's Christ who's living in me I'm
[54:56] not the same person that I used to be
[55:01] I've Been Changed he is my life he is My
[55:04] All In All that's the difference we're
[55:06] not just yes we enjoy God's presence but
[55:09] it's to have his presence here in the
[55:12] midst of Our Lives
[55:16] because everyone through the scriptures
[55:19] that's ever partaken of that bread just
[55:22] like the little woman at the well we
[55:24] don't even know her name but when that
[55:26] word was being made manifest that the
[55:28] others called in that day Beelzebub
[55:34] you couldn't put a finger on their life
[55:36] but they rejected him
[55:39] and they knew what was taking place they
[55:42] did could not denounce it they had to
[55:45] admit in their private meetings there
[55:48] was one who let the cat out of the bag
[55:49] by the name of Nicodemus we know thou
[55:52] art a teacher sent from God
[55:55] but they were unwilling and unable to
[55:59] Humble themselves to The Living Word of
[56:02] God
[56:05] they were unwilling to do that and yet
[56:07] that's what they needed that was the
[56:09] whole purpose that's what the law that's
[56:11] when everything was pointing to there
[56:13] was a coming Messiah there is one who
[56:17] was coming that would pay the ultimate
[56:20] price that would bring the real promises
[56:23] that God made to Abraham when he stood
[56:26] before his kid doing flesh that same God
[56:29] would make them a reality in their lives
[56:36] so that's the real the real uh reality
[56:41] when remember when Melchizedek met
[56:44] Abraham in Genesis 14 after the battle
[56:47] was over what did Melchizedek give him
[56:51] that Melchizedek it's none other than
[56:54] God
[56:55] is that right Paul picks that up he who
[56:58] never had beginning of days nor ending
[57:00] of life nor father mother there's only
[57:02] one that could be and that's God
[57:04] but it was God revealing himself as the
[57:07] king and high priest it was God
[57:10] revealing himself and when Abraham had
[57:13] overcome the victory what did he give
[57:16] Abraham Bread and Wine he gave what was
[57:21] needed this is that of the meal the
[57:24] sustenance of the Overcomers let me tell
[57:28] you something you'll never be able to
[57:30] overcome in this hour without feeding on
[57:34] the word of almighty God
[57:37] it'll take more than a church life
[57:40] it'll take more than just being
[57:42] associated with a few people it's going
[57:46] to take a real true uniting with the
[57:50] Holy Spirit by the new birth
[57:54] nothing else will do
[57:57] this is where the Lord Jesus when he had
[58:00] even prayed and he was Desiring of this
[58:03] that when we see that the True Church of
[58:07] the Living God is made up of the word of
[58:10] God and the spirit of God operating in
[58:12] her and through her we are one bread and
[58:15] one body remember Jesus prayed in John
[58:19] 17 and we've looked at this here in some
[58:22] Services how he prayed that they may be
[58:25] one and he wasn't speaking of that we
[58:28] just get a group of people together but
[58:30] there's a Oneness that's being called
[58:33] for a Oneness that man fell from in the
[58:37] beginning you see it's God's desire to
[58:41] be one with his children when God moved
[58:44] there in the beginning it is God
[58:47] revealing himself not that he has a
[58:50] family but it is that God is a family
[58:54] he's dwelling with his children when he
[58:57] went here he brought forth Adam and then
[59:00] here's Eve it's God dwelling with his
[59:02] children they had perfect Fellowship
[59:04] perfect love there was perfect
[59:07] understanding here they were walking in
[59:10] that place that God had ordained them to
[59:12] walk and what was most important is they
[59:15] had God's own life in them yeah but what
[59:19] separated that is sin came in
[59:23] there's many attributes of sin
[59:26] drinking smoking lusting and on and on
[59:30] dressing and everything those are all
[59:32] attributes
[59:34] are you hearing me
[59:36] you can cut out the drinking but you
[59:38] still got to get to the unbelief that's
[59:40] only an attribute
[59:42] looks like somebody that continues to
[59:43] have a symptom in their life and then
[59:45] the doctor only wants to give you a pill
[59:47] that'll actually only address the
[59:50] symptom instead of really getting down
[59:52] to some heart-to-heart talk and say hey
[59:54] there's some things got to change in
[59:56] your life
[59:58] the gospel never came to numb us to
[1:00:02] symptoms
[1:00:04] it came to address the real problem
[1:00:09] we were born in sin shaped in iniquity
[1:00:13] it taken a blood to be shed for the
[1:00:17] remission of our sins that the life in
[1:00:20] that blood then could come to you and I
[1:00:23] and seek you and I out
[1:00:26] it's God's desire to take and together
[1:00:29] his children back to himself this was
[1:00:32] the prayer that they may be one now how
[1:00:35] is this going to be Jesus said the glory
[1:00:38] that you've given me that Glory that I
[1:00:41] had with thee That Glory that now as
[1:00:43] that Glory has come down and it has
[1:00:46] brought that expression it has quickened
[1:00:48] that word in my life that same remember
[1:00:51] when he was baptized in the River Jordan
[1:00:54] right he was always the word he was born
[1:00:57] the word but now when he walks up out of
[1:00:59] the river charted it now is the word
[1:01:02] made flesh you say well how couldn't it
[1:01:04] have been the word made flesh before
[1:01:06] because it takes the quickening power to
[1:01:09] come upon the word to make the word live
[1:01:12] and it is the fire that declares it's
[1:01:15] not water it's gasoline that's there
[1:01:18] are you hearing me now amen this is my
[1:01:22] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:01:25] dwell and so now that Oneness to Glory
[1:01:29] thou has given me I have given them that
[1:01:33] they might be one
[1:01:35] even as Thou Art In Me
[1:01:40] and I in them
[1:01:42] that they would be one
[1:01:44] now the thing that's the prayer of the
[1:01:47] Lord Jesus that we that it would come to
[1:01:50] that reality within every heart and then
[1:01:54] God working with that Harmony working in
[1:01:57] every life every member and within the
[1:02:01] body of Jesus Christ to wear there is a
[1:02:04] harmony with one another because that's
[1:02:06] the only that's the only grounds of
[1:02:08] Fellowship
[1:02:11] you you understand I think we understand
[1:02:13] these are common words to us grounds of
[1:02:15] Fellowship in other words this is the
[1:02:17] only way to really have fellowship with
[1:02:19] God is that Christ himself would be in
[1:02:23] you
[1:02:26] now it's like this when you invite it
[1:02:28] just heard it this morning when you
[1:02:30] invite him in to your life and say Lord
[1:02:33] I'm a sinner you know that's one great
[1:02:35] reality that's that's a starting point
[1:02:37] right there
[1:02:38] if you don't recognize yourself a sinner
[1:02:40] you're in trouble
[1:02:42] well I went to Sunday school you're
[1:02:44] still a sinner and you still need
[1:02:47] repentance
[1:02:48] and it's not a man to lead you in that
[1:02:50] it's where a conviction strikes your
[1:02:53] heart
[1:02:55] and the conviction moves in your heart
[1:02:57] and says hey what must I do to be saved
[1:03:02] it's working in Repentance and to think
[1:03:05] of how that the grounds of Fellowship
[1:03:08] even when the Holy Spirit comes into a
[1:03:11] life let him lead you now I'm talking
[1:03:14] about when he comes in as your savior
[1:03:16] let him lead you let him work in your
[1:03:20] life let him go in every room in your
[1:03:23] life if there are things in your life
[1:03:25] that are not right and not pleasing to
[1:03:28] him let him remedy that in your life let
[1:03:32] him fully come in
[1:03:35] Samuel what are you saying I'm saying
[1:03:37] don't just let him on the mat and then
[1:03:41] allow the enemy to discourage you as
[1:03:43] though nothing happened if you let him
[1:03:45] in under justification let him be a
[1:03:49] sanctifier let him go through every room
[1:03:51] say Lord go through every room
[1:03:54] even once you're going through the attic
[1:03:56] in my life
[1:03:57] every area Lord in My Life Cleanse it
[1:04:01] out Lord because I want this to be a
[1:04:03] place that you are welcome I just don't
[1:04:06] want you to visit me once in a while I
[1:04:08] want you to dwell in my life
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:15] Hallelujah
[1:04:17] now when we see that that's the grounds
[1:04:20] for Fellowship
[1:04:23] and to think of how that here we are in
[1:04:26] this life that we live in
[1:04:29] it's very much like in Genesis 1
[1:04:33] we're in Genesis 1 the Bible said God
[1:04:36] made man in his own image and in his own
[1:04:40] likeness and here man was a spirit man
[1:04:43] now when the Bible says this it says God
[1:04:46] created male and female so here in the
[1:04:49] beginning here in in that of the spirit
[1:04:52] the spirit itself when God made in the
[1:04:56] beginning then from that he places now
[1:04:59] Adam or places that into a body of Flesh
[1:05:03] and then once it's in that body of Flesh
[1:05:06] once here is Adam dwelling there in that
[1:05:09] body of Flesh then what does God do God
[1:05:12] puts Adam to sleep and he opens up his
[1:05:16] side and he takes from Adam he takes a
[1:05:21] rib and it begins to multiply cell on
[1:05:25] top of Sal on top of cell then he takes
[1:05:28] from the original spirit
[1:05:31] from that same Spirit God doesn't make
[1:05:33] another spirit it's the same spirit and
[1:05:36] he takes from there and he places he
[1:05:39] separates masculine from feminine and
[1:05:41] God places that Spirit right into that
[1:05:45] byproduct or that body of Flesh let me
[1:05:48] just read it to you how the prophet put
[1:05:50] it there in paragraph 20 of Oneness he
[1:05:53] says don't you see the picture we in
[1:05:56] flesh are different
[1:05:58] I don't think that takes a rocket
[1:06:00] scientist to look around this room we're
[1:06:03] different
[1:06:04] is that right
[1:06:06] we're like a bright byproduct a created
[1:06:09] being by holy wedlock but in spirit now
[1:06:13] this is what's important in spirit we
[1:06:15] are sons and daughters and not some
[1:06:18] other Spirit but the spirit of the
[1:06:20] Living God we are in his likeness in his
[1:06:23] unity in the perfect image of the Living
[1:06:25] God because we become sons and daughters
[1:06:31] not separated but the Same Spirit the
[1:06:34] same God the same person joined in
[1:06:36] wedlock to the Eternal see how God
[1:06:39] planned it that we should should be not
[1:06:43] a different but him not some other being
[1:06:46] of some other tribe but a real Union and
[1:06:50] offspring of the almighty done by a holy
[1:06:54] Union the body comes from mother and
[1:06:57] father but the spirit come from God
[1:06:59] God's separating himself as Adam was
[1:07:03] separated
[1:07:04] now watch this on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:07] we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of
[1:07:10] fire separating itself and setting upon
[1:07:14] each member of that church God putting
[1:07:18] himself together
[1:07:21] then with that group of people together
[1:07:23] what does it do now notice with that
[1:07:26] group of people together not just a
[1:07:28] group of people together but with that
[1:07:31] group of people together
[1:07:33] are you hearing me with that group of
[1:07:35] people together it brings back the
[1:07:38] unified body of the Lord Jesus coming
[1:07:41] together
[1:07:43] he took bread and broke it for you and I
[1:07:47] he paid the price for you and I his
[1:07:50] blood was shed for the remission of our
[1:07:54] sin but as that bread was broken and
[1:07:57] here it's broke there and it's given out
[1:07:59] in many pieces what was it you and I
[1:08:02] were always a part of the bread of the
[1:08:06] word
[1:08:07] Hallelujah but we could not assemble
[1:08:10] ourselves who can bring pieces of bread
[1:08:12] and bring it back together to where it
[1:08:15] doesn't look fragmented they're all put
[1:08:18] together you know if you took bread and
[1:08:20] broke it up you can't join it back
[1:08:22] together but we're not talking about a
[1:08:25] natural bread we're talking about the
[1:08:27] word we're talking about the body of
[1:08:30] Jesus Christ we're talking about the
[1:08:32] supernatural of almighty God that's
[1:08:35] dwelling and drawing upon pieces of the
[1:08:38] bread he's drawing on that piece of the
[1:08:40] bread that seed a promise in your life
[1:08:43] what is it it's a holy spirit that was
[1:08:46] in the blood cell what's he doing he is
[1:08:49] drawing on that part in you that is
[1:08:52] really him
[1:08:54] [Music]
[1:08:57] We Are One bread one party
[1:09:02] and the Mystery of the Holy Spirit
[1:09:04] working Among Us is you don't see Fred
[1:09:08] you don't see the fragmented parts and
[1:09:11] places but you're seeing the unity of
[1:09:14] the body of Jesus Christ
[1:09:17] let me just try to develop this just a
[1:09:19] moment here in Ephesians 5 23. for the
[1:09:23] husband is the head of the wife even as
[1:09:26] Christ is the head of the church and he
[1:09:30] is the savior of the body
[1:09:33] he gave his life for the body
[1:09:36] are there others outside of the Lamb's
[1:09:39] Book that benefit from him giving coming
[1:09:42] to redeem yes
[1:09:45] will there be others saved yes
[1:09:48] but remember that every message to every
[1:09:52] age is sent with the elect in mind
[1:09:56] there'll be others that are benefited
[1:09:58] and are blessed
[1:10:01] is that right
[1:10:03] but you see that's why that God even as
[1:10:07] this works in the hearts of the believer
[1:10:10] Jesus said no man can come unto me
[1:10:15] he didn't say no man could be drug unto
[1:10:17] me pushed unto me pulled unto me no man
[1:10:20] can come unto me except it was given by
[1:10:25] my father
[1:10:26] so what are you saying brother Samuel
[1:10:28] the assembling of the body of Jesus
[1:10:31] Christ of the bread is not a work of man
[1:10:36] yeah
[1:10:38] the word command produces organization
[1:10:43] and it displays itself because
[1:10:46] organization is not under the headship
[1:10:49] of the holy spirit that unites the
[1:10:53] people with the word
[1:10:55] and unites him with the Creed unites him
[1:10:57] with a dogma and what does it do you see
[1:11:00] the fragmented bitterness that
[1:11:03] organization produces that's why in our
[1:11:06] heart and in our life it is imperative
[1:11:09] that our walk stay fresh and clean and
[1:11:13] sweet before God that we do not want to
[1:11:17] have an organizational life
[1:11:21] the Samuel Watson organizational life
[1:11:23] well the prophet said it's simple and is
[1:11:25] your life worthy of the Gospel a life
[1:11:28] that fails to walk daily with God
[1:11:33] Hallelujah I need him
[1:11:36] I need him I need more of him and not
[1:11:38] just that I need I want more of him
[1:11:43] I want more of him
[1:11:45] less of me
[1:11:47] all right
[1:11:50] Colossians 1 18 and he is the head of
[1:11:54] the body the church who is the beginning
[1:11:56] the firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:11:58] things he might have the preeminence
[1:12:00] Ephesians 4 4 there is one body
[1:12:04] everybody say that with me there is one
[1:12:06] body and one Spirit even as ye are
[1:12:10] called in one hope of your calling
[1:12:14] one Lord One Faith one baptism one God
[1:12:18] and Father of all who is above all
[1:12:21] through all and in you all
[1:12:24] First Corinthians 12 verse 12 for as the
[1:12:28] body is one and hath many members and
[1:12:32] all the members of that one body being
[1:12:34] many are one body so also is Christ for
[1:12:38] by one Spirit are we all baptized into
[1:12:42] one body
[1:12:46] oh I love this whether we be Jews or
[1:12:49] Gentiles whether we be bounder-free
[1:12:52] God is not looking at nationalities God
[1:12:57] is not looking at if you were a good
[1:13:00] person or a bad person
[1:13:02] all right
[1:13:04] the Holy Spirit has come to seek and
[1:13:08] save that which was lost
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] let me tell you something if we were
[1:13:14] good then Calvary wasn't needed
[1:13:18] but the Bible said there is not one who
[1:13:21] is good no not one
[1:13:25] we needed the Sovereign Grace of God our
[1:13:29] righteousness alone would never do it as
[1:13:31] a matter of fact our righteousness to
[1:13:33] obtain God's favor he said it's filthy
[1:13:36] rags when we rest on that instead of
[1:13:39] resting on I'm doing it to please you
[1:13:42] Lord that's the difference when God
[1:13:44] comes in alive we do righteously not out
[1:13:48] of fear we do righteously because it's a
[1:13:51] desire within us to please him
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:56] Hallelujah
[1:13:58] Glory Be The God for by one Spirit are
[1:14:02] we all baptized into one body notice
[1:14:04] baptize not hand shook in it
[1:14:07] I know these are simple things but it's
[1:14:09] not name on a book you don't read that
[1:14:13] is right
[1:14:14] that's not Bible
[1:14:16] that's not the gospel
[1:14:19] a person's name on a book or let me just
[1:14:22] bring it an affiliation around the
[1:14:24] message is not enough
[1:14:27] he did not make a way and send back the
[1:14:29] Holy Ghost so that you and I could just
[1:14:31] be affiliated with a pretty good group
[1:14:34] of people he sent this message
[1:14:38] to declare to you you were included in
[1:14:42] my thoughts before the foundation of the
[1:14:45] world I scared my blood for you and I've
[1:14:49] sent back the Holy Ghost to draw you you
[1:14:54] wouldn't even know how to find him I
[1:14:56] wouldn't know how to find him but he
[1:14:58] came and he found you and I
[1:15:01] and let me tell you this morning you
[1:15:03] might say I'm as lost and lost can be
[1:15:05] you're not too lost that Jesus can't
[1:15:08] find you
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:12] [Applause]
[1:15:14] God
[1:15:16] scattered the people
[1:15:18] across the Earth
[1:15:21] let me just read this
[1:15:23] so I don't have to necessarily preach it
[1:15:25] out of the message Oneness brother Brown
[1:15:27] said what did he tell Adam and Eve
[1:15:30] he said go on
[1:15:32] and multiply
[1:15:34] and replenish the Earth he scattered the
[1:15:36] human race all over the Earth so he
[1:15:38] could deal with them individually
[1:15:41] until he could bring them back together
[1:15:43] so the purpose of scattering is so that
[1:15:46] God might come individually to every
[1:15:49] life to every heart and then when God
[1:15:52] comes individually to a life then the
[1:15:54] work he does there it draws us into the
[1:15:58] body of Jesus Christ so it's not us
[1:16:01] making ourselves a part of something
[1:16:04] it's not us trying to do that listen to
[1:16:07] me now I believe there's a start in a
[1:16:10] life it might start with simply you know
[1:16:12] keeping the scissors off your hair it
[1:16:14] might start with the men stop acting
[1:16:15] like sissies and you know everything it
[1:16:18] can start there has to be a start
[1:16:19] somewhere
[1:16:20] but what I'm saying is this don't rely
[1:16:24] upon that do that because of Grace that
[1:16:28] has come to you that you realize the
[1:16:31] word of God teaches better than that
[1:16:35] are you with me it's not well this is
[1:16:37] what my church teaches no it's what the
[1:16:40] Bible says
[1:16:43] it's not the church that is said let the
[1:16:45] woman dress in all modesty it's the
[1:16:48] scripture that said that
[1:16:51] and the word modest in the scripture
[1:16:53] first Timothy means free flowing garment
[1:17:00] in other words anything that takes out
[1:17:02] all the mystery is an abomination
[1:17:05] well I don't wear pants but if you wear
[1:17:07] dresses that take out all the mystery
[1:17:09] it's still an abomination
[1:17:15] and you listen I almost got to preach on
[1:17:17] men anymore you know unless you see
[1:17:19] these skinny britches they wearing
[1:17:20] everything else
[1:17:22] come on listen we are not to pattern
[1:17:24] after the world
[1:17:26] [Music]
[1:17:27] if you pattern after world Listen where
[1:17:30] is the source of inspiration that has
[1:17:33] come everything that we do should be
[1:17:35] decently orderly and Holiness unto the
[1:17:38] Lord
[1:17:43] mama
[1:17:47] he separated so he could deal with this
[1:17:50] individual deal with us individually now
[1:17:52] in paragraph 110 brother Graham said God
[1:17:54] don't deal with the person in a group
[1:17:56] right
[1:17:57] right you know that's why sometimes that
[1:17:59] God's got allow disturbances to come so
[1:18:01] the family's not walking just as a
[1:18:04] family upon a family religion
[1:18:08] well I come to church here because my
[1:18:10] family come no God wants to meet you
[1:18:12] individually
[1:18:13] because you're not saved because your
[1:18:16] family comes here
[1:18:18] you're only saved when you know Jesus
[1:18:21] Christ passionately
[1:18:24] is that right
[1:18:26] it doesn't matter how long somebody said
[1:18:28] around the message they could sit around
[1:18:29] the message for 50 years and never have
[1:18:32] met Jesus Christ
[1:18:35] amen he's a reality it's more than a
[1:18:38] church life
[1:18:42] oh friends
[1:18:43] God's not against us he's for us
[1:18:48] how miserable it is to live beneath the
[1:18:50] Privileges now God don't deal with the
[1:18:53] person in a group he don't deal with you
[1:18:54] in an organization he deals with you and
[1:18:56] as an individual sometimes God has to
[1:18:58] get uh separated
[1:19:00] not just sometimes he does sometimes you
[1:19:03] wonder and say well you know it's like
[1:19:06] how God begins to deal with our lives
[1:19:08] and what's he doing is a separation
[1:19:10] that's going on then he might make
[1:19:12] himself known more when God brought a
[1:19:14] separation with Abraham first of all he
[1:19:17] got out of the land
[1:19:19] where he was
[1:19:21] not fully but it got closer right then
[1:19:25] he came in the land and God showed him
[1:19:27] what he had been talking about
[1:19:28] but he still had a lot with him but it
[1:19:31] wasn't until God finally moved by grace
[1:19:35] that Abraham recognized there's got to
[1:19:37] be a separation here what God called for
[1:19:40] all along
[1:19:41] but now he's separated then God made
[1:19:43] himself known to Abraham in a greater
[1:19:46] way
[1:19:47] remember what Jesus said
[1:19:50] and he said in his word
[1:19:52] now let me just let me finish this here
[1:19:54] he says he deals with you as an
[1:19:55] individual individually we are baptized
[1:19:58] with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:00] collectively we are baptized into the
[1:20:03] body when we are baptized with the Holy
[1:20:06] Ghost individually each one baptized
[1:20:08] with the Holy Ghost God dealing with
[1:20:10] each one that was his purpose when he
[1:20:13] scattered them across the Earth so he
[1:20:15] could deal with them individually and
[1:20:18] that's where when Jesus could say that I
[1:20:20] have not come to bring peace on Earth
[1:20:25] I come to bring a sword
[1:20:28] and the sword is the word it is the
[1:20:31] Living Word of God
[1:20:34] that moves down and it deals with our
[1:20:37] life and it is that word if we can
[1:20:39] receive it oh it's tough when God calls
[1:20:43] for separation it's not something that's
[1:20:45] just oh that's easy it's it's tough
[1:20:47] there's a wrestling but think about it
[1:20:49] it's life we are being called from death
[1:20:53] into life
[1:20:56] the sword has come to cut away
[1:20:58] everything from our lives but if we walk
[1:21:01] away from what the word is saying then
[1:21:04] we are declaring and saying Lord this is
[1:21:07] too much I I can't separate from all
[1:21:09] this I'm not able to do it but if you'll
[1:21:12] just yield to him you know your yielding
[1:21:14] is a separation and it allows the sword
[1:21:19] of the Lord to go to work in your life
[1:21:22] and cut everything away
[1:21:29] that's what that's what my desire that
[1:21:31] word that word is still cutting there's
[1:21:34] still a separation that's going on
[1:21:37] so it's an individual work that goes on
[1:21:41] in our life and it must be that it must
[1:21:44] be nothing less than Christ in us the
[1:21:48] hope of glory this is what Paul would
[1:21:50] say in Colossians 1 27 to whom God would
[1:21:54] make known what is the riches of the
[1:21:57] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:22:00] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:22:05] whom we preach warning every man
[1:22:07] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:22:10] may present every man perfect in Christ
[1:22:15] Jesus that's why the Gospel of Jesus
[1:22:19] Christ The Living Word is sent to be
[1:22:21] preached it is the good news
[1:22:25] it is the Declaration as it's recorded
[1:22:28] in the book of Isaiah how beautiful are
[1:22:31] the feet of them who bring Tidings Glad
[1:22:34] Tidings of peace and one of those glad
[1:22:36] patings of Peace our god reigns but no
[1:22:41] matter what it is that you're setting in
[1:22:44] your life let me announce to you this
[1:22:46] morning our god reigns he's greater than
[1:22:49] that in your life he's greater than that
[1:22:52] sin he's greater than that way he's
[1:22:55] greater our god reigns
[1:22:58] [Applause]
[1:23:00] Hallelujah and that call it moves it
[1:23:04] draws upon our heart let me tell you
[1:23:06] something
[1:23:07] you are a blessed people
[1:23:09] to fill the pool the call and to yield
[1:23:13] to his voice
[1:23:18] so there's nothing else that God accepts
[1:23:20] outside of Christ and you remember
[1:23:23] down in Egypt
[1:23:25] they had to take the lamb slay it and
[1:23:28] they had to put the blood
[1:23:30] is that right
[1:23:31] without the blood it didn't matter how
[1:23:34] how much Israel like they were
[1:23:37] when the death angel came by
[1:23:39] it only recognized the blood
[1:23:43] and the blood was a sign
[1:23:46] death has already come to this home
[1:23:50] there's been one that has died in the
[1:23:53] stead of another
[1:23:57] oh Hallelujah that's what the sign the
[1:24:02] token sign the Seal of the Holy Ghost in
[1:24:05] our life it shows there is one who has
[1:24:08] died from me there is one who has come
[1:24:11] from me and I am his subject redeemed
[1:24:15] saved although the howling Winds of
[1:24:19] Darkness are all around but I am saved
[1:24:22] in God's Pavilion in the time of trouble
[1:24:27] he shall hide me in his Pavilion He
[1:24:33] Shall Set me upon a rock now shall mine
[1:24:37] head be lifted out above my enemies and
[1:24:42] I will sing the Praises and sacrifices
[1:24:46] of Joy why because he has done this
[1:24:53] for me
[1:25:01] Hallelujah
[1:25:02] Glory
[1:25:04] it's God's own life
[1:25:06] personally coming
[1:25:08] and moving and vindicating in our lives
[1:25:10] moving it's God vindicating his word
[1:25:13] it's not that's why it's not just it's
[1:25:17] not just the Holy Spirit around our life
[1:25:20] the Holy Spirit comes remember the Sun
[1:25:22] the rain what does the Sun and rain come
[1:25:24] to do it doesn't come for the weeds do
[1:25:26] the weeds benefit from it yes the weeds
[1:25:29] grow just like the wheat but the sun and
[1:25:31] the rain has come to bring what
[1:25:33] quickening and life to the seed that was
[1:25:36] there

[1:26:09] the bread that was in the mind of God
[1:26:12] from the foundation of the world
[1:26:16] and he was broken apart he was separated
[1:26:21] from God he died as a sinner

[1:27:25] Vindication of the great revelation of
[1:27:27] God look only in an individual never in
[1:27:31] a group an individual not in a group his
[1:27:35] identification is with an individual he

[1:28:14] see the economical Council of churches
[1:28:18] oh we're just all one they don't agree
[1:28:21] on nothing
[1:28:23] the only thing that there's an agreement
[1:28:24] amongst them is the three chord of that
[1:28:28] water baptism in the name
[1:28:31] a father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:28:35] which is the same name that the witches
[1:28:37] call out
[1:28:39] come on you know I'm preaching the truth
[1:28:42] because listen he is not he is he
[1:28:45] manifests his titles but it is the same
[1:28:48] almighty God that has become flesh there
[1:28:51] is one Lord one faith
[1:28:54] [Applause]
[1:28:56] everybody if you know like brother
[1:28:58] Branham says if they would this let
[1:28:59] their mind loose a little bit to think
[1:29:02] God ain't a schizophrenic
[1:29:05] oh yeah yeah well you know we believe
[1:29:07] it's one God and three persons what
[1:29:11] it's one God
[1:29:13] manifesting himself in three offices
[1:29:18] I'm the son of James and Pat Browning
[1:29:21] when I go up and hang and hug my mama I
[1:29:23] don't say hey honey hi sweetheart no
[1:29:26] that's in the office of husband to my
[1:29:28] wife
[1:29:30] but when I go to my boys I don't go over
[1:29:32] to them and say hey Honey Sweetie Pie
[1:29:35] I go over them and say hey buddy all of
[1:29:38] my buddy
[1:29:39] hey buddy
[1:29:40] but you know what that's a different
[1:29:42] office am I a different person no I'm
[1:29:46] the same person all the time
[1:29:49] I'm just being revealed or revealing in
[1:29:52] the offices that were already in me
[1:29:56] yeah
[1:29:58] Hallelujah
[1:30:00] now notice this individuality it's a
[1:30:03] scripture notice it must be an
[1:30:06] individual walk I'll take one and leave
[1:30:09] one
[1:30:10] I'll separate them remember Luke 20 Luke
[1:30:13] 17 and Matthew and and Matthew there
[1:30:16] there'll be two in the field talking
[1:30:17] about the Rapture there'll be two in the
[1:30:19] field I'll take one and leave one
[1:30:21] there'll be two in bed I'll take one and
[1:30:23] leave one
[1:30:24] hello somebody
[1:30:26] so it's not a group catching away
[1:30:29] it's individuals that have been caught
[1:30:33] away already
[1:30:35] have already been joined to Jesus Christ
[1:30:38] in a real relationship and that's what
[1:30:41] he's coming after
[1:30:43] it's not about my location it's not
[1:30:46] about who I'm associated with it's about
[1:30:48] who are you United with
[1:30:53] is he the Lord of your life
[1:30:56] it's not a group it's a personal
[1:30:58] Vindication of a pregnant child of God
[1:31:02] filled with the Holy Ghost so
[1:31:05] surrendered to God that he don't care
[1:31:07] about anything else you say a pregnated
[1:31:09] child of God yeah
[1:31:11] because the Holy Spirit just don't fall
[1:31:13] upon upon upon the children of God and
[1:31:16] just leaves but the Holy Spirit comes it
[1:31:19] is God's own life that's coming to the
[1:31:22] betting ground
[1:31:23] and let me tell you the betting ground
[1:31:26] we didn't Supply it
[1:31:28] because if we supplied it we would have
[1:31:30] something to say about our Resurrection
[1:31:33] but God has supplied the seed God
[1:31:36] supplied the bed and grain remember
[1:31:37] there the Bible talks about a sorrow
[1:31:39] went forth to sow and there was four
[1:31:41] types of ground but there was some good
[1:31:43] ground and the prophet in this hour
[1:31:46] identified the good ground as the
[1:31:49] pre-prepared ground that was prepared by
[1:31:52] God that it's not you and I recognizing
[1:31:55] God but it is that part on the inside of
[1:31:58] us and I hope you understand what I'm
[1:32:00] saying when it's not you and I it's not
[1:32:02] the outer man that's recognizing God
[1:32:05] it's the inner man that's being awakened
[1:32:08] by the presence of almighty God
[1:32:16] and the Holy Spirit living its life
[1:32:18] because when a life is pregnated what do
[1:32:21] you have to do when that life has been
[1:32:23] pregnated you cater to the life that's
[1:32:25] on the inside
[1:32:27] right that's why the Doritos with
[1:32:29] chocolate milk and the pickles and the
[1:32:31] honey go get me some you know Ritz
[1:32:33] crackers with this on them and you know
[1:32:35] go do this and go do that and you know I
[1:32:38] want this kind of ask him all right I
[1:32:39] want this you know I got a taste for
[1:32:41] this I got what are you doing you're
[1:32:43] catering to the life that's on the
[1:32:45] inside
[1:32:46] all right
[1:32:47] you might check brother Samuel we know
[1:32:49] our kids we don't have kids we're all
[1:32:50] growing out of the house and I still got
[1:32:51] to do that yeah you're right about that
[1:32:53] one
[1:32:55] but there's a life that's on the inside
[1:32:58] and what you're doing is there's a that
[1:33:01] life is what's calling for certain
[1:33:03] nutrients
[1:33:05] do you realize that it's you you in your
[1:33:09] life that which is in you that is
[1:33:11] actually calling out to God and God
[1:33:14] directing the officers in the body of
[1:33:17] Jesus Christ to minister the nutrients
[1:33:21] that you and I have need of it's not us
[1:33:24] going after nutrients it's God that's
[1:33:27] supplying the manna that we have need of
[1:33:33] that's why we're not just coming to
[1:33:35] church and we just roll into church and
[1:33:37] praise God I made it to church we're
[1:33:40] coming here I have a need from you Lord
[1:33:43] daily give me this day my daily bread
[1:33:46] Lord
[1:33:49] you Lord God
[1:33:52] and the Holy Spirit with its life
[1:33:54] pulsating through US showing
[1:33:57] itself and the people to the world
[1:34:01] and let me just try to bring this down
[1:34:03] here
[1:34:05] not going to get to where we
[1:34:07] looking at but I'll get to a place a
[1:34:08] good stopping point here
[1:34:10] here Paul deals with Ephesians 3 and 8.
[1:34:14] and now here has this assembling of this
[1:34:18] body together of this bride together
[1:34:22] remember
[1:34:24] all came out
[1:34:25] of Egypt
[1:34:27] many came out of Egypt
[1:34:29] but there was also a mixed multitude
[1:34:31] that came up
[1:34:33] right
[1:34:35] and remember God would have wiped
[1:34:37] everything out
[1:34:40] but there was elect in there
[1:34:43] and the life
[1:34:45] of the promise God's own life that was
[1:34:47] in Moses
[1:34:49] called out for the people
[1:34:54] who was that that was God
[1:34:57] it shows that the Word of Promise in our
[1:35:00] lives is in a toner
[1:35:04] are you with me it atones it covereth
[1:35:07] the multitude
[1:35:09] are you hearing me now this is the Life
[1:35:11] of Christ working in the body for what
[1:35:13] for the greater for for the body for for
[1:35:17] the cause for the purpose if God would
[1:35:19] have wiped them all out remember what
[1:35:21] Moses told him who was it how could a
[1:35:23] man have have a greater idea than God it
[1:35:26] couldn't be it wasn't Moses had a better
[1:35:28] idea than God it was God in Moses Christ
[1:35:32] in Moses expressing back the promise of
[1:35:34] the word because he's not a man that he
[1:35:36] should lie
[1:35:38] God God don't have to repent are you
[1:35:41] with me all his words are true in amen
[1:35:44] and here God said it you don't bring
[1:35:46] them in then the rest of them are going
[1:35:48] to say you brought them out but you
[1:35:50] weren't able to take them in
[1:35:51] you weren't able to keep your word
[1:35:55] is that right what happened God can't
[1:35:57] cross his own word
[1:36:00] you got a need that's why you put the
[1:36:02] word right there before God lord
[1:36:05] there's a need right here in my life put
[1:36:07] the word before him
[1:36:09] he'll come down and honor his word young
[1:36:11] person put the word before him Lord this
[1:36:14] is a promise you made to me
[1:36:17] I didn't ask you if you felt worthy I'm
[1:36:20] asking you does the word mean something
[1:36:22] to you and if the word means something
[1:36:25] to you say Lord this is a promise you
[1:36:28] made to me and there's a craving for
[1:36:31] this promise
[1:36:33] in my life
[1:36:37] now God's spared now there were those
[1:36:40] who were in the initial instigating of
[1:36:43] it and they were removed right you see
[1:36:46] that each time
[1:36:48] but then here you still have the mixed
[1:36:49] multitude but there was a Joshua and a
[1:36:51] Caleb the whole time
[1:36:53] I'm asking you
[1:36:55] what was it was it a group that took the
[1:36:57] land
[1:36:58] it was individuals
[1:37:01] individuals had to decide
[1:37:03] that they wanted that they this is what
[1:37:06] did Caleb say Caleb kindly came to a
[1:37:08] place when he got over there he said hey
[1:37:10] all the rest of this inheritance been
[1:37:13] divided out isn't it amazing that calebs
[1:37:15] was not given first
[1:37:17] you know why because it's speaking of
[1:37:19] you and I
[1:37:22] in this hour give me my mountain
[1:37:25] Faith patience virtue give me my
[1:37:28] mountain
[1:37:29] give me my Mountain where the streams of
[1:37:32] Grace flow down to the bottom give me my
[1:37:35] Mountain the mountain that the word
[1:37:37] promise a full stature of Jesus Christ
[1:37:40] give me my mountain
[1:37:43] why because the bride coming into a full
[1:37:46] completion reflects that City
[1:37:51] oh glory be to God
[1:37:55] Hallelujah this is why Paul
[1:37:58] could write
[1:38:00] and he could say
[1:38:03] verse 9 of Ephesians 3. to make all men
[1:38:07] see what is the fellowship of this
[1:38:09] mystery well brother Brandon stops right
[1:38:12] there and he says will all men see it no
[1:38:15] no no
[1:38:16] to make all men see
[1:38:19] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:38:21] which from the beginning of the world
[1:38:23] hath been hid in God who created All
[1:38:27] Things by Jesus Christ
[1:38:31] to the intent that now unto the
[1:38:33] principalities and powers in Heavenly
[1:38:35] places might be known by the church
[1:38:39] the manifold wisdom
[1:38:42] of God
[1:38:44] I love that
[1:38:46] I love that
[1:38:48] what is the Church of the Living God
[1:38:50] it's the manaphone
[1:38:52] the variegated the variety
[1:38:56] the manifold wisdom of God
[1:39:00] what is the wisdom of God
[1:39:02] it's his life
[1:39:05] it's a revelation of himself
[1:39:08] see God
[1:39:10] when this manifold wisdom here we are
[1:39:13] from all different walks of life
[1:39:15] remember for by one Spirit are we
[1:39:18] baptized into one body
[1:39:21] by one Spirit have we all been made to
[1:39:25] drink
[1:39:26] do all kinds of different nationalities
[1:39:29] different backgrounds dear all all of
[1:39:32] our temperaments our makeups some people
[1:39:35] like things quiet some things like noisy
[1:39:37] some it all different things
[1:39:41] but it comes down to when a life has
[1:39:45] been joined in a union with God
[1:39:48] then through that it is part of the body
[1:39:52] of Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] then it is that of the manifold of the
[1:39:57] wisdom of God it's God reflecting his
[1:40:00] life
[1:40:01] through a many membered body
[1:40:04] you realize a real diamond when they'd
[1:40:07] known to know what a real diamond is
[1:40:09] they look to the heart of it and if
[1:40:12] there's that fire that's there on the
[1:40:13] inside it's it's really a certain color
[1:40:15] of a matter that's there on the inside
[1:40:17] but what comes out of that that real
[1:40:20] diamond it reflects into many different
[1:40:23] colors
[1:40:26] and that's how God is
[1:40:28] in his body
[1:40:31] not a fragmented people
[1:40:34] not a divided people
[1:40:37] but a people that are one not by a
[1:40:39] church not by being Under One Roof
[1:40:42] not by just associating with the same
[1:40:45] Pastor or we believe the problem we
[1:40:48] believe God sent a prophet or it's it's
[1:40:50] something that's personal
[1:40:51] to you we may have come with our parents
[1:40:55] we may have been around it for a period
[1:40:58] of time but it had to come a time when
[1:41:00] it becomes personal to you
[1:41:04] to where that you meet Jesus Christ in a
[1:41:07] person where there's a a moving within
[1:41:10] your heart then it becomes Christ
[1:41:13] in your life
[1:41:17] and this is why brother Brahma says and
[1:41:19] I close here he says it's Christ and
[1:41:21] Christ the mystery it's Christ
[1:41:22] expressing himself
[1:41:25] in the individual whether he's
[1:41:27] intellectual or whether he don't even
[1:41:29] know his ABCs
[1:41:32] what matters is that it's Christ in you
[1:41:37] doesn't matter if you sweet you and I
[1:41:39] see everything alike that's not what
[1:41:41] matters what matters is
[1:41:44] Christ in US
[1:41:46] that's what's important are you hearing
[1:41:48] me Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:41:51] are you with me
[1:41:53] that's what matters
[1:41:55] is that we've been born again of the
[1:41:57] spirit of God that brings us there into
[1:42:00] one bread one body
[1:42:03] we've got one purpose then we've got one
[1:42:05] heart we've got one mind there's one
[1:42:08] desire
[1:42:09] I want to see him glorified
[1:42:12] I want to seem glorified in my life I
[1:42:15] want to seem glorified in your life I
[1:42:17] want to seem glorified in the life of
[1:42:20] his body
[1:42:21] oh the testimonies we hear and you hear
[1:42:24] this so the Lord did this to me or the
[1:42:26] Lord did this for me or the Lord moved
[1:42:28] here oh praise God God God Drew This
[1:42:32] Heart praise God it's God working
[1:42:36] in his body
[1:42:39] oh my
[1:42:40] I say glory be to God
[1:42:44] this right here
[1:42:46] paragraph 240 Brianna the new birth is
[1:42:49] Christ a revelation
[1:42:52] that's what it is
[1:42:54] it's a revelation
[1:42:57] God has revealed to you this great
[1:42:59] mystery and that's a new birth not
[1:43:01] listen friends not just the message is
[1:43:04] the truth
[1:43:06] you've got to know what's truth and give
[1:43:08] yourself
[1:43:10] to it
[1:43:12] remember what we've been looking at on
[1:43:14] principles of Deliverance
[1:43:15] sell all thou the rest of the pearls for
[1:43:18] the pearl of great price
[1:43:21] you're willing to let go of everything
[1:43:24] else
[1:43:25] because we have found him
[1:43:29] hallelujah oh my
[1:43:32] right now what are you going to do I
[1:43:35] love this what are you going to do when
[1:43:37] you get all that group together
[1:43:39] I love this where the revelation
[1:43:43] is perfectly in harmony
[1:43:46] I really would like to start preaching
[1:43:48] here but I can't
[1:43:50] notice where the Revelation is perfectly
[1:43:55] in harmony
[1:43:58] when we
[1:43:59] when the Revelation is perfectly in
[1:44:02] Harmony in US
[1:44:04] and we giving ourselves to
[1:44:07] him in us than what he's able to do
[1:44:12] exceedingly abundantly
[1:44:14] where brother Samuel my opinions but
[1:44:16] when we see and allow the Revelation to
[1:44:20] work perfectly we begin to realize my
[1:44:23] opinions
[1:44:25] can either hinder or I can let them be
[1:44:28] put behind me
[1:44:30] for what reason for the body of Jesus
[1:44:33] Christ
[1:44:34] because it's about the body it's the
[1:44:36] body it's about the body
[1:44:39] I'm a part of that body you're part of
[1:44:42] that body part of that bread one bread
[1:44:45] one body
[1:44:46] he was broken
[1:44:49] that we might be United
[1:44:52] he was separated
[1:44:54] that we could be joined together
[1:44:57] not by our intellects because even if
[1:45:00] you and I sat down enough long enough
[1:45:02] we'll we'll probably see things that we
[1:45:04] will see we may disagree a little bit on
[1:45:07] something but there's something greater
[1:45:09] than our intellects
[1:45:11] right here the Bible never said in Acts
[1:45:14] 4 that they were joined together in
[1:45:16] their heads it said they were of one
[1:45:18] mind
[1:45:19] and one heart and the Bible said one
[1:45:22] soul
[1:45:24] it was God moving in his church
[1:45:29] and everything that was done was for the
[1:45:33] benefit of the body
[1:45:36] to me oh I know there's a song we don't
[1:45:38] sing in here but probably some of you
[1:45:39] heard it oh the beautiful body of Jesus
[1:45:43] Christ
[1:45:44] rising from Death unto life
[1:45:48] Oh what a beautiful body the body of
[1:45:52] Jesus Christ that which he has shed his
[1:45:55] blood and redeemed he has drawn us to
[1:45:57] himself he has cleansed Our Lives
[1:46:01] and imparted his life to us
[1:46:04] that's why
[1:46:05] he means so much to you
[1:46:09] are you hearing me that's why he means
[1:46:11] so much to you you want to know where
[1:46:14] you stand what's your desire in your
[1:46:16] heart
[1:46:17] what's your desire in your heart you say
[1:46:19] my desire David said one thing have I
[1:46:23] desired
[1:46:26] and that's the only thing I do hear
[1:46:28] everything else every decision is based
[1:46:31] on will it help that desire or will it
[1:46:34] hinder it one thing have I desired and
[1:46:37] that will I seek after that I may dwell
[1:46:41] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[1:46:46] my life
[1:46:47] Hallelujah
[1:46:49] he is my desire he is my life
[1:46:54] if my mind or my my thoughts are
[1:46:57] anything it gets sidetracked there is
[1:46:59] Grace that comes to us and he ministers
[1:47:02] to our heart and says hey hey that which
[1:47:04] you feel is a little bit out of Step a
[1:47:06] little bit of missing there in your life
[1:47:08] what is it it's me come walk with me
[1:47:14] Heavenly Father
[1:47:17] Lord
[1:47:19] here we
[1:47:21] stand this morning
[1:47:24] one bread
[1:47:26] one body
[1:47:29] Lord we
[1:47:31] as you've made it so clear so real to us
[1:47:33] Lord right here in these moments
[1:47:36] it's not because the Lord that we
[1:47:39] are acquainted
[1:47:41] with this message
[1:47:44] it's not because we come here to church
[1:47:46] it's not because of the family
[1:47:49] that we are in
[1:47:51] but God
[1:47:53] it's because we have become
[1:47:56] a part of you
[1:47:58] and Lord I pray
[1:48:00] I know you come Lord and
[1:48:03] you make things so simple
[1:48:05] for us
[1:48:07] your desire is that there would be a
[1:48:09] relationship
[1:48:12] and Lord that relationship in our life
[1:48:15] god with the indwelling
[1:48:17] of your own presence Lord
[1:48:20] and Father Here We Stand Lord
[1:48:24] as Paul would describe the church
[1:48:27] the manifold wisdom of God
[1:48:32] Lord
[1:48:33] we're all in our own
[1:48:36] makeup our temperaments
[1:48:39] our Lord and nationalities on and on we
[1:48:42] could go with different families
[1:48:44] there's so many differences in that John
[1:48:48] Saul a bride of many kindreds nations
[1:48:52] and tongues but what he saw was the
[1:48:55] bride
[1:48:57] she had on as Lord Brother Branham would
[1:49:00] describe it the Garb that of the
[1:49:02] clothing that would signify that of that
[1:49:04] of that nation that she's come out of
[1:49:06] Lord
[1:49:08] Kindred in tongue but it is the bride it
[1:49:10] is you
[1:49:11] that God has sent
[1:49:14] your word
[1:49:15] like you sent letters through all the
[1:49:18] provinces there
[1:49:20] together Lord all of those virgin women
[1:49:23] into the palace Lord to shushan Lord and
[1:49:26] Esther came in there many came
[1:49:29] but God it was Esther
[1:49:32] that in the moment of that time she
[1:49:34] submitted herself
[1:49:36] to the king's Chamberlain
[1:49:39] whatsoever he said regarding her life
[1:49:42] she had a choice
[1:49:44] what she wanted to wear to go before the
[1:49:46] king
[1:49:47] but she deferred her choice
[1:49:51] and she took the council
[1:49:53] of the king's Chamberlain
[1:49:56] Lord
[1:49:57] we defer our choice
[1:50:00] to the Holy Spirit
[1:50:02] you know
[1:50:04] you know just what we have need of
[1:50:07] It's You Lord that's dressing the bride
[1:50:11] and getting this bride ready it's you
[1:50:13] Lord
[1:50:14] it's not us taking our own
[1:50:17] ways our own ideas
[1:50:19] but it's you working in a very personal
[1:50:21] way
[1:50:23] Lord you said in your word
[1:50:25] that no man can come to me
[1:50:28] except it be given to him
[1:50:30] and I will draw him
[1:50:32] Lord I pray this morning
[1:50:35] Lord with that drawing power of the Holy
[1:50:39] Spirit
[1:50:40] May the lives and hearts Lord this
[1:50:42] morning if there's one that fills that
[1:50:44] drawing and says Lord I want to go
[1:50:47] deeper Lord
[1:50:48] I want Lord I Want More Of You Lord just
[1:50:51] in every area and every part of my life
[1:50:54] I want to go deeper Lord father even
[1:50:58] through this congregation this morning
[1:51:00] Lord
[1:51:02] there's a desire
[1:51:04] that moves within the heart of the
[1:51:06] believer
[1:51:08] I want to go deeper Lord
[1:51:12] I pray that you would just just give us
[1:51:16] the grace
[1:51:18] that Lord that revelation
[1:51:20] to work perfectly in harmony
[1:51:25] it's a continual dying to ourselves Lord
[1:51:29] it's an individual walk
[1:51:32] and we're part of a body as well
[1:51:35] Lord when they took the land when they
[1:51:37] crossed over
[1:51:39] they defeated Jericho as a unit
[1:51:43] and when they lost in AI they
[1:51:47] they failed in that battle all of Israel
[1:51:51] failed
[1:51:52] but it was because of one individual
[1:51:54] that let down
[1:51:57] but God you came and you dealt and you
[1:52:01] moved
[1:52:02] in a very special way because your word
[1:52:05] will not return to your Void
[1:52:07] may we Lord take it as the prophet
[1:52:09] placed it so clearly to us that our walk
[1:52:12] with you not only Lord God is
[1:52:15] individually but also recognizing the
[1:52:18] body that we are a part of
[1:52:21] help us Lord I pray God as one bread one
[1:52:26] body Lord
[1:52:27] that manifold wisdom of God on display
[1:52:30] in our lives granted Lord I pray May Our
[1:52:34] Lives be lived to the glory of almighty
[1:52:38] God
[1:52:39] granted Lord

[1:52:50] liberty Lord

[2:04:26] How Sweet It Is water
[2:04:28] what a mighty God we serve
[2:04:31] a God who comes so personal
[2:04:34] speaks so personal to our hearts deals
[2:04:38] with our lives
[2:04:40] even how the sword comes that I think
[2:04:43] our brother Brandon would pray in that
[2:04:44] message Shalom he said oh God may we
[2:04:48] continue to worship you as the sword of
[2:04:52] the Lord passes through US Lord
[2:04:56] Cuts away anything Lord that's unlike
[2:04:59] you
[2:05:01] Oh my he cuts away anything that he
[2:05:04] deals with in our life it's what he's
[2:05:06] actually removing
[2:05:08] he's removing that
[2:05:11] which is not in His image
[2:05:13] when Michelangelo worked on that great
[2:05:15] sculpture he took a great piece of stone
[2:05:18] of marble
[2:05:20] and he began to work on it
[2:05:22] the pieces that fell off never became
[2:05:25] the focus never became what was in the
[2:05:28] Showcase people do not travel to see the
[2:05:32] pieces that got chipped off
[2:05:34] but what people travel to Sea
[2:05:38] is what came out of that
[2:05:41] it's not the pieces that he takes off of
[2:05:43] your life but he's taken the pieces off
[2:05:45] your life in order to reveal
[2:05:48] who you really are
[2:05:51] so every piece and everything he deals
[2:05:53] with your life what I do Let It Go
[2:05:55] because that peace is not the image that
[2:05:58] he's trying to bring forth in your life
[2:05:59] just let the sword of the word move
[2:06:02] through you and say Lord let me just
[2:06:05] reflect that image that you had in your
[2:06:07] mind
[2:06:08] maybe it's in that stage in your life
[2:06:10] right now where you're not feeling a lot
[2:06:11] of chunks coming off but maybe you're
[2:06:14] not in a chunk moving stage maybe you're
[2:06:16] in a stage where it's a
[2:06:18] it's polishing
[2:06:20] but no matter
[2:06:21] Where You Are
[2:06:23] he's working on you
[2:06:25] he's working on me
[2:06:27] and the greatest desire is Lord work on
[2:06:30] Me Lord
