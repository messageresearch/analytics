[34:13] service in Jesus Christ's name
[34:16] amen hallelujah amen uh I'd like to turn
[34:21] if you would to Galatians chapter 1 and
[34:25] we're just going to read the chapter
[34:26] here I I was telling brother Samuel I
[34:30] actually earlier today was looking over
[34:32] things and had studied was putting
[34:34] together some notes and then as the day
[34:37] went on I just wasn't feeling it and uh
[34:40] so I got here and went
[34:43] back and that and so we uh the Lord just
[34:47] directed me to something else and that
[34:50] so uh I want to preach here from the
[34:54] Galatians 1 we'll just maybe take it
[34:57] like a little ible study tonight and
[34:59] what I'd like to title it is not of men
[35:03] neither by man praise God not of men
[35:06] neither by
[35:08] men all right so here Galatians 1 the
[35:11] first
[35:12] chapter Paul uh writes Paul an apostle
[35:17] not of men neither by men but by Jesus
[35:21] Christ and God the Father who raised him
[35:24] from the dead and all the brethren which
[35:27] are with me unto the churches of galatia
[35:31] Grace be to you and peace from God the
[35:34] father and from our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:36] who gave himself for our sins that he
[35:39] might Deliver Us from this present evil
[35:41] world according to the will of God and
[35:43] our father to whom be glory forever and
[35:46] ever amen I Marvel that you are so soon
[35:50] removed from him that called you into
[35:53] the grace of Christ unto another gospel
[35:56] which is not another but there is some
[35:59] that trouble you and would pervert the
[36:01] go uh the gospel of Christ but though we
[36:05] are an angel from heaven preach any
[36:07] other gospel unto you than that which we
[36:09] have preached unto you let him be ACC
[36:12] cursed as we said before so say I now
[36:16] again if any man preach any other gospel
[36:19] unto you than that ye have reive let him
[36:22] be
[36:23] accursed for do I now persuade men or
[36:27] God or do I seek to please men for if I
[36:30] please men I should not be the Ser
[36:33] servant of Christ but I certify you
[36:36] Brethren that the gospel which was
[36:39] preached of me is not after man for
[36:42] neither received it uh for I neither
[36:45] received it of man neither was I taught
[36:48] it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ
[36:52] glory for ye have heard of my
[36:54] conversation in time past in the Jews
[36:57] religion
[36:58] how that beyond measure I persecuted the
[37:02] Church of God and wasted it and profited
[37:04] in the Jewish religion above many my
[37:08] equal in my own Nation being more
[37:10] exceedingly zealous of the traditions of
[37:13] my fathers but when it pleased God who
[37:16] separated me from my mother's womb and
[37:18] called me by his grace to reveal his son
[37:21] in me that I might preach him among the
[37:24] Heathen immediately I conferred not with
[37:28] flesh and blood neither went I up to
[37:30] Jerusalem to them that were Apostles
[37:33] before me but I went into Arabia and
[37:37] returned again into Damascus and then
[37:39] after three years I went up to Jerusalem
[37:42] to see Peter and ab Bo with him 15 days
[37:45] but other the apostles saw Li none save
[37:47] James the Lord's brother now the things
[37:50] which I write un you behold before God I
[37:53] lie not afterwards I came into the
[37:56] regions of Syria in Sicilia and was
[38:00] Unknown by faith unto the churches of
[38:04] Judea which were in Christ but they had
[38:07] heard only that he which had persecuted
[38:09] Us in times past now preacheth the faith
[38:13] which was once he destroyed and they
[38:15] glorified God in Me amen you may be
[38:18] seated
[38:21] Hallelujah I
[38:24] uh you know I'm not coming you to
[38:27] tonight to bring to you some uh
[38:31] something perhaps you haven't heard or
[38:34] uh some profound Revelation that you
[38:38] don't already
[38:42] have but I I look at
[38:45] the the time that we're living in and I
[38:50] I look at the uh the things that are
[38:52] going on not so much you know of course
[38:56] we look at things that's going going on
[38:57] in the world and and the the sin that
[39:00] seems to be increasing and the cup of
[39:03] iniquity is getting close to being full
[39:06] in this in this uh time and and so we
[39:09] know that it we're close to the end
[39:12] we're close to the coming of the Lord
[39:14] but more than that you those things they
[39:17] don't really affect us the Believers of
[39:20] this end time truth but one of the other
[39:24] things that we can see that uh you know
[39:28] of course the the the religions of the
[39:31] world the denominations and that
[39:33] wouldn't be able to see these things
[39:35] because they you know they they don't
[39:38] have the
[39:39] truth what they have is by men it did it
[39:44] is
[39:46] man-made uh you know they could they
[39:48] read the same Bible that we read but
[39:51] they they though uh their Doctrine from
[39:55] those things has all been created by
[39:59] man and and and when you think about it
[40:02] and look at it especially over time
[40:04] their doctr on a lot of things has
[40:06] changed in a lot of the denominational
[40:09] churches especially in those that at one
[40:12] time were called the Holiness churches
[40:15] their doctrines and views on a lot of
[40:17] things has changed their view on
[40:20] Holiness uh uh dressing and and and
[40:24] different things like that they've
[40:25] changed you know and uh and the reason
[40:29] they did is because the people want
[40:33] preachers to tell them what they want to
[40:35] hear they want to be able to live
[40:37] whatever life they want to live and
[40:39] still feel like that they're okay and
[40:42] Justified and so you know as the
[40:44] scripture said it would it would happen
[40:46] in these last days where they would Heap
[40:48] to themselves teachers having itching
[40:50] ears in other words people preachers
[40:53] that was going to tell them what they
[40:55] wanted to hear you can cut your hair
[40:57] you're still okay you can wear pants
[40:59] you're still okay you men can do this
[41:02] and that and the other and you're still
[41:03] okay you know and and and and so they a
[41:07] lot of those uh denomination they've
[41:09] changed their views on those things yes
[41:12] sir you know I can tell you this from my
[41:14] own experience from uh the the
[41:17] nomination that my family was associated
[41:19] with uh you know at one time I'll tell
[41:22] you friends they they taught Holiness
[41:24] and that to a thing that you would not
[41:27] have went in their churches back then
[41:29] and seen people dress the way you will
[41:31] go into their churches and see them
[41:32] dress
[41:34] today and I'm not just talking about you
[41:36] know you say well yeah maybe they they
[41:39] you know of course they have uh at one
[41:41] time it the women would have never come
[41:44] into church uh wearing pants they would
[41:47] never even have wore that stuff at home
[41:50] I'm talking about some of these Holiness
[41:52] denominations and things so we can look
[41:54] at that and see they've changed because
[41:57] now now they come in wearing pants suits
[41:58] and all that and I'll tell you it don't
[42:00] stop there you know I don't know the
[42:03] last time you've ever been in some of
[42:05] any of those churches and that but I'll
[42:07] tell you this you can go into some of
[42:09] them and you wonder my goodness this
[42:11] don't look any different than being out
[42:12] here on the street this doesn't look any
[42:15] different than than than all the uh uh
[42:19] you know I don't know uh Hollywood movie
[42:21] stars and everything else it's all these
[42:23] symbols out there in the in this sinful
[42:26] world today they just dress just like
[42:28] them you know and so we see that as
[42:31] changed but that's not something that
[42:32] really affects us the the end time uh
[42:36] Believers of this end time truth but
[42:40] what we can actually see is that there
[42:43] has been things that has changed in
[42:46] people who claim to believe had claimed
[42:48] to believe this message at one time oh
[42:50] yeah and the Bible has
[42:53] prophesied that it would happen that
[42:55] everything that could be Shak
[42:57] would be shaken and and there was there
[43:01] was actually prophesied in the
[43:03] scriptures there was going to be an
[43:05] exodus of people from the truth and and
[43:08] we've seen that people walking away that
[43:12] perhaps sojourned with us uh as message
[43:15] Believers for many years and hear uh
[43:18] people and preachers and and and and and
[43:21] officers in the church and everybody
[43:24] there a lot of them has turned their
[43:26] backs on the message and walked away you
[43:28] know some of them turn their back on the
[43:30] message and go out to a denomination
[43:32] some of them turn their back on the
[43:34] message and just go out to the world
[43:36] some of them turn their back on it and
[43:38] they and they they but they still remain
[43:40] religious you know and and that but uh
[43:45] but what is important is that you
[43:48] actually have a revelation that this is
[43:51] the truth because if you have that
[43:54] Revelation you know and the thing about
[43:56] it is friends it's not something that's
[43:59] that mysterious there is it's actually a
[44:01] revelation of the scripture and God has
[44:04] actually come and Vindicated those
[44:07] things over and over again and when you
[44:10] look here in in Galatians you find that
[44:14] Paul there's like six chapters here in
[44:16] Galatians and Paul all throughout
[44:18] Galatians he's dealing with the fact
[44:21] that the galatian people had began to
[44:24] listen to other Brethren that came
[44:27] amongst them and were actually uh uh uh
[44:31] you know presenting things to them with
[44:34] the truth that had been preached to them
[44:37] and actually leading them from the end
[44:40] time message you realize that Paul was
[44:43] not just a great missionary Paul you
[44:47] know Apostle Paul was actually the
[44:50] messenger to the first Gentile Church
[44:53] age and so Paul was a prophet and Paul
[44:57] was the prophet Messenger to the first
[45:00] church age and so God gave him the
[45:05] Revelation that was going to start the
[45:08] foundation for this Gentile
[45:11] bride and so Paul here as he's dealing
[45:15] with this galatian church he begins to
[45:17] tell them look first of all Paul's
[45:19] saying look I want you to realize this
[45:22] what I've got I didn't get it from man
[45:25] Glory
[45:27] Hallelujah I didn't go up and talk even
[45:30] to the brothers in Jerusalem to get this
[45:33] this Revelation true he said I got this
[45:37] from God himself the Lord revealed this
[45:41] to me he said I didn't go confer with
[45:44] flesh when God came and gave me a sign
[45:49] and and and and God was coming to reveal
[45:52] him son not to me but in me Glory
[45:57] yes sir amen and so Paul begins to deal
[46:01] with them you you started listen to
[46:03] these men that they're mixing a leaving
[46:07] with the
[46:09] truth and he says look God has delivered
[46:12] you unto Grace and you're wanting to go
[46:15] back to the law right
[46:18] right he says God's delivered you to
[46:21] grace that your righteousness is by
[46:23] Jesus Christ and you're wanting to go
[46:26] back to the to your own works of the law
[46:30] to to have to to bring yourself to be
[46:33] righteous and he says that no man can be
[46:36] saved by the
[46:38] [Music]
[46:39] law so these were the things that Paul
[46:42] was dealing with and and these were the
[46:45] so-called message Believers of that day
[46:49] yeah and Paul saying you've begin
[46:52] listening to this one and that one and
[46:54] that he says they've crept in Paul
[46:56] actually says in one place I wish I
[46:59] could I could get them out away from you
[47:01] right right right yeah amen but Paul and
[47:07] when Paul speaks about these men then
[47:09] here he starts it out he says let them
[47:13] be a
[47:15] cursed now that is actually some very
[47:18] strong language that Paul is using you
[47:21] know
[47:23] uh a curse that word a curse it actually
[47:27] is a word uh that that is translated
[47:30] from uh uh the Greek uh Paul actually
[47:34] uses it in 1
[47:36] Corinthians uh 16 when he says if any
[47:40] man love not the Lord uh uh the Lord
[47:43] Jesus Christ let him be uh
[47:46] anatha
[47:48] Maranatha and Paul uses the Greek words
[47:51] for that and what that means is it it's
[47:55] let the man be a curse
[47:58] uh is what uh anath means uh and maratha
[48:02] means our Lord cometh or will come soon
[48:06] and so Paul uh used this as very strong
[48:10] language but like I said there was these
[48:12] men that had creeped in and they were
[48:14] were trying to lead people away from the
[48:17] truth the message that that had been
[48:20] brought to them by the prophet messenger
[48:23] of that day and so Paul says let them be
[48:27] and he uses this this Greek term here
[48:30] for a curse but actually when you look
[48:33] at the complete translation of of that
[48:35] it actually means to withdraw and
[48:39] separate yourself from these
[48:43] individuals don't Fellowship them it
[48:46] said to draw and separate from all who
[48:49] love not the Lord Jesus Christ all that
[48:53] love not the end time truth you know
[48:56] that actually and look friends I'm not
[48:59] talking we realize we we've got to
[49:01] witness to people we got to bring people
[49:02] in and all that you know but I'll tell
[49:04] you friends there is a line that
[49:06] individuals can cross and we have we
[49:09] have seen that in the ranks of the
[49:12] message where not only just people but
[49:15] actually even preachers that had come in
[49:17] that were supposed to be god-called
[49:19] preachers preaching this end time truth
[49:22] have actually turned did a 180 on it and
[49:26] and and it's and that's not enough for
[49:28] them when they leave they got to make
[49:31] videos and they got to post things
[49:34] online and they got to you know and get
[49:36] all this out here to I'm going to tell
[49:38] you what friends let them be a curse
[49:41] don't watch their videos don't read
[49:43] their
[49:46] stuff you say are you afraid that I
[49:48] could be persuaded no if you are elect
[49:51] you will not be persuaded but why waste
[49:54] your time
[49:57] right if this has been revealed to you
[49:59] look friends this message has been
[50:01] revealed to
[50:04] me it has been revealed to me that
[50:07] William brandham was the end time
[50:09] messenger and prophet of God that was to
[50:12] bring and fulfill the promises of God in
[50:15] the word and restore to this end time
[50:18] bride the the truth that started at the
[50:21] beginning with the first messenger Paul
[50:28] right why do why these different people
[50:31] leave it because it never was a
[50:33] revelation to
[50:36] them and I'll tell you this friends if
[50:39] they're not elect seed of God it's
[50:41] impossible for them to ever get a
[50:43] revelation of
[50:44] it that's it you say why did they stick
[50:47] around so long brother bam said they got
[50:50] an intellectual
[50:54] conception and if that's all any
[50:56] anybody's got an intellectual conception
[50:58] they can be talked out of it they can be
[51:01] reasoned out of
[51:09] it so here in Galatians chapter one Paul
[51:14] begins to express to the people look
[51:17] that I'm the messenger that God has sent
[51:20] and and then he says look I've been
[51:24] Vindicated God has Vindicated me
[51:27] right and and he said look I didn't get
[51:30] this from man God gave this to me amen
[51:34] amen that's the true
[51:37] Hallelujah Paul you know uh Paul
[51:41] actually had been uh
[51:44] trained uh prior to God coming and
[51:48] speaking to him and revealing these
[51:51] things to him Paul had been trained by
[51:53] the great teachers uh of the Jewish
[51:58] religion brother benam said the thing
[52:00] was they were all great teachers of the
[52:03] religion he said but every one of them
[52:05] were
[52:07] carnal he says and everything Paul had
[52:10] been taught was actually man-made you
[52:13] say yeah but Paul talked about uh you
[52:15] know he was schooled in the law and the
[52:17] keeping of the law and all that but you
[52:19] realize friends they had so took the the
[52:23] the religious teachers and things of
[52:26] that day had so took and
[52:28] resculpted the the the the writings in
[52:32] the Old Testament the prophecies and the
[52:34] law on that to when the the Fulfillment
[52:37] of them was coming to pass when Jesus
[52:40] Christ came on the scene they had so
[52:42] resculpted the word that they and the
[52:45] prophecies that they claimed to believe
[52:48] that they didn't even recognize those
[52:50] prophecies coming to pass they didn't
[52:52] even recognize that all of the things
[52:55] that the law and shadows and types that
[52:57] it pointed to was coming to pass when
[53:00] Jesus Christ was
[53:01] [Music]
[53:05] born that's why you see so many of the
[53:07] the you try to sometimes talk to uh
[53:10] perhaps maybe even denominational people
[53:12] or or preachers or teachers within their
[53:15] religions and that and
[53:18] and they they don't want to they don't
[53:20] want to hear you
[53:24] no you try to try to offer a book of of
[53:28] brother Brandon one of his messages I
[53:29] ain't reading
[53:34] that and and and the thing is they are
[53:38] so they're they what they believe is
[53:42] man-made it's been took the scriptures
[53:45] has been took and re and been sculptured
[53:48] and
[53:48] reformed to become whatever their
[53:51] beliefs of and their particular
[53:53] religions are today within their own
[53:55] denomination
[53:59] like brother Ram says none of them can
[54:00] even agree with one
[54:03] another God says he says when God comes
[54:07] he ask one minut who's he going to judge
[54:09] by is he going to judge by the Baptist
[54:11] or the or the Pentecostals or is he
[54:14] going to you know judge by what which
[54:16] one of the religions he going to take to
[54:18] judge people
[54:19] by brother man says he's ain't going to
[54:21] judge by any of that it's all manmade he
[54:23] says he's going to judge it by his word
[54:26] and this is what Paul was presenting to
[54:29] the galatian church I've delivered to
[54:30] you the pure word prise
[54:34] God so anybody that's coming into you
[54:38] and telling you something different than
[54:40] what's been preached
[54:43] right don't listen to them let them be a
[54:48] cursed that's right separate yourself
[54:51] from
[54:53] them Paul was ruled he knew the Old
[55:01] Testament so when when the light
[55:05] appeared to him and he said Lord who are
[55:08] you he recognized that light had to be
[55:10] the Lord amen he said Lord who are you
[55:14] and the voice said I'm Jesus whom thou
[55:17] persecuted
[55:19] right so at Paul's like well this is all
[55:24] I know but I believe what what this
[55:26] voice I know that is the
[55:29] Lord I believe this light I know it's
[55:32] the
[55:32] Lord so then Paul went off for three
[55:36] years to Arabia and brother ROM said
[55:39] what he did was said Paul began to go
[55:42] back over the Old Testament the writings
[55:44] of the laws and the prophets and
[55:46] everything right he says until he saw
[55:49] Jehovah of the old was Jesus of the
[55:53] new and he said he didn't confer like he
[55:56] said he didn't confer with Peter James
[55:59] John or any of them up in Jerusalem
[56:01] after God spoke to him but he went off
[56:04] and he got alone with God and brother B
[56:06] said when he came back he was preaching
[56:08] the same thing they were
[56:11] [Applause]
[56:14] preaching you
[56:16] know as as Ministers of this gospel this
[56:20] end time message that God has called we
[56:23] we don't get on the phone all the time
[56:25] and and or emailing and texting and
[56:28] everything else trying to so what do you
[56:29] think about this what do you think about
[56:31] that hey what how are you looking at
[56:33] this right here and that I mean sure we
[56:35] like the fellowship and when we get
[56:36] together we'll we'll talk some things of
[56:38] what we're we're seeing and things and
[56:39] if we got a question we'll ask one
[56:41] another and that but we're not actually
[56:43] checking around all the churches to see
[56:46] hey look we all got to be on the same
[56:47] thing now
[56:51] here you know we we all got to be
[56:53] presenting this just right the same way
[56:55] here but when you go to look and if you
[56:58] know I don't actually do a lot of
[57:00] listening out in other places a little
[57:03] but I know and it's fine if you do but
[57:06] uh you know but when I do I see they're
[57:09] all preaching the same thing I'm
[57:14] preaching I have somebody I have a one
[57:16] of the ministers God called comes to the
[57:18] church and that begins to preach and the
[57:20] people are sitting there in the seron
[57:21] say we just heard Brother jury preach on
[57:23] these these say some these same things
[57:26] praise the Lord I've got people in my
[57:28] church you know that they there are
[57:29] certain ministers they like to listen to
[57:32] regularly as well you know and and that
[57:35] and and and and they'll come and they'll
[57:36] tell me hey you preach this and this and
[57:40] this brother Donnie's been covering
[57:42] services on it your brother's been
[57:43] preaching on this this one you know
[57:45] brother Tim puit or this one or that one
[57:47] or whoever you know and I like well see
[57:49] what it is we're not conferring with one
[57:52] another but we're all conferring with
[57:54] the same one Hallelujah
[57:59] because friends just as much as man can
[58:02] take the Bible and twisted there's been
[58:05] many preachers that's done that same
[58:07] thing with this end time
[58:10] message they'll take this quote and that
[58:13] quote and twist that's where all these
[58:15] doctrines that they ran off onto
[58:17] tangents over the years came from they
[58:21] they took certain quotes and ran off on
[58:24] things you you can look now here we
[58:26] stand uh
[58:29] 2024 look back at if any of you are
[58:32] aware look back at some of the doctrines
[58:34] that was going on during the 70s and
[58:37] 80s and you think man now that those are
[58:42] crazy God's got God took the prophet and
[58:46] now he's got seven men here and those
[58:48] seven men are the Thunders that God's
[58:51] going to use and you've got to be with
[58:53] these seven men to get the real re of
[58:56] this message and that that sounds insane
[58:59] today yeah but I'll tell you what back
[59:02] in the 70s there was people flock into
[59:04] that right
[59:10] right when when God begin to actually as
[59:15] a truth there at the beginning of the
[59:16] 80s God be you seen the real God called
[59:19] ministers to move and they begin to see
[59:21] look hey look the seventh seal was
[59:23] revealed right amen true and they begin
[59:27] to see look what brother Ram's Ministry
[59:30] was it was what was Luke 17 and 30 right
[59:36] when when it was the appearing of the
[59:38] son of man
[59:41] right brother brandham was preaching
[59:43] these things back in the 60s right amen
[59:46] and and even
[59:48] before and brother Bram you know but by
[59:51] the time it it came into the 60s brother
[59:53] Ram stood there and he was Sav now Luke
[59:56] 17:30 as it was in the days of lot so
[59:59] shall it be in the days when the son of
[1:00:01] man is being uh is being revealed and he
[1:00:05] and he said now and you know a lot of
[1:00:07] people focus on oh yeah lot and Sodom
[1:00:09] and all brother said no no here's what
[1:00:11] you need to focus on as the Believers
[1:00:14] there was one that stayed back there
[1:00:15] with Abraham that's right amen amen yeah
[1:00:20] he said there was two Messengers he said
[1:00:22] they went down there to get lot out of
[1:00:24] Sodom and brother benam the two modern
[1:00:26] day ministers he said that were going
[1:00:28] down to
[1:00:30] Sodom but he said now there was one that
[1:00:33] stayed back there with Abraham and he
[1:00:35] said he stood there with his back to the
[1:00:36] door of the tent and told the thoughts
[1:00:38] and intents of Sarah's heart and he said
[1:00:42] and we've been promised that again in
[1:00:45] this day amen and then he stood there
[1:00:47] finally one service had his back to the
[1:00:50] to the people and he be to call people
[1:00:52] out and in discernment tell them their
[1:00:55] names who they where they were from what
[1:00:57] sickness they had in that and then he
[1:00:59] turns back around fa the people and says
[1:01:01] is that not the same God that stood
[1:01:04] there with Abraham with his his back to
[1:01:07] the door of the
[1:01:08] [Applause]
[1:01:10] tent God promised to vindicate this and
[1:01:13] do this again he says and God's doing it
[1:01:17] again so you know we begin to see look
[1:01:20] the word has actually been opened
[1:01:23] amen it is important it look it was
[1:01:27] important in Paul's day to have for them
[1:01:29] to have a revelation that Paul was that
[1:01:31] messenger and that's why Paul begins to
[1:01:34] introduce this here that way uh talking
[1:01:37] speaking toward himself and the
[1:01:39] Vindication how God had Vindicated him
[1:01:42] and that he he speaks about that here in
[1:01:44] in the beginning of
[1:01:46] Galatians because it was important for
[1:01:48] the people to realize and have a
[1:01:51] revelation of who he was so that they
[1:01:54] could didn't have revelation to look at
[1:01:57] that God had gave him what he was
[1:02:00] saying so then they they could get a
[1:02:03] revelation that was the truth that it
[1:02:06] wasn't just some other man's ideology of
[1:02:10] it amen
[1:02:17] amen Paul says in 1 Corinthians 11 for
[1:02:20] this I have received of the
[1:02:24] Lord praise God
[1:02:30] thank you brother brandom referring to
[1:02:33] just that portion of Paul saying for
[1:02:34] this I've received the Lord then he says
[1:02:37] this what I just spoke to you about
[1:02:39] about Luke 17 and3 and he said the son
[1:02:42] of man is prophesied to be revealed he
[1:02:45] said and what kind of a revelation will
[1:02:48] it be it'll be a revelation of his
[1:02:50] living after being crucified for 1900
[1:02:53] years and is raised from the dead and is
[1:02:55] alive with us he'll be revealed and he
[1:02:58] says look you don't need to interpret
[1:03:01] the word the word interprets Itself by
[1:03:04] bringing it to pass that's
[1:03:07] right and he says and it the word don't
[1:03:11] need any interpretation it's doing it
[1:03:13] itself revealing Christ in the promise
[1:03:16] of the age that's exactly what will come
[1:03:20] on the scene in this age sure sure and
[1:03:24] it did amen
[1:03:29] and when you get and it friends look
[1:03:32] there was there's many people that go
[1:03:33] around saying they believe brother
[1:03:35] brandom's a
[1:03:38] prophet but then when you begin to watch
[1:03:40] him you
[1:03:41] realize they're saying they believe it
[1:03:44] but evidently they don't got a
[1:03:45] revelation of
[1:03:49] it because how can you believe that
[1:03:51] brother Brandon was the prophet
[1:03:53] Messenger to the age but you believe in
[1:03:55] St at home listening to
[1:03:57] tapes CU that's not what the prophet
[1:04:00] [Music]
[1:04:03] preached how can you how can people
[1:04:05] claim they believe he's a prophet but
[1:04:07] then they they don't believe God really
[1:04:10] uses the five-fold ministry
[1:04:13] anymore brother venam never preached
[1:04:19] that look in the days when Jesus Christ
[1:04:22] came they were claiming Abraham as their
[1:04:25] father right the prophet Abraham's our
[1:04:28] Prophet we're his
[1:04:30] children Jesus
[1:04:32] said no you
[1:04:35] know if you were his children you'd do
[1:04:38] his
[1:04:38] works that's it if you believe the
[1:04:41] prophet Abraham you would do what the
[1:04:43] prophet Abraham said you would do his
[1:04:47] works and he said and and you seek to
[1:04:51] kill me he said this did not
[1:04:54] Abraham right
[1:04:58] so you know people saying I believe the
[1:05:02] prophet but friends they don't really
[1:05:05] walk according to what he
[1:05:12] preached look I've got
[1:05:15] folks that is around the area where I'm
[1:05:19] at that they believe it is good enough
[1:05:22] for them to just believe that brother
[1:05:24] brandham was a prophet
[1:05:26] and say well I love brother
[1:05:29] brandom that means I'm going to be
[1:05:34] there I've been there almost 26 years
[1:05:37] and some of them have never darkened the
[1:05:39] door
[1:05:40] once but they walk around saying they
[1:05:43] believe brother brandom was a
[1:05:48] prophet and they well I love brother
[1:05:51] brandom I'm going to be there because it
[1:05:53] said all that he ever loved and all that
[1:05:56] ever loved him is going to be
[1:06:01] there and friends and and there's a
[1:06:03] generation of people that the thing
[1:06:06] about it was that's what their mom and
[1:06:08] dads did their mom and dads never went
[1:06:10] to church claim to believe the message
[1:06:12] and they never went to church so so that
[1:06:15] was the example the children
[1:06:18] had but I can tell you this it wouldn't
[1:06:21] matter what the example was if there was
[1:06:23] a Le seed inside of an individual were
[1:06:25] there they would actually catch the
[1:06:27] truth irregardless of what Mom and Dad
[1:06:30] said because you you look at many of you
[1:06:33] here there's some of you sitting here
[1:06:35] today you're not following this message
[1:06:37] cuz Mommy and Daddy did some of your
[1:06:39] mommies and daddies they were they
[1:06:40] believed other things and we're other
[1:06:42] religions and I'm not trying to be
[1:06:44] disparaging or or down on them but I'm
[1:06:46] saying God revealed this to
[1:06:52] you you might have been raised in in
[1:06:54] some other Church some other
[1:06:56] denomination or or or or even by worldly
[1:06:59] people but here you stand believing the
[1:07:01] end time truth why because God revealed
[1:07:05] it to you friends and look it it wasn't
[1:07:09] just a revealing like as of
[1:07:11] understanding of
[1:07:13] knowledge right but there was something
[1:07:15] Supernatural that happened in your life
[1:07:20] TR friends I'll tell you this people
[1:07:23] talk about you know this preacher you
[1:07:25] know he he's made videos and said uh I
[1:07:28] I'm going to show you all these things
[1:07:29] that William brandham said that happened
[1:07:31] and that that never happened and and you
[1:07:33] can check all these things out and you
[1:07:34] be the judge and all that I don't even
[1:07:37] want to watch what the guy's got to
[1:07:39] say that's
[1:07:42] right why CU I'm going to tell you this
[1:07:45] friends something happened in
[1:07:48] me and it wasn't it wasn't because my
[1:07:51] mom and dad had tapes in the home I had
[1:07:54] to get the Revelation for myself I had
[1:07:57] to have a personal experience with Jesus
[1:08:00] Christ in my own
[1:08:05] heart and I'll tell you something
[1:08:07] friends I look at that and I'll and I've
[1:08:09] actually even told people years back I
[1:08:11] said look if my mom and dad and
[1:08:13] everybody I knew turned their backs and
[1:08:15] walked away from this it would not
[1:08:16] affect me a bit because I've got a
[1:08:19] personal revelation that this is the
[1:08:21] truth and I said and it's not a
[1:08:24] revelation of an standing or or boy I
[1:08:27] know a lot of great Mysteries something
[1:08:30] happened in me it changed my
[1:08:34] life and when I see this message and
[1:08:37] read the things and hear the things the
[1:08:39] prophet says I'm seeing my
[1:08:42] identification who I
[1:08:46] am
[1:08:53] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:00] the Bible said he that receiveth a
[1:09:03] prophet in the name of a prophet right
[1:09:05] receiveth a prophet's reward right oh
[1:09:09] yeah I believe it you know I I had a lot
[1:09:12] of people talk to me there speculations
[1:09:14] on this and that but I'll tell you what
[1:09:16] I can just take you straight to what the
[1:09:17] prophet
[1:09:18] said in in the church age book brother
[1:09:22] mam
[1:09:23] said once prophets in the Land once more
[1:09:27] God will reveal the truth as he did to
[1:09:29] Paul in the days of the seventh
[1:09:31] messenger in the days of the lean Age
[1:09:34] The Messenger will reveal the mysteries
[1:09:36] of God as revealed to Paul he'll speak
[1:09:39] out and those who receive that prophet
[1:09:41] in his own name will receive the benefit
[1:09:44] effect of that prophet's
[1:09:48] Ministry and he said and they that hear
[1:09:50] him will be blessed and here's the
[1:09:52] benefit effect and become heart of the
[1:09:55] Bride in the last day that's mentioned
[1:09:58] in Revelations
[1:10:00] 22:17 the spirit and the bride say
[1:10:04] come
[1:10:06] Hallelujah brother Adam said look
[1:10:08] friends I'm going to tell you something
[1:10:10] I I look at these things that that Paul
[1:10:12] said and how he pointed his Vindication
[1:10:14] then I look at the Vindication that we
[1:10:17] look friends look I I don't get these
[1:10:23] people they that try to point at these
[1:10:25] things about well the bridge and all
[1:10:27] this and that and the other I'm going to
[1:10:29] tell you something friend I don't care
[1:10:30] what they say that all happened
[1:10:34] yeah the angels and and and and the
[1:10:37] cloud and all that all
[1:10:39] happened look Life Magazine didn't take
[1:10:42] a picture of an imagination right
[1:10:45] amen you know some sometimes you know uh
[1:10:50] like well coming up driving up here you
[1:10:52] know it got daylight when it got
[1:10:53] daylight we had our two our
[1:10:55] grandchildren with us and and one the
[1:10:58] rose was looking out the window and she
[1:10:59] saw this cloud and she said that cloud
[1:11:01] kind of exe resembles a certain certain
[1:11:04] kind of animal to me that wasn't what
[1:11:06] this
[1:11:12] was this wasn't somebody looking at a
[1:11:14] cloud and saying kind of think it looks
[1:11:16] like a turtle I kind of think it looks
[1:11:18] like a horse or I kind of think it looks
[1:11:20] like this brother R said take that cloud
[1:11:24] a picture of that cloud and he and turn
[1:11:25] it up on his side and it match the
[1:11:28] Hoffman head of Christ
[1:11:33] exactly Hallelujah people say oh brother
[1:11:36] Brandon wasn't caught up in that believe
[1:11:38] what you
[1:11:39] want you say how do you know you weren't
[1:11:42] there what what did you see you know how
[1:11:44] I know because friends it's been
[1:11:46] revealed to me that what God revealed to
[1:11:48] him when he was caught up by them seven
[1:11:51] angels is what it's been revealed to me
[1:11:54] through the word that he preached I
[1:11:57] don't just look at what he said in the
[1:11:59] message and say Okay I accept what he
[1:12:00] said I see what he said in the message
[1:12:03] in the word because that's what brother
[1:12:05] randam pointed
[1:12:06] to brother Ram look friends this end
[1:12:09] time message it was not of men neither
[1:12:12] was it by
[1:12:18] manall this the the re revelation of the
[1:12:22] seals remember brother brandom he would
[1:12:24] talk about he he was actually he did
[1:12:26] look at what some other preachers and
[1:12:28] different men had said about this and
[1:12:29] that and he said and many of them he
[1:12:31] said said about that first horse rider
[1:12:33] they said oh that was Christ cuz it you
[1:12:35] know was on a white horse and all this
[1:12:37] and that and brother Ram said you know
[1:12:39] he was looking at those things and then
[1:12:40] the Lord revealed to him no no that
[1:12:42] wasn't that was the Antichrist he had a
[1:12:44] bow and no arrows amen amen and was
[1:12:48] white because it was an innocent looking
[1:12:52] Doctrine at the time right right
[1:12:57] amen but then look down through all
[1:12:59] those four horse riders and see how it
[1:13:01] progressed because it was the same horse
[1:13:07] rider it was just as it changed colors
[1:13:10] it was because it was representing how
[1:13:12] that was
[1:13:14] progressing amen hallelujah yes sir
[1:13:18] praise God
[1:13:22] hallelujah and look friends
[1:13:26] this isn't look there are people that
[1:13:28] have uh that follow certain religions in
[1:13:31] the
[1:13:32] world and they follow some some of them
[1:13:35] have men that they claim to be their
[1:13:37] prophet of their religion right
[1:13:41] right and and they follow them but you
[1:13:45] know many of them it has been pointed
[1:13:48] out uh some of the the actually
[1:13:52] uh very ungodly things in the ways that
[1:13:55] they
[1:13:57] lived
[1:14:01] right you know and uh but I'm going to
[1:14:05] tell you this friends God Vindicated
[1:14:07] this end time prophet and you're not
[1:14:09] going to find in any type of uh filth
[1:14:13] and dirt and ungodly things that's right
[1:14:18] remember the the angel spoke to him and
[1:14:20] said don't ever drink smoke or defile
[1:14:23] your body in any way
[1:14:25] that's
[1:14:26] right but God didn't just after God had
[1:14:30] that spoke to brother brandom he didn't
[1:14:31] just leave that in brother bram's hands
[1:14:33] and leave it up to
[1:14:35] him every time that the Flesh of William
[1:14:39] brandham would go to look at his life
[1:14:41] story and everything said he his daddy
[1:14:43] would call him a and everything
[1:14:45] else he'd say give me that bottle and
[1:14:47] he'd go to take a drink and here it come
[1:14:50] that Whirlwind come boy that that wind
[1:14:52] come and he would drop it and go of
[1:14:55] crying
[1:14:58] right God was protecting
[1:15:04] that why because God was going to be
[1:15:07] bringing the end time truth bringing the
[1:15:11] the the Mysteries that were hidden and
[1:15:14] the actual uh truth that actually had
[1:15:18] been lost during the Dark
[1:15:20] Ages the truth of the godhead friends
[1:15:23] look we know Martin Luther you know he
[1:15:26] he took the first step stepping away
[1:15:27] from the the the Catholic church and
[1:15:30] that but Martin Luther was still the
[1:15:32] trinitarian god hadn't revealed that
[1:15:40] yet God promised a prophet in this end
[1:15:44] time that would be the voice that when
[1:15:49] that voice begin to sound all the
[1:15:51] mysteries of God that had been hidden
[1:15:53] would be revealed
[1:15:58] Hallelujah we we've got some people
[1:16:01] claim to be message Believers stumbling
[1:16:02] around some of them they don't believe
[1:16:04] the seventh seal was open right right
[1:16:07] that's true and they go and they read
[1:16:08] the seal book and they listen to the
[1:16:10] tape and they say well look what he says

[1:16:15] everything he said right there look what
[1:16:18] he says right there at the end of he

[1:16:27] damage then you don't even got to go

[1:16:42] titles
[1:16:44] Rapture Christ the mystery that God
[1:16:49] revealed future
[1:16:52] home my it just goes on and on
[1:16:56] on what was it friends look I'm going to
[1:16:59] tell you something the seven seal wasn't
[1:17:02] just a happening the seven seal was a
[1:17:06] person that's
[1:17:09] good it was Christ that that that Lamb
[1:17:13] of God that actually had the book that
[1:17:16] was worthy to have the book and worthy
[1:17:18] to loose the seals that came every night
[1:17:22] and opened each seal
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:31] hallu there's been many people I can
[1:17:34] remember when I was a little boy I was
[1:17:36] sitting we had a we had
[1:17:38] service and and this has nothing to do
[1:17:40] with that church or any of the Brethren
[1:17:42] don't take it that way but because this
[1:17:44] was back in the the early 70s and and
[1:17:48] that and so uh we we' had church that
[1:17:50] morning there was a visiting Ministry in
[1:17:52] we had a dinner and we went to the the
[1:17:54] dinner you know and and uh the the
[1:17:58] brothers were still there and and there
[1:18:00] was preachers all sitting at this table
[1:18:03] fellowshipping and uh and and I guess
[1:18:06] maybe all the the other children had
[1:18:08] already left you know maybe they went to
[1:18:10] go get ready for the service or whatever
[1:18:12] that we was going to have for that night
[1:18:14] and so but there was no other kids there
[1:18:15] so uh I went over sit down at the table
[1:18:18] with the preachers and I just sit on the
[1:18:20] end you know but I was taught right I
[1:18:22] kept my mouth shut and just listen now
[1:18:27] you know I told my mom about this reason
[1:18:28] I said there was a lot of things they
[1:18:30] were saying that I didn't understand the
[1:18:32] words they were saying at the time and
[1:18:35] because they were talking about the
[1:18:36] third pool and I thought they were
[1:18:37] saying p l not p
[1:18:41] l and so I was like I don't know what
[1:18:44] these swimming pools are going to be you
[1:18:46] know but I listened anyway but the thing
[1:18:48] about it was friends this is what I did
[1:18:50] pick up all them sitting there talking
[1:18:52] they didn't know what the third pool was
[1:18:53] either
[1:18:56] they were all speculating you think it
[1:18:58] could be this and you think it could be
[1:18:59] that and well speak limbs into existence
[1:19:02] and and these different things like that
[1:19:04] but now you know and it was there all
[1:19:06] the time amen but now we look and all of
[1:19:09] a sudden we're seeing it's been brought
[1:19:11] out by the five4 ministry that's been
[1:19:13] brought out over o over this you know
[1:19:15] these I don't know recent 40 years or so
[1:19:19] and they're saying look brother ROM said
[1:19:21] the third pull was the opening of the
[1:19:23] seals yes amen it was the opening of the
[1:19:26] [Applause]
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:19:28] word and now of course he talks about
[1:19:31] the manifestations of the third pool and
[1:19:33] all this but brother benam he he said
[1:19:35] look this was the opening of the word it
[1:19:37] was the revealing of the
[1:19:40] seals Hallelujah it just came a season

[1:19:46] to the elect his elect his bride in this

[1:20:15] happened to that little fish it was the
[1:20:17] same thing that brought that squirrel
[1:20:19] squirrels into existence it was the same
[1:20:22] thing that spoke to the storm and told
[1:20:24] to go back where it came from what was
[1:20:26] it it was a work of God it was a new
[1:20:29] life it was a new creation in my
[1:20:32] life it was a resurrection that took
[1:20:36] place in my soul just like it did in

[1:20:49] manifestation today of the third
[1:20:52] pool Hallelujah

[1:20:59] other people got to say and everything's
[1:21:01] ever going to sway
[1:21:03] me that's
[1:21:05] right that's the truth
[1:21:08] hallelujah praise the lord it's been
[1:21:10] revealed to me brother brandom didn't
[1:21:12] get this from some man it was revealed
[1:21:15] to him by God Amen right God caught him
[1:21:19] up those Angels Came caught him up the
[1:21:23] Lamb of God came and revealed those
[1:21:25] seals
[1:21:28] there
[1:21:31] amen there's one man that uh that you
[1:21:35] know a preacher that turned his back on
[1:21:37] this message and walk away I happened to
[1:21:39] know his daddy his daddy had been in
[1:21:40] brother Bam's meetings and all that and
[1:21:43] I I talked to another man that that is
[1:21:45] about my age that was actually close
[1:21:47] with this elderly man and he asked this
[1:21:50] elderly man he said look during your
[1:21:52] time he said you saw this great
[1:21:54] evangelist and you saw that great
[1:21:56] evangelist you saw this man saying he
[1:21:57] was a Healer you saw that one saying he
[1:21:59] was healer he says and you was in
[1:22:01] brother branham's meetings he says he
[1:22:03] say what was different about it to
[1:22:07] you and this this brother whose son
[1:22:11] turned around and left the message later
[1:22:14] this brother said
[1:22:16] because he never missed right that's
[1:22:20] right every time he said thus sayith the
[1:22:23] Lord it happened
[1:22:29] exactly hallu
[1:22:33] Hallelujah he said you're I was in all
[1:22:36] these other meetings of all these other
[1:22:37] so-called great men and that he said but
[1:22:40] I want to tell you what the difference
[1:22:44] was I'll tell you what it was never a
[1:22:47] man spake like this
[1:22:51] man hallelujah praise the Lord you know
[1:22:55] brother Brandon he would he would make
[1:22:57] statements at different times saying you
[1:22:58] know I'm really not a great speaker you
[1:23:01] know and he says you know I'm not I I'm
[1:23:04] not real organized with with by speaking
[1:23:07] I'm not really educated and he says some
[1:23:09] of these preachers here they're much
[1:23:11] better preachers than me
[1:23:15] right friends look God wasn't sending us
[1:23:18] a a grand uh I don't even know the word
[1:23:21] to use other than speaker you know
[1:23:23] somebody that very good auditory and all
[1:23:26] that whatever and that that wasn't what
[1:23:27] God was sending us it wasn't the voice
[1:23:30] of the man it was the voice behind the
[1:23:33] voice that was the voice we're hearing
[1:23:36] that's the voice we're still hearing
[1:23:38] today that is still the voice that
[1:23:40] speaking through God's called fivefold
[1:23:44] Ministry of this end time truth today
[1:23:46] it's still the same
[1:23:50] voice hallelujah hallelujah that's right
[1:23:53] remember the Bible says in the Book of
[1:23:55] Revelations it said the voice singular
[1:23:58] of many
[1:23:59] Waters so it's it's many
[1:24:02] preaches within this five-fold ministry
[1:24:06] but it's the same
[1:24:09] voice and because it's the same voice
[1:24:12] then you can see when brother Brandon
[1:24:14] points this out in Revelations where it
[1:24:16] says the spirit says come and the bride
[1:24:19] says come he said in the last day he
[1:24:21] said the prophet and the spirit and the
[1:24:23] bride will be saying the same
[1:24:26] thing he says and what they say will
[1:24:29] have already been
[1:24:32] said
[1:24:34] hallelujah
[1:24:36] hallelujah who is the final voice to the
[1:24:38] final age yeah like I said there's a
[1:24:41] singular voice it's Christ but who is
[1:24:43] who is God using in this final the final
[1:24:47] time in this final leads the final voice
[1:24:49] is
[1:24:50] bride that's
[1:24:52] righten yeah
[1:24:55] all right the seventh seal look at
[1:24:58] Christ The Mystery of God revealed
[1:25:00] brother Ram said God had a threefold
[1:25:05] purpose he said his first purpose was he
[1:25:08] wanted to reveal himself to his
[1:25:11] people and he said he couldn't reveal
[1:25:14] himself that way as the great Jehovah
[1:25:16] God that that uh uh uh occupied all time
[1:25:19] space and Eternity said but he actually
[1:25:22] wanted to come down he said and identify
[1:25:27] himself with man in
[1:25:32] flesh he said he wanted to uh to
[1:25:36] identify himself with human beings right
[1:25:40] so he came down and became one of
[1:25:44] us so he says the first fold of that
[1:25:48] three-fold purpose was God coming down
[1:25:51] and revealing himself in Christ
[1:25:55] hallah thank you God Jesus said I'll not
[1:25:58] leave you
[1:25:59] comfortless he said I go I go to the
[1:26:02] father but I I I'll send the comforter
[1:26:04] to you and he said I'll come
[1:26:09] again go Terry in Jerusalem until you're
[1:26:13] in Du with power from on
[1:26:16] high brother said the
[1:26:19] second purpose of his three-fold purpose
[1:26:22] he says was to have the preeminence in
[1:26:25] his church his body the bride the
[1:26:28] Believers he said the second one was to
[1:26:32] come and live not just in Christ in
[1:26:36] flesh but to live in his
[1:26:39] people hallu then he says the
[1:26:42] third purpose of the threefold purpose
[1:26:45] of God he says is to restore the
[1:26:50] kingdom Hallelujah friends look
[1:26:54] I'm part of that third or that that that
[1:26:58] second part that's happened in me that's
[1:27:01] happened in you Christ is living in
[1:27:04] meise the
[1:27:08] Lord look I don't care what anybody else
[1:27:11] believes there's nothing they got to say
[1:27:13] that's going to change what happened in
[1:27:16] me I think about what Paul said I didn't
[1:27:19] get this from man neither was it by man
[1:27:22] amen and I think of that little saying
[1:27:25] the world didn't give it to me and the
[1:27:27] world can't take it
[1:27:30] away these the these carnal intellectual
[1:27:33] believers they didn't give me this
[1:27:35] Revelation and they can't take it
[1:27:40] away
[1:27:41] hallelujah praise be to God hallelujah
[1:27:45] and I believe God's having his
[1:27:47] preeminence in his Believers and I'll
[1:27:48] tell you something friends when I look
[1:27:50] around and I see all these things
