[32:59] certainly I know that they could
[33:01] certainly attest to it they certainly
[33:02] appreciated of your prayers and
[33:05] continual prayers for the family for
[33:08] this time when the passing of sister
[33:10] Gomez's mother and we just had just a
[33:14] wonderful service there this morning and
[33:17] then there at the at the graveside but
[33:20] we want to continue to remember them in
[33:22] prayer and just that the Lord will just
[33:25] continue to strengthen them in the midst
[33:27] of this time the Lord is so good in me
[33:30] it's so good so good let's look at
[33:34] Isaiah 43 and I'm just going to read a
[33:37] few verses of Scripture here in verse 1
[33:41] is where we'll start
[33:43] but now thus saith the Lord that created
[33:47] the Oh Jacob and he that formed thee O
[33:50] Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee
[33:55] I have called thee by thy name thou art
[33:59] mine when thou pass it through the
[34:03] waters I will be with thee and through
[34:06] the rivers they shall not overflow thee
[34:08] when thou walk us through the fire thou
[34:11] shalt not be burned neither shall the
[34:15] flame Kindle upon thee let's let's
[34:19] continue reading here just for a few
[34:20] moments for I am the Lord thy God
[34:23] the Holy One of Israel thy Savior I gave
[34:27] a for thy ransom Ethiopia and say
[34:31] before thee since thou was precious in
[34:34] my sight
[34:35] thou has been honorable and I have loved
[34:37] thee therefore will I give men for thee
[34:40] and people for thy life fear not I am
[34:44] with thee I will bring thy seed from the
[34:47] east and gather thee from the West I
[34:50] will say to the north give up and to the
[34:53] south keep not back bring my sons from
[34:57] far and my daughters from the ends of
[34:59] the earth even everyone that is called
[35:02] by my name for I have created him for my
[35:05] glory I have formed him yay I have made
[35:08] him bring forth the blind people that
[35:10] have eyes and the Deaf that have years
[35:12] let all the nations be gathered together
[35:15] and let the people be assembled who
[35:17] among them can declare this and show us
[35:20] former things let them bring forth their
[35:23] witnesses that they may be justified or
[35:25] let them hear and say it is truth ye are
[35:30] my witnesses saith the Lord and my
[35:33] servant whom I have chosen that ye may
[35:36] know and believe me and understand that
[35:38] I am he before me there was no God
[35:40] formed neither shall there be after me I
[35:43] even I am the lord and beside me there
[35:46] is no Savior I have declared have saved
[35:50] and I have showed when there was no
[35:52] strange God among you therefore are ye
[35:55] are my witnesses saith the Lord
[35:57] that I am God it's so precious isn't it
[36:04] word of God this is this is personal
[36:07] it's just personal i I feel like it was
[36:10] wonderful that the Lord would just as
[36:12] what he spoke to us there in the first
[36:14] few verses but then he goes in and just
[36:17] continues to break and make known to you
[36:19] and I over and over though what he
[36:22] already has done and now as we stand as
[36:25] his witnesses for his glory
[36:27] amen let's just bow our heads and order
[36:30] prayer for we're seated our Heavenly
[36:32] Father as we just turn our hearts and
[36:34] our attention for the the next few
[36:37] moment
[36:37] Lord God into your word and we just
[36:40] thank you for the time of worship Lord
[36:42] here tonight Lord that we have we've had
[36:45] in your presence Lord and as we we move
[36:48] on in Lord to worship now or God around
[36:51] your word for it is truly your word that
[36:54] has drawn us to you Lord and we are not
[36:57] people who worship in word only but we
[36:59] worship Lord in spirit and in truth Lord
[37:02] and we would ask the Lord that your
[37:05] precious Holy Spirit Lord you who are
[37:07] the word that you would come Lord and
[37:09] speak to our hearts and a very personal
[37:12] way to night Lord encourage us Lord you
[37:15] know where each and every one is Lord
[37:17] and you are able Lord only you to reach
[37:21] Lord to every heart and every life we
[37:23] want to say thank you Lord for your word
[37:25] tonight Lord and may your presence just
[37:27] in a real sweet way just come among us
[37:29] Lord and speak to our hearts in the name
[37:32] of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless use
[37:35] your being seated I just have one word
[37:41] that I want to just speak tonight and
[37:46] that's the word through through not not
[37:50] throw like a baseball but through like
[37:52] through something that we read here in
[37:55] the scriptures you see and many times
[37:59] you know we can we can talk about
[38:01] different things but unless you've been
[38:05] through something you really are only
[38:08] talking about it as a spectator and we
[38:12] know in order to be through something
[38:14] you weren't just you're not when we
[38:16] think of it in terms of the Lord you're
[38:19] not it's not that you're a survivor
[38:21] you're an overcomer
[38:22] so in order to through something there
[38:26] is a there is a part there's a place
[38:28] where it starts and and that state place
[38:30] there here where we come through to an
[38:32] end and you know how it is it's always
[38:34] it's always a comfort when different
[38:36] ones that maybe with things that you're
[38:39] facing or you're going through and
[38:40] you're able to talk with someone that
[38:43] can encourage you that God is faithful
[38:47] you know it's one thing we all can get
[38:50] together and I
[38:51] tell you the worst thing that could be
[38:53] is if if I'm down I want somebody that
[38:55] can come and encourage me I don't want
[38:58] someone who will pull me down and say oh
[39:00] yeah brother Samuel I tell you what I am
[39:02] going through the biggest time of my
[39:04] life I need somebody's gonna encourage
[39:07] me I need someone who's gonna point me
[39:09] and say you know what I may not have
[39:11] been through that exact thing but I can
[39:14] tell you God has brought me through my
[39:18] test and my trials and that right there
[39:21] I can look and say and at that
[39:23] individual that person and to know what
[39:26] they're saying they weren't making light
[39:28] of the trial or the test that I'm in but
[39:30] what it is is that they are testifying
[39:32] of God's faithfulness to see us through
[39:36] and I believe that that's why as a body
[39:39] of believers I believe that that is the
[39:41] working of God within our lives I don't
[39:44] believe friends that it's just reserved
[39:46] to myself as a pastor to be an encourage
[39:49] or of the people although I do encourage
[39:52] but I believe that every one of us in
[39:54] here are to be an encouragement and an
[39:56] edification one to another I believe
[39:59] that I believe that by the working of
[40:01] the Lord within our life your testimony
[40:03] in my testimony it might be somewhat
[40:06] different but there's one thing that's
[40:07] in common with it and that's the Lord
[40:09] Jesus Christ the things that may be that
[40:12] God has brought you through it may be
[40:14] different from me you know sometimes you
[40:16] can take different ones that's been
[40:17] through things medically and then others
[40:20] that may be through things that's been
[40:21] financially and all of these different
[40:23] aspects but in all God has people that
[40:27] he can put his hand upon that no matter
[40:30] what it is that they are facing and
[40:32] going through that it can always be a
[40:34] testimony that they are standing
[40:36] faithful it'd be one thing if if when we
[40:39] stand there and hear the enemy would
[40:41] have some bragging grounds to say well
[40:43] they all have come through when it comes
[40:46] to things medically in their life and
[40:48] you've brought them through and you've
[40:50] healed them each time I mean each time
[40:52] they've not even had to go to a doctor
[40:54] they've never even had to go under a
[40:56] surgeon's knife each and every time and
[40:58] and you know we could we could look at
[41:00] that but yet God has such testimonies
[41:03] that in sometimes just
[41:05] even in our own individual life where
[41:07] God has come on the scene and touched us
[41:09] and then there's been other times where
[41:11] we had to go to a doctor or a surgeon
[41:14] but yet within it all we understand that
[41:17] that in itself our faith is in God our
[41:20] faith is not in the process it's in God
[41:24] to take us through and so within that
[41:27] that encouragement that is given to us
[41:30] and one another I I look here in the
[41:32] scripture my heart is just zeroed in on
[41:34] this here when I look in verse 2 and
[41:36] when I you see it it doesn't say if that
[41:41] you pass through waters you didn't say
[41:44] if you go through rivers if you walk
[41:48] through the fire but all of this is says
[41:50] win so it's not if that's going to be it
[41:54] trials are not inevitable trials trials
[41:58] are gonna be there God's letting them
[41:59] know even beforehand that I'm with you
[42:03] you're gonna come through waters when
[42:05] you do they will not overflow you when
[42:10] you come into rivers they're not gonna
[42:12] drowns you when you come into a fire
[42:16] it's not the fire itself you're not
[42:19] gonna be burned so God is letting us
[42:23] know then he's lettuce lettuce Ron let
[42:26] us know that these are times in your
[42:28] life that you will come through but I
[42:30] want you to know that I'm there with you
[42:33] I want you to know that I'm not off from
[42:35] a distance and watching but I want you
[42:38] to know that I am with you how that God
[42:40] would make that so clear in the
[42:43] scripture I will be with you what a time
[42:48] you know think of this that as we've
[42:51] looked at it over the course of time
[42:53] with the Hebrew children they didn't
[42:55] have an answer from God that he was
[42:57] going to be with them in the fire but
[43:00] where they made their stand was on the
[43:02] word God allowed that whole thing to
[43:06] come God allowed as we looked at it some
[43:08] weeks ago God allowed that silence to be
[43:11] there but you see even in the silence
[43:14] their faith was
[43:16] in the Living God and they stood upon
[43:18] his word and he was after they went
[43:21] through that that God made himself known
[43:25] so it's it's things that when we come
[43:28] down to it that whether we feel him
[43:30] whether we're getting answers right then
[43:34] or not we have this where we can stand
[43:36] on it say Lord regardless if I feel you
[43:39] or not I love to feel you but this is
[43:42] your word this is what you said that you
[43:45] would be with me and I believe that you
[43:48] are with me it's a comfort from the word
[43:52] and when you we look at this you know
[43:55] how that through the midst of it you
[43:58] know I look at how when this when the
[44:00] scripture that we read it says when you
[44:03] pass through the waters II it's not
[44:05] going to be over them but it you're
[44:06] gonna go through the waters you're not
[44:09] gonna be lifted above but you have to go
[44:11] through it but God lets us know through
[44:14] it I'm gonna be right there with you and
[44:16] they made they even makes this statement
[44:19] win that walkest through the fire when
[44:21] thou walkest you know when you walk you
[44:24] know when you're walking somewhere if
[44:26] you're running you can look at somebody
[44:28] running and you could say my they're in
[44:30] a hurry but walking your walk and when
[44:34] your person is walking they're at rest
[44:37] they're moving along and they're at rest
[44:40] it it even speaks of that within our
[44:43] life where God would call us through
[44:45] there's a lot of things that we would
[44:47] like to run through we'd like to run
[44:53] through it but God lets us know when
[44:55] thou walkest if God has permitted a test
[45:00] or trial to come our way then this is
[45:03] where our faith stands resolute that God
[45:05] has permitted sufficient grace to see us
[45:11] through that trial and whether whatever
[45:15] we we cannot going to be able to see it
[45:18] in the midst of it and we may not see it
[45:19] to way after but yet in all God Himself
[45:23] is bringing his purpose forth out of our
[45:27] life
[45:28] and I look here when I just just looking
[45:32] over these things this quote that stood
[45:35] out to me for some months and just
[45:37] pouring I think I've probably listened
[45:39] to this message time-tested memorials of
[45:41] God I don't know how many times in the
[45:43] past months and I just just keep
[45:45] cleaning and gleaning and gleaning from
[45:48] it but there was a phrase in here that I
[45:50] want to just just looking at it's just
[45:53] so resonated my heart brother hem says
[45:55] Jesus Christ came from heaven to glory
[45:58] came from heaven to glory from glory
[46:01] down here they're here to build a church
[46:03] and the material that he's putting in it
[46:05] is time-tested material he said you
[46:09] might come to the altar and make a
[46:11] confession but when he finds blowholes
[46:13] and everything else in to where the
[46:16] world's blown the maggots in you and so
[46:18] forth you cannot stand
[46:20] he just pitches you to one side you know
[46:22] the Bible says that whosoever cometh to
[46:25] God must be chastened and tried is that
[46:28] right there's got to be there's always
[46:29] the testing and try and it's after the
[46:32] trial that God brings the ceiling it's
[46:36] after the trial is over even at every
[46:39] trial that carries on after that it's
[46:41] after that trial where God will make
[46:43] himself known and it's where God is
[46:46] releasing of himself and the real
[46:48] releasing of himself is the real
[46:50] releasing of who the real you and I are
[46:55] see God is not an author of confusion as
[46:58] a great master sculptor when we come
[47:01] into these sacred sands we come into the
[47:03] hot desert sands when we come into these
[47:05] places that God will bring us into areas
[47:09] for our molding and for our perfecting
[47:13] brother brems says God wants a
[47:15] time-tested church not some money's a
[47:18] Christian today and a backslider
[47:20] tomorrow and is in and out up and down
[47:23] he can't place you nowhere but he's got
[47:27] a church that's tested went through the
[47:31] trials through losses through sickness
[47:36] through sorrow through death
[47:39] still standing with the testimony that's
[47:42] the man all of this is gone through so
[47:48] not just someone who came up to it and
[47:50] said no way
[47:52] I mean imagine imagine that within your
[47:58] marriage because serving the Lord look
[48:01] this is not science that's something
[48:02] separate it eat God would even bring
[48:04] that example down to you and I to
[48:06] imagine a link of the vows of what the
[48:09] vows that are made for better for worse
[48:11] in sickness and in health all of these
[48:15] things and yet when there's things that
[48:18] after the marriage itself has has
[48:21] commences then that's when everybody if
[48:24] we can say like this starts to let their
[48:25] hair down that's when you see you really
[48:29] really really get to see not just some
[48:31] faults or little things that you saw but
[48:34] you really begin to see all of that and
[48:36] that's where there has to be a real
[48:40] solidness of real revelation and ink or
[48:44] something that's there to hold you is
[48:48] that true because there there's going to
[48:50] be all sorts of things of
[48:52] disappointments and everything but yet
[48:54] it's through all of that you know just
[48:59] like when they they they always have at
[49:02] the end of those stories we were growing
[49:05] up and they lived happily ever after in
[49:08] an amazing that that phrase is right
[49:11] after their ceremony they lived happily
[49:16] ever after wait a minute here what about
[49:19] all the tests and trial what about all
[49:24] the letting down and all what about all
[49:27] that but you see through through it all
[49:29] it's through those things as we look at
[49:33] it in our walk with the Lord it's
[49:35] through these things where God proves
[49:38] his love and His faithfulness to you and
[49:41] I in even a much deeper way
[49:47] yes brother brems said that's the man
[49:49] he's looking for he says I don't care if
[49:51] you're a pauper I don't care if you're a
[49:53] beggar I don't care if you're a rack
[49:54] dick or whatever you are God puts the
[49:57] test to you he's looking for time-tested
[50:02] material brother Brent makes the
[50:06] statement and that same message of time
[50:08] test of material and he deals with
[50:11] character and he makes a statement he
[50:14] says your your knowing your character is
[50:17] known in life
[50:18] by your works you know it's just like if
[50:22] you're gonna hire someone on to do a job
[50:25] you want to know what kind of job they
[50:27] do is that right I mean if if they're
[50:31] doing a job you know and you know it's
[50:33] just like our brother Richie who does
[50:34] the siding if they went and looked at
[50:36] his houses that he did in siding and all
[50:38] these thing was these rippling and
[50:40] buckling and seeing all these nails
[50:41] coming out and what you think he'd have
[50:44] much business no no because what it is
[50:48] what his name is not Road on the side of
[50:51] that house but yet it is Road on the
[50:53] side of that house when they get to
[50:55] looking at things and many of the times
[50:57] than annuities were brother Richie it's
[50:58] just it's a word-of-mouth thing that
[51:00] where it goes where he has referrals
[51:02] from this contractor referring to this
[51:03] contractor you know I even know how it
[51:06] is when we've have a little thing with
[51:07] in the neighborhood and they're you know
[51:09] wanting to know how can we get to paint
[51:11] and who can we get this and I'll see
[51:13] these little blurbs come up there on my
[51:14] email and they're referring somebody and
[51:16] you know what you start finding a number
[51:18] of people within the neighborhood they
[51:19] own the app they started referring this
[51:21] one person you're like wow this person
[51:24] is referred like eight out of ten times
[51:26] their name keeps coming up and what is
[51:29] written about them now you know that
[51:31] that's just not family members some
[51:37] person the one day actually asked and
[51:39] said how are they related to you and and
[51:43] the person respond they said they're not
[51:45] you know and you had different ones
[51:47] throughout so their work is what is what
[51:50] what testifies of them and that's the
[51:52] same way it is within our life for them
[51:54] says it don't matter how much you
[51:55] testify it don't matter what all you
[51:57] said all those things that you can do
[51:59] your works your life itself speaks out I
[52:05] want to just look here in a place this
[52:08] is a just so gripped my heart as we look
[52:11] at these things with Paul and I've just
[52:14] pondered over these scriptures now for a
[52:16] few months and just looking at it and
[52:18] you know as we see Paul comes the second
[52:22] Corinthians chapter 12 and in verse 11
[52:24] he says I'm become a fool in glorying ye
[52:27] have compelled me for I ought to been
[52:30] commended of you for in nothing I am
[52:32] behind of the very chiefest apostles
[52:34] though I'd be nothing now what Paul is
[52:37] referring to is where you had those
[52:40] other ministers and Paul would refer to
[52:43] him as false brother and in different
[52:45] ones who were coming around and they
[52:47] were you know kind of building
[52:49] themselves up among the people and
[52:50] things like that and Paul he begins to
[52:53] speak of this and that's what he's
[52:55] talking about from the previous chapters
[52:57] which I want to go in just a moment
[52:58] but I want you to watch this what he
[53:00] says here in verse 12 this is just so
[53:02] struck my heart truly the signs of an
[53:06] apostle were wrought among you in all
[53:10] patients in signs wonders and mighty
[53:14] deeds so the signs of an apostle wants
[53:18] you to think
[53:19] look how where Paul is led to include he
[53:24] doesn't start out saying signs wonders
[53:26] mighty deeds but the very first thing is
[53:29] that is the testimony is in all patience
[53:32] that is in all endurance that is a true
[53:38] sign because you see in many of the
[53:41] things within Paul's life there were
[53:43] many times that there were who was we
[53:45] seen cities that were against him people
[53:48] that were against him all of these
[53:50] things that were there and you know what
[53:51] no matter what signs and what deeds
[53:53] could have been in Paul's life if Paul
[53:55] himself would've ran away and forsake it
[53:58] then you know what it would not have
[53:59] been an effectiveness but what they
[54:01] could see is there's something greater
[54:03] than this man's spirit this is just not
[54:06] Paul talking about something preaching
[54:09] about something but this man you
[54:11] standing with the solidness even in the
[54:14] midst of what he's going through
[54:18] remember when plow and read it last week
[54:20] when Paul himself was stoned right
[54:24] outside of of Antioch I believe it was
[54:27] here he was they left him for dead
[54:29] but Paul rose up and he went right back
[54:33] into the city he didn't leave that place
[54:36] and go somewhere else he went right back
[54:38] into the city and then the next day he
[54:41] departed for Lystra why because there
[54:44] are believers that were there in Antioch
[54:48] and they need to see not just hear a
[54:51] word they need to see a faithful word
[54:54] displayed amen that's the testimony
[55:00] friends listen that's a testimony even
[55:03] in this age you see it's not just a
[55:06] message that comes forth I want to just
[55:09] look at this just for a moment I'm not
[55:10] going to dwell on this but it's a great
[55:12] big wonderful subject when brother
[55:14] Branham makes a statement that the
[55:15] message and the messenger of one he lays
[55:18] that all the way down and what he's
[55:20] dealing with within that is that brother
[55:22] Branham himself cannot be speaking
[55:24] something different from the experience
[55:27] of the word in his own life and neither
[55:31] should you and I speak something
[55:33] different from the experience in her own
[55:36] life
[55:37] because it is through that experience it
[55:41] is true that life that's expressed you
[55:43] know how it is on your job in other
[55:45] places there is things where you may not
[55:48] even be able to say anything to anybody
[55:50] but your life that's live will grant
[55:55] access because that is the greatest
[56:00] greatest witness as here the Lord said
[56:03] ye are my witnesses
[56:08] you know God had witnesses who looked at
[56:11] that the witnesses of the Hebrew
[56:13] children he had witnesses down there of
[56:15] Daniel remember the King didn't want to
[56:18] throw Daniel in there he even came in
[56:21] Daniel Daniel has that God spared thee
[56:24] right but it was a witness that right
[56:29] there God allowed that situation allowed
[56:31] that with the Hebrew children it was
[56:33] working out in their life but at the
[56:35] same time there was those things that of
[56:38] that testified and they were witnesses
[56:42] unto the Lord my so many things that
[56:46] they're working out in our life notice
[56:48] how Paul Paul goes into this in 2nd
[56:50] Corinthians 11 verse 16 and in this is
[56:53] where Paul from the previous chapter
[56:56] here where we read he said I say it
[56:58] again let no man think me a fool if
[57:00] otherwise yet as a full received me then
[57:03] I may boast myself a little that which I
[57:07] speak I speak it not after the Lord but
[57:10] as it were foolishly in this confidence
[57:13] of boasting seeing that many glory after
[57:16] the flesh I will glory also for you
[57:18] suffer fools gladly seeing you
[57:21] yourselves are wise for ye suffer if a
[57:24] man bring you into bondage if a man
[57:26] devour you if a man take of you if a man
[57:28] exalts you if a man smite you on the
[57:30] face I speak as concerning reproach as
[57:33] though we have been weak howbeit we're
[57:36] in so ever in his bold I speak foolishly
[57:40] I am bold also so Paul he's already
[57:45] declaring how I'm speaking it's
[57:47] foolishly because why Paul is bringing
[57:50] into account even everything within his
[57:54] life they already know this but you see
[58:00] Paul look what Paul is bringing out here
[58:03] Paul's not saying remember now that
[58:05] there were special miracles that were
[58:07] wrought from my mind their hands he's
[58:10] not testifying of those things in here
[58:13] he could testify because there were many
[58:17] mighty signs and wonders and you know as
[58:20] you read in the book of Acts that there
[58:21] were many places that Paul could not get
[58:24] entrance even in that one who was a
[58:26] governor he could not get entrance there
[58:28] was one who was preventing Paul from
[58:30] getting to that governor there but God
[58:32] moved on the scene and a mighty miracle
[58:35] it moved
[58:36] on the scene to turn that man's heart to
[58:38] open to hear the gospel but yet Paul is
[58:42] talking to believers here now he's late
[58:47] he's talking to them of a real proof and
[58:50] he's bringing them to this understanding
[58:52] he says are they Hebrews so am i are
[58:55] they Israelites Soma are they the seed
[58:59] of Abraham so am i are they ministers of
[59:02] Christ I speak as a fool I am more in
[59:05] Labour's more abundant in stripes above
[59:09] measure in prisons more frequent in
[59:12] deaths often of the Jews five times I
[59:21] received forty stripes save one
[59:29] Thrax was i beaten with rods once was i
[59:33] stoned thrice i suffered shipwreck a
[59:36] night and a day i have been in the deep
[59:38] in journeyings often in perils of water
[59:42] in perils of robbers in perils by my own
[59:45] countrymen in perils by the heathen in
[59:47] perils in the city in perils in the
[59:50] wilderness in perils in the sea in
[59:52] perils among false brethren he's not
[59:57] he's not writing about the signs and
[59:59] wonders he's writing about God's keeping
[1:00:02] power and testimony through the hardness
[1:00:05] and darkest of times that God has seen
[1:00:09] him through why that's a true sign of a
[1:00:14] believer that is a true sign of a
[1:00:17] believer the Bible says these signs
[1:00:20] shall follow them that believe
[1:00:21] absolutely and this is also a truce hi
[1:00:26] it's the first one that Paul wrote about
[1:00:28] he could have said you've seen me in
[1:00:30] deeds and wonders but he laid it down
[1:00:33] first you have witnessed an apostle
[1:00:37] among you in all patience in weariness
[1:00:44] look at this in weariness and
[1:00:47] painfulness in watchings often in hunger
[1:00:51] and thirst in fastings often in cold and
[1:00:57] nakedness nakedness beside those things
[1:01:00] that are without that which cometh upon
[1:01:02] me daily the care of all the churches so
[1:01:06] Paul's not just dealing with that
[1:01:09] everything is it guns are targeted right
[1:01:12] on his life but Paul says also the
[1:01:14] burning of the churches are resting on
[1:01:17] me this burden this care too to carry on
[1:01:22] what was it that allowed Paul to go
[1:01:25] through all of this and stand and
[1:01:27] testify it was the purpose of God that
[1:01:31] it laid such a hole in his life that
[1:01:33] Paul knew who
[1:01:34] he was he knew where he belonged and he
[1:01:37] was standing there it gave him grace to
[1:01:42] face the weariness to face everything
[1:01:45] that came along in peril here and peril
[1:01:47] there and peril there it gave him grace
[1:01:52] who is weak and I am NOT weak who is
[1:01:57] offended and I burn not if I must needs
[1:02:02] glory I will glory of the things which
[1:02:05] concern mine infirmities Nepal was not
[1:02:11] testifying brother Branham lays us out
[1:02:14] in a real way in the message because
[1:02:17] there was somebody going around and
[1:02:19] saying that were Paul glory din his
[1:02:21] infirmities so they had people getting
[1:02:24] up and giving a testimony praise God
[1:02:27] i've got rheumatoid arthritis thank God
[1:02:30] you know that I'm suffering brother
[1:02:32] Brent says he said the poor individual I
[1:02:35] don't know who told him that he said but
[1:02:37] that's not what Paul was talking about
[1:02:39] glory in my infirmities there was a
[1:02:42] condition within Paul's eyes we know
[1:02:44] that would come and it would go is that
[1:02:47] right it would come it would go and you
[1:02:51] know Paul he prayed three times Lord
[1:02:54] take this from me but you know what God
[1:02:59] let him know he is very familiar
[1:03:00] scripture to all of us maybe you have it
[1:03:02] on a plaque at home but he said when God
[1:03:05] spoke to him he said Paul my grace is
[1:03:10] sufficient for thee my strength is made
[1:03:14] perfect in weakness at that moment Paul
[1:03:18] himself said then I will glory in my
[1:03:20] infirmities you know what it was Paul
[1:03:22] began to realize I don't need to focus
[1:03:25] on this I know that God has permit and
[1:03:28] look Paul realized why God permitted it
[1:03:30] he was able to write it what God
[1:03:33] permitted it that this would come upon
[1:03:35] him less Paul himself should get lifted
[1:03:38] above his brethren trials tests and
[1:03:42] things have a way of humbling us
[1:03:46] they have a way of reminding us of the
[1:03:48] frailty of our humanity and that's all
[1:03:53] in everything of bringing out of our
[1:03:55] life it's also God keeping you and I in
[1:03:58] a place to where he can move and work
[1:04:01] and deal with our lives the way that he
[1:04:04] desires to let me read on as Paul says
[1:04:08] in 2nd Corinthians 6 a few chapters
[1:04:10] before that in verse 3 he says giving no
[1:04:13] offence and anything that the ministry
[1:04:15] be not blamed but in all things
[1:04:17] approving ourselves as ministers of God
[1:04:22] in much patience in afflictions in
[1:04:27] necessities in de-stresses surely Paul
[1:04:34] got this wrong sure maybe I've got the
[1:04:39] wrong translation here it must be the
[1:04:44] wrong translation because to prove
[1:04:46] ourselves as a ministers of God it must
[1:04:48] first be
[1:04:51] miracles signs wonders and we thank God
[1:04:56] for all of that surely it must be we
[1:05:01] approve ourselves as ministers of God
[1:05:03] were able to preach the word that's not
[1:05:06] what Paul's talking about notice the
[1:05:10] first thing that he mentions be
[1:05:12] approving this word approving is the
[1:05:15] word deal commence which means a coin if
[1:05:21] it says on that coin like the coins that
[1:05:23] we have if it says that amount that's
[1:05:27] truly how much it's worth in those days
[1:05:30] they would have a coin and it had or had
[1:05:32] a weight it had something stamped upon
[1:05:35] it but the men that were doing the coin
[1:05:37] collecting would shave down that point
[1:05:40] and that coin would say something on the
[1:05:44] outside but it didn't have to match on
[1:05:47] the inside what was on the outside and
[1:05:50] Paul said approving our selves as
[1:05:53] ministers of God how Paul in much
[1:05:56] patience in afflictions in necessities
[1:06:00] in de-stresses in stripes in
[1:06:04] imprisonments intimates in Labor's in
[1:06:07] watchings in fastings who can say hey
[1:06:11] and about their thing do you want to be
[1:06:13] a minister anybody out there but you
[1:06:18] know what
[1:06:19] just as it is for the ministers of God
[1:06:22] for the word and the message that comes
[1:06:25] for the messenger of the age there's
[1:06:28] trials that go along to bring forth what
[1:06:32] is there that God is purpose with under
[1:06:35] the ministry of the under shepherds that
[1:06:37] are under the hear God has the trials
[1:06:40] that are so set and for each and every
[1:06:42] one of your lives God has the trials
[1:06:45] that are set because it's all working
[1:06:47] for one purpose one purpose not multiple
[1:06:52] purpose one purpose that Christ himself
[1:06:56] might be glorified and displayed in our
[1:06:59] lives
[1:07:00] you see there's places that your light
[1:07:03] and the glow
[1:07:04] of God the witness like we read in
[1:07:06] Isaiah it'll shine in places that
[1:07:08] somebody else is not there and you might
[1:07:10] look and say hey I'm working here why
[1:07:12] man this department or why I'm here you
[1:07:14] are the light of the world glory of God
[1:07:19] has risen upon thee and the light is
[1:07:22] shining is shining out in this age until
[1:07:26] you talk about in this age friends where
[1:07:28] people have become so Gospel hardening
[1:07:30] and then please forgive me and bear with
[1:07:32] me when I say this there's some things I
[1:07:34] can't blame them for become hardened
[1:07:35] remember what brother Brent said he said
[1:07:38] I'm glad God got ahold of me before the
[1:07:41] religions did he said because I might
[1:07:43] have been an infidel McRaven for reality
[1:07:49] they can see somebody that no matter
[1:07:52] what's going on
[1:07:53] it's easy to be a Christian when things
[1:07:56] are going out but here in the midst of
[1:07:58] this of proving yourselves in patience
[1:08:01] and afflictions and de-stresses in all
[1:08:03] of these things that in itself shows
[1:08:11] there's got to be something deeper
[1:08:13] that's holding this individual it's got
[1:08:16] to be something deeper and then and then
[1:08:18] let's hear what you have to say Paul
[1:08:23] goes on to say here two verses later by
[1:08:26] pureness by knowledge by long-suffering
[1:08:30] by kindness by the Holy Ghost by love
[1:08:34] unfeigned it's not that Paul did not you
[1:08:39] know believe in the Holy Ghost but this
[1:08:41] first part here in much patience and
[1:08:43] afflictions and necessities in distress
[1:08:45] although this wasn't a reality where the
[1:08:49] Holy Ghost had quickened that seed it
[1:08:51] was God that he met face to face it's
[1:08:54] God who held him and even as Paul said
[1:08:57] when I came along you I came not with
[1:09:00] enticing words of man's wisdom that your
[1:09:04] faith would stand in those words but I
[1:09:06] want your faith to stand in the power of
[1:09:08] God oh my we could go on but let me let
[1:09:14] me move forward here
[1:09:16] brother venom you know he tells us in
[1:09:18] three kinds of believers and talks about
[1:09:20] job and he says concerning job he said
[1:09:23] you know job was tried and said I know
[1:09:25] my Redeemer liveth at the last day so
[1:09:27] stand up on the earth though after my
[1:09:28] skin worms destroy smite after my skin
[1:09:31] worms destroy this body yet in my flesh
[1:09:33] shall I see God you cannot annihilate it
[1:09:36] though the skin worms eat it up it still
[1:09:40] will come back again whom I shall see
[1:09:42] for myself
[1:09:43] mine eyes shall behold and not another
[1:09:46] he said job why he was a believer in
[1:09:51] trials he was a believer in persecution
[1:09:56] he was a believer he was a genuine
[1:10:00] believer did joke complain yes but he
[1:10:14] was still a genuine believer did job say
[1:10:18] all the day had been when they had not
[1:10:20] said a man child was born I wish I'd
[1:10:23] have never been born
[1:10:26] sure you know you know that when you
[1:10:29] read the book of Job but God is faithful
[1:10:33] to see us through
[1:10:43] there's not one of us sitting here where
[1:10:46] there's been trials that's come that we
[1:10:48] would say oh no and it's not like we
[1:10:50] weren't we run to every trial ho ho come
[1:10:53] come but he is faithful to see us
[1:11:05] through Paul goes on I love reading
[1:11:09] Paul Paul goes on in second Timothy 3
[1:11:13] verse 10 but thou has fully known
[1:11:16] writing here to Timothy my doctrine
[1:11:18] manner of life purpose faith
[1:11:22] long-suffering charity patience
[1:11:26] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[1:11:29] me at Antioch and Iconium
[1:11:32] and Lystra I want to ask you this
[1:11:33] question
[1:11:35] God you Godhead wrote in his Bible what
[1:11:39] he wanted wrote is that right Paul who
[1:11:43] seen him after his resurrection veiled
[1:11:49] in the pillar of fire and Paul would
[1:11:52] find it necessary to write these things
[1:11:55] to Timothy that this would be made known
[1:11:58] to the Church of the Living God why why
[1:12:02] did God take up space in the Bible with
[1:12:05] this why did God take up space to talk
[1:12:10] about the persecutions to talk about the
[1:12:13] afflictions to talk about and call them
[1:12:15] back to remember Antioch Lystra and
[1:12:18] Iconium why because God also did that
[1:12:24] through the Old Testament you know it
[1:12:28] would be one thing if I want you to
[1:12:31] think of this you and I reading the
[1:12:33] scriptures we we we have that anchor
[1:12:37] within us God is faithful but to think
[1:12:39] how God has so laid it out in his word
[1:12:42] for you and I through where the Bible
[1:12:46] could say in I believe it's in the book
[1:12:48] of Romans Romans 15 through comfort of
[1:12:51] the Scriptures might have hope there
[1:12:58] Joel himself there wasn't even a written
[1:13:01] Bible is that well how did you have well
[1:13:06] we have he knew the Bible that God had
[1:13:10] written in the stars
[1:13:11] it was quickened to joke to be able to
[1:13:15] read that and to read it also in nature
[1:13:19] Paul told us in the book of Romans that
[1:13:21] nature itself declares the Godhead here
[1:13:27] it is all around the reading the Bible
[1:13:30] the reading God gave aware that when
[1:13:33] ministered to them and encouraged them
[1:13:35] in that time to think about in this hour
[1:13:38] that you and I are living in where
[1:13:42] brother Adam tells us in the opening of
[1:13:44] souls in prison now he said I used to
[1:13:46] wonder why it was that Abraham and Sarah
[1:13:50] after that event happening there in
[1:13:52] Genesis 18 how could they go down there
[1:13:54] tell that lie and go into those things
[1:13:56] how could they do it he said but I begin
[1:13:58] to recognize that if it was not for
[1:14:00] those things we would not know the grace
[1:14:04] of God we know God's saving grace but
[1:14:09] let me tell you his grace is not just
[1:14:11] saving grace it is keeping grace what
[1:14:18] didn't have to include those things in
[1:14:19] there God could have had this the Bible
[1:14:21] wrote in such a way to where you and I
[1:14:24] could say oh I can never I can never
[1:14:29] mount up to that I could never God
[1:14:33] didn't have it wrote that way God
[1:14:36] included the weaknesses he allowed that
[1:14:40] let me tell you something God could have
[1:14:43] omitted that he goes like nope too much
[1:14:46] taking up too much space but God's not
[1:14:48] interested in glorying our flesh he is
[1:14:53] glorified through the weakness of our
[1:14:58] flesh
[1:15:05] Paul said persecutions afflictions which
[1:15:08] came unto me at Antioch at Iconium and
[1:15:10] Lystra what persecutions I endured but
[1:15:15] out of them all the Lord delivered me
[1:15:21] was testifying hello and yeah all that
[1:15:29] live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[1:15:33] persecution
[1:15:40] oh cool rabito god
[1:15:43] you know brother banner makes a
[1:15:45] statement and perfect strength of pearly
[1:15:47] weakness this quote has blessed my soul
[1:15:49] over the years you know it's just
[1:15:52] something how the Holy Spirit will bring
[1:15:53] things back to your mind and brother
[1:15:57] brems says when we stand there that day
[1:15:59] he said we will stand beside some of the
[1:16:03] weakest and outcast people of the world
[1:16:08] weakest not strengthened they're all why
[1:16:17] would that be necessary to show that
[1:16:19] it's not by might not by power but by my
[1:16:23] spirit saith the Lord hallelujah God
[1:16:29] testifies we are his witnesses of what
[1:16:33] he has said bill Vanneman message
[1:16:37] jubilee here he says if a man is ever
[1:16:41] born of the Spirit of God not
[1:16:42] make-belief but really filled with God's
[1:16:45] Spirit he sealed him in there till the
[1:16:47] day of his Redemption he will be
[1:16:49] christ-like today he'll be christ-like
[1:16:52] tomorrow he'll be christ-like the next
[1:16:54] day in the trials
[1:16:57] he's christ-like it trebles
[1:17:00] he's christ-like in hunger he's
[1:17:03] christ-like in joy he's christ-like
[1:17:08] everywhere you see him or her they're
[1:17:10] christ-like
[1:17:11] for you're sealed by the Holy Ghost see
[1:17:14] what I mean that's not your spirit who I
[1:17:19] was a head time that's not your spirit
[1:17:24] your spirit gets down my spirit gets
[1:17:28] down my flesh your flesh feels it come
[1:17:33] on somebody when the Prophet was up
[1:17:36] there working on that telephone pole and
[1:17:38] it was weary of what had taken place he
[1:17:41] took the glove off and went to reach
[1:17:44] over is that right he wanted out of that
[1:17:48] the pressure mounting
[1:17:52] God didn't have to include that in the
[1:17:54] message but God included that for you
[1:17:57] and I why because there's more mortals
[1:17:58] more just like you and I those things
[1:18:01] don't make me think less they make me
[1:18:03] think more I thank God that God included
[1:18:06] those I thank God that God and showed
[1:18:08] the humanity of the Prophet he's done it
[1:18:11] all the way through that encourages me
[1:18:16] hallelujah think about this in these
[1:18:20] christ-like nuts your spirit
[1:18:25] that's not your spirit house spirit I'll
[1:18:28] get weary I'll spit here you are you
[1:18:30] complaining I don't know why why and all
[1:18:32] of a sudden here raises up within you
[1:18:35] say lord help me Jesus Lord strengthen
[1:18:41] me Lord forgive me Lord for complaining
[1:18:44] Lord take that Lord I don't don't let
[1:18:47] anything set in my heart Lord
[1:18:49] take it away Lord what I just love you
[1:18:51] to you you find yourself in the midst of
[1:18:53] you say that sounds like a war that's
[1:18:55] going on it is it is it is brother
[1:19:01] member says when you've been born again
[1:19:02] there now is a constant war
[1:19:05] [Applause]
[1:19:08] amen praise the Lord thank God little
[1:19:12] Samuel constant war because you know I'm
[1:19:15] not what I used to be I'm in resistance
[1:19:21] against that shall we see our weaknesses
[1:19:26] sure we see the time sure you and you
[1:19:28] and I both we've come into situations
[1:19:30] I'm done and you can see some money down
[1:19:32] down you can talk to him on the phone or
[1:19:33] here and there down you know what
[1:19:35] there's not anything I don't look at
[1:19:36] somebody when they're down and say how
[1:19:38] can they be down I've been down as well
[1:19:40] but I have confidence in the Living God
[1:19:43] that lives on the inside of them lives
[1:19:45] on the inside of me that that God will
[1:19:47] also lift them up because why the Bible
[1:19:51] is very clear he restoreth my soul
[1:19:56] nay though I walk through the valley of
[1:20:01] the shadow of death if it's a shadow
[1:20:04] that's gotta be light present and if
[1:20:07] light is present light is there to guide
[1:20:10] me through all the way yea though I walk
[1:20:12] through the valley of the shadow death I
[1:20:15] will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:20:22] hallelujah I'm talking about comfort
[1:20:26] tonight through through Jesus said it
[1:20:33] like this when he was asking them who do
[1:20:37] you say I am who do men say that I am
[1:20:39] Peter here that that seed rises up and
[1:20:43] says thou art the Christ the Son of the
[1:20:46] Living God and Jesus said upon this rock
[1:20:48] I'll build my church and the gates of
[1:20:51] Hell shall not prevail against him when
[1:20:55] he made that statement he already was
[1:20:58] declaring the gates of Hell are going to
[1:21:00] be against it and let me tell you
[1:21:03] something the gates of hell is every one
[1:21:07] of them powers Satan's Trinity the
[1:21:09] demonic powers religious powers and
[1:21:12] political powers that Trinity devil
[1:21:15] works all around has it moves it trying
[1:21:18] to bring pressure the gates of Hell
[1:21:23] shall not prevail they might come
[1:21:27] against you you know what gates are you
[1:21:29] know what they do a gates don't you
[1:21:30] think of in the Old Testament gates are
[1:21:33] where transactions take place is that
[1:21:36] right
[1:21:37] when Boaz what did he have to do go to
[1:21:39] the gate of the elder right when they
[1:21:43] ascended up on high he led captivity
[1:21:45] candidate open up you gates Lord Jesus
[1:21:52] how long you're going on that tonight
[1:21:55] gates of hell shall not prevail when
[1:21:58] they come against you in there try to
[1:22:00] get you and try to bring your side of
[1:22:02] disease or whatever it might be but yet
[1:22:05] God is a
[1:22:06] understand right there and with his
[1:22:08] precious blood God's got anointed
[1:22:10] ministry God's got brothers and his
[1:22:12] brothers and sisters he's got different
[1:22:14] ones and with him prayer the prayer of
[1:22:16] faith there is a transaction that is
[1:22:19] made at the gate and the devil is
[1:22:21] stripped of that power and that
[1:22:23] authority because he's already defeated
[1:22:25] the gates of Hell shall not prevail
[1:22:31] hallelujah glory be to God sin against
[1:22:37] you just like real RAM tells us he said
[1:22:39] in present stage of my ministry he said
[1:22:42] there were prophets that rose up and
[1:22:43] prophesied concerning this work he said
[1:22:45] and they bros up in prophesied
[1:22:47] concerning Branham Tabernacle they said
[1:22:50] it will be a garage in six months time
[1:22:53] brother Branham said they look at it
[1:22:55] today he said his own fire for God he
[1:23:01] said you know what it is the gates of
[1:23:03] Hell come against it but they could not
[1:23:05] take it you know why because he knew the
[1:23:11] prophets could prophesy and say look
[1:23:13] this is going to be a failure in six
[1:23:15] months and this is going to happen to
[1:23:16] one more but you know what to one who
[1:23:18] knows where he's standing he don't
[1:23:20] matter all the chatter that goes on you
[1:23:23] know where you're standing and you're
[1:23:25] garnering your strength from the Lord
[1:23:28] for a beat of God upon this rock I'll
[1:23:32] build my church and the gates of Hell
[1:23:35] shall not be able to prevail hallelujah
[1:23:39] this is where God and let it be known in
[1:23:42] his word familiar place of Scripture
[1:23:45] first Corinthians Paul admonishes us
[1:23:47] he's lets us know that that temptation
[1:23:50] that trial that God has allowed to come
[1:23:53] our way he's gonna make him make a way
[1:23:55] of escape that we might be able to bear
[1:23:58] it
[1:23:59] bro Graham said when I heard the pastor
[1:24:02] say this morning in a second handed robe
[1:24:03] many are becoming discouraged what we
[1:24:06] need brother is to take courage what we
[1:24:08] need is to be encouraged trials may come
[1:24:12] we never was promised to be immune from
[1:24:15] them but he will give grace to go
[1:24:19] through
[1:24:19] them if the mountains too hot to go over
[1:24:24] too deep to go under now you know
[1:24:27] sometimes but the dud you're gonna have
[1:24:29] to go over the mountain if it's too high
[1:24:36] Lord I don't know if I can make it over
[1:24:38] that mountain God said come on we're
[1:24:41] gonna climb it we're gonna ascend this
[1:24:44] mountain then some months you look at it
[1:24:49] Lord it's just way too high and that's
[1:24:51] what he wants you to say and you would
[1:24:56] say it's too hot and he says look
[1:24:58] there's a way around it the Lord I'm
[1:25:04] trying to get from here to here but
[1:25:06] doesn't I need to take you around this
[1:25:08] way because there are experiences around
[1:25:11] this way that are tailored for you so if
[1:25:17] it's too high
[1:25:18] or it's too wide where is too high to go
[1:25:21] over there's too wide to go around oh he
[1:25:26] will give you grace to go through it go
[1:25:33] through it but brother Brown was talking
[1:25:37] about the black minister see don't you
[1:25:42] believe that boy I sure do
[1:25:43] he said I haven't believe what's wrote
[1:25:45] on the cover Holy Bible
[1:25:47] the man said Jones what if God told
[1:25:51] Judah goes junk through that brick wall
[1:25:53] would you do it
[1:25:54] he said sure would he said Jones how in
[1:25:57] the world there ain't no home there is
[1:25:59] that if God told me to do it by the time
[1:26:01] I got there there'd be whole
[1:26:03] [Laughter]
[1:26:06] hello well repeat 'god what's that doing
[1:26:10] that's putting God's Word first that's
[1:26:12] what Joshua did at the River Jordan
[1:26:15] he put God's Word first whoo
[1:26:20] glory he will give greats to go through
[1:26:23] it that's right
[1:26:24] just don't worry they help me Lord just
[1:26:31] don't worry but keep your eyes on Christ
[1:26:34] so that lets me know with this statement
[1:26:37] how do I deal with that and overcome
[1:26:39] even and that worries just don't worry
[1:26:41] keep your eyes on Christ so look to him
[1:26:45] in this and he will see through for he's
[1:26:49] the only one that can take us through
[1:26:51] you see these trials they're instruments
[1:26:54] of his molding remember when the Lord
[1:26:55] Jesus we referred to this here over a
[1:26:57] few weeks when he said let this cup pass
[1:27:00] from me it was personal
[1:27:03] only he this trial was only him and we
[1:27:08] see that he could have called even when
[1:27:12] he was there on the cross he could have
[1:27:14] called
[1:27:14] there were legions right there right
[1:27:17] there Dane's was all gathered around he
[1:27:21] testified of that I would have had to
[1:27:23] done think of this all he would have had
[1:27:27] their done is summons they would have
[1:27:31] come but you see he was submitted
[1:27:36] to the will of the father brother Bram
[1:27:43] takes this part up and three kinds of
[1:27:45] believers brother Branham you know when
[1:27:47] you you go back over that message three
[1:27:49] kinds of believers because you know I've
[1:27:50] been preaching out of that for me many
[1:27:52] months now on trials brother Bentham
[1:27:55] lays that out within their on the
[1:27:56] believers and what he deals with is that
[1:27:59] loyalty of the heart and he shows he
[1:28:03] shows that the believers walking within
[1:28:07] that word steadfast through the midst of
[1:28:09] all the testing all the trials you've
[1:28:14] got something to do brother BEM saying
[1:28:16] God's got something for you to do you
[1:28:18] may have some heartaches and some
[1:28:20] troubles you may have some
[1:28:21] disappointments in better ahead
[1:28:22] disappointments
[1:28:25] what are disappointments their
[1:28:27] disappointments things that you wanted
[1:28:31] to have a certain way or expected
[1:28:32] episode way and it didn't yeah
[1:28:35] disappointments but do we pray to shun
[1:28:40] them no but here's how we pray Lord take
[1:28:47] me through them whatever they is
[1:28:51] whatever it is don't let me escape that
[1:28:57] Wow trying on praying about the track
[1:29:01] the Lord don't let me escape them why
[1:29:04] because these trials are given to
[1:29:08] perfect you and I and to bring out the
[1:29:12] purpose of God to a more clear reality
[1:29:14] you say well if the purpose of God is
[1:29:17] already in me what do the trials do the
[1:29:20] trials are melding you down that Christ
[1:29:22] might come forward if they're set for me
[1:29:29] see that if they're set from me just
[1:29:33] give me grace to go through that that's
[1:29:36] all brother Branham says concerning this
[1:29:40] we all know about the the trial the
[1:29:42] tests that brother Branham went through
[1:29:44] libram says I think of my wife I think I
[1:29:47] included this yeah I did I think of my
[1:29:49] wife twenty-two years old
[1:29:50] and just merely a girl a little mother
[1:29:53] there when the papers gave a headline
[1:29:54] here a young mother Reverend just dies
[1:29:58] what think of this I was reading over
[1:30:00] this I saw and this never had dawned on
[1:30:03] me before not only did he have to endure
[1:30:06] of seeing this but then a newspaper
[1:30:09] headline come out you with me a
[1:30:13] newspaper headline you you you try to
[1:30:16] walk in a restaurant they even have the
[1:30:18] newspapers out in front of you you walk
[1:30:21] by this headline was out there you're
[1:30:29] telling me that God didn't allow Satan
[1:30:31] to put that headline out there that's
[1:30:34] part of the test as well after it's all
[1:30:37] done then you have this headline oh how
[1:30:42] my heart bled I didn't know what to do
[1:30:46] but today look at this I know it was all
[1:30:50] working for my good it was one who came
[1:30:54] through and he wasn't standing there
[1:30:56] bitter I know the life had to be ground
[1:31:00] and twisted and squeezed to get what in
[1:31:04] it was out there was too much what's
[1:31:09] that say Branum
[1:31:11] too much Branham in there had to be
[1:31:16] squeezed out before God could make
[1:31:18] himself known
[1:31:20] you can put your last name in there I
[1:31:23] can put my last name in there was too
[1:31:27] much of it and God had to squeeze that
[1:31:30] out true there was too much of you in
[1:31:36] you till God had to squeeze it out
[1:31:39] through trials and while that squeezing
[1:31:41] was coming on it's hard but after a
[1:31:44] while the skeered the skies clear back
[1:31:47] then you see the purpose of God I know
[1:31:51] my Redeemer liveth in it goes on had me
[1:31:56] squeezed out too much browning
[1:32:00] something like he's gonna call me next
[1:32:02] all of you too much too much of you in
[1:32:08] you and he had to squeeze it out you see
[1:32:17] look how the Prophet is speaking of this
[1:32:19] look I was speaking of it he receives
[1:32:22] this it was all for the purpose of God
[1:32:26] within his life God allowed him to make
[1:32:33] the decision to listen to his
[1:32:34] mother-in-law you see even within the
[1:32:37] decision but notice look how the
[1:32:38] sovereignty of God is working the
[1:32:42] sovereignty of God is working in
[1:32:45] everything to do what think of this this
[1:32:49] event that happened way back there it
[1:32:53] prepared him listen to me now that event
[1:32:57] prepared him along with others to be
[1:33:00] able to stand there in the third pool in
[1:33:04] the opening of the word and stand there
[1:33:07] and say many of my friends have left me
[1:33:10] many have deserted me all of those
[1:33:13] experiences even that in Africa remember
[1:33:15] with the amoeba all of those were
[1:33:18] experiences preparing him you know I say
[1:33:20] well if that was in his life
[1:33:22] why didn't just come out God has his way
[1:33:25] of bringing out what is in us and tests
[1:33:29] and trials reduce the flesh missus why
[1:33:36] James could say blessed is the man that
[1:33:37] endureth temptation for when he is tried
[1:33:41] he shall receive the crown of life which
[1:33:43] the Lord had promised to them that love
[1:33:44] him
[1:33:45] look how Paul makes mention this in 2nd
[1:33:47] Thessalonians chapter 1 verse 3 I'm
[1:33:50] coming down we are bound to think God
[1:33:53] always for you brethren as it is me
[1:33:55] because that your faith groweth
[1:33:58] exceedingly and the charity of every one
[1:34:02] of you all toward each other aboundeth
[1:34:05] so that we ourselves glory in you in the
[1:34:09] Churches of God
[1:34:12] for your patience and faith Paul didn't
[1:34:20] say we're glorying in the Churches of
[1:34:22] God because there's no other Church that
[1:34:24] has more signs and wonders and miracles
[1:34:27] Paul said we're glorying in other
[1:34:29] churches where we went
[1:34:31] we're testifying of the patience and the
[1:34:34] faith in your lives because with
[1:34:39] patience and faith hey the signs and
[1:34:41] wonders miracles they're there they're
[1:34:44] there and they'll be there when we have
[1:34:48] need of it
[1:34:51] in all for your patience and faith in
[1:34:55] all your persecutions and tribulations
[1:34:57] that ye endure
[1:35:07] remember how brother branham in the
[1:35:09] message he talks about garnet peak where
[1:35:14] he preaches the message he preaches
[1:35:15] garnets funeral service and he titles I
[1:35:18] am the resurrection or life the RAM
[1:35:21] talks about there's so much within that
[1:35:22] message when you listen to the
[1:35:23] conversations that brother Branham
[1:35:25] shares between him and garnet peak
[1:35:27] brother Branham took so much from those
[1:35:31] moments his lone life brother brems own
[1:35:32] life he said my life it was just
[1:35:34] challenged by that you can take that
[1:35:36] from that message and brother Branham he
[1:35:38] makes this statement he says I can
[1:35:40] remember how that garnet you know garnet
[1:35:43] one of the things garnet you know with
[1:35:45] that with with the disease that he had
[1:35:48] you know his arms and limbs and things
[1:35:50] like that had to be kind of lifted up
[1:35:52] like that even brother Branham would
[1:35:54] talk about my mind I was I want to say
[1:35:58] it right now my mind I forgot its sister
[1:36:02] had he had he writes sister what was her
[1:36:05] name anybody remember that was the Edith
[1:36:06] Edith remember how even you see pictures
[1:36:09] of Edith and how Edith was and brother
[1:36:12] Branham was even admiring the testimony
[1:36:15] of faith in her life in the condition
[1:36:19] that she was in yet the testimony of
[1:36:22] faith
[1:36:24] and brother branham is talking about
[1:36:25] garnet peak right here in the same way
[1:36:28] now garnet you know he brother branham
[1:36:31] asked him he said garnet he said what if
[1:36:34] you could have your life and get out of
[1:36:35] it he was an 18 year old boy he said one
[1:36:38] of you could get on here and run up and
[1:36:39] down the street in a race car and up and
[1:36:41] down there and you know girls and
[1:36:42] everything else he said brother branham
[1:36:44] I wouldn't trade one place where I'm at
[1:36:50] now to be there it was a love of his
[1:36:56] life brother brems says he was an
[1:37:00] example to in that second pair he was an
[1:37:02] example to for me of his patience never
[1:37:08] to complain just the will of God be done
[1:37:14] now has placed him before Sanada has
[1:37:16] taken him out of our president I don't
[1:37:18] think about that even how garnet was
[1:37:20] there garnet was a product of receiving
[1:37:25] the message of the Lord Jesus Christ he
[1:37:29] was a product of receiving the Lord
[1:37:32] Jesus Christ think of this now Paul
[1:37:34] could say you're the seal of mine
[1:37:36] Apostleship to be able to look in to see
[1:37:39] that word has produced even in garnets
[1:37:42] life and brother Brahma as he's looking
[1:37:43] at he says for me it's an example of his
[1:37:48] patience God never healed him of that as
[1:37:54] far as in this life and yet he and
[1:37:58] brother Branham were friends think about
[1:38:03] that even the sister who was in the
[1:38:07] wheelchair for the RAM talks about it
[1:38:08] and power transformation and he commends
[1:38:11] he said how many times a prayer has been
[1:38:13] made over the sister ease of it perhaps
[1:38:15] you know it's just the place in life
[1:38:18] but you see God and God has testimonies
[1:38:21] witnesses that said it don't matter if I
[1:38:24] could walk or not he's still God he had
[1:38:28] testimonies right here with garnet it
[1:38:30] got gone it didn't have to be made well
[1:38:33] in this life to have a testimony he had
[1:38:36] a testimony that in afflictions in
[1:38:38] de-stresses and all of this he was
[1:38:41] patient I look around here tonight you
[1:38:47] know I think about this I thought about
[1:38:49] this you know for months and you see
[1:38:51] different ones and you know and you see
[1:38:53] just the testimony in each and each life
[1:38:56] in each heart
[1:38:57] I'd say sometimes you don't what you
[1:38:58] don't realize is as a pastor what an
[1:39:02] encouragement that is see sometimes
[1:39:06] people don't know everything that you've
[1:39:07] been through and it's not like I know
[1:39:09] everything that you've been through but
[1:39:11] I do know perhaps more than others know
[1:39:15] but then yet to see is standing faithful
[1:39:19] to see all of that you know one
[1:39:22] encouragement that is I mean what if we
[1:39:29] came in here it was a changeover all the
[1:39:31] time you know what if it was a turnover
[1:39:35] all the time I'm looking to say man I
[1:39:37] wonder what's happening when was the
[1:39:40] word having an effect but to see a word
[1:39:45] that's moving and building in the hearts
[1:39:49] of the people how many the things that
[1:39:54] you might think all those I mean literal
[1:39:56] me are little in just literal you but to
[1:40:00] see the testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:40:04] holding in the midst when some you've
[1:40:09] gone through some of the greatest
[1:40:11] greatest greatest trials in your life
[1:40:14] maybe of going through one right now but
[1:40:17] yet to see within at all
[1:40:20] patience in afflictions in de-stresses
[1:40:26] hey the is the kind of people I want to
[1:40:31] say come pray for me pray from me
[1:40:35] brother
[1:40:35] pray for me sister brother brems talks
[1:40:40] about in Jesus at the door I love this
[1:40:42] quote I am done but brother Graham says
[1:40:45] isn't it a grand feeling to know that
[1:40:49] God's grace has carried some of you here
[1:40:52] through twenty and thirty years of
[1:40:57] trials and persecutions it that
[1:41:02] wonderful through it's a grand what
[1:41:05] makes it a grand feeling because you
[1:41:07] know that it's not you that kept you
[1:41:10] it's God keeping you through many
[1:41:18] dangers toils and snares I have already
[1:41:21] come
[1:41:23] here's Grace has brought me safe thus
[1:41:25] far
[1:41:26] and here's grace will take me safely
[1:41:30] home God did that for you it shows that
[1:41:36] you're a real child of God and he has
[1:41:39] taken you into fellowship some day in
[1:41:41] the face of all that's criticized you
[1:41:44] you'll be glorified and made a body like
[1:41:47] unto his own glorious body at his coming
[1:41:50] and we wait for that blessed a grand
[1:41:57] feeling he had begun the good work in
[1:42:01] you in me we will perform it to the day
[1:42:08] of Jesus Christ we are his witnesses
[1:42:16] through through the waters through the
[1:42:20] rivers through the fire through the test
[1:42:24] through the trials His grace is
[1:42:28] sufficient you loved him tonight let's
[1:42:36] pray
