[34:50] brother i know that you'll be blessed by

[34:56] and we also have
[34:58] communion next sunday as well and i want
[35:00] to just just a few moments here just to
[35:03] mention a few things to you
[35:05] there's been some things that over
[35:07] the years even my dad and i had talked
[35:09] about at times
[35:11] and there were some things we wanted to
[35:13] make a change and i talked with the
[35:15] deacons here even some years ago
[35:17] and i told them i said i felt like this
[35:19] is a moment to make that change
[35:21] that is
[35:23] and let me just give you just a few
[35:24] moments
[35:26] instead of having just a single cup
[35:28] right up here we're going to have the
[35:30] trays
[35:31] with every individual cup now
[35:36] i have to say it you know i don't have
[35:38] any other words but
[35:40] sometimes we can be very dogmatic about
[35:42] things
[35:45] and the way that you know it's a
[35:47] dogmatic it doesn't allow you to move
[35:48] into
[35:50] other areas
[35:52] and it's binding
[35:54] but i want to say this to you
[35:56] it's coming out of one vessel
[35:59] it's coming out of one vessel
[36:02] it's coming out of one vessel and going
[36:04] into every one of those cubs and to say
[36:06] it like this
[36:07] i you know you know me very well you
[36:10] know the church here as well i take my
[36:12] cues also from how god directed his
[36:15] prophet and brother branham
[36:17] brought that right into the tabernacle
[36:19] right there
[36:21] and i tell you the angel of the lord
[36:23] must have not had a problem with it
[36:25] either because if you remember the
[36:27] testimony
[36:29] when they ran out of wine
[36:31] they ran out of wine in a communion
[36:32] service they did in a lot for everybody
[36:34] was going to be there
[36:35] and the brother came to brother branham
[36:37] you know he's standing right there
[36:38] serving he says what are we going to do
[36:40] we ran out of wine
[36:42] let's just pray
[36:44] let's just pray and he said as we were
[36:47] praying he said i couldn't help but he
[36:48] said i had to peek a little bit and he
[36:51] said i watched wine rise from the bottom
[36:53] of those cups
[36:55] [Applause]
[36:58] we're talking about the word
[37:00] of the living god
[37:02] we're talking about the word of the
[37:04] living god that would speak
[37:06] where there should not be any squirrels
[37:10] and squirrels came
[37:12] let me tell you that wasn't talking
[37:14] about squirrels that was talking about
[37:15] me and you
[37:17] where they could have looked in our life
[37:19] and thought what good could come out of
[37:21] that life
[37:22] that you let the word be spoken over
[37:24] that life
[37:25] not a squirrel that comes out every but
[37:27] a son and daughter of god comes out of
[37:29] that
[37:31] that's the power of this word
[37:34] the living word of god because it's not
[37:36] a man's word
[37:38] it's god's word it's god vindicating his
[37:40] word god watching over it so
[37:42] i just wanted to share that with you
[37:45] lord willing and i don't i don't have a
[37:47] time
[37:49] for the service you know we don't do
[37:50] that as far as the community we'll just
[37:52] try to do it right after we finish the
[37:54] morning service
[37:55] because i have to get brother carmen
[37:57] from here
[37:58] and um he's got to fly out from there
[38:01] and go on in his trip but he just he
[38:04] wanted to stop by for fellowship and i

[41:05] joshua chapter one
[41:08] and we'll thank you musicians
[41:10] i want to read
[41:13] a few verses of scripture here if you
[41:15] wouldn't mind i'd like to read the first
[41:16] 11 verses together
[41:19] and then we'll let you
[41:20] be seated
[41:24] now after the death of moses the servant
[41:26] of the lord it came to pass that the
[41:28] lord spake
[41:29] unto joshua
[41:31] the son of none
[41:33] moses minister saying
[41:35] moses my servant is dead
[41:39] now therefore arise
[41:41] go over this jordan thou
[41:44] and all this people unto the land which
[41:47] i do give thee even to the children of
[41:49] israel
[41:51] every place
[41:52] that the soul of your foot shall tread
[41:55] upon
[41:57] that
[41:58] i
[41:59] that have i given unto you as i said
[42:02] unto moses
[42:03] from the wilderness and this lebanon
[42:06] even unto the great river the river
[42:08] euphrates and all the land of the
[42:10] hittites and unto the great sea toward
[42:12] the going down of the sun shall be your
[42:14] coast
[42:15] there shall not any man be able to stand
[42:18] before thee all the days of thy life
[42:21] as i was with moses
[42:24] so i will be with thee
[42:26] i will not fail thee
[42:28] nor for safety
[42:30] be strong and of a good courage for unto
[42:33] this people
[42:34] shalt thou divide for an inheritance the
[42:36] land which i swear unto their fathers to
[42:39] give them
[42:40] only be thou strong
[42:43] and very courageous
[42:45] that thou mayest observe
[42:47] to do according
[42:49] to all the law
[42:51] which moses my servant commanded thee
[42:55] i want you to notice that verse
[42:58] turn not from it to the right hand or to
[43:01] the left
[43:02] that thou mayest prosper whether soever
[43:06] thou goest
[43:07] this book of the law shall not depart
[43:11] out of thy mouth
[43:13] but thou shalt meditate therein day and
[43:16] night
[43:17] that thou mayest observe to do according
[43:20] to all
[43:22] that is written therein
[43:24] for then
[43:25] thou shalt make thy way prosperous
[43:29] and then thou shalt have
[43:32] good success
[43:34] i want you to notice in verse 8
[43:36] it's tied the prospered prospering way
[43:41] and good success
[43:42] is tied to observing the word that god
[43:46] has spoke through his servant the
[43:49] prophet
[43:50] don't turn from it to the left or right
[43:52] just stay right with it or i may not
[43:54] understand stay right with it
[43:57] and as you stay with it
[43:59] don't let the word depart out of your
[44:01] mouth
[44:03] you're ordained to be a spokesman of the
[44:07] word in this hour
[44:09] you know you can tell what a person
[44:11] feeds on by what they talk about
[44:14] now you know it doesn't mean like
[44:16] brother dave and i can get out there on
[44:17] the boat and we go fishing and he starts
[44:19] talking about you know the lake like
[44:21] it's interstates and things but it's not
[44:24] that's not very long at all he doesn't
[44:26] we don't even talk about that very long
[44:27] right away then he starts going right
[44:29] into talking about things of of the lord
[44:32] we start fellowshipping on it
[44:34] sometimes when i've ran into brother
[44:36] joey out here in the parking lot it
[44:38] don't stay too long on deer
[44:40] we'd all like to have a
[44:43] good size
[44:45] but it very quickly turns to you know
[44:46] what i was hearing the other day
[44:48] you know what i was listening to the
[44:49] other day
[44:50] it turns to the word of god that's the
[44:52] he's the theme of our life
[44:55] it's him that sets everything else in
[44:57] order in our life now notice verse 9
[45:00] have not i commanded thee be strong and
[45:02] of a good courage be not afraid
[45:05] neither be thou dismayed for the lord
[45:08] thy god is with thee
[45:10] whether so ever thou goest
[45:12] then joshua commanded the officers of
[45:14] the people saying pass through the host
[45:16] and command the people saying prepare
[45:19] you victims for within three days ye
[45:23] shall pass over this jordan there's no
[45:25] uncertainty in that
[45:27] in three days you shall pass over this
[45:30] jordan
[45:31] to go in to possess the land which the
[45:33] lord your god giveth you to possess it
[45:37] amen may god add the blessing to the
[45:39] word as you're being seated
[45:41] let me just refer to this quote and then
[45:43] i'll give you my title here this morning
[45:46] i actually thought i was going to be if
[45:48] i had to win according to last week and
[45:50] the way the inspiration had flowed into
[45:52] those parts there and where we were
[45:53] already at i would have i was already
[45:56] under the mindset and the set i'm going
[45:58] into a further part that god had other
[46:01] plans
[46:02] so i want to come back into a i read you
[46:05] this quote to start
[46:08] last week's service
[46:10] on the gathering unto him
[46:13] and we were dealing with the part of how
[46:16] that in this hour
[46:18] god has promised
[46:20] another ephesians
[46:23] just as he did a coming out of of egypt
[46:26] and into the promised land in going into
[46:29] the promised land is going into the
[46:31] ephesians because redemption's in two
[46:34] parts
[46:35] then coming then when here
[46:38] john the baptist stood there was an
[46:40] announcement of another ephesians that
[46:44] was coming to the church of the living
[46:46] god
[46:47] and we seen that example in the life of
[46:50] the lord jesus and there were believers
[46:52] that went on
[46:54] into the upper room and they came into
[46:57] their position they had in ephesians
[47:00] and now at the end of of the church ages
[47:04] and you recognize that the seven church
[47:07] ages that was all a mystery god calling
[47:10] out a gentile bride
[47:12] the jews were blinded paul lays that out
[47:15] so clearly in romans they were blinded
[47:17] for our sake
[47:19] daniel didn't see that that that that
[47:22] space of time where god would be dealing
[47:26] with the gentiles
[47:27] it was very much of how paul would write
[47:29] of it a hidden mystery
[47:31] it was the mystery of god which the
[47:33] mystery of god is
[47:35] the god's own life the holy spirit
[47:38] coming in the life of the believer and
[47:40] quickening that seed and bringing forth
[47:43] the son and daughter of god that was a
[47:45] mystery but you see when it was given in
[47:48] the time that it was to be announced and
[47:50] to come forth god
[47:52] already has this planned out he had a
[47:54] vessel by the name of paul who was
[47:57] chosen who was ordained even against his
[48:00] own will but he was set aside and he
[48:03] surrendered his will and god brought
[48:05] forth the announcement to the gentiles
[48:08] and there it opens to you and i
[48:10] in this even in the time that we're
[48:12] living in showing god in his season it's
[48:16] god that unfolds his word when it's time
[48:18] for that word to be made manifest
[48:21] and there are people just as much as
[48:23] there's a messenger there are people who
[48:26] are called by god to receive that word
[48:30] to receive that life and manifest that
[48:33] word
[48:34] and walk by it when victory
[48:37] that's all god's doing this is god's
[48:39] arrangement it's not our arrangement
[48:42] so when we see this this ephesians
[48:46] and you recognize the scripture that we
[48:48] are are looking at here in joshua 1
[48:51] god is giving such
[48:54] assurance to joshua this is not a pep
[48:57] rally he's letting joshua know
[49:00] moses my servant is dead now it's time
[49:03] to go over this jordan and remember
[49:06] moses was a type of the law
[49:09] moses was a type because remember of
[49:11] what when thou shalt do this and do this
[49:14] and do this and they were blessed as
[49:16] long as they heeded to it but the law
[49:19] could never take them into the promised
[49:22] land
[49:23] and i'm just saying in this way it's
[49:26] wonderful for a life that can look into
[49:28] god's word and this says god says do
[49:31] this and i do this but the difference is
[49:34] when you do it out of fear and i'm
[49:36] talking about slavish fear
[49:39] not reverential fear
[49:41] slavish fear is where well if i don't do
[49:43] this i'm going to go to hell and if i
[49:45] don't do this and i've got god doesn't
[49:48] god you can't operate as a son and
[49:50] daughter of god under that fear that's a
[49:52] tormenting fear
[49:53] but you see there's a place you can come
[49:56] to to where it's reverential fear and
[49:58] reverential theories that's where the
[50:00] bible says the fear of the lord is clean
[50:03] you're obeying it because this is what
[50:05] god said to do
[50:07] so it's not i'm afraid of going to hell
[50:09] it's how god even deals with the life in
[50:11] the beginning you're not you don't do it
[50:13] out of fear of oh if i don't do this
[50:15] god's gonna get mad at me god god can't
[50:18] move in that way but you do it because
[50:20] you recognize it's the love of god his
[50:23] grace that would even come to you and i
[50:26] and chasten us correct us direct us into
[50:29] that place that he himself steps down
[50:33] and takes us into the promise
[50:37] so
[50:38] we are in an ephesians right now and
[50:40] that ephesians that we're in remember
[50:43] the first ephesians or first exodus was
[50:46] a coming out of a natural land going
[50:48] into a natural land the land of canaan
[50:51] then there was the second ephesians
[50:53] coming out of the natural land of canaan
[50:56] and going into the baptism of the holy
[50:58] ghost the spiritual land where all the
[51:01] promises lay with the for the believer
[51:05] and in this hour we are called from that
[51:08] spiritual land first coming into the
[51:10] holy ghost then through there we are
[51:13] directed into my father's house our many
[51:17] mansions in other words the promise from
[51:19] the baptism of the holy ghost the person
[51:22] of christ among us we are in an
[51:25] expectation of the rapture
[51:30] what all the ages and all the rest have
[51:32] looked for and longed for we are in that
[51:36] ephesians
[51:37] then ephesians to where that there are
[51:40] sons and daughters of god where the
[51:42] earth has been groaning and travailing
[51:45] and waiting for the manifestation of the
[51:48] sons and daughters of god
[51:50] you see the earth is a redeemable
[51:52] attribute it's longing to come back into
[51:55] its position but he knows it cannot come
[51:57] back to his position before the sons of
[52:00] god come back to their position
[52:02] everything must operate in its position
[52:05] you see what a blessing it is if we get
[52:08] out of position then we cannot expect
[52:10] other things to come in position but if
[52:13] we'll stay in position then we can look
[52:16] to god who puts everything else in
[52:19] position when it needs to be put in
[52:21] position
[52:23] oh my what a rest
[52:27] joshua could say but what if i fail
[52:30] as i was with moses
[52:33] so will i be with thee
[52:36] i don't want you walking around and
[52:38] timing this i i don't want you walking
[52:40] around looking over your shoulder and
[52:42] wondering i don't want you doing that i
[52:44] want you to understand joshua that
[52:47] there's going to be mistakes you'll make
[52:49] you will fail
[52:51] but my grace is sufficient
[52:54] [Applause]
[52:56] oh my
[52:57] if joshua could have only seen ahead of
[52:59] time of even certain decisions that he
[53:02] would make when he got into the land and
[53:05] certain things that he could kind of
[53:07] look at and say you guys look legitimate
[53:09] old clothes and motherly bread and you
[53:11] guys look all right you look legitimate
[53:13] but see never never never go by the
[53:16] feelings or how something looks he was
[53:19] charged joshua was charged take it back
[53:22] to the word is that right so how is it
[53:26] to be divided take it back to the word
[53:29] and the joshua in this hour it
[53:31] represents the end time ministry of the
[53:34] spirit of truth the lord jesus christ
[53:37] right here among his believing children
[53:40] oh my we can just bang bring that
[53:42] direction and just let our thoughts be
[53:44] so aligned with the word of god now when
[53:47] we look at this here brother branham
[53:49] would say it in this manner in the
[53:51] message the paradox he says you know if
[53:54] they
[53:55] men and people are always you know when
[53:57] they think about divine healing
[53:59] some work of grace they always think
[54:02] that there's something they have to do
[54:03] and i want you to listen very carefully
[54:05] they always think there's something they
[54:07] have to do
[54:08] you there is nothing you have to do but
[54:11] believe
[54:13] just believe god
[54:16] and and if they would have continued on
[54:18] talking about israel in their march
[54:20] coming to that of the land the promise
[54:22] wasn't given under the law the promise
[54:24] was given before the law without any
[54:27] conditions to it i've given you this
[54:29] land go on over into it but before they
[54:31] got to that promise they decided there
[54:34] was something that they must do
[54:38] themselves
[54:40] and that we still find that among human
[54:42] beings we're prone to be that way
[54:47] there's something we've got to do
[54:50] in other words or we feel like we got to
[54:51] make something happen
[54:54] oh it just don't seem like it's going
[54:56] the way it ought to be going and oh we
[54:58] need to be doing this
[54:59] why are you panicking
[55:02] are you panicking god has spoken who can
[55:05] but prophesy
[55:07] we are to look we are a people that are
[55:09] to look with the full expectation for
[55:12] god to come according to his word
[55:17] is that right
[55:19] so you see he says we're prone to be
[55:21] that way there's something we've got to
[55:23] do we feel that and we've got to have
[55:25] something into it also
[55:27] listen
[55:28] you do have something into it
[55:31] that's your surrender of your own will
[55:35] and your own ideas
[55:37] everybody say surrender
[55:40] or if we only had the white flags
[55:46] here's what you surrender to we're
[55:48] surrendering
[55:50] to the will and idea of almighty god
[55:54] and it's finished
[55:57] that's all there is just take his
[55:59] promise don't think nothing don't think
[56:02] of nothing else walk by it and god
[56:06] does the rest of it
[56:10] it's surrendering this whole land of
[56:12] promise
[56:13] when you take the whole account of that
[56:16] of joshua
[56:18] god asks them to do things that doesn't
[56:21] make sense to the natural mind
[56:27] but god does it that way to show and
[56:30] prove that he's god
[56:33] let me just say it to you in this way
[56:34] god isn't interested in trying to make
[56:37] sense
[56:39] are you hearing me
[56:41] if you're trying to make sense of god
[56:42] and put him all in and figure it all out
[56:45] you'll never be able to do it
[56:47] because you can't put him in a box he is
[56:49] the god of his word
[56:53] and we know him by faith now let me just
[56:55] say what i'm going to speak on here and
[56:57] really taking off the thoughts where we
[56:59] were kind of looking last week but i
[57:01] want to speak a little a little part
[57:03] here god's business is not your business
[57:08] god's business is not your business
[57:11] you see in the book of john chapter 6
[57:14] they ask the question what shall we do
[57:17] that we may work the works of god
[57:19] and jesus told him he said you are to
[57:23] believe on him whom he hath sent that's
[57:27] the work of god because once you believe
[57:30] the messenger what he's saying and
[57:32] recognize that that's not his word it's
[57:35] god's word it's speaking and you believe
[57:38] that then that word goes to work and
[57:40] that word performs in your life and what
[57:43] you find is the works of that word the
[57:46] works of god begin to come forth out of
[57:49] your life what must we do believe
[57:53] sir believe
[57:55] the greatest battle
[57:57] greatest contest greatest conflict
[58:01] that's ever been and still is is between
[58:04] faith and reasoning
[58:09] it goes on and let me say this
[58:12] it that in itself doesn't stop after
[58:16] you've got the holy ghost
[58:18] but when you've got the holy ghost
[58:20] you've got greater is he that is in you
[58:22] you've got a power on the inside and you
[58:25] can just release that and let it go
[58:27] it'll carry you beyond your reasonings
[58:30] and where your reasonings say i don't
[58:32] know about that i don't know about this
[58:35] but faith in god's word will carry you
[58:38] beyond your reasonings
[58:41] we have nothing wrong with reasonings
[58:42] but when reasoning contradict god's word
[58:44] we call reasoning a liar
[58:48] is that right now notice this in joshua
[58:50] 3. i don't know if i'm going to read or
[58:52] just refer to a few of these places but
[58:54] in joshua 3 if you notice here is joshua
[58:58] he's telling the people i want you to
[59:01] sanctify yourselves for tomorrow this is
[59:04] the second day the third day we're going
[59:07] over
[59:08] there is nothing that is uncertain about
[59:11] what joshua is saying but i want you to
[59:13] catch this he's telling the people you
[59:17] sanctify yourselves
[59:19] god's not going to do that for you
[59:20] that's your business but god's business
[59:23] is he'll take you over
[59:26] so our business is to do what god has
[59:28] asked us to do
[59:30] the conditions then for god to come on
[59:33] the scene and fulfill his business
[59:37] because after all we're business
[59:38] partners
[59:42] well that must be about my father's
[59:44] business we must be we must be about his
[59:46] business do what he says do then he
[59:49] steps in and does what only he can do
[59:53] amen so here notice what joshua has told
[59:56] the people
[59:58] in that time and he's letting him know
[1:00:00] now here's the order of approach here's
[1:00:02] how we're going in the land here's how
[1:00:05] it's going to open on that third day on
[1:00:07] that third day the priests themselves
[1:00:10] are going to take the ark upon their
[1:00:13] shoulders remember what the ark
[1:00:14] contained the ark contained that of the
[1:00:16] word it represented the word taking the
[1:00:19] word into your heart
[1:00:21] putting the word first we're going to
[1:00:23] take the word and i want as the priest
[1:00:26] they bring this word and they step in
[1:00:29] the edge of the water i want you to
[1:00:32] witness of how then god will part the
[1:00:35] waters he'll cause the waters to stay
[1:00:39] now i want you to catch this here in
[1:00:41] verse 13 he says and it shall come to
[1:00:44] pass as soon as the souls of the feet of
[1:00:47] the priest that bear the ark of the lord
[1:00:50] the lord of all the earth shall rest in
[1:00:53] the waters of jordan that the waters of
[1:00:56] jordan shall be cut off from the waters
[1:00:58] that come down from above and they shall
[1:01:01] stand upon a heat and verse 15 and as
[1:01:04] they bear the ark they will come unto
[1:01:07] the jordan and the feet of the priests
[1:01:09] that bear the ark were dipped in the
[1:01:11] brim of the water for jordan overflowed
[1:01:14] its banks
[1:01:15] all the time
[1:01:17] of harvest
[1:01:20] now to think of this
[1:01:22] in this time
[1:01:24] it did not make sense to cross jordan at
[1:01:28] this time
[1:01:30] where they crossed that brother brown
[1:01:32] lays it out clearly he said at other
[1:01:34] times of the year they could have walked
[1:01:35] right through there
[1:01:38] but it was at the time of harvest
[1:01:43] where the waters oh my
[1:01:45] where the waters were so great i don't
[1:01:48] want to run out here on on and tying
[1:01:50] this in and tying that but we might as
[1:01:52] well run with it we're living in a time
[1:01:54] when the waters are very great
[1:01:57] are you hearing me the bible says the
[1:01:59] setteth upon the waters
[1:02:02] waters that are wanting to stand between
[1:02:05] when you say waters waters are people
[1:02:07] but remember the people are influenced
[1:02:09] by spirits
[1:02:12] and every demon out of hell is against
[1:02:15] this advancement of the word satan is
[1:02:18] against you from coming into the promise
[1:02:21] of god's word if he can point out all
[1:02:23] your faults if he can point out all your
[1:02:25] shortcomings let me tell you something
[1:02:27] this guy has things to say that you
[1:02:29] could say that makes sense i know me i
[1:02:32] know about me but remember we're not to
[1:02:35] look at what the enemy says you are to
[1:02:38] look at what god says you'll never make
[1:02:41] yourself worthy you'll never be a fit
[1:02:44] candidate in yourself it is god who
[1:02:47] makes us worthy it is god who provides
[1:02:50] for himself it's god who gives the word
[1:02:52] that we can take that word and be made
[1:02:55] ready to come into the promise
[1:02:58] it was a time of prevailing waters
[1:03:02] it didn't make sense that this was the
[1:03:04] time to cross
[1:03:05] you know it's like sometimes in our life
[1:03:08] we come across certain things and we
[1:03:10] think you know what this just ain't the
[1:03:11] time to do this
[1:03:15] this ain't no time i'm talking about him
[1:03:16] in the natural you know what this will
[1:03:18] wait till spring spring's here
[1:03:22] this just ain't the time to do it
[1:03:24] there's a better time to do it
[1:03:27] right
[1:03:28] i know they put siding and things on the
[1:03:30] houses you know in the wintertime but
[1:03:32] like brother richie and them will tell
[1:03:33] you i mean they have to a lot you know
[1:03:35] for that
[1:03:36] expansion and things even have because
[1:03:37] of the temperature of the weather but
[1:03:38] it's not
[1:03:40] real real conducive time to put it on
[1:03:43] there right
[1:03:45] that's in the natural
[1:03:47] but how much more right here where you
[1:03:49] have some some 2 million people or more
[1:03:52] that's going to cross into the promised
[1:03:54] land
[1:03:55] and god brings them to a place right
[1:03:57] here
[1:03:58] it's at the time of harvest and the
[1:04:00] water is flooding the banks
[1:04:08] and here's what joshua there's no
[1:04:09] uncertainty about it he says get ready
[1:04:15] get ready preparing victims because
[1:04:18] three days we're going over
[1:04:20] and the third day we're going over the
[1:04:22] word is going to go before us we're
[1:04:24] going to give the word preeminence
[1:04:27] the word is going to part the way you
[1:04:29] see nothing but the word will make a way
[1:04:33] the word makes a way for himself
[1:04:36] oh my
[1:04:37] i don't want to get ahead of myself but
[1:04:39] you see when we look at that of how that
[1:04:42] they were called at the worst time that
[1:04:44] could be thought of but you see god
[1:04:47] likes to take those kind of times to
[1:04:49] prove that he's god
[1:04:52] and any man any woman that's ever
[1:04:54] amounted to anything anyone that's been
[1:04:57] a man of god a woman of god is those who
[1:04:59] will believe god what he's promised and
[1:05:02] is not afraid to do it because god will
[1:05:05] always stick with his word just as
[1:05:08] certain as he's god but the first thing
[1:05:10] is you've got to take the word
[1:05:13] you can't expect word results
[1:05:17] without the word
[1:05:20] it's got to be the word first
[1:05:24] that's our business god gives the word
[1:05:27] it's our business to take the word like
[1:05:30] the priests were to take the word under
[1:05:33] the direction of joshua joshua had
[1:05:35] received direction from god now joshua
[1:05:38] is passing on that direction to the
[1:05:40] people and everything has got to fall
[1:05:43] right in line to where the word will
[1:05:46] have preeminence you know what it means
[1:05:48] to have preeminence it means where our
[1:05:50] thoughts and our ideas we let them go
[1:05:54] and let's just be honest sometimes we
[1:05:56] need to say god i need a fresh killing
[1:06:00] brother brown could stand there in
[1:06:02] perfect strength and he said this
[1:06:03] tabernacle needs a killing and i need a
[1:06:06] fresh killing with it
[1:06:08] what is it our own ideas about things
[1:06:11] sometimes our own thoughts about it and
[1:06:13] where do we end up with our own ideas
[1:06:15] and our own thoughts frustrated but god
[1:06:18] has not given it to you and i to bring
[1:06:21] the word to pass that's not our business
[1:06:26] but our business is to believe the word
[1:06:29] to act upon that word and then it's
[1:06:31] god's business to come behind it
[1:06:35] is that right
[1:06:36] so you see god has given his word now
[1:06:39] brother puts it in this way taking the
[1:06:41] word of god as the priest took the word
[1:06:44] upon their shoulders and brother brown
[1:06:45] would say it in this way i i love this
[1:06:47] in time testing memorials he said it's
[1:06:49] the same for you sick people here
[1:06:51] tonight put god's word with your
[1:06:54] confession put your confession you
[1:06:57] believed it you set out there and you
[1:06:59] call those things which are not as
[1:07:01] though they were then we're marching on
[1:07:04] do it that way god's word will take it
[1:07:08] through
[1:07:09] now think of it in in this in this
[1:07:11] moment
[1:07:12] that the people in that time it's one
[1:07:14] thing for joshua to say
[1:07:16] get ready
[1:07:18] sanctify yourselves we're going over
[1:07:21] tomorrow it's one thing for him to say
[1:07:23] it but it's another thing for the people
[1:07:25] to believe it
[1:07:27] you know it's like brother brown gave
[1:07:28] the example he said here was a man that
[1:07:30] said oh pastor you can do great things
[1:07:31] oh pastor you pray for the sick oh
[1:07:33] pastor you you do this and you do that
[1:07:35] and all these things and oh my you know
[1:07:37] and and here brother brother brown turns
[1:07:40] around he says like a man he said is you
[1:07:42] know on a wheelbarrow he said you know
[1:07:44] he's willing to people over this little
[1:07:45] log from one edge to the other edge and
[1:07:48] my man you just do a good job with that
[1:07:50] wheelbarrow my pastor you do so
[1:07:52] wonderful this is so good
[1:07:54] finally the pastor said your turn to get
[1:07:56] in
[1:07:59] i don't know i mean that's that's an
[1:08:01] awful big drop right there
[1:08:03] but wait a minute i thought you said you
[1:08:05] had faith
[1:08:06] see what
[1:08:07] what we need to be what instead of the
[1:08:09] man the man listen to me now the man
[1:08:11] could be looking to a gift that's why
[1:08:13] brother brahma could say and take that
[1:08:15] when they raised that brass serpent in
[1:08:17] the wilderness the promise was look and
[1:08:19] live but brother bram said if they
[1:08:20] looked on it as a gift that would heal
[1:08:22] them they failed and would not receive
[1:08:25] their healing but if they can look at it
[1:08:27] that it's god's word that's been set
[1:08:29] before me then there would be virtue
[1:08:31] that would come because their faith is
[1:08:34] appropriated in the word of god that has
[1:08:36] been set before him that's the same way
[1:08:38] right here this morning we can look at
[1:08:41] it and rejoice in it but it's time to
[1:08:43] get in the wheelbarrow it's time to go
[1:08:46] to the other
[1:08:50] side so these people they had to have
[1:08:53] confidence in faith in what god was
[1:08:57] saying you see this is to me the the
[1:08:59] paradox when we talk about a paradox it
[1:09:02] is absolutely a paradox of the anointing
[1:09:05] of the word and how god will come
[1:09:07] remember moses was so complex perplexed
[1:09:10] about it of what do i do when i get down
[1:09:12] there if i say this and when they're
[1:09:13] going to ask me this and i say this see
[1:09:15] it's always here was the humanity coming
[1:09:18] out in that manner of people are going
[1:09:20] to want me to prove it people are going
[1:09:21] to want this and people are going to
[1:09:22] want that but you see one thing that
[1:09:24] moses was failing to recognize he came
[1:09:27] to it eventually was that god himself
[1:09:30] said i will accompany you
[1:09:33] it's not going to be your word but i
[1:09:35] will be there to accompany it not only
[1:09:38] with signs and wonders but my presence
[1:09:40] will be right there with you and the
[1:09:43] same god who's sending him down there
[1:09:45] there are people that are ordained to
[1:09:48] hear that word and as they begin to give
[1:09:50] ear to that word the anointing of the
[1:09:53] word that moses met and came with him
[1:09:57] now begins to fall upon the people to
[1:10:00] walk in obedience to the word that's a
[1:10:02] paradox
[1:10:03] i said that's a paradox
[1:10:05] well this time you say oh if i can only
[1:10:07] be a moses if you have been born again
[1:10:09] of the spirit of god you are a moses let
[1:10:13] not this law depart out of thy mouth
[1:10:16] you recognize your obedience to the word
[1:10:19] in your home invites not just oh i'm
[1:10:22] going to preach to him about this and
[1:10:23] i'm going to run no no the obedience to
[1:10:26] the word invites the anointing of the
[1:10:29] word into your home it invites the
[1:10:31] anointing into your life what does that
[1:10:34] obedience to the word of almighty god
[1:10:38] is that right
[1:10:40] because you can have absolute truth but
[1:10:42] if you're vexed in your delivery that
[1:10:43] ain't god
[1:10:46] are you hearing me now well i'm just
[1:10:48] upset and frustrated that ain't god
[1:10:49] don't blame that on god that is that is
[1:10:52] not according to god's word and god
[1:10:54] won't back that up
[1:10:56] are you hearing me god won't back up
[1:10:58] that but god will only back up his word
[1:11:01] listen this is why everything must come
[1:11:04] under the discernment of the word every
[1:11:07] motive every objective and it must come
[1:11:09] according to god's channel
[1:11:14] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:11:17] you see regardless
[1:11:19] you know brother john they could look
[1:11:21] over there and they could see them banks
[1:11:23] was flooded
[1:11:27] but regardless
[1:11:29] of how the circumstances looked
[1:11:32] they were making ready
[1:11:34] when you looked at their lives they were
[1:11:36] making ready
[1:11:38] to go across the jordan
[1:11:42] how's that gonna happen i don't know he
[1:11:43] just said get ready
[1:11:45] he just said be ready
[1:11:48] that's all god you see god had moved in
[1:11:51] such a place remember that old
[1:11:53] generation of doubters died off
[1:11:57] the ones who wanted to bring up an evil
[1:11:59] report you know what the evil report was
[1:12:01] it wasn't whole night oh wow that's
[1:12:03] cancer oh no no the evil report was they
[1:12:07] didn't believe that god was able to keep
[1:12:10] his word
[1:12:12] and you know what it was they said god
[1:12:15] you can't do your business you know why
[1:12:17] because they weren't doing their
[1:12:19] business
[1:12:21] come on transfer oh my
[1:12:24] god couldn't god can't gonna come down
[1:12:26] and operate like that but you see
[1:12:28] regardless of what was going on no
[1:12:29] matter the circumstance in the midst of
[1:12:32] all of that they were holding to the
[1:12:35] promise of god because you know
[1:12:36] circumstances don't stop god
[1:12:38] circumstances don't mean nothing to god
[1:12:40] circumstances stand out to you and i
[1:12:42] mean
[1:12:44] come on friends let's just be honest
[1:12:45] circumstances stand out to you and i but
[1:12:48] not to god
[1:12:50] and a believer this is where god
[1:12:53] locking us in let me tell you something
[1:12:55] friends this message this is not
[1:12:57] theology
[1:12:59] this is not something that's to be put
[1:13:01] on the bookshelf and played once in a
[1:13:03] while and then we go back to our own
[1:13:05] doubting ways that's not what this
[1:13:07] message produces this message produces
[1:13:11] faith in the hearts of the people
[1:13:14] well brother samuel i've been listening
[1:13:16] to it maybe you need to feed on it
[1:13:20] feed on it take it in and allow the word
[1:13:23] as you're taking it in say lord god
[1:13:25] cleanse me of my own ideas my own
[1:13:28] thoughts and my own being lord rub out
[1:13:30] every complex rub out everything lord if
[1:13:33] there's something in the way that's
[1:13:35] causing lord god the word not to have
[1:13:37] preeminence this is where we're looking
[1:13:39] in the face of the word and taking
[1:13:41] account in our own lives anybody in here
[1:13:44] like to stand in front of somebody and
[1:13:45] they criticize you nobody does
[1:13:49] but the word ain't here to criticize you
[1:13:51] and i but the word is here to point out
[1:13:54] the faults and the flaws and everything
[1:13:56] that's in our life and if we will behold
[1:13:59] him who is the word there is sufficient
[1:14:02] grace that is present that we can call
[1:14:04] upon him and invite the presence of god
[1:14:07] down in our life to change us
[1:14:11] oh my no wonder you say brother samuel
[1:14:13] i've been chained but are you being
[1:14:14] changed
[1:14:18] we were to be changed
[1:14:21] being changed
[1:14:23] there should be a changing that's going
[1:14:24] on changing from glory
[1:14:27] unto glory
[1:14:29] amen maturing are going on you see god
[1:14:32] takes
[1:14:33] believers
[1:14:35] to prove his word through
[1:14:39] look how brother brahman says this with
[1:14:40] joshua
[1:14:44] joshua how are you going to get across
[1:14:45] that river
[1:14:48] that's not my business
[1:14:51] it's my business to walk down to the
[1:14:53] river
[1:14:55] oh now so wait a minute now
[1:14:57] you mean he they actually had to walk
[1:15:00] down to the river
[1:15:02] in order for god to do his business
[1:15:05] yeah
[1:15:06] if they stayed in the camp and said hey
[1:15:08] you know what y'all tell me when that
[1:15:09] when that when it's parted and we'll go
[1:15:10] no no
[1:15:12] now god's business is not your business
[1:15:15] but neither is your business god's
[1:15:16] business
[1:15:18] hallelujah
[1:15:20] it's my business to walk down to the
[1:15:23] river it's god's business to open it up
[1:15:26] when i get there oh
[1:15:29] it's your business to testify and claim
[1:15:32] your healing and say i'm healed it's
[1:15:34] god's business to take care of it after
[1:15:36] you testify and proclaim it
[1:15:40] oh my how many say god i want you to do
[1:15:43] your business
[1:15:45] and lord help me to do my business
[1:15:50] glory be to god
[1:15:52] oh my
[1:15:54] oh my what what strength that we can
[1:15:57] receive from that
[1:15:58] you think of how that you know when we
[1:16:00] look here let me just just move ahead
[1:16:02] here for a few moments
[1:16:04] and look at elijah here
[1:16:07] many places we could go in the
[1:16:09] scriptures there's there's not there's
[1:16:11] not an example in the scripture
[1:16:13] that we couldn't take i i
[1:16:15] just i could just preach the whole bible
[1:16:17] with this thought
[1:16:18] god's business is not your business
[1:16:21] because every man
[1:16:23] every son and daughter of god it has
[1:16:26] always been that way
[1:16:27] that it's it's been god a lot things for
[1:16:30] you and i to do
[1:16:32] that we might show our faith
[1:16:34] how would we know what to do if he
[1:16:36] didn't show us
[1:16:38] see it's even his grace that he would
[1:16:39] show us what to do
[1:16:42] then it's his business to come on the
[1:16:44] scene and fulfill his word
[1:16:47] notice when he calls elijah here
[1:16:50] elijah remember in in first kings 18 i
[1:16:52] may kind of move around a little bit on
[1:16:54] this
[1:16:55] but elijah
[1:16:57] when the people had had departed from
[1:16:59] the living god and they were between two
[1:17:01] opinions remember elijah received a word
[1:17:06] from the lord
[1:17:08] and that word was
[1:17:10] is column to mount carmel for a showdown
[1:17:14] i want you to think of this
[1:17:17] elijah
[1:17:19] had something that he had to do
[1:17:23] you said god had spoke to him but when
[1:17:25] god speaks are you hearing me now
[1:17:27] when god speaks
[1:17:29] he's asking us to do something
[1:17:33] you said i didn't think i had nothing to
[1:17:34] do in it you don't
[1:17:38] what
[1:17:39] you're confusing me no no there's no
[1:17:42] confusion
[1:17:43] what god calls us to do
[1:17:45] is to surrender our will and our own
[1:17:48] idea
[1:17:50] i'll just come to use examples it comes
[1:17:52] to me
[1:17:53] if i invited you over to my house
[1:17:57] let's say brother joshua you came over
[1:17:59] and brother william
[1:18:01] and we're going to have
[1:18:03] jambalaya
[1:18:07] brother timothy and brother daniel they
[1:18:08] loved him
[1:18:10] well my wife and i we might make it a
[1:18:12] little different
[1:18:15] the shrimp the chicken i don't like
[1:18:18] fishing for meat
[1:18:19] like
[1:18:20] that shrimp fart no this
[1:18:22] let's just put it in there
[1:18:26] we ain't doing a little different
[1:18:28] we do
[1:18:30] but if you all came over there and you
[1:18:32] got in the kitchen and said ah sister
[1:18:34] kim no no no no no uh no no you need to
[1:18:37] be put in this creole season you know
[1:18:38] only a fourth a teaspoon we only need
[1:18:41] you know you only need an eighth of the
[1:18:42] cayenne pepper
[1:18:44] no
[1:18:47] i love you all but i have to tell you
[1:18:49] step out of the kitchen
[1:18:51] i invited you to have jambalaya the way
[1:18:54] we make it
[1:18:57] if you want it the way you make it make
[1:18:59] it at your own house
[1:19:01] but don't come in my kitchen and tell me
[1:19:03] what to do in my kitchen
[1:19:06] you ever been that way
[1:19:08] why why prepare something i've already
[1:19:10] embarrassed her and i've god has helped
[1:19:12] me to learn my lesson because i wasn't
[1:19:13] even thinking about it i wasn't thinking
[1:19:15] nobody altered anything but i sat down
[1:19:17] at the table a dish that she's made and
[1:19:19] i'm you know
[1:19:20] well joey ain't not hard to tell i look
[1:19:22] forward to eating
[1:19:23] and she says a certain dish i asked her
[1:19:25] what's for dinner when do you do that in
[1:19:26] the morning what's for dinner today
[1:19:30] i can have a good expectation
[1:19:35] but sometimes i've sat down this don't
[1:19:37] think right
[1:19:38] what was what was left out of this what
[1:19:40] was not right
[1:19:42] now my wife you know she's like
[1:19:46] because maybe somebody else got in the
[1:19:48] kitchen and oh well let's just do this
[1:19:49] and do this
[1:19:51] i've learned
[1:19:52] god's helped me because i realized
[1:19:54] maybe maybe somebody else started
[1:19:56] sprinkling stuff in or left this out or
[1:19:58] left that out
[1:20:00] you see there's a certain expectation
[1:20:02] that we even in ourselves would have god
[1:20:06] god gave god gave the word to elijah but
[1:20:10] elijah had to follow what god said do
[1:20:15] you see god gave him and now he had to
[1:20:17] follow it elijah came and i just
[1:20:19] referred to the scriptures he repaired
[1:20:22] the altar he had to take the stones that
[1:20:25] were there and repair it
[1:20:28] is that right
[1:20:29] then he had then as he repaired that
[1:20:32] altar then he had to cut the wood put
[1:20:34] the wood in order then he had to put the
[1:20:35] sacrifice in order then he told them go
[1:20:38] fill the barrels with water they had to
[1:20:40] dig the trench around there and fill
[1:20:43] that trench with water that was all a
[1:20:46] part of what god asked him to do
[1:20:50] all of that
[1:20:51] was elijah's business
[1:20:55] are you hearing me that was elijah's
[1:20:57] business
[1:20:59] but god's business was when elijah came
[1:21:02] to that spot and everything was set in
[1:21:05] order and elijah could pray and say hear
[1:21:07] me o lord hear me
[1:21:11] he was praying with the certainty that
[1:21:14] this is what god has promised and down
[1:21:17] came the fire he took care of his
[1:21:20] business that god had revealed to him
[1:21:22] and now god took care of his business
[1:21:29] oh my
[1:21:30] think of this
[1:21:32] this is why as we said like even with
[1:21:34] that of that that you know that recipe
[1:21:36] about jambalaya do what god has said to
[1:21:40] do
[1:21:42] no more than these brothers would come
[1:21:44] there and i would welcome them in
[1:21:46] putting more salt here in doing this and
[1:21:47] doing that no
[1:21:49] we're going to make it you're invited to
[1:21:51] it
[1:21:52] and that's how god expects us to conduct
[1:21:55] our business is to take his word not try
[1:21:59] to understand it not try to figure it
[1:22:01] out we'll add a little bit more salt
[1:22:03] here not that much creole there a little
[1:22:05] bit more cayenne here not too much broth
[1:22:07] there god says i don't want you turning
[1:22:10] from the left or to the right i don't
[1:22:12] want you altering this recipe i want you
[1:22:16] to stay with my word if you want the
[1:22:18] results of the fire stay with the word
[1:22:24] hallelujah what my son do you've been
[1:22:26] invited to a feast
[1:22:28] just enjoy yourself
[1:22:34] hallelujah
[1:22:36] oh my
[1:22:38] you see
[1:22:40] before that time we just read about
[1:22:42] god had told is god had told it
[1:22:45] elijah
[1:22:48] go stand to in front of ahab and tell
[1:22:50] him
[1:22:51] they're not going to be do a rain fall
[1:22:52] from heaven until i call for it
[1:22:56] that's a mighty big statement
[1:22:58] hey that was a mighty big statement
[1:22:59] joshua made and said three days were
[1:23:01] going over
[1:23:04] that's a mind that's a mighty big
[1:23:05] statement but you see there's an
[1:23:07] anointing that comes with that word
[1:23:10] if you believe it
[1:23:12] you begin to act on it and make
[1:23:13] preparations for it
[1:23:16] but while that was going on
[1:23:18] god told elijah
[1:23:21] i have got
[1:23:22] a place
[1:23:24] reserved for you
[1:23:26] up in the mountains
[1:23:28] and i've got some water up there
[1:23:30] brother braham said didn't make any
[1:23:32] sense going up to the mountains where it
[1:23:34] would be dry
[1:23:36] but god had a place provided
[1:23:38] and he said i've commanded think of this
[1:23:41] the ravens to feed you
[1:23:51] i don't
[1:23:53] think of this just for a moment
[1:23:56] it would be like you or i go into a
[1:23:58] restaurant and somebody shows up to our
[1:23:59] table without any arms
[1:24:02] and they say i'm here to serve you today
[1:24:06] first of all come on be honest with me
[1:24:08] first of all the thoughts going to hit
[1:24:09] your mind how they're going to write
[1:24:11] down to make sure that my state gets
[1:24:12] done the right way
[1:24:15] and that
[1:24:16] they might have a great memory
[1:24:18] but the next thing is how they're going
[1:24:20] to bring my food here
[1:24:23] how they're going to do all this it's
[1:24:24] not just my table it's other tables as
[1:24:26] well the first thing that would hit our
[1:24:28] mind thing why because as human beings
[1:24:31] we are prone to go that way first
[1:24:36] and let me just say this there are some
[1:24:37] things listen friends there are some
[1:24:39] things
[1:24:41] that we should just be able to look at
[1:24:42] and know
[1:24:44] are you hearing me
[1:24:46] there are some things it's just like
[1:24:47] when you sit down in front of a car
[1:24:48] payment if you can't afford it you
[1:24:50] understand what i'm saying don't don't
[1:24:52] don't go out on the ballpark with me now
[1:24:54] but you understand if it's something and
[1:24:56] it's not a need and it's something
[1:24:57] you're looking at you can look at that
[1:24:59] and think man you know what this is this
[1:25:00] is a want this really ain't a need
[1:25:03] there ain't something that you've got to
[1:25:04] then turn around and pray about i'm not
[1:25:06] talking about when there's a need and it
[1:25:08] might pinch and cut in a little bit i'm
[1:25:10] talking about sometimes on wants there's
[1:25:12] certain things that you're not saying
[1:25:14] well i'm going to go home and pray about
[1:25:15] it no what it is you really really
[1:25:17] really want it
[1:25:20] oh
[1:25:21] you're thinking about it here just go
[1:25:23] and drive it
[1:25:27] fill the seats and how they got the air
[1:25:30] conditioning and the warming and this
[1:25:32] and that no thank you
[1:25:35] we know those tricks
[1:25:37] see yourself in it
[1:25:39] you look like the same same person
[1:25:42] [Music]
[1:25:44] oh jesus
[1:25:48] the cadillac don't make you look better
[1:25:52] it might be a nicer ride but it'll make
[1:25:54] you look better
[1:25:56] oh lord how do we get there
[1:26:01] but you understand
[1:26:03] there's things that when we're when
[1:26:04] we're looking at all of this with the
[1:26:07] promises of god and you see where they
[1:26:10] were at god
[1:26:11] then i'm going to command the ravens to
[1:26:13] feed you
[1:26:14] elijah didn't even have a question about
[1:26:17] it
[1:26:20] he wasn't even questioning how's that
[1:26:22] gonna be
[1:26:23] i like how brother brad makes it so
[1:26:25] simple in the message certain sound
[1:26:27] he said elijah didn't even stop to think
[1:26:31] i how in the world what kind of ravens
[1:26:33] are gonna do that how can a raven pick
[1:26:35] up the beef how can a raven carry it how
[1:26:37] can a raven do this he said what it was
[1:26:40] elijah had heard from god
[1:26:43] just as much as there was a certainty
[1:26:46] that judgment was coming there was a
[1:26:49] certainty there is a place provided for
[1:26:52] you
[1:26:54] and god didn't say i might send ravens
[1:26:58] maybe i will might be god said i've
[1:27:01] already commanded them
[1:27:05] let me tell you something god's not
[1:27:07] maybe going to send the holy ghost
[1:27:10] it's not a maybe he said i have sent the
[1:27:13] holy ghost
[1:27:15] it's right here among us it's a promise
[1:27:17] of almighty god you say what do i have
[1:27:20] to do your business is repent
[1:27:24] and another part of your business is be
[1:27:27] baptized in the name of jesus christ and
[1:27:30] god's business is he will fill you with
[1:27:33] the holy ghost
[1:27:37] hallelujah
[1:27:38] our business and god's business
[1:27:43] oh my
[1:27:44] think of this here for a moment
[1:27:46] the brook dries up
[1:27:48] i'm coming down
[1:27:50] the brook dries up
[1:27:52] because there's just no ending to this
[1:27:57] and god lets him know
[1:27:59] this is dried up
[1:28:01] but i got a
[1:28:02] i got a widow of therapists i want you
[1:28:04] to go to
[1:28:07] she don't know it but i have commanded
[1:28:09] her
[1:28:11] to feed thee
[1:28:13] doesn't know she's in the drama
[1:28:16] she don't know she's in the vision
[1:28:23] she don't know what she's about to
[1:28:25] entertain know that she's been praying
[1:28:27] god
[1:28:28] lord the mill barrel the crucible she's
[1:28:31] been praying and she's been looking to
[1:28:33] the lord but she does not know that god
[1:28:37] is sending his answer to her need
[1:28:43] all glory be to god but god has it all
[1:28:45] arranged for the actors would be on the
[1:28:48] stage at the right time and the right
[1:28:51] things would be said and let me say
[1:28:53] there's an anointing that companies this
[1:28:56] word
[1:28:58] when he goes down there
[1:29:01] and he speaks to her
[1:29:04] he mentions to her
[1:29:08] he said give me a little drink of water
[1:29:10] okay
[1:29:11] no problem
[1:29:13] i got plenty of water
[1:29:15] are you hearing me now
[1:29:17] everyone don't hesitate tonight
[1:29:18] give me water
[1:29:22] so she went through getting water a
[1:29:23] hesitation
[1:29:24] but then as she went to act
[1:29:27] upon that here came the word
[1:29:35] bring me a cake
[1:29:37] she says i only have enough
[1:29:40] for my son and i to make one
[1:29:43] cake
[1:29:45] we're going to eat it and we're going to
[1:29:47] die
[1:29:51] she knew that's all that they had
[1:29:54] but he said bring me a cake
[1:29:57] first
[1:30:02] what a lesson here
[1:30:04] putting god first
[1:30:06] you always come out in victory
[1:30:11] that's why god could say honor me with
[1:30:13] thy firstfruits that tithes and thy
[1:30:15] offerings and thy barns shall be filled
[1:30:17] with plenty
[1:30:19] are you hearing me church
[1:30:21] these are things because god don't write
[1:30:22] out our check for tithing
[1:30:25] lord jesus
[1:30:26] god don't write out the check for
[1:30:27] offering god don't do that there's some
[1:30:29] things god does but that ain't his
[1:30:31] business
[1:30:32] that's our business
[1:30:35] are you hearing me that's our business
[1:30:37] god said i'll put it in your hands now
[1:30:39] can i trust you
[1:30:42] that's our business but it's god's
[1:30:44] business he said i'll pour you out a
[1:30:46] blessing that you cannot contain
[1:30:49] that's god's business
[1:30:51] is that right
[1:30:53] here this little woman was in this in
[1:30:56] this situation
[1:30:58] and she was standing there but from that
[1:31:01] moment on she went in there and she made
[1:31:04] that cake and she brought it
[1:31:08] brought it right out there to the
[1:31:10] prophet
[1:31:11] and at that moment
[1:31:13] there came the words
[1:31:15] thus saith the lord
[1:31:17] the mill barrel nor the cruce of oil
[1:31:20] will never
[1:31:22] run dry
[1:31:24] you see she might have been looking for
[1:31:26] a sign are you hearing me now
[1:31:28] i want a sign but god never promised
[1:31:30] that signs would come first he said if
[1:31:33] we believe they that believe and the
[1:31:36] signs shall follow them that believe
[1:31:41] the sign of the holy ghost follows them
[1:31:44] and that to believe
[1:31:47] are you hearing me it follows them that
[1:31:50] believe
[1:31:51] and here she was in that place
[1:31:54] and she surrendered her own thoughts and
[1:31:57] her own ideas
[1:31:59] to bring that cake
[1:32:02] and to present it there
[1:32:03] said brother samuel what's this he's
[1:32:05] talking about our life many many ways we
[1:32:07] can run into this it's speaking about
[1:32:09] our whole life our life being being
[1:32:11] completely yielded and surrendered to
[1:32:13] god
[1:32:14] things that you and i it doesn't make
[1:32:16] sense within our minds
[1:32:18] but if we can just heed to the word
[1:32:21] of almighty god
[1:32:23] let me tell you something
[1:32:25] she didn't have nothing
[1:32:28] she didn't have enough to sustain her
[1:32:29] house before the word of the lord came
[1:32:33] to her
[1:32:34] but when she all she had to do her
[1:32:35] business was to make the cake god wasn't
[1:32:38] gonna make the cake lord you just speak
[1:32:41] the word and make the cake no you show
[1:32:43] your faith
[1:32:44] by taking the word that's our business
[1:32:48] it's our business to come it's our
[1:32:51] business to present ourselves it's our
[1:32:53] business to take him at his word it's
[1:32:55] god's business to come and fulfill his
[1:32:57] word after that visitation
[1:33:00] every meal after that was a product of
[1:33:05] thus saith the lord
[1:33:08] her life after that was god's
[1:33:10] willingness it was in god's hands all
[1:33:12] she had to do was surrender her own
[1:33:15] thoughts and her own thinking and god
[1:33:18] supply just what she had need of it was
[1:33:21] god's business
[1:33:25] hallelujah
[1:33:28] right
[1:33:29] this was like as young people and
[1:33:31] everything else
[1:33:33] you know
[1:33:34] you don't come and say pray for me
[1:33:37] i've got to have a test my first
[1:33:38] question how you studied right
[1:33:45] well i didn't study very hard we think
[1:33:47] we think the magic
[1:33:50] on friends
[1:33:51] we have to put those stones together in
[1:33:53] the altar we got to lay the wood on we
[1:33:56] have to do our part
[1:33:58] and when you've done your part that god
[1:34:00] expects you to do then god will come and
[1:34:03] do what you can't do he'll bring things
[1:34:05] back to your remembrance he'll open you
[1:34:08] remember brother man tells us in key to
[1:34:10] the door he don't only take the message
[1:34:12] key to the door and deal with it in
[1:34:13] faith he says everything even in this
[1:34:16] natural life for mathematics and
[1:34:17] engineering and everything there is a
[1:34:20] key to all of that
[1:34:23] and when that key comes it becomes the
[1:34:26] aha it starts to unlock other things
[1:34:31] and once other things are unlocked what
[1:34:33] is that faith operating as an engineer
[1:34:35] faith as a mathematician faith as a
[1:34:37] plumber faith is deciding man faith has
[1:34:39] faith faith you because you're operating
[1:34:41] in confidence you're not walking on the
[1:34:43] job said well i don't know if i can do
[1:34:44] this drywall job or not you know i'm not
[1:34:45] real too good at it i don't know you
[1:34:47] know the the the screw stick through you
[1:34:49] know i just seem to get mud everywhere i
[1:34:51] really don't know you don't go on the
[1:34:52] job like that
[1:34:54] once the key
[1:34:56] has come
[1:35:00] there's a confidence
[1:35:02] is that right
[1:35:04] when we have to apply ourselves give
[1:35:06] ourselves to the word
[1:35:08] that's our business
[1:35:11] that's our business
[1:35:13] lord i want the holy ghost so bad it's
[1:35:15] your business to repent
[1:35:19] well i have repented i'm not just
[1:35:20] talking about for being sorry
[1:35:22] i'm talking about to where you hate that
[1:35:24] thing
[1:35:26] you abhorrent that's what the word
[1:35:27] repent means you abhor it i don't want
[1:35:30] nothing to do with this life i want
[1:35:32] jesus christ
[1:35:35] listen when you fully surrender he fully
[1:35:38] comes in
[1:35:43] it's our business to surrender
[1:35:47] and then god does his business
[1:35:52] this is why the scriptures
[1:35:56] when it speaks concerning
[1:35:59] our life and faith and
[1:36:01] direction
[1:36:02] i trust your faith is growing
[1:36:05] and building even this morning
[1:36:07] when you recognize it it should be
[1:36:11] when you recognize
[1:36:13] that part that you and i are called to
[1:36:15] do
[1:36:16] and god steps in and does what only he
[1:36:19] can do
[1:36:22] because sometimes we're wondering
[1:36:24] well i wonder why this hasn't happened i
[1:36:26] wonder why that hasn't happened i wonder
[1:36:28] why
[1:36:29] you don't need to wonder
[1:36:32] you come back remember brother branham
[1:36:33] when he preaches the message is be
[1:36:35] certain of god
[1:36:37] be certain of god first
[1:36:40] be certain listen if there's something
[1:36:43] in your life that's not right
[1:36:45] get it made right
[1:36:47] because god ain't gonna come over that
[1:36:51] god's business is to do his business
[1:36:53] but part of our business is confess your
[1:36:56] sins
[1:36:57] and he's faithful and just to forgive
[1:36:59] you and cleanse you from all
[1:37:00] unrighteousness
[1:37:01] if you got to make something right go
[1:37:02] make it right
[1:37:04] are you hearing me that's part of our
[1:37:05] business god ain't gonna walk over you
[1:37:07] and make it right and say hey joey let
[1:37:09] me tell you something samuel needs to
[1:37:11] make this right so i'm coming over here
[1:37:12] to do it for him is that all right
[1:37:15] nope
[1:37:15] if i wronged him
[1:37:17] my business is to go to him
[1:37:20] the word that right that's what the word
[1:37:22] says
[1:37:23] right then it's god's business to move
[1:37:26] behind that
[1:37:28] is that right
[1:37:30] that's how that's that's that's the part
[1:37:31] of the word it's god's god's word and
[1:37:34] god's business to move on the scene
[1:37:37] behind his word let me just let me close
[1:37:39] with this here
[1:37:41] you see
[1:37:42] the scripture tells us
[1:37:45] they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:37:48] and they shall recover how many believe
[1:37:50] that still
[1:37:52] i believe that promise still
[1:37:54] i know that healing can come right what
[1:37:56] we're setting and listening to the word
[1:37:58] we've had testimonies here
[1:38:00] even at times where i've received
[1:38:02] healing you probably have to i haven't
[1:38:03] even been right here in the house of god
[1:38:04] maybe been out on the lawn or driving or
[1:38:07] somewhere but
[1:38:08] this promise is still in effect
[1:38:12] they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:38:13] they shall recover
[1:38:15] now you see i never
[1:38:17] i never just i never determined
[1:38:19] where it was going to happen well i'm
[1:38:21] going to go and you know i'm going to
[1:38:22] speak the word and this is how it's
[1:38:24] going to happen
[1:38:25] i don't know how it's going to happen
[1:38:28] i don't know when it's going to happen
[1:38:29] if i need healing
[1:38:31] i don't know that
[1:38:32] but i know what he promised and i know
[1:38:34] it's my promise
[1:38:36] are you hearing me
[1:38:37] part of our business is to be certain
[1:38:39] that what he said
[1:38:41] he will
[1:38:42] do and if you listen what the holy
[1:38:45] spirit has said one of the things that
[1:38:47] will keep you back from being certain
[1:38:49] is unconfessed sin
[1:38:52] that's one of the devil's ways to hide
[1:38:56] and it builds doubt and unbelief
[1:38:59] condemnation
[1:39:01] what do i do confess it because he
[1:39:03] already knows it anyhow
[1:39:06] you see god isn't here to put you down
[1:39:09] god's here to release you
[1:39:12] the enemy like to keep you locked away
[1:39:14] and keep you hindered but this god is
[1:39:16] here a high priest that can be touched
[1:39:18] by the feeling of our infirmities he's
[1:39:20] here to release us
[1:39:23] what do i have to do confess it side
[1:39:26] with the word of god confess it
[1:39:29] repent
[1:39:30] let it be let it be brought under the
[1:39:32] blood of the lord jesus christ then we
[1:39:34] can stand on this promise they shall lay
[1:39:36] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:39:40] this is a promise in god's word
[1:39:42] let me read you another another
[1:39:43] scripture here in the book of james and
[1:39:45] these are familiar scriptures these are
[1:39:46] not probably
[1:39:48] majority of us at different times could
[1:39:50] quote these scriptures with our just
[1:39:51] waking up from a nap but sometimes where
[1:39:54] we miss and we fail
[1:39:56] is the order that god has given
[1:39:59] james 5 14
[1:40:01] is any sick among you
[1:40:05] let him wait for the pastor or the
[1:40:07] deacon to call

[1:40:13] that must be the you version of the
[1:40:14] bible

[1:40:18] version that must be the
[1:40:20] weight on them come on friends
[1:40:24] more taren's it been 20 years i've been
[1:40:26] pastoring and there's some times and we
[1:40:28] understand it sometimes you know oh you
[1:40:29] know we can get offended with things but
[1:40:31] if we'll follow the word listen we
[1:40:33] follow the word then we get the word
[1:40:36] results
[1:40:39] brother sister where you been oh i've
[1:40:42] been sick for so weeks who'd you let
[1:40:43] know
[1:40:45] who'd you call
[1:40:46] well i didn't want to bother nobody
[1:40:48] you're not bothering anybody this is the
[1:40:50] word
[1:40:51] is there any sick among you let them
[1:40:54] call for the elders of the church
[1:40:58] you can even send a text you know what
[1:40:59] this is showing it's your business to do
[1:41:02] this
[1:41:03] well i don't got a voice use them
[1:41:05] fingers
[1:41:07] all right you can have somebody else hey

[1:41:12] elders of the church let them pray over
[1:41:15] him so they call then the elders pray
[1:41:18] over him anointing him with oil in the
[1:41:20] name of the lord and the prayer of faith
[1:41:22] shall save the sick and the lord shall
[1:41:25] raise him up and if he's committed any
[1:41:27] sins
[1:41:28] they shall
[1:41:30] be
[1:41:31] forgiven him
[1:41:36] let's just stop
[1:41:38] god's business
[1:41:40] is not our business
[1:41:44] god
[1:41:46] is determined
[1:41:49] to fulfill
[1:41:50] his word
[1:41:55] the original commission mark 16
[1:41:58] go you therefore and preach the gospel
[1:42:01] and then that believe
[1:42:06] and are baptized
[1:42:09] shall be saved
[1:42:12] very simply put brother bram says
[1:42:15] my responsibility is to preach it
[1:42:19] it's god's responsibility to see that it
[1:42:22] gets to the predestinated
[1:42:26] seeds it ain't up to us we'll make this
[1:42:29] one no we don't make nobody a
[1:42:31] predestinated seed we don't make nobody
[1:42:33] oh i'm going to make them a child of god
[1:42:35] bless god i'm going to get no we don't
[1:42:37] do that
[1:42:40] our business
[1:42:41] is to preach the gospel
[1:42:44] and if you ain't called to preach
[1:42:45] don't do it on facebook either
[1:42:50] go ahead and live the gospel
[1:42:53] because a life that's live that is a
[1:42:56] sermon that is a living reality that's
[1:42:58] what gets the attention
[1:43:01] of others
[1:43:06] sometimes you might think well i don't
[1:43:07] think nothing's having an effect
[1:43:09] you know brother branham thought in
[1:43:10] himself
[1:43:12] when he about going out west he thought
[1:43:15] man
[1:43:16] it just the message ain't hitting with
[1:43:18] the people it ain't hit
[1:43:20] brother brahman said you know he said
[1:43:21] sometimes when you think things aren't
[1:43:24] hidden
[1:43:26] he says and and soaking up that he said
[1:43:28] you just be salty
[1:43:30] brethren gives us an example brother
[1:43:31] greg
[1:43:32] of when there was a man who had stood up
[1:43:34] in a breakfast out west
[1:43:36] and he had said certain things
[1:43:38] ministered
[1:43:40] brother demas or no brother williams got
[1:43:42] it behind him brother william said well
[1:43:44] i can imagine i can admire brother
[1:43:46] williams standing up behind him and said
[1:43:49] that ain't the way that brother
[1:43:50] branham's taught it
[1:43:55] he said would you like me to bring
[1:43:56] brother branham here would you like me
[1:43:58] to bring him back he said brother
[1:44:00] branham he said i went down through that
[1:44:01] audience he said there was hundred
[1:44:03] dollar bills being put in my hand he
[1:44:05] said your trip here and back is already
[1:44:08] paid for brother baby said see he said i
[1:44:11] thought the word wasn't getting through
[1:44:14] but he said it was having an effect all
[1:44:16] the long and brother brahm takes that
[1:44:18] and he applies that with spouses in
[1:44:20] marriage and with our children he said
[1:44:23] sometimes what you think is not having
[1:44:25] an effect but if you just live a salty
[1:44:27] life
[1:44:31] live a salty life well my business know
[1:44:33] your business and my business is to live
[1:44:36] the word
[1:44:38] be available be an instrument be a
[1:44:40] channel that the token an atmosphere can
[1:44:44] be created around there
[1:44:47] and then it's god's business to step
[1:44:48] down
[1:44:51] what a release
[1:44:53] if we can just really catch that
[1:44:56] that for every promise that's right here
[1:44:58] this morning
[1:44:59] for anyone seeking the holy ghost
[1:45:02] for a life that needs healing
[1:45:04] deliverance
[1:45:07] whatever the need is
[1:45:10] if we can heed
[1:45:12] to his word
[1:45:14] and do
[1:45:15] that business that he's calling us to do
[1:45:19] then he'll do his business
[1:45:22] what do i have to do
[1:45:24] well god told israel he said
[1:45:26] when you carry that ark
[1:45:28] remember god said those feet
[1:45:30] they had to get into the water
[1:45:32] think about it
[1:45:34] when they put the ark on they put the
[1:45:36] word on the shoulder the priest there
[1:45:38] and joshua three
[1:45:39] the water didn't move
[1:45:41] they had to get their feet in the water
[1:45:43] let me just say it how brother graham
[1:45:44] said it he said they waited in water for
[1:45:46] maybe for 20 feet
[1:45:50] he said but when they got to about the
[1:45:51] 40-foot point they were standing on dry
[1:45:54] ground
[1:45:55] you see sometimes when you start into
[1:45:57] something it didn't feel like wow does
[1:45:59] this feel right no it didn't feel right
[1:46:01] it didn't even look right
[1:46:03] they were walking into water and that
[1:46:05] can be a promise that's right before you
[1:46:07] what do i do walk on into the water
[1:46:11] with what with the word because know
[1:46:13] that the holy ghost will always come to
[1:46:15] the word
[1:46:18] let's pray heavenly father
[1:46:22] lord
[1:46:26] you know lord jesus that even
[1:46:29] lord just
[1:46:30] inspiration lord that's
[1:46:33] you placed on my heart lord
[1:46:35] with this thought that i certainly
[1:46:37] didn't know
[1:46:38] that it would be
[1:46:40] this week lord
[1:46:44] didn't know that lord last weekend
[1:46:49] lord you have a way of ordering things
[1:46:52] moving things around
[1:46:55] sometimes the lord in my own being it
[1:46:57] makes me very nervous
[1:47:00] because i'm not interested in preaching
[1:47:04] but as though that well i have to
[1:47:05] minister this
[1:47:08] i have to minister this
[1:47:10] lord even this morning you know
[1:47:13] even as i awoke i had two
[1:47:15] messages sitting before me
[1:47:18] which way do i go lord
[1:47:20] which way do i go
[1:47:23] praying lord and seeking not knowing
[1:47:26] exactly
[1:47:27] until lord god and just moving down
[1:47:32] father
[1:47:35] i believe in lord just as much as you
[1:47:37] sent elijah
[1:47:39] to the widow of zerebeth
[1:47:41] i believe you sent your word this
[1:47:43] morning lord to minister to our needs
[1:47:46] i believe god you've spoke to us lord to
[1:47:48] minister
[1:47:50] in this time of ephesians that we're in
[1:47:54] what you are calling to from our lives
[1:47:56] is a surrender
[1:47:58] surrendering of our own will
[1:48:01] surrendering of our own ideas and lord i
[1:48:04] i'm just going to be honest with you
[1:48:06] lord
[1:48:08] you know lord from my heart i ask you
[1:48:10] and i can be honest and this
[1:48:12] congregation can too
[1:48:15] but i'm still
[1:48:16] dying dying to myself oh i've
[1:48:20] there's been a death and a new birth has
[1:48:22] come a new man on the inside
[1:48:24] the lord as paul would say
[1:48:27] put on christ
[1:48:30] he would use that phrase put on
[1:48:33] in colossians
[1:48:35] in ephesians
[1:48:37] and that word put on
[1:48:40] as the elect of god
[1:48:43] it speaks of a garment
[1:48:46] that one would sink
[1:48:49] into
[1:48:50] lord jesus
[1:48:52] i hear your prophet tell us
[1:48:54] in the message power transformation he
[1:48:56] says
[1:48:57] many of us
[1:48:58] he says as we've received the holy ghost
[1:49:01] he said now we need
[1:49:03] to let the mind that was in christ
[1:49:06] be in us
[1:49:08] i hear him also say what a privilege it
[1:49:11] is
[1:49:13] that immortal
[1:49:14] could be able to enter in
[1:49:17] to the mind of christ
[1:49:20] lord jesus
[1:49:23] it was the mind of christ that directed
[1:49:25] elijah
[1:49:27] to call for that mount carmel showdown
[1:49:31] but your prophet would tell us in the
[1:49:32] seventh seal
[1:49:34] that once that that had pulled back from
[1:49:36] him
[1:49:38] he ran
[1:49:40] when that pulled back from him he ran
[1:49:44] lord jesus
[1:49:46] your prophet would tell us in this way
[1:49:48] he said see
[1:49:49] as a believer
[1:49:51] how
[1:49:52] we
[1:49:53] need
[1:49:54] and rely
[1:49:55] upon the mind of christ
[1:49:58] letting us know lord god
[1:50:02] that as the secret
[1:50:04] that's within the bride of jesus christ
[1:50:08] she has the mind of christ to know
[1:50:11] what he wants done with the word what he
[1:50:13] wants
[1:50:15] done with it
[1:50:16] he wants us to believe it
[1:50:19] not believe what we can understand
[1:50:22] not believe when circumstances
[1:50:24] seem fitting
[1:50:26] but against all
[1:50:28] odds
[1:50:30] against every
[1:50:32] circumstance
[1:50:33] regardless
[1:50:35] to make ready
[1:50:37] make ready for the fulfillment lord
[1:50:39] help us lord as your children
[1:50:41] help us lord i pray
[1:50:43] o god that the mind of christ would have
[1:50:46] the preeminence in our lives lord
[1:50:49] father we find ourselves lord again and
[1:50:51] again
[1:50:52] we find ourselves repenting saying lord
[1:50:54] forgive me lord and my shortcomings
[1:50:56] forgive me lord god of my failures and
[1:50:58] lord every one of those right there can
[1:51:01] be attributed
[1:51:02] to us relying
[1:51:04] upon the natural mind
[1:51:06] instead of the mind of christ
[1:51:09] help us lord
[1:51:11] if there's one here this morning lord
[1:51:13] that's not
[1:51:16] moved into that great privilege of the
[1:51:17] mind of christ
[1:51:20] maybe lord there's things that they're
[1:51:21] looking at in the word
[1:51:24] maybe like you said here in the
[1:51:25] beginning
[1:51:26] they've just been very fearful
[1:51:29] but god
[1:51:30] may they recognize
[1:51:33] then lord jesus it's your desire
[1:51:36] not
[1:51:37] to create a slavish fear that does not
[1:51:40] come from you
[1:51:42] that shows that a heart is still not
[1:51:44] surrendered
[1:51:45] when it's under a slavish it's still not
[1:51:48] surrendered
[1:51:50] but may we lord surrender it to you
[1:51:53] may it be surrendered to you lord
[1:51:56] i'm certain lord all throughout this
[1:51:58] building there are certain things that
[1:51:59] lord that even as you work within our
[1:52:02] lives
[1:52:03] some things we're prone to some things
[1:52:05] has been taught into us lord
[1:52:07] it's almost like we feel we have to do
[1:52:09] this and if we don't do this we would be
[1:52:11] sinning or this or that
[1:52:12] oh god let us operate by the grace of
[1:52:15] god
[1:52:16] help us lord
[1:52:18] may the great joshua of the holy spirit
[1:52:21] lord just moving right among us lord
[1:52:23] every one of us in here lord god
[1:52:25] every one of us lord
[1:52:27] and may we lord i pray move
[1:52:32] to operate
[1:52:35] to do
[1:52:37] that which is our business
[1:52:41] so that you can do your business
[1:52:45] oh lord god
[1:52:47] help us lord give us grace lord
[1:52:50] teach us lord show us guide us direct us

[1:53:03] business
[1:53:04] is to train up a child in the way it
[1:53:05] should go
[1:53:07] that's our business as parents it's not
[1:53:09] your business
[1:53:12] it's our business
[1:53:13] it's our business and our homes to
[1:53:15] invite the holy ghost it's our business
[1:53:18] to instruct
[1:53:20] our children to that the presence of god
[1:53:22] would be there in our home not preach
[1:53:25] adam
[1:53:26] but be a real example
[1:53:29] and let the word be the guiding factor
[1:53:32] that's our business
[1:53:35] it's your business
[1:53:37] to take them across the jordan
[1:53:40] that's your business

[1:54:06] your word
[1:54:07] and if we'll take that word lord
[1:54:10] we will place that word into our hearts
[1:54:14] your prophet would tell us water it
[1:54:16] with praise
[1:54:19] faith
[1:54:21] pray
[1:54:23] lord you come

[1:56:23] up there
[1:56:26] that was your business
[1:56:28] abraham's business went clear to where
[1:56:32] the hand
[1:56:34] was fully backward on the arm
[1:56:37] his arm was fully up
[1:56:39] that's where his business ended
[1:56:43] and your business
[1:56:45] stepped in
[1:56:48] the ram
[1:56:49] stepped in lord

[1:56:54] mornings lord

[1:56:58] where there's a bride that's attending
[1:57:01] and giving herself to that word is lord
[1:57:04] just laying before that word and
[1:57:07] allowing the sun to make out all the
[1:57:09] greenness lord and a ripening lord
[1:57:12] within our life one of these mornings
[1:57:16] you will fulfill
[1:57:18] your business lord
[1:57:20] with the change
[1:57:22] of the atoms of our bodies
[1:57:26] and we'll be changed in a moment in a
[1:57:27] twinkling of an eye
[1:57:30] granted lord help us to be faithful

[1:57:58] i know
[1:58:01] i love him i love it when he comes that
[1:58:03] way
[1:58:06] it brings it down into such simplicity
[1:58:10] and you know what it does it also it
[1:58:12] takes the cover right off of the enemy
[1:58:15] it dismisses confusion
[1:58:17] it dismisses frustration when we can
[1:58:20] recognize all i have to do is take his
[1:58:22] word
[1:58:23] put it all on my heart
[1:58:25] and start walking
[1:58:28] but the water's over my feet he said
[1:58:31] it'd be dry ground
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:34] and i'm going to walk
[1:58:36] step
[1:58:38] by step
[1:58:39] of the way
[1:58:40] that's my business
[1:58:43] it's his business
[1:58:44] to park the water
[1:58:47] glory be to god
[1:58:49] aren't you thankful that you've got one
[1:58:50] who watches over his word
[1:58:53] aren't you glad to be identified in his
[1:58:55] word
[1:58:56] oh my i said lord just let him just let
[1:58:58] me take the word in my heart brother
[1:59:00] brian whether i feel any different or
[1:59:02] not that has nothing
[1:59:04] to do with it at all
[1:59:06] but tell me what are you going to do i'm
[1:59:08] going to confess
[1:59:10] what he said
[1:59:12] why where are you going to get ravens
[1:59:14] that big i don't know
[1:59:16] i don't know how they're going to do it
[1:59:18] i don't know how they're going to bake
[1:59:19] the bread i don't know how i don't know
[1:59:22] but i know
[1:59:24] he told me
[1:59:25] just to go away there
[1:59:28] so he's got the ravens already prepared
[1:59:32] already to god
[1:59:35] oh my he is still
[1:59:37] jehovah gyra

[2:00:05] remember brother evan said god you ain't
[2:00:06] doubting are you
[2:00:09] but you ain't doubting are you
[2:00:15] if you listen to speak to this mountain
[2:00:17] in california brother brown begins to
[2:00:18] talk about when he was speaking to those
[2:00:20] squirrels you recognize how god had to
[2:00:23] take him through that because brother
[2:00:24] branham thought is this where is this
[2:00:26] coming from
[2:00:27] speak the squirrels this is coming from
[2:00:29] if you listen to that message in 59 a
[2:00:31] powerful message powerful message

[2:00:45] i don't know i've never seen no grizzly
[2:00:46] bear out here before
[2:00:49] but god said it amen
[2:00:53] and if god said it
[2:00:54] he's big enough to take care of it
[2:00:57] what do i need to do just get the gun up
[2:01:01] make sure the sights are in is that
[2:01:03] right
[2:01:05] brother ram didn't go out there and say
[2:01:06] well you know what god's going to give
[2:01:07] me a grizzly it don't matter what wear
[2:01:09] this gun if it's silent in or not no if
[2:01:11] god says he's going to give me a grizzly
[2:01:13] i'm going to go out on the range and i'm
[2:01:15] going to sight in and make ready
[2:01:17] for the promise
[2:01:20] so god's responsibility will supply the
[2:01:23] bear
[2:01:24] right

[2:01:28] but brother brandon's responsibility was
[2:01:30] be there had the rifle sighted in
[2:01:34] and god took care of the rest

[2:12:13] i'm one of them
[2:12:17] [Music]
[2:12:27] amen
[2:12:28] think about it
[2:12:29] the bible tells us in the book of
[2:12:31] corinthians 500 saw him ascend
[2:12:36] 500 saw him
[2:12:38] how many went on in
[2:12:40] and took care of business
[2:12:42] 120.
[2:12:43] what happened to the other 380.
[2:12:48] they saw him ascend when's the last time
[2:12:50] you seen something like this
[2:12:52] but 120
[2:12:55] took care of business
[2:12:57] what were they doing minding their
[2:12:59] business
[2:13:04] somebody says why i feel are you minding
[2:13:06] your business
[2:13:08] if you mind your business
[2:13:10] god will fulfill his
[2:13:12] but there was 120
[2:13:14] that went in
[2:13:17] and they took care of their business
[2:13:18] their business was to go wait in
[2:13:20] jerusalem
[2:13:22] and when they got there
[2:13:23] [Music]
[2:13:25] god showed up
[2:13:27] and god took care of his business
[2:13:31] all they had to do brother carlos was go
[2:13:32] there but you see it shows
[2:13:35] taking care of business
[2:13:36] requires faith
[2:13:38] remember as we spoke last week god
[2:13:41] stimulates
[2:13:42] our faith
[2:13:44] by his presence
[2:13:46] not regardless of circumstances we don't
[2:13:49] try to figure it out
[2:13:51] we stand
[2:13:52] upon his word
[2:13:53] and if there's something in the way that
[2:13:55] would be holding me back then it's time
[2:13:58] to get rid of that
[2:14:00] it's time to clear that out
[2:14:02] so that i can go all the way
[2:14:05] whatever it is because whatever it is
[2:14:07] means nothing
[2:14:10] compared
[2:14:12] to him
[2:14:12] [Music]
[2:14:15] i believe i'm part of that 120.
[2:14:19] a lot of them saw it but i believe i'm
[2:14:21] part of that they went on in and got the
[2:14:23] pentecostal blessing
[2:14:26] glory be to god in the house
[2:14:28] god's business came on the scene
[2:14:30] oh glory be to god amen and amen
[2:14:34] glory
[2:14:35] hallelujah
[2:14:37] my goodness
[2:14:38] i'll tell you we ought to go out of here
[2:14:39] on fire for this week
[2:14:42] no matter what it is you're facing do
[2:14:44] your business
[2:14:46] and god will do his business
[2:14:47] amen if they're right brother joshua you
[2:14:50] do your business god will do his
[2:14:52] business
[2:14:54] because god has partnered
[2:14:56] with man
[2:14:58] glory be to god
[2:15:01] blessed be his name
[2:15:03] lord jesus
[2:15:05] we ask that lord
[2:15:08] you'd go with us
[2:15:10] it's been such a delight to be in your
[2:15:12] presence
[2:15:13] to be gathered together lord with
[2:15:15] brothers and sisters of like precious
[2:15:17] faith
[2:15:18] lord that you would come among
[2:15:20] us you would encourage us
[2:15:23] and strengthen this lord
[2:15:27] father
[2:15:29] may even from this moment
[2:15:31] it'd be such a stirring in hearts that
[2:15:34] there's anything in the way it'd be laid
[2:15:35] aside
[2:15:36] [Music]
[2:15:38] may we stand like those israelites
[2:15:42] that did not regard the circumstances
[2:15:46] of the river
[2:15:48] that may we take the word
[2:15:51] over our heart
[2:15:54] and go stand in the water
[2:15:57] but you're the one who opened it
[2:15:59] not just opened it but the bible said
[2:16:01] they stood
[2:16:02] on dry
[2:16:04] ground

[2:16:14] the lord when we take your word believe
[2:16:16] it and act on it that's what we can
[2:16:18] expect
[2:16:20] a paradox
[2:16:21] a miracle
