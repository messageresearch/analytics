[47:43] yolks and
[47:45] uh I asked Aon this morning if he knew
[47:48] what a snare was and he pointed to the
[47:51] drum back here and I said that's true
[47:55] but not totally true so Aaron what is a
[48:01] yoke something in an egg I knew you were
[48:03] going to say
[48:05] that so this is true it is part of a
[48:10] this is the lovely part of the English
[48:12] language uh it is part of the egg that
[48:15] it's the dippy part that you stick your
[48:16] toast in yes but that's not what I'm
[48:19] going to talk about
[48:21] tonight um so we're going to talk about
[48:25] about a
[48:27] yoke and what a yoke is it's not an
[48:32] egg and what the purpose of it
[48:35] is and who you want to be yolked with
[48:40] and who you do not want to be yoked
[48:42] with so you can see it's not on the
[48:45] breakfast egg theme

[50:21] yeah well go look for them you know but
[50:24] okay help me out your name again onean
[50:27] okay onean micaah
[50:30] so behind you is a yoke so you can
[50:34] uncover this here and and where do I get
[50:37] this stuff well this is at my parents
[50:40] house and I I modified it a little bit
[50:42] so get that on so this is a this Aon is
[50:46] a
[50:48] yoke so yeah so so hold it out here I'm
[50:51] not going to wear this thing you guys
[50:53] are so this is is an object lesson you
[50:56] don't want to forget if you're young and
[50:58] looking for a
[51:00] spouse so who would that be in the
[51:03] audience nobody's getting married in the
[51:06] next 10 years that's nice and the
[51:08] parents in the back said
[51:10] amen especially the dads that are paying
[51:13] for these things okay hold it this way
[51:15] hold it this way so this is a yoke here
[51:17] so we got a yoke so there is a purpose
[51:19] to this yoke right so uh you put your
[51:24] head in there
[51:26] and and you and one you put your head in
[51:28] there okay you got to so so the the next
[51:32] scripture we're going to look at
[51:35] here this could be uncomfortable eh
[51:38] after a little
[51:41] bit so what's the purpose of this
[51:46] yoke what's the purpose of the Yoke
[51:48] first what's wrong with the Yoke
[51:50] here the what stand up straight
[51:54] m
[51:56] what's the problem with this
[51:59] yoke un uneven it's it's it would be
[52:03] uneven well let's turn to another
[52:04] scripture so go to 2 Corinthians 6:14
[52:08] very good who said
[52:10] uneven good very good excellent yeah so
[52:14] here we got these guys aren't even right
[52:16] so so we could pick another boy to come
[52:19] up here would we want a bigger boy or a
[52:21] little
[52:23] boy depends who we get rid
[52:28] of you would want a bigger guy no
[52:31] definitely get rid of me get rid of you
[52:32] is your neck hurt yeah no you're just
[52:35] like this is you don't like being up
[52:36] here you're probably going to be a
[52:39] preacher cuz that makes two of us now
[52:42] yes it
[52:45] does
[52:47] so if we got two we we we want to be
[52:50] let's go to go to your scripture we got
[52:51] it up there be ye not say it with me be
[52:53] ye not
[52:56] okay what does unequally
[53:01] mean what ises unequally
[53:04] mean uh do we put a cat with a dog in a
[53:07] yoke hello do we put a giraffe with a
[53:13] donkey think of something
[53:17] else do you put a horse and an ox in a
[53:23] yoke what normally goes in here
[53:27] two animals of the same type going in
[53:31] the
[53:32] same for the
[53:36] same we're
[53:39] done that's the short version that's the
[53:42] short version so like I said this
[53:43] morning if you want to fall asleep Juan
[53:45] now's your chance buddy catch up on the
[53:48] sleep you got the short version be ye
[53:52] not say it again be I I love
[53:55] memorization because the great thing
[53:57] about the Lord is he will bring those
[53:58] things to your remembrance when you have
[54:00] a problem okay there's a girl in front
[54:02] of you she looks nice but she's not your
[54:07] type cuz she's not a
[54:10] Believer and you are or you're a
[54:14] Believer and
[54:15] he's not and that say it with me be ye
[54:20] not yok together with unbeliever for
[54:24] what fellow ship hath righteousness
[54:27] with and what communion hath
[54:30] light with
[54:34] Darkness so we got two here that aren't
[54:36] equally
[54:37] yolked so Zach come on up here are you
[54:40] closer to closer to Juan or Micaiah come
[54:43] on up here come on we got a we got a
[54:45] yeah 5 tall you're 5'8 how tall are you
[54:47] Mah six foot we well let's try it put it
[54:50] put them in here we'll see what happens
[54:52] Juan you get to sit down there you go
[54:53] buddy thank you for your help
[54:55] yeah can you get down can you get can
[54:58] you get by you Zach step over this way
[54:59] guys okay so we got him here
[55:05] together just to give you this this
[55:07] doesn't cost a thing this
[55:09] one so Jesus laid in a
[55:13] Manger did he
[55:16] not in a
[55:19] barn because there was no place for him
[55:22] in
[55:24] the
[55:25] and he was wrapped
[55:29] in Aaron what's swaddling
[55:33] cloths it's okay I'll give you a break
[55:35] on this one this a free question so on
[55:37] the back of Zach and on the back of ox
[55:41] Zach and on the back of ox micaah there

[57:41] isn't it do you want to see if anybody
[57:43] else can get yolked up in here one of
[57:46] your
[57:47] cousins those guys don't want it okay
[57:50] what's your name brother micaah is so
[57:53] uncomfortable here being yoked with Zach
[57:55] he does not want it come on up come on
[57:58] up I'll switch we'll switch out is that

[58:30] here and Zach you said we got a couple
[58:33] choices here Snickers Skittles
[58:36] kitkats which one Skittles Skittles okay
[58:39] so if I put these skit kit these
[58:41] Skittles over here skit
[58:44] cats put those over

[58:50] say you're going to go to the what you
[58:53] want and you go to what you want
[58:58] [Laughter]
[59:00] go without knocking over the
[59:03] piano I think Caleb's gonna win Zach you
[59:05] go with him so who gave
[59:08] up Zach gave
[59:10] up I I'll hand it to you so you don't
[59:12] fall off the
[59:14] platform okay so and they're going to go
[59:17] over this but but can you walk there by
[59:19] yourself so can two walk together unless
[59:22] they be so they got to agree hey we're
[59:24] going to go get your candy then we're
[59:25] going to get my candy it's kind of like
[59:27] a
[59:36] marriage they have one goal and one
[59:38] destination in mind when you're yoked up
[59:41] with somebody you're going to go the way
[59:42] they're going to
[59:43] go you don't have a choice if they're
[59:46] bigger than you so if I'm yoked up with
[59:49] Juan I'm going to go wherever Juan wants
[59:52] to
[59:53] go if I'm w yoked up with Jeremy I'm
[59:55] going wherever he wants now Zachary
[59:57] that's a different story I could take
[59:59] him where I wanted to cuz I'm
[1:00:05] stronger I
[1:00:10] think so I was thinking about this
[1:00:14] yoke put the first quote up there just
[1:00:17] brother Brandon he'll come so many when
[1:00:19] you start doing searches on things and
[1:00:20] you'll see yoke and unequally yolked and
[1:00:24] so many different quotes that he'll
[1:00:26] bring out this one here he says this is
[1:00:29] about
[1:00:32] Jehoshaphat actually that's not the
[1:00:34] correct one that's from this
[1:00:36] morning but I'll I'll just start reading
[1:00:38] it and it and another thing as soon as
[1:00:41] Jehoshaphat ordinarily now would have
[1:00:43] been prayed over the subject would have
[1:00:45] thought about it first and said God what
[1:00:46] must I do but being yolked up with the
[1:00:48] unbelievers he took the unbelievers way
[1:00:52] and that's the way many Spirit-filled
[1:00:53] Christians after Revival fall because
[1:00:56] they yok themselves up up amongst people
[1:00:59] that said well I go to church we're as
[1:01:01] good as the rest of them and you lose
[1:01:02] your experience stay right on the road
[1:01:05] no matter what the rest of them does you
[1:01:07] know where you belong you know where who
[1:01:08] who you belong to stay right under the
[1:01:11] power of the pray of prayer all the time
[1:01:15] don't let them call you off to something
[1:01:17] something something else in amusements
[1:01:18] and so forth saying there's no harm in
[1:01:20] this if there's a question don't do it
[1:01:22] and stay away from it
[1:01:26] the next next slide I I was going by an
[1:01:29] Amish
[1:01:30] farm may want to dim it a little bit so
[1:01:33] this
[1:01:34] boy is
[1:01:38] controlling I think I counted
[1:01:40] six big
[1:01:43] horses that are yolked together they're
[1:01:47] pulling as a team to plow this
[1:01:51] field but one little boy is is
[1:01:54] controlling all these
[1:01:58] horses
[1:02:01] so do you know how much one horse can
[1:02:04] pull in a
[1:02:09] yoke 8,000
[1:02:11] PBS so that's one horse a big horse how
[1:02:15] many how much can two horses pull now us
[1:02:19] that are higher level homeschool
[1:02:22] Mathers would say
[1:02:24] 8,000 * 2 would
[1:02:29] be but that's not
[1:02:31] true they can pull
[1:02:35] 24,000 so it says bear ye one
[1:02:40] another's burdens and so fulfill the law
[1:02:44] of Christ so if you see somebody
[1:02:46] struggling they're in a yoke you you
[1:02:49] help
[1:02:50] them because you can pull twice no you
[1:02:52] can pull three times the load
[1:02:55] that they
[1:02:58] can
[1:03:00] so if in other words don't kick them
[1:03:03] when they're down boys your brother
[1:03:08] am so if you're in this yoke together
[1:03:10] Caleb and
[1:03:12] Zach one of you wants to play
[1:03:17] fortnite and the other one
[1:03:21] doesn't if you're yolked with that
[1:03:23] person
[1:03:25] chances are you're going to do whatever
[1:03:27] the stronger person is
[1:03:33] spiritually if you're Yol to your
[1:03:37] job this is where it hits the back a
[1:03:40] little bit more than the
[1:03:42] front you won't be a church on Sunday
[1:03:45] you might not be a church Sunday night
[1:03:46] you might not be a church Wednesday
[1:03:47] night or whatever night you have
[1:03:49] church if you're yolked to your job
[1:03:52] because your job is stronger than you
[1:03:54] are and it's going to pull you
[1:03:58] around if you're yolked to
[1:04:00] sports that's going to be where you're
[1:04:02] going to
[1:04:06] go whoever is the strongest will
[1:04:10] win so let's read this verse again can
[1:04:12] you pull that one up there 2 Corinthians
[1:04:15] 6:14 be ye not unequally yolked together
[1:04:22] with so
[1:04:26] we're talking about marriage I know
[1:04:27] nobody in here is going to get married
[1:04:29] only the people that are already married
[1:04:31] are going to stay married but the rest
[1:04:32] of you aren't going to get
[1:04:37] married this is going back years but
[1:04:40] they sang a song Never Say I do because
[1:04:43] if you do you're
[1:04:44] through and that was John leontine John
[1:04:47] Paul wrote that and we we sang it on a
[1:04:50] hill every one of those guys is
[1:04:53] married
[1:04:57] but if you let's just you're yolked with
[1:05:02] an unbelieving
[1:05:05] spouse it's a constant
[1:05:09] struggle and a constant
[1:05:12] fight because she or he doesn't want to
[1:05:16] do the things that you do as a Believer
[1:05:20] because you're yoked with an unbeliever
[1:05:24] so it says be ye not unequally yolked
[1:05:27] together
[1:05:29] with so brother brandham makes a
[1:05:32] statement on be certain of God he says
[1:05:34] and no believer so why are you telling
[1:05:37] me this John I'm only 16 1315 because in
[1:05:42] a short years you're going to be faced
[1:05:44] with this question and if I address it
[1:05:46] now then I can say I told you so
[1:05:51] no no but but if I address it now I feel
[1:05:55] like I'm pretty I mean I at least gave a
[1:05:59] warning so he said no believer should
[1:06:01] ever marry an unbeliever under no
[1:06:04] circumstances should always marry
[1:06:11] Believers and if you would memorize any
[1:06:14] quote as a young girl or a young boy
[1:06:17] this is
[1:06:21] it she doesn't want to go to church or
[1:06:24] he doesn't want to go to church a
[1:06:26] constant
[1:06:28] struggle he wants to have devotions she
[1:06:31] doesn't a constant
[1:06:34] struggle she doesn't love the Lord you
[1:06:36] do or he doesn't love the Lord and you
[1:06:40] do they don't have the same absolute we
[1:06:44] do so the things that you'd like to
[1:06:46] Institute in the home according to the
[1:06:48] message of the hour to make it line up
[1:06:50] with every word because you want to as
[1:06:52] the head of the house isn't going to
[1:06:55] fly because there's a constant
[1:06:59] struggle they'll get saved after we get
[1:07:07] married this is where you shake your
[1:07:08] head like this okay because it doesn't
[1:07:12] work that
[1:07:15] way two questions I asked my boys my
[1:07:18] boys yeah the my boys two questions
[1:07:22] asked the boys that married my two
[1:07:25] daughters and so you know you can ask
[1:07:27] your dad
[1:07:29] girls or boys you can ask your dad mom
[1:07:32] ask both but there are some good things
[1:07:35] that you should be doing so that your
[1:07:38] and your parents should be helping you
[1:07:39] to avoid
[1:07:41] traps of the devil so the first one I
[1:07:44] ask the boys is were you ever married
[1:07:48] before or were you
[1:07:50] engaged now this is just home talk yeah
[1:07:54] but I said even girls I said even before
[1:07:56] you talk to a boy I don't mean saying hi
[1:07:59] or you know that's a nice outfit or that
[1:08:02] I'm not talking about that but what I'm
[1:08:04] talking about seriously talking to a boy
[1:08:06] or talking to a girl I said just come
[1:08:08] talk to me first because then you can
[1:08:10] tell me if you really want to even talk
[1:08:11] to this boy and it'll look like I'm
[1:08:13] saying
[1:08:16] no or you can say yes and then I'll ask
[1:08:18] him these two questions and the first
[1:08:20] question was have you ever been married
[1:08:22] before or engaged and and then the
[1:08:24] second time thing question I asked him
[1:08:25] was can you tell me when you were saved
[1:08:27] and when you were filled with the Holy
[1:08:29] Ghost because no man should ever be
[1:08:32] married or women girls should be married
[1:08:33] until they they receive the Holy Ghost
[1:08:36] because that's going to guide them into
[1:08:37] all truth it's going to help them
[1:08:39] prevent problems when they're yolked
[1:08:40] together because nobody has problems in
[1:08:43] their marriage I
[1:08:45] know and you're like this is way above
[1:08:48] our heads John nobody has problems in
[1:08:49] our marriage but if they're unequally
[1:08:52] yolked you are bound for problems
[1:08:55] but as long as you have an absolute and
[1:08:56] the same goal and the same purpose
[1:08:59] you're going to head to the same
[1:09:00] direction and then the same
[1:09:07] destination so this next quote brother
[1:09:09] Bram says here this is a making the
[1:09:11] valley full of dishes I love
[1:09:13] this because he's talking to you
[1:09:16] Aaron at the bottom of the quote he says
[1:09:18] now this was during the time of Israel's
[1:09:19] backsliding they'd gotten away from God
[1:09:21] and Judah had a king now the king of
[1:09:22] Israel was Ahab who had succeeded his
[1:09:25] father who had married out of the Jewish
[1:09:26] people married just like today when a
[1:09:28] Christian boy marries a sinner girl or a
[1:09:30] sinner girl a Christian boy that starts
[1:09:33] something right then see don't you get
[1:09:34] married unless you're equally yolked
[1:09:36] together with Believers equally yolked
[1:09:39] so when you read the scripture now
[1:09:40] you're going to see these two boys up
[1:09:42] here standing but if I was more Brave I
[1:09:44] would have a girl up here standing but I
[1:09:45] didn't want to do that because I don't
[1:09:46] want to be unequally yoked or yolked
[1:09:48] together yet are you with me don't get
[1:09:51] married unless you're equally yolked
[1:09:53] together with belie Believers you know
[1:09:55] to keep trouble down see now when God
[1:09:57] made men and women in the beginning he
[1:09:59] made their Spirits then then someone
[1:10:02] there's someone for
[1:10:08] you it's hard to believe I
[1:10:12] know there's someone for you just wait
[1:10:15] see all right so there is someone for
[1:10:19] you each person in here there's someone
[1:10:21] for
[1:10:22] you
[1:10:24] brother vam says on another quote he
[1:10:25] says choosing of bride said you have to
[1:10:26] plan and he said you have to look and he
[1:10:29] said you have to pray and I would say it
[1:10:32] should be all in order here plan you
[1:10:36] know you can deny it and say you're not
[1:10:39] planning and say you're not looking but
[1:10:42] you better be
[1:10:47] praying
[1:10:49] so the devil's given us giving you a
[1:10:51] yoke has a yoke of bondage that he wants
[1:10:53] to put on
[1:10:54] you so he wants to yoke you up with
[1:10:56] something right so how's your back doing
[1:11:00] you okay you okay Caleb you're doing
[1:11:02] fine makai's doing okay yeah okay you
[1:11:06] owe him later so there's hooks on here
[1:11:08] for a purpose so the devil's not happy
[1:11:11] just to have you yolked with an
[1:11:14] unbeliever and yolked with the you got
[1:11:16] it there Zach you got it okay so but
[1:11:19] what he wants to
[1:11:22] do he wants to start waiting you
[1:11:25] down so step out there a little further
[1:11:28] keep the Yol equal
[1:11:33] guys so I got these rocks these are good
[1:11:36] Pennsylvania sandstone
[1:11:39] rocks let us lay aside the
[1:11:42] weight that so easily doth beset us okay
[1:11:47] step out here a little bit you got that
[1:11:48] Zach man you are not going to forgive me
[1:11:51] step out yep grab it like that that's
[1:11:53] probably good good Caleb you can grab
[1:11:54] yours like that too and helps sh your
[1:11:56] back okay step out here a little bit
[1:11:58] step out here a little further so we got
[1:12:00] some weight on there now how long you
[1:12:02] think you can do this hope short sermon
[1:12:04] man hope he doesn't have a button in
[1:12:10] there I want you to turn to a scripture

[1:22:09] him so he's as safe here as Hudson is
[1:22:12] Hudson
[1:22:14] here so we're I just another side note
[1:22:18] we're in uh out at Bryce Canyon I think
[1:22:21] it was Bryce Canyon was chice Canyon and
[1:22:23] and I don't like
[1:22:26] heights jerem me I don't I would never
[1:22:29] be a guide up in the mountains or
[1:22:30] anything like that a Grand Canyon it's
[1:22:32] okay to look at from a distance but I
[1:22:35] said to Hudson we were coming home from
[1:22:36] that and there's like thousand foot drop
[1:22:38] off and it's kind of scary for me and I
[1:22:40] said to Hudson I said were you scared
[1:22:42] Hudson and all he goes no he said I'm as
[1:22:44] safe here as I would be in my bed at
[1:22:47] home he's seven yeah he's seven he said
[1:22:52] because it's appointed on the man wants
[1:22:53] to
[1:22:56] die he's well
[1:23:00] taught but you know if you're yolked
[1:23:02] with the Lord you won't be leaving
[1:23:06] early you'll be leaving at your
[1:23:08] appointed
[1:23:09] time so your parents don't have anything
[1:23:11] to worry about
[1:23:15] why you are today because of the friends
[1:23:18] you're going to make today and who
[1:23:20] you're going to decide to be yolked up
[1:23:21] with is going to show your destination
[1:23:23] will be 5 years from
[1:23:30] now so I'll say to
[1:23:33] kids show me your friends and I'll show
[1:23:36] you your
[1:23:40] future because who you decide to be
[1:23:42] yolked with will show where you'll be
[1:23:44] five years from now so this quote goes
[1:23:46] on and what you choose now he says five
[1:23:49] years from today you may be a missionary
[1:23:55] Aaron five years from today you may be a
[1:23:57] renowned Christian or five years from
[1:24:00] today you may be in hell because you
[1:24:03] made the wrong
[1:24:04] decision 5 years from today you may be
[1:24:06] cleaning spatoon in a
[1:24:08] barroom five years from today you may be
[1:24:10] a prostitute on the
[1:24:12] street or you may be a man or a woman
[1:24:15] that's a credit to any society because
[1:24:17] of your choice for
[1:24:19] Christ five years from today you may be
[1:24:21] in glory
[1:24:23] we say all that wouldn't happen but it
[1:24:25] could so quickly
[1:24:30] happen gone in the Rapture because you
[1:24:33] made your choice today but
[1:24:36] you've got to
[1:24:40] choose so you've got to choose which
[1:24:42] yoke you want if you're yolked with
[1:24:44] Christ I know where I'm
[1:24:46] going he's right beside you every step
[1:24:50] of the way he is gonna guide you

[1:24:55] lead Ox in a team you want him leading
[1:24:59] you you want him guiding
[1:25:06] you there's one more quote brother the
[1:25:08] brandham talks about being
[1:25:10] yolked and this one's so good he's
[1:25:13] talking to the brandham Tabernacle and
[1:25:15] he's talking about being prisoners we
[1:25:17] talked about traps this morning I want
[1:25:19] to be a prisoner of the Lord I don't
[1:25:21] want to be trapped by the devil he says
[1:25:23] here oh tonight if we as the brandham
[1:25:24] Tabernacle could only become prisoners
[1:25:26] to our own selfish being to our own
[1:25:29] ambition that we could completely
[1:25:31] surrender ourselves and
[1:25:33] be yoke to
[1:25:36] who yok to him no matter what the rest
[1:25:40] of the world thinks what the rest of the
[1:25:41] world does we're yolked with feathers of
[1:25:43] love we are prisoners my feet is so yok
[1:25:46] to Christ it won't
[1:25:51] dance because he's leading you and
[1:25:53] you're yolked with him my eyes is so
[1:25:56] yolked to Christ till I when I see these
[1:25:58] modern stripes on the street it turns my
[1:26:03] head my my heart is so yolked in love to
[1:26:06] him till I can't have love for this
[1:26:09] world anymore my will is so yolked to
[1:26:11] him till I don't even know now what my
[1:26:15] ambitions are know now what my ambitions
[1:26:17] are just wherever you
[1:26:21] lead I'll follow Lord I'll be a
[1:26:26] prisoner that's my desire let's just bow
[1:26:29] our
[1:26:32] heads maybe you're here tonight and you
[1:26:36] realize that you're yolked up with the
[1:26:38] wrong
[1:26:39] person there's two yolks to choose the
[1:26:42] Devils or the
[1:26:44] Lords and only you know who you're
[1:26:46] yolked
[1:26:51] with is your burden
[1:26:53] light he said my yoke is easy and my
[1:26:56] burden is
[1:26:59] light and you want to swap yolks
[1:27:03] tonight you feel you're not yoked up
[1:27:06] with the right person and you want to
[1:27:08] swap yolks because you know that your
[1:27:10] destination 5 years from now would not
[1:27:14] be a good
[1:27:16] one and you want to raise your hand and
[1:27:18] you want to sayl I want to swap

[1:27:40] you and you want to raise your
[1:27:43] hand you might be yoked up with the Lord
[1:27:46] but you're carrying some burdens you

[1:27:49] want to leave those heavy weights so you
[1:27:51] can can run a better
[1:27:53] race just lay him
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:28:00] down you know it's an act to defy
[1:28:04] gravity to raise your
[1:28:06] hand but brother brandom said many times
[1:28:09] it would mean the difference in your
[1:28:11] Eternal destination so if you want to
[1:28:13] raise your

[1:39:04] [Music]
[1:39:09] Jesus
[1:39:11] got
[1:39:14] got amen how many traded
[1:39:17] yolks
[1:39:19] amen amen in the presence of the Lord my
[1:39:22] my my tell you what you'll never read
[1:39:25] these scriptures the same way you know
[1:39:27] like how when you're in a in a
[1:39:29] dictionary I know those are for those of
[1:39:31] you that's younger they were actually
[1:39:32] books that had pages in them there
[1:39:34] wasn't an
[1:39:35] app and when you come to a certain word
[1:39:38] sometimes that word could have such an
[1:39:40] abstract meaning that it would say see
[1:39:42] and then we give you a picture well now
[1:39:45] in your
[1:39:46] Bible You'll Think of Zach and Micaiah
[1:39:49] You'll Think of Juan and mAh
[1:39:51] and the these visuals are are etched in
[1:39:53] but most importantly is is that what God
[1:39:58] has done for your life right here
[1:40:01] tonight and you know when the Lord
[1:40:02] brings it all the way down you you
[1:40:04] realize that no matter where you would
[1:40:07] be setting at
[1:40:10] tonight all it takes is one
[1:40:14] choice Satan doesn't have any more power
[1:40:19] than you allow him to have
[1:40:23] when David went out there to face
[1:40:26] Goliath the very first thing that Satan
[1:40:29] did is the tactic he uses with
[1:40:31] everyone if I can use a phrase that we
[1:40:34] all many would understand he tried to
[1:40:35] Rattle his cage get in his head you're
[1:40:39] nothing but a youth who are you to come
[1:40:43] and challenge me but you see the size of
[1:40:47] David
[1:40:48] size-wise he was no match for Goliath
[1:40:51] but it's who was on the inside of David
[1:40:56] it's Who David was standing for and he
[1:40:59] was standing with
[1:41:01] David all Goliath saw was a was a little
[1:41:05] guy but what he couldn't see was the
[1:41:08] invisible God whom David was yolked
[1:41:12] [Music]
[1:41:14] with that's what makes the difference
[1:41:17] that's what makes the difference is who
[1:41:19] you're yolked with cuz then you can say
[1:41:22] I can do all things through Christ who
[1:41:24] strengtheneth
[1:41:27] me amen he he Christ is the Difference
[1:41:30] Maker amen amen don't you love

[1:51:12] to Amen brother Zachary Wallace if you
[1:51:15] just come and dismiss us in a word of
[1:51:17] prayer I me say it's been good to be in
[1:51:20] in the house of the
[1:51:21] Lord amen the things that the Lord has
[1:51:24] done right here tonight right here in
[1:51:27] this service I'd say if anybody if you
[1:51:30] need prayer would be happy to stay and
[1:51:32] to pray with you it's not a burden it's
[1:51:35] a blessing for
[1:51:37] us and I say that what it starts just as
[1:51:41] the Lord brought it through brother John
[1:51:42] always know this I think that last quote
[1:51:45] that was
[1:51:47] given it's so important of the impact of
[1:51:51] our choices that we make
[1:51:54] today see even by putting off you're
[1:51:57] making a choice even something right now
[1:52:01] that where God deals with your heart
[1:52:04] just let it be settled in your heart say
[1:52:05] Lord I give it to you Lord you raised
[1:52:09] your hand the Holy Spirit was calling
[1:52:11] out you see what God first touches and
[1:52:15] what he deals with is your heart when
[1:52:18] the heart agrees with the
[1:52:20] word then it releases the power of God
[1:52:23] to bring to pass what you've
[1:52:27] received and it comes to pass God's word
[1:52:30] cannot fail it will produce just exactly
[1:52:34] what he said it will do and it's a
[1:52:37] choice that even when we leave here
[1:52:39] tonight every choice that you make from
[1:52:41] this moment even forward just keep
[1:52:43] making choices as you're looking that
[1:52:47] lead closer to Christ every decision you
[1:52:50] make everything around you for all of us
[1:52:53] pass it through say Lord is this going
[1:52:56] to lead me closer to you or further from
[1:53:01] you I say Lord I want to make
[1:53:04] choices that lead me closer to you I
[1:53:08] want to make choices that bring Jesus on
[1:53:10] the scene I I I I can't do anything
[1:53:13] without him I can do nothing without him
[1:53:17] I remember what it was like to live for
[1:53:19] years years without
[1:53:21] him I know what it felt like to be under
[1:53:24] the presence of the Lord in the church
[1:53:26] but not have him to guide
[1:53:29] me but oh how precious it is to know
[1:53:33] there's a friend that sticketh closer
[1:53:35] than a
[1:53:36] brother when there's somebody where I
[1:53:39] can't pick myself up there's someone to
[1:53:42] encourage
[1:53:43] me and he
[1:53:46] speaks he'll speak through a brother
[1:53:48] speak through a sister maybe through
[1:53:49] through a special speak through a
[1:53:51] message speak through a devotion but he
[1:53:54] speaks and he encourages
