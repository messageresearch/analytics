[0:14] reaches to such a place to what he
[0:16] himself is going to do we know that it
[0:19] is the will of God is that right we know
[0:22] it was the will of God for him to offer
[0:24] up his life but yet it was not something
[0:27] he could just merely do or even be drug
[0:30] to he couldn't be forced to do it but it
[0:33] had to be something that he was willing
[0:35] to do it but in the willingness to do it
[0:37] Paul picks it up and gives us an insight
[0:40] even in Hebrews chapter 12 when he would
[0:42] speak to you and I about everything that
[0:44] we go through and he would say consider
[0:47] him who endured contradiction of sinners
[0:50] lest you be weary and faint in your mind
[0:53] for Paul goes on to say you have not
[0:55] resisted against blood but he makes
[0:58] known to us that the Lord Jesus himself
[1:01] was able to endure for the joy that was
[1:07] set before him how could he endure the
[1:10] cross it was not just he was not just
[1:12] fixated upon the cross what he was
[1:14] focused upon is what would actually the
[1:18] joy that would come from him going to
[1:22] the cross oh my what a what a life that
[1:26] was lived and here this same hold has
[1:30] taken place in Paul's life because Paul
[1:32] realizes here when he says that I must
[1:35] fill up that which is behind of the
[1:37] afflictions of Christ that there is a
[1:39] wanting of the afflictions of Christ to
[1:42] be borne by me remember when the Lord
[1:43] spoke to Paul and said I will show thee
[1:46] what great things thou must suffer for
[1:50] my name's sake and so Paul goes on in
[1:53] this you know the meaning that it would
[1:56] be that I would supply in order to repay
[1:59] the benefits which Christ conferred on
[2:02] me so that the greatest the greatest
[2:05] benefit and the greatest supplying of
[2:08] this is not is not something that Paul
[2:10] is being mandated to do but where Paul
[2:13] himself remember he would refer to
[2:16] himself again a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[2:19] and he would refer of the love that had
[2:22] taken hold he wanted the people to
[2:24] understand that what he was
[2:27] doing was not about something of where
[2:29] he was compelled in service because
[2:31] remember Paul was a Pharisee of
[2:34] Pharisees is that right Paul knew what
[2:37] it meant to do acts of service are you
[2:40] with me but Paul was saying this is
[2:42] different this is not an act of service
[2:45] because the Pharisees the Lord Jesus
[2:47] said they would go around and make long
[2:49] prayers and pretence and everything they
[2:52] did was about a show Paul's letting know
[2:55] that this is not about a show this is
[2:59] not done out of a show this is out of
[3:02] love with Paul even when himself when he
[3:06] would go even into Rome the Bible would
[3:08] tell us that he was not bound with cords
[3:11] as far as physically but he says I go
[3:13] bound in the spirit so this was here
[3:18] when he would even speak again he said I
[3:20] am constrained by the love of God so
[3:23] this had so wrapped in his life to wear
[3:26] that Paul would you know speak of this
[3:29] that there would be the fulfilling or
[3:30] the filling up of the measure of the
[3:33] afflictions its laid upon me we
[3:34] understand that the tests and trials
[3:36] that come our way these are not tests
[3:39] and trials that are randomly falling but
[3:43] everything God knows right along the way
[3:47] and how that everything is all working
[3:50] together for our good
[3:52] it is everything that's working God is
[3:55] moving everything and moving so that in
[3:58] our lives that the glory of God might be
[4:02] declared and the thing that God has to
[4:05] get out of the way is us now watch how
[4:11] Paul will speak of this here once again
[4:13] in Philippians 3:7 what things were gain
[4:17] to me those are counted loss for Christ
[4:22] we could just preach on this verse for
[4:24] four weeks now what was gain to me
[4:27] there's a lot of things that can be
[4:29] gained to me and we're not just talking
[4:30] about jobs and other things like this
[4:32] but if things what is if that's
[4:35] something that profited or advantages me
[4:38] in some way if it's something
[4:39] that will lift me Paul said no no no no
[4:42] that is what I count a loss for Christ
[4:48] hi yay doubtless and I count all things
[4:54] but loss for the excellency of the
[4:58] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord want
[5:02] you to watch what Paul's putting this
[5:03] Paul is he is in such a place here that
[5:07] where Paul notices purpose everything
[5:10] else is so fading away and it continues
[5:13] to fade away the closer that Paul gets
[5:16] to the end of his race everything else
[5:20] is fading away it's not it's not his
[5:24] focus upon himself he's becoming greater
[5:27] as a matter of fact that's becoming less
[5:29] and and that's where we know even where
[5:32] we're at and even where we ought to be
[5:34] in our journey and where God desires to
[5:36] bring us is that it's not about us it's
[5:41] about him
[5:42] it's about his body amen it's about the
[5:47] purchase of his blood it's not about me
[5:50] you know God you know God will put us in
[5:53] situations that actually where he will
[5:56] God will never make a decision for us
[5:59] but God will put us in place as to where
[6:01] we can make decisions we can say things
[6:04] and do things that will be about me or
[6:07] elevate of me or my point or God will do
[6:10] all of that to see what are we going to
[6:12] do what are we going to take in this or
[6:15] would always say wait a minute
[6:17] let me take the backseat and let Christ
[6:21] be the front God will allow that you say
[6:24] what brother semi I've been there enough
[6:25] I feel that we all have been there we
[6:29] all have failed in that area we're not
[6:31] trying to preach you know something to
[6:33] where that it's honor it's not
[6:34] unattainable no but to recognize when it
[6:37] doing something like that
[6:38] we know and it's mites are hard we can
[6:40] say I said that out of turn right there
[6:42] I shouldn't have said it that way
[6:44] something that even could smart a heart
[6:47] because the desire when cry
[6:49] just moved into our lives our desire is
[6:51] that he would be the one on display and
[6:56] it moves us were constrained by that and
[6:59] he goes on to say for whom who for whom
[7:02] I have suffered the loss of all things
[7:08] and do count them but dung that I may
[7:12] win Christ mine what a way to look at
[7:17] these things
[7:18] that nothing else matters except the
[7:21] excellency of Christ Jesus verse 9 let's
[7:24] go in let's go men amigo just a little
[7:26] further and be found in him not having
[7:31] mine own righteousness which is of the
[7:35] law but that which is through the faith
[7:38] of Christ the righteousness which is of
[7:41] God by faith that God has supplied get
[7:46] is it is not you or me that has made
[7:48] ourselves righteous but we are receiving
[7:51] his righteousness plus sickness in
[7:54] another place you know in the book of
[7:56] Romans where he says they going about to
[7:58] obtain their own righteousness have
[8:01] missed the righteousness of Christ the
[8:05] righteousness of Christ is not something
[8:08] that we can come to and finally we merit
[8:11] it no even to come to a place to where
[8:14] Christ himself takes us as his own is
[8:16] because he has released sufficient grace
[8:19] to bring us to that place of what love
[8:22] has called for hallelujah so it's his
[8:26] it's his grace his love that's working
[8:29] here Paul says look at this in verse 10
[8:32] that I may know him Paul already knew
[8:36] him but he wants to know him more that I
[8:39] may know him and the power of his
[8:42] resurrection and the Fellowship of his
[8:47] suffering ah I want to be a participant
[8:49] in his sufferings
[8:50] how can he say this because as a man and
[8:54] a woman do you take this man to be your
[8:56] lawful wedded husband to have and to
[8:58] hold for richer and
[9:00] poor in sickness and in health do you
[9:02] take him or do you take this woman do
[9:04] you do this not just in the good times
[9:08] and when everything's up and
[9:09] everything's going but you see this is a
[9:11] uniting being made look at this being
[9:20] made conformable unto his death pulsing
[9:25] now I want that same working that was
[9:27] within the groomer I wanted to work in
[9:29] me to bring me to the conformability
[9:33] to what he himself became obedient unto
[9:36] death even the death of the cross
[9:38] I want that to work in me to wear that I
[9:41] myself am so constrained think about how
[9:45] Paul himself had one walking around and
[9:47] these men are men of God these men are
[9:49] men of God and God allowed him to
[9:51] advertise but then Paul himself notice
[9:55] how the Prophet will put this here he
[9:57] picks it up and Christ the mystery of
[9:58] prisoner of love and he speaks of these
[10:00] things it's not something insignificant
[10:02] but he said notice how Paul himself
[10:05] wanted to speak to that spirit and
[10:08] remove that from there woman he said but
[10:10] he waited until God said do it you see
[10:18] it was he's a prisoner of love he was
[10:20] constrained by love when you constrained
[10:24] by love it's not about you it's about
[10:27] him oh my if by any means I might attain
[10:33] under the resurrection of the dead Paul
[10:36] speaking of that first resurrection
[10:38] blessed are the dead who die in the Lord
[10:41] were death hath no more a man not as
[10:45] though look at this not as though I had
[10:49] already attained either were already
[10:52] perfect these verses scripture I know
[10:57] we've read them so many times but
[10:58] they're still they still grips my heart
[11:00] I trusted grips your heart Paul was
[11:02] letting him know hey I'm not perfect how
[11:05] could he say that he cuz don't recognize
[11:07] I'm still here in this tabernacle I'm
[11:10] still here so God
[11:12] gotta work there's things that God is
[11:15] moving perfecting in my life but I
[11:20] follow after all glory be to God if that
[11:24] I may apprehend that for which also I am
[11:28] apprehended of Christ Jesus once laid
[11:31] hold on your life
[11:33] what's laid hold on my life our desires
[11:36] I follow after that the one who has laid
[11:39] hold on me I follow after that that I
[11:41] might apprehend that I may lay claim to
[11:46] him who has lay claim on me the Bible
[11:52] says it like this in Hebrews 10 verse 12
[11:54] verse 10 Hebrews 2:10 sorry for it
[11:58] became him for whom are all things and
[12:01] by whom are all things in bringing many
[12:03] sons unto glory to make the captain of
[12:06] their salvation perfect through
[12:09] sufferings let me just say this listen
[12:14] to me now he was the perfect Lamb of God
[12:18] Emanuel are you with me
[12:21] he was perfect there was no fault there
[12:23] was no flaw there was no blemish that's
[12:26] not what this is talking about but the
[12:28] completion the perfection of this
[12:32] journey is that he that is the captain
[12:35] might also be partaker of sufferings not
[12:42] just a Calvary but even as the Prophet
[12:45] would speak of that book that he read
[12:48] about the Prince of the house of David
[12:49] when he had seen that funeral and he
[12:51] says it's raised in that book somewhere
[12:53] he said I don't know whether it's so or
[12:55] true or not he said but that man when he
[12:57] said the Lord Jesus went over and it
[13:00] says he grown in himself having a
[13:04] headache and brother Dan always takes
[13:07] this part he says he didn't have to do
[13:10] that he didn't have to be sick he never
[13:13] had to experience weariness he didn't
[13:16] have to but you see God himself so
[13:19] subjecting it he's so subjected himself
[13:23] to where when he became one of us that
[13:25] he could saw I did
[13:26] fine with you and me and let me tell you
[13:31] something
[13:31] he saw identified with you and I he did
[13:33] not leave his body in the grave but he
[13:36] raised it up for our justification and
[13:38] he took it back to the throne and what
[13:40] is it it is a reminder when he walked
[13:44] here in humanity and he also releasing
[13:48] to us that same life that lived in that
[13:50] body and that that same life might be a
[13:53] faithful mediator in you and I so even
[13:58] when you don't know how to pray there's
[14:00] stains sometimes that come your way and
[14:02] your heart is so moved
[14:03] you don't even have words you might get
[14:05] up to pray and you set up I just don't
[14:07] see my knockin Preah I don't see like I
[14:09] got words can come out and and yet
[14:12] what's happening in the midst of it the
[14:13] spirit maketh intercession with
[14:16] groanings that cannot be honored
[14:20] hallelujah this was all made possible by
[14:25] the captain of our salvation glory be to
[14:31] God this was not one like that captain
[14:33] the Prophet talks about his little boy
[14:35] had just a sore throat and here was the
[14:37] man that had been crushed by the tank
[14:38] and hit man said they put that they put
[14:41] that captain's boy ahead of this man
[14:43] that had been a soldier that had been
[14:45] crushed by a tank and brother and said
[14:47] they put that little boy ahead
[14:48] they had a sore throat but this one he
[14:52] put our needs before his knees he didn't
[14:58] have to be sick he didn't have to
[15:01] experience temptation but he did for you
[15:06] and me or what dead of love I all that
[15:12] day on Calvary he was just one man
[15:16] the perfect man He gave His life and
[15:19] made an example for you now what must we
[15:23] do now the first thing I want to say is
[15:26] Jesus never lived for himself his life
[15:30] was spent for others now watch how watch
[15:35] how this comes through here that's
[15:37] perfectly eternal life
[15:40] when you say you go to church and you do
[15:43] good things that's fine
[15:45] what's how he's separating this going to
[15:49] church doing good things that's fine but
[15:53] that's not what we're talking about
[15:55] we're not just talking about going to
[15:58] church and doing good things that's fine
[16:01] but when you live your life to yourself
[16:06] you have an eternal life so a person
[16:10] could go to church do good things that's
[16:12] fine and still not living for others
[16:18] eternal life we're not serving him out
[16:21] of fear out of out of out of torment but
[16:25] our service to Him why we do what we do
[16:29] is because we love him grace is what he
[16:35] did for me works is what we do in
[16:40] appreciation for that grace that was
[16:44] given to us so the things that he would
[16:47] Express to us in his word it's not a
[16:50] question of you have to but it's has he
[16:53] expresses it we look at it and say yes
[16:56] Lord and then sometimes even later is
[16:58] where he makes known the meaning in a
[17:01] greater way of what we have already
[17:03] given ourselves to why why do you do
[17:07] that because you love him we love him
[17:11] it proves look at this because love love
[17:14] don't seek a reward it proved it you
[17:18] understand what I mean love don't seek a
[17:20] reward if you do something and then what
[17:24] if what if let's say yeah but the Joey
[17:27] brought some of those nice
[17:28] chocolate-covered strawberries to my
[17:29] house I'm not giving him a hint or
[17:32] anything like that but then let's say
[17:34] that you know I just forgot to even
[17:36] think him about or even mention
[17:38] something and then let's say that but
[17:42] Shane he brings some nice you see will
[17:48] say chocolate covered strawberries to
[17:49] keep it saying
[17:50] but the joint may have brought 12 of
[17:53] them Shane only brought three but all of
[17:56] a sudden I get up you know in that net
[17:57] and that service and I'll say you know I
[17:59] but saying I really appreciate you
[18:00] bringing him in strawberries by my house
[18:02] if you brothers need to know my garage
[18:04] code I'll give it to you I really
[18:07] appreciate that
[18:08] now let me ask you something if brother
[18:11] Joey out of that out of that there's a
[18:14] temptation that could come to say how do
[18:17] you think him he didn't think me but you
[18:19] see listen it's not saying the thought
[18:21] wouldn't come it's not saying the
[18:25] thought wouldn't come because the enemy
[18:28] look we are not ignorant of Satan's
[18:30] devices but the thing that brother joy
[18:36] what he what what would brother Joey do
[18:39] then in that point what would be the
[18:40] part to do to say you know what
[18:42] this time it forgets many times there's
[18:45] no doubt he just forgot but really could
[18:47] say I could tell by looking at him he
[18:49] had all 12 of them I know he enjoyed him
[18:53] you understand what I'm saying it's
[18:56] about love seeketh not her own love
[19:00] seeketh not her own
[19:03] it proved look at this eternal life is
[19:05] living for others it proved when it come
[19:08] to the Lamb of God in the Lamb of God he
[19:10] lived and had eternal life because he
[19:13] did not live for himself he lived for
[19:16] others and you receive eternal life by
[19:19] receiving that day and you don't live
[19:22] for yourself no more you live for others
[19:25] now watch how he places this living for
[19:27] others someone said how can you stand
[19:32] and let anybody call you such bad names
[19:36] you don't live for yourself you live for
[19:41] others that you might redeem that man
[19:51] force wander
[19:54] called that names or say other things
[19:56] hey there's a part about us that could
[19:59] get stirred up Obul to Samuel I've had
[20:03] the Holy Ghost for years I have to but
[20:06] you're blessed in get the Holy Ghost
[20:08] your spirit didn't get the Holy Ghost
[20:11] come on now don't listen friends don't
[20:14] sit here and say well I owe it no we
[20:16] don't always catch it
[20:19] we don't always catch it but he who has
[20:23] caught us catches us and he will direct
[20:27] us back to the sacrifice and remember
[20:31] directing us back to the sacrifice is
[20:33] the sacrificing of our own will which is
[20:36] the sacrificing of our own feelings that
[20:40] we might be the true sacrifice that I
[20:44] might redeem him how can you redeem you
[20:46] cannot redeem without a sacrifice
[20:49] there's no redemption without shedding
[20:52] of blood
[20:52] those same I'm gonna have to shed blood
[20:54] blood his life let me ask you a question
[21:02] how did you and I become lovable were
[21:06] you lovable was I lovable no thanks
[21:11] brother Brian he knew me before God got
[21:14] a hold me some of the rest you did too
[21:16] one lovable none of us were lovable none
[21:19] of us but who made you and I lovable he
[21:24] did he made us lovable as a matter of
[21:30] fact when we were dead and sin and
[21:33] trespasses the Bible tells us in the
[21:35] Book of Ezekiel he gave us a new heart
[21:40] and a new spirit he gave us a new spirit
[21:44] as the Prophet said because we could not
[21:47] even get along with ourselves much less
[21:51] with anybody else and then he placed his
[21:55] spirit in us by the new birth whoa he
[22:01] says
[22:03] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[22:07] the church has forgot they were sons
[22:13] your sons you're taking Christ place
[22:17] your son so don't live for yourself live
[22:21] for others well brother branham I can
[22:25] live for this brother because he sure is
[22:28] a nice man that's not it
[22:32] who easy to live for somebody who has a
[22:38] temperament like yours don't look at me
[22:42] strange now here within this just just
[22:45] our little group we are different there
[22:50] are so many differences in the way that
[22:52] we approach things and we think things
[22:54] and we go about things God has arranged
[22:57] all of that you know why because there's
[22:58] parts about us that need to be rubbed
[23:02] it's not about highlighting your
[23:04] temperament or my temperament as though
[23:06] oh this is so good it's stinking it's
[23:09] rotten it's no good but God will take
[23:13] something like that and he will use that
[23:17] to rub rub you rub me woo look what he
[23:31] says live for live for that man who
[23:37] hates you live for that person who'd
[23:42] kill you if they could that's what they
[23:46] done to him they killed him and he died
[23:54] that he might save them that's eternal
[23:57] life even when he was on the cross
[23:58] Father forgive them they don't know what
[24:02] they're doing
[24:06] my
[24:08] when you get it that's in your bosom
[24:11] you're facing heaven then but you
[24:13] sacrifice your own things
[24:15] give them up like the Sheep gives its
[24:18] wool you look on towards Calvary
[24:22] now you ever how many of you watch a
[24:25] sheep been shorn anybody ever watched a
[24:28] sheep where it's getting its wool take
[24:29] off okay well they've got little clips
[24:31] and little things out there some real
[24:33] interesting things that's on even on
[24:35] YouTube or other things out there where
[24:36] they've got men who actually they still
[24:38] do that for a living even in other
[24:40] countries and you know what that's sheep
[24:42] when it comes up there that sheep will
[24:45] come over to this side of the pen boom
[24:46] it'll go in that side and then it'll
[24:48] come over here but you know what those
[24:50] who are sharing it know how to handle it
[24:55] they take that sheep and put it into
[24:58] place to where the Sheep is not going to
[25:01] be injured but then when they put it in
[25:04] that place then the wall could be
[25:06] sheared off let me tell you something
[25:09] Almighty God is overseeing the shearing
[25:12] of our lives when he led the lamb to
[25:16] Calvary and the Bible speaks in Isaiah
[25:19] 53 he was led as a lamb dumb before her
[25:23] Shearer's showing our part in there it
[25:28] is him bringing oversight and what do we
[25:31] do in the midst of the shearing is to
[25:34] rest in his hands and he shears away the
[25:43] wool what is the wool the Wolves not
[25:45] something you manufacture it's produced
[25:49] by virtue of who you are and it's
[25:55] necessary that that will be removed from
[25:57] you because in that wool sometimes
[26:00] parasites can get in it not mud and dirt
[26:04] can get so into a place to where it can
[26:06] actually bind a sheep down to where they
[26:09] can't even get up out of the mud and so
[26:13] God says I need to shave and cut this
[26:16] part down because I want you
[26:19] to be able to move and respond to my
[26:22] call
[26:24] aren't you glad this isn't the devil
[26:27] that's got you and I in a pen and he's
[26:29] getting you an Isis I tell you what
[26:31] Joshua I'm a POW and no no no that's
[26:35] it's not the devil putting you and I in
[26:38] a in a hole no no no God is overseeing
[26:41] the trial and as they put those sheep
[26:43] down there and hold it over oh my there
[26:46] they position it in such a way even when
[26:49] they're teaching the men that are going
[26:50] to be taking over as apprentice and so
[26:53] forth in this they're showing them how
[26:55] to handle the sheep during this time I
[26:59] tell you that just makes me want to
[27:02] rejoice makes me want to cry to know his
[27:05] hands have never left me even when I'm
[27:09] in the midst of the trial in the
[27:10] shearing his hands are right there to
[27:13] make sure the less I would hurt myself
[27:21] you looked on towards Calvary he says
[27:24] look I focus you look on towards Calvary
[27:26] I said I hope this helps I hope this
[27:28] helps you to get in a place that's what
[27:31] the tabernacle speaking of locally says
[27:33] that's what all people has got to do is
[27:36] find out what you are and what's the
[27:40] purpose Church isn't going to church
[27:43] just to play music and sing songs church
[27:46] is a place where correction judgment
[27:49] begins at the house of God we must
[27:52] reckon ourselves dead and alive to
[27:56] Christ allowing the word to work in our
[28:01] life and the word will cut the word is a
[28:06] discerner of the thoughts and into the
[28:09] heart
[28:09] tenzin intents of the heart it separated
[28:12] as the bone and the moral it gets right
[28:15] down in there and brings a separation
[28:17] because there's sometimes friends we and
[28:19] ourselves as much as we would have and
[28:22] as we can look in the word but sometimes
[28:24] God has to come right down and bring a
[28:26] separation for something that we are
[28:29] united and standing with and God has to
[28:31] say
[28:32] it's not my mind that's not my attitude
[28:35] That's not me he has to separate that
[28:40] and he knows if he can make himself
[28:43] known and point that out than he has the
[28:46] Shepherd his sheep which he knows my
[28:48] Mane will unite with him he made a way
[28:54] that we could sacrifice ourselves aren't
[28:56] you glad he made a way through his
[28:58] sacrifice he made a way that you and I
[29:01] might sacrifice to his service to follow
[29:04] him if we follow him we lead the life
[29:07] that he led second Corinthians 4:6 let
[29:11] me move on here for God who commanded
[29:14] the light to shine out of darkness has
[29:16] shined in our hearts to give the light
[29:18] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[29:20] the face of Jesus Christ but we have
[29:23] this treasure in earthen vessels that's
[29:29] that's frail that earthen means frail
[29:32] jars of clay that the excellency of the
[29:36] power may be of God and not of us
[29:39] everybody knows us what everybody in
[29:41] here knows what a clay pot is you take a
[29:44] clay pot and it could be very beautiful
[29:46] or even when you look at a flower pot if
[29:48] you drop that it's gonna break if you
[29:52] even set it down too hard it's gonna
[29:54] break you see the Lord Himself he treats
[29:58] you and I as a loving husband that we
[30:02] are the weaker vessel
[30:05] so as an earthen vessel notice this here
[30:08] we are troubled look at this in verse
[30:11] eight we are troubled on every side yet
[30:16] not distressed we are perplexed but not
[30:21] in despair persecuted but not forsaken
[30:26] cast down but not destroyed always
[30:30] bearing about in the body the dying of
[30:36] the Lord Jesus I want you to think of
[30:38] this scripture always bearing about not
[30:41] it's there's not a moment there's not a
[30:43] time that is to go by
[30:45] we're not bearing about we're always
[30:47] bearing about carrying about in our body
[30:51] the dying of the Lord Jesus what was the
[30:55] dying of the Lord Jesus listen friends
[30:57] it's just like we looked at on Sunday if
[30:59] all that we do is look at Calvary we
[31:01] miss the dying that was taking place all
[31:04] along he was dying to his own will to
[31:09] serve fully the purpose of God
[31:14] death is not at just an event it is a
[31:19] process it's true we must die to be born
[31:23] again but through that death and that
[31:25] new birth then releases you and I to a
[31:28] place that we can die to his purpose be
[31:33] served always bearing about always
[31:37] sometimes here we are you come out of a
[31:40] wonderful service and here you are a
[31:42] Friday morning my just thinking about
[31:45] the service or on Monday morning or
[31:47] maybe don't even make it to Monday
[31:48] morning and all of a sudden something
[31:52] transpires or takes place you receive
[31:55] something in the mail and you check the
[31:57] mail yesterday but the bill or whatever
[32:00] that should have come to you went to
[32:02] your neighbor and now it comes to you
[32:06] and all and when you're looking at
[32:09] whatever you're looking at her
[32:10] whatever it comes here are you in the
[32:12] midst of it and you know you think what
[32:15] in the world is going on you know
[32:17] brother Branham said it like this in the
[32:20] message why Christ speak he says
[32:22] speaking of where the children of Israel
[32:25] came down to the Red Sea he said you
[32:27] watch after a good service he said where
[32:30] the glory of God has begun to fall among
[32:33] the people of God he said Satan then is
[32:36] permitted to come right among them to
[32:40] try to do what deaden or take away from
[32:43] what God has done but remember what has
[32:47] been brought to you and I what is
[32:49] ministered what is brought here is not
[32:51] with enticing words of man's wisdom
[32:54] because that will fade but that your
[32:57] faith might
[32:58] and then the power of God oh you might
[33:00] you might be falter in one place and why
[33:02] is this going on but then God can move
[33:05] right down and say but remember I have
[33:07] spoken to you their faith is standing in
[33:13] the power of God of that visitation just
[33:15] like Moses at a visitation at the
[33:18] burning bush you had a visitation always
[33:22] always always always when do we rests we
[33:27] rest beyond the river always bearing
[33:32] about in the body the dying of the Lord
[33:35] Jesus why that the life also of Jesus
[33:40] might be made manifest in our body in
[33:47] our body
[33:48] look when we speak a body soma when we
[33:51] speak of body this entails all of our
[33:53] emotions all of our feelings everything
[33:56] that is associated therewith for we
[34:00] which live look at this hour
[34:03] alway delivered unto death for our
