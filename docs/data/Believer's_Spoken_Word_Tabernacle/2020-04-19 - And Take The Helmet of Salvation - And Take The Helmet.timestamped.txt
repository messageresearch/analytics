[25:03] Oh
[25:05] [Music]
[25:18] holy
[25:23] Oh
[25:43] blessed be the name of the Lord amen we
[25:47] certainly want to just read each and
[25:49] every one of you in the name of the Lord
[25:51] Jesus Christ and I just want to say we
[25:58] so appreciate all of the prayers and
[26:01] your support yesterday in the service
[26:06] that we had there the memorial service
[26:09] for brother herb and I certainly there
[26:13] was a lot of many things that we could
[26:16] say at that time and her brother herb
[26:21] that was not it was something that we
[26:24] all want when it comes down to if broad
[26:27] carries and our crossing we want our
[26:29] life the funeral to have already been
[26:32] preached it makes it very easy because
[26:35] then when that is when it is done in
[26:37] that manner then it's remember when the
[26:41] Holy Spirit has come into our life he's
[26:44] come for a purpose and that is to anoint
[26:48] the word in our life that it might be
[26:50] expressed jesus said that all men would
[26:54] know that you are written epistles of me
[26:57] Paul would say that that revelation
[27:00] that's in our heart in our heart but God
[27:04] has put in our heart that same
[27:06] revelation has been preached and as
[27:08] moved into the body so it's it's God
[27:12] that is working in our lives and let me
[27:16] just say it clearly just as much as we
[27:18] can take examples in the scripture of
[27:21] the different ones of Gideon of David on
[27:24] and on remember they were mortal men
[27:27] subject to like passions such as we are
[27:30] what it is we take confidence in is that
[27:34] a mortal that even those who were
[27:36] looking and living under a sacrifice by
[27:39] revelation looking unto that sacrifice
[27:42] which was to come but yet they live in
[27:44] the victory of by the revelation that
[27:47] was given to them in that time they were
[27:49] also
[27:50] missiles that we can take and weakens
[27:53] point out the gospel living in their
[27:56] life and that's a blessing this is the
[27:58] same thing that within our lives we want
[28:00] our lives to be that of written epistles
[28:03] we are where we're not as we say Gideon
[28:07] did this Daniel did this Paul did this
[28:09] we want to be able to have our name
[28:10] there because it's not us that's doing
[28:12] it the excellency is not of us the
[28:15] excellency is of the power of God that
[28:16] dwells inside these earthen vessels so
[28:19] we're not glorifying flesh we're
[28:21] glorifying God but as to show that the
[28:23] same God that is Jehovah of the hold is
[28:26] Jesus of the new the same God in the
[28:29] past is the same God in the present
[28:31] you'll be if there is a tomorrow there's
[28:33] another hour so we we take those times
[28:36] in that moment there's a life that has
[28:39] been lived here before us and we thank
[28:41] God for the testimony of Jesus Christ
[28:45] through the life of brother herb so much
[28:47] that he has meant to us as an assembly
[28:51] as for many just as the Lord would allow
[28:55] allowed us to do for brother Bill and
[28:58] sister Mary and be able to point that
[29:01] out they didn't ask me to do that but I
[29:02] think it's fitting in those times and
[29:06] even with brother herb I was just really
[29:08] being pressed in that way because there
[29:11] are things that these were lives and
[29:13] when I look at it you you you brother's
[29:15] going to be seated just a moment there's
[29:17] not a whole lot it's just a couple of
[29:18] brothers that are here but the thing is
[29:22] is that when we look at it I just was
[29:24] just really meditating on the things
[29:26] because if you watch the funeral
[29:29] yesterday
[29:30] you hear the things that was brought out
[29:32] about brother herb ancestor Joe together
[29:35] because they were one in that vision and
[29:38] that that burden and I believe that's an
[29:40] example from that and that I had
[29:44] preached not only from ecstatic to those
[29:46] examples that I see but from the
[29:47] experience in my heart you want to be
[29:52] united to be married to someone who
[29:55] shares the same passion
[29:57] in the things of the Lord when you're
[30:00] not gonna marry you know my wife didn't
[30:02] marry somebody was perfect she didn't
[30:04] marry somebody that only that you know
[30:06] as always maybe the you know everything
[30:08] is just easy here and there and neither
[30:10] deny we are we are different people but
[30:13] God put us together and within that it's
[30:16] the same thing that God it's together we
[30:19] are helpers together to serve the
[30:22] purpose of God in this earth and that's
[30:24] the real blessing and so when we see
[30:27] that I look at how God put things
[30:29] together like a great puzzle I was
[30:31] thinking we're brother Bill and sister
[30:32] Mary if you took brother Bill and sister
[30:34] Mary and you took brother herb and
[30:36] sister Joe and you tried to look at them
[30:39] you would say well there's certain
[30:40] things brother Bill and sister Mary did
[30:42] and brother herb and sister Jo
[30:44] it wasn't exactly in in that manner but
[30:46] you see when you look at the Tabernacle
[30:48] in the wilderness not everybody had Onyx
[30:50] stones not everybody had goats hairs not
[30:53] everybody had the deal him nope not
[30:56] everybody had Jasper not everybody had
[30:58] Onyx not everybody had those but who had
[31:01] him when the vision came remember Moses
[31:04] was caught up in that cloud in the
[31:06] vision and when he came and unfolded
[31:08] that vision there remember it was to
[31:10] make a place for the coming of the Lord
[31:12] that his coming might come right among
[31:14] them by his presence and when that
[31:17] happened then we find that the people
[31:20] the what God had already placed in their
[31:23] hearts then under that vision that
[31:25] inspiration that's coming out it
[31:27] releases what is in there and you just
[31:29] find places just coming into its
[31:31] position this is why brother Bram would
[31:33] tell us in God's gifts always find their
[31:35] place he spoke of how that each one of
[31:38] those kings coming from the different
[31:41] places and they were walking under the
[31:43] vision and of Revelation that Daniel had
[31:47] expressed to them when Daniel was there
[31:49] and they were coming and how that they
[31:51] brought their gifts and every one of
[31:53] their gifts go all three of them were
[31:55] different but all three of them came
[31:57] together for one purpose and that was to
[32:00] glorify the Living God that was in their
[32:03] myths and that's the same thing when I
[32:06] look at this of how God puts a body
[32:08] together it takes God to
[32:10] put a body of believers together it
[32:14] takes God to keep us in harmony with him
[32:16] and harmony with one another because we
[32:19] realized the enemy is always at work to
[32:21] try to break harmony trying to break
[32:23] unity and the Satan is always at work
[32:26] and we can never ever let down our guard
[32:29] upon that but I think that it's just
[32:32] such a a great a blessing when I look at
[32:36] that and there's many that you know that
[32:38] where I can speak of these things but
[32:40] some that I have that the Lord has just
[32:42] inspired on my heart these were not just
[32:45] pillars in the Assembly where as solid
[32:48] foundation and others can look to in
[32:51] their lives and see Jesus Christ solid
[32:54] people but it's also those that were
[32:57] part the foundation they were right here
[32:59] within the the vision and the burden
[33:02] really from the beginning God putting
[33:04] things in their hearts to do and I know
[33:06] there's many when I I think of it over
[33:09] the time it's getting fewer and fewer
[33:13] those that were of the original ones
[33:15] that were here and we never we never we
[33:19] would be we would be hon when trying to
[33:22] find the words we would be completely
[33:24] wrong if we tried to feel somebody
[33:27] else's shoes but to remember it's God
[33:30] who gives the burden and the God who
[33:32] gave the burden God's work God will
[33:34] always give the burden and he gives the
[33:36] strength for the work to continue on
[33:38] until he comes and so I think God when I
[33:42] you know I think God when I think around
[33:45] and I think these things have to be
[33:49] expressed at times we need to know it's
[33:51] not lifting anybody up but it's for a
[33:53] you and I if any of you have not taken
[33:57] in that consideration and asked Lord
[33:59] what would you have me do let me say
[34:01] this first of all first of all make sure
[34:05] before you ask him what you would have
[34:07] me do make sure that you know it is him
[34:10] that is in you that's the first thing
[34:13] the first thing God would have you to do
[34:15] is surrender your life let him be the
[34:18] lord of your life because you just don't
[34:19] want to be a worker because salvation is
[34:22] not based on words
[34:23] Redemption is not based on words the
[34:26] love of God is not released to us based
[34:28] on words but we want to have that real
[34:31] faith that living reality on the inside
[34:34] and then as that moves in our hearts
[34:37] remember the same God that moves in our
[34:39] hearts is the same God that Commission's
[34:42] us and directs us to be able to fulfill
[34:44] whatever purpose that he has called us
[34:46] to and that in itself will be even an
[34:50] expression if Paul would express it in
[34:53] different places of that it is Christ
[34:55] that's working within us Paul would say
[34:57] he worketh in me mightily there are
[34:59] times that no doubt that for every one
[35:02] of us there's times where you when God
[35:04] has put a burden in your heart there's
[35:06] times the flesh doesn't feel like doing
[35:08] it but when God puts a burden there the
[35:12] it there is something that is greater
[35:14] than all flesh and it prevails there's
[35:19] always the the pressure and the things
[35:21] that come around it like we know and
[35:23] brother branham I I read in the
[35:24] different places in the message where
[35:26] brother Branham himself he was gonna
[35:27] call up to Chicago and he was just going
[35:30] to let brother Bo say no I'm not gonna
[35:33] be able to make it and brother Branham
[35:35] I'm just reading this in the message
[35:36] this week brother Branham he he finally
[35:39] he said you know there was just a war
[35:41] going on and he said what I what finally
[35:44] is he said it dropped he said that inner
[35:46] man on the inside it said but you told
[35:49] brother bulls a you would be there and
[35:52] so brother Branham said I just got in he
[35:55] left after midnight it's so pressing you
[35:58] know he was settled in during the day
[35:59] I'm not going but after midnight they
[36:01] kept moving in his heart you see what it
[36:03] was it was God moving because there are
[36:06] no that would be people who would be
[36:08] there brother Branham was the channel it
[36:10] was not brother Branham that that moved
[36:12] to heal them our healing was already
[36:14] done before the foundation of the world
[36:16] Calvary just just allows even the
[36:19] further expression and bringing that
[36:20] real to us that's what the message of
[36:23] the hour come to do is unfold the
[36:25] revelation of Jesus Christ where where
[36:27] the vultures and buzzards had picked it
[36:30] away and picked away the original
[36:31] sacrifice but God in this hour in the
[36:35] promise of his word there is a son of
[36:37] Baberaham a seed of Abraham that rises
[36:40] up and through a rushing mighty wind it
[36:42] comes down and shoes away the vultures
[36:45] and the revelation of Jesus Christ is
[36:48] restored to the Church of the Living God
[36:50] so this these sometimes those battles
[36:54] and the things that we go through yet
[36:57] you find that what it is God it's God's
[37:00] purpose being served and worked out in
[37:03] our life and and every one of us there's
[37:05] not there's no big eyes there's no
[37:07] little use and so I want to say you know
[37:12] for each and every one of you please
[37:14] continue to keep the Keithley family in
[37:17] prayer sister Rita and and and those
[37:20] keep them in prayer and we just want to
[37:25] say we love you and we we certainly miss
[37:28] each and every one of you we've just
[37:32] with my heart I I miss I mean the
[37:36] anointing has not been any less when
[37:39] I've been ministering or preaching the
[37:40] word as a matter of fact it's been a
[37:42] very great anointing that has come down
[37:44] in these services here but I I miss
[37:47] seeing you and even even in the part of
[37:50] not just you sitting in pews but I just
[37:53] missed the part of what we're able just
[37:54] to set and talk and and fellowship and
[37:57] just to see that's the thing that is in
[38:00] my heart to me if it's the hardest thing
[38:02] the hardest thing is not about that I
[38:04] can't go to a restaurant and anything
[38:06] else that that's not it at all it's not
[38:08] that my coffee shops not open that you
[38:10] know those things are not in what it is
[38:13] at all it's the people of God and that's
[38:16] truly where my heart is at and I think I
[38:18] think God that we have a great provision
[38:22] and I want to admonish you as it as an
[38:24] assembly there are things that have
[38:27] already been reading over different
[38:29] things of certain guidelines the
[38:30] government and different things they're
[38:32] putting out and just trying to find the
[38:35] leading of the Lord looking at some of
[38:36] those things but I want you and I want I
[38:40] want you to be very much in prayer and I
[38:43] want you to be very much in prayer and
[38:45] and be wise about this
[38:47] I want you to be in prayer that God
[38:50] would inspire them to come up with a
[38:54] treatment a vaccine and you say why
[38:57] would you say that well we know that all
[38:59] healing comes from the Lord but I want
[39:01] you understand there's people that would
[39:03] never come to a place and ask prayer and
[39:05] even if we did say the Lord Jesus Christ
[39:08] he heals all our diseases they would say
[39:10] I don't believe in that but God in His
[39:13] love would still provide medicine and
[39:16] yet it's not the medicine that heals you
[39:20] see even for the atheist who doesn't
[39:22] believe in God life is the healer in his
[39:25] body it's already there it's already
[39:28] standing there there's already
[39:30] testimonies even of the atheists or
[39:32] infidel that gets sick and it gets a cut
[39:34] and then it's in and then it is restored
[39:36] what is that that's a testimony you
[39:38] don't have to look at a tree don't have
[39:40] to look at birds don't have to look at
[39:42] nature it's right there in his life if
[39:44] he only can recognize it life is the
[39:47] healer but we know that these things
[39:50] that I've asked you to pray for and I
[39:51] remind you brother Branham was very
[39:53] thankful when they came up with the salt
[39:57] vaccine for polio he thanked God for it
[40:00] because of all the death that had been
[40:02] going on brother Branham would also tell
[40:06] us he said the doctors are God's agents
[40:10] he would also go on to tell us within
[40:14] there of how that he prayed every day he
[40:17] said for medical science and for cure
[40:19] I'm saying these things like this
[40:21] because sometimes these aren't quotes
[40:23] and statements that every that that can
[40:25] be said but you know what those
[40:27] statements are not any statements that
[40:29] lessen faith faith is that you know
[40:32] where you're standing faith is not
[40:35] something we're trying to put on a show
[40:36] or prove to somebody it's where we know
[40:38] where we're standing and so brother
[40:41] Branham would say that he would pray
[40:42] that that would move because why when
[40:46] we're looking at this here without them
[40:49] having some ground the government's and
[40:51] the other agencies and others other
[40:53] things you find that some of these
[40:56] restrictions and tightening and all
[40:58] those things it some of it will
[41:00] not be loosened and relaxed and I want
[41:03] you to keep in mind as a congregation
[41:05] you know where I've stood you know what
[41:07] I've ministered here and I admonish
[41:09] every one of you don't try to link
[41:12] quotes and things together if God hasn't
[41:15] entrusted you to handle the word in that
[41:16] way then don't try to do it just be a
[41:19] simple Christian believing the Lord
[41:22] loving the Lord and watching for God's
[41:25] word to come to past because as long as
[41:28] we're here remember we're not praying
[41:30] for Sodom we are praying that God would
[41:33] relieve lot out of Sodom judgment is
[41:36] here are you with me
[41:38] see this is what the wisdom and the
[41:40] understanding of the love the revelation
[41:43] of Jesus Christ it does it's not just an
[41:45] unfolding of of their of just of
[41:50] doctrine and Justin it unfolds the very
[41:52] nature of Jesus Christ and that was one
[41:56] of the things that the Prophet would
[41:57] speak in 1962 the message all things he
[42:00] said that the coming and the opening of
[42:03] these seals he said what will it do it
[42:05] will unfold the very nature of Jesus
[42:08] Christ to us and that's exactly what the
[42:12] opening of the seals have done it has
[42:14] unfolded the very nature of Jesus Christ
[42:17] who is the true atonement who is our
[42:20] Passover lamb so much has been said I've
[42:24] not even begin to preach yet this
[42:26] morning but I just wanted to share those
[42:29] things with you I have just a great a
[42:32] burden upon my heart that we would pray
[42:36] with in that manner I've been talking
[42:39] with different ones that here among us
[42:41] that have worked some of the brothers
[42:43] that work with in the medical field
[42:45] checking on them asking how they're
[42:47] doing because I know they're in the
[42:48] front lines they're seeing these things
[42:50] every day they're having to go in upon
[42:53] these things dealing with cases and so
[42:54] forth so we want to continue to remember
[42:57] each and every one in prayer and our
[43:00] faith and our confidence is in the Lord
[43:02] Jesus Christ I believe with all my heart
[43:05] that's soon and very soon we're going to
[43:08] see the king amen
[43:11] you know you might say a person could
[43:13] say but Samuel they were
[43:14] saying that 25 years ago but it's closer
[43:19] amen our salvation as Paul would say in
[43:22] Romans 13 our salvation is nearer now
[43:25] than when we first believed amen
[43:30] Abraham you were saying that same thing
[43:32] 23 years ago but I'm closer now
[43:36] hallelujah oh my in the Lord wonderful
[43:42] amen well we we just want to say we love
[43:45] you I I just
[43:48] we really just miss you I can't I just
[43:51] can't wait to be able to see each and
[43:54] every one of you and we just want to
[43:57] come around the the word of the Lord
[43:59] this morning and just to see and and
[44:03] look that God would speak to our hearts
[44:05] we've got with we have have needs in our
[44:09] lives and some of these things that
[44:11] we're going to speak on here this
[44:13] morning and we're going to read I feel I
[44:18] feel in my heart that these very things
[44:20] as we move in on this a little bit it's
[44:23] great it's very pertinent to the moments
[44:25] that we are in the gospel is always
[44:28] relative because Jesus Christ is the
[44:30] same yesterday today and forever but
[44:33] when I look within these times and
[44:35] situations and I just meditate upon many
[44:39] of these things that I've had before me
[44:41] here over the months and I thought now
[44:44] God is just it opens to where to speak
[44:47] on this but I believe this morning if
[44:49] the Lord will help us you will see and I
[44:52] trust you would inspire it to your heart
[44:54] I trust that if there's any life that
[44:56] doesn't know him you will be so
[44:58] compelled in your heart to surrender
[45:01] your life to the Lord let him become the
[45:03] lord of your life and I trust that for
[45:05] each and every one of us that within the
[45:07] challenges that we are facing and will
[45:10] face that this message would be a
[45:13] message of direction it would be a
[45:15] comfort it would give us leadership for
[45:18] even those things that we are currently
[45:21] facing and will be facing so without any
[45:24] further ado here this morning I'm just
[45:27] going to read
[45:28] scripture and it's just out of Ephesians
[45:31] chapter 6 we are dealing with that of
[45:33] the whole armor of God the admonition of
[45:36] the Spirit of God from the Prophet he
[45:39] when he expresses the thought in the
[45:43] Philadelphian church age Jesus comes in
[45:46] the time of trouble and right after that
[45:48] that particular paragraph he goes in to
[45:53] say let us hold fast those things which
[45:58] he has given behold I come quickly and
[46:01] remember he said take unto you the whole
[46:04] armour of God use every weapon that he's
[46:07] given us and use every gift that he's
[46:12] given us verse 17 of roman of ephesians
[46:16] 6 and take the helmet of salvation and
[46:21] the sword of the Spirit which is the
[46:23] word of God heavenly father we look to
[46:28] you this morning we ask that God that
[46:30] you would come and just anoint our
[46:33] hearts and ears to hear your word is
[46:37] already anointed Lord we just ask that
[46:40] God that you would come and make it
[46:43] alive or God and and just unfolding to
[46:46] us Lord those very things that we have
[46:48] need of and may we recognize God your
[46:52] presence may you visit every home visit
[46:56] every heart Lord visit every life we
[46:59] pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[47:02] amen
[47:04] we want to look at that thought and take
[47:07] the helmet of salvation now we've looked
[47:09] at this a few different services now and
[47:14] it's been very much spread out and but I
[47:18] want to just move into this here and the
[47:21] Lord will help us try to close this part
[47:24] of it up here this morning if we could
[47:27] say it like that you find that Paul
[47:30] where we had been the last time Paul was
[47:34] dealing with where as children of light
[47:37] versus that
[47:39] of within darkness and and Paul would
[47:43] write of this of the coming of the Lord
[47:45] and he would write it within this manner
[47:48] and say in first Thessalonians five six
[47:51] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[47:54] that means be slothful we're and even in
[47:57] our minds everything just yet is kind of
[47:59] numb you're not awake to the awake to
[48:03] the realization of what is among us but
[48:06] let us watch and be sober this is these
[48:09] are things we've got to be intentional
[48:12] about for they that sleep sleep in the
[48:15] night and they that be drunken are
[48:18] drunken in the night and there's a
[48:20] darkness that's upon this earth now it's
[48:23] a darkness like it was in the time of
[48:25] Goshen where it said it was a darkness
[48:27] that could be felt you can feel the
[48:31] powers of darkness that are around us
[48:34] but he says let us who are of the day
[48:38] see the Spirit of God in our hearts it
[48:41] is the Herald it's heralding them the
[48:44] day straw has arose in our heart it's
[48:46] heralding there is a new day dawning let
[48:52] us who are of that day of the revelation
[48:55] of Jesus Christ
[48:57] walking because of his appearing to us
[49:00] he says be sober that means be calm
[49:04] collected in your mind putting on the
[49:08] breastplate of faith and love and
[49:10] foreign helmet the hope of salvation for
[49:13] God hath not this is where look at this
[49:17] for God hath not appointed us to wrath
[49:21] that's not our destiny but to obtain
[49:25] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who
[49:29] died for us that whether we wake or
[49:32] sleep we should live together with him
[49:35] if I could summarize those scriptures in
[49:38] one verse it would or in one statement
[49:41] it would be of this expect victory
[49:46] and there is no losing or lost to a
[49:50] believer because in Christ there is no
[49:55] loss so we expect victory so just as we
[50:03] are to walk from faith to faith
[50:06] that's how God's righteousness is
[50:08] revealed just as the the the word is
[50:12] unfolded by the Spirit of God from glory
[50:14] unto glory
[50:15] so in our lives are we to walk from
[50:19] victory unto victory and these are
[50:22] things that we realize as the admonition
[50:27] by the Spirit of God we are not saying
[50:29] it in terms that we can just be careless
[50:32] about it no you see that in the land
[50:35] when Joshua and them went in the land
[50:37] the very moment they got a little
[50:39] relaxed got a little careless didn't
[50:41] check things with the word the way they
[50:43] ought to they end up making peace pacts
[50:45] with people that they should not have
[50:47] made peace pacts with they got a little
[50:50] relaxed and got well we don't need
[50:51] everybody for AI well we don't if they
[50:54] forgot in a minute you didn't feat
[50:56] Jericho because you had a great number
[50:58] of people God came on the scene and
[51:00] moved down for Jericho you see sometimes
[51:02] it's our own the fresh man around us
[51:08] where you sometimes we can get so
[51:09] confident yet it's we know it's God
[51:12] moving through us but let us always
[51:14] remember God moved through us because we
[51:17] were able to get out of the way
[51:19] it's not because we were doing we were
[51:20] doing it we were conscience I need to
[51:23] decrease so the Scriptures go on within
[51:27] this a victory and I'm just going to run
[51:29] through or read now some scriptures and
[51:33] I want you to take these things and let
[51:35] them be compiled as as admonition in
[51:39] your heart in John 16:33
[51:41] here is the Lord Jesus here on just some
[51:45] time before his departure he says um
[51:48] these things have I spoken unto you that
[51:51] in me you might have peace in the world
[51:55] you shall have tribulation
[51:58] it's a paradox in that you're in the
[52:01] midst of tribulation but yet you're in
[52:03] him in peace it's a paradox but be of
[52:07] good cheer ah notice I have overcome the
[52:12] world
[52:13] now that same eye that was welling there
[52:17] behind the veil now expresses John 4:4
[52:23] here of God little children and have
[52:25] overcome them because greater stronger
[52:28] mightier is he that is in you than he
[52:32] that's in the world in 1st John 5 for
[52:36] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[52:39] world and this is the victory that
[52:43] overcometh the world even our faith
[52:49] remember without faith it's impossible
[52:51] to please God God works on our faith but
[52:58] the random would say it in different
[52:59] times he says let God coming up a rate
[53:01] on your faith and raise it to the level
[53:04] it needs to be remember it is our faith
[53:08] jesus said I'm for the healing be it
[53:12] unto you according to your faith you see
[53:14] he comes to strengthen our faith lifts
[53:18] up our faith and so it is now his faith
[53:22] that moves behind our faith brother
[53:24] Branham would say he said when you can
[53:26] get your faith and my faith he said and
[53:29] then we can get an agreement then he
[53:31] said the faith of God will move behind
[53:34] our faith and will bring the results
[53:37] this is where the results as Paul would
[53:41] write in Galatians 2:20 I am crucified
[53:43] with Christ nevertheless I live yet not
[53:46] i but Christ liveth in me and the life
[53:51] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[53:56] the faith of the Son of God it's
[53:58] important now he didn't live a different
[54:00] life but now it's different by the faith
[54:04] of the Son of God who loved me and gave
[54:06] himself for me
[54:07] in Philippians 4:13 I can
[54:11] do all things through Christ which
[54:14] strengtheneth me Romans 8:37 nay and all
[54:21] these things we are more than conquerors
[54:23] gaining a surpassing victory through him
[54:26] that loved us Hebrews 10:23 let us hold
[54:33] fast the profession of our faith that
[54:35] word faith there is the same word hope
[54:38] of salvation the same word hope it's
[54:41] that of an expectation where we have
[54:44] received a deposit there and the faith
[54:47] is looking and saying it's already mine
[54:50] and so there's an expectation so let us
[54:55] hold fast the profession of our faith
[54:58] which it's the word hope that's actually
[55:00] used there in the Greek without wavering
[55:04] for he is faithful that promised who is
[55:10] he is now in that scripture that we read
[55:17] and take the helmet of salvation
[55:21] brother Brandon would pick this up in
[55:23] greatest battle ever fought and he says
[55:26] now that's the mind in here the head it
[55:31] covers over the head that's what the
[55:34] helmet does he says now how are you
[55:38] going to let this helmet it's a
[55:40] protection what is a helmet made out of
[55:44] brass and I want you to take these
[55:46] things will be moving upon these here a
[55:49] helmet is made of brass brass can't even
[55:54] be tempered it's hard harder than iron
[55:59] brass speaks of judgment there's got to
[56:05] be something of the protection in our
[56:09] lives that's stronger than anything
[56:15] greater is he my dear is he stronger if
[56:19] he that is in you
[56:21] a brass a brass headpiece the salvation
[56:27] knowledge of knowing this this is not
[56:31] knowledge as far as just facts but it's
[56:35] a knowledge of knowing this knowing
[56:37] means by experience the Greeks look at
[56:42] knowledge and want me to say Gentiles
[56:45] look at it it's accumulation of facts
[56:48] that will never do it's got to be
[56:54] unknowing knowing meaning has it is
[56:58] wrote there and express that thought of
[57:02] knowledge among that of the Hebrews of
[57:05] the Jews is to be one know something
[57:09] only when it becomes a practical at
[57:13] working in their life that's what the
[57:17] knowledge we're speaking of we we wreck
[57:21] it's got to be something that we know
[57:24] down on the inside
[57:28] knowing this my healing comes from God
[57:32] my salvation comes from God my
[57:36] experience matches his word not the
[57:41] church's idea the word and man he said
[57:44] you know covered over with the
[57:46] protection the helmet of salvation its
[57:49] deliverance
[57:53] why would you need deliverance because
[57:56] we come into situations time and time
[57:59] again we need deliverance in trials and
[58:05] tests Paul we remember we we ministered
[58:08] on this the last time Paul never in the
[58:10] ship Paul was in tests and trials in the
[58:13] prisons three different times he was
[58:15] there in in situations arising but God
[58:19] brought deliverance and Paul would bring
[58:21] it to such a place he didn't name off
[58:23] the name he said he delivered me out of
[58:26] the mouth of the lion and he that
[58:28] delivered me shall also deliver us see
[58:33] as a believer and once you've been
[58:35] delivered how can you not expect a
[58:38] difference because you make which you
[58:41] have received that of the new birth and
[58:43] the Holy Ghost has accepted you you have
[58:46] received the paramount of deliverance it
[58:49] is by that deliverance that you expect
[58:53] every other deliverance because you
[58:54] realize that though we walk in this
[58:57] world I'm not of this world and the
[58:59] forces and the pressures that we face
[59:01] around us this is supernatural and we
[59:04] need the supernatural God in our lives
[59:08] that gives us strength and to expect
[59:10] delivered I no matter what the situation
[59:13] looks like we look to the Lord
[59:19] your deliverance notice what he says now
[59:24] take that take what knowing this then go
[59:30] marching forward oh that's what we're
[59:35] supposed to do so this reality of the
[59:40] Living God as a helmet of salvation you
[59:43] see it's not just about knowing the word
[59:48] we need to know the promises of God that
[59:52] belong to us there's certain things I
[59:56] remember when years ago about eight
[59:59] years ago or so or seven whenever it was
[1:00:02] it went down there and I had purchased a
[1:00:06] car and around the cat in there after an
[1:00:08] area a used vehicle and I went in and
[1:00:11] you know to me it was I was looking at
[1:00:13] at the price with the price that I
[1:00:15] wanted and then where the mileage was at
[1:00:17] and the guy handed me a little key fob
[1:00:19] and on that key fob well I know one
[1:00:21] unlocking lock means I know okay this I
[1:00:25] could see it says open the trunk
[1:00:26] got that what's this little button up
[1:00:28] here and the guy looked at me he said
[1:00:32] here let me have it so he took it and he
[1:00:36] walked right over there and stood at the
[1:00:38] window and he he said now watch this
[1:00:41] he beat the horn twice in a row and then
[1:00:43] he pressed on that button and it came on
[1:00:45] I said you mean that has an auto starter
[1:00:48] on it now for me you know I was teaching
[1:00:51] school at the time and that was a great
[1:00:53] blessing in the wintertime because I
[1:00:55] could look right out my window and go
[1:00:57] dig deep room started up so for me I
[1:01:02] didn't know I had it I could have been
[1:01:04] looking at something but I needed
[1:01:07] somebody to take something that was
[1:01:10] already there and make it real to me
[1:01:15] that's why we need the operation of the
[1:01:18] Holy Spirit this is why the Prophet
[1:01:21] would take such tests such pains and I
[1:01:24] and I'm saying it was brother branham's
[1:01:26] huh his will but I'm saying God moved
[1:01:29] him to instruct
[1:01:31] in the revelation of Jesus Christ to say
[1:01:34] you need to pray for revelation more
[1:01:38] than anything else he said if it seems
[1:01:44] to be beyond you look up and ask God for
[1:01:47] it we are meant to walk by revelation so
[1:01:54] it's where these things are made real to
[1:01:59] us and this is why that you and I the
[1:02:02] pulsations that move within our heart is
[1:02:06] that his salvation is perfect and
[1:02:09] complete he is my deliverer no matter
[1:02:14] the circumstance or the obstacle even
[1:02:17] when I cannot see
[1:02:21] I have victory come on now he doesn't
[1:02:26] say let the redeemed of the Lord read so
[1:02:29] let the redeemed of the Lord think so
[1:02:32] let it said let the redeemed of the Lord
[1:02:34] say so this is why Paul would go on and
[1:02:41] say for the son of God Jesus Christ who
[1:02:45] was preached among you by us even by me
[1:02:48] in Sylvanus and timotheus was not yay
[1:02:51] and nay but in him was yay now what
[1:02:56] should catch this now not yay or nay the
[1:02:59] real gospel of Jesus Christ does not say
[1:03:02] ya hear and nay over here yeah this is a
[1:03:06] real promise and I don't know about this
[1:03:08] that gospel doesn't do that and if the
[1:03:10] gospel be in you that same life and you
[1:03:13] will not say ya hear and nay over here
[1:03:16] but within you it says yay and amen amen
[1:03:21] this is what we're talking about with
[1:03:23] the helmet for all oh say it right there
[1:03:27] in your living room all the promises of
[1:03:29] God in him are yay and in him Amen unto
[1:03:34] the glory of God by us God helps to
[1:03:39] prove his word he can't prove it through
[1:03:41] unbelievers or make believer he proves
[1:03:44] it through believers and every time God
[1:03:48] proves his word it is where the odds if
[1:03:52] I could say that word are stacked
[1:03:54] against the believers they are odds
[1:03:56] where people would say whoo-hoo-hoo just
[1:03:59] oma just cover your eyes it's going to
[1:04:01] be over in a moment home ah there ain't
[1:04:02] no way this will be able to take place
[1:04:04] that's how God loves to move and work in
[1:04:07] situations that is absolutely impossible
[1:04:11] for that of us as mankind but this is
[1:04:15] where God loves you know he loves to
[1:04:18] show his power and his love to you and I
[1:04:20] you know this is why that God he tells
[1:04:24] us He loves us and we should believe
[1:04:25] that we should be resting upon that but
[1:04:28] as brother Branham would tell us he said
[1:04:30] he said he he loves to get us in those
[1:04:32] places
[1:04:33] where he can tell us and show us he said
[1:04:37] because he loves to show his love and
[1:04:39] his power to his people because he's not
[1:04:45] a show-off he knows that his people love
[1:04:47] him
[1:04:48] love to see him working notice Paul
[1:04:51] would go on in second Corinthians 2:14
[1:04:53] and Paul's testimony said thanks be unto
[1:04:57] God which always causeth us to triumph
[1:05:01] in Christ and maketh manifest the savour
[1:05:06] of his knowledge by us in every place
[1:05:11] the Savior that I'm here it is it's
[1:05:15] coming forth it's coming to pass the
[1:05:17] word is working within the word is
[1:05:19] virtuous remember the word is not a
[1:05:21] doctrine the word is not a letter the
[1:05:23] word is the person of Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] are you with me so you recognize this so
[1:05:32] it's just like when a person says well
[1:05:35] I've been born again if you've been born
[1:05:37] again and you make that declaration then
[1:05:39] what you are saying is my life is
[1:05:41] identified the anointed word of the hour
[1:05:45] come on now that's exactly what the Holy
[1:05:49] Ghost comes to do it comes to anoint the
[1:05:52] word for this hour and make it live and
[1:05:54] we are a part of that word so this where
[1:05:59] Paul would say that it is God thanks be
[1:06:03] to God
[1:06:04] which causes us to triumph in Christ
[1:06:09] your defeat
[1:06:11] there's no defeat you say well brother
[1:06:15] Samuel um
[1:06:16] you know so-and-so uh passed away or
[1:06:19] so-and-so died in that defeat we're not
[1:06:23] kept from death we're kept in death yea
[1:06:26] though I walk through the valley of the
[1:06:28] shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:06:35] oh glory and Joshua chapter 1 and let's
[1:06:39] blade these things to heart now
[1:06:42] gwon is instructing Joshua
[1:06:46] Joshua has heard these things you read
[1:06:49] in the Book of Numbers you read in the
[1:06:51] book of Deuteronomy Deuteronomy these
[1:06:53] statements strong and courageous and
[1:06:56] courage these things are mentioned in
[1:06:58] multiple chapters because you will know
[1:07:03] why this was the heart of the message
[1:07:06] that came when God met Moses their God
[1:07:11] never changed the message the Commission
[1:07:13] has never changed Joshua was only the
[1:07:17] further unfolding of the word that now
[1:07:20] had been spoken through Moses Joshua is
[1:07:23] the one that moves on the scene to
[1:07:26] perform there in a body ministry the
[1:07:30] word that has went forth now is to be
[1:07:33] unfolded as sons and daughters of God
[1:07:36] are coming into their inheritance and
[1:07:38] position in the land though different in
[1:07:43] our temperaments and makeups and how we
[1:07:45] perceive in our angle and perception on
[1:07:48] things but yet in Christ in Jesus Christ
[1:07:51] we are positioned in our inheritance and
[1:07:56] it's Joshua that unfolds and divides out
[1:08:00] to us it is him that releases to us our
[1:08:04] allotted portion girl repeater garden
[1:08:10] boss Philip region verse seven only be
[1:08:15] thou strong and very courageous
[1:08:17] courageous then thou mayest observe to
[1:08:21] do according to all the law which Moses
[1:08:26] my servant commanded thee turn up from
[1:08:29] it to the right hand or to the left that
[1:08:30] thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou
[1:08:33] goest you forsake the word you forsake
[1:08:37] victory you forsake the word you forsake
[1:08:41] the strength and the courage that comes
[1:08:45] with the word that's exactly right
[1:08:48] before you can ever receive the lie of
[1:08:51] the devil you must first turn down the
[1:08:54] truth
[1:08:55] this book verse 8 of the law shall not
[1:09:00] depart out of thy mouth I want you to
[1:09:02] catch this from how I can't dwell on
[1:09:04] this one here a lot but it goes from
[1:09:06] buck to mouth are you with me the word
[1:09:12] that had been delivered the word that
[1:09:14] was spoken that had come in book now
[1:09:17] that word is not to depart out of thy
[1:09:20] mouth what is it he's saying let what's
[1:09:23] in the book become fresh in you you
[1:09:28] become a spokesman this should stay on
[1:09:33] today but now notice this is where it
[1:09:38] comes in notice notice but thou shalt
[1:09:40] meditate therein day and night
[1:09:42] how do I get the word in my mouth it's
[1:09:45] gotta be in your heart first as a man
[1:09:48] thinketh in his heart so is he
[1:09:50] are you it's me you first you've got to
[1:09:53] take the word in and let that word be
[1:09:56] anointed meditate on it dwell on it you
[1:09:59] know brother battle I'm a witness of
[1:10:01] this and so when I you know heard this
[1:10:03] over the years brother man said you go
[1:10:05] to thinking on him he said he steps
[1:10:07] right out just like he did on the road
[1:10:10] to emmaus and it can be a little
[1:10:12] something from your devotional something
[1:10:14] from the service today
[1:10:16] or something you know it just stretched
[1:10:17] and moved and you just start thinking
[1:10:19] about him and all of a sudden another
[1:10:21] man says you feel that presence just
[1:10:25] sweep right over you he said what is
[1:10:27] that that's the evidence of the
[1:10:28] resurrection it's the same Lord Jesus
[1:10:31] that stepped out of the pages step out
[1:10:35] of the shadows and types stepped out and
[1:10:38] begin to walk with them so before and
[1:10:42] ever remember before it ever gets to the
[1:10:46] mouth
[1:10:47] you got to meditate on it that's the
[1:10:50] same order but we read Ephesians 6 and
[1:10:53] take unto you the helmet of salvation
[1:10:55] and the sword of the Spirit it didn't
[1:10:58] say take the sword of the Spirit and
[1:11:00] then go get the helmet of salvation no
[1:11:02] you've got to take the word in it's got
[1:11:04] to be alive to you so what you
[1:11:07] surely our speaking is who you are are
[1:11:11] you with me
[1:11:12] when doin Satan met Jesus he he you know
[1:11:15] he flew in to him but what he met he met
[1:11:18] somebody that wasn't quoting the word he
[1:11:20] were met somebody who was the word and
[1:11:23] was quoting what he was and what was
[1:11:26] made alive to him who let me go on you
[1:11:31] this morning but thou shalt meditate
[1:11:33] therein day and night that thou mayst
[1:11:37] observe to do according to all that is
[1:11:40] written therein for then thou shalt make
[1:11:43] that way prosperous and thou shalt have
[1:11:46] good success so have not I commanded
[1:11:50] thee be strong another good courage be
[1:11:53] not afraid neither be thou dismayed for
[1:11:55] the Lord God is with thee
[1:11:58] whether so ever thou goest you know what
[1:12:02] God is saying you make a step I made a
[1:12:04] step you make a step I made a step you
[1:12:07] make a step you see we're not to get
[1:12:09] ahead of him
[1:12:10] we're only simply to walk in the steps
[1:12:13] what he has unfolded the Bible says that
[1:12:16] the thorough steps of the righteous are
[1:12:18] ordered of the Lord David said he making
[1:12:23] my feet like Hinds feet glory be to God
[1:12:29] in the highest this is why in the Book
[1:12:32] of Psalms he will go home to say for a
[1:12:35] very familiar scripture but you know if
[1:12:38] you haven't considered this this portion
[1:12:40] of scripture that I'm going to read
[1:12:42] which is familiar to you and I this is a
[1:12:44] portion of Scripture that the Spirit of
[1:12:46] God would have the Prophet Lake heavenly
[1:12:49] on in the restoration to the bride tree
[1:12:54] many times you find people that are
[1:12:57] wanting power they want miracles they
[1:12:59] want all these things but they don't
[1:13:01] have a personal walk with God they don't
[1:13:04] want to line up with the word they want
[1:13:06] all of these things and I want to see
[1:13:08] this and I want to see that and I want
[1:13:10] to see this and we want to say that
[1:13:11] remember power power is not a given
[1:13:16] outside of the word
[1:13:18] power that comes outside of the world it
[1:13:22] lives people in the same situation they
[1:13:25] were in before
[1:13:26] that's why brother Ram said when a
[1:13:28] healing revival comes he said him when
[1:13:30] it comes and that and it continues on in
[1:13:33] that same denomination he said that is
[1:13:35] not of God it's not my words why because
[1:13:40] the pillar of fire comes not to anoint
[1:13:43] the ideas of a man the pillar of fire
[1:13:46] comes to lead us further very men our
[1:13:53] encampments are not to be isolation but
[1:13:57] our encampments are to be presenting
[1:13:59] ourselves before the Lord that our lives
[1:14:02] might be molded and shaped and we're
[1:14:04] waiting and watching for the moving of
[1:14:07] the Spirit of God Psalms 1 1 blessed is
[1:14:11] the man that walketh not in the counsel
[1:14:13] of the ungodly nor standeth in the way
[1:14:16] of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of
[1:14:20] the scornful but his delight is in the
[1:14:25] law of the Lord and in his law doth he
[1:14:30] meditate day and night even though his
[1:14:35] delight is that in the law of the Lord
[1:14:37] he meditates day and night this is the
[1:14:40] kind this is what you see about this not
[1:14:42] this individuals life and he shall be
[1:14:45] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[1:14:50] water that bringeth forth his fruit
[1:14:55] God's fruit the promise his fruit in his
[1:15:00] season whose season the season of the
[1:15:03] messenger his fruit God's fruit in the
[1:15:06] season that he sends his messenger with
[1:15:09] that message his leaf his leaf also
[1:15:13] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[1:15:17] shall prosper
[1:15:21] you know what this is talking about the
[1:15:23] prevalence of life proverbs 4 20 my son
[1:15:29] attend to my words in crying than ear
[1:15:34] unto my sayings let them not be part
[1:15:38] from dying eyes keep them in the midst
[1:15:42] of thine heart for they are life unto
[1:15:48] those that find them and health to all
[1:15:53] their flesh
[1:15:57] divine healing these are the various
[1:16:01] scriptures brother Bosworth would give
[1:16:03] these scriptures right here when praying
[1:16:05] for the sick and told the people when
[1:16:07] you're prayed for you take these
[1:16:09] scriptures and you immerse yourself in
[1:16:12] the Word of God you know you know as he
[1:16:17] would express it what I'm gonna say that
[1:16:19] brother Bosworth would express their
[1:16:21] it's the same thing you know brother
[1:16:23] Bosworth old daddy Bosworth and brother
[1:16:25] Branham they were buddies they were
[1:16:26] friends and brother brother Bosworth
[1:16:29] made the statement he said take the seed
[1:16:31] and commit it to the ground and quit
[1:16:34] digging it up how many messages go on
[1:16:38] over and over and over you find the
[1:16:40] Prophet saying the same thing what it's
[1:16:42] the wisdom of God that would come down
[1:16:45] that you and I might be able to tap into
[1:16:47] in the simplicity God would make it so
[1:16:49] simple and say give yourself to the word
[1:16:52] planet couldn't digging it up and see if
[1:16:54] it's coming out just be settled in it
[1:16:56] God has said it the promise is gay and a
[1:16:59] man it belongs to me
[1:17:02] you let the word come into your cell
[1:17:05] it's eternal life and that same word
[1:17:07] that's in there it is also health to
[1:17:10] your mortal body oh my this is why we
[1:17:15] must have that knowledge that knowing
[1:17:18] that the experience we're firmly planted
[1:17:20] in solid ground no other foundation but
[1:17:25] Jesus Christ you must become acquainted
[1:17:28] with the promises that belong to you
[1:17:33] let me just say if you here for every
[1:17:37] one of us if the only time that you hear
[1:17:40] the Scriptures is when you come to the
[1:17:43] house of God you need to repent
[1:17:46] the only time you hear a quote from the
[1:17:48] message is when it's read here you need
[1:17:50] to repent you need to give yourself to
[1:17:54] the word of the Lord amen this where God
[1:17:58] has vindicated it Amen I'm not there I'm
[1:18:04] just saying it from my heart because of
[1:18:06] the victory that belongs to you where
[1:18:08] you can have victory in your own life
[1:18:11] I'm brother Sam there you know I just I
[1:18:14] can't set down that long when I go to
[1:18:15] read a chapter I add this and that you
[1:18:17] know what you need to call that devil a
[1:18:19] liar because you're able to sit down and
[1:18:22] do all other sorts of other things for
[1:18:25] an hour or more you need to realize say
[1:18:28] devil you're not loving me no more I
[1:18:31] want to read about my redemptive rights
[1:18:34] I guarantee you if you knew an aunt or
[1:18:37] an uncle somebody died and your name was
[1:18:39] in there for a certain amount of money
[1:18:41] or for certain things I guarantee you
[1:18:43] even if you had problems we're answering
[1:18:45] around and everything else you would
[1:18:47] find you a lawyer you'd find somebody
[1:18:50] you have asked somebody I want to know
[1:18:52] what's in here that belongs to me why
[1:18:55] because you know my name is in there
[1:18:57] there are promises there things have
[1:18:59] been wrote down for me and that's the
[1:19:02] way it is to be with the Word of God
[1:19:04] bread these promises have been rough for
[1:19:07] you the Holy Ghost is for you
[1:19:09] deliverance is for you salvation is for
[1:19:13] you Healing is for you million times
[1:19:19] what happens were prayed for and then we
[1:19:22] leave out of here and instead of feeding
[1:19:24] on the promises of healing we just walk
[1:19:31] out we say well I've met the
[1:19:33] requirements you haven't met the
[1:19:34] requirements you have come up if you've
[1:19:37] met the requirements there's nothing
[1:19:38] standing between you and God
[1:19:39] the Bible said the prayer of faith shall
[1:19:41] save the sick and God shall raise them
[1:19:42] up they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:19:44] they
[1:19:45] shall recover but you need to place
[1:19:48] yourself in that of the word remember
[1:19:53] what God doesn't hear it's your and
[1:19:56] responsibility and my responsibility to
[1:19:59] keep weeds out of that garden and I
[1:20:06] think I'm speaking to every one of us
[1:20:08] there's times when I walk around I walk
[1:20:10] around my flowerbeds it gets to that
[1:20:13] time of the year or I'll go around
[1:20:15] there's so many of every other so many
[1:20:18] mornings in the week and I look in there
[1:20:21] early and you know what you'll find a
[1:20:23] little weeds growing how did they get
[1:20:27] there I didn't plant them when brought
[1:20:29] them in some of those seeds were already
[1:20:33] there certain things begin to germinate
[1:20:35] I know if you ever noticed this or not
[1:20:37] to me it's just really inspiring in one
[1:20:39] sense of the word there's some times
[1:20:42] where I've had to get on my hands and
[1:20:43] knees because there's weeds that
[1:20:45] actually look like the plant they were
[1:20:47] growing under yes I mean they leaves
[1:20:52] everything it looks just like it and
[1:20:55] then you have to get close to it there's
[1:20:58] times where we really got to get earnest
[1:21:00] before God and said Lord if this'll lead
[1:21:04] that looks like it's part of the plant
[1:21:07] Oh glory that was free
[1:21:14] let me just tell you why the enemy is
[1:21:19] going to contest you on every ounce of
[1:21:21] ground you'll say everything to you
[1:21:27] you'll try to bring every charge and
[1:21:29] accusation against you you're trying to
[1:21:32] bring scare tactics you'll try to do
[1:21:34] everything you can to contest promises
[1:21:37] from being taken
[1:21:40] this is why Paul if I can just put it
[1:21:43] very clearly in the book of Ephesians
[1:21:46] Paul begins by inspiration of telling us
[1:21:49] who we are in Christ Jesus
[1:21:52] lets us know what we have claims upon
[1:21:56] then it's unfolded in our walk in our
[1:22:00] life and he moves to a place where he
[1:22:03] admonishes us to take upon the full
[1:22:06] armor of God and that we're not fighting
[1:22:09] against flesh and blood principalities
[1:22:11] rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:22:14] what's he dealing with we were chosen in
[1:22:17] Christ we are we are blessing where we
[1:22:20] are to reside us in heavenly places and
[1:22:22] let me tell you something there are
[1:22:24] battles battles that you and I must
[1:22:27] fight and we are called to contest
[1:22:30] within these spiritual battles this is
[1:22:33] why Paul would bring it so much together
[1:22:36] there in the book of Ephesians in that
[1:22:38] way think of this now this scripture
[1:22:43] here have quoted it many times but I
[1:22:45] would say over a year ago when things of
[1:22:48] just studying and just throughout the
[1:22:50] course of the year studying on Israel
[1:22:53] the redemption and moving through the
[1:22:55] scriptures with it
[1:22:56] this scripture which we are very
[1:22:59] familiar with out of the Book of Isaiah
[1:23:00] we've heard it quoted and and and we've
[1:23:04] applied it but it is a scripture and let
[1:23:07] me read it first it says in verse 3 thou
[1:23:10] wilt keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:23:14] mind is stayed on thee because he
[1:23:20] trusted in thee this scripture is a part
[1:23:24] of a bank of scriptures that is actually
[1:23:27] it's a promise that we can draw from but
[1:23:30] this same scripture refers to win the
[1:23:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost the gospel is
[1:23:37] preached to the hundred forty-four
[1:23:39] thousand and here they are moved away
[1:23:42] and a fulfillment into the wilderness
[1:23:44] their and here they are in the taking in
[1:23:47] of the Word of God remember the Bible
[1:23:49] says in Isaiah says in Zechariah that
[1:23:51] they will in
[1:23:52] compass of Mountain Jerusalem this the
[1:23:54] pressure is coming down why will the
[1:23:56] pressures come down on Israel in that
[1:23:58] time because that is where God is moving
[1:24:02] why is God so intent and against the
[1:24:06] bride of Jesus Christ remember every
[1:24:08] demon power that's been released against
[1:24:12] the bride of Jesus Christ why because
[1:24:14] that is where he is at presently but
[1:24:19] here's the promise David said a host and
[1:24:23] come about me
[1:24:26] let Jerusalem encompassed about I see
[1:24:30] things all around me but the promise is
[1:24:33] I will keep him in perfect peace whose
[1:24:36] mind is stayed on me because he trusts
[1:24:41] in me then we move over into the promise
[1:24:47] where it says in Philippians 4:7 the
[1:24:49] peace of God which passes all
[1:24:52] understanding and I can say amen to that
[1:24:56] because there's beyond this how that
[1:24:59] moves in donnelly in our soul but how it
[1:25:02] moves in our life at times how the piece
[1:25:04] of gorgeous emanates to our life to move
[1:25:07] upon situations here's what I shall do
[1:25:11] shall keep that means to be garrisoned
[1:25:14] in like a military guard to prevent
[1:25:17] hostile invasion he shall keep your
[1:25:21] hearts and minds through Christ Jesus
[1:25:24] finally brethren verse 8
[1:25:28] whatsoever things are true
[1:25:33] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[1:25:36] things are just pure lovely of a good
[1:25:42] report
[1:25:43] you know Paul has given here these are
[1:25:46] all criteria it must meet
[1:25:52] there's a lot of truth
[1:25:55] that don't even need to be thought about
[1:25:59] lot of truth that don't even need to be
[1:26:01] entertained
[1:26:04] then send preach it Romans for the Bible
[1:26:10] said and that Abraham who hoped who
[1:26:14] against hope hoped what was the
[1:26:19] expectation mat body's going to keep on
[1:26:21] breaking down but he said I have an
[1:26:23] expectation that is greater than that
[1:26:26] reality of my body breaking down there's
[1:26:28] an expectation by a living promise that
[1:26:31] a living God made to me that we are
[1:26:33] going to have a son
[1:26:37] this is what it means there's a lot of
[1:26:39] truth that can be around but there's a
[1:26:43] truth V truth that is greater than truth
[1:26:49] are you with me when they saw the giants
[1:26:52] the giants the ana comes true their
[1:26:56] giants true they're big boys true
[1:27:00] they're in those cities true but there's
[1:27:03] another the truth and the truth is said
[1:27:07] if you believe so the truth Trump's
[1:27:12] truth how's that for truth in facts if
[1:27:23] there be any virtue notice here's
[1:27:25] another part of it if there's any fetch
[1:27:28] you in it brother Samuel you are tearing
[1:27:32] my Facebook account
[1:27:33] apart praise the Lord you realize the
[1:27:39] things that you can read when you study
[1:27:41] on many of those things there are things
[1:27:43] that people can read one little thing
[1:27:45] when they get up in the morning and it
[1:27:47] can set the rest of their day if there
[1:27:51] be any virtue if there be any praise
[1:27:54] we're gonna send them with this thing
[1:27:56] right here you know there's linen on a
[1:27:57] virtue and really any praise in it then
[1:27:59] let me just tell you don't entertain it
[1:28:03] this is what your to do if it meets all
[1:28:06] those qualities and then has virtue
[1:28:08] virtue means strength I can do all
[1:28:10] things through Christ who enables me if
[1:28:13] it doesn't have virtue and there ain't
[1:28:15] any praise in it don't think on it but
[1:28:19] if it meets that then think on those
[1:28:21] things really the only thing I can think
[1:28:26] about that that's the Word of God this
[1:28:31] is why listen to me now the brass speaks
[1:28:34] of judgment remember now I'm coming into
[1:28:37] this part of the head piece it's brass
[1:28:40] brass speaks of judgment wants you to
[1:28:43] hold that judgment meaning as Paul would
[1:28:46] write in second Corinthians and he would
[1:28:49] speak of how
[1:28:51] that we are not walking in the flesh
[1:28:53] we're warring we do not war after it but
[1:28:56] the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:28:58] carnal but mighty through God to the
[1:29:03] pulling down of strongholds casting down
[1:29:07] imaginations we don't we don't talk away
[1:29:13] we cast them down the rebellion in
[1:29:17] heaven cast out you find in the
[1:29:21] scripture
[1:29:21] we're not asking Satan to leave cast him
[1:29:24] out they shall cast out Devils
[1:29:28] what a mean cast him out throw them out
[1:29:32] and every high thing that's every
[1:29:39] thought remember that whole thing
[1:29:43] I think remember this first birth came
[1:29:45] by an exalted thought of the high thing
[1:29:48] come on that's why Paul said neither
[1:29:50] height nor depth or things present nor
[1:29:52] things to come he's talking about
[1:29:53] spiritual circumstances Satan took Jesus
[1:29:58] upon the mountain heights took him up
[1:30:00] upon the temple heights sometimes
[1:30:03] Heights things look differently but this
[1:30:06] is why we need the reading of the Lord
[1:30:08] even those high things things that some
[1:30:10] what if there's anything that then is
[1:30:12] exalted every high thing that exalteth
[1:30:14] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:30:18] bringing into captivity every thought
[1:30:25] to the obedience of Christ Wow so before
[1:30:30] it ever should come out of the mouth it
[1:30:33] ought to already be scrutinized come on
[1:30:38] we got to balance this out you can say
[1:30:40] well you know you know brother Samuel
[1:30:42] you know Isaiah just spoke you know has
[1:30:44] yeah I know that but Isaiah was lifted
[1:30:46] up into the mind of God and you're not
[1:30:50] gonna tell me you're lifted up in the
[1:30:51] mind of God and tearing down somebody
[1:30:53] else he was lifted up that's that with
[1:30:58] that he spoke things he was lifted up by
[1:31:01] the Spirit of God so this right here
[1:31:03] pulling into captivity every thought
[1:31:05] what's it talking about it's talking
[1:31:07] about this is the helmet of salvation
[1:31:09] bringing bringing judgment and and
[1:31:12] judging that thought oh my I just say oh
[1:31:16] just let me just stay on this here now
[1:31:20] let me bring this down and I'm going to
[1:31:24] come into this part and by the help of
[1:31:27] the Lord just close here
[1:31:30] on this bringing this down into an
[1:31:33] example with David and Goliath here I
[1:31:39] may just refer to it instead of reading
[1:31:41] the the scriptures but here was Goliath
[1:31:48] making his boast and the scripture is
[1:31:52] clear to point out that the lieth had on
[1:31:55] a helmet of brass if said he had on his
[1:32:00] whole covering was brass he had a coat
[1:32:04] of brass he had leg guards of brass he
[1:32:10] was covered all over remember brass
[1:32:13] speaks of judgment goliath was had the
[1:32:19] judgment of god upon him because why he
[1:32:24] was uncircumcised
[1:32:26] do you realize without the token or the
[1:32:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost the judgment
[1:32:32] of God is upon you he had a helmet of
[1:32:39] brass his whole body armor was brass
[1:32:42] you're still under the looming judgment
[1:32:45] you say how do we see that still being
[1:32:48] under the looming judgment look how if a
[1:32:51] life would walk in darkness a life walks
[1:32:54] in condemnation the Bible says there is
[1:32:57] there and therefore no condemnation to
[1:32:59] them which are in Christ Jesus we've
[1:33:02] been made free the inner man is free the
[1:33:07] lever the world has gone is passed from
[1:33:09] you from all time and eternity now the
[1:33:12] difference now here's Goliath but here
[1:33:16] stands David David is not under the
[1:33:21] judgment of God but David is coming to
[1:33:24] meet him under the atonement and the
[1:33:28] Talmud has listed him above the judgment
[1:33:31] this is what David is expressing in
[1:33:34] Psalms 27 he hath lifted my head now
[1:33:39] above mine enemies
[1:33:41] so David had on the helmet of salvation
[1:33:45] remember david was a type of Christ in
[1:33:47] Isaiah 29 when he has as the Lord Jesus
[1:33:51] come it said he would have upon a
[1:33:53] righteousness as a breastplate salvation
[1:33:57] as a helmet it was one there was one
[1:34:00] focus it was one purpose
[1:34:03] there was one goal and that was to
[1:34:07] satisfy and redeem or mine so David had
[1:34:15] an issue of the helmet
[1:34:18] of salvation now remember Goliath's
[1:34:22] helmet is very visible Damon David's
[1:34:25] wearing the helmet of salvation you can
[1:34:29] look at David and say I don't see no
[1:34:30] helmet oh no brother he had a helmet
[1:34:32] oh no he he had a helmet on you see what
[1:34:37] David had on and they just let me just
[1:34:39] refer to it this way what David had on
[1:34:42] but the RAM said he never prayed a
[1:34:44] prayer he never offered nothing he known
[1:34:47] he was anointed he was anointed and that
[1:34:52] slingshot had proved the right kind of
[1:34:55] thing he had faith in his anointing
[1:35:00] that's what the token does when the
[1:35:04] token is come you got faith in the token
[1:35:07] the purchasing power the fool assurance
[1:35:10] that there is nothing present not future
[1:35:14] there are things to come nothing shall
[1:35:16] be able to separate us from the love of
[1:35:19] God nothing confidence in one that's why
[1:35:24] you've got to have the sacred sands
[1:35:26] that's why you've gotta meet God face to
[1:35:29] face I want you understand even those
[1:35:35] you out there you're streaming I'm not
[1:35:37] talking down to you I'm trying to tell
[1:35:39] you what's available to you so you can
[1:35:44] walk in victory wear the sandals not
[1:35:47] your victory the way I preach is not
[1:35:50] your victory the victory is the absolute
[1:35:54] of the one who speaks through me it is
[1:35:56] that absolute that moves into your heart
[1:35:59] that's why the Prophet said it must be a
[1:36:02] man that's got the absolute of God and
[1:36:05] hold that absolute over the congregation
[1:36:08] that the congregation comes to that
[1:36:11] absolute I'm telling you then you've got
[1:36:14] victory
[1:36:15] [Applause]
[1:36:19] he had faith let me finish reading this
[1:36:22] he had faith that God could direct that
[1:36:27] rock right straight in the middle of
[1:36:30] that helmet there are you with me now
[1:36:33] David look everybody else said this
[1:36:36] guy's covered over with armor you ain't
[1:36:39] never going to be able to pierce it -
[1:36:43] David David saw the most vulnerable spot
[1:36:48] he didn't have the seal of God come on
[1:36:51] somebody come on now he didn't have the
[1:36:54] seal of God are you with me now he
[1:36:57] didn't have that David said he's an
[1:36:59] uncircumcised philistine David didn't
[1:37:02] say he's this big or he's got this on
[1:37:04] his got that on David's head he's
[1:37:07] uncircumcised
[1:37:08] oh my feel like preacher right now he
[1:37:15] had faith that God could direct that
[1:37:18] stone notice he no listen to me now
[1:37:22] he knowed he was a good shot blocker
[1:37:27] preacher I've got to preach a month we
[1:37:29] could preach on that a while he knowed
[1:37:31] he was a good shot this was not David
[1:37:33] puffed up in himself David knew what God
[1:37:38] had done through his life I'm not a very
[1:37:41] good Christian
[1:37:42] oh I'm not why don't you stop talking
[1:37:44] the devil's language God took cussing
[1:37:47] out of many of our vocabulary and yet we
[1:37:50] walk around with this sanctified
[1:37:52] swearing well I'm not a good Christian
[1:37:54] oh I wish I had more faith I wish I
[1:37:56] wasn't this I wish I was at that that
[1:37:58] sanctified swearing you need to have a
[1:38:01] positive confession at all times I am
[1:38:05] redeemed
[1:38:06] he is my deliverer I am loved of the
[1:38:10] Lord I can do all things through Christ
[1:38:12] which strengtheneth me for the bad so
[1:38:18] when you talk negative you're talking
[1:38:20] the devil's language
[1:38:25] that don't mean then my wife can't tell
[1:38:28] me that she's got she says honey I've
[1:38:30] got kidney problems I don't walk up to
[1:38:32] her and say stop talking the devil's
[1:38:34] language no no brother we're talking my
[1:38:35] wisdom here I don't walk up and say
[1:38:37] don't you talk about that she might need
[1:38:39] there might need to be something address
[1:38:41] something in our home of one of our
[1:38:43] children you say well then how do you
[1:38:44] balance it all out it's that we're
[1:38:46] looking to the Lord for healing we're
[1:38:48] not going to make space for that to
[1:38:49] dwell come on somebody we're talking
[1:38:54] about faith he knowed he was a good shot
[1:38:58] he knowed God made him that so David
[1:39:04] knew my skills from the Lord oh ma you
[1:39:12] know ma this is why when the Prophet
[1:39:13] would pick it up in the token I don't
[1:39:16] have time to teach you to read it to you
[1:39:18] but he said when that token has come he
[1:39:20] said Satan will try to stand there and
[1:39:22] he'll try to tempt you he said I want
[1:39:24] you to remember he said when you have
[1:39:26] that token you walk with the confidence
[1:39:29] that you are in Christ hallelujah and we
[1:39:34] expect we expect dividends from the
[1:39:38] sacrifice from this life that we are in
[1:39:42] he has made us a good shot hallelujah he
[1:39:48] has made us a good shot Oh glory be to
[1:39:53] God in Christ there is no death no
[1:39:56] sorrow no weary no sin no sickness no
[1:40:00] death
[1:40:04] he said if Satan tries to hand you
[1:40:06] something like sickness you just take
[1:40:08] your token and apply it brother slander
[1:40:12] I applied my token and I still hidden it
[1:40:16] upset keep applying it the token was not
[1:40:20] a guarantee that this body wouldn't feel
[1:40:23] sickness this body is a bondage of
[1:40:25] corruption
[1:40:26] it's a pest house this body is sin but
[1:40:29] what the token said is that if he allows
[1:40:32] sickness to come he
[1:40:34] the promise I'm the Lord that takes
[1:40:37] sickness away from you whoo glory be to
[1:40:45] God
[1:40:46] brother brems said he tells you he'll
[1:40:50] say to you this other token message he
[1:40:52] says when you die you're lost he said
[1:40:55] but you say you're wrong I have the
[1:40:58] purchased product
[1:40:59] I am a purchased product I have the
[1:41:03] token oh my he said how that he would
[1:41:11] come around and try to bluff well who
[1:41:13] does that
[1:41:14] it's an old devil now remember when
[1:41:19] David came David you know people started
[1:41:25] rehearsing David's words to solve so
[1:41:28] I'll say who is this guy who is this big
[1:41:33] guy his comment he must be a very a very
[1:41:36] big man where's he at I'm surprised I
[1:41:38] can't scene because certainly he'd
[1:41:39] probably this guy's probably head and
[1:41:40] shoulders above the rescue I didn't know
[1:41:42] we had any giants in Israel now you
[1:41:43] don't have giant men you got a giant God
[1:41:45] you got a great big hog who comes in
[1:41:47] small packages not the size of the dog
[1:41:49] in the fight size of the fight in the
[1:41:51] dog here came dad David ready beautiful
[1:41:54] countenance come on he was one that the
[1:41:58] Prophet would have even looked beyond
[1:42:01] but God through the Prophet the Prophet
[1:42:04] was sensitive and God said put the
[1:42:07] anointing oil upon him David shows up
[1:42:13] David dude against to testify and I'm
[1:42:15] just moving through these scriptures you
[1:42:17] can read them later and know you've read
[1:42:18] over David goes out and David speaks up
[1:42:22] I went out I smoked that of the lion of
[1:42:27] the lion delivered I delivered the lamb
[1:42:29] out of its mouth he rose up against me I
[1:42:32] caught it by the beard and slew him
[1:42:34] that servant slew the lion and the bear
[1:42:36] verse 36 and the same this uncircumcised
[1:42:40] Philistine shall be as one of them you
[1:42:43] see what David was under
[1:42:46] he was under the anointing of God the
[1:42:52] word was always in David's life just
[1:42:58] like that word that seed was always
[1:43:01] laying there in our life but what had to
[1:43:04] happen
[1:43:04] it had to be anointed and when Samuel
[1:43:08] went there to anoint David or to anoint
[1:43:12] that which would be King which was
[1:43:14] chosen not by man but by God God was
[1:43:19] whole God was unfolding his children his
[1:43:24] choosing of election through the
[1:43:28] prophets message and the words that he
[1:43:33] spoke I have sought the out a neighbor
[1:43:35] and is the kingdom it shall belong to
[1:43:39] him those words this prophet went with
[1:43:43] that word and it was the word anointing
[1:43:46] that was put upon David - where in
[1:43:49] David's life it would reflect God's
[1:43:52] choosing hey men you cannot help but
[1:43:58] reflect the word of this hour you are
[1:44:01] ordained to reflect and manifest the
[1:44:04] word for this hour this message is the
[1:44:07] inspiration of the Holy Ghost that is
[1:44:10] poured out upon the believer we are
[1:44:13] under a world anointing or as the
[1:44:18] Prophet said he said it is the word in
[1:44:22] you anointed takes its position
[1:44:29] David was already acting like a king
[1:44:34] hallelujah he wasn't in maybe sitting on
[1:44:37] the throne yet but God was already
[1:44:39] seated on the throne of his heart David
[1:44:42] said who is this uncircumcised
[1:44:44] philistine he realized he was already a
[1:44:46] king let me tell you what the Holy Ghost
[1:44:49] does he
[1:44:51] made us kings and priests unto our God
[1:45:00] remember David just said I wouldn't did
[1:45:02] this
[1:45:02] I wouldn't did this I went and did this
[1:45:05] the next verse verse 37 moreover the
[1:45:10] Lord that delivered me out of the Paul
[1:45:12] the life how did the Paul the bear he
[1:45:15] will deliver me out of the hand of this
[1:45:17] Philistine what was David say God used
[1:45:21] him as an instrument and David brought
[1:45:24] it all around it was the law
[1:45:26] moving through me so Saul said wait here
[1:45:33] a minute
[1:45:36] verse 38 Saul arm David with his armor
[1:45:40] and a puttin helmet of brass upon his
[1:45:45] head also he armed him with a coat of
[1:45:48] mail brasses judgment saw had this
[1:45:55] knowledge of the word but Saul was not
[1:45:59] fully under the atonement are you with
[1:46:02] me so here under this helmet of brass he
[1:46:07] looked at David and it looked like David
[1:46:08] needed Armour but David had on the full
[1:46:11] armor of God he had on the full armor of
[1:46:15] God amen David had a direct issue from
[1:46:18] the supplier himself this was not
[1:46:21] somebody in the barracks or or near the
[1:46:23] plant near the you know they're near the
[1:46:25] mess hall or whatever more that said oh
[1:46:27] I mean another set of btus hey I need a
[1:46:30] helmet
[1:46:30] I need another cartridge for my rifle I
[1:46:32] need to know this no sir the same God
[1:46:34] who has designated this armor he himself
[1:46:37] is the one that hands out this armor
[1:46:40] brother he's the one that personally
[1:46:42] gives this to you and I threw the Holy
[1:46:45] Ghost we have every part of the armor
[1:46:48] and we must use it the helmet is this
[1:46:52] not something that's well it's just
[1:46:54] there we're not in our dress blues or
[1:46:57] our dress grains we're in a battle
[1:47:01] there is fighting that's going on we're
[1:47:04] in the greatest battle ever fought
[1:47:25] the Scriptures tell us here in verse 40
[1:47:33] you know David he couldn't take that
[1:47:35] armor I can't do this
[1:47:37] I haven't proved it you know what David
[1:47:41] was saying I got my own experience and
[1:47:43] that's what I got faith in you got to
[1:47:48] have your own experience have faith in
[1:47:51] the anointing
[1:47:56] David took his staff in his hand just
[1:48:00] follow me here just for a moment please
[1:48:02] give me your attention and chose him
[1:48:04] five smooth Stones out of the brook and
[1:48:10] he put him in a shepherd's bag which he
[1:48:13] had David knew where to go get these
[1:48:15] stones and he had a place to put him
[1:48:18] when he got him because he was gonna
[1:48:21] need them these were not rough edge
[1:48:25] stones these were stones that the living
[1:48:28] water had flowed over these are stones
[1:48:33] that the living water had prepared and
[1:48:37] his sling was in his hand and he drew
[1:48:41] near to the Philistine now I want you to
[1:48:44] think of this
[1:48:47] when powers come to me anytime down
[1:48:50] through the down down through the
[1:48:52] history throughout the world and things
[1:48:54] like at a time even when you look even
[1:48:56] at even in Nebuchadnezzar's dream and
[1:49:01] there and you see all the different time
[1:49:03] empires and every one of them you
[1:49:06] realize there were different tactics
[1:49:07] that came about within those kingdoms
[1:49:09] and different tactics for war and
[1:49:12] different things like that
[1:49:12] and wherever the these these powers or
[1:49:17] when armies would come together they
[1:49:19] would come together in a place that's
[1:49:21] called no-man's land
[1:49:22] no-man's land meaning you don't belong
[1:49:25] to nobody that's where the powers are
[1:49:28] tested that's the battleground and
[1:49:32] listen now that battleground is in the
[1:49:36] mind Satan comes and he battles now I
[1:49:42] want you to listen to me I want
[1:49:43] everybody listen to me you say brother
[1:49:46] Samuel so the devil comes telling me
[1:49:48] this and telling me that the first thing
[1:49:50] that you've got to know is you've got to
[1:49:52] have the soldier down on the inside
[1:49:53] to know that the love of the world is
[1:49:56] gone and if it's still there then let me
[1:49:59] tell you something there is one who is
[1:50:01] for you if God be for us who can be
[1:50:03] against us you need to let let the Lord
[1:50:06] Jesus Christ Himself let the banner of
[1:50:09] the Lord go to work for you let the zeal
[1:50:12] of the Lord of Hosts perform this now
[1:50:14] let me just be clear about this that
[1:50:16] don't mean for you to sit back and say
[1:50:17] well God I'm just waiting on you to do
[1:50:19] everything it means for you to rise up
[1:50:22] and you say I want this promise and I'm
[1:50:26] gonna give everything there's nothing I
[1:50:28] have in my life that is even comparable
[1:50:32] to that life that I mean come true
[1:50:35] you've gotta be willing to die to give
[1:50:37] it all I'm trying to down your victory
[1:50:42] lives
[1:50:45] it don't do away with the battleground
[1:50:48] but when he comes you got the soldier on
[1:50:50] the inside and this is no-man's land
[1:51:01] because decisions are made in the human
[1:51:05] mind this is where you take in you
[1:51:10] receive or you let out and the enemy
[1:51:13] comes there it's a mutual ground
[1:51:17] and this is where the fight is is right
[1:51:20] in the mind so I brother branham with
[1:51:23] tells of people he says you sitting
[1:51:24] there in that wheelchair he said don't
[1:51:29] you think that you're hopeless you're
[1:51:31] not
[1:51:32] he said think on things of a good
[1:51:35] reports virtue and praise on through the
[1:51:38] message on and on so many different
[1:51:40] places have God on your heart be praying
[1:51:42] be meditating on the Lord he would tell
[1:51:44] him be thinking tonight's my night
[1:51:49] tonight's my night
[1:51:50] what brother Samuel I was there last
[1:51:52] night and tonight one man and that that
[1:51:54] night wasn't my night then you show back
[1:51:55] up and say tonight's my night cuz he
[1:51:58] which was which is and which is to come
[1:52:02] time don't change him he said they shall
[1:52:07] lay hands on the sick and they shall
[1:52:09] recover
[1:52:10] he never said in a certain amount of
[1:52:12] time he just said they shall recover
[1:52:17] this is where the battle it starts it's
[1:52:21] the place that's between two hills
[1:52:25] called a valley
[1:52:27] I hope you're with me now a valley is a
[1:52:30] place where the armies come down and
[1:52:33] meet one another it was in the valley
[1:52:37] who has just read that scripture of
[1:52:39] David right there it was in a valley
[1:52:42] that David walked down into that Valley
[1:52:45] to meet Goliath
[1:52:47] you don't meet Goliath on a mountaintop
[1:52:49] you meet him in a valley hello now the
[1:52:54] battle seems real easy when you're on
[1:52:56] the mountaintop but God him remember
[1:52:58] defeat defeat as far as defeating to
[1:53:01] life it comes in the valley when I am
[1:53:05] weak then I am strong hallelujah
[1:53:10] they come right out there into the
[1:53:13] valley but I want you to know where he
[1:53:15] went to I want you to know where he went
[1:53:18] to before he ever went out there and
[1:53:21] come there to that place with Goliath he
[1:53:24] was facing Goliath he was on his way to
[1:53:26] meet him but brother he had a stream of
[1:53:30] water
[1:53:30] he was gonna have an appointment with
[1:53:32] first you know David before he was gonna
[1:53:36] battle he would ask the Lord should I
[1:53:38] pursue after him
[1:53:40] should I take after him brother there is
[1:53:42] a fountain open in the house of David
[1:53:45] there is living water and just
[1:53:53] incidentally I'll have the link in my
[1:53:57] notes when I send it out I watched a
[1:54:00] little video because I had heard this
[1:54:03] statement so I thought I want to find
[1:54:04] this out I heard a statement about there
[1:54:09] is a multitude of stones in this stream
[1:54:14] I thought well I want to go check that
[1:54:17] out and write on a video here's a man
[1:54:20] standing right there right in this very
[1:54:23] spot where David would pick up the five
[1:54:26] smooth stones that place was loaded with
[1:54:30] stones you say what does that speak of
[1:54:33] in Christ there are many promises the
[1:54:39] promises are not sparse they're not hard
[1:54:42] to come by come on somebody promises
[1:54:45] they're laying there what do I need to
[1:54:48] do make an appointment in the living
[1:54:51] water and when you get ready to meet the
[1:54:53] enemy take the Word of God and get ready
[1:54:57] to meet the enemy because in him every
[1:55:01] promise is yay and they men the living
[1:55:05] water anoints that promise to us the
[1:55:08] living water makes it alive and real
[1:55:12] [Applause]
[1:55:14] that's why you want to feel your heart
[1:55:17] and mind with the promises of God
[1:55:30] earn his battleground David comes out
[1:55:35] there he's already had discouragement
[1:55:39] from a church member he's already had
[1:55:43] discouragement from a message theologian
[1:55:45] I'm gonna preach he's already had
[1:55:49] discouragement from critical stuff but
[1:55:55] David realized you didn't call me all
[1:56:00] right now you didn't call me so you
[1:56:02] can't fire me God called me David
[1:56:07] realized where his anointing was that
[1:56:09] his strength was in the anointing of a
[1:56:12] secret meeting David had been in that
[1:56:19] little room he got anointed come on
[1:56:21] somebody he came out of that or they
[1:56:23] came out of that little room the third
[1:56:25] pull was living the opening of the word
[1:56:28] it had been unfolded in his life he had
[1:56:31] been hid away and the message was no
[1:56:34] longer in but brother it wasn't fresh
[1:56:46] so david says murga lieth rather says
[1:56:55] ain't nothing but a young guy
[1:56:58] they said he disdained him what am i a
[1:57:03] dog that you send this guy out here
[1:57:07] where you think I am
[1:57:18] you understand Goliath was known as the
[1:57:19] champion of gaff is that right but
[1:57:23] remember there was the call you send out
[1:57:27] your champion that word champion right
[1:57:30] there in the Hebrew it speaks of one who
[1:57:33] stands there in the gap one who feels
[1:57:37] the breach hallelu where can beat a team
[1:57:43] to my promises amen God sent down what
[1:57:48] you and I had need of blacks should be
[1:57:55] the name of the Lord
[1:57:56] and here was Goliath you ain't nothin
[1:58:04] but a young boy maybe I could say you
[1:58:07] could say you ain't nothin but a
[1:58:09] daughter of God you're a young daughter
[1:58:12] of God yura you're just a young man
[1:58:16] you're just
[1:58:20] the Spirit of God said Paul said let no
[1:58:23] man despise thy youth what David what
[1:58:30] David had in his heart was a Living God
[1:58:37] and Goliath was running his mouth
[1:58:41] Goliath made some promises he said I'm
[1:58:47] gonna give you a flesh to the fowls of
[1:58:50] the air and to the beasts of the field
[1:58:57] you know there's a spirit that comes
[1:58:59] behind words just as the Holy Spirit
[1:59:03] travels through the word Jesus and my
[1:59:05] words are spirit in life
[1:59:06] Satan's word come to tear down come on
[1:59:11] now this is why negative thoughts don't
[1:59:15] entertain them you can't help them from
[1:59:18] passing through but don't entertain them
[1:59:21] let me just read you this right here I
[1:59:24] know I'm taking a take take in here just
[1:59:26] just a little bit but this is more than
[1:59:28] your dinner Satan's army brings diseases
[1:59:32] this is the very next quote after what
[1:59:35] I've read about helmet of salvation
[1:59:37] Satan's army brings diseases that is
[1:59:40] what Satan is he's a destroyer Satan the
[1:59:45] whole kingdom of Satan is sickness death
[1:59:49] and sorrow and frustrations and worry
[1:59:53] all on Satan but God is life faith joy
[1:59:59] peace over here so when word comes that
[2:00:04] don't come from God frustrate
[2:00:07] frustrations come that don't come from
[2:00:09] God sorrow that don't come from God
[2:00:12] death or sickness
[2:00:14] you see Satan's our destroyer
[2:00:19] he wouldn't love nothing more than you
[2:00:22] walk out of a service or out of your
[2:00:23] living room and then out after dinner or
[2:00:26] tomorrow he would like to have a punch
[2:00:29] that would knock every ounce of
[2:00:31] confidence that the Holy Ghost has
[2:00:33] inspired in your heart he calculates
[2:00:38] that how can I hit him once and knock
[2:00:41] everything out of them that was an hour
[2:00:43] and a half being put into him come on
[2:00:47] now this word that's being ministered it
[2:00:50] is the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[2:00:52] Revelations one he is ministering love
[2:00:55] courage and ability it's showing you and
[2:01:01] I that Satan is already I've defeated
[2:01:04] being he destroys he wants to take away
[2:01:13] confidence he wants to take away any any
[2:01:16] confidence that God has instilled in you
[2:01:18] Lord I'm said that's why I said the man
[2:01:21] of God he said on that Monday morning he
[2:01:23] said Satan is there waiting on Monday
[2:01:25] morning to knock every ounce of
[2:01:26] confidence out that the Holy Ghost has
[2:01:29] put in him the day before not just a man
[2:01:32] of God but we need to take this as a
[2:01:34] whole assembly Satan is here to try to
[2:01:36] knock out this confidence why because
[2:01:39] this confidence is not a pep rally it's
[2:01:42] not a man-made confidence this is the
[2:01:44] word of the Lord be strong I never good
[2:01:47] courage hallelu God is life faith joy
[2:01:57] peace he said here's those two great
[2:02:01] forces that's coming together right now

[2:02:28] battling they battle day by day with you
[2:02:34] every force both seven I have been
[2:02:40] battling do you know what that says
[2:02:42] you're cold you're cold because the
[2:02:48] enemy is out to destroy confidence
[2:02:51] because if the enemy can move your
[2:02:53] confidence away you don't have any
[2:02:55] confidence to rise up and take ground
[2:02:59] let me just stop here today
[2:03:04] if he can bring up things from your past
[2:03:10] he can bring up things that she has
[2:03:13] already been put under the blood of
[2:03:14] Jesus Christ things that then even that
[2:03:17] you're even in your your souls not even
[2:03:19] he up to he can bring up your mistakes
[2:03:26] then he starts going with that angle
[2:03:28] then he starts working on you who are
[2:03:32] you how do you have any worthiness how
[2:03:36] can you look up for anything
[2:03:40] I don't have to tell you cuz you know
[2:03:41] how he talks to you and what I have
[2:03:45] found out over the years from even those
[2:03:49] who were much older than me is that he
[2:03:52] don't ever stop running his trap but
[2:03:55] we've got to know the tactics come on
[2:04:01] we've got to know the tactics and where
[2:04:04] when where must we stand simplicity
[2:04:06] stand on the anointing that is in your
[2:04:10] life because that anointing is not a
[2:04:13] sensation that anointing is the person
[2:04:16] of Jesus Christ it is the word that's
[2:04:20] anointed in you look your life has been
[2:04:24] changed this revelation has been made
[2:04:29] real to you the love of the world is
[2:04:32] gone you didn't do that God did that he
[2:04:37] didn't just clean your life up and make
[2:04:39] you a good church member no but he came
[2:04:42] and it has illuminated in your heart
[2:04:45] there is the love of the father in your
[2:04:48] life you desire to please him this word
[2:04:52] means everything to you to please him
[2:04:56] means everything to you
[2:05:11] David's walking out here to this battle
[2:05:13] and he's got the helmet of salvation on
[2:05:17] he's already collected the stones he
[2:05:22] knew the source to go to he knew the
[2:05:26] source to go to and collect those stones
[2:05:28] I tell you if if if you're able to with
[2:05:33] the link and things I've got the link in
[2:05:35] my notes you look on that link if you
[2:05:37] get a chance for this evening or
[2:05:39] tomorrow it's just it's about a minute
[2:05:40] and a half only two minutes long and you
[2:05:42] look at that that that that that looks
[2:05:45] like a little Creek a little part of
[2:05:46] water and look how is just stones laid
[2:05:49] within it oh it's not real pretty-like
[2:05:50] landscaping there's grass growing in
[2:05:52] there and everything else but brother
[2:05:54] bill is loaded it's loaded it's loaded
[2:05:59] brother Gomes you know what that means
[2:06:00] it means this is the full book is open
[2:06:02] the promises every promise in Christ

[2:06:11] looking around saying oh is there any
[2:06:13] promises is there any promises here no
[2:06:15] he's the same yesterday today and
[2:06:16] forever amen Jehovah the Optus Jesus of
[2:06:20] the new David has approached this battle
[2:06:24] with the helmet of salvation now Satan
[2:06:29] has wanted to run his mouth but David
[2:06:34] has come with the helmet of salvation
[2:06:37] he's got one thing on his mind
[2:06:41] is today is your last day this is the
[2:06:46] last time you're gonna wag your tongue

[2:06:52] last words you're going to say because
[2:06:55] your day is come I'm here to announce
[2:06:58] the judgment that's upon you David had
[2:07:04] the helmet of salvation and then you
[2:07:07] begin to see here how David begins to
[2:07:09] speak
[2:07:11] he begins to use the sword of the word
[2:07:16] I'll tell you brother and sister he
[2:07:19] doesn't matter where you're at in your
[2:07:20] walk with God I'm just telling I would
[2:07:24] say I would admonish you from the depths
[2:07:27] of my heart if there is something that
[2:07:31] has come your way
[2:07:32] it seems like it's destroyed your
[2:07:34] confidence let the Spirit of God
[2:07:35] evaluated in your life if there's
[2:07:38] something that's out of line let him
[2:07:40] lead you to a place to where that can be
[2:07:42] reconciled and put in line if there's
[2:07:45] something to where that you realize that
[2:07:47] really down on the inside of my soul but
[2:07:51] Samuel I need that everlasting that that
[2:07:54] eternal life I need that experience down
[2:07:57] there on the inside then ask God for it
[2:08:00] it belongs to you don't bet you don't
[2:08:03] have to begging you asking like we
[2:08:06] preach like we were talking on Tuesday
[2:08:08] night in our little chat our little chat
[2:08:10] stream we did there it was not because
[2:08:12] the man was a friend that he rose up and
[2:08:15] gave him bread no no it won because he
[2:08:17] was a friend it's because of the one who
[2:08:19] was asking was shameless in his asking
[2:08:24] he was shameless you know it was it
[2:08:26] showed pride did not have hold him back
[2:08:29] from asking for what he really needed he
[2:08:31] said I've got me for bread he didn't let
[2:08:34] pride hold him back his importunity he
[2:08:37] asked
[2:08:41] and Jesus said how much more will not
[2:08:46] the heavenly father for those that you
[2:08:47] that asked for the Holy Ghost will he
[2:08:49] not give it
[2:08:50] notice ask now beg ask he will give it
[2:08:56] if there's something in your life to
[2:08:58] where the enemy has moved and you find
[2:09:02] yourself low in confidence maybe it's
[2:09:04] something that the enemy is holding a
[2:09:06] cloud you you can identify in your life
[2:09:08] you say but the Sun I know the love of
[2:09:10] the world's not there I know my heart it
[2:09:14] beats for God I love the Lord with all
[2:09:16] my heart but if there's something that's
[2:09:20] come that somewhat to try to destroy
[2:09:23] your confidence
[2:09:24] maybe it's things to where the enemy is
[2:09:27] tried to point out and try to suggest
[2:09:30] certain things of I wonder how come you
[2:09:33] don't have testimonies like this other
[2:09:34] brother has testimonies are one to
[2:09:36] wonder why you don't have certain
[2:09:37] testimonies like this other sister let
[2:09:40] me just remind you
[2:09:42] you're not a fool you say what do you
[2:09:45] say that because Paul said those that
[2:09:48] compare themselves among themselves are
[2:09:50] fools you're not a fool
[2:09:52] you're a wise virgin you're not to be
[2:09:57] comparing yourself with one another our
[2:10:02] our stand if David compared himself to
[2:10:04] Saul he didn't ever went out there but
[2:10:07] that's not what David was comparing
[2:10:08] himself with don't allow the enemy to
[2:10:11] try to match you up with somebody else
[2:10:12] or I'm not we are a body that goes
[2:10:14] together
[2:10:15] my body is not made up of all fingers
[2:10:18] it's not made up of all toes it's not
[2:10:20] made up of all of all arms it's not made
[2:10:22] up of all mouth it's not made up of all
[2:10:24] tongue it's not made it has parts
[2:10:28] members that come together because if
[2:10:32] I'm a part of that body if the Spirit of
[2:10:34] God comes down and speaks in tongues
[2:10:36] through you guess what I'm part of the
[2:10:38] body and the Spirit of God is speaking
[2:10:40] in tongues through the body prophesying
[2:10:42] through the body guess what as a
[2:10:44] minister of God I'm not outside the body
[2:10:46] you can say you know what the Spirit of
[2:10:48] God is coming down and working right in
[2:10:50] the body that's exactly what the Holy
[2:10:52] Spirit told us through the message of
[2:10:55] Malachi 4 he said God is with us
[2:10:59] appearing in our flesh take back your
[2:11:07] confidence this morning if there's
[2:11:10] something that's hindering that
[2:11:11] confidence maybe it's something you have
[2:11:12] a little feeling against somebody else
[2:11:13] you can never gain confidence if you've
[2:11:16] got that feeling because you're no
[2:11:18] better if our heart condemn us not then
[2:11:23] we have confidence with God
[2:11:25] remember the breastplate is two pieces
[2:11:28] faith and love it works with hope it's
[2:11:31] got to be all together
[2:11:35] if there's anything that would hinder
[2:11:37] confidence get it cleared out and watch
[2:11:42] God just move restoring that confidence
[2:11:47] aren't you glad for the helmet of
[2:11:49] salvation all thank God let's pray
[2:11:55] father Lord you are so mindful of our
[2:12:03] needs you're mindful lord of the needs
[2:12:07] of every one of your children
[2:12:10] Lord many Lord as they're gathered in
[2:12:13] homes Lord weather around Lord their
[2:12:17] tablets their computers their phones
[2:12:22] Lord they're listening to the word of
[2:12:24] the Lord Lord to receive to receive from
[2:12:31] you Lord you know every situation when I
[2:12:41] think of where that Lord even that we're
[2:12:43] at we speak of this and realizing in a
[2:12:46] in a spiritual manner
[2:12:49] Lord as we see that how Satan's army
[2:12:53] comes to destroy Lord we know Lord if
[2:13:01] you tarry even with things Lord that
[2:13:03] would even be coming up Lord in coming
[2:13:06] weeks seeing Lord even now if we have to
[2:13:09] go out and get groceries or wherever
[2:13:11] more
[2:13:13] or people are more and more aware of
[2:13:16] just how close how Lord the virus which
[2:13:20] Lord we know it's a demon that Lord
[2:13:23] would have penetrated move Lord around
[2:13:25] us may we take Lord that helmet of
[2:13:28] salvation
[2:13:31] got up free
[2:13:34] may there not be Lord God fear or worry
[2:13:39] that would Lord hold over any heart or
[2:13:43] any life
[2:13:44] I just read a quote weeks ago where your
[2:13:49] prophet as he was thinking he was so
[2:13:52] thankful he said for medicine and he
[2:13:54] said one of the other things he said I'm
[2:13:55] thankful for is that the invented hand
[2:13:58] soap to wash our hands he said I'm very
[2:14:01] thankful for medical science inventing
[2:14:03] soap
[2:14:06] or Jesus we know that there's
[2:14:09] precautions that we have to take just
[2:14:11] like in every other time even Lord with
[2:14:14] situations that are always around us and
[2:14:18] then we have our eyes on we're trusting
[2:14:22] you Lord God you're seeing a stone or
[2:14:29] there's needs in hearts and lives this
[2:14:31] morning
[2:14:33] now pray God it by your spirit
[2:14:37] anything that's unsettled may it be
[2:14:39] settled maybe they have that confidence
[2:14:42] to come to you our high priest let it be
[2:14:47] said this morning father I pray that may
[2:14:53] you just Lord grant
[2:14:56] Brett more than three
[2:14:59] the peace of God granite Lord for every
[2:15:05] situation
[2:15:06] Lord of confidence Lord seems to have
[2:15:09] been removed may they not just rise now
[2:15:11] Lord in confidence but I pray may they
[2:15:13] allow the Spirit of God to teach him
[2:15:15] Traynham Lord
[2:15:16] how they must stand everything that Lord
[2:15:21] that you spoke to us even from the
[2:15:23] beginning of the service it's laying in
[2:15:25] these promises of God that we would be
[2:15:29] feeding upon the Word of God taking the
[2:15:31] Word of God in as your prophet said when
[2:15:34] we read that verse or that chapter he
[2:15:38] said after you read it say Amen take it
[2:15:42] in or Jesus
[2:15:47] how many times in my own life listening
[2:15:50] to messages reading in the scripture
[2:15:55] sometimes Lord God whether it was then
[2:15:59] or sometimes the Lord sold much of a
[2:16:01] time later on your spirit would move
[2:16:05] down and illuminate a promise something
[2:16:08] Lord that I'd heard and said you know I
[2:16:10] don't think there was something like
[2:16:11] this that I heard it wasn't that my mind
[2:16:14] that I could remember that particular
[2:16:15] verse or the lore the statement verbatim
[2:16:19] that Lord that you had made through the
[2:16:21] Prophet but there would be something
[2:16:22] about it and you would lead me back to
[2:16:24] it Lord I know I'm not the only one that
[2:16:28] happens that way truly Lord many times
[2:16:31] of how that you begin to build a message
[2:16:33] but that happens to us as children of
[2:16:35] God that promise is not exclusive just
[2:16:38] for ministers you send when the Spirit
[2:16:40] of Truth has come he will lead and guide
[2:16:42] us into all truth and he'll bring to
[2:16:45] remembrance those things which he has
[2:16:47] said
[2:16:49] lord help us may we walk like David
[2:16:53] with that helmet of salvation may we
[2:16:56] visit the flowing waters may we Lord God
[2:17:01] allow the waters to flow in our lives
[2:17:04] Lord God may we not Dam it up with
[2:17:07] anything Lord Lord God becomes a
[2:17:10] bottleneck and caused things to grow
[2:17:12] with fungus and mold but may it be Lord
[2:17:15] God a fresh experience bubbling up in
[2:17:18] our life Lord Jesus it's not for us but
[2:17:22] as we give ourselves to you Lord you are
[2:17:25] the fountain of living water well you're
[2:17:29] the one who Lord God brings about those
[2:17:32] smooth stones promises Lord that belong
[2:17:37] to us what I ask you forgive us forgive
[2:17:40] us Lord for times that we've wasted
[2:17:44] forgive us Lord God when our minds have
[2:17:46] been filled with a lot of other stuff
[2:17:50] or lettuce may our minds and our hearts
[2:17:55] be filled with your promises
[2:18:00] help us father I pray in the name of
[2:18:04] Jesus Christ
