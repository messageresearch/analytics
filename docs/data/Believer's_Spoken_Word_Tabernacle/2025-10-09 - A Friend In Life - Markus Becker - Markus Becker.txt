Lord, you're good all the time. And through the darkest of night, I know. My God is good. Oh yes. Oh. Now, let's sing that chorus now. Although I may not even understand all of the plans that you have for me. But I know my life, Lord, is in your hands. And through the eyes of faith, I know I can clearly see that my God is good all the time. Oh yes, Lord. What a song. Put a song of praise deep down in this heart of mine. My God is good. Oh yes.

Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a That's a real testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the times themselves can be very up and down. But God is a constant. &gt;&gt; He's not a variable. He's a constant. &gt;&gt; He's the same. And he's our keeper. He's our anchor through it all. Amen. What holds us and keeps us. Gives us the strength and the encouragement that we have need of day by day and moment by moment. Sometimes you come into a service and you might just feel like I don't think I'm going to be able to put one more step in front of the other. But God's grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; And God God comes down and he has a way of just divinely connecting with us as his children. And you come out of there and my you're refreshed. You're strengthened. You got a brand new vision. All because of him. &gt;&gt; Because it's God watching over his word. &gt;&gt; And he sees to it. His word won't fail. And we're a part of that word. We not just a part of it. We are that word. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're just so thankful. I don't want to take away here tonight, but we are so grateful to have uh brother Marcus here with us tonight and was thankful brother Nathaniel had reached out and uh brother Marcus had um conveyed through there and we were um we met one another. It was back was it 21 or &gt;&gt; 22 somewhere around in there. And uh so as I told you last week, it just really enjoyed brother Marcus's spirit when I first met him. And then just getting a chance just to talk and just to fellowship and my just I just love his approach to the word. And so I I know that God God has something great in store tonight. &gt;&gt; He's going to use the the veil and the flesh of a German But it'll be God. &gt;&gt; God has a way. He hides and reveals himself in simplicity. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we we just want to pull on the gift of God tonight. Amen. I want to just say it's it's just such a such a privilege to be together. And so I wonder if we just couldn't couldn't stand and um uh before as brother Marcus would come and I hope it'd be all right. I just would like to sing that song. We're together again. Amen. &gt;&gt; And maybe just to greet one another in Christian love. And &gt;&gt; it's so wonderful, brothers and sisters, to dwell together in unity. &gt;&gt; It's all because of him. Cuz we're all as different from night is today. Let's just sing this as we invite brother Marcus to come. We're together again. Why don't you shake hands with one another? Bring one another Christian love. The Lord bless you. We're together again. Oh, and one accord. Oh, something good is about to happen. Something good is just in store. We're together again. Oh, just praising the Lord. We're together. Oh, we are together again. Just praising the Lord. Yes, Lord. We are together again in one accord. I know something good is bound to happen. Something good is just in store. We are together again. Oh, just praising the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, while we're standing, let's bow our heads if that's fine for you. Heavenly Father, we thank you for these wonderful songs and for the good atmosphere that we have. And Lord, may you just use me to say the right words. I want to say, Father, especially for those who are a little bit weak in their faith, a little bit people who are standing a little bit in their own way as to say help and encourage those especially among us. Father, may you help me to express the right words and may you help the audience to to receive it in the right way. Father, may you bless this church. May you bless the bride in the US, Father. And definitely, Father, may you bless Israel, Father, because those who bless Israel, they are blessed already. &gt;&gt; So, we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; And while we're standing, let's open the word of the Lord. And I thank very much the musicians in the first book of Samuel chapter 30 verse 1. And it came to pass when David and his men were coming to Ziglac on the third day that the Amalachites had invited us invaded the south and Siglac and smitten Siglak and burned it with fire. And had taken the women captives that were therein. They slew not any either great or small, but carried them away and went on their way. So David and his man came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives. Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until there was no more power to weep. That that is part of our life, too. &gt;&gt; And David's two wives were taken captives. Ahinuim, the Jezraelite, and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite. David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all these people was griefed, every man for his sons and for his daughters. But David encouraged himself in the Lord &gt;&gt; his God. May the Lord add his blessing to the reading of his word. We may be seated and I trust that it is fine for you to put off my jacket. I really want to thank the pastor for the noble invitation and I can just give back the compliments that is seem to be a wonderful man and uh we had a very wonderful fellowship. I thank the Zas family and the church to for the time that is here and this is my last evening in that area and going back to Toronto tomorrow. So my name is Marcus Becker and my pastor is brother Rod Wald in the southern part of Germany and and uh yeah what what what what what can we say more about that? Okay. So, uh I would like to enter directly into the subject is as I want to respect the time when I'm presenting myself and people when I'm preaching somewhere for the first time and there is always a little bit of reservation and it should be that way you know what kind of thoughts the man have where does he come from where do you want to go but I want to say it like this the message that we believe does not come from America. That's right. &gt;&gt; It does not come from Jeffersonville. &gt;&gt; It does not come from brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; The message that we we believe comes from the presence of Almighty. &gt;&gt; It's not an American message. &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a sect. Why should I become sectarian? &gt;&gt; And when you travel a lot, you see so much cold war. &gt;&gt; Cold war pertains to communism. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The message that we believe is not a cult. Why should I become cultish? &gt;&gt; Amen. The message that we believe is not a denomination. Why should I bring the trash of denominations into this message? &gt;&gt; What is the message of the hour? It's our father &gt;&gt; talking to us. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was just a voice, &gt;&gt; but it's not his message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if if you write a letter to your to your wife, &gt;&gt; you will she will never embrace the postman, &gt;&gt; you embrace the man who wrote a letter. &gt;&gt; And the message comes from God. &gt;&gt; It's not brother Ram's message. &gt;&gt; So we understood when I'm traveling around is that you have to have a lot of patience with people because not everybody in the message is spiritual. &gt;&gt; People love God, but many people are not mature. Amen. And that's what we're facing. And you should never lose the love for God's people. &gt;&gt; If you lose that love, you have left everything, lost anything. So we find out that that I would like to entitle that subject for this evening, a friend in life. The message that we believe is not a doctrine. It's a relationship. Amen. It's a relationship between the heavenly father and the earthly bride. &gt;&gt; For 2,000 years, we tried everything. We tried Pentecostalism and it never worked. &gt;&gt; We tried reformation and it never worked. &gt;&gt; We tried legalism and it never worked. &gt;&gt; Legalism is only good to frustrate people. &gt;&gt; We tried Protestantism, it never worked. But the Bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, the mystery of God, &gt;&gt; not mysteries, the mystery, &gt;&gt; what was in the back part of his mind. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon says God wanted to be a father. &gt;&gt; God wants to be touched. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we we see that David was a tremendous man and and he was brought up in a way very uh unprivileged. You see, here is the father and and the new king of Israel is is is to be called, is to be searched. And the father thinks about the biggest and here comes here comes Arnold Schwatzengar and he &gt;&gt; and the prophet said, "God is not in muscles." &gt;&gt; The next one, he he he's intelligent. He can quote, &gt;&gt; but it takes more than just quoting, brother Brennan. Amen. &gt;&gt; It we we we came into a time where the mind of God &gt;&gt; takes the church over. &gt;&gt; Brother Blam said in the seventh seal when the supernatural breaks in that's the mind of God. &gt;&gt; We come we come from our background. I'm a man who has a gift. I'm a man who can preach. Maybe not good but again I can sing. I don't have a golden voice. But I always tell the church, look, God is not interested that we are entering blessed into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; God is not interested that we're just going to be blessed into the tribulation. God wants to take us home. &gt;&gt; So, so one of the things that brother Brandham taught us is never major on a minor. &gt;&gt; It's not a sin. I'm a gifted man when it comes to spiritual gift. But the gift is the minor for me. &gt;&gt; The giver is &gt;&gt; what takes me home. &gt;&gt; There's no gift that takes that gift that that gives me eternal life. &gt;&gt; But once you have the giver, you have everything that you need. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is not interested that we are entering blessed into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; God wants to take us home. And the most important thing is the character of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can only understand you can only grow when when when you understand your father. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good. &gt;&gt; I want to say this message present the Lord Jesus in such a wonderful way. &gt;&gt; Here is David and David un so underprivileged. His own father didn't see the potential in us. Don't don't be frustrated if the world does not know who you are &gt;&gt; unless you know who you are. &gt;&gt; Sometime the church doesn't realize who you are. But it's important that you know who you are. &gt;&gt; And here comes the prophet and he said look God does not see the muscles. God doesn't see the knowledge. I mean God sees what's in the heart of a man. &gt;&gt; So David rose up that way. a man underprivileged and he became such a tremendous man and David had always an integrity for God, &gt;&gt; a character, a loyalty, &gt;&gt; but he made mistakes &gt;&gt; and God God loved to help David because God loves to help his children when our heart is right with God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God has many titles. the rose of Sharon, the lily of the valley, Jehovah, Gyra, and and and but in this generation, he reveals himself as a very present help &gt;&gt; in times of troubles. &gt;&gt; Brother, this message has a father. &gt;&gt; I want to say this. We are the only people on this earth who are not who don't have a religion. Don't make that message to be a religion. This message has a father. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And so so so we see and we want to deal with some of the cases where I'm going to say that that there is cases of people they don't need a doctrine. I mean we have a lot of pictures of brother Brandham in our home. &gt;&gt; But that's not what changes the life of a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Pressure will not change the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride needs love. &gt;&gt; And love is the greatest power there is. Right. &gt;&gt; I always told the the young people, can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That I'm just that I'm just when we were younger, we were not believers. And and and I had two stars in my life. One was Arnold Schwatzenegger and the next one was Sylvester Stallone because we were a bad message believers. And I saw Arnold Schwarzenegger in a film and he used his breast muscle. And I was a skinny boy and I started bodybuilding. I always said the same thing. I repeated yesterday. Everything that you see here was here. It's just a change of dispensation. But I found out if you want to have muscles, you cannot eat McDonald's. &gt;&gt; You need a real steak. And if you want to have spiritual muscle, you cannot eat Facebook. &gt;&gt; You cannot eat Harry Potter. &gt;&gt; You need spiritual food in due season. This message that we believe is Red Bull. &gt;&gt; It's Red Bull. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all things are good. Good music, gifts, church, barbecue, all these things are good. But this is secondary. &gt;&gt; Amen. The first thing is the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; It's he himself. &gt;&gt; When he becomes her and she becomes him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Nothing is wrong but never major on a minor. Right? &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm I'm a person who got got experience. So we have to deal with two kinds of groups of people. There is persons who cannot. And more pressure is toxic for these people and there is pe persons who will not. And we're not talking this evening about pe people who don't want but we talk about people who want but you can't they cannot. Brother, when you become older in the message, you understand one thing. You're not changing anything unless God helps you. &gt;&gt; When we were younger, brother, we were full of zeal and full of naivity. But today, we understand, look, God has to do certain things. &gt;&gt; Amen. More pressure does not bring more results. &gt;&gt; But revelation is the greatest power that there is. &gt;&gt; It's the love divine. You can never separate revelation and love because revelation is not knowledge. Knowledge makes you arrogant &gt;&gt; and me myself. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But brother brother sister I have a good news for you. Sometime we have to correct a little bit and and but I want to tell you this gospel is always good news. &gt;&gt; If it's not good news anymore then it loses its it its flavor. The good news is we have a father. &gt;&gt; Now to understand the family of God, we have to understand one thing that me personally I created many things but I have only one daughter. Brother Brandon said in a quote he says the first thing that came out of God was that logos. &gt;&gt; And then he says the first thing that God created were the angels. Quote brother Brandon and Bose is right. What is the difference between the logos and the and the angels? The angels were created. &gt;&gt; Amen. My daughter, the difference between my creations and my daughter is part of me is in my daughter. My DNA. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the logos is not a second person in the Godhead. Forget this. It's the same person. &gt;&gt; God became &gt;&gt; but it's the same person. Amen. &gt;&gt; Out of that logos came Melzdc. &gt;&gt; Out of Melzdc came Jesus Christ. And brother Bram said the bride was in him &gt;&gt; as as Eve was in Adam. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? That when God called Adam, two people came. &gt;&gt; Two people came because Eve had no name. &gt;&gt; Eve was just woman taken from the man. &gt;&gt; God said, "Adam, where are you?" and Eve and Adam came. Eve got her name later. &gt;&gt; So whenever the Bible speaks of Christ and brother said you must see Christ in every verse in the Bible, there you see the brideal &gt;&gt; because she's brother and sister. I want to tell you this. This is your book. &gt;&gt; This is your story. &gt;&gt; We are not here because of William Brandon. We were here already in the mind of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, I sent you the prophet Elijah. But that what it means. I mean I mean if if the bride was in Christ in what form ever? Okay I'm not speculating. Just say what the prophet say. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the bride was in Melzdc. &gt;&gt; And when the bride was in Melzdc, she was in the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; And when the pillar when she was in the pillar of fire, the bride was in God. &gt;&gt; Brother, I tell you one thing. Brother Brim said God made a picture of us before the foundation of the world. And here and here we were. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God takes our souls and throws them in seven church ages over seven continents. And God put part of himself into us because David said in the Psalms, God made everything perfect in his time. He even placed eternity into our hearts. And there is only one who is eternal. That's God himself. &gt;&gt; So God throw our souls in seven church ages. And when seven church ages are over, the whole family is there. &gt;&gt; Nobody's missing. &gt;&gt; Brother Benny was the first messenger who could say God is not anymore complete without you. &gt;&gt; Brother, nobody can preach you into the bride &gt;&gt; and nobody can preach you out of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's people are not driven by fear but by love to the father. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, when we preach, we don't speak preach to to colors. &gt;&gt; It's too late for superior complexes and it's too late for inferior complex. We don't talk to colors. We talk to theophanes &gt;&gt; to the inner man to the heavenly that built that being that is that is definitely there. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we understand nobody can preach you in. Nobody can preach you out. Not even your thoughts will bring you out. &gt;&gt; You will pay. We will pay for our our thoughts. &gt;&gt; But the plan of God is eternal. &gt;&gt; So here, brother Bray said, "The eternal thoughts of God." Let me ask you, are the thoughts of God eternal? If you can see this, you will see many things. &gt;&gt; That's what he says. &gt;&gt; If you don't see this, you just see God send a prophet. &gt;&gt; Brother, to see to see brother Brandham in the Bible is not very difficult. But you must see yourself. That's right. &gt;&gt; You must find your name in that book &gt;&gt; because brother Blam said the believers are the words in that book. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the seven seals were revealed, we were revealed. &gt;&gt; Where we came from, what we do on earth, where we go back to. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? He said they are not simply like a man with a blueprint who has drawn up which one day will be translated into substance and form but they are already real and eternal and part of God. &gt;&gt; There's a quote when brother Brandham says and please understand it the right way I don't have time. Uh he says he says God in the beginning was alone with his thoughts. In other words, he wasn't alone [Laughter] &gt;&gt; because his thoughts are eternal. They are substance. They are part of him. &gt;&gt; God knew. There's people that God thought about. Therefore, brother B can say the go the Beatles were not even in the mind of God. Was God surprised when the Beatles came? He knows everything. &gt;&gt; But they are people who are the thoughts of God expressed on this earth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So here's what brother Brham said. Just like a little dew drop. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have a bride and we have a church. There's always time to evangelize because it's still time to say whosoever come let him come. &gt;&gt; Still time for that. Okay. But if you were not in the beginning in his mind, you will never become upright. &gt;&gt; But you can receive eternal life. Definitely. So &gt;&gt; just like a little dew drop. I don't know much about chemistry, but it must be that's the congelling of humidity on the stand or atmosphere. And when the nights get cold and dark, it falls from heaven and drops upon the ground. It fell from somewhere. But the next morning before the sun comes up, it's laying there. The little fellow shivering. Just let the sun come up. Watch it go to shining. It's happy. Why? The sun is going to call it right back to where it come from. That's good. &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have three pulls and no three pushes. &gt;&gt; Nobody has to push the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way with the Christian says brother Brandham. Hallelujah. We know when we walk into the presence of God, something in us tell us that we come from somewhere and we are going back again by the power that's pulling us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the pre-existence of Marcus Becca, but the word that laid in us was part of us of him. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? The sun is pulling &gt;&gt; the little Therefore, we live in the time where the sun went up. The night is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, it's the rising of the sun. What to do? To pull us. &gt;&gt; Therefore, there's a man who can turn on the light. That's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Therefore, and I hope you see it the same way. If not, you just add it to my ignorance. We live in Lauda. Definitely. So, it's a seven church age. But the bride cannot be in Laia. &gt;&gt; A person said to me, "Brother Marcus, we are in La." I said, "Maybe you, but not me." &gt;&gt; He said, "Because I'm not blind. &gt;&gt; I'm not miserable. &gt;&gt; I'm not wretched." Because brother Blame said, "My ministry is to declare that he is here. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; But we live in loudies here. That's that's that's fine &gt;&gt; because the president of the of the of the millennium is not Mr. Trump &gt;&gt; though he is tremendous &gt;&gt; tre unbelievable that's fine but this is for this time here this is for this earth okay &gt;&gt; amen okay so keep a balance in all thing keep a balance in all thing can you say amen &gt;&gt; so we understand that brother Brandon explains where a shock come from amnesia now this amnesia we are told it's caused it came to a place where you cannot identify yourself in other words you don't know who you Ah, that's an unusual thing. It don't happen too often, but it's caused from a shock. Brother Bram speaks about World War I. And these people, they were shocked. It's somebody that don't even know who they are. They find it war. Sometimes soldiers get it. Sometimes people get it. Another thing cause it is the worry. Worry will cause it. Worry has no virtue to it at all. Therefore, if you cannot handle the news, read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; If you cannot handle the news, read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; No worry. And he says, "Now worry sometime cause it." Another thing that caused it among the people is getting between two opinions. That will cause amnesia. That's right. Therefore, every pastor protects his pullpit that not one is pulling in this direction, one in this. &gt;&gt; Now, look, &gt;&gt; when we came on earth, we wanted to go directly into our theophony, but we landed in Lorraine. God never asked you, do you want to be male or do you want to be female? Never. Nobody asked you, brother. It's a funny thing, but I come from a broken home. &gt;&gt; I come from a broken home. I never choose my home. I was 14 years old. I ready to die because I had cancer and God's miraculously healed me without we were not believers at that time. &gt;&gt; There are there's people who have a very difficult fate, a very difficult family situation. &gt;&gt; But one thing is sure, brother, if you think you came the wrong way on this earth, be sure you will leave the right way. &gt;&gt; Be sure this is transforming process. &gt;&gt; Nobody ask you want to be rich or want to be poor. Nobody asked you want to be black or white. Nobody asked you. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said this quote, brother Brandham in the message, things that are to be. God pre-planned &gt;&gt; your birth for many generations. &gt;&gt; You're not you you're here because God wants you to be here. &gt;&gt; Amen. You your life is not an accident. &gt;&gt; You are desired. You are here because your father wanted you to be here exactly in that time. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we wake up in a body that we don't like &gt;&gt; when I wake up in the morning, I look in the mirror. I said, "I don't know you, but I wash you anyhow." Amen. We we we come in families that we don't like. &gt;&gt; Brother, we we I never had a father and I so much hated my life. Run away from home. It's a long story, but I want to be don't want to become emotional this evening. I'm an emotional type. I'm a little bit of an evangelist. Therefore, I'm a little bit like who I am. Okay, that's how he is. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus when I was 20, 21 years old. And one of the first thing that God revealed to me was that he was my father. &gt;&gt; Since that time, &gt;&gt; I'm not fatherless. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, as as as earthly fathers, we made a lot of mistakes. &gt;&gt; But there so important to connect your children with the Lord Jesus Christ because he is the father. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? Here is that prodigal son. And people ask the question, where are all the miracles? Where are the sign? I tell you, our life is the miracle. &gt;&gt; We are the miracles. We are what God did in our life is the greatest miracle there is. &gt;&gt; Never let Satan tell you a complex. This is the most glorious time that there ever was on earth. There's never been a day like this day before. This day, this scripture is fulfilled. Three years ago, it was a prophecy. Now it's history, brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So here we go. So here we go. And we we we we we are in that connection. Amen. That we live in a body. We live in a society. Amen. And have you ever thought about that? And if I'm walking out, I trust it's good for the pastor because I have no notes. I just speak from my heart and that is always the best. But I have my red line that therefore I have make the slide. It keeps me a little bit my on my track. When Adam and Eve came in the Garden of Eden, they came as adults. &gt;&gt; They didn't come as babies. They came as adults. &gt;&gt; Okay. But we didn't come as adults. We went we we we wanted to come in our theophony, but we had to go first to the birth channel. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I was there at the birth of my daughter. My wife needed one midwife. I needed two. &gt;&gt; Honest. Honest. I'm That's too much for a man. I I was I I was I was finished. I mean, a birth is is something is really something. It it makes a hard man's tremble. &gt;&gt; So So the whole our whole birth was nothing else than a shock. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the midwife took us and gave us a spanky. That was the beginning. That was the welcoming part of this earth. &gt;&gt; The midwife said, "You will get more in life. You will see." You see? But look what brother said. A shock caused amnesia. We came on earth and didn't know who we were. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's so good, &gt;&gt; brother. I I was in the world. I could dance like Michael Jackson. Honest. I But I had to promise my daughter that I didn't do it behind the pulpit. Okay. I could I could do the moonwalk like Michael Jackson. Brother, I did not know who I was, but the great eagle knew there is an X somewhere. &gt;&gt; That was the difference. We did not know the Lord Jesus, but the Lord Jesus knew us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He said, "Brother Marcus, what kind of doctrine do you have this evening?" I have a father. He calls me his own. Long before even time began, my life was in his &gt;&gt; Amen. There was so many problems in the life of Job. &gt;&gt; And brother brother, I we will see it. I hope I'm coming through, but I want to stop at a certain time to to to not to to be respectful to the church. But job in that situation, brother, and here come the brothers, they mean well. Everybody who wants to help you means well. But the great pioneist by the name of I think it was Rubenstein, he was asked the question, Mr. Rubenstein, is it difficult to play piano? He said, no, it's not difficult. You just have to put down the right buttons at the right time. That's that's all what piano is. &gt;&gt; And and to have a leadership of God, it's so easy. You just must say the right thing at the right time to the right person in the right spirit and he has to receive it in the right way to understand the right thing what you said rightly. So easy to have a brother. If people go through difficult situations sometime no words is the best word &gt;&gt; not interfere in the things that we do not understand anyhow. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Can you say amen so far? &gt;&gt; So we see that that that we are depending on on God. And here is Job and those youngsters they meant well. The first was a nice Lutheran. He said Job I mean the problem but only believe. I mean when we were younger we had these Bible slogans &gt;&gt; but you cannot do nothing without God. &gt;&gt; Uh only believe the prophet said I have a quote and thank you for the quote. Thanks I appreciate this but I need the right word at the right time. You understand? &gt;&gt; The second one was a nice methodist. He said Job what you need is uh that it that it shivers down your back. And we love that we I come out of Pentecost. We love these things but to be honest that's not the answer for our question. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can have wonderful meetings. We can have wonderful conventions, great things, but it's not the answer. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Unless the Lord does something by his word in our life. The third one is a is is a Pentecost. He said, Job, you must you must speak in tongues. And we love those things. But it doesn't change Job. &gt;&gt; The fourth one was God. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said El was eloo. &gt;&gt; El Shai &gt;&gt; in a man. And he said, "Job, look, &gt;&gt; your life is only 60, I say my own word, is 60, 70 years, but God will bring you back into your youth because somebody paid a price for you." &gt;&gt; And Job said, "I know that my redeemer lives." And then God comes and said, "Who is the one darkening the counsel of God?" Job stop to be a teenager. Stop to be a child. Speak to me as a man. That's right. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that God calls the church into a maturity? &gt;&gt; We are not teenagers anymore. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he just asked him one question. Job, I know all your life is a misle misery. But where were you boy &gt;&gt; when the sons and daughters were shouting for God? &gt;&gt; Job understands. I must make the picture of my life bigger than I thought it. Our life is more than just 70 years in Lorraine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or in Ohio. Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we understand this. So here we see now please understand I have to do work in my work. I h I'm working as a social worker in the integration. I have to help people in integration. Please understand that people who are non-believers they have a soul. Well, when we were young in the message, we were just young. We were just teenagers. We everybody had the eagle belt &gt;&gt; and the eagles. And nothing wrong with that. Come on. Okay. One of the ministers in the Germany had had seven angels tattoo. &gt;&gt; The only thing that that that we're missing is the eagle piercing. But one day somebody will invent this with all. But brother, that's fine having the eagle belt and the eagle tie and so forth. But the eagle must be here, &gt;&gt; brother. You must be here, &gt;&gt; brother. And we had that arrogance around us &gt;&gt; that we could not shake. We were so revelated for some time that we couldn't shake a hand to somebody else who doesn't have that same &gt;&gt; standard, brother. It's a complex. &gt;&gt; It's a question of lack of maturity. If we have, if you are a strong brother, then help your weak brother. Give him a helping hand. Help him a little bit up. Encourage him a little bit and said, "Hey, the Lord Jesus died for you the same as for me. Because revelation is progressive men. &gt;&gt; Unbelievers have feelings. &gt;&gt; They have a life. And brother Ramy said life was precious in the eyes of God. &gt;&gt; Now if you see a bump, a vagabond in the street, brother, for us it's just a vagabond. But definitely he's a boy of a mama. For mama, it's my boy. &gt;&gt; And maybe that same man is the father of a little daughter. And for the little daughter, that's her father. I tell you one thing, you are never wrong in respecting people. &gt;&gt; We're never wrong in that. You're never you you're never right in despising people. You will never help people by despising. &gt;&gt; So here we have two people by the name of France Beckenbower and and and Bertie Folks. Two uh soccer players both very very successful as players and as trainers. France Buck as coaches. France Beckenbower he was always let me say he he was healthy in his self-esteem okay &gt;&gt; he said he said look when when they were losing a match he said look what's the problem next match we're winning what's the problem okay and Mr. Folks was as he as successful as Mr. Beckenbower but he was always somehow defending himself. Okay. Uh you must understand the defense uh made mistakes in their tactic and the midfielders they did this and you understand and they try to find out where's the difference and they found the difference in their youth in their childhood because Mr. Beckenbar comes from a wealthy family. &gt;&gt; His father is a was a prominent person. His uncle was prominent and Mr. folks. But in comparison, he was a foster child. He had no father and he had no mother. And they found out that the bonding and the life of a person the first three years is so important. &gt;&gt; The bonding, not the doctrine, the bonding, &gt;&gt; the warmness. Brother, if we take the empathy out of that message, we don't have anything anymore. We just have a cold formal doctrine. Not not more. Right. &gt;&gt; But this message came to reveal a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bonding to the Lord Jesus Christ and I thought sorry for this is a little bit my throat and I thought by myself if the bonding in the natural in the family is so important for the development of the character of the personality of a child what about the bonding with my heavenly father &gt;&gt; brother? If if if we're preaching a God who is always uh unsatisfied, who is always criticizing us and we preached it long enough, okay? A God who is standing there who is happy if we miss the rapture. Amen. Because we if people were rejoicing a little bit, we said remember it's only few very We are few this evening. &gt;&gt; We are not much people. We are not millions here. It's not it's not the stadium of Cleveland. We are few people &gt;&gt; but people like to make it fewer and fewer. &gt;&gt; Okay, that you always went out of the church. I said when I came in I thought I have the Holy Ghost but now I know. You see false preaching can take everything away from you. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; You see, so you you present a father who is always whatever you do, had you did you ever had a father in your life and I speak those who whose father was not a Christian that you felt your father was never never satisfied with you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Whatever you do did it was never enough. &gt;&gt; Brother, we we we we we rose up. I'm a German. We don't show too much emotion. That is our problem. But I tell you this, with the Holy Ghost, we are able to break that circle &gt;&gt; and we have to do it. &gt;&gt; And here and and and and that's part of a father. But if you show a father who helps you, a father who wants you to make the rapture, who does everything that you make the rapture, then you can sing what a friend I have in Jesus. &gt;&gt; It depends on the picture that we have of the almighty God. And I don't speak about the group who doesn't want a person says look I want to live in sin I want to live in immortality I want to drink I want to smoke I want and want I want to sing in the choir and you say no you can drink you can smoke you can live however you want but not here &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about people who want to be right with God but they cannot achieve it somehow. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's the woman. Please understand. Amen. This also know that in the last days perilious times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own self, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, uh uh without natural affection. Please understand, when I was younger and I was reading this, I thought they are monsters. &gt;&gt; But they are not monsters. They are human beings. But we live in a sick society &gt;&gt; and sick generation produces sicker children. It's not the fault of the little ones. the next generation will be even more sicker. And there's one remedy for a sick generation. It's healthy families. &gt;&gt; And healthy churches &gt;&gt; with a warmness, with an understanding, with a helping hand, with the love of God directing us. &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen people that were so revelated in the message, but it was pure arrogance? &gt;&gt; That's that's not what this message came for. &gt;&gt; It made us in the image of our own father. But that's what the message came for. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, here is Joyce Mia. And we can sing about Joyce Meer. I agree with you. Just a woman preacher, a prosperity gospel and so forth. And and I looked up her life because we had some people one time they were a little bit fans of her. And Joyce Meer doctrinally is completely wrong denomination. We understand all that thing. But she has a tremendous testimony because as a child, she was abused by her own father. Sexually abused over and over and over and over. and she threw away her life, lived in the streets. You know what she said? But one day the Lord Jesus found me &gt;&gt; and established me and I came to be a minister to proclaim the good news in her way. We let don't think doctrinally. &gt;&gt; But I thought by myself if the Lord Jesus can do it in a denomination, what can he do in the message? &gt;&gt; If he can do it in a denomination, what can he do? So never give up people. &gt;&gt; Never give them up. God has the last words. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Brother, when we were younger, I tell you one thing. We were full of zeal, full of energy, and full of naivity. I remember myself, we came to the Lord and I thought whole Germany comes to the message by that's what we thought, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And then God said, "Okay, Marcus is a fine boy, but we have to mold his character a little bit." And then it went by and you get it. And then and after all these years we &gt;&gt; today we pray different. Lord keep me on the way. &gt;&gt; Lord give me a pure heart. Give me a right integrity. Let that capstone not be just a doctrine. Let it be part of my life. &gt;&gt; We have to understand as ministers these youngsters they look upon us &gt;&gt; and that's a good thing. They watch our behavior. They watch how we talk, how we handle things and they have a right to do this. &gt;&gt; That's right. But I want to tell you thing time means nothing for God. &gt;&gt; When you were young I see you say say you we we together we're family when we were young we were praying we were praying many many good things but we forgot our own prayers over the years &gt;&gt; but God did not forget them. &gt;&gt; Time means nothing for God. &gt;&gt; Space means nothing for God. God remembers our prayers when we were young 40 years ago. God remembers them. For them, they are still there. Therefore, we consecrate the children to the Lord knowing, Lord, one day my arm will be too short. Amen. But your hand will never be too short. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I give them back into your hand because I do my best. But salvation doesn't come from parents. Salvation comes from God. &gt;&gt; Brother, I do you did your best. And and people are so sometimes so so so uh are so how they are. Okay. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So we understand. Amen. We live in a sick society. &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand the people. Have have a have a feeling for them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Bride is bride. Therefore, I made the introduction. Nobody can preach someone into the bride. &gt;&gt; But there's still a hope for a person. &gt;&gt; People say there is no way. Jesus is the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have Jesus, you have a way. Brother Marcus, I'm in a dead end. You're not in a dead end. With the Lord Jesus, you have a way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way where there seems to be no way. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's what we tell the youngsters. Don't give up in your life. Never give up. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't give up because you have a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not yet you holding up the message that you you're doing in the beginning, but there comes a time when this message carries you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That picture is a is not a father. It's not a grandfather. It's a father. &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a little of a little girl. And uh this is a is a wedding ceremony. It's his own daughter. So the father has cancer. It's an unbeliever. It was over in there in Holland in in in in the news. He's an unbeliever, but he has cancer. He will die soon. But look the understanding that he has of a father. So what they are doing with his little daughter, they are playing marriage and he brings his daughter to the altar knowing that in a couple of weeks he will die and that girl one day will marry and they plan to continue the marriage from that moment on where she stands at the altar so that she can say my father brought me to the altar. &gt;&gt; Brother I told by myself if an unbeliever have such a concept of a father what about us who have the holy ghost? What about us, brother? These youngsters, they need a father. &gt;&gt; They need a mother. &gt;&gt; They need someone who hugged them. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's brother Brandham. I'm hurrying through. Amen. Here's brother Brandon. And he was so he was so happy when the car was full and they went over from Jefferson Will to Tucson. Rebecca said, "Brother, my father went back into the car and they had a little picture of a of a little angel." Amen. And and what did what did brother Bannon want to show his daughter, little one, honey, sugar, however you want to call it, daddy's not always with you. Do we tell those our children? We're not always with them. We have a little span of time, but in that time, we want to make a connection between you and the Lord Jesus that when I'm leaving, I know you're in the best hands that there is. &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, it matters to serve the Lord. It matters to take the family and pray together. A family that prays together stays together &gt;&gt; in the evening. Amen. Take your children and tell them how you how much you love them. &gt;&gt; People say, "Brother Marcus, we don't have time for this. We don't have time for this. You have to major on a minor." Amen. Remember God had many many things to do, &gt;&gt; lot of angels, &gt;&gt; lot of planets, the Milky Way, a lot of things to organize. But his family was for him so important that every evening he came down in the cool of the evening. &gt;&gt; Again, &gt;&gt; working is not sin. Making money is not sin. Building house is not sin. But ma never major on a minor. &gt;&gt; God and the souls first. &gt;&gt; God does not want us to go blessed into the tribulation. &gt;&gt; We're not we God wants to prepare us to go home. Make make your your bullet list. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And have number one first and that's the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; That's not having just Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So here brother Brandon takes it on a higher level that brother Brandon was asked two times the question. Your own angel is your theophony. &gt;&gt; Questions and answers two times. Brother Brandon please explain about our personal angel. And then brother Bra said he says and preach for two for two pages blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. I said blah blah blah blah blah blah and the last phrase he said yes that is your theophony the body in which you go when you die. What was the question? Brother Brandon please explain about our personal ancient. Brother Brandon please explain about the angel that beholding the face of the father all the time. Brother Brham said yes that's the body that you enter into when you die. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, brother, sister, when you die, God is not thinking. Um, will Marcus Becker get a theophony? Uh, was he always in church? Did he pay his tithings? Rather, Paul said, "We know &gt;&gt; that we have." &gt;&gt; When this earthly body &gt;&gt; will be dissolved. We know. We have. We will not earn it. &gt;&gt; We have &gt;&gt; by what? By God's grace. &gt;&gt; Brother Marcus, will you make the rapture? I make the rapture by God's grace &gt;&gt; because if I have to do it with my own power, forget it. &gt;&gt; Don't ever start. But I have a father, &gt;&gt; brother. Brother, that your own theophony will would take you home. &gt;&gt; It was not Elijah searching the chariots. &gt;&gt; It was the chariot finding Elijah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Therefore, and I don't make a doctrine out of it, but let's say what the prophet says, okay? I put just my name into it, okay? He said, "Quickening power brought me. Let me see behind the curtain of time, and I've seen all of you there." And I said, "I was there." &gt;&gt; Was it a vision? I couldn't say what it was, but I believe he must have seen Marcus Becca. What is the reason or what is my proof? My proof is that I love the Lord Jesus and this message so much. So, I must be part of the word. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the difference. A pre a brother said one time, "The church goes to church, but the bride comes to the word." &gt;&gt; Brother, I've seen too much people. Look, there is a song service, okay? And and I mean, if you're in Africa, okay, uh that's fine. I'm quite sportive, okay? But they're more sportive than us, okay? So for so for 30 minutes higher higher higher higher lower lower higher higher higher for 30 minutes. Okay, that's fine. There's nothing against it's not a sin. But then the word start and the whole church understand after 30 minutes of kalanetics after 30 then then you're finished. You see and then some of the people they are just and then there's there's only one way to wake them up is when the minister said I now come to the end and every minister is a little bit of a psychologist. She just continue continue after 50 minutes my last thought. Amen. Okay. And then the same people when the service is over and the worship start they are there brother that is minoring on the major. &gt;&gt; The major is the word &gt;&gt; because music will not form my character. Transforming power is in the word of the Lord. Though all these things are good nothing will nothing but never major on a minor. You understand that? &gt;&gt; So, we understand. Look, come on. Here's Mike Tyson. That was one of the stars when we were younger. Tyson, they call he said in the interview, he said, "I I I want I want to push the nose of my enemy right into his brain." Oh, and we said, "Oh, what a monster." But Mike Tyson said this, "And keep these things in mind." Amen. Keep one thing in mind. what this miss uh the woman preacher uh what she said she said she said a sentence that I never forgot. She said people who got hurt do silly things. That is the reason where a church must pay attention why somebody left. Why somebody has hard times and if we're not careful we are then bringing blame upon that person. People who got hurt do silly things. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Never throw dirt to people who leave the church. They have their reason. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sometime it's just a hurt in their human spirit. If they if they're God's children, God calls them back. &gt;&gt; Just keep them up in your prayer. Just speak highly of these people. I mean, you know why we are not a sect? And I'm just I'm jumping a little bit because I follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost. You know why we are not a sect? A sect always works with membership, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Ah, you are here in that building and you must understand uh we are the super eagles. We're not only a church. We we are we are the church. I just so wonderful the church. Now I'm so impressed the church and and and here come just here just we're just the chosen. We're really so a person leaves the church because he got hurt. Okay. Now the church has to defend itself. You must understand brother so and so left us because he was never part of us. It's very simple. For many many years you call him brother and sister and now you left him because he he was never part of us. So after some years the person e confesses his sin gives his heart to the Lord Jesus Christ and he comes back to the same church and the people say oh before the foundation of the world we were always eagles we were always together. Brother, who wants to believe that if a person is a brother, he's a brother. &gt;&gt; If he's part of the family of God, nothing will take him out of the hand of God. &gt;&gt; We must be very very wise because the person might not hear us. But the youngsters there listen very carefully how we deal with these kind of people. &gt;&gt; And if we need if we need credibility, if we want to have credibility, we must have character to deal with this situation. God allows us that we get sometime difficult people in the church and God just wants to see how we get along with these people. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So here's Mike Tyson. He said he said all these muscles I built up to to to protect my little soul. That's what he says. &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a quote, huh? Mike Tyson, he said, "As a boy, I was a sensitive boy and they hurt so much my feelings that I built up all these muscles so I could give everyone a knockout." Mike Tyson became Muslim &gt;&gt; and he became Christian, a Baptist. &gt;&gt; That's what I want to say. You can change or we can change our religion three times a year. We can change our doctrine. We can change our church, but we will not change the inside unless the Holy Ghost comes. &gt;&gt; Amen. We must. A person says, "Brother Marcus, I'm leaving your church because there's so much I have so much problems with the people in that church. I'm leaving your church." I said, "You can go, but the greatest problem goes with you. &gt;&gt; That's you yourself." &gt;&gt; We can change our doctrine. We can change our our our way of of seeing things but it's so important that we are changed on the inside &gt;&gt; that the mind of Christ takes over. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But please understand that many people who are puffed up in their mind they have a soul which is very very sensitive. &gt;&gt; If you deal with people you must understand that some are just playing. They are not what they are. And you once you see it, you can deal with them in the right way. People who got hurt back. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; People who got hurt back. &gt;&gt; And if you understand this, you don't take all things too serious. You understand this answer comes from a hurt feeling. Amen. Once you see it, you take that situation under your control. Brother Billy Paul. Because if you deal with people, you must understand the human being. Brother Billy Paul, he brought us a very very nice example. He said he said he was with his father and his father had to correct a brother. And brother, it's so important that God corrects us. But if we're honest with one another, we have we don't have always the disponyability to be corrected. &gt;&gt; I don't say you, I said we. It takes the right atmosphere to really get a real correction. &gt;&gt; Amen. Honest all of us. Okay. Billy, brother Brandma understood the people. He said to Billy Paul, "Billy, Billy uh on on that on that on that on that uh hunting trip." He said, "Billy, look, I have to correct brother so and so this evening, but he will not take the correction. There will be a tension then between us." Huh? If we are at the fireplace this evening, you ask me a certain and certain question. I will answer you the question and he gets his answer. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God is a gentleman. &gt;&gt; God loves to correct us, but he waits for the time that we can take it. Brother brother, if you're if you're old enough in the in the message, you learn to have patience with yourself. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And once you have patience with yourself, you have patience with your children &gt;&gt; and you have patience with people in the church because you understand my brother cannot change unless God is changing the situation. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I make two two I'm I'm I'm going fast. Marilyn Monroe. Now here comes the angel of the Lord and God's brother. God is responsible for people not only for the bride. Amen. God loves people. Therefore, God so much loved the world. Here's the angel of the Lord comes to the prophet. Speaks about a young woman by the name of Marilyn Monroe. She will die in that in that minute. &gt;&gt; If God cares for Mary Monroe, be sure God cares for our children. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And God cares for us. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happens is is and it might be humorous, but please understand one thing. The angel told brother Brandham the minute when Mary and Monroe will die. When we were born, our date of expire is already on our front. &gt;&gt; If you want to do something for God, do it today. &gt;&gt; If you want to tell your children how much you love them, don't wait for the funeral. &gt;&gt; If you want to tell your parents, look, mama, dad, I want to tell you one thing. I I I don't understand everything, but I want to show you that I was privileged to be in a house like this. If you want to tell a man, a man of God, if you want to tell anybody in the church how much in in in silence you have an appreciation, tell her today because you don't know if there is a tomorrow. &gt;&gt; If you want to serve the Lord, young young people, I'm a don't ask for tomorrow. Say today. &gt;&gt; If you want to give your heart to the Lord Jesus, don't wait for the next youth camp. Say &gt;&gt; once you listen to the voice of God, I'm I say yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So when we were born the date of our expire is already on our front or the rapture. God knows each and everyone who is in the rapture. &gt;&gt; Therefore he calls us bride and not church. &gt;&gt; Brother said I hope you understand what I say. I don't call you don't call you church anymore. I call you bright. &gt;&gt; So people in Germany I mean that little lifespan 70 80 years. Amen. If you become older you understand every now every day every every year becomes precious. Brother, I was never in a false doctrine system. But I I I feel sorry that I missed too many years in this message by my own caralology. I was not in the world. I had the Holy Ghost relatively fast. I was a clean boy right through. But I was too childish for many situations. Was just canality. Okay. We were talking about things that we never understood. We were judging things that we never understood. God could never use it because we had that arrogant spirit. So we have these some years on this earth. I want to say this, let's do something with it. &gt;&gt; When my father asked me, I want to say, Lord, I did something with my life. It was not only I'm saved. No, I wanted to be a blessing &gt;&gt; for the people around me. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So there's a there's a movement in Germany which which speaks of healthy living. Okay. It's a little it's jokey but but but behind every joke is a truth. So you can eat eat healthy and you can live healthy but when your time is up you die healthy. &gt;&gt; When your time is up your time is up. &gt;&gt; So therefore the youngsters you can go to McDonald's when when our time we we can just eat broccoli the whole day but when our time is up our time is up. Do you understand this? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Here's brother Brandham. He said, "I wanted to come to that young woman, Marilyn Monroe." He She said that woman, she was always sad. Now, Marian woman was the nicest woman on earth. But brother Ram said she was always sad. Do you understand that outward beauty does not make you happy? &gt;&gt; Do you understand that brother Bram didn't preach legalism? I mean I mean if if a man if you present yourself as a young girl and a man marries just your carcass. Is that the right word? The car of a car. Is that correct? Correct. No. Your carery. Okay. Of your the model model T or whatever. And the boy loves only your body. Do you understand that you have to make one diet after the other? So that your husband in 20 years will still love that same body. &gt;&gt; But if a boy loves your spirit, he will always love you. &gt;&gt; If a boy loves your being, you know, even you become older. Therefore, brother said, uh Sarah got older and the eyes of Abraham got dimmer. Amen. I wish you a husband who loves your spirit &gt;&gt; because he will always love you. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you become gray and old and whatever, you know. Amen. But but somebody who loves your being. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So So brother Brammy said this. She needed a real case of salvation. Something that gives security in her heart. Her father she has never seen. Her mother was in the insane institution. All that was on the mind of that girl. She needed Christ. &gt;&gt; You see how brother Bram speaks different about those Jezebels. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that God understands life? And on the white throne judgment, God will be a true judge. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. That's right. &gt;&gt; Our father, he will judge things rightly. &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. &gt;&gt; Some of the people, they did not have any kind of chance. &gt;&gt; Brother, I had to deal with people who left the message. And I always tell this, they never left the message. They left a fanaticism in this message. &gt;&gt; They got a complete perverted picture of the message and of the messenger and of the Lord Jesus Christ. They had no chance. It's in their mind. But God will be a a a right a good judge. God will understand. Can you say amen? I'm hurrying through &gt;&gt; here. That other second woman you can call it brother Marcus. That's Liz Taylor. That is a girl. Same history. I mean in Hollywood. I mean at that age with that picture she's 16 years old. Do we understand that every person needs some good words? Because she says in her own biography, when I got my first compliments, definitely was sexual compliments. I mean, I longed for these kind of compliments. So, he became more and more worldly like a Jezebel. But behind, but don't look the outside. Here is a soul. Here's a heart craving &gt;&gt; because we must understand that we're not robots. We are not computers. We are human beings. I tell you one thing. Brother Brmond said, "Every woman wants to be pretty. There's nothing wrong with that. &gt;&gt; We went to the time when we when our girl when when everybody wanted to be a scarecrow and we and we thought that's spiritual. The more scarecrow, the more spiritual." But brother said, "Every woman wants to be pretty." And there's nothing wrong to be pretty. The only thing is you shouldn't be sexy. That is the difference. &gt;&gt; That's And brother Brmond said, "Every man wants to be successful. There's &gt;&gt; nothing wrong but bring it in the right channel. &gt;&gt; But every woman, every person needs some good words, &gt;&gt; some empathy, some feelings. Therefore, when we pray, we don't just tell God what to do. We expect that God tells something to us. &gt;&gt; Now, our young girls, they have long hair and they have long dresses. They need a compliment. Now, who will give them the compliment? the school, &gt;&gt; the world. &gt;&gt; No, that must be daddy. Daddy must tell his children, "Honey, I see you. You're looking great." &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's what we should do &gt;&gt; to tell our children how much we care for them, what they mean to us. Not not to take these things as granted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I can tell the brother now you're a wonderful brother and you made a good song service and wonderful. That's fine. But if their own father said, I want to tell you one thing. I'm so proud of my boy. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That means a lot for a boy. &gt;&gt; We come from a generation where we did not give much compliments. We took things for granted. But but but but there is a generation who must break the cycle. &gt;&gt; Brother, my my daughter was marrying a couple of weeks ago and I didn't make the didn't make the the the ceremony because my daughter thought papa's always so embarrassing. So they asked the other pre preacher to make that's fine but I said give me five minutes and my daughter was sitting there and the boy was sitting there and the audience was sitting there and I said I want to tell you one thing I'm a father of a daughter and my daughter was always a darling I consider my daughter to be a present from the Lord. &gt;&gt; I was so proud and I was so happy for 20 years together. I thank you so much. We thank God for our child that became a friend in our life. So we wish you from all our heart the very best for the future life. It is so important that we express those things &gt;&gt; because people are human beings. They need &gt;&gt; some kind of a good words. &gt;&gt; That is what these youngsters need in Hollywood and they just they don't have no channel who understand. Therefore they dress themselves the way &gt;&gt; you remember that brother Brandham said he called these people Ricky's and Ricetta and God corrected him. He said you should not call him that this because many of them are still my children. &gt;&gt; We're not. You understand? I'm We can speak against outside things and preach against it. But find the heart of a person. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So I'm I'm I'm I'm going through everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. To because I want to respect the time. Can you say amen so far &gt;&gt; for do do you love the Lord Jesus? &gt;&gt; Amen. And that was a real amen. That was a real Amen. Preach it, man. Don't teach it. Okay. Right. That makes even a German dance. Okay. We are not big dancers. Shouldn't. But let me see how it is. Look, God, if you don't have a father, maybe your earthly father was not the father that he should be. But don't forget, you have a heavenly father. &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? How beautiful the Bible is, how beautiful the message is. I mean here is the prodigal son and and I mean he he he spent all his money in in in what it was okay we are mixed audience you understand what I want to say &gt;&gt; all kinds of immoralities and whatever he is now finished and then the Bible said this and the prodigal son came to himself &gt;&gt; there was no deacon said now boy it's time to serve the lord And we have to God calls the boy back. &gt;&gt; Woo. Tell me that is a miracle. When a person comes to himself, &gt;&gt; you cannot force it. You cannot hinder it. That is between God and his child. &gt;&gt; And look how beautiful. Beautiful. What was the first revelation of that boy? I have a father &gt;&gt; and my father is a wealthy man, is a fine man. He loves me. His first revelation was not, oh, we have brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; Amen. His first revelation said, I have a father &gt;&gt; and my father is my king and my father is my savior and my father is my bridegroom and my father is my friend and my father is my servant and he is my king at the same time. Nothing can separate me from the relationship with my father. &gt;&gt; No sickness, no nothing because can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; And you see, look, third point, I'm hearing really stupid and I see the time and I told you last time said, "Brother Brandon, there is a new ministry." I spoke with some of the brethren today. I was telling them about what's happened. Just remember that the first time I was here, you remember the Lord had told me something was going to happen. Change in the m ministry. It happened. Said another one is going to happen and it happened. Now there is another one greater far greater than all the rest of them put together already confirmed and ready. I hope it happens tonight. I just might say this. I don't have time to explain it to you but the brethren who does know about it's wonderful. It be such a great thing for the people and I'm grateful to God that the hour is soon at hand when God is going to help his children. Third pull, especially it will be for those who can't master the faith to raise up and get a hold of God like they should do. I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them also. &gt;&gt; Some run into Yeah, that is wow. We we are both in the same denomination definitely. Though some runs into faith that they just can reach over and receive anything. Why? That's great faith. Some of them has mustard seed face and has to wait so long to get through. I believe the Lord is making a way for those people now. &gt;&gt; God a father. &gt;&gt; And the weaker the child is, the more the father cares. Brother, the coming of Revelation 10, the mighty angel Christ himself is God came down &gt;&gt; to take us home. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God is not waiting in heaven. And I know I'm repeating myself. Now, now there is a boy who who wanted to buy a dog one time and he sees the owner of the dog comes and the boy says, "I want to have this dog." And the owner says, "Why do you want to have this dog? I mean, it's just handicapped. He cannot walk like the rest. it's just uh has no value. And the boy, he puts off his trousers and from his knee down, he has an artificial leg. And he says, "I want to have this dog because when we go out, I understand him and he understands me." &gt;&gt; Quote, "Brother Brandham, God became man to understand man." &gt;&gt; Quote, Brother Brandham. God became teenager to understand the teenager. &gt;&gt; So when you pray, God knows what you talk about. [Applause] Brother, that's our father, that's our God, it matters to serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother, if you see that love that God has for his children, you cannot leave the message. There's no way. &gt;&gt; There's no way. You say, "Where should I go?" &gt;&gt; When there's people together, there's always tension. I realize this. That's normal. It's humanity. &gt;&gt; But we have to say, Lord, where should we go? This message has words of eternal life. &gt;&gt; Here we hear things. Here we hear things that no denomination can preach &gt;&gt; because in the days of the voice of the seventh age, the mystery of God shall be revealed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Look, really last one. I had quite some more, but but that's fine. Look. Amen. The prophet Elijah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, Amen. Amen. He said, "And if the musicians would come up, okay, then then I know my time is up and I'm 50 minutes over, but uh I would imagine on every limp," he said. All around through the place was swarms of angels. And God came down and he said, "My poor little tired servant. He's so nervous and tore up. He don't know what to do. I want to pick out the angels standing there that's got the softest hands. Don't you scare him. Walk over, stroke his bro. Right. Easy. And I want the best cook among you." And got up there and get all the vitamins that you can find and put it in this cornmeal. The world's turned him down, but I'm going to treat him right. Hallelujah. That means praise be to our God. Don't be scared of it, said brother Ram. Bring the best that we got. Cook him a corn cake and set him down some water. And this soft-handed angel went over and stroked the little servant of God on the bone. Remember? And we don't believe in tattoos, okay? But if you want to make a tattoo, then make that slogan to be a tattoo. Okay? At least write it on your heart. &gt;&gt; Remember, if you have done your best, &gt;&gt; God still got those angel in order. He loves you just the same as he loved Elijah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians would come. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have a baby have the song I have a father. Do you know that chorus? Remember that, brother Bram says when Elijah when Elijah was on that under that juniper tree the day before he was killing 400 priests of Baal. &gt;&gt; Then he got an email from Jezebel. &gt;&gt; And look how God so much understanding us. God not being nervous. Amen. Brother Brham said it was the same God, the same doctrine, the same Elijah, but he doesn't dramatize the situation. Brother Brham said the anointing left the prophet, not more and not less. So if the anointing leaves you and you have your anxiety, remember that you are still the same son of God &gt;&gt; that you are &gt;&gt; in good days. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and when Elijah was there and he wanted to die, God didn't send a social worker. &gt;&gt; God came down himself. &gt;&gt; If you are on the path of your duty, God will send the same angel to you. &gt;&gt; Lift you up a little bit. &gt;&gt; Tie this. And and and that angel had something to eat. Amen. Some vitamins. And brother Brham said, "I wanted to know what kind of vitamins were in those cookies because Elijah was running for 40 days in volume." The message that we believe is Red Bull because tie that story to Revelation chapter 10 when a mighty angel comes down and he gives a bride something to eat and she eats from the body word of the body of Christ and runs with it to the millennium and the great things hereafter. This message is substance, brother. this message substance. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I mean, God so much cared. So when we are down, &gt;&gt; God is obligated as a father. &gt;&gt; He said my faithful my my my my my son was so faithful. I now I have to do something for him. Do you have the nice song? I have a father. Do you know the chorus? Isn't that beautiful? Is that our doctrine for this evening? &gt;&gt; Let me finish reading by this. All is fine, but you can play softly. Okay, if that is good. We were we were evangelists, young evangelists before and for us alter call was always crushing the people. I mean we were young. We were Yeah. But God has a lovely way to break us. A lovely way. And brother Bland speaks about the uh conversion of Gabe. Gabe was just a man who doesn't want to come to church. and his wife went to church and and always they prayed for that man Gabe. And one time he said he said, "Brother Ram said, Gabe went with the pastor. They went just hunting and the pastor looked back and Gabe was just standing there." And the pastor said, "Gabe, what's wrong with you?" And Gabe said, "Pastor, the sun is setting down and I realize the sun in my life is setting down, too. Amen. And then he said, "Dear this, do you see? You know, I'm not a of a good hunter. You know that I'm not getting anything." But God knew we need the thing that we were we need all these and these dead animals to eat and whatever. You see, I realize I have a father. I say in my own words, who gave me these things. He said, "Pastor, from now on, I want to serve that God, that father who cares so much for me, &gt;&gt; brother, this message is not pressure. Not at all. This message is a love affair. &gt;&gt; The great man in this generation is not William Brandham." &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to tell my daughter, our all our children. Hey, amen. It matters to serve the Lord. You want to find somebody who loves you. Really, the Lord Jesus really loves you. Really loves you. A friend in life when everything went wrong. Have you ever had that thing especially on a Wednesday evening and you didn't feel well and you have some hard stomach pains and some uh head headaches and you have bad thoughts and then you hear a voice don't come this evening better stay home have you ever heard that voice &gt;&gt; in other words it speaks German and English German and because I hear it in German but I tell you one thing you don't become become more spiritual by staying home. &gt;&gt; When everything goes wrong, come in the house of your father. Say, "Heavenly Father, here I am. &gt;&gt; I'm wrong as I can be, but I need you. I need a friend. I don't need a doctrine. I need now a friend who helps me." &gt;&gt; If the devil tells you to stay home, you tell the devil, "You stay home. You stay home." &gt;&gt; Honest. And the more mistakes we make, the more we see how our father brings us through. And that brings a bonding that nobody can separate. Nothing will separate us from the love of God. Nothing. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; A great shalom. I have a father. And that's what's what's all about. &gt;&gt; His name. Oh, I have family. [Music] He calls me his own. [Music] &gt;&gt; He'll never leave me. No matter where I go. [Music] &gt;&gt; He knows my name. [Music] He knows my every thought. [Music] &gt;&gt; He sees each tear that falls. He hears me well.

Don't me even be asking. &gt;&gt; My life was in his hand. &gt;&gt; My life in your hands was in his hand. &gt;&gt; Brother knows my name. &gt;&gt; Yes. For he knows my every thought.

So he's my God. &gt;&gt; I want to sing that last verse and you know you think about that as the eagle came by. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham don't tell us how many times it circled. &gt;&gt; But no matter what was going on in the little eagle Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It couldn't change from not being an eagle. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But he was going to stay right there until it got &gt;&gt; what it needed to get. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It might have been part five, part 10, part 50, part &gt;&gt; He was going to stay right there. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because God's got confidence to break back all of that that darkness that's around us trying to discourage us. &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it like this and it's the rising of the sun. And he said, "What was different in that moment is that little eagle had always been taught to look down. &gt;&gt; And for the first time in his life, &gt;&gt; he was taught to look up." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We We can never We look down. What's looking down? Looking at ourselves. &gt;&gt; We We can never be We can never be anything looking at ourselves. &gt;&gt; But it's looking at him. &gt;&gt; It's looking at him. He's the one that's waved over us. He's the one that we're pointed to. It's the Lord Jesus. That's what that's what this message is. It's the revealing &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus &gt;&gt; where the way was blocked up and man had made it creeds and made it isms made it doing and made it all about what you could do. But God revealed himself in sovereign grace in this hour that I am your way. &gt;&gt; The target the target never moved. &gt;&gt; Man tried to move it but it never moved. &gt;&gt; He's remained the same. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful that the veils have been taken away? &gt;&gt; That you can see him for who he really is and to know what his desire is &gt;&gt; for your life. &gt;&gt; He wants to He wants to He wants to be everything, all things to you. &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just look up to him. I didn't know how to fly and I didn't know what to say.

I think brother Brandham after he spoke marriage and divorce and &gt;&gt; it's not just a relief, &gt;&gt; but he's seen God's grace come down in that meeting &gt;&gt; where people had their suitcases packed and ready to &gt;&gt; go their separate ways. &gt;&gt; You remember hearing Brother Bram's voice and he calls out, I believe it's brother Robersonson, and his voice just breaks and he says, "It's over now, Roy." &gt;&gt; I believe that's the one he called out. You just you you sense not only the relief, but it wasn't just about relief. &gt;&gt; It was God's grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. For the father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing to me to be able to see the expression of God's grace. &gt;&gt; There's nothing like that. And then he sings before preaching. &gt;&gt; And I don't want to say preaching, but declaring who is this &gt;&gt; Mazdc? &gt;&gt; And he sings a song, he carth for you. Friends, I don't believe those things were coincidence. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Just like at the end of the message, the one of the last messages of leadership, he sings the song at the very end, God be with you till we meet again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we sing that together tonight? &gt;&gt; He carth for you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad he cares. &gt;&gt; And you know what? Not only does he care, but the prophet said he died and made a way that you might care. &gt;&gt; We couldn't even have a care. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; If he didn't make a way that we could have a care. &gt;&gt; Oh, all you can see is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's all you see is the love of God on display. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; Let's sing it together. He careth for you. [Music] Oh, he carth for you through sunshine or sun and I carth for you one more time. Oh, he carth for you.
