think brother Lang's had his shots and so we're good to go it's good to be a Christian isn't it it's good to be in the house of the Lord it's good to serve the Lord and I'm glad like that Psalm says that he truly is he's unshakable he's Unstoppable and what's just so awesome about all that that really brings that to light is he's unchangeable whatever he did once is a prophecy for who he is and what he will continue to do and what a comfort that is to our lives even as we come together and we assemble together here this morning we come and we we receive strength from the presence of the Lord you know it's just like you know you have a garden hose and you're trying to get water out to a certain location you know you got to make sure there's no kinks in that hose my wife this past year she wanted me finally after all these years I put in a box garden for her but we had to step and I got to get that water out there you know so you always got to worry about kinks in the holes and I believe God has called each and every one of us to be a real Channel a conduit that the Holy Ghost can just work through and flow through you know sometimes in the service how God will work in such a peculiar way is God will move right through even as your praise and your worship and you entering right in and just just drawing strength from El Shaddai it'll move right to the very need not only in your life but the lives of others I told you different times there's times where I've been in situations and maybe it felt a little tight so for me as a minister and knowing some of that I'd kind of position myself in that audience and I just start pulling on the gift of God the way I've always looked at it in this way right here sometimes I said you know if I'm sitting back there and I just start pulling on the gift of God I look at like a great canopy that just starts getting pulled over you know why there's nothing I love more than to see God's people help see God's people blessed and strengthened amen There's No Greater Joy because he's the joy of Our Lives where would we be without God where would we be without his Mercy without his grace amen what a privilege it is to serve the Lord brother Wayne is here with us I'm not sure why I think he just loves me a whole lot and that's why he came by this morning he just said I for the family I love you and I've got to be there I believe he does but I know there's other things amen and we we thank God for his Blessing amen how God is blessed brother Brian and sister Mariah and you know this scriptures I I just thought of this this scripture in the Book of Psalms here just um you know a week or a couple weeks ago and little Amelia arrived and I thought of that scripture of how low children are in Heritage of the Lord amen and the fruit of the womb is his reward what a blessing children are that God has entrusted to us the lines and how God has blessed the home bless the marriage amen and what a what a privilege it is you know it's just something that is there within you you know as parents um it just it draws something out of you that God placed there already and even in the times that lay before you you could become perplexed trying to think oh if I do I have the answer for this do I have the answer for that but you know it's it's already built in and God just directs that everything is every situation arises and God's God even helps around people that's already been through that it just God knows he's got all that Comfort put in place that's the same way it is spiritually in our lives when we've been born again of the spirit of God well we don't know all the every step along the way but he's right there it's it's already built within us amen and God's got wisdom and helps along the way and I also thought of this scripture here I love this scripture a lot it speaks of how in Mark chapter 10 if I could just read that scripture in verse 13 the Bible says they brought young children to him to the Lord Jesus and there's no greater place to take our children to that's right amen and that's what this message has done for us it has brought Jesus Christ present and personal in our lives no greater no greater person that we can bring our children to than the Lord Jesus Christ for what purpose that he should touch them and his disciples where they rebuked him but Jesus saw it he was much displeased and he said suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for such is the kingdom of God and whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took him up in his arms and he put his hands upon him and he blessed him I believe we know and we we think about when we come through this we don't we know we don't believe in infant baptism because it's not scriptural but we believe in following the scriptures and bringing to the Lord Jesus bring in our children and we dedicate them and you know what that dedication is it's recognized God you've entrusted this life to us so with everything Lord as my life is dedicated to you I want to dedicate their lives to you and everything that we do because the world is dedicating themselves to knowledge and everything else they're dedicating to it and oh there's there's an effect there's a reality when we dedicate Our Lives to the Lord dedicate our children in every in every situation and praying and trusting the Lord there's a reality that he would touch them amen and as we I just want to invite brother Brian and Mr Mariah they've played that song Ben could you play that song maybe bring them in or did you have one did you have a song you wanted to play or something bring them in it's okay I know the grandparents wanted to come amen come on sister Barb you won't think brother Brian will hold you and you you just keep your eyes on that baby you know oh man boy I'll tell you come on sister Chrissa come on [Music] amen I tell you she's beautiful [Music] I could say this like my you know like brother Graham said he said yeah he said my my wife always enemies me well I'll tell you what my wife does Envy me on this right here [Music] our heavenly father Lord how we thank you for this moment Lord God thank you for this life Lord predestinated from the hand of God We Believe Lord that our lives were pre-planned oh God father every step in every Junction of time the Lord God I always think of that scripture Lord as Israel would bless Ephraim Manasseh he would speak Lord that the angel that redeemed me redeemed them also and Lord we ask o God for little a million Lord as we dedicate her life Lord God back to your hands that God made the angel of the lord always the Lord watching over her Lord and guiding and directing her footsteps the Lord and I pray God that Lord that you'll just Lord guide and directing brother Brian and sister Mariah Lord knowing that God that Lord you entrusted Lord and you're the same God that Lord leads Lord in every attribute you've placed in our life God you lead those attributes into Divine expression Lord now father I ask oh God that your hand would be upon Lord little Amelia Lord and God bringing in her to that moment Lord to where that God that Lord our heart always remaining tendered Lord to where Lord she would come to know you personally Lord the god that has brought her Lord here upon this earth oh God and the plan that you have for her life Lord father we give her the Lord into your hands Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I'll hold her real quick before you preach it's the first time to hear from Paul preach well don't cry now foreign [Music] brother Abner sister Alani God bless you good to have you [Applause] Hallelujah you're going to sing something Amen brother Wayne

home you're at home and we just we love the Lord Jesus we love the message of the hour what God has brought to us has given us life he's everything to us and this message never it just well it made me love my Bible even more I love my Bible it's God opening and stepping out of the pages of the word so let's just let's reach out let's pull on the gift of God this morning I believe God has something for us don't you we've not come just here just to watch but God's got something for us he wants to speak to our hearts this morning man let's just draw upon El Shady eye amen as we just maybe want to change our position if you wouldn't mind standing with us brother Brian would lead us in a course as brother Wayne would come [Music] from the moment that I wake up until I lay my head of the goodness

darkness now you are close like no other I've known you as a father I've known you as a friend in the goodness of God foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] God [Music] your goodness is running after it's

uh for the Lawson family for the Hannah family and then we're we're sharing grandchildren now Brian so you're joined to us from now on amen and we appreciate the grace of God I'm just noticed in there and a little Amelia both grandparents parents amen serving the lord under this revelation of this age and amen what a what a what a tremendous time that you know when your daughter when she young and she's growing you know the fathers understand this you're watching and and you know that someday your headship's going to transfer and you're praying that the great Creator the leader of Our Lives you put the right boy you know you know because at some point you're just going to take your daughter put her in the hands of a man and then he's going to lead her and then how he leads her and so when you see God preparing and he gave us a blessing with Brian and his love for the Lord and love for this message to see him leading home under the Revelation and bringing up children I tell you it touches the heart to see what God has done for all the men who have walked away from the responsibilities God has a God has one that will stand faithful for every boy for every man that's walked away from his duties as a father or as a husband there's a man somewhere that God can put his hands on and that man will hold that responsibility to show the character of God in his fatherhood and his life and and I thank God for that I I thank God for men who stand for this word and stand for this message with her hearts and we've lived long enough to know there's trying times and there's Temptations and there's so there's crucifying of the Flesh and we thank God for his Mercy this morning we want to thank the Lord for a little Amelia amen she's a real work of Grace amen she's a she's a real blessing and you know it pat Paul's Hearts you know awesome hey man I'm I'm so thankful to the Lord for the blessing of this in our homes and I just wonder this morning if we could bow our hearts in a word of prayer and we thank God for this but this morning just to turn to our lord Jesus for a moment in his word maybe there'll be something here this morning on your heart there's a need there's something in your life that you would like to just touch the Lord this morning and say Lord remember me gracious father as we bow our heart this morning my heart is full with Thanksgiving Lord I have no reason but all purpose in my heart is to worship and praise you and love you and thank you for the goodness Lord just as a young man I never dreamed that a man could live a life like this but Lord you stepped into my life and changed it all you changed the direction of it you changed my heart you changed my desires and you gave us wonderful family you gave us life you gave us Resurrection and then you just continually add blessing upon blessing and Lord we thank you this morning we don't want to date we don't want this day to pass without it ringing across Heaven that I'm thankful I praise your name this morning thank you for the grace that's in our lives and the blessing and father we thank you for these men of God for our brother Samuel for his pastoral duties here Lord is holding that responsibility teaching these young men the ways of life we thank you for him Lord he said he's a treasured gift and we thank you for the blessing Lord this morning now Lord we're asking you the one that created a brother like Samuel a man like Brian or a prophet or age a time I pray that that Creator come in this building this morning Lord may you do a work in this church and lies Lord if there's one that don't know you God may they meet the creator of Heaven and Earth the one that can make everything different I pray Lord Jesus that your mercy would just swirl across this meeting today if there's a young lady or a need here in this building God made you touch that need I'm asking you for Mercy today Lord as we Endeavor to speak your word now in Jesus name a man an amen God bless you this morning I will invite you to the scripture Amen in Philippians chapter 3 y'all had to forgive me for being a big old baby I uh Lord still moves my heart I just I just it just it just the grace of God that has been given to our lives Philippians chapter 3 uh Philippians 3 and verse 20. for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body and I always like when I read this to stop and say who shall change our vow body it doesn't say what it says who so the change is a as a person who shall change the Lord Jesus who shall change our vowed body it may be fashioned like it unto his own glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself I want to read one more scripture and I'll just read it for you first Corinthians 15 51. behold I'll show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed may God bless you as you be seated today I wanted maybe just to approach something for a few moments this morning on the mystery of our change and just want to maybe speak to you I've just been in a a Bible Conference on the Rapture and these things are really on my heart and so I just want to maybe speak a couple things to you today and pray the Lord would help us I know these are troubling times that we're looking at and I know the world and the season and the day we're living I know there's trouble everywhere I know that there is uh fear there's there's threats of nuclear weapons there's there's just so much happening in the church in the world that we're living in and uh and in these times questions come up there's a there's questions that come to the heart of the people and I believe that before there's a question there's got to be an answer and if it's a Bible question there's a Bible answer now there couldn't be a question if there wasn't an answer and so I I think of a prophet of how that he would say and do things I I'm a Hunter a bit myself I I do some raccoon hunting I when I was a kid down the bottoms there in Arkansas along the Black River we we did a lot of that and early in our lives and I wasn't very successful but I really like to do it but one thing that I learned is that whenever you're you're in flat country there's not a lot of landmarks it's not like the mountains you're viewing there where you know I can stand here and I believe that looks just like Lake Mary in Calgary uh just above Calgary they're in Banff I think it is it looks just like it because I've seen those landmarks and if it's not it's very very much like it uh but when you start seeing landmarks um you're able to see things and you're able to to get a direction from those mountains or whatever but when you flat ground I grew up in flat ground along flat bottoms of a river and if the if the fog would settle down and use out there and you talked about three times around the bush or something you take off walking and you think for sure you're headed north and you'll be headed east or south or west or it's so easy to get turned around because of of the fog and brother Brown teaches an entire uh a sermon on this when he talks about how the spirit of truth remember he tells about how he got lost when he was he was hunting he went over a mountain and he was right up there in the Adirondacks actually in the mountains and here just north of us and he got to chasing after a bear and then he shot a deer and he said it got foggy and he said the confusion came he said I took off and thought well I was going to just walk this way he said in a minute here I was back that deer again he said I did that about three times he said finally I said well I'm just going to turn and walk this direction and and so when he did he said well I was going to just take off he said then a hand laid on my shoulder and he said when the hand laid on my shoulder he said I'm the uh I'm ever present help in time of trouble and he said when that hand laid on me he said all of a sudden he turned me and I looked and he said there was a there was a big a hole in the fog he said which let me see Hurricane Mountain which I knew he said I knew Hurricane Mountain and if I could ever see something I knew then I'd know the direction of what to go and remember what he said he said I was actually turning he said I was going the wrong direction 180 degrees the wrong direction he said but when he laid his hand on me the hole opened now I'm a guy that thinks about things like this but when I was a kid listening to the tapes all we was thinking you know a hole like a hole in a napkin or a hole in the paper that was a six mile Hole uh it it it it it and to a preacher and I think that's Church ages isn't it he looked through a big hole and he looked back and saw that Hurricane Mountain which which which gave him uh an Orient he was able to Orient himself and say wait a minute I'm headed this way and I need to be headed this way and it was because of that landmark and I realized that in the season that we're living in that we have a lot of people traveling with us and we walk along and we're fellowshipping with people and it's a little bit like having Hunting Buddies you know you're walking along and somebody says well the truck's this way and somebody else says well the truck's this way and after a little while you're going which way is the truck you know and and it's a little bit that way among the churches you know sometimes someone maybe they say this is happening or they look at it this direction but we we've got to remember that we have a message and uh in the middle of uh you know just as a church y'all we're all Christians and I hate to say this but not everybody listens to the message all the time sometimes they listen to different Ministries and sometimes people are listening to CNN and some are listening to the Fox News and some are watching conspiracy theories and they there's a lot of ideas out there amen there's a lot of confusion and and it matters who you're listening to of what you think's about to happen but when you start looking at this uh there's questions that is ask brother Branham and I think it's powerful to go back to a prophet and see what he had to say in 1964 brother random has asked the question will the bride go through the persecution as the Apostolic Church did so as a bride as a church are we looking for a persecution is that what we're about to face that's what he's asking and he's not talking about the tribulation like uh that is coming but he's actually talking about persecution and as the early Apostolic church so in other words are we looking for some kind of a of a problem to come into the church to perfect us or are we looking for this kind of persecution that's going to make us get more serious and this is that what we're looking for and brother bam says no I just explained a few minutes ago the next thing we look for is a Rapture now we're at a Promised Land we're at a border you understand the march of Israel now this is my own thoughts ministering Brethren but in my own way I feel the Holy Spirit has revealed this to me the next thing that's to happen to the Gentile elected bride is to be caught up with the rest of the Gentile elected bride that's been down through of course the ages now brother random he's telling us the next thing now there's a reason they're asking him this because if you're a study of the message earlier in the messages brother Bynum is actually making it sound like there's a persecution coming to the church and we're going to go through some pretty uh big pre-tribulation things that's going to prepare us and he's saying that but he's saying that before the message of feast of the Trump into 1964 which I know you're taught these things but I need to get this to go and uh you see what happens is is brother random is looking to preach the Feast of the trumpets in 1964 and he comes along in that sermon and he said now I was going to preach to you the trumpets he said but the angel of the Lord revealed to me that I already preached the trumpet spiritually in the Seven Seals he said so what we're looking for now is we're not looking for the trumpets we're looking for the change of our body because what the trumpets are to Israel the seals are to the bride so whatever you think the trumpets are going to do to Israel the seals does that to the Bride of Jesus Christ so when he opens up the word what he's doing is he's doing to you what the trumpets do to Israel when they go to their homelands of course amen then National Force will put Israel in its Homeland but the power of God will put the bride in the Rapture now we got to expect something and you say what do we expect affecting brother bam said see he's done or give the church everything he did to Abraham there's except one thing and that's the change of the body so what the church ought to be expecting in this season is the change of the body he said by the way what are you expecting I am expecting a body change I am expecting a Rapture what am I expecting I am not expecting someone to capture us and to persecute us for the next while to get us ready I'm expecting any moment to look up and dead loved ones come walking down the aisles I'm looking for the opening of the door of mortal to immortality I'm looking for something to just sweep over the Bride of Jesus Christ and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye we will step from one dimension to another that's my expectation that's what I'm living for that's what I'm looking for is the changing of our body now the prophet of God said of course after the sign was given unto Abraham the next thing that happened to Abraham was the change of his body y'all know Abraham had a body change amen and so is the bride going to have a body change what happened to Abraham right before the change of his body Melchizedek or Elohim came down and human flesh and showed a sign and then his body was changed what have we had in the message of the hour we've had allowed him to come and to take a mortal man amen and to show us the last sign now I know people got on the blood moons and they get on the signs and they look at all these signs but Jesus said there'll be no sign given except for the sign of the son of man or resurrection and we have received our last sign Church of the Living God we're not looking for a sign this morning we're not looking for the blood to show up in the moon we're not looking for somebody to do something we have already had the thing that God said the church would have before the change of our body the next thing to happen in the church is the changing of our body that's exactly what we're looking looking forward there is nothing to hinder the change of our body outside of the Readiness of this church amen there's nothing amen amen there's no scripture in here this morning prevents the body change there's no scripture that has to be fulfilled to prevent the church from moving in it was the Readiness of the church brother Madam says every Vision has been fulfilled or is in the process of doing so right now I think we ought to look at it this morning and ask us where are we in this ibrahimic age we are in the season of change we are in the time of change this is the time right now that the church must get off of the scene because God is turning to the Jews God cannot God cannot reveal himself unto the Jew until the bride is out of the way it is time for the church to get off of the scene you can see it if you if you if you look in the news you can see it you can see it's the time uh you know I I was sitting here I was talking to some brethren the other day and I I said you know we're in our age group amen we we lived in the time period when I was a kid I heard the old Pastor preach amen uh Russia is going to bomb us and I think that's all he knew at that time it's what he he definitely had our attention as a kid I remember that amen I didn't remember much else but I remember Russia is going to get us you know well it didn't as a kid I remember when I think it was during Ronald Reagan when they took down the Berlin wall and things and they changed the Russia to USSR and I thought well that's odd because it don't even call it Russian then all of a sudden here we go back and you come under this uh Putin fella and all of a sudden Russia's Russia again and it's not just Russia it's Russia with aggression right all right now you I want I want to just take a moment and say this to you they don't have to develop an atom bomb to destroy us this morning that was developed years ago even in Russia at this moment they got the great Satan you know and it's designed to destroy now that that bomb is sitting there this morning they don't have to make it they don't have to program it they do not have to come up with missile engineering it is literally setting ready to go and they told us just a few months ago how long it would take them to destroy all of Europe you know they actually put minutes on France and London and the major cities and and Russia is literally talking about fulfilling Bible prophecy by making the concrete melt beneath us and they kept telling the Americans you can't hide in your homes for the scripture says that concrete's going to melt and great fire is going to fall from Heaven and they believe they're fulfilling scripture and they are because the prophet of God said listen thus saith the Lord Russia will destroy destroy the Vatican with a bomb amen amen we're living in a season amen when uh when a city can be destroyed in an hour and a nation could be born in a day things happen quick in this time you think it ain't gonna happen and all of a sudden it's right on top of you it's happening right there amen if you're watching the news you know what I'm talking about amen the the scientists are telling us we're closer to midnight right now than we were ever in the history they're saying we are we are in a greater threat of nuclear war than we were in 1960s under the missile crisis of Cuba we're look it's like somebody pushed a pause button in the 1960s and all of a sudden they've let off the pause button and things are right back where they are when the prophet of God was upon the scene Amen in the political world things have been set back that in a moment things could totally fall apart in this entire nation you said brother Wayne what are you trying to say I'm trying to say brother Brandon said if I wasn't a Christian I'd go crazy thinking this might happen at any time with a house full of little kitties and everything else I wouldn't know what to do but I'm glad that I can stand in my house and introduce them to the greatest bomb shelter that that bombs or nothing else could ever touch them under the protecting wings of the Lord Jesus Christ not by might or not by power but by my spirit that is our protection if you want a protection get the power of the Holy Ghost in your home you wanted protection get the power of the Holy Ghost in your church the only way you can protect your family is get them under the token of the blood of Jesus Christ there is no bomb shelter can keep you out of this war that's coming there is nothing you can do to prepare for this that is coming there is only one thing for you to do is don't be scared of the hydrogen bombs as long as you got Christ in your heart that's the best bombshell I know of it's made out of feathers for under his wings shall we abide amen so you don't have to worry about that if you're a Christian and listen if you're a Christian this morning you don't have to worry about bonds if you're a Christian you don't have to worry about tribulation if you're a Christian you don't have to protect yourself The Protector almighty God has been invited into your home to protect can Shield you Amen in this time in place now brother I know I know William Branham was a judgment Prophet we all know brother Brown spoke judgment over this nation amen but you got to catch your spirit brother Brandon would never preach judgment without preaching Mercy now I know I know you probably have caught this but his Spirit on judgment it just it just blesses me to hear a prophet's Spirit about this because I was reading one day and I was I was actually reading about all this judgment that was coming and I was reading about it and I was studying some things brother random said and he's in in a message you can you can look it up it's a message I stay at the door or not mother Madam actually talks about that he wants to preach a message on the handwriting on the wall and he wants to preach it but he only had one service to do it so he wouldn't preach the handwriting on the wall instead he preached a different sermon he said because listen I wouldn't want to leave the people in that condition without bringing a message to follow it to give hopes to the church he said then at least the people wondering and makes them nervous so brother Brandon wouldn't preach the handwriting on the wall without preaching the next service amen the church rapturing before tribulation so he wouldn't even preach the Judgment sermon without preaching the Rapture sermon in the evening and I think of the grace of God Amen that pointed out the Judgment Upon This Nation but at the same time he gave the church Grace by telling them about a Rapture with every Temptation there is a way of Escape God always makes a way of escape and the Rapture of the church see before it can take place before it can take place the Rapture comes and takes the church Church home listen brother man said this Russia of course is going to bomb amen before the first bomb ever strikes he said we'll be sitting in the wedding supper Amen in other words you you may not know this but in 1962 brother Brown said the issue came for Russia to bomb us back then he said and and one of the American generals were told to push the button to to launch some nuclear strike against Russia he said something checked him and he wouldn't do it brother man said I talked to the man personally he said minutes later he said the call came and said I'm glad you didn't do it it was a blip on the screen and brother Brandon said why didn't that General fire them missiles he said because somebody was left on the earth that was needing Redemption listen friend I believe there'll come a day the last seed's going to be in I believe the last seed will be upon the Earth and then this thing's going to go that was what we were waiting on we weren't waiting on persecution we were waiting on the last seed now I believe you are to comfort one another with these words and the prophet said that sometimes you can only get Comfort out of the word of God and they ask him will the family go in the Rapture if the Rapture comes you don't have children you don't understand this these bombers with these little babies and these young people they understand this if a Rapture would happen what happens to my baby brother Adam said if the Rapture takes place for the believer's family wife and children go he said yes if they're in faith and they trust the Lord you don't have to leave them babies behind amen think about it this morning I'm preaching Rapture and got a grandbaby back there but listen if God has got her name in the Lamb's Book of Life and I believe it is I don't believe God give me any serpent seed amen I believe her name's in the Lamb's Book of Life I have to believe that from my heart that if a Rapture would take place amen you know what's going to happen brother West God's going to take old people and make them young again and he's going to take young people and he's going to bring them to the 20 year old Mark the same God that can change an old man can change a young child and put it at the same age we have got a God who can bring immortality I've refused to live in fear I refuse unless the devil pray under a fear fear where I cannot worship God I'm not going to need a bomb shelter I'm already in the bomb shelter I've already got the protection of the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh I tell you it's a time to get into Christ God does nothing without a purpose we might as well preach it Heavenly the God I serve don't do anything without a purpose listen if God has got to have a purpose in doing things he has a purpose in the tribulation that's coming you all know the purpose don't you threefold brother man said Purge 144 000. Purge a foolish version Purge the Earth that's the threefold purpose of The Sixth Seal sometimes you study something and it's not what you find in it it's what you don't find in it that's where the blessing is when you study The Sixth Seal if you take time go through it one thing you'll never find in The Sixth Seal is the bride The Sixth Seal does not include the Bride of Jesus Christ she is not there matter of fact the tribulation cannot even begin until the bride leaves the bride is not in Tribulation there is no reason for her to be in Tribulation because she has been purged under the seventh seal which has purged her of all of her sins so there's no reason for her to go through a purging she has already been purged by the blood of Jesus Christ listen we're sitting here this morning I believe it ought to be settled in every believer's heart that that she never takes a tribulation you can't put that bride in the tribulation the bride's gone that's right because she has not one sin against her at all that's how the prophet preaches she won't go in Tribulation because she got no sin to pay for amen what has happened to her sin the grace of God has covered her the bleach has tooken so far away from her that's not even a remembrance but the Purity and the perfect blessedness in the presence of almighty God I think we already get on my knees and cry out to God there's no reason to have a tribulation for this bride she's already spotless and sinless before her God listen brother they ain't nothing can make a man spotless outside of the blood of Jesus Christ but the power of the blood it has an ability to change the life to change your heart to move a life to completely cleanse the soul amen somebody said well by the way and I don't know anybody hey man the sinless let's read a prophet a church has been judged they've been judged themselves they've accepted the blood and how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person he said every born-again True Believer is perfectly absolutely sinless before God that's not out of an almanac that's a Vindicated Prophet that's looking at the heart of almighty God and he's judging the church from the heart of God he said there's no sin against her at all brother how can you ever take a man through the bleach of the blood of Christ between him and God it scatters sin so far up I don't know how to say it other than this that I uh you know have you ever had have you ever had an experience with bleach anybody ever had experiences with bleach as a young guy you know when I was a kid I worked I worked all summer long I was about 16 17 my dad didn't know a 40-hour week if he didn't know it at all you know what a 40-hour week was we worked we worked from can to can't we weren't construction you know if you could you worked if you couldn't you didn't that's all it was six days a week 80 90 hours in a week it was construction and we worked out and well you give a 17 year old a check but he's working 80 hours a week you know here I go down the Brass Buckle [Laughter] but I had them in that day and they were just as expensive in that day as they are now man I could burn up 250 or 300 on a pair of pants and nice shirt you know you had to look good you know I go home you know she's a lovely lady and she bleaches everything like a you know kitchen and the sinks and take that bleach rag and she put it over in the laundry basket and every once in a while I'd take a pair of them 150 blue jeans and I'd throw it in the laundry basket and the next day they come out of the dryer and I went mom you didn't have to tell me what happened in blue jeans I don't have to explain to me a minute what happened I knew the instant I know somebody had a rag but bleach in that in that laundromat she said how'd you know I said look at the spots there ain't nothing else to do that to a pair of jeans overnight it takes bleaks to do that now some people you know if you come to me and said brother Wayne I I just dip this suit and bleached last week and I said no no you didn't no you didn't how do you know because I have experienced bleach I haven't I know what it has the power to do and some people tell me they put their lives in the blood no no no no no no so what do you mean it's I've experienced the bleach of the blood I know the power of the blood I know what it can do for a life listen there is nothing like the power of the blood of Jesus Christ to change a man's heart to change a man's nature to change a man's life he said brother Wayne how do I get into the blood the blood is by the word and the spirit of God in this generation we're not have a tub of bleach up here we don't have a tub of blood up here we've got the word preached in inspiration and there's a spirit behind it and it cleanses the heart as a man receives the word he receives the spirit of God and it cleanses that life and brings the power of God into our hearts now of course this bride don't go to a tribulation there's no reason for her to go through tribulation because she don't go in it I'm sorry I study a lot but you know are you study the Book of Revelation study the fifth chapter you think there's a lot of good things in there but the powerful things what's not in there that's right the powerful things what's not in there there's no devil in the Book of Revelation 5. there's no accuser in Revelations 5. amen you see that there's no accuser there because the bleach of the blood is done away with the accuser in your life he said by the way I want to live without seeing you kind of get the baptism of the Holy Ghost upon your life and if it comes in amen then that life is settled under the blood now you've got to know who you are to know what applies to you and where you're going let me just let me just say this is the best way I know how to say it you gotta identify yourself because you know it's easy to identify yourself with someone else's scripture right you got to know who you are in scripture so that you get the scripture for your life you go to um you go to Apostle Peter he's a good example he's standing there with Jesus one day he said who do you say I am he said without the Christ the son of God he said that's right Simon he said flesh and blood is not revealed to this from this day on I'll call you Peter he changed from Simon to Peter and then in a minute the Lord's told him he was going to go to Calvary and be crucified in a minute he told him that Peter said not so Lord you ain't gonna go and Jesus said get behind me devil he got he got another name change now you can only imagine with that mentality sitting at the supper the last supper and he said somebody's going to portray me well it would have been a pretty short jump for Peter to think he's talking about him and he literally says is it me Lord but Peter could not take judas's place even if he didn't feel worthy even if he thought that was he couldn't take that place it didn't belong to him it belonged to Judas and you have no right to say or position yourself in the scripture that is God the Creator's right to position you in the word and he sends the message of the hour to position the bride so that you will know that's your place and that's your place and that's your place you got to know who you are in the scripture it's just like a if you if you if you read this here in the scripture you say well preacher what do you mean let me just put it like this in the scripture there is an Eleazar of course we're not the Elisha right that's a prophet but if there's an Eleazar then there's got to be a Rebecca if there's an elevation there's got to be a Rebecca so if you see that you are Rebecca in the scripture then you know how you're going to get into the Rapture or the meeting in the air you got to see how Rebecca got from the whale over to meet Isaac and the prophet of God said of course Rebecca was the one that showed up in the evening light remember when Elijah went out to the well and there Rebecca come out to him isn't it beautiful when you study that that when Elisha walks up to the well he don't Tell Rebecca everything that he prayed but he just before she comes up he prays and said Lord the woman that's a right woman when she comes up let me ask and she'll offer me a drink and then she will also water my camels amen now now elieza doesn't tell her what he prayed but when she responded to Elisha she said the very words that he had said in his prayer showing she had the Revelation to match the coming of Elisha how she responded to Elisha told us who she was now look at your response to this message I can identify you how you respond to the message of the hour now look at what she did when she saw this she said not only will I water you I water these camels and I don't have time to preach how much gallons it was but it was a lot amen and when she started watering those camels you know what the prophet of God said he said the camels is what brought Ellie easier and it was the same thing that was going to take Rebecca to meet Isaac whatever brought the prophet was going to take her to meet her Isaac and brother man said what brought the prophet was the power of the Holy Ghost and what's going to take the bride to meet her Isaac is the power of the Holy Ghost so as a Rebecca this morning we've got to water the power of the Holy Ghost listen amen if if the spirit of God starts falling flat in the church that's up to you hey man let's start watering that until the power of God moves with anointing listen we're not here this morning just to say oh I tell you the holy spirit's getting old and it's getting tired and we're just going to let it go no sir amen we're going to water the spirit of God we're going to praise the spirit of God until we refresh it in the midst of the church with the power and praise and because we are expecting this to take us to our Isaac and there's no other way to get there friends the Holy Ghost is the right the church will take by the power of God that Camel represents a power the power that brought her is the power that carries you into the presence of God Amen I tell you what's going to bring this church home it'll be the power of God it'll be the same thing that God uses when he changes your body it'll be the power of God when when Joseph took the wife of a gentile he only had that life with him until he wanted to give himself or reveal himself to his brethren in Israel and when he got ready to to reveal himself to Israel there had to come A change the bride had to be put in the palace you you are Joseph's wife in the story and you have got to move from the side of Joseph to the palace and there's only one way to get in the palace it's by the changing of the body everything in the scripture points that there's got to be a change he said preacher why are you saying this because if you know where you're going and you know what's about to happen you know how to prepare you know how to get ready listen we are not getting ready for tribulation we're not storing food to get us through the tribulation we are preparing for a Rapture and a paradox to come upon the Church of the Living God I'm looking for the change of our body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye we have entertained the presence of the one who can do the changing if you don't prepare how can you prepare if you don't know what's coming who are you you're the one who's going to change you are the people that's going to change before the resurrection of the tribulation could strike the Earth in Philippians 3 Paul actually says it he said our conversation from Heaven which we look for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our body that will be fashioned like it unto his own glorious body according to the working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself now I don't want to spend a long time here but I do want to draw this point who should change our vile body how many knows what that word vile actually stands for it means humiliation it's a powerful word Paul uses it and says a vile body in the Hebrew the word vile actually means humiliation a lower State brother random uses it in the junction of time as if he knew the Hebrew maybe he did maybe he didn't I don't know maybe he knew the Greek I don't know but he did say this Old Vile body of humiliation that we live in will be changed and be fashioned like an unto your own body and faith is the substance brother random said we're going to groaning we're veiled in this Tabernacle of humiliation and we have the earnest of our perfect and complete Redemption back like it was in the beginning when God created Adam in the Garden of Eden we have a foretaste of Glory Divine by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the refreshment coming from the presence of God to water the church to make it grow in his grace now someday brother Brown said someday this Mortal will take on immortality hey man who shall change it who will make us move from this humiliation that we're living in to a glorified body who could make that happen brother random actually says it he said someday we're going out of this tent this Dwelling Place this Tabernacle of humiliation we're going to be changed we're going to step into a land of Purity and when our feet first touches that blessed Land This Old Ship is iron we're going to rush out it's all going to be over sickness and cripples and afflictions and everything's going to be gone old age and death and sorrow all these natural things that's caused by the curse will be gone forever we will be changed we will return back we will be turned back isn't it beautiful Amen Brother by Adam tells us this that this Tabernacle who now you you if you listen to the sermons you can hear Brother random in a sermon entitled to whom shall I go it's a powerful sermon because remember when Peter's talking to the Lord and Peter has has heard the Lord sound sounds like a contradiction and the Lord said Peter you can go also if you'd like and he said Lord to whom should we go brother man preaches an entire sermon into whom shall we go and then in the middle of that sermon he said if you want translation who are you going to go to for it he said what doctor can prescribe you appeal to translate you from the Tabernacle of humiliation to glorification what what scientists could give you something that could take you from humiliation to glorification so he's saying who is it that you could go to that could give you this kind of change this is what we're looking for and there's only one that can change us that is our Lord Jesus Christ to whom we look for in the Ephesian Church age brother Adam tells us this he tells us of how that our lord Jesus can I just preach to you a moment here instead of Amen our lord Jesus now if you're if you're a believer in the Bible our Lord he is the Lord Of Glory he was the creator of heavens and earth he lived lived in a glorified condition our lord Jesus when he was upon the Earth said father glorify me with the glory I have with you before the world began so brother Madam tells the story of how the great king of Heaven laid aside his robes and came down to be more to man you remember the story he tells us how that he lays aside to come down so let me just say this the God of all glory came down to be humiliated in humanity showing us that glorified one that powerful king of all kings came down into a tabernacle of humiliation you could call it a pest house you could call it this wicked place this evil time this evil he and the Bible said and he took upon himself sin as a lot of people would like to think amen they would like to think of this God man in such a way that he was God and had no feelings and he didn't go through struggles and didn't go through problems but that's contrary to scriptures the scripture said that when Jesus came into the Earth he came lower than the angels he said preacher what does that mean it means an angel has never felt pain an angel has never felt Temptations in such as a human level he never felt that Humanity like that but our lord Jesus bypassed the Angelic situation and he came to be a Seed of Abraham and the Bible said that he may be able to be tempted in every like manner that we're tempted that he should secure our Temptations in other words he became us to feel our feelings to feel our Temptations to understand our needs to understand our desires and listen I believe Jesus was God but he took on himself Humanity that he might teach us that God can live in humiliation that God could live in a humiliated State he could oh I'll tell you he didn't just come to a certain point and say that's as far as I'm going with this he brought himself so long that he was a football's funky he had the worship name in town he was born and raised under lies and called illegitimate and a bastard-born child he was a reject from the Nations he was eject from the people he brought a humiliation upon himself and brother if that wasn't far enough he stood still and let them accuse him of making him something he wasn't they let they said you were accusing you that you call yourself God Amen you've made of yourself something you've lifted yourself up which is the worst thing amen that a man could do because of course that's a that's the act of Satan right to lift himself to the position of God they took the god of glory and calling the devil they took the God of all creation and called him Biel shabub because he was God living in the flesh as an example of the Church of the Living God but his children would also be God people and they would live in this Tabernacle of humiliation he went before us he came into this flesh and he lived in this Humanity with every Temptation I I tell you I don't want to get too graphic here but listen young men young women amen our Lord knew the desire and temptation of lust don't you don't you put him off there like he didn't know what you're going through he felt the Temptation he felt the burning in his flesh but he conquered it and overcame it because he had to be an example to another seed that is coming after him that would be like him and they would kill the pull they would feel the pull in the world they would feel the Temptations of this life he was tempted by cigarettes he was tempted by alcohol he was tempted by lust he could have had a family he was not that kind of God man his flesh was all flesh [Music] amen now you said preacher hey man you're getting a little far here the prophet of God said in the Garden of Gethsemane he said the spirit of God left him and he walked to Calvary as a man he didn't walk with the spirit of God holding him up in his time of desperation brother I'll tell you what he did he turned loose of the dove nature and as a lamb he was led to a Slaughter and he never opened his mouth hey man I I don't have time to preach this morning but I say this what a powerful God I serve what a powerful Lord Jesus Christ that he could take the accusations and never open his mouth he can let him say hey and oh my brother you talk about a mighty conqueror I I I'd love to just preach sometimes upon it but I'll tell you it wasn't it wasn't the piercing of his hands and the piercing of his side that made him a mighty conqueror what made him a mighty conquerors he faced the Flesh and he overcame it with power and manifestation listen he didn't do it as a God he done it as a human being just like you felt the feelings felt the pressures felt the problems amen I I have to sometimes I just sit down I get to thinking about it it's about more I can think it's about more than I can think about that my lovely Lord Jesus came into this flesh and wouldn't take up for himself but he gave himself for me and became me and the prophet of God said he seen the vision water from the rock 55 while he was preaching he said I seen Adam and Eve coming out of that garden and he said I seen God's swing a bloody lambskin around him he said now the vision has changed and I see Jesus walking up his heel I see blood spots getting to come out on his robe I hear the clicking of the Cross he was preaching a vision showing that the cowrish cross would be the way the bride would go back into Eden they came out under blood of skins but they would go back under the blood of Jesus Christ they came out in the shame but they'll go home and they glorified condition o Church of the Living God goes that morning when Adam and Eve had to leave the garden can you imagine the shame brother The Shame of the Angels The Shame of the world seeing what they've done seeing how they acted shame was upon them and they came out of there under shame they only covered their shame was God have mercy and put a skin around them now Adam became close he was a naked man and became clothed by a skin of God to tide his shame our lord Jesus was stripped of his clothes this is one of those areas that just the brother's name and tear my heart out our lovely Lord Jesus the king of all Kings was stripped naked before the people that the shame that you and I face would be placed upon him that he would literally bear our shame to the cross of Calvary that he would that he would go as an exposed human being nothing covering his flesh nothing covered he was he was a I don't know how to say it he was a nude man but he wasn't nude in the way of of a bodybuilder that would that would impress the whole world he was nude in a way that what drifted off of him was the blood of the mockery and the beatings of taking our accusations and not speaking up he took a beating for you and me he took a beaten in his back until every bit of his body had been crisscrossed with a cat of nine tails that the blood was shrieking down his back mockery spit was upon his face crowns of thorns was upon his head and they were mocking the lovely Lord Jesus as he walked down there pulling his own cross under the shame and the mockery of mankind but brother let me tell you something he didn't stop in the middle of the way he didn't get in part way and say hey never mind you know what he did he carried the cross all the way because he knew there was a church coming that wasn't going to stop halfway he knew there was a bride coming and wasn't going to stop halfway and we don't have to stop halfway he pulled that he pulled that cross brother Samuel the cross never gets old to me he pulled that he pulled that cross and he got there to where they they put him on the cross now here's the power of this church when he lifted his hands and they pierced his side the prophet tells us that the blood from his side ran down like this and the blood from his back ran together at the hip and when it run down his leg he said Divine Healing and salvation ran together and when it dropped upon the ground it was a complete Covenant your healing and your salvation was through the blood of Jesus Christ it's a preacher what are you talking about remember his hands are up well let's go back in the scripture to Moses when Moses his hands were lifted the people were in Victory when Moses his hands were down the people were in defeat brother Brown said God supplied two men to hold up Moses's hands so the people would see Victory he said but when Jesus Christ came the greater Moses he said God put him on the cross and nailed his hands up so they could never come down that whenever a man looks at Calvary all he can see is Victory all he can see is the blood all he can see is the grace of God I say lift up your head bride that's a victory in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah there's no sin against this bride he took my sin he took my shame you know you know what the prophet taught you all taught well brother Brandon called us and when you when you're seeking the Holy Ghost anybody in here seeking the Holy Ghost today you're seeking that place with god brother man said what you got to do he said listen you're not going to get it out of this altar come on now I believe in prayer until y'all know me I'm I'mma Acts 2 38 tongue talking Holy Ghost rolling preacher I believe in the whole thing but you'll never get salvation out of an altar you won't get the Holy Ghost out of an altar it's a good place to find it but you won't get it there where you get it is in the power of the blood of Jesus Christ and you can pray and you can fast and you can do anything you want but at some points you've got to confess what Jesus did for you and the power of that blood comes back into a Believer and sanctions Alive by the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the blood of Jesus Christ that saves the man that sanctifies a man and fills a man with the Holy Ghost there is nothing like the blood and oh the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus Mary a man ever came to the blood was disappointed by his finding in it shall find healing in it you'll find Salvation in it you'll find Grace in it you'll find an escape I'm talking about the blood your brother and said if you're hunting that Holy Ghost what you ought to do get your confession right he said then drive you a steak I may ever heard him say it he said drive a steak next to your seat he said that you'll have a place to bring the devil back to wherever you are in the world 20 years later the Devil Comes say brother Brian he'll come and say you ain't got the Holy Ghost you'll say oh wait a minute devil back there in the rain on the third Pew back late one night I was praying for the Holy Ghost and I took a steak out of my bag and I drove that steak down and devil if you want me to I can go up there and lead you to the place tonight because the power of them something that is able to change that I still have sound it's the power of the blood it's still able to change it now what am I talking about I'm talking about the blood the driving of the stake and our God took his own advice and he drove a stake that day at Calvary and he said from this day on right here at this place his sin has been defeated Devils have been defeated the Church of the Living God of Jesus Christ devils are defeated the wild is defeated there is nothing like the blood drive your stake this morning listen look at God and look at the statement he drove for your care for your life except for the Wayne I don't know we might have to go through the tribulation not if you'll accept this blood if you will accept this Blood amen nothing you don't expect nothing but a body change God does not have a reason to humiliate you he has humiliated himself to show you he can take the humiliated and bring it to a glorification he took the most humiliated State a man could be in and he glorified that body and said this is the power that I have to change I can take it from humiliation and to bring it to glorification that's not a sin of one sitting in here this morning that you don't know what I'm talking about not one of you don't know that you were in a state of humiliation you were living for the world laying out somewhere in a bar room maybe drinking or whatever have you but the God who is rich in Mercy came into your humiliated life and change you changed you I think the battery just went bad bro do you see what it is it was from a degraded state from a humiliated state to be brought into the glorification of God that's exactly what God's going to do with you he's not going to do it through tribulation and he's not going to do it through persecution he's going to do it through that blood and that blood is going to redeem this church this blood's going to go home in glory through the power of the blood that's the way she goes it's through the power of the blood now I know things I know things are are looking a certain way and All the Troubles is everywhere but the prophet of God said when this happens he said we need to look up for we have a conversation in heaven we have our conversation in heaven you said brother Wayne what is our conversation brother Brandon said our conversation he said it's uh it's it's our language you know uh if you if you studied this particular spot our our conversation in heaven other translations replace conversation with citizenship because it actually knows a Believer is already a citizen of Heaven now if America was about to bomb somewhere do you know the first thing they do they get all the citizens out that's right you're a citizen of the kingdom of God and before God allows Russia to bomb this nation you ambassadors come home citizens come home he sins he sends flights that are specific for the carrying out of that citizen it's not for all that Nation it's not for all them people it's for the citizens and the employees of that nation and God has got a nation it's a Heavenly nation and we are ambassadors of that nation and we speak the language of that Nation amen now the prophet of God said you see if you speak that language he said he said what you got to do is remember the devil has a language and God has a language don't you be speaking the devil's language he said what's what's the devil's language well I'm weak my faith is not very much I'm not a very good Christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language listen you're you're a citizen of another Nation you have a different language right the Africans speak French the conqueror's language the African speaks Portuguese it's the conquerors language the bride speaks Faith it's the conquerors language [Applause] as you first become a Christian you start learning to talk early what what language you're taught is faith and as you grow the faith language is articulated it's developed it's sharpened it's anointed and after a while you speak fluently and perfectly the language of Faith the Bride of Jesus Christ I just go I'll just go into educational for you the Bride of Jesus Christ has a doctorate degree in the language of faith we speak Heavenly language before we ever leave the Earth it's a perfect Faith the church has come to the changing of this vile body listen when you look at this word we look for our savior the Lord Jesus Christ you can look that word up it actually means to expect fully we expect fully the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and expectation has got to be built upon the word listen based upon the word of God all Christianity is based upon the faith in the word so what you have faith in the word is your expectation so if you're hearing the word you're getting an expectation now listen folks the word of God is a seed the message of the hour is the word seed of your day the message is the shout which is the beginning of the Rapture phase that God puts the church in he said brother Wayne I want to go on the Rapture how do I go in the Rapture put the word of faith in your heart and the prophet of God said it'll grow and manifest whatever seed it is if you take the seed of rapture you will manifest Rapture if you place Rapture in your heart you're going to manifest Rapture because the gospel seed has been placed into your heart and it'll make you walk now listen friends that was a time that was a time that these things were not available like this but things have changed things have changed I I'm reminded of a service where brother Brandon was preaching and he gets to see in a vision two two great miracles happen at the same time he sees a vision he starts talking about a young girl he said I see a young young black girl he said I see her she's in surgery and he describes the doctor that's doing the surgery he said the surgery is on the throat but it's paralyzed the child and he starts describing it and the mother of the child they're there in the meeting and the mother child starts screaming and she comes up brother Brown she said that's my baby brother random that's my baby and he said I see sister she said well brother random does that mean that the baby can walk now and brother bam looked at her and she said honey she said I don't know he said I just told you what was wrong with the child he said what you need to do is to pray you just stand here and pray and ask God he said and I turned around to go back into the prayer line he said and when I did the mother was praying he said another Vision struck and he said I was looking at a dark Street and he said I seen a little girl I believe she had a baby doll didn't you and she'd come running down the side street he said that I seen her run across the street and pick up the doll I think it's the way the vision went and he said there it is he said there it is he said she can walk that's thus saith the Lord the lady said you mean she can walk he said she can now five minutes ago she couldn't but she can now because a Prophet by Vision opened up away the minute he said that Congressman Upshaw was sitting in the back of the building he said I see a great man he's wearing a brown colored suit I've seen him fall as a child laying on the bed and starts describing the congressman and the congressman says somebody says to brother Bradham that's Congressman Upshaw he's sitting in the back man been paralyzed for 66 years y'all remember the story the man stands up they take a cord back there and brother Brandon says is that you is that your he said yes brother Bradham that's me I said I've been searching for Healing For Years brother bam turned and he saw another vision and he said sir he said do you have I think it's a blue pinstripe or something of that I think it's a blue he's wearing a brown so he said you own a blue colored pinstripe suit the man said I bought it today brother Branham he said thus saith the Lord I will meet you wearing that suit in a few days you'll walk again till that day it was not possible to walk like that he didn't even own the suit he was going to walk in but he bought the suit on the right day and a prophet anointed spoke a word that opened up a way for him to walk like he never walked before what am I saying to you today I'm saying that you may not it may have been a time in your life you may be sitting here this morning and things have been a certain way and you've not been walking for the Lord You've not had things like you needed them and you say someday I'd like to but God opens up the door he opens up a way and all of a sudden there's a way made and you can walk like you've never walked before a church you said what's that matter because this bride is an Enoch type and she's going to walk with God until she's not I think it's time for the bride to start walking [Applause] these are not fables folks I I told Brian I didn't have time to get into all these things today so I'm not going to touch this but I just come through a Rapture and I've studied strongly on Enoch's pyramid if you study Enoch's pyramid and you take what brother Brandon said about it he says if you watch that last great step he said there's where we're standing today we're the one would introduce the comer the worshiper it would introduce It To The King brother Brian when they discovered Enoch's pyramid they were looking for Treasures for gold for silver they didn't find it in Enoch's pyramid that's why they say they don't believe it was a tomb it was an altar because there was no gold really of any value found in Enoch's pyramid because the treasure that was hid there it was not The Treasure of silver and gold the treasure that was hid in Enoch's pyramid was the mystery of how a man could walk from one dimension to another and Enoch's changed come when he introduced to the king that's where they went the Coffer and the way was opened now I said that to say this when brother Brandon preaches that sermon stature the perfect man he shows Enoch's pyramid was not capped in his Revelation but in our day in our Revelation the pyramid came but it was capped and William branham's pyramid was the Statue of a perfect man and he put the Capstone on the church somebody said what does that matter because if you're reading II Peter he said that let us add remember let us add let us add until we get to love right he said then there'll be an entrance preached unto you amen amen there'll be an entrance at the time of Love there'll be an entrance preached under the Everlasting Kingdom you see First Corinthians 13 Love's going to come he said what's going to happen then you'll be known as you were known you're going to know as you were known what about in First John 3 when he said what kind of love is this the father bestowed upon us to be called as sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is at the time of perfect love again there is an opening that teaches us what we were before and how we can walk back he said brother Wayne what are you talking about I'm talking about the message of William Branham has opened a way for you to walk with God in such a way amen yes sir you uh just just in closing uh if your musicians would come I was just I was just out at um at uh with brother Doug Baker a couple years ago he took me to Sabino Canyon how many have you been to Sabino I'd love to show you the pictures maybe we'll do it someday but uh brother Perry has him on his website out there in Tucson but in wings of a snow white dove brother Brown tells a story about how he was out in Sabino Canyon and he come up and he said I walked up to a rock and he said I've been you remember he'd been praying and about his ministering things he said he walked up to a rock and how many ever seen the picture he walks up to a rock and he said I laid up against The Rock and the Lord said what's that under your heart remember when he said what's that under your heart he said I stepped back and looked and in the stone was written White Eagle it's the word Eagle written in the English language but it's white Court and now think about this if you see the picture of Perry green it'll strike Perry green about right here but when the prophet stood there it was right at his heart now if you took it if you look at a picture of that it actually is the pyramid it's powerful it's actually the pyramid the Top of the Rock is a pyramid and one side of it's flat well when we went there with brother Doug we walked up and he said well Wayne you notice anything odd about this spot I said I do brother duck he said what is it I said somebody has drilled and shot the rock here he said how do you know that I said well I used to work construction we did a lot of pre-splits we rock drilled put dynamite in it blew it off and there's a little and next time you're at a restaurant where there's a rock wall look at that rock wall you'll see little strips and you'll remember oh those are drill marks if you ever see them you know what they are so I sing them drill marks and I said somebody has dynamited uh dominated right here he said that's right he said the other half of this rock is laying down there and if you're if you're walking next to Eagle Rock it's bigger than the spot right here but not much like if it's maybe a three foot spot where you could walk by eagle rocks to your left and it's a slope like this so at some point someone split this huge Rock in half with dynamite and the other half's laying down there that eagle that white quartz was in that rock and when they blew it apart it exposed it having been in there since God created The Rock so being the guy I am you know I go home and I start studying Sabino Canyon the trails in that Canyon were built in 1933 the same time the angel of the Lord came to William Branham in Ohio River they was out there dynamite in that rock and they were opening up that Granite Stone of pyramid and inside of the inside was written White Eagle look folks a four inch spot four inch spot how big is this world how big is the circumference of this world William Branham would put his heart over a spot that's that big out of every Rock in every canyon in the world and he would put his heart over that that was not available until 1933. you couldn't walk like this until this Vision came you couldn't walk the trail you're walking this morning somebody says to me so well brother Wayne the historians teach it a certain way they did that because it wasn't available if you talk to a man from the mid-1800s and you were talking to him and said hey I come up down the Sabino the other day and I walked right down this certain Trail he'd go there ain't no Trail in there no Trail in there how there's a big rock laying across that you've got to go down the hill or way up the hill there's no Trail through there there is now people said well brother Wayne we need this to have a rapture we need this to have a rapture God has opened the way amen let's stand to our feet this morning why don't you come walk that way there's a way that has been provided let's just buy our hearts this morning Lord Jesus we're so thankful these are not fables that we are following Lord you you wrote it in the rocks Enoch wrote it in a pyramid and then walked off of the earth to vindicate his revelation father we thank you today that you've invited us to come walk with you now Lord Jesus there's needs there's Hearts there's lies and I just pray this morning Lord you to help us to walk with you let us surrender our beings let us drive down our Stakes and let us walk with you father we commit this meeting into thy faithful hands we thank you for Amelia Grace Lord we thank you for this lovely Place Lord that has dedicated her this morning we praise your faithful name amen amen How Deep The

the final word he is the a man and the amen has spoken the amen has led us it's over [Music] you remember that how many testimonies brother Brown talks about and gives situations where people had they go in and after it's just settled it just dropped sovereignly and they can look at a screen the nurses can look at the screen and say you're crazy you don't know I I know this part they knew that part medically that God had already dropped in their heart it's over it's over and God manifested just what he said so what I expect you'd expect the full manifestation it's over we you know one of the greatest things that has been done right here in this service you could think Lord if I could do this for you if I could do this for you know the greatest thing we can do for him is to just take him at his word that's the greatest thing we can do is to believe what he said to have faith and it's the greatest thing we can do and you know he's given us Grace to even be able to do that that's that's him that's given us that Grace didn't I don't know it just overwhelms me because when it all comes back to when we look in our lives the only thing we can say is him it's him it's him Hallelujah let's just go to him in prayer let's just talk to the Lord here father Lord I know I I sometimes Lord I don't feel like thank you is enough [Music] but I Lord you know my heart [Music] I say thank you Lord
