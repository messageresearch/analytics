[Music] praise the name of the Lord why don't you turn around and greet someone in the name of the Lord welcome to the house of the Lord God bless you have you here math then we'll let you have your seats and just have a testimony I'd like to be given here he's got Paul's Mike yeah he has Paul's mic okay so in the Jewish way God bless you I just want to thank the church and uh for all the players because it's been more than almost two years since I start going back and forth to Congo to get married and initially start with uh like a fiance process through the immigration for my wife to come here and get married but it took so long that we decided that we have to get married and we can get the marriage license here so back in March in February actually we got married but there was no answer you guys the church been praying through all that and uh I'm very thankful for that so late March we got the initial approval from the immigration usually it's taking uh very fast after the immigration approves but for some reason from The Fallout of the kovid the pandemic and pandemy and everything so things scatter very stretched out so by God grace the case cutter to the Embassy in Congo in June and also it's supposed to be fast after it gets to the embassy it's like a few weeks but for some reason the embassy had its own problems also um turns out that people I sent there to check on how fast we can get the case approved to the Embassy they told them that it's going to be up to 2025. so it was like a very traumatic but through it all we trusted in God and us so that's why sometimes we let by let things pass we don't testify but this I know that it's uh the hand of God that intervened that this time this week it's been since Monday I was back and forth the embassy to see what can be done and there was not like Assurance any anyhow so but by Friday we got the email that they cut the interview for her for November 22nd so that's I was very thankful and I want to say that God is able everything that can be beyond our mind our in my imagination just give it to a god hands easable so I thank God and thank you guys for all the prayers God bless you thank you [Music] he was containing himself we were talking last night I said so if I tell it do we'll excuse you from doing cartwheels in the church dancing you know but uh just so thankful to the Lord amen for his Mercy and God is so good isn't he so faithful mindful of each and every one of our needs hey man I'm so grateful for that just want to greet you in the name of the Lord [Music] visitors that are here with us [Applause] just want to turn our our thoughts and our attention to the word of the Lord we just approach him this morning and my what a what a song what a testimony through it all through it all yes you know if God takes to test and Opera tests and trials and our flesh doesn't like him no matter how old we get we don't like but God knows what's best for us and not only is God molding us and shaping Us in the midst of that and it's not that God's discovering something new about us God already knows what laziness but God wants you to see what lays in you like how brother Bram said it like this when he talks about job he says you know when the tests and Trials come he said what God was doing he was bringing out the qualities that are in a believer and that's tremendous so there's nothing that brings out the qualities of a believer as a test and proud because you know what it does it puts this person down to the down to the place there where we realize I can't do nothing I can't do nothing this is a frail vessel depend on him that's what God told Paul Paul my grace is sufficient and aren't you glad for that amen I'm so grateful for that amen it's him that's holding me not me holding him I don't have that kind of strength to hold on but it's him it's him it's him and that's why we could stand and we could sing again to God be the glory but we need to move on into the service but I say to God to God be the glory God bless you for the just read we're happy when he called me last night I thought oh Lord I thought Lord I hope I'm going to be able to go to bed tonight and sometimes you know it's things that you know my mind's pondering with the service coming on and I was just really weary and when he called me I said oh my God you know when you see God you hear God moving to me it isn't excitement those are things excitement is when you see God moving you hear a testimony those are the kind of things that just cause me to want to run on just a few hours of sleep and uh but I just it's the God is so good so I want you to continue to pray I told Brother Joshua I said this is what we're doing I said we're going to pray as a church not only through the interview but until she stands on this soil [Music] until like it was when Peter knocked on the door so let's keep praying don't pull back on your prayers you know that's one thing sometimes when you you hear God move for a situation A need that we're praying for a sickness when you start hearing things getting better that's not the time to pull back that's the time to even be pray even more because when challenges come brother Brown talks about how one of the best signs of healing just that phrase best sign is when you start getting sicker things start getting worse my brother bam takes that whole thing in deep cult the Deep takes a whole part of it and goes through that there that's the very time that when someone's going through that we want to stay steadfast in prayer until they're not on the door amen don't you love the Lord amen isn't it good to serving amen Hallelujah well God bless you musicians thank you brother Brian the song song service if we could let's just stand there and want to go right to the word of the Lord and I would invite you to turn with me to First Peter chapter five no we want to read just a few verses of scripture here this morning also remember to remind her to the young people from and I sent that out on the group thread this morning the activity that we have for you from five to seven and uh there at the sports center and brother um Brian and sister Mariah brother Shane sister Lily you can see them if you have questions um so then there's another announcements with that as well verse 5. likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth Grace to the humble humble yourselves notice this in verse six humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so it's it's not just something that's left open to interpretation of humbling ourselves or what level of humility or to whom or to what but humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him whatever your need is whatever your worry is whatever it is or your anxiety cast it upon him for he Karen for you amen let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer amen maybe you'd like to be remembered in a word of prayer this morning Lord Remember Me Lord my need amen maybe you have a loved one on your heart amen God bless you God bless your hands let's just approach his throne now together father as we just Lord enter into this further part of the service this morning Lord how we are just Lord standing here in need of you Lord how we thank you for the opportunity that we've had here this morning to come and together and to worship you thank you Lord for the songs that you've given Lord and laid upon the heart father of our brother Lord and thank you Father Lord for oh God the opportunity that we can come and just to begin to Worship You Lord and father an atmosphere has created Lord as we're just thinking upon you thinking on the good things of God and Lord where you brought us from and Lord to know that you're our deliverer and Lord no matter what situation no matter what the need Lord father you are indeed an ever-present God you're our savior Lord and how you love Lord to show yourself Lord on behalf of your children Lord and we just asked this morning Lord behind every one of these hands there's a request that Lord is laying upon the hearts of your children that God we even as we hear the testimony Lord that God will brother Joshua the Lord the first announcements that was made to them is don't expect anything to 2025. Lord sometimes there's things that are spoke to us doctors report on and on and on that can literally Lord like knocking the breath out of us Lord but oh God how thankful I Am Lord that father there's a there's a peace there's a direction on the inside like David could say I will lift up mine eyes to the heels from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord Lord we can't explain it but we Are Witnesses Lord of your saving strength and your grace time and time again so Lord will you just sweep by Lord our way this morning sweep through every Pew Lord through every life through every heart and may you grant Lord Quest that's behind the hands this morning Lord minister to those that are not able to be here Lord that they're sick in their bodies Lord and father I pray that you would just minister to them give them strength Lord we love you and we praise you and we just ask that you would have your way in this service may it all be done for the glory of God in Jesus name amen God bless you and you're being seated I want to speak here just a few moments on a on the thought Grace to the humble and um it's quite subject we've been looking at with Grace and uh to see here I'd like to just I'd like to open I'd like to read this quote that brother Branham makes her at the end of the message token and this is where a lot of it just started to move brother Bram says Lord Jesus most gracious one when the world was in sin and no one could help God in Mercy for showing by a type that there was coming a token that could take away sin not just cover it but could take it away amen and Jesus came in the right time he always comes in the right time and he shed the blood his own life making us an atonement for our sins and then presenting him back in the form of the Holy Ghost which is now a token that's to be kept to the church until he comes so a token would be like that if you have a bus fare or you have an airline ticket and probably every one of us and you you we have awareness of that I remember when I was going to school there was such a thing that you know you you couldn't just walk up to the lunch lady it got to a place for us you couldn't just walk up and pay him for something if you wanted a lunch you had to buy what they called little tokens or maybe you had a lunch card that was punched or there was something and and that way they handled the money the purchase was made they knew how many lunches to provide and then you went with your little card or whatever it was your token same thing with an airline you just don't go to an airport matter of fact you're not going to get into an airport without an even into security without having your ID and having that they can see see that you actually have a ticket so that ticket itself is a token it's so it shows that you've already paid the price for the fare so that's what that's what the profit is referring back to the Token than even that God said that when I see the blood in Exodus 12 when I see the blood meaning a life has already been given a life has already been surrendered there's already been a sacrifice and when I see the blood then I will pass over you so God was looking at for the sacrifice for the blood so now let me just move on with that he says it's a token that's to be kept to the church until he comes for the Apostle Peter said the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Lord by your grace your help I claim everyone that hears this message I claim them for God I pray thee Lord both here this morning and those that will here on tape if there be a seed anywhere that's predestinated Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now sweetly and humbly and lay their trophies down at the cross or their self as a trophy of the grace of God that's called them and may they be filled with the Holy Spirit and display the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on Earth what a privilege it is to be called to be bitten by the Holy Spirit to come and what a privilege it is to have a heart that would say yes Lord amen laying down our trophies not our accolades not what we could do or what anything that we have to present because as the scripture says our righteousness alone is as filthy rags in his sight and so to think what a privilege it is I you know we could be identified with a lot of people and sometimes men will strive to get into certain companies or groups and allotments of people they'll do a lot of things but to think that here is one that it's not you or I seeking to get into identity with him he came down and was identified with us he's the one that's extended an invitation to you and I come take my yoke upon you and learn of me come unto me all you that are heavy labor Laden and I will give you rest and then to be able to just surrender to an invitation so it's not us trying to work our way into a place with somebody and you know make it in their friend list her you know we're a part of their group or but the thing that God himself come down and invited you and I and has drawn upon us and all we have to do is accept the invitation just like when an invitation is given in your mailbox for a wedding all you've got to do is check with an RSVP I'll be there and that's the same thing the Holy Spirit comes down to says will you surrender your life will you give your all and uh you know I'll take your life and I'll make out of it what you could never dream possible I'll take care of all of your Sorrows I'll take care of all of your sin problem I'll take care of whatever the healing complex whatever it is in your life just come to me and and I'll take care of it all and to think what a privilege to be associated with the Lord God Almighty that where even Abraham could say and be regarded as a friend of God ask somebody to be friends with so the way up the way up is actually down because how that the world is always contrary to that and so the way up is always down so to become a real Christian to be filled with God's own life it is only going to come by humility in the message believeth thou this he says if you ever get anything from God you have to humble yourself and become nothing before him and know nothing but one purpose that is you're trying to find Jesus then when you humble yourself down God will exalt but when you exalt yourself God will see that you are not brought to a base he said so in his word so we don't want to be found as proud you say well what would proud be proud would be to resist him who is making himself known to you that's Pride but the humility is to see him and to lower ourselves not just not our body but to lower our hearts because we can we can do a lot with our body we can do look there's a lot of religions in the world that my that when it would come to as far as even when you look at Christianity and my the way that they will treat their body and everything else even with you know I I think of the poor Roman Catholics that moved through the streets there in Manila in the Philippines and they are having you know people are lined out and they're carrying crosses and they're taking whips and they're whipping their back and all that takes place during the Easter time there and but to think that you know within this right here of how God within his Mercy that we recognize that God's desire for us is that our hearts would be moved in obedience to God we don't want just something that's on the outside we want that move on the inside man remember Satan chose the head God chose the heart James 4 10 humble yourselves in the sight this is the presence of the Lord and He Shall lift you up the very thing that has been mentioned all through the scriptures but here we've drawn from this in the New Testament and he shall lift you up so notice humble yourselves in the presence of God and he will lift you up to be lifted up or the word exalt from our text is to lift up on high to raise to the very summon of opulence and that means of abundance of richness and prosperity now I'm not speaking you know of a smiley tooth text and gospel here I'm talking about a real abundance of God's grace in your soul I'm talking about of how that the Paul would speak about that the commission that he was under is to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ that we might know the riches of his grace which is Christ in you the hope of glory to exalt to raise to dignity honor and happiness and to think of it of how that you know Satan is always from the very fall in the beginning his enticement and his lurement even in heaven when Satan preached there in heaven and he led a third of the Angels astray he presented a kingdom that was more brighter more beautiful than that of Michael's Kingdom and there was a third of the angels that fell and were LED of weight now we know those angels now is demons they're they're spirits but there were two-thirds who never left their first estate is that right and now we find that from that of battle in heaven then when here upon Earth we find that Satan in the opening there uh in Ezekiel we find the call even in gym job one of how that that Satan himself was walking through and fro throughout the Earth even in Ezekiel while it was forming and Satan was wanting to lay claim upon this Earth he saw that God this God took an interest in this Beyond every other planet every other planet has its place for a sign but you know I could save NASA a lot of money quit wasting your money going out there and seeing if a bug can survive and move quit wasting your money to see is there another life out there God there's no other planet that is spoken of in terms of life outside of the word of God yet they're all in there as far as being parched within of the scripture but God took interest and Satan could see that there however that Satan is able to pick this up and Satan while the great volcanics was bulching belching up he was walking upon it wanting to lay a claim on it but you know Satan cannot lay claim on anything that belongs to God he might take it underneath his control for a while but there comes a ransom to release it from the control and the pawn shop of who's got a hold of him is that right now to think of how then through the fall in the beginning how that Satan Works same way he did in heaven he works in a way to try to present it in a manner to Eve that this would be a more a beautiful route and this would be a a wonderful thing you would be as God and he's drawing upon her and you know what he's doing in that moment she has never felt Pride before but in that moment she is being Anointed with unbelief in the word of God you say how can it be unbelief any anointing that leads you astray from the word of God is an anointing of unbelief I don't care how good it looks I don't care how good it feels I don't care how emotional it is or not anymore I don't care if it leads you outside of the word it is an evil spirit and let me just tell you the holy spirit will always lead you to the word through the path of the word because in order to fulfill the word there's got to be a door open for you and you can't go around that door you've got to come through that door is that right we find that without me elaborating we find that with Ahab and Jehoshaphat Ahab wanted to go take Ramos Gilead it belonged to him but you see Ahab was not coming through the open door Ahab was wanting to come in his own way with his own character but God had a man that wasn't ashamed of Elijah's message and he knew Elijah's message was true because God had Vindicated Elijah to be the voice of God in that day and Amica could stand there before all of them when they had zedekiah going around with horns and man you talk about an anointing man they were having such an emotional time but no Direction by the word is that right and then Micah stood there and he said but I've seen he said a line Spirit come up and he said that lion Spirit when God asked who can I get to get go down there and deceive them in their mouth and who can I get and the lion spirit said I'll go down there I'll tell you friends isn't that a sad thing that the lying Spirit could actually know if you let me go I can lead them outside of the will of God yet Ahab could argue and say this is God's word this is God's word but remember the will of God is the spirit of God and when the spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide you into all true that's how you know whether you got the holy ghost or not if they lead you away from it it ain't the Holy Ghost if there's things coming out of your life that doesn't line up with the word it ain't the Holy Ghost because when he comes he'll lead you into the word not away from it we were born to be Sons and Daughters of God brother Brandon says it like this he says but you let the devil get a hold of you and you want to become glamor girls and populars and everything else but humble yourself before the hand of God so God can make Sons and Daughters out of you I'll tell you that's the kind of exalting God's talking about this exalting is not about a personality it's not about a family name it's not about a who's who this exalting is about exalting that seed that was beneath the darkness as the Son and Daughter of God let me tell you the woman at the well when she came there she submitted herself under the mighty hand of God and I'll tell you what you saw leave that well was no longer a woman of ill Fame but you saw a daughter of God that had been exalted by the mighty hand of God because she was willing to Humble herself [Music] so to Humble ourselves I'll say it this way it's the grace of God to recognize him amen his presence his word and humbling ourselves in obedience to his voice don't ever underestimate obedience you could have everything else in the world but if you don't have obedience you've failed Saul was offering up offerings he was a lot of things right Saul could prophesy Saul could get under the anointing of the spirit of God is that right come on I'm talking scripture now but but what Saul couldn't do is humble himself in obedience to the world now we're not against all those things you understand when one against David prophesying all of those things but what it comes down to is is everything itself our discernment our strength our fortitude our foundation is the word of God nothing else are you hearing me amen so then we find humility is what opens the gates to the transforming power of God that's what opens it and we can say well God you humble me no that's not God's remember God says you humble yourself and if you don't I'll humble you right because you say well well I'm not exalting myself if you don't humble yourself in his presence you're exalting yourself above the word you can't stand eye to eye with the word you'll never see it in the right way you'll see it as somebody wanting to rule over your life but when you get into the right position like the man who was looking at the painting and the painting looked horrible but the man who knew about that painting said you're looking at it in the wrong perspective kneel down here get down on your knees Now look up at it and when he knelt down and he looked up at it a total different scene a total different picture why the perspective was changed based on his stature I'll tell you when our heart is in place and he said brother say no how do I bring my heart into that place he will lead you you're in sheep he's a shepherd He knows how to lead our hearts into that place where we humble ourselves under his hand so that's what opens gates to the transforming power of God and that'll Lift You above whatever you're facing Isaiah 66 1. thus saith the Lord the heaven is my throne Earth is my footstool where is the house that ye build unto me and where is the place on my rest for all these those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been saith the Lord you know there wasn't one material think of this in the Tabernacle in the wilderness that was God's desire God was giving a foreshadowing now his is the purpose of redemption is that God might come in Tabernacle inside of man he had that when he walked in Eden in his people he was tabernacled inside of him now every every element they have the gold the silver the brass all of those things even even the different extracts that they would take from the animals and so forth to make the dyes all of those things from the wood to the gold to the silver to those animals he the Lord had made they were only taking from what God had made and it looked just to be trees a gold silver brass but you see under the vision of God then those things that the wonderful in their own but yet under the vision of God they came into a place that would actually Express God's desire and the Mystery that God had in himself that God wanted to Tabernacle inside of man and God tells them what can you build me other than what I've already made I've provided all these things but you see God he is Jehovah Jireh he provides for himself and that's where that seed of God comes from on the inside it was not you putting it there it's not a Sunday school teacher putting it there it wasn't when your heart was pricked that put it there it was there the whole time what is that that is God has placed that there as a place that God can step into and the prophet said receive himself into his Temple it's God it's not you receiving the Holy Ghost it is God the prophet says it like this it's the faith of God receiving himself into the temple not made with hands so how can we glory in anything we can't Grace is given to the humble but to this man verse 2. will I look notice what God said this is what's going to get my attention even to him that is poor meaning humble end of contrite spirit of broken a broken spirit and trembleth at my word I want you to think of this here let's go to Genesis 4. and let's look here that after the fall where two boys Came To Worship here they came Abel and Cain now I'm going to tell you that both of them came to worship God and I'm going to tell you that both of them was humble don't worry I've got quotes to stand up both of them was coming to worship verse 3 of Genesis 4 and in process of time it came to pass that King brought of the fruit of the ground and offering unto the Lord and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering here's one thing that's very certain God's had contact with Abel I tell you something about tremendous of showing up with a Vindication that you know I'm going to be accepted yeah not an arrogance not a pride but God has made himself known that I'm walking with the confidence it's not a maybe when I get down to the last to my last breath or when something had no no but to walk with a certainty in this life you say how how would that come about by God coming down to reveal himself and make himself known Cain's coming too but Cain's certainty is not based on the same thing Abel but under Cain and to his offering offering he had not respect and Cain was very rough and his countenance fell and the Lord said unto King why thou Raw and why is that countenance Fallen you understand God is looking at something that I would say we couldn't even see if we could look in outwardly you wouldn't even see this on Kings but God's looking down deep and God sees where his countenance is interpression is falling he's rough he picks up listen God is a discerner friends we can we can look any way we want to look but God knows the heart them Pharisees which was religious as religious could be but the word is a discerner and let me just tell you this the word don't come to shame you are you hearing me the word comes to expose Satan's works and uncover him notice what God Said in verse 7 if thou do us well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well send life at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him I want you to think of this brother Brown says it like this in the great warrior Joshua he says if God only expects you to be Fundamentalist then he could not condemn Moab and accept Israel he'd be unjust Cain was just as fundamental as Abel was he was a believer build a church and worship offered sacrifice and humbled himself before God who did that Cain did it all of this King did but yet Cain did not receive Grace he didn't receive Grace he built a church that took some labor that took some sacrifice can't you see why Paul could say in First Corinthians 13 though I give my goods to feed the poor though I speak in tongues though I prophesy though I do all these other things unless I have love I'm not talking about an ooey gooey powdered sugar feeling I'm talking about the love of God that loves God loves his word above everything even above your own thoughts that's the love of God everything else will eventually cease but charity never failures Cain was just as fundamental as Abel was was a Believer build a church worship offered sacrifice humbled himself before God if it only takes to be a believer well you say I'm a Believer well if God's never give you the Holy Ghost you're not a Believer yet for God is under obligation to give you the holy spirit scripture when he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins you shout not maybe not might not could be you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost God's under obligation to do it for it forts to who the apostles no sir Peter said it's for you and your children and them that's far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call no matter how far it is it's for every believer now notice when we look at this of how that even in Christ the mystery even how Lucifer we talked about in heaven when where everything was painted up so beautiful there is in heaven and how that even came to Eve and said surely you know oh you know God doesn't care that don't matter to God surely you won't die I'm going to tell you something anything that deviates from the word and tells you it's all right you better run from it because it is not of God it doesn't matter if it's inside a church it doesn't matter if it's as religious as religious could be remember John was given a personal tour on the Isle of Patmos and here in a vision he saw that that woman on a Scarlet colored beast and John was breathtaken by the Bible says oh he was an awestruck by her she was decked out in Garb that seemed to be so holy crosses and everything else but once it was uncovered what was in her was the blood of the martyrs she was not one that wanted to promote life she was one that wanted to take life wow I don't care what the Roman Catholic Church says they're the biggest promoters of abortion there is not just naturally but spiritually that happens in those convents come on friends we're not ignorant of these things not only does it happen in the natural it's happened spiritual that same Babylonian spirit that anointed Pharaoh in Egypt that wanted to kill all the children and try to get to the promise that's the same way the spirit of the devil will do is to try to kill and bring an abort to what God is wanting to bring forth in your life Satan could say my we're a beautiful church I mean God surely well look at our great buildings look at all these other things but that's not what God's looking for in paragraph 62 he said the same thing that's the same thing Cain did brought in the pretty fruits from the ground that he had tilled toiled and worked and brought in the fruits and rejected the humble blood of the Lamb Cain didn't want nothing to do with that that's too messy I don't want nothing to do with that now Cain didn't come in offer God some of these hydroponic tomatoes we get out of wherever some of these I tell you there's one thing on my wife y'all know this already my wife would send me and we know when we go I'd sometimes try to help her out and go to the store and things like that you know the part by the way that I hated I hated going to produce especially I'd look on there and see pick up Tomatoes you say why because they are fake I don't like those Tomatoes they don't look real when I was a little boy I remember Tomatoes they actually were the color red not pink not keep them on your windowsill for two years and they'll be ready for salsa in two years from now yeah what am I saying Cain did not bring God just some haphazard something he did not bring him apples or tomatoes or things where worms are crawling out of it he brought him his very best now watch this in God's power to transform he said Abel's message had been received his message remember God had revealed himself to Abel you can read it in Hebrews 11. Abel's message had been received how do I know it's been received because the fire came down on the altar how do I know when my message when the message from my heart when it's received the fire will come down and consume for our God is a consuming fire well how do I know how how do I know how to build the altar well the altar's already been established the altar is Calvary and that altar of Calvary will lead you to an altar in your own life of self-surrender and when you're following the word he'll let you know how to put the wood in order he'll let you know how to put everything get your life in order well brother Samuel I just want the fire of God listen to me friends you can ask God for the Holy Ghost without having your life in order this time I want quotes on that I can give you an abundance of them brothers brother random why don't you teach these women how to receive great gifts why don't you this is a quote doors and door why don't you teach them how to receive the Holy Ghost he said they won't even let their hair grow how can I teach them to receive the Holy Ghost see sometimes we're looking at things and we know the Holy Spirit comes in it'll consume the desires it'll change our life but sometimes we're wanting God to do every single thing in our life and that's why it's missed we must ourselves humble ourselves before him then he will exalt you in due time how long Lord in due time don't put him on timeline don't put him on a timeline are you hearing me friends now let me just say this do I believe that God can take care there can be a man that's a severe alcoholic and right here this morning why are the words going forth even as the service maybe we'll have prayer at the end God will absolutely can come right down if that man's desire is to really surrender his heart to God God will take care of that alcoholic Spirit he'll take that right out of that man's life and God can feel that life do you realize full obedience it's not all together at my works you can come into full obedience while the words being preached and then that entitles you to the token is that clear notice this he's seen Abel's message had been received and Cain saw it and know that God had Vindicated that message right but he just couldn't do it his pride oh what a horrible thing pride is his pride kept him from it that's right his pride kept him from doing it he's seen God vindicate the message do you catch what the prophet's saying here his pride kept him from doing it it wasn't that Cain didn't want to do it his pride there are things that he thought of that Satan flashed before his eyes flashed before him if you do this friends will turn on you if you do this this could happen what was it it was shaped and operated in that door of pride he wanted to but he couldn't that's why brother Graham could stand at the end and preach not only in this message but he goes on to preach and the message Shalom actually was a year before he preached these messages and he says I've realized he said I feel sorry for the people he said the gross Darkness that's upon the people there's people they want to do right he said there's women that hear you shouldn't cut their hair that's according to scripture yeah here men and all these other things that are laid out there even in those very basic things that we in ourselves can do in honor and humility to the word of God but he says they want to do it this is the prophet's words but something won't let them what is it spirits but I'm glad there's one here that's present to break every spirit oh friends I'm not just announcing and I'm also a witness of that a witness in my own life and I am a witness through this congregation I am a witness where God seen in God's stand countless times even throughout the world the places even I've been and watch God break Spirits where Spirits themselves have lost their hold on a life and the life stands there and says I'm ready for my Liberty that's the hymn his pride kept him from doing it he's seen God vindicate the message he says oh it seems to be now so hard for people to Humble themselves to the word of God they just don't want to do it they'll humble themselves to the Creed of the church but not to the word of God everything The Humble everything remember Cain humbled himself but they'll humble themselves up to everything but the new birth they'll humble themselves up everything but to death to self I want you to think of this here Cain's offering was indeed a production or a product of life it was life life that had traveled through the vlines through the tree through all the plants and he came to offer up those fruits but within that his offering didn't require death it didn't require Cain going taking back his knife and slaying the Apple right cutting the tomato but Abel's offering had life in it it was a pre-figure of the Lamb of God an innocent one a first sling of the flock one it would be a firstborn to pay the price for the other firstborns that were coming on and he would lead him there that land he was leading him there the whole way there when he placed him on the altar came places his fruit over there Abel's lamb is placed there and Abel rears back and he's having to you know hold it right there and it begins to make that cut and that live that gurgling is going out that life that's what happened on Calvary yeah he was it was life is going out blood that was being shed why was it blood because blood had taken us out why did God have to become through that of a virgin-born son because the blood was polluted there was not I don't care how righteous a man could be he was not worthy to die for another man because he himself was born in sin and shaped in iniquity it took God himself coming down and creating a blood cell that he could go and pay the price for you and I are you talking about Grace Matthew 18 1 the same time came the disciples unto Jesus and said who's the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of him watch this great deep deep deep deep answer who's the greatest who's the greatest and he called out a little child he's called a little child come here set him right in the midst so their focus will be upon this child he said except you be converted and become as a little child you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven so to come into a place of repentance and become like that of the little child who is it that can bring repentance it's not man it's not friends it's nothing but God do you realize when you recognize listen to me now when you recognize you're wrong that is the presence of God [Applause] but how dangerous it is for lives that don't recognize they're they're wrong why they don't recognize his presence but when you can recognize his presence and say God have mercy on me Lord help me Lord I'm in need Lord Doug it says Grace his presence that's a time to humble yourself whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven you know a real a real little child there's something about it there have to be couldn't be a teenager right here it'd have to be something maybe could have had to be like a toddler or smaller because you know what he's speaking to you and I on the Simplicity of a child childlike Faith to Simply believe God and trust him that's what it takes for a child but you know the older we get the smarter we get and actually the Dumber we get we trust everything else the less We Trust more in our own selves We Trust more on our own abilities and we didn't even give ourselves those abilities you never put those talents in you or I went to college let me tell you something there ain't a professor one that taught you how to be this or taught you how to be that those skills were already in you and you've come to find out what God has placed within you that he will direct and provide for himself God promised he'd be a provider he'd take care of you I don't have time to spend time on that and go back to the book of that citizen prove that statement but that's scripture now I want you to understand this these very things to become as a child the same as the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven what to be born of the spirit of God to allow the spirit of God to lead us in Repentance to move Upon Our Lives into a place of surrender to where we are born into the kingdom of God that is the greatest Luke 10 21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in the spirit and said I thank the O Father Lord of Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight boy I'm so thankful for that you might say brother Samuel will you you know you've got a Bachelor's degree and a master's degree but I don't understand God by a bachelor's degree or master's degree I don't understand God that way listen the scripture tells us in the book of Isaiah 29 that they delivered this book to one who is unlearned and the unlearned says I cannot read it because I'm not learned and they delivered delivered it to the Learned person and the Learned person said I can't read it because the words of this book are as the words of a book that's sealed so there's only one that can reveal the contents of this book and that's the Holy Ghost it's the same holy spirit that moved upon the prophets of old that gave them and lifted them Beyond this Dimension that they were dwelling in and begin to let them tap into the thoughts in the mind of God let me tell you we might be sitting here at 15 30 Lake Breeze road but we are privileged to enter into Heavenly places where the thoughts of God are breaking over our lives and we're being lifted by the thoughts of almighty God [Music] thank you in fellowship with the Holy Ghost in fellowship with the prophets in fellowship with all the sages of old we are partakers of the same life that anointed them lifted them gave them Grace to live and the same Holy Ghost has returned after Calvary and Has Lifted us into the thoughts of God [Applause] [Music] reveal them unto who babes we think we're big stuff we don't need a car seat anymore a booster seat and we're big stuff I can ride in the front seat now law says you got to be 18 to ride there just don't check that out I'm only tease it I can ride up front now and this and but notice isn't it look look how look look how it works it works so contrary to the way that in our human nature we are purported and told come on come on come on you got to pick up responsibility come on come on nothing wrong with that come on come on come on in come on and you know sometimes things go along and depending on how backgrounds will be even lives are told don't cry sissies cry you shouldn't cry you're a boy you're a man Sissy's cry I don't know how I got on that would you understand all of these things come along and all those things it may not be even a crying here but it can teach such a hardness down here this is manly and this is this aren't you grateful for the grace of God that comes to teach us I'm glad for it I thank you Jesus everything is so within the world everything is so contrary to that of humility the world is let me step on you till I can get there that's that's how the world everything is is placed around because remember Satan who is the perverter and now this world not the Earth the world the system that's on it is started based on that of Pride started based on that of Love desires and things outside of the word of God and drawing people into that place always purporting and pushing other things ahead but notice what the contrary he reveals unto babes to be able to become little to say Lord show me your word Lord I look at Moses here he was Moses had met the pillar fire he had come out of Egypt God had led him to this place but he asked God show me yourself show me yourself Lead Me Lord oh it never stops to our lives as a Believer Lord show me yourself Lord make yourself known more to me Lord think of it to me that of a babe the room says you don't have to be smart you don't have you just have to humble yourself God's words are Secret Love Letters to his church my mama and Faith once delivered to the Saints he says be a baby now that's the only time you'll hear a pastor say that be a baby humble yourself and say oh God here I am just make yourself known to me I love you God will reveal himself to you he will make himself known notice I love you see friends that's where it all begins everything else that can be done that's fine but but most importantly fall in love with him you fall in love with him he'll take your life over lord I Love You Lord teach me show me Lord help me move upon my life Lord bring me into that place oh brother the same you don't know how many times don't be proud don't resist him let's say God help me lead me to that place Lord even in my heart in my life help me to stay tender help me to stay humble Lord in the midst of a world that is so divided such division everywhere such hatred such and Tall so many things but God help me to stay humble help me Lord James chapter 1 verse 22 be ye doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like a man beholding his natural face in a glass for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straight we forgiveth what manner of man he was that's like getting up in the morning and not taking care of your bed head everybody knows what bedhead is I used to have it where your hair could be you know this way it could be this way it might be mashed up on one side and you go look in the mirror and all of a sudden you realize oh my goodness I'm going to be late and you forget the Bed Head you saw in the mirrors of life he could try to get you distracted with friends family on and on and on we could go any way anything he can see that'll get you to take your eyes off what the spirit of God is wanting you and I to focus on maybe it's we need to comb this maybe we got the big spot on our shirt and we're like oh my I just got everything straightened out I got this big spot maybe you put your jeans on to go to work and you got the big bleach spot right here and you know here you got to go out and sail that day and you look at it and all of a sudden oh my goodness I got to get going oh I forgot I gotta run by here first I got to go to the bank I got to go here and you run out looking like that see all it takes are you hearing me now it isn't all together willfulness friends it's sometimes the things that we allow to distract us from what God is wanting us to focus on but here's verse 25 but whoso looketh I love this looketh in into the perfect are in he being not a forgetful hero but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed I love this phrase brother Joey looketh into you know what this word means you know what it means this phrase it means one who Stoops down and you got to get down to look into something you ever had somewhere you got like a little little hole maybe something or something you know in the wall or something you got to repair you can't stand up there and do it you got to get down and you get down there like that make sure the dogs ain't around you get down there and you look around and you got to get down like that listen but who's so stupid humbleth themselves and keeps on looking into the perfect law of Liberty and continues therein Lord Draw Me Closer to You More that's what I want to be Lauren I know there's a lot of Affairs of life but God you you you'll be the one if I put you first everything else you pull in order I I don't need to be worried with that if I'm looking to you you'll give me the grace to move through all these things in life that's his grace to the humble through it all everybody okay so there's a great great difference between being religious and having Revelation it's a great difference I mean there's people that listen friends people can be so religious they can quote you scriptures quote you the Bible buddy you put one scripture they'll finish a chapter for you that's if there's no life behind it that's only religion and religions are covering whether it's quotes whether it's scriptures that's not I say it in a way that we might understand God's desire is not religion God don't want you and I to impress him I don't want you you and I had to impress him we don't have to try to gain his approval he has already expressed his love to you and I he came and he gave them his life for you and he sent back the Holy Ghost you want to know what he thinks about you he's continued to knock at your door God ain't just sending you a word he himself is coming and Knocking at Your Heart let me in let me take control of your life amen that's God's thoughts towards you there's a great difference between being religious and having Revelation the Bible says in second Timothy 3 5 I don't have time to read the whole scripture but it says they then this hour we're living in a Peerless times men would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof but the Bible said like this they'll preach the blood they preach the sacrifice and they preach all the fundamentals of the scripture but they leave out the new birth and they'll call the new birth for being born again as you just sign your name to a book or you accept Jesus Christ as your savior hey that's a start but when he comes in he wants to be Lord not your savior but he wants to be Lord of your life Hallelujah I thank God for salvation I fellowship with anybody on salvation the job Barbershop wherever more hey we'll Fellowship on that but I also know there's a deeper walk it may not be a deeper walk for them but I'm encouraging and knowing this right here that when I went a church or anybody says hey this is where it's all at and this is no there is there is a further walk with God and God's desire is for himself to Tabernacle inside of you I don't believe that's necessary is that Pride or humility as I'm based on my thoughts it's based on the word of God is that right remember God will resist the proud Hallelujah now notice this is to me is one incredible in verse six where it says for this sort they are they which creep into houses and Lead captives silly women not Holy Ghost Field silly women Laden with sins LED away with diverse lusts in other words they're just looking for something that will allow them to feel religious and still have all of this in their life coverings ever learning to me when I read this scripture scripts what a sad What a Sad condition ever learning learning you know the Bible said in Daniel in the last days that knowledge would increase ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth I tell you when I read that it makes me thankful for the grace of God it makes me thankful for God's grace not just not just say Lord oh my all that he's shown us but yes all that he has shown about what he's done in her life to where the very desire of our life beats for him not just show up on a church service but our life is him and him alone notice brother Brown would say it like this here in another place in the message he said Cain's children became intellectual religious because their father was intellectual Cain religious and Cain built an altar Abel built on altar Cain made an offering Abel made an offering Cain worshiped Abel worshiped and if God only respects a church its order its worship its offerings and so forth if that's all God respects he was unjust for condemning Cain because he was just as religious as Abel was but he didn't come the right way so what Paul said if a man Strife he has to strive lawfully in order to be crowned right I mean you don't you don't get up and sign you know when we used to have field day back in when I was in elementary school that's where you signed up for all them races you know and things like that are carrying an egg on a teaspoon or you know the the potato sack race or whatever it was they called it you know all those things you know and you get them ribbons and you know the ribbons and make people feel good and everything else and here you got first place you were dead last but your first place in my mind and all those things you know that goes along just like that but notice if you were running that race you could not just cut across the track and come to the finish line and say hey I made first place you're disqualified and unless you come God's provided way you'll be disqualified at the end Nathaniel would god really do that yes he said he'll do that to even people who preach in His Name Lord did I not cast out Devils did we not preach in your name didn't I do this yes but depart from me you workers of iniquity I never even knew you oh dear God let me close here you're in the message I'm going to see what message power transformation Cain was such a person religious indeed but it had the wrong seed in him see therefore it brought forth the serpent seed Satan had hissed over this seed of Eden and that's what brought forth a cane he put his poison upon how many know the scripture tells us that Cain in the Book of John was of that Wicked one Adam wasn't Wicked in the book of Jude it says Enoch VII from Adam Enoch couldn't have been the seventh if Cain was from Adam he would have been the eighth right notice Cain knew listen to this now Caine knew the perfect will of God he knew the perfect will of God Cain knew it but he refused to do it he proved then to be the serpent seat when he seen the perfect will of God he refused it he had seen God vindicate Abel's message he noted it was the will of God he's seen God vindicate Abel's message and what did God say to him he said do the same do worship like your brother and you'll do well you think about this it would not have changed Cain of who he was but Cain God's not asking to be a per impersonator but Cain if you don't understand it you know I have Vindicated it because you have been upset that I didn't vindicate yours but if you will do as Abel is doing though you may not understand it I still accept you sure oh God think about it what an opportunity God wasn't playing around with Cain he would have accepted him but Cain was unable to Humble himself as a matter of fact Cain's attitude was you either take what I bring you or forget it I think about brother Bram tells us in the church age book he said we never even see this type of interaction between Satan and God himself yeah that's good he said here Cain withstood God in a way we've never seen before but you see he's seen the perfect will of God but he didn't want to do it he wanted to add something to it and these theologians see this Bible let me tell you something friends this message has not been done in a corner as a matter of fact many of them you watch some of the phrases and terminologies and things they have let me tell you something Billy Graham had every one of these messages in his study Billy Graham wasn't was a messenger we understand that by the scripture a messenger to that church right same way Oral Roberts was to the Pentecostals brother Ram called him messages of God's mercy but he said we've got a different message we've got a message where there was one who stayed back with Abraham while the two angels went down to Sodom right we have received a message of rapturing Grace a message that will bring Christ preeminent not just before our Pandora but inside our teenage the same God who speaks to us will return and visit according to what he has said over our lives yeah you will think of this it's not been done in a corner this is known but see it's been Vindicated men have witnessed this word they have witnessed God showing up even so much look at these statements T Osborne said we had forgot what we had forgotten what Jesus was like but God made himself known once again in this generation not the flesh but the same Jesus revealing himself to be the mighty conqueror night after night after night not just in signs and wonders but also when we're revealing of his word this ministry friends I just have to say it this ministry was not of I think somebody out there has got a headache duh who doesn't I don't mean to be make a lot of anything but this was not a hit and miss let me tell you something what it was about was that you and I that we might recognize who it is that's in our midst there were many people that were enthrilled with the Miracles with the signs and wonders so much so they wanted brother Branham to come but they had made a request if you'll just compromise on your Doctrine don't go to preaching this you don't have to preach this they were not concerned with the word whatsoever they wanted vicious and loads right yeah they were willing to Humble themselves to invite him in for that of a healing meeting but aren't you glad that there came a healing that was greater than just the healing of our bodies the son of righteousness the same Holy Ghost has arose in the evening time with healing in his wings to bring healing in the lives of his people let me try to finish this he says theologians see this Bible they read it they don't know what to do it shows the serpent seed they have seen the Vindicated so simply before the people but it seems like it's so hard for people to Humble themselves to the word of God then he says don't you all find when you're talking you women talking to the sisters don't you find it when you're talking to girls about wearing long hair and they say why you got long hair why your hair long why do you wear your skirts down long like that why do you go to talking to them they kind of give you the shoulder oh brother Samuel that's because our church does it that's not why it's the word of God God permits me in coming Services we'll just dive into that it's God's word amen that's why when people want to walk away from the message remember the first things they do is they want to take off the skirts and put on the britches they want to cut their hair listen god brother Branham never came up with Holiness that was already in the word the church fell from it well I think they look good that way that's because you are unconverted and you need a conversion in your own heart and let God take that lust spirit away from that [Music] what bank puts their gold out on display tell me when you're going for a loan did you see their gold do you see it no you don't see it but you borrow based on not the dollars you borrow dollars are made off of gold but you never see the gold that's the same way that God expects in our bodies that's why there's a covering that's given that's why God's laid it out in his word it's a spirit friends notice this don't he says don't you see he says they say they know it's right if there's any lady in them they know that's right but you see they can't humble themselves to it that's see that's what Cain did he couldn't humble himself to the Vindicated word of God he couldn't do it now watch this even the Pentecostals will say glory to God hallelujah I cut my hair and speak in tongues that shows right there something's wrong the seed is bringing forth something different it doesn't matter how much anointing how much spirit I don't care if they speak in tongues and they hit it on the dot every single time if it is against the word in their life it's false what is spoken out that what is spoken out that's no Marvel Balaam himself fell into that and what Balaam said what came out was truth is that right but look at balaam's life it was not a life that was lined up with the word aren't you grateful for the grace of God in this hour because it has been promised false Christ would come in this end time that means false anointed not people walking around with Palestinian garbs on and with you know putting nail prints in their hands but men men those that would be Anointed with the same Spirit but would lead you away from the word aren't you grateful for God's grace in this hour you know what that is God keeping his grace keeping his word his mighty hand to you and I am oh brother REM said a seed cannot a seed of God cannot bring forth a bald-haired woman it can't do it not just can't do it because the Bible said so it can't do it oh he said it seems so hard to Humble to God's word I just say it in this way if there's one thing we can friends to be thankful for is to have a desire that desires to please God if you've got a desire in your heart that desires to please God and say Lord I just want to serve you with all of my heart I want to walk in full obedience to your word just humbling in his presence God doesn't expect you and I to know everything but this is his request will you humble yourself in my presence I want you to remember I'm close I'll close on this on this point there was a man in the scriptures by the name of Naaman how many remember Naaman he was a general there in Syria Mighty Man of Valor the scripture says but he had a secret that nobody else knew but the little Maiden that had been carried captive from Israel she knew he was a leper and you can only keep that secret so long because leprosy will spread and leprosy is sin it'll keep going so the maiden told him said hey go down to Israel there's a prophet down there and that required a lot of humility because he he had been whipping Israel God had delivered Israel into syrian's hand in Syria's hand because Israel was walking in Disobedience Israel wasn't humbling themselves and God speaks to this man and says there's a prophet down here now this man in Syria has a lot of Gods but go down here here's a there's a prophet he comes down to the king the king looks at it can you imagine the king the king looks at himself like why in the world can I help you you know I'm paraphrasing the scripture said the king rent his clothes and said what am I to do my God Elisha heard about it and Elisha aren't you glad Elisha heard how did Elisha here I don't know the scripture don't say that it did it have to be that a messenger ran out of the king's court didn't have to be because remember God had already been shown Elisha before where the Syrian Army was going to be you meet him right here you'll whip him right however it got there and Elisha sent word up there said hey hey tell him to come down here come to come down here so he comes down right there and I wonder how Naaman felt Naaman if I thought here he comes he comes down and Elisha knows he's getting close Elisha sin's word out he don't even go out to greet him he just sends word out he said tell him to go down to Jordan and dip seven times and he will be every wit made whole and name it God well he's Disturbed I am Naaman he didn't even come out this is what the scripture said I thought he would at least come out you see sometimes our thoughts can get in the way of humility because it ain't coming the way that we think it ought to come I think it should come this way I think I should feel this I think I just humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God knows what he's doing this guy got mad I'll tell you you talking about Grace he got mad the Bible said he was mad and one of his servants real small guy may not been a short guy but he's a small guy because he was a servant it don't don't even know his name but he had some words of wisdom see it took something very small to speak to somebody who was being very big and said hey wait a minute if he asked you to do something real great Naaman said but what about these other rivers I mean I can go over to this River I can go over the Baptist River I can go to the Pentecostal River I can go to the Methodist River come on God's gave you all those other gates to tempt you is that what it said in the book of Deuteronomy gave all them other gates to tempt you but there's one gate where he's chose to place his name there's one place God placed his name in Christ his life is that right he placed it in his word Naaman said no that little guy I don't know friends tell me they didn't have one the courage of God for that servant to speak up to his master it was God aren't you glad that God has servants aren't you glad that God speaks to us when we get on our high horses about things God will speak to us and say hey wait a minute he said hey if he asked you to do some great big thing you'd have done it all he told you to do he said go down there and dip in the Jordan seven times you'd be you'd be whole what you're fussing about Naaman goes down there I don't know if that's a new Kentucky translation or what but he's going down there to the Jordan and just just dip dip into dip in the water right there he went down there and he dipped into Jordan I wonder when he got up next to it squishy mug dirty water I can't even this ain't like the Bahamas today I can't see my toes you know what it didn't look real appealing and the new birth itself is not something that's pretty it's a death and a dying to self you know where you know the reason he ended up in that water is because the first of all he was willing to receive a word and forsake his thoughts his way and submit to the word of God and he dipped seven times and he came out of there completely why because he humbled himself to the mighty hand of God and God exalted God brought forth a life that was clean a life that was free a life that was full healthy once again grace to the humble I want more grace I want more grace [Applause] I believe there's Grace here this morning whatever your need is I believe that I know there's Grace here this morning whatever your need is maybe it's a habit maybe it's something a besetting sin there's Grace here this morning if you're willing to Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God there's Grace to set the captive free there's Grace that's able to bring Liberty to hearts that are bound there's grace to the humble what do I do just humble yourself don't try to figure it out just give yourself to him surrender your heart to him Surrender Your Life to him oh brother Samuel what about this don't worry don't don't let Satan Satan you you're not going to get in this door you're not going to use my door Pride not gonna do it I'm not gonna do it I want to walk with the Lord I want to walk with him hey man let's bow our heads in a word of Prayer I wonder here this morning how many want to be remembered in prayer but there's in your heart in your life God bless you God bless your hands lives may be a life that it's at a place right now maybe you're at a junction you're at a point you're at a place you need God to move you you need a miracle you need God to move in a special way let me tell you something God still Specializes in freeing the captives God Specializes in Healing The Sick God Specializes in filling his children with his life don't let Satan put off at everything all it's everything in your life has been failures remember everything that we try to do it does in our own selves and we rely upon that that is a failure and God allows it to come to that place not to disappoint us but to cause us to come to a spot to look up and realize I need something more I need I need I need him maybe all you've known is religion all you've known is churches but I'm going to ask you this morning have you ever met him this I mean I've worshiped I've made an altar I've come to church but I'm asking you have you ever met him I shook hands with a preacher that's not what I'm asking you Cain did all of that but have you met him do you know him in the power of his resurrection have you repented of your sins have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed oh I tell you his grace is sufficient it's grace to the humble but he did say he'd resist the proud I'd say right here this morning there wasn't what an opportunity that God has moved right down to our doorstep once again let's not let this moment go by let's not let this moment go by let's Let The Mighty God take a hold whatever your need is whatever the situation friends were here we've come to have a meeting with God God knows God can take the things like brother Joshua Joshua he testified here this morning even things in your life circumstances that maybe have taken the wind out of yourselves but there's a God I want you to know he cares for you he's mindful of you why don't you just cast your cares on him you know you know he made a way through Calvary that you could actually care he made a way that you could care what do you mean to care brother Samuel to where your heart is moved to say Lord I need you I want you Lord he made a way through Calvary that you could care otherwise you wouldn't care it's Grace to the humble I say this morning I not only have received that Grace but I want more and if I could say it the right way it was his grace that allowed me to receive that Grace that's what it was if I could say it even in this measure it was his grace that received me I was like that one you were like that one the prodigal was in a pig pen a shameful condition if I could just get back home to my father's house something had changed it was no longer a proud proud young man that he had become a humble young man that was willing whatever it takes to get back to Father's house how about it this morning whatever it takes to get back to the Lord Jesus whatever it takes to get back home and he made his way back home the father met him he met him welcomed him back that's the same Grace right here that comes to receive you to take control of your life of your heart to do for you what you can't do no program can change your life no book can change your life only Jesus Christ can change your life [Music] as our heads are bowed and our eyes are Clovis would there be one that want to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior and God bless you one that would want to make him say Lord forgive me of my sins I want to accept you as my savior I want to receive that pardon right here this morning Hallelujah let's pray [Music] Lord Jesus [Music] sometimes the Lord how strange it may seem to us the Lord right in stride with you you're mindful Lord so mindful of every one of our needs Lord there's not a one of us here that's gathered this morning that Lord God would be able to say that we don't need more grace because we do need it Lord every one of us need it here Lord Lord lives Lord in needs of different different measures different parts Lord lives Lord just as we lord mentioned here earlier there's hearts Lord God for you to touch Lord have responded Lord God that you Lord Jesus [Music] what God would be their savior Lord this is their desire Lord to walk to put their life into your hands Lord to Humble themselves in

higher than mine it's right and mine are wrong forgive me Lord I Place Lord my life under your hands the Lord I'm willing to come under that Lord God under the word under the Holy Spirit the leading

truth but she said Master she said but the dogs they take the crumbs from the master's table she humbled herself underneath the word and he said for this saying that which was upon your daughter has left for this sake brother Brown goes on to say he says whether your healing comes like this or it's gradual it's on its way [Music] it's on its way we're going to worship [Music] that's a time of humbling ourselves we're not looking for a feeling we're not looking for a sensation we're looking for the evidence and the evidence of God is indisputable you might feel it there might be sensation but there might not but I guarantee probably some way or another when you do see it you'll be a little happy you'll be a little thankful people know about it the main thing is what it is you'll be
