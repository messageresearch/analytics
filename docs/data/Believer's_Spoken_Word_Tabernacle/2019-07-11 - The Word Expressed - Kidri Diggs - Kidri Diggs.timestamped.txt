[48:03] saints of God that come from far and

[48:14] Lord will have communion with our mighty
[48:16] God tonight Lord that no circumstance no
[48:19] situation I'll be able to stand before

[48:34] Christ we pray in the church say Amen
[48:37] church say Amen again hallelujah if you
[48:41] have your Bibles let's go to the Book of
[48:43] Isaiah 55
[48:47] you know and I'm uh I'm probably not
[48:50] gonna say anything that you haven't
[48:52] already heard but that doesn't mean that
[48:56] it's not meant for the service you know
[49:00] cuz sometimes we can hear things and we
[49:03] were like well I heard that before and
[49:05] we don't take it with a sense of urgency
[49:07] so let's not do that listeners let's say
[49:11] that whatever said tonight is for me
[49:14] amen
[49:15] this doll is for me Isaiah 55 and let's
[49:21] um let's start at first six you have a
[49:35] say man the Bible says seek the Lord
[49:38] while he may be found call ye upon him
[49:42] while he is near let the wicked forsake
[49:45] his way and the unrighteous man his
[49:48] thoughts and let him return unto the
[49:52] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[49:55] to our God for he will abundantly pardon
[50:00] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[50:02] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[50:07] LORD now you notice that didn't say said
[50:10] Isaiah he said saith the Lord hallelujah
[50:14] so Isaiah is speaking first person on
[50:18] the behalf of God the Bible says for as
[50:22] the heavens are higher than the earth so
[50:26] are my ways higher than your ways and my
[50:29] thoughts than your thoughts for as the
[50:31] rain coming down in the snow from heaven
[50:33] and return if not tiller but water of
[50:36] the earth and making it to bring forth
[50:38] and bud then it may give seed to the
[50:41] sower and bread to the eater so shall my
[50:45] word be that goeth forth out of my mouth
[50:49] now before I go any further look at what
[50:52] I said type that verse of scripture when
[50:55] he said he said the word coming forth is
[50:58] just like the rain coming
[51:00] and when the rain comes down it comes
[51:03] out with a purpose to bless the seed it
[51:06] comes down with a purpose that whatever
[51:08] it falls on that that life might come
[51:11] for so the rain coming forth has a
[51:15] purpose to deal with that seed life and
[51:18] he said so is the Word of God will it
[51:21] come forth there's a purpose behind it
[51:24] hallelujah so share the word that goeth
[51:27] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[51:29] return Oh youyou unto me void the rain
[51:33] doesn't go back up in the sky neither
[51:35] does the snow gap go back up in the sky
[51:37] but it has to accomplish the reason why
[51:40] it fall hallelujah he said in its shell
[51:45] he said it must accomplish that which is
[51:47] prosper and it shipped it must and it
[51:51] shall accomplish that which I please and
[51:54] it shall prosper in the thing whereto I
[51:57] sent it hurry let's go to st. John 10
[52:02] st. John
[52:03] Jim chapter
[52:19] st. John 10 and I just want to read off
[52:23] let's go to verse 34 and then we're
[52:28] gonna read Malachi 3 and you can have
[52:30] your seat st. John 10 verse 34 the bible
[52:35] says jesus answered them is it not
[52:37] written in your law I said Ye are gods
[52:41] if he called them gods unto whom the
[52:44] Word of God came has the word come to us
[52:50] somebody talk to me has the word come to
[52:54] us we have the word a man we have the
[52:57] unleavened bread of God and now the
[52:59] Bible is backing it up by Jesus Christ
[53:02] he said that the Word of God came to
[53:04] they have called you gods
[53:09] oh my isn't that wonderful
[53:13] if if he calls them gods unto whom the
[53:18] Word of God came and the scripture
[53:21] cannot be broken hallelujah
[53:24] say of him whom the father hath
[53:27] sanctified and sent in the world that
[53:29] blessings because I said I am the son of
[53:32] God if they're not yet the works of my
[53:35] father believe me neither I do not the
[53:36] works of my father believe me not a man
[53:39] Malachi 3
[53:40] and I was worried verse 6
[53:44] Malachi 3 and verse 6
[53:48] oh my you know just see a scripture and
[53:55] get excited about it
[53:58] hallelujah if you go on through anything
[54:01] tonight I want you to put your trouble
[54:04] in this verse Malachi 3 and verse 6 put
[54:08] your situation in this verse verse 6 the
[54:12] Bible says for I am the Lord I changed
[54:15] not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not
[54:18] consumed they made a lot of blessing of
[54:21] his word you can have your seats
[54:31] amen by the grace of God I want a
[54:36] youthful subject tonight
[54:40] the word expressed but my inspiration
[54:45] for the stock is is in the form of
[54:47] another statement God's thought process
[54:52] you know if you think about it Church
[54:55] what what would it mean to you and I if
[54:59] we could just see what God was thinking
[55:02] you know right now in the service if we
[55:05] could just know what God was thinking
[55:08] about and we knew this thought process
[55:10] if we do what was on God's mind you know
[55:14] Church I'm gonna make that very clear
[55:16] tonight we already know we already know
[55:22] what God is speaking because we have his
[55:24] word God doesn't think outside of his
[55:28] word because the prophet of God says God
[55:32] is perfect so when he he wrote the word
[55:35] or he spoke the word that was it he
[55:39] doesn't come back and add more to what
[55:41] he had already had to say God doesn't
[55:44] grow in knowledge and wisdom
[55:46] hallelujah what he said it was perfect
[55:49] he don't have to come back and say oh I
[55:52] left out something for my brother's
[55:54] trial I left out something for his trial
[55:56] no he gave enough in his word with he
[55:59] spoke in the first time so gosh Oh
[56:02] church we have what God would think
[56:05] about in every situation we go through
[56:08] right here all you gotta do is find out
[56:11] your situation according to this Bible
[56:14] and you know how to move
[56:16] hallelujah but church when we look at it
[56:19] and we'll just think about God's thought
[56:21] process and what it means to have the
[56:24] expression of God's Word now we know
[56:26] that the prophet of God said that a word
[56:29] is a thought expressed but before it got
[56:33] you a word it was on God's mind haruya
[56:36] now listen let's go before there was
[56:39] ever anything cream
[56:41] and let's just look that God was just
[56:43] there all by himself and we know that
[56:45] the Prophet said before then he was just
[56:47] God eternal hurry he was just there
[56:51] holding all space by himself you know
[56:53] it's crazy to me that we have people on
[56:56] the earth that don't believe that
[56:58] there's a God he's done too much to
[57:03] prove that he is a god oh yeah I can't
[57:08] speak for nobody else's life but I can
[57:11] talk about what he's done for me
[57:12] hallelujah and he's been good to me he's
[57:16] revealed perlier himself to me in a
[57:19] mighty way he's done things that I
[57:21] couldn't do my own my job couldn't do my
[57:24] mother couldn't do my family couldn't do
[57:26] but God did hallelujah so it baffles me
[57:34] when people haven't they've been
[57:37] deceived to say that you know all of
[57:40] this was created by a big bang church
[57:45] we're constantly having big bangs and
[57:48] earthquakes in and volcano eruptions and
[57:50] all these things but nothing else is
[57:52] being created from it oh yeah
[57:56] so where do they come off saying that in
[57:59] this space of time that there was a big
[58:02] old boom and all this came forward
[58:07] ridiculous no that was an eternal God
[58:12] hallelujah who had some things on his
[58:15] mind
[58:16] oh yeah he was sitting in heaven huh and
[58:19] he said you know I could just see it
[58:21] turn I just see God sitting in heaven in
[58:24] space holding all space in time all by
[58:27] himself and then God began to think
[58:29] table begin to say to himself right
[58:32] there in that moment God had sauce that
[58:34] holy God looked at it he said you know
[58:37] what there's not enough of me that's
[58:39] being revealed think about that church
[58:44] God began to look at all the earth and
[58:47] creation or even space just eternity and
[58:50] God is saying there's not enough of me
[58:53] on this plane listen to the stops how do
[58:57] you God knew that he was more than just
[59:00] eternal so God is now gonna take
[59:04] hallelujah the whole world the whole
[59:06] earth through the process of what he's
[59:09] thinking
[59:11] hallelujah so God so God is sitting
[59:16] there holding on space and time and God
[59:18] is saying you know what
[59:19] yeah I'm eternal but that's not that's
[59:21] not all of me he said you do what i'ma
[59:24] savior hallelujah but there was nothing
[59:31] else then these are God's taught for us
[59:33] so God said you know what I'm allowed
[59:36] something to be created that can be lost
[59:38] so I can demonstrate myself but even in
[59:45] that hurry
[59:45] God wouldn't satisfy consonants deal
[59:48] more to me to be revealed he said you
[59:51] know what I'm a deliverer so God had to
[59:53] let something get bound Wow
[1:00:01] so his thoughts could leave his mind
[1:00:04] earlier and move into an expression
[1:00:07] moving through a manifestation God had
[1:00:10] thoughts God sitting there and God's
[1:00:12] thought says he's thinking now God said
[1:00:14] you know what my thoughts are no good to
[1:00:16] myself because it is mine nobody knew
[1:00:24] what it was
[1:00:27] it would just be thoughts and I want to
[1:00:31] make this very simple
[1:00:32] what good are your thoughts just alone
[1:00:34] in your mind church we never hung Liu
[1:00:38] you know that we could fly in an
[1:00:41] airplane if the top brothers that is if
[1:00:44] the white the Wright brothers didn't put
[1:00:46] their souls into action
[1:00:48] hurry if their cells didn't become a
[1:00:50] word a word Express so when you see a
[1:00:58] 747 it's the south of the Wright
[1:01:00] brothers Haru you somebody caught their
[1:01:06] inspiration in hand and they taught what
[1:01:08] the Wright brothers was thinking about
[1:01:09] it hurry and they tapped into the same
[1:01:12] mind not a different mind but the same
[1:01:15] mind that's what Jesus said let this
[1:01:18] mind be in you that was also in Christ
[1:01:20] Church if you can pick up God's thoughts
[1:01:25] you can find yourself holier manifesting
[1:01:28] actions of a God you know if I can let's
[1:01:40] go back to what brother Samuel saying
[1:01:41] we're so spoiled think about
[1:01:48] denominations don't know what we know
[1:01:52] they'll sing songs about it i believe i
[1:01:57] can fly i believe i touch the sky i
[1:02:03] think about it every night and day
[1:02:05] spread my wings and just fly away i
[1:02:12] believe i can so see they can sing about
[1:02:18] it they can catch the inspiration but we
[1:02:20] believe it's going to happen
[1:02:23] [Music]
[1:02:24] holy we're not flying as angels no we're
[1:02:28] gonna be translated and sons and
[1:02:30] daughters of god
[1:02:31] hurry so this dimension can't hold us
[1:02:34] why because we're made up of a material
[1:02:36] hallelujah that cannot return to god
[1:02:39] void because the Word of God cannot
[1:02:45] return to God boy hurry up and read make
[1:02:48] up that part of God which is the word
[1:02:50] made manifest but you know what we've
[1:02:54] heard so much and we hid things like
[1:02:56] this it don't even excite us I just told
[1:03:01] you you can fly and we sit there like in
[1:03:04] an airplane Oh what is it the Delta 88
[1:03:09] no I'm talking about in the dimensions
[1:03:12] of God oh yeah I don't know about you
[1:03:17] but I think about it every night and day
[1:03:20] and you know what I'm not looking to
[1:03:23] spread wings because they I'm not an
[1:03:25] angel honey I'm a son I'm not gonna need
[1:03:28] no wings huh huh
[1:03:30] the Bible said that I'm a god holy we
[1:03:33] look at one place where God hasn't have
[1:03:35] wings to step into other dimension oh
[1:03:40] let me excite you a little bit Church
[1:03:43] Holy Angels higher you can't sing songs
[1:03:46] you can sing they feel out of place when
[1:03:49] you worship
[1:03:52] hey man you seem so today that my god is
[1:03:56] awesome they don't know what it's like
[1:03:58] hurry to internship failure and then see
[1:04:01] a mighty God come in and show its
[1:04:04] awesomeness angels don't know nothing
[1:04:07] about that you know I know you sing the
[1:04:17] song here but you catch the inspiration
[1:04:19] in your mind you know in your thought
[1:04:21] process when you're going through
[1:04:23] something and maybe a song comes we make
[1:04:27] miracle work promise keep light in the
[1:04:31] darkness my god
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:38] angels don't think they've never seen
[1:04:45] God as a waymaker holy when they look at
[1:04:49] God all they see is holy holy holy Lord
[1:04:52] God Almighty holy holy holy Lord God
[1:04:55] Almighty but we because of our thought
[1:04:58] process we not only see him as holy but
[1:05:01] we see him as my key
[1:05:02] wonderful counselor Prince of Peace
[1:05:06] that's how we think about our jihad I
[1:05:11] think about him as a way makers and the
[1:05:14] prophet of God said o my church the
[1:05:17] prophet of God said if God ever told you
[1:05:20] something he has to make a way forward
[1:05:22] to come to pass oh but listen God was in
[1:05:33] his eternal space having a thought and I
[1:05:36] want you to catch that all God's
[1:05:38] thoughts were concerning you because he
[1:05:42] could've just stayed up there all by
[1:05:44] himself
[1:05:44] eternal that would have just been for
[1:05:46] him but he had thoughts of time and
[1:05:49] process concerning you hurly thoughts of
[1:05:52] time that would say hurry up there's

[1:06:24] the process of his mind that he's a
[1:06:26] healer hallelujah
[1:06:28] she Harley he knew Harley that he was
[1:06:31] the logos hello him you self existed
[1:06:34] he was eternal but he also knew that he
[1:06:36] was this great healer now when a Bible
[1:06:38] says I'm the Lord and I changed that I'm

[1:07:31] from what he was thinking he was making
[1:07:33] the devil mine fall subject to the way
[1:07:36] that God would move Oh churches we

[1:07:45] he knew all these things are gonna
[1:07:46] happen so God said you know what I have

[1:07:52] but in God's thought process what I want
[1:07:55] you to understand see I want you to come

[1:08:39] God in his mind in God listen why how
[1:08:42] God thinks in his mind God is saying
[1:08:45] before he ever made this was written
[1:08:47] down God said that I'm unstoppable
[1:08:50] I think I got across to preach up in
[1:08:57] here y'all don't hear me I said my god
[1:09:02] I said my god he's unstoppable
[1:09:05] unstoppable my god in his mind
[1:09:13] hallelujah he believes her that he was
[1:09:17] unstoppable
[1:09:18] so he believed it he's spoken and once
[1:09:23] he spoke in her ear it came to us holy
[1:09:26] now is mine cuz God can't take it back
[1:09:29] hallelujah so I got a right to say to
[1:09:31] every sickness every trial every
[1:09:33] tribulation that my god is unstoppable
[1:09:40] unstoppable Oh Sheikh Abu he loud Paul
[1:09:56] under the inspiration to say who shall
[1:10:00] separate you from the love of God before
[1:10:04] I go any further I want you to catch the
[1:10:06] text as a process of the word listen the
[1:10:11] scripture says in 2nd Timothy 3 all
[1:10:16] Scripture is given by inspiration so
[1:10:23] let's go out the window
[1:10:24] Oh Isaiah wrote Oh John Matthew wrote Oh
[1:10:30] Scripture is given by inspiration
[1:10:34] oh well you know Moses say that Oh
[1:10:38] Scripture
[1:10:40] you say old Timothy oh scripture was
[1:10:49] given my god
[1:10:50] but listen why he gave it oh yeah
[1:10:54] because the scripture heard the
[1:10:57] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[1:11:02] doctrine for reproof for correction for
[1:11:08] instruction in righteousness huh
[1:11:11] so the scripture hallelujah is there to
[1:11:14] make us perfect hallelujah that's why
[1:11:18] God expressed his word he expressed that
[1:11:21] whenever we read we got a right to
[1:11:24] believe that it'll do what it says now
[1:11:30] if yo if God has ever failed you what I
[1:11:34] want you to do I want you to get up and
[1:11:37] leave this building because you holding
[1:11:38] us up
[1:11:41] I want you to get up and leave no
[1:11:43] disrespect to you hallelujah but if you
[1:11:46] if you feel like God has failed you I
[1:11:48] want you to get up and leave
[1:11:51] because the Bible says he cannot fail I
[1:12:00] just preached a message on the character
[1:12:02] of God and what I did was I came out of
[1:12:06] Corinthians 13 dealing with love and the
[1:12:10] way it came about me and my daughter was
[1:12:11] sitting in the living room and she was
[1:12:13] reading and I don't know what she was
[1:12:15] doing was almost like she was studying
[1:12:16] because she was reading something and
[1:12:18] she came across this quote and the quote
[1:12:21] that was love it said that God he said
[1:12:25] that love never felt it I want you to
[1:12:28] catch this church calculate man love
[1:12:31] never felt and we know that God is love
[1:12:34] and then the quote said hallelujah
[1:12:36] love never faileth so if it fails that
[1:12:40] mean it was never God so you believe in
[1:12:48] something and it fails that mean it was
[1:12:50] never God in the first place because God
[1:12:53] never felt it honey
[1:12:55] since that's his expression amen the
[1:12:59] expression of God holy God knows no
[1:13:02] defeat there's nobody on the planet
[1:13:05] nobody in space nobody in the history
[1:13:08] that can ever say they got the best of
[1:13:11] God no you know what I'm doing tonight
[1:13:16] I'm talking about your God the one you
[1:13:23] serve the one that this message
[1:13:25] hallelujah brought us back to her took
[1:13:28] us away from armed religion and and
[1:13:32] seats and windows and all that stuff but
[1:13:34] brought us back to the mind of God and
[1:13:37] that's what we are when you read this
[1:13:39] Bible you're looking at God's thoughts
[1:13:41] concerning the matters of your life her
[1:13:45] Leah
[1:13:48] listen I wanna read something to you now
[1:13:52] to catch what I'm saying you got to have
[1:13:57] a revelation of God that's why when
[1:14:00] Jesus Jesus walked to the disciples he
[1:14:03] says who do men say they said this they
[1:14:07] said that some say John some say
[1:14:08] Jeremiah some say life and then Jesus
[1:14:10] narrowed it down he says who do you say
[1:14:15] see God always wants to know what's on
[1:14:17] your mind
[1:14:18] because what's on your mind you're gonna
[1:14:21] speak you know God always puts us in
[1:14:26] position for the real you to be on
[1:14:29] display cuz we can fake each other out
[1:14:32] we can come to church dress nice do all
[1:14:34] the stuff but what comes out of your
[1:14:35] mouth when you go through a trial that's
[1:14:39] who you really are when you're the trial
[1:14:42] oh god I thought I had the whole ego ha
[1:14:45] I'm fat
[1:14:49] that's what you really are a crybaby
[1:14:54] - y'all know God Hey - God don't like
[1:14:59] crybabies listen we got we got a message
[1:15:03] on this call why cry speak how do you
[1:15:06] Moses it looked like he was justified
[1:15:08] look like he had a right running the gun
[1:15:10] cuz it's big old see standing in front
[1:15:12] of him but then he runs to God he says
[1:15:14] all about what we gonna do just see
[1:15:17] gossipy shut up Moses stop cryin to me
[1:15:24] haven't I been with you all this time
[1:15:27] haven't I done signs and wonders
[1:15:29] better yet listen to God's mine Moses he
[1:15:32] comes forward and Moses he comes God
[1:15:34] says I've heard the cry of my people and
[1:15:37] I've come down huh
[1:15:39] Brahma sending you so where was God he
[1:15:41] stepped in Moses body see God's mind
[1:15:45] said hallelujah he can do it himself but
[1:15:47] he rather do it through you because
[1:15:53] that's gonna build up your confidence
[1:15:55] think about the church to realize in a
[1:15:58] situation or in a matter in a child that
[1:16:01] God is living inside of you God hariya
[1:16:05] is performing or defeating the battle
[1:16:08] because he's in you listen
[1:16:17] he tells Moses Moses Moses starts to cry
[1:16:20] listen to Moses thoughts listen to his
[1:16:22] thinking oh god I can't talk
[1:16:27] Oh God who should I say they send me oh
[1:16:31] god I did this Oh God
[1:16:33] God says shut up and then God says who
[1:16:39] made your mouth see you know what you
[1:16:43] know what God does honey right what God
[1:16:47] does he's talking to you and you can't
[1:16:51] believe that you belong on that place
[1:16:52] where he's at so what God does he never
[1:16:55] leaves you there he wants you to know
[1:16:57] where you belong
[1:16:58] so what he does he talked to you and
[1:17:00] talk to you until you get to a place to
[1:17:02] where you make a step to come up where
[1:17:07] he is
[1:17:08] that's God's whole thought process not
[1:17:11] to leave you down there but to show you
[1:17:13] you belong right beside him better yet
[1:17:17] he said I not only be with you but I'll
[1:17:20] be in you oh yeah thank you brother
[1:17:22] hallelujah see that's God's old mindset
[1:17:25] he can easily do it on his own but he
[1:17:28] wants to do it through you that's why he
[1:17:30] created us earlier while he created Adam
[1:17:33] and Eve because he wanted somebody there
[1:17:35] on the earth that represented him oh
[1:17:38] yeah the animals huh didn't represent
[1:17:42] him earlier oh hey honey
[1:17:44] it was a tight there was a shadow but it
[1:17:47] wasn't his image
[1:17:48] read your Bible hallelujah the animals
[1:17:50] wasn't created in His image Halle the
[1:17:52] mineral creation wasn't in his image
[1:17:54] hallelujah but then he made a man and he
[1:17:57] saw his refraction you a regenerated son
[1:18:06] and daughter of God is this thing God
[1:18:10] was thinking from the beginning his
[1:18:13] likeness this image oh yeah that's what
[1:18:17] he wants us to see ourselves amen
[1:18:19] now in order for you to see yourself
[1:18:21] like that you got to see who God is
[1:18:25] and God never fails God never lies God
[1:18:34] never worries Oh God thought processes I
[1:18:42] got to stop high blood pressure
[1:18:45] I got to stop stress I got to stop all
[1:18:50] these sicknesses that's that step that's
[1:18:52] coming in the body how am I gonna stop
[1:18:54] it by me living in them by the baptism
[1:18:57] of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost can
[1:19:03] stop any sickness you can stop any doubt
[1:19:05] you can stop any fever
[1:19:08] hallelujah do you stop anything that
[1:19:10] doesn't represent what God is already
[1:19:12] spoken hello oh my
[1:19:20] do you serve that God do you serve a god
[1:19:24] well you can say right now in your seat
[1:19:27] that in my situation all things are
[1:19:30] possible
[1:19:32] [Applause]
[1:19:36] let's read a little bit
[1:19:40] we almost there see what I'm doing right
[1:19:44] now I'm fighting through the atmospheres
[1:19:46] of knowledge those of you who got this
[1:19:52] message and you know it and you
[1:19:53] examining everything I said about what
[1:19:55] you've studied
[1:19:57] remember the Word of God hallelujah is
[1:20:01] given for purpose earlier
[1:20:05] God gave preachers for purpose don't
[1:20:10] give a for ministry for a purpose
[1:20:13] and one thing I realized especially
[1:20:15] brothers brothers can look at one
[1:20:17] another and be like well brother I
[1:20:18] already know that but one thing you
[1:20:20] might be missing is the gifts you might
[1:20:26] know it but do you have the gift we
[1:20:32] almost never see one thing about God God
[1:20:37] knows everything you're gonna go through
[1:20:40] so he allowed certain things to arise
[1:20:43] not only for that moment but for things
[1:20:46] to come
[1:20:48] she didn't God's process he said I need
[1:20:51] a man after my very own heart and just
[1:20:54] notice he chose a little boy a little
[1:20:57] boy named David who was very
[1:21:00] insignificant you know yet I believe six
[1:21:03] other brothers you know and they were
[1:21:04] tall and smart and probably wise and and
[1:21:08] looked like they were Kings but when God
[1:21:11] came holy his thought process is he
[1:21:14] wanted a man holy they had two good
[1:21:17] qualities one good quality that David
[1:21:20] had it was easy for him to repent see
[1:21:27] God didn't choose a man that would be
[1:21:29] easily hardened hi honey
[1:21:32] he chose a man that was wrong he will
[1:21:35] say Lord forgive me and let me suck
[1:21:39] Church that's why he told you
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:46] that's what makes us brides because we
[1:21:50] have an ability to repent oh that's why
[1:21:55] Cain was not out of Sun honey because he
[1:21:58] couldn't repent he couldn't see his
[1:22:02] thinking was completely against how God
[1:22:05] would think and instead of saying Lord
[1:22:06] I'm sorry help me to grow he got angry
[1:22:13] because God didn't do his way but look
[1:22:18] every time David was shows his faults
[1:22:20] what did he do quickly quickly second
[1:22:28] thing about David there was no
[1:22:30] compromise when it came to his God's
[1:22:33] ways see I appreciate Solomon but it was
[1:22:39] a different book David and Solomon
[1:22:41] Solomon was like uh-uh what you would
[1:22:45] call a wise man he was a wise man but
[1:22:49] Solomon was like if there is a if there
[1:22:51] is a hostage situation you know and all
[1:22:54] of us a hostage Solomon would come in
[1:22:57] and negotiate he'd come in he said well
[1:23:00] you know I give you this if you kiss me
[1:23:02] that remember you had a thousand wives
[1:23:03] so he was good at it God builds him with
[1:23:09] a mind of wisdom to be able to negotiate
[1:23:11] and process things so Solomon he'd get
[1:23:14] in such situation he creates treaties
[1:23:16] and peace treaties and do all these
[1:23:18] things and for the sake of saying God
[1:23:20] was leading him and no doubt God was
[1:23:22] leading him he was one of the wisest men
[1:23:24] on the face of the earth but David
[1:23:26] wasn't like that Solomon Solomon hostage
[1:23:30] situation Solomon coming in and he want
[1:23:33] to see everybody survive
[1:23:35] David come in David come in and say I
[1:23:38] get you for you get me oh yeah
[1:23:44] David come in said i'ma get the sniper
[1:23:46] and whoever died yeah I hope they life
[1:23:49] right oh yeah
[1:23:54] David didn't come in compromising and I
[1:23:57] always liked the story
[1:23:58] look at his process look at David's mind
[1:24:00] where did it come from
[1:24:02] God he was a man of the God's very own
[1:24:06] heart and the way he thought about
[1:24:09] battle the way he thought about certain
[1:24:10] things was the very way God would react
[1:24:13] in that situation you know first you
[1:24:17] know we are probably with people we see
[1:24:18] somebody dancing the word by the Solomon
[1:24:28] [Applause]
[1:24:32] the word by the Solomon you go to David
[1:24:35] wasn't worried about who thought about
[1:24:36] what kind of dance he was doing even his
[1:24:39] wife gave him backlash did that stop
[1:24:41] David from dancing because his dance was
[1:24:43] unto the revealed word huh why was he
[1:24:47] dancing because in his mind
[1:24:50] wow it is mine he saw victory hallelujah
[1:24:55] his thought process was I need to
[1:24:58] shouting dance because now I got victory
[1:25:00] watch I see the Ark of the Covenant on
[1:25:03] his way back
[1:25:04] [Applause]
[1:25:05] [Music]
[1:25:06] so his thought process hallelujah was
[1:25:09] just like God would think because God
[1:25:11] represented the Ark of the Covenant
[1:25:13] earlier and David knew once this Ark is
[1:25:17] back we are unstoppable
[1:25:19] but his wife looking at it she looking
[1:25:22] at it on the French Oh King Keaney and
[1:25:24] danced out his clothes
[1:25:27] Soloman looking at on the flesh oh I
[1:25:30] wouldn't be that ain't a message dance
[1:25:36] what is the message dance what is the
[1:25:40] message song let me leave it alone fire
[1:25:46] fence some of y'all I know some of y'all
[1:25:49] got your own religion you know got our
[1:25:53] own way hi just how we doing
[1:25:55] don't bring that down south stuff up
[1:25:57] here y'all know in heaven it ain't gonna
[1:26:03] be no longer to the latitude and he
[1:26:06] gonna be no saint from the South same
[1:26:08] something off maybe don't say from
[1:26:11] Africa say from Canada it's gonna be
[1:26:15] holy children of God
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:22] and we gonna be so into and if I break
[1:26:27] it down
[1:26:27] y'all gonna bring it down right with me
[1:26:37] then ain't gonna be no difference in our
[1:26:39] worship it's gonna be all one hot spell
[1:26:43] Jesus Christ I love God worship oh but
[1:26:53] you look at David's mind David had the
[1:26:55] mind of God and what-what-what's was
[1:26:57] strange to me you look at how he how he
[1:26:59] operated how David moved David went to
[1:27:02] neighbor and he came down at David say
[1:27:03] my soldiers are tired all these things
[1:27:05] give us some food and listen to
[1:27:07] neighbors stinking are giving nobody
[1:27:09] nothing i hain't seen David I ain't seen
[1:27:12] nobody I ain't doing none of that it got
[1:27:15] back to David David okay you gonna feed
[1:27:19] us imma kill you your brothers your mama
[1:27:23] your causes imma kill everybody in your
[1:27:26] family everything related to you going
[1:27:31] but I want you to catch the thought
[1:27:33] process of the bride honey he comes
[1:27:36] Abigail oh yeah she heard was neighbor
[1:27:39] heard oh yeah but there was a different
[1:27:41] manifestation behind her actions oh yeah
[1:27:43] because she heard what David said and
[1:27:46] she knew that once that word was spoken
[1:27:48] he cannot return voice and using that
[1:27:54] could change it was a repentant heart
[1:27:57] that's what the prophet of God said in
[1:28:00] spoken words the original seat he said
[1:28:01] your words your thoughts what spoken
[1:28:04] will meet you at the judgement
[1:28:06] he says you said something wrong it'll
[1:28:09] be right there the only thing that
[1:28:10] changes is if you repent before that
[1:28:13] Judgment Day and Abigail comes and she
[1:28:19] meets David has all her hands maids get
[1:28:21] all the food together why what does she
[1:28:23] do
[1:28:23] she tapped into David's thought process
[1:28:27] that's what the bride is able to do
[1:28:29] honey she's able huh - stand back God's
[1:28:33] wrath oh yeah that's why we're still in
[1:28:37] the earth but because we're keeping this
[1:28:39] world from being destroyed because God's
[1:28:42] children is still here on this earth

[1:30:46] but for the sake of it might be somebody
[1:30:48] here not heard i'ma tell you once I hear
[1:30:51] your testimony i'ma tell cuz once it's
[1:30:57] spoken it has to go out and do and
[1:31:00] accomplish why it was spoken it can't
[1:31:04] return the Lord just bringing all kind
[1:31:07] of good stuff it can't return boy there
[1:31:13] was a young man in the Army in the
[1:31:15] military in Africa and he you know was a
[1:31:18] Christian and he had a UH tuna sergeants
[1:31:23] all that stuff and everybody made fun of
[1:31:25] him because he was a Christian you know
[1:31:27] on the daily basis they laugh and play
[1:31:30] jokes and tricks and all that stuff
[1:31:32] and one day they wanted to have a group
[1:31:35] a group joking I can't think the right
[1:31:38] word but they want to do it as a group
[1:31:40] play a big old joke on him so you want
[1:31:44] to make fun of them what we will say
[1:31:45] today bullying and you know church
[1:31:51] the pastor said you know what I'm gonna
[1:31:53] do it not cos I'm sorry the sergeant he
[1:31:56] said you know what I'm gonna do I'm
[1:31:57] gonna give him a fake key to this truck
[1:32:00] and I'm gonna tell him go over there and
[1:32:01] crank it up and we and drive it cross
[1:32:03] over this field and we are gonna have a
[1:32:05] good cuz it's gonna be a fake key and
[1:32:08] then gonna work he's just gonna be
[1:32:09] sitting there doing like this cuz you
[1:32:11] know anything all Christians are
[1:32:12] gullible they think that's why we on the
[1:32:16] job they come to us and say wouldn't you
[1:32:18] like the work some overtime trust me
[1:32:24] when they coming to you that's because
[1:32:26] they can't keep nobody else to do it and
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:32] it's the devil motivate him cuz it's
[1:32:35] normally on your church hours but I
[1:32:38] think you just so gullible enough you
[1:32:41] think you ought to say no I got
[1:32:46] hallelujah God doubts
[1:32:48] he said I'm Jehovah Jireh he's my
[1:32:51] provider honey that's the whole reason
[1:32:54] why God told Abraham to go kill his son
[1:32:58] because he could see God was a provider
[1:33:02] who what came out of that trial
[1:33:06] hallelujah the only thing came out of
[1:33:08] that trial was Abraham raising his hands
[1:33:10] proclaiming that God is over diorama so
[1:33:18] God let us go through things so we can
[1:33:20] catch a revelation and our words can
[1:33:23] become material in that trial
[1:33:30] Abraham huh Leah his words became
[1:33:33] material in that trial why cuz he caught
[1:33:36] the revelation that God will provide you
[1:33:41] sometimes the only reason why you go
[1:33:43] through things is because there's a
[1:33:45] revelation there's a spoken word sitting
[1:33:48] on the back of your toe and you haven't
[1:33:51] thought about speaking it yet so god
[1:33:53] I'll allow you to go through a trial so
[1:33:56] I can come out
[1:33:58] if you don't catch anything I want you
[1:34:00] to catch spoken-word cannot return to
[1:34:04] God fine if it's God speaking to you now
[1:34:09] but this young man this particular day
[1:34:13] sergeant clubs he says he says all son I

[1:50:28] that he would respect because he was a
[1:50:30] wild out teenager and this guy he met
[1:50:32] was a message believer who was a strong
[1:50:34] man this man could cost in competition
[1:50:40] he could drag jeeps down the road
[1:50:42] hallelujah so God's thinking was for me
[1:50:45] to get my seed this young man he has to
[1:50:48] meet somebody that he respects but this
[1:50:50] man is also had the Word of God so he
[1:50:54] meets this man hug not only that he
[1:50:56] falls in love with his stature he fell
[1:50:58] in love with his Christ not as young boy
[1:51:03] who was running but wild found himself
[1:51:05] following a strong man Christian cave is
[1:51:12] like that it seems like that's
[1:51:13] ridiculous but who won't tell God how to
[1:51:15] save his people God know what we're
[1:51:18] thinking
[1:51:18] so God puts the right thing in our path
[1:51:21] to get us to surrender oh yeah I didn't
[1:51:24] need I didn't need a man that can lift
[1:51:27] 400 pounds but this Mandy hallelujah all
[1:51:30] I needed was a tender sweet loving
[1:51:32] mother going down in there praying for
[1:51:34] me every night earlier but this young
[1:51:38] man didn't have that his parents was our
[1:51:41] Christians so god like him to me the
[1:51:43] Christian that was a strong man somebody
[1:51:46] that he would respect earlier he know
[1:51:48] what this young man got seen Holly he
[1:51:51] felt a feeling to the right her your
[1:51:53] channel he started living this message
[1:51:55] and all the stuff now his mother wasn't
[1:51:57] a Christian nor his dad wasn't a
[1:51:59] Christian

[1:52:02] suffered from depression honey

[1:52:15] in the family serving God you imagine
[1:52:18] you young person and you don't want it

[1:52:21] the lead but maybe God won't use you in
[1:52:25] church haruya he comes home and one day

[1:56:03] choked and died when she got back the
[1:56:06] baby was lifeless what's your thought
[1:56:08] process in a moment like that is it
[1:56:11] paranoia or is it that my god is able
[1:56:15] huh see your thought process is gonna
[1:56:18] bring forth the actions next so she said
[1:56:21] she she was looking at her child and she
[1:56:24] was thinking you know somebody else came
[1:56:27] inside we need to call an ambulance call
[1:56:28] damage she said before we called an
[1:56:30] ambulance we gonna bring Holly what are
[1:56:35] you praying nothing don't happen honey
[1:56:37] you'll pray again but this sister she
[1:56:43] took it to another place after she
[1:56:45] prayed hallelujah nothing happened baby
[1:56:48] was dead after she prayed nothing
[1:56:51] happened but then her thought process
[1:56:52] took her to the scripture hallelujah
[1:56:54] when when Lazarus was dead Jesus call
[1:56:57] his name
[1:57:00] [Applause]
[1:57:04] Wow will you go through trials what is
[1:57:08] your thought process hallelujah right
[1:57:11] there let me tell you something church
[1:57:12] if you're in a situation in the Word of
[1:57:15] God comes to your mind God wants you to
[1:57:17] speak that ain't just a good talk he
[1:57:23] wants you to speak that South is coming
[1:57:25] for that moment in church she she prayed
[1:57:29] nothing happened then the scripture
[1:57:31] comes when Jesus calls her name so she
[1:57:34] looks at her child and she says
[1:57:35] Elizabeth and the baby woke up
[1:57:39] [Applause]
[1:57:47] now this made some of you this may seem
[1:57:49] like this just good stories no this is
[1:57:53] the revealed word this is who you are
[1:57:57] sitting among tonight
[1:57:59] this kind of stuff follows to believe
[1:58:08] listen
[1:58:13] everybody all right
[1:58:17] can't get by five more minutes almost
[1:58:18] nine o'clock anybody can I get my five
[1:58:21] moment no I just need no no I'll buy
[1:58:25] five minutes five ten fifteen twenty
[1:58:28] twenty-five thirty
[1:58:31] quarters little sign I got a whole hour
[1:58:34] [Applause]
[1:58:36] huh
[1:58:37] I try not to be that long though listen
[1:58:41] before it could be a word spoken it had
[1:58:44] to be a thought because the world is a
[1:58:46] thought made manifest when God speaks
[1:58:49] now back in the beginning when God
[1:58:51] looked down through the corridors of
[1:58:54] heaven and saw all the things that were
[1:58:58] going to happen on earth see God already
[1:59:01] stuff God already saw it was going to
[1:59:03] happen so his process was okay I got to
[1:59:07] do this for that I gotta do this for
[1:59:09] that this for that this for that God was
[1:59:11] making a way for everything he saw did
[1:59:16] you ever sit and just draw a picture in
[1:59:18] your mind how often we do that
[1:59:23] now that's the way God did it perhaps at
[1:59:27] the beginning and then it seemed good to
[1:59:29] him so he's spoken oh my what he was
[1:59:31] thinking he spoke it earlier he wanted
[1:59:34] to see a man he spoke a man he wanted to
[1:59:37] see a lion he spoke a lion he wanted to
[1:59:38] see the earth he spoke of Earth and as
[1:59:43] soon as it was spoken it became a word
[1:59:47] and anyway when it became a word it was
[1:59:51] automatically a part of God because in
[1:59:55] the beginning was the word the Word was
[1:59:57] with God and the Word was made flesh
[2:00:03] he said the salt was expressed in the
[2:00:05] word now listen once God expressed his
[2:00:08] thoughts and made it word holy he can
[2:00:11] never take it back so whatever God has
[2:00:15] wrote in this Bible he can never take it
[2:00:18] back whatever God has said about you he
[2:00:21] can never take it back he says where I
[2:00:25] know the thoughts I have concerning you
[2:00:26] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[2:00:31] bring you to an expecting Oh
[2:00:35] once it's spoken now it has to
[2:00:39] accomplish what God was thinking just
[2:00:42] that's what we had when you read the
[2:00:44] Word of God you need to look at and you
[2:00:46] say man it's just what's on God's mind
[2:00:50] God says you're the head and not the
[2:00:53] tail
[2:00:54] that's his thought process he said let
[2:00:57] the weak say that I am strong halu does
[2:01:00] his thought process hallelujah he said
[2:01:02] let the six am healed
[2:01:04] that's his thought process hey man
[2:01:09] find out what he's thinking about listen
[2:01:11] now this part is concerning you this is
[2:01:14] for everyone listen he says in the
[2:01:16] beginning was the word and the Word was
[2:01:18] with God in the Word was God see the
[2:01:20] word was God
[2:01:21] it was God it was his thoughts and and
[2:01:24] and his thoughts was with him always
[2:01:26] there god's thoughts is eternal as God
[2:01:29] is a man that ain't skim milk brother
[2:01:32] see here it comes here we go
[2:01:39] cuz toss was his word in the beginning
[2:01:42] that is in eternity now when the
[2:01:46] beginning first started time in the
[2:01:48] beginning was the word God's thoughts
[2:01:50] and the Word was with God and the Word
[2:01:52] was God
[2:01:53] see his thoughts is what he is
[2:01:58] now I will say something on shaky boots
[2:02:02] I want you to pull out your big old
[2:02:04] spiritual gloves and casteth whatever
[2:02:08] God thought about he spoken no whatever
[2:02:11] he spoke was what he was
[2:02:14] Amen now how many of you God thought
[2:02:17] about how many of you got spoken to
[2:02:21] exist so you are what God is because God
[2:02:30] is his thoughts you mean to tell me God
[2:02:38] all about me if he thought about you
[2:02:43] that's because you are a part of him and
[2:02:47] if you are a part of him that's why
[2:02:49] Jesus could say when you see me you see
[2:02:51] the father I hope you catching the
[2:02:58] church if God thought about you then
[2:03:00] because you are a part of him so when I
[2:03:05] see you I see God
[2:03:13] sure
[2:03:15] his thoughts is what he is that's you
[2:03:18] what your thoughts are is what you are
[2:03:21] no matter what you try to live by
[2:03:23] something else your thoughts is what you
[2:03:25] are now some of you might in your mind
[2:03:28] right now you might be thinking brother
[2:03:30] kind of long
[2:03:32] I'm tired and you'll become tired
[2:03:36] because that's what you're thinking but
[2:03:39] you sitting in the atmosphere you start
[2:03:41] having thoughts that I'm blessed it
[2:03:47] might be a little warm in here but I'm
[2:03:49] blessed
[2:03:51] booyah you know Bill Gates had half
[2:03:54] thoughts like I'm rich oh you know what
[2:03:59] I think sometimes President Trump is
[2:04:01] shocked he say I'm president
[2:04:06] half the time you realize it but he
[2:04:08] takes me down president I feel somebody
[2:04:14] picking up stones everywhere
[2:04:15] let me read like hallelujah but you are
[2:04:22] what you're thinking and you know I like
[2:04:25] I like to be relatable you know what
[2:04:27] sometimes I talk about sports they don't
[2:04:29] mean I watch sports all day but you know
[2:04:31] there was a time when I was sit down and
[2:04:32] watch a nice basketball game and I felt
[2:04:34] like I was a part of
[2:04:36] you know they got all kind of players
[2:04:38] nowadays but who they always try to
[2:04:41] mention the greatest player to the man
[2:04:48] named played in 20 years but he's still
[2:04:51] on everybody mind now that's what you
[2:04:54] call a legacy dribble the ball in 10 20
[2:05:02] years but every great player that's
[2:05:04] relevant now it's being compared to men
[2:05:07] that played 20 years ago he left an
[2:05:12] impression on the game why don't we talk
[2:05:17] about Paul because he left an impression
[2:05:18] on the Scriptures why don't we talk
[2:05:22] about rehab because she left an
[2:05:23] impression why don't we talk about roof
[2:05:25] she left an impression why don't we talk
[2:05:27] about Abraham cuz he left an impression
[2:05:31] hurry up and tonight somebody should be
[2:05:35] talking about you because the God in
[2:05:37] your life should leave an impression on
[2:05:40] the service talk about Mike you know

[2:12:39] but I want you to think on your God
[2:12:43] that he can do anything he's the god of
[2:12:47] a paradox
[2:12:52] don't blame nothing yet y'all just sit
[2:12:54] still for me I really want the church to
[2:12:59] catch this listen I wish our brothers
[2:13:03] could put it on the street listen
[2:13:07] it says if you witness to anything
[2:13:11] you're just as guilty as being a
[2:13:14] partaker of it so if we witness say oh
[2:13:20] yes they ought to have done this so and
[2:13:25] so be careful what you say because
[2:13:27] you're guilty the way your judgment goes
[2:13:30] if you can't decide don't say nothing
[2:13:34] just leave it alone then when you
[2:13:37] testify - you are a Christian then
[2:13:41] you're a guilty see if you say you're a
[2:13:43] Christian - whatever life you live
[2:13:44] you're guilty
[2:13:46] listen you're guilty of being a
[2:13:49] Christian and you must live to that
[2:13:51] listen to this church when God makes a
[2:13:54] promise in the Bible I see a man here in
[2:13:57] a wheelchair when God makes a promise
[2:13:59] he's guilty of that promise unless he
[2:14:03] brings it to pass
[2:14:06] I told you to catch that now if God
[2:14:12] makes a promise in the Bible every word
[2:14:15] that he said
[2:14:17] until that promise is for field
[2:14:20] according to your faith god is guilty
[2:14:25] now you might say how can God be guilty
[2:14:27] he can't because he's gonna fulfill what
[2:14:30] you believe
[2:14:34] listen Church he's guilty they're
[2:14:36] promised unless he brings it to pass now
[2:14:39] you might be standing here saying lord I
[2:14:42] need deliverance if God is the god of
[2:14:44] deliverance he must bring it to pass or
[2:14:47] he'll be guilty of not delivering you
[2:14:49] and I know none of us got a testimony
[2:14:52] that God don't keep his promises
[2:14:55] so I say tonight that whatever you
[2:14:58] believe in look for God to move because
[2:15:00] he can never be guilty ma listen God is
[2:15:08] guilty when he makes a promise he made
[2:15:10] if I say Lord you said in your Bible you
[2:15:14] say delight myself in the Lord and he
[2:15:17] promised to give me the desires of my
[2:15:19] life of my of my heart for I delight
[2:15:22] myself I serve the Lord I give him
[2:15:24] everything I got and God don't fulfill
[2:15:26] my desire that means that was that his
[2:15:28] word
[2:15:34] how can God never be guilty he'd only be
[2:15:38] guilty if he don't fulfill what he wrote
[2:15:42] and he'd never do that because he don't
[2:15:48] fulfill what he's wrote that me he
[2:15:50] wasn't God in the first place
[2:15:52] listen Church God is guilty when he
[2:15:56] makes a promise and the Scriptures are
[2:15:59] guilty until they are fulfilled
[2:16:02] I want you to find your scripture in the
[2:16:08] Bible whatever is pertaining to you and
[2:16:11] your situation and believe in God
[2:16:14] Harley believed in God in such a way
[2:16:17] until God has to move
[2:16:21] because if he don't he'll be a guilty
[2:16:23] guy
[2:16:25] Balaam was guilty because he had people
[2:16:29] that believed in him but he couldn't
[2:16:31] deliver so he was a guilty God the God
[2:16:36] of Syria a guilty God the God of the
[2:16:39] other other of the amory so guilty God
[2:16:42] the God of the Jebusites are guilty God
[2:16:44] why because he couldn't fulfill their
[2:16:46] desires but our God oh yeah he said I
[2:16:51] never leave you nor forsake you
[2:16:55] hallelujah with Elijah hallelujah met
[2:16:58] the Red Hill hallelujah my camera he
[2:17:00] said let the real God answer by fire
[2:17:02] holy pail turned out to be a guilty call
[2:17:06] because he couldn't answer but our God
[2:17:08] the great Jehovah he came down and he
[2:17:11] answered by fire and he's still the same
[2:17:18] car tonight
[2:17:20] God will never be guilty if you believe
[2:17:24] the Scriptures will never remain guilty
[2:17:27] if you believe cuz they have to be
[2:17:30] fulfilled
[2:17:38] I have a scripture and I keep laying
[2:17:43] before God I said Lord you said the Holy
[2:17:45] Ghost is unto me in my children okay so
[2:17:51] until I see all three of them filled
[2:17:53] with the Holy Ghost I'm gonna keep
[2:17:54] running back to God say Lord now I don't
[2:17:57] want to say you guilty but I don't see
[2:17:59] all of them filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:18:00] yet I say so until they feel with the
[2:18:04] Holy Ghost you owe me you owe me God all
[2:18:14] I'm doing is just believing what you
[2:18:16] said Lord you said now the Scriptures
[2:18:20] are guilty the Scriptures have to be
[2:18:21] fulfilled Lord you said if I pay my time
[2:18:24] I'll be blessed don't make this your big
[2:18:29] account can be negative 300 that's a lot
[2:18:32] if you paint your tires
[2:18:36] somebody believe with me
[2:18:38] I made that same statement right there
[2:18:42] in Canada and the sister saying and she
[2:18:45] confess right there in that moment what
[2:18:47] she needed in her bank account real
[2:18:49] faith confesses and then go look for it
[2:18:51] she confessed it got out of church pull
[2:18:53] up the app looked at it it was in the
[2:18:55] bank account
[2:18:59] [Applause]

[2:19:14] cool play me something else it's the
[2:19:15] same work whatever y'all think can you
[2:19:18] imagine
[2:19:19] I'm gonna believe in God tonight
[2:19:25] unanimously so we're all on the same
[2:19:28] Accord now can you imagine somebody
[2:19:32] walking out of here tonight saying that
[2:19:35] God is guilty
[2:19:37] because he couldn't do what they stood
[2:19:39] in need of I say you didn't pray to my
[2:19:43] god because my God is more than able
[2:19:47] hallelujah my God keeps all of his
[2:19:50] promises hallelujah he may not come when
[2:19:54] you want it but he'll be right on time
[2:19:57] hallelujah he'll never be guilty oh yeah

[2:20:04] supreme God the Lord of lords and King
[2:20:08] of Kings

[2:25:41] can talk to my god hallelujah
[2:25:44] I was already excited don't get too
[2:25:46] excited that you forget to speak so I'm
[2:25:54] sitting in a hurry I know I'm already up
[2:25:57] there's blood and I said Lord okay I say
[2:26:01] father here we go now I know what kind
[2:26:04] of demon is trying to slow me down and
[2:26:08] it's a spirit called diabetes and I said
[2:26:11] Lord according to your word you said you
[2:26:14] gave us power to bind in power to loosen
[2:26:17] you've given us power over unclean
[2:26:19] spirits so I said Lord in the name of
[2:26:22] Jesus Christ I take authority over the
[2:26:26] spirit of diabetes and I commanded to
[2:26:28] leave this room notice I never confess
[2:26:35] to God that I had it he was on the
[2:26:39] outside trying to get in hallelujah but
[2:26:43] the Bible says resist him and he'll flee
[2:26:46] so all I had to do is resist in that
[2:26:48] moment and he got to running hallelujah
[2:26:51] so the doctor comes back here and she
[2:26:53] says okay here's the machine she she
[2:26:55] hooks me up sister brownie pricked my
[2:26:57] finger the machine goes off she looks at
[2:27:01] it and she's
[2:27:04] you're right you don't have diabetes I
[2:27:08] say I told you
[2:27:18] but now the doctor is confused she's
[2:27:25] confused so she started asking me
[2:27:27] questions like I was a doctor she says I
[2:27:32] don't know how you can have a positive
[2:27:34] test and did a negative test and as i
[2:27:38] sat there or either was I thought I left
[2:27:40] you know this is kept coming through my
[2:27:42] mind how can you have a positive and a
[2:27:43] negative at the same time and God began
[2:27:46] to rehearse to me he says very simple
[2:27:49] the spirit was there how do you know
[2:27:52] when you first went in the spirit was
[2:27:54] dead
[2:27:55] trying to find a house he said but what
[2:27:57] made the spirit leave what's your
[2:27:59] confession it was there Pulu yeah but
[2:28:06] when you started to say no I don't know
[2:28:08] I don't I don't have diabetes that
[2:28:11] spirit all you could do was stand there
[2:28:13] he had no house he had nowhere to go
[2:28:16] then you went in the back you prayed and
[2:28:18] you bind him so he had to leave
[2:28:20] completely no doubt you can go in a
[2:28:24] spear to be there but whether he gets
[2:28:26] into your temple is what comes out of
[2:28:28] your mouth and this is the clincher
[2:28:36] God showed me that but I didn't share
[2:28:38] that with the doctor but this is what
[2:28:40] the doctor says to me not my mother just
[2:28:42] the money what I said was a large
[2:28:43] sweetie it was the same thing again God
[2:28:50] don't change she says well mr. Dix
[2:28:54] what did you eat last night it was a
[2:28:56] little different this time
[2:28:57] I said sweet tea and some chocolate chip
[2:29:02] cookies and the doctor says to me
[2:29:06] y'all listen to me good the doctor says
[2:29:09] to me oh yeah cookies and tea will show
[2:29:15] up in your system like that
[2:29:17] and I said oh really so God gave me a
[2:29:20] little revelation I said okay if you
[2:29:23] look there and you saw cookies and key
[2:29:26] why don't you try to change the name to
[2:29:28] diabetes call it what it is it's cookies
[2:29:32] and key whether the name change into
[2:29:34] diabetes
[2:29:38] and I tell you your problem is something
[2:29:40] that you've done something you put into
[2:29:43] your life
[2:29:43] Holly did the devil comes with some
[2:29:45] extreme name that you can't explain to
[2:29:48] get you to believing in it you know I
[2:29:52] got I got a demon of stress on me no
[2:29:54] stresses call your job or your children
[2:30:01] something natural take care of that area
[2:30:05] in the spirit of leave that's all it is
[2:30:09] the prophet of God says before it ever
[2:30:14] comes the spirit you have to receive it
[2:30:17] as I thought many times we go to the
[2:30:22] dollar we go feeling pretty good and
[2:30:23] then we go in and say oh you got cancer
[2:30:25] and once you accept that thought cancer
[2:30:27] comes in your body that's how the enemy
[2:30:31] does he wants to talk you out of it but
[2:30:34] stand your ground get your thought
[2:30:37] process right stop letting it be a
[2:30:39] bumper sticker what would Jesus do let
[2:30:41] it become a lifestyle let it become a

[2:31:45] [Music]
[2:32:00] not Jesus nor father here we are Lord
[2:32:06] lower your people I worship you so
[2:32:10] forgive me if I've gone too long the
[2:32:14] Lord just to get the point across to
[2:32:15] your people then you are a God that are
[2:32:19] in the midst of your people you want to
[2:32:23] do it for us more than we can only
[2:32:25] imagine so father we pray that the mind
[2:32:29] of God will become relevant in this
[2:32:32] place so that we'll have the thoughts of
[2:32:35] God thoughts of peace and not of evil
[2:32:39] thoughts of saving grace thoughts of
[2:32:42] your healing power Lord thoughts of
[2:32:45] deliverance lo don'ts of righteousness
[2:32:49] thoughts of love Lord tops of faith
[2:32:53] don't help us to tap into your mind
[2:32:55] tonight Lord know that we will leave out
[2:32:58] here knowing that our God is a God that
[2:33:02] one time a God that comes to church with
[2:33:05] us a God that speaks his word for
[2:33:08] purpose Lord you see all the hands that
[2:33:12] are lifted to you but most of all Lord
[2:33:15] you see the hearts and you know where
[2:33:17] each and every one of us are spiritually
[2:33:19] Lord and naturally father though we pray
[2:33:22] that the spirit of sincerity moves
[2:33:25] through the building Lord nor the will
[2:33:29] that everything about us die Lord that
[2:33:34] our thoughts die Lord that our habits
[2:33:37] die Lord don't let our actions die laws
[2:33:40] nor than we take on the thoughts of God
[2:33:43] will select this man that was in Christ
[2:33:46] also be in us Lord knowing in this
[2:33:51] moment when I can feel the spirit of
[2:33:55] hurt Lord but I can feel Lord the spirit
[2:33:59] of hurt so do you have a child in this
[2:34:02] room carrying hurt in pain no but you're
[2:34:06] a god that can heal them from that hurt
[2:34:09] and from that plane and I saying to you
[2:34:12] you don't have to carry that spirit
[2:34:14] anymore I give unto you charity
[2:34:22] hallelujah I give unto you charity love
[2:34:26] oh not somebody's believing for the
[2:34:39] manifestation of healing don't let them
[2:34:47] step out Lord let them step out let them
[2:34:50] put one foot on the water Lord and let
[2:34:53] them hold your hand and keep their eyes
[2:34:55] on you and they walk across a situation
[2:34:57] that they shouldn't walk across in the
[2:35:00] natural but we are not believing you in
[2:35:03] the natural we're believing in the
[2:35:04] supernatural don't have your way so
[2:35:10] we've talked about you and your
[2:35:11] greatness we talked about you not being
[2:35:14] a guilty God the Lord we ask father and
[2:35:18] you come and fulfill your word in the
[2:35:20] sanctuary don't have your way move like
[2:35:25] never before in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:35:28] in the name of Jesus Christ we pray
