[33:55] that. Oh, that I thank you. Oh, let's
[33:59] just sing the Lord just one more time.
[34:01] We want to
[34:03] thank you. We thank you,
[34:09] Jesus. Yes, Lord. Oh, for the grace that
[34:14] you
[34:15] are. Oh, what grace, what love.

[34:22] repay. But from my heart tonight, I like
[34:26] to say
[34:28] that. Oh, that I thank
[34:32] you. And I just want to say
[34:37] thanks. Oh, thanks.
[34:40] Lord, I give you
[34:43] thanks for
[34:45] all that you have done in my life. Lord
[34:51] Jesus, we are so
[34:54] blessed that our soul has found rest.
[35:01] Oh, I want to give you thanks.
[35:06] Oh, I want to say
[35:09] thanks.
[35:11] Thanks. I give you
[35:15] thanks for
[35:18] all you
[35:20] do. All you've
[35:23] done, for I am so
[35:27] blessed. My soul has found a rest. Oh
[35:34] Lord, I give you thanks.
[35:40] [Music]
[35:43] Hallelujah.
[35:46] Amen.
[35:47] We certainly have so much to be thankful
[35:49] for, don't we?
[35:51] Amen. I tell you, in the the time that
[35:54] we're living in, I
[35:56] often one of the ways I start to begin
[35:59] just giving God thanks. I thank God for
[36:01] being in my right mind.
[36:03] That's true. And I I don't say that for
[36:06] any slide. I'm just saying I thank God
[36:08] in this hour, you know, and thank God
[36:11] for the peace of God. Yes. Because you
[36:15] know, everything that we see many times
[36:19] it people can look so satisfied and
[36:23] content, but you realize that you you
[36:25] you can't judge things by what's on the
[36:27] outside.
[36:29] Yes, sir. What's on the inside itself?
[36:32] Sometimes the things that can seem so
[36:34] fine on the outside, but yet on the
[36:36] inside there's a cry. And I'm glad that
[36:39] within our lives that God heard that
[36:41] cry. Aren't you? Amen. We were like the
[36:43] man in the tombs that he heard the cry
[36:45] of our soul. You know, a lot of the
[36:47] other parts of our life, we said we were
[36:49] okay, but God heard the cry of of our
[36:51] soul. And I'm glad he answered that that
[36:54] that request. And I'm thankful for for
[36:56] his peace. Yes. Amen. In the midst of
[36:59] this time, you know, that's just it
[37:01] brings us such a real comfort to our
[37:03] lives. I want to say thank you to the
[37:06] musicians and u we want to just get
[37:09] ready to turn right into the scriptures.
[37:12] I want to go right back into 1
[37:14] Corinthians chapter
[37:18] 12. And
[37:22] uh the young people have had a time with
[37:24] me
[37:26] uh you know they they get a they get a
[37:29] laugh out of u wonder what's being
[37:33] preached on tonight and they you know of
[37:35] course when everything changed to church
[37:36] order there and I took a little break
[37:37] from uh from from Job and you know that
[37:41] that was kind of the running theme at
[37:42] that time they said well
[37:44] uh you know guess guess what he's
[37:46] preaching on tonight and I'm not just
[37:48] talking about these guys I'm talking
[37:49] about all all of the young the young
[37:51] people. So, you know, we just take it in
[37:53] stride. I tell them I said, "Well, we'll
[37:56] we just we we get back to those things."
[37:58] But, um I I thought I was really um the
[38:02] last this past Friday, we in our youth
[38:04] meeting, I spoke to the young people on
[38:07] the five comingings of
[38:08] Elijah. And uh I God will give us grace.
[38:12] I want to be able to bring that here to
[38:14] the church as well. uh because there's
[38:17] uh new ones and different ones among us.
[38:19] But, you know, just to hear I was kind
[38:21] of shocked in one way when I hear some
[38:23] of the young people when they were
[38:24] saying they're saying, "Hey, this this
[38:26] series on church order, this has been my
[38:28] favorite
[38:31] series." If somebody would have told me
[38:33] that months
[38:34] ago, I would have said that wouldn't be
[38:36] my favorite series even for myself. But,
[38:39] uh, you know, I think when we look at
[38:42] things, you know, it comes down to when
[38:44] God, he speaks and he ministers to to
[38:47] the needs. He gives clarity a lot of
[38:50] things sometimes that what we're we're
[38:52] seeing and uh we can see and and within
[38:56] it when God gives clarity or
[38:58] understanding it just has a way of
[39:00] settling us you know and that that's
[39:02] what God's that's the whole objective of
[39:03] the gospel every time when we leave here
[39:06] is not that we would leave here in
[39:08] upheaval but that we're settled
[39:11] whether God comes around and there's
[39:13] things that are removed from our life
[39:14] that actually is causing hindrances or
[39:17] uh there's things that for us just to
[39:19] take a hold of in the word of God.
[39:21] That's the whole objective is the is the
[39:22] gospel is rest. So let's read here in
[39:26] the scriptures in 1 Corinthians chapter
[39:29] 12 and verse 4. Paul said, "Now there
[39:33] are diversities of gifts but the same
[39:38] spirit and there are differences of
[39:42] administrations but the same
[39:45] Lord. And there are diversities of
[39:49] operations, but it is the same God which
[39:52] workketh all in all. But the
[39:56] manifestation of the spirit is given to
[39:59] every man to profit with all or to
[40:02] profit
[40:05] all. It goes on to say, for to one is
[40:08] given by the spirit the word of wisdom.
[40:11] We've looked at that one a couple weeks
[40:13] ago.
[40:14] and to another the word of knowledge by
[40:17] the same spirit. Now, I want you to
[40:18] notice how this is worded. It's not men
[40:22] that is doing this. It's not even
[40:26] impressions or
[40:28] feelings. It's the spirit of God giving
[40:30] a special endowment
[40:33] for that moment to meet the need that is
[40:37] present. This is why it's so that's so
[40:41] so so important. For to one is given by
[40:45] the spirit, the word of wisdom, to
[40:47] another the word of knowledge by the
[40:49] same spirit, and to another faith by the
[40:53] same spirit. And that's what we'd like
[40:56] to look at there is just take that on
[40:58] the gift of faith tonight. Let's just
[41:01] bow our hearts in a word of prayer.
[41:03] Heavenly Father, as we just come before
[41:06] your throne tonight, Lord, I know that
[41:09] there are many needs, Lord, that are
[41:12] among us, visible and invisible, Lord.
[41:15] Those that would be streaming, the
[41:17] others would would archive later, Lord.
[41:20] Father, we ask that you would just
[41:22] minister to every one of your children.
[41:25] Lord, you see, Father, with not just us
[41:28] as an assembly, but I know many others,
[41:30] Lord, that just dear God, they're
[41:32] battling with with sickness, Father.
[41:35] Lord, I'm not only asking that you would
[41:37] touch and deliver from sickness, but
[41:40] Father is just impressed on my heart
[41:42] today that you would just move upon the
[41:46] immune systems, Lord, of your children.
[41:49] I'm reminded Lord of a quote where your
[41:52] prophet he spoke about a person that had
[41:56] went to the to a certain doctor and that
[41:59] doctor said well I'm not going to give
[42:01] you all kind this medicine this and this
[42:03] and this but what we need to do we need
[42:06] to build you up so he began to list all
[42:10] the vitamins and the prophet would take
[42:12] that natural example of how a doctor
[42:15] approached this patient and then would
[42:18] obviously speak to us in regards to
[42:20] building up our faith. So Lord, if we
[42:23] can see how faith needs to be built,
[42:25] Lord, to obtain the promise of God, we
[42:28] also know that we're in these bodies,
[42:30] Lord. And you knew, Lord, that we would
[42:33] be here. We need your help, Lord.
[42:36] Father, we could read all the health
[42:37] books. We could have all the health
[42:39] knowledge. And Lord, I know we're not
[42:41] against that. You're not against that at
[42:43] all. Could we even see where Isaiah was?
[42:46] He Lord had that of a mixture of figs
[42:48] that was Lord paste that was put on his
[42:51] eyes. Your prophet would tell us in one
[42:53] message Lord when you spit upon the
[42:55] ground and put that clay upon the eyes
[42:58] he said you used medicine on his eyes
[43:01] because it comes from the elements of
[43:04] the earth. Now, Lord Jesus, we ask that
[43:08] right now, Father, not only for a divine
[43:11] touch among your children, but God, I'm
[43:13] asking, Lord, that Father, you would
[43:15] just restore the immune systems. Lord,
[43:18] may you move down, Lord. I pray for each
[43:20] one, Lord. I think of brother Brian and
[43:23] Sister Barb. Lord, I think of different
[43:25] ones, Lord, that Father, you know, Lord,
[43:28] the touch that's needed in their bodies,
[43:30] Lord. May you move in such a special
[43:33] way. We pray Lord we commit this service
[43:36] Lord into your hands and ask that you
[43:38] would just Lord take Lord the gift that
[43:41] you've placed in my life and Lord give
[43:43] me the grace to step aside that you can
[43:45] speak to us Lord and may our
[43:47] understanding be made fruitful Lord and
[43:50] the needs that we have in you may we
[43:52] recognize your presence Lord and Father
[43:55] we'll give you the pres all the praise
[43:57] honor glory in Jesus name
[44:00] amen God bless you as you're being
[44:03] seated did. I want to just quickly um
[44:07] the
[44:09] uh the rest of the the books and things
[44:11] like that. The uh they should be coming
[44:13] in. I and they were everything was sent
[44:16] out and I've talked with brother George
[44:17] a couple times and so at any time I'm
[44:21] expecting them to come and so there's
[44:23] going to be some kind of some heavy
[44:25] loads that we'll I'll need to toad over
[44:27] here. So, um we're kind of waiting on
[44:31] that. Um but that should be at any time.
[44:34] And I also
[44:36] um I had went ahead and I ordered also
[44:39] uh more of these right here. This is the
[44:41] back part of the church age book. It's
[44:42] the resume. This is the one that um
[44:46] brother George had mentioned. If you you
[44:48] know you're witnessing to someone and
[44:50] you uh you don't want to give them a
[44:52] 400page church age book. Um but this
[44:56] right here the resume even if you
[44:57] yourself you know just just this really
[45:00] gives an overview and showing that
[45:02] organizational spirit and how Satan has
[45:05] worked that false vine has worked all
[45:07] the way through. It's a very good
[45:09] overview and a very good witnessing
[45:11] tool. Uh and that's it's actually the
[45:14] last chapter within the uh church age
[45:17] book that is there. And I always love
[45:19] the last paragraph. This last paragraph
[45:22] is what was inside of the tape covers.
[45:24] That's good. I love what brother says.
[45:26] Not for one moment do I bring a message
[45:28] to the people that they may follow me or
[45:30] join my church or start some fellowship
[45:33] and organization. I've never done that
[45:35] and will not do that now. I have no
[45:38] interest in those things. But I do have
[45:40] an interest in the things of God and
[45:42] people. And if I can accomplish that one
[45:44] thing, I'll be satisfied. That one thing
[45:47] is to see a rel see established a true
[45:50] relationship between God and men wherein
[45:53] men become new creations in Christ and
[45:57] goes on that to me is just beautiful.
[45:59] That's that's the objective. Amen.
[46:02] That's the objective of this message
[46:04] because that's what this message come to
[46:06] do. The the message never came to to to
[46:08] to bring about crowds and and uh you
[46:12] know and that that we would follow
[46:13] personalities. That's what the prophet
[46:15] was is speaking. He's not contradicting
[46:17] the scripture where Paul said, "Follow
[46:19] me as I follow Christ." He's pointing it
[46:21] to that we're not following a
[46:22] personality. We're not just following
[46:25] something that oh this is this is
[46:27] wonderful and this is but we're we want
[46:29] to recognize and hearing the voice of
[46:31] God. And then I also so this I asked him
[46:34] I said hey I asked brother George I said
[46:37] do you have this in Spanish? And he said
[46:39] we don't. Because if they had in Spanish
[46:41] I'd have bought these two. So, I've got
[46:43] I've got quite a bit of these coming in
[46:45] in a box. And so, some of them are
[46:48] sitting out there now. Uh I just ask you
[46:51] just make sure that we we don't have to
[46:54] go to your house and there's a stack of
[46:56] these at your
[46:58] house. But these are really what you
[47:01] know as as it's needful, you know, to
[47:03] witness. I also I also had uh purchased
[47:07] uh quite a bit of these tracks. got
[47:09] about a hundred of these coming and I
[47:11] have u uh a good they also they have
[47:15] these in Spanish so I mean that won't do
[47:18] me any good but you know there's we're
[47:20] in where we live and and you know this
[47:22] is where we're called to and so uh I
[47:24] don't know if they have them in French
[47:26] because I have to think about that now
[47:27] and I did get books in French so there
[47:30] was a few few books that I was able
[47:33] brother Barry Coffee rounded up and sent
[47:35] up to me uh in French and so uh I I've
[47:39] done all I can do. But you know, the
[47:40] thing that's difficult is because
[47:42] there's no printing that goes on on US
[47:46] soil. No printing of books. So if you
[47:49] actually want to purchase books, you
[47:51] have to purchase it from overseas and
[47:52] have them sent back over. There's still
[47:54] some remaining remnants that are that
[47:56] are out there. But uh one of the things
[47:58] I want to share with you here
[47:59] eventually, which How many of you are
[48:01] aware of the message hub? The message
[48:04] hub it's called. Okay. So if brother
[48:07] brother Carlos you may help out help
[48:09] brother Gomez out. Um but but the uh the
[48:13] with the message hub the reason we say
[48:15] that is because when I was asking
[48:17] brother George I said brother George
[48:18] what do we what do you do you know in
[48:20] the sense because you know I'm looking
[48:22] at maybe the you know and replenishing
[48:24] books and and things like that cuz um
[48:27] and brother George said well you know
[48:29] and and I knew that there's there's just
[48:30] not there's not any printing you know
[48:32] brother George has that he's the one
[48:34] where I can get the church age books
[48:36] from and he actually is kind of like the
[48:38] conduit that when you go to other
[48:40] churches and maybe they're selling them.
[48:42] That conduit is coming right through
[48:43] Brother George. So, I appreciate him
[48:45] keeping those in stock, but the message
[48:47] hub is actually where you can go to. You
[48:50] can only and I was checking it out the
[48:52] other day. You can, you know, listen to
[48:54] it in in other languages. You select the
[48:56] language and then if you want to read,
[48:58] read one. Um, so maybe if you if if if
[49:03] you're in need of being able to hear in
[49:06] a certain uh language or you might
[49:08] rather read it in a certain language or
[49:09] hear um you can actually go on there and
[49:12] you can actually print out your own
[49:13] booklets on there on the message hub as
[49:16] well as just to just to even read them.
[49:19] I I also need to do this and I'm saying
[49:21] it so that somebody can remind me
[49:24] because if it if it's not down there's
[49:26] no string on the finger, no post-it note
[49:28] on the desk and no reminder. Out of
[49:30] sight, out of mind. And that is brother
[49:32] George gave me a flash drive that has
[49:34] all of the messages that he interpreted
[49:38] into Spanish. So, you know, if you have
[49:41] a flash drive and you know, you can take
[49:43] that home, Sister Stephanie, that that
[49:45] won't do you any good. But you can take
[49:47] you can take that home. and it's right
[49:49] into Spanish. And so if anybody needs
[49:51] that or whatever, we can I want I want
[49:54] to get that in your hands. And so, uh,
[49:56] you can put it on your computer and then
[49:58] bring the flash drive back and and, um,
[50:00] then we'll we'll get it around from
[50:02] there. So, um, I mentioned this. I have
[50:06] a bunch coming in English and a bunch
[50:08] also in Spanish. So, this is a very
[50:10] good, very, very good tool. The water
[50:13] baptism, man, it just How many remember
[50:16] the the wheel? Do you all remember the
[50:17] wheel? one God.
[50:20] Those are awesome.
[50:23] Brother Tim Puit said his family used to
[50:26] when he was just a boy, how they used to
[50:28] actually take that and they would put
[50:29] the Halloween candy in it and wrap it up
[50:31] and give out the Halloween candy. And so
[50:34] when people got home and open up the
[50:35] Halloween candy, it was the one God
[50:38] track. That's slick,
[50:42] man. That's slick. But uh this right
[50:46] here is so good. But I remember when
[50:48] brother brother Samuel Johnson had a
[50:49] track. I've got it in my file somewhere
[50:52] of where brother Samuel Johnson had put
[50:54] together all of these uh points and I'm
[50:56] assuming brother Samuel Johnson had done
[50:58] it like all of the all of the history
[51:00] and things like that on that with water
[51:02] baptism. But I just thought that was
[51:04] it's a real good track uh to have. So um
[51:07] those those will be coming in at the
[51:09] same time. And as soon as we have the
[51:11] books in uh I'm not going to delay.
[51:13] We'll get them we'll get them right into
[51:14] your hands. So, I want to look here
[51:18] tonight at this this thought. And the
[51:21] reason that I just felt on my heart to
[51:23] title this portion the other spiritual
[51:26] gifts because these are not um items
[51:30] that get uh gifts that get focused on
[51:32] too much. Everything's always a lot of
[51:35] times is centered around with tongues
[51:37] and and prophecy. And you can see in the
[51:40] scripture Paul had Paul spent a great
[51:43] deal with those two gifts which prophecy
[51:46] interpretation interpretation is the
[51:49] prophecy. So those things were were were
[51:52] being uh had to really be focused on and
[51:55] Paul spent a majority of time within the
[51:57] scriptures and I'm glad he did uh
[52:00] because if that had if that hadn't
[52:01] happened we wouldn't have no resource to
[52:03] go to. But then when you can see that
[52:06] and you can see how Paul was not just
[52:08] pulling this out of thin air because it
[52:10] was the spirit of God that was leading
[52:12] Paul on how to put the church in order.
[52:15] Uh because you know when you think of it
[52:18] after the revealing of the son of man
[52:20] then comes a five-fold ministry and
[52:23] Paul's Paul's uh ministry um coming and
[52:28] uh moving this among the Gentiles. Paul
[52:30] himself is the one catching that that
[52:33] inspiration of the five-fold ministry
[52:36] and Paul you would read many times in
[52:38] the scriptures where he will send
[52:40] different ones Titus and he would send
[52:42] Titus to ordain elders in cities and to
[52:46] set things in order that we're lacking.
[52:48] You see that in the scripture. So when
[52:50] we see this uh we want to look here just
[52:53] at this um gift and it's the gift of
[52:57] faith. And I want to look here in the
[52:59] scriptures for it says to another faith
[53:02] by the same spirit. So looking at the
[53:07] gift of faith I want to look in the
[53:10] scripture here where it says Paul is
[53:13] writing and he says for I say through
[53:15] the grace given unto me to every man
[53:17] that is among you not to think of
[53:20] himself more highly than he ought to
[53:22] think. That's a full-time job. but to
[53:26] think soberly according as God hath
[53:29] dealt to every man the measure of faith.
[53:34] Now what Paul is writing of here is that
[53:38] faith that was once delivered to the
[53:41] saints. That faith that Joe Jude was
[53:45] admonished to contend for.
[53:48] That faith that Paul said that the life
[53:51] I'm presently living, I'm living by the
[53:54] faith of the son of God who loved me and
[53:58] gave himself for me. The faith is the
[54:01] revelation of Jesus Christ to you
[54:03] personally.
[54:05] That is the seal of the living God.
[54:08] Hallelujah. And the measure of faith
[54:11] that God has given to you and I that our
[54:15] lives would even it's operated under
[54:18] this measure of faith. Now this is not
[54:20] our human faith. It's not our intellect.
[54:24] It's that faith that's been deposited
[54:26] that measure that God has given to you
[54:29] and I. Yeah, it's incredible when you
[54:31] look in the scripture because you will
[54:33] find times in the scripture where over
[54:36] and over when we look at this of of the
[54:39] faith and the measure of faith and how
[54:41] that many times it'll speak about God's
[54:43] faith even uh through the seven church
[54:46] ages. But then you'll have when God
[54:48] would point out in one of the ages of
[54:51] how that God took notice of their faith.
[54:54] So we don't lose our faith when you
[54:58] receive God's faith, but it's God's
[55:00] faith that comes down and actually is to
[55:02] be the source of influence over our fa
[55:05] faith. And there's times that even when
[55:08] you look at it that we don't see
[55:10] anything, we don't feel anything, but we
[55:13] act upon God's word. And that acting
[55:16] upon God's word is a display of our
[55:19] faith. We may not have exactly a word.
[55:22] You might have come here tonight. You do
[55:24] not have a direct word from God maybe
[55:26] about your healing or your situation,
[55:29] but you're believing and you're trusting
[55:31] the Lord that Lord, I'm trusting you to
[55:34] speak to my need, to my situation. What
[55:37] is that? That's your faith. But if God
[55:39] allows your faith to even testify, to be
[55:42] displayed in those times, it was when
[55:44] the Hebrew children walked into the
[55:47] fiery furnace, their faith was on
[55:49] display. But when they got in there,
[55:52] that's when God met them. So God will
[55:56] reward us. To think of it, to me, it's
[55:58] incredible how God would send down of
[56:00] his faith even in this hour. Because our
[56:05] faith alone would never be able to stand
[56:08] and stem against the tide. But with his
[56:11] faith on the inside, that same faith on
[56:14] the inside is what gives you and I the
[56:16] strength to triumph daily. Amen. And
[56:20] sometimes our feelings we don't feel
[56:21] very triumphant. But you know it's daily
[56:24] striving just as much as the prophet
[56:26] tells us in the church age book. The
[56:28] same faith that Polycarp and the rest
[56:30] overcame by is the same faith that you
[56:33] and I use on a daily basis to overcome.
[56:39] And so when we look here at at faith and
[56:43] now we're talking about the gift of
[56:45] faith and again the gift of faith to
[56:48] remember Paul would write about how that
[56:51] there would could even come those uh and
[56:55] whether it's true or false that would
[56:57] have faith to move mountains but Paul
[56:59] said though I have all faith hallelujah
[57:03] if I don't have love I'm nothing. So
[57:06] every one of these gifts, Paul starts
[57:09] out in the beginning of 1 Corinthians 13
[57:12] and lets us know that without
[57:15] love, nothing matters. Yes sir. So these
[57:20] these gifts themselves this is why that
[57:23] as we've been looking at it the gift or
[57:25] a gift one of the nine spiritual gifts
[57:28] working within a person's life and it
[57:30] may be of a great frequency whether in
[57:32] ministry or whatever more is no sign or
[57:36] evidence that that individual is a
[57:39] sealed believer. Right. So the prophet
[57:43] says it this clear. It's only it's only
[57:46] the evidence that the Holy Spirit is
[57:49] there performing these things. Because
[57:53] there's only one true evidence and that
[57:56] is receiving the word for our day. Amen.
[58:01] That means a life that's walking in
[58:03] humility. A life where it has been
[58:06] changed there. a new creation because
[58:10] whether or not maybe w with any of us
[58:13] you might trace back and say my I don't
[58:15] ever think that I've ever been used
[58:17] within that way and uh well don't ever
[58:19] say that you never will be because
[58:21] remember these nine spiritual gifts are
[58:24] not gifts that you come into this world
[58:27] born with it's not like prophet pastor
[58:30] teacher evangelist those are
[58:32] predestinated for ordained but these
[58:34] gifts the prophet tells us when you're
[58:36] in the body, then you're subject to any
[58:39] of these nine spiritual gifts.
[58:42] But you see, it's just like this of a
[58:43] pastoring. Well, that of a pastoring, my
[58:46] the gift is constantly being in use,
[58:48] whether I'm ministering, whether I'm
[58:49] counseling, all of those things. And and
[58:51] the frequency of that, my it's a it's a
[58:54] it it's used quite a bit. But then you
[58:55] take one of the nine spiritual gifts,
[58:58] it's it's not the same frequency isn't
[59:00] there. Why? Because it's on a as needed
[59:04] basis. And you know what? We can't even
[59:08] We in ourselves do not even know what to
[59:10] ask for, but God knows what to ask for.
[59:13] There you go. So what's there in our
[59:15] life that's calling out for a need to be
[59:18] met in our life? It's God who hears that
[59:20] call.
[59:22] It's God who hears that call. And that's
[59:24] why that it's God who drops down and
[59:27] gives that word of wisdom, gives that
[59:29] word of knowledge. And then for the
[59:31] person even if it comes to speaking in
[59:33] tongues even that which would interpret
[59:36] it's not their thoughts it's bypassing
[59:38] that just like this microphone has no
[59:41] thoughts of its own. The prophet tells
[59:44] us in the one place where he said I was
[59:47] standing and the Holy Spirit spoke. He
[59:50] said here come the interpretation after
[59:52] tongues had been given and he said what
[59:54] spoke in it spoke to my heart the pastor
[59:57] shall pray for those that are sick. He
[59:59] said, "But I held it. I didn't I didn't
[1:00:01] let it out." And he said, "Then it came
[1:00:03] right back to me again." He said, "I
[1:00:06] didn't let it out." And brother Ram
[1:00:08] tells us because of his reverence. He
[1:00:09] was he because he looked at himself. He
[1:00:11] said, "I don't have the gift of
[1:00:12] interpretation. I, you know, he's
[1:00:14] looking at himself and he's and he's
[1:00:15] showing us in that particular quote of
[1:00:18] his reverence." Now, we realize that
[1:00:20] reverence itself, it doesn't mean, well,
[1:00:22] I'm not going to give into it, but it
[1:00:24] was probably was just showing us how
[1:00:26] things are to be reverenced. And notice
[1:00:28] he said God went ahead and moved anyhow
[1:00:31] and the pastor got up and started
[1:00:33] praying for the sick and brother Ram
[1:00:34] said
[1:00:36] shoo you see God was in the meeting you
[1:00:39] know and uh you know we we we look at
[1:00:42] those things and it's so what I guess
[1:00:44] what we're saying over and over with the
[1:00:46] gifts it's not impressions
[1:00:49] it's not feelings we we don't we we
[1:00:52] don't show up and say you know I think
[1:00:54] the church needs this. That's not it at
[1:00:56] all. It's God sovereignly moving down
[1:00:59] and we don't even have a thought about
[1:01:03] it
[1:01:05] because the very moment brother Brandham
[1:01:08] how can that hit every time now this was
[1:01:10] a prophet now so we find many times as
[1:01:13] we've been ministering this you'll find
[1:01:15] these gifts being represented within the
[1:01:19] ministry of the prophet of God and
[1:01:22] you'll look and brother Bram will say
[1:01:24] well the reason it's never failed
[1:01:25] because I've never tried to put myself
[1:01:28] into it.
[1:01:30] I've always relied upon him.
[1:01:34] And so when we look at this on the gift
[1:01:37] of faith, I want you just to this pretty
[1:01:40] much set a a good uh uh background here
[1:01:43] for us. Out of faith is the substance.
[1:01:45] The prophet said, now here not long ago,
[1:01:48] he says, I'll give you a little story of
[1:01:49] someone who came so you can see what
[1:01:52] faith is. Faith is a gift of
[1:01:55] itself. You may have a portion of it,
[1:01:58] but there is a gift of faith.
[1:02:02] So now he's separating that measure of
[1:02:05] faith that we receive by the imparting
[1:02:09] of God's own life, separating that from
[1:02:12] a gift of faith. And he says, like some
[1:02:17] of you people anoint the sick and pray
[1:02:19] for them and you have a resort. That
[1:02:22] isn't a gift of healing. That is a
[1:02:24] portion of faith. But that isn't, now
[1:02:28] watch what he's saying. That isn't a
[1:02:30] direct gift of healing. For there's only
[1:02:33] one direct gift of healing. There's only
[1:02:35] one direct gift of faith. There's only
[1:02:38] one direct gift of miracles and so
[1:02:40] forth. That was in the scriptures. The
[1:02:42] apostles had it. Many mighty works they
[1:02:45] done, but there was one gift of healing.
[1:02:48] Now, what's the prophet speaking of
[1:02:50] here? that when we're looking at this of
[1:02:53] a gift of faith, the gift of healing,
[1:02:56] gift of miracles, that it is not
[1:02:58] something that is given to a person, but
[1:03:03] it is God sovereignly working through a
[1:03:07] yielded vessel to minister to what need
[1:03:11] is at hand. And that's why the prophet
[1:03:14] is saying, it's not many gifts of faith,
[1:03:17] many gifts of of healing. You're going
[1:03:19] to see as I go onto this quote where
[1:03:20] it's not someone, oh, I have a gift of
[1:03:22] healing and I have a gift of this. The
[1:03:24] prophet said there's one direct gift.
[1:03:27] Where does that come from? The one
[1:03:29] fountain of life. Hallelujah. And that
[1:03:33] stream when it's necessary, that stream,
[1:03:36] whether it's the stream of wisdom,
[1:03:38] stream of knowledge, stream of faith,
[1:03:41] stream of healing, stream of miracles,
[1:03:43] tongues, prophecy, interpretation,
[1:03:45] whatever stream is needed, God will see
[1:03:49] to it that that stream gets to us. Amen.
[1:03:53] Now, he says like when we leave the
[1:03:55] city, now he's going to explain it. Many
[1:03:57] people say, I've noticed in some places
[1:03:59] after I left them, maybe 15 or 20 will
[1:04:02] say, "The Lord gave me the gift of
[1:04:04] healing." Well, God bless their hearts.
[1:04:08] That's a southern phrase. When they say
[1:04:09] bless their heart, that means poor
[1:04:11] thing. That's what it means. Poor thing.
[1:04:14] That's what it does. Okay. So, when
[1:04:17] brother Brad is dealing with this after
[1:04:19] you leave a city, wh why? Because you
[1:04:22] think about it. Someone when after they
[1:04:24] leave, they'll say 15 or 20. Well, I got
[1:04:26] the gift of healing. They're looking.
[1:04:28] Now, you remember this? Those of you
[1:04:30] students of the message, you know,
[1:04:32] brother Brown would continue to tell us
[1:04:33] this. Greatest battle ever fought. Tell
[1:04:35] us this in shalom over and over. And he
[1:04:38] says it, if you just stick with greatest
[1:04:39] battle ever fought, he says many times,
[1:04:41] he said, when people see certain things
[1:04:43] being done, then they try to reach out
[1:04:46] and say, I can do that, too. And he
[1:04:49] says, what happens is they end up a
[1:04:52] shipwreck. That's right. It's the
[1:04:54] greatest battle ever fought because
[1:04:56] they're trying to reach out to do
[1:04:58] something. But to recognize that it's
[1:05:01] God
[1:05:03] sovereignly moving among his people
[1:05:07] according to their needs. Cuz you see,
[1:05:09] when it comes down to it, motive and
[1:05:11] objective is everything.
[1:05:14] Yeah. Yeah. Remember Simon in the book
[1:05:17] of Acts when he saw the Holy Ghost was
[1:05:20] being poured out, he wanted the Holy
[1:05:22] Ghost for what purpose? That whosoever I
[1:05:25] lay my hands on. That's why the prophet
[1:05:28] said in 1963 in the token, he said
[1:05:31] that's why the Holy Ghost is given out
[1:05:35] sparingly.
[1:05:37] Now, it's a fountain. Let me just say it
[1:05:39] like this. It's a fountain that's open
[1:05:41] in the house of David. But you see this
[1:05:43] is why God, he's not looking at even,
[1:05:46] you know, a person can be bowing on
[1:05:48] their knees at the altar. That's not
[1:05:50] what God has given the Holy Ghost be
[1:05:52] based on. Yeah, we believe there is an
[1:05:54] altar. The real altar, the prophet said,
[1:05:55] is in your mind where God meets you in
[1:05:57] your heart. But what is God looking at?
[1:06:00] God is looking at the heart. That's
[1:06:03] where the Holy Ghost comes.
[1:06:05] Is that right? It comes to the heart. It
[1:06:08] comes to deal with that. And this is why
[1:06:10] when God is looking upon upon all of all
[1:06:13] all of that of the needs, then we can
[1:06:16] look and realize that with these things
[1:06:18] that God himself, he is ministering
[1:06:21] according to what you and I have need of
[1:06:24] at that time and motive and objective
[1:06:26] has a great deal to do with them. Sure.
[1:06:29] Now this might this might stump you for
[1:06:31] a moment. Brother Bram says Balum had a
[1:06:34] gift of faith.
[1:06:36] Brother Brandon said, "Many have gifts
[1:06:38] of healing and they use it and they
[1:06:42] operate with it, but not according to
[1:06:44] the word of God and they'll give an
[1:06:47] account for it." And yet it's it's
[1:06:50] you've seen people heal. Listen,
[1:06:52] friends, there's not it isn't like, "Oh,
[1:06:54] this is all true in here of healings and
[1:06:57] there's all false out there." Listen,
[1:06:59] there's many healings taking place.
[1:07:01] That's not something that's just a just
[1:07:04] a part of the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:08] You can look up testimonies and things
[1:07:10] even on YouTube. You have people you
[1:07:12] work with, Baptist people. You have
[1:07:14] others and all of a sudden here there's
[1:07:16] healing that's taking place in their
[1:07:18] life.
[1:07:20] Is that right?
[1:07:22] And you can find where you know times
[1:07:24] where people chase after certain things
[1:07:27] but and and and and and the supernatural
[1:07:30] is always something that uh you know can
[1:07:33] really attract people but what is it
[1:07:36] trying to take me to right after all the
[1:07:41] miracles. I want to know what you're
[1:07:44] teaching. Yes. Amen. There you go. Amen.
[1:07:47] Because when I hear your teaching,
[1:07:48] that's what lets me know whether it's
[1:07:50] true or it's false. The miracles can be
[1:07:54] right on the dot and it's the Holy
[1:07:56] Spirit doing it. But it's the teaching.
[1:08:00] Rapture is not by miracles. Rapture
[1:08:04] comes by the teaching of the word
[1:08:06] building the people in the faith of this
[1:08:09] hour.
[1:08:12] Are you hearing me? There'll be many
[1:08:14] that are left behind when the rapture
[1:08:16] comes outside of the seal of the living
[1:08:19] God. Why? They've trusted in miracles.
[1:08:24] That was never ever to be the place of
[1:08:28] our rest. Our rest is in him and he is
[1:08:32] the word. Amen.
[1:08:36] That's why the prophet tells us in the
[1:08:38] message prisoner many other places.
[1:08:41] Don't ever judge your life by how many
[1:08:44] miracles you have.
[1:08:46] You judge your life by the word and what
[1:08:49] is the fruits of the spirit coming out.
[1:08:54] Let me finish this this this
[1:08:56] quote. Some of them say, "Brother
[1:08:58] Brando, will you lay your hands upon me
[1:09:00] that I can get the gift of healing?"
[1:09:02] Brother Ram said, 'I wish I could.
[1:09:06] Sure.
[1:09:07] I mean, Moses would that everybody
[1:09:09] prophesied.
[1:09:11] You see what Brother Ram's thinking
[1:09:12] about and what they're thinking about
[1:09:14] two different things. Brother Ram's
[1:09:15] thinking about I wish I could because
[1:09:17] then has healing itself going forth. I I
[1:09:21] don't want to, you know, speak in and
[1:09:22] try to step in and try to discern their
[1:09:24] thoughts or something, but you know, you
[1:09:26] you can't help but wonder why do they
[1:09:28] want it? Right.
[1:09:31] I just read to you out of the back of
[1:09:33] this book. Brother Ram himself never did
[1:09:36] it to get a crowd or a following.
[1:09:39] It was God making himself known that
[1:09:42] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:09:44] forever.
[1:09:46] You know why? Because you can't go in a
[1:09:48] rapture by an intellectual faith. It's
[1:09:51] got to come by a real true revealed
[1:09:55] perfect faith of almighty God.
[1:09:59] God. And that's why God through the
[1:10:01] ministry of Malachi 4 made himself alive
[1:10:06] and real in this hour. Not that we would
[1:10:08] become smarter, but that our lives would
[1:10:11] be energized by the living reality of
[1:10:14] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:10:18] Hallelujah. He said, "I'd had every one
[1:10:19] of you pass right down this line right
[1:10:21] here tonight. I'd say there wouldn't be
[1:10:23] a sick person left in Oakland in a few
[1:10:25] weeks from now. But it's not mine to
[1:10:27] give.
[1:10:32] So it's the gift of faith and it moves
[1:10:37] through.
[1:10:39] It's not this possession, that
[1:10:41] possession. It's one direct line. Right?
[1:10:47] Now listen. Look at this real carefully.
[1:10:50] The manifestation of the spirit is given
[1:10:54] to every man to profit all. For to one
[1:10:59] is given by the spirit the word of
[1:11:01] wisdom, to another the word of
[1:11:04] knowledge, to another
[1:11:06] faith by the same
[1:11:09] spirit. Now, Brother Brown says a gift
[1:11:13] of faith is not something you take and
[1:11:16] do something with. A gift of faith is
[1:11:20] you just get yourself out of the way.
[1:11:23] The gift is getting your own self out of
[1:11:26] the way.
[1:11:28] Now he goes on to says gifts are to
[1:11:31] edify. These are key key importance
[1:11:33] here. Important points tonight. Gifts
[1:11:36] are to edify. Their additions
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:42] now. Every one of
[1:11:45] us, we know we know what it means to
[1:11:47] have a main course and to have side
[1:11:50] dishes.
[1:11:52] Right.
[1:11:53] You just pray that the main course is
[1:11:55] good.
[1:11:57] You know, I don't like when the soup
[1:12:00] bowl gets put as main course. Soup bowl
[1:12:02] belongs as addition.
[1:12:05] That's me. There you go. That was not
[1:12:07] spiritual. That was just
[1:12:10] now I don't mind some soups and but
[1:12:12] anyhow, the gifts are additions. Gifts
[1:12:15] are not the main course.
[1:12:17] In other words, we realize we do not
[1:12:20] come to the house of God to see wonder
[1:12:22] what gifts are going to be manifest
[1:12:24] tonight.
[1:12:25] We don't despise any of the gifts. It's
[1:12:27] as they're needed. But we don't we don't
[1:12:30] have to have a manifestation of gifts to
[1:12:32] have had church. Amen.
[1:12:36] Right. Because a lot of the in many of
[1:12:39] these things, there's really only one
[1:12:40] sometimes that could be seen and even
[1:12:43] noticed.
[1:12:47] We're not against the gifts. They belong
[1:12:49] in the church. They should be in the
[1:12:51] church. That's right. Under the
[1:12:52] direction of the Holy Spirit. But notice
[1:12:55] it's given by God. They are additions.
[1:12:59] And notice here is the first and only
[1:13:02] foundation for divine healing or
[1:13:04] anything from God is the Bible. If you
[1:13:07] get off that, you're out of God's will.
[1:13:11] So he's putting it what is the word is
[1:13:14] to have the complete preeminence. Gifts
[1:13:17] though are to edify. They are additions
[1:13:20] and let me say it necessary additions.
[1:13:24] Brother Brandon says, "The only thing
[1:13:25] that is for you is to stimulate faith of
[1:13:29] the people that they might see God's
[1:13:32] willingness to heal the people." And
[1:13:34] now, as far as it comes to healing, it's
[1:13:37] your faith in God. So, it's not the
[1:13:40] person who's praying for you. It's not
[1:13:43] Well, if the prophet was here, it the
[1:13:45] brother laid it very clearly. It's your
[1:13:47] faith in God. You see, what Satan would
[1:13:51] like to do is get us looking over here
[1:13:53] and you chase this and you chase that.
[1:13:56] And I'm not going to say that a person
[1:13:58] couldn't chase this and maybe they
[1:13:59] wouldn't be healed. And then from there,
[1:14:01] now listen, I'm never going to take
[1:14:03] anything away from anybody because if
[1:14:05] they get help there and then God brings
[1:14:08] them up to realize that they don't have
[1:14:10] to travel clear across the country, God
[1:14:13] is an everpresent help in the time of
[1:14:16] trouble. Amen. Are you with me? That's
[1:14:19] why the prophet said after I leave this
[1:14:22] city, he said God hasn't left. Healing
[1:14:25] hasn't left. He said your pastor is
[1:14:27] equipped to pray for the sick. And then
[1:14:29] he takes it from the platform and he
[1:14:31] says, as a matter of fact, any son or
[1:14:34] daughter of God is equipped to pray for
[1:14:37] the sick.
[1:14:40] See, this message never come to be it's
[1:14:42] just lift me up and and come. No, no.
[1:14:45] This message come to bring you and I to
[1:14:47] the awareness of who we are. The rights
[1:14:50] that belong to you and I as the children
[1:14:52] of the living God. I tell you, brush
[1:14:55] your weapon off. Your weapon is still
[1:14:57] powerful in the hand of faith.
[1:15:02] My is to see God's willingness.
[1:15:05] Stimulate faith. See God's willingness
[1:15:08] to heal the people. Amen. And it says
[1:15:11] your pastor can anoint you with oil in
[1:15:13] the church and you have faith in God,
[1:15:14] it'll bring results. God's the healer.
[1:15:18] No man's a healer. God's the healer.
[1:15:21] These gifts are only to show what God's
[1:15:25] attitude towards the people. Oh, I'm
[1:15:28] glad, aren't you?
[1:15:30] That God would say, you know what? I
[1:15:33] don't want you getting the wrong idea.
[1:15:34] So, I'm going to make sure you know what
[1:15:36] my attitude is. Amen. So the gifts are
[1:15:39] God's attitude to the people.
[1:15:42] That's the kind of attitude I like.
[1:15:45] These gifts are to show you what God's
[1:15:47] attitude towards the people to get you
[1:15:49] people back to believe in God. Cuz if
[1:15:53] you haven't got enough faith to believe
[1:15:55] for your sick body, how you going to
[1:15:56] have faith enough for the rapture?
[1:16:00] Now remember, don't don't let the devil
[1:16:03] get on your shoulder right now and just
[1:16:04] tell him he ain't welcome here. Just let
[1:16:06] him know that the seat next to you was
[1:16:08] not so he could sit down. Well, brother
[1:16:10] Samuel, my mind's going right now. Do I
[1:16:12] have the faith that's needed? Let me
[1:16:14] tell you, look where you're sitting here
[1:16:15] tonight.
[1:16:17] You came here by faith. Amen. Are you
[1:16:20] hearing me? And let me just tell you how
[1:16:22] the prophet said in the church age book.
[1:16:24] He said, "The grace that you need, the
[1:16:26] faith that you need will be given to you
[1:16:29] in the hour that you have need of it."
[1:16:32] Abraham did not go into the mountain and
[1:16:34] say with a looking glass, "Yep, I
[1:16:36] already see the ram up there. Boy, I can
[1:16:38] walk with faith." He walked as a
[1:16:41] believer all the way up that mountain.
[1:16:44] Why? It was a faith that was pulsating
[1:16:47] in his heart. And God gave, as the
[1:16:50] prophet said, supreme faith for the
[1:16:52] supreme hour. Yes, sir. And God himself
[1:16:55] will supply to you and I the faith that
[1:16:58] you and I have need of for what? for
[1:17:01] whatever we face and for the rapture.
[1:17:03] Let me just tell you something. He is
[1:17:05] Jehovah Gyra.
[1:17:09] Brethren and sister, what do you think
[1:17:11] it's going to do when we see our loved
[1:17:14] ones? Oh, hallelujah. What do you think
[1:17:18] it's going to do? It's going to
[1:17:19] stimulate your faith.
[1:17:23] When we see our loved ones, then direct
[1:17:26] quote, you'll know your change is on its
[1:17:29] way.
[1:17:35] s.
[1:17:36] Hallelujah. God's got an order to
[1:17:38] stimulate faith, don't he? So, we notice
[1:17:41] that this, you know, this in itself is
[1:17:45] individual faith. Now, just look at this
[1:17:48] just just a few moments to lay this in.
[1:17:50] It's our our own faith, our individual
[1:17:52] faith. Now I'm I'm coming I'm laying
[1:17:54] this background on a gift of faith. But
[1:17:57] remember it's it's individual faith.
[1:17:59] Brother Bram talks about you know how
[1:18:01] that you know the Lord Jesus here he was
[1:18:04] he's already before the foundation of
[1:18:06] the world when when Isaiah saw him. How
[1:18:10] many knows when Isaiah and Isaiah 53
[1:18:12] when you read Isaiah 53 it didn't say he
[1:18:15] will he will be he will be wounded. It
[1:18:19] said he was
[1:18:21] wounded.
[1:18:22] He was bruised.
[1:18:25] Now, you
[1:18:26] know, you don't have to be the sharpest
[1:18:29] pencil on the box to know that's past
[1:18:30] tense.
[1:18:32] Isaiah was caught up to see an event
[1:18:36] that was settled in the mind of God.
[1:18:38] Revelations 13:8, the lamb who was slain
[1:18:42] in the mind of God before the foundation
[1:18:45] of the world. Is that right? So now when
[1:18:50] that is rehearsed of not us going back
[1:18:52] to where in God's mind but now what God
[1:18:55] had in his mind it was manifested at
[1:18:58] Calvary and that same Lord Jesus is
[1:19:01] manifesting himself to be the same
[1:19:03] yesterday today and forever. Then
[1:19:05] brother Brandon said when you accept it
[1:19:07] Jesus don't come and die again for
[1:19:09] somebody. He just died once. We accept
[1:19:11] our salvation. That's his finished works
[1:19:14] at Calvary. Then now by his stripes
[1:19:16] we're healed. Why? We know he doesn't
[1:19:18] come down and heal us each time. It
[1:19:20] takes your own individual faith. Amen.
[1:19:25] And let me come back to my point. It
[1:19:27] slipped my mind, but let me come back to
[1:19:28] my point. The reason don't let the devil
[1:19:31] get on that bench next to you is because
[1:19:33] it is not even about what you think
[1:19:35] about your own faith.
[1:19:39] I could give you quote I could stand
[1:19:41] here the rest of the night give you
[1:19:42] quote after quote where the prophet
[1:19:44] saying you were just healed moments ago.
[1:19:46] You didn't think you had enough faith.
[1:19:49] So, it shows faith is not a conscious
[1:19:52] matter. Faith is a subconscious matter.
[1:19:55] Boy, I'm glad that God looks on that.
[1:19:57] I'm glad God don't look on our mind and
[1:19:59] say, "Man, they don't even know if they
[1:20:01] got enough faith." But God is looking
[1:20:03] down on the inside.
[1:20:10] Bram said, "I've heard people talk about
[1:20:12] gifts of faith and gifts of healing."
[1:20:13] Sure. The Bible speaks of gifts of
[1:20:15] healing. But what is this gift of
[1:20:16] healing? It's a a power being given to a
[1:20:20] man to heal another. No sir. There's not
[1:20:24] one man could heal another.
[1:20:27] So a gift of healing which actually
[1:20:30] you'll see as we go on works in
[1:20:32] conjunction with a gift of faith. That
[1:20:34] it is not that this man himself has the
[1:20:38] power to heal somebody. Amen. It's faith
[1:20:43] moving that stimulates the faith of the
[1:20:45] individual to receive what God's already
[1:20:49] done. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Now, watch
[1:20:53] this. Here stands the Lord Jesus in the
[1:20:56] midst of where he come from. I mean,
[1:21:00] he's on he's got homefield advantage
[1:21:02] here. This is where this is where he
[1:21:04] come from.
[1:21:05] But remember when all of them all those
[1:21:08] reasonings in people's minds here he
[1:21:10] stood. Now think about it. This is the
[1:21:12] mighty God
[1:21:14] and he did not many mighty works there
[1:21:17] because of their unbelief.
[1:21:21] I want to just ask you something. You
[1:21:22] think Jesus couldn't have done some
[1:21:24] things? He could have. But you see, you
[1:21:27] got to have something to sustain after
[1:21:30] the work has been done. Right. If
[1:21:32] something's just taken off and unbelief
[1:21:34] remains, it is a doorway that invites it
[1:21:38] right back into that life. So the here
[1:21:41] stands the Lord Jesus. And this is why
[1:21:43] you see how faith healing the principle
[1:21:46] is based on our belief. This is why God
[1:21:51] works to build our faith in the
[1:21:54] promises. Build our faith up. And this
[1:21:57] is why when the Lord Jesus stood there,
[1:21:59] he couldn't do he couldn't do many
[1:22:01] mighty works because of their unbelief.
[1:22:06] I just want to say, God, search me out,
[1:22:08] Lord. Search me. I I don't want I I
[1:22:11] don't want him to be turned away. I want
[1:22:14] him to always be welcome.
[1:22:17] God, if there's anything that would
[1:22:18] hinder it all, Lord, show me. I don't
[1:22:20] want it in my life. Amen. I don't want
[1:22:23] you to be hindered. There's too many
[1:22:24] needs among us. Amen. That's true.
[1:22:30] Let me just run through a few
[1:22:31] scriptures. Here stands the
[1:22:34] centurion that had asked Jesus just
[1:22:36] speak the word. And Jesus said to him,
[1:22:39] "I have not found so great faith. No,
[1:22:42] not in Israel." His individual faith.
[1:22:46] He heard, he knew about the Lord Jesus,
[1:22:50] and he believed. Yes. Right. Now here
[1:22:54] here you find then another one when
[1:22:57] remember her daughter was in need of
[1:22:59] healing and this and this little lady
[1:23:03] Jesus turns about and sees her and said
[1:23:05] daughter be of good comfort thy faith
[1:23:08] hath made thee whole. Now you say well
[1:23:11] it it was her faith but what was it that
[1:23:14] stirred her faith. You see what what
[1:23:17] faith did is brought to her what faith
[1:23:20] was calling for. Yes. Yes. Oh my.
[1:23:25] Hallelujah. Notice in here in Matthew
[1:23:28] chapter 9 as Jesus here is speaking uh
[1:23:31] to the blind men that had come and he
[1:23:33] said to them, "You believe I'm able to
[1:23:34] do this?" They said, "Yay, Lord." See,
[1:23:36] you believe I'm able to do it? Yay. Then
[1:23:39] he touched their eyes according to your
[1:23:42] faith. Be it unto you. Right.
[1:23:46] Now, let me just stop here just for a
[1:23:47] moment,
[1:23:50] God. If you can really see it, God is
[1:23:53] laboring and working in our lives
[1:23:56] service after service. Oh yes. Oh yes.
[1:24:00] But sometimes the things that when you
[1:24:04] and everyone everyone has to evaluate
[1:24:06] this that you understand God's trying to
[1:24:09] build our faith in the word.
[1:24:13] But what's important is is that this is
[1:24:16] not a microwave. That's right. It's not
[1:24:20] instant mashed potatoes.
[1:24:23] And sometimes where God is working to
[1:24:25] build our faith in the promises of God
[1:24:28] and then we go right back out the doors
[1:24:31] and return to the same old things that
[1:24:34] actually deplete. Amen. And strip out of
[1:24:38] us what God has been instilling in us.
[1:24:42] And then we show back up in the next
[1:24:43] service. Lord, fill me up.
[1:24:47] instead of build on what you laid in.
[1:24:51] Amen. We want to this is a building. He
[1:24:54] said on this on this rock I will build
[1:24:56] my church. I tell you what, if I had to
[1:24:59] keep when they were building my house
[1:25:01] that the other house that we had
[1:25:02] purchased before, if I showed up there
[1:25:04] every day and and they were laying a
[1:25:06] foundation, then the next day, the next
[1:25:08] week, I come along, they're laying the
[1:25:10] foundation again, laying the foundation.
[1:25:13] I'm going to ask them, "How many times
[1:25:15] you going to lay this foundation?
[1:25:17] Amen. That's right. Come on. I know
[1:25:20] that's simple, but friends, listen. God
[1:25:22] is working. Amen. You, brother Samuel,
[1:25:26] you say, "Do you get discouraged at what
[1:25:28] you see?" Let me just tell you
[1:25:29] something. It's not going to be my human
[1:25:31] efforts. It hasn't been with any of
[1:25:34] these young people. It hasn't been me
[1:25:36] coming to them and pushing them. Hey,
[1:25:38] you need to get the Holy Ghost. Hey, you
[1:25:40] need to I don't do that. Amen. You know
[1:25:43] why? I got confidence in God that God
[1:25:46] has to alert it. I don't want them to be
[1:25:48] confused
[1:25:50] because listen, they've got to rest
[1:25:52] where they're at right now and keep
[1:25:55] moving forward. Amen. It's like when a
[1:25:57] woman gives birth, is it
[1:25:59] separated? Is it just, "Hey honey, my
[1:26:02] water broke next week.
[1:26:05] We'll be going for dinner tomorrow."
[1:26:06] When that water breaks, that's the
[1:26:08] process birth has started in. You see,
[1:26:12] birth is not it's not segmented parts.
[1:26:17] It's a process. Amen. Water, blood,
[1:26:20] spirit. It's all the work of the Holy
[1:26:24] Spirit. Are you with me? Sure, the Holy
[1:26:27] Spirit will minister. He calls things
[1:26:29] out in our life to encourage you and I,
[1:26:31] to strengthen you and I. He does that.
[1:26:33] But I've got confidence that God knows
[1:26:36] exactly how to speak to our lives. Now,
[1:26:38] listen, maybe you maybe that's how you
[1:26:40] were spoke to. That's fine. But your
[1:26:42] experience is not something that becomes
[1:26:44] the pattern for somebody else.
[1:26:47] Are you hearing me? God deals with us as
[1:26:49] individual. This is why, listen friends,
[1:26:51] this is why many times as fruit
[1:26:53] inspectors, we've been dead wrong.
[1:26:55] You've seen fruit all out here and all
[1:26:57] of a sudden after years go by, you're
[1:26:59] like, "Where did that fruit go?" And
[1:27:01] then somebody else that maybe you looked
[1:27:03] at and all of a sudden fruit's coming
[1:27:05] out of their life and it was there the
[1:27:07] whole time.
[1:27:09] Hallelujah. Oh, may God help us. Well,
[1:27:12] Brother Samuel, what must I do? Be a
[1:27:15] believer. Be a real mature Christian who
[1:27:18] prays for one another. Be an
[1:27:20] encouragement to one another. Encourage
[1:27:22] someone along the way. That's what we
[1:27:24] can do.
[1:27:26] That's so good. Where in the world did
[1:27:30] that come
[1:27:32] from according to your faith? Notice
[1:27:35] Jesus goes on to say with this little
[1:27:37] woman say she came up and remember she
[1:27:40] had need and Jesus said great is thy
[1:27:44] faith. It'll be unto thee even as thou
[1:27:48] wilt and thy daughter. Her daughter was
[1:27:49] made whole from that very hour. Now here
[1:27:51] they come here here come these uh lepers
[1:27:55] to the Lord Jesus. And they said to him,
[1:27:58] now remember when we're coming, we're
[1:27:59] approaching the word cuz not a man can
[1:28:02] do this. This is the Lord
[1:28:05] Jesus. This was the God prophet. If thou
[1:28:08] wilt, thou can make me clean. Look at
[1:28:10] their faith expressing it was settled.
[1:28:14] It was settled. You You say, "What's
[1:28:15] that like?" Well, that's like the
[1:28:16] prophet telling us in desperation and in
[1:28:18] other other services. He said, "Don't
[1:28:21] come up here in the prayer line and say,
[1:28:23] well, maybe God will give me the Holy
[1:28:24] Ghost." He said, "Just stay in your seat
[1:28:26] cuz God ain't going to do nothing." All
[1:28:28] right. You see, you can't come up here
[1:28:30] saying, "Well, I wonder." That's not
[1:28:32] faith.
[1:28:34] Amen. But when you come, you must
[1:28:36] approach by faith. Brother Samuel, I
[1:28:38] want scripture. How much scripture you
[1:28:40] want? Let me give you another place in
[1:28:42] the scripture. When they went back to
[1:28:44] Jerusalem, they didn't go back sad and
[1:28:47] weary. The Bible said when they when
[1:28:49] Jesus had breathed upon them and said,
[1:28:52] "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." The Bible
[1:28:54] said after they saw him ascend, there
[1:28:57] was 120 out of the 500 that went back to
[1:29:01] the upper room with joy thanking God.
[1:29:05] Why? The promise is certain. The Holy
[1:29:08] Ghost belongs to me. The promise is to
[1:29:10] me. They went rejoicing.
[1:29:14] That's why you're not approaching God as
[1:29:15] a beggar. You're not a beggar become a
[1:29:18] son. You always were a son and daughter
[1:29:20] of God. And God's trying to minister to
[1:29:23] you what really belongs to you. Healing
[1:29:27] belongs to you. Deliverance belongs to
[1:29:29] you.
[1:29:34] If thou wilt, thou can make me clean.
[1:29:36] Jesus said, I will be thou clean. He
[1:29:39] said in Mark 9:23, "If thou can't
[1:29:41] believe,
[1:29:43] all things are possible to him that
[1:29:45] believeth." What did the angel of the
[1:29:47] Lord tell the
[1:29:48] prophet? If you can get the people right
[1:29:51] to believe you,
[1:29:54] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:29:59] if you can get them to to believe you.
[1:30:02] You might say, "Brother Samuel, brother
[1:30:04] Brown's not here." No, but that prayer
[1:30:07] that was prayed, I'm still benefiting
[1:30:09] from it.
[1:30:12] Brother Samuel, I want scripture on
[1:30:14] that. John 17, Father, I pray for them,
[1:30:17] not for these only, but for those that
[1:30:20] will believe on me through their word.
[1:30:24] What did Jesus do? He reached back in
[1:30:27] John 17. And the prayer that was there
[1:30:30] burning in the mind of God was now being
[1:30:33] echoed out upon earth. The intercession
[1:30:36] of our lamb was calling out for our
[1:30:39] fellowship. Father, grant this one
[1:30:42] thing, that where I am, they may be
[1:30:45] there also.
[1:30:49] Glory.
[1:30:53] Oh my my. But I like how this I like how
[1:30:56] this brother, he was honest, you know. I
[1:31:00] don't know to you, to me, I appreciate
[1:31:01] that. I appreciate how honest he was.
[1:31:04] The father of the child would cried out
[1:31:06] with tears, "Lord, I believe, but help
[1:31:08] thou my unbelief." Amen. In other words,
[1:31:10] Lord, anywhere what I'm lacking,
[1:31:13] stimulate. I need my faith stimulated.
[1:31:16] Kind of like what we talked about them
[1:31:17] jumper cables on Sunday. God knows how
[1:31:19] to stimulate your faith and my faith.
[1:31:24] And many times God will use the gift of
[1:31:27] faith
[1:31:29] to do that.
[1:31:32] That is so good. Praise the Lord.
[1:31:36] And sometimes that bolt, that surge,
[1:31:39] Brother Bram tells us, he says, "That's
[1:31:40] your body, that theophony," he calls it
[1:31:43] glorified body. It's actually theophony
[1:31:44] body. He said, "May it give them a
[1:31:46] charge this morning."
[1:31:54] Glory be to God in the highest. Notice
[1:31:56] he said, "Thy faith to the blind man
[1:31:59] hath made thee whole." Brother Bram says
[1:32:01] that same Jesus is here tonight. If I
[1:32:04] can let my faith loose to his promise,
[1:32:08] then he'll come right back and do the
[1:32:10] same thing. If you can let your faith
[1:32:14] loose to the promise,
[1:32:19] brother letting his faith
[1:32:21] loose, us letting our faith loose. So
[1:32:25] once again, gifts what are given to do
[1:32:28] what? stimulate our faith, to show God's
[1:32:33] willingness to
[1:32:35] heal, to see God's attitude towards the
[1:32:38] people.
[1:32:40] Just so you know, if you ever want these
[1:32:41] slides, just see me. I just I drop them
[1:32:43] to you so quick.
[1:32:48] I mean, I don't to me if it benefits you
[1:32:50] and I I mean, I I've got it if you you
[1:32:52] want it. I mean, but you know, cuz I
[1:32:55] know sometimes it's hard to write
[1:32:57] everything down, but but notice, brother
[1:32:59] Ram, watch how he puts this. Most of the
[1:33:02] ministers who preach divine healing are
[1:33:05] usually, all that I've ever met, are
[1:33:08] great teachers of the word. Some of them
[1:33:11] just have a great powerful faith. You
[1:33:15] probably got some of them coming to your
[1:33:16] mind right now that stood right here.
[1:33:19] just lay hands on the people and scream
[1:33:22] out and make the enemy leave them. All
[1:33:25] right.
[1:33:28] Now, that's faith. That's a gift of
[1:33:32] faith. And what do you mean by powerful,
[1:33:35] forceful? I mean, sometimes you look at
[1:33:37] it and here God sends in that minister,
[1:33:41] that
[1:33:42] evangelist. Sometimes it'll work with
[1:33:44] them that way. Sometimes God will use
[1:33:46] I've had it where I've been in in in
[1:33:48] services. Listen, I I I'm a pastor.
[1:33:51] That's what the gift in my life. But
[1:33:52] I've had things where God would would
[1:33:54] lead me on on a certain service or or
[1:33:56] things. Maybe it's on deliverance and
[1:33:59] maybe it's dealing with healing because,
[1:34:01] you know, when I go out, I'm not out
[1:34:02] there to preach doctrine and get, you
[1:34:04] know, mess mess around with different
[1:34:05] things, but you just always want to be
[1:34:06] sensitive to the needs of the people.
[1:34:08] But a lot of times where you'll find as
[1:34:10] though that forceful and and that that
[1:34:13] of faith, in other words, where it's
[1:34:15] that that kind of a service where no is
[1:34:18] not the option.
[1:34:20] That's good. It's almost the kind of
[1:34:23] service that makes you want to rip up
[1:34:25] the doctor's reports.
[1:34:28] And sometimes we'll look at it and say,
[1:34:30] "That's the kind of service I want all
[1:34:32] the time." But you see, it's on a
[1:34:34] asneeded basis. There you go.
[1:34:38] True. This is why even with the ministry
[1:34:41] and things I you know I I that's that's
[1:34:42] why I believe with even praying on
[1:34:44] ministry to have come in. I'm not
[1:34:46] picking of whose favorites and this. I
[1:34:48] pray God that you and if there's
[1:34:50] somebody that I don't know that could be
[1:34:52] a blessing to the people of God then
[1:34:54] Lord let our paths cross and also that
[1:34:57] God would lay upon our hearts what's
[1:35:00] needed at the time. Because I know if I
[1:35:02] left this up and we just put out a
[1:35:04] survey, there's some of you would pick
[1:35:05] your favorite preacher all the time.
[1:35:08] Yeah. Is that right? That's right.
[1:35:11] You've got to have a well balanced diet
[1:35:13] and God knows just what we need. There's
[1:35:15] times God might have a man come in and
[1:35:17] preach and it'll be deliverance services
[1:35:20] at that time. Why? It is the needs of
[1:35:23] the people at that moment.
[1:35:25] You believe God will give that
[1:35:27] direction? I believe that.
[1:35:29] Now notice how this will happen. This
[1:35:31] that's a gift of faith. They believe
[1:35:33] they're going to receive what they ask
[1:35:35] for. That's the reason they take a hold
[1:35:37] of it in that manner. I I think of
[1:35:38] brother Joel Forny. I think of brother
[1:35:40] Cadre Digs. You know who else I think
[1:35:42] of? Brother Daryl Ward. Right. You look
[1:35:44] at how their ministries are and
[1:35:46] sometimes you know what then sometimes
[1:35:48] those ministries and it just shows
[1:35:50] sometimes the lack of our understanding
[1:35:52] that sometimes where individuals say oh
[1:35:53] you know that's not real deep. Well
[1:35:55] that's not what was needed for that
[1:35:57] service.
[1:35:59] It's not what was needed. There's needs
[1:36:01] for healing at times. There's needs for
[1:36:03] prayer lines. I don't care how whatever
[1:36:06] choice that God wants to use, but
[1:36:08] whatever avenue is so that we can be
[1:36:11] well and walk on. Amen. And I thank God
[1:36:15] that he's placed specialized troops in
[1:36:19] the body.
[1:36:21] Yes, he has.
[1:36:25] Hallelujah. Yes, they believe that
[1:36:28] they're going to receive what they ask
[1:36:29] for and that's the reason they take a
[1:36:31] hold of it in that manner. And I admire
[1:36:33] a man like that. Man like Oral Roberts,
[1:36:35] aa Allen, many of the men on the field
[1:36:37] who has great ministry ministerial gifts
[1:36:40] of the spirit to move in faith. All
[1:36:42] right. Now, Brother Bram's calling
[1:36:45] calling some men out and I won't dive
[1:36:47] into some of that tonight, but you know,
[1:36:49] when you begin to look at this of how
[1:36:52] that some of those men and you would
[1:36:54] think of how things end up, you know,
[1:36:56] turning around with a Allen and so forth
[1:36:58] and yet brother Bram would tell us over
[1:36:59] and over, you hear it on the message.
[1:37:00] Brother Bram said, "If I could if I
[1:37:02] could preach like aa Allen, I wouldn't
[1:37:04] have to have those prayer lines." Why?
[1:37:07] because he he was able by the word to
[1:37:10] build the people's faith in the word.
[1:37:12] Now, now you might say I'm a little bit
[1:37:14] biased, but I'll tell you what, this
[1:37:17] message builds my faith.
[1:37:23] Brother Brandon wasn't a braggard.
[1:37:26] That's fitting of the scripture, isn't
[1:37:27] it? The Bible said when the Spirit of
[1:37:29] truth has come, he will not speak of
[1:37:32] himself or or glorify the vessel he's
[1:37:36] working through.
[1:37:38] [Laughter]
[1:37:40] That's so good. Woo. Glory be to God.
[1:37:44] So, it's building faith.
[1:37:47] My my my God. I'm moving along. Moving
[1:37:50] along. Now, watch this. Building faith.
[1:37:52] This is this is key. Remember, brother
[1:37:53] says, I found those with the gift of
[1:37:55] healing. gift of faith is what I'm
[1:37:57] dealing with tonight. And those work, it
[1:37:59] works hand in hand. But the gift of
[1:38:01] faith, Brother Brham says they end up
[1:38:02] being they're real good teachers of the
[1:38:04] word. In another place, he says, they've
[1:38:06] got away with ministering. They can
[1:38:08] corner the devil.
[1:38:11] And watch how brother Bram, this is why
[1:38:13] every service is so unique. This is one
[1:38:16] of the things that even as a minister
[1:38:18] that you learn, I mean those that would
[1:38:20] be with a minister. Brother Bram's
[1:38:22] talking about the in the kinsman
[1:38:23] redeemer. He had just preached the
[1:38:25] previous morning on a service that was
[1:38:28] bringing conviction to the sinner's
[1:38:30] heart. And brother Bram was wanting to
[1:38:33] do a prayer line in that service, but he
[1:38:35] realized when that service turned and it
[1:38:36] was bringing conviction to the people's
[1:38:38] heart and sinners were repenting,
[1:38:40] brother Bram says that's not a very good
[1:38:42] subject to speak on when you're going to
[1:38:43] call a prayer line. So in other words,
[1:38:46] it's very very much so time sometimes
[1:38:49] when I've been even in other places
[1:38:51] maybe sometimes the pastor or they'll
[1:38:53] kind of maybe ask me and say what what
[1:38:55] direction do you think this going to go?
[1:38:56] Do you do you think well you know
[1:38:57] sometimes you don't know how the end of
[1:38:58] the service is going to go but if I look
[1:38:59] at the thought and I can look at the
[1:39:01] thought and say I I think it's going to
[1:39:03] be a thought that's really going to it's
[1:39:04] going to minister where there needs
[1:39:05] probably going to be prayer and things
[1:39:06] like that afterwards. I don't have to
[1:39:08] make it go that way but you can see the
[1:39:10] direction. The reason a pastor would ask
[1:39:11] that is because they want to know, do I
[1:39:13] make announcements afterwards or before?
[1:39:16] That's beautiful. See how those things
[1:39:18] it's just wisdom working within it
[1:39:20] because we don't want to we want to
[1:39:21] hinder that. So notice, brother Ram
[1:39:23] says, you know, that that wasn't a very
[1:39:25] good subject to call a prayer line on.
[1:39:26] You've got to build people's faith to
[1:39:28] prayer and to God and to having faith.
[1:39:32] So in other words, being told how sorry
[1:39:34] we are, it's not going to be a prayer
[1:39:36] line
[1:39:37] service. how much we let down. Well, I
[1:39:40] tell you, I didn't see very many people
[1:39:42] going up and asking for healing. The
[1:39:45] service did not go that direction.
[1:39:48] See, for healing, it will build the
[1:39:50] people's faith in that place.
[1:39:55] So, he said, I told brother Neville to
[1:39:57] announce I'd be speaking this morning on
[1:39:58] another subject, building faith in
[1:40:00] people to God. The other words, you
[1:40:03] know, he said, rebuking people for not
[1:40:05] keeping the commandments of God. This
[1:40:07] way it's building people around to have
[1:40:09] faith in God. So everything has its
[1:40:12] place. Cuz you see, if this wisdom isn't
[1:40:14] caught, then the minister will be turned
[1:40:15] around rebuking the people for not
[1:40:17] coming for prayer for healing. What is
[1:40:20] that? Confusion.
[1:40:22] Then the people already feel lower than
[1:40:24] dirt.
[1:40:26] Amen. And now they're being chastised
[1:40:28] because they're not doing something. Oh,
[1:40:31] aren't you glad for the wisdom and
[1:40:32] knowledge of God? Aren't you glad for
[1:40:35] this? I'll tell you what, real and
[1:40:37] ministers, they we don't got to go to no
[1:40:38] training. You meet God on the back side
[1:40:40] of the desert and God all the way
[1:40:42] through the message. I've got files of
[1:40:43] things to how God will use and direct a
[1:40:46] ministry. You talking about training and
[1:40:47] teaching. This is real wisdom right
[1:40:49] here, right, brother? Perfect faith. We
[1:40:52] want to speak to you upon faith and a
[1:40:54] different type of faith. Perfect faith.
[1:40:55] That's a great thing. Now, faith, we're
[1:40:57] told in the Bible, faith cometh by
[1:40:58] hearing. Now, you can't be saved without
[1:41:00] faith. And faith is something that you
[1:41:02] have to believe it's there. That really
[1:41:04] nothing else will declare it's there but
[1:41:06] faith. They said, "I'm trying to bring
[1:41:08] faith to you so that you can be ready."
[1:41:12] Hallelujah. For this prayer line, Amen.
[1:41:15] It's kind of hard to come through a
[1:41:16] prayer line up here,
[1:41:19] but there's time. Listen, the Bible said
[1:41:21] there's a time to weep,
[1:41:24] time to mourn. See, there's seasons for
[1:41:26] it. That's why that's why every service
[1:41:28] isn't a come on up and get saved once
[1:41:31] again. That's not if there's needs for
[1:41:34] lives to be saved, let's get them to the
[1:41:36] altar. Let let's get them to where they
[1:41:37] meet the Lord. But it's finding what is
[1:41:40] the need for that moment. That's right.
[1:41:44] Oh my gift of faith. Let's look here
[1:41:46] real quick in the scripture. Gift of
[1:41:48] faith. Acts chapter 3.
[1:42:00] Everybody all right?
[1:42:04] There's about 75% of you.
[1:42:08] Now, I'm not going to read all this. You
[1:42:10] can you you you're familiar with this
[1:42:11] account. You can read it when you get
[1:42:12] home. But in Acts chapter
[1:42:15] 3, remember here's Peter and
[1:42:18] John, they they they go into the temple
[1:42:21] in the hour of prayer and they see this
[1:42:22] man who's who's sitting there. He's
[1:42:25] never been able to walk. That man has
[1:42:27] went out there. He's planning on begging
[1:42:30] that day, right? And when Peter and them
[1:42:33] walked by, he you know, he was looking
[1:42:34] for arms, right? He didn't set down that
[1:42:38] day with a vision. I'm going to be
[1:42:40] healed. Right. Right.
[1:42:44] But he had faith. Are you hearing me
[1:42:46] now? He had faith. Like brother Brandon
[1:42:48] says, it took faith for you to get in
[1:42:51] your car and come to church tonight.
[1:42:53] See, faith is subconscious. You didn't
[1:42:55] think about, well, I wonder if my car if
[1:42:56] I push this button. I wonder if I wonder
[1:42:58] if you didn't do all of that. Maybe if
[1:43:00] you had problems with your car, you
[1:43:01] were. But but but if you hadn't, then it
[1:43:05] was faith. So this man is expecting to
[1:43:08] receive something. Yes. Are you with me?
[1:43:10] But we just got to get it in the right
[1:43:12] channel that he receives the right
[1:43:14] thing. That's why God will take our
[1:43:17] faith. Get it right in the right
[1:43:18] channel. Now notice in here in verse
[1:43:20] four, Peter fastening his eyes upon him
[1:43:22] and John. They said, "Look on us." And
[1:43:25] he gave heed to them expecting, the
[1:43:27] Bible said, to receive something of
[1:43:31] them. Faith.
[1:43:34] Faith. Yeah. And Peter said, "Silver and
[1:43:37] gold have I none." Amen. I mean you you
[1:43:41] know God had to be in control. Sure. Cuz
[1:43:44] you and I have walked past where they
[1:43:45] ring ring ring with the red bucket. We
[1:43:47] you and I have walked past when somebody
[1:43:49] you know holds a sign out there you know
[1:43:51] uh give me this or give me that or all
[1:43:53] the other thing you know and there you
[1:43:55] know if you give them something God
[1:43:56] bless you if you don't. We're not
[1:43:57] repeating that. But you understand
[1:44:00] they he didn't pull it pack
[1:44:03] but silver and gold have I none but such
[1:44:06] as I have. Amen. give thee in the name
[1:44:10] of Jesus Christ. Rise up and walk. What
[1:44:14] was that? A gift of faith.
[1:44:20] It moved down for that moment. That man
[1:44:24] did not on his own accord have what was
[1:44:27] needed to rise up. But here came Peter.
[1:44:32] And Peter, God had used him. And you
[1:44:35] read on in the scripture in the book of
[1:44:36] Acts where they lay people in his shadow
[1:44:39] because God operated that gift of faith
[1:44:42] through Peter's life.
[1:44:45] Such as I have I give to thee. What was
[1:44:48] it? It was the faith of God that moved
[1:44:51] down that caused that man to be made
[1:44:55] whole. Right. Peter goes on to say, you
[1:44:59] know, over here, you know, many were
[1:45:01] marveling and oh my, and Peter said in
[1:45:03] verse 12, uh, why are you marveling at
[1:45:05] this? Why are you looking so earnestly
[1:45:08] on us as though we by our own power of
[1:45:09] holiness, we made this man to walk? See
[1:45:12] what see what Peter's doing? Hey, we
[1:45:14] don't want no following. We want you to
[1:45:16] know that. Do you recognize who's here?
[1:45:18] Amen. See, that's what divine healing,
[1:45:20] that's when God sent this ministry is
[1:45:23] that we might recognize that the God who
[1:45:25] always was is right here with us.
[1:45:30] Amen. Is that right? Hallelujah. So
[1:45:32] notice this gift of faith that that
[1:45:35] operated by and here here here in in
[1:45:38] Peter's life here how he says uh Peter
[1:45:41] goes on to say um uh he says it had made
[1:45:46] by our own power holiness we had made
[1:45:48] this man to walk and he goes on to let
[1:45:50] him know verse 15 and killed the prince
[1:45:52] of life whom God hath raised from the
[1:45:54] dead whereof we are witnesses. In other
[1:45:56] words what you saw is a witness. Amen.
[1:46:00] and his and his name through faith in
[1:46:04] his name hath made this man strong whom
[1:46:07] you see and know. Yay, the faith which
[1:46:10] is by him hath given this this man
[1:46:14] perfect soundness in the presence of you
[1:46:17] all.
[1:46:19] That's so good.
[1:46:24] My my my time just running out on me.
[1:46:33] Brother Brandham said, "The great
[1:46:34] physician who is here," he said, "These
[1:46:36] signs shall follow them that believe. If
[1:46:38] they lay their hands on the sick,
[1:46:39] they'll recover." If you say to this
[1:46:41] mountain, "Be moved and don't doubt in
[1:46:42] your heart, but believe." If he, watch
[1:46:45] this, if he can create
[1:46:47] squirrels, who has no way at all or
[1:46:50] nothing there to believe, right? It's my
[1:46:54] own faith that goes and does that. my
[1:46:56] faith in what he challenged me to ask.
[1:47:00] He challenged me to ask it and I
[1:47:03] received his challenge in obedience to
[1:47:05] his word. I asked it and it appeared it.
[1:47:09] Let me kind of pause here a minute. Go
[1:47:11] back and listen to speak to this
[1:47:12] mountain preached out in Los Angeles
[1:47:14] 1959. When the prophet's going back over
[1:47:16] this account, you you you'll see the
[1:47:18] humanness in it. I I think that do I
[1:47:21] think that would do it real good because
[1:47:22] of the prophet thinking is that just
[1:47:24] something talking to my head? What's
[1:47:26] going on? And even where he's just speak
[1:47:29] to this mountain 1959. I love I love how
[1:47:31] brother Bram just brings it out and you
[1:47:33] see the humanity wrapped within there
[1:47:34] because sometimes if we're looking at
[1:47:36] all this, we don't see no humanness
[1:47:38] within it. We see just a man taking a
[1:47:40] hold of the promises of God. But if you
[1:47:42] go back and listen to 1959 Speak to this
[1:47:44] mountain in Los Angeles, California, you
[1:47:46] see that. I love that cuz what you see
[1:47:48] within it all, you see deity working
[1:47:50] right through frailty.
[1:47:53] He challenged me to ask it. I received
[1:47:55] his challenge in obedience to his word.
[1:47:56] I asked it and it appeared. God in
[1:47:58] heaven knows that's true. Can't he also
[1:48:01] heal the sick? What's he doing? Building
[1:48:04] their faith.
[1:48:06] Beautiful. If he can lift me with a
[1:48:09] faith up this way, even for the people,
[1:48:13] even if they can't climb to that
[1:48:15] bracket, if they can't do it, he can use
[1:48:18] my faith. He can lift me to that place.
[1:48:21] And I'm climbing for you. I'm believing
[1:48:24] for you. I'm speaking for you.
[1:48:28] I'm your brother standing as your
[1:48:30] brother, an intercessor, trying my best
[1:48:33] to hold you before God. I'm standing
[1:48:36] right before the white throne now
[1:48:38] pointing my finger to that bloody
[1:48:40] sacrifice there and speaking through his
[1:48:43] name that it's done. It has to happen
[1:48:46] and it has to happen. You know it's
[1:48:48] happened. I know it's happened. So do
[1:48:49] you know it's happened and it's so now
[1:48:53] watch my faith. Brother, brother Bram,
[1:48:55] here he is going. I'm believing for you.
[1:48:57] I'm stepping in for you. Now remember
[1:48:59] the individuals, it's still going to be
[1:49:01] their own individual faith, right? That
[1:49:04] will have to be moved.
[1:49:06] But here the prophet said, "I'm going to
[1:49:08] take my faith and put it with your
[1:49:11] faith." Amen. And where it might be for
[1:49:13] you trying to look through and see the
[1:49:16] deliverance, I'm going to climb up there
[1:49:18] for you. I'm going to believe for you.
[1:49:21] And I'm going to point my finger to the
[1:49:24] bloody sacrifice that says it's already
[1:49:27] done.
[1:49:29] Tell me, did not this message bring a
[1:49:31] clear vision and reality of a finished
[1:49:34] work?
[1:49:36] John the lion of the tribe of Judah hath
[1:49:39] prevailed. I turned to see a lion. I saw
[1:49:42] a lamb.
[1:49:46] Hallelujah. A lamb that had been slain.
[1:49:48] I seen a finished work. I seen a
[1:49:51] redeemer. I seen the one that meant
[1:49:53] everything. I seen myself. Hallelujah.
[1:49:57] Hallelujah. Glory.
[1:50:00] Couple couple more quotes. Brother Bram
[1:50:02] says, I talking to a sister. He said,
[1:50:04] I'll put my faith with yours and we'll
[1:50:07] lay our prayer on his altar and we'll
[1:50:10] believe it in his presence. Heavenly
[1:50:12] Father, I pray for this dear woman as
[1:50:13] she stands here tonight, crippled, all
[1:50:14] these things. Father, I pray you'll
[1:50:16] grant her recovery. God, I'm laying my
[1:50:18] prayer upon the altar with hers, placing
[1:50:23] my faith upon the sacrifice, Christ
[1:50:25] Jesus. and asking that she will be made
[1:50:29] well. Brother Ram says talking to the
[1:50:32] Lord, "My brother, knowing that life is
[1:50:35] very short for you, unless something can
[1:50:37] happen, you have cancer. Blackness is
[1:50:40] gathering over you. The devil knows that
[1:50:42] if you could just use a little faith,
[1:50:46] he's wept." That's true. Do you wonder
[1:50:49] why he wants to keep you out of the
[1:50:51] house of God
[1:50:53] trying to give us all sorts of things?
[1:50:55] Listen, you might miss the very service.
[1:50:57] You might say, "Well, Samuel, I could
[1:50:59] stream, but it's not the same as being
[1:51:01] here in this atmosphere right here. It's
[1:51:03] not the same as the presence of God."
[1:51:05] Trust me, I've been at home as well,
[1:51:06] too. It's not the same. If you give me a
[1:51:09] choice, I'll take this any day of the
[1:51:11] week because it's licks of fire that's
[1:51:15] gathered together. Where the Bible said,
[1:51:18] "Forsake not to assemble yourselves
[1:51:20] together." You know what that scripture
[1:51:22] says? It means there's going to be times
[1:51:24] where we will have to go beyond oursel,
[1:51:27] our own ideas, our own feelings,
[1:51:30] everything for what purpose? To honor
[1:51:32] God's word because he's worthy.
[1:51:37] And with that, God can
[1:51:40] supply. Maybe we just need a little bit
[1:51:43] of faith. Amen. Something to kind of
[1:51:46] jump our faith. And the devil knows if I
[1:51:48] can just get them all twisted up, right?
[1:51:51] because he knows that little bit of
[1:51:53] faith, he's whipped. That's right.
[1:51:58] Oh my. Brother Ram says here in three
[1:52:00] witnesses, he says to the lady, "You're
[1:52:02] conscious that something's going on." To
[1:52:04] the audience, that light you see in the
[1:52:06] picture is real near. The man just as
[1:52:09] certain is standing there. I've never
[1:52:10] seen him in my life, but he knows that
[1:52:12] something's taking place. It's his faith
[1:52:16] and my faith blending
[1:52:19] together by the Holy Spirit
[1:52:22] that's near.
[1:52:25] So how God would supply I'm just going
[1:52:29] to stop there. I got more to go on this
[1:52:31] right
[1:52:32] here. We'll just finish that Lord
[1:52:34] willing and going on into gifts of
[1:52:35] healing next time. But the way that all
[1:52:38] of this would work put my faith with
[1:52:42] your faith. So it isn't just we don't
[1:52:45] need your faith. No, but here my faith
[1:52:48] with your faith, right?
[1:52:52] Maybe my faith's a little bit
[1:52:54] weak and this needs this needs strength.
[1:52:57] This needs
[1:52:58] encouragement. Brother Brandham's God
[1:53:01] supplied brothers for brother Brandham.
[1:53:03] Brother Henry Gro, right? Brother
[1:53:07] Bosworth supplied different brothers for
[1:53:10] him as
[1:53:12] well because it has to be our faith. But
[1:53:15] God knows how and when to come and that
[1:53:20] gift of faith would be ministered to our
[1:53:23] lives.
[1:53:25] Listen, you've seen it happen. And it
[1:53:28] may not have been something that you
[1:53:30] even thought
[1:53:31] about, but you know what? You've seen it
[1:53:34] happen right here in services where the
[1:53:37] spirit of God has brought healing
[1:53:40] in people's
[1:53:41] lives. Gift of faith. Sometimes you've
[1:53:44] watched certain things, deliverances
[1:53:46] have come. Faith was built for
[1:53:49] deliverance.
[1:53:51] I'm not talking about just not just not
[1:53:53] just through this gift, but through the
[1:53:55] gifts that God's brought in here. And it
[1:53:57] is so it's worked in such a way to where
[1:53:59] faith has been built to that place to
[1:54:02] believe God
[1:54:04] where needs were met. I I I thought
[1:54:08] about, you know, I think about when um
[1:54:10] brother Gabriel was in the hospital with
[1:54:12] COVID
[1:54:13] there back in
[1:54:15] 2020 and uh when they he was in a
[1:54:19] serious condition,
[1:54:21] And man, I got I got the call or or let
[1:54:25] me know that he was in a serious
[1:54:26] condition. He couldn't go
[1:54:29] nowhere. So what I did is I called him.
[1:54:33] And when I called him, I didn't just
[1:54:35] say, "Let's have prayer."
[1:54:37] But I felt on my heart and I don't know
[1:54:40] how many minutes on the phone that we
[1:54:41] took. And you know what I did? I
[1:54:44] preached the atonement. Wow. Hallelujah.
[1:54:48] Wow. the certainty within the atonement.
[1:54:51] That's what was on my heart is to that
[1:54:53] that that part and then we had prayer on
[1:54:56] the phone. He was in a serious condition
[1:54:59] you know what God moved. Yes, he did.
[1:55:03] Our faith together and God moved for our
[1:55:05] brother. Amen. There's other testimonies
[1:55:09] right here through the assembly, but you
[1:55:10] realize it's God building our faith in
[1:55:14] the promise of his word. And I'm so glad
[1:55:16] that God has even where like I said
[1:55:18] there's ministries to me you can just
[1:55:20] look at it
[1:55:23] my you know I love like you know you you
[1:55:27] can you see like even brother Daryl Ward
[1:55:30] how and I'm not lifting any man up but
[1:55:32] I'm just saying how God is able to is
[1:55:35] they're able to get out of the way and
[1:55:37] God will work through them and it's such
[1:55:39] a vital vital ministry in the body he's
[1:55:42] evangelist and God will come right
[1:55:44] through that and a gift of faith that
[1:55:47] works in conjunction with healing,
[1:55:49] miracles. And it isn't just people that
[1:55:51] are healed of of physical conditions.
[1:55:54] But there's also lives that are healed
[1:55:57] from suicide spirits,
[1:56:00] from alcoholism,
[1:56:03] from where they've been cutting
[1:56:04] themselves and everything else.
[1:56:07] Healed. And not only has our God healed
[1:56:10] them, but there was one one young sister
[1:56:12] had all this from all that cutting that
[1:56:14] she had been doing. And in one service
[1:56:16] where God delivered her, here she is
[1:56:18] then raising her hands. She turns around
[1:56:21] to look. Every mark is gone. Hallelujah.
[1:56:23] That had been on her arms.
[1:56:26] [Applause]
[1:56:27] That's our God. Hallelujah. I'm so glad
[1:56:31] that he wants to make known his attitude
[1:56:34] towards us. Amen. His willingness to
[1:56:37] heal. Aren't you? Sometimes God will
[1:56:39] take take a man and he'll come down a
[1:56:41] certain area, a certain channel, certain
[1:56:43] ways, you know, and and that gift of
[1:56:45] faith, it's not confined just to
[1:56:47] ministers, right? It's not confined just
[1:56:49] to what's got to be me. No, God works.
[1:56:52] This is nine spiritual gifts that'll
[1:56:55] work through the body. But what we're
[1:56:58] seeing is at times how those spiritual
[1:57:00] gifts at times it'll work right through
[1:57:02] in conjunction sometimes with a
[1:57:04] ministerial gift. Don't you love the
[1:57:06] Lord? Amen.
[1:57:09] Just know this, my brother and sister.
[1:57:10] God knows our needs. And when we get we
[1:57:13] come and we gather
[1:57:15] here, this is why that we're not just
[1:57:18] coming just to fulfill some sort of a
[1:57:20] duty. Although it is our duty, but we're
[1:57:22] coming here, Lord, I want to have a
[1:57:25] meeting with you. Amen. And coming here
[1:57:27] with our hearts just ready, our lives.
[1:57:30] Lord, just just speak to us, Lord. You
[1:57:32] know the needs of your children. God
[1:57:34] knows just what we have need of and when
[1:57:37] we have need of him. Amen. No doubt we
[1:57:41] could witness through this congregation.
[1:57:42] There's healing that's taken place
[1:57:43] sometimes right while the preaching of
[1:57:45] the word's gone forth. There's healing.
[1:57:47] Sometimes it's it's taken right through
[1:57:49] a prayer line. Sometimes it's been while
[1:57:51] someone stood right here at the altar.
[1:57:52] Sometimes the healing has come all of a
[1:57:54] sudden here you are. Sister Stephanie
[1:57:57] has comes back to my mind. Here she is.
[1:58:00] The one here showing up, the one
[1:58:02] service. And I was in the back office.
[1:58:05] And I'm telling you, you talk about
[1:58:07] commotion out here in this right here.
[1:58:09] But she had a reason for that. A lot of
[1:58:11] you weren't here during that time. She
[1:58:13] comes, she came in here early and her
[1:58:15] and Sister Pat, Sister Pat, you was in
[1:58:17] the car with you, weren't you? Oh, God
[1:58:19] bless your
[1:58:22] heart. She came in that door. No cane no
[1:58:26] more. As a matter of fact, that cane's a
[1:58:27] memorial back there. Ain't that right?
[1:58:29] That cane's a memorial where she had to
[1:58:31] have a cane and God healed her of her
[1:58:33] back just like that. That cane's a
[1:58:37] memorial. She had a reason to
[1:58:40] shout. She had a reason to be happy.
[1:58:44] Brother Bill ran back there and it's
[1:58:46] probably the only time he ever bust in
[1:58:47] and disturbed me. He said, "God is
[1:58:50] healed." Sister Stephanie,
[1:58:54] right? Praise God. It can drop at any
[1:58:58] moment.
[1:59:00] What do we do? Let's just worship him.
[1:59:03] Let's worship him. Let's thank him
[1:59:05] because it's certain. Amen. You love him
[1:59:09] tonight. Musicians, why don't you come?
[1:59:15] Amen. My
[1:59:20] thank God for his mercy.
[1:59:23] Amen.
[1:59:25] Let's just we'll have a word of prayer
[1:59:29] and heavenly father.
[1:59:34] Thank you Lord for your mercy to us
[1:59:39] Lord.
[1:59:42] Father we so appreciate Lord how that
[1:59:45] you've just
[1:59:46] been Lord you continue to speak to our
[1:59:49] lives and just according to what we have
[1:59:51] need of.
[1:59:53] Lord, I thank you, Father, for how that
[1:59:57] you would just help us, Lord, is going
[1:59:58] through these things. I, Lord, how I
[2:00:01] felt in my heart is it's a lot of where
[2:00:04] you've just kind of pulled back the
[2:00:06] curtain and helped us, Lord, to see even
[2:00:09] to see the working even like what you
[2:00:12] would help us to see tonight and to
[2:00:15] understand within services. Sometimes
[2:00:17] Lord when we've been sitting here in a
[2:00:19] service and Lord just not exactly
[2:00:22] knowing which way it's going to go
[2:00:24] sometimes with Lord some of the brothers
[2:00:26] and the gifts that you have in the body
[2:00:28] we can
[2:00:29] almost Lord when that name that's been
[2:00:31] laid on our heart to have them and they
[2:00:33] come in we we pretty much know Lord this
[2:00:36] is needs these are way things is how
[2:00:38] you're going to move we don't know
[2:00:40] exactly but then there's other times
[2:00:42] Lord sometimes where you'll take a
[2:00:45] gift and you'll move in a certain
[2:00:47] direction, in a certain
[2:00:49] way.
[2:00:51] Lord, help us. I
[2:00:54] pray, help us to always find that
[2:00:56] channel.
[2:00:59] Lord, just listening last week where the
[2:01:00] prophet preaches the message divine
[2:01:03] healing in
[2:01:05] Jeffersonville and he walked out to the
[2:01:07] platform and he said, "I was getting
[2:01:10] ready to come out here and preach
[2:01:13] Melzdc, great king and prince." But he
[2:01:17] said, "When I heard the request of so
[2:01:20] many that was sick among us, I just felt
[2:01:24] to change what I was going to speak on.
[2:01:29] and I'm going to speak just he said just
[2:01:31] going to be submissive to the Holy
[2:01:32] Spirit. I'm just going to I feel led
[2:01:34] just to speak on divine
[2:01:37] healing. And he spoke about all the
[2:01:39] prayer requests that was given sickness
[2:01:42] that he heard there in the local
[2:01:44] congregation. Lord
[2:01:47] Jesus, it was not brother Brandham
[2:01:49] taking a
[2:01:50] thought. He heard it and you caused it
[2:01:53] to be
[2:01:55] heard in his heart and he was submissive
[2:02:00] to your leading to be able to lay aside
[2:02:04] the study, the notes what he had
[2:02:07] prepared in order to follow that you
[2:02:11] would minister to the needs of the
[2:02:12] people. Now he came back. We know that
[2:02:15] Lord I'm that message is a wonderful
[2:02:17] message. Melzdc, great king and
[2:02:21] prince, wonderful
[2:02:23] message. But sometimes, Lord, you'll
[2:02:25] have us just step
[2:02:28] aside and
[2:02:31] minister based on certain points and
[2:02:34] what's right here before us, Lord. Oh,
[2:02:37] dear God, that's what ministry is all
[2:02:39] about is about needs. That's why, Lord,
[2:02:42] even when you lay a a song upon
[2:02:45] someone's heart,
[2:02:47] Father, you do that Lord to minister to
[2:02:51] the needs of your children.
[2:02:54] Father, how we thank you,
[2:02:57] Lord. Help us to be sensitive, Lord.
[2:03:01] Lord God, we don't know how and what
[2:03:03] way, Lord, we might be used if we're
[2:03:06] never used. If I'm never used again, I
[2:03:09] love you,
[2:03:11] Lord. We appreciate you.
[2:03:15] The father I pray God you see the needs
[2:03:18] among your children tonight. We've
[2:03:20] already Lord had prayer. We've lifted
[2:03:22] them up before your throne. Now God I
[2:03:24] pray in the name of Jesus
[2:03:27] Christ. May Lord their eyes of faith be
[2:03:32] enlightened
[2:03:33] Lord. May Lord you move Lord I pray
[2:03:36] father upon the needs in their life. May
[2:03:40] their faith raise in that place, Lord,
[2:03:44] to just accept it, Lord. May it just
[2:03:47] drop in their hearts. May they water it
[2:03:49] with
[2:03:50] thanksgiving and Father, to receive the
[2:03:53] fruits of it in their lives. Help us,
[2:03:57] Lord, I pray. Help us, Lord, to be found
[2:04:00] faithful,
[2:04:02] Lord. We love you, Father. Hallelujah.
[2:04:05] In the name of Jesus Christ.
