the Lord with me come exalt his name [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's turn in the Word of God this morning if you would to Peter chapter 2 just so thankful to be in the house of the Lord beseech and every one of you other faces - and it's so good to see each and every one of you heart this is thankful for God's leadership and direction in an hour that we're living in it really it means so much to us that he is ever-present in leading us on want to just read in these scriptures where we were last week we could just start here in verse 4 and Peter here writing my inspiration so to whom coming as unto a lying son disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also it is contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone he lacked and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious let me say amen to that that's a truth but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same has made the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where and who also they were appointed but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that that term peculiar does not mean strange or odd it meant it means you've been at all to someone you belong to someone that you should show forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer as we look to him Heavenly Father we we love you more Jesus we are just so thankful your God your mercy and your grace once again Lord you've given us just a beautiful day not only naturally but oh god what a beautiful spiritual day Lord it's a day of gross darkness for the world it's a day Oh God that Shalom to the believer it's a rest it's a glorious day it's a wonderful hour to be living as a believer for just at any moment Lord at any moment Lord we're looking you're gone Lord as our heads are lifted up we're looking to you because at any moment to be caught away father we're looking at any moment Lord for our loved ones to appear for the Saints that's gone on we're living in the season of it more just as a as a plantain different things that we would plant and see around us we look at the trees we look at things and we can tell oh god a season and in that season there's an expectation that Lord the vegetation or the blossoms or the fruit or whatever it might be that it would come we know Lord that by the grace of God that we are living in the season of the rapture Lord we're living in the season of the coming of the Lord and we just ask God for your grace Lord that you might help us Lord in these moments and in these closing times God may we be ever near to you Lord may we be found worthy Lord to escape those things Lord that are coming upon the earth Lord we see little minor glimpses Lord but all God were thankful that Lord Jesus that there is a greater focus a greater voice there is a true light that has come Lord to take a hold and to guide us safely home Lord we just ask that you were just now anoint our lips anoint our ears o God I ask if there's one here this morning that doesn't know you may father I pray you just move right to their heart Lord and may they all God and humility respond to the knock of the Holy Spirit upon their heart Lord for there's no greater visitation Lord then you would come Lord and speak to us Lord and do a work in our lives we need you father we just commit ourselves in your hands now in the name of Jesus Christ amen may God bless you as you're being seated I want to if God will help us just to continue to look at that thought as we've been on stability in the midst of instability and also where we were last Sunday on never ashamed and this scripture as a scripture that is just so just so seemingly sets the course and speaks to such depth in our life when we we read through these scriptures that we have here before us that we read in the text when we look at it if then as far as our lives would go we are no different as far as than any other other human being we are we are no more than any other human being you and I could not make the difference in our life but God is the one who has made the difference you take him away from our lives and we're like everybody else you remove him this church is like any other Church he's the one who makes the difference we were always a part of him this is what the Scriptures are speaking to us we were always a part of him these are something that God brings to us as a reality that there is a greater identity that we have received than anything of this earth the world wants to assign identities but God has given us a true identity and this is why that we are admonished by the Spirit we are sons and daughters of God and they just say it first of all above everything else we are first Christians are you hearing me we are first of all sons and daughters of God you remember the Spirit of God as he moved in and even in this age and it was it was expressing to us that even that when Eve she did not even have her own name and her own identity until she had fallen she was identified completely by Adam's name God called Adam they both responded then we find that every time that even when God would give light and show light once if the people fail to walk on with that light then the people would take an identity of a name and they would associate with something that was in the past instead of being United with a living God who was present let me just say it very clearly it's not our precepts it's not our pretense it's not all any of those things that separate us it's his presence coming through his word in our life that gives us a true identity when someone looks at me there's one thing and this ought to be the desire above in all of your life that the first thing that they notice about your life you're a Christian that's the first thing that we desire God let there be such a life such a presence that they would recognize we are we are a Christian and these are things that when the scripture is making clear to us here and I want to just draw our attention in this part in verse 6 behold I lay in Zion a chief Cornerstone elect and precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded shall not be ashamed whosoever believeth on him let me read the scripture where we're here where Peter Paul would pull from this same scripture as the Spirit of God would quicken to their hearts and it would speak in isaiah 28:16 therefore thus saith the lord god behold I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a tried stone a precious cornerstone a sure foundation and he that believeth shall not make haste he will not be impatient with waiting on the fulfillment of the word because we have a foundation and so within this there is undoubtedly that as we speak throughout the congregation there's a lot of things that even when it comes down to things that you've prayed about or I prayed about or what we're looking for there can even be parts about it where we can have certain ideas or certain thoughts or even when we're praying God that it would come this way or it would work out this way but yet as a believer the greatest thing that we can do is to be resolved and reserved to say Lord this is things that I don't know how you're going to work it out but I'm just gonna look to you and I'm asking that you will give me the grace to follow you and to just be the present to recognize you when you come to fulfill your word in that pathway in that channel because that has been what has happened in all through history has been where individuals have taken a scripture and they have so figured it out based on their mind and yet when it didn't happen that way they stumbled at the very word that they said they were looking for they stumbled at it but here God's grace with your I let me just say if not for God's grace there is an election it is God in His grace that would move down because some of you some of us that I'm speaking to you had no background of God whatsoever in your life there was and maybe even anything you could hang your hat on but God who is rich in mercy it wasn't about how much background you had you had a greater background that you did not even know about you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world let me just say this to you this world is not what holds the answer or make sense of your life [Music] this world is built on the pretense of confusion that's what happened that's why it's called Babylon her religion has brought confusion dissimulation division emulation that is the results of her religion there's two spiritual powers at work here in this earth there's only one that can hold and release to us our true identity and who we are and may God help us let that voice drowned out every other voice and that's his voice he is the final authority Romans 10:10 familiar scripture for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation simply put God deals with your heart first and God dealing with your heart it's God building your heart into a place to believe on him it's his work it's him coming through his word then as he touches that life as he moves upon our life and listen please do not just leave this scripture let's go upon a manner of someone just coming to salvation let the scripture be applicable to every part of your life when you've got needs I've got needs in my life we need God we need his faith to move down and to stir our faith because after afterwards then as were standing with the mouth confession is made what are we confessing we're confessing to him who has touched our heart and what he has delivered to us and that's what we're confessing and listen as you confess as the Prophet with jealousy says you give your life to God and a real faith in that your life is being gift to God and you go out with the confession you watch he said your life from that moment on will go up as you confess and you look to others and say God touch my life I've been saved he said it'll work salvation and if it works that way it's the same way if you take and you take your mouth and you go the opposite way it will bring defeat that's why jesus said by their words thou shalt either be justified or condemned wonder David would say set a guard over my mouth Lord then it comes into Romans 10 11 for the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed a person that says I've been saved they'll not be ashamed they know I've been saved I've repented of my sins I've been saved God has forgiven me God comes down and cleanses that that heart from all of the habits of the sin of the world there's coward out they can stand on that and say he has cleansed me he sent me free crud comes down and he feels that life they can say God has completely changed me he's brought a complete change in my life he did something that I could never do there's something within me that just says amen to the Word of God you'll never be ashamed never be ashamed now with never being ashamed let's bring this into where we were leaving off last week in this account in second chronicles 32 and I want to look at this here this morning because to never be ashamed to have that that anchor to have that that hold in the Lord and I want you to notice carefully these words in second chronicles 32 verse 1 after these things and the establishment thereof and there's a very peculiar part in Scripture you'll notice even in the Book of Revelations where it would speak to us concerning great visitations after these things what after what things Hezekiah when you read back in the scripture Israel there had already been a pronouncement of judgment that was coming that was you're not going to escape that judgment it was already pronounced but here a haze a haze this is his father passes away but Hezekiah he's moved by the Lord and Hezekiah sees where Israel has fallen away from the standard the house of the Lord is forsaken now people are just going about their ways and the priests are out in the field working and there's pollution even in the house of God there's pollution throughout the land of Israel and Hezekiah he begins to if you you read maybe when you get home and you read through first chronicles 28 and so forth you'll find that even up to this place he moves under a burden to be able to set the order back to a place that would invite the presence of God even the offering of the sacrifice and when you look even in your bibles if you have him open you'll notice that the scripture right above this at the end of second chronicles 31 is where after those things were done that there was such a joy that had come in the Land of Israel like it was in the days of Solomon true joy is not something that the world can give and no we under I know we hear that a million times but I'm just telling you there's only one thing that will bring joy and that's getting lined up with the word that's the only thing that's real joy it'll be you know when you were lined up with the word and now after these things my what a lining up with the word but here comes Satan to to try to sort that and to bring a test against that and the Bible says Sennacherib king of Assyria came and entered into Judah and encamped against the fence cities and thought to win them for himself and when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come and that he purposed to fight against Jerusalem he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city and they did help him so there was gathered much people together who stopped all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land saying why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water and where we were at as last week the simplicity is the first of all Hezekiah after all this is done think of it a revival has struck Israel but it did not remove him pending judgment but there are some key words that Hezekiah says and I don't have time to read them but I if you allow me just to quote them and paraphrase them out of chapter 30 there are there are those that he sends throughout Israel to cause the people to come in to sacrifice there are many out of some of those tribes they said they would not even heed to the words of the king's commandments but they laughed him to scorn but Hezekiah stood up and he's he he implores he speaks even to the parents he speaks personally to the parents he speaks to the whole county said look we're not going to get away from this judgment but what we can do right now is see to it that God will bring our children and plant them back into the lamb you know that was that was a man that was in tune with God to know that God will not forsake his word so everything look bleak it looked dark but Hezekiah said let your focus right now don't try to judge the judgment don't try to get around it don't try to sort it don't try your own means in your own measures he's letting them know live not for the present but live for the future but God will bring your children back into this land let me just tell you something you've heard this statement brother Branham says how you think about Jesus Christ will affect your grandchildren is that right just as much as people's actions and things like that it can fall down in generations and what about reaching back to that of Levi Levi paid to pay paid ties why in the loins of Abraham God allotted it to him they paid tithes to Melchizedek why God knew what Levi would do he knew and Levi was that when this was his great-grandfather paying the tithe this is why you think God doesn't think this important when it came to a time in the daughters of Zelophehad they had there was nobody to stand for their inheritance they needed a man to stand for their inheritance there was no man to stand but they came to Moses they came to Joshua and they said that remembers how our Father stood in the days when the tests came and they said you cannot take the land our Father was not whistles unbelievers he stood with the word of the Lord let me tell you something that had an impression on the daughters of Zelophehad when push comes to shove that's the ground they were gonna stand on why that's the only share foundation whoo I will fill I have an appraised breaking singing a song this is how I fight my battles this is our foundation we're living in a world that isn't that has rejected God they do not like to retain God in their mind they've rejected him all together and God has rejected them there's still mercy I said there's still mercy judgements on its way judgments coming it's spilling over right now is that right so they're saying when this advancement comes cut off the water supply in other words breaking it down into our everyday daily life make the devil when he tries to make his advances make him uncomfortable [Applause] let me ask you how do you cut off the water supply well one of the ways is by simply not giving it any time but giving more time to what's more important is that right I mean you cannot starve starve the black dog to death if you're not feeding the white one whoever your feet right if you cater towards the things of the flesh come on do we live in this flesh we walk in this world we're not ignorant of Satan's devices his objective is to pull us in this realm that's his objective that he would pull us in this route why as soon as were inclined to this realm were defeated right then on the platform here came the mania here came the bull who came to bees if the profit moved in entered into that realm he was defeated what had to happen the one who was present who commissioned him that say manger of the Lord let me just tell you that angel of the Lord did not leave he is with the message he is right here with this word that challenge was not made for the read and recognized that challenge was not about him he challenged the Holy Ghost and that's exactly what Satan wants to do and continue to do is to challenge the Holy Ghost let me remind you demons have been released in Revelations not the lid of Hell has come off but God would not allow it to come off if he wasn't prepared to stand there and that's so another mighty angel come down rather that is the chief captain of the Lord's house and we're wondering how do I face this panel how do I face this right here I'm telling you let's forsake earthly means let us be locked in on the angel of the Lord [Applause] no wonder the scripture would say in the book of Isaiah Isaiah CC for man whose breath is in his nostrils we ended right here last week and he strengthened himself think of this here's a man that's been seeing to it not just that his life but everything around that he can affect by the Carlos everything around is getting lined up it's getting lined up everything getting lined up but I want you to notice he was not this did not bring when a man is being lined up with God he doesn't bring a false sense of security it doesn't bring that it brings the humility he strengthens himself let me just say this to you it brings discernment to our lives mister you can't we can't cut God and say well I just really you know when I go to church this is when I'm in contact with the spiritual but when you know I I come to these things in a natural this is where you know I've got to have the natural you can't cut God out of your life you can't cut God out and say God you handle this right here but I'll handle this right here you can't do that he wants to govern and be the Lord of all your life if you're gonna try to take your life and you're gonna say well I'm gonna take this and I'll make it come this way you don't have this leadership and his blessing and his direction but how can we how can we tell God Lord I know what's best in this situation I got this hey I know what's best know Hezekiah he strengthened himself he build up all the wall that was broken so he wasn't just sitting around and saying I'm elect I've got faith I need to build up the wall God will take care of me and I have to worry about nothing no no it's true gotta provide for all your needs but God's also entrusted you with the ability to care over your needs is that right well God will never see me begging that's true that's a promise in God's word but neither did does that cause you to live Loosli hello see all of it's covered within God's Word it's all the balance and the precepts that lay here now notice he raised up to the towers and another wall without and repaired Milo in the City of David and made darts and shields in abundance he is preparing for war he's preparing for war these are things that God is not going to come down and do for him got ain't gonna do it he knows what needs to be done so when we have an expectation because he that believeth on him shall never be confounded when we have a real and expectation we it should be like David said my soul wait thou only on God for my expectation is from him we desired that our expectation would be upon the word upon the Lord and from the Lord because this is the only grounds where faith can rest and even in that part of an expectation there can be things and I will just say it like this that we grow and we learn as we walk and as we walk and we mature in the Lord it should be the math flexion of my maturity is the less that we trust ourselves and the more that we trust him that's maturity maturity isn't I've got this on I can handle this and I know what to do here I know what to do here that's not maturity that's still showing there Steel's growth that's going on back here and we're always growing but you realize when it comes to a place of where you're at now as you mature you recognize I need him I can do nothing without him that's part of maturity it's depending on him hallelujah this is what Genesis 22 my Moriah points us to Abraham went up there by the word of the Lord he's depending on that word that God has given and as matured in his heart and his life has been matured by it he's depending on God to fulfill that word that's the same way that it is with the promise of the rapture it's not us becoming more dependent and out here it's depending more on God our expectation is to be built upon the Lord and this is where the Word of God was so this what will read it shows it so quicken to Hezekiah for the present situation how many know he's a present god I mean oh he's the I am he letting moses know when you go down there but first before you go i want you to know i'm the i am i'm the present god when a when one a person meets god they recognize he's present he's not a historical being he's not a future happening this is present and now you're walking in the presence of the living god who is ever present it stabilizes our life look now Hezekiah his approach in verse six this is part of even the building up he sets captains of war over the people gathered them together in the street of the gate of the city and spake comfortably to them saying aren't you glad the word speaks comfortably be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Syria he's quoting what God spoke a few times in Deuteronomy and what God spoke personally to Joshua but you see he said believer this word he's not reading it as just something that is history a part of heritage he recognizes what God did before he's the same God today and Hezekiah in fellowship with God he was not searching for scriptures he was not searching for this he had the God who was the answer to the situation right there with him and God illuminates this word and it is the Lord that first of all has spoke comfortably to Hezekiah and now Hezekiah is speaking comfortably to the people it's knowing you see that's why this message it's not something that gets left on tapes and books it's not something that we were memorize or this quo or this scripture rather we needed we need to know the app patient in the hour we're living in we need divine application this is token hour oh my be strong and courageous be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him for there be more with us than with him I know his problem he's been in that message and he ain't just been in that message of of Elijah and Elijah and Isaiah he's been in that he knows God is present no doubt it's like I Elijah he doesn't see the angels that are there but he knows that God is present and where he is the Lord of Hosts is glory be to God with him is an arm of flesh but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles and the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah he wasn't a prophet he wasn't a priest but he was the king of Judah do you realize how God will speak of kings in the Book of Jeremiah he will call Kings my shepherds he will call him my pastors those in whom that God would be entrusted to lead his people in the midst of a situation now Hezekiah these are not his words as far as something he's come up with or maja let me see what how I cannot apply this right here because remember we've got to have an expectation from the Lord is that right a person might you know they could take the word and say well you know by His stripes I'm healed and here they go they'll take that word that promise is true it's genuine but they can take it with an expectation that I'm not gonna have to go through the surgery God's not gonna I'm not gonna have to take any medicine I'm not gonna have to do any of that God never gave you that expectation you created it well I've got a promise of God that is true but you can't dictate the pathway of how God's going to fulfill it youyou we're going in our own expectations we will be ashamed but never be ashamed of him oh come on now all the frost this assembly there's many of us has been ashamed but we never been ashamed in him we've been ashamed because our own expectations of certain pathways and this didn't happen this way and I was thinking it this way but all thanks Peter Claud but there is a sure foundation I tried stone in the midst of our life it holds us brother our life is built upon him and if we can look to the Lord he'll help us through our failures through those Saints he will mold us and mature us another new you now God tells you that personally and that's the way it's going to go then you know what you stand on that word so the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah now I want you to watch this here in verse nine of the same chapter after this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants to Jerusalem but he himself lay siege against lakish and all his power with him unto Hezekiah king of Judah and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem saying thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria whereon do you trust that ye abide in the siege of Jerusalem in other words who do you think you are now remember this is not Sennacherib he sent his messengers Satan has messengers to Paul called and false apostles deceitful workers is that right they want to take away from the real grace of God Satan's messengers also they bring sickness disease worry frustration that's what his messengers do his messengers carry a message remember with word come spirit you see the words that you're receiving it's not just well you know these are just words that that are out here no words carry spirits spirits travel by the word when Jesus would even speak and they were casting out Devils it would address that devil whether it would say peace or come out of them but you see the Spirit of God would travel behind that word it's the same way when there is words that's going forward there is spirits that travel with words this is why people end up in the messes they end up with they're watching the movies listen to the things are listening to and they wonder why they battle the situation's they battle you want to know why demons travel demons travel through mediums demons travel through words demons travel through plots and books demons travel through words oh ma but that's only a copycat because Almighty God he travels right through his word to brother when you can begin to receive the word let me just say it you might be in the most perplexed time that you've been here but when you can begin to receive that word and allow your heart to become aligned with it the Spirit of Almighty God will travel right with that word and begin to minister comfort to your heart it'll begin to minister faith and love an ability that's the power of the Holy Ghost coming through the word so many times they wonder why are people in the chaotic state they're in why are young people this way and why is this going on look at where we're at look at what they're feeding on come on friends once you feed upon and digest you will actually mold your character and your being and your association your expression but I'll think about it if that's true on the on the negative side how much more on the positive side I want to be a feeder on the word of God I want to be a feeder upon the holy ghost I want that of the Spirit of God to be the main diet when somebody comes in our home they come into our life I won't want it to be no mistake of what the main diet is and brother the main guide itself yeah it's organic I agree the main diet on let's run for my spiritual it is a rightful diet it's packed full of vitamins and nutrients it has just exactly what we have need of for this hour and watch how Satan's plan is this has all been done they this build-up now here comes the messengers think of what's happened Hezekiah already spoken he's spoken now the scripture says Sennacherib king of Assyria this is what he said we're on do you trust that she abide in the siege of Jerusalem death not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst he never persuaded them to die by famine and thirst see how the enemy slipping this in he's trying to weaken what they're trusting in the Lord our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria half not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem saying he shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it see Satan knows say knows all of this was being done now it's come to test it but what he's testing is he's going to see where does the confidence of the people rest where is their confidence resting you know what there's one thing for us to say all I have complete confidence in the Lord but what happens when tragedy strikes I have complete confidence in the message about what happens when situations arise that you don't have answers for you see how Satan comes to want he's sly brother and sister that's not glorifying him remember our mind our own me you know I don't care how much we know the message how much we know the scriptures you'll never be able to catch him on that alone we need the discernment of the Holy Ghost not something from the past we need a present God let the little boy in the fender stroll he said I know mama I know we're Christians but in an hour like this I need a God with skin on no you're not what I and my fathers have done unto all the peoples of other lands were the gods of the nations of these lands anyways able to deliver the lands out of my hand who was there among all the gods of these nations that my father's utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hand that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand who do you think you are we have defeated many gods and you are told to worship one God we have defeated many and you think your God will be able to deliver you out of our hands into something how god knows just how to be quiet and just stay there and just say keep coming now that keep coming it might encroach on your body are you with me it might encroach on your mind in your spirit it might encroach on your home on a certain way but know that God's watching it on you see it's a kind mr standing on the Word of God God is watching all this come to pass now watch verse 15 now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you on this manner neither yet believe him for no god of any nation or Kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand and out of the hand of my father's how much less shall your God deliver you out of my head oh you ain't picking a fight with Hezekiah you picking a fight with God [Laughter] [Applause] picking a fight with one you know you gonna whoop I'm close to it he's calling God into question this is my prayer I pray this is your prayers where and they are lives be so yielded to him so consecrated that God could step down through our lives and say I'll answer that is that what you want my life to be in so in in harmony in tune with him the things that God would show Sam to build this up here get this up get this straight now take care of this and this and and yielding to him I wanted to be in a place remember when that mania came on the platform there and challenging the Spirit of God the Prophet had certain thoughts at that time he said ah sighs deem up it shows even in the midst of battle we still walk with our humanity the first resort is for us to resort in times of battle and strength with humanity but God showed us as the Prophet would stand there and say but I chose to think different faults about that man that poor man he's a husband he's a father remind you that man had already done some damage on policemen before he came in the building they asked brother Branham the policemen were coming should we take him away he said no let him alone this is not a flesh and blood affair Oh may God help us [Applause] the Holy Spirit accepted that challenge but here was the part that within it he chose to think different thoughts that's God's grace that's God's grace and his servants speak more against the Lord God and against the servant Hezekiah he wrote also letters to rail on the Lord God of Israel to speak against him saying as the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand so shall not the god of Hezekiah deliver his people out of my hand then they crowd with a cried with a loud voice in the Jews speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall these were Syrians they were speaking in a Syrian tongue but they knew they're not going to move Hezekiah but if we can bring division in the ranks we've got if we can split and bring division we've got him conquered if there is some way that fear can set in to the people how does fear come when you let go of what is sure when you forsake what is sure what is tried what is steadfast they did this to a frighten them and to trouble them that they might take the city I know I don't have to say this but you already know and it's true you know the devil will try to use the word against you to try to frighten you he'll bring up your mistakes and bring up your failures he'll bring up all those things right when you're in the midst of facing a battle facing a situation Satan doesn't care he doesn't care for right in the midst of a service he doesn't care where it's at he will try to do what he can't remember he will take the very message that is so dear to our heart our language and if you allow him you'll try to use it on you but remember God never comes with condemnation if we need correction he corrects us is that right but notice they came with that and says the Bible they spake against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the people of the earth which were the work of the hands of man they were attacking with voices of reasoning and doubt let me just say this to you without dwelling on it there are voices all around us there's only one voice that's true one and that's the voice of God I said there's only one so many voices in the world you hear the Prophet say so many voices but there's only one voice that's true examine what voices you listen to examine what it's leading you to do what's the leading you to do and you'll know whether you're listening to it or not God has sent his voice in this hour we are to esteem the Word of God above everything else these people were attacking the rock this is what this is what these messengers were doing they were wanting to get a place to find out a place in the people's heart they were attacking the rock the cornerstone that the people of God were trusting on let me just just move on for time here Bremen say it like this and in in the church age book he said Satan because he knows he cannot overcome the Holy Ghost he will attack the vessel that the Holy Ghost is using to try to destroy confidence you seeing Cain rose up to slay Abel you see the pattern on down and that's the same way when we look at this here brother Brown brings up brother Brown brings up an example he's gone out to preach a meeting and there's a woman that has traveled from Jeffersonville and went to this meeting where he's preaching and here he is he's you know divine healings being preached here the Word of God is going forth and here there's another woman in the city they gone to it she's just there all boy what God is doing just so wonderful her faith is being built up and the woman that was from Jeffersonville leaned over and said you ought to see him every time his children gets sick he rushes him to the doctor you know what that was about it was trying to break confidence in the word if that woman who spoken that way could only recognize that God is the healer no matter what Avenue it would give her rest but to her that was confusion how is he speaking this and hears this how did Paul speak this and Paul had Luke with him God permits that when are you saying God permits besiegement God permits trying the enemy wants to try to break confidence let me just say this very clearly don't underestimate Satan to try in any way you can to try to destroy your confidence in this message try to destroy your confidence in your pastor try to destroy your confidence in your husband try to destroy confidence and your wife preach brother sender Satan will it out if he can destroy confidence he's got you confidence does not mean that we understand everything confidence is we're trusting in the Lord [Applause] here's what the messenger sent let me just break into Isaiah that takes into this account here's what he says to the city and mine now come up without the Lord against this land to destroy it the Lord said unto me go up against this land and destroy listen to me now this is why you need to know where you're standing you need to know your god-given ground did God permit him to come God did permit him to come but when God permits something if he's going to manifest his glory he's going to manifest his glory above all the other gods watch this watch how this unfolds they just move on down here for sake of time in verse 18 of this same chapter here they say beware lest has the kind of persuade you say the Lord will deliver us and they go into the same spill about what about the rest of God's see all these other lands we've conquered in this God and this God in this God this is one of the most important things that they did when all this was being said and they were speaking to him in the language of the Jews they were trying to frighten the people in the wall here here is one of the greatest things that you can do verse 21 but they held their peace and answered him not a word we don't we know we're not clowning for the devil we don't know him no word you don't have anything to prove your life proves it [Applause] hallelujah answered him not a word for the Kings Commandments was answer him not and he knows there's times in casting your mouth where you have to stand and say get behind me Satan and then there's other times where the Prophet said don't stand there and rebuke that tantalizing rattlesnake walk on by it and ignore it is that right it's fighting that battle for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they're mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds somebody's points I'm being very deliberate with just as God has put them my heart breaking confidence in the word of the Lord it's not where you say as a person oh no I don't believe oh I don't know about brother branham oh I don't know about the message oh I don't know about the Bible or I don't know about the Holy Spirit oh I don't that that's nice all together breaking confidence but if Satan can get you to look and focus on another means or another measure outside of God then where's your confidence it's not saying we don't take medicine that quote I just referred you to when they were making railing accusations against brother Branham the brown said medicines of God you see if it is where it where does our confidence where's our confidence within these measures whereas our confidence in this our what I'm preaching to you right now is an assembly these are not just showing up to minister to words or to those who are streaming this is a present our meets present application is they're not just Bible stories but we must be like that little of my woman that was down in Memphis Tennessee and the Prophet was led by the Spirit of God through the neighborhood and that she was standing and she said born in parson how'd you know I was a person she said God showed me you would be coming she had a need hallelujah she identified it you that Elijah and as that Shunammite woman rather that oneness sunday-school story there was a crisis in her home there was a crisis in her home and that word that she had read it became a stabilizer where she was looking preach with me somebody see one looking for the corner see one looking for the ambulance see one looking for the doctor persuade his life if God didn't come on the scene his life was over her trust was in the sure foundation [Applause] here came God on the scene what that was in the scripture she said that's who I am had been waiting on you to come God showed me you were coming and here's the thing by the brand got shorter he said he was coming she stood out there on the fence her back was wet with Dew on it the conditions around her the conditions of the night and the morning did not hinder her from an expectation may we have our eyes get your eyes off of the world I said in the name of Jesus Christ get your eyes off this world this world cannot bring harmony to your life it does not have the answer there's one the only one answer to this world and that's the coming of the Lord there's only one answer to your life and that's the coming of the Lord in your life there's only one answer and that's him our confidence must be in him I want you to watch this and second chronicles 32 20 greatest thing that can be done and for this cause has a kind of the king and the prophet Isaiah the son of amos prayed and cried to heaven people say I'm tired of praying because you don't believe tired of praying I don't see no results you don't pray to change God's mind you pray that your mind might be changed and if you're making prayer book prayers you might want to just speak to him like you would speak to me or speak to somebody else and say God I need to speak to you I need to know Lord right now in this hour you know my prayer means nothing to people you know why prayer is not even when you tell people in the world let's pray you know it doesn't mean anything because they don't believe they don't believe they're not in contact with that Network how sad how sad because God has allowed it to be included in the Reader's Digest and everything else of the effects of Prayer he didn't even have to do that but you see we're living in a time where a generation has come up that know not God a generation that knew not Joseph you want to know how people can be disrespectful to Authority because they are missing the authority of God in their homes they're missing the absolute authority of Jesus Christ in the church that's how they can be disrespectful that's how they can be in that way they're missing the true absolute hallelujah glory be to God you cannot legislate morality you can't do that the Bible speaks in the hour that we're living in that that influence of that other Gentile power will think to change laws are you with me come on friends I'm talking Bible here I'm joking scripture to address present situations present need God has given us eyes in this hour this is the here's what after all they build up build up the walls build up Milo prepared the instruments of war did all this and now when it comes down to everything let's go before God in three it required spiritual discernment for the people to recognize this is not the King's words this is God's words the same discernment was needed to take the prayer that God moved upon Solomon to pray when conditions would come into the land think of the mercy of God when the temple of God is being set up a house that God ordained to be built David's son a type of Christ where we read here in the opening of our text a house that would be built a house that would be set up a house where he would be established in type speaking of where you and I are now and it took discernment listen to me it took discernment to know that this is the words of God they were not resting on Solomon as a man that could have been some troubled waters come on they were resting they had discernment to know this is the Word of God let me tell you a church I speak very plainly to you there in an hour we're in a time you must have discernment of the spirit and discernment of the Spirit comes by the Holy Ghost you've got to be able to discern the spirits they're all around us and it's not just spirits it's up there you've got to be able to discern the body of Jesus Christ you've got to be able to discern the working of the Holy Ghost and our myths to discern that takes you more and deeper than just the flesh of a man may God help you that you you don't even remember what kind of a tie i was wearing but you're so focused upon what god is saying that if i came here with a hole in my shirt or missed mats and everything else your focus would be so set upon what god is saying how a discernment in this hour to recognize it's got in my brother got in my sister it's God in His people [Applause] let me just tell you if you're a clear eyes that kind of discernment and discern let God discern even in your life and you've discerned am I where I need to be changes everything friends you don't need to ask somebody is this okay to post is this okay you've got discernment you got discernment of spirit that you know Christians don't post or stand in questionable things Christians don't talk about sex on Facebook preach brother Sammy Christians don't bless post those things up this was funny this was cute this was the Christians do not take the word and cut people down [Applause] they then live by the sword will die by it discernment to recognize there are traps all around us things that want to pull upon your flesh upon your emotions and that's you who reach in this morning you see Satan's objective is we're looking is to try to bring divisions try to break confidence we've been given a word let me tell you something this message that God has sent to us it has made this Bible a new book you know they did it left it lifted God out of history this message that God has sent it addresses present situations and if you allow it it'll stabilize you let's just be very honest for some people the best thing they could do is get off the social media instead of having to apologize so much get off of it I know some people got to have it for their job listen to me this is a reality you don't want something that's gonna trap you and ensnare you [Music] here's the words of Solomon first Kings 837 if they're being the land famine if there be pestilence blasting mildew locusts or if there be caterpillar if their enemy be seeds them in the land of their cities whatsoever plague whatsoever sickness there be what prayer and supplication so ever be made by any man or by all thy people Israel which shall know every man the plague of his own heart and spread forth his hands toward this house then here though in heaven that dwelling place and forgive and do and give to every people according to which every man according to his ways whose heart thou knowest for thou even though only knowest the hearts of all the children of men that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which doubt gave us done to their fathers lets you look at this here every man knows the plague of his own heart besiegement whatsoever besiegement whatsoever play whatsoever sickness whatsoever oh this is a new turn whatsoever this is a new condition whatsoever does not making addendums when you put him in another little superscript letter in there I'm the Lord that healeth all thy diseases it was he's God over every situation knowing the plague of your own heart is to ensure as the scripture said if you say to this mountain be thou movin plucked up and cast into yonder sea and don't doubt in your heart it shall be even as you said like Hezekiah this is part of strengthening yourself God's not going to come down and go make something right with somebody else that he expects you to do hello somebody God equips us with these things that we would know what we're supposed to do is that right every man know what the plague of his own heart and committing that to God letting God reconcile our heart to him if there's any thing that stands in the way get it out of the way why that he might come down can I have just a little bit more we're nearing but I want you to see this here this prayer because this is important this isn't just as a scripture that has a kind Amos Isaiah they prayed and crying into heaven and once you watch this verse 37 here's the account Hezekiah goes into the house of the Lord he rents his clothes covered himself with sack cloth and he goes into the house of the Lord then in verse 2 he sends alack him who was over the household and Shemin of the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto Isaiah the prophet the son of amos he's sending them with sackcloth humility go go to the prophet go to the prophet see all that's been done they knew what to do now it's time we need direction in this moment we've got the written word now we need the god of the word to come on to see they're coming the proper Channel look look they're coming not just a proper channel but in humility God will always recognize and they said unto Him thus saith as a kind this day is a day of trouble a rebuke of blasphemy for the children are come to the birth there's not strength to bring forth we've done all we can do we need God to come we need his strength to bring the birth when you've done all you can do you're repented you've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then ask for God for his strength to come to bring the birth when you've done all you can do stand there on the word having done all to stand stand therefore with your loins Girt about with truth clubs the one to bring it to birth he's the one to bring it to pass we're standing on their way he brings it to pass look at this humility it maybe is it has the kindest words the Lord that God will hear the words of her ravishing whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to approach the Living God and will reprove the words which the Lord that God has heard wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left look what he's saying he's speaking to the Prophet because of this God may hear our prayer lift up therefore prayer for the remnant what did Jesus tell Peter I prayed for you John 17 intercessory prayer how many times let me tell you something friends we under this world there has been a prayer that has been offered up for this generation there's been a message that has gone forth for this generation hallelujah Oh glory be to God I really feel like preaching now but I got to control it we have his word we have the Bible but we needed the God of the Bible to come on the scene hallelujah what good does it do having a map then you say well I know I gotta get there you gotta know where you're at it took one to show us where we're at and this is the pathway to get back home it's not enough to have the book that says this is home this is home but God sends down eyes that we might see how to get back home where we are and the Junction's along the way and how many times the Prophet would say I'm gonna pray a prayer and I want you to repeat the words after me God would move right behind the scene sometimes you hear the wind come right in the building Isaiah said to them does shock she's saying to your master this is what I want you to say to Hezekiah thus saith the Lord be not afraid of the words that thou has heard wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemy behold I will send a blast upon him and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land so Hezekiah hears this praying he sends Isaiah Isaiah hears goes before God he sends back an answer to Hezekiah Hezekiah look what he does he takes this answer verse 14 he receives the letter from the hand of the messengers and he read it and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord you see what happened when he really read it he really read it and won just something on his phone he read it it wasn't just something he knew about he read it come on friends there's a lot of other things you can read it'll never do this for you it'll never encourage you to go to the house of God it'll never strengthen you it'll never bring joy in your myths by the sending you don't know what kind of a situation we're living it I sure do know what kind of a situation we're living in and I'll tell you the words of the Lord Jesus he said in the world you shall have tribulation but in me you shall have peace what good is your religion if you can't have joy in the midst of trouble what good is that if everything's going just right and that's when you've got joy I'm talking about a living God that when you're in the midst of despair you had the same kind of testimony that Paul said he said we are not forsaken cast down but were not destroyed this is what kind of a life this foundation produces this stone I lay in Zion and Hezekiah prayed unto the Lord saying O Lord of Hosts God of Israel if you need to pinch yourself pinch yourself say pay attention here you can get me a little bit of time I'm not trying to egg you on but listen we give a lot of time to a lot of other things sometimes you can be sitting right in front of your computer and all of a sudden you mean I've been sitting here taking all this in for this period of time you don't have to say Amen it's true Oh Lord of Hosts God of Israel that dwellest between the cherubims thou art the God even thou alone of all the kingdoms of the earth thou has made heaven and earth he clang incline thine ear o Lord and hear opened an eyes O Lord and see and hear all the words of Sennacherib which hath sent to reproach the Living God ah the truth Lord the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations in the other countries it's a kind it's not saying I'm going to do nothing yeah they were only fooling no no they laid waste other countries this came in business the Devils not a bad thought he is out of being and the Holy Ghost is not a good thought he's a person [Applause] it's not just oh my you know that was enough no these are the truth hello this is just like when the profit and how can I overcome he said you look in yourself and you say I got a sickness but I don't believe it's a sickness either no no yes it is a sickness come on imagining in a way doesn't make it go away little faith faith is not pretending faith does not ignore the present problem that's not faith that's been Nile faith sees victory how can you proclaim victory if you don't see in the obstacle oh yes it is sickness this is the prophets words how can overcome you've got cancer and you say I don't believe it's a cancer it is a cancer he says it is a cancer but remember this is what's important but remember remember we're talking about balance greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world so the doctor says you've got this or you got that you see here's the balance of it that ain't signing for rattlesnakes santa for rattlesnakes is where you submit to it submitting to it is not you recognizing there's a besiegement and we're going to war the Assyrians are approaching and we're going to go to war hallelujah Oh glory but remember God in you is greater you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing hallelujah don't you just love the Lord these are things that take take and pray about that take it in a situation yeah let that realization strike Lord that the Holy Spirit in me is greater than this affliction in my body the doctor says I have this I feel this I see it on my body but I'm looking at another report that says by your stripes I am [Applause] and they have cast their gods into the fire for they were no gods but the works of men's hands wouldn't stone therefore they have destroyed them now therefore O Lord our God save us from his hand that all the kings kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the Lord even thou would God do that would God let a situation get so bad in your life around your life would God let a situation get so bad to where only he can step in but remember you remember this he's watching over you is the kind did a lot of wonderful things even after what he did he strengthened himself build up cut off water supply on and on this right here if he'd had done all the rest of it and they they didn't pray but his prayer he had an alignment of what to be praying for he had he knew there he goes to the prophet of God and he asked pray for the remnant a word comes back to him he takes the word goes back to the house of God with that word lays it out it says oh God Oh God come on the same he didn't stop ray he kept praying I've asked you for more time and more time more time and more time but here is Hezekiah he prays I'm not gonna read this I'll just refer to this verse 21 comes back and remember he sent Isaiah Isaiah has prayed sent back a message now Hezekiah has prayed concerning that now he doesn't send a message to Isaiah but Isaiah sends a message to him thus saith the Lord God of Israel verse 21 where hast thou has prayed to me God heard his prayer God heard his prayer and then God unfolds the word that now is coming against Sennacherib he goes down through here within the scriptures and he goes in he says now notice in verse 27 let me skip to there here is God speaking therefore there inhabitance talking about the other lands were of small power they were dismayed and confounded they were as the grass of the field as the green herb as the grass on the housetop as the corn blasted before it be grown up but I know thy abode and by going out and by coming in and i rage against me this is God taking up the barrel you ain't talked against Celtic life you talked against me hallelujah when the enemy makes an approach on one of God's children he's got God on his hands let everything be set in the manner that God can step right down and answer his challenge o because thy
