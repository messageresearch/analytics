[28:29] looking for me
[28:32] Porky came looking for me

[29:36] now
[29:38] cause I met the one who came and looking
[29:42] for me
[29:45] [Music]
[29:48] please remember
[29:51] I'm glad about that aren't you yeah
[29:54] yeah so appreciate
[29:56] the song service and just appreciate
[29:58] hearing your worship back there and my
[30:01] goodness I when you're being blessed I'm
[30:03] being blessed I'm glad that the blesser
[30:06] just doesn't stay here
[30:07] amen but it just it I tell you I just
[30:10] love to see God's people be blessed and
[30:12] encouraged and it's catchy
[30:15] you know and I I just I think of it many
[30:18] times as I know I've said this over the
[30:19] years but I think about it many times I
[30:21] think you know how many times that we we
[30:23] come in here and we're looking and
[30:26] sometimes you might think that a person
[30:28] is shouting or being blessed because
[30:30] they feel good and everything's lined up
[30:32] and it isn't always the case
[30:34] because many times the blessing that's
[30:36] coming is just recognizing he's here
[30:39] and in the midst of everything that's
[30:41] taking place God is pouring out a
[30:43] blessing and they just made themselves
[30:45] beyond all circumstances available to
[30:47] receive that blessing he's already this
[30:50] is this is where we draw amen our
[30:52] strength from in our life from it comes
[30:54] from him
[30:55] and we are just we are just so thankful
[30:57] to the Lord for that tonight and we want
[31:00] to just remember as we go into prayer I
[31:03] was listening to the prayer request and
[31:05] uh I didn't get a chance to get this
[31:09] to to Paul or the others but I want to
[31:11] remember brother Bobby Carper in prayer
[31:13] he's not not feeling well
[31:16] I've been in and out of the bed and just
[31:19] wanted to just remember him in prayer
[31:21] that the Lord will just touch him
[31:23] and give him strength and you know we
[31:25] prayed about that because he just had
[31:26] just fought through it different times
[31:28] brother Bobby fights with that where
[31:30] probably I don't think there's anybody
[31:31] else in the congregation has dealt with
[31:33] that because of particular surgery he
[31:36] went through years and years ago where
[31:38] he just you just everything just gets so
[31:40] blocked up and you can't there's nothing
[31:42] you can do and you can't even you can't
[31:45] even eat and you want to eat but you've
[31:46] been no better than to eat at all and so
[31:49] he's dealt with that at different times
[31:51] and uh
[31:52] when I say at different times sometimes
[31:54] it just it it just happens multiple
[31:56] times and then
[31:58] here just not feeling just kind of the
[32:00] congestion of things like that and
[32:02] coughing and so I just ask that we just
[32:05] remember him in prayer also brother
[32:06] Danny Lewis to text me let me know he
[32:08] wasn't feeling well as well and wouldn't
[32:10] be in service tonight so I know there's
[32:12] a lot of other requests
[32:14] as well there's request on our hearts
[32:16] and I'm glad that God's mindful of those
[32:18] you have a request on your heart you
[32:21] just want to make known to the Lord by
[32:22] an uplifted hand and let's just invite
[32:25] the Lord Jesus and would you just pray
[32:27] with me for these needs and let's just
[32:29] invite him to come in a special way here
[32:31] Heavenly Father
[32:34] Lord we are are standing here Lord

[33:54] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[33:57] amen
[33:59] amen let's look in the Bible if we could
[34:01] to Job chapter 2 thank you musicians
[34:06] in Job chapter 2.
[34:10] I just want to read just a few verses of
[34:12] scripture here
[34:16] in Job chapter 2 verse 1 it says again
[34:18] there was a day when the sons of God
[34:21] came to present themselves before the
[34:23] Lord
[34:24] and Satan came also among them to
[34:27] present himself before the Lord
[34:30] and the Lord said unto Satan from whence
[34:33] cometh thou and Satan answered the Lord
[34:35] and said from going to and fro in the
[34:38] earth and from walking up and down in it
[34:41] and the Lord said unto Satan hast thou
[34:43] considered my servant job that there is
[34:47] none like him in the earth a perfect and
[34:50] an upright man one that feareth God and
[34:54] asketh Evil
[34:56] and still beholdeth fast his Integrity
[35:00] although thou movest me against him to
[35:04] destroy him without cause
[35:07] and Satan answered the Lord and said
[35:09] skin for skin yea all that a man has
[35:13] will he give for his life
[35:15] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[35:18] his bone and his flesh and he will curse
[35:21] thee to thy face
[35:23] now if you read by here in this this
[35:25] verse 5
[35:27] it it it it would read as though it was
[35:30] God's hand upon job and job job even
[35:32] would even express this in job 19.
[35:35] brother Bram will bring us around to it
[35:37] it wasn't God's hand but God was
[35:40] overseeing
[35:41] so we understand that it's it's God the
[35:44] hand of God because nothing can come our
[35:46] way no test no trial nothing unless God
[35:48] first permits it and the Lord said unto
[35:51] Satan behold he is in thine hand but
[35:54] save his life in verse 7 so Satan went
[35:57] forth from the presence of the Lord and
[35:59] smote job with sore boils from the soul
[36:02] of his foot unto his crown and he took
[36:05] him a pot shirt to scrape himself with
[36:07] all and he sat down among the ashes
[36:10] then said his wife unto him Dost thou
[36:14] still retain thine Integrity Curse God
[36:18] and die
[36:19] but he said unto her thou speakest as
[36:24] one of the foolish women speaketh notice
[36:26] job never called her a foolish woman
[36:28] but here is discernment
[36:31] is Discerning you're speaking as a
[36:34] foolish woman
[36:36] so he's caught that what shall we
[36:39] receive good at the hand of God and
[36:42] shall we not receive evil in all this
[36:45] did not job sin with his lips
[36:50] and not if they'll go pull the next
[36:52] scripture up and you don't have to turn
[36:53] there let me just read that before we're
[36:55] seated out of second Corinthians 4 verse
[36:57] 7. but we have this treasure speaking of
[37:01] God's life this Revelation this light we
[37:05] have this treasure in Earthen vessels
[37:08] vessels that are fragile
[37:12] vessels that like that of a vase you
[37:16] would not treat a vase or piece of
[37:19] Pottery rough because you know it can
[37:23] break
[37:25] we have this treasure in Earthen vessels
[37:28] that the Excellency of the power may be
[37:32] of God
[37:33] and not of us
[37:35] what a way God chose to convey or hide
[37:38] his power and he did it you or I would
[37:41] not have chosen Earth and vessel a
[37:43] vessel that's weak a vessel that's frail
[37:45] a vast vessel that is so susceptible to
[37:48] so many things but God chose it that way
[37:51] so that he might be fully on display
[37:54] amen may God bless you bless the reading
[37:56] of the word as you're being seated
[37:59] I'd like to continue just to speak here
[38:01] just a few moments
[38:03] on the thought we'd looked at a couple
[38:05] weeks ago
[38:07] unappropriate response
[38:10] and uh I would say that
[38:14] in one way
[38:15] job remember job speaks in one place of
[38:19] the scripture
[38:21] where he had feared something like this
[38:23] happening
[38:25] and he said that which I feared has come
[38:28] upon me
[38:30] and we in ourselves yet we know that as
[38:33] the prophet would direct us in the
[38:35] message perfect faith that we're not to
[38:37] be occupied or directed by fear there's
[38:39] a lot of thoughts there's a lot of
[38:41] things that can come to you and I that
[38:44] is very uncertain but there's one thing
[38:47] that's certain in the midst of every
[38:50] situation and no matter what it is and
[38:53] that's the Lord
[38:54] and that's who we're looking to because
[38:56] there's not one of us you know we say
[38:58] this but sometimes I wonder how much we
[39:01] really conceptualize it and take it in
[39:03] we're not even promised the next breath
[39:08] right we don't even know the next breath
[39:11] not let alone coming out and getting on
[39:13] the roads and going home into a job
[39:15] we're not promised even the next breath
[39:19] and sometimes we take even that for we
[39:22] can take that for granted I don't
[39:23] believe meaningly but to understand that
[39:26] in all of these things this is why every
[39:30] moment our trust is in the Lord
[39:34] and when we see this in the scripture
[39:37] here I I don't believe that this is
[39:40] something that we or I premeditate of
[39:42] what is my response going to be what is
[39:45] my response but I believe that we are
[39:48] looking to God and I believe it's God
[39:51] that gives us Direction and orders the
[39:55] response that comes out of our life
[39:58] because of our best late intentions
[40:01] there is nothing nothing that within
[40:04] ourselves that we could actually give
[40:07] the right or the appropriate response
[40:10] that comes from our relationship with
[40:14] almighty God
[40:16] and I just I want to say it in this way
[40:18] when we're looking at this as I
[40:19] mentioned before appropriate response
[40:22] it's not in any way when we take this
[40:24] thought as though coming to direct us of
[40:28] this is how you should respond this is
[40:30] how you should respond but we want to
[40:32] look at the word of God and how God
[40:34] gives us Direction and how we can look
[40:37] that there is a source that you and I we
[40:41] are able to draw from and there is a
[40:43] response that comes from the Throne of
[40:46] God and emanates out through our lives
[40:49] and I just just drawing from these words
[40:52] remember this is what we read in Job
[40:54] chapter 2.
[40:56] we're seeing we're seeing a man that is
[41:00] not dis disapproved but we're seeing one
[41:03] who is approved of God
[41:05] we're not witnessing one who is being
[41:07] corrected we're witnessing one who's
[41:10] being pruned
[41:12] we're not witnessing an anger and the
[41:14] wrath of God that's not what we're
[41:16] witnessing we're witnessing a trial and
[41:19] a test that is come upon job because
[41:23] there was a testimony going on in heaven
[41:26] job didn't know about that testimony
[41:29] service
[41:30] but what was more important job knew him
[41:34] who was doing the bragging in heaven
[41:39] and so when I look at this remember here
[41:42] we come into this chapter and all of all
[41:45] of jobs the wealth the his his children
[41:49] there of the ten children here they are
[41:51] you know the children are gone all of
[41:54] these all everything that is all around
[41:56] him in his environment that has been
[41:59] touched now when this this this
[42:02] testimony and God is putting the
[42:05] testimony forth once again as Satan has
[42:08] come with a petition to want to touch
[42:10] job's life and I want to draw you into
[42:12] two two places of the scripture here
[42:14] tonight where God speaks to Satan and
[42:19] he's asking him have you considered job
[42:22] a perfect man in verse three an upright
[42:24] man one that feareth God and a skeweth
[42:27] evil and still he hold it fast his
[42:31] integrity and I want you to catch that
[42:33] that verse of scripture that portion
[42:36] still he holdeth fast his integrity
[42:39] his wife mentions to him in verse 9 she
[42:43] says Dost thou still retain thine
[42:47] integrity and those two words holdth and
[42:50] retain it's the very same word and it
[42:52] means to be strengthened to Prevail to
[42:56] be hardened to be strong become strong
[43:00] courageous to be firm or grow firm or be
[43:04] Resolute so when we look at this
[43:08] job job is maintaining his Integrity
[43:13] because there has been a revelation of
[43:19] his sacrifice to him personally
[43:22] this is not
[43:24] DNA of job as though that we are to
[43:28] Aspire to be like job but it was whom
[43:31] job knew that gave him the strength in
[43:36] the midst of the trial
[43:38] and so God gives us an example or in
[43:41] samples in other words it is that of a
[43:44] display of what he did there this same
[43:48] life it will reproduce itself in the
[43:52] life of his children as testoster trials
[43:55] as situations come and it lets you and I
[43:59] see even in the midst of this there is a
[44:01] prevailing strength that comes from that
[44:06] revelation
[44:07] brother Brown would say it like this
[44:08] there's many many other things but I
[44:10] just want to draw from this part out of
[44:13] the message I know
[44:15] Brother Brad says job he's speaking of
[44:17] referring to that testimony meeting that
[44:19] was going on he says job not knowing all
[44:22] these things going on it brought the
[44:25] patriarch into a deep distress yet
[44:28] somehow when all was gone from him he
[44:32] still maintained his position in Christ
[44:35] I know my redeemer liveth and brother
[44:38] Brad makes this statement here he says
[44:41] now we come to those places
[44:45] we come to those places for we all come
[44:49] and I believe today he said we're
[44:51] gathered here for something like that
[44:52] for the same purpose we're all on the
[44:56] ash heaps
[44:58] I won't go into that tonight because
[45:00] sometimes the way the ash sheep itself
[45:02] could be brother random is explaining
[45:04] that he himself has just been on an ash
[45:06] sheep and the ash sheep he was on was
[45:09] when he went and toured uh T.L Osborne
[45:12] some Ministries and you know rubbing his
[45:15] hand on the marble pillars and
[45:16] everything else and realizing these
[45:19] Ministries came out from under my
[45:21] Ministry and here he starts into a state
[45:24] and saying I guess the Lord you just
[45:26] couldn't trust me
[45:28] now you or I would look at that and say
[45:30] that's not much of an ashy but be
[45:33] careful
[45:34] every one of us even in all of our
[45:38] weakness where the test comes there is
[45:41] an action
[45:44] it's very easy to look at somebody
[45:45] else's Ash Heath and say come on
[45:50] but we don't say come on we want to
[45:53] encourage them to know like Paul said
[45:54] the comfort that we are comforting you
[45:57] with is the same Comfort we've received
[45:59] in our tribulation
[46:01] is that right
[46:03] is to comfort one another that my
[46:05] brother my sister God is seeing you
[46:08] through
[46:09] the Lord is bringing you through I may
[46:11] not they may not know it and it doesn't
[46:12] have to be some feeling that I receive
[46:15] when somebody says it it's true
[46:18] God is seeing us through
[46:21] so notice when the ram says we are all
[46:23] on the ashes
[46:25] we have our troubles our ups and downs
[46:29] our bad moments our sicknesses our
[46:33] heartaches our disappointments I'm
[46:36] talking to Believers tonight
[46:37] yeah so we come to he said like this on
[46:41] an Easter morning to find words of
[46:44] comfort now notice what job says in job
[46:47] 19 23 remember throughout this time in
[46:51] the Book of Job
[46:53] job is not aware of that conversation
[46:56] that took place in heaven job doesn't
[46:59] understand what's even taking place and
[47:01] this is where brother Brandon picks it
[47:03] up and he says if we could understand it
[47:06] we would no longer need faith
[47:09] but faith is simply that I trust him he
[47:14] knows what he's doing anybody ever felt
[47:16] like circumstances are completely out of
[47:18] control
[47:20] I don't know about you but there's many
[47:22] times you stand there and you feel like
[47:23] things are so out of control you don't
[47:25] know what's taking place all around you
[47:27] that's when faith is needed
[47:32] faith is in something that's exhibited
[47:35] or shown on a Mountaintop
[47:39] but faith is shown when we're in the
[47:41] valley
[47:43] when we don't know the next step to take
[47:46] and it looks like notice disappointments
[47:48] our ups our Downs
[47:50] all of these things they come you can
[47:53] never you never we realize as a Believer
[47:56] you never get to a place in your walk
[47:58] with God that you don't experience
[48:00] disappointments
[48:04] this is why when the Lord Jesus came the
[48:06] Bible says he was a man acquainted with
[48:10] sorrows
[48:12] why did he have to become acquainted
[48:14] with it because we are acquainted with
[48:16] sorrows
[48:18] we experience ups and downs why is that
[48:22] because we are still dwelling in flesh
[48:26] bodies
[48:27] it's susceptible to get down it's
[48:30] susceptible to discouragement it's
[48:33] susceptible to all these things so we
[48:35] must never focus on it or ever think in
[48:38] a way brother random would say it in
[48:39] this way I believe in the message
[48:40] believe us without this he said don't
[48:42] ever think in this lifetime of this
[48:46] being glorified but he said what it must
[48:48] be is you must receive that strength and
[48:52] that change on the inside that enables
[48:55] your eye to bring the outer man in
[48:58] subjection
[48:59] and it's a as brother Brian I'm in the
[49:02] same quote described it a constant War
[49:08] okay you won the battle five minutes ago
[49:10] guess what there's another battle coming
[49:13] and it's not waiting till tomorrow
[49:17] it's paddle after battle after battle
[49:20] the Holy Ghost is not Battle free but
[49:23] the Holy Ghost is the strength of God
[49:25] that equips you as an overcomer in the
[49:29] midst of overcoming it's battle after
[49:31] battle overcome it after overcoming
[49:35] and whether you like it or not or you
[49:38] like it or not or I like it or not that
[49:40] here once the life of God has come on
[49:42] the inside it does not change everything
[49:45] all around me but it equips me with the
[49:48] strength on the inside and I know my
[49:51] enemy
[49:54] who is my enemy not Brian holdren
[49:58] I'm Tony Gomez not Richard Sanchez not
[50:01] not Kim Browning
[50:04] no it's not Bill Sanchez either I know
[50:06] what you're saying
[50:07] it's me me
[50:10] it's me
[50:14] it's a battle and sometimes we have to
[50:17] be reminded of that because even through
[50:20] that we can become disappointed
[50:24] it's not disappointed in God we get to
[50:26] looking at ourselves
[50:32] Hallelujah
[50:36] notice for job he's right here this this
[50:40] is expressing in job 19. and job is is
[50:44] looking at it and thinking that it's
[50:48] God's hand upon his life
[50:50] and remember
[50:53] tells us in three kinds of Believers as
[50:56] long as Satan could make job think
[51:02] it was his God that was doing it to him
[51:05] he had job whipped
[51:10] why because you're looking for us he's
[51:12] our Escape
[51:14] he's the one and yet when he's looking
[51:17] at God is doing this so what's he doing
[51:19] he's trying it's keeping him in a place
[51:22] and here he is this he's feeling whipped
[51:28] now watch I want you to watch this
[51:30] through this here is a Heroes a man of
[51:33] God it's the prophet of God this is a
[51:35] believer
[51:36] and in verse 23 says oh that my words
[51:39] were now written all that they were
[51:41] printed in a book that they were Graven
[51:43] with an iron pin and led in the rock
[51:45] forever for I know that my redeemer
[51:49] liveth and that he shall stand at the
[51:51] latter day upon the Earth and though
[51:53] after my skin worms destroyed this body
[51:56] yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I
[51:59] shall see for myself and mine eyes Shall
[52:02] Behold and not another though my Reigns
[52:05] be consumed within me if you and I if
[52:07] you haven't I encourage you tonight read
[52:10] the first part of this chapter when you
[52:12] get home
[52:13] because it would seem like this glorious
[52:16] Revelation doesn't fit there
[52:21] because for the first 22 verses job is
[52:24] defending himself and job is saying
[52:26] God's hands been moved against me
[52:30] but you know what that shows it shows
[52:32] how one is walking in their Humanity
[52:36] but it also shows let me read it to you
[52:39] just like this brother Brown describes
[52:42] him and says job stood and he looked
[52:46] it's important that we're standing and
[52:49] we're looking
[52:51] but it matters what we're looking at
[52:54] right no well let's say some things job
[52:56] let me just call the prophet is saying
[52:59] this he's seen his flesh all corruption
[53:02] he's seen blood all over him he's seen
[53:06] bull boils all over him his wife has
[53:08] come he's seen church members live he
[53:10] saw accusations come his way of being a
[53:13] secret Center he had his wife come into
[53:15] you look miserable why don't you curse
[53:16] God and die
[53:18] and brother Francis but about that time
[53:21] when he stayed with the word oh how
[53:23] important that statement is
[53:25] about that this is an appropriate
[53:27] response he stayed with the word
[53:32] if it had only been intellect
[53:36] it would have failed in that hour
[53:40] intellect can't hold
[53:42] because even when our intellect gives
[53:45] way
[53:46] there's got to be something deeper that
[53:48] holds you and I
[53:51] right there's got to be something
[53:53] greater that when the lights of the
[53:55] heaven go out or when the candlesticks
[53:57] get blown out there's got to be a
[53:59] greater light on the inside tying
[54:02] indwelling of an experience that holds
[54:05] you and I
[54:07] am but when I don't know what's going on
[54:08] I'm standing and I'm going to stay with
[54:11] the word I'm going to look to him yeah I
[54:13] see my boils yeah I see my
[54:15] disappointments yeah I see my sickness
[54:16] yeah I see all this around me I see the
[54:19] others departing this way and I see this
[54:21] but I'm gonna keep looking
[54:23] and My Sacrifice
[54:28] when he stayed with the word then the
[54:31] Lightnings began to flash Thunders
[54:33] roared and the prophet looked towards
[54:35] the sky
[54:36] he goes in to rehearse that verse I know
[54:37] my redeemer liveth notice
[54:40] but the brand draws our attention this
[54:42] first
[54:43] out of the midst of all this
[54:46] I know my redeemer liveth
[54:50] I know my redeemer
[54:52] He Who is to redeem me and the very next
[54:56] verse he connects them together my
[54:58] redeemer is God
[55:02] in my flesh I shall see God
[55:05] not another so I Redeemer who is it it
[55:08] wasn't the second person of the godhead
[55:10] it's God come down in Redemption for you
[55:14] and I
[55:15] so in the midst of all that was taking
[55:17] place in the midst of the boils and
[55:20] everything that was going on in his life
[55:22] in the midst of everything else there
[55:24] was an anchor in job's life
[55:32] like this he looked till he seen the
[55:35] resurrection well Samuel what are you
[55:37] saying well I believe what God is saying
[55:39] and directing with us and I've had this
[55:41] here we're looking right at some things
[55:43] here tonight that we've had before us
[55:45] here
[55:47] he was looking and he didn't stop
[55:49] looking
[55:51] so many times where the enemy comes at
[55:54] us and then we get our eyes off on other
[55:57] things keep looking at your sacrifice
[56:02] amen
[56:03] it's the only thing that's going to get
[56:05] you and I through tests and trials and
[56:08] remember the text and trials are not
[56:10] against us they are permitted to mold us
[56:14] and to shape us
[56:16] this is why when things come our way we
[56:19] it should not it should be the question
[56:21] of his Lord what are you trying to speak
[56:23] to my life
[56:25] you're not trying to speak condemnation
[56:27] but God has come to lead you and I and
[56:31] direct you and I what must I do stay
[56:34] with the word
[56:36] is that right
[56:39] because trials are going to come tests
[56:42] are going to come persecutions come
[56:47] but what will our response be
[56:51] what dictates our response well depends
[56:53] brother Samuel How Deep The persecution
[56:55] is that's not what dictates a real
[56:57] believer's response
[57:00] the response of the believer is dictated
[57:03] by the revelation of our sacrifice
[57:09] he looked till he seen the resurrection
[57:12] and know that he was included in it
[57:15] because he was keeping God's word I know
[57:18] that sounds that's very simple
[57:20] it's very simple
[57:22] but keeping God's word
[57:24] you can never get you never get above
[57:26] the ABCs because even when you get into
[57:28] algebra there's still ABCs there's a lot
[57:31] of variables that come our way right a
[57:34] lot of variables but there still is the
[57:36] ABCs in order to solve those problems it
[57:39] still takes ABCs so when you get into a
[57:42] big problem don't forsake the ABCs they
[57:45] are a part of every problem yeah
[57:49] my brother said no I'm big enough to
[57:51] handle this problem God will let you see
[57:53] really how big you are
[57:55] there's none of us that are big enough
[57:57] to handle problems
[57:59] and God will let us see you're not big
[58:02] enough but my God is big enough
[58:06] it's big enough and not big enough
[58:09] God allows the situation to come by our
[58:12] ways to let us and let it recognize and
[58:15] to see that God I'm not as big as I
[58:18] think I am
[58:19] that you might as well join them and say
[58:22] Amen with me
[58:25] you see we don't overcome but
[58:28] our knowledge we don't overcome by our
[58:30] intellectual understanding
[58:36] how many times you or I have seen
[58:37] situation you've seen over the years
[58:39] that people can quote the word
[58:42] they can call it a matter of fact they
[58:44] can finish certain quotes for what you
[58:45] do but that's not what counts
[58:48] what matters is where do we stand when
[58:51] situations come our way
[58:53] where do we stand in the midst of a test
[58:56] or a trial I tell your friends God
[58:58] doesn't come to put you and I doubt but
[59:00] he comes to let us know there is a
[59:03] resting place that you can stand
[59:07] I'm grateful for that
[59:10] this is why Brethren could say in the
[59:12] message how can overcome he said job
[59:15] offered the sacrifice he did everything
[59:18] God told him to do
[59:20] that's a simple key if you haven't done
[59:23] everything God's told you to do
[59:26] repent and do what you know to do is
[59:29] right
[59:31] right you can't stew in the past
[59:34] you can't live you can't live and God
[59:37] never intended you to live under
[59:39] condemnation it's Satan's desire to keep
[59:42] condemnation over your life
[59:45] it's like an eagle wanting to soar up
[59:47] and it hits those it it it it hits the
[59:49] bars of that cage and it comes right
[59:51] back down it's like well there's a hope
[59:53] there's a hole and it begins to rise and
[59:55] then the bars are there let me tell you
[59:57] there is one that is here to release the
[1:00:02] bars
[1:00:05] I'm glad about that
[1:00:08] he's a Liberator where the spirit of the
[1:00:10] Lord is there he is Liberty
[1:00:16] oh my more than just something that
[1:00:19] when we feel good
[1:00:21] sometimes there's times where maybe you
[1:00:23] might just talk something out and you
[1:00:24] feel good but it's got to come and
[1:00:26] Deliver us to where you're able to look
[1:00:29] and you know I'm free
[1:00:33] for the ram says he kept standing there
[1:00:35] he kept standing
[1:00:38] Joe kept standing there you know what
[1:00:41] they were you know what Satan was trying
[1:00:43] to do get him off that sacrifice
[1:00:46] but how could you get him off of that
[1:00:48] sacrifice
[1:00:49] because even though it was given as a
[1:00:51] type
[1:00:52] what identified
[1:00:55] job with the sacrifice that was in the
[1:00:58] mind of God was the revelation
[1:01:02] you can't separate a Believer from the
[1:01:06] revelation
[1:01:08] are you hearing me it doesn't matter how
[1:01:10] many tests how many trials doesn't
[1:01:12] matter what comes your way you can't
[1:01:14] separate a believer
[1:01:16] from divine revelation
[1:01:20] it's stronger than our mental abilities
[1:01:22] it's stronger than women what you think
[1:01:25] about yourself
[1:01:28] but the same I know this about myself
[1:01:30] but Revelation says I knew you before
[1:01:34] the foundation of the world
[1:01:37] and that's greater than what you know
[1:01:39] about yourself
[1:01:41] what does that do it causes me to submit
[1:01:45] to one who is in a greater Authority
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:52] the Bible goes under saying Hebrews 6 18
[1:01:55] then by two immutable things in which it
[1:01:57] was impossible for God to lie we might
[1:02:00] have a strong consolation who have fled
[1:02:03] for Refuge to lay hold upon the Hope set
[1:02:05] before us which hope we have as an
[1:02:09] anchor of the Soul
[1:02:10] both sure and steadfast and which
[1:02:13] interest into that within the Veil
[1:02:17] it enters in it's an anchor
[1:02:23] just like the anchor goes in when you're
[1:02:25] out fishing or
[1:02:27] they put the anchor in you realize that
[1:02:28] when it comes to these big storms
[1:02:31] hurricanes
[1:02:34] you know what they do they go in the
[1:02:35] navel they don't keep them tied to the
[1:02:38] dock you know why if they keep them
[1:02:40] ships tied to the dock they'll sink
[1:02:43] what do they do they launch out yeah
[1:02:46] yeah right into the midst of the storm
[1:02:48] why because they're built to a
[1:02:52] standstill
[1:02:56] let me say this to you
[1:02:58] you're built to withstand the storm
[1:03:03] you're built it's not this
[1:03:05] this is weak I said this is weak
[1:03:10] this this complains constantly
[1:03:12] right this is the guy right here why
[1:03:16] but it's the man on the inside
[1:03:20] that man that never had the beginning of
[1:03:22] days nor ending of life
[1:03:24] that one that is a part of the Eternal
[1:03:27] that which is the word that that is our
[1:03:31] source of strength
[1:03:33] and when we can let that guy have the
[1:03:36] right of way you'll Crest every way
[1:03:39] he comes out with the quickening power
[1:03:40] in our life because remember
[1:03:49] hello
[1:03:50] I'm quoting from the message but when
[1:03:52] the whole when the Holy Spirit has come
[1:03:54] what does it come for it's come for
[1:03:56] Redemption to redeem the seed
[1:03:59] to Quicken the seed to bring it to life
[1:04:01] and then that that the holy spirit is
[1:04:03] not a temporal gift it now here it has
[1:04:06] ushered Us in and directed us into
[1:04:08] eternal life
[1:04:10] because the only thing is eternal is the
[1:04:12] word
[1:04:12] right and so it isn't your eye it's the
[1:04:16] word in us that's riding out the storms
[1:04:20] of life
[1:04:22] yeah
[1:04:25] oh my
[1:04:27] think of this job brother Brandon would
[1:04:29] say this and I just just pressed
[1:04:32] in looking at these these
[1:04:35] statements that brother Brown here are
[1:04:37] some nights ago I just just began to
[1:04:40] pull up after looking at this for some
[1:04:41] time and just these two words job
[1:04:44] maintained
[1:04:45] it just struck me night
[1:04:48] brother Brian was talking about all this
[1:04:50] that's going on all around him job
[1:04:53] maintained the promise of God
[1:04:56] he maintained a fellowship in the hours
[1:04:59] of trial and so much that he cried I
[1:05:02] know my redeemer liveth
[1:05:04] he's saying when his when his wife said
[1:05:06] what she did I want you just to listen
[1:05:08] this job was under the blood he'd
[1:05:11] offered the burnt sacrifice this is this
[1:05:13] this is a this is a great distinction
[1:05:16] here he knowed he was righteous because
[1:05:18] that's what God required what had God
[1:05:22] required that he offered the sacrifice
[1:05:24] you see it's one thing for God to make
[1:05:27] known and God it has to be God to make
[1:05:29] known the way
[1:05:30] if God doesn't make known the way how
[1:05:33] are you or I know how to approach it
[1:05:35] you can't have confidence you can't have
[1:05:37] confidence in your approach you
[1:05:39] understand what I'm saying even when
[1:05:40] they were standing Before Peter that day
[1:05:42] said repent and be baptized in the name
[1:05:44] of Jesus Christ and you shall receive
[1:05:46] the gift of the Holy Ghost it's the word
[1:05:49] that is unfolding the way so that you
[1:05:52] and I might walk with the confidence
[1:05:55] in the path of the word
[1:05:59] right this is why the word of man does
[1:06:02] not produce confidence
[1:06:05] it produces hope
[1:06:11] but God's word and job took that and he
[1:06:15] offered up the sacrifice it wasn't good
[1:06:18] enough for job just to believe on the
[1:06:21] sacrifice
[1:06:24] another word for salvation but for job
[1:06:27] here he had to offer when God revealed
[1:06:30] to job this is the provided way this is
[1:06:36] the way because remember job wanted to
[1:06:37] worship God job wanted to talk to him
[1:06:40] job wanted to know about God who put
[1:06:42] that inside a job
[1:06:44] but put that there
[1:06:47] God put it there and a longing Rose
[1:06:50] within job and job had to offer that
[1:06:52] sacrifice he had to become connected
[1:06:56] with what God had revealed let me say
[1:06:58] this to you God reveals the appropriated
[1:07:01] way but you and I must act upon that way
[1:07:05] it's not enough to know what's right but
[1:07:08] it is to do what's right
[1:07:10] because if we don't do what's right and
[1:07:13] we know what's right it's iniquity
[1:07:16] right so we're not just knowing what's
[1:07:20] right is not enough that's not what was
[1:07:22] holding job was connected with his
[1:07:25] sacrifice
[1:07:27] he had come under the blood and he had
[1:07:29] Divine fellowship with God
[1:07:35] because he knew him as a person
[1:07:37] though he slayed me
[1:07:39] yet I will trust him
[1:07:43] right it's a no-so brother random talks
[1:07:46] it like this
[1:07:48] under the blood of
[1:07:51] dark in and out
[1:07:53] see this is what
[1:07:55] the real offering of the blood that when
[1:07:58] we become partakers of it you see the
[1:08:00] Lord Jesus offered up his life and we
[1:08:03] here we come the Holy Spirit deals with
[1:08:05] the life and we believe on that that's
[1:08:07] the first step
[1:08:10] but the full work is is that we come
[1:08:13] under that blood and we become partakers
[1:08:16] of that life
[1:08:19] then we are under the blood
[1:08:22] then there is fellowship one with
[1:08:24] another in the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:08:26] cleanses us from all sin everybody with
[1:08:28] me
[1:08:29] there's a fellowship it's a notion
[1:08:34] you see that's That's what Satan wants
[1:08:38] to work on
[1:08:39] Satan doesn't care how much you come to
[1:08:42] church how much you know about the
[1:08:44] message as long as you don't have any
[1:08:45] confidence that it's for you
[1:08:49] you don't care he's fine he's fine you
[1:08:51] can you can live that kind of a life
[1:08:52] he's fine with it you don't have
[1:08:54] confidence that it's for you but you see
[1:08:56] what God comes to do is deal with where
[1:08:59] is that lack of confidence
[1:09:01] now there can be many variables within
[1:09:04] that and God is still revealing and
[1:09:07] unfolding in our lives and there is a
[1:09:09] reality that takes place in us when you
[1:09:13] pass from Death unto life that you know
[1:09:16] it's not you're not looking back in
[1:09:19] condemnation there's a reality in your
[1:09:21] life
[1:09:22] you know I've passed from Death unto
[1:09:25] life
[1:09:26] something that is a reality that is
[1:09:28] changing your life let me say this to
[1:09:30] you it's not just what I don't drink no
[1:09:32] more I don't smoke no more I don't look
[1:09:34] at the wrong things no more it's deeper
[1:09:36] than that
[1:09:38] it's where he is your life
[1:09:42] it's where he's everything to you it's
[1:09:46] where every decision becomes based
[1:09:49] around him
[1:09:51] oh no
[1:09:52] it's where he is the theme of your life
[1:09:55] is that right
[1:09:57] this is where it comes down to the
[1:09:59] litmus this is where he comes down to
[1:10:01] the real a rubber meets the road and
[1:10:04] notice if there is anything anything
[1:10:06] that hinders from a no-so there's a
[1:10:10] remedy to take care of it
[1:10:14] you don't have to live one more day
[1:10:17] beneath your god-given privileges
[1:10:20] I want you to understand this right here
[1:10:22] tonight nobody lives beneath it but by
[1:10:26] their own choice
[1:10:29] God doesn't Force nobody to do it and
[1:10:32] the devil sure don't have any power to
[1:10:33] do it either
[1:10:35] there's traps and things that the enemy
[1:10:37] can put but there is a release through
[1:10:39] the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:10:43] is that right there's sufficient pardon
[1:10:45] and Grace you don't want to be like the
[1:10:47] man who was a soldier that was caught
[1:10:49] running in the in the line of fire he
[1:10:51] got caught running
[1:10:53] court-martial he was going to be shot
[1:10:55] right right but his buddy an intercessor
[1:10:59] one who really who who was interceding
[1:11:01] on his behalf went to President Lincoln
[1:11:03] President Lincoln wrote a simple note
[1:11:05] with his signature
[1:11:07] and here came a messenger with a letter
[1:11:10] a message from the president
[1:11:15] and his buddy wouldn't even look at it
[1:11:18] why are you mocking me
[1:11:20] why are you mocking me
[1:11:21] and remember you know you've heard the
[1:11:23] story
[1:11:25] they shot the man
[1:11:27] and here was the whole court case here's
[1:11:29] a letter that says this man's free his
[1:11:31] name's on it why was he shot
[1:11:36] and the verdict was
[1:11:37] that a pardon is not a part
[1:11:40] unless it's accepted
[1:11:43] as a part
[1:11:44] you don't earn a pardon you can't Merit
[1:11:48] a pardon you have to accept it
[1:11:53] you know what accept means I'm guilty
[1:11:56] but this is my freedom
[1:12:00] are you hearing me it's not it's not
[1:12:02] staying in the past but it's recognizing
[1:12:05] this is my Liberty let me tell you here
[1:12:07] tonight
[1:12:08] God has sealed his word with his
[1:12:12] presence this message has been sealed
[1:12:16] with cops on life
[1:12:21] the son of man whom the father has
[1:12:24] sealed
[1:12:25] he has sealed it with his presence the
[1:12:27] same holy spirit that gives unction
[1:12:29] tonight and this word is the same God
[1:12:31] signing his same one present right here
[1:12:33] tonight
[1:12:36] they had Fellowship they knew where they
[1:12:38] were standing he maintained job
[1:12:41] maintained this through his life
[1:12:45] he maintained this his Fellowship just
[1:12:47] the same
[1:12:48] nobody was righteous because he'd come
[1:12:50] by the way of the blood it held so good
[1:12:53] believing in the hours of Temptation
[1:12:55] though he slayed me yet I'll trust him
[1:12:57] that's what the blood does
[1:13:00] that's what fellas shift through the
[1:13:02] blood
[1:13:03] hey think of this this word we there's a
[1:13:06] common word for us maintain
[1:13:08] the word maintain it means to calls are
[1:13:10] enable
[1:13:11] for one to continue
[1:13:14] to keep something at the same level or
[1:13:18] rate
[1:13:19] to keep something in good condition
[1:13:23] to provide it with Necessities for life
[1:13:25] or existence
[1:13:27] it's to keep like a military unit
[1:13:29] equipment
[1:13:31] for battle
[1:13:33] job maintained his Fellowship
[1:13:37] throughout it all he maintained his
[1:13:41] position in Christ
[1:13:43] everything else all around
[1:13:46] he didn't have the answers for it
[1:13:48] but where was he standing he was
[1:13:50] standing on what he knew
[1:13:52] he was standing on what it was revealed
[1:13:54] to him
[1:13:56] and this is where our stand comes down
[1:13:58] that's why there has to be solid ground
[1:14:01] for us to stand upon
[1:14:04] that there's a place where we can stand
[1:14:06] and it's not sinking sand it's not
[1:14:08] slippery it's not shifting it's a place
[1:14:11] of firmness it's a place of solemnness
[1:14:14] it's a place where we can stand that
[1:14:17] I don't know about all this
[1:14:19] but I'm sure of this
[1:14:22] I'm sure of where I'm standing I'm sure
[1:14:24] of My Sacrifice job have you done this
[1:14:27] I'm not sure of that but I'm sure of
[1:14:28] this
[1:14:31] I might have a lot of speculating about
[1:14:33] like this but this I'm sure of yes
[1:14:37] and no matter what how they tried how it
[1:14:40] was tried you couldn't move him off of
[1:14:42] his sacrifice you know why
[1:14:44] for these were no longer between they
[1:14:47] had become one
[1:14:49] job and
[1:14:55] you and me and our sacrifice is to be
[1:14:58] one
[1:14:59] true
[1:15:00] right
[1:15:02] this is why Paul would write that when
[1:15:04] testings and everything comes around our
[1:15:07] life it says we bear about in the body
[1:15:10] the dying of the Lord Jesus
[1:15:13] what was the dying nevertheless not my
[1:15:16] will thine will be done
[1:15:20] who took the form of a sermon a Living
[1:15:22] Sacrifice not my will thine will be done
[1:15:25] we bear about in the body
[1:15:29] hey Paul that the life of Jesus might be
[1:15:33] made manifest in our mortal flesh
[1:15:37] God knows how to keep this guy humble
[1:15:41] now it's entrusted to you and I but God
[1:15:44] knows we need Divine assistance
[1:15:46] he's equipped us on the inside but God
[1:15:49] also allows situations to arise that
[1:15:51] then you and I can look at it and we
[1:15:53] realize there's a greater one
[1:15:56] there's a greater one
[1:15:59] Ecclesiastes Ecclesiastes 7 18. let me
[1:16:01] just try to get here
[1:16:03] the Bible said it is good that thou
[1:16:04] should take hold of this yea also from
[1:16:07] this withdrawal not thine hand for he
[1:16:09] that feareth God shall come forth of
[1:16:13] them all notice who he that feareth God
[1:16:18] he reverences God
[1:16:21] reverence is where remember what job was
[1:16:22] doing job was staying with the word
[1:16:25] so you remember you stay with what God's
[1:16:27] revealed and when he reveals more we
[1:16:29] walk in it
[1:16:32] wisdom verse 19 strengthen us the wise
[1:16:36] more than ten Mighty Men which are in
[1:16:39] the city
[1:16:42] what what gives you a nice strength
[1:16:44] wisdom
[1:16:47] what kind of wisdom not Earthly wisdom
[1:16:51] Earthly wisdom reasons against the word
[1:16:54] of God
[1:16:56] but this is talking about a wisdom that
[1:17:00] gives strength to the wise
[1:17:06] this is the same wisdom without running
[1:17:09] out on this this is the same promise
[1:17:12] that God in this hour when all the
[1:17:15] corruption and all the deceit and
[1:17:17] everything would be at the height of
[1:17:20] where it is he promised in this hour he
[1:17:22] would send the gift of wisdom
[1:17:25] what is it a prophet
[1:17:28] yeah is that right a prophet that went
[1:17:31] uncover that I'm cut her working
[1:17:33] uncover everything through the Earth
[1:17:36] what did that
[1:17:39] and that wisdom you and I are partakers
[1:17:42] of that wisdom
[1:17:45] that's not from a seminary
[1:17:47] because all of that wisdom has led right
[1:17:50] back into her
[1:17:52] that wisdom has no power to extend her
[1:18:04] I know of individuals here of her and
[1:18:06] I'm seeing things seeing here in this
[1:18:07] country I'm saying I'm no of individuals
[1:18:09] that at one point in time in their stand
[1:18:12] even in their denomination there's
[1:18:14] certain things that they would stand
[1:18:16] against let me say this whether it's
[1:18:19] domination or not no denomination what
[1:18:22] gives a route right to alter true
[1:18:25] holiness
[1:18:27] Holiness is holiness
[1:18:30] are you hearing me now
[1:18:32] the message then all of a sudden bring
[1:18:34] bring about Holiness that was always in
[1:18:37] the word of God
[1:18:39] this is why when people walk away as
[1:18:41] soon as they walk away they put their
[1:18:43] short britches on and drinking their
[1:18:45] beer cutting their hair and everything
[1:18:46] else you know why because they were
[1:18:48] never connected with the Holy nature of
[1:18:52] almighty God
[1:18:54] and it never was a true worshiper
[1:18:56] because the Bible says in the Book of
[1:18:58] Psalms in the beauty of holiness
[1:19:01] Worship the Lord
[1:19:05] Holiness is his own nature be ye holy
[1:19:09] for I am Holy saith the Lord
[1:19:13] see it runs right back in there's no
[1:19:15] strength it becomes a wisdom
[1:19:20] Justice you know brought to my attention
[1:19:22] where some have said oh you know hey
[1:19:25] they don't have to do certain things no
[1:19:26] more
[1:19:28] oh we we've been delivered out abundance
[1:19:31] I'm talking about people and one time it
[1:19:32] would hold to a certain thing even in
[1:19:34] denomination would hold to a certain
[1:19:36] thing but now we've been delivered out
[1:19:37] of bondage we don't have to wear this
[1:19:38] and do this and do that bondage
[1:19:40] but you see it's only bondage if your
[1:19:42] nature doesn't match
[1:19:47] are you hearing me and clean a pig
[1:19:49] you can put him in
[1:19:53] help me somebody but you put him at a
[1:19:56] screen door don't you dare turn your
[1:19:58] back because if you don't have this
[1:20:00] nature change the first hint of mud he's
[1:20:04] gone
[1:20:05] what is that you say it's a pig what
[1:20:08] makes him a pig it's nature
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:12] but if you could ever take that nature
[1:20:14] of a pig out of him and put a sheet
[1:20:16] nature in him you could blow all of the
[1:20:20] dirt right by the screen door you could
[1:20:22] have buckets of mud
[1:20:25] and you know what there ain't nothing
[1:20:28] there
[1:20:30] ain't nothing there
[1:20:32] you know why because everything that was
[1:20:35] identified with the mud everything that
[1:20:36] loved the mud everything that enjoyed
[1:20:38] the money is calm
[1:20:41] it ain't removing the mud it's removed
[1:20:44] the nature that loves the mud
[1:20:47] that's what the real revelation of a
[1:20:49] sacrifice he comes to do he comes to
[1:20:52] operate on the Inside Man
[1:20:56] because otherwise you're living alone I
[1:20:58] can't do this and the pastor sees me out
[1:21:00] here and oh what's he going to do about
[1:21:01] it that's bondage
[1:21:04] what doesn't want you because he's
[1:21:06] always seeing you
[1:21:08] as a matter of fact brother Brandon
[1:21:09] would say like this so clear in the
[1:21:11] message he said there are women wearing
[1:21:12] things that are not even shouldn't even
[1:21:15] be worn behind closed doors
[1:21:17] Hallelujah
[1:21:20] Glory how do I tell you what a lot of
[1:21:23] freebies here tonight huh
[1:21:25] but this is appropriate response
[1:21:28] I said this is appropriate response
[1:21:31] wisdom strengtheneth the last more than
[1:21:33] ten Mighty Men which are in the city
[1:21:37] so the mightiest of men the best
[1:21:38] warriors the best oh there's these guys
[1:21:40] are so strong no there's something
[1:21:42] greater
[1:21:43] than 10 Mighty Men
[1:21:45] 10 being what tribulation there's
[1:21:48] something that'll keep you in the midst
[1:21:50] of tribulation
[1:21:51] there's something what is it the wisdom
[1:21:54] of God
[1:21:56] what did the Bible say in the Book of
[1:21:57] James If any man
[1:21:59] lacks wisdom
[1:22:02] let him look up and ask God who
[1:22:06] liberally giveth to all
[1:22:11] right Lord I don't know about this I'm
[1:22:13] asking
[1:22:15] excuse me because he will give of wisdom
[1:22:19] that you and I have need of
[1:22:22] I'm glad about that aren't you for there
[1:22:24] is not a just man upon the Earth
[1:22:27] that doeth good
[1:22:29] and sinneth not
[1:22:32] let me read that again there's not a
[1:22:34] just man upon the Earth that doeth good
[1:22:36] and sinneth not
[1:22:45] um
[1:22:46] sticks a little bit in our crawl don't
[1:22:48] it
[1:22:52] because
[1:22:54] job was not perfect in himself
[1:22:59] what God was looking at when he said
[1:23:01] have you considered my my servant job a
[1:23:05] perfect man who is skeweth a Boris evil
[1:23:10] what was he saying job's confession
[1:23:13] was in his sacrifice
[1:23:17] the Bible says Be You therefore perfect
[1:23:19] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[1:23:23] God taught Abraham what before me and be
[1:23:27] thou perfect
[1:23:30] how can you and I be perfect impossible
[1:23:34] but there's a perfect one
[1:23:37] who came down from Glory
[1:23:39] took my place took your place and now
[1:23:42] through the shedding of that perfect
[1:23:44] blood there comes a perfect loosening
[1:23:49] or the Holy Spirit comes in
[1:23:51] and through that new birth We Stand
[1:23:53] identified in him
[1:23:56] and through that Perfection of his life
[1:23:58] that's what draws you and I to the place
[1:24:00] to say forgive me
[1:24:03] that's what draws you and I into the
[1:24:06] place of confessing Lord You Are My
[1:24:09] righteousness Lord
[1:24:11] because a just man doeth good but
[1:24:14] there's not one not one
[1:24:17] that is without fault or failing but we
[1:24:19] have to look up
[1:24:21] are you hearing me we're not talking
[1:24:22] about a weakness of sacrifice we're
[1:24:24] talking about the strength of the
[1:24:25] sacrifice that there is a strength on
[1:24:28] the inside that you can't keep a Son of
[1:24:30] God down
[1:24:32] you can't keep a daughter of light on
[1:24:34] God down why there's a perfect Sacrifice
[1:24:37] by a perfect life
[1:24:39] man
[1:24:42] Isaiah
[1:24:44] 33.
[1:24:47] let me just read this and we'll close
[1:24:49] here
[1:24:50] because there's no way I can move
[1:24:52] through this
[1:24:54] this is where I wanted to bring us to
[1:24:57] into some of these places tonight
[1:25:00] the Lord is exalted
[1:25:03] Isaiah 33 5 for he dwelleth on high he
[1:25:06] hath to filled Zion
[1:25:09] with judgment and righteousness
[1:25:11] and wisdom
[1:25:13] and knowledge
[1:25:15] shall be the stability of thy times
[1:25:19] and strength of salvation
[1:25:22] the fear of the Lord
[1:25:24] is his treasure
[1:25:28] notice what will be the stability what
[1:25:30] is our stability
[1:25:32] wisdom
[1:25:34] and knowledge
[1:25:36] not Earthly but that which comes from
[1:25:39] God
[1:25:40] that's what stabilizes us as Believers
[1:25:44] in this hour
[1:25:46] oh
[1:25:47] is the wisdom is the revelation
[1:25:50] of almighty God of God speaking to us
[1:25:53] you know sometimes it isn't that God
[1:25:55] gives you the answer to what you're
[1:25:57] going through he just simply comes by
[1:26:00] he might use a minister he might be
[1:26:02] listening to the message God has ways
[1:26:05] and he'll come by and let you know
[1:26:10] let me tell you something that's as good
[1:26:12] as if he gave you an answer
[1:26:15] because he's letting you know I know
[1:26:18] oh yeah
[1:26:20] I know I care I'm mindful and wisdom and
[1:26:25] knowledge is that it it
[1:26:27] stabilizes it'll be the stability of thy
[1:26:29] times
[1:26:31] what help what what stabilizes US
[1:26:34] what keeps us
[1:26:37] is the wisdom that comes from God
[1:26:41] that wisdom that look
[1:26:43] when I don't know the next moment I know
[1:26:45] where I'm standing
[1:26:47] like job I know where I'm standing
[1:26:50] and the appropriate response within it
[1:26:52] is we stand
[1:26:56] it's not the time to pull back
[1:26:59] when things
[1:27:01] when things aren't going the way that we
[1:27:03] think this should go or this isn't going
[1:27:05] just right listen
[1:27:07] these are things we have to learn and
[1:27:09] battle through
[1:27:11] are you hearing me tonight
[1:27:13] this is not condemnation 101. but it's
[1:27:16] learning 101.
[1:27:18] it's renewing of our mind because come
[1:27:21] on now because there's times where we
[1:27:22] can go we have certain responses to
[1:27:25] things
[1:27:28] without thinking the bull came to
[1:27:31] brother Brannon got up was coming at him
[1:27:34] and that pasture what did he say he did
[1:27:35] reach for his gun nobody had tell him
[1:27:38] that
[1:27:39] he just reached for it guess what he
[1:27:41] wasn't there
[1:27:43] it was on the seat of his truck
[1:27:45] and there's things that God
[1:27:47] brings you and I to this place
[1:27:52] because there's things that God wants
[1:27:54] you and I to see in the midst of a test
[1:27:57] or a trial in the midst of things in our
[1:28:00] life that we're looking at and sometimes
[1:28:01] we don't see him the way God sees him
[1:28:05] but when God begins to unfold that to us
[1:28:09] that's a moment to say
[1:28:11] be it unto me Lord
[1:28:13] forgive me I didn't realize that was
[1:28:15] standing I didn't realize that was
[1:28:17] hindering but see God does that
[1:28:19] in his own time
[1:28:21] because there are certain ways that
[1:28:25] we can respond to things
[1:28:30] and you know your response matters
[1:28:33] your response matters
[1:28:36] this is why when you get down and
[1:28:38] everyone I'm speaking to individuals
[1:28:40] that are veterans much older than myself
[1:28:42] that there have been times they've been
[1:28:44] down
[1:28:46] can I get a witness people been down
[1:28:50] it didn't feel like doing certain things
[1:28:52] or so forth and responses
[1:28:54] right
[1:28:57] the time when situations come
[1:28:59] disappointments ups and downs let me
[1:29:01] tell you something
[1:29:03] the world cannot satisfy
[1:29:07] what you have made of
[1:29:12] and if you go and try to satisfy other
[1:29:14] things well I just need a little bit of
[1:29:16] an outlet that you're not getting no
[1:29:18] strength from that
[1:29:20] I'll just I'll just look at a few things
[1:29:22] here you know on YouTube you're not
[1:29:24] going to get no strength from that
[1:29:28] he is the stabilizer
[1:29:31] of our life
[1:29:33] that's the time the battle where we have
[1:29:36] to say when the enemy comes along and
[1:29:39] says you know what
[1:29:41] I don't feel like going to church
[1:29:43] I don't feeling it you know why I've had
[1:29:46] a week
[1:29:49] sorry don't have no flowering way to say
[1:29:51] it
[1:29:53] right I don't feel like it this is the
[1:29:56] time we're Overcomers overcome
[1:30:01] this is the time where Overcomers stand
[1:30:04] these are appropriate responses
[1:30:07] that though I don't feel any different
[1:30:09] don't but I know that God is going to
[1:30:12] meet my need
[1:30:13] the devil could whisper you sword yeah
[1:30:15] but you know you could
[1:30:18] you could just you could get it all at
[1:30:20] home
[1:30:21] you know it's the condition your heart
[1:30:22] boy that God knows how to quote
[1:30:23] scripture man
[1:30:25] come on now preach with me
[1:30:27] what's he trying to do alter the
[1:30:30] response
[1:30:31] but there's times where you just simply
[1:30:33] have to take the jurisdiction over your
[1:30:36] body
[1:30:37] over your mind in other words like in
[1:30:41] the prayer letter that was sent out with
[1:30:43] every prayer cloth from The Prophet's
[1:30:45] office when there was a need in a
[1:30:47] person's body he ruined it like this and
[1:30:50] said you must doubt your doubts
[1:30:54] and believe what God's word has said
[1:30:58] about your case
[1:30:59] and confess it
[1:31:02] that's an appropriate response
[1:31:06] that's an appropriate response
[1:31:11] say God help me to evaluate my responses
[1:31:15] something doesn't go your way you just
[1:31:16] pull off
[1:31:18] come on I'm not here to condemn you I'm
[1:31:19] here to look but let's evaluate our
[1:31:21] responses when things don't go just
[1:31:22] exactly right or things aren't coming
[1:31:24] let's evaluate say God I want the
[1:31:26] appropriate response what is the
[1:31:28] appropriate response it's him
[1:31:30] Lord renew my mind Lord
[1:31:33] renew my mind
[1:31:36] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:31:38] about drawing strength from the
[1:31:39] sacrifice
[1:31:41] he's not only the atoner of our sin is
[1:31:45] the atonement of our sickness
[1:31:48] he is all that we have need of
[1:31:52] he's our sufficiency
[1:31:54] when he made himself known to Abraham he
[1:31:57] said I am a shady eye
[1:32:00] the strength
[1:32:06] when I am weak when I'm in trouble when
[1:32:09] I'm down I call on the Lord and he hears
[1:32:12] me
[1:32:14] right
[1:32:15] it's one of what what kind of call is
[1:32:17] that it's a faith call Lord I know
[1:32:20] I know Lord
[1:32:22] you're my Lord
[1:32:24] you're my God
[1:32:27] Hallelujah
[1:32:29] oh God help us
[1:32:31] help us Lord to have appropriate
[1:32:34] responses
[1:32:36] remorless Lord shape us renewing of our
[1:32:39] mind renewing Lord Of Our Lives that the
[1:32:42] responses themselves might be
[1:32:44] sponsors that bring glory to his name
[1:32:48] aren't you glad about that I'm glad that
[1:32:51] he's working on us I'm glad he's
[1:32:53] changing us I'm glad he's here still
[1:32:55] stabilizing hearts and lives that maybe
[1:32:57] haven't went all the way but he's here
[1:32:59] to stabilize that life and he's here to
[1:33:02] minister to our needs to encourage us
[1:33:04] and say hey
[1:33:05] you're still growing I'm still working
[1:33:08] on you
[1:33:09] I'm still molding you I'm still shaping
[1:33:11] you
[1:33:12] I'm not trying to make you a perfect
[1:33:14] person you already stand perfect in me
[1:33:17] but I'm just wanting that perfect um
[1:33:19] Perfection of my life just to flow
[1:33:21] freely through you Lord what must I do
[1:33:24] oh I'm not asking you to change yourself
[1:33:26] I'm asking you just to yield to me
[1:33:29] and I will change
[1:33:31] I will mold you I will save you I will
[1:33:34] transform your life but Lord I know just
[1:33:37] yield to me just what do I do to stay in
[1:33:40] my presence
[1:33:41] but Lord I gotta go to work tomorrow but
[1:33:43] he would say to you my son my presence
[1:33:45] is not confined to this building
[1:33:48] but my presence will go with you
[1:33:51] but lord I can't listen to a message all
[1:33:53] day tomorrow but my presence is not
[1:33:55] confined to listening to a message
[1:33:57] there are times for that but lord I
[1:33:59] can't pray all day I'm date them or you
[1:34:00] can pray without ceasing but remember
[1:34:01] it's not always about being in your
[1:34:03] prayer closet or on your knees
[1:34:06] but Lord how do I abide in your presence
[1:34:08] you can invite me even in the thoughts
[1:34:10] of your mind
[1:34:13] and just begin to think upon my goodness
[1:34:16] and when you my son my daughter begins
[1:34:19] to sense the
[1:34:23] that's my presence
[1:34:28] so
[1:34:29] we're going to entertain
[1:34:31] what our sacrifice is
[1:34:33] because that's our identification
[1:34:36] because when God looks for you or me
[1:34:38] he's not looking at me or you he's
[1:34:41] looking at the sacrifice
[1:34:44] and as long as my confession is in the
[1:34:47] sacrifice it's accepted
[1:34:50] you're loving tonight
[1:34:52] let's pray father
[1:34:55] thank you Lord for your mercy once again
[1:34:57] see
[1:34:59] Lord we do not stand here Lord or sat or
[1:35:03] gather here
[1:35:06] with the profession Lord or a thought
[1:35:09] that we in ourselves
[1:35:12] are perfect we know we know better Lord
[1:35:14] we know that God that it's you
[1:35:17] that is our perfection

[1:42:35] I tell you it's so precious we have
[1:42:37] ground to stand on
[1:42:40] we can draw from he's our source of
[1:42:42] strength I couldn't get into all that
[1:42:44] tonight
[1:42:45] but he's the place to draw
[1:42:49] don't make anything else
[1:42:52] your place of strength
[1:42:54] because it's not a place of strength
[1:42:57] he's the only one
[1:43:00] that is our strength
[1:43:02] he's our source of life
[1:43:04] he's our encouragement and you know
[1:43:07] that when situations and things come
[1:43:09] around sometimes we can have this report
[1:43:11] and other things can come around because
[1:43:14] brother mom just put it so clear and we
[1:43:16] see it
[1:43:18] and it encourages us when we I don't
[1:43:20] know if it does I believe it does for
[1:43:22] you too but when I read my brother Brian
[1:43:23] will say that we're not immune from
[1:43:25] those things
[1:43:27] we see how things come but I'm so glad
[1:43:30] that we have a source we can go to
[1:43:34] we have a place we can draw strength
[1:43:37] when different things comes our way
[1:43:41] he is our source of strength
[1:43:43] and I'm glad we can go to him
[1:43:47] that's why we don't look we don't look
[1:43:48] around because a lot of times we don't
[1:43:50] even know we don't even know what this
[1:43:52] one's going through or this one
[1:43:53] sometimes we know but in everything we
[1:43:56] know
[1:43:57] that brother Brown tells us
[1:43:59] actually was brother Neville
[1:44:01] and five identifications of the Church
[1:44:03] of the Living God but the never made a
[1:44:05] statement he said God In Prayer God
[1:44:07] those who are going through the most
[1:44:09] bitterest of Trials right now may we go
[1:44:13] to them in love and encourage them
[1:44:16] knowing that we also at some time we'll
[1:44:20] go through a bitter trial
[1:44:22] not because we'll go through a bit of
[1:44:24] trouble recognizing that there is
[1:44:26] strength that comes from the Lord and
[1:44:27] there's strength in the body
[1:44:29] there's encouragement in the body
[1:44:32] it's him
[1:44:34] it's him
[1:44:36] and when he comes that way
[1:44:39] we want to receive it
[1:44:41] Brother Carlos calls me up on the phones
[1:44:44] brother Samuel
[1:44:45] keep pressing brother
[1:44:47] now what if I said to Brother Carlos
[1:44:48] it's easy for you you ain't never been
[1:44:51] through this
[1:44:54] and Brother Carlos may have to Humble me
[1:44:56] a little bit and say no I have been
[1:44:58] through some of those things
[1:45:01] sometimes you see you say brother Simon
[1:45:04] what is it let's be simple enough to
[1:45:06] accept
[1:45:10] what God as God would send encouragement
[1:45:12] our way because whether we've been
[1:45:14] through it or not
[1:45:16] is God giving encouragement to his
[1:45:18] people
[1:45:19] I'm glad he's that kind of God aren't
[1:45:21] you
[1:45:22] he's our strength brother Samuel how
[1:45:24] does he do it I don't know I can't
[1:45:25] explain it but I know he gives us
[1:45:27] strength job said it like this he puts
[1:45:30] strength in US
[1:45:33] I don't know how he does it but I know
[1:45:35] he doesn't
[1:45:36] and I know he's my strength Giver
[1:45:40] and we can just draw from him
[1:45:43] let's sing this once again his strength
[1:45:47] is perfect
