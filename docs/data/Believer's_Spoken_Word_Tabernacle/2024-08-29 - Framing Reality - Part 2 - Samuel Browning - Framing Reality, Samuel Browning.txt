praise the Lord my soul [Music] [Applause] [Music] hallu don't you love the Lord amen he's certainly worthy of all of our praise amen amen uh I was thinking uh I was thinking what brother brandham read read some time ago and he says um he said you wonder what it what makes those people act that way he said there must be something that comes down that excites that nerve and he said it's the spirit of God that comes down that excites that nerve when you get to thinking about what he's done for you where he's brought you from you know brother Bram will go on to say in another place he said we don't build upon emotion he said but when God's done something for you it'll follow according to how we're made up right according to how we're made up amen how we're made up but I'll tell you what God is so good isn't he he he's so good he's so worthy all of our praise amen so good to be together tonight in his presence and so we just want to just approach the word of the Lord tonight and just ask the Lord just to come and speak to our hearts that's what that's what we need we we need to hear from him tonight we have needs in our Liv lives and God is certainly mindful of that so let's just let's just approach the throne of God here this evening together Heavenly Father how we so thank you Lord for your mercies once again Lord Jesus what a privilege it is Lord that that we have to serve you Lord oh God it's not not something that we have to do but Lord It's the very desire from our hearts Lord You're The One Lord you made a way that that desire could be expressed thank you Jesus and through that way that was made Lord for us as we have by Your Grace been LED and brought into that way you're the same one Lord that makes a way that that desire oh God it's the very thing Lord in our lives that directs us moment after moment with one desire to please you Lord as David said this is our confidence this one thing have I desired and I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold his Beauty and to inquire at his Temple Lord Jesus this is this is our desire Lord You're Everything To Us Lord you are all in all now Lord as we these moments have been set aside Lord and all the sacrifice and all that is went in Lord for us to be here it certainly Lord is nothing comparable to the sacrifice that you have made for us but tonight Lord we ask that you would give us strength Lord God even to be able to step aside for a few moments Lord from the cares of life and the tiredness and weariness Lord that maybe Lord that would be around us we ask that God that you would just come in a special way now and speak to our hearts Lord I pray heavenly father if there's anything Lord that we have said or done Lord we ask that you would forgive us Lord we pray Lord God May the word of God just move in Upon Us in a special way change us Lord I pray May our hearts be changed May our minds Lord our thoughts oh God every bit of us Lord I pray help us Lord tonight we love you and we thank you Lord we commit this service and all that would be said or done Lord to your glory now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen I'm going to ask you if you would to turn with me to two places of scripture tonight and uh Proverbs chapter 16 and verse 32 you have to forgive us we um the program we use the I told you before brother Brian created all that for us that where I can submit my notes and you know how things go with technology and uh just let us know that the certificate I don't understand all that but anyway how brother Brian always has to go back and rework that on that program that he's created so um I think it'll be all right we can just follow in a few places here in the scripture in Proverbs 16:32 the scripture says he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city so think about that it's one thing for a person to take a city to conquer it but it's another thing to rule it and this is where Solomon is writing this by inspiration you know it's like this once ground has been taken you see this in the Old Testament where Israel would take a take ground take land in the promised land but every bit of ground that they took they had to defend it so every promise that God gives us that Satan's never going to back back down as though he's not going to contest it we always have to stand there in defense and ruling over that in our lives so let's go to Proverbs 25:28 it's very much like like the scripture we just read it says he in Proverbs 2528 he that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down and Without Walls amen that we want to have rule over our own spirit amen and we know that it's what the Holy Spirit comes to equip us to do so that God comes to bring us to a place to where that remember how brother Bram would give that that um statement that was made over and over well brother Bram I can't help it you know the devil just made me do it brother Bram said no the devil didn't make you do it you just went out to him so the thing that we want to do is we definitely want to have those walls built up and God's given us the wall where we're to be fortified behind and that's the word of God that's our place that's our walls that's our strength that's our fortification amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd like to just continue to speak a little bit more tonight on this thought on framing reality framing reality and uh lot of things that can kind of Escape us and as we kind of looked a little bit last week and we took a certain approach last week and I um not going to go that same angle uh tonight but um really looking at where God has called us to um govern in our own lives and where that the Lord would would ask you and I and require of us really a lot of our Victory depends on of us living from the victory that God God has brought in our lives and then continuing to feed on the right things those are things that we realize that becomes our responsibility to the things that we would feed upon we eat upon we dwell upon we all know that that whatever you feed on or you dwell on will create an atmosphere around you and so these are things that comes down to it so important in our lives where God has entrusted us as a son or daughter of God and so when we look at that there's a lot of things that we can come in contact with my thought on framing reality that there's a lot of things that can present themselves to be real there's a lot of things of conclusions of things we've saw or heard where we've taken those things and drawn conclusions upon them and yet it was not true whatsoever the conclusions that we've drawn now there's a part of us that's made in that way God's made us in that way not that we would be defeated but we want to be under his control I think of how that the prophet over and over as I was just going back through and studying some different parts U just in addition to this and he's talking to different ones that would come across the platform and he would say you're a deep thinker and your whole problem throughout life has been your makeup now God's not going to change our makeup but he says this this is what's led to the conditions in your body the pep ulcer and all these different things and then he'll go through and he'll say quit quit studying so hard you always plan things out and it never happens according to how you're planning it on and on brother bam goes through this now now to me these things are very important this is where the spirit of God would would direct us and and then brother bam will come around in a few different places when he speaks of a deep thinker and he'll say I see you're a deep thinker you really take things to heart he said that's a that's a real good quality now you think of it that in one place to be a deep thinker and to cross Bridges and to plan is that that's a very negative thing can be a very negative thing I mean it's not wrong to be a planner but how many of us have planned things out and it didn't happen anywhere close to the way we had it planned out May maybe thought something was going to happen in a certain way you sat down in a meeting with your boss and man you've it's kept you up all night and you're thinking why is he wanting to meet with me at this time and and here you are you've got all of this formulated that he's going to say this this is going to be my defense and this and then when you get in the office it's nothing like that whatsoever and you're almost at a place you're like man I'm glad that it wasn't that way but do weot oftentimes learn our lessons no when pressures come and nervousness and and sometimes the weary and pressures of life and Satan knows how to come at us like we were looking at last week to try to get us in that place and we'll get so caught up in that but yet knowing that there is a place that God brings you and I to that we that we can live with a real Dominion in our life to where that when the prophet could say in one place about a deep thinker quit planning things quit Building Bridges quit thinking that way quit trying to figure out how God's going to heal you just know that he died for your healing and then on another place you can say wow what a wonderful quality to have you take things to heart you're very sincere what's the difference it's where it comes down to when God is the one who's controlling in our lives see God doesn't come down like we looked at sister Bruce last week and all of those things that God brought out and this is how you're made up Sister Bruce and you get somebody on your heart God puts somebody on your heart to pray for him and you can't you can't stop until you do it well Satan sees that same property and he'll just keep adding things and adding things till eventually you're questioning your own experience you're questioning of where you are where do you stand with God and he can all of those things now the thing that the Holy Spirit never did he never came down and told sister Bruce I'm going to change your makeup your temperament how you're made up but what God comes down to do I'm so glad that he uncovers in that way uncovers that so that you and I can stand there with a real understanding in our life with the Dominion of knowing how that we're made up and that none of those other things no matter even how real that seems God on the scene and we understand then what really is reality there's a lot of things like I said when we could sit in that boss's office that wasn't reality what was end up being said was but we can put all those things together and you know there's things that God will work and he'll operate through that but notice in Nehemiah chapter 2 and I want to just read two vers of scripture Nehemiah 2 and verse 17 and this is when Israel has come back into the land uh from which uh God has brought them out of Babylon remember they came in two different groups first it was Ezra that was uh that that came um he comes Ezra comes after there's a group that comes then Ezra comes and then Nehemiah comes and the first group that comes remember they're stirred up and and they establish the Altar and then remember after the enemy battling them battling them for 15 years they lost sight of the purpose that God had brought him back in the land and remember how the enemy attacked him it railed on them with words and the Bible said to frustrate the purpose in other words break the purpose and so as the enemy kept coming with those accusations then we see how God turns that around and then they move back into the purpose and that was to bring back or to erect the Temple of the Living God now before it can ever the temple can ever be erected it has to first start with an altar that's the same way it is in our life our our life our heart must become an altar a place of sacrifice a place of surrender in order for God to build his own his own dwelling place within us and so we we see that when that Temple was built yet the walls of Jerusalem were still torn down the gates were in a mess and you see it just goes to show God doesn't build you and I from the outside in he builds Us From the Inside Out healing does not take place from the outside in it takes place from the inside out and that includes physical healing spiritual healing emotional healing it starts from the inside and works to the outside so when we recognize that has Nehemiah comes back and he comes back with a burden that God has put a burden on his heart it's the time for this to be done it's a time for it to be taken care of and that's the same way that God works with you and I in our lives if God let you and I know when he first got a hold of our life of everything that he was going to accomplish and work out and all of the molding of character in our life through tests and trials and showed us the expanse of that it would overwhelm us at the work that was going to take place in our life we would say how will how will that ever be but you see what God does he doesn't busy himself with letting you and I know all of the A to Z he just brings us to the reality you are my child you've always been my son you've always been my daughter and the spirit of God calls you into that place of submission and makes it real to you and then it's you and I surrendering and submitting to his leading on and on and on to one of these days the final moment of surrender will be the change of the body so notice how that when Nehemiah comes back here he he comes under that burden and God places a burden on his heart to go back to Jerusalem because the walls are are torn down now he says in verse 17 and he goes out to survey it he says you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lith waste and the gates thereof are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more a reproach then I told told them of the hand of my God which was up good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work now I I'm going to ask you what was it that caused them to strengthen their hands it was not their Earthly strength when you trace back down to the scriptures the Bible would even say for those Who Rose up to build the Temple of the Lord after being silent for 15 years the Bible says they strengthen their hands to do the work of the Lord and it says the prophets were with them helping them how were the prophets helping them they were speaking to them the word of God their purpose was what was being sat before them and that's where God wants to continually set before you and I is what our purpose is and yet Satan always wants to get us caught down here to looking at things just in the Earthly this Earth and all of the things with it is not my purpose it's not your purpose our purpose is to serve God by his Spirit through his word that's our purpose and then through that it sets everything else in the Earth or allows us to set everything else in its proper order so this where it comes down where all of this is taking place with Nehemiah I want you to notice that as as we were saying the altar was raised first then the temple it was dedicated then Nehemiah returns as we've read and he builds up the walls and Gates and nehemiah's title is a governor that's what he's entitled as he's not a prophet he's not a priest he comes and he is brought into a position as Governor now let me say this to you the scripture tells us that when we have been quickened by the spirit of God it raises up what God has ordained us to be we are Kings and Priests unto our God but there's always that discernment on when do I stand as a priest and when do I operate as a king when do I move as a priest when do I move as a governor when do I operate in those channels and yet we know that it's always of a priest it's always sacrifices unto the Lord It's praying for one another it's you know lifting one another up in prayer it's worshiping the Lord through everything we do our whole life is to be a worship is to be a sweet smelling Savor to him and as a king or a ruler as a governor we have been entrusted that the sin that once ruled us we now rule it we've been entrusted with with this responsibility and let me just say this to you God has not handed you and I a task that is too big for you and I as a son and daughter of God it's too big for you or I in the natural as far as just in our being but remember we're not fighting a flesh and blood Warfare this is a spiritual warfare against spiritual wickedness evil spirits in high places so it's got to be something greater and that is Christ Christ himself veiled in Sons and Daughters of God when we're no longer led by our thoughts and our thinking because look let's just be honest it's our thinking that has got us into trouble it was man surrendering their thinking that led to the fall in the beginning so we need his leadership so brother brand speaks of this in the message the Messiah and speaks of how that within this he's talking about when a person is born again he says the light that comes into him is about like this little white button on my shirt so you got a button on your shirt you can look at it that's about the size of the light as it comes into the man comes into into the inner part of man brother BR says a man is made up in the system of Tabernacles I want you Brianna will you switch over here to that let me just display these I want to just I want to just do this very briefly this my my objective within this T tonight just as this has come and as I I know we may have the connection but I want you to just to be as though we haven't uh maybe heard it but yet just to set it forth in that way that this is when God had them make the Tabernacle in the wilderness God had Moses make this after what he saw in heaven and it was Moses who was caught up in the cloud re in that vision and then communicated what he saw in that vision and and this this is it was speaking of God's dwelling place but it was speaking of something that God was Desiring ing to do God's desire was to dwell in man he walked in man in the beginning they had that Perfect Image in them in the Garden of Eden they were separated from that through the fall so now God this Tabernacle it was also speaking not only of you and I but then how that God himself would come down and pay the price of redemption in order to bring himself back into man and man back into the economy of God he's the one he's the way and so now with this Tabernacle there's there's three courts to it we have the outer Court I let me see if I get this going here we have the outer court right here this is this would be your flesh your body see all of this here is all part of that there's an altar there right then we have here the the the inner court or the holy place and I'll show a cross-section in a minute that's your spirit here you have five pillars right we have five inlets of the spirit conscience memory reason affection all of those are there and then in the holiest of holies back here that's the soul so we have Body Spirit soul now God's desire remember it was his life that light that came down and actually gave the full direction for this it was his light coming down the shikina light that came down and settled upon the mercy seat and that's what the holy spirit is in the new birth to a Believer it's not a light like what can be in the Holy place where it can be blown out let me just show this here see this is now looking down upon that if this is okay everybody okay with this okay so once again here's that outer Court we're looking down on it now this is the first altar altar of incense and then the the mercc in here was the seven golden candlesticks those are opening to show the way but remember this in here could be blown out and would have to be relit there's times your spirit and my spirit where it's been blown out but what's important is is to have God's light the shikina light because it can never be blown out once once once God has sealed a man he's sealed right it can be things in here that we can permit sometimes sometimes through pressures of life or circumstances of Life grief or whatever can be so overwhelming but yet the same God who is here to like this is the same God that gives you and I the strength and the direction from where this was lit it's lit from this same fire that comes down from God you know man didn't Kindle that fire on out there in the Brazen altar God's brought that fire down and then from that fire it was transferred in here it was showing the same fire that came down in Jesus Christ is the same fire that was poured out on the day of Pentecost amen if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal body The Works that I do shall you do also so it's the same fire now this is where that the Holy Spirit calling to us that even when there's times of things that's come here very deep or very great or weariness like we looked at last week and all of those things but there's still the fire of God that can move down and this can be relit Hallelujah remember David never lost his salvation right he lost the joy of it is that right he said restore to me the joy of thy salvation amen right so now we're seeing that of how that even in that now this might be a little blurry but I want you just to focus on this it comes down to this point here that this is exactly here we are and here he we have the body the outer we have the spirit that's tied tied to the mind and then you have the soul all of these things are true the body five senses see hear taste feel smell sometimes those things through those five senses on the natural uh you know you can maybe smell something or hear something and then we take it in and we draw a conclusion right and you've drawn a conclusion maybe of what your wife has cooked for dinner and you get in there and realize that's not the con conclusion that I had drawn you got a choice you get an attitude I mean or be disappointed about it and say hey can we change the menu but it's you or I that's drawn that conclusion right we got to be careful how we use those senses same thing in here then see that where did that come from well things we were smelling and we were seeing and so forth then we can come into the spirit and this in the spirit realm which is attached there to the mind that's imagination conscience affection reasoning memory so many deep things within this right here because how even God comes down into the Soul by his spirit and and brings a complete change to our nature and then from here remember brother brah says go down to the inside and get the inside cleared out remember how brother Bram says that in greatest B fought over and over he'll speak of that because then when we're coming from the inside out that's who we really are that's the one who's been put in charge that's a Son of God that's come under the authority that God intended for him to have then we can begin to approach out here in the spirit cuz sometimes even out in the spirit even here let's say in the conscience sometimes we've had the wrong thinking about things we've had scriptures we've had quotes and we've had it in such a way as conscience it's formed it over and we've had it in such a way that if we don't do do this oh Lord I'm not I'm not Victorious Lord I'm I'm not and you know what it had nothing to do with Satan defeating us it's because there's something that's there in our conscience but you know what you or I would not even know where to go or how do I go within this because your conscience is shaped by the teaching you're under and so God will come down and by his word you see God doesn't say stop thinking that but God comes down by his word listen to me everything he does is by his word Am So What comes forth is the product of himself that he's seeing our his through every facet of our life this is why that when you go back here and you look even in the Tabernacle every one of these colors there is even in the veil back here it's the same colors as where is right here in the hanging and what's on the gate the same color so it shows it becomes CR through every facet of our life that's what God's desire is to do is and from our soul it comes out into our spirit and then into our flesh I'll tell you when he got a hold of me maybe I can't speak for anybody else he had his work cut out for him but you know what he didn't look at all that he only he had confidence in in his word he had confidence in that part of himself that who you and I really are that that would continue to submit and to yield because the new birth does not bring us automatically into the conformed image of Christ the new birth brings us to the place to where now we have received his life in US it has birthed us into the kingdom now we become as children that are conformed to His Image amen transformed amen you love him so let me just refer to I'll leave this up there is that all right I'm just going to refer to the places here of the message of the Messiah remember BR said when that light has come in there it's about the size of a button and he says and you know the only way he said that God can get in there he says now watch this God will not even push your on you or I ain't that tremendous he RS you and I right he don't he don't God God let me just tell you something God has never been about the business of trying to scare you or I the only thing that becomes fearful is we is if when thing when we recognize or could see in our life hey I'm not where I need to be with God but God never even brings that to scare us into him it just becomes the alert of where is my soul is it in him or outside right right we know how that we need the Holy Spirit just standing there always at the door of Mercy brother BR says when God comes into the man into the heart he said when a man is converted it's just like a little white button that starts in his heart now watch this if he can let that Spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness and press God's way through him again he can come back in the same condition that he was when he was in the Garden of Eden and he refers to mark 11:24 if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you have said will come to pass you can have what you've said that puts man right back Supreme again it puts him right back in the condition why because your words have have become God's words God's words have become your words because as God as our life is yielded it dismantles all all of the roots of bitterness now friends I think we're here to be honest tonight as we come to the presence of God we we are looking to the Lord that God in every facet of my life I want to please you that's the desire that we have I want the Holy Spirit to search me out I want to be I want to be searched out right now and you know even within that we you know always want to be careful and I just kind of put this as a footnote because in with all of us we want to open ourselves to that place to say Lord search me out and you know sometimes the enemy can get on that and almost drag people clar out here and into where they's looking at where they're doubting their own experience or not but just need to open to the Lord and say Lord I close my mind to my thoughts I'm open to your thoughts because it's your thoughts the word is what has life in it and so if your if your word comes and my thoughts are wrong I lay aside my thoughts if your word comes and my thoughts are correct then I take it because it's your word but outside of that it's your word we are setting at the Judgment seat where the word of God is going forth to bring judgment in our lives I want judgment right now I want judgment in my heart right now I want Judgment of my thoughts and my intentions I want it right now I don't want to stand there on that day before the white Throne judgment and say I'm here because I neglected the Judgment of the word but I want to take the Judgment of the word where there is a blood that is speaking better things thank you Jesus Hallelujah I want to say God grow in me Lord root out all roots of bitterness and all the roots and things through my life that maybe I'm not even aware of of complexes that could be so deep that maybe from childhood or things that's been accumulated over the time you might say why didn't God take care of that first remember he heals from the inside out there's things he brings you an i to at certain times just like he gave the burden to them to return at that time under Cyrus then the burden came for Ezra to return then the burden came for Nehemiah God gives a burden Upon Our Hearts of when it's time Hallelujah now brother BR refers to this and he says we're made up of light meters we have that we tell we have x-rays you know those x-rays they capture light from our bodies and I know we have to you know anymore it's almost like they want to extract every bit from you in an x-ray in an x-ray um and they're only doing their you know what they think is right to do but it recognize it comes from our own light the prophet lays that out and he says then if that Cosmic light this Cosmic light in our bodies could be pushed to a place to where it's not Cosmic light but Eternal Light God could dwell supremely to do our thinking do our walking do our talking then it's no longer the man it's God and the man now I don't know about you there's times on those x-rays they can show things that are not a good report is that right there's times you could see things that says this is what it is the light meters put it off this is what's in the body maybe a growth maybe a broken bone something that's abnormal right and then afterwards they take an exray and it's gone how many have we seen healing of cancer now let me ask you what was it that stepped in and changed what the machine caught it was shakina light that came down and gave order to this Cosmic light a before and after picture let me ask you what is it that came into your life your life my life we were sometimes Darkness there was a before picture we were we were walking underneath the principality of air we could not get to a place of overcoming but then God's light came and when his light came it changes the story there's a before and an after well this is what I was but this is what I am and what I am was hidden there the whole time what made the difference Shina light came in God's light God's presence God's word let there be [Applause] hallah then it's God dwelling supremely I like how brother bam goes on to say it he says now he's got light eternal life is the light of God that dwells in the man this is key if he will yield to the spirit more he becomes the more he becomes unman Sinner likee and becomes more Godlike the more he can yield to the Spirit the more he becomes unman sinner like and more Godlike well what must I do yield because remember that light it'll press its way through as we yield to the spirit of God God drops a burden upon our heart and there's things to be attended to in our life like brother brand I thinking when he's standing on the platform in one of those quotes on the deep thinker he said sir he says you've you've been a deep thinker always planning things and Crossing Bridges just before you ever get to it he said that's this is what led you to the place he said where you're at right now he said now you've had people tell you just get beside yourself and stop thinking that way and and don't do that no more he said but this time it's different Hallelujah his time it's different he said because he's here and he's the one that is saying stop thinking that way and he said you're going off of here a well man you see what a difference Just In God's Presence you do you understand that's why Satan fights even when we're coming to the house of God and even when we get here the battle doesn't end when we get here Satan is battling because just a moment in his presence can change a situation it can change an Outlook what is it it's his light his presence his word coming forth Hallelujah oh God that's what I want to yield I want to yield Amen to his presence you were sometimes Darkness but now are you light in the world we just weren't in darkness we were Darkness right that's what we were we were Darkness void of light void of what God had intended for you and I to be but then he came and sought us out he knew what was over our life when the word spoke like it did in Genesis 1 do you know Genesis 1 is a story of redemption of our own life it's the word that came by and spoke to the atmospheres that was over our life a spirit of unbelief a spirit that wants to keep us in bondage but the word spoke and said let there be light it wasn't speaking to the Earth he was addressing the atmosphere and that's what the Holy Spirit comes to do for a soul that is Desiring to serve God the spirit of God will come down and the word will Cast Away that spirit that that man or that daughter can be saved oh my there's nothing as great as the power of the spoken word hallelujah oh my that we might prove what is that acceptable acceptable way of the lord I want you to look at this here I don't know if this one will yeah I really like this one same thing remember Body Spirit Soul these are all these influences I'm sure we can't maybe we can't relate to that contentions malice Pride lust Envy no notice trying trying to trying to move in Satan doesn't take his hands off and say Desiring to serve the Lord and God's done a work in their life no remember you wasn't in a battle before that's right you're in a battle now true but but the prophet said but remember you've got greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world Amen that's why the importance of it we'll get to this in a little bit it's always important to Live From the Inside Out don't live from the outside in Satan listen Satan makes suggestions from the outside in but God will always come with his word from the inside out the prophet said it just like this he said I want you to think of these things going around there Fame honor want trials stress sure we B says the devil and greatest B ever fought he'll try to come right back if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed right then you you know what it means for an army to be routed they are running in disarray that way that now they can just start picking them off singling them out picking them off here picking them off there picking them off there you know it was Joshua under the under the guidance of the Lord that came against uh uh the enemy in the land and remember that all of a sudden the sun started to go down and Joshua said Son you stand still why did he say that he didn't even take a thought did he have ability he was standing on the word and he knew what the word had called for him to do that when a battle starts don't you stop don't you let up one iota I don't care if it seems like darkness is coming in no matter what kind of pressure Comes Your Way speak to that storm son stand still Satan get back out of here and the Bible said they routed the enemy the enemy was just running in disarray there wasn't no order to them that's what Satan wants to try to do is break the order in our life that's why brother branam makes a simple statement he says all of your senses he said these right here see smell hear taste and feel he said don't believe them if they're not according to the word that's right well I heard so and so say this you might have heard so and so say that and they might have been exactly wrong but but your hearing right here it still doesn't line up with the word of God you say Lord I'm not going to allow that to enter into my spirit where I hold something against what somebody said or I heard them say I refuse to do I refuse to make one of the altars a place that other things are received outside of the blood is that right there's three altars the body the spirit and the Soul right and each the way all of them are to be let me go back here the way that they are remember are reconciled it's the atonement the atonement the one day of atonement that's speaking of the blood of Christ that blood was to unite here and come upon this Altar and here upon The Mercy Seat it brings it's an atonement at one M it brings a uniting together for one purpose now watch this is what I'm saying that when we look at this it always our altar we don't want to have anything on our altar but the blood of Jesus Christ you said brother Samuel what do you say if there's a thought against my brother against my sister anything that hinders me from looking at Christ in death I forsake that because it must be the blood of Christ upon the altar because the blood of Jesus Christ is all about the harmony with the word hallelujah even if it's about your boss even if it's because we're not we're not given in any privilege to say anything is acceptable to be Holden in any situation is that right no notice this if your if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you blow a flu right quick you know it's like somebody going into the house and thinking man this got a nice wood burning stove got a nice one man you better check make sure that chimney is open better make sure it's been cleaned out cuz if not this Smoke's coming back down at you in the house right it it ain't going to work you got to make sure it's cleaned out out and that's the thing that the word of God does it comes to clean us out it comes to clean us out it comes to purge us there's nothing that can Purge like the word of God going forth in its Purity it is the washing of Water by the word he says we must he said or else you'll blow a flu right quick anything disagrees with the word get away from it anything with what's on the inside get rid of it oh I then brother BR said what do you got you got a solar system you got everything is cleaned out well what does a solar system all those Stars every Star has a name I I don't know all of them but God does right I I mean I can try to find constellations I I'm pretty good on the Big Dipper Little Dipper and outside of that I'm just taking your word for it I I can't I I've just never been that good at seeing them sometimes that phone app that we've had been very nice where you can hold it up there and see that but you know job spoke of those constellations Micah spoke of those constellations is that right because God wrote his first Bible in the heavens right even God testified of the seven Church ages and all those things that are there but notice so God desires that a solar system everything would stand with the real clearness within it that everything is expressing his handiwork that's God's desire even to we he says the devil can't poke a doubt in there nowhere he can come around and say you don't feel any better but your conscience has even gone to that the flu is so clear it shouts Hallelujah the outlet blows a whistle glory to God it shines out just as clean and clear for the word of God to work through the power of God that's the main thing and Satan knows that as well remember he came and he worked in the beginning and begin to work through what Eve was seeing here and it entered there into her mind he dismantled that gate of reasoning which is a gate of judgment he dismantled that to say yay has God really said he's he's diminishing the word through reasoning see anything that diminishes the word that's not God God's word is always it's exalted and when it's exalted it exalts you with it because you're part of the word right it exalts the word of God in your life it exalt your life is surrendering to it it's being exalted but you see then he came in from reasoning and then it went over to imagination and all this began to go in her mind and all of those things and then the fall came all because one let down and let that come back in I I tell you we've got we have a responsibility before us can you say Amen oh God we've got a responsibility listen friends mind battles you're never going to get away from mind battles you you have them but I want you to remember remember you're not at Oddball for having mind battles right there's provision that's been made you you just got to come back down and know the ground of where you're standing and you stand there right against the enemy and and stand there at all times and and making sure Lord let everything be cleared out and and cleaned out in my life Lord everything don't don't hold anything you see because if you hold something it can become a Haven remember the Bible said pulling down strongholds it said give no place to the devil strongholds is a place where there's a stronghold not in the soul in the spirit no place to the devil in the book of Ephesians that place means a retreat a castle a a powerful place where Satan can act from don't give him any of those places it's like you know how it is and you know you tell your kids and things in the house hey hey hey hey I mean it's like what we have we have the dog food out in the garage hey hey man I I you know if I walk out there and I find a piece of dog I don't want that they got to you got to be careful what you're doing why because I don't want other things in this house right right I don't want other things in this house we've already had to you know you have to deal with something like that that comes in the in the garage of mouse or what I don't want nothing that close to my house so what it is I'm leave I'm not going to leave things down that would attract it and that's the same thing in our lives is Lord you may not know I may not see it may not even be known to us right now but Lord if there's anything in me that's an attracted for the wrong thing that's causing things to get hung up Lord show it to me Lord that my life all of that can be so cleaned out to where the enemy doesn't have anything that's a hold that he can start building on this is where the scripture says in Genesis 6 and I want you to go look at this scripture here with me just a minute this is God looking upon man when the time of Noah and this time of Destruction was coming and God saw that the wickedness of man was very great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his Hearts was only evil continually and I want you to notice that imagination of the thoughts the thoughts had come in but imagination is where framework begins to put those thoughts together this is and begins to just move into a place where it's not just a thought but then the Mind begins to go and frame these purposes together think of this before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain in the mind of God Amen in job 42 job was taken back and and and when looking at his circumstance he says where were you when I laid the foundations of this when the morning Stars shouted for Joy right where were you see it takes him back it was in God's mind but listen God in his mind it wasn't God's imagination but it was God's word it was faith and see this is where that Satan would like to try to trap in the imagination and God works by faith faith creates a vision that is contrary to even what imagination or reasoning or conscience or anything else could say but Faith makes way Faith itself is more real because an imagination is not real there's a difference amen right there's a big difference so now this imagination this word imagination means a framing of a purpose or a framework it's an imagination it's a a devising so it's it's putting and Gathering these thoughts together and putting them together and this is why when brother Bram is talking about those altars within within man and within the courts you have those altars and he says in this in this here in the Holy place he said think about in your life with those memories conscience uh and and reasons and and Imagination let me just stop here for a moment uh give me back to this to my slide please so so when you look at this here how many of you have good memories of loved ones it's in the gate of memory God has that in the vault but there can also be other memories in there right there can be memories in there that you see this is why everything not only we want everything under the blood but there's also things that we can have remembrances of of this or of that and and this one said this or this and then we can hold that and it becomes a hindrance it becomes a hindrance not not to the other person to what God wants to do in our lives you see listen God the blood of Jesus Christ will not do away with the memory but it'll take the sting out of it it'll take the effect out of it from controlling Our Lives to where one time you might not be able to look at this person but when the blood has come in there when the blood has been invited in there we no longer look at an individual or person with disdain but we recognize that we are all standing on the same plane in need of God's grace and we're not standing there in our memory and you know how Satan would like to bring things up things can Flash just in a moment's notice am right this is why we need the help of the Lord in our lives B says you just don't sit down and imagine these things what are you doing he said you don't do it in your flesh your senses don't imagine it's an inner court inside of you that begins to imagine so God God gave us those five Earthly senses as we said to contact see smell see smell hear those that's the contact this home right and then those spiritual senses they they have their part in an aid in our life but but never are any of these senses ever given to be the Principal guiding Factor amen sometimes we've heard something I'm just you giv examples you could hear something man think we got it all put together and you go run and say I heard this and this and this and what you heard was not this and this and this what we heard was what as we perceived and then it was put together by our imagination see this is oh oh Lord how this is how we always need we need his leadership you know there's so many directions and instructions of you know like the Bible says be swift to hear slow to speak is that right it speaks to us in these ways those are not just well those are Elementary things those are Sunday school things no those are things that pertain to us as children of God that that Christ might there might be an advancement in our life not of us but of him so this is where you know before anything I this is where we need to take it I I think of how brother Trevor said that when he was here a few years ago and he preached that wonderful message you know on and prayer and God's desire for communion I love what he said there on that midweek service he says if Eve would have just stopped when everything you're the reasoning sounds okay sounds like it might be all right even it within my imagination of my you know how wonderful would be but but but but let's talk to my husband let's talk to him wait till he gets home and let's see what he has to say about it if he would have just waited till then there wouldn't have been no fall right Hallelujah this is where you and I fail many times is because we don't bring it to the Lord in prayer we can go up on our reasonings go up our feelings and our imagin well I I just know it has to be this way and it's not God's leading that's why the prophet said many times he said we have Impressions instead of divine leadings and there's a big difference is that right so we know that this here these are things listen friends these are always things we want to we want to always in our life we never get too big that God let everything be examined by you Lord want everything in harmony with his word now I want you to think of this in this Spirit realm right here this Spirit realm right here this is a high maintenance area I mean this area you got to keep it fed you know please take a bath all those other things you know keep it dressed the right way but this this is a high maintenance area right the Bible said that the spirit of man is as a candle and a candle can be blown out it can get weary you see in this place right here let me go back here in this place right here this is where I'm talking about that Spirit you see right there the wind can come in this maintenance daily in the morning they had to trim the Wicks on that lamp otherwise it smokes up they had to also fill it with oil they also and not only within the feeling then on the Sabbath day the priest took the showbread they ate what had laid before the before God and then replaced it with showbread you know what all of this speaks of the showbread itself it speaks of when we look at these things that our lives would be unclouded the showbread itself is that our purpose is constantly for us and our lives are constantly given to a spirit of Revival Hallelujah that's why the prophet said stay in the spirit of Revival he said we must it's a constant refilling it's a refilling of the spirit of God but when there's a refilling it also brings a cleansing it brings healing in our spirit it's when we don't have a refilling is where we get brittle we get sticky we get contener we start leaning more into that rail that's a sign we need a fresh refilling oh God help us not to wait till those signs are there but every day Lord It's a time for a fresh refilling amen a time to give myself to the word the showbread is set before me it's that which is looking into the purpose that God has for my life let me finish with this quote here tonight questions and answers part four brother brandham has asked a question regarding Romans 7: 14-8 and he's asked the question help me to understand this we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I I would do I do not for what I would that I I would not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not I consent to the law that it's good now then it is no more I that doeth it but sin that dwelleth in me brother BR said let me polish this up for you a little bit see that's what a prophet comes to do he's a Divine interpreter of the word let me polish it up for you in me is two persons one wants to do right and the other wants me to do wrong every time I start to do right wrong hinders me he says you are an outward man which is controlled by these uh senses you're an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith and this Faith disagrees with all of these outer senses and these outer senses they if they don't agree with faith he says as long as those senses agree with faith wonderful but when those senses disagree with faith leave it alone you know what that is that's the bird and you and I have come under the atonement for our soul so the desire by the Holy Ghost is that everything would be in agreeance listen we're not even happy with ourselves and in our life if we allow other things to come in you allow a thought to come in against somebody else you're not happy your your peace has been removed it's there in your soul but something has come to disturb that but you and I are the ones who are in control of that what we allow to come in he that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh it amen a city we don't even act the way that we should be AC we should be acting brotherly we should be acting sisterly even with the boss on our job that you might say he's so ungodly but he's a soul that's right he a soul that little woman who was uh uh that little Israelite daughter that was down there in non's house she had a testimony a testimony that when time came she could speak up and say I know where there's a prophet that can deal with this disease in your life she had a life a testimony that was lived that when time for God to utter through her it could be accepted you see our life the Bible said every gift make room for itself Our lives our testimony makes word for what comes here but you see if we don't we find ourselves when those things come we find ourselves avoiding dodging why is that why is that it's because something's registered in here and it's taken there's a Brokenness from the purpose that God has called us to do and if Satan can just get that he can just sit back and say I got it I got it you see everything it's truth all the way through I'm I'm I'm winding this down here let can I just finish this quote this is just some real instruction brother brah says these this is why we have all the troubles we have he said we're carnal and that part must perish but inside we're a spirit man that's a soul inside and that's faith in God's word I just want you to listen to this then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God Said see we bring it in subjection by faith then what does that look like brother Brandon what does that look like bringing my outside body in subjection by Faith by accepting what he said not trying to figure it out not trying to reason it out not trying to sort it out not passing it back through memory well I remember this and I not passing it through there but letting the word come down and clear it all out and accept what the word says by faith and it brings the body in subjection now let me display this everybody knows what this is right I'm still on the same quote I ain't finished the go yet I'm getting there I'm getting there everybody knows what these are right brother Aaron you know what these are don't you sometimes you got to pick these off for hunting clothes you've been in places sometimes you got to pick them off your dogs right burst and they hurt yes those things you just can't and a just like this right here you got to pick them off I prefer to have a glove so they don't stick in my fingers that's how bad they are but you know what this is this is our first nature sticky easy to get caught on things doesn't take hardly any effort it just gets stuck sometimes in our minds we can just get stuck sometimes in our spirit we could just get stuck on something you ever had mom or dad say hey hey hey you sound like a broken record you get stuck you get stuck on one thing we think Oh Glory to God I've forgiven I'm beyond that few days by all of a sudden the same event comes up years pass the same event comes up and it's told with the same feeling from when it originally happened see that's where I thank God that there's a there's a real place of forgiveness I thank God for that friends if not what kind of mess would I be in what kind of mess would you be in there's a place listen there's a place where no doctor can get to amen I'm not against I'm not against medicine I'm not against psychiatrist I'm not against psychologist but let me tell you something there's a place that they can't get to they can sit there have you lay on a couch and try to diagnose it but it'll never change you but there's a God that can not only reveal what the problem is but come down there with a cleansing power to separate and break the hold of that complex Upon Our Life That's The Mighty God that's the Lord Jesus that I introduce to you tonight Hallelujah because you can never pass through the blood of Jesus Christ and come out with a complex I'm glad he still frees and delivers aren't you I'm so glad of that we could just call brother brandom up if we could brother brandom are you thankful that God still delivers of complexes he could tell you just by listening to the services I'm grateful for God's grace that delivers from complexes BM said how can I take a cuab bur and make a grain of wheat out of it impossible but when the inside of that cucker that cuab been opened up been opened up and the Very life on the inside of it which is the Nature has been changed and replaced with wheat nature and then closed back up so what's on the inside of this cockabur you realize this cockoo right here it gets stuck on our clothes you know what that's for those prickers are to carry to other places so it can bloom so it just don't stay in one area of your life won't just stay in your life it'll go your family it could spread through the church it's meant to be a carrier but if the inside of that has been transmitted to wheat life when that dies it will not produce another cockabur it will come forth wheat because what is on the inside is what will come forth that's what the new birth does for you and I it takes away that Cucka nature on the inside and it's transmitted with wheat life and when this goes by the way of the Grave what's going to come up not a cucko bar but a [Applause] wheat brother BR said the life of that cuabo has been taken out but the nature of that cuabo is still sticky see on the outside it's it's still sticky I mean can even you know that stickiness could even make a question I wonder if he's really got wheat on the inside how do you why why do you think because it seems like he's kind of sticky seems like he gets stuck in certain things and and he feel remember God has all kinds in his kingdom right Prophet tells us things that ought to be he has some that are kind some that are fine some that are dogmatic some that are this he said but they're all in his kingdom right it just so happens we only like certain kinds of prickers right now I didn't say love I said like now watch this it will be until this new life has been fully developed out of the ground and raised up again that Cabell is still sticky it's got the nature on the inside of it of a wheat but as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live might as well say it'll bother others too cuz I'm sure my carnal sticky part has bothered my wife I'm sure it's probably bothered my wife don't you say it's bothered you either I'm close to you right now buddy right sometimes we getting a little sticky he's almost got a but the inside of you you're born again when you raised up you'll be in the likeness of Christ and all sin will be gone from you brother Ram jumps to the very end of this quote all that's within that answer to Romans 7 of polishing it up a chief an Indian chief had received the Holy Ghost and he said to that Chief how you getting along he said pretty good and pretty bad what do you mean well since me received the Holy Ghost watch what he says there's been two dogs in me one of them is a black dog and one's a white dog they argue all the time isn't that amazing you by the holy spirit in your life you are in God's rest but there's an arguing going on not with God's word but there's an arguing between those two dogs right I don't know maybe they're Chihuahua I don't know one of them a a black dog and one of them a white dog they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another the white dog wants me to do good and the black dog wants me to do bad well Chief which one wins the fight that depends on which one Chief feeds the most right he says I that's a good answer that just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God that's what does it I say Lord if there's one thing for sure I want one of them dogs to be as big as a Rottweiler but I don't want the black one it might look funny to have a white Rottweiler but I'll take I I I want something that's big but you know what's going to make it big is what we feed it but I want that other one that black dog I want that to be so small notice it's not going to be something I get rid of but it's what I feed and you know sometimes the feeding of the black dog is actually neglecting the white dog right right and this is where our strength comes from I know these are things these are very simple things the Lord but it frames reality that we're not helpless we're not hopeless when there's things that we feel like man I feel like I've been blindsided I'm going to say Lord help me to understand the battle like David Lord teach My Hands to War show me Lord how I'm to fight this battle how do I move within this place in my life CU God has not called you and I into this place that we would stand helpless and defeated with Christ in your life you're more than a match for the enemy when he told Gideon Gideon saw only Gideon saw only the impossibilities of himself Gideon saw only what he knew about himself up to that point but what God saw in Gideon is what he always knew was there and it only would take a moment in his presence and through encouragements that Gideon would receive the courage from God and he said you'll Smite him as one man you and God are the majority doesn't matter what everything else though a host should en Camp round about me in this one thing will I be confident and I think that's the thing where we stand here in this place tonight Lord be the center of my life be the center of my life I think as the spirit of God just moving down just to free us and like brother BR says in one place he said the same God that brought you here in this building building he said receive the word and let it penetrate into your life and let it free you that's why we come to the house of God is that the word of God I want the word to penetrate I want it I want to absorb but I want it to soak down if there's if there's anything that's unlike him I'm depending on him to uncover that now and when he does I I want to stand like like like it was when Moses said who's on the Lord's Side let him come and Stand By Me amen amen then that's when I Rise and say I'll stand on the side of the word God give us that kind of a Grace that no matter what our feelings no matter what it is remember what God's really trying to do is separate us from our Own Worst Enemy which is our self oh what victory what Liberty there is can you say Amen to that when there's things when the Holy Spirit things have been cleared out in our life man I tell you just it's liberating with the spirit of God as he comes down and so refreshing in his presence as the word would come down into our life and it frees us it equips us it strengthens us and it does for us what no one else can do you love him amen God bless you tonight amen let's just stand Hallelujah I tell tonight even as we just stand in his presence and right before we go to prayer and maybe as they play something a little softly we can just say Lord let every part of my life be reconciled to your will you just say tonight maybe in your life tonight you say Lord I want your life on The Mercy Seat of my life I want your life I want the blood Lord what was there I want that Lord to be applied I want to surrender my all and Lord that everything is it one with you maybe you've experienced disappointment my we we've all been through things and I I wouldn't even try to measure what I've been through to somebody else we we can't I could look at what God's brought me through and look at what the Lord's brought you through and I could just say my M mine's in no comparison every time I hear brother brandham or hear Paul the things that they went through I think my what do I have to complain about but you know through it all there's times where my spirit's been blown out my spirit's B weak where just not my soul because you can't blow that shakina out when that Seal's been there is still a desire Lord my desire is to please you to serve you but just seems like maybe disappointments grief other things can come our way and yet through that the holy spirit will teach us he'll he'll help us and he'll minister to us and he'll bring healing in our lives of things that might be so deep that we don't even know how to even articulate or to bring before him but just say Lord I want your word to penetrate every area of my life Lord like you laid the burden on the children of Israel to come out of Babylon Ezra to return at his time then Nehemiah Lord I want to rest in the burden that the word is leading me to Lord heavenly father Hall you know Lord Jesus as we stand here tonight the needs and desires that we would have on our hearts Lord we certainly are so thankful Lord for the the Redemption that has been brought to us Lord we're thankful father for the blood that's made away for the spirit of God that Lord would move down begin to draw us Lord through every area and come to that place Lord of rest in our soul which brings us into rest Lord to realize that through it we desire Lord that you would just so push your way Lord towar that these Cosmic light meters it's pushed to the place to where it's used supremely Lord to where that as we start out in our walk with you well Lord we're children and there's some things Lord that we think as a child we understand as a child in some ways Lord it'd be good for us to recall back to that place of just taking you at your word but sometimes Lord through the complexities of life through trials through tests through things that we've come into lord it's never been you but Lord God the whereare that Lord in areas of our life to where that sometimes Lord maybe we find where things are getting hung up Lord Jesus your desire is that your word would be able to flow freely through our lives now Lord I'm not trusting the X-ray machine of a man that could only show the Natural Things Lord but I'm trusting Lord in that great spiritual MRI that Lord as we come under the word like your Prophet spoke of entering into that little room Lord as we come under that of the word oh God I want the word to examine my life Lord examine my life Lord if there's anything that's that's unlike you that's displeasing to you things that Lord that you know that am Desiring in my life my brothers and sisters standing here is Lord I we stand with that same desire Lord I I don't want channels and things Lord that to stay there I don't want things to stay in a memory of haunt or reasoning or imagination oh God I pray Heavenly Father May the Holy Spirit Lord as we just open our hearts to you Lord to the word allowing the word of God to go down and penetrate Lord every area of our life life Lord Jesus there's no man can fix us there's no one Lord that can do for us what you can do Lord what I think of those examples of sister Bruce I think of the examples Lord of those different ones that I read about Lord known with that characteristic as a deep thinker and the things Lord that would so have an effect upon their lives but God you would come with healing virtue Lord to not only touch Lord those ulcer conditions not only to heal them Lord in their nerves Lord but oh God you would do for them what no other could do Lord you know we're not against medicine I'm not against that Lord but father I know that there is a greater medicine and this medicine lord of the Holy Spirit through the blood by the word it does not mask symptoms Lord hallah it deals with the problems Lord amen oh God help us Lord I pray help us lord it's nothing Lord that's hard it's some great thing that we have to do but it's simple obedience to the word of God accepting what you said Do Lord help us tonight every one of us Lord there's needs Lord throughout there's lives Lord that need Lord a a real deep Divine Touch Lord in their soul there's lives that need healing in the spirit Lord as well some Lord in need of healing in the body body oh God you've
