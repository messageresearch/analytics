about you it's all about YOU Jesus I'm sorry Lord for the leads I'm me when it's all about you it's all about YOU Jesus [Music] if it ever gets away from that then we're really missing while real true worship is you know to think of the grace of God that we could if you come to a place that God has given us and set aside to come in to worship Him and to hear from him and yet if that's where the worship begins and ceases that's still not the worship that he's looking for me God he never came that we would have a church life he's that that's not a true worship true worshipers go to church but a true worshiper worships him in spirit and in truth every day of our life is a warship unto God what we say and what we don't say the way that we conduct our lives it's worship unto God amen that's where it was so thankful for that he made a way to restore us back to a true worshipper Amen aren't you grateful for that Amen with all of my heart Lord I want to be a true worshiper amen you love the Lord this morning and it's so good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you here we want to just look into the word this morning and remind you or willing on Saturday we have some Paul it's graduation they're the heritage Presbyterian Church Saturday what time is that one o'clock well that's bad innit I don't have the calendar in front of me if y'all seen how my calendar looked right now you'd say well I no wonder so one one one o'clock the Lord willing next Saturday and we're very very thankful for that also this coming Tuesday night prayer meeting here Lord willing at 6:30 and amen we're just looking to the Lord just expecting great things amen well let's look in Ephesians chapter 5 this morning and we're just gonna read just just two verses of Scripture and if there's any visitors here if we've overlooked you god bless you you're welcome this morning amen if you haven't been here in a while and it looks like you're a visitor well we can change that amen god bless you this morning Ephesians chapter 5 and just two verses of Scripture and then we'll just let we'll just look to the Lord here verse 8 Ephesians 5 verse 8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light I want you to notice that scripture it didn't say we were in darkness it said we were darkness we were darkness but now are ye light in the Lord not just in the light but our light remember jesus said when he was here he said I as long as I am in the world his compound meaning as long as I'm in the world I am the light of the world and that same one that same Lord Jesus turns to you and I and announces in the book of Matthew says ye are the light of the world so there's in order to be the light there's got to be light come has to be light to come but now are you light in the Lord walk as children of light wherefore verse 14 just skip down to that one wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give the light notice verse 14 as it says wherefore he saith this is his word he speaks awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead and Christ shall give thee light let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer I'd like to just speak this morning on now are you liked in the Lord Heavenly Father Lord as we come here Lord together in this place that you have given to us Lord we know Lord as a church building Lord as we would gather together Lord just took come and to enter into your presence Lord we've not come here this morning for a good feeling we've not come here to just serve the Lord a weekly duty but we've come here this morning Lord to hear from you Lord we've got needs in our lives Lord there's things Lord that even that we would be contemplating deliberating looking into we want your leadership Lord we desire your guidance Lord and we pray Heavenly Father may there not be one heart and life that Lord is untouched by you but all gone may you be lifted up Lord and may you draw oh God every heart and every life to you Lord may you come Lord I pray in our midst this morning Lord O God as our hearts were just pulsating long within us Lord speak to me Lord Jesus Lord may we just Lord of reach out Lord in a welcoming spirit Lord God just welcomed you to speak to our hearts Lord for you alone have the words of eternal life Lord you're the one that can take Lord in a moment time we can walk Lord in here with such situations Lord and such trouble Lord Oh God and darkness but in just one moment's time Oh God Lord you move Lord on our behalf Oh God and Lord you give to us Lord of strength you give answer you remove oh god the yoke Lord and the burdens Oh God Oh father we just ask this morning Lord that you would come Holy Spirit and just take control Lord of the vessel Lord and the congregation this morning Lord all God may we speak Lord as the Living Oracles of God or father by the unction of the Holy Ghost may you take control this morning oh god lord i bind every unclean spirit Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Lord every demon spirit that would want to hinder Lord and seek to assert itself over the children of God Satan we call you a liar in the name of Jesus Christ you're nothing but a bluff and my Lord Jesus Christ has defeated you you're a liar and you must take your hands off of God's children so in the name of Jesus Christ we cast you from this building in the name of Jesus Christ for the glory of Almighty cause in Jesus precious name Amen amen god bless you as you're being seated this morning amen if you would turn with me also to the Book of Luke I want to just begin in there here this morning in the Book of Luke and just looking at this this part of what the Lord Jesus is is expressing to our hearts now we're talking we a couple weeks ago and we were dealing with this the light of God and true worshipers we realized that we're not talking about natural light yet natural light itself is a type it is a shadow the Sun itself that we're enjoying the light of today it is eight of the Son of God himself just as the moon is a type of the Church of the Living God where that the moon herself is to show forth a witness of the Son of God and his absence she has no light of her own she only reflects light and so when we're looking at this of the light of God the scripture tells us in the book of John chapter 1 that this light that we're speaking of is that light that lighteth every man it's the light that is also the life it's something that's greater than just our natural life because we we have life but yet Jesus as he spoke and here the coming of the Messiah he said I am come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly so it's something and I love that phrase in that scripture where more abundantly it means beyond what you can even imagine and so we recognize there's a greater life than what just a life that we have and you know even though as we walk within this life we can have many disappointments we can have many times of up and many times of down but yet when that life has come within us it gives to us within our hearts an expectation that goes beyond just the circumstances that we are in it's a strength it's a light it's his life that comes to guide and direct us in in in our lives through this life so here the Lord Jesus as is expressing this in Luke 11 verse 33 no man when he hath lighted a candle a candle can't light itself right nobody has a self-lighting candle but a candle is made to be lit I know we have sometimes we have candles around for decorations but the reality of when candle when I was growing up the electricity would go off the reason we had candles was not because of their smell it was tool item when the electricity went out that's why we have so that you could see your way around the house in the country so here we understand that a candle has a part about it that can be lit and here Jesus said no man when he hath lighted a candle because it takes the Lord Himself to light the candle in our life no man when he have lighted a candle put it in a secret place neither under a bushel but on a candlestick that they which come in may see the light so the focus when this candle has been lit it's placed on a candlestick that those who are entering might see the light so the focus is not on the candle but the candle is only that which is displaying that light that has come to it so now look how Jesus says this in verse 34 the light of the body is the eye and this is something that you know I would love to just preach on a little more here on verse 34 but you recognize it is very very it's very crucial on what we give our eyes to the light of the body is the eye therefore when thine eye is single thy whole body also is full of light but when thine eye is evil thy body also is full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness Maya what a contrast light in me but the light in me be darkness so Jesus is saying take heed that what light is there within you that it is not darkness now remember Satan he claimed to Eve in the beginning and Paul picks this up in 2nd Corinthians 11 Paul the Satan came to Eve and he came bringing what would seem of a greater light upon the Word of God but in actuality what Satan was doing was substituting or he was bringing darkness into the very life now if she did not have to go along with it remember it was by self-will deception you know the spirit of deception fell and then you find that then it became darkness yet leave herself believe what she had was light you see the light when it is the light of God within our lives I want you to listen to me closely when it is the light of God that is in our life and working through our lives it will not be out of sync or out of harmony with the Word of God but the light of God within us it brings us in harmony and continuity with the Word of God because now it is his life being expressed through you and I it is the absolute manifestation that there is a fellowship between us and God when light itself is reflected and made manifest through our lives so notice in verse 36 for if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as wind the bright shining of a candle does give thee light now we all want to be fooled only no part dark we want to be full full light fully surrendered now notice what David says here in 2nd Samuel 22 29 for Thou art my lamp Oh Lord thou art my lamp Oh Lord and the Lord will lighten my darkness the brother branham makes this statement we're familiar with this and who is this milk hezid I kind of want you to listen this wording here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning you see that little spark of life that you had in you from the beginning when you started your journey so when you started the journey it was a spark of life they said now many of you can remember it you joined this church you joined that church you tried this and that nothing satisfied that's right but one day you just recognized it you see there is already light with light itself or life that was resting within us in that of the seed that God had sown within our heart but there is nothing that can satisfy that life outside of God's own life the as brother brand was putting it here you go from this church to this church you go from here to there but there's something that's not satisfying it's not ministering or meeting the deep that's calling out of the deep in your life there can be a lot of good programs a lot of good things but yet there is only one thing to a believer that ministers to you and I and that is the very life of God church life will never do it they just said to you like this coming to a church will never satisfy a believer and you see this is why that winning is just church life this is why there is such a need for so many other programs and so many other things to try to hold the or to bring people but there's one thing that brings and holds the children of God and that's the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ for it is the power of God on the salvation because we're not interested in a good church life we're interested in his life and this is why that when the substitute of that life very is a thirst that is within man and man will thirst he will crave he is hunger but brother and sister it's not bad to hunger and thirst but it is what we are hungry and thirsting for you see you can tell what you have in your life by what type of thirst and what type of desires that you have in your life that'll tell you what's on the control tower now God has placed that there and there's no way that you and I can find it but it takes the leadership of God to direct us to where that we ought to be brother I hope you understand this is much bigger than you are I this is not our ingenuity our figuring out this is the four-nation of Almighty God and when I look at this how that the scripture would place it in Colossians 1 verse 12 it says giving thanks unto the Father which hath made us meet and that word meat is qualified to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light it was always it's an inheritance the life of God it is an inheritance that was given to us from before the foundation of the world Paul would say it in another place in Ephesians chapter 1 that through the offering of the Lord Jesus Christ we have obtained and inheritance the inheritance was already there but in order for the inheritance to be released there not only had to be that of the testator that to witness of the in hell presents that belong to us but then in order to receive what is wrote in the will there must be the death of the testator that he which has let you and I know what belongs to you and I then now it can be released to us there had to be a death a suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ a payment that was paid for our ransom that that life God's own life our inheritance that belonged to us that that could be released to us and there isn't no one else who did this but the father himself becoming one of us Jesus is not the second person in the Godhead if we were redeemed by the second person were still in sin but it took not coming down and creating a body that he would step into and he by his own life would demonstrate to you and I the inheritance of what it is to be a son and daughter of God he was the perfect example amen so we have been qualified he has qualified you know what qualified means you have a right where they had no access before now you have access floor rabida God you say I'm not qualified but he he has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in life who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins now oxygen I want to read this here to you brother Alan picks this up in this thought he keeps moving this thought around within this series around this timeline of in 1961 and and I want you to understand this as we're looking into this there were so many things that when we look at the message that God has sent to you and I there is a continual unfolding of God's desire and purpose that he has ordained for you and I and for the hour that we're living in it is the ministering of the rights that belong to us as believers and you know brother Branham you know I think God how that the Holy Spirit would take it and put it in such a simple measure of the working of the Holy Ghost in our life and he would say it like this and the message why remember when a man is saved he said it like like there's this much like this button here becomes eternal life in your heart that's God as you're able to push out all the roots of bitterness then God begins to spread in you then you become a son of God now remember you we don't become a son and daughter of God by a church by church life but remember in order for you and I to be here there had to be two parts come together they had to be egg and sperm come together is that right in order for you and I to come forth and that is the same way that it is with God but God does not take anything from us but what it is God has placed within our hearts that seed of himself that when his seed life comes upon that seed it is through that that he breeds back sons and daughters of God again there is no weakness within that DNA as a matter of fact this is where that you and I can stand upon the word that our birth is not a church live but as the scripture said we are not born a flesh born of blood but we have been born of God amen the Holy Ghost amen our mother and hear God our Father the same one working within our life to bring forth that expression my how God has allowed these things to be so simple before us he said a man was made to be a God to be gone he says he's in the image of God he's the son of God he's like God he was given a domain a Dominion over the whole earth he ruled the earth he ruled the animal kingdom and all the other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above he was God he was an amateur God he was made in the image of God made like God had hands and feet like God he was in the image of God this is what God had said I will restore I will make a way back that that image can come into expression once again Alleluia the Lord Jesus Christ is the one that restored and he was the witness the faithful and true witness that testified on behalf of the inheritance of the image of God that belongs to the children of God mmm Oh hallelujah he said but what happened because he disbelieved God's Word it sent him right back out to shift for himself my when this when unbelief comes you're on your own but faith and God's Word brings God on the scene a very simple statement I know but that applies to everything in our life faith in God's Word that God is faithful he knows where you're at he knows the needs in our life unbelief can put us to where we're starting to try to do it on her own and when we try to do anything on our own it takes us away from the program and purpose of God hello somebody but faith in his word it makes us available for God to work on our behalf and that the program and purpose of God will flow in harmony and continuity in our life times we let too many distractions get ahead of us come on somebody sometimes we let we let that go on but thanks be to God for light that'll show that up he said now God's trying to bring him back and when you have faith and you accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out taking out all the roots of doubt and bitterness this is a key point when you have faith it requires there has to be a beginning in your life let me just say it very bluntly if you come here to church and you never ever made a stand for the Lord Jesus Christ you're not even where I'm preaching at this morning you've got to make a decision you can't stay neutral any man well I'm okay how I have no we're not okay how we are Jesus spoke in job three he was speaking to a man that you couldn't put a finger on his life by the name of Nicodemus as a matter of fact he was a member of the Sanhedrin one of the Pharisees and Jesus called those men righteous but Jesus never came to call the righteous to repentance you can put a finger on their life but nonetheless they had to be born again I tell you there is no substitute for the new birth no no substitute I don't care how good you are how good you think you are your goodness is nothing but filthy rotten rats they men were not gotten interested in your righteousness you see how foolish it sounds if we begin to think about our own righteousness then why did he have to come and shed his blood you say we're gonna send you I believe he did that for me then it's time for you to make a stand and repent and say Lord forgive me I am a sinner I need salvation let me just tell you in case you don't know hell is paved for people who know about God the rich young ruler is there and he asked he made a request he said since some of my sent some of the prophets and go send them back where he could look across India hams bosom the promise he send him back sinned don't let my brethren come here don't let them come here but he said they have the law they have the prophets if they won't hear them they will not receive the one comes back from the dead friend don't you realize how blessed it is to be able to have faith to believe to have faith to believe that God would touch your heart God deals to every man a measure of faith he passes by and he raises the faith just in his simplicity whether Svensson might be in the church might be in a hospital room might be somewhere but here the witness of the Holy Ghost can go forth and begin to deal with the heart and let them know that there is one who's already paid a price for you and you can be free brother I'm telling you a word spoke like that but the unction of the Holy Ghost it raises faith within the heart to believe you know this is the promise that the Lord Jesus has made if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me now looking to a church but looking to him so watch this and when you have faith God can't do nothing with our faith and accept him my brother just let that little light begin to grow out remember what says what's the desire is that the candle would be put on the candlestick that when people enter the room they're not even focused on the candle they just see light so you see the focus isn't about us it's about him so if the focus is about him then that's what it has to be through every stage of the journey notice he takes out let's let that little light begin to grow out taking all the roots of doubt and bitterness yielding yourself to the spirit then you begin to become a son of God a daughter of God you begin to grow in the grace of God and the Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom within you brother Branham he goes on in here in the uncertain sound and he says now as i illustrated like a button when a man is saved that much of him is god that's the little light that comes in to make you quick doing what's wrong well I stop this if you stopped it you have to keep its tongue yeah but when he comes in this is what he does why light presses darkness we want our lives full of like what light presses darkness jesus said and brother Breton tells like this he said we just don't want darkness you know placed out of us we want to press that darkness clear to the other side of the earth think about that that's the little light that comes into you to make you quit doing what's wrong now if you can take all the malice and envy and strife and unbelief out over the center how am I going to do that by agreeing with the world as it is exposing and showing things that need to be removed light makes known darkness remember the Bible says in John three that this is the condemnation that light is come in the world and because men rather loved darkness they would not come to the light they wanted to remain doing what they were doing oh but there was some who what they were doing they didn't want to do and so in light has come what did like do like drew them to the very one to the source that could actually ignite and life that combustible part within their life and light itself pushes out darkness hid in the belt I gotta quit doing this and I gotta quit doing this and I gotta quit doing this it's letting the light grow within your life oh my that little button like of the light and power of God will keep growing growing growing crowding out unbelief crowding out what's it doing the light is casting out darkness because the light is coming in its crowding out unbelief and then allowing the world to have free course and all right it crowds how humbly you know how it is sometimes it's easy for things to get crowded out you can let your schedule get so booked up to where Jesus is crowded out you know I'm saying now things can get crowded out why how things come in and this is here when we look at the light and the power of God let it continue to grow within our lives removing all the roots of bitterness and malice and all of those things why that it will crowd out all unbelief you see it isn't you doing it it is the Lord Jesus Christ himself doing it we've got a yield somebody said lord help me yield help me yield lord help me yield he said you don't do it by exhortation zuv bodily exercise you do it by a sanctified consecrated life that the holy spirit moves through you now let's just work that thought just a moment Philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence so what are we looking at obedience obedience is what submission they meant not just when Paul was present but in their in his absence notice work out your own salvation with fear and trembling they meant it shows us right here in the scripture that obedience itself there is a wrestling that goes on obedience itself the flesh will draw against it amen once you have that soul what's that soul has been converted on the inside then you've got strength right there in your wrestling but listen now if you're working to that place or that's where you're at that takes obedience to the world it isn't well I'm just going to sit here until God fills me with the Holy Ghost the Bible said he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey amen obey with faith in the world God cannot do no more for you if you're not walking in the light of his word in obedience it's not just when we're here just saying a man is the beginning when we receive that word but obedience it takes prayer obedience takes dying obedience takes letting go and letting God have his way we are tested with every word that comes our way but brother with the light of God and the power of God within our life if we can just yield to him he crowds out all the unbelief what's he doing he's taking over the body amen like he took over the body when it came up there you know it went there in the in the Dark Ages that went in the grave there and there and that's a tyrant age but then it came up there with with the message that just shall live by faith what was drop doing he was beginning and work in the body then it came that they shall be sanctified by the blood what was he doing taking over more of the body then it came to the restoration of the gift believing in the supernatural what was he doing taking over more of the body and then it comes to the real baptism of the Holy Ghost the person of Jesus Christ now he takes over the body it is the son of man revealed in the bride's body Christ taking over how does he take over by his word by his word he takes over even when he rides back in Revelations 19 the Bible says his vesture dipped in blood and Nepal upon him was written he meant for his name is called the Word of God if not that his name is the word of God but the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is called the Word of God so what we are preaching is the word is the Holy Ghost is the name of Jesus Christ we're not preaching a characteristic of some organization or some man's idea we are preaching the very mind and thoughts of God because that is exactly what sons and daughters of God are learning for and need in order to become real overcomers they need the thoughts of God moving down to collect the thought of God that lays within their life and it takes God to do it work out your own salvation with fear and trembling now this hricko this is more than just coming to church punch in and punch it out hallelujah this is working out our own salvation with fear not slavish fear oh I've got to do this if I don't do this I'm gonna go to hell no that's not the kind of fear we're talking about we're talking about a fear that's a reverence we do what we do because we love Him home I love this word trembling here it is one who the latter part of that it describes like an anxiety of one who distrusts his ability completely to meet all requirements but religiously does his utmost to fulfill his duty and you and I can make the work come to pass but I can give myself to the word and so can you Amen I can give myself to the word coming and and and hearing the preaching of the word listening to the message that God has given us reading within the Scriptures amen and pray amen looking to God I can by doing that that is a duty that God has given to you and I we ought to do that that's this is loaded in the scripture Paul would tell Timothy Telekom give give time to reading to doctrine to exhortation the Bible tells us that all Scripture is given by inspiration from God it is profitable for reproof for rebuke for correction for instruction in righteousness you see why the enemy wants to visit your time up because listen if he can visit your time to where the only clap you hear anything about the Word of God is when you come to church he's got you but listen now it's time for you and I to get into the word and to know the promises that belong to you and I it's times with trembling to give ourselves fully to God that God can come on the scene and say what you were reading it was not my chance here I was directing this for you this is your promise we're not Lodge members [Applause] don't repeat a gun for it is God which worketh in you both to do and and both to will and to do of his good pleasure Mize God's will and to do of his own good pleasure this word worketh here let me let's just look at this for a moment it's to be operative be at work put forth power to work for one aid one to effect or to display one's activity to show oneself operative who is it that's doing this God but God remember he will work according to his word those are switches now there's electric coming in this building there is a power supply out there there is a there is a line that comes in here a telephone pole and then it comes right back in there they break it off there and bring that right into the voltage box then there is wiring that has to take place in order for lights right here to actually benefit from electricity that's coming from a sending station that electricity has to be channelled and has to come into this building and there are breakers and everything that will actually channel that electricity there has to be wires that are set up and then wires have got to be connected when the wires themselves are connected remember wires are conductors wires are not insulators we put insulin insulation or the rubber the plastic outside of that wire why so we can touch it so it doesn't get hot you know and burn and burn here within you know the wood that's in here in the in the walls but inside of that there is a wire that is a conductor that wire does not hinder the flow of the current but that wire itself is only a channel that the current that is coming it actually comes to a place that it allows that current to flow that once it comes on the filaments of these bulbs right here it lights up what does that be electricity so when I'm looking at the lights I'm not seeing the electricity I'm seeing the light but there's one thing about it when I look at that light I know that there is a power source that that lie is tapped into I know that the wire it's not grounded somewhere there's not some part of the word that said I don't know about this but every wire is in tune with God and what does it do it brings a lie sure that's where the word the word moving in our life it brings the wiring the way that it ought to be when the wiring gets to where it ought to be then he says let there be light it's him doing it you see anything in the world you say well I don't want to dress like that I don't want to stop cutting my hair I don't want to stop wearing pants or I don't want to stop doing this I don't want to stop do it you're grounding the power of God well I don't believe that's necessary but remember you're not the chief electrician he is it's your choice whether you want to remain in darkness or you want to be lit up and be light you're not a Christian because you say you're a Christian you're a Christian because Christ Himself reflects his life through you coming to this church does not make you a Christian it does not make you a believer what makes you a believer and declares it is the power of God moving in your life and you live a victorious Christian life god spoke to Joshua let's read this here just a moment God let Joshua know your time has come many types here that we give to Joshua Joshua is the tank of the Holy Ghost a type of the Lord Jesus because it takes the Holy Ghost to bring us into the promises right and then the Prophet would also type it then this is a declaration of the last a ministry why because Jesus Christ the Son of Man would declare to the Church of the Living God not just some promises but this is the time for the fulfilling of all the promises that have been made it's a time where shadows and types are coming into reality and then the Prophet were also under the unction of the Holy Ghost were also declare that Joshua is a type of the spiritual believer so right here this morning I want to look at this as a type of the spiritual believer so here in verse 1 and verse 2 God let's just you a know not something that he didn't already know he knew Moses had died but God's letting him know I didn't and God is letting him know Moses spoke promises and those promises pertain to you Joshua you know about them great qu8 you remember how you and Caleb stood right there on the Word of God you remember these promises now Moses my servant is dead this is a time for transition it's time for you to rise up and to take what God says belong to you you have the message you've had the messenger and he has come to demonstrate and to identify to you what belongs to you he's lettin Joshua know just to see Moses is not enough they met Moses had a message that was calling you into your inheritance and brother that's what this message that God has sent to you and I it is a message and a Ministry of our inheritance in this hour amen it's calling us to the truth baptism of the Holy Ghost it's calling us in a third Exodus where we are to be taken into those bodies that have been prepared the rapture is upon the Church of the Living God God is announcing it it's time to take it in verse 3 he says every place but the sole of your foot shall tread upon that have I given you as I said unto Moses you're not God saying I've indicated Moses I've indicated his message and now I'm gonna vindicate you with that same word my presence as I was with Moses I'll be with you also every place your sole of your foot treads upon God said of our to given to you don't that means brother just way it means that God had already given it to him but they had to have faith to believe and claim what God had already given I don't care how many booger men are all around I don't care how many devils that try to scare and try to put everything up let me tell you someone you go to start taking promises that devil will try to hang every sort of condemnation you try to put ever tell you and every mistake he ever made before your face but you need to stand under the blood of Jesus Christ and say it is not my righteousness it is the righteousness of the blood of the Lamb and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony and if you're not fully under the blood this scripture also applies for you that you can stand and say the Holy Ghost is for me yes sir as soon as you begin to stand on that you'll find some of that that light beginning to grow where you first believed and you're believing it just keeps growing keeps growing it just crowds it out it just crowds it out we'll just wait it's like if you and I are sitting on this pew right here and then everybody on this side tries to come up here eventually something gonna happen you and I are going kicked off this pew you know why because it's just people coming in and that's how it is when we are receiving the word this is why the Prophet could say ask you receive the word you become the word taking that word in it ain't about whether you're worthy or not there ain't none of us were they there ain't none of us were they in ourselves but it is him he rose from the dream he is the testimony he is the wetness we are justified in believing because of him every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon it's time to take ground I said it's time to take ground but I've given you as I said unto Moses and he gives him all the boundaries God sets the boundaries of his word from the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river the river you freeze all the land of the Hittites and unto the Great Sea toward the going down of the Sun shall be your coast God said I know there's darkness and there's Devils jelled welling there but that land belongs to you amen every part every part belongs to us as believers oh my there shall not look at this in verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life now you understand why Joshua when he's asking for the battle plans of Jericho and he sees a man and he looks at that man and he says are you for us or are you against us you know I he's standing on that word because if you're against us I've got a promise man will be able to stand in our way but he announces who he is and because Joshua has been feeding on the son of man of the world on the revelation he recognizes the presence of God as it comes into the meeting and what does he do he submits himself see in order to take Jericho he's got to submit himself to the presence of the captain of the hosts see it is him who according to his will work in you and I sometimes you find the way that you have won certain battles you don't win all the battles with the same pattern but it's the same God you know what he's teaching us to allow there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so will I be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strongly another good courage for unto this people shalt out divide for an inheritance the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law notice according to all of it you've got to take all of it which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whether so ever valve goest Amen this is God's commitment to his word hey listen this church is all up and down this road in other places that they carry Bibles they can preach run out of the Bible and yet not be preaching the Word of God why because they begin to preach the traditions and the theories of man and what does it reduce it never produces victory in people's lives it never produces the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ but it leaves him in a grave in an empty tomb it leaves him in history but rather when the Holy Ghost begins to declare himself what does it do it raises him out of history and it'll drive darkness out of your life it brings change in your life that's why the message that God has sent to us is not some strange concoction of a man's ideas the message is the original message that the Church of the Living God is to live by but it was lost down through the ages and what is that original message that you are to be born again you are to have that life on the inside of you Christ in you the hope of glory you see let me read on here verse eight this book of the law shall not depart out of that mouth see if you're reading it you're observing it it's gonna affect your language what you feed on will talk about what you think on you'll speak about this is why Paul this is the Word of God this is why the Holy Ghost would speak to us put on the helmet of salvation he would tell you and I think all things better have virtue praise good good and true he would direct it let our minds be directed in the right way so many times you can say out show me but that's alright so many times we were talking about too much stuff of this earth and Satan listen he knows every one of us he knows your strengths and your weaknesses but let me remind you your strengths if it's not covered by the blood your strengths can be your biggest hindrance your strength it is not what God chose me because of my strength God didn't need your strength amen everything in our life is to be governed by the Holy Ghost well we're this kind of people and we do this and we do that you're advertising for the devil and how to take up your time and you're a braggart that's called pride amen we're not to be exalting self exaltation of our own family life if you're tapped into the tree of life we're to be exalting the family of God the life of God that's in the tree of life this right here is part of the strategy of winning battles this book of the law shall not depart out of my mouth you've got to start speaking what belongs to you I'm not talking about like a smiley guy from Texas who has a megachurch and you're speaking in Mercedes Benz and you've got perfect pearly white teeth I'm not talking about that stuff I'm talking about promises that God makes real to you you need to start claiming those promises you need to as a prophet wrote in the prayer letter he said when you take this peripheral and you apply to the situation again he said you need to doubt your doubts he said and you need to call anything contrary to the Word of God it's a lie stand upon that word you gotta speak the word Oh glory be to God Omaha therein thou shalt meditate therein day and night Oh Lord don't have time to check Facebook post brother Sam Ian it's like you're trying to run our life no I'm not trying to run your life Jesus just wants to take you over your life but something so many things are so fake in this hour you ask people how many friends you've got well I got 525 you're a liar you ain't got 525 friends I'm not talking about your cyber friends I'm talking about your real friends I'm not talking about those so-called people that you try to impress and feel the pressure I'm talking about some who are real but the devil has filled so many things to try to take our meditation away dear Lord that thou may us observe to do according to all that's written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success have not I commanded thee be strong and of a good courage be not afraid neither be dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest when you're standing face-to-face with the word you got to be of a good courage to be able to stand there and say yes Lord be it unto me but sometimes that word it comes you cuts but everything it cuts it's removing hindrances its chopping away and all the hindrances its suspended good courage and when the word comes is to take the side of the Lord brother balance said it like this and the message messiah mama if you haven't listened that message go ahead the messiah 1961 he said now you don't have to die to get this on what this life you have to spiritually die but you don't have to physically die the inside is where god gets in to control you and as he presses himself forward don't let any root of bitterness hatred malice strife that'll run him right back out hmm so do you think the devil is just gonna sit back and say lights working in their life no he's gonna try to hinder oh lord you mean he might cause people to do things and i think are wrong and then i get an attitude about it mmm getting it now you mean he might get on my boss and close me two men become bitter towards him and he's an unbeliever yep yeah because the devil knows if he can get roots of bitterness in your life he stifles the work of light but you understand if you'll just stand there and say lord i need help my flesh is saying one thing my spirit is being pulled one thing but down here on the inside the Son of God Who I am they men I'm looking to You Lord you fight my battles I give it over to you you know what happened rather light just steps forward in that area of your life it was a battle you just put your lunch box you just put everything in the locker you're ready to go check in and you're met right there in battle but that battle is an opportunity for light to step forward well said I'm just crowding it out just crowding it out pretty soon you don't even feel at liberty to act that way y'all have been shouting glory on that one I don't even have I don't even have the room to act out like that anymore hmm it's crowding out Jesus has taken over he don't want just one little office brother he wants the whole building [Applause] oh yeah oh my my my glory be to God let's try to find somewhere to get a get off here he said you just get all the meanness and the superstitions and all the unbelief out of you and every time you move out a little unbelief God steps right in and takes over move out unbelief oh my unbelief is what is doubt unbelief is what anything contrary to the Word of God glory he told Joshua everywhere the soles of your foot has said that I'll give you and tonight as we enter into the kingdom God's kingdom taking out all the Philistine unbelievers and all the amorite sin the Amalekites and whatever more throw it out of us like that we take possession of em said Amen I like that says days of miracles has passed you have a right get out of me I put a footprint there I took over there's no such thing as seeing visions get out of there you are Malachi I'm coming over there you are you're pressing out why because the Lord is with thee from that little button is taking over the fibers of you spreading out God working through you in you and around you who's doing it he's doing ground is being cleaned he's spreading out in our life he's taking over any men now notice how Paul would pray for this year in Ephesians 3 let me just skip over some of this here Paul would speak of the burden that is upon his heart to preach the unsearchable riches of Christ and verse 9 to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery I like fellowship and with the mystery you know what the mystery is it's the mystery of God the mystery of God is Christ in you the Holy Ghost I like fellowshipping with the mystery and I can fellowship with the mystery human when I'm on my riding lawn more I can fellowship with the mystery when I'm riding down the road get on in one exit plug your ears those that you just got your temps and driver's license and then realize when I get off at another exit I can fellowship get so caught away in his presence I'm not working nothing up but you're not if you just struck thinking about a little something and before you know it that little thought that you just started meditating on it just starts taking over and if you think on that what does it do it is casting out all that gloom oh it's a Monday morning it's just casting it out man that word is just it's a light it's ruminating you you find strength glory somebody say I think that Amen it's available all you have to do is think about him but the devil wants to try to cram so much else in I got to think about this worry about this worry about that worry about this worry about that some of you know right now that are our two older boys here they'll be going to college here this coming year and I'm telling what's the truth all of the paper working things that I've had to do and attend to and those you know as parents and then I have things that goes on you know with even with Benjamin where I've got state and everything else I got to redo this and do that and do this as I'm filing all that I'm telling you this because it seems like it just things just keep piling up got to sort through this and sort through that and sort through this and then all of a sudden here then I get that paper in then I get this one over here and you go back you pull up your email the thread oh yeah yeah yeah they said mr. brownie we got off now I knew they already had and I read that email before so what are you saying there is things that I enjoy I can't control of more responsibility that I have you can't control sometimes I can't control sometimes come on now there's sometimes there's stuff we take on we take on that we don't need to be taking on oh I never ordained you or me to be the savior of the world preach brother Santa thank you I will but there are things like this that you've got to fill out your taxes you've got to do this you've got to do that sometimes the responsibility grows I was thinking there you know just even a month or so glass-top you know I I kind of wish they were still back in diapers it was easier because once they were changed they went on their way now you're worrying about this and this and I'm looking at this and I got this and got that and whatever morning I'm not saying that to make them feel bad you can buy me dinner later but but I what I'm trying to say is is that there's more responsibility I can't shirk that responsibility but it's held that I place the priorities in my life if I make that first my spiritual life will go right down the tubes and this church because I'm the pastor will suffer with it so it's about how you prioritize things you're not always going to be able to shirk it and boy I'm gonna live a real victorious life and when it gets to December oh praise God everything will slow to hell in December and then every day of your life you're called to live in victory it's just the devil that wants to try to make you feel like I can't get this done I gotta get this time I got to do this I got to do this and then I'll have time for this over here and by the time you get to this over here your life it's priorities even in the starting of our day started with the lamb I'm not telling you for some of you that are about ready to faint like Oh Lord I've got to get it at 5:00 in the morning and go into prayer coughing now I'm telling you that cuz you probably fall asleep what I'm trying to tell you is you start your day with the Lord take that verse of scripture take that verse of scripture that pops up take that pray and say Lord guide me today why because this is a day I want you to take ground in my life a day where it spreads out in my life and he's in you taking over one of these days one of these days it'll be the final step the final taking over will take us home what's he doing he's taking over in our life let's just stop here lord have your way have your way Lord I'd say that across the building if you haven't surrendered your life to the Lord would you do that today not because brother Samuel has mentioned that to you but wouldn't you just just to serve him and let him it's not trying to please a church but it's let him let him because by faith when you receive that that little light about the size of the button it'll start working in your life and it's him making you quit doing things well how is he making he just the more as you are letting him and yielding he just keeps building in your life and pretty soon the things that you thought I need this there's no way I can let go of this the more that he comes in it crowds that out and he just crowds out all those things too you stand there and you say wow I don't know and do I not do that no more I don't even miss it you know why he's crowding out unbelief he's just making himself at home cuz you're inviting him in hey yeah yeah that that chair you can put your feet up on that chair Jesus here it reclines lord have you seen this here in this room sit down right here in this chair order and look at this view right here Lord is there anything here is there any certain decorations that need to be change anything no see what I know I know just your presence he convicts me I need to stop giving my eyes to those things stop giving my ear so then things that he says then you bring him on Anna's Lord I want you I want you to look at this room he comes in right here sit down this is the best chair in this room he looks around and once again conviction because you see light exposes darkness what's happening he's he by his presence is causing you to say what he is declaring see what it is you're in continuity with him just like when Adam could say tree be plucked up move over here and God said just what I was thinking look better there what's happening you're becoming more in tune with his mind you're sensitive to the things you know how it is brother sister your wife can look at something you say how does this tile look and she did it look go ahead just take it off you know no need waiting you already know I mean you can already feel by the expression how much more the Lord Jesus sometimes it's just him moving in and us inviting him in that area of our life he's the one to tell us take down those pictures he's just his presence it brings conviction but all it brings liberty it brings liberty in our life and you know brother and sister it doesn't stop it keeps going and anyone want to be remembered in prayer this morning as we go before the throne of God amen god bless your hands amen God knows your need a man dear Lord Jesus Lord I thank you for the simplicity of the gospel of Jesus Christ what is so simple how that Lord that you you let us know it's you and your encouragement by your presence is that we would yield lord help us there's hands Lord God throughout this building that Lord are raised to you

hearts desire that you would continue to take over in our life more there's things that I can witness in my own life things that as years went on that as you keep working in my life there's certain things about Lord character molding and shaping that you point out to me O Lord godly convicts me I'm convicted or God and your presence by that light Lord God I don't I know I can't stay the same I don't want to stay the same I want to continue to be molded to be shaped and Lord God the hands and the hearts of my brothers and sisters what God for their good courage to be able or to stand Lord

that every situation is an opportunity for you to gain ground in their life help us Lord operator may the light of God's so flow so move in our hearts and our lives Lord help those that have not surrendered yet I pray Lord God not that they would be cursed through that Lord God of my words but may it be your presence Lord maybe this morning Lord God the courage within their hearts may be Lord about their life there's a resistance but I pray for the mercy of God then Lord Jesus that even at this moment or in moments to come may you Lord God help of the see you're not against him your forum your desires to loosen them to move in their life Lord and to release or beginning to release in them a life that they could never imagine never ever imagined but a setting free granite this morning Lord God may we walk and live in your depths or God as light in the Lord granite Lord Jesus continued to take over Lord in our lives continue to work in a smooth may we be found faithful to take the
