[37:32] god gives a word god gives a message
[37:35] then the testing time comes
[37:38] the time that when that when
[37:41] that part of the bride is uniting with
[37:43] that word
[37:44] then the word itself in flesh is tested
[37:48] in that part of the bride just as it was
[37:50] when the lord jesus
[37:52] went up there and was tempted
[37:55] of the devil
[37:57] and he overcame
[37:59] by the word
[38:02] and we recognize that we're overcoming
[38:04] by the word
[38:06] it's not a word on the outside of us but
[38:09] it's the word of god on the inside of us
[38:12] and we're overcoming by the blood of the
[38:14] lamb
[38:16] by the word of the testimony
[38:18] amen of that same stock of that same
[38:21] caliber
[38:22] oh my
[38:23] how thankful we are for the grace of god
[38:25] tonight
[38:26] amen truly we can't say enough
[38:30] child paul would say let us have grace
[38:32] whereby we may serve him acceptable
[38:36] aren't you glad for grace
[38:38] comes to correct us
[38:40] comes to lift us
[38:42] comes to deal with our life that's grace
[38:45] see the way the world presents grace and
[38:47] the way that
[38:49] most of the churches present grace is
[38:51] it's as though that you can do anything
[38:53] you want to and you know god still loves
[38:56] you but that's not real grace
[39:00] grace comes to deal with our lives
[39:03] even when it came for israel to come up
[39:05] to the promised land remember
[39:08] even the testimony that joshua and caleb
[39:10] brought back was the spirit of grace
[39:14] remember how paul would write about it
[39:16] he would say that those that rejected it
[39:18] they did despite
[39:20] unto the spirit of grace
[39:22] although we we want to receive the
[39:24] spirit of grace we
[39:26] amen it's it's the grace of god that's
[39:28] here making us ready
[39:30] for that great moment
[39:33] amen and i say that moment is upon us
[39:36] we're here
[39:37] we've arrived
[39:39] amen
[39:40] let's just bow our hearts
[39:42] to him in a word of prayer
[39:43] [Music]
[39:45] heavenly father
[39:48] lord we're just so thankful for this
[39:50] opportunity that we have here this
[39:52] evening
[39:54] lord a few moments that we have
[39:57] to just come away in your presence
[40:01] lord we realize that
[40:03] it's more than
[40:06] lord just just coming to a
[40:08] service for the privilege of the
[40:11] believer is that we might live
[40:14] in the presence of god
[40:16] because lord it's your presence
[40:18] accompanying our lives oh god by the
[40:20] holy ghost
[40:22] but it's just something special about it
[40:24] lord when we can
[40:26] come together
[40:27] as paul would write lord in the hebrews
[40:29] that we would forsake not to assemble
[40:31] ourselves together
[40:33] your prophet would tell us lord that
[40:35] when we come together those licks of
[40:37] fire he said it's the godhead bodily
[40:39] among us lord
[40:41] and father
[40:42] there's no telling lord
[40:44] what you will do
[40:46] i just pray tonight lord in this this
[40:49] time that we've gathered here
[40:52] lord i don't believe that anybody has
[40:54] come here lord to take up time
[40:57] because there's a lot of things that
[40:59] lord that maybe would say would be on
[41:01] our plate
[41:02] things that lord that could be very
[41:04] pressing but lord we've come here
[41:07] tonight to have a meeting with you lord
[41:11] dear god we believe that you've arranged
[41:13] it before the foundation of the world
[41:16] and so lord as we come into your
[41:18] presence we want to invite you lord we
[41:21] believe you're here

[41:33] this congregation all together lord to
[41:36] just be able to step aside now
[41:39] that you could come down among us lord

[42:02] are times where setbacks and things will

[42:07] focus is upon that true report lord that

[44:13] amen we i want to just as we turn to
[44:15] ephesians chapter 3 if you would i want
[44:18] to read a few verses out of there
[44:19] tonight i want to announce to you
[44:22] brother barry had contacted me this
[44:23] morning you know he's over there in
[44:24] poland and he's been going around to a
[44:26] few of those countries and
[44:29] right now during this week and uh
[44:32] we're not gonna he asked if we could
[44:34] just
[44:36] cancel the services and maybe just to
[44:39] we're going to reschedule lord willing
[44:40] at a later date but
[44:42] he's weary right now he's just been
[44:43] going day and night and he's still not
[44:45] back and
[44:46] you just continue to keep him in your
[44:48] prayers as well
[44:50] i wondered if it would be too much
[44:52] we had had it planned out and like i
[44:54] said there was some communication there
[44:57] and then
[44:59] last week we were talking and he just
[45:01] felt you know so let's go ahead and look
[45:03] at it but i didn't know
[45:06] he didn't know either of everything that
[45:07] would take place there in poland there's
[45:10] a lot of
[45:11] pictures and videos that he even has
[45:13] shared with a lot of the different ones
[45:15] of refugees and
[45:17] things that have come from ukraine and
[45:22] so just keep him in prayer
[45:25] as well i don't know exactly the date
[45:27] that he returns i think it might i would
[45:30] imagine it's going to be this week or
[45:32] the first part of next week so just keep
[45:34] him in prayer as well
[45:35] also youth meeting tomorrow evening
[45:39] there at our home at 7 pm certainly look
[45:41] forward to being with the young people
[45:44] and
[45:46] well as we're looking into ephesians 3
[45:48] and i just want to say thank you for
[45:49] your prayers as well as we were there
[45:52] with
[45:53] jonathan martin and
[45:55] the saints and spoke there on sunday
[45:57] morning and then sunday evening to the
[46:00] young people servants just had just
[46:03] just a wonderful time
[46:04] in the presence of the lord so
[46:07] they just wanted to
[46:08] send their greetings as well
[46:11] so let's let's read here in ephesians 3
[46:13] verse 1 i don't mean to keep you
[46:15] standing
[46:16] you're probably tired from the day let's
[46:18] read here in verse 1
[46:21] for this calls i paul the prisoner of
[46:23] jesus christ
[46:25] for you gentiles notice how paul is
[46:28] recognizing is the purpose
[46:30] i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for
[46:33] you
[46:34] gentiles
[46:36] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[46:38] the grace of god that has given me to
[46:42] you word
[46:43] how that by revelation he made known
[46:46] unto me the mystery
[46:48] as i wrote a four
[46:50] in few words whereby when you read you
[46:52] may understand my knowledge in the
[46:55] mystery of christ
[46:57] which in other ages was not made known
[46:59] unto the sons of men as it is now
[47:02] revealed unto his holy apostles and
[47:04] prophets by the spirit
[47:07] i want you to catch that it's revealed
[47:09] by the spirit
[47:10] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[47:14] and of the same body
[47:16] and partakers of his promise
[47:19] in christ
[47:21] by the gospel
[47:23] whereof i was made a minister according
[47:25] to the gift of the grace of god given
[47:28] unto me by the effectual working
[47:30] of his power
[47:32] unto me
[47:33] who am less than the least of all saints
[47:36] is this grace given that i should preach
[47:39] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[47:41] riches of christ
[47:43] verse 9 is where i really want to get to
[47:46] and to make all men see
[47:48] what is the fellowship
[47:50] of the mystery
[47:52] so paul's just he spoke about the
[47:54] mystery that was given unto him or that
[47:56] was revealed which was hidden in god
[47:59] and now the holy spirit has revealed
[48:02] that mystery now paul
[48:04] is expressing verse 9 and to make all
[48:07] men
[48:08] see we realize not all men
[48:11] will see
[48:12] but those that are ordained to see will
[48:15] enter in
[48:17] to fellowship with this mystery
[48:19] so and to make all men see what is the
[48:22] fellowship of the mystery so there's
[48:24] there's an anointing paul is announcing
[48:26] there is an anointing of the word of the
[48:29] gospel by the spirit of god to open the
[48:32] eyes of the believer to see this
[48:35] fellowship
[48:36] isn't that tremendous how the holy
[48:38] spirit comes see the word it comes with
[48:41] transforming power and there's a vision
[48:43] behind it to open our understanding and
[48:46] to build faith and to build courage to
[48:48] know what god has for us
[48:51] oh i just love that and to make all men
[48:54] see what is the fellowship of the
[48:55] mystery which from the beginning of the
[48:57] world hath been hid in god who created
[49:00] all things by jesus christ
[49:02] to the intent that now unto the
[49:05] principalities and powers in heavenly
[49:07] places might be known by the church the
[49:10] manifold wisdom of god
[49:13] according to the eternal purpose which
[49:14] he purposed in christ jesus our lord
[49:18] in whom
[49:19] we have boldness
[49:22] and access with confidence by the faith
[49:26] of him
[49:27] amen may god bless the word as you're
[49:29] being seated i'd just like to speak to
[49:31] you a few moments we've been looking at
[49:33] communion we've been talk we've been
[49:35] speaking
[49:36] on prayer
[49:38] and i want to just speak here
[49:40] as we've looked at the desire for
[49:42] fellowship and i want to speak this
[49:44] evening on entering
[49:45] entering into fellowship
[49:48] and when we look here within this verse
[49:52] this this is the result
[49:55] of this fellowship this mystery being
[49:58] unfolded and entering into this
[50:02] in fellowship to this mystery it brings
[50:04] about as verse 12 is saying in him
[50:08] we have a courage and a confidence
[50:10] an unreserved
[50:12] approach to god
[50:14] with freedom and without fear
[50:17] see god wants to remove
[50:20] anything and what would be between us
[50:23] and him to have full fellowship
[50:26] and there's no way that we could remove
[50:28] that
[50:29] but god himself made a way by coming
[50:32] down that what that wall that barrier
[50:35] what was between you and i
[50:38] could actually be dealt with but god
[50:40] dealt with it and provided for you and i
[50:43] that you and i can come
[50:45] unto him and come fully into fellowship
[50:49] with him just as adam and eve did in the
[50:52] beginning and so god made this in this
[50:56] way and to think we would have a courage
[50:59] and a confidence because as we've looked
[51:01] at it here even in some of the sundays
[51:03] that god
[51:04] he will make things known to you and i
[51:06] sometimes he'll speak it right out
[51:08] there's other times you'll be listening
[51:10] to a message or you're reading in the
[51:12] scriptures and something will strike
[51:15] your heart right into the service or
[51:17] wherever it might be and as it strikes
[51:19] your heart then you begin to enter into
[51:21] prayer
[51:22] and begin to ask god to come and fulfill
[51:25] that in your life because
[51:27] that's a law of the kingdom that we
[51:29] would ask jesus said ask for the holy
[51:32] ghost and god will give it to you now
[51:35] the only way we can really ask is that
[51:37] we have to have faith that that belongs
[51:39] to us or any other promise of god or
[51:42] whatever it is that god is speaking to
[51:45] us in this time in this hour
[51:47] you and i are not moving into promises
[51:50] or moving into things that where we are
[51:52] presuming but god is making known to you
[51:56] and i just exactly what we need to be
[51:58] praying for in this hour the prophet
[52:01] would call it in this way and i don't
[52:03] have time to preach on this tonight but
[52:05] he would speak of how that prayer is
[52:07] really the radar of the church of the
[52:10] living god he said because when by a
[52:12] radar they don't fly a plane or they
[52:15] don't fly anything by looking out just
[52:17] the windows at site remember that's how
[52:20] a lot of uh of pilots they've crashed
[52:23] into into water because the water is
[52:25] dark and they hadn't really learned to
[52:27] fly by the instruments so god in the god
[52:30] by the holy spirit brings the church
[52:33] into praying by the radar of the holy
[52:36] ghost praying for things that are
[52:38] oncoming events but god is desiring that
[52:41] those things would come to pass in our
[52:43] life now you can bring it down on a
[52:45] personal level you can bring it down and
[52:48] place it as far as a body of believers
[52:50] right here in this local church then
[52:52] bringing it also into the body of jesus
[52:55] christ around the world because there
[52:57] are things that god is pressing upon
[53:00] your heart and my heart to pray for
[53:02] individually in our lives then there are
[53:04] things that god is pressing in our
[53:06] hearts as a congregation to pray for the
[53:09] congregation then there are things also
[53:12] for the body of jesus christ so we we
[53:15] know that there are things that we are
[53:17] praying for and and that's part of god
[53:20] being able to reveal his word to you and
[53:22] i as the prophet called it love secrets
[53:25] where he would speak to you and i lip to
[53:28] here now now don't get in your mind that
[53:30] you know in a way well i haven't heard
[53:32] god speak to me well maybe there's
[53:34] things that god is dealing with or
[53:36] desires to deal with that's hindering
[53:39] him from speaking to you in that way it
[53:42] doesn't mean that you're not a part of
[53:43] the body but it might mean that there
[53:45] are things that you've allowed to come
[53:47] in and get you bogged down and silenced
[53:50] and and tuned and put that voice out
[53:53] from it being the preamble predominant
[53:55] or preeminent voice in your life you say
[53:57] what must i do i recognize that and then
[54:00] identify the very thing that he's
[54:02] calling out as a hindrance in your life
[54:04] it might be unconfessed sin it might be
[54:07] things that you've allowed to creep into
[54:09] your life but there is a blood that is
[54:11] present and you see the blood is not
[54:14] something that was just shed back there
[54:16] before the foundation of the world in
[54:18] the mind of god and then here at calvary
[54:20] but the holy spirit that was in that
[54:22] blood cell is present to bring
[54:25] conviction and deal with our hearts
[54:27] that's how that the blood of jesus
[54:29] christ is still present right here to be
[54:32] able to dismantle sin to be able to deal
[54:35] with our lives and bring us into full
[54:38] fellowship
[54:39] and so when we we think of this that's
[54:41] the great privilege that we have of this
[54:44] of this mystery of god to fellowship
[54:46] with this mystery now don't don't don't
[54:48] let the word mystery get you know way
[54:51] out here like oh my it's something
[54:53] that's ooh and nobody understands no
[54:55] remember it's not man who who who moves
[54:58] into it to understand it but it's god by
[55:01] grace that unfolds to you and i
[55:04] as a matter of fact without the
[55:06] anointing of the holy spirit coming in
[55:08] this age through the word and speaking
[55:11] to you and i you and i would not know
[55:13] where we are at within this scripture
[55:15] you ever ever had anybody calling you
[55:17] and say help me i'm lost and you say
[55:18] where are you i don't know where i'm at
[55:20] what you're really not going to be able
[55:21] to help them at all right because they
[55:23] don't know where they're at but you see
[55:25] when there is an anointing that can come
[55:28] to show you and i where we are at and
[55:31] where we should be then then we can get
[55:33] clarity and the pathway opens of how to
[55:36] get where we should really be so then
[55:39] what was a mystery no longer is a
[55:41] mystery what was confusion and
[55:43] frustration no longer is confusion and
[55:46] frustration it becomes clarity and where
[55:49] there is clarity then faith itself can
[55:52] be let loose into the promises of god
[55:55] that god has for and is calling for in
[55:57] our lives
[55:59] so when we look at this mystery of god
[56:01] paul would write of how that this
[56:03] mystery was revealed to him he would he
[56:06] would it would you know clearly declare
[56:08] this was not something that that that it
[56:10] was learned by a seminary by a
[56:12] theologian
[56:14] this was not something that he learned
[56:16] in a school somewhere paul had a lot of
[56:17] schooling through gamilia but it was
[56:20] remember paul could write in galatians 1
[56:23] that the same god who separated me from
[56:26] my mother's womb is the same god who
[56:29] taught me this revelation you see god
[56:32] the god's way of teaching is that he
[56:35] himself would come personally and reveal
[56:38] himself to you and i there's a lot of
[56:40] things about it in the word of god and
[56:42] in our life and that that can be
[56:44] mysterious to us or we can have
[56:46] questions about but when he comes on the
[56:49] scene and as we're praying about it
[56:51] remember god will give an unction of
[56:53] things for you to pray about you think
[56:55] in a service like this or a service that
[56:58] comes on sunday if he tarries it ought
[57:00] to be something that as you're praying
[57:03] you are praying and expecting god to
[57:05] come on the scene and speak and minister
[57:08] and answer questions and dissolve doubts
[57:11] we are serving a living god we are not
[57:14] here just to uh just among a group of
[57:17] people and just to come here and play
[57:19] church we are here to have a meeting
[57:21] with god this is a time that that thing
[57:24] wrongs can be made right it's a time
[57:26] where understanding is open it's a time
[57:29] where things that were mysterious become
[57:31] clear to us as believers that's our
[57:34] promises and you have a right to ask god
[57:38] to come and reveal these things to you
[57:41] it belongs to you and i in this hour and
[57:44] that's god's desire as we would ask him
[57:47] so paul paul knows this and he knows
[57:50] that this divine revelation of the holy
[57:52] ghost this mystery of god of the effect
[57:56] because this mystery of god will
[57:58] actually it'll put the people of god
[58:00] right in position right where they need
[58:03] to be and to think if you can just bring
[58:05] it down like this that the real
[58:07] fellowship of the mystery of god it
[58:10] brings us back into a place of an open
[58:12] channel where we are just exactly where
[58:15] we need to be under the blood of jesus
[58:18] christ where god can speak to us at any
[58:20] time let me say it where prayer is not
[58:23] something of a ritual but rather your
[58:26] life has become a channel that's in tune
[58:28] with god where the scripture says pray
[58:31] without ceasing there is a fulfillment
[58:34] going on in your life there is a channel
[58:36] of fellowship that has been open to you
[58:39] and we're not just praying about we heal
[58:42] this one lord touch this one lord but
[58:44] there is a channel that's open where god
[58:47] is revealing his word to you and i in
[58:49] this hour i believe we ought to pray
[58:51] about requests there's many requests
[58:54] that we have but listen we have god
[58:56] speaking lift to hear to us of things
[58:59] right now that pertain what is going on
[59:01] now and what is coming down the road and
[59:04] we should be in prayer we are not and we
[59:07] are not in darkness paul said you are
[59:09] children of the light paul would write i
[59:11] would not have you ignorant
[59:13] who is it that would not have a
[59:15] signature it's god and paul said i
[59:18] realize what's been revealed will will
[59:20] remove ignorance from the children of
[59:23] the living god it's god's light to you
[59:26] and i
[59:28] so when we looked at this this mystery
[59:30] of god is just like the positioning of
[59:33] the children of israel within the land
[59:36] of inheritance that inheritance was
[59:38] already given to them
[59:40] before time is that right
[59:42] when their names was called out as they
[59:44] were being birthed their position was
[59:46] already given to them but they had to
[59:49] come fully into that place of
[59:52] inheritance and it would take joshua it
[59:56] would take that of the holy spirit not
[59:58] the law the letter could not do it it
[1:00:00] would take the holy spirit you see we
[1:00:02] can know the letter and the law and it
[1:00:05] will bring we can see that that there
[1:00:07] are things that must be lined up but the
[1:00:09] same holy spirit who gave the law he
[1:00:13] desires to pack us into position
[1:00:17] and release to you and i
[1:00:19] what belongs to us
[1:00:22] watch how paul would write this in
[1:00:24] colossians 1 26 even the mystery which
[1:00:26] had been hid from ages and from
[1:00:29] generations but is now notice but is now
[1:00:32] made manifest to his saints to whom god
[1:00:35] would make known what is the riches of
[1:00:38] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:00:40] gentiles notice whom god
[1:00:42] would make known
[1:00:44] which is christ in you the hope of glory
[1:00:48] that's that's the mystery it's christ in
[1:00:51] you the hope of glory
[1:00:54] whom we preach warning every man and
[1:00:57] teaching every man in all wisdom that we
[1:01:00] may present every man perfect in christ
[1:01:04] jesus whereunto i also labor striving
[1:01:07] according to his working which worketh
[1:01:09] in me mightily so you know when we look
[1:01:13] at the time that here we are where we
[1:01:16] are we are standing in this hour this is
[1:01:19] adoption time
[1:01:21] this is the time
[1:01:22] that it speaks in romans 8
[1:01:25] that the earth is groaning and
[1:01:27] travailing
[1:01:28] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[1:01:31] this is why the earth the batching forth
[1:01:34] of the earthquakes and the volcanoes the
[1:01:37] earth itself is calling to come back
[1:01:40] fully under the manifestation or the
[1:01:43] rulership of the sons and daughters of
[1:01:45] god you see the earth knows her position
[1:01:48] oh mine
[1:01:49] the earth knows she's out of position
[1:01:52] is that right she's been tilted over but
[1:01:55] there is a groaning within her to come
[1:01:57] back in position why she is a redeemable
[1:02:01] attribute of god that's exactly how it
[1:02:05] was and it is inside of you it's a
[1:02:07] longing to come right back into position
[1:02:10] through the fall we were taken out of
[1:02:12] position but by the grace of god we are
[1:02:16] brought back into position in our soul
[1:02:18] by the baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:02:21] soon and very soon we will receive a
[1:02:23] body that matches the experience on the
[1:02:26] inside brother this lining up does not
[1:02:29] stop here then on the eternity it only
[1:02:32] moves forth in our soul to where our
[1:02:34] bodies now will receive that oncoming
[1:02:37] straightening where it will not be a
[1:02:39] bodyborne of man and woman it will be a
[1:02:42] body
[1:02:43] he shall call and i will answer
[1:02:46] oh glory be to god
[1:02:49] we're right in the time of the adoption
[1:02:51] of sons or placing of sons but you see
[1:02:54] brother graham said they've adopted
[1:02:56] something else and they don't know the
[1:02:58] mystery of god
[1:03:00] so what is the mystery of god the
[1:03:02] mystery of god is the holy ghost
[1:03:06] now you see when we say it that way and
[1:03:08] so simple paul would say great is the
[1:03:11] mystery of godliness
[1:03:13] and yet it would you we we hear that
[1:03:15] said so much of the holy ghost and i
[1:03:18] have the holy ghost and i'm talking
[1:03:19] about all around us
[1:03:21] it's it's a common term that you can get
[1:03:24] among many many other churches and
[1:03:25] things as well but you see when we paul
[1:03:28] would write it that they've adopted
[1:03:30] something else instead of the mystery of
[1:03:34] god
[1:03:35] you see because the real mystery of god
[1:03:37] being revealed it brings us into
[1:03:41] divine fellowship with god under the
[1:03:45] blood
[1:03:46] amen as new creations in christ jesus
[1:03:50] now notice brother braden would go on in
[1:03:52] revelations book of symbols and he would
[1:03:54] talk about he said people don't know the
[1:03:57] mystery of god
[1:03:58] they've not been taught the mystery of
[1:04:00] god the only thing he said that they are
[1:04:02] being taught is join your turn to church
[1:04:05] put your name on the book be a good
[1:04:07] fellow treat your neighbor right can i
[1:04:08] add to that a little bit just believe
[1:04:10] god sent a prophet but that's not the
[1:04:12] mystery of god
[1:04:16] that's not the mystery of god well just
[1:04:18] just say i believe the message that's
[1:04:19] not the mystery of god remember the
[1:04:22] message is that get into christ
[1:04:27] the message is a message that says get
[1:04:30] in christ get under the blood
[1:04:34] amen the message is that's what it is so
[1:04:37] notice now they've been taught these
[1:04:39] other things but he says you know you
[1:04:42] must know the mystery of god now this is
[1:04:44] personally that we must know the mystery
[1:04:48] of god and no man can reveal it to you
[1:04:50] but the one that had the book the bible
[1:04:53] said no man can call jesus the christ
[1:04:55] only by the holy ghost
[1:04:58] you see only by the holy ghost in your
[1:05:01] life
[1:05:02] can you call jesus to christ in other
[1:05:04] words to say he is the mighty conqueror
[1:05:07] he is the one that overthrew sin that
[1:05:10] overthrew the world that overthrew the
[1:05:12] flesh that overthrew the devil how do
[1:05:14] you know that because you've had a
[1:05:17] personal experience with that living
[1:05:20] lord jesus christ and he is manifesting
[1:05:23] his glory his power and his authority
[1:05:26] through your life as a redeemed son and
[1:05:28] daughter of god
[1:05:30] that's the great mystery of it because
[1:05:32] remember the new birth itself is a
[1:05:35] mystery it's not something that can be
[1:05:38] explained is that right even as as jesus
[1:05:41] would speak in john 3 that you know the
[1:05:44] wind bloweth where it listeth you know
[1:05:45] that no man know when to come and
[1:05:47] whether it goes so is everyone that is
[1:05:49] born of the spirit of god
[1:05:53] right you then become a paradox a
[1:05:56] mystery let's just be honest you are a
[1:05:59] paradox in your own south because you
[1:06:02] cannot explain but you know that a
[1:06:04] reality has taken place in your life and
[1:06:07] what is that that now is entrance of
[1:06:10] fellowship with the mystery of god
[1:06:14] oh blessed be his name now notice how he
[1:06:17] would write that in revelations chapter
[1:06:20] 1 verse 1. think of this the revelation
[1:06:23] of jesus christ
[1:06:25] which god gave unto him
[1:06:27] to show his servants things which must
[1:06:30] shortly come to pass and he sent and
[1:06:32] signified it by his angel unto his
[1:06:34] servant john who bear record of the word
[1:06:37] of god and of the testimony of jesus
[1:06:38] christ and all things which he saw
[1:06:42] now now think of this in verse 3 blessed
[1:06:45] is he that readeth and they that hear
[1:06:47] the words of this prophecy and keep
[1:06:49] those things which are written therein
[1:06:50] for the time
[1:06:52] is at hand
[1:06:54] john to the seven churches which are in
[1:06:56] asia grace be to you and peace from him
[1:07:00] which is and which was and which is to
[1:07:03] come and from the seven spirits which
[1:07:06] are before his throne and from jesus
[1:07:09] christ who is the faithful witness and
[1:07:11] the first begotten of the dead and the
[1:07:13] prince of the kings of the earth unto
[1:07:16] him that loved us and washed us from our
[1:07:20] sins in his own blood and hath made us
[1:07:23] kings and priests unto god and his
[1:07:25] father to him be glory and dominion
[1:07:28] forever and ever amen now notice what
[1:07:31] this revelation of jesus christ as it
[1:07:34] comes forth the word of god and the
[1:07:37] testimony of jesus christ it bears
[1:07:40] witness together in other words
[1:07:42] a person cannot truly have the real
[1:07:45] baptism of the holy ghost and their life
[1:07:48] not being testified of in the word of
[1:07:50] god because you see this is the spirit
[1:07:53] of truth it will direct us into the
[1:07:56] truth the holy ghost will never cause
[1:07:58] someone to depart from the truth when
[1:08:01] they depart from the truth that's a sign
[1:08:03] they never met jesus christ they know
[1:08:06] about him now remember brother graham
[1:08:08] said that a good baptist he said a good
[1:08:10] baptist or a man can take you in the
[1:08:12] scriptures and twist you around and make
[1:08:15] you think like you don't know nothing
[1:08:17] but he said that man has only known him
[1:08:21] in the flesh
[1:08:23] but you're not saved by knowing him in
[1:08:26] the flesh you must know him in the
[1:08:29] spirit of revelation the holy ghost
[1:08:34] where god would make himself known now
[1:08:36] watch how john
[1:08:37] written under inspiration here this is
[1:08:40] the announcement remember john was the
[1:08:42] one that jesus said what it be what what
[1:08:44] is it to you if this man come if he
[1:08:46] tarry till i come and remember there was
[1:08:48] a saying that went out oh you know
[1:08:51] jesus said this here and this is wrong
[1:08:54] but what it is they misunderstood he
[1:08:56] would see the coming of the lord but the
[1:08:59] coming of the lord remember is that of a
[1:09:01] secret coming it would be the coming of
[1:09:03] the holy ghost down through
[1:09:06] seven gentile ages and it would be
[1:09:09] capped off here in the seventh in that
[1:09:11] of the bride coming where the fullness
[1:09:14] of the holy ghost would come to the body
[1:09:17] of jesus christ and there would be a
[1:09:19] uniting of bride and groom together
[1:09:22] where we're no longer twain but now we
[1:09:25] have become one you see that's the
[1:09:27] announcement of the scripture and here
[1:09:30] john is announcing there that these are
[1:09:33] not two separate things he's announcing
[1:09:35] that that this grace and this peace that
[1:09:38] is coming from the throne of god is that
[1:09:42] same grace and peace that is being
[1:09:44] brought by the seven spirits which are
[1:09:47] before the throne and those seven
[1:09:49] spirits are messengers of jesus christ
[1:09:53] and what do they do they bear the
[1:09:55] message of the covenant
[1:09:57] oh my god oh blessed be his name you see
[1:10:01] this is god's mercy
[1:10:03] oh my my
[1:10:05] my
[1:10:06] now when we when we recognize how john
[1:10:08] remember john heard a voice now don't
[1:10:11] now don't don't don't don't go to sleep
[1:10:13] on me john heard a voice and he said i
[1:10:16] turned around to hear the voice that was
[1:10:18] speaking to me he turned around to see
[1:10:21] it
[1:10:23] he heard it
[1:10:24] now he wanted to see it because he knows
[1:10:27] if i heard a voice then somebody is
[1:10:30] pressing speaking to me
[1:10:33] and when he turned around to see what he
[1:10:36] saw was the bible says in verse 13 in
[1:10:39] the midst of the seven candlesticks was
[1:10:42] one likened to the son of man notice one
[1:10:44] like unto the son of man clothed with a
[1:10:47] garment down to the foot and gird about
[1:10:49] the paps with the golden girl so it was
[1:10:52] not gird around down here within a
[1:10:54] priestly way but it was gird around the
[1:10:56] paps oh my what was it it was christ
[1:10:59] himself veiled in his bride
[1:11:03] is that right and what is it it's the
[1:11:05] power and glory of god that's over her
[1:11:08] life
[1:11:09] are you hearing me now because the power
[1:11:12] and the glory of god that is veiled over
[1:11:14] her life and you could look and say well
[1:11:16] why is it there about her perhaps
[1:11:18] because that's a sign of judgment
[1:11:20] remember when the word comes forth it is
[1:11:22] mercy but to spurn it and reject it it's
[1:11:26] judgment it's not judgment that's coming
[1:11:28] when you reject it you are judged right
[1:11:30] there that's why the prophet could say
[1:11:33] the mark of the beast is not coming it's
[1:11:35] already here when you turn down the
[1:11:38] gospel of jesus christ you are marked
[1:11:43] is that right
[1:11:44] so notice i turned around to see
[1:11:47] this voice so this voice
[1:11:49] would be would be visible before him and
[1:11:52] notice when i noticed in his right hand
[1:11:54] were seven stars and out of his mouth
[1:11:57] went sharp two-edged sword and his
[1:11:59] countenance was as the sun shineth in
[1:12:01] his strength and the mystery of the
[1:12:03] seven stars which thou sawest in my
[1:12:05] right hand now remember that right hand
[1:12:07] is that of power
[1:12:10] glory then in my right hand the seven
[1:12:12] stars are the angels of the seven
[1:12:15] churches
[1:12:16] now let me just pause and come back to
[1:12:18] that in a moment
[1:12:19] back in the old testament when we're
[1:12:21] talking about entering into fellowship
[1:12:23] because what i just read has a very key
[1:12:26] point but i want to go back and pick up
[1:12:27] some background on this which i i know
[1:12:29] we're familiar with
[1:12:31] but how it pertains and applies to our
[1:12:34] lives not just once but over and over
[1:12:37] again
[1:12:38] remember when when israel
[1:12:40] any time that that there in order for
[1:12:42] them to enter into fellowship they had
[1:12:45] to enter through the blood there was
[1:12:47] that of the red heifer that was taken
[1:12:50] and that red heifer was slain she was
[1:12:52] slaying there before eliezer or the
[1:12:54] priest and then she was burned and those
[1:12:56] those the you know the the ashes they
[1:12:58] were mixed with clean water and that
[1:13:00] type of faith what it was to be
[1:13:02] sprinkled in upon the worshiper a type
[1:13:05] of the preaching of the gospel it is the
[1:13:08] waters of separation you see how can a
[1:13:11] man know he's wrong unless there be a
[1:13:15] gospel to bring conviction to his life
[1:13:17] you see that's what the real gospel is
[1:13:20] it's the blood that is witnessed back
[1:13:22] there and the holy spirit is bringing
[1:13:24] conviction here what's he doing he's
[1:13:26] opening the way or revealing the way
[1:13:29] into
[1:13:30] fellowship is that right
[1:13:33] think about how brother branham would
[1:13:34] take it in the manner of how many were
[1:13:36] coming to him even in the time and and
[1:13:39] you know they remember the one man said
[1:13:41] you know i went to uh to to to the
[1:13:43] pentecostals and they said do this and i
[1:13:46] went to the lutherans and they said do
[1:13:47] this and this other one said i would
[1:13:49] when you get happy enough and he said
[1:13:50] brother brahma i i just want it so bad
[1:13:53] well remember they told that man you
[1:13:55] need to go see brother branham he's a
[1:13:57] prophet now think of this brother braham
[1:13:59] says you don't need a prophet brother he
[1:14:01] said you just need to get straightened
[1:14:03] out here at the beginning and what it
[1:14:05] was the man already had a genuine
[1:14:07] experience but you see when others came
[1:14:10] along they were tampering and trying to
[1:14:13] put things in the way that was not what
[1:14:15] god ordained it never brought stability
[1:14:19] in that man's life but when that man
[1:14:21] could stand right there before the word
[1:14:23] and the word could position him in the
[1:14:26] mystery of god that man jumped off that
[1:14:28] porch and said praise god i've had it
[1:14:31] this whole time
[1:14:33] why it was a reality that struck him in
[1:14:37] that moment what was it it was the
[1:14:39] mystery of god that was made known to
[1:14:41] him
[1:14:42] oh my and when it's made known like that
[1:14:45] brother you talking about fellowship
[1:14:48] you're talking about fellowship now
[1:14:51] think of this in in this time of how
[1:14:53] that the blood would be would be shed
[1:14:55] and that blood remember was to be taken
[1:14:58] and it was to be sprinkled seven times
[1:15:02] and there's different places even in the
[1:15:03] tabernacle of where that would take
[1:15:05] place even on the day of atonement but
[1:15:07] these these right here would be the
[1:15:09] sprinkling of the blood directly before
[1:15:11] the tabernacle of the congregation seven
[1:15:13] times that's out of numbers chapter 19.
[1:15:16] now god had made a way let me just refer
[1:15:18] to a few places he said god had made a
[1:15:21] way
[1:15:22] that that that a believer in his journey
[1:15:25] out of fellowship might have a way of
[1:15:27] approach again
[1:15:29] into fellowship
[1:15:32] now there's a lot that that we could say
[1:15:34] within that the key is
[1:15:36] for remaining in fellowship
[1:15:39] and god provided that way so that man
[1:15:42] could come back into fellowship you know
[1:15:44] think about it this is why brother
[1:15:46] brahma says church doesn't save you
[1:15:49] but he said church keeps you in
[1:15:52] fellowship
[1:15:53] well how does it not save me but it
[1:15:55] keeps me in fellowship because remember
[1:15:57] the preaching of the gospel is what
[1:16:00] brings conviction to a life the
[1:16:02] preaching of the gospel is what reveals
[1:16:04] the way into the holiest of holies with
[1:16:07] a real fellowship and so the preaching
[1:16:10] of the gospel is set forth to continue
[1:16:13] to minister to our needs when hindrances
[1:16:16] arise and when the flesh itself could
[1:16:19] start to get in the way the waters of
[1:16:21] separation what is it god's desire for
[1:16:25] fellowship oh my there's times that you
[1:16:27] can set and be so cold and you don't
[1:16:30] know what's going on in your life you're
[1:16:32] wondering what's happening where have i
[1:16:34] got off the way why don't i have the joy
[1:16:36] like i used to have let me tell you
[1:16:38] something you've got an access you don't
[1:16:40] have to dwell on it you can say father i
[1:16:43] desire that you would compress and lord
[1:16:45] and speak personally to my life why you
[1:16:48] have a privilege with the waters of
[1:16:51] separation and you're inviting the holy
[1:16:54] spirit to come down and deal with your
[1:16:56] life and if there's things that need to
[1:16:58] be made right things cleared out of the
[1:17:00] way there is grace that's present and a
[1:17:03] blood to see that it's taken care of
[1:17:06] oh my so the next thing
[1:17:08] where a person they would enter into the
[1:17:11] fellowship after coming into the courts
[1:17:14] with the believers on common ground you
[1:17:16] see common ground is what's under the
[1:17:18] blood
[1:17:19] when the bible says in the book of acts
[1:17:21] that they had all things in common
[1:17:23] it's not speaking that well we were just
[1:17:25] all you know on the same income level or
[1:17:27] we were all that's not what's speaking
[1:17:29] of they had all things in common in
[1:17:32] other words there was one vision one
[1:17:34] goal one mind and they were under one
[1:17:37] blood
[1:17:38] that's the common grounds that god has
[1:17:41] given for the believer that's where real
[1:17:43] fellowship takes place
[1:17:45] is that right
[1:17:46] someone who's not fully under the blood
[1:17:48] you can only fellowship so far with them
[1:17:50] right but thanks god for you know thanks
[1:17:53] be to god for the level that you're able
[1:17:54] to fellowship with them in pride and you
[1:17:56] look and say god help my life to be a
[1:17:58] light let it be salty let it be
[1:18:00] something that will encourage and cause
[1:18:02] a hunger to arise for that greater
[1:18:04] degree of fellowship
[1:18:07] is that right don't shame them don't
[1:18:09] shame them because well you know you're
[1:18:10] not where i'm at if you'd be doing this
[1:18:12] that will never remember the waters of
[1:18:14] separation is not a waters of shaming
[1:18:17] but the waters of separation is waters
[1:18:20] that bring conviction do you realize
[1:18:22] that conviction comes by the sweetness
[1:18:25] of the holy spirit through the preaching
[1:18:27] of the word paul said speaking the truth
[1:18:29] in love is that right and to think that
[1:18:31] even in how you live your life you can
[1:18:34] live your life with such sweetness and
[1:18:36] such power that god will absolutely
[1:18:39] thunder out of your life and there's
[1:18:41] conviction that'll strike hearts and
[1:18:43] lies that you won't even have to say a
[1:18:45] word to it why there's a voice behind
[1:18:48] your life that's crying out what is that
[1:18:51] voice i'm talking about it's the voice
[1:18:54] of the blood that speaks through your
[1:18:56] life
[1:18:57] oh my so the next thing is to enter into
[1:19:01] on common ground of fellowship and you
[1:19:03] see there was a public testimony of
[1:19:06] seven stripes of blood showing that
[1:19:08] death went before them to pay the weight
[1:19:11] so this blood was placed before them and
[1:19:15] that blood was there to identify that
[1:19:18] there's one who's already made away oh
[1:19:21] boy i wish i had time to really preach
[1:19:23] on this
[1:19:24] there is a blood you see what happens
[1:19:26] he's identifying that that blood would
[1:19:29] be placed before the worshiper those
[1:19:32] seven stripes which would represent
[1:19:35] seven gentile ages which would represent
[1:19:38] seven thousand years are you hearing me
[1:19:40] you're showing that it would be the
[1:19:42] blood when the blood is presented before
[1:19:46] it brings a realization oh my no matter
[1:19:49] what the person could think no matter
[1:19:51] what types of doubts uh thoughts of
[1:19:54] doubt and unbelief but if that blood can
[1:19:56] be presented before them oh my there's a
[1:19:59] spirit of the living god that'll bring
[1:20:02] faith within that heart and in that life
[1:20:04] to recognize that though i am unworthy
[1:20:07] but there is a worthy one that has made
[1:20:10] a way that i can come in to this place
[1:20:13] what do i have to do you must accept
[1:20:17] god's provided way
[1:20:19] oh glory be to god
[1:20:22] notice
[1:20:23] of how that a public testimony that's
[1:20:26] blood being with seven stripes was a
[1:20:28] public testimony to the blood and a
[1:20:31] public testimony it comes to life
[1:20:33] everyone would have to enter through
[1:20:35] every age through that blood and after
[1:20:38] the entering in through the blood they'd
[1:20:40] come into fellowship oh my that's the
[1:20:42] only grounds that that any believer can
[1:20:45] meet god on is in the blood
[1:20:49] they're not believing on it but in it
[1:20:53] to believe in it
[1:20:55] is to be born again
[1:20:58] to be a a partaker of that life because
[1:21:01] the blood was shed
[1:21:03] not only to put away your past sins but
[1:21:07] that blood was shed to make a way that
[1:21:10] you can come right back into the desire
[1:21:13] and the position of what god ordained
[1:21:15] you to be as a son and daughter of god
[1:21:18] the blood made a way for that the church
[1:21:20] didn't make a way for that the blood of
[1:21:23] jesus christ made a way for it the
[1:21:25] churches brought confusion the church
[1:21:28] has said do this the church said do this
[1:21:31] but god comes and the anointing of the
[1:21:33] holy ghost coming through his word upon
[1:21:36] his children reveals the pathway to life
[1:21:40] my my where would we be without the holy
[1:21:43] ghost
[1:21:44] that's why brother branham could sit
[1:21:45] there and frankly challenge and say we
[1:21:48] don't need to understand the greek and
[1:21:50] the hebrew he said what we need is the
[1:21:52] same holy ghost who gave the word to
[1:21:55] come and reveal it because he said it
[1:21:58] will take more than a student comparing
[1:22:00] verse to verse to open this book it
[1:22:03] takes an operation of the holy ghost
[1:22:06] oh my this is why when john would write
[1:22:10] in 1st john chapter 1 verse 3
[1:22:12] that which we have seen and heard
[1:22:14] declare we unto you that ye also may
[1:22:17] have fellowship with us
[1:22:20] and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:22:22] father and with his son jesus christ now
[1:22:25] notice what john is writing of that this
[1:22:27] fellowship is not about you coming and
[1:22:29] joining a church
[1:22:31] but this fellowship he's that the
[1:22:33] invitation is
[1:22:35] is this fellowship
[1:22:37] is the same desire
[1:22:39] of what took place when the morning
[1:22:40] stars shouted for joy
[1:22:42] this same fellowship is the same desire
[1:22:46] that what god had when he would stand
[1:22:48] there there in the body of the lord
[1:22:50] jesus and the prayer would be made the
[1:22:53] last request would desire our fellowship
[1:22:56] and our companionship that where i am
[1:22:59] they may be also you see that same thing
[1:23:02] that was being prayed for are you
[1:23:04] hearing me now it was radar the prayer
[1:23:07] was going out intercessory prayer it was
[1:23:09] radar announcing what is coming to the
[1:23:12] church in that hour and notice how this
[1:23:15] is being announced those that are
[1:23:17] recipients of that fellowship of the
[1:23:20] mystery of god the holy ghost now that
[1:23:23] prayer is going out for all them that
[1:23:25] are afar off as many as the lord our god
[1:23:29] shall call
[1:23:31] oh this fellowship is not something that
[1:23:33] looks at cutting people off you say well
[1:23:36] well this person just seems to go this
[1:23:38] way but remember what brings separation
[1:23:41] is the promise that you and i are
[1:23:43] holding the promise that we hold to is
[1:23:46] what leads to separation of others
[1:23:48] that's what led to abraham and lot being
[1:23:51] separated because abraham was not going
[1:23:53] to let go of that promise because that
[1:23:56] promise had a hold on his life oh my
[1:23:58] abraham didn't have a full hold on the
[1:24:01] promise but the promise had a hold of
[1:24:03] abraham before abraham ever knew about
[1:24:05] the promise no wonder paul could say i
[1:24:08] seek to apprehend that which i'm
[1:24:10] apprehended of oh my oh this glorious
[1:24:14] revelation that moves down and grips our
[1:24:17] life and causes us to pray and say lord
[1:24:20] be it unto me lord come lord jesus do
[1:24:23] the further work in my life
[1:24:27] how glorious
[1:24:30] oh my my mother
[1:24:32] notice and these things right we unto
[1:24:34] you that your joy may be full
[1:24:38] this then is the message
[1:24:40] so this is what the message really is
[1:24:43] which we have heard of him
[1:24:45] and declare unto you that god is light
[1:24:48] and in him is no darkness at all
[1:24:51] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:24:54] him
[1:24:55] and walk in darkness
[1:24:57] we lie
[1:24:58] and do not
[1:24:59] the truth
[1:25:01] so the testimony of fellowship
[1:25:04] will be that of light it will bear
[1:25:07] witness with the word of god and the
[1:25:09] light that god is given in that hour
[1:25:12] because the light of what is being
[1:25:14] emitted remember the light itself is
[1:25:17] that of the word that was god has wrote
[1:25:21] now become expressed that same word is
[1:25:24] the blood and it is the life to that
[1:25:27] hour
[1:25:28] are you hearing me now
[1:25:30] if we say we have fellowship with him
[1:25:33] and walk in darkness we lie and do not
[1:25:35] the truth but if we walk in the light as
[1:25:38] he is in the light
[1:25:40] we have fellowship one with another
[1:25:43] and the blood of jesus christ his son
[1:25:46] cleanseth us from all sin
[1:25:50] so this is the power of coming into the
[1:25:53] common grounds of fellowship under the
[1:25:56] blood of jesus christ not only do we
[1:25:59] have fellowship with one another and
[1:26:01] what really makes that fellowship is
[1:26:03] because of the fellowship of the mystery
[1:26:06] of god of the holy ghost among the
[1:26:09] believing children of god
[1:26:11] we we have there is a cleansing that has
[1:26:15] taken place in our life not just a
[1:26:16] removing of the past sin but god has
[1:26:19] come and dealt with the nature on the
[1:26:22] inside where it has led it to a place of
[1:26:25] complete death
[1:26:29] how long that takes for every person and
[1:26:31] every individual there's got to be a
[1:26:32] dying out
[1:26:35] are you with me
[1:26:36] because the holy ghost is not god coming
[1:26:39] down cleaning us up and moving on the
[1:26:40] inside
[1:26:42] come on now
[1:26:44] that be adultery
[1:26:46] because we still got a living husband
[1:26:48] see god's got to marry a virgin
[1:26:51] are you hearing me so how does that
[1:26:52] happen there's got to be a death to that
[1:26:55] old nature
[1:26:57] then the quickening power of god comes
[1:26:59] and rises and raises up that seed on the
[1:27:02] inside which is the virgin
[1:27:04] womb of almighty god a creation of the
[1:27:08] living god
[1:27:10] god can't marry somebody who's got a
[1:27:11] living husband
[1:27:13] and has already been married before but
[1:27:14] he marries a virgin
[1:27:16] are you hearing me now
[1:27:18] oh my that's the scriptures in the
[1:27:20] message now notice this
[1:27:22] notice the waters of separation when
[1:27:24] it's preached now brother if we could
[1:27:26] just kind of step back a little bit now
[1:27:28] notice when we're looking at this of
[1:27:30] these of the blood and of entering into
[1:27:32] fellowship brother branham would begin
[1:27:34] to talk about what he is seeing in that
[1:27:36] hour where there was ministry going on
[1:27:39] but it was only taking the people as far
[1:27:41] as the waters of separation
[1:27:44] in other words to recognize
[1:27:46] that they are a sinner
[1:27:48] and they need to accept the pro the
[1:27:51] perpetuation the provision that jesus
[1:27:54] christ has made for them and to repent
[1:27:56] of their sins that's what the waters of
[1:27:58] separation will do
[1:28:01] is that right
[1:28:02] but then brother branham would go on to
[1:28:03] identify he said but they've got to be
[1:28:06] taken on into the fellowship of the holy
[1:28:09] spirit because you see the preaching the
[1:28:11] waters of separation is necessary it's a
[1:28:15] necessary uh
[1:28:17] entrance but it is not the fellowship of
[1:28:21] the holy spirit so that fellowship of
[1:28:23] the holy spirit it is that which becomes
[1:28:26] a real relationship
[1:28:28] brother brown would say like this
[1:28:29] relationship he's born again he's a new
[1:28:32] creature in christ he come through the
[1:28:34] waters of separation well what if
[1:28:36] somebody what if it would be you and you
[1:28:38] heard the preaching of the gospel and
[1:28:40] you said i don't need to do that to be a
[1:28:42] christian then then you not even come
[1:28:44] into the waters of separation because
[1:28:47] the waters of separation it's what's
[1:28:49] there to cleanse you and to change your
[1:28:52] thinking
[1:28:53] are you hearing me because our thinking
[1:28:55] was evil we wouldn't even give it a time
[1:28:58] of day something were to come and you
[1:29:00] know they hear the word as it's speaking
[1:29:02] well that's just a little too tight i
[1:29:04] don't think that needs to be that way
[1:29:06] you see but the waters of separation is
[1:29:08] a preparation that god has made that you
[1:29:11] and i can not only be convicted of our
[1:29:14] sin but that we can move into a place to
[1:29:17] where we can actually begin to see the
[1:29:20] blood before us to enter into that place
[1:29:25] now think of this and you know in many
[1:29:27] of the cases now i want you understand
[1:29:29] this then when we think of this in this
[1:29:31] hour we're living in in revelations
[1:29:32] chapter 10 the bible says that mighty
[1:29:34] angel descended with a little book open
[1:29:37] in his hand now the little book you know
[1:29:39] it's this book but the little book
[1:29:41] speaking of this message is for
[1:29:45] that of the lamb's book of life you see
[1:29:48] every message through the seven church
[1:29:50] ages he that hath an ear it would be
[1:29:53] speaking to the messenger of that age
[1:29:56] but there were ordained children of god
[1:29:59] that would hear that word in that hour
[1:30:02] and come under the blood is that right
[1:30:05] but because of the fall that took place
[1:30:08] in eden then there are many names
[1:30:10] there's a book of life which is just
[1:30:13] another section is that right but the
[1:30:15] lamb's book of life that's there that
[1:30:17] speaks of the bride of jesus christ a
[1:30:20] body that's been made up but since the
[1:30:23] fall had come there's many that live
[1:30:25] upon the earth that would have never
[1:30:27] lived on the earth had there not been a
[1:30:29] fall come is that right and the bible we
[1:30:32] could read i don't have time to read it
[1:30:33] but you know the scriptures in john
[1:30:35] chapter 3 whosoever believeth on him
[1:30:37] that he might be saved you see it's not
[1:30:40] a guarantee but those that believe on
[1:30:43] him not in him on him might be saved you
[1:30:47] see god has placed it in a way that even
[1:30:49] those that are not elect that they can
[1:30:52] be saved not part of the bride but be
[1:30:55] saved is that right but you see to the
[1:30:58] bride of jesus christ uh you know
[1:31:00] friends i'm not lifting people up i'm
[1:31:02] lifting this word up and this word is
[1:31:05] flesh in the bride of jesus christ you
[1:31:07] see it is not just to believe on him but
[1:31:10] god promised the seal of the holy ghost
[1:31:14] that there would come a security in the
[1:31:16] lives of the believer to where they're
[1:31:18] not wandering and they're up and they're
[1:31:20] down but they have a confidence so they
[1:31:23] can fellowship with the mystery of god
[1:31:28] oh hallelujah
[1:31:30] oh my think of it like this we walk
[1:31:33] through the blood of sanctification so
[1:31:36] there's many that can be in the outer
[1:31:38] courts
[1:31:40] they're in the outer courts
[1:31:44] even friends listen even around our
[1:31:46] message
[1:31:47] because you have to enter in first of
[1:31:49] all through the outer court you see you
[1:31:51] don't enter in
[1:31:53] any other way you don't skip the outer
[1:31:54] court
[1:31:55] and go straight to the third court but
[1:31:58] remember jesus said i am the
[1:32:01] door
[1:32:02] to the sheepfold
[1:32:04] right
[1:32:06] no man coming to the father but by
[1:32:08] me
[1:32:10] so though there's a door of an entrance
[1:32:13] that we enter in and remember as we said
[1:32:15] i don't know a few services ago when you
[1:32:17] enter through that door if you can you
[1:32:18] know in your mind picture that
[1:32:20] tabernacle picture i had up here when a
[1:32:22] man enters through that door on the
[1:32:24] eastern side he's pointed there and he's
[1:32:26] pointed toward the west
[1:32:28] is that right because remember there was
[1:32:30] blood sprinkled eastward
[1:32:34] oh hallelujah
[1:32:36] gloria
[1:32:38] let's just preach here for a moment i
[1:32:39] know i can't get going on that but
[1:32:41] you're pointed in the right direction is
[1:32:44] that right how many times they can sit
[1:32:46] down with somebody and what little
[1:32:47] notice even what the message of the hour
[1:32:50] has come to do is to point us in the
[1:32:53] right direction
[1:32:54] and to encourage us into that place of
[1:32:57] life because many were calling that of
[1:33:00] the outer court the place of life or
[1:33:02] calling the holy place the place of life
[1:33:05] but the only place of life is what is
[1:33:08] there in the holiest of holies in the
[1:33:10] bedroom
[1:33:13] is that all right it's a fellowship you
[1:33:15] see god provided that way let me just
[1:33:18] let me just read this here you can read
[1:33:20] hebrews 10 when you get home hebrews 10
[1:33:22] 19 through 22 when you get home because
[1:33:25] god has an objective through that new
[1:33:27] and living way he's provided for us that
[1:33:29] we might enter with a true heart full
[1:33:31] assurance of faith our hearts are
[1:33:33] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:33:35] our bodies are washed with pure water
[1:33:37] notice to enter into this full
[1:33:39] fellowship the first thing is the
[1:33:41] kitchen
[1:33:45] when you enter into the kitchen that's
[1:33:47] through hearing the word as we've been
[1:33:49] saying you hear the word
[1:33:51] and the word begins to bring conviction
[1:33:53] to your heart in your life and you open
[1:33:55] up to accept christ as your personal
[1:33:58] savior and you begin to feast on the
[1:33:59] word and enjoy it
[1:34:01] he said but after you've accepted him
[1:34:04] and you've been separated what those
[1:34:05] waters of separation does is it
[1:34:08] separates you from your evil thinking
[1:34:11] then the next thing is where you come
[1:34:13] into the living room so from the kitchen
[1:34:16] to the living room
[1:34:18] now notice how brother brand puts this
[1:34:20] in the living room he says this is where
[1:34:22] you take the little bride
[1:34:24] she takes her veil off you're coming a
[1:34:26] little closer then when you do that you
[1:34:29] put your arms around her you embrace her
[1:34:31] and that's how it comes into the
[1:34:33] fellowship of the lord jesus now notice
[1:34:35] what he's saying that that of the holy
[1:34:37] place or the living room or he'll call
[1:34:40] it the parlor where the veil you know
[1:34:42] the bride takes her veil off you say
[1:34:44] what is she doing taking her veil up in
[1:34:46] other words things that she's holding up
[1:34:48] she just she just you know taking the
[1:34:51] veil off
[1:34:55] right i mean when i went in security
[1:34:57] checkpoints and stuff when i've been
[1:34:58] flying you know i could walk up there
[1:35:00] you know when you'd go in to the uh into
[1:35:03] the airport but i had to do this
[1:35:06] you know why because i had to see my
[1:35:07] face
[1:35:08] make sure that it matches what's right
[1:35:10] here on your id where your name is on it
[1:35:13] and your tickets right there right
[1:35:15] you see god doesn't take the veils down
[1:35:19] we've got to take the veils down
[1:35:21] anything that's between him and us
[1:35:23] that's what the living room's for to let
[1:35:26] all letting the veils come down
[1:35:30] how do the veils come down through his
[1:35:32] embrace
[1:35:34] he begins to embrace us well we could
[1:35:36] really preach some family services right
[1:35:38] here couldn't we
[1:35:39] jesus just does not take us and take us
[1:35:42] straight from the outer court into the
[1:35:44] holiest of holies
[1:35:46] you see there is a natural progression
[1:35:48] to divine fellowship
[1:35:51] we see it clear back in genesis 1 we see
[1:35:53] it right here there is a natural
[1:35:56] progression to fellowship jesus moves no
[1:35:59] notice his desire remember as the
[1:36:01] prophet said his desire for fellowship
[1:36:04] is greater than ours but he knows in
[1:36:06] order for that fellowship to come we and
[1:36:09] ourselves must be brought into that
[1:36:11] atmosphere a full surrender are you
[1:36:14] hearing me now it is not something
[1:36:16] that's just turned on with a switch but
[1:36:18] his atmosphere and his presence it
[1:36:21] creates an atmosphere of surrender where
[1:36:24] the veils of the day the veils of life
[1:36:27] all those veils begin to drop all around
[1:36:29] us and excuses and and reason all the
[1:36:32] same faceless begins to drop right
[1:36:35] around us why we are in the presence of
[1:36:38] the love of god that's working on our
[1:36:40] life and love is having a way it's
[1:36:43] working in our life there's things
[1:36:45] that's being cut away things that's
[1:36:47] being removed
[1:36:52] then the next notice this embrace
[1:36:55] and he says this embrace notice what
[1:36:57] this embrace does give me a little bit
[1:36:58] more in his monitors please you embrace
[1:37:01] the written word i want you to what this
[1:37:02] is in the holy place now veil's coming
[1:37:04] down you embrace the lord's gospel you
[1:37:07] embrace the written word you believe it
[1:37:10] with all your heart
[1:37:11] you see for a person wanting to enter
[1:37:13] into fellowship
[1:37:15] you can't get there without embracing
[1:37:16] the written word
[1:37:20] you see that and that's something just
[1:37:22] turn it down just a tiny little bit
[1:37:24] you you can't look even in our daily
[1:37:26] walk with god
[1:37:29] what i'm preaching of here
[1:37:31] it's something when you can invite the
[1:37:33] holy spirit to apply it personally in
[1:37:36] your lives
[1:37:37] in a daily basis
[1:37:39] because you can't enter into fellowship
[1:37:42] listen friends every one of us know if
[1:37:44] you're if you are not staying in step
[1:37:46] with god
[1:37:47] i can tell you right now it's hard to
[1:37:49] enter into fellowship it's hard to be
[1:37:51] available
[1:37:53] come on the cares of life and everything
[1:37:55] else we're not making excuses but we're
[1:37:57] trying to identify by the waters of
[1:37:59] separation that these things just don't
[1:38:02] well you know i believe the message i'm
[1:38:03] a part of it you know and i used to have
[1:38:05] this in my life i don't have this in my
[1:38:06] life no you were created for fellowship
[1:38:09] with god
[1:38:11] not just to come to church not just to
[1:38:14] be associated around where the mystery's
[1:38:16] being preached but you are ordained to
[1:38:19] have fellowship with the mystery of god
[1:38:24] to embrace notice to embrace the lord's
[1:38:26] gospel
[1:38:28] god it doesn't matter what you want me
[1:38:31] to do
[1:38:32] whatever you have planned in my life
[1:38:35] i'm ready now to receive it
[1:38:38] that's
[1:38:39] the living room
[1:38:41] but then inside
[1:38:43] the bedroom he says that's where
[1:38:45] you must go in order to have
[1:38:47] complete fellowship because that's
[1:38:49] that's becoming into relationship
[1:38:52] and he speaks of how he says
[1:38:54] too many are ashamed
[1:38:56] to go into that complete relationship
[1:38:58] with god
[1:38:59] to new life and new birth
[1:39:01] but once you go in there then all the
[1:39:03] shameness and backwardness and
[1:39:05] everything's gone
[1:39:07] he said you you said whereas before
[1:39:10] he said when you come into that place it
[1:39:12] don't matter if the president of the
[1:39:14] united states
[1:39:16] is standing right there
[1:39:19] you'll shout the glory of god
[1:39:22] it doesn't matter if it's your boss it
[1:39:23] don't matter who it is
[1:39:25] you are in fellowship with god
[1:39:28] see as he's placing it it's not just
[1:39:30] something at church not just something
[1:39:31] on a midweek service not just something
[1:39:33] in your prayer closet but it is every
[1:39:36] day of your life you have a fellowship
[1:39:38] with god how about that little german
[1:39:41] that went to a meeting here he is back
[1:39:42] in the butcher shop and every once in a
[1:39:44] while glory to god and he would raise up
[1:39:47] speaking in tongues and everything and
[1:39:48] they had honey what's wrong with you oh
[1:39:51] you know he began to speak about what
[1:39:53] had taken place and and you don't mean
[1:39:55] to tell me you went down there among a
[1:39:56] bunch of them nuts do you oh yes glory
[1:39:59] to god thank you thank the lord for the
[1:40:02] nuts he said because if there wasn't no
[1:40:04] nuts what would hold this world together
[1:40:06] you see there was a fellowship that he
[1:40:08] had he was just like that old man that
[1:40:11] the that his daughter put him up in the
[1:40:12] attic you know she said i ain't gonna
[1:40:14] let you have a bible i ain't gonna let
[1:40:16] you have nothing because i gotta have my
[1:40:18] friends over and i don't want you
[1:40:20] embarrassing me in front of my friends
[1:40:23] but she put him up there and you see a
[1:40:26] man that's got fellowship with god he
[1:40:28] don't need just a bible to see god he
[1:40:31] can see god in nature he can see god all
[1:40:33] around why there's a fellowship and he
[1:40:36] can recognize his creator boy he got to
[1:40:39] read that geography book and where it
[1:40:41] said there's places in the sea they
[1:40:44] can't even find the bottom of it oh he
[1:40:46] got the shouting when he thought about
[1:40:48] he put my sin in the sea of god's
[1:40:51] forgetfulness what is it it's a
[1:40:53] fellowship of the mystery of god
[1:40:57] and he was so full of joy
[1:41:01] oh glory be to god let's stand
[1:41:12] i tell you this is a
[1:41:14] this is a moment
[1:41:16] and it's a time and i'll just say it in
[1:41:18] this way i
[1:41:19] they can't get to where we were going to
[1:41:21] trying to get to tonight but you
[1:41:23] you get to you get the point
[1:41:26] the ram tells us like this with this
[1:41:29] the blood placed before us
[1:41:33] you see
[1:41:36] the gospel
[1:41:38] it doesn't come
[1:41:39] to condemn us
[1:41:42] the voice
[1:41:44] of condemnation is if you allow
[1:41:47] satan to remain there
[1:41:49] and to hold you back
[1:41:52] if you allow him
[1:41:54] it'll be condemnation
[1:41:57] see the spirit of god comes to bring
[1:42:00] liberty
[1:42:02] now you see
[1:42:04] god comes and he deals with our life to
[1:42:07] enter into fellowship
[1:42:08] now i want you to think of this of
[1:42:11] entering in fully into the holy ghost
[1:42:15] and i want you to think about this
[1:42:17] of remaining in that fellowship
[1:42:20] and effectual
[1:42:22] as a believer as well
[1:42:24] and allow the holy spirit just to
[1:42:26] apply this to our life because we we all
[1:42:28] realize right here
[1:42:30] even though i heard brother brian
[1:42:31] praying in the prayer request
[1:42:34] i want to grow into that stature
[1:42:37] of a perfect man
[1:42:40] we're here in that hour as brother
[1:42:42] branham would identify
[1:42:44] because we have not added these virtues
[1:42:46] to our lives
[1:42:48] brother braham identifies he says
[1:42:51] he starts with a born-again experience
[1:42:54] in god
[1:42:55] is that right
[1:42:57] that's a foundation that no other man
[1:42:59] can lay
[1:43:01] brother brandon would identify that and
[1:43:03] he would say it's not man adding it
[1:43:06] he said because if a man does it he said
[1:43:07] it's like
[1:43:08] a black bird trying to add peacock
[1:43:10] feathers
[1:43:12] but if you look at every one of those
[1:43:14] virtues and that coming out in our life
[1:43:17] those are not if i can say in this way
[1:43:19] maybe god would help me to be make it
[1:43:21] simple enough those are not things that
[1:43:23] we just sit around like we are in a lawn
[1:43:25] chair taking in the sun and drinking
[1:43:27] sweet tea and
[1:43:29] patience oh boy i just feel patience
[1:43:31] flowing out of my life
[1:43:32] i just feel faith flowing out of my life
[1:43:35] i just feel brotherly kind no no no
[1:43:38] remember
[1:43:39] jeremiah
[1:43:41] 7 i believe psalms 1 1
[1:43:44] in the times
[1:43:45] of dryness around here
[1:43:48] of adversity of test
[1:43:51] and of trials
[1:43:52] that's where faith
[1:43:54] will really declare itself
[1:43:57] patience
[1:43:58] when you're praying for something in
[1:44:00] god's word
[1:44:02] you don't see any evidence of it
[1:44:05] but there's patience
[1:44:06] patience is what comes by the in
[1:44:09] outworking of the holy spirit to know
[1:44:11] god said it
[1:44:14] maybe nothing wrong with god or wrong
[1:44:16] with his word but maybe i'm not in line
[1:44:18] with where i need to be in my thinking
[1:44:19] about it
[1:44:21] what is it in the midst of that time
[1:44:22] patience
[1:44:24] that's why james could say let patience
[1:44:26] have
[1:44:27] her
[1:44:29] perfect work
[1:44:32] on and on we could go
[1:44:35] we want to we want to grow
[1:44:37] more
[1:44:39] and more into that statue of christ
[1:44:41] now remember god has given us the
[1:44:42] vitamins in this hour
[1:44:44] he's given us the vitamins that we need
[1:44:47] in this hour
[1:44:48] to be victorious to be overcomers and
[1:44:51] mature
[1:44:52] how many of you here brother branham on
[1:44:54] tape say
[1:44:55] he said where he said we're hearing the
[1:44:56] message
[1:44:57] he said i believe we're hearing it
[1:44:58] intellectually
[1:45:00] he said but we need to lay in the
[1:45:02] presence of the sun
[1:45:04] and ripen
[1:45:06] you say oh brother samuel i'm going to
[1:45:08] pray for all those people that are
[1:45:09] hearing it intellectually know all of us
[1:45:12] because you see first of all the word
[1:45:14] must be received in the channel of our
[1:45:17] mind
[1:45:18] god makes us aware of these things and
[1:45:20] we things think about it things that you
[1:45:22] and i have looked at in past years and
[1:45:25] past times and now it's standing out
[1:45:27] real clear before us
[1:45:29] it's god's grace even in this hour even
[1:45:32] in in working in our life in his
[1:45:34] overcoming power what is that it's the
[1:45:36] spirit of god personally in communion
[1:45:39] with him as husband and wife and we are
[1:45:42] praying for those things
[1:45:44] that he is making known to us that are
[1:45:46] beneficiary
[1:45:48] to his kingdom
[1:45:50] and we're part of his kingdom
[1:45:53] listen you're not praying about this
[1:45:55] need no you pray about natural needs
[1:45:57] david said i've never seen
[1:45:59] a child of god have to beg for bread we
[1:46:01] do pray for those natural things but we
[1:46:04] never put those natural things ahead of
[1:46:06] the kingdom of god
[1:46:08] seek ye first the kingdom of god that's
[1:46:11] how our prayers should be if our prayers
[1:46:13] are more on the natural and material
[1:46:16] things of life then we've got the wrong
[1:46:18] order but if we're praying lord for the
[1:46:21] kingdom of god first lord keep me in the
[1:46:23] center of your will lord keep me lord in
[1:46:25] step with you lord help me if there's
[1:46:27] anything that allowed the creep in my
[1:46:29] life if there's amnesia if there's
[1:46:31] things about me lord that's come around
[1:46:33] lord help me lord help me to see it lord
[1:46:36] god i want to walk so fully and pleasing
[1:46:38] and writing step i want to see the word
[1:46:41] lord god moving in my life a maturing
[1:46:43] taking place that's seeking the kingdom
[1:46:46] of god first
[1:46:48] not that we don't pray about other
[1:46:49] things but there's a lot out there that
[1:46:52] pray about a lot of other things too and
[1:46:54] they've got needs and god hears them but
[1:46:56] god is making known to you and i the
[1:46:59] mysteries concerning this fellowship of
[1:47:03] the things that we're to pray for
[1:47:06] what access that we have lot could not
[1:47:08] pray for his own deliverance because he
[1:47:10] didn't know that
[1:47:13] but abraham
[1:47:15] shall i hide from abraham that thing
[1:47:17] which i do
[1:47:20] abraham was able to pray for it
[1:47:23] daniel
[1:47:24] it was nobody else in the kingdom but
[1:47:26] daniel it was revealed to him that here
[1:47:29] is 68 years in 70 years this is how it's
[1:47:33] going to be but when that revelation
[1:47:35] that 68 years if i can say that third
[1:47:38] pool was revealed to daniel he began to
[1:47:41] pray and seek for the coming deliverance
[1:47:44] why it was revealed to him
[1:47:47] daniel wasn't just praying god put food
[1:47:49] on the table in babylon god put shoes on
[1:47:52] my feet in babylon no daniel recognized
[1:47:55] he understood by the books this is the
[1:47:58] time to be praying for deliverance
[1:48:02] that's communion
[1:48:04] with god
[1:48:06] and we want to grow
[1:48:09] we want to grow
[1:48:11] and this is why we need the word
[1:48:13] the preaching of the word of god the
[1:48:15] ministering of the word it keeps us in
[1:48:18] fellowship
[1:48:20] with him
[1:48:26] it cleanses
[1:48:28] he cleanses
[1:48:31] think of this let me just read this and
[1:48:32] i am closing here
[1:48:35] he said now before you enter into that
[1:48:37] place
[1:48:38] there's a blood veil hanging there for
[1:48:40] the cleansing
[1:48:42] you must recognize that blood as an
[1:48:43] innocent substitute
[1:48:46] through the preaching of the word
[1:48:48] brought down the veil of the blood
[1:48:52] see the preaching of the word brings the
[1:48:54] veil
[1:48:55] of the blood on display
[1:48:58] it burning what is who who is that blood
[1:49:00] it's jesus christ himself coming present
[1:49:04] in the meeting
[1:49:06] paul said i i never established you on
[1:49:08] the entire words of man wisdom but in
[1:49:10] the your faith would be established in
[1:49:12] the power of god the veil of blood has
[1:49:15] been brought before us
[1:49:17] by the preaching of the gospel
[1:49:20] and in there you'll see that someone has
[1:49:22] died
[1:49:23] in your place
[1:49:24] then you'll throw down all your earthly
[1:49:26] possessions all your faing dangle ideas
[1:49:29] all your dancing your immoral living and
[1:49:31] all the things that you've fought up in
[1:49:33] your own self and you go to church your
[1:49:35] new rules your new commandments your
[1:49:36] non-mediating and all these things
[1:49:38] you'll lay it aside
[1:49:42] and plunge holy into the blood and say
[1:49:45] lord
[1:49:46] wash me
[1:49:48] and cleanse me
[1:49:49] [Music]
[1:49:51] see that's that's
[1:49:54] that's that
[1:49:55] precious opportunity that we have
[1:49:58] through the washing of water
[1:50:00] by the word
[1:50:03] as we bow our heads in a word of prayer
[1:50:06] to understand it in this way
[1:50:08] there's things that no doubt that
[1:50:10] for some of you that's prayed about god
[1:50:12] i want to see a real move in my life
[1:50:15] but remember in order for god to move
[1:50:18] you've got to move upon his word
[1:50:21] your heart is moved
[1:50:24] but when your heart is moved there's got
[1:50:26] to be something that moves you
[1:50:28] within that that heart being moved to
[1:50:29] say yes lord that is me not because god
[1:50:32] won't come over top of that
[1:50:34] but if you'll just move upon that
[1:50:36] as he's dealing with your life as he's
[1:50:39] speaking to your heart and you'll just
[1:50:40] invite him right down that channel right
[1:50:43] now
[1:50:44] he'll come
[1:50:45] [Music]
[1:50:47] he'll come
[1:50:49] if it's something that you've got to get
[1:50:51] cleared out of the way if it's
[1:50:52] condemnation if it's something in your
[1:50:53] life if it's something that's lacking
[1:50:55] when you say brother samuel i need to
[1:50:57] get back into fellowship with god then
[1:50:59] right now is the best time to do it
[1:51:03] right now is the best time to do it if
[1:51:06] there's things that need to be removed
[1:51:07] away from your life don't wait to
[1:51:08] another day don't wait to another time
[1:51:11] you might say brother samuel these are
[1:51:12] things that i've got here at home but
[1:51:15] maybe there you've come into the living
[1:51:17] room
[1:51:18] and you're in the time of embrace
[1:51:21] are you letting the word embrace you
[1:51:25] brother samuel i no longer i no longer

[1:51:29] know i know but are you letting the word
[1:51:31] embrace your life
[1:51:35] because when the word embraces your life
[1:51:37] then then
[1:51:38] it brings you to a place to say lord
[1:51:41] what you desire for me lord
[1:51:43] that's what i want
[1:51:45] i want to line up fully with your word
[1:51:47] and then it comes the entering into

[1:51:53] fellowship takes place
[1:51:55] and it's his life
[1:51:58] that was in the blood
[1:52:00] that comes inside of you
[1:52:03] and it produces it brings forth the son
[1:52:06] and daughter of god
[1:52:08] the blood
[1:52:10] of jesus christ that's the grounds of

[1:52:21] that you just like to let it be known by
[1:52:24] an uplifted hand lord god
