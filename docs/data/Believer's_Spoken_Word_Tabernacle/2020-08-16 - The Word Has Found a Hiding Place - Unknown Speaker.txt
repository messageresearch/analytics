cast them on [Music] oh [Music] let's just go to him in a word of prayer heavenly father we are a very needy people lord we need you every moment of our life lord your god the longer that we serve you the more we distrust our own abilities the more that we recognize and realize the lord we need you lord in every aspect of our life every decision we don't want to make anything in haste we don't want to do anything lord god that would be displeasing to you so i pray that you'd help us lord even as we're gathered together here this morning help us to be sensitive lord to your spirit if there's any callousness lord that slipped in your god we're asking lord that you would come by your spirit and dissolve any of that callousness lord because truly lord within any heart or any life there's no desire for that callousness but lord we want lord god that sweetness and that tenderness of your leadership so father we just asked lord this morning that lord is the needs that are gathered here those that are gathered lord streaming those who are archived this service dear god we're asking that lord you would help us to yield to that law of life that's within us and then you will take us lord god to whatever the need is lord that's being called for lord from our life lord if it's for the holy ghost you'll take us to the holy ghost lord if it's for lord healing of the body you'll take us lord to healing of the body lord jesus you're mindful of every need and we just ask the lord that you would just take control now speak to our hearts lord speak to our lives in a real personal way we love you and we thank you now father in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you this morning so good to be in the house of the lord amen we want to just invite you to the word of the lord to um jeremiah chapter 38 and it's raining real good outside yeah i say good too i'm tired of seeing brown grass and got a few little bit of some green here and there and and uh i'm grateful for the rain and so um just want to mention to you as you're turning there i ask you just something to keep in prayer here um i just had been texting with brother roel soriano and there is a need and i mentioned that we'd go ahead and take care of a need for a church there in palauan i had met the pastor there last year they actually had to um where they were gathering on a piece of property and you know a lot of those times brother keener you're aware of a lot of those things like that over and there that it's just you you somewhat we call it leasing a piece of property but it's really not leasing over there and then the landlord comes in and finally just says you got to move the church so here was their church they picked it up and walked it down the street so when they walked that church down the street they they found a little place that where they could put as far as like the um the you know the bamboo shoots and where they were holding it and um they took it down there but then the brothers then had to start building um the the footers i guess we would call it to where those could actually sit so that the waters would not come in on the people so um brother roell i i said you know we'll we'll we'll stand behind that because they the government has allowed those brothers to work they can't have service but they're allowed them to work there on the place so the brothers have just been adamantly working and i want you to keep in prayer that and also that just pray and what god would lay on your heart [Music] let's say you know maybe from next weekend and to the next in the final weekend and by the first part of september i'd like to be able to send an offering uh also uh to brother o'ell they've got they've been doing all they can to try to um provide food for different believers that haven't been able to work right out of their local church so i know that we'll try to take care of that and try to help in what we can knowing god can multiply the need amen so let's just look to the lord for that would you do that would you be in prayer so let's just let's just be in prayer for that right there um jeremiah 38 verse 7. boy these names always get me but i'm going to try it anyhow now when ebedmaleck the ethiopian one of the eunuchs which was in the king's house heard that they had put jeremiah in the dungeon the king then sitting in the gate of benjamin ibed malek went forth out of the king's house and spake to the king saying my lord the king these men have done evil in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the dungeon and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is for there's no more bread in the city then the king command commanded uh ebed malec the ethiopians saying take from hence 30 men with thee and take up jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he die now in verse verse 11 i want you to notice something as we start to read this i want you to notice the care that is given to raise the prophet up so ibed malek took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took fence old cast clots and old rotten rags isn't it something the prophet's going to be raised by old rotten rags god didn't want new rags god just takes old rags runs them through a process and places his image on it god takes rags that the rest of the world said they're good for nothing god said they'll allow me to be raised in this generation hallelujah he took fence old cast clots and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to jeremiah and a bed melech the ethiopians said unto jeremiah put now these old clots and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords jeremiah did so so they drew up jeremiah with cords and took him out of the dungeon and jeremiah remained in the court of the prison may god bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated i want to just begin to speak to you here just a little bit this morning the word has found a hiding place now in the background of this reading of scripture you're aware that jeremiah a prophet of god and he has been ordained by god to take the word of the lord and to announce to israel that judgment is coming there were men as you read through this on jeremiah there were other prophets who rose up very anointed men saying wonderful things but the reality of it is is they did not have the word of the lord they were wanting to in every one of us every person wants peace and safety but there is no place of peace and safety outside of jesus christ every other place is like quicksand it gives way in the midst of a storm there's only one place that safety that where you can stand and weather the storms and that's to be founded on the rock of jesus christ to where your life is anchored you the storms will come but there's an anchor within your life there the background when we look at this here you find that zedekiah the king uh jeremiah has has spoke by the word of the lord he would seem so contrary to the mind for a man to stay and say uh to israel turn yourself over jeremiah was given by god to tell the people turn yourself over to nebuchadnezzar go out to him and your lives shall be spared you're not going to be able to stay here in this land you see he gets to a spot to where in instead of where the the the people heeding the word of god coming according to god's pathway they they want to remain in their condition and we find this in the nation you you let things start to happen and people will start to get religious they'll get religious for a little time they'll start praying and start reading their bible and start doing all this let me just say this very clearly that in itself without really coming with a real heart to seek the refuge is only idolatry because it it does not release a real anchor and a holding power it's only something to appease the emotion of the individual something more or less like an anesthetic to try to calm them uh from the nervous prostrations but to recognize that here when jeremiah was there think of it hananiah saying peace and safety and everything else and jeremiah said you know what hannah and i how would to god it was like you were saying but jeremiah was inspired by god god was bringing judgment but listen to me now when god brings judgment before judgment ever comes god makes a way of escape amen it's a way of mercy and this this is the reality when jeremiah was standing there he was a sign from god that judgment was on the road but also to the believer where others could look and say oh all this is is doom and gloom and this is why they put jeremiah in the dungeon and the king zedekiah gave them permission put him in the dungeon because the rest of them said we're tired of hearing this this man listen to me closely this man speaks words of treason against the nation of israel but what they failed to recognize was that he looked like he was speaking treason but what he was trying to do he was he was speaking the word and the door of mercy was quickly closing in upon the people these people had the law they had the temple they had they had all of these they had everything they had everything that you could think of but yet god was not with them god doesn't dwell in religion amen religion is of man god don't dwell in religion but god dwells in hearts lives that he has called that he has separated that he has cleaned up for himself because we are his workmanship thank you father what a what a time when here men had cast jeremiah into the dungeon get him out of sight do away with him let me just say very clearly you might try to get the word and the voice of god away from your life but it doesn't kill it it's still there it's either reality even let the word come in and the voice come into your life or it'll meet you at the judgment the voice right even here this morning you either come and let that voice have the right away or this same voice will stand against you at the judgment you heard it but you rejected it it's up to you either put it in the dungeon or say let's raise it out of the dungeon amen let's lift him up either put him away or lift him up yes think of this this was not a jew that lifted him up it was a gentile look how god hiding this in here it was a gentile abomination the ethiopian hallelujah remember it was an ethiopian that that journey there remember here was the queen of sheba she journeyed from where she was went through bandits because she heard god is moving through a vessel in israel you know what she come to see she come to seek god and god was made visible through solomon amen hallelujah she came there was a yearning there was a drawing there wasn't enough priest or excuses or anybody else in her land that could stop her she had heard and faith come about hearing and she went ready ready she went ready to support and get behind if she saw indeed that this was true she was going to give her all what a time i say it's a parallel time right now i say i want to be that a bad man-like i want to be that of badminton you see the bible says in hebrews 1 1 god who at sun-dried times and divers manners spake in times past unto the fathers by or the correct in the prophets half in these last days talking about these last 2000 years since the outpouring of the holy ghost spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed air of all things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding all things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins oh glory set down on the right hand of the majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they brother uh comes into this prayer in the message the way of a true prophet that he preaches in arizona heavenly father he said speak again roar forth lord with the holy ghost he is the prophet of the hour he's the prophet of the day trying to find his way into the hearts of men and women that he could speak truth notice trying to find his way into the hearts of men and women that he could speak truth remember the holy ghost is the spirit of truth amen amen and he speaks truth through your life i'm so glad he's finding something i pray heavenly father that he will find many in here tonight then he can use someone that's ready to be reverent when they hear the roar of the almighty god go forth by his word judgment is at hand when a lion roars he's coming forth every creature knows he better hide because a king is walking forward god we only have one safety zone when the king of kings roars that's the blood of jesus christ you catch that when the king roars that's the blood of jesus christ let me just tell you something the blood of jesus christ is not diluted like many of the preachers have wanted to make it amen they have made it diluted to where it's just a membership just confess this just just do this little ritual just do this but the blood of jesus christ it came to settle the debt and to deal with that sin nature on the inside i don't care how good you think you are you can never meet god on your goodness the only way you can meet god is through the shed blood of the lamb religious rituals will never do it you've got to know him as the personal god in your life that has changed your life [Music] hallelujah amen it might seem like i'm excited it might seem like i'm rough but if you could only catch it right now i'm letting down old clots i'm letting down old rags it's reference to the word reference to the living god that brings him on the scene oh he says we have a safety zone i pray heavenly father that you'll speak to hearts tonight let them know that they're living in the shadows of the coming of christ when nations are breaking and things are going on what they are yet in your tender mercy look at this we have sinned so much when i read this i see daniel chapter 9. when daniel understood by the books what jeremiah had said he began to repent come on he began to invite the presence of god when i read this i see ezra chapter 9 when ezra when god brought him back he recognized we deserve worse than we've ever got i tell you brother god don't owe us one thing but we owe him everything we've got amen oh my it seemed like you turned your back from us and let us go away but still as you was back there in eden you make a way of estate you made a way of escape for noah you made one for moses for daniel the hebrew children you you're constantly making away and those who find it they walk in the light of god and have life those who reject it are condemned and are cast away i pray heavenly father there'll be none of those in here tonight that's cast away may they sweetly hear the roar of god the holy spirit speaking down in their hearts and saying this is i be not afraid it's i for we ask it in jesus name amen where were the rest of the men or the people when they had gathered around jeremiah where were the rest of them the rest of the people these princes and those that were gathered around the king they didn't care how they treated jeremiah right they didn't care they didn't take great precaution and lower him down in there they cast him in there you see many times people don't don't take consideration of how they're treating the word just walk right on by not not even having any any reference to the word this is why the scripture when it speaks of the shaking in in in in in hebrews 12 when it deals with that shaking notice the request let us have grace whereby we might serve him with reverence we want to know the places we're walking we want to follow his leadership think of it the rest of them there was no care how they put him down in the dungeon but here if badminton this was not just something that a badmilite was you know in tune with jeremiah's person no no this man recognized that jeremiah was the prophet of god he had the word of god he was a sign of impending judgment but he recognized that word finding its place in my life and me finding safety in there then i have mercy that's my way of escape when the rest of them wanted to silence that voice it begged me like that voice was in him and above my left said let's raise jeremiah up out of this dungeon amen let me just tell you right now this morning this message though the messenger has gone off the scene but the same angel the lord the same prophet of god that anointed the prophet of god in this hour that same one is here that same mighty angel that same living god he's the same yesterday today and forever i say this morning don't let it be in a dungeon just don't let it be in a fight show but let's raise him to a place of preeminence in our lives let him be raised that's what he wants he specializes in taking lies that are ruled and cast out and the rest of the world said to nothing but dirty rags but he said you let me have them rags i'll take them through my process of justification sanctification and then i'll put my image on them [Applause] my word i will display in a life that was an outcast that was not to be rotten but i'll display my image [Applause] they could have lifted him with jets the cords but it would have it would have hurt him but the delicateness notice about alex said jeremiah you take these rags and these clouds put them under your arms then you put the cords notice jeremiah's not telling him what to do this is his own reference to the word his reverence and approach he's saying put it right here because we're come to get you out of here we'll come to lift you up let me just tell you something he's still the same yesterday today and forever when elisha and gahesa were standing there and they were encompassed about with the syrian army remember the angels of god were always there they were always there elisha didn't bring the angels on the scene but what he did by being in contact with god having the word of god he could pray an intercessory prayer that would allow the eyes of gehesa to break out of the visible and see what is the invisible oh glory be to god i think of it right now the god that i'm talking about he's not way out there a million miles that god is right here in this building this morning he's right here parts of him have been subdivided and he's living out his life inside of sons and daughters that have surrendered their life that he might be raised in power and authority amen now this man's name is it means servant of the king now there's no doubt about it he had an audience with zedekiah think about how he would place his life by going to zedekiah zedekiah had already said scriptures on up above where we started reading zedekiah was the one that also told the princes when the princess said let's get rid of him man all he's talking is treason and stuff we don't want to hear it no more and zedekiah says well go ahead if y'all go ahead you all want to do it do what do whatever you want to do with him you see zedekiah was a man it was spoke of israel listen to me it spoke of the lastness and the looseness within israel this man was a wishy-washy he didn't have any place to stand he was the same way that ahab was and the rest of them well i don't know whatever you want to do with them when a bed millet came and abandoned like say hey they cast jeremiah down there we need to raise him up he's going to die of hunger and he said well you know you you can do it i do take take take 30 men do whatever you want he wasn't willing to make a stand to commit either way brother and sister if you try to live between two different desires there's a desire within you that you want to serve god but yet there's another desire that's out here in your life that saying that's trying to call against it what must i do you must stop living between the two desires and let the desire on the inside say god raise up the daughter of god in me raise up the son of god in me amen he was a servant of more than just zedekiah he was a servant of the king amen well the rest of them didn't want to hear jeremiah i don't hear what he's got to say that man don't speak nothing he don't say nothing about positive about the stock market he don't say nothing positive about what's going to happen i don't want to hear that man you realize spirits don't die people do spirits don't die same thing when the prophet of god was here it's come right around right in churches and everything else people get tired of hearing where they're living at let me just tell you right now as a preacher i do not delight in getting down and beginning to preach on those things and rebuke and correct but i do it because of my zeal and desire to please him and to serve his people you see there's something in you glory be to god that you maybe can't even see in your life but the holy spirit that would be pulsating through my heart and delivering the word he sees a son and daughter of god if you only give him the right away brother he will lead you into the place of safety and rest let him sweetly roar that's almost seems like irony sweetly roar when's the last time you would ever hear a lion and say whoo that was a sweet roar how could one be how could it be a sweetly roar it's because the roar he's coming forth to claim what belongs to him the sweetness is he comes to call his sons and daughters the roar is to let that first nature know you better let them go the roar is to let them know let my son go that they might serve me isn't that a paradox now notice this here in john chapter 3 the lord jesus speaking of his his death and burial resurrection as moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life notice the key is not believe on him believe in him if you believed on him that's wonderful but let it become deeper in your life to where you actually receive the power of god in your soul to change you oh my for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved in john 12 31 now is the judgment of this world house and now shall the prince of this world be cast out now think of this this is such a great the great event that is taking place in that of the crucifixion we're in that the lord jesus himself is actually through him by the righteousness of god's own life here he has he's taken his own laws upon himself and he's now getting ready to go pay the sin that every claim that the enemy had upon us where the enemy had liens upon our soul and the enemy said no you can't touch them right now they cannot receive that right now but yet god and himself coming down he's the only one that could pay the price and remember when he's talking about the world he's not talking about the earth he's talking about the system that's upon the earth because the earth itself it shall be fully redeemed just as he has fully redeemed you and i by his spirit and taken us through the same process so notice the judgment of this world now shall the prince of this world be cast out let me just tell you right now the casting out of this prince even though he's the prince of power of the air he's over every nation he's over every government he's in control of every kingdom the kingdoms of this world have not become the cri the lords and his christ it has not happened that'll be in the millennium after the stone has smoked the image in the feet but in the meantime he is over that of the world but to faith of the grace of almighty god that god would move down through him by a divine unction and deliverance of his spirit through the blood and would absolutely cast satan out of your life that's a paradox how that god himself where satan came down in eden and spoiled one of god's daughters he got a hold of that woman at the well and noticed here she had been six husband and living with a man one even her own husband she had all kinds of scruples and troubles in her life glory be to god she was an old clot an old rag that nobody wanted around she had to go out to the well at a different time but jesus knew what was beneath him on rags jesus himself came right down in the midst of satan's eden and by his word he changed her life brother she went away from that well she did not go away from their first thing anymore she had found that which satisfied [Music] and i look at this if i be lifted up from the earth i will draw an inward impelling oh men unto me this he said signifying what death he should die now think about his death it's so stumped the enemy think how brother brown would dramatize it how that the lord jesus he said walking up the hill carrying the cross he said the devil was even looking and saying can't be him the graham said where they had strapped him on his back the blood spots begin to get bigger and bigger and he said the devil sat there and looked and said this man can't be the son of god hallelujah listen to me a son of god wouldn't put up with that but you see the enemy look at the enemy is always seeking to escape submission surrender and suffering any way he can dodge it listen to me now even jesus himself prayed to dodge the cross that's a direct quote souls in prison now he prayed if it be possible let this cut pass for me why this guy right here this humanity there's not one of you would sign up and say hey you know what i ain't had a trial one in a while i think you know what man i ain't had nothing in my house you know what god why and i didn't cancel like the rest of you're an idiot if you think that way oh god forgive me but you understand what i'm saying i mean you're crazy for thinking something that way you go to start inviting things and signing up for it now i had nothing a long time i don't want to talk that way because what i'm looking for god knows what grace that i have made up he knows the tests the trials that need to come my way to mold me and to shape me and i'm dependent on him because when a test or trial comes brother i need his grace i need his grace amen to make it through day by day so when we look at this oh my so when we look at this of how that it would be placed here notice how that in the submission and the humility i think how paul said it he was crucified in weakness but he was raised in power the only way he could ever be raised in power you know quickly we'd want to jump to the resurrection you know it's amazing many times when we talk about that even during easter time or any at any time of the year many times it is done away with or not even dealt with of how that he would deposit and unload the unload the sin dead in the lowest parts of hell and what he would do down there before ascending up now remember a lot of times we want to move to the ascension but remember before the ascension out of hell and then defeating death hell and the grave satan's trinity he first had to be a surrender of his own will to the will of god you see power is not something that's added to us power is what we receive when we surrender amen now notice this in isaiah 11 10 and in that day there shall be a root of jesse which shall stand for an inside of the people notice for an end sign and an ensign is a rallying point like many of you know the flags and things like that i think uh my my father-in-law just got zachary one of those calvary flags and he's out there in the yard you know with his uh get up on his calvary get up and he's walking around with that you know and his bayonets and everything else and he's walking around with it you know dramatizing it acting it out you realize those flags itself every one of those flags just like there were standards in that of israel every tribe had a standard is that right and the standard at that time in the standard it was a rallying point when they would go into war you know many times let's say brother joy was the general and here i am just the private that's fighting and brother joe you know is is there well wherever brother joey is at if he's over top of the platoon or the regiment that i'm in that that that standard armor bearer is going to be very close to you and so when i want to know what's going on i'm not going to be able to hear so much his voice but i am going to have something that i can look at and what i'm looking at it will tell me the direction that the battle is actually going and so god himself would so condemn sin that there would be an ensign given to the people and that inside would be that of his own life that through him by the shed blood that there would be an insight of the people to it the gentiles shall seek and his rest shall be glorious so it would be an enzyme that is lifted up now that out there you know you could look at that and say well let me see where's the battle going and maybe you got turned around anybody ever get turned around sometimes oh yeah sometimes you know i've got turned around i've been hunting in the woods and i'm telling you what somebody come to me and said no you're going the wrong way no sarah i know it's where i walked in but my bearings got turned around on me but you see there's always something that i can look at in that inside that standard that'll help me get back on track you know let me know what is actually taking place let me just say this to you the inside itself that was lifted up in this generation is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and the very reality of god is that that ensign is so lifted in the hearts and lives of the believer to where even in your spirit your mind your body then you maybe just feel like man i'm getting all turned around but there's an enzyme on the inside of your soul if you've been sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost there's a standard in your life brother there's a display that's in your life there's a token that's on display when the battle gets thick and the battle gets hot oh this brother just had this diagnosis or this just was said to this sister or this is said to this one and you know what they could lay down they could retreat but there is one on the inside of them that knows no retreat he's met every devil he's conquered every devil and that inside on the inside brother don't you realize greater is he that is in you then he that's in the world [Applause] the inside of his life to where the rest of the world would cave but god said i'll let my standard be reflected in your life well the rest of the people want to dress and the women want to dress the way they do and men want to go off and be sissies like that and they want to go about their way but i'll take a little handmaid i'll take i'll take one of my sons and i will reflect the standard of what a son and daughter of god is and god will take standards he will take lives that the rest of the world says that's an old rag what are you going to do with that old clot i mean it's been tucked away look at it it's done lived its life but god says oh no when it gets into my hand it's able to be able to lift the standard of the word in that life isaiah 53. you see we read in hebrews 1 that he upholds all things by the word of his power do you realize as he has watched over your life and my life even before we knew what was going on there was nothing could touch our lives nothing could take us because we had to come and be thoroughly redeemed amen there's no doubt about it about your life or my life there's probably little things that little things that god has shown something that the enemy picked up on maybe it prevented you from death maybe your mom it was not supposed to even carry you to full term you don't know what one the the way somehow that the enemy would have looked upon that and then would have been after that life the enemy loves to do nothing i'm preaching this morning the enemy loves to do nothing more than to try to scar lives he likes to try to put scars on lies to where those scars stand out more to the individual and they stand there as a well god won't have nothing to do with me what could be about my life but let me just tell you something in the presence of god this is more than a man speaking to you in the presence of god god knows what's down on the inside of you he's not trying to raise up that character that did this and did that and lived in the world under the influence of darkness that ain't what god come to redeem he come to redeem that seed on the inside that's laid there as a dormant seed of god and god is the only one that can call that seed forth man speaking can make you feel good but the spirit of god is what makes you aware there's something more there's something more this is what i've been longing for this is the desire in my life what is it he's calling forth what the world said is an old rag it's an old cloth who want anything to do if they have and he says there's something beneath that darkness that belongs to me then our lives brother joey are if his word are being us and we are in him then brother brian we are upheld by the word of his power brother samuel i felt like giving up you can you can't can't you you can't how can you quit something you didn't start sure you do brother i feel like queen what's that mean that you're like the rest of us you're dwelling in a human body but let me just tell you something what must i do keep putting down footprints every time that god is dwelling with you dealing with your life put down another footprint what am i doing you're raising him up out of the dungeon brother little by little you might walk out of here this morning and people say i don't see jeremiah i don't see jesus raised up i don't see the living god on display but what they don't know there's a raisin going up as you're letting down he's being raised up and as you keep raising him up eventually they'll begin to mistake you for him [Applause] [Music] glory be to god isaiah 53 1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of dry ground see this is one this is where the problem was this is where the problem was or is in a life it's with the root now you cut something back to the root guess what it's going to keep then we'll come back out again but if you ever deal with the root of the problem amen hallelujah you ever get that life and it quickens that seed out comes the root first glory and that right brother aaron now comes the root first notice this now he hath no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there's no beauty we should desire him you know what this is doing it does away with the christian bookstore jesus has just a beautiful complexion that could be on the front of gq or whatever cosmo or whatever it is no no no no this was no beauty that we should desire him think about that what that means to you and i that means a lot to me but how that he himself he did not come being some great looking person that oh my goodness this is gq this is the man no he chose to come poor weak and lowly showing us it does not take the greatness of man but the greatness of god is so great this is real greatness what is real greatness is he could come in such look at this he is still not will be this is present tense he is despised and rejected amen amen many people can look back to a jesus of 2000 years ago but when it gets down to that same jesus is living in flesh and he wants to dwell behind your life that begins to touch on their life he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not raytel why is he doing all this are you with me he who is higher than the heavens the bible would say in the book of isaiah sitteth on the circle of the earth he that is the greatness the king of glory would come down and stoop so low he's our example amen surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed all we like sheep hath gone astray sheep need a shepherd all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way all right all right this is the real culprit right here self and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of the song what love is this before we were ever born he already paid the price in the mind of god before adam's standard molecule the lamb was slain [Applause] this is an unfolding of a drama of redemptive love he was oppressed yes he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shears is done so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation for he was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken he was cut off 33 and a half years old was cut off his life was offered up a lamb a lamb you didn't die of old age he could have but it wouldn't have paid the price it had to be a lamb and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will i divide him abortion with the great not the pharaohs not the kings of the earth but the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong that's you he divides the spoil the life he divides it to the strong me a mighty man almighty god speaking to you you can only let almighty god come on the inside of you the mighty god will let you know that though you are weak he becomes your strength hallelujah to the man to those who are strong he increases their strength to those who is weak he gives might because he had poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors and he bear the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors i want to draw your attention here in verse 8. he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation notice not generations because his generation has no beginning hallelujah has no end who shall declare his generation when you open matthew chapter one it does not say now here is the generations of jesus no no here's the generation this is part of the genealogy these are the genes that are in the book are you with me and in order for the genes to come forth it's got to be the life that comes to that seed in order to bring it forth there is seed there is potential there is life that rests within you from when you dropped from your mother's womb it was in you the whole time that's why you never could be satisfied anywhere else you tried to fit in you tried to do other things but there's something about it you just couldn't fit in amen yeah there's only one place that you ordained to be and that's in him you can try to satisfy that placing but there's no other place outside of jesus christ [Music] the bible said in acts chapter 1 all great philosophies those things which jesus began to do teach it's not the acts of the apostles it's the acts of the holy ghost through the apostles vessels that he called you know and they couldn't explain listen now listen when they couldn't explain what was going on and what happened in the crucifixion blew up their thoughts it didn't happen this way i prayed for it this way i looked for it this way and they just kind of better go back to fishing i don't know just gonna go back to fishing huh i don't know what to do here tell you just i thought he was the one i thought for sure you know i thought god for sure was speaking to me in that service man i just thought jesus comes right along and he comes too amen you see their discouragement had nothing to do with the word being fulfilled it had everything to do with it coming to pass but not according to how they had it figured out i'm not just talking about the word of the hour i'm talking about the word coming into your life too i'm talking about god working through your life sometimes you even feel like as a son and daughter of god you might feel like i don't feel like nothing's going on in my life i feel like my prayers are going up and they're bouncing right off the ceiling but you realize in the midst of that time you could give up and you could run but there's an anchor on the inside there's a real faith on the inside as a son and daughter of god it doesn't matter about condition it doesn't matter how you feel there's a faith that anchors you that knows that when i pray he hears me when i pray my feelings have nothing to do with it he's the same god he said ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it that's a faith that'll stand right there and call the devil a liar hallelujah when the enemy wants to try to make his accusation here you are letting down old rags and said i will not i will not give in i will not cave in why there's a greater substance on the inside of you [Music] [Applause] the word has found the hiding place it's like elijah and elisha elijah fulfilled god had given to elijah go do this go do this go do this go do this elijah did four miracles elisha did eight it wasn't either of those men doing the miracles it was god yielding moving through yielded lies you know what god was showing through elijah's life if you just be obedient to the word i bought i brought through elijah when the rest of them in that day wanted to cast aside elijah's elijah's message they wanted to override it the prophets of baal but there was a micah that would stand in the midst of that time there was a jehoshaphat when they wanted to call those 400 men out but jehoshaphat said is there one more yeah but i hate him go bring him to us oh glory they brought him but it really wasn't their strength that brought him out it was the call from a heart of a believer like jehoshaphat that says i hear all of this i sense all this anointing and emotion but is there not one more brother and sister you don't need a lot of opinions you just need to hear the voice of god [Applause] it'll stabilize you it'll meet the challenge of the hour there ain't something that's sounding out here if you let it he'll sound right in your life elisha was a man who was known to pour water on the hands of elijah there was a need the enemy's upon us who we gonna get they said go get elisha he poured water on the hands of elijah you see he was serving the word how do you serve the word in this day oh brother samuel i have the books all displayed in my house and you know i have the tapes all polished up that ain't displaying it all right i mean i'm gonna burst some bubbles but the tape ain't the token books ain't the token but the message is get under the blood the message is the token get under the blood we got the bible on our coffee table god wants it more than just on your coffee table thank god that you've got it out matter of fact it's a powerful thing if you have an open bible in your house it's the truth the powerful thing have a bible open in your house i can't get into that right now but there's got to be more than just a bible laying there i pray to god that the lord just stirs in your heart to say that's what i want i want that god of the bible i want him to be raised out of history and brought to the forefront in my life there's people in this hour the bride of jesus christ where religion ain't enough going to a church once in a while being a part of something it ain't a social club to him this is between life and death we're looking to that inside we battle we fight we wrestle not against flesh and blood there's things that we battle against sometimes we get down we can get a little discouraged and here we'll come to the house of god and it might seem like within us my goodness all sorts of things going through our mind like why in the world am i even here but there's something on the inside of you that's looking for that inside because all of a sudden once you see him come by and him raised up it just it just illuminates something in your heart and it's something you walk out of here encouraged you walked out of here i'm ready to go i'm ready to go i'm ready to go what does that mean the living lord jesus are you willing to let down them old clots bless him in their own rights don't let pride get in the way just let them down your needs is what brings him on the [Music] scene matthew 10 32 i'm trying to get somewhere here jesus said whoso therefore shall confess me before men him will i confess also before my father which is in heaven but whosoever shall deny me before men him will i also deny before my father which is in heaven think not that i am come to send peace on earth i came not to send peace but a sword i am come to set a man at variance against his father and the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law now this ain't jesus given permission for you to be rude to your in-laws you understand what he's saying the word the word is the person of jesus christ he is the tree of life he is the vine we are the branches he comes to identify those who are a part of his generation of his genealogy the pharisees remember what they said we have abraham to our father jesus said before abraham was i he said you're not acting like abraham abraham let down and lifted me up he rejoiced to see me in my day he said you're not acting like abraham though they could be of the flesh but they were not the children of the promise because the children of the promise remember who the children of the promise were people could not even read their names now matthew was a tax collector that's true that guy nobody wanted him around all right his own people even though he was a jew he'd count him an outcast jesus calls to be his disciples a band of outcasts this is going to be the work to announce that the jubilee is on these are the men that are going to declare that the messiah has come and now he has sent back his spirit to anoint messiahs these men why any going to the school down there to caiaphasis why isn't he going to the rest of them you know why they had put him in a dungeon when he came among them they rejected it this guy who in the world he think he is his mother impregnated by a drunken roman soldier this virgin birth stuff that was scripture that was scripture this wasn't made up jesus listen to me jesus came to fulfill what was written are you with me and it was not the man listen to me now closely it was not the flesh it was god moving through that ordained seed and that life moving through that ordained seed jesus was the ordained seed to express and reveal god to that generation are you with me he was the redeemer anointed one and that word was revealed in and through his life what did he say i do nothing but what i see the father do hallelujah that doeth the sun likewise you know what jesus was saying i am the visible form of the invisible god what his desires are i am manifesting it [Music] there is a divine connection between the invisible he was tied in with an invisible union they said you're a man you're no more you're just a man and yet you said you saw abraham they failed to recognize that the god who came in and came and visited abraham in a veil of flesh he was standing there in that veil of flesh known as his son he was veiled there according to the word and yet though they packed the word in their hands they read it in their temples they couldn't recognize the words standing there and they crucified it let me say the evilness of that spirit when lazarus was raised from the great you read this in your bible when lazarus was raised from the grave and lazarus shows up you know the bible said there were pharisees that conspired to take him and kill him lest that testimony would be spread this man's been raised from the dead you really think you're going to be able to kill him i mean in the other part of it brother brian i mean think of it you're supposed to be leaders to god come on and yet you want to kill the very works of god preach with me now brother brown said that same spirit that was there upon cain when he saw god vindicate abel's sacrifice it stirred something up on the inside of him and he rose up and he slew abel [Music] and he said that same evil spirit has come against that all the way down through he said that evil spirit no listen to me now it can't overthrow the holy ghost so it tries to discredit the vessel it's using it hallelujah aren't you glad to the holy ghost came you said i'm not able to live this life he said i know you're not able but i'm able in you amen and the holy ghost came and you're able come on now this old cane would have kept you away but there was an able down on the inside there was an able that could be led to the altar an able that could die with the sacrifice cain could not die father or mother more than me should love your your father and mother i'm so thankful i still got my bible with me wish i had my daddy with me too he that loveth father and mother more than me see more than me is not worthy of me brother sam i would give my life but i don't know what my husband's going to do you love your husband more you love your wife more what about my friends you love your friends more your lord it didn't say you know what i you don't know but say no i love the lord you might but who do you love more amen who you love more is who you give yourself to and he that love a son or daughter oh my my mind boy this gets down sticky don't it he that lover son or daughter they're my flesh he that love a son or daughter you see how the enemy i want you to watch how the enemy will do god will begin to deal with the heart and the life and all of a sudden the enemy will stir up people you ain't never heard from you got ken that call crawl out of the out of the woodwork like roaches people you ain't never heard from or seen before in your life people that has been meaner and a snake and all of a sudden they want to become sweeter than molasses what is that it ain't the holy ghost it's trying to hinder your walk amen but remember keep that in mind that no matter what comes along son or dollar or whatever more remember the only way that you'll ever really win your family and if you get the right love of god in your heart your desire is to see their souls saved amen amen [Music] amen you might say brother samuel they dislike me they don't want not that's only a spirit on them that's right right that's right this is where discernment of the word comes into place it's only a spirit that's upon them this is where you need to be equipped by the spirit of god with the word of god to stand there with a token and recognize when you're talking to him you're not talking to your son or daughter it's a spirit that would get upon him but you stand there with a token with that living word of god pulsating for your life him who was dead now is raised to life and power in your life it'll have an effect on their life i just heard brother brown i'm here early this morning in the message has changed where brother i'm saying i'm preaching he said going out here and preaching in these places and he says it seems like the word is not even taking an effect he said but then i come around and other times he said i realize it is taking effect we've all been there right seems like the word ain't taking effect remember it's not your word that's going to change anybody it's his word [Music] amen if that word can find a place in that life remember you may not see it come into expression right away you may not even live to see it come into expression oh my where's my aunt linda at she's back there in the corner and my my papa who i never met one day i'll meet him i never met him but there was a dime where here it was and where the life that she was going about and living he would stand right there he told all the family about it he gave her the book called the token preached in jeffersonville she put it inside her dresser years later how long was it aunt linda 30 some years later 30 at least 30 some years later because she's still a young one back here it had to be 30 30 some years later brother joy she reached in there she gave her heart to god she was going to a church somewhere over there in cleveland but there was a hungry there was a desire my grandma was in a nursing home my linda was going to visit in a nursing home and there was something about it she knew what grandma had was real it was genuine and grandma said i want to get back to the house of god so she would go there and bring my grandma right here in the service let me just tell you something we could have let down and say why is grandma in there why is grandma in there grandma had to be there she needed a leg here because she had to get under the water of life she had to get under the water of life sometimes we're so busy trying to say oh brother aaron if you'd only done this if you'd only done that if you hadn't done this you only done that man we're trying to band-aid people's problems we're trying to always you should have done that should have done this should have done that should have done this shouldn't have done it this way should have done it that way always one to try to correct something and prevent something listen you can do and we do all that we can do this is where we trust god [Applause] that allows us to live in this glorious rest can i have a few more minutes i'll let you know how to get started on it and he that taketh not his cross so brother drake this isn't jesus cross now this is your cross the joy this in jesus christ this is your cross what was the cross for what was the cross for that he might die to be lifted up one who was thought to be accursed listen to me closely there's a lot of things that can deal with the emotion and the spirit of a man but there's only one thing that can lead you into eternal life and that's the lord jesus christ you can have emotion you can have a lot of things and still you're just as much alive as she ever was but when you're led to that cross like paul said i am crucified to the world and the world to me nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me now think about how this cross is and followeth me is not worthy in one place of the scripture i believe it's in luke where it speaks if he taketh none up his cross daily oh my daily daily bearing the cross who are we dying to daily self yes self thoughts come our own thoughts come but the dying is where we let the mind of christ have the right of way it's dying to ourselves dying when we've taken our own thoughts instead of his thoughts taking our cross i can't take your cross paul i can't do it you can't take mine all right but god will give me grace how do i take my cross how did he take his cross yes he surrendered all right and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it let me just try to bring this down here he that receiveth you receiveth me and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward notice in the name of what does it be mean to be in the name of jesus said i am come in my father's name is that right the name being the characteristic that of his life so it is to receive a prophet in the name or the characteristic of god working through that prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward all right i hope you understand me there'll be people and there is that you come in contact with they'll never darken a church door but the testimony of jesus christ in your life won't put them in the bride but the testimony of jesus christ in your life to where they are so inclined to that will gain them entrance because how how are you righteous are you righteous by your own works no what is the righteousness his life the atonement on display remember brother brown tells us in the church age book when he breaks down that of the book of life in the sardisian age and puts it down into the four classes the elect those who will come up in the church and then he has those whose names that were never written on the lambs on the on the book of life and then you have that class which he links gamilia into that camilla himself could not see what god was doing but gamilia told the men in that hour he said let me tell you something if this is of god and you're coming against it you got god on your hands gamilia said but if it's not of god you don't have to worry about it it'll fizzle out brother brown tells us those very words saved him right that's our mind sometimes to figure out this ain't you walking around saying i give you eternal life i'll give you that ain't what that is then what it is at all it's your life that sometimes that people you can look at and say well why don't they ever come to church why don't they ever ask anything about it why don't they ever it in that they're seeing a life or see something that's genuine and they said if there's anybody that's genuine they are genuine what is that that's the prophet the holy ghost raised out of the dungeon raised out of by the rags and clouts in our life he raised up in power are you with me now i hope i don't stumble you but i'll say it to you like this right here here it goes on to say and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of the disciple are you hearing me brother branham had medical bills paid for by individuals and by people that's right are you with me many different testimonies that you go through in here and how many were very good and very kind to that of the prophet look there's been people that's been good and kind to you as well they don't listen it doesn't mean that oh my yes so and so came over and they planted my tomatoes for me they're going to be there that's not you deciding that but i'll tell you this right here let me just put it in a way that i heard it told years ago if my wife was on the roadway and there happened to be a flat tire come on the car and you know i'm not around to be able to change that tire but there is somebody who comes along and they see that she needs help as a little lady and they say ma'am you just stay you just stay right over there go around the front of the car over there we'll help you take care of this right now okay can you pop the trunk and they go through it all and they get that tire put on there i'd be so thankful if i could find that man i'd reward him i'd reward him you know why because he helped my sweetheart out he helped my sweetheart out right oh brother and sister this is this is real deep in it i mean deep it's things that's beyond our understanding it's not what you and i impart but i think if there's anything that ought to draw out of our life and say lord let my life be a true billboard lord amen the world is longing for reality they're longing for something that's real they've sought church they saw religion but they want something that's real amen hallelujah so do i i want to live and walk in that reality don't you to receive a prophet's reward let me just stop here this morning brother has asked a question look could you explain that i'd like to know what is a prophet's reward bible brown reads into the scripture he goes into it he said if they want to know what a prophet's reward is it's to be a friend to the prophet that's a reward he's your friend wow that's pretty special how many were like friends i like friends maybe i call them buddies but i like them i like friends i like people with friends but you know jesus remember friends he said i call you friends so that you might know what my father is doing is that right the friends is those who can catch what he's doing lebron goes on to talk about this friend to be a friend of a prophet it's to receive the word of the lord that comes through that prophet the shunammite woman brother abraham says it like this it came in her handy boy died in the heat of the day is that right but she put him up there in the prophet's chamber she went looking for elisha her husband said hey you can't go in a new day and ain't a feast day it ain't time to go in all this feat she said i don't need a certain day to go you see you don't listen to me oh boy we could preach on this one you don't need to have a certain position of your body you don't even need to be in your prayer closet you can be right there on the job you can be right there in the supermarket and you can approach him amen i'm talking about the living god you've met him he is the absolute of your life [Applause] for the rest of the world don't want nothing to do with him but you've let your life down that he can be raised up in power the bible said abraham was a friend of god yes look what it got him got him a body change all right [Applause] he kept on eating on that prophet's word and you know what it did it brought a change in him and sarah he was a friend of a prophet he received a prophet's reward when there were needs that arose along the way in the journey a reward was god the word that he has said he makes that word alive and real and addresses your need and your situation and you look and say brother samuel how did you know brother samuel didn't know but god the same god the living god who declared himself in this generation when the church put him on the outside but he said i stand at the door and knock and who will ever hear my voice and open unto me let down the rags in the clouds and raise up i will come into him and i will shout with him r r so what do you say about my leg the ethiopian brother brandon put it just as simple as this right here god is ever present he's waiting longing desiring to be lifted we can look back in the past it can be even in recent past you can look at daddy mama this brother or this sister but what about you you see the only way that he's lifted out of history for you is when you let down that's right and let him be lifted in power in your life now see this is your decision this morning you can leave him in a dungeon you can try to stifle that voice many people try to deal or stifle that voice that's ringing out and they become immersed in other things in their life and they try to deaden that voice there was a woman oh he's sweetly roaring there was a woman she said in a meeting and the spirit of god through the prophet gave an invitation and she turned it down she was counting on i have another opportunity i i wouldn't even give that religion to one of my cows or horses whatever she said brother branham happened to be in a meeting and he met that woman walking on the street let me just tell you something she never intended to turn out the way that she did when she met the prophet of god think about it she didn't offer him rags or a life to say god let this word be born in me but she had become so hardened she didn't offer her life she offered the prophet a drink of whiskey and the prophet said you know better than that but you see where he had got to that hardness she took a spirit and not even recognize it let me just tell you how serious i don't tell you this to scare you but i pray it puts fear in your soul that it will cause you to run to jesus if you don't know him and you haven't lifted him you might say well brother samuel i can i can stand against it and i can stand it you can't you're no match for the powers of this day but it's beyond that wouldn't you want the lord jesus to be raised in power in your life yes amen wouldn't you want the living god this message that he sent to you and i is not to be on a bookshelf it's to be on display it's the medicine in the cabinet but you got to take it it don't do you good enough to have the medicine bottle says three times a day you gotta take the medicine and he's here i said he's here you got a choice to make you can let him you can let it remain and try to just walk over remember he was in a dungeon they were walking all over brother william you know what i'm talking about over there in uh cape coast brother samson took me through there where the tribal leaders would capture other tribes people and bring them in there and sell them as slaves or whiskey and tobacco and whatever more sure the white man was down at the boat but it was the it was the men over there that were capturing their own people history books don't tell you that right but it's the truth i walked over places in that castle dungeons am i right brother william dungeons there was a church right over top of a dungeon where slaves were kept you could see we're in the earth their claws when i say claws you understand on the fingers where they are dug they are so tight put together there was a chamber system all underneath that castle brother johannes stood right there in a church dear god there's a dungeon underneath this church and that's where the slaves were and how could they have worshipped and those people down there let me just tell you something there's a worse dungeon than that dungeon there's a worse slavery than that slavery and i'm here to tell you right now you don't have to put claw marks on that floor you can accept what he who was oppressed he was afflicted he was bruised for your iniquities the chastisement of your peace was upon him he was bruised for your iniquities he's already paid the price you say what must that do let your life down hallelujah and he will raise himself in power in your life he'll give you power that you cannot even imagine because it's not earthly power it's supernatural power it's a life that changes you where it settles there's no longer war between you and god it comes to do away with the old sin nature [Applause] calvary made a way that he could come knocked at your door this morning calvary made a way he could come right to your doorstep and the message of the hour is god speaking to your heart to let you know this is the cross to die on this is to let your life be given over that his generation might be declared that he is the same yesterday today and forever and you become a servant of the king he bit me like one who walks after the leading of the king let him be raised out of history in your life you don't have to claw at it you don't have to scratch at it you just have to say lord be it unto me i give my life i surrender my life over how about it for the rest of us lord taking up my cross daily are there things that you could say lord lord god there's things that no doubt is hindering you from being fully displayed in my life lord i want to see my loved ones saved i want to see them i want to see them lord come in lord it seems like when i talk to them they just seem like they go further the opposite way what did the holy spirit say to us through the prophet in this hour he said let them see it in you yes amen amen what should i do you keep giving yourself to the lord yes amen because what they're witnessing in your life is the absolute the revelation that's taken hold sometimes we get discouraged because our words it seems like they're not having no effect we want to try to convince and we want but remember our words are not what does it jesus said my words are spirit and life it's him it's him i don't know how many times after service many times i feel like my things are just all chopped up i feel like what we've had is chopped salad not on his part me and yet some of those times brother joe that's when i find the things but the same you don't know oh this spoke to my heart or this spoke to her you know what god's letting me know samuel you don't have one thing to do with it i don't care how good together or this or that or more you don't have one thing to do with it you know what he's telling me he's letting me know why don't you just yield a little bit more to me god help me help me because brother joy it's him he is jehovah jireh he's the one that packs us into the promises he's the one that brings forth the word in our life amen oh god help us how many say lord i'll yield these old rags i'll yield these old clots lord god lord put them underneath your arms lord put them underneath your arms lord i want i want you to be blood raised in power in my life i let down my pride i let down my pride about what so and so thanks for who thinks this or that i lay down lord i want you lord god to be the center of my life i want you to be the one who's on display lord god let me live so close to you the lord jesus they know when i go to work i go to the supermarket i go among the family let it let it be known that a son of god lives here let it be known that a daughter of god lives here i wanted to know lord god that they see you may you be lifted up lord in my life lord let you be the sinner attraction lord oh god may it not be lord god with the lord with a big words or majority of words but let it be lord god with your presence let it be lord with your presence hallelujah oh i wondered this morning you might say brother samuel you're not late you're not you're not keeping him in a dungeon but i want him to be more on display in my life i don't want this church to be like that church that i was in over there in the cape castle and they've got a dungeon this church listen it's built upon thus saith the lord it's not that upon a man it's built upon the revealed word of the hour and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty it's the spirit of god coming down that sounds the jubilee it gives liberty to you and i it proclaims there's victory for you there's liberty there's deliverance there's healing for you this is not a place to put him away this is not a dungeon this is a house for him to make himself feel at home is that your desire experience i wonder if you've never repented before maybe you've never felt compelled but right now your heart is moved to repent lord i lay my life down perhaps you've never been baptized in the name of jesus christ that's part of repentance to be identified with your sacrifice walking into the water of baptism to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ he came down to be identified with you maybe you've been baptized in the name of jesus christ but have you been filled with the holy ghost that's what brings full identification with him if any of that applies reach out to him right now reach out to him you're not too far gone satan might want to tell you you're too far gone and you cross the line i say in the name of jesus christ you call that devil a liar you've not crossed the line he's just trying to torment you and keep you from that presence that'll release his life in you brother samuel i've got a decision that's so great to make look at him look at him he made the greatest decision he left glory to come down and be identified with us he took not on him not the nature of angels but he took on him the seed of abraham so from your heart you say lord i can't solve these problems but you're the answer would you identify with him this morning you're the answer lord god bless your hands you're the answer lord god bless your hands oh let's pray what a great stillness what a sweet ruler of the holy spirit oh i believe this is such an opportunity to let down old rags old clouts and raise him up i believe this is a time for fresh dedication in our lives let's go to papa right now lord jesus first of all lord i want to say we're not worthy of our own accord we're not worthy lord our own righteousness filthy rags in your sight but lord we do not come based upon it our righteousness our worthiness we come based on your word where you said ask the father anything in my name and i will do it lord jesus there are needs that are sitting here in this building we've not come we don't come to church to hear a good sermon i'm not come to preach a good sermon i've come to minister will you have burned upon my heart lord god you know each and every need that's behind every hand in every life father i pray this morning lord i believe that god just as that was laid in the scripture there of abandon like lord the ethiopian a gentile the lord where the jews were in the time of exile but yet it was a gentile that recognized that jeremiah was the prophet of god he recognized they had put you in the dungeon they had wanted to silence that voice lord i'm speaking here this morning these people don't want to silence your voice but satan would like to try to silence that voice satan would like to try to sidetrack and say that's not for you you're not a part of it lord i stand here under the authority of the holy ghost by your word satan you're a liar and you take your hands off in the name of jesus christ i'm calling your bluff in the name of jesus christ you take your hands off of that son and daughter of god give them back release them in the name of jesus christ you've wanted to use them as vessels like nebuchadnezzar use the vessels of the lord that belong in the tabernacle of god but i've come to clean my vessels those vessels belong to me to be filled with my life lord i ask right now if there's one here right now that god while you've moved back with this war going on you've declared yourself as the mighty conqueror i pray heavenly father if there's a heart lord right now and they're hungering down beneath there god may they take them let that voice take hold lord god on the inside may they raise lord within that promise and say lord i don't want you in the dungeon in my life i want you to be raised in power [Music] i want to surrender my life i want to let down my life i want to lose my life that i might find it your life is but a vapor it's like a jet airplane that passes over if you look up very long the trail the vapor trail will dissipate it'll go away it only becomes a memory of where an airplane once flew same with your life come here in this life it's for one purpose that you might serve the purpose of god that your life might be filled with his spirit the same you understand i've got so many big plans but would you be willing to let your plans down would you be willing to say lord without you my plans ain't nothing but filthy rags you lord god what good would my plans be but why don't you let him take your life let him mold your character by his life inside of you lord jesus i believe i'm speaking lord god this morning to abimelech gentiles lord receiving the last call the final outpouring of the holy ghost on the gentile church this world is headed for judgment 1956 billy graham more roberts brother branham crossing the country but this nation rejected the baptism of the holy ghost lord we see the reason we see the the parts of juvenile delinquency we see the people lord who absolutely hate the precepts that this nation was founded on the truth of the matter is they don't they hate you lord but that all came because you were turned out of the church well they've got creeds they've got religion they've got doctrines they've got teachings but they put you on the outside of the church they were ashamed of you it's like simon invites you but they don't welcome you we'll let you sit with dirty feet the lord i'm reminded in that house of simon your prophet told us like this he said the only reason you kept that appointment because there was a little lady lord be the god she was going to be coming and there was an appointment with her when she came in they even whispered if he only knew what kind of a woman is touching him hallelujah he put her away he can't be no prophet he don't know what kind of woman is touching her but he knew what was beneath that darkness oh god you know what's beneath the darkness you knew what was beneath the darkness of my life you know what's beneath the darkness lord jesus grant lord i pray may you be called out of history a life lord that's only been around the message only been around the word maybe it's been a family association maybe it's been a family affair maybe the reason they come to church here because dad comes to church or grandma or grandpa [Music] but god may it be something that they realize this morning i need a god i need that god raised out of history i need him raised out of history i don't want to silence that voice no more i want that voice to sound inside of me i want that jubilee to sound in my life granted lord i pray oh in the name of jesus christ i want to live [Music] until there's just [Music] the lord amen would you like to stand and sing that i want to live or let it be a dedication just the offering up of your life [Music] until there's just no more [Music] i could never [Music] ever the way he wants me to live there's just no more to give i want to i could never turn your eyes upon
