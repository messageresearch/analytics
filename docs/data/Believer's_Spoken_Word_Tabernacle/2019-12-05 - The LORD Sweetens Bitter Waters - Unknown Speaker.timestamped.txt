[42:18] Exodus chapter 15 I'd like to go there
[42:23] tonight and I want to read verse 22 is
[42:30] where I'd like to go to
[42:38] certainly appreciate brother Brian
[42:42] coming over and taking care of the
[42:45] things we're improvising a little bit
[42:47] right here while we're waiting on things
[42:49] to get here the Brian I know he made the
[42:53] trip over here on Sunday evening his
[42:56] family and everybody was just there
[42:59] still sick but brother Brian came over
[43:02] here on Sunday night and to try to get
[43:05] this to work for us and so that way you
[43:08] didn't have any excuse not to see
[43:13] somebody says what's a song look but we
[43:19] just think the Lord tonight let's look
[43:20] here in the word of the Lord verse 22 we
[43:27] would like to start right there so Moses
[43:30] brought Israel from the Red Sea and they
[43:33] went out into the wilderness of Shur
[43:36] and they went three days in the
[43:39] wilderness and found no water and when
[43:43] they came to Marah they could not drink
[43:46] of the waters of Marah for they were
[43:48] bitter therefore the name of it was
[43:51] called marna and the people murmured
[43:55] against Moses saying what shall we drink
[44:03] amen and he cried unto the Lord and the
[44:09] Lord showed him a tree which when he had
[44:12] cast into the waters the waters were
[44:15] made sweet there he made for them a
[44:19] statue and an ordinance and there he
[44:22] proved them and said if thou wilt
[44:25] diligently hearken to the voice of the
[44:29] LORD thy God and will do that which is
[44:32] right in his sight and will give ear to
[44:36] His commandments and keep all his
[44:39] statutes I will put none of these
[44:42] diseases upon thee which I have brought
[44:45] upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord
[44:49] that healeth they make god bless you
[44:54] bless the reading of his word as you're
[44:55] being seated tonight
[45:04] I just want to look at this thought here
[45:08] and this has been a very precious
[45:11] probably to many of you as well a very
[45:13] precious scripture reading it's
[45:17] something that that that in just really
[45:21] just meditated for over a year and just
[45:24] just waiting and then the Lord just just
[45:27] picked it up this week with where it was
[45:29] where everything was and I want to speak
[45:32] tonight on the font the Lord sweetens
[45:36] bitter waters and if I had a sub thought
[45:41] within and I'd like to look at the path
[45:43] of the Lord you know when you think of
[45:46] how that that Israel when they they came
[45:50] into this place right here the Bible
[45:54] says that the waters when they they came
[45:57] to him they were thirsty they they
[46:00] needed a refreshment and when you you
[46:03] know how it is when you have need of a
[46:06] drink and they were in a situation they
[46:08] had went three days journey and within
[46:10] three days journey to hear God brings
[46:13] them to a place that the waters
[46:16] themselves were not even waters that
[46:18] were fit to drink they were bitter they
[46:23] could not find any refreshment out of
[46:26] these waters at all and when you look at
[46:29] it within the life if we can just pause
[46:32] just for a moment when you think of a
[46:34] bitter taste there's probably not one
[46:36] person in here that has not that has not
[46:41] at some time or another experienced even
[46:44] where there's been maybe a bitterness
[46:46] within your body naturally or even in
[46:49] your stomach or even you know how the
[46:51] acids would come up within the throat
[46:54] and that's what that's a bitterness that
[46:56] is there and to think that how that this
[46:59] bitterness we know that it's also a type
[47:02] of what would be after the fall we're in
[47:06] that the very we're in that man's nature
[47:09] would be such of a bitterness that it
[47:12] would long and crave for the things of
[47:14] the world but yet God himself by his
[47:17] grace would make away that he would
[47:20] actually take away that bitterness of
[47:24] that old nature and he would put a new
[47:27] nature within us by his Spirit and that
[47:31] that in itself is a great paradox but I
[47:33] I want to bring this down as the holy
[47:36] spirit would if he if this is so be the
[47:38] manner that he would direct it you think
[47:41] of how that the very approach was in the
[47:43] in in the Garden of Eden when when how
[47:46] God had told Israel or told told he told
[47:49] them at that day the day you eat thereof
[47:52] that day you die they could have never
[47:55] known and neither did God want them to
[47:58] experience the bitterness of unbelief he
[48:02] never wanted them to experience this
[48:05] bitterness that was there but yet to
[48:08] find of immediately when they even as
[48:11] they begin to reason and how that this
[48:13] bitterness would set in we find that
[48:15] what took place that now how God's
[48:18] expressed in that time he said from dust
[48:21] I'll came and dust thou shalt return and
[48:24] God let him know that all the days of
[48:27] thy life that the earth now will bring
[48:29] forth thorns and thistles unto you and
[48:32] so when we look at this the bitterness
[48:35] itself and to think of thee you know
[48:39] that would be around the life every one
[48:42] of us encounter bitter trials and bitter
[48:47] tests
[48:48] there's not one believer that doesn't
[48:51] encounter the bitterness of tests and of
[48:54] trials therein in situations that as far
[48:58] as for our soul our soul is not affected
[49:03] but it is our flesh and our spirit that
[49:07] experiences the bitterness of the test
[49:09] and of the trials this is why Paul could
[49:12] say in the scripture that we are
[49:15] delivered alway unto death he would say
[49:19] that the body that we experience within
[49:22] our body the dying of the Lord Jesus
[49:24] that the life might also be made
[49:27] manifest God know
[49:30] exactly what he's doing so that his life
[49:33] might be reflected in you and I and in
[49:37] among all of us here tonight there's not
[49:39] one of us that would that that that but
[49:41] would have the desire to say Lord I want
[49:44] your life to be so reflected in me and
[49:49] to find that that is not something that
[49:51] is just given to us but it is through
[49:56] victory after victory there is a and a
[50:00] victory that comes in our soul and it's
[50:03] the victory of Calvary that he trapped
[50:06] on that Easter morning he ascended on
[50:08] high and he sent back the victory
[50:11] remember the Bible says he will divide
[50:13] the divide the spoil with the strong and
[50:16] you are the strong he divided he took of
[50:20] that life and he gave of that life but
[50:23] then as we're walking in this life we
[50:26] have tests yes faithful through the
[50:29] midst of it all and and when we think of
[50:32] it that bitter trials and tests of our
[50:34] life things it can be things on the jobs
[50:37] or this or that and we can actually move
[50:39] into a place where you actually begin to
[50:41] entertain those things and when you know
[50:44] how it is when you entertain those
[50:46] things like that you find yourself in a
[50:48] position where you don't even is around
[50:51] us the bitterness of even of thinking of
[50:53] this could be or that could be but you
[50:56] know I want to just say and very simple
[50:59] that the key within it all is to allow
[51:03] the Lord I know that sounds simple it is
[51:09] but the battle is with us allowing the
[51:14] Lord he is ever willing ever-present he
[51:20] is mindful but the key is to allow the
[51:23] Lord to make it sweet I want you to
[51:27] think about this
[51:28] God Benton dry up the waters and put in
[51:32] new honors he doesn't remove the test or
[51:37] trial he just sweetens it
[51:40] are you with me he said I because he
[51:44] knows what he's doing he's over it all
[51:47] and and if we can be honest there is
[51:52] none of us that like the bitterness of
[51:55] tests and trials but yet we know that it
[51:58] is working for our good and within it if
[52:03] any one of us and I've just said it
[52:06] because it's true for everybody if every
[52:08] one of us if we had it and it's a man if
[52:11] I could just let this tester this trial
[52:14] this thing go away I wanted to go away
[52:16] but you know what God proves his victory
[52:21] through the test through the trial in
[52:24] the midst of it that's where he proves
[52:27] he's God
[52:28] so I would say it like this tonight I
[52:32] know it's very simple but it is the key
[52:34] is to allow the Lord to make it sweet
[52:37] and not become bitter from a bitter
[52:41] situation not to become bitter from a
[52:46] bitter situation what you think when
[52:50] brother Branham stood there and the test
[52:52] came to where how they the Lord you know
[52:56] had taken his wife taking his daughter
[52:58] remember he said Satan Swift right up
[53:01] there right beside me and he told him at
[53:04] that time he began to just point out
[53:06] different things and everything you said
[53:08] professed this and you've done this and
[53:10] you've done that and it began to point
[53:12] it out remember what brother Branham
[53:14] told us here he never gave any glory in
[53:17] his own flesh but he gave the glory to
[53:20] God who is present and when Satan and
[53:25] made his boast and and trying to turn
[53:28] the Prophet around remember what brother
[53:30] Graham said about they said at that time
[53:32] I was getting ready to say if that's how
[53:35] he's going to be he said but that type
[53:38] post rose up in the middle of that time
[53:41] thank God for the Holy Ghost
[53:44] thank God for the genuine birth in the
[53:48] midst of that cat did it take away the
[53:51] bitterness no but he had the key that
[53:55] would actually transform bitterness into
[53:59] sweetness because you know even after
[54:04] that you read you hear the story how
[54:07] brother branham himself would be walking
[54:10] down the road I believe with REM called
[54:11] it mr. Eisler Monnaie meone it matters
[54:15] is is what was said how that he would
[54:17] say Billy how is your religion he said
[54:21] hey you know how are you keeping your
[54:23] religion he said I'm not he's keeping me
[54:28] that's the reality it's not us keeping
[54:32] its God keeping us that's enough to just
[54:38] shout about right now let me just say it
[54:43] to you right now tests and trials are
[54:45] not sent to make you bitter but they are
[54:51] come to mold and to shape us and to
[54:55] prepare us for things that are to come
[54:57] you see when we we look at this whole
[55:00] part of the journey
[55:01] remember God could have just taken them
[55:05] and moved them from Egypt and move them
[55:09] right into the Promised Land they are in
[55:11] a line of journey this portion we're
[55:14] reading here is not where that they have
[55:18] rejected going in the land this is part
[55:22] of the journey remember the Bible tells
[55:25] us and believe it's in the beginning of
[55:26] that chapter of Exodus 5:15
[55:29] it says how that God he God did not lead
[55:33] them through the path that would have
[55:36] taken him up along there to sea and
[55:38] brought him in to the land he said he
[55:40] didn't take him up the way of the
[55:42] Philistines less they would rise up and
[55:45] Israel would faint
[55:47] you see God knows what we're able to
[55:50] stay
[55:51] he knows what we are able to stand and
[55:54] God could have taken him that way but
[55:57] you see God isn't is is working with
[56:00] Israel like the Bible would say it like
[56:02] this in the book of Deuteronomy you see
[56:04] Moses takes such time in the book of
[56:07] Deuteronomy to work with the tale the
[56:09] children of Israel now that that new
[56:11] generation has raised up he lets them
[56:13] know that the Lord has bore you through
[56:17] this wilderness as a father does a son
[56:20] he lets him know God has been in control
[56:24] it's been his care over your life from
[56:27] the from from even while you were down
[56:29] in Egypt maybe you say like this tonight
[56:31] why you were down in the slave pits why
[56:35] you are on the bar stool let me tell you
[56:37] something God was still watching over
[56:40] your life what has to happen is to
[56:43] recognize that the Lord is with you and
[56:47] then in you he got just and all of a
[56:52] sudden show up in our life
[56:54] he's there with us all the time that's
[56:59] why there's nothing could touch your
[57:02] life nothing could touch your life God
[57:07] was watching over your life
[57:08] the predestinated plan of God is not
[57:11] something that has just happened in time
[57:14] ittsan folded in time but it's found
[57:17] eternity - glory be to God I feel like
[57:22] preaching a little bit hallelujah this
[57:26] very path of God's leaning listen this
[57:30] was not punishment
[57:32] these bitter waters were not punishment
[57:36] are you with me brother Graham tells us
[57:39] this listen friends this message that
[57:41] God has sent to you and I it discloses
[57:43] the very thoughts of God it lets us know
[57:46] what God even when we take Joe brother
[57:50] Brad would take even this brother Brad
[57:52] would actually convey the phrase under
[57:54] the unction of the Holy Ghost and would
[57:56] tell us in three kinds of believers as
[57:58] long as he said Satan can make
[58:01] Oh faith that he was his god that was
[58:04] doing it to it
[58:05] he had Joe flipped so it's even how
[58:08] we're looking at the trials how we even
[58:12] look at it can either bring victory or
[58:14] defeat oh yeah
[58:19] now so when we see this this was not
[58:23] punishment this was God leading his
[58:26] children God wanted to show them his
[58:30] faithfulness his continued power his
[58:33] love and his care you know brother
[58:37] Branham he as he would replace it
[58:38] through the message of how here they
[58:41] were following Moses as Moses followed
[58:44] the pillar and cloud I think that's a
[58:47] tremendous thing right there they were
[58:49] following they were not on their own
[58:51] device God had sent them a messenger
[58:53] with a vindicated message they were they
[58:57] were following as Moses was following
[59:00] Christ they were following Moses which
[59:03] brought them to following Christ under
[59:06] the blood they were walking with that
[59:09] pillar and fire I just say it very
[59:12] plainly you leave Moses you left the
[59:15] pillar of fire are you with me
[59:18] you left the cloud right you can't have
[59:22] and say well I take Jesus but I don't
[59:24] need the Prophet that is air that is
[59:29] Error that is not the truth of God's
[59:32] Word Paul said follow me as I follow
[59:35] Christ amen there is an authority that
[59:39] God comes with his word and he unfolds
[59:43] it's it's like the scriptures that are
[59:45] here when you look at the scripture
[59:47] concerning Moses going down to Egypt
[59:49] Moses name is not even in there it's
[59:52] three scriptures that are spoken to
[59:55] Abraham in Genesis 15 but God just like
[59:58] the Tabernacle in the wilderness he
[1:00:00] reveals in the tabernacle the wilderness
[1:00:03] just speaking of Christ he unpacks his
[1:00:06] word in every Jenner
[1:00:08] and everything will always be unpacked
[1:00:11] the same and place the same because he
[1:00:14] is to say yesterday today and forever
[1:00:19] glory be to God oh mama it looks like it
[1:00:26] looks like to the human carnal thinking
[1:00:31] it looks like he - let him - good water
[1:00:34] three days I've been been three days
[1:00:38] without water mind you they're getting
[1:00:41] ready to run out of food - but you need
[1:00:43] water first it looks like he would have
[1:00:47] let him to good water but he let him to
[1:00:52] bitter waters so he could prove their
[1:00:56] faith
[1:00:57] I think his one writer wrote it let me
[1:01:01] see if I can get it right now one writer
[1:01:03] wrote it he said you know in this
[1:01:05] particular incidence he said what we
[1:01:07] find is he says is it he said where the
[1:01:11] complainers that worships sometimes are
[1:01:13] made manifest or is it where the
[1:01:15] worshipers sometimes complain I thought
[1:01:19] that was really good it you know because
[1:01:21] there is there's times we all complain
[1:01:24] but a tenant comes out where is it at is
[1:01:27] it always the complainers once and allow
[1:01:29] they worship or are we worshipers once
[1:01:32] in a while you complain Oh hallelujah
[1:01:36] but he led them to bitter water so he
[1:01:39] could prove their faith he likes to do
[1:01:42] it he likes to let tribulations come on
[1:01:46] you shall listen to these words show you
[1:01:52] so he can show you his love and his
[1:01:56] power too think about it brother Raman
[1:01:59] he goes on he says how can people today
[1:02:01] who doesn't believe in the miracle
[1:02:03] working power of God when tribulations
[1:02:05] come they just give up and gone but we
[1:02:09] believe God works miracles
[1:02:15] hallelujah because you see God will
[1:02:18] always act the same way when the
[1:02:21] conditions are met God will always act
[1:02:24] the same way every time he hasn't
[1:02:27] changed he had to diminish in power
[1:02:30] there's not in one iota or one ounce he
[1:02:33] is the same God tonight that he ever was
[1:02:36] and you see God would bring it down
[1:02:40] through his word and I'm just referring
[1:02:42] to your places in the book of
[1:02:44] Deuteronomy of how that through the
[1:02:46] wilderness God spoke through Moses in
[1:02:49] the book of Deuteronomy and this was not
[1:02:51] just something that they were hearing he
[1:02:55] took them to experiences in their life
[1:02:58] you have seen how the Lord has cared for
[1:03:02] you as a father did the son you have
[1:03:04] seen how he suffered deed to hunger that
[1:03:07] he might prove thee and feed thee with
[1:03:10] manna you have seen how did he kept
[1:03:12] clothes on your back you have seen how
[1:03:15] he has made a way time and time again
[1:03:17] you see it wasn't just word brother but
[1:03:20] the word comes with experience that was
[1:03:24] to build an experience for the promises
[1:03:27] that God had ordained for them to
[1:03:30] possess in that hour that's why that do
[1:03:34] not despise the day of small things
[1:03:36] every test every trial every experience
[1:03:39] in your life that's war glory has molded
[1:03:42] you had shaped you for this very moment
[1:03:45] and every test in every trial right now
[1:03:49] if you allow the Lord to sweetness he
[1:03:52] will mold you and shape you for what is
[1:03:55] to come next with it all being molding
[1:04:00] and shaping for us to sit in his throne
[1:04:04] with him he is not the author of
[1:04:07] confusion there is a purpose in all that
[1:04:11] he's doing and I love you God wanted to
[1:04:16] chase him then see the word chasing him
[1:04:19] as Moses brings that up it doesn't mean
[1:04:21] we're it's always a belt out here
[1:04:24] that's not chasing me chastening it has
[1:04:28] it has its part come on somebody it has
[1:04:32] its part God God will admonish us with
[1:04:35] his word God will teach us with his word
[1:04:38] and God teaches us by experience is that
[1:04:43] right he corrects us when we've been
[1:04:46] wrong when we don't heed that correction
[1:04:49] then that's when we really get the high
[1:04:51] tenant but thank God thank God he's
[1:04:55] faithful to Tanner heids
[1:04:56] you know what that shows he loves us He
[1:05:00] loves us enough not to let us get by
[1:05:02] with it
[1:05:05] glory be to God chastening chastening
[1:05:09] itself is to discipline it was God
[1:05:13] disciplining Israel he wasn't he was
[1:05:16] teaching them personally that that that
[1:05:19] i am the lord i am faithful in every
[1:05:23] situation because when they come into
[1:05:26] the land in their own inheritance in
[1:05:29] their own possession they're going to be
[1:05:32] times where they're going to be faced
[1:05:34] with bitter trials they're going to be
[1:05:37] faced with bitterness that's around them
[1:05:39] but they need to repeat reminded that
[1:05:42] the god that brought you out of Egypt
[1:05:45] the God that brought you through the Red
[1:05:47] Sea the God that sweetened the the the
[1:05:50] waters of Marah that same God that
[1:05:52] brought you across the Jordan is the
[1:05:54] same God who is with you in your
[1:05:58] inheritance he's the one that's done it
[1:06:02] now we won't ask hands for how many
[1:06:05] times that we feel like he's not there
[1:06:10] we won't ask the time for hands that it
[1:06:14] feels like in the midst of a test or
[1:06:16] trial that our prayers are going up to
[1:06:18] the ceiling and ricocheting down we
[1:06:22] won't talk about we want but but the
[1:06:24] reality is we all come through that you
[1:06:27] might be setting in that tonight
[1:06:31] my mama I just I just want to follow
[1:06:35] what he's wanting sometimes the things
[1:06:40] that we are we're praying about and it
[1:06:44] just seems like we're not getting the
[1:06:45] answer is because we're not letting God
[1:06:48] step in we're wanting it in a certain
[1:06:53] way there's not one of us in here that
[1:06:56] don't want to be out of a test or a
[1:06:59] trial listen friends tests and trials
[1:07:02] let alone situations that we create can
[1:07:05] you say Amen tonight because everything
[1:07:08] that comes our way is you know I'm just
[1:07:10] suffering for the kingdom of God no
[1:07:12] sometimes we suffer for our own sorry
[1:07:14] decisions and the church said you can't
[1:07:18] put everything as though that you eat
[1:07:20] angels when you ate Donuts with the
[1:07:21] Angels every morning there's times where
[1:07:24] you make wrong decisions even in that he
[1:07:27] is faithful glory be to God now how that
[1:07:36] God he led them here's God leading them
[1:07:39] now God as he would lead them out you
[1:07:44] know when you think about it they didn't
[1:07:46] know how these waters were going to be
[1:07:47] Moses didn't know how those waters were
[1:07:50] going to be but God knew how the waters
[1:07:52] was going to be this was a divine
[1:07:54] appointment by God God knew exactly even
[1:07:58] to where how even the Junction's of time
[1:08:00] and how that they would come tomorrow at
[1:08:02] this particular time he knew they would
[1:08:05] be thirsty it was somebody preach with
[1:08:08] me tonight there's times where you might
[1:08:11] seem to look all around you and it don't
[1:08:14] seem like you're getting any thirst or
[1:08:16] refreshment but let me remind you the
[1:08:18] refresher is right there with you he
[1:08:24] hasn't left you at all I'm gonna believe
[1:08:28] these are god of his word
[1:08:30] he's God of his word hey man he said
[1:08:35] I'll never leave you nor forsake you
[1:08:38] that's what he said he said so then as
[1:08:43] Paul said then I will say that the Lord
[1:08:46] is my helper I will not fear what man
[1:08:49] can do unto me jesus said I'll never
[1:08:52] leave you I'll never forsake you well
[1:08:55] I'm with thee even unto the end of the
[1:08:57] world he says he says I am with thee my
[1:09:00] presence is there with you but how many
[1:09:08] times when situations arise we don't
[1:09:12] feel see God is God listen to me
[1:09:17] faith is built upon the word I love to
[1:09:21] feel him as much as anybody does but our
[1:09:27] faith is built in the word you say what
[1:09:31] do you mean I'm saying when you doubt
[1:09:32] feeling you can able to stand there in
[1:09:35] the midst of the trial and set but Lord
[1:09:37] you said you are you were with me you
[1:09:40] never leave me nor forsake this so I'm
[1:09:42] gonna thank you for being faithful to
[1:09:45] your word you say brother Samuel that's
[1:09:47] mind over matter no we are believers
[1:09:52] they meant we don't walk by sight we
[1:09:54] walk by faith amen
[1:09:58] faith is a revelation amen
[1:10:02] when he was there think of this here is
[1:10:05] Moses coming to this place and that's
[1:10:07] what I like how brother Graham says it
[1:10:09] here he says here he said when they came
[1:10:10] up to this spring of Marah and when they
[1:10:14] came to there along this road but he was
[1:10:17] there talking about the Lord the remedy
[1:10:20] for the bitter waters was standing on
[1:10:23] the bank
[1:10:24] Moses cut down a tree and throwed it in
[1:10:27] the water and it turned sweet again they
[1:10:31] couldn't bypass this come on somebody
[1:10:37] Jesus himself let me put it in the words
[1:10:40] of the prophet from Matthew 26 he said
[1:10:43] Jesus in souls in prison prayed to even
[1:10:46] dodge the cross are you with me if it be
[1:10:50] possible let this cup pass from me he
[1:10:54] even would tell Peter put up your sword
[1:10:56] in John 18 11 put up your sword for I
[1:10:59] must drink this cup that the father has
[1:11:02] called for me to drink reality there's a
[1:11:06] lot of cups that we've asked Lord remove
[1:11:10] this I hope you understand hear this if
[1:11:13] you hope you listen very closely
[1:11:15] this right here God came down and it
[1:11:18] came one of us so that he could
[1:11:20] understand that and be able to minister
[1:11:23] to you and I as a faithful high priest
[1:11:25] but you must continue to look at the
[1:11:27] word he came to a place to be able to
[1:11:31] say nevertheless even a lemon let's not
[1:11:34] my will but thine will be done and he
[1:11:37] prayed that way three times showing you
[1:11:41] here and within even better the human
[1:11:44] will human will being given over to
[1:11:46] allow God to step in let me just say
[1:11:50] this to you Jesus did not go to Calvary
[1:11:52] bitter who mama he didn't go to Calvary
[1:11:56] bitterly what I got to do this I never
[1:12:01] done nothing wrong and they're spitting
[1:12:04] on me buying a black man black name upon
[1:12:07] my love the whole time I've had to sit
[1:12:10] here and there's been one against me the
[1:12:12] whole time and I had to pretend that he
[1:12:14] was my brother
[1:12:15] come on preach with me now I've had to
[1:12:18] sit here he wasn't acting
[1:12:20] he wasn't pretended brother it was
[1:12:22] demonstration of what the love of God
[1:12:25] can do it can so sweeten the life to
[1:12:28] work Jesus to get bread in the same dish
[1:12:31] with his enemy
[1:12:33] whoo so much--so bet the rest of the
[1:12:38] disciples questioned themselves not
[1:12:40] judas see there wasn't anything that was
[1:12:43] going on like ya see now Jesus looked at
[1:12:45] him you know how it is I mean you know
[1:12:46] Jesus you know he don't respond on him
[1:12:48] he don't call on him he don't do this he
[1:12:49] don't do now nothing nothing nothing
[1:12:53] like that at all you say brother Samuel
[1:12:56] that's Jesus were his bride and it's not
[1:13:00] my flesh
[1:13:01] it's that see Jean on the inside that
[1:13:03] came from the loins of God's mind but
[1:13:06] the quickening power has quickened the
[1:13:08] raised up and what that light did in the
[1:13:10] group yet must do and it will do and is
[1:13:13] to it the same in the bride for he is
[1:13:15] the vine we are the branches if it bears
[1:13:19] if the vine is a lemon branch and it
[1:13:21] bears oranges its bearing false witness
[1:13:24] of the life of the vine help me Lord
[1:13:29] help me Lord you can bypass it sometimes
[1:13:37] I wonder and I'm just speaking very
[1:13:40] plainly I know how it is to want to
[1:13:42] bypass things we all have tests and
[1:13:48] trials my chest and my trials are not
[1:13:52] any greater than yours neither are yours
[1:13:55] and mine and the reality is there's not
[1:13:59] one of us that's tangled face-to-face
[1:14:01] with the devil himself
[1:14:02] we've wish we just had the imps coming
[1:14:06] come on now Jesus was the one he met
[1:14:09] that challenge is that right
[1:14:12] Mendon to think of this that how every
[1:14:15] one of us go through tests and trials
[1:14:17] you say why does this one go through
[1:14:18] this chest or why does this one why am I
[1:14:20] going through this your tests and your
[1:14:22] trials are relative to the position that
[1:14:24] you're called to you are tried and
[1:14:28] tested based on the position now
[1:14:31] spiritually our position remember when
[1:14:34] the sons of thunder there of Zebedee the
[1:14:37] question was made can you give them to
[1:14:40] sit on the right hand and left hand what
[1:14:41] did Jesus say he said it is not mine to
[1:14:44] give blood I'm said see it
[1:14:46] shows it was already given but it says
[1:14:50] it shall be given is what Jesus said to
[1:14:52] those of whom in his four and brother
[1:14:54] Adam pointed out clearly he said see
[1:14:56] what it is the test for the throne had
[1:14:59] not fallen yet but that test for the
[1:15:03] throne must fall and when it falls
[1:15:06] remember it is not can I hold on can I
[1:15:09] make it we have already overcome in
[1:15:13] God's mind there is no defeat in God in
[1:15:20] his plan he did not choose you wandering
[1:15:23] or biting his nails thinking am I gonna
[1:15:25] lose him oh my goodness huh no no no I
[1:15:28] don't know if this tester trial right
[1:15:30] now no God he molds us he shapes us he
[1:15:33] prepares us for every test in every
[1:15:36] trial as it comes along while he's
[1:15:38] working not so much to make us better in
[1:15:41] this life he is molding us and shaping
[1:15:44] us for that life which is to come this
[1:15:49] is only as brother Brown would say it
[1:15:51] over and over especially a lot in the
[1:15:53] Hebrew series this is the proving
[1:15:55] grounds we can't bypass it is that right
[1:16:04] they had to follow the cloud of fire the
[1:16:06] pillar fire that let them you know human
[1:16:09] thinking human thinking many times we'll
[1:16:15] look at things and it seems as though
[1:16:17] everything ought to go right I'm serving
[1:16:20] God think about it for a moment God is
[1:16:27] holy God is good god is faithful there
[1:16:32] is nothing that's greater than God
[1:16:36] there's not one situation
[1:16:39] there's not one devil there's not one
[1:16:42] demon there's not one hold nothing is
[1:16:45] greater than God
[1:16:50] but God loves to show his power he's not
[1:16:58] a show-off
[1:16:59] he don't clown he don't clown for people
[1:17:03] he manifests his power and his glory for
[1:17:08] his children it is true the Bible tells
[1:17:14] us in the book of Peter that God is not
[1:17:16] willing that any would perish God don't
[1:17:20] want to see anybody go to hell because
[1:17:23] hell wasn't made for human beings it was
[1:17:26] made for the devil and his angels but
[1:17:29] there is also the divine will of God
[1:17:32] where God's choosing and those of God's
[1:17:35] the God's election that how that God
[1:17:39] within himself he manifests his glory to
[1:17:44] take a hold of the hearts and lives of
[1:17:46] the believer and give us strength and
[1:17:49] confidence in these hours of tests and
[1:17:53] of great trial it's through these times
[1:17:56] that God manifests his his faithfulness
[1:18:00] to you and I it's why brother Ram say
[1:18:05] that if we follow he said the church
[1:18:07] following the purifier the Holy Ghost he
[1:18:11] said you'll make Canaan as sure as
[1:18:13] anything but some ways and some pathways
[1:18:18] our humanity doesn't want that our
[1:18:24] humanists our spirit our mas oh no
[1:18:27] because what we do know you're either in
[1:18:30] a test coming out of one or you're
[1:18:34] getting ready to go into one one of
[1:18:36] three categories
[1:18:37] I know sometimes we want to talk about I
[1:18:40] can't wait till I get to that that a
[1:18:42] little bit between coming out and going
[1:18:43] in we'll get there but ha ha ha God
[1:18:48] promised he gives rest
[1:18:50] he gives refreshment
[1:18:53] oh yeah he feels yet strengthened yeah
[1:18:57] back into another test back into another
[1:19:03] trap
[1:19:03] but he's the author of not confusion but
[1:19:07] the author with a purpose hey man you
[1:19:10] love that this is what Jesus would tell
[1:19:13] tell the disciples in John 16:33 he
[1:19:17] would let them know that in me you have
[1:19:19] peace but in the world you don't have
[1:19:23] tribulations think of this in me you
[1:19:26] have peace but in the world situations
[1:19:30] that rise around us will be beer there
[1:19:36] are bitter situations that we go through
[1:19:40] tests and trials but notice what he said
[1:19:42] be of good cheer I have overcome the
[1:19:46] world you know and he's letting them
[1:19:48] know there is the tree standing right
[1:19:52] there on the bank when you come to the
[1:19:55] waters of mine I'm right there when your
[1:19:59] window and when you see my glory you
[1:20:02] come through the Red Sea
[1:20:03] my what a shouting service not we've had
[1:20:06] shouting services my this and that but
[1:20:09] I'm the same God who was with you in the
[1:20:12] shouting times I've with you in the
[1:20:14] times of Marah ha I'm there I'm faithful
[1:20:24] I'm there with you
[1:20:26] throughout it all and to think of this
[1:20:29] right here he said I'll be with you even
[1:20:34] to the end of the age
[1:20:36] let me quote you another part of God's
[1:20:39] Word greater is He that is in you than
[1:20:42] he that is in the world greater is the
[1:20:46] love of God and the peace of God in
[1:20:49] yourself than all the bitterness that
[1:20:51] can be around
[1:20:57] our prayer I say our prayer I believe
[1:21:01] this for everybody's heart as a believer
[1:21:03] my prayer is Lord don't let me bypass
[1:21:07] the trials just give me like the
[1:21:12] prophets that give me the grace to go
[1:21:15] through it give me the grace to go
[1:21:20] through them in order to notice the
[1:21:23] scripture says here in 1st Corinthians
[1:21:26] 10 it says that all all of these things
[1:21:32] that happened it says in verse 12 I
[1:21:35] don't know if we have that there or not
[1:21:36] but it says wherefore let him that
[1:21:38] thinketh he standeth take heed lest he
[1:21:40] fall there hath no temptation taken you
[1:21:44] but such as is common to man
[1:21:48] but God is faithful I love that it
[1:21:54] didn't say was because he was but he is
[1:21:59] he's the ever-present God in every
[1:22:03] situation God is faithful and will with
[1:22:09] the temptation also make a way to escape
[1:22:14] that you may be able to bear it
[1:22:26] that's a mouthful right there
[1:22:30] but will with the temptation so God is
[1:22:36] faithful he makes a way to escape with
[1:22:41] the temptation the test God doesn't
[1:22:45] remove the test or the trial if he does
[1:22:50] he's defeating his own purpose but that
[1:22:56] you might be able to bear it
[1:22:58] aren't you glad that he makes a way that
[1:23:02] we can bear it I'll be honest with you
[1:23:08] every test in every trial it's been
[1:23:10] because he's made away the same there
[1:23:14] been times you complain oh yeah oh yeah
[1:23:18] they'll tell you there been times you
[1:23:20] didn't see it coming every time just
[1:23:22] like you the salmon is there times when
[1:23:27] you didn't know what the tester trials
[1:23:29] about every time just like you because
[1:23:32] it the faith is not that we know what
[1:23:35] that test is doing or what that travel
[1:23:37] is do it but we do know what God when he
[1:23:39] spoke and Joel picked it up and Joel
[1:23:41] said I know when all this is over with I
[1:23:44] shall come forth as pill as gold I know
[1:23:49] what he's doing I don't understand it
[1:23:51] but he knows what he's doing and I know
[1:23:53] one thing when I come out of this
[1:23:55] there's gonna be less a job and more of
[1:23:57] God and when I come out of this test
[1:24:00] it'll be less of Samuel and more of God
[1:24:04] why he's making the way to escape I
[1:24:09] wonder could it be that the lingering is
[1:24:14] sometimes were not allowing God to
[1:24:17] sweeten it
[1:24:19] I don't want to time just getting away
[1:24:28] from me tonight but I want to try to
[1:24:33] just get us to a point and we'll just
[1:24:35] stop here tonight friends we how many
[1:24:40] times that we've heard we hear how many
[1:24:42] times have I myself have preached on
[1:24:44] tests and trials God does not get down
[1:24:48] on us his tests and trials are not
[1:24:50] punishment are you with me tonight
[1:24:53] it's to understand that they're not
[1:24:56] punishment it is God leading us there's
[1:25:02] things in our life God wants to work out
[1:25:06] there's things many times that if we oh
[1:25:09] my we would say if this person if that
[1:25:13] situation if this boss if that and the
[1:25:18] reality is God allows us to come into
[1:25:21] those maura times he didn't about the
[1:25:27] boss sir do we pray but one thing we
[1:25:29] need to pray
[1:25:29] remember what brother Graham told us he
[1:25:31] said let us conduct ourselves with joy
[1:25:34] and midst our trials brother and sister
[1:25:37] let me tell you something I'm not
[1:25:38] preaching something to you tonight
[1:25:40] that is that is head knowledge I'm
[1:25:42] telling you something tonight that is
[1:25:44] things that has to stick to your bones
[1:25:46] it's things that you have to pray about
[1:25:48] and you have to die and let God say God
[1:25:51] in the midst of this trap it's bitter
[1:25:54] love but would you sweeten these waters
[1:25:56] Lord why because the Tetra trial did not
[1:26:00] come to make me bitter it's come to mold
[1:26:05] me and shape me you've got a right as a
[1:26:09] believer to ask God tonight and friends
[1:26:13] he ain't way out there he's right here
[1:26:16] turning in just right here at the altar
[1:26:19] he's right there with you
[1:26:22] hallelujah later if he that is in you
[1:26:26] than he that's in the world when you're
[1:26:28] on the job and the bitterness stretch
[1:26:30] he's right there
[1:26:32] when sickness stretch he's right there
[1:26:35] [Applause]
[1:26:37] hallelu
[1:26:38] he loves to prove his power Bruce and
[1:26:46] prove his power I'm still in the midst
[1:26:49] of this said situation I'm still in the
[1:26:52] midst of this test he doesn't take away
[1:26:54] the waters he's sweet so if you're
[1:26:59] praying for God to take away the waters
[1:27:00] that might be the problem
[1:27:05] say Lord sweetener
[1:27:11] the seminary you tell me that I'm to be
[1:27:14] content if you got sickness or whatever
[1:27:15] I'm on your body no I didn't say that at
[1:27:16] all you misunderstood because we can go
[1:27:21] on and on through promises in the
[1:27:22] scripture here we the Bible is filled
[1:27:25] with the promises and God has made good
[1:27:28] on every one of them I'm the Lord that
[1:27:30] healeth all thy diseases by His stripes
[1:27:33] I am healed you see what a little bit
[1:27:37] had in Jesus in it can do to your
[1:27:40] situation I tell you what you can add in
[1:27:44] corrupt communication and it creates
[1:27:47] more bitterness or you can take the word
[1:27:50] and put the letter in your situation and
[1:27:53] confess God for who he is you say how
[1:27:59] long do I confess it first of all
[1:28:01] possess it till you believe it he's the
[1:28:05] high trees of your confession
[1:28:11] Masek about daddy buzzword would said if
[1:28:14] if Bosworth would say he said that many
[1:28:16] of the times the problems is he said
[1:28:18] we're focusing on the situation instead
[1:28:21] of quoting and focusing on God's Word in
[1:28:25] the midst of a situation we had the
[1:28:28] premises of God I'm just I just want to
[1:28:38] stop here tonight I it's hard to find a
[1:28:39] stopping spot but I trust my heart's
[1:28:45] desire I want you to understand my
[1:28:47] heart's desire is that we would all be
[1:28:50] encouraged here tonight
[1:28:51] that's my heart's desire is that one we
[1:28:55] will leave out of here we're encouraged
[1:28:57] but the encouragement is it doesn't
[1:29:00] remove your test or your trouble if it
[1:29:05] was up to me I'd pull everyone I'm away
[1:29:06] from you you say you would it's like how
[1:29:10] I feel about my kids but I can't do that
[1:29:14] they got to have opposition they've got
[1:29:18] to have people that call their hand on
[1:29:20] things at the college now you're only
[1:29:24] saying that because you're this this and
[1:29:26] this and this they gotta have that time
[1:29:29] what are you gonna do brother Samuel let
[1:29:31] them have that time times of proving
[1:29:35] grounds bitterness can be around but God
[1:29:38] is faithful and that's how God does this
[1:29:43] is why the human mind cannot even
[1:29:45] consider how in the world when God
[1:29:48] stands there in revelations 2 and the
[1:29:51] Bible speaks of the Simonian age an age
[1:29:53] of such bitterness and yet here it is
[1:29:56] rung out in that time I know that
[1:30:00] tribulation and that poverty I know he's
[1:30:09] not on the sidelines he's walking in the
[1:30:12] midst of the candlesticks he's walking
[1:30:15] right in the midst of your life if
[1:30:20] you'll just let him he'll sweeten the
[1:30:24] test
[1:30:26] he'll sweeten the trial
[1:30:30] it isn't sometimes understand sometimes
[1:30:34] things don't go the way that we we pray
[1:30:39] and desire that they would go is that
[1:30:42] right
[1:30:43] sometimes certain things and we pray in
[1:30:45] a certain way and they don't go in a
[1:30:48] certain way but yet in the midst of the
[1:30:50] time God is faithful to sweetie I think
[1:30:55] of how I think of how I'm closing it
[1:30:59] it's all closed up but this it enclosed
[1:31:02] down I think of our brother Branham when
[1:31:05] it came to the stats to his family the
[1:31:10] doctor kept that baby alive for two days
[1:31:11] in an oxygen tent but Bream said I pray
[1:31:15] during this time brother Branham prayed
[1:31:20] and he walked into his room there's a
[1:31:22] personal letter that he wrote I've got
[1:31:24] here that he wrote to the Stanzler
[1:31:26] family but there is also there in the
[1:31:28] message the Messiah the very beginning
[1:31:30] of that where brother Branham he refers
[1:31:33] back to this how that after then when
[1:31:36] that when when the Holy Spirit spoke to
[1:31:37] him in his room and said don't you go
[1:31:39] this is the hand of the Lord don't tell
[1:31:44] me in your mind you can understand that
[1:31:45] you can't but you just know it's the
[1:31:50] hand of God there's the Lord it is not
[1:31:53] that we have to understand if we trust
[1:31:55] him in everything we trust him is that
[1:32:01] right our trust is not well show me in
[1:32:04] denial you know our trust is in him he
[1:32:06] is with us he's guiding us
[1:32:10] I think of how sister Stansfield brother
[1:32:16] branham writes he writes to the status
[1:32:19] of a family a personal letter and he
[1:32:20] tells them sister staff letter says God
[1:32:27] didn't raise up this baby because I
[1:32:28] don't have I don't have I don't have
[1:32:29] great faith he said oh no sister on the
[1:32:32] contrary you all have great faith great
[1:32:35] faith because he said when God even gave
[1:32:40] an answer like that and were not men did
[1:32:42] not raise up that baby he said you and
[1:32:44] your husband stood faithful to the Lord
[1:32:50] that to me that's powerful that's
[1:32:54] powerful do you think there listen to me
[1:32:57] now
[1:32:57] you think there want some sweetening
[1:32:59] that had to go on in the stands flip
[1:33:02] house there was some sweetening that had
[1:33:03] to go on it wasn't all artificial or
[1:33:06] alternative measures they called on the
[1:33:09] Living Christ who was there in their
[1:33:12] lives I think they're one times the
[1:33:16] things then come up in their mind the
[1:33:19] devil didn't try to shoot in thoughts my
[1:33:21] good night ourselves closing you think
[1:33:23] there one time all those things were
[1:33:25] around just like he comes at you and me
[1:33:30] but in the midst of the time he's
[1:33:35] present to sweeten the test or the trial
[1:33:45] he's there I didn't get fully into that
[1:33:48] tonight at all but just one time if
[1:33:50] anything at all we take out of this part
[1:33:52] of it tonight he is present he is
[1:33:57] present no wonder Paul would say let the
[1:34:00] word of Christ dwell in you richly
[1:34:07] taking the promises of God upon our lips
[1:34:11] upon our hearts meditating upon those
[1:34:15] words let me just tell you something you
[1:34:19] can easily tell when it's the devil say
[1:34:21] how's that because he he's a tormentor
[1:34:26] he's a tormentor he speaks things
[1:34:30] against the word he's a liar he wants to
[1:34:35] try to tell you you don't deserve the
[1:34:36] promises of God or they're not for you
[1:34:39] where you're gonna die God does not work
[1:34:42] that way he is a God of peace and when
[1:34:46] he reveals his will peace comes with it
[1:34:49] brother are you with me you say the
[1:34:54] example on that we can go through a
[1:34:56] countless but let's just go to Jesus
[1:34:58] when he went to the cross remember in
[1:35:01] John 12 he was troubled his cell was
[1:35:05] exceedingly sorrowful unto death but he
[1:35:09] received sweetening but where when he
[1:35:14] went to the cross Peter could say when
[1:35:16] he was reviled he reviled not back when
[1:35:23] they pulled beard from his faith
[1:35:25] there was no guile in his mouth when he
[1:35:32] hung on the cross and they mocked him he
[1:35:37] never said wait till I get in position
[1:35:41] now remember what she did to me and what
[1:35:44] she said
[1:35:45] No
[1:35:50] he said Father forgive them for they
[1:35:56] know not what they do
[1:36:01] but how many knows the scripture he was
[1:36:05] delivered Acts chapter 2 he was
[1:36:08] delivered according to the determined
[1:36:11] counsel of God this was not a mishap
[1:36:17] this was all God bringing his word to
[1:36:21] pass they didn't know what they were
[1:36:23] doing but God had it all laid out
