if God be for us he can be against us [Music] amen praise the lord well we're so uh I'm pretty happy about that amen amen who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it's God that justifies you know Paul looked at all that he said you know what what I'm persuaded amen I'm persuaded there's no height there's no depth there's nothing present nothing to go if the truth's on our side there's nothing that shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ if you believe that today oh my you know sometimes we try to separate us from that but you can't do it any more than anybody else could amen there's no powers that could do that and we're just grateful to be here today knowing that if he loved us first we ought to love him as well you know we just going to come in here today maybe just to do a little little teaching little PowerPoint or something I don't know that there's anything wrong with that but man you all keyed up today I feel great I guess I'm going to have to preach we uh we sure are grateful to be with you God bless you um you know uh just say real quick here you know like I I appreciate all the songs I didn't tell you to sing any of them so but I just was like he's singing one of these songs song specials I'm like praise the Lord I love it when God brings a thing together and I just I look at the wisdom of God in it you know so many times in our lives we've looked at facts and they didn't they didn't add up they didn't look like there was a way out and you know I'm a little older than I was before I'm not as old as some of you but you know as as time goes on and I mean this from the bottom of my heart you know I look at my trials differently than I used to I look at the situations I go through differently than I used to because I used to see the problem but then now I see God working in the answer I don't see just another problem or triy to overcome but I see the possibility of another testimony of God's grace and things that used to I look at him and bother me I look at them different the the situ we we still have trials we've got problems we're always going to have them but I look at them different and they they encourage me so much more amen so I pray today maybe something be said not just to help you in your trial but maybe to look at it differently you know that God is doing something in our lives I just ask you to maybe bow your heads with me for a moment as we pray Lord that's the truth that you're on our side you've never left us you've never forsaken us Lord so many times we look at our own life our own inability our own insecurity we disqualify oursel from the blessing of God we we think it's so far away but Lord if we had confidence in our own flesh Lord you wouldn't you want one to move in that or you couldn't be glorified in that Lord the the many things we look at in our lives and disqualify ourselves with so often is the very evidence that that we're your children that you want to bless us that you want to use your people and and to dwell in our midst today Lord we we have nothing to offer you and that's exactly what you wanted oh God you wanted a people that needed you we acknowledge today we thank you as we stand here I myself as I stand in this Pulpit I acknowledge today my need for you to come and to help these people Lord how we would love to just be a help to one another and we can do that but what different thing it is when you come and you Veil yourself in human flesh like that little boy looking for a mom looking for his mama god with skin on it just something we could reach out and touch in the the time of Trials the time of trouble Lord we want to we want to be that today we want to be a vessel that could be used for your glory Lord that you could come and not just speak a bunch of facts and rehears verses today from this Bible but but that the truth be magnified cuz that's the only thing that's going to set us free today is the truth the truth shall set us free and Lord whether we're in a prison like Paul and Silas yet there's liberty for the sons of God today not because of what where we're living at but because of what you've said and what you've declared I pray today you come now bless the reading of this word the ministering thereof and may you just help the different needs may you undertake for your children and most of all Lord may you receive all the praise and the glory and the honor for we thank you for it now bless the reading of your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you we uh just invite you to turn with us this morning to Daniel the 9th chapter you know talking about trials and things like that you know one of the things going through things makes you do is it makes you appreciate real brothers and sisters in Christ born so I just uh we just want to say we love each one of you today we're just I'm just so happy to be with you amen I I could be in a prison somewhere or a ditch or something not that you're the only alternative to that but um just we just we're just such a blessed people amen I I just really feel that way today and I hope you do too and uh what a what a blessing what a what a thing to think about what God's done in our life uh Daniel the 9th chapter um for the sake of time we're not going to read the whole thing here but I do have several verses I want to look at uh in Daniel the 9th chapter and we'll just start in the first verse and the scripture says this it says in the first year of Darius the son of aus of the seed of the mes which was made King over the realm of the Chans in the first year of his Reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet that he would accomplish 70 years in the desolations of Jerusalem so to qualify this first verse Nebuchadnezzar and the Babylonians have been in charge then the Ms and purches come in and they bring a new Administration in no that's not me speaking about the election I'm just making a point brother Alex said that's not what I'm getting at I'm just making a point here so now they've changed Reigns they've changed uh leaderships and in this time he's praying he's seeking understanding he knows he's understood by the books of Jeremiah that these 70 years would be accomplished verse three and I set my face unto the Lord God to seek my prayer and supplications with fasting and sackcloth and Ashes and I prayed unto the Lord my God and made my confession and said oh Lord the great and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant and mercy to them that love him and to them that keep his Commandments we have sinned and have committed iniquity and have done wickedly and have rebelled even by departing from thy precepts and from thy judgments neither have we hearken unto thy servants the prophets which spake in thy name to our Kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land oh Lord righteousness belongeth unto thee but unto us confusion of faces as at this day to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and unto all Israel that are near and that are far off through all the countries whether thou Hast driven them because of their trespass that they have trespassed against thee now for the sake of time I just uh go down to the 20th verse here but he continues praying in this manner basically repenting for the sins of the people and it we you know he acknowledges that God has always been faith faithful and the people find themselves in this captivity this trouble because of their own transgression they were warned many times amen well that's about how I came to the Lord amen I didn't come because he called me the first or the second time I don't know how many times he called me but he got to hold me praise God Amen I'm so grateful for that notice here so he's praying and he's asking God to come and intercede and I want to direct your attention to this 20th verse he says while I was speaking and praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the Lord my God for the Holy Mountain of my God yay whil I was speaking in prayer even the man Gabriel whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning being caused to fly swiftly touched me about the time of the evening oblation praise the Lord for that and he informed me and talked with me and said oh Daniel I am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding at the beginning of thy supplications the Commandment came forth and I am come to show thee for thou art greatly beloved therefore understand the matter and consider the vision may the Lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated I'd like to take a thought you know brother BR preaches a sermon about recognizing your day and its message and I think it's significant because he's reading the words of Jeremiah and he recognizes his day and his message he understand understands where he's at he looks as oh it's been 70 years and recognizing that does not cause him what it does it cause him to go into prayer to seek a greater understanding so I'd like to take a thought today uh that ties into the idea of recognizing your day's message I'd like to speak on the idea of understanding your day and its message amen and I think that's important uh you know before I get started here you know I had a brother taught me recently I won't mention who or what but you know we we're talking about the idea this is a free country and you know this is election time of course and I'm not here to tell you my political views but you know some of you know people some sometimes they say well you know you you ought to be able to share what you want and this and that and it's funny because people feel that way till you share an opinion that doesn't match theirs know it's like free speech we believe in free speech till somebody says something we don't like and it's like for free speech to mean anything it has to work when you don't like it not just when you do but anyway so I'm not getting political today but I I make this point you know uh I was talking this here a while back to a brother and I got to studying this and you know you look back in 1962 The Prophet's still alive at this time and our Supreme Court in 1962 they made a ruling that that schools could no longer sanction or promote prayer in schools and it was interesting to me because even just the other day over in England now if you pray silently now think about this if you pray it's not even speech it's just it's thought crime if you pray silently near an abortion clinic and you confess to the idea that you pray silently that's a crime and I'm thinking well how do you police that amen we're we're literally at the thought crime level now here's where we're at praise the Lord so you look at England you look at our country and they outlaw this idea of prayer uh School sanctioning in 1962 and it's interesting we don't have prayer in school anymore we've got underage pregnancy We've Got Drugs we've got guns we've got all kinds of violence we've got bullying we've got you gender changes you can go to the counselor and get your gender changed but praise God not praise God but God we we don't have prayer in school and we look at the condition of our country today amen and and and know I've heard that for years listen they kick prayer out or schools and all this stuff come in and well that's true but I want you to think about this amen they didn't kick prayer out of your home they didn't stop you from going to church they didn't stop you from praying in your car amen uh and we can look at that situation say our country is no better off than it was today but they didn't stop you like I guess yet maybe they will someday from praying in your home like they did with Daniel for example amen and what I'm trying to build to this is you look at England you look at our country the problem is not that the law is adverse to us praying because they weren't allowed to pray in the Book of Daniel and they did it anyway the problem is not that we got rid of Prayer in school the problem is that we live in a culture that would get to such a place in the first place amen you hear what I'm saying our country forsook God a long time before they kick pray out of school right amen that's just a symptom of them not looking towards a lack of Prayer in school is just one of the many indicators of our condition today and we can look at politics say look how corrupt politics is today well I'm sorry to break it to you this way politics has always been corrupt it might be worse now it might be more noticeable now but it's not like every politician ever was just this great upstanding individual am me we we've had Trails of Tears and we've had scandals we've had stuff for hundreds of years in this country amen and outside of America I mean politics is always been filthy it might be worse now like I said so the this what I'm getting at the problem in our country today is that the people got away from the Lord and they exchanged that for politics and fashion and pop culture amen our country used to be primarily influenced by the religious institutions For Better or Worse amen the church was the primary influence in this country at one point but no longer is the church the primary influence on our culture rather the culture is the primary influence in most churches amen your denominational groups they'll get together once a year they'll have a National Convention and they'll decide what they want to introduce to the church what they'll allow what they'll not allow and when they're making that decision they're not Consulting the Lord like Daniel they're not going to prayer and seeking the face of God what would please the Lord they look at the culture say well this is what this church does this is what this guy's preaching this is what this group allows and we don't want to lose L this this this subsect or this demographic of people so we're going to alter what we preach we're going to alter what we allow we're going to alter what we believe to please our culture and God is not the god of those churches their culture is the god of those churches because they're make and you know it's funny to me they they always they always they always let up the standard amen they never double down and say you know what we got away from god let's go the other way it's always well let's allow this let's let this come in and they're getting further and further away from God all the time amen so that's why I say you don't blame the Supreme Court don't blame whoever wins this election amen because somebody will blame one side or somebody blame the don't blame politics don't blame the Republicans don't blame Democrats don't blame all this other stuff blame weak pulpits blame churches that drop the standard when God give them a word they have a word and rather than take the word and preach the word they preach their understanding of it they preached their interpretation they told you what they think it means well when Paul said a woman shouldn't preach he didn't mean that that was just them no Paul meant what he said amen when Paul said there's not three Gods there's one Lord One Faith one baptism he meant what he said and Men changed it because they were the influence here and our churches churches looked at the culture they looked at sin they looked at these things coming in and in their mind the solution was let's compromise let's give up a little bit let's just give a little bit of this hour but as soon as you do that with the word you've lost everything this is the serpent when he challenged Eve in the garden when he comes to her he just he didn't he didn't say listen listen God's a big phony he's a big liar he doesn't have any power he doesn't mean what he says he didn't do that he just challenged one word and when he challenge listen as soon as you're willing to see one word amen right well I believe at 99.99 but I don't know about this listen you're in a dangerous place because it's 99% today but it be 98% tomorrow and you look at our culture today where it used to be what happened somebody let the bar is down we don't know where the Sheep are but we don't know how the goats got in either amen well glory to God blame weak pulpits blame sell out preachers like bam that are more worried about a political position than the word of the lord well praise Lord there's your answer amen our country it's just like Israel just like Judah they've received warning after warning think about this United States what a privilege it received something most countries that are not Israel have received they've received the visitation of a Vindicated prophet and yet just like Israel of old they rejected it they rejected the gospel they rejected the counsel of God for fashion for politics for money praise the Lord for every one man of God that stood against the darkness there's 450 prophets of bail that are go out there and they'll tell you they'll preach it the way you like it right they'll say it the way you like it if you can't find it the way you like it there's one down the street that you can find amen now we can get online look it up it's just like a dating app that's what we do churches well I'll find some church that I like how the preacher says it a couple services and I'll go there for a little bit and I'll go down here and I'll go here and we'll get all up listen I'm not tell you not to to move what I'm saying is we'll make that guy the problem we'll say this church is the problem or this group's the problem we're the problem most of the time we're the problem I don't like how they do it and I don't like this and I don't like what do you like what you should like is the will of the lord well praise the Lord amen oh we don't have prayer in schools anymore you know what people should have done oh praise the Lord now I'm going to go here now you know what we should have done in this country these people they they they kick prayer out of school so we got mad and we'll go out and we'll go to political this and we'll go to school council meetings not against that that's fine praise the Lord nobody think I'm getting this is time we went to the school last week and they're like oh man he's getting on me no that's fine if you want to go to school counseling that's fine but all these people they did this they went went out and campaign they went to school board meetings they got involved in this amen and do all this other stuff but they never got down like Daniel and just prayed about it we'll spend more time telling everybody what we think about it than talking to God and saying what's God think about it amen well Hallelujah somebody amen we'll show up for this rally we'll go to this meeting what we need and we won't show up for prayer meeting but we'll show up to a political rally Oh Glory to God oh here we are somebody we'll do this we'll we'll listen to this guy thinks about and what this guy thinks and that's all good and fine but did we listen to what a Vindicated Prophet said about it do we listen to what the Bible said about it amen see instead of turning to the Lord as a nation we turn to politics to try to fix it y well politics is what created the problem because it wasn't submitted to God and listen if you're not submitted to God you're just a oneman politician you're just a oneman denomination it's no different well they don't believe this and this listen if if we leave off one thing we're not doing anything different it's the same origin y well praise the Lord like I said what we what we should as Believers as a nation what we should have done is we should have turned to the Lord amen that's not I'm just going to I'm going to give you the spoilers here that's not what denomination did in 1956 amen when they saw this stuff going on 1962 denomination did not turn to the Lord they said we're going to push our agenda and we'll fund this to fix it well the problem is they're really not doing anything different than your church is doing you're mixing politics and pop culture and man's ideas it's the same origin the same thing amen but here's Daniel think about this Daniel one man so well nobody else want to pray about it Daniel didn't have a support group he didn't have a Facebook page come on somebody he didn't have a church to go to he didn't even have a pastor but Daniel saw this going on he got down he read the Bible he's reading Jeremiah's scripture and when he understood where he was at you know what he did he went home and he prayed as he had always done before and Daniel one man a man that wasn't even alive 70 years ago when this happened begin to cry out God we've sinned we fell short we didn't listen to your voice we should have hearkened you warned us you told us and we refused to listen and now we're in this situation we put ourselves here hallelujah but even now Lord I believe there's Mercy even now Lord though your mer though your anger is for a moment your mercy ures forever notice Daniel's not going out telling all the other Jews listen you need to get right about God you need to make this right you need to get right with God he's looking at himself Lord me well they don't feel the same way I do about well pray with them they don't have to know you're praying with them right that's what Daniel did he's praying with a whole nation that do largely in captivity they're not even seeing what he's seeing and he's praying interceding for the nation [Music] right praise the Lord amen that's why I'm not so concerned about who gets elected this November because you know what happens no matter who gets elected the heart of this people has waxed gross amen no matter who they vote in the heart of the people is in darkness right the vote's not going to change that right might lower your taxes or something hey that's cool that's fine but the heart of our nation is polluted it's filthy it's defiled and there's no desire for repentance that's right amen amen their heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and we find ourselves this why I Prophet said I don't even pray for the nation anymore and I'm not saying that to pray for your officials or whatever he doesn't pray for the nation why because we're living in a time of judgment it's already been declared that's no different than Daniel praying for Babylon hey Lord save B babylon's already done for it's already over Babylon the handwriting was already on the wall Babylon wasn't destroyed the day the me and perses came in when that handwriting showed up on the wall it was over right true so we are living in a time of judgment right in a casual look at the world today would probably inform you of that if you didn't have the scripture to tell you that already but I'm saying this for a reason I want to remind you of this today God has always had a people yes amen there's Seasons where the people of God that lived under blessing and Revival and a whole nation was a part of that like in the days of Solomon but there's also times like this where God's people lived in a time of judgment God's prophets frequently come and live in a time of judgment amen and listen when when when you I I want to use this example for a second you know when David becomes king in Israel all these different tribes gathered together I like the scripture it's in 1 Chronicles chapter 12 all these Elders they get together from the different tribes to anoint Daniel as the new king because he takes over and the men of issachar I like this I think this is a good good place to be in light of the things that are coming on in this country the men of issachar come together and they also sanction David as king and they bless him and the scripture says this the men of issachar they were men that had understanding of the times to know what Israel ought to do right so if you want to know what you ought to do you have to understand the time you're living not just recognize but understand the time that you're living I sure like that Amen to understand our Dan message amen it's vital for us today to understand where we're living and because it's it's vital not just to recognize where we're at but what to do with it listen you could talk to all kinds of listen the average person if you ask him in our country how they feel about the direction of our country on both sides they don't feel good about it right that's just just the obvious part but nobody knows what to do about it because they're looking to fix it politically but there's no political answer the answer is the coming of the Lord the answer is the ushering in of the Millennium praise the Lord hallelujah the book The Bible tells us in the book of Ephesians the fifth chapter to redeem the time right because the days are evil can I get a witness redeem because the days are evil redeem the time in other words make the right use of the time it says wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is so when you understand the will Lord you can redeem the time because we can spend our time doing lots of things trying to make things better and it's not doing a thing amen listen Daniel understood in this ninth chapter he understood by books that Jeremiah said there's 70 years of captivity for the people and God opens his understanding and I love this it strikes me just just me personally even the fact that you know Daniel he understands where he's at he he sees his Dan's message and Daniel could have done a lot of things with that he could have started his own church he could have got a little following he could have went around and told his neighbors hey I know more than you I've got a better doctor than you I'm smarter than you I'm seeing something he could have done all those things but I love when Daniel has an understanding and he sees what day he's living in it causes him to pray amen right right now you might sit there say what's E A pray he already understands that but he doesn't understand why that's significant see lots of people understand that God sent a prophet the devil knows that but what does that mean today amen because it means different things for different people amen so here's Daniel and I love this it's a real compliment he's a he's a man with an excellent Spirit the Bible said wouldn't you like that there's a man with an there's a sister with an excellent spirit amen he turns to God in prayer and he sees what's going on and yet he cries out to God great and Dreadful God you keep your Covenant you've showed Mercy but we've sinned we didn't listen to the voice of your prophets please turn your anger from us cause your face to shine upon your Des your Sanctuary which is desolate amen now he's not living at the beginning of judgment he's living at the end of it I firmly would believe we're living in a time that next year maybe I don't know when it could be 50 years could be 100 years could be 5 minutes there's there's a three and 1 half year period called the Great Tribulation that's to strike the face of the Earth judgment after judgment striking and listen that doesn't have to be far off amen That Could Happen by December I believe we're not living at the beginning but that we're we're literally coming into the end of the L Church age we're entering into a season of great judgment amen this nation's already under judgment the the world's already under judgment amen this is not a new thing this is where we've been amen some of us were born in that and that's all we've ever known like Daniel So Daniel looks he's at the end of judgment he sees God's getting ready to bring him out of captivity amen and he says but what does the Lord want to show me with this because listen when God shows us things like this message when he shows us things in our lives and he he opens our understanding to things he's not just doing it so we can say that we're smarter than everybody else and put it on social media and tell everybody at church I'm smarter than you amen that's not why he's doing it but he's showing us because there's something God wants us to do with his will he wants us to redeem the time so we we don't want to just be busy we want to be busy doing the will of God not what we think the will of God is what we've guessed that the will of God is or what we were told by some interpreter that the will of God is amen so he goes and he pray you say what's the point of praying if he knows because he wants a greater understanding God desires that men everywhere would pray lifting up holy hands he's looking for somebody he can show something to so as we see the day approaching we acknowledge our Lord's soon coming and what does the Bible say watch under prayer Watch and Pray amen knowing that he's coming shouldn't make us pray less it should make us pray more like it did Daniel Amen even so come quickly Lord Jesus listen I've say this today we can we live in a time of judgment we're not powerless amen well listen I don't have a super pack and I don't have a lot of cloud and I don't have a lot of influence and I'm not an influencer and I don't have money that doesn't mean you're powerless actually there's you're probably the only people that actually have actual power amen because listen every you you and I we cannot change the broken system today we cannot change the the broken things in the world today but we have received a kingdom which can't be removed you can't save every Nation but yet God Will Save a people out of every Kinder tongue and Nation right amen so there is something to do amen but it's not trying to fix what the devil has built well glory to God see this is what I'm I want you understand Daniel is living in a time of judgment much like ourselves he's living in a time of judgment but that doesn't mean he had to live under judgment right right amen he might not have had a pastor he might not had a church but he had an understanding Spirit y amen he had prophecy he had inter inter interpretations God had delivered him from the mouths of lions right now I want you to think about this we're talking about administrations and things now again I'm not making any predictions but it's interesting because the Babylonians as we mentioned a moment ago they are judged by God and I want you I want you to think about this image you know here comes the Ms and Persians they bust through the gates of Babylon they come into the court of the king they come into all these places and they wipe out it's a blood bath literal blood bath they go and they wipe out they wipe out counselors and princes and kings and all this stuff and yet here's Daniel Daniel's in the midst of this judgment but he doesn't get destroyed he actually gets promoted amen the changing of the time the changing of the leadership did not destroy Daniel it put him in a better position you see what I'm talking about the Judgment of God on the world doesn't mean judgment on your house that's why you've got a token I'll say one thing about this country I don't know which way the election's going to go but I guarantee you we're going to be closer to the coming of the Lord after it's all over than we ever been before and that's the only thing I'm worried about you know I I did mention I said something brother briyan about this a day or two ago I said you know brother B talks about how he voted for Jesus he had an election I I I said you know what's really amazing it's not so much that I voted for him he voted for me listen matter who the popular C the popular vote elects in this country God elected you before the foundation of the world to ret to obtain salvation that's the only one I'm really worried about cuz listen that might not put a bunch of money in my pocket but it'll get me out of here it'll get you out of here cuz no matter what this world's falling apart but our Kingdom's rising up oh glory to God Amen Hallelujah amen thank you Lord Daniel I love it he comes out smelling like roses worked out for him amen judgment's coming but the Judgment that was coming on a nation of Babylon was the very same thing that was Deliverance oh my that's the very thing that delivered God's people out of Babylon and put them back in their Homeland the very Judgment of God against one nation was the Deliverance of God's people listen God didn't send judgment to judge you he sent judgment for our deliverance cuz the whole world it grows it's travailing it's waiting for something let me tell you what it's waiting for it's waiting for you it's waiting for me it's waiting for it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and how is there going to be a manifestation of the sons of God without the word to bring a manifestation this Vindicated word brings a manifestation of the sons of God which brings Christ back on the scene because the heavens have retained him but the time is coming and is now when he shall return and there's a people they're not going to say well listen I got to wait around and see how this turns out down here no they're receiving a new a new nation a new kingdom coming back to the Earth it's a new order amen so the judgments on this world it's creating it's a stirring the nest amen man I don't like how things are going good good I'm glad you don't like it cuz the eagle stir in the nest he wants you to get your eyes on the idea of getting out of here not staying here oh my praise the Lord praise the Lord amen listen the same judgment that destroyed the ancient world saved eight Souls that's what the Bible says it destroyed the anti- deluvian world but it saved eight Souls right you ever think about that what what would have been the fate of Noah and his family in a world where the people's imaginations were continually Wicked I don't know what that looks like for them but it's it's probably some out of a horror movie or something listen the the the their options are dwindling all the time there's no good Fellowship there's no one after God well we're talking about our day your n your your options are getting lower all the time so when the when God judges these people a people that would have destroyed themselves by their technology their own thinking God delivers eight Souls saving the whole Human Race So judgment on one group is Deliverance for another group see you look at judgment it looks bad but when you understand it's to bring a people out right that changes your direction it changes the way you look at it amen I used this example here I think a while back but you look at Joshua I love this story when Joshua brings the people to the promised land and they come to the Jordan River they're at the Jordan River and all his priests and all his advisers say listen this is not the time to cross over because it's it's the rivers overflowed the water's too high look at the circumstances Joshua this is not a good time but see Joshua look at the circumstances the Bible says the river of Jordan always overflows its banks in the Harvest Time right Joshua said yeah but look at what season we're in glory see as Christians we're not called to look at the circumstances we're called to look at the season that we're in amen yeah the circumstances say this is not a good time for a Crossing but the season says this is the best time for a Crossing cuz when we cross over there there's houses there's Vineyards there's lands there's a harvest and it's all for us so the season declares this is the perfect time see circumstances say look at our nation look at England look at the world this is the worst time for a Rapture there's nobody wants to serve God there's nobody after God but the season declares the season declares this is the perfect time this is the hour because the word has gone forth It's giv rapturing Faith it's giv rapturing grace to the church this is the perfect time [Music] oh my praise the Lord see if we cross over now Joshua said we not lack for food ever my God help us to understand our season today amen don't look at the circumstances don't look at what's reported look at the season God told how do I know this season the same way Daniel did God showed you what it is through the word I use this example a while back you know well praise the Lord I got to watch where I go with this I'll never get done but there's this guy from India he' come over to the states cuz my girls were wanting to I talk about this idea to get a pilot's license and you can be like 14 and learn how to fly and this and that my girls let me know I failed them as a daddy because they don't know how to fly yet but this guy from India had come over to the states and he was going to get his pilot license and go back to India and fly commercial airliners and and in his mind he thought he was going to make half a million dollars a year doing it I'm like listen the type of training you're looking to get is not the type of training that's going to fly several hundred people on a jet over the Atlantic right you flying a prop plane is not the same as flying a an airliner amen and I made this point What's the difference between that guy and the guy that flies to 747 the difference is this guy learned how to fly by sight he looks out the window he sees clouds he sees an Airfield and that's how he flies that's how he takes off that's how he lands but that guy that knows how to fly he doesn't have to look out the window one time he's got instruments in his P he's got Communications from the from his home base amen and it doesn't matter what the clouds look like what the turbulence is he's not looking by sight at the conditions he's looking at his instruments he's instrument rated it's called amen if you're in the military instrument rated in other words he doesn't fly based on what he sees the conditions are his entire way of flying is dictated by what the instruments tell him amen and listen you and I we don't see spiritual things with our natural eyes but we've got instrumentation amen we go to headquarters in heaven the word declares our season it doesn't matter what it looks like outside what matters is what the word has declared about you and I the doctors can look at your situation and they can put AR listen in my training in my experience there's no solution for you but we've got a second opinion we've got a great position and he says not only can you be well I've got good news with his stripes you're already already healed so your decision making is based on what information you're looking at don't look with your eyes we don't walk by sight we walk by faith and every time we try to walk by sight that's where we get discouraged that's where we stumble that's where we have problems don't look outside the window look at the word praise the Lord what you think about this Daniel he sees that captivity is coming to an end God's people captivity for 70 years and Gabriel comes now listen this is not his first visitation from Gabriel Gabriel comes say I've come to give you skill and understanding I want you to consider the vision what's the vision about what's the message telling us what is it trying to declare to us amen and this is the thing he he gains an understanding in through God's angel amen 70 years of judgment have ended but now God is going to bring on 70 weeks 70 prophetic weeks 490 years and these 70 weeks they have a purpose and it's not just hey you're going to do this for 70 years and then go back into judgment but there's a reason he shows this to Daniel he shows him that in the midst of the very last week amen or at the at the beginning of the last week 483 483 years later the beginning of the 70th week of Daniel Messiah the prince is going to come Amen in other words Daniel the reason I'm bringing you out of captivity the reason I'm taking the people here is because I want to bring in the Messiah I want to bring in the one that's going to rule the Nations amen amen and this this one is going to be cut off in the midst of the weeks so this why I'm saying it's one thing to know that we're living in a time of judgment it's even another thing to recognize that we're in a time of the Deliverance of God's people but why what is the purpose well the purpose purp for Daniel was to usher in the Messiah amen other words I'm not just looking to go on a Rapture to not be in judgment but I'm going in a Rapture because I'm part of a kingdom which is coming back to rule and Reign on the earth amen it's it's not about me it's not about you it's about Christ and you in Christ you understand now the change of leadership is to bring in this one and that's why 483 years later when Messiah is born those Jews aren't even looking for him that's right right they've got no idea and these wise men these Heathen Pagan wise men from Persia show up with gifts and they walk in there where is he that's born King of the Jews probably thought there'd be a banner up and little streamers and you know their GPS didn't work so where's he at and all these Jews are like our King I don't know where they at yeah so they're like well let's go look in the Bible Well if they had been done doing that in the first place they wouldn't be where they were at right right they looked in the scripture in the first place they would have to figure out where he was going to be at well they look at the scripture well he's supposed to be here he's supposed to be there and I want you to think about this these Jews these religious people amen when a star when this Angelic messenger appears and declares the Messiah is among them they don't even Rec they wer even looking for it and yet there's these Persian wise men they were looking for it brother said they were looking for it because they expected it why do they expect it because Daniel 483 years prior had been praying one day and when he was praying God said I'm going to send him at this time get ready make Provisions cuz even if you're not here it's going to happen so I want you to prepare for the changing of the season I don't want you to have to get ready when the time comes I want them to be ready when the time comes so oh my so Daniel is not only prepared for the changing of one season but two he's not just looking for them going back to promis land he's looking clear forward to the coming Messiah amen glory praise the Lord listen you take a farmer we we we have four seasons we used to in Ohio sometimes I question think we got seven or eight or two or it depends on the year but generally speaking we've got four seasons amen listen if you're looking to plant sey beans you're probably not going out and doing it right now amen there's a certain season you're going to do it in now you have no evidence of how the weather is going to look six weeks after you plant or 12 weeks after that amen but you know the season goes a certain way there's you might be in Spring but there's going to be a summer sum and there's going to be an a harvest time in the fall so you plant according to the season because you have an expectation and Daniel is in captivity but yet he begins to plant a word for men not just in Deliverance but two seasons later these men come because one man saw the day that he lived in he saw his message and he laid out a word for his people to be prepared I believe we've had the same thing in this day the message is here for us to not be unaware we are prepared not just for where we're at now but for what's coming huj my my I'm saying this for a reason seasons change amen amen you might look at your home maybe look at church your job whatever and you look at the situation man it doesn't look very good right now yeah but the season can change amen don't look at the circumstance well the economy is terrible but what is God say about it God says I own the cattle on a thousand hills I can create jobs the American government can't create for you I can create opportunities that no politician can create for you amen God is not looking at the numbers on the chart he's looking at what he has said amen let me exhort you don't look at your circumstance oh listen my my kids this and my home this and that look at the season you're in yeah but this is the season where all things are possible this is the season where God can do anything this is a time when the Lord is coming this is the time when missing limbs can be restored this is the greatest hour that there's ever been for the Church of the Living God don't look at circumstances look at the season amen now that's going to require you to pray like Daniel Prayed it doesn't do me any good just to tell you you've got to see it for yourself amen that's where people get discouraged well I prayed about it once you know Daniel the F this is not his first encounter with Gabriel you know the first time he prayed he was waiting for Gabriel he prayed 21 days right some of us can't wait 21 minutes for an answer from God this guy he prayed and he waited for 21 days and Gabriel shows up says listen God heard you the first day right listen it's not that God doesn't hear your prayers God just has a way of answering in his time amen well Hallelujah God has a way of doing things and his ways are unfailing Amen brother B says it this way God loves to test his people yes he does now we don't love that we love it when it's somebody else and then they tell us afterwards and they get up Church give a testimony praise God what a great testimony well they weren't thinking that when they went through it you weren't thinking that when you went through it no oh my God loves it like I hate it I don't want to be tested Lord today I have overcome all things the truth is I'm an overcomer I'm more than a conqueror Lord I I need some more trials no one in here if I was a Batman which I'm not because gambling's a vice I would bet a million dollars nobody here prayed for their trial God s in my way bring it up no nobody did that right right God loves to test his people why oh my my why does God love to test his people cuz he knows something about you he knows you don't know about you God sees things about you you don't see you wouldn't see it till the trial's over you're like oh wow I didn't think I'd make it yeah but God Made A Way see God loves to test his people CU he knows this he proves things in our life like he did with Daniel Amen he's got listen God is never early nor is he ever late Amen brother R says this in the sermon be certain of God he says you know it's a strange thing may God let this soak into every one of you if you never hear me preach again I'm going to amen that let this soak in everyone if you never hear me preach again let this be a message it's strange most strange sometimes that God does things that way you know we have confessed our sins we've met every requirement that God requires we believed on God there's a circumstance that has to be met it's according to his will and we've confessed our sins we've made all the wrongs that we did right done everything we know how to do every requirement that God has made our ask we've met that requirement and yet he lays silent come on he just won't answer uh oh now I could sit here and worry well maybe this wasn't for this congregation today but the very next thing he says is I'm sure I'm speaking to people this morning that has come to that place I don't know who you are today or maybe it's all of you somebody here this is for you you've done everything you were supposed to do you've made everything right you've put it before God and you've w did he said God I've done everything I know how to do and you're waiting for an answer you just don't hear from him well that's just me that's just you know that's so and so brother says I'm sure I'm speaking to people this morning has come to that place I've been there many times myself you mean to tell me a man that has seen seven continuous Visions right a man that you would walk up to him he knows your name he knows your address he seen you eating a Snickers bar with a a knife 30 years ago seen all these little things that you forgot about your life man See Vision after Vision after Vision here he is I'm sure I'm talking to some people know I'm talking about I been there myself Glory all right now you don't you know what I'll raise my hand I've been there too there's things I've prayed about and boom God gives an answer Supernatural things I could have never known on my own amen but there's things I've prayed about 5 years go by 6 years go by 10 years go by 14 years go by you're like Lord what's the answer right nothing yeah well I don't like that part God loves it he's got to get something out of this too you know this isn't a one-way thing he wants something too I want to see how they're going to be he said when I he said I've been there many times myself I went back and traced my life turn to every stone find I did something wrong I go confess it say Lord God I'll make it right and go do it then come back again say now Lord Thou Art God you'll answer me surely I've met every request that you required me to do every requirement I've met it and still he won't move oh my oh man that hurts seems notice seems to sit silent that's when you've got to be sure that he is [Music] God don't be discouraged the only thing is in your heart be certain of God brothers and sisters ask my message no matter what happens this week no matter what happens in the world no matter what happens to your church no matter what it is in uncertain times listen these are uncertain times but in uncertain times be certain of God when you're stuck you're not stuck you're waiting that's right brother you're not doing nothing I'm waiting it's a good one especially when you don't want to do something I'm just waiting amen listen you sometimes it looks listen if you're going to be still be still and know that he's God I'm just sitting here then be still and know that he's God and he's the same and he's faithful and he hears prayers and he answers his people he cares for his children even when you don't seem to hear what I love about this quote brother the r is talking about Elijah and the widow woman here's here's Elijah he's prayed there's no rain there won't be rain for three and a half years till I call for it he's not the brook Kidron he's getting fed by Ravens he's getting water down there the stream dries up right God says all right Elijah he wasn't wondering Elijah want you to go down to this city in zidon and Zera there's a widow woman there I have commanded her to bless you I have commanded her to bless you you know what's funny to me about that she didn't know that God had commanded her to bless him he goes down there he walks up the city Gates and she's coming out she's picking up some twigs getting ready to make her last meal she's got nothing she's fixing to die she didn't go out there bless God there's a commandment over my life God Is Spoken over my life great things the scripture Will Will hearken and tell people about my ex she wasn't thinking that she's thinking I'm getting ready to die I've got nothing left she gets out there grabs some sticks and here comes this hairy man yeah probably didn't shave very much out there on the bank Here Comes This hairy man oh Hey listen I'm thirsty get me a drink she said all right I'll do what you said oh and by the way make me some cakes sir you don't understand right clearly you're

make a meal I'm getting ready to make my last meal this is it right I got to go make this for my son and I all right you can do that see that you do it but first you can do that but first make me a cake as well for thus sayith the Lord the cruise will not run dry the barrel will not run empty till the day that I call for rain on the earth brother B said that's she didn't know it that's what she was waiting for thus sayith the Lord and when she heard thus sayith the Lord she went and made that cake and she found out the cruise never did run dry the barrel never did run empty cuz she followed the word of a Vindicated Prophet cuz there was a commandment over her life even when she didn't realize there was a commandment over her life the Commandment of God fulfilled God's will hallah you say I got children they're out there they're doing whatever seems like no improvement but there's a commandment over their life whether they realize it or not listen I'm going through the darkest trial my life I don't know how I'm going to make but there's a command it over your life Hallelujah be certain of God praise God what did Jesus say put first the king of God and his righteousness all these things will be that's what she did right you know I'm going to put God first right I haven't heard I don't know I don't know what I'm going to do but I know this I'm going to put God first I'll seek God's kingdom first I'll seek his righteousness and he so that's something we have to be actively engaged in seeking the kingdom not waiting for it to fall into our lap he's seeking like Daniel seeking all right Lord what do you have for all right Lord what's what is this about amen that's what Daniel was doing he was seeking amen when things are dark and desperate and you don't have an answer yet you're seeking God that's not the time to get discouraged that's the time to draw closer to him than you've ever been before bless the Lord and he might take you down to the very wire doing that he did that woman done it many times in the scripture amen I submit to you this this afternoon many times when our faith is tested and we get anxious we're tempted to doubt it's not our faith that's the problem that's what the devil said well you just don't have faith you don't believe well listen Daniel didn't hear for 21 days it wasn't a faith problem amen Faith should never be if if we're hearing the word of the Lord then Faith's not the issue because that's how faith comes by hearing the word of God Amen many Christians they think they're weak in faith maybe you get discouraged well maybe I'm just weak in faith that's not that we're weak in faith many times it's that we lack patience right many of the times our issue is not a lack of faith it's just a lack of patience well God I want to see an answer listen to God a day is like a thousand years a thousand years like a day he's not sweating it he's not sitting there I don't know how they're going to make it I don't know what they're going to do if this happens he's not the one worried about it he has long patience for the fruit of the Earth right see we just don't have patience and we think it's a lack of faith no you just be patient amen amen it's God patience requires you to operate without visible evidence like the farmer sometime amen well man I planted this three days ago I don't see anything it's cuz it doesn't come up that fast right the issue is not the seed the issue is quit and getting worried about it right just water it and let it grow it'll get there listen if if if you didn't believe that nobody would Farm nobody would do it well if I don't see something the first three days no one quits their job farming because of that they know if you wait long enough it will happen and listen his word is like a seed it will not go forth void it shall accomplish that which pleases him it will prosper in the thing where unto he sent it there is no word of God that is void of power there is no seed of God that will not bring forth after its own kind if you leave it planted if you water it amen the scripture tells through faith and patience we inherit the promises amen it's like I was saying at the beginning of the service so much so much of our Lives it's not it's not about what is or isn't it's our perspective you can look at this situation be like man I've waited a few days nothing's happening God must not care or man I haven't seen happen yet it must be a good one yeah this is going to be a good one when it finally happens oh it's going to be the testimony of testimonies man this is going to be big news Hallelujah wow they said Christ said he was coming quickly that's 2,000 years ago what an event it's going to be what a day it's going to be when it does what a meeting in the air we're going to have cuz it's not just going to be an Ephesian Church CH coming up it's epes SMA pergamos there's going to be seven whole churches what a day what a meeting listen it's getting bigger all the time on the living is not but overall it's getting bigger all the time it's all how you look at it brother man was over in Germany one time and he saw this painting he said it was some sort of award or something like that he said the picture it's a bunch of dark gloomy clouds just looks ominous spooky looks scary this angry storm comeing to tear things up said but you know when you get closer when you look at a little bit closer say it's not angry storm clouds it's the angels of God their wings are beating touching one another and they're crying out holy Hallelujah they're worshiping God see the picture was the same but when you look a little bit closer it's not scary it's the worship of God it's rejoicing it's the Praises of God and I was I was talking about this said you know when I got married my wife brought something into the mar she brought a lot of things I think she brought most of the good things in but she got a she got a picture Life Magazine 1963 and there's a ring of mystery that cloud in that Life Magazine listen science didn't know what it was politics didn't know what it was the religious world didn't know what it was but we knew brother bam said you turn it this way that's our Lord up there see it's how you look it changes your attitude towards it you see that say it's time this is the coming of the Lord this is a Vindicated message you see something [Applause] different oh my my this is not the time to say oh man things are getting worse and worse no it's birth pains see we've got a doctor he's made a diagnosis oh no it's birth pains it's getting ready to bring forth something that's why it's getting worse all the time amen a woman when she's in travail she's got sorrow but when that child comes there's joy because a son a man shout is coming to the earth oh man we're fixing the world's heading to tribulation the world's fall apart yeah and we're rising up we're heading into Glory we're heading into that sixth Dimension that seventh Dimension we're changing locations glory to God see people they look for different things even the message know brother was asked in 1964 they're look will the bride have a ministry will she do signs and wonders and Miracle now think about this here's somebody in brother Ram's meeting this is a guy that's done a couple Miracles will the bride have signs and wonders and miracles and things going on brother B says yeah it's going on right now right right well I just don't see it well you're blind right right or you're just you know you know what I'm saying well I don't see nothing happening well you're looking at the wrong [Music] thing why I just want to see God move like that well you're not looking at the right thing I see God move all the time I see him moving here right now if you can receive it God's moving right now in this place I know he's moving cuz he's in you people and you're all not just sitting there like you're breathing you're moving you've got a purpose you've got strength oh my my listen some people are looking for Revival brother talking about looking for hospitals to get emptied out and great big towns to come to Lord and get saved but brother R said that's not listen when the heavens are pardoned and stuff he said that's Moses and Elijah that's not us but brother doesn't say this he said the bride has thus saith the Lord and she knows what he wants done with it amen see Daniel saw his day and he knew what God wanted done with him cuz he understood amen yeah this is the time that spoken of the book of Hebrews when not only heaven and but Heaven and Earth they're both being shaken right but we have received a kingdom which cannot be removed therefore knowing that it's falling apart but knowing we're not therefore let us have Grace that we may serve God acceptably I love how Paul says this in first first Thessalonians the 5th chapter he says but over the times and the seasons Brethren see times and Seasons you have no need that I write unto you praise the Lord I'm glad today I don't have to explain to you that God has sent us a message you get that I don't have to explain that to you praise God that makes my job easier amen we're past that point we we know the time we understand understand the season we're in Paul said listen you don't need me to write that you understand the time and season that we're living in yourselves know perfectly talking about you all now go ahead praise the L ask me ask me yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say here's the campaign promises both sides when they shall say peace and safety sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon woman with child they shall not Escape but [Music] ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief oh he's coming like a thief yeah to them but not for you you know when he's [Applause] coming you're not in darkness that would take you as a thief of the night ye are the children of the light you are the children of the day we are not of the night oh somebody say that with me I am not of the night nor of Darkness oh my therefore let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that are drunken are drunken in the night but let us us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and for an Helm the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him wherefore in other words in light of all this wherefore Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also you do I like that since you know this don't be busy beating your brother up that's what the wicked servant did right he said my Lord delays is coming beat the other servants got drunk amen but since we know Comfort one another edify one another I love at the book of tells us that a word spoken in season how good it is in other words today's M Noah's message was good at Noah's day but it's not real good right now it's now it's not untrue it's just not relevant that's a buzz word Relevant Church that's good a word spoken in season if I come up and say you know I if I go up to brother Ben and I'm like hey you're a great hockey player and he's never played hock no it doesn't mean nothing I don't know why I picked hockey I'm trying to think something like what what's the one thing I could pick that nobody in Ohio would do so anyway you know if I go up it means not but it's a word spoken in season amen the message is not just a word from the Lord It's the word in season amen Isaiah 50:4 says the Lord God ha given me the tongue of the learn that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary amen listen we live in an hour where the love of many is waxed cold we see that in our politics we see that in our country we see it in the world Amen the love of men is waxed cold there are people in the world today they're dying for love brother bam said there are our young men are starved for a kind word from their parents our young women are are dying waiting for some sort of some sort of blessing from us amen praise the Lord glory to God prise the Lord listen we I love brother Dave Crest that that testimony there beginning service amen listen that that's I I love that amen people they reached out they said something we don't realize I think many times true amen oh Hallelujah listen I've had the privilege of preaching in many different places and many different time zones and and I've seen God do all kinds of things but some of the most miraculous things I've ever seen is me or maybe one of you somebody they go up and they say somebody maybe just a sister making something a meal to a church something or whatever Hey sister I just want you to know I always see you doing that and I really appreciate it it means a lot to me and that'll stick with them y a lot longer than the sermon that they just heard cuz nobody ever says anything nice to them that one kind word I've had people come at me you know brother you said this thing to me one day and it meant the world I don't remember saying it yeah I'm in somebody well hope hopefully hopefully people can relate to that right hopefully it's not always just harsh things we had to say right right amen listen we underestimate the power of a Kind word that's right right you say I don't what's this got to do with being Supernatural this and that because a word spoken in weird to a weary person in season is a blessing amen it's a good thing in a society in a culture in churches well we just don't do that anymore we're just indifferent True Praise the Lord well Hallelujah you know we we want to see all this Supernatural and God's going to speak well here we are you know we want to see these gifts and we want to see them operate and do this and a lot of times the reason a person wants it is they want to dress up their opinion as the will of God Amen Hallelujah somebody praise the Lord but the prophet says this say if you have perfect love you'd have perfect gifts he said I'd rather have a church that know one spiritual Supernatural thing but they have the love of God Amen cuz that'll bring gifts it'll bring manifestation it'll bring power amen I'm saying this for a reason amen if we have the love of listen I believe we're living in a Capstone age I believe it's a time of perfect love there's nothing going to take you over there but perfect love cuz that's all there is there if you don't have love get love don't worry about getting a Ministry or a following or an anoint get love cuz if you can't love your brother you sure don't need to prophesy to everybody you don't need to heal the sick cuz it's all going to be about you I don't have the quote in front of me you can go look it up brother B 1960 preaches about this in discernment of spirit get ready to have an election he said you know what if God brother B said if he showed me who was going to win this election he said but why would God do that that's just for my glory oh I know things and I see things yeah and you let me know it's all about you and it's all about you and you're so great amen but listen if you love your brother enough to send him a c send him a card say something nice to him if you can love him that much God can use that true amen why want God to use me in this great way and we won't do little things right like forgive one another be kindly affectionate to one another Well glory to God we always want these big things listen if you're not faithful in Little Things yeah right you won't be faithful in great things I'm saying all this for a reason amen I believe we're living at the time of the coming of the Lord the world's unaware and politics is unaware and governments are unaware and churches are unaware but we're not unaware he's not unrecognized here today we have recognized him he is in our midst he has appeared to us in these meanss he's performed his sign we've recognized our D's message and we understand he's appeared among us to bring us into that perfect love to bring us into Faith to take us in a Rapture Comfort yourselves together edify one another with this amen listen when we understand what's all about how that ought to throw us into action how that ought to soften our attitudes towards one another how it ought to renew our confidence today to press the battle you might have waited 21 days you might have waited 21 years years but God's the same yes he God is faithful you believe that today Comfort amen yourselves with these words amen listen God has not forsaken you no you are blessed you're chosen you're holy you're blameless you're accepted you're healed you're saved you're delivered stand to your feet today God being enourage to comfort one another amen praise God brother Bram said eternal life it's living for others now you could weaponize that you could say Hey brother I need a $100 well I don't feel like giving it to you well listen eternal life is living for others which means do what I want you could weaponize that and that would be wrong right but it's true that is what eternal life is living about amen I believe we're here today to be a help to one another because every joint supplies in the body under the edifying of itself in love amen and I want today to be and I want you today to be a help to one another amen and if you'll just put God first and be helped to one another amen that's where God can do things that defy your expectations defy your explanations amen we recognize that's what this day is about today when impossible things are possible you believe that let's just pray father in the name of Jesus Christ oh my what a blessed people we are we stand in a place like the Prophet Daniel seeing things that the World At Large has missed and as we stand here and we look upon it we recognize it for what it is Lord May our heart hearts desire may our [Music] Ambitions be unto you Lord to understand to to take thus say the Lord and and we know what to do with it it's not here today to destroy one another no it's not here today to promote one man's interpretation over another it's to take what he said and say what he said and live what he said believe it with all of our hearts if we can do that today if we we can encourage one another today to do that Lord I believe there's just such a great blessing in store Lord we've seen blessings and miracles but I believe The Best Is Yet To [Music] Come Oh Lord today there's some people here like that Widow they been waiting a long time oh God lord they might have waited a long time your Prophet had to wait men of God had to wait but Lord no matter where we're at today help us to remember be certain of God our certainty is in you today Lord we we

wait patiently let me be found praising you let me be found worshiping and believing if I wait another 30 years Lord if you come back and there's a pile of bones here let me go out believing I know you're faithful amen I know you're true yes oh Lord we thank you for it today praise the Lord bless your people we ask Hallelujah we give you the praise and glory in Jesus name amen God bless you we say do many times I question certain circumstances and things I could not [Applause] understand oh and many times and trials weakness blurs my vision and my frustration so out of oh but it's then I am
