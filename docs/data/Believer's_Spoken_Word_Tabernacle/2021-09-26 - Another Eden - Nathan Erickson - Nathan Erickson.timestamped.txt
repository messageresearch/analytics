[32:21] them and god blessed them and god said
[32:23] unto them be fruitful and multiply and
[32:26] replenish the earth and subdue it
[32:28] and have dominion over the fish of the
[32:30] sea and defile the air over every living
[32:32] thing that moveth upon the earth and god
[32:34] said behold i've given you
[32:37] every herb bearing seed which is upon
[32:38] the face of the earth every tree
[32:41] into which is the fruit of a tree
[32:42] yielding seed to you it shall be from
[32:44] meat and to every beast of the earth to
[32:46] every fowl of the air and to everything
[32:48] that creepeth upon the earth wherein
[32:50] there is life i have given every green
[32:52] herb for meat as and it was so and god
[32:54] saw everything that he had made and
[32:56] behold
[32:57] it was very good
[32:59] amen it was very good in the garden
[33:02] and the evening and the morning were the
[33:04] sixth day
[33:05] thus the heavens and the earth were
[33:06] finished all the host of them
[33:08] and on the seventh day
[33:10] god ended his work which he had made
[33:13] and he rested on the seventh day from
[33:15] all his work which he had made and god
[33:16] blessed the seventh day and sanctified
[33:18] it
[33:19] because in it he had rested from his
[33:21] work
[33:22] which god had created and made and these
[33:23] are the generations of the heaven and of
[33:25] the earth when they were created in the
[33:27] day that the lord god made the earth in
[33:28] the heavens
[33:30] and every plant to the field before it
[33:31] was in the earth every herb of the field
[33:33] before it grew
[33:35] for the lord god had not caused it to
[33:36] rain upon the earth and there was not a
[33:38] man
[33:39] to till the ground but there went up a
[33:41] mist from the earth and watered the
[33:42] whole face of the ground
[33:44] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[33:47] of the ground
[33:48] and he breathed into his nostrils the
[33:49] breath of life and man became a living
[33:52] soul that's what a real man an original
[33:55] creation
[33:56] is a living soul
[33:58] and the lord god planted a garden
[34:00] eastward in eden
[34:02] and there he put the man whom he had
[34:04] formed and out of the ground made the
[34:06] lord god to grow every tree that is
[34:07] pleasant to the sight and good for food
[34:10] the tree of life also in the midst of
[34:11] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[34:13] good and evil
[34:15] amen
[34:16] amen thank god for the reading of his
[34:18] word we're looking for
[34:19] another eden
[34:21] a beautiful place a hiding place
[34:23] a refuge a paradise

[34:44] and lord we we know that we are not
[34:47] satisfied with what this world has to
[34:49] offer
[34:50] but down on the inside there's a longing
[34:52] there's a desire
[34:54] lord there's a yearning for something
[34:56] more something original something
[34:58] beautiful oh god lord i pray as we would

[35:36] amen and and uh brother branham also was
[35:39] praying
[35:40] uh one time in a in a service in the
[35:42] message leadership and i like the way he
[35:45] brought this out just to kind of
[35:47] uh as a starting point for us he he said
[35:49] lord tender us
[35:51] bring us to realization of this insane
[35:53] age that we're living in
[35:56] granite god when we see young women
[35:57] caught up in the web of the devil
[35:59] young men with perverted minds children
[36:02] dope addicts cigarette smoking drinking
[36:04] immoral
[36:06] satan's eden
[36:08] satan's eaten he said god it took you 6
[36:10] 000 years according to the bible to
[36:11] build an eden and you put your son and
[36:14] his wife in there his bride to rule over
[36:16] it
[36:17] but satan came around and perverted it
[36:19] and now satan's had six thousand years
[36:22] to build his own intellectual eden
[36:25] through science and education and
[36:27] so-called intelligence and and he's
[36:30] built it into a mess of death oh god he
[36:32] said take us back
[36:34] to eden again
[36:35] take us back
[36:37] to eden again lord where there's no
[36:38] death where there's no sorrow amen how
[36:41] am i gonna help me preach this morning
[36:43] all right
[36:44] amen so we're preaching about another
[36:46] eden here and and i think that's uh
[36:48] something uh as we pray that we can
[36:50] relate to as christians that we find
[36:53] that this world that we're living in uh
[36:55] with all of its pleasures and all of its
[36:57] comforts and all of its uh you know and
[36:59] all of its conveniences and everything
[37:01] that we have in this modern day we find
[37:03] that yet there's something lacking
[37:05] there's something in the heart of the
[37:06] human being that's not satisfied with
[37:09] the state of the world human beings are
[37:11] not satisfied uh and the reason is we
[37:14] find that we are living in satan's eden
[37:16] we're living in satan's eden and it's
[37:17] such an age where it's come so far and
[37:20] it would seem like we have more than we
[37:22] ever have you know uh that we're that
[37:24] we're farther along than we've ever been
[37:26] and and uh we were just preaching a
[37:27] little bit to the church at home about
[37:29] this how that how that man has become so
[37:31] advanced and satan has built such a
[37:33] world and it's been built up to uh with
[37:35] such complexity and such advancements
[37:37] you know when
[37:38] and sometimes we take it for granted
[37:40] this just the conveniences of the age
[37:42] that we're living in you know when you
[37:44] got up this morning and hopefully you
[37:45] took a shower you know uh sometimes i uh
[37:48] the other day i was in a shower and i
[37:49] thought to myself that you know that 99
[37:52] of the human beings that have ever lived
[37:54] never had a hot shower in their life
[37:56] amen amen and so what a comfort it is
[37:58] what a what a convenience and what a
[38:00] pleasure it is the things that we have
[38:01] access to that we that we partake of
[38:04] every day you know and we take it for
[38:05] granted how that you know
[38:07] if you want to go if you want to go
[38:08] visit something that's 100 miles away
[38:10] you can jump in your automobile and you
[38:12] go hurdling down the road and a ton of
[38:14] of heavy metals you know and and and
[38:16] it's all powered by exploding dinosaur
[38:19] juice down in the gas tank you know and
[38:21] and then uh if if there's some
[38:23] information that you want you have
[38:24] access to all the knowledge of the human
[38:26] race because we taught rocks how to
[38:28] think you know and and what a world that
[38:30] we're living in it's come so far and we
[38:31] find that people are are more educated
[38:34] than they've ever been they're wealthier
[38:35] than they've ever been they have more
[38:36] conveniences than they've ever had they
[38:38] have maybe they're not healthier but
[38:40] they have better health care than
[38:41] they've ever had and and so we have all
[38:43] these things in this modern world and
[38:45] it's come to such a height and yet it
[38:47] does not satisfy we find that people are
[38:49] more miserable than they've ever been
[38:51] there's more depressions and anxieties
[38:53] and there's there's there's just so much
[38:55] sadness in this world and so much grief
[38:57] so much worry about the future what
[38:59] would it be what man has become so great
[39:01] and yet he's so unhappy in the position
[39:03] that he's in why because amen he's
[39:06] missing another eden is amen we find
[39:08] that satan's eden you know what uh
[39:10] brother brown preached the message of
[39:11] satan's eat and he preached a god of
[39:13] this evil age and it just struck me when
[39:14] i was studying it a while ago uh the the
[39:17] beautiful thing about it is because we
[39:19] struggle as human beings we're trying to
[39:21] fit in down here we're trying to carve
[39:23] out a life in this world and we wonder
[39:25] sometimes as christians why it seems
[39:27] like we just can't can't get where we're
[39:29] trying to get and we're trying to climb
[39:31] the ladder we're in the rat race we're
[39:33] in the cycle of this world and and
[39:35] wondering why there's no satisfaction
[39:37] i'll tell you why there's no
[39:38] satisfaction because it was not built
[39:40] for us
[39:41] satan's eden was not built with you in
[39:43] mind it was not uh
[39:45] your well-being was not his concern your
[39:47] satisfaction was not his concern don't
[39:49] worry uh young people when you look at
[39:51] this world and you don't find you feel
[39:53] like
[39:54] like you have no place here or you may
[39:56] not be able to find satisfaction here
[39:58] you won't amen because you don't belong
[40:00] to this world but the world was cr the
[40:02] world was perverted from the state of
[40:04] eden and it's been built up and satan
[40:06] has built his own eden but it's not for
[40:08] you it's for him it's not for your
[40:10] satisfaction it's for satan's glory it's
[40:12] for satan's pleasure and satan's
[40:14] perversion that's what it's built for
[40:16] you know and that's such a relief i
[40:18] think
[40:19] when we begin when we begin to ponder
[40:21] this and meditate upon this because we
[40:23] become we become disturbed as as
[40:26] christians because you know things don't
[40:28] seem to work out in this world the way
[40:30] that we ought to or we can't get the
[40:31] wealth that we want or the conveniences
[40:33] that we want or climb the ladder like we
[40:35] want but it's not for you amen amen now
[40:38] god will bless its people god will
[40:40] prosper them amen but the satisfaction
[40:43] of a christian is not in satan's eden
[40:45] it's from another world from another
[40:47] realm another dimension amen
[40:49] and so we find that it's a world of
[40:51] death
[40:53] people are on the outside they're more
[40:55] alive it would seem than they've ever
[40:56] been more lively they have a better life
[40:59] but on the inside people are dying
[41:02] dying on the inside we have the phrase
[41:03] dead on the inside it's what a
[41:05] description of the world that we're
[41:06] living in it's prophesied that it would
[41:08] be so amen uh uh uh that the the the
[41:11] bible says the love of many would wax
[41:13] coal amen we live in a world where we
[41:15] have where all of all of our
[41:17] socialization happens on social media
[41:19] platforms and things like that and it's
[41:21] quite it's quite a paradox how that we
[41:22] have more access to other people than
[41:24] we've ever had more convenience and yet
[41:26] we're more disconnected than we've ever
[41:27] been relationships are being eroded
[41:30] because it brings all this baggage of
[41:32] jealousy and competition and trying to
[41:34] present a life that's more than it is or
[41:36] impress somebody else and all these
[41:38] things amen there's just nothing about
[41:40] the structure of it the
[41:42] the design of it of satan's eden amen
[41:44] that's able to that is able to satisfy
[41:48] able to satisfy the soul and and the way
[41:51] that it kills the way that spiritual
[41:53] death kills is by exposure
[41:56] by exposure and that's that's really the
[41:58] problem that we're facing is we're we're
[41:59] in a world where everyone has a voice
[42:02] where every idea every opinion every
[42:04] concept every voice has a platform it
[42:06] has a it has an outreach and all day
[42:09] long in work and in school and as we go
[42:12] around this world we're bombarded day
[42:13] after day moment after moment every time
[42:16] you open your phone every time you drive
[42:18] past a billboard or or through the
[42:19] checkout every see satan is preaching to
[42:22] you
[42:23] satan's voices are are spreading his
[42:25] gospel and his narrative and
[42:28] and the messages of his world and and
[42:30] you know uh we were sharing with our
[42:32] young people that that's what really
[42:33] kills is the exposure because it's such
[42:35] a it's such a wasteland that we're
[42:37] living in there's these cold laodicean
[42:39] winds are blowing and it's just killing
[42:41] everyone amen no one seems to be able to
[42:43] survive the environment amen with a
[42:46] sinner and christian alike nobody's
[42:48] happy nobody's satisfied because of
[42:50] these winds that are blowing you know
[42:52] you know a a brother that's you know an
[42:55] outdoorsman maybe he likes camping or
[42:57] hunting or something like that you know
[42:58] that if you get out in the wilderness
[43:00] and into it it becomes a survival
[43:01] situation where you're out there in the
[43:03] elements you know something there's
[43:05] something that can kill you faster than
[43:07] hunger
[43:08] faster than faster than than thirst
[43:11] faster than a predator anything the
[43:12] thing that that you really have to be
[43:14] careful of is exposure because if you
[43:16] find yourself out in the elements and
[43:18] the cold winds begin to blow and you've
[43:20] got no shelter then you're not going to
[43:21] survive neither can a young person
[43:23] survive layout asea you can't survive
[43:25] the exposure the influences the voices
[43:28] all these things there's only one way to
[43:29] survive the exposure that's to get into
[43:31] the strong tower amen amen that's a
[43:34] hidden life in jesus christ that brother
[43:36] branham preached about amen is to is to
[43:39] escape this world there's got to be a
[43:41] place where you can get shut in and the
[43:43] world is shut out and it's the only way
[43:46] to survive satan's eden friends
[43:48] is to is to get into there into that
[43:51] shelter brother the bible says he's a
[43:53] strong tower and the righteous run into
[43:56] christ and they're safe amen there's a
[43:58] safe place there's a there is a refuge
[44:01] and that's what we're needing friends
[44:02] because we're all under the pressures of
[44:04] satan's eden
[44:05] amen we're feeling that pressure i don't
[44:07] have to explain it to you you're all
[44:09] very acquainted with what we feel in
[44:11] this world and the pressures of this
[44:12] world those cold winds are blowing amen
[44:15] but you know there's a place of refuge
[44:18] there's a place where you can let off
[44:20] the steam brother branham said he
[44:21] preached a message letting off the
[44:22] pressure and he used that scripture as
[44:24] his text that they that run the name of
[44:27] the lord is a strong tower they that run
[44:28] into it are safe he said you can go into
[44:30] that tower then you can let off the
[44:32] steam amen you can let off the pressure
[44:35] and that's that's really what it
[44:36] sometimes people wonder why we gather
[44:38] you know and and we worship god we get
[44:40] we get to church we hear the word and
[44:42] why we're so noisy all the time and why
[44:44] there's a shout why there's a dance why
[44:46] there's just
[44:47] why there's a release like that why
[44:49] because we're under pressure amen but we
[44:51] have a place we have a refuge there's a
[44:53] place the christian can go amen where
[44:56] they're shut in with god and the world
[44:57] is shut out
[44:58] amen and there you can rejoice you can
[45:01] worship you don't have to worry about
[45:02] anyone thanks because nobody's in there
[45:04] with you
[45:06] amen but it's a hidden life past the
[45:08] outer court past the inner court even of
[45:10] sanctification and through that triple
[45:12] veil into the holy of holies that's
[45:14] where god's presence is
[45:17] and that's available to the christian
[45:19] amen and that's what we need a hidden
[45:21] life in christ
[45:22] in that holy of holies you know satan's
[45:24] eden has everything to offer you but
[45:26] satisfaction
[45:28] that's the one thing he cannot offer you
[45:30] is something that will truly satisfy you
[45:32] why because satan's eating is built on
[45:34] substitutes
[45:35] amen that's that's what it's all built
[45:37] on you know
[45:38] the devil can't create
[45:41] so when the devil goes to build his eden
[45:43] he can't bring something new he can't
[45:44] bring something wonderful he can only
[45:46] take what god made set and make it worse
[45:48] amen and so it's an age of substitutes
[45:51] brother brown told kind of a humorous
[45:53] story about i guess i i looked it up
[45:55] it's it's an old brand of of of of soda
[45:58] that they used to sell
[46:00] and he passed a billboard said if you're
[46:02] thirsty say parfait parfait was this the
[46:05] brand if you're thirsty say parfait and
[46:07] that was that was the advertisement
[46:09] brother branham had said he was coming
[46:11] home from fishing down at the lake said
[46:13] he was so thirsty and he passed that
[46:14] sign said if you're thirsty say parfait
[46:17] and he he bought into the narrative he
[46:19] started to say parfait parfait
[46:22] parfait he said i got so parched he said
[46:24] i kept saying parfait my mouth got so
[46:26] dry till i couldn't even couldn't spit
[46:28] hardly anymore i was so thirsty he said
[46:31] it did not satisfy
[46:32] it didn't live up to the advertisement
[46:34] amen and he said you know you can drink
[46:37] cokes you can drink anything you want to
[46:39] he said there's nothing that will
[46:40] satisfy a thirst like a good cold stream
[46:43] of water
[46:44] that'll quench that thirst he said all
[46:46] these other things are substitutes
[46:48] and why would we want to take a
[46:50] substitute when there's a genuine
[46:52] baptism of the holy ghost
[46:54] that satisfies every fiber and longing
[46:57] in the human soul amen that's the
[47:00] experience brother that satisfies that
[47:02] holy thirst that's in you and it
[47:04] cleanses the lips amen amen you know
[47:07] satan's eden has always got a substitute
[47:09] for you if you want joy he's got drugs
[47:12] he's got alcohol he's got cigarettes
[47:14] well we don't have a lot of those things
[47:15] in the church but you know what we got a
[47:17] lot of we got a lot of entertainment
[47:18] it's another drug amen amen uh we've got
[47:21] we've got we've got a worldly musics and
[47:24] worldly fashions and just the culture
[47:26] that we're living in you know it's such
[47:28] a it's such a cycle this world how that
[47:31] you know uh uh when you take fashion
[47:33] fashion for instance you know because uh
[47:36] fashion makes a promise it makes an
[47:38] advertisement it says you know if you
[47:39] buy this type of clothing and if you
[47:42] watch this movie and if you get in on
[47:44] this joke and this reference and listen
[47:45] to this song and get in on this then the
[47:48] promise is you'll find acceptance
[47:51] you know because you'll be like
[47:52] everybody else but everyone else doesn't
[47:54] stay the same
[47:55] then the next week you gotta get the new
[47:56] outfit you gotta watch the new movie you
[47:58] gotta whatever it is and it's a cycle
[48:01] and you ever notice you're not allowed
[48:03] to stop
[48:04] but we're compelled we've got to consume
[48:06] we've got to keep buying we've got to
[48:08] keep partaking and and yet we never find
[48:11] satisfaction
[48:12] it's really cruel
[48:14] it's actually quite cruel and so we and
[48:17] and it's such a world until uh people
[48:19] are so unsatisfied until it's anything
[48:21] that can dull the pain
[48:23] of a normal life
[48:25] you know that's what entertainment is to
[48:26] people they you know they get a little
[48:28] shot in the arm of a of a show or
[48:30] or some kind of entertainment so that
[48:32] they can get to sleep at night to dull
[48:34] the pain you know young people some of
[48:36] satan's traps are so devious that their
[48:39] trap is not to destroy you
[48:41] but it's to make you settle for less
[48:44] is to make you settle for less and
[48:45] that's a picture of satan's eden
[48:47] substitutes
[48:48] substitutes now bear with me now we're
[48:50] just laying a foundation here but we
[48:52] find that there is a genuine
[48:54] there is a genuine and i've just come to
[48:56] realize and maybe it's maybe it's coming
[48:58] in closer to my middle age or something
[49:00] like that but i've come to become
[49:02] disenfranchised with this world and and
[49:04] you know i've found that it has not
[49:06] lived up to the advertisement you know
[49:08] the pleasures that are supposed to be
[49:10] there the wealth and the and the
[49:12] conveniences and the satisfactions and
[49:14] the joys and the pleasures
[49:17] it's never lived up to it amen but uh
[49:19] but god made a promise
[49:21] of a hiding place of a hidden life in
[49:23] christ of a of a condition that a
[49:26] believer can get to until it's not a
[49:28] manner that falls and then it goes stale
[49:30] but you can go all the way in to where
[49:32] you're shutting with god and it doesn't
[49:34] matter what the world's doing because
[49:35] you're in there with god alone
[49:38] amen and that lives up to the promise i
[49:40] have found a manna that doesn't go stale
[49:43] it's always fresh amen a life that can
[49:46] take you when you're dried out and burnt
[49:48] out and and it can bring life out of a
[49:50] dry branch bring forth fruit out of a
[49:53] dead life oh my
[49:54] it lives up
[49:56] it lives up to the advertisement but
[49:58] it's the world that we're living in it's
[50:00] the time for it it's the season for it
[50:02] and we should not be deceived by it we
[50:03] should expect it
[50:05] we should recognize it and recognizing
[50:06] your day brother brown i thought this
[50:08] was marvelous he said the devil has
[50:10] recognized that this is the time he can
[50:12] wreck women he can wreck the church
[50:15] he can wreck the people the devil
[50:16] recognizes it he knows what we've come
[50:18] to he recognizes that we're living in
[50:20] satan's eden it's the god of this evil
[50:23] age he's in full recognition of the day
[50:25] that we're living in the trouble is many
[50:27] times we don't realize and so we're
[50:29] trying to carve out some satisfaction
[50:31] down here or chase after something that
[50:34] that that is always fleeting and never
[50:35] obtained but the devil knows the day
[50:37] we're living in he knows he's got free
[50:39] reign to wreck people wreck marriages
[50:42] wreck churches wreck lives
[50:45] wreck hearts and that's what he's doing
[50:46] he's he's a lion roaming to and fro
[50:49] seeking to kill and to steal and destroy
[50:52] and he's taking full advantage
[50:54] of his day
[50:56] amen he's recognized it but god has
[50:59] recognized that there is a people on the
[51:01] earth that he predestinated to life
[51:04] and he recognized this is the time
[51:06] to send his message you know what it
[51:09] really comes down to the tree of
[51:10] knowledge gives us all these wonderful
[51:12] things and conveniences and pleasures
[51:14] but it it it it can it can comfort
[51:17] but it cannot satisfy the only thing
[51:20] that was meant to satisfy the human
[51:22] amen is the tree of life
[51:24] and so there is a life there is a life
[51:27] that we're predestinated to so the
[51:29] christian is separated from the world we
[51:31] know that we're to live a separated life
[51:33] we're to be a holy people right we're to
[51:35] be separated we're we're we're not
[51:37] partakers
[51:38] of this world and and uh but you know
[51:41] that separation is not just by religious
[51:43] rules or or by a tradition or b by
[51:46] what's taught from the church that we
[51:48] belong to it's much deeper than that you
[51:50] know we uh uh
[51:52] you know brother man preach a message
[51:53] god's word calls for a total separation
[51:56] from unbelief but could i just turn that
[51:58] this morning and make you
[51:59] possibly make you think about it a
[52:01] little bit different you know he's
[52:02] preaching this message and you know to a
[52:04] young man that's raised in the message
[52:06] ranks we have such a perception of the
[52:08] message as rules and it's regulations
[52:10] and it's things that are required of us
[52:13] things that are you know things that are
[52:14] demanded of us
[52:16] to to live this christian life a life
[52:18] that's separated from unbelief but could
[52:20] i could i could i rephrase it and say
[52:22] god's word offers a total separation
[52:25] from unbelief
[52:27] amen there's a life there's a there's a
[52:29] hiding place there's a hidden life in
[52:31] christ that is available to the believer
[52:33] and it's a wonderful thing to be shut
[52:35] off from the world and it no longer has
[52:38] rule over you it no longer has influence
[52:40] over you it no longer has control over
[52:42] you but you're free
[52:44] and you're shut in with god
[52:46] amen no one else can go in there with
[52:48] you
[52:50] it's got to be by a personal experience
[52:51] brother bram said man hasn't changed
[52:53] much amen ever since he left the garden
[52:55] of eden he's still wandering about in
[52:57] the world he's seeking pleasure
[52:59] he's restless
[53:00] he's never satisfied maybe this is
[53:02] resonating with somebody
[53:04] never satisfied you're never coming to
[53:06] any right conclusions never finding
[53:08] rest
[53:09] he's just about in the same condition he
[53:11] was when he left god in the garden
[53:14] and he went out to shift for himself and
[53:16] he's been shifting ever since
[53:18] and he finds it's a rough way to go
[53:20] it's a hard life
[53:21] it's a hard life in the outer court
[53:24] you know where you're just trying to
[53:25] trying to make a public show like all
[53:27] the pharisees and the rich men and all
[53:29] that and just trying to you know trying
[53:31] to trying to be somebody in the
[53:32] neighborhood and
[53:34] be somebody in society it's a hard life
[53:36] but then even when you come beyond the
[53:38] outer court into the inner corner of
[53:39] sanctification you join a church you god
[53:41] reforms your life your desires change
[53:43] even in things and you you adopt the
[53:46] christian life and yet you find you find
[53:48] that there's still something lacking
[53:50] because you know what you found you
[53:51] found religion
[53:53] you found religion and it and it and
[53:55] religion cannot satisfy traditions of a
[53:57] church can't satisfy what mommy or daddy
[53:59] believe what the pastor is preaching
[54:01] cannot satisfy
[54:03] but there's another court
[54:05] there's another life there's another
[54:07] state the bible called it a new and
[54:08] living way where you can go even past
[54:10] sanctification past the priests the
[54:12] preachers the the potentates the
[54:14] presbyters and the prophets and get into
[54:17] an inner court where it's just you in
[54:18] the shekinah glory
[54:21] amen then you won't be shifting anymore
[54:23] then you won't be wandering and restless
[54:25] anymore
[54:26] oh my come in there
[54:29] get into there hey man there's a lot we
[54:30] could say on that subject but we're
[54:31] trying to rush through and just lay this
[54:33] foundation i know we're taught these
[54:35] things about the three courts and stuff
[54:37] amen but you see it's most of the issues
[54:40] that we're facing here
[54:42] as christians is because the root of it
[54:44] usually is because we're chasing
[54:46] substitutes
[54:48] instead of that hidden manna that's
[54:50] beyond the veil you go after some man
[54:52] out here even after really even you know
[54:54] manna types the holy ghost and you can
[54:57] go to a meeting go to church on sunday
[54:59] and just get just get uplifted you know
[55:01] and get a manna but unless you're in
[55:02] there with god unless you've got a
[55:04] hidden life with christ that man will go
[55:05] stale monday morning hits and everything
[55:08] you had on sunday falls apart amen oh
[55:10] but there's more there's more for the
[55:12] believer amen you know the brother
[55:14] branham brother man
[55:16] had a word for it he said it was there's
[55:18] a there's a state of christianity said
[55:20] where you've got just enough religion to
[55:22] make you miserable
[55:23] now can you imagine that now but but i
[55:26] think somebody who's been in that that
[55:28] that wilderness of sanctification could
[55:30] relate to that where you've got just
[55:32] enough religion just enough of the truth
[55:33] just enough an understanding of what's
[55:35] right and what's wrong but you're
[55:36] miserable
[55:37] amen and we lose many of our people from
[55:39] our churches because they spend years in
[55:42] that misery
[55:43] on the border on the outskirts in an
[55:46] outer court and they're miserable and
[55:48] they assume that everyone else is as
[55:50] miserable as them amen young people make
[55:53] the assumption that because they're
[55:54] struggling because they're unhappy
[55:56] because they're unsatisfied that
[55:57] everybody else must be feeling the same
[55:59] and everybody and and they they decide
[56:01] that it's easier to believe everyone
[56:03] else is hypocrites and making it up but
[56:05] friends could i get a witness today amen
[56:07] maybe an old saint or even a young
[56:09] person with a real experience there's a
[56:11] deeper walk there's a there's an inner
[56:13] court there's a holy of holies
[56:15] experience and in there it's not misery
[56:18] in there brother brown said are the
[56:20] pleasures of god the glories of god
[56:24] it's a reality it's available
[56:26] but you've got to get in there and the
[56:28] thing about in there it doesn't matter
[56:30] in there what church you belong to who
[56:31] your pastor is what your parents taught
[56:33] you how you were raised what your
[56:34] opinions are your background all that
[56:36] all that has to go away because when you
[56:38] go in there nobody goes with you but if
[56:41] you walk alone boldly enter behind the
[56:43] veil amen to face the shekinah face to
[56:47] face
[56:48] and have communion with him between the
[56:50] wings of the cherubim
[56:52] and there's a real experience for you my
[56:54] brother my sister
[56:56] if you're wondering if you're shiftless
[56:58] amen there's a reality
[57:01] hallelujah and that's what we want
[57:03] that's what we're longing for that's the
[57:04] only thing that will satisfy that's why
[57:06] christians are separated from the world
[57:08] not interested so much in what's
[57:10] happening in the world but they're
[57:12] interested in being in there with god i
[57:14] like the way brother graham said oh he
[57:16] said may we remember in our minds as we
[57:18] walk upon the street we begin to rub
[57:20] arms with the world we're not supposed
[57:21] to be like those
[57:23] amen we step aside we give them the
[57:25] place
[57:26] we give them the place amen lord in
[57:28] their it's their rightful position here
[57:31] on earth there's plenty of people out
[57:32] here they're in their rightful position
[57:34] they're living all the life that they've
[57:36] ever had let them be as happy as they
[57:38] can while they're here amen but i'm not
[57:40] from here
[57:42] hallelujah i don't belong here so what
[57:45] what brother bran said we'll take the
[57:46] back seat amen take the backseat let
[57:49] them let them have their politics let
[57:51] them have their economies let them have
[57:53] their governments let them have their
[57:54] cultures and their fashions and their
[57:56] entertainments we'll take a back seat
[57:58] and one of these days brother we'll
[58:00] exchange that back seat for a throne
[58:02] amen why because we're in there with god
[58:04] between we're in the ark
[58:06] hallelujah we're shut off from this
[58:08] world we don't belong to it we're not
[58:10] going to burn with it
[58:12] we're not going to suffer with it
[58:14] oh hallelujah we're sheltered from it
[58:16] we're not part of leodacya we're not
[58:18] under its rebuke we're in a bright age
[58:21] we're in an inner court
[58:23] we're in we're back there behind the
[58:25] veil that's where you are
[58:27] amen that's where you are this world's
[58:29] got its programs its ideas its ambitions
[58:32] we'll take the back seat
[58:34] hallelujah this world's coming to an end
[58:36] friends
[58:37] but we're from the beginning
[58:39] we're from the beginning
[58:41] you know brother brand preached the
[58:42] message from the beginning it was not so
[58:44] and he talks about this this collapse of
[58:46] eden you know he says that everything
[58:48] man touches he perverts it
[58:50] how you know how god made a man to be
[58:52] happy and
[58:54] man man brings in misery and things god
[58:56] man to be made a man to be moral he said
[58:58] man
[58:59] god made men to be brothers one to
[59:01] another man makes them enemies you know
[59:03] man
[59:04] god made man to be
[59:06] true to his wife and man man-made
[59:09] immorality man all these things
[59:10] everything that we touch as human beings
[59:13] everything that that this world
[59:15] tries to build it ultimately it fails it
[59:17] comes to an end it doesn't satisfy
[59:20] amen and and all this has a purpose
[59:23] it has a purpose because it's drawing a
[59:25] contrast now he said in doing so we find
[59:28] it in the church these things have taken
[59:29] place men have begun to tamper with the
[59:31] things of god
[59:33] he draws his conception what it means he
[59:35] doesn't just take it the way it's
[59:36] written but it's his own idea mixed into
[59:38] it
[59:40] now we've got to be careful now
[59:42] amen because we say yeah i know brother
[59:43] nathan those denominations they're
[59:45] teaching trinities you know and they're
[59:47] teaching baptism holy ghost by speaking
[59:50] in time they're teaching all those all
[59:51] these things that aren't scriptural all
[59:52] this is going on now we are aware of
[59:54] that brother nathan but i'm talking
[59:55] about right here and believers spoken
[59:58] word word tabernacle in your pew
[1:00:00] amen in your home
[1:00:02] amen when when it comes to a place of
[1:00:04] what are you going after
[1:00:06] are you trying to are you trying to take
[1:00:09] your ideas which are worldly because you
[1:00:11] are worldly you're fleshly you're fallen
[1:00:13] your flesh your mind all these things
[1:00:15] are not redeemed amen but yet we're
[1:00:18] trying to build a palace of our own
[1:00:20] opinions and our own ideas and and we're
[1:00:22] really really concerned with our
[1:00:24] background and the way we've always
[1:00:25] thought about it and our worldview and
[1:00:27] the way you know the way the way our dad
[1:00:29] talked about it or the old path whatever
[1:00:31] it is
[1:00:32] amen i would take that instead of take
[1:00:34] the word of god
[1:00:35] and that's where the problem starts
[1:00:37] friends because god has made a way
[1:00:40] god has provided a way
[1:00:42] amen behind that veil
[1:00:45] amen don't oh my that's where you get
[1:00:47] just enough religion to make you
[1:00:49] miserable because
[1:00:52] a man-made religion whether it's a
[1:00:53] denomination or it's one person with a
[1:00:55] sticky opinion
[1:00:56] amen is it is a covering
[1:00:59] it's fig leaves
[1:01:01] like they had in the garden of eden they
[1:01:02] tried to they had their own idea of how
[1:01:04] they should be covered they had fig
[1:01:05] leaves
[1:01:06] amen that was a cane idea amen didn't
[1:01:09] work
[1:01:10] amen didn't work didn't cover couldn't
[1:01:12] hide them couldn't cover their shame
[1:01:14] friends but god made a covering god by
[1:01:17] the lamb shed his blood amen that he
[1:01:20] could take the veil amen that we were
[1:01:22] once shut out of and rip it from the top
[1:01:25] to the bottom so that a christian by the
[1:01:27] by god's provided way by the word that
[1:01:29] he spoke not your thought about it or my
[1:01:31] thought but by his word we could boldly
[1:01:33] enter
[1:01:34] amen before the throne
[1:01:37] between the wings of the cherubim amen
[1:01:39] are you are we on the same page this
[1:01:40] morning amen let's move right along but
[1:01:42] see man's always tampering always
[1:01:44] tampering with the word of god
[1:01:46] and
[1:01:48] brother brown said at the nicene council
[1:01:49] that's what happened the pentecostal
[1:01:51] church he said fell at nicaea
[1:01:53] because they swapped the word of god for
[1:01:55] the wisdom and culture of man
[1:01:59] now isn't that something see it's not
[1:02:01] always the doctrine it's not always the
[1:02:03] denominational it's not always the creed
[1:02:05] you know or the system or the pope or
[1:02:07] something like that sometimes it's the
[1:02:09] culture that's the problem
[1:02:11] sometimes it's christians trying to be
[1:02:14] part of a world part of a culture part
[1:02:16] of a society or a way of thinking that
[1:02:19] we were never meant to be a part of
[1:02:21] and that becomes the problem the culture
[1:02:23] isn't that wonderful and he said that's
[1:02:25] the same thing lucifer did in the garden
[1:02:27] of eden and they died right there the
[1:02:28] pentecostal church died at nicaea but
[1:02:31] it's to be resurrected in the bride tree
[1:02:34] in the last days it's to be resurrected
[1:02:36] now brother man is preaching this uh
[1:02:38] that was christ the mystery but we we
[1:02:40] referenced there in the beginning it was
[1:02:42] not so and i want to pick up something
[1:02:44] there that i thought was marvelous how
[1:02:45] brother brahms said uh brother brahms
[1:02:47] was is preaching this he quotes jesus
[1:02:50] how how how here's men and they have
[1:02:52] tried to build their own life
[1:02:54] in the world
[1:02:56] they've they've taken the word the
[1:02:58] pharisees had taken the word that came
[1:03:00] by the prophets they took the message
[1:03:02] they took the word
[1:03:03] and then they mixed it with the
[1:03:04] economies of the world the politics of
[1:03:06] the world the culture of the world the
[1:03:08] wealth of the world and all these things
[1:03:10] and they were trying to have a hybrid
[1:03:12] religion that would be that would you
[1:03:14] know pay respect to god but be
[1:03:16] comfortable with the culture
[1:03:19] comfortable with the world that would
[1:03:20] somehow be compatible with the world
[1:03:22] brother and jesus said in it's in vain
[1:03:25] he said in vain you worship me teaching
[1:03:28] for doctrine the commandments of men he
[1:03:30] said what you're trying to build young
[1:03:32] man young woman you're trying to build a
[1:03:34] life you're trying to build a religion
[1:03:36] you're trying to have a church
[1:03:37] experience where you can be just but
[1:03:39] where you can be part of a church but
[1:03:41] also part of the world that your
[1:03:43] interest you know you can pay lip
[1:03:45] service to the word of god but your
[1:03:46] interests are in the world your love is
[1:03:48] for the world it cannot mix amen
[1:03:51] it won't work
[1:03:53] he said in vain you worship me and i
[1:03:55] think that's quite we know about satan's
[1:03:57] eden brother branham taught us how that
[1:03:58] how that many people think they're
[1:04:00] worshiping god but they're really
[1:04:01] worshiping the devil we're well taught
[1:04:02] we know about anointed ones at the end
[1:04:04] time and those things but i thought it
[1:04:05] was marvelous and in the beginning it
[1:04:06] was not so brother ram said you there's
[1:04:09] actually possible according to what
[1:04:10] jesus said for someone to worship jesus
[1:04:14] christ
[1:04:15] but in vain
[1:04:17] to worship jesus christ
[1:04:20] but in vain
[1:04:22] and i want to get real sober here
[1:04:24] amen to to maybe maybe to prick a heart
[1:04:27] amen that it is possible to live a life
[1:04:30] where you're worshiping god but it's not
[1:04:33] working for you
[1:04:35] it's not working out
[1:04:36] you're not satisfied
[1:04:38] you've got just enough religion
[1:04:41] to make you miserable
[1:04:44] there's more for you
[1:04:46] there's more for us
[1:04:48] amen there's see that that's the same
[1:04:50] spirit that's killed every church every
[1:04:52] denom every movement every message god's
[1:04:54] ever sent died out in that religious
[1:04:57] death
[1:04:58] and now brother braham said the last
[1:05:00] plague to fall on the world would be a
[1:05:01] spiritual death and it's worse now than
[1:05:03] it's ever been people are less more more
[1:05:05] irreligious more unhappy more worldly
[1:05:08] more carnal than they've ever been and
[1:05:12] this world's doing its best to drag you
[1:05:14] into that
[1:05:15] hallelujah but right at the time of
[1:05:18] spiritual death brother brown said he
[1:05:20] said that this church will be
[1:05:21] resurrected
[1:05:23] hallelujah oh he said arise shine thy
[1:05:25] light it has come he said that this
[1:05:27] brine
[1:05:28] has been resurrected out of
[1:05:30] denominational darkness amen there's a
[1:05:32] word that's been spoken over you amen to
[1:05:35] to bring you something that religion
[1:05:37] can't give you to give you something
[1:05:39] don't ever don't ever mistake this
[1:05:41] message as a new creed or a slightly
[1:05:43] better church with slightly better
[1:05:44] doctrine or a certain way of thinking or
[1:05:46] some man's opinion amen or brother
[1:05:49] branham's opinion it is a word of light
[1:05:51] that can shine down in your darkness
[1:05:54] hallelujah and raise you up out of
[1:05:56] satan's eden and put you in another
[1:05:58] realm
[1:06:00] it's another world it's another reality
[1:06:03] it's another body
[1:06:06] another dimension
[1:06:08] hallelujah it's real oh glory to god
[1:06:11] amen
[1:06:13] amen it can put you right back in an
[1:06:15] eating condition
[1:06:16] now that's an awful big statement
[1:06:19] that's an awful big statement but here's
[1:06:20] the quote amen
[1:06:22] hallelujah uh uh but oh let me let me
[1:06:24] get this first brother brother brandon
[1:06:26] preach that it was not so from the
[1:06:27] beginning you know this here's what i
[1:06:28] think is wonderful
[1:06:30] is i i i a
[1:06:32] is he preached that on the tail end of a
[1:06:34] little series he started a series
[1:06:36] on why we're not a denomination
[1:06:39] and that quite wonderfully he references
[1:06:40] it in the message here he preaches why
[1:06:43] we're not a denomination and the first
[1:06:44] thing he wants you to think about after
[1:06:47] explaining to us why we're not a
[1:06:49] denomination why we don't go after
[1:06:51] creeds why we don't just join a church
[1:06:53] why it can't just be shaking the
[1:06:54] pastor's hand why it's got to be a real
[1:06:56] individual experience of god he teaches
[1:06:58] us those things and the very first thing
[1:07:00] that comes from the from the throne
[1:07:02] after why we're not a denomination is it
[1:07:04] was not so
[1:07:06] from the beginning
[1:07:07] in the beginning it wasn't so friends
[1:07:09] and that's the key right there in the
[1:07:11] beginning it was not so it was not man
[1:07:14] and world
[1:07:15] in the beginning it was not man and the
[1:07:18] church that he belongs to it was not man
[1:07:20] and the people he socialized with it was
[1:07:22] not man and the and the and the name uh
[1:07:25] that uh calling himself a message
[1:07:27] believer calling himself an american or
[1:07:29] calling himself a christian even it's
[1:07:31] it's not it's not man and and that in
[1:07:34] the beginning it was man and god
[1:07:37] man and god god and his son god and his
[1:07:40] daughter alone in the garden in the
[1:07:42] beginning that's what it was that's why
[1:07:44] we're not in denomination amen not so
[1:07:46] that we could feel superior to some
[1:07:48] other church or some other group or
[1:07:50] somebody who puts a different name on
[1:07:51] their sign by the road amen no we are
[1:07:54] not a denomination because in the
[1:07:56] beginning there were no churches there
[1:07:58] were no gatherings of people there were
[1:08:00] no movements there was no cultures and
[1:08:02] creeds it was god
[1:08:05] and man
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:07] just you and god walking
[1:08:11] and talking
[1:08:13] and nobody else can be there with you
[1:08:16] that's what it means to be in that holy
[1:08:17] of holies shutting with god amen where
[1:08:20] the man is always fresh that's what that
[1:08:22] experience is
[1:08:23] when it's not about the church anymore
[1:08:25] let the church do what it wants to if
[1:08:26] the church closes the doors if your
[1:08:28] family walks away if your best friends
[1:08:30] reject you whatever it is
[1:08:32] it's not hinged on those people
[1:08:36] has nothing to do with that it's you and
[1:08:38] god
[1:08:39] only you can answer whether you've gone
[1:08:41] in there
[1:08:42] amen only you
[1:08:44] only you could look on the inside and
[1:08:46] and be honest with yourself and say you
[1:08:48] know
[1:08:49] you know i think if if
[1:08:51] if if if everyone else walked away and
[1:08:54] it was up to me
[1:08:55] i don't know if i would stand
[1:08:58] i don't know if i've really experienced
[1:09:01] that reality i don't know if i'm in
[1:09:03] there brother nathan
[1:09:05] but if you're in there
[1:09:07] you know
[1:09:09] you know
[1:09:11] brother branham said when a man is born
[1:09:14] again with the spirit of god
[1:09:16] god's spirit dwells in him now
[1:09:19] now he said he can let that spirit grow
[1:09:22] so this is something a little bit more
[1:09:23] than a new birth
[1:09:24] but let that new birth begin to bring a
[1:09:26] change in your life let god's power to
[1:09:28] transform begin to work in your life
[1:09:30] what is it bringing us to
[1:09:32] where is the bride of jesus christ you
[1:09:34] ever wonder
[1:09:35] maybe we need to ask ourselves some time
[1:09:37] what is god doing right now
[1:09:39] with the bride with the message with the
[1:09:41] word what's happening brother graham
[1:09:43] said let that let that spirit grow it
[1:09:45] takes out roots of bitterness it presses
[1:09:47] god's way through
[1:09:48] that person he said let the holy spirit
[1:09:50] take that man
[1:09:51] and here's a powerful statement and he
[1:09:53] can become back in the same condition he
[1:09:56] was in in the garden of eden
[1:10:00] now that's not talking about a
[1:10:02] millennial reign
[1:10:03] that's not talking about the other side
[1:10:05] of a rapture it's not amen is talking
[1:10:07] about a condition that a believer can
[1:10:09] come to with christ where the holy ghost
[1:10:12] has preeminence in a human being it puts
[1:10:14] him right back in an eating condition
[1:10:16] friends i'm not doing away with a body
[1:10:17] change we know that we're not doing away
[1:10:19] with the corporal coming up but we
[1:10:21] believe that right now amen i believe
[1:10:23] that right now the holy spirit is moving
[1:10:25] in the bride of jesus christ and it's
[1:10:27] taking her to a condition until
[1:10:30] so where she's separated from satan's
[1:10:32] eaten and she's gone right back to her
[1:10:35] original condition the original seed has
[1:10:39] borne fruit in the bright tree amen and
[1:10:41] we're all we can feel the cool breeze of
[1:10:44] eden amen as we fellowship with him
[1:10:46] along the way
[1:10:48] glory be to god right back into the
[1:10:50] condition of the garden of eden now what
[1:10:52] does that look like brother man says
[1:10:53] verily i say unto you you say to this
[1:10:55] mountain be moved see your your voice
[1:10:57] the brother said recently your mountain
[1:10:59] your voice i think that's wonderful
[1:11:01] your voice over your mountain be moved
[1:11:04] and don't doubt in your heart believe
[1:11:05] what you said he said then you can have
[1:11:07] what you said now what brother bran said
[1:11:09] that puts man supreme again
[1:11:12] it puts him right back in the condition
[1:11:15] how do if adam could speak to a tree or
[1:11:18] speak to the wind and say wind be still
[1:11:20] blow the other way you tree get up and
[1:11:22] move over here friends what do you think
[1:11:24] the third poll is
[1:11:26] what do you think the spoken word is
[1:11:28] that has been that has been it's not
[1:11:30] just for a prophet it's for the bride of
[1:11:32] jesus christ what does it mean it means
[1:11:34] we're back to eden again it means when
[1:11:36] you speak to your mountain when you
[1:11:38] speak to your situation
[1:11:40] when you got the holy ghost brother
[1:11:42] there's a supreme authority until your
[1:11:44] word is an adam word it's an eden word
[1:11:49] that's real
[1:11:50] that's what the holy ghost wants to
[1:11:52] bring us to right back in the condition
[1:11:54] that's why power comes by the holy ghost
[1:11:56] it's the power of adam's covenant
[1:11:58] if he could speak to the wind you can
[1:11:59] speak to your storm
[1:12:01] amen the third poll you ever think about
[1:12:02] the third poll and this power that
[1:12:04] brother branham is explaining to us why
[1:12:07] would god share that sovereign power
[1:12:08] with a mortal man
[1:12:11] must be that he wants them to have it
[1:12:17] why would god share brother brown would
[1:12:18] say such amazing things about man being
[1:12:20] omnipotent when a man has faith in his
[1:12:22] creator to omnipotence meat and that
[1:12:25] omnipotent power brings results it's a
[1:12:27] master of circumstances that fate that
[1:12:29] spoken word has a absolute power behind
[1:12:31] it her name on the check is just as good
[1:12:33] what's going on friends somebody's going
[1:12:35] back to eden amen somebody there's a
[1:12:38] people it's not for the whole world it's
[1:12:39] not for the charismatics that talk about
[1:12:41] power every day and
[1:12:43] and and and they're all in fanaticism
[1:12:45] and it's not for this world it's not for
[1:12:47] its churches it's for the bride of jesus
[1:12:49] christ to put a adam word back in her
[1:12:52] mouth
[1:12:53] amen a word of power
[1:12:56] a word of authority
[1:12:58] hallelujah oh
[1:13:00] he and he wants her to have it
[1:13:03] the oh brother bram said the bride has
[1:13:05] the word of god and she also knows what
[1:13:07] he wants done with the word
[1:13:09] amen so he didn't just give you this
[1:13:11] power he knew that you'd know how to use
[1:13:13] it he knew that you know you know how to
[1:13:16] exercise it he knew what she would be he
[1:13:18] wanted you to have it he wanted this to
[1:13:20] happen
[1:13:21] amen let's bring this out now talking
[1:13:23] about brother man speaking about the
[1:13:24] love that he had for the human race but
[1:13:26] he had to see them separated from him
[1:13:28] that fellowship that he had with his
[1:13:30] children in the garden of eden now he
[1:13:32] said he and in that heartbroken
[1:13:34] condition
[1:13:36] that he's had to be all this time
[1:13:39] because his word said the day you eat
[1:13:40] thereof that day you die when god cast
[1:13:43] adam out of the garden god it was not it
[1:13:46] was not an angry god withholded arms it
[1:13:49] was not a god said well you should have
[1:13:50] listened you deserve what you deserve
[1:13:53] the judgment that came to you it was not
[1:13:54] a god like that this god has been
[1:13:57] heartbroken ever since his children left
[1:13:59] the garden
[1:14:01] it's what he wants it's what he desires
[1:14:04] friends that's why he made a new
[1:14:06] covenant he sent jesus with a new
[1:14:08] covenant that whosoever liveth and
[1:14:10] believeth in me he'll never die
[1:14:13] amen he overruled
[1:14:15] the day you eat the thereof this day
[1:14:17] he'll die but then he made a new
[1:14:18] covenant believe in me you'll never die
[1:14:21] because that's what he wants
[1:14:23] amen that how could we as backsliders
[1:14:25] say i wonder if the lord wants me back
[1:14:27] maybe he's done with me maybe i've
[1:14:28] sinned away my day of grace don't you
[1:14:30] just don't understand the heart of god
[1:14:32] for his children ever since you left his
[1:14:35] fellowship he's been broken-hearted
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:40] sent preacher after preacher after you
[1:14:42] song after song
[1:14:44] you're trying to go to bed at night and
[1:14:45] a scripture pops in your mind what is
[1:14:47] it's a heartbroken savior calling you
[1:14:49] and pulling you trying to bring you back
[1:14:51] to fellowship
[1:14:53] that's what he wants
[1:14:54] eden was not your idea nor was it mine
[1:14:57] it was in his mind
[1:14:58] to make a garden for his people
[1:15:01] he desires the fellowship
[1:15:03] amen so if you're running from god
[1:15:05] brother sister amen
[1:15:08] you're not bothering god asking him to
[1:15:10] come back
[1:15:11] you're only submitting to his desire for
[1:15:14] you
[1:15:16] eden is what he wants
[1:15:18] and he's building us a future home
[1:15:20] brother ram said it's a revelation
[1:15:22] it's as eternal as god's word is eternal
[1:15:25] the threefold purpose god's great
[1:15:27] mystery is this
[1:15:28] god manifested in christ
[1:15:32] christ manifested in the church
[1:15:35] in order to redeem the lost eve back
[1:15:38] to the original condition in the garden
[1:15:41] of eden
[1:15:43] see that that's not my hope
[1:15:46] that's not our dream that's not our
[1:15:49] imagination a figment
[1:15:51] that's not our idea of
[1:15:53] a you know of a of a kind loving god
[1:15:56] that makes us feel comfortable makes us
[1:15:57] feel happy
[1:15:58] that is the
[1:16:00] revelation
[1:16:01] of god's great purpose
[1:16:03] why that god would pour himself into his
[1:16:05] son
[1:16:06] and then why he would take what was in
[1:16:08] his son and pour it into the church what
[1:16:10] he's trying to do friends he's trying to
[1:16:12] get you back to eden
[1:16:14] he's trying to bring you home
[1:16:16] trying to bring us back to fellowship
[1:16:18] it's what he wants
[1:16:20] and then oh
[1:16:22] and it's so wonderful when he gets what
[1:16:23] he wants
[1:16:24] in christ the mystery he continues said
[1:16:26] he's that seed
[1:16:28] the woman's seed he's the tree of life
[1:16:31] how many know that the tree of life is
[1:16:32] christ
[1:16:33] we're taught these things but that tree
[1:16:35] of life he said he had to be chopped
[1:16:37] down and put on a tree of disgrace
[1:16:39] cursed this he that hang on a tree he
[1:16:41] became a curse
[1:16:43] and now what happens to that tree of
[1:16:45] life
[1:16:46] now see now through that he brings forth
[1:16:49] a bride tree what is that bride tree
[1:16:51] which will be the tree of life restored
[1:16:55] back to him
[1:16:57] amen as husband and wife in the garden
[1:17:00] of eden he said oh brother gets excited
[1:17:02] oh glory to god by the same word and the
[1:17:04] same god made manifest in husband and
[1:17:06] wife
[1:17:07] the same bride tree back again friends
[1:17:10] amen as a member of the bride of jesus
[1:17:12] christ you're not part of this world
[1:17:15] you're not a fruit off of the tree of
[1:17:16] knowledge of good and evil but what
[1:17:18] happened was the tree of life himself
[1:17:21] came in the original seed form of the
[1:17:23] lord jesus christ and he suffered and
[1:17:26] died and went into the ground amen so
[1:17:28] that it would spring forth a new tree
[1:17:31] but it wouldn't be a new tree it'd be
[1:17:32] the same life in a new tree
[1:17:35] hallelujah and the devil hated that tree
[1:17:38] he sent pestilence after pass after
[1:17:40] insect after bug after false doctrine
[1:17:43] after church split after politics after
[1:17:46] wars and and and
[1:17:48] and tribulations he sent everything he
[1:17:50] could to chew that tree back down to the
[1:17:52] root but the life in that tree can never
[1:17:55] perish because it's a greater life than
[1:17:57] the tree of knowledge it's a greater oh
[1:18:00] it's greater than good greater than evil
[1:18:02] it's the tree of life
[1:18:04] and now it's come forth and it's put
[1:18:06] forth branches it's put forth fruit in
[1:18:09] spite of everything the devils
[1:18:11] come and that tree is you friends the
[1:18:14] bride of jesus christ is more than a
[1:18:16] church more than a creed more than a
[1:18:18] culture but she is the very tree of life
[1:18:20] that stood in the garden of eden
[1:18:21] restored to life oh
[1:18:24] how happy god must be he's got his tree
[1:18:27] back amen he's back in the garden with
[1:18:29] his people he's got a bride on the face

[1:20:21] preacher he's given you a pastor amen an
[1:20:24] anointed man who can break forth the

[1:20:30] heart amen and just refresh you in that
[1:20:32] garden refresh you in the shade of that
[1:20:34] tree oh friends i know what i'm talking
[1:20:37] about this is not an imagination amen
[1:20:40] this is something real but it's
[1:20:42] something you will not find in this
[1:20:43] world you will not find these
[1:20:45] relationships you will not find such a
[1:20:46] brotherhood you'll not find such a
[1:20:48] fellowship in a communion anywhere else
[1:20:51] than in here be
[1:20:52] between the wings of the cherubim
[1:20:55] oh and god is calling to you saying get
[1:20:57] out of this lay outta sea and death get
[1:20:59] out of this wilderness

[1:21:05] cherubim
[1:21:07] i'll meet you in there
[1:21:10] i'll meet you in there
[1:21:12] it's what he wants eden is what he wants
[1:21:14] a man will be like a tree planted by
[1:21:16] rivers of water
[1:21:18] brings forth his fruit in his season his
[1:21:19] leaf won't wither whatever he does will
[1:21:22] prosper
[1:21:23] a a christian will find satisfaction
[1:21:26] they'll find happiness
[1:21:28] and it'll drive it'll drive everyone
[1:21:30] crazy around them
[1:21:32] because a christian looks like such an
[1:21:33] oddball in satan's eden it's such a
[1:21:35] contrast it doesn't match it doesn't
[1:21:37] make sense
[1:21:38] how you could even be happy living a
[1:21:40] christian life and what looks like all
[1:21:42] these rules and regulations that you're
[1:21:43] subject to but a christian knows
[1:21:45] a christian knows that it's more than
[1:21:47] that
[1:21:48] because a christian's in there with god
[1:21:51] hid away from the world it's a mystery
[1:21:53] to them but they want it
[1:21:55] they're desiring it
[1:21:57] brother braham said the world is dying
[1:21:59] for love
[1:22:00] and that's why we ought to have love for
[1:22:02] one for the other
[1:22:03] because well because we're right here
[1:22:04] under this bride tree why wouldn't we
[1:22:06] love why wouldn't we be
[1:22:08] have peace why wouldn't be oh my why
[1:22:10] wouldn't we be happy
[1:22:12] god's bride tree's been restored the
[1:22:14] tree of life is back friends and the
[1:22:16] holy ghost can take a son or daughter of
[1:22:18] god back to an eden
[1:22:20] condition
[1:22:23] my my my
[1:22:24] see ever since adam left eden
[1:22:28] god's every action and desire has been
[1:22:32] working to bring him back
[1:22:34] it's what he wants
[1:22:36] it's what he wants can't stress that
[1:22:37] enough
[1:22:38] every prophet every messenger the manna
[1:22:41] the miracles everything that god has
[1:22:43] wrought
[1:22:44] amen has been to bring you
[1:22:47] back to eden with him
[1:22:50] sin couldn't stop him amen your fallen
[1:22:53] condition couldn't stop him the
[1:22:54] conditions of the world couldn't stop
[1:22:55] him satan might be on the throne of this
[1:22:57] world but god is still sovereign
[1:23:00] not one of us will be plucked from his
[1:23:02] hand he'll get everyone that he lost
[1:23:05] and he'll bring us back to the garden
[1:23:07] and even in satan's eden you can live in
[1:23:09] such a condition to where the effects of
[1:23:11] the environment are not they're not

[1:24:59] that's what it means to be shut in there
[1:25:01] you know that uh it's such a sacred
[1:25:03] place such a guarded place when god
[1:25:05] chased him out of the garden the bible
[1:25:07] says that he put cherubims around it he
[1:25:10] put those cherubims around that garden
[1:25:12] amen to guard that place to keep it safe
[1:25:14] to keep it sacred but i want you to know
[1:25:17] something brother sister those cherubims
[1:25:19] were not placed there
[1:25:20] by an angry god to keep you out but
[1:25:23] those cherubims are standing by eden to
[1:25:26] keep it safe and sanctified and maintain
[1:25:29] that paradise until you come home
[1:25:32] they're only keeping it safe for you
[1:25:34] hallelujah those cherubims that were on
[1:25:36] the ark there was a there was a pillar
[1:25:39] of fire that whirled between the wings
[1:25:41] of the cherubim in that temple in that
[1:25:43] holy of holies and there was only one
[1:25:46] man that had the privilege to enter in
[1:25:47] there
[1:25:48] but that presence that shekinah that ark
[1:25:52] amen that was not for aaron but aaron
[1:25:55] was keeping it for you
[1:25:56] and now by a new and living way the veil
[1:25:59] has been torn so that every believer can
[1:26:01] leave this world willingly and boldly
[1:26:04] enter in past the triple veil to get in
[1:26:07] there where the world doesn't exist
[1:26:09] anymore
[1:26:10] it's just you
[1:26:11] and the shekinah
[1:26:14] that's what it means doesn't it now
[1:26:17] anything can go on out here
[1:26:18] anything could be going on in the world
[1:26:20] but you're in there with him
[1:26:24] you're in goshen friends
[1:26:26] plagues are a fallen
[1:26:28] miseries are being poured out in this
[1:26:30] world but it can't touch you
[1:26:32] because you're in a secret place you've
[1:26:33] been gathered in
[1:26:35] under a token under a blood
[1:26:37] glory be to god
[1:26:39] oh
[1:26:40] are you alive in there
[1:26:43] [Music]
[1:26:45] that's the kind of presence between the
[1:26:47] wings of the cherubim that wasn't for
[1:26:48] the high priest priest was keeping it
[1:26:50] for you
[1:26:52] it was a type of christ
[1:26:54] the only one who had the right to enter
[1:26:56] that veil but when he entered it he tore
[1:26:58] it
[1:26:59] so that any christian
[1:27:00] could boldly get into there into a
[1:27:03] hidden life in jesus christ it's such a
[1:27:05] wonderful thing to people
[1:27:06] that are living in a sanctified living
[1:27:08] in a religious misery
[1:27:11] it's such a marvelous thing i remember
[1:27:12] the first time i studied a hidden life
[1:27:14] in christ it's a wonderful sermon you
[1:27:15] should listen to it wonderful message
[1:27:16] but brother brown's bringing it out and
[1:27:18] i'm not sure if it was that one or it
[1:27:20] might have been one of the similar ones
[1:27:22] like why are people so tossed about but
[1:27:24] he's just preaching about this this life
[1:27:25] in christ
[1:27:27] where the manna stays fresh in other
[1:27:29] words he said it's victory all the time
[1:27:31] it's joy all the time it's peace all the
[1:27:33] time and it's not subject he said now
[1:27:35] let the waves it doesn't mean you don't
[1:27:37] have ups and downs in your life but he
[1:27:38] said let those waves toss any way they
[1:27:40] want to there's an anchor that's holding
[1:27:42] you
[1:27:43] and it's such a wonderful thing to uh to
[1:27:45] a to a to a young christian who's in
[1:27:47] that religious misery and is it even
[1:27:50] possible
[1:27:51] is it really real a life in christ
[1:27:55] where it doesn't matter what's happening
[1:27:58] in the environment right
[1:28:00] a real hidden life in christ brother
[1:28:02] brown said oh he he he's closing there
[1:28:04] in the service oh brother branham can a
[1:28:06] man live that way
[1:28:08] absolutely
[1:28:11] that's what jesus died for
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:16] amen
[1:28:17] it's not who you are it wasn't even
[1:28:19] being an israelite that saved him
[1:28:21] it was the token it was the blood
[1:28:24] wasn't the people that they belong to
[1:28:26] the church that they joined the message
[1:28:27] that they believed the prophet that they
[1:28:29] had
[1:28:30] but it was the token
[1:28:32] and that's where you are
[1:28:34] you're under that token you're
[1:28:36] you're in goshen you're aaron
[1:28:39] you're you're not like the rest of the
[1:28:41] world you're set apart you're a holy
[1:28:43] priesthood
[1:28:44] you don't dress like them
[1:28:46] you don't act like them you don't eat
[1:28:48] like them you don't you don't feed on
[1:28:49] the same things you don't talk like them
[1:28:51] you make a different noise
[1:28:52] you got a bell in a pomegranate plain
[1:28:54] holy holy holy unto the lord
[1:28:56] they call you a holy roller but you know
[1:28:58] that's just your song that's just the
[1:29:00] noise that's your noise that's your
[1:29:02] worship amen you're not like the rest of
[1:29:04] the world you're aaron you've got the
[1:29:06] privilege you've got the right
[1:29:08] when you want to you can go in there
[1:29:12] and you can get access to the presence
[1:29:14] of god like no other people on the face
[1:29:16] of the earth
[1:29:18] think of it to walk past the outer court
[1:29:20] and all the people are there even
[1:29:21] gentiles and things visiting the temple
[1:29:24] and tourists and people they're just
[1:29:26] kind of observing you know and then you
[1:29:27] you go past that and you go into the
[1:29:29] inner court and there's where the
[1:29:30] religious ones are there's other
[1:29:31] priesthood there everybody dressed in
[1:29:33] there people dress like you and they're
[1:29:35] making worship and they're sacrificing
[1:29:37] they're going through the rituals of
[1:29:38] religion
[1:29:39] but
[1:29:41] past that
[1:29:42] there's a veil
[1:29:45] and you're the only one
[1:29:47] who can go in there and when you go in
[1:29:48] there no one goes in with you
[1:29:52] in fact brother brown said the only way
[1:29:54] that they can even tell that you're
[1:29:55] alive in there is because you make a
[1:29:57] noise
[1:29:59] but you know you go in there
[1:30:02] and that triple veil
[1:30:04] falls behind you that's not there to
[1:30:06] keep you out that's there to keep the
[1:30:08] world out
[1:30:10] but you go in there
[1:30:12] and there's that ark
[1:30:14] covered in gold
[1:30:15] the wings of the cherubim lifted
[1:30:18] and in the middle of there there's a
[1:30:19] light
[1:30:20] now brother bram said out there in that
[1:30:22] sanctu sanctification court he said they
[1:30:24] got light out there they actually got a
[1:30:26] seven golden candle sticks
[1:30:28] that they got a flame there but he said
[1:30:30] it was artificial
[1:30:31] isn't that the problem we got around the
[1:30:33] message we got a lot of people they can
[1:30:35] quote the church ages they got their
[1:30:36] candlesticks just right all the diagrams
[1:30:38] are drawn they understand all the
[1:30:39] mysteries but it's all intellectual it's
[1:30:41] all head knowledge and they've never
[1:30:42] been in there
[1:30:45] that's why i say to someone you know
[1:30:47] you might not understand why i make the
[1:30:48] noise that i make or you might not it
[1:30:50] may be a mystery to people but friends
[1:30:52] you know uh it's be it's something real
[1:30:56] it's more than emotion in there
[1:30:58] it's more than religion in there it's
[1:31:00] more than fanaticism it's more than any
[1:31:02] of those things
[1:31:04] it's it's real in there
[1:31:06] so you know you might you might say well
[1:31:08] brother nathan you know you got to
[1:31:09] understand this mystery and all that
[1:31:10] look you might you might have all your
[1:31:12] candlesticks right
[1:31:13] you might be smarter than me but you're
[1:31:15] not deeper
[1:31:17] because i'm in there
[1:31:19] i'm in there brother bram said the
[1:31:21] problem with those candlesticks he said
[1:31:22] they'd get smoked up they'd burn out
[1:31:24] they'd have to be relit that's why we
[1:31:26] got a lot of people around the message
[1:31:28] they understand the doctrines they
[1:31:29] understand the teachings they belong to
[1:31:31] the church they pay their tithes and all
[1:31:32] those things but they've never been
[1:31:34] in there
[1:31:36] when you walk in there and the curtain
[1:31:37] slaps behind you the world is shut out
[1:31:40] and it's you and the pillar of fire
[1:31:42] and there's a light in there that lights
[1:31:44] up the whole room but it'll never go out
[1:31:46] because it's not artificial
[1:31:48] it's not man-made you don't have to keep
[1:31:50] it lit
[1:31:51] it's eternal
[1:31:53] eternally burning
[1:31:56] you walk in there
[1:31:58] some of you know what i'm talking about
[1:32:00] you go in there in your prayer closet
[1:32:03] in your home
[1:32:05] and you're a
[1:32:06] at the altar whatever it is but nobody
[1:32:08] goes in there with you just you
[1:32:10] and the shekinah
[1:32:12] the zoe life of god
[1:32:14] and you
[1:32:15] and it begins to just whirl
[1:32:19] hey man
[1:32:20] it might touch you
[1:32:22] it might speak a word to you
[1:32:24] it might affect you you might feel the
[1:32:26] warmth of that flame it might burn a
[1:32:29] little dross off of you
[1:32:31] amen but it's just something that
[1:32:32] happens just between you and him that's
[1:32:35] that's where man meets god
[1:32:38] not in the religious court but in there
[1:32:42] as an individual that's where the deep
[1:32:44] emotions are felt the great profound
[1:32:47] things that you feel in the presence of
[1:32:49] god that you can never describe
[1:32:51] that's where poetry rolls off your
[1:32:54] tongue
[1:32:55] that's where inspiration strikes
[1:32:57] that's where comfort is
[1:32:59] that's where your peace is that's where
[1:33:01] your joy is that's where real life is
[1:33:05] is in there with him
[1:33:07] oh god
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:10] in there
[1:33:11] back to eden
[1:33:14] that's where god has fellowship with his
[1:33:16] children
[1:33:19] hallelujah
[1:33:21] i was going to go another direction i
[1:33:22] want to close on this
[1:33:24] [Music]
[1:33:28] my message to the church today is this
[1:33:32] walk with god
[1:33:34] walk with god what i am describing
[1:33:35] that's that's what adam had in the
[1:33:37] garden
[1:33:38] that's what an eating condition is
[1:33:40] where it's you and god in the garden
[1:33:44] the world shut out the cherubims keep it
[1:33:46] out
[1:33:47] and you're there with him and you're
[1:33:49] walking with him a man or woman who's in
[1:33:51] an even condition
[1:33:52] should walk like god
[1:33:55] walk with god
[1:33:57] that's what adam seed does you know how
[1:33:59] how enoch
[1:34:01] enoch showed the seed that was in him
[1:34:03] he showed he wasn't cane seed because he
[1:34:04] wasn't out building kingdoms
[1:34:07] he wasn't out doing great works and
[1:34:08] warring and conquering he wasn't doing
[1:34:10] all the things that cain did he was
[1:34:12] walking with god
[1:34:14] he took the back seat
[1:34:16] he stayed in the wilderness with the
[1:34:17] sheep he he stayed up he walked with god
[1:34:20] and he pleased god that's what all of
[1:34:21] adam seed do
[1:34:23] they're not trying to carve out a a
[1:34:26] great life down here they're not kingdom
[1:34:27] builders
[1:34:28] they're not ambitious people after the
[1:34:31] after the successes of the world which
[1:34:33] don't bring satisfaction anyway
[1:34:35] brother sister walk with god
[1:34:37] you know we we so often we walk with the
[1:34:39] church
[1:34:41] we walk we rub shoulder we walk the walk
[1:34:43] so to speak
[1:34:45] and you know i love my church but i want
[1:34:47] to walk with god
[1:34:49] i love my family
[1:34:51] but i want to walk with god
[1:34:53] that's see in the beginning that's how
[1:34:55] it was
[1:34:56] it was a man and god that's what it has
[1:34:58] to be in your life you'll never get
[1:35:00] anywhere till you start at the beginning
[1:35:03] you know that god didn't have in his
[1:35:04] mind for adam and eve to be alone
[1:35:06] forever
[1:35:07] you know there was going to be spoken
[1:35:08] word there were going to be children
[1:35:10] come forth there were going to be new
[1:35:11] generations just like in your life young
[1:35:12] man young woman god's got a spouse for
[1:35:15] you he's got children for you he's got a
[1:35:16] career for you he's got all these things
[1:35:18] for you all this will come but it starts
[1:35:21] in the garden
[1:35:23] alone
[1:35:23] [Music]
[1:35:26] alone in the garden
[1:35:29] adam
[1:35:30] where art thou
[1:35:32] i was stricken by this
[1:35:34] the other day adam
[1:35:36] where art thou you can you imagine
[1:35:38] brother brown would describe it how the
[1:35:39] god would come down that garden that
[1:35:41] pillar of fire would just
[1:35:43] step into a body
[1:35:44] start walking down the path
[1:35:47] in eden
[1:35:50] and call out adam
[1:35:52] where are you
[1:35:54] he knew where adam was
[1:35:57] creator of heavens and earth the
[1:35:58] omniscient god but there's something in
[1:36:00] the heart of god he loves to call and
[1:36:02] hear his child answer
[1:36:04] that's something the angels can't give
[1:36:05] him
[1:36:06] that's something
[1:36:07] satan couldn't give him as the song
[1:36:09] leader of heaven he couldn't he it's
[1:36:11] something something that satisfies god
[1:36:13] in a way that nothing else can the call
[1:36:15] of his children back to him but i
[1:36:17] thought how that god would come
[1:36:19] one last time as he came every evening
[1:36:21] in the cold evening a walk with his
[1:36:22] children come and call out adam
[1:36:26] where are you
[1:36:28] hear adam respond
[1:36:31] say adam
[1:36:33] i'm sorry my son
[1:36:38] i'm sorry i had to be this way
[1:36:41] this final meeting this final fellowship
[1:36:44] in the garden
[1:36:45] before you leave it must have felt so
[1:36:48] final
[1:36:49] so terrible to adam
[1:36:52] but i just could imagine god would
[1:36:53] comfort him say you know

[1:37:07] i'm wanting to express and the only way
