help us together as a people speaker in here help us to get out of the way Lord that you could just speak to us and and move in our hearts and our lives and right here in a very special way Lord father we just give ourselves to you today and this evening Lord and ask God for your divine will that it would be done father Lord God may you reach each and every one of our hearts and our lives Lord and may the word find its mark within us Lord we pray we love you and thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you would turn with me to Matthew chapter five verse 14 give me VGA one brother I want to continue on here with the thought on letting our light so shine I've been looking at this for number of weeks and in verse 14 we just want to read a few verses and we'll let you have your seats in verse 14 it says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen may God bless you and bless the reading of the words your being seated tonight I want you just to think of each part of this of the scripture here everything is we know that this scripture is is made mention in two of the other Gospels and we see how that the very purpose of the light itself even where the Lord Jesus would would speak to us and admonish us I what a responsibility anything the word would speak to us it there's a responsibility that comes with it and when saying you are the light of the world we know that there must be if there is a candle to be lit then it shows that not only is there a source to light it present but there must be something that is able to be lit and when you look at this of how that in all of this that is placed here there's a placement also that is that is set forth and we get to looking at it it's dealing with our life that our life would be a display for others and we know that when we look at this in thinking of in terms of the word that eternal life itself is living for others and the light itself when the Lord Jesus would would speak this year that no man lights a candle and puts it under a bushel but he's rather it's put on a candlestick this is a divine placement and we know that candlestick is Christ himself it's to be placed within the body of the word bad baptized into one into that one body by one spirit so it's an illumination it's a light it's God's light himself that is shining through and is illuminated our hearts and our lives and to think that the purpose remember the purpose is that our lives itself is to point people to the source to Christ himself that's their various gods God is declaring within this hour it's just like a messenger when God sends that messenger the messenger points you he will declare that reality and point you to that reality that lays there behind that veil and that's the same thing that we're when we look at the display with that that is to be displayed through our lives as we were looking at that last week that it's to point people to a living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ and I look at this and I think of how the scripture says a city that is set on a hill you know when you look at a city a city as a place that's inhabited you you you'll never you can never drive by a city and not know that you've been by a city as a matter of fact the city itself is a place that you can actually begin to see from a distance there is light and light that shines within it it isn't just something a city is not something that when you just come upon it you say oh well we're in a city but there it actually has an illumination that that is lit up and to think of how that the Lord Jesus would even describe this that it's a city not set in a valley but a city that is set on a hill once again it speaks of positioning the word itself when the word itself it not only positions us in Christ but God knows exactly what he has for each of our lives and where we are to be positioned in this life and to think of it the whole positioning is so that our lives the light itself would shine through and I think about this of the city and and that that is set on a hill it's a place that's inhabited it's a place that has light within it if I can say like this it's a metropolis that is feel old with light if there's no question about it when you look at this city is it a city that is inhabited because if it's not inhabited there won't be any lights there and you know sometimes you think about places where it used to be places that was inhabited no longer everything has grown up they don't still have lights on in those areas but it shows that light itself has to come in to that life and it's lit that life and there's a positioning in there now look at that you know many times when I I look at it and I think about even when I I look at how that you know it's placed where when we look at the the the part of I think of the Underground Railroad you know and I like to I like doing I've done a lot of reading on that over the years and in just spare time and I look at how that there was there's many places all along this area here with in Ohio places Sandusky Oberlin and all the way through and one of the ways there was not only points that would be within the wilderness and that they would find on trees but it was they would know that a house was a safe house because there would be a light source in the window and that light source they would know there would be messages that was given by lightning we even see that even how God would it would it would have it laid out there an example there is a message of life that is to shine forth through our life that there is a true Liberty now I want to just kind of take this direction here tonight when we're looking at our our lives being being lit up that it points to a place of of true Liberty believe I'm said I like this he says what we need is candles lit what we need is lives lit a flame with the power and the resurrection of Christ shining forth the same kind of a light that he gave you believe that he said well you can say I'm crazy if you want to you can say I'm out of the will of the Lord if you want to but just one thing where I once was a sinner I've been saved where I was once gloomy and glum I'm happy in the Lord Jesus I know there's something half to me you think about that that that young man remember that here he was he was born blind and the disciples were asking about him and the Lord Jesus let it be known the condition that he was in was that the very glory of God might be made known and remember after the Lord Jesus had and moved and brought healing to his eyes remember his parents would not even stand there but his parents said he is of age ask him you see he they couldn't testify of what happened to him but only he could testify of what happened to him you see he was the one that had happened to and because there was something that happened to him where at one time he was blind he didn't matter he was standing in front of all the Pharisees in that day these were people who could quote go through scriptures and everything else he was standing right there in front of him but they could not figure out what is going on but he let him know he said this is strange you don't know where this man came from but I'm gonna tell you I once was blind but I now can see it was a witness and a testament tell you something friends the world is not longing for doctrine the world is longing for reality amen we're not we're not sit and called by God the Bible didn't say let your word so be authenticated it said let your light so shine it's a discipline it's a life that it's live for others to behold because once the life is lived then they can begin to ask questions it's like as we looked at it last week on a billboard don't ever try to put up a paragraph on the billboard who's going to read it I mean unless the guys that end up in a ditch but the only thing they do on a billboard is display a sign and they'll put up exit 140 to be that's it if you're hungry and that sign is something that's appealing to you has something on it you know interests in a lot of words the picture says it all and that's the same way with the display of the light of God when that light is displayed through our lives it says it all we don't have to try to talk to somebody to try to prove to them anything its Christ himself proving it through our lives I believe that with all my heart notice this it's a it's a time brother Babbitt said it like this he goes on in this quote he says it's like a colored sister said one time in a meeting she said I want you all to know one thing she said I'm not what I want to be and I'm not what I ought to be but there's one thing sure I'm not what I used to be hallelujah I tell you that's a good thing you know when you've passed from death unto life when God takes a hold of you and shakes you till your life changes and changes everything there is in you and makes you a new creature that's what we need some lighted candles bill them goes on to say it over here again he says tell them how the candle got lit that's all they have to know tell them what lit the candle tell them what is burning in there just tell them how it got lit let them get lit that'll take care of the rest of it look how he says you don't have to tell go through all kinds of great words that you know not to begin with and they don't mean nothing after you know it just tell them glory to God the Holy Spirit struck me and I'm a different man tell them how the candle got licked all the doctrine he'll take care of it once the candle gets lit we're not winning people by doctrine but let them know how the candle got live yeah you understand friends there's been a lot of things that's been a lot of the problem people have come to know doctrine but they've never met Jesus Christ and that's why when things come up and what they are looking at discrepancies and misses said here and this is said here what it is they're looking at things and they're looking at it because just to know the doctrines is to knowing in the flesh you know exactly what I'm talking about is to know him in the flesh brother mom said a good Baptists can take this Bible and tie your hands he said because he has note him in the flesh but it's not you're not saved to know him in the flesh it's to know him in the power of his resurrection I mean people can see look all around your jobs and everywhere you go you can see people when they're on the up-and-up let him get a pay raise I mean then the boss that they've been running down is the best guy in the world the world sees all of this the world sees all of the the Sunday School teachers I worked with them and you know they would want when they had a special need they would want to comment and they would you know at times want to ask questions and talk about things and yet it was known that they were sunday school teachers but yet they were the ones that would get on the PA system and announced happy hour starts at four o'clock you don't want to miss it huh I remember you know a sweet little old lady came by the one time and she came by my room and she said Sam why aren't you gonna go I said no I don't go then places Betty Christians don't go there she said well I'm a Christian I said well Betty there must be something different between me and you I said because the Lord Jesus completely changed my life I have no desire to even go to them places I didn't try one putting her down I just let her know what happened to me changed me it's not that I could go there and drink a coke I don't want to even go to them kind of places I believe that with all my heart you know there's a lot of things that when we look at it and I think brother brand will continue to move through this whole fault line and he he'll remind us of a man by the name of Hudson Taylor you know who was who was that who was a a man of God and brother Graham will remind us of this and and brother brand will talk about it of how that there were people who would ask this and you know I've been feeling what the holy ghost should I go ahead and go to to seminary and brother Brown would always refer this phrase even when he wasn't directly calling out Hudson Taylor's name but he would refer to it and say why do would you wait to your candles halfway burnt down go and it's just been lit and I believe that's what God desires in our heart it isn't that we need to set and but we've got to have everything put together you don't need to have everything put together go out there and tell them how we got lit and let me tell you something even when God divinely places things in our lives we realize friends that it is God who did that but many people still need to know how the candle got lit and that's what they need this world is craving for reality it'll need no more knowledge the Bible said knowledge increases and you risk me you don't need any more knowledge I agree that when we look at the doctrine of the word remember it was not intended just to be head knowledge but it was intended that it would bring forth and be divine revelation working in our life but let us make sure that we don't put the feast of unleavened bread out of order you with me let's make sure we keep all those things in the right order they meet the lamb they've had their pinnacles let's make sure of those things so when you look at this of how that the candle it got lit look at this example here in the scripture here's a man that we know by the name of Legion I don't know what his name is but we know him and the Legion wasn't even his name that was just amount of devils that was in him that's all it was we don't know his name but this is what I want you to look at that after the Lord Jesus had visited this area there was a need within his life back drew the Lord Jesus there you believe that Jesus wasn't just happenstance going around to different places but he realized that these appointments were he would even say I must need Joe by Samaria he was being directed and led by the Holy Ghost I believe that not only as the groom has led that way but I believe that's his bride that we are led the same way if he's a serpent bruzer were ordained to be serpent bruisers as well if he was led as the groom that same Holy Ghost is in right form and it's to lead us I believe that don't you now notice this this man the Bible this is one of the accounts here it was after he himself has been set free remember even many of the people came out of the city to see it there they came out the witness this man man he's been set free they heard telling the tales but I often wonder is it that they came to see him or they come to count how many hogs I don't know because after a while remember they prayed the Lord Jesus please get out of here you with me they came to see him and they came to see about the Hogs the swine but you see after everything had taken place then here the man the Bible says when he was coming to the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him howbeit Jesus suffered him not but said unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the Lord hath done for thee and have had compassion on thee and he departed and began to publish in Decapolis how great things Jesus had done for him and all the men did marvel how would you think of this wouldn't it have been a wonderful thing for him to be able to get in the ship with the Lord Jesus wouldn't it have been a wonderful thing for here in the midst of a campaign the Lord Jesus could call and say I'd like to ask brother I don't know what his name is but I'd like to ask him who was once an only jet I'd like him to stand up here tonight and give a testimony there is no doubt about it his testimony would have a resounding effect but his testimony would not have the same magnitude and impact as it would when he went back to those who knew him they knew how this guy was they knew the situation about his life in the Lord Jesus here he is this candle has been lit what's happened he's placed on a candlestick and he's sent right back in did the capitalist this is a a city or what is known as ten cities and this man goes in there and begins to publish which begins to preach he begins to Herald it begins to tell and you look at it in our lives you might not be a preacher but your life is a preacher it meant sometimes you use words other times you don't use words there's times you want our life itself it's the life that's preaching it's the life that's telling forth it's the life and here this man is declaring the compassion of God he's telling how his candle got lit how great things the Lord had done for thee you almost wonder when he came into the place you wonder people didn't say hey hey hey hey where's the kids at get him get him no doubt he probably went to his home first you with me it probably went back to his home first and when he got back to his home first maybe his his wife his children or whatever more maybe you know they had been witnesses of these things but now they're witnessing of a life and I wonder what he said to him but he no doubt he said I met Jesus let me tell you something he didn't have to hold seminars to prove to him he met Jesus there was a personal presence of the Living God that vindicated the words in his life there was a light that was shining there his life was a city that was set on a hill it was a candle that had been lit and placed on a candlestick no doubt about it when it came among his friends people he's annoying but here this life is showing now and they're able to say what happened to him he said all God had compassion on me you see what real godly compassion how opposite it is from the way that compassion many times is taught we understand if it was not for the compassion of God you and I would be soon but remember God's compassion does not just cover his eyes and pretend like nothing's wrong but his compassion brought him down to become one of us and do something about the problem and the issues of our life this man was a trophy of God's grace he was a trophy of the mercy of Almighty God if it had not been for the mercy of God where would his life have been he's telling how his candle got lit is why brother Ram will say and I read this to you last week as soon as God lights the candle take off if you don't know no more just tell them how they got lit let them get lit and they'll tell somebody else and we'll have a candle lighting time that's what we need anyhow instead of so much theology candle lighting that's all you have to don't try to preach just say how you got lit I got filled with something that's burning me up and that's all just tell them about the lighting time how it got lit and it'll give the light as it burns down and let that one light lights another one remember how they relate to lit the candle sticks as we've been talking about they did not they lit that from the fire that came out from before the presence of God and it lit that altar and consumed the sacrifice and then they took that fire and they lit that candlestick and then from that candlestick they lit from that flame lit the next lamp and from that lamp lit the next land it's the same original outpouring of the Holy Ghost it's the same original one it'll produce the same results glory to God hallelujah and that wonderful they men are your witness tonight that it produces the same results hey man it does the same thing it ain't got weaker it ain't got weaker as a matter of fact it's in such a strength and such a power it's got stronger in this hour hey God has raised up a standard where the enemy wanted to tear it down and and substitute it but God has raised the standard and he's made it real so that you and I can walk and have that same experience that they had that way you don't understand what that does that makes the Bible alive to you and I the Bible is no longer a book of stories this Bible then becomes prophecy for my life if there's something that's missing in my life like that hammer where they sought out Elijah and we can have faith to know that God is the same God that that same God that brought up that axe head is the same God that can bring it up in my life it puts us into contact with the Living God who expressed himself in a living supernatural way glory beaut of God if from one light to another light through her to be to God you love him look at this testimony of life it's a woman in an amazing there's many of these people right here that the Lord Jesus dealt was their life you don't know their names tell me what their name was that that really ain't important what's important is is that their life was changed that's what means more than anything not who they were if their life was changed now here here's the Lord Jesus he's speaking to this little woman and after he spoke to her here his disciples come in verse 20 and upon this they come became his disciples and marveled that he talked with the woman yet no man said what see cast out or why talkest thou with her the woman then left her waterpot and went her way into the city and said to the men come see a man which told me all things that ever I did is not this the Christ then they went out of the city and came unto Him I want you to watch this who it is and what he did became the center and focus of her life who he is and what he did became the focus of her life I guarantee when we stand there on that day and we event eventually if there's a name that's put with this and we meet her her focus is going to be the same if you would have met this woman ten years later fifty years later her focus would still be the same because she has been lit hallelujah think of this mouth there had to be in her life I look at this because of the circumstance that surrounded there had to be such an accompaniment of the presence of God around her life and with her words for even people to actually give what she was saying the time of day you with me you know I know you said well bless I'm you yeah but do you realize friends that that's exactly what it must be even when Paul talked on the preaching of the word he said it must come with power and demonstration not with enticing words of man's wisdom if it ain't to come with enticing words of man's wisdom when standing and ministering the word it ought to be by the usher by the issuance of the Holy Ghost I believe it's the same way that within our lives that when we would talk to someone we better make sure that we're being led and we're not trying to prove somebody wrong that's not your God ain't send his word for that he sent his word that that word might be expressed it might even be somebody that even that you know may be sitting right around you but God has not sent his word for us to try to prove one another wrong there might be things that you don't see you don't see I like eye to eye but within the midst of it let's walk on with the Lord don't occupy ourselves with things like that notice this this woman brother Bevin said like this he said she could not hold her peace she ran into the city and her testimony was so stirring until they could not ignore her so they went out look at that mercy they couldn't ignore her I don't believe she was a pest but I believe there was a presence they could not ignore OMA and the Bible said that the people of sakaar believed Jesus he never did that again to them because of the woman's testimony that told her what she had done well Ram said it like this in one place he said this little lady he said in her house a prostitution she had Scrolls that she had kept and she had been reading these Scrolls she had been reading the words of the prophets and she was looking and remember which she came to the Lord Jesus she wanted a blank slate you understand what I mean you know you and I both have met people that they may have had a little bit of church background but you know when you come to them they have nothing of the Bible but yet within it in our time in our day days I'll tell you in many cases that's a good thing that's her that's a real good thing because many times it's so entrenched within the traditions and the thinking and you know we could go on and on on that one bring it on down home but when we look at it here her testimony was so stirring but to think of how that she in her life of where she was that that God came by and so illuminated her heart that she went back into the city you know there's no way they would have gave her the time of day think about this think about it there were men that within it she wasn't allowed to go to the well even at any other time the rest of the women went there was a difference she went there at a time when she was allowed but to think of it for her to even begin to even project some sort of a religious idea that is not legal boy there's got to be an authority burning greater in her by what authority are you bringing this message by the authority of the Living God amen you said she was a living witness of the message she herself was a reflection of the message has come oh my notice this the testimony of life look at this here many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman which testified he told me all that ever I did they believed on him because of her testimony so her testimony was not about her her testimony was about what he did for her sir testimony was about him you see she was a lamp that had been lit and remember the Lance must give light over against the candlestick it must illuminate and highlight the Lord Jesus Christ no girl would be to God so when the Samaritans were come unto Him they besought him that he would tarry with them and he abode there two days and many more believed because of his own word and said unto the woman now we believe not because of thy saying for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ the Saviour of the world and once you think about this he did not reproduce that sign again with them of sakaar are you with me he only did at one time but what he did that sign is that sign coming forth and here she herself is a witness a living witness that my life everything all my troubles everything has been uncovered and I have finally brother brems said she finally felt found the man that she had been waiting on since she was a child she found the man she had been waiting home since she was a child I'm telling you there was a reality that was so burning in her heart that when they got there it that illumination it drew them to a place to where they came out of the city to hear him and the Bible said as we read more believed and is more believed on his work here is the work going forth he didn't have to reproduce the sign again her life in her testimony you say how could that be because there was an accompaniment of the positive presence of the Lord Jesus Christ that gave witness beyond even the words oh she said come see a man that's all she said come see a man she has a lot she's she's pointing to him she's showing them come see the Messiah come see this oh my milligram says she was full of eternal life they had to listen to her like a house on fire on a dry windy day you couldn't stop it away she went and not only that if she had not been filled up the men would have wouldn't have listened to her but she had something positive that she knew about it will see it that's why it was something different about her words it wasn't that a her voice had changed his something was different there was a light there was a life that was behind it I want you think of this she wasn't there for days or months at that well she got lit and as soon as she got lit she had found the love of her life she left her waterpot there she showed everything else became secondarily what was beating in her heart what she was longing for had become a reality everything else took a backseat right then it didn't matter if it was priority to get water that was second now Hill Christ was first he had stepped to the forefront of her life and here she went away and come see a man a testimony a life that had been lit by the power of Almighty God what's she drawn into to the Messiah you see this is where our lives our lives are not drawn people to the messenger our lives are drawn people to Jesus Christ if we truly are receiving what God has said sad and sin in this hour you see that's why I stand in contrary and in contrast when a person would say that the true ministry wants people to brother Adam that's a lie that's an error that is not the truth they point them to Jesus Christ even the Prophet said it over and over the Prophet never echoed those words but men have echoes those words without a revelation you understand little by little by little things can so easily be eroded away we plunked the people where the Prophet could say over and over again and it's the truth what he could see in that day he said we're not getting people to Christ I don't think there's any I don't think there's any of us that could argue against within those things that friends the reality is is that getting people to Christ that's the reality it's alive that's to be lived I'll tell you the I'll I'll be honest with you I don't care how deep you can talk I don't care if you and I can carry on the conversation and I can finish this quote and I can finish a lot of those and that that's not what it's about it's a life that's lived you don't matter how much it's where can your life be live well I love the message but I'm a question is do you love the Lord Jesus Christ if you love the Lord Jesus Christ then you love the message in the right way by being example of it not just going along with it because well I think everything that sounds real good no it's a life that's to be on display the commandment has come arise shine the light has come Lord would be the god think about this let me just kind of move here just a just a little bit here when we look at here here brother Graham said it like this in the message he says the only way we see Christ is when he reflects in each other I see Christ in you you see him and me and that's how we watch Christ the brother Brahma he goes on now you know with a billboard and a life it's got to create a hunger but yeah there has to be a hunger there something that can be I mean you could talk to somebody whatever as we kind of mentioned that last week about eating if friends money's not hungry don't try to force it on I mean it's like trying to tell somebody who's full hey come on man you you need a hamburger I'm full I don't want a hamburger for I'm full you see they can only be hungry but you see if they're hungry listen to me now if they're hungry as we said it last week nobody's going to probably go to McDonald's if what they displayed on the Billboard was the Big Mac that looked like an elephant stomped on it and where the patties are all off you know and really got the sauce that don't look like the orange sauce anymore and where the lettuce is all scraggly and nobody's gonna go for that say look that looks awful good they're hungry are you with me now they're hungry but that what's on the sign is not attracting them so there's got to be a hunger and there's got to be a right display that's why the world itself even the Prophet when he was hearing this time in the Spirit of the Lord was picking that up if people were not in a place they did not want social gospel there is a reality that there was a people that was longing for reality now think of it the Prophet addressing these things and many of you know what I'm talking about when you look back you look back at things that brother BAM says on tape and think about how that people look during that time they probably looked at him and saying what in the world are you talking about what are you talking about he's pointing out certain things look brother BAM is pointing out things about rock and roll's in alright but think about it what about now within these times that you know you can just look at certain things and you know it's just like how its advertised sometimes or how things will be put forth or you can see it on a video or one or more it looks like a club you with me it looks like a club they've got their lights in their discos and their everything else come on somebody it turned they turn to churches into theatres it turned it into shelves come on somebody kill the lights out here let's put all the lights on the state we're not here for a show we're here for the Mady gob to come down and move among us and save lives and change lives and heal the sick and bring deliverance we're not here for show we're here that God might move what a sad look these what we see now are not seeds this is a crop it's a crop so the in order for a billboard there's got to be it she calls a thirst to her eyes brother bream says it like this he says I can come to a meeting and I start preaching and I watch the people you can see whether they're interested or not in just a few minutes you look over your audience you can tell whether you're boring them or whether you're not that's the truth you can see it but what you look for is to see has the problem to go on tear is to see that Christ inside of you feeding on that word and he says I begin to see he said and that comes back to me and I'm being fed then it's reciprocating amen so now look at this here in this fault line we are not salesmen another ask him how to raise their hands if I say to him who likes salesmen I'm not gonna ask you raise your hands I like I like salesmen when I need to know certain things about something such as is this on sale no was the last time it was on sale all right when you think it's gonna be on sale because most the time on things now I know not everybody's like me in and thank God you know you're not and I understand that I it's because they can go in a real and we're going a real bad way but you know when you go into things I like I don't want them telling me everything I want to know so when I go I want to have my comparisons already I want to be able to ask them certain questions but you know sometimes the salesmen those you'll say I wanna buy this car right now I know I really don't need a car oh come on just take it for a test drive hell I'll be back in here I have some popcorn ready for you I'll have everything ready for it I'll take it for a test drive you know how they want to get you in that car because once they get you in your car and you start seeing yourself in that car they feel like they've got you well my point is that's a Salesman a Salesman tries to sell things whether they themselves even believe in it or know about it this is why we are not salesmen we're not trying to sell the gospel that's why I made the statement last week I'm not interested in trying to get everybody but I'm trying to get everybody but God desires to have because if you're trying to get everybody then there's all kinds of compromises that's me I look at it right now you know many of you have already received it you know you receive things in your and your mailbox sometimes postcards I'm gonna receive the postcard sometime I'm gonna tell me what a postcard from I were down in Florida I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a postcard and they'll be usually a pretty good-sized one come to such and such a worship here we have these in these activities and we do this for the youth and every Sunday we have a special Browns rally you know there's there's things that they put on there when look at look at the sad part of it sending it out in that manner in that way what are they trying to do draw upon people but it's not bringing people to the reality they're trying to sell them trying to sell them certain things we are not salesmen billboards if you're ever driving down the road and a billboard starts talking to you you need to get checked billboards don't talk billboards just display right Peter said to show forth his praises of him that called you out of darkness into this marvelous light notice brother BAM said we're not his salesmen we are his billboards don't think we're his salesmen he don't need any salesmanship just billboards salesmen try to persuade you right oh you need this sir you need that hey hey just you know just for a hundred more dollars you can hey that all adds up you know that a Salesman is they're just trying to sell and brother branham you know he keeps alluding to something when he's ministering and that message let your light so shine among men and and he says we're not ty said we don't want quick sales he said well you have people that say haha I'll tell you what for two weeks man I lasted real good for two weeks man I I'll tell you what I had Victor for two weeks but after two weeks brother Graham said that's a quick sale we don't want quick sales and any refers to something some of you I looked it up and I couldn't even understand what brother hand was saying so I had to pull it up on the screen I said what's he saying here brother brand was somebody said you know that had a call advertisement had a call H ad a CE o L so I looked it up and brother brands referring to that at that time he said you know that had a call thing that was going on what it was it was a little lik sir where a man himself had went into a doctor's office he had pain in his foot and he himself wanted to have you know be pain free so the doctor gave him this B vitamin lick sir so this guy I just took the formula changed it a little bit but this lick sir was a very powerful and and in very very something that was sought after because it had like 20% alcohol in it so even the dry counties it said pharmacies were serving it in shot glasses I'd say people felt good take it four times a day I'd say they felt really good but notice only was that's all he was it was a salesmanship it was that which was invented by senator and here he was selling this how this will help you this will make you feel better and we notice we understand that about the gospel we're not trying listen to me we're not trying to get people into the church we want to see people come into the Lord Jesus Christ if they come here they're go to brother Andy's there go to brother Paul's brother Jess I don't get we don't care where they go as long as you get in Christ and Christ once you get in Christ Christ will position you where you need to be are you with me that's the main thing is getting people to Christ we're not trying to get everyone hail I'll tell you what you are to come here and you ought to do this I'll tell you what man with this and we've got this and we got this program and we I think God we don't have none in program right I don't want stuff like that you know I might be simple I don't want more stuff to think about well the same you'll send out a newsletter about I don't want more stuff to think about you want a newsletter you might want to go somewhere where they do newsletters I'm not interested in all that other stuff I'm friends listen I don't say that there's things I understand it's important for us to know but sometimes it's things what are we really coming for are we coming for all these other things where people say well I really like the music it's gotta be deeper than that people say well I'll tell you what I really like to minister in the word it's gotta be deeper than that there's gotta be a rim there's got to be something that's real that you're hearing from the Lord Jesus Christ because everything else will get old it'll get old all this old convenor you with me things can become common but when it's something that's there you know your your ain't you're hearing from God it'll help you go beyond even in common times think of this brother BAM said it like this he said you may never see a vision you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of Almighty God make a skeleton of a of a man turned back to life again you may never see him standing yonder in three or four rainbows you may never see his image you may never hear his voice you may never he says within this oh boy here it is but you can still be a signboard that will reflect Jesus Christ look at this by a life that's been lived so pure and unadulterated from the world not cluttered up with dirty things around your life but a pure thing that will cause the hungry heart to hunger and thirst to be like you you may never do any of those things but what's important is is the life being reflected and the power and humility and purity keeping the life uncluttered keeping it uncluttered sometimes things can get mounted this can get coming in this can take it a little by little you talk to you talk to individuals I hope nobody here is a hoarder I don't want offend nobody's feelings but you take you people who are hoarders little by little ask them when you when you when you when you get a chance to talk with them the things that they'll say is I don't know how it got like this I don't have that like this I just started one garage sale and went to another garage sale and went through another grouts and it's truth friends they don't know how it happened and they've got a little path through the house and they don't know how it happened but see it started by little by little by little and things can clutter up quickly is that right many times the clutter clutter is not necessarily the things that you want out on display right clutter is things that you want move because you say maybe we don't need to have this out that we do this don't need to be here it's all clutter hey get a box and let's send it all out to Goodwill or Salvation Army let's get rid of the clutter around here and then we'll buy more stuff and I want to get to something here look at this part right here in axe I want you to watch watch this right here just my heart was just so pressed last week is after I was closing just to come in and look at this part here let me just try to wind this down here was a man by the name of Apollo the bible says born in alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures and he came to Ephesus this man was instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in the spirit he spake and talked diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of John now watch this and he began to speak boldly in the synagogue whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him in front of the Brethren they took him unto them and expounded unto Him the way of God more perfectly I want you to watch this they have understanding don't they but their understanding they brought him to the side they realized when he what he had spoken that he hasn't come all the way yet or seen everything he knew the way of the Lord but here's what they did they pulled him to the side and they talked to him privately you with me the Bible says whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard they took him unto them and expounded unto Him the way of God more perfectly the point is I'm looking I was just drawn to this here just standing down and just jotting a few things last week at the end of the service is that within this part here watch the approach Aquila and Priscilla have a great amount of understanding but watch how they handle it they don't demean him they don't tear him down they take him unto themselves and then more perfectly they explain or they go into him and then after that Hey the man is recommended he's commended to the rest and it goes on to say even that he was helped much in verse 27 which had believed through grace for he mightily convinced the Jews in that publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ I've just just drawn to some things you know sometimes things you come through over the years and I just put them to the side because they're just wonderful nuggets that you you come across and things that that brother Branham will mention here throughout the message and in witness in here brother BAM take takes an approach and he says he said and you think God I know where there's a fellow that I believe that I could lead to you and a way you'll go and talk to him in a nice way so how do you do John I want to talk to you tonight about going fishing now wait a minute wait wait wait we want to lead him to Christ but I'm gonna talk to him about fishing see what what what what the intent that the desire is is to lead him to Christ but evidently John likes fishing its own the only way that I'm gonna be able to gain favor with John is talk about fishing if you don't know about fishing then you might just want to be honest don't go try to talk about all the lures and stuff that you don't know just kind of talk about certain reports that you've read about how the walleye are biting this year and the different things like that but the whole part is to get it engaged this is not a Salesman this is a part of looking at the heart and the life of an individual remember what brother bream just said there's a man that I know I can lead to you Lord now go to talk to him and we'll talk about fishing he says all he says yes I love to fish pardon me this this wants to keep going he says yes I love to fish I'll just read it to you he said yes I love to fish he said talk to him for a while and talk about his chickens and or whatever farming he's going to do for a while until God opens up the way now see look look at the contrast here we've talked about Legion we talked about the woman of Samaria they're telling how their candle got lit that's the same thing that's going on here but he starts out talking about fishing now I wonder if you were sitting there and you and in like brother Joe and I were gonna go talk and all of a sudden here we are and I'm sitting there brother Joe and I'm thinking you always talked about perch he's talked about walleye he's talked about catfish he's talked about how many sheep head he's throw back he's talked when is he ever gonna talk about the Lord he's waiting for a door the fishing is only to make contact the talking about fishing is only to to try to talk with them a little bit opening up and it gives you a chance to send home the gospel then when you win that soul you present it before the father like I said I present the little present to my wife and I say here father was happiness you do it because you love it not a duty but a love amen now you might have to talk about fishing for a couple days you might have to talk about hunting or dogs or whatever more it might take a little bit right but what you're waiting on is the door to open oh my let me go - let me go - one more one one example here brother branham here let me I'm just going to close on this the bream says brother and he said I believe that we have the thing that the world must have we've got to approach it in a way he said what if you're a carpenter said I'll take the man on the India brother borders over here he's a carpenter I believe what if he was driving with a hammer like this and driving nails and I had an automatic hammer of some sort that I could pour a keg of nails into and hold it up like this and River River and drive them boards up like that a whole lot better than he could with his hammer now if I walked up to him and I said hi boy you're not even with it you know nothing about it while you're you're you're just mashing your fingers my you haven't got a product to begin with he said I'm offending him I'll never sell the hammer he said it's my approach with what I have my product I know it's better than what he's got but I've got to remember I've got to approach him in the right way so bill rehm says I walk up to him and says how do you do sir my name is Brennan - borders I see you're a carpenter yes sir I am I really believe you're a real carpenter - yes look out he's approaching I believe you're a real carpenter I was watching the way you was handling your hammer oh yes Old Betsy has been with me a long time I say yeah that's a good one sure good - and you could really handle it yeah go ahead talk to him in a while and I say did you ever hear of a new such-and-such a hammer I don't believe I ever did he said well here it is you put your nails in here and let's just tack those boards up the up and down here look at the time this doesn't and what a product I've got show it to him like that and say to him look over and says say to him take it try it for a few days and see what you think about it I'll be back if it's the right kind of a product it'll sell itself it's the approach with it if it's the right kind of a product it will sell itself and this is what brother brems Tolman he says I believe this holy ghost that we have is genuine he said but we've got to remember the approach that were taken with our brethren and he said I do believe they are our brethren it's the approach that we've got to take so to think of us that when we look at this tonight and look through this through the word that it's the approach that we would we would take and how then our lives are to be displayed and listen friends we're no different than any other age and any other time that's coming you and I are no different than any other person that's ever walked upon upon this earth we have to deal with pride and that comes even with truth that it doesn't it's not a part of the truth but it can come right around it because this first birth that we still walk here within this body remember it still is very susceptible to pride whether it's things that's spoken or the ways that it's things it's looked at Paul himself said I was given a messenger in the flesh from Satan to buff at me lest I should become exalted to recognize this grace that has come to us our light ah you know the main of the times that will sometimes get an even opportunity to be able to express something to someone else it comes by the life that's lived it's not about the thing everything that we can say it's by the life that's live God help us to live lives that are clutter-free if there's any clutter net clutter thought feeling attitude any clutter any unbelief god I want to remove the clutter I don't want there to be any any hindrance I don't want anything to block that light of the city on the hill if there's trimming that needs to be done let our laps be trimmed so that it's not all carbon up and smoked up and let it be trimmed so that the light itself is burning fervently because even when our lives all around we we just don't know from that of our neighbors to even the people in our job to maybe even somebody that's waited on you behind the meat counter for years you just don't know but this world is craving and longing for reality they're not wanting promises come on somebody they're not wanting promises they they want to see promises in a reality and I believe with all my heart the light of God shining through our lives it is a declaration to point people in this hour that the Living God is present and is on the scene that whatever that there is a need God Himself is sufficient to provide for that need it don't take a lot of words it don't take a lot of knowledge it just takes a lot of yielding it takes a lot of humility takes a lot and just let God direct it tell how you candle got lit hey man they want to talk about things within the scriptures let them talk about things in the scriptures see where they're gonna go from me personally when I sit down and I do Bible studies with different ones that don't even come here to this assembly I don't sit down with an agenda that's me let's take our Bibles and let's see where we go let's see where God will take us because there's God there's questions on their heart and I believe that God knows how to direct that there have been times where I've taken things on Bible studies where people have asked the question we want to know this and we'll sit down right with it and go right through it but the point but the thing of it is is that there's questions that people have on their heart and just number this remember this that many times in lives and hearts we want to see lives that are lit desire to see people that have come to the Lord Jesus Christ and sometimes there's things that where there may not be necessarily where a person would come here don't look at it as a defeat that they don't come and darken these doors but has their life itself been taken from where they are you with me which I can always rejoice with those things right there if a person is taken they're taken from a bar room and they have met the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior I can rejoice in that sometimes our testimony listen to me sometimes your light in the testimony it isn't always just pointing to that of where of the opening and the light of what God is open in this hour remember what that light is showing it's showing the Lord Jesus Christ if it's showing anything other than the Lord Jesus Christ it's not the true light are you with me the true light will always point people to the Lord Jesus Christ and they if they don't have a hunger and a thirst for anything deeper that's between them and God but let our light so shine that they might see our good works your loving tonight Heavenly Father Lord very simple and what I pray that for each of our lives in our hearts Lord in our homes or everywhere that we go late may our desire is that I liked what so shine Lord Jesus help us Lord to walk in that humility like Aquila and Priscilla what I look at those those two how many times they were mentioned in letters of commendation in words that would refer to other Saints a comfort what a life what a testimony and Lord as Paul would mention of them and countless places in the scripture to salute the Saints to see Lord God as they took a paulus to see that humility in that understanding Lord we ask God that she would help us opportunities Lord we never know when that opportunity is going to present itself sometimes Lord opportunities present themselves to those people the Lord maybe have been the very ones that have been skeptics 5 the Lord God always in your hearts showing Lord that Lord God has helped us for we never know Lord in those opportunities we don't know Lord maybe the person that we're we've been talking to we've spoke to them Lord sit down with them in the scriptures maybe someone walking working right next to maybe a family member Lord Oh Lord Jesus may our lives be that or God truly a city that said only help us tonight Lord father my hand Lord hands are up Lord I don't want any clutter in my life Lord we don't want clutter Lord God we want it to shine in purity we wanted to shine in power not things that we have to say a life that is lived or Jesus that our lives Oh God a testimony a billboard a display help us tonight Lord father maybe for one that has an unbelieving spouse I pray that God may they be the best billboard Lloyd this Peter would speak about how the conversation the conduct in their life a testimony a billboard of the saving grace of Almighty God Brennan would give him strength Lloyd sometimes the winds and the trials sometimes smart things that said sometimes things look discouraging that I prayed tonight Lord God knowing and what has taken place in our lives it's real we're aware Lord God and what you've done in our lives you can take the hardest person and you could change him in a moment's time you could take a person Lord God to where that nobody would even want to mention their name but in your presence in a moment's time you can so touch that life like you did of that woman of Samaria that condition of her life she was hungry she was thirsty Lord and she found what she had been hungry for what she'd been thirsting for no doubt Lord throughout that city there were many others who were hungry who were thirsty or else they would have never responded to that billboard that went running down through that city with just a few words come see a man who told

you your face is all see [Music] [Applause] [Music] one time probably many of you can relate to this I had a had a gentleman on my coaching staff the first year I got hired and he and I would ride together he was he was a pastor he would ride together I didn't ride with my other two coaches because I just didn't really care for all the atmosphere some he and I would ride together we got up there and we were scouting a game we'd come out and got done scouting the game out of the out of Michigan that time and and we come out of that game and we've done scouting and on the way home you know I happen to have a tape in the car and I said hey I said Leonard I said I see wanting some good preaching Leonard said sure man put on the token priest in Dallas Texas then we had a time in the car how many we had a time I didn't say nothing to him I didn't let him know this who this I'm one I didn't need to do all that but I put it on we were just rejoicing I just felt to do that man he said I ain't never heard nothing like this he said I never heard another he said somebody took this out here in Exodus 12 and took that token he said and started working man he said I never know like that and he's identifying with it and and you know you you know when you listen to and Allison and and Leonard after that you know there were things that it began to be an open door where where Leonard said he said you know what man he said sometimes he said these times he said I want you to come preach he said from my church there right there but you know our paths and things just kind of it separated after a couple years and but what I come to the point is is that God knows how to lead you at that time I felt I felt to go ahead I could do that because I didn't have to explain to anything they didn't have to look at a book cover I could put that right on and then you begin to play there was something about it but then there's other times where it might be a testimony out of your life and now you're talking about is what God has done for you personally because let us remember that in all that we do if whatever we are given what we are giving to someone we are saying my life is identified with this it's identified with this to be the truth amen may God help us god bless you tonight you're dismissed in the name of the Lord we'll just sing that again Lord you're beautiful shake hands with one another you mean you are you today [Music] his own see [Music] your eyes [Music] is to take and shine [Applause] who's still me just [Music] ever see or my [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]
