Jesus thank you Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah glory be to God Hallelujah amen let's turn in our bibles if we could to Job chapter 22 and it's just so good to be in the house of the Lord tonight good to be gathered together and I'm just going to read a couple verse of scripture before we allow you to or ask you to be seated you want to just read just those first two verses where we've just been drawing from on the thought of a useful life and here as in verse 1 this is one of the one of job's friends and as he speaks and he says in verse 2 a question is presented can a man be profitable unto God as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we look at this thought of a of a useful life and taking into account when we're looking at job's life and as we've referred you to a quote that we've read from many times and I just just to refer to that of where much of the inspiration and where a lot of it come from is how that brother Branham words it in a manner that job's life he knew that his life had influenced people and he also was one that as brother Brandon would take in that quote and admonish us that he had been a useful life and I tell you when it all comes down to it there's a lot of things that we can do but if what it's all all that matters is what we've done for the Lord a person an individual we could have a lot of accolades a lot of things that we've accomplished but all of that is not going to matter in the end what's going to matter is what we've done for the Lord that's because we're here in this Earth for one purpose and that's to serve God we're here in this purpose Solomon would lay it out over and over that the beginning of wisdom is to fear the lord is to reverence him and to serve him and that's the whole purpose that our lives that as we come here that where lives would be dramatized by the spirit of God and that we would serve the purpose that God has called us to serve and everything and every time that what God calls you and I to do when God makes the call Upon Our Lives we certainly never feel like that we're capable of doing it and that's all part of the program of God because if we ever felt like that we could do anything then right away we know that we're not the instrument that God's chosen because every man who ever thought he could once he got in the prince of God then all of his weaknesses all of the inabilities everything begin to come out of him all of the reasons he could say Lord you just passed me on over go to this person brother Brown remember when the angel of the Lord spoke to him and told him this is what's going to be you were born for this purpose and on and on and went through all these things and brother Brown remember he told him he says I told him I will not be able to do this but notice what notice what the Lord did the Lord did not set there to confer or to reason or to debate with the prophet God just brings his word because it's his word that dismantles all fear and brings a trust and a confidence in him that's how God does it you know God doesn't you know as we would maybe try to you know say to one another oh yes this and yet but God has a way and I think that's such an example that we can always base because that's what faith is always based upon and should be what real true faith is based on the word of God and I just say it like this when you think of being an influence that's a that's a pretty big word in the hour we live in you know where people being influencers you know on uh in the internet and so forth and I realize for some of us that are older I the only reason I know that term is because I have had to study some of those things when I go to minister to young people and I begin to look at certain things that are out there in the present and and that's a that's a really high industry to be an influencer to try to influence people in a certain way but you know I think when it all comes down to it I wonder how many of them just like Elvis Presley will give an account of how they've influenced lives because remember we we're influencing lives whether we like it or not and I I tell you if there's one thing we want to be is we want to be an influence that influences people to Jesus Christ that's what we want to be that's the greatest thing that we can ever be in our life and that's what Joby was useful to the program of God and I say we think of this thought a useful life and as you look at where job is at In This Moment The Very things that job was experiencing in this trial that he was going through even where his friends and the accusation accusations are being made in all those things everything itself everything that God permits is with a purpose and God's purpose was in it is that job would become even more useful job had a testimony before this he had been a useful he had been a useful vessel unto God he had been useful to the rest to many others he had instructed others he had comforted others he had ministered to them who were weak in their life job was a useful vessel unto God in that hour to influence lives and hearts to God and you know when we see it in the scripture job was used in many in many different ways and I believe that speaks to how that the holy spirit will use and work through a many-membered body because it all comes down to it there's no big eyes or little use it's all Christ's ministering in his body so when it all when we look at it brother Brown will make certain statements throughout when he talks about job and he says job was not being chastened of God and what God God was not correcting job job had not done wrong but what God was doing and you hear the prophet bring this out time and time again he was purging job so that he might bring forth more fruit it's just like on a fruit tree an inspector goes out or who takes care of those trees they have to cut those trees in such a way you know it's just like maybe maybe you and your Landscaping at home you know maybe you've went out and you thought boy I'm really going to do a number and you did a number on those bushes you did a number on everything as a matter of fact you did a number where the only thing left to do is cut it all down you've butchered it up is that right we've been there in those times I remember one time you know I worked on the when we moved into the house we're in now and I seen that weeping cherry tree and my wife she keep pulled in the driveway and she looked at it and I had never cared for you know I just thought this thing is hanging down every which way and you know it looked like I gave it a it looked like I gave it a Beatles haircut when it was done and my wife she pulled up in the driveway I knew without her saying anything just by how she looked I had messed up would help to fight a rat about that weeping cherry tree before I did it so you know what I did for every year since I do the best thing I can do honey I'll hold it I'll put the oil on the trimmer and you can trim it the purging itself is to remove suckers it's to remove uh things that could be of a hindrance in order that life in order that more fruit would come forth purging is not a correction purging is not a disciplining purging is removing so that more of that life can be displayed and that's the same way Brother Brad will also make a statement regarding job I love this statement he said what God was doing in that time was he was actually going to bring out the qualities of a believer that was in job and God knows how to bring out the qualities that are in you and I sometimes we think the qualities would maybe come out when we're on a Mountaintop but yet in reality the real qualities are actually born and come forth in that of the valley so when we would think of it and we would say I want to be more useful I'm sure that we would never equate or think of a trial as that which would afford you and I to become more useful into the hands of God brother Brahm says this in the message of prisoners is one of the last before he prays and he says what God to my opinion will do and must do and will do in this last day is to find a tool for the Harvest he's got to find a tool tool to thrash the floor now remember what he's dealing with is what will separate seed from chaff so brother bams opened this service on a prisoner and he opens it and brother Bram will even give the example of how that our lives living in the world with the light of God shining forth is to be a witness is to be a display is to be a declaration that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that that's what this message came to do and produce is Christ in The Believer to open up that true that pathway that Clarity to where it's Christ dwelling within within the life Christ expressing himself through our lives and so to recognize of even when we see it that Jesus could say you know I I'm in the world but I'm not of the world and that's how when you think of it brother Bramble kind of used the example in the beginning of this message of how that you could put oil many of probably the sisters could think of this when you put oil in water oil does not mix with water it separates you can see it on the stove and brother Branham Likens that to the believer in the midst of this age it is to be that which dwells in the age yet it is separated from the world and so we look at our lives that oil amongst all of the water of the multitude and it's by Christ it's not our doings that we have separated ourselves we haven't made ourselves odd or different remember the warning of the Holy Spirit through the prophet when he preaches the seventh seal he says don't make yourself on we can preach on that a month or Sundays it just comes on it's not something that we have to make ourselves anything all we have to do is submit and surrender ourselves to God God makes out of us what he's ordained and predestinated so it's to be a tool to thrash the floor any farmer when he goes to his Harvest he has to have a tool to do it with certainly he's got to have a sharp sickle or something some instrument to thrash out the Grain and the Harvest is right I want you to catch that a tool or an instrument now notice God take us in your hand make us Bond Servants of Your Love use us for tool to bring the realization to this sinful cursed Earth that we're living in today that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now what shall he says this this is here an instrument a tool that's speaking for myself God let me be a prisoner yeah if all my brethren turned me down if all my friends turned me down I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ and his word that I might be harnessed to his word by the Holy Spirit to see the Holy Spirit make the word of God be confirmed by the same things he said would be done I want to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ now the prophet speaking this here in 63 he's already experienced a lot of misunderstanding concerning the gift in his life he's experienced that he's experienced criticism he's even already experienced when his Pastor Dr best of that told him Hey listen you need to forget all that stuff that's nothing but of the devil is that right and brother Brandon remember he himself prayed I don't want to see this no more I don't want the other one anymore of these whatever you call them these spells and things like that because it's what he thought he was but notice God had a purpose and God's purpose could not be defeated though he wasn't under a teaching at that time or Ministry that could open him to a place to have faith in the way God was wanting to deal with him yet God's purpose can't be defeated are you hearing me so notice here he has God meets with him in a personal way and notice what the Holy Spirit does it makes sense of what's taking place by the word and it tells him don't pay any attention to those ministers to those preachers now the Holy Spirit never tore them down but I want you to catch this here once God speaks and confirms his word to your life are you hearing me now that's where we stand in that place and renounce every other tongue that has spoke contrary to that when God's deal with your heart when God's calling your life when God's moving upon your heart it's God that's doing that what do I do renounce every other lying tongue that has said anything against the word of God concerning your life it's God that's bringing clarity we talk about worthiness certainly worthiness nobody would have chose based on worthiness brother Branham and the family he come out of nobody would have chose that but you see it just goes to show how we as people are you hearing me open the same I'm a Christian you still got your Humanity sometimes the things that sometimes the things that people can get to looking at and they and they think the token and oh and I believe the token produces right dressing I believe the token produces things of you know and and and different things oh they carry the Bible oh they they love the message but I believe it produces a life I'm not just looking at what's out here some friends I've been around the block too many times I've seen too many things I've been through too many prayer lines I've been through too many things that's why it's not just out here that I look at and say hey it's all right God knows what's there and it's God moving upon lives and hearts God never comes to shame anybody he comes to bring Deliverance Hallelujah so I say it like this notice this was a familiar scripture to us and where the disciples remember there had already been a question uh from the mother of the sons of Zebedee a good requests let one sit on the right let one stand on the left and Jesus goes through and he answers that his answer calls his indignation to rise among these who are with him and and you know then they begin to come under you know that that of a gentile spirit and well you know who's going to be the greatest and all this reasoning and and things like that and and you would think my goodness that couldn't be could that be among the revealed word could that be among where the son of man is at could that be among where that was working it was working right there sure yeah but notice whosoever verse 26 will be great among you let him be your minister that servant whosoever will be Chief among you let him be your servant even as he lays a pattern here as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many I want you to think of his testimony how God operated through the body of Jesus Christ he could say I can do nothing but what I see the father doing he can also say I've not come to do my own will but I've come to do the will of him that sent me is a declaration that that is being made so his coming in his life was not about himself didn't have a place to lay his head he had nothing he didn't come for himself everything he went through when he ministered to the needs of others brother Branham will pull out of that the prince of the House of David and he pulls out of that writing of how that when when the woman you remember she had her son who was in the beer which is you know that which they carry the body in for a funeral procession and remember when the Lord Jesus he was moved with compassion he spoke and that young man was raised to life and brother Brahm says it's recorded in the scriptures of then after that or he didn't say in the scripture he said it's just recorded he said maybe it's not exactly true or so forth but he said it's something to think about where he goes over and he would set on a rock and groan in himself with a headache and Brethren said why would he have to do that for you and I not for himself he did it for you and I think of the needs that he ministered to think of it the multitudes who were there that actually ate a miracle they ate it think of those when the baskets here as was coming around it goes from a little large lunch and we know it was spread out how far and you know how hard it is sometimes to see things in a distance but to think how they had to look at this and hear they know it's it just keeps on producing and let me just tell you something the last person didn't get a crumb each time this was done there was 12 baskets left over you know 12 years worship after what he has done it is a time of worship it's more than enough [Applause] he's more than enough when God does something it's more than enough it ain't just barely enough for the job God didn't sin barely enough in this hour East more than enough [Applause] many of them ate of those Miracles and walked away true they even followed a little bit they came around a little bit oh yeah they made a sacrifice to go to the other side of the sea for what purpose to eat Fish and Loaves what was that about them they weren't thinking about their soul that's what the son of man came to point them to is that to recognize there is a meat that you need to labor for and meat that will not perish but endureth but they went on about their lives but still it wouldn't have changed the course Jesus notice God already knew what choice they were going to make but he came to minister to their needs but there was a purpose and that purpose was greater than all the Miracles there were many miracles that were done the healing of the sick the death the blind all of that he was declaring God was declaring himself God was present in Christ [Applause] yeah are you hearing me he was declaring that that when itself was misunderstood he was called Beelzebub he was criticized he was ridiculed but what God was declaring that here God and man have been now reconciled God was declaring of what he was going to do when he would pour out of his own spirit it would be God living in the people once again to think about it he came for a purpose to pay a ransom for many is that what the scripture said give his life a ransom for many that means there were some being held and he came as the ransom glory be to God he didn't he didn't send a ransom he said I am the ransom I am your way out I am your Waymaker now getting along all the journey I want you to think of this now along the whole journey all the healing all the great Miracles all the deliverances that were done all the physical needs that were cared for yet the greatest of all was when the lamb surrendered his will to go to Calvary there have been many Hill many delivered but here at Calvary Satan's head would be bruised once and for all like Samson Samson he killed many Philistines but when he was there there in that Coliseum and he said lead me to what everything is resting upon supporting on and right there what the support of all of that was broken and more Philistines died in that moment when what Samson had surrendered all of his life [Music] it's the same thing in our lives it's a full surrender that's the greatest thing that that head was ever done he surrendered nevertheless not my will thine will be done that here the lamb wouldn't mean come and move into that of the high priest of faithful and merciful one one that had walked down here one that had experienced Temptation one who knew what it felt like under the pressure of obedience one who could understand you and I one who then could be the right kind of a mediator inside of you and me one that when we talked to him it does that he's able to say I understand and I'm here to move on your behalf there is one you can talk to he understands what you're going through [Applause] I say that was the greatest of all moments a prayer was offered up it was a prayer to be useful nevertheless not my will thine will be done in Hebrews 5 verse 7 who in the days of his flesh when he had offered a prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was hurt and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered don't get nervous he learned obedience you see obedience is is not something that is easy to the flesh but obedience itself to obey the word of God there's going to be pressures there's going to be suffering but obedience is greater than sacrifice [Applause] you can have all kinds of sacrifices but if there's not obedience obedience is the greatest thing you can do everything I'll do this I do this I do this I do this and it might be wonderful things that you could even do for the church I say thank God for that but remember God is not looking for that I believe in being helpful I believe in looking around here and saying what can I do what can I do for the church what can I do but to understand the greatest thing is obedience obedience is a cost it ain't cheap it costs something to obey the word of God it costs something what will it cost it'll cost my will it'll cost me but he learned obedience he he came to an understanding notice God who is the omniscient one the all-knowing God but he came down and he experienced what it is in humanity to obey he experienced that God so subjected himself to a place to experience obedience and this is where the scripture says being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him they say God grant us the grace that we can become more useful but the Brand's talking about in his own life the gift that's given to him preaching the gospel the Divine gift declaring how the desire is to use that just for God's glory and in the message faith in the Son of God he says it like this so each day I want to live not for myself if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that'll build the kingdom of God there's a lot there's a lot of density right here a lot to weigh with what's put on the scale what to benefit others what benefit to others well you know brother Samuel I want my boss to win the award this year I want him to win the award of the greatest slave driver so I I'm just signing up for I just sacrificed I sign up for all the overtime and this and that but listen to me now listen listen that might benefit your boss and it might benefit your pocket take some years off of your life but is it building the kingdom of God see everything that we look at there's got to be an evaluation I pray to God that there's sometimes that we start to look as we look at things and evaluate what's this going to do for the kingdom of God I mean this applies across our families it applies across children it applies across everything that we do what we're doing there should be an advanced vestment in our families in our homes but it should never be at the expense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ because God will not lead us that way that's why he said except the man is willing to forsake father and mother and all and follow me that doesn't mean that we leave our family hanging but it means that everything that we do it's prioritized in how does this benefit others and the kingdom of God looking at for your family how does this benefit your lives in the kingdom of God brother Samuel sometimes those can be some hard decisions somebody's got to be the adult in the room they preach I will for the benefit of the other nobody wants to be the adult in the room but the benefit of others think about it I'm not saying you but don't it's the benefit of others I don't want you to pound on me but for the benefit of others that you'll build the kingdom of God that's what we want to look at because notice what Paul said here I I love this I believe it's more than just words I believe this is a declaration from our life for the love of Christ constraineth us because we thus the judge that if one died for all then we're all dead and that he died for all that they which live should not live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again you just say it like this if we're going to sacrifice anything don't sacrifice the things of God and expect godliness [Applause] you can't can't cut Corners with God and then it turns down the road we know what happened with this I wonder what happened here wonder what happened you can't cut Corners why there's a pattern that God has given [Applause] Hallelujah God when God comes it's God vindicating his pattern true so what matters at the end of the day I know some of you you know at times I want you I want to make Clarity I thought I know sometimes we're living in a time where you know you're asked to do more where there's less I know many of you did I don't want that over timer I don't want this I don't want that I want you know you're looking at those things and you know you realize that within it sometimes those are things you have no control over you can pray about it we've got witnesses right through here but prayer has been offered up you know what there's things say Lord You're Still God to move on the schedule for this Lord You're Still God to open up and make a way Hallelujah I'm telling you I'm a witness of that there's Witnesses of this throughout this room we're not helpless I'm telling you when a heart is determined it says listen ain't let nothing stand in my way you look at what's standing there and say it's a lion vanity it's a lion vanity there's Witnesses throughout this room I'm a witness of that as well it's not a witness to condemn you but you ought to think of it as a witness to say that's a truth it might seem like a big obstacle but there's a great big God on my side [Music] because all that matters at the end of the day is what we've done for the kingdom of God brother Branham when he's talking to Dr Sam Adair his friend there in Jeffersonville brother Batman they just come through an examination and brother Ram is making this statement in the Revelation series he said the greatest thrill I have is living for others and he said that's what life is this is what Dr Sam Adair said that's what makes life real is you know and what not what you can do or accomplish for yourself but what you can do for others that's kind of doctor I'd like to take care of me right I'm not the doctor it says you know what let me see here yeah I need a bigger yacht I'll tell you what you need this surgery I don't want that guy I don't want that guy I don't want him I just give me what I need come on we all know it no matter where you work at I don't care what profession and whatever more we all know people that are there for the wrong reason is that right and they're the ones that get the complaints on I don't want that one I don't want that one a nurse no give me the janitor I'll take the janitor take care of me you know it's the truth same way within teaching and whatever more right now in everything notice that's when you're really living if there happens to be someone Among Us who has never did that try to live for somebody else give that a try and just see how much more life holds for you when you will not live for what you can get yourself out of life but what you can give someone else in life now watch how Brother Band Breaks us down you'll find it's more blessed than riches or anything that can be thought of is what you can do for someone else to make life's burdens because life in itself is a burden can I get an amen on that one life in itself is a burden everybody's burdened and it will make a little lighter for someone else but you see listen think about this has always been but it's even more so in the day you and I are living in because the spiritual condition of this age says I'm rich and I don't have need of nothing it's all about I that's what this age it's an age of I it's an age of self-love it's an age of speak your truth it's an age of do you it's an age that's all about self glorification of self that ain't Godly there's only one truth that we're to speak and that is the truth of God's holy word everything else is alive it will make it a little lighter for someone else and sometimes we have to understand it's true even the busyness of Life can try to work and try to get to us and we just get caught like spinning around you just know the joy unless you've tried it wants to do something for someone else but that brings me to thinking of 31 years see these are certain things I'm just going to drift on this a little bit as it comes to me these are certain things right here of certain sacrifices that are made even when it comes to fellowshipping with one another and I've said this before and I I believe it it's all the way through the scripture it's through the message I believe that I don't understand why we wouldn't want to fellowship with our brothers and sisters come on now I appreciate the sacrifices that are made to have whether it's breakfast or whatever those things to be able to get together and do all this well brother Sammy is sometimes that's not always convenient for me I know been there well I'm gonna preach I'll come down there if I've got to but see what it is it's not about doing something that's convenient for you or that fits you it's doing something for others because if it just happens to work with you or work with me it don't fit come on Friends there's a lot more than preaching the gospel or witnessing to somebody saying there's a lot more that goes to living for others than that because a lot of times for you can never get that you've got to get favor and show somebody you care about them [Applause] and that takes a little bit of prep time sacrifice that brings me to thinking of 31 years will be soon of the ministry for the Lord and I guess every man thinks of sometime when he has to come to his last service and come to his last hour and look back down the path and see what has been accomplished and see what's on have you did anything and I've said it's what you do for others that counts Now watch how brother Brown words this same quote he says I wonder what would be when I got to the end of my road which we don't know what time that's going to be none of us do and I was thinking about looking back down along the trail where I've come through life and seen the different Hills and Briar patches and rocks and hard places and smooth Runnings all them smooth Runnings are nice but I see a lot of hills Briar patches rocks hard places there's a lot more hard than there is smooth right when you just you look back across down lights pathway I did this is important what I did in those kind of times when I will look back down through there what did I do in the Rocky times in the Briar Patch times did I just uh I just you know my flesh might say I can't take another I can't but what did I do in the midst of that time see that's a question each one of us have to answer because everybody has their Briar patches we got to go through Briar patches aren't fun to go through it's there I don't care what you have on it's hard to walk through them you can almost trip I've been through them and hunting you can almost trip fall on your face you're getting scratched you're trying to move things away what about the rocky places where things that doesn't seem to be real on our footing and what about the hills where we're going up coming down smooth places are nice but you also got to be worried weary of smooth places because they can be slippery but what did I do in those kind of times it'll show up one of these days at the hour of my going away as it'll do for each of us notice in second Timothy 2 8 let me just read a few scriptures here watch out Paul and we're dealing with this of a useful life and I want you just to think of it in this way how a useful life itself as we're looking at Job Trials come because of a useful life why that we might be more useful I'm talking to the believer now okay I'm talking to the believer remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel wherein I suffer trouble as an evil Doer was Paul an evil doer no but that's how he was looked at he was regarded as one as a matter of fact they called him out there in the temple about the seventh day hey the Jews from Asia this is the guy that's teaching against the law of Moses misunderstood the Jews threw out misunderstood not all of them because there were many who believed but I suffer why are you suffering trouble because of what I'm standing for and what I'm ministering as an evil doer even unto bonds but the word of God is not bound therefore I Endure all things for the elect's sake so Paul recognizes the trials what I'm dealing with I wouldn't even have to deal with this I wouldn't even have to have this trouble that I'm going through but the reason that this trouble has come is because of the Gospel which I didn't even sign up to preach but he has called me as a prisoner and I for what he has done for me and made known to me against my own will a dispensation of the Gospel is committed unto me so he's endured it for the elect's sake you know I got to thinking of that as I would just meditate and even on some of these things today and you get to looking at suffering when the Bible says love suffereth long enduring and suffering that does not mean that we are building up steam like a pressure cooker well I'm suffering bless God they keep rubbing that ain't suffering that's called you're about ready to blow a gasket that's not enduring because oh Lord don't let somebody touch you at the wrong moment you explode all over them well I've been suffering for so long no you haven't been suffering you haven't been enduring you've been getting bitter and bitter and bitter instead of taking what come your way and really placing It Before the Throne of God and say Lord clean it out of me cleansing them don't let nothing get stuck Lord in my life because remember our suffering even what comes our way think of it Friends The Suffering that comes our way you and I have a choice you and I have both we have all met people that you can get around and you're like oh my Lord it is so bitter because bitter is just exasperating it just it's everything all around everything it's so negative and you're like oh Lord have mercy it's just like that juice that gastric digestive stuff that comes up in your throat and you know you can't hardly get the taste out of it once it comes up you're like Lord have mercy I don't want to be around that stuff what is it it's not the trial that's done bad it's the lack of going to the source of our strength in the midst of the trial oh brother Samuel so and so said this so and so did me wrong I think this or I think that but you've got a source that you can go to so that you don't become bitter are you hearing me friends you can never help anybody if you become bitter as a matter of fact you affect everybody else around you and if you become bitter you become discouraged you need to ask the heavenly father Lord cleanse me and get me get my eyes off myself because I'm too selfish it's all about what's going right here what's going right now is this going good is this going good is this coming that's still about us Paul said we've been made a spectacle I just have to move on here he talked about being a fool for Christ's sake he spoke of hound that he had identified with Christ notice in Hebrews 10 32 caller remembered speaking to us as Believers the former days in which after ye were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions so the enemy's after you after you're illuminated you watch even after a service watch after a good time a good week maybe a good few days of mine it just feels like man you've just been having donuts with the angels hell the time my the visitation and then you watch just right after that how it will be tested we will be tested right that's the thing we will be tested but remember it's not to look around and say oh my Lord where's this test coming from no receive the strength that God is ministering to us at that moment afflictions will come but they will only bring to manifestation what God is already done and is doing in our life don't run from them just give yourself to God partly notice you endured a great flight of Affliction partly while you were made gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly while you became Companions of them that were so used my mama second Timothy 3 12 and Yea all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution the closer you get to God the more trials will come I know that's not like very flattering or very like oh that's that's not even something we're willing to raise our hand for we're just saying yep I agree with that amen amen because our flesh doesn't want trials I don't care who you are your flesh doesn't want trials we don't like them right the flesh is weak we do not like that but notice all that live Godly in Christ Jesus giving ourselves to God as God is moving God is speaking and moving in our life listen sometimes you can't even see the ways that God is dealing with in people's lives and I'll just say for the whole congregation because you know what there's a lot of times that even as a pastor I don't know until there's certain things that gets spoke to me mentioned to me and you begin to see what you cannot see may be out here how God is dealing within people's lives and hearts and you say oh Lord God just keep moving in a certain way but you also realize every time that God deals with the life and the life will give themselves to God you'll always be tested on the grounds that God has given you what do I do at that time don't turn and run that's the time to stand and face the devil down and say God has given this to me God has placed me here and I ain't going back from it [Applause] oh my let me just try to move it down into this here first Corinthians 9 19. watch out Paul speaking of being a servant notice how in words this year for though I be free from all men yet have I made myself servant unto all that I might gain the more now notice I'm free from all men in other words I have no obligation at one time Paul was obligated to you know that of of those carrying out things you know against the Christians he had obligations to other men but now Paul could say I'm free from all men not only do I not work for anybody or under that obligation but I am free I am God's free man but through this freedom and this Liberty that had come to Paul Paul realizes the purpose upon his life that through this Freedom it has gifted Paul with the ability and the grace to make himself a servant unto all people God didn't make him a servant he made himself a servant to all people he was God's serving him that he was an apostle he was a prophet is that right God made him that Paul didn't make himself that nor any other man but when it came to working among the peoples that he would be sent to God entrusted Paul with that part to make himself a servant in other words God said I have condescended and I have ascended back up I have sent the Holy Spirit down into your life I have descended down into your life that you might also condescend as well Oh Glory now Paul didn't become a compromiser he didn't become a compromiser he walked right among them but Paul was not a partaker of their unbelief right he didn't make himself odd he didn't go and spray you know off all over him he didn't make himself odd Paul had confidence in the Liberty he had in his life he had confidence in that are you with me notice First Corinthians 9 20 and unto the Jews I became as a Jew now wasn't he already a Jew sure he was but why did you become as a Jew that I might gain the Jews to them that are under the law as under the law that I might gain them that are under the law they kept Paul when he went even when he went outside of Jerusalem he gathered with them on what they called the Sabbath day Paul didn't say huh buddy we're going we're gathering on Sunday if you want to hear me you wait tomorrow Paul knew this is when they're gathering on what they has been given to them as the Sabbath day Saturday so they're in the synagogue I'm going to go and gather with them what was it making himself a servant when he came into Jerusalem remember when he was there and how that when they came around there in that moment remember how Paul even himself would enter into purification at the discretion of James and the rest of them and said Hey listen there's a lot of believing Jews right here in Jerusalem there's a lot of believing Jews and in order for you to have because they've heard a lot of things they've heard that man just There's No Holds Barred out there among the Gentiles but and there's a lot of things but in order for them to hear you why don't you go with these four men that have vowed themselves with the vow and Paul went with them he shaved his head and Paul would go into that time of purification you realize Paul was stood other things coming into the church but at that moment the wisdom of God he realized in order to reach these Jews it might require me shaving my head entering back into purification according to under the law that Paul knew he was God's free man what was it he made himself a servant to all I think of how Paul when he stood there I mean think of how it must have been when Paul stood there that day that here when Paul was brought before the audience of Pharisees and Sadducees remember that Paul surveying the audience he said oh Lord I got Baptists here got Pentecostals here I got let me see oh I got more Pentecostals glory to God I believe speaking in tongues what was it he'd have one side on his part right what did he say at that time I believe in the resurrection from the dead Sadducees didn't believe that but he had the Pharisees on his side is that right what was it listen you see the wisdom of God if you listen to the message very carefully you can tell the congregation the prophet is preaching to you can tell if he's preaching to them who lean in a calvinistic slant or those who lean in Armenian slant he what will he do he's not going to try to upset him he's going to minister the word that'll reach their lives if you listen carefully to it he deals with it in the Hebrew series he deals with those things it is not just random things being done it is the wisdom of God what not to stop the people up but as a servant have a prophet in this age made himself a servant in order to win lives to the Lord foreign I'll tell you that in itself is not skim milk and I'm not saying because I'm preaching I'm saying because it's the word of God it ain't skim milk it really requires the wisdom of God it requires prayer it requires getting before God because you know what as a Believer we're not walking into situations guns blazing I dare it I'm going to pull out the six shooters and I'm going to shoot them down that is not the spirit of Christ because the spirit of Christ is a spirit that is of life are you hearing me amen that's even when it comes to witnessing so notice how Paul he would do this in order to gain them I think of Timothy you know probably Timothy thought after a while like man you know Paul you know how equal-minded and how but oh how Paul you know he he really loved Timothy but then how Paul had to call Timothy aside one day and say Timothy look we've got to go among some in some synagogues and there's Jews here you're a Greek and they know your daddy's a Greek so I need you to be circumcised now I wonder if Timothy would have stood there and said Paul but remember when those false Brethren came to galatia and they were trying to tell everybody you've got to be circumcised or God won't have nothing to do with you but you see Timothy was yielded to God and he realized what this was all about it was not about that that sign in his flesh through a circumcision In the Flesh that somehow that was going to make him acceptable to God Timothy realize I'm going to get the hindrances out of the way so the gospel can have free course [Applause] because you see what Paul was saying Paul said if anybody's going to be offended there's one thing that can be offended him that's the gospel but it ain't going to be me Lord let that sing to the fifth real glory be to God to them that are without the law as without law being not without law to God but under the law to Christ that I might gain them that are without the law so when Paul went among the Gentiles you you know this you understand it you've read it in the scriptures when Paul went among them Paul had an understanding in his life Christ is the Fulfillment of the law Paul never became sinful Paul did not practice and those in the things that would be sinful but notice Paul was there and my he was enjoying you know BLT a bacon sandwich and you know he enjoyed you know some spare ribs and he was enjoying all these things and Peter got to look and say Lord have mercy these ribs are good man and these things are good but then Brethren came down from Jerusalem and Peter said oh Lord I got to get this bacon grease off of me I need the Listerine to cover the rib breath on my mouth what was it Peter was shaken but you see God had ordained Peter to be a minister to the circumcision is that right now remember Paul was stood him on that say look you got a double standard here right but Paul when he came among that Paul had that Liberty God had ordained him for that he never became sinful but he was able to make himself a servant to move among the people of God now to look at this to the week verse 22 to the weak became I as weak that I might gain the weak what does Paul mean by weak remember Paul took chapters on it through all the other letters there were some who didn't believe in eating this quarter meat or this coming out of here or some certain Liberties and Paul said to those that are weak hey I became weak not putting my Liberties before them but neither of my Liberties being taken away but to the leap I became as weak did he have to do that no did God tell Paul I want you to become weak Paul wants you to become as a Jew Paul I want you to be as without the law God never told him that but the spirit of Christ within him let him to subject himself in order to win some I want you to think of this here in this manner let me finish this I made all things to all men that I might by all means save some and this I do for the gospel sake that I might be partaker thereof with you can I read these next few places to you in the message a new ministry brother Branham was speaking of how in his life the greatest privilege that he's had this was to serve the Lord and he speaks of Brianna if you just go to that third quote under my new ministry and he's talking about I just I was born for this purpose to serve the Lord I just want to serve him that's my heart's desire and what I ask of you would be a prayer for me before you lay down tonight that God would keep me humble in my heart and would help me and bless me so that I could be a blessing to you people I found that's the greatest blessing in life is giving something out not receiving in but giving out what you do for others is what means so much let me just try to drop it down here on this and to end it you see with what we've read the life of the Lord Jesus even in Paul's life one thing you can always you can always count on when being used of the Lord is you're going to be misunderstood you'll be misunderstood gonna be criticized those are two things that come Paul was misunderstood brother Bram tells us Jesus was the most misunderstood person there ever lived his disciples they even looked at him oh now now we know who's speaking every Spirit-filled believer misunderstood because it's it's for the mind to comprehend why decisions are being made as they are because it doesn't make sense to the carnal mind it doesn't make sense to the carnal mind to turn down a job or something that oh my you can make this and this and this and yet you look at and say but if I do this and this and this I'll be out of church I won't be able not just coming to church I won't even be able for God to use me to minister to anybody else in the body how many all tied up and to the carnal mind that doesn't make sense but to the spiritual mind that's led by the spirit of God and you can apply this across the board it comes down to say wait a minute this is the decision according to the word of God and you'll be misunderstood sometimes you're misunderstood by family job was being misunderstood right now misunderstanding is a hard thing because job because even with Paul all of this was taking place Paul was misunderstood he wasn't an evil Doer Jesus was misunderstood you come to destroy the law he said no I come to fulfill it Paul even said it said he even said it straight he had come that the law itself the Holy Spirit has come that it might be established in the heart of the people but it's misunderstood now let me just say this to you because we all have been there maybe here tonight maybe you'll come to it but I want you to just to think of this for a moment even as the son of man came to be ministered or not minister to to minister and to think of it in this way when we are misunderstood when we are criticized how do we look at the source from where the misunderstanding and criticism is coming from because it can be dead wrong how do we look at it do we look at it of oh I'm righteous I'm righteous oh this is all this they're so misunderstanding they're so they're so critical they're so and listen we live in an age it's perpetrated with criticism I mean it's you know that but it's always been they criticized the Lord Jesus even as he hung on the cross said come down come down if you be the son of God he indeed is the righteous one but notice what he said father forgive him because they don't know what they're doing he said brother Sammy what what should we do don't try to fight the misunderstanding don't try to fight the criticism the way to approach that is is realize God permits that in order for us to be more of a useful tool what are we going to do with it because it's that's a part of the flesh these are I'm speaking of Battlegrounds right here tonight I'm talking about Battlegrounds that come in our lives into our lives and you could we could spend our time fighting against misunderstanding and I was misunderstood let me just tell you something when brother Brown spoke and remember uh in in works as Faith Express remember that lady that came in that dream and she told Brother Branham in that dream she said here are these people Behind These Bars and you just you hear all these things that they're saying and she said brother Branham these people have misunderstood you what was the bars misunderstandings and brother Brahm said he looked inside those bars and he saw flickers of light and he said and realize at that moment he says he walked up he looked at those bars he said I couldn't break him with my arms I couldn't do that I didn't have the strength to do it something rolls up in him at that moment I said brother Brown you must you must and he rose up and he said in the name of Jesus Christ House of Hell give way do you realize Satan's in the business of creating misunderstandings are you hearing me he's in the business of doing that but don't look at the source of the misunderstanding as far as the vessel here's here's what you look at is Lord temper me temper me because the Lord Jesus the greatest event of all time was when he went to Calvary and he offered up his will I want you to think as we're closing here I know I'm over time here I remember how many remember in the message images of Christ where brother Brown says while the Tabernacles having a Revival I want a Revival he said I walk I walk I try to walk after God he said but I want to be closer to him I want a closer walk with him he said while they're having Revival I want one in my own life I want to revive it and this is what brother Branham as he as he goes into this he says you know it's going to take I want to be more like him and it's going to take the Holy Ghost to do that and as he he goes on and he makes this statement he says it's going to take it's not going to take seminaries it's not going to take a crucifix it's not going to take all these things it's going to take more of the Holy Ghost and he says it like this I'm interested in one thing and that's more of the Holy Spirit to take over William Branham now listen to this statement I'm not interested in joining a greater Church than what I belong to I belong to the real Church of the Living God the firstborn I was born into it so brother Ram realizes in order in order for him the Holy Spirit take over more of me I don't need to go and run and looks at what it is I need more of me taking over because it isn't the building that I'm a part of I'm already in if I've been born again of the spirit of God I'm in the Church of the firstborn right that's the greatest Church there is I belong to the real Church of the Living God the firstborn I was born into it I want more of the holy ghost in my life to reflect Christ who I love how many say Amen to that now watch what he says here I'm closing I or level I have to come on to to get it I don't care if I have to go here or there or be called fanatic Hollow roller whatever it might be I want more of his life to be reflected I'm interested in the plane I have to come in I'm interested in the Holy Ghost why so I can be more of a servant like he was he was the Lord's servant he never come to be served or to minister to he never come for him to be ministered to but to minister he took the place of a sermon and that so struck me there weeks ago I'm not interested in a plane because many times we were praying we pray Lord I want more and we should I want more of him but to realize some sometimes the way for more of him to come into our life is going to require maybe we're going to be called Holy Roller we're going to be called fanatic we're going to be certain things that will be said and it's going to see how do our feathers react in that time why do we respond but you see this is something Lord I want more of you but in order for him to be more more of him it's got to be less of us sometimes these are the things that we certainly don't sign up for but remember misunderstanding and criticism it comes if it isn't it comes and it will come but remember it's all to temper us because when you're being used of God you're going to be misunderstood right why are you making that decision why are you waiting this long why are you going to be misunderstood all down Through the Ages listen even among us but this is where we have to say Lord in the midst of that time help me to die to my will help me to die to myself help me to die to where all because it's a natural pool within us to defend ourselves there's a natural pool to lay everything out it's a natural it's natural part but oh I don't want to live by the natural I want to live by this Supernatural I want more of God in my life I want more of him and God knows what's needed for you and me to become more useful but Shane we never would choose that we would say to be called names Lord I'm praying for more of the Holy Ghost I'm not and Lord says but this is what needs to be done because there's Avenues and channels that need to be opened up I say God help me how many say Lord help me Lord give me that Grace that I need Lord amen amen let's pray tonight Heavenly Father Lord thank you for the Simplicity in which you deal with our lives Lord amen there's not Lord there's not but one of us that would say Lord from our hearts this is our desire is to have Lord and be a useful life that Lord as we walk upon this Earth the days that we tread here Lord this is our desire is that Christ would be reflected Lord and that our lives would influence Lord someone else to you that would Lord calls that thirst to arise in their hearts Lord even those Lord as Among Us Lord that we might Lord be an encouragement Lord to lift a burden Lord help us Lord I pray in the midst of a of an age in a world that Lord it just wants to enclose even upon us and have us to just consider our own selves Lord help us Lord teach us Lord show us Lord oh guide us Lord I pray Lord that we can just be a tool that's used how however you want to use as you use job in many different ways Lord oh God how you're able to take a tool an instrument in your hands and use us in many different ways Lord I pray father that of everything that you have given to us talents skills gifts Lord our life Lord oh God I pray that father that within it all Lord we want you Lord to be the one Lord who is reflected in using and guiding and directing us Lord because we've got one purpose here Lord and that's to serve you Lord that's to serve one another Lord as to serve the body of Jesus Christ Lord help us Lord when we walk on Briar patches or rocky places they Lord are not easy places to rock to walk but I think of the song that says through many dangerous trolls and snares we have already come but your Grace has brought us safe this far it is safely carry us home Lord help us Lord I pray Lord the grace that we need Lord through the midst Lord God lord of misunderstandings and criticisms Lord that will come but Lord may we have our hearts and our lives just so fixed upon you Lord and Lord when things would arise may we recognize Lord give us Lord of Grace that we might submit ourselves that we might be more of a servant to you Lord and that's not something Lord that we can do of our own self Lord but God you give us Grace Lord and that's the grace that we need Lord each moment Lord and father when situations arise Lord let us always remember Lord that God our life Lord that even in the midst of the rocky times and the Briar of patches Lord is a time for Christ to be reflected Lord oh God a moment Lord that Our Lives might be molded Lord
