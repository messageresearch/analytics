keeps us leading us on we're just thankful for the promises not only that we have been partaker of but through that great promise that he made them send back the Holy Ghost we now we have access to every promise of God and in reality we even a person when God begins to pull on their life God is making known to them the access has already been provided amen it's it's over it's finished and it's just accepting what God has done you know brother Brandon would say it like this we've been dealing with job here on Thursday nights for a while and brother Brown was talking about how job would stand there in the strength of that burnt offering that sacrifice he said oh you say oh brother Brian of my I wish that you know I could I could do that and offer it up brother Brown said actually you've got it easier than job he said because job had to offer up the sacrifice all you have to do is accept because the sacrifice has already been offered us it's already it's already been offered I didn't have to offer it it's been offered once and for all right amen isn't that wonderful man if Joe could stand like that I'm not gonna preach on job this morning but if Joe could stand like that what about you and I what ground that we have to stand on a more sure Promises of God I just love the Lord this morning I don't want to keep you here long I just want to just express some things that the Lord has just placed on my heart and maybe try to lay a little bit of a foundation here for it it looks like even in a few services to come so we just want to kind of look at that and I don't think there's any am I missing any announcements honey I'm getting there I'm getting there I'm surprised if you ever see her with her phone now she's probably texting me yeah I would sometimes I always feel like I'm forgetting something when I get here and she is my helper she writes the notes for me and you know just like uh you know it's like brother Rock was good to have you back yes amazing Caroline's sister and then it was good to have you back they were here on Thursday and I told sister Caroline after service I said of course everybody that you all know me I it's it's not a positive thing but I'm just maybe in one way it is but I'm just so one-track mind when I come here it's announcements and everything he does such a wonderful job for me on that right there taking care of announcements and if I don't get it my wife has the notes coming to me but we love you in the Lord and I certainly want to say Merry Christmas to you Amen to each and every one you know and and if uh if that bothers you you can look it up in the message brother Brandon said it over and over sure you know and I that's why I you know for myself when I look at certain things I see how brother branham's approach within in the message of the hour and I also look at the life that was lived behind that and that's why if we try to make the quote say a certain thing and it's not matching up with what was being expressed then I look at all the way through there and said wait a minute there's a point that's being made here yes it is there's a real Point that's being made here and so I I'm just I'm thankful to God because I I believe with all my heart that when God sent this message the prophet not only delivered it but he was the example of what this message is all about right I could read you a quote of what T.L Osborne said t Osborne said when we saw William Branham we saw Jesus Christ once again in flesh not making William Branham Jesus Christ but he said we have seen him yeah we forgot but I'm grateful God brought a real present reminder to you and I in this hour you know what that reminder was all about it was about you and I that's what it was all about the relationship that God desires for you and I that's the that's the whole whole purpose of it amen well amen what a wonderful song service amen these brothers did Brothers do such a wonderful job and the the musicians I so appreciate them could we just give just a thank you and I tell you that uh what was that song you were singing was it heart Herald my goodness I tell you you know these songs these songs were not written as Christmas carols you understand when you go back and you rejoy to the world I know that the world but you also know Elvis Presley used to sing Amazing Grace but he don't have rights on Amazing Grace you know the reason they would sing I mean Elvis Presley could sing it but you know as far as their notes but he couldn't sing it from experience right so these are things the world don't have no claim on this the world's tried to claim it but talk about brought to you and I the second birth Lord have mercy I was just sitting back in the office you know I hear these songs but I'm listening to and I thought Lord have mercy you're talking about inspiration yes right I mean these are songs that are written and sometimes some of the song readers nowadays songwriters could take note about it instead of just repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat repeat let's get a message let's get a message that's tracked I know I got a Preach Today amen God bless you amen listen could we just stand for the reading of the word amen just Good To Be With You amen this morning amen I'm just going to look here in the scriptures here and we'll just see how the Lord will take us this morning because I I just don't want to um overload in this at all either and I know I I always feel that way with things I don't want to overload and I just want to be very cognizant of the time as well and I know I I am I do have a timer before me at all times but today I really do I just want to be able to move here into a point and um we just want to look at Matthew chapter 2. amen and I'm going to read just a few verses of scripture then we'll let you have your seats maybe verses 1 and verse 2 and then we'll just let you have your seats here amen the Bible says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem now notice they're coming from the East they're traveling to the West saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship Him you know they've asked the question but that question holds a certainty in it where is he because we've seen the sign now we know he's here where is he now I want you to look they've traveled from the East to the West when the Shepherds came and I'm not going to speak on the Shepherds this morning but when the Shepherds because the nativity scenes that we see a lot of times don't have the Shepherds and the wise men they're together and the truth of it is they weren't there these are two separate time periods the Shepherds were there at the announcement of the birth the wise men are here after the babe now it's no longer babe but a child two years old because remember when Herod asked the question when did you see this star they said and they had to give him when did you see it and how long you've been on this journey that's how Herod knew when he sent them in kill every child that's two years and under right so here we find I want you to think of this here was the Shepherds they came and saw the Babe in a Manger but when the wise men called that child was standing on its feet so if you can also see the see the parallel from the Bride of Jesus Christ here is a bride that was born in infancy now the bride is standing on the feet yes sir that's so good so I'd like to speak this morning if the Lord would help us just to deliver a little bit of a of a thought on guided to the word made flesh let's bow our heads in a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord these few moments that you've given us the Lord to be able to come together Lord we ask that you'll take control Lord father right now Lord and ask that you would deliver Lord those things that you pressed on My Heart Lord standing on this platform a couple weeks ago Lord that inspiration just struck me Lord and I'm asking that you'll come and just deliver Lord I want to be sensitive to you Lord to know when I've said enough Lord may you bless your children this morning in a special way oh God make your presence just draw near to every heart May every heart just welcome you Lord and just Lord that you find a place in every one of our Lives oh God we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you you're being seated so if we can continue on reading here in Matthew 2 verse 3 if you wouldn't mind maybe to keep your Bibles there when Herod the king had heard these things he was troubled in all Jerusalem with him so Herod knew when when you make it a statement to a King and Herod is ruling over this jurisdiction and the question becomes where is he that's born King of the Jews that's speaking a threat to his kingdom yes it is and he didn't realize that Jesus wasn't coming to bring a threat to an Earthly Kingdom a Heavenly kingdom was making an entrance the kingdom of God was coming into the Earth and it was not going to come come under the Nations or the kingdoms of this Earth but we're talking the kingdom of God to come down and bring a Deliverance in the hearts and lives of his subjects that we would no longer walk by the prince of power of the air that we would no longer be moved by that of our first birth but that we would receive a real true Liberty being born of that Kingdom and live as subjects in this Kingdom and Herod thought what what's this what's this that's coming he's troubled about it but in verse 4 he gathers all the chief priests and scribes of the people together and he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah are not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel so they're pulling from the scriptures from the prophecy they know the prophecy of what God has spoke concerning the coming of the Messiah they are able to take the scribes and Priests are able to take when Herod asks where should the Christ be born they're able to take him here because it's been announced in scripture his pathway has been clearly identified all through scripture Isaiah 9 6 Isaiah 7 14 all of these places it's not something that has laid uh as though that well nobody knows they knew the places by prophecy but to think of it these scribes and these Pharisees and I'll get to it here in just a moment they did not see the Heavenly sign they knew the prophecy but they were unaware that the prophecy was in fulfillment as a matter of fact this right here when this is being when I'm reading this here we're reading it together this is two years after it's already taken place and they're not aware of it yet they're aware of Prophecy but they're not aware that God has already come and God has fulfilled and is fulfilling this word you see oh how this joint rejoices my heart because you don't have to be a smart person to know the Lord Jesus you don't have to God doesn't want our intellects because our intellects can't figure God out all God wants is our heart that's the whole purpose of his coming is to reclaim that part that rightfully belongs to him because if God has our heart then there is nothing that's impossible Herod perhaps we'll speak on that and sometimes in Herod when he had privately now notice he calls the wise men together he inquires of them diligently what time the star appeared so remember his whole purpose that he's got an objective in what he's doing and his objective it's full of Deceit what's the next verse he's and he sent them to Bethlehem so he communicates to them yeah here it is down in Bethlehem and he says go and search diligently for the young child notice he didn't say go search for the baby I know we understand these things but it's very important that he says go for the young child now notice and when you have found him bring me word again then I may come and worship him what Herod was speaking in deceit he had the wrong motive he had the wrong wrong objective but let me just say this to you God's word cannot be defeated Satan can try to turn the tables against you he can try to come at you try to come at me but God is watching over his word and Satan can try to hinder it he can try to prevent it but he can't stop the word from coming to pass he can't prevent that he can't stop it in your life he can try to send all sorts of thoughts he can try to send all sorts of discouragement he can try to hinder he can try to stop but you see you can't stop that word from coming to pass and here God is standing there too make known within all of this because as the wise men remember when they eventually when they go they God speaks to them in a dream and they realize we need just to depart back into our homeland a different way because Herod seeks of a different objective he's coming to kill the children he doesn't want to worship Him so I want to draw our attention here to the promise in Isaiah 7 14 here just if you just bear with me just a few moments allow me just to lay this in for this service and then building for the next service here and Isaiah 7 14. the Lord himself here's a problem here's a prophecy the Lord himself shall give you a sign so this is not something that is going to be handed out by a man it's God himself giving the sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now this promise had been known throughout all Israel Isaiah 9 6 as well all of these promises and remember how brother random tells us which would be natural thinking if you listen if they were Jews and you hear you were and you had a daughter wouldn't you also be looking and say this is possibly going to be my daughter this will possibly be mine why because the Bible said a virgin shall conceive and so every every true Jew was looking oh my every true Jewish brother Brown brings in and spoke a word's original C was looking with this expectation now for those parents who really didn't care about anything they didn't let the children do whatever but there was some real believing Jews who said I believe the word I believe God has entrusting us with with the with a leadership in this hour God's Gonna fulfill his word and if it's not in my generation it's coming nothing can stop it and so they lived and they raised their families with an expectation that you're the one I believe we should live that kind of an expectation in our lives the promise of the Rapture has been a promise but we're the people we're the people of the Rapture we're the people that the prophets have spoke about we're the ones that the scriptures have prophesied about I believe it ought to be that real to you and I that even as the word is coming forth we can look at it and say God you're speaking to me I'm the one the one the one the word's talking about this message is about me this message is for me this message came from me if it wasn't for nobody else it was for me that's how personal it becomes a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel so his name that will be given or the title with it is that of God With Us it's declaring with us is God and this would be the sign that God would give that it would be God With Us God Among Us remember God's whole purpose once you just to capitalize on just a moment the whole purpose is that God might dwell in man he had that in Eden man is his Temple right not so much this yet Paul would say your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost but remember the Tabernacle the temple had three courts and remember that no man because this body is the way that it is now it came between the section it was a sexual sexual act that came between a father and mother and coming together right even though our hair color eye color and all that that was all ordained by God but yet the way we came was a permissive will but remember he's Jehovah Jireh so the real Temple is that seed on the inside that a place that God has reserved for himself that is the holiest of holies that's where the presence of God comes that's where life begins in the place of rest that's where the new birth is is in the soul that's the temple of God and then from there it radiates through our spirit it radiates out into the flesh it covers all three courts no you're not your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost so that's God's purpose that's the whole that's the whole Canon of the scripture is that God might come and dwell once again inside of his people so brother Brandon would say it like this and we have seen his star and we've come to worship Him he said I want to wish you the merriest of Christmas and that God will send his star from the East that Rose in the East 1900 years ago and will guide you to the word made flesh now notice what he says here it's very important that God will send his star from the East that Rose in the East see the same son who Rose in the East that that same sun will rise again and lead us to the word may flesh remember the Bible says in the book of Isaiah let's turn here just for a minute as it comes to me Isaiah 59 maybe they can pull it up on the screen for me Isaiah 59 I want to read that just as it's coming here to me Isaiah 59 yes Isaiah 59 verse 19. notice how this is worded in verse 19. so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West notice God's rising in Authority rising in the west what is the West it speaks you can go no further west you're back East again that scripture has been fulfilled in the end time because it has Rose remember this ministry it Rose in the west it was all signifying the cloud all of that it signified judgment is at hand but notice he returned back to you and I to pick us up that we might come into that expression think of it all of this is is not just it's not just happenings the prophet receives that Revelation there there in subpino Canyon he receives that Authority and he goes back East why this is where you and I are at and we've got to come into that place with God God came and found you and I where we were that's the thrilling let me finish reading the scripture so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West remember his name is his character his life and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him so what's the standard well standard well it's a rallying point it's a banner but the standard of the Lord is where God makes his word more real you don't have to add to it he makes it more real how does God make his word real by the word taking on flesh that's the standard of the word and when that standard because what is a standard you're going to a workplace and we can go here and there's standards what is the standard a standard is what we are called to and that's why this word for you and I it's the standard of the hour that has called us to the standard that the word would be made flesh in US that's the standard of the word so this thought here you know I said just a couple weeks ago on a Sunday service that we were speaking on we've been speaking on the power of the word and I just it just was all I remember is back in here and it this thought just so struck my heart of I just was so overwhelmed the presence of the Lord of that the reality of this message has opened and revealed to us the path of life I I just I was overwhelmed here in in that moment in the in the part of the after service after praying because God promised that he would send to us the spirit of truth how many knows the Holy Ghost has called the spirit of Truth it's a spirit of Truth to lead and guide us and that he would make himself known the way that he always has how does he make himself known by vindicating his word making his word live because he's the only one can that can do that and this is this is the blessing within it we are delivered from confusion you know what confusion is the very word of that Babel Babylon the Bible calls it mystery Babylon right now her religion is spread throughout all the Earth is confusion it started look look how it starts so innocency it starts so innocency remember my brother Brian will say well we talk about juvenile delinquency but see it traces on our back brother answered well you couldn't have juvenile delinquency without parent delinquency and you can't have the parent delinquency without Pulpit delinquency amen see it all comes back to our lives we're meant to be under the leadership of the word of God that's the blessing i that's the blessing the word of God has all that we have needed but I'm talking about the person of Jesus Christ and to see that how the within that look where it's got to in the time and the age that we are in right now that people don't know what they are but do you understand that confusion started when things started telling people that shaking hands is the new birth well just accept Jesus Christ as your savior you're born again you see these starts things like that we want how did he get this it starts as little seeds things start drifting and drifting drifting drifting when it brings confusion I've sent and talked to her with their you know been relatives that here they are were uh people and prominent people within their organization and they can't understand because they saw another person here uh that was married to one of their children well he spoke in tongues and I mean you know see they're stuck on that evidence where you speak in tongues you've got the Holy Ghost and they're stuck I've seen him speak in tongues and I don't know how I could go and do this I don't know so there's questions that rise why because they realize they're holding to this but that's not grounded upon the word of God I tell you that when I look at things like that it don't cause me to look down on people it cost me to want to go in a corner and cry and say thank you Lord for your mercy because who am I am en who am I right see God's you see what God's desire the reason this message come is to Deliver Us from confusion you and I could walk every day with an assurance like job that no matter what accusations come around us we've got an assurance I've met God's requirements I don't care who says what I don't care what comes in my body I don't care what comes around it I know I've met the requirements well thank God for that deliverance from confusion where we can know where we're standing we know where we're at you know how it is if anybody's ever called you you know saying if anybody's ever called you and said Shane I'm lost first question you're going to ask hey where are you at right now I don't know it's kind of hard to help them right I mean I know we got GPS and things now but you know you got to watch GPS I've it's taken me in places in a city that uh there was not a was not a hospital and they told me I wanted to go to a hospital and I showed up in somebody's driveway or help me get out of here quick because I realize where I'm at I'm watching a GPS and I realize where I'm at hey I'm not in the right place it's not a good place to be in but you know what somebody got to know where they're at right before you know we can say this is where you're going this is where we need it but you need to know where you're at if you know where you're at then you know where you need to go then you just follow and you move in that pathway you move in that direction God's provided leadership for us within this moment so think about how almighty God he orchestrates everything to serve his purpose and to fulfill his word and all things have to be in position think about this with with with Mary and Joseph going back into this moment they it was necessary that the baby that here the coming he would be born in Bethlehem God knows how to get us in position brother Brown tells us that Joseph no different from us he's kind of grumbling about the tax situation on the way down nice out of visitation but he's kind of grumbling on the way down I mean because who wouldn't you have to load up you have to pack up yeah and then your wife any moment is due right sure I mean it just you know all everything so he's kind of grumbling I love how the prophet had dramatized that you know it brings what it does you know the one thing about it does it does God's Not interested in trying to hide Humanity he just makes known that my grace is sufficient and is greater than your Humanity God's not ashamed of that this this is that's why brother Brian could say this is not the book of man it's the book of Prophecy it's God's book God God don't take out things that aren't so glorious but God leaves those things in there if he was like oh how could David do it oh how could but God leaves that in there and God says I want to show you that there's no situation that's beyond Redemption praise the Lord glory be to God I'm having a good time how about you did by going to come into place and to think how Paul Paul if I just refer to this just just a moment here Paul speaks of how what God has given to him how many remember where Paul will speak about the mystery of God that's been committed to him Paul speaks about the ministry that's been committed to him the purpose is that we would fulfill the word of God that's that's the the this word has been delivered and Paul would say in regarding that and that whole purpose is that it would be Christ in us the hope of glory and that's what you and I this is what we're guided to this is why God provides the guide of the Holy Spirit and he works through faithful guides that are able to step aside that he might reflect his life to direct us to that rightful place of the word made flesh in our lives let me just let me move on here into into this place here you see there was no answer perhaps we'll come to that here in just in some time here there was no answer in Jerusalem when they got there no answer at all they knew that written word but they did not recognize the sign in the visitation what you think about these wise men when we look at the wise men here they were making a journey they had studied they had studied with these Stars they they studied this and they knew there was going to be a crossing that you think of it how men have tried to say oh that's just a natural occurrence but God orchestrated those heavenly bodies to come in line at a specific time these minutes studied this but this star was not just some ordinary star this was that same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel it was the same almighty God think of it it's a phenomenon that here they are that that is being seen and here it is it's standing out it's unusual but here's the thing these men remembered there was a prophet down here when Israel was in Exile by the name of Daniel you see sometimes we wonder why we're in certain situations it might just be to drop a word for God to quicken in a certain season sometimes we become we become despondent because we think well it doesn't seem like they're taking the word maybe God's called you to drop that word right there at that moment just just trust God God doesn't sow his word in vain the word will be quickened in the right season these men were directed back to those writings where Daniel led by the spirit of God could reach back and pull out that of balaam's Prophecy Balaam was a false prophet but notice the spirit of Truth is able to catch truth that was spoken there that a star shall arise out of Jacob a scepter shall arise out of Judah the spirit of Truth was able to reach back and Pull and identify that and they could see that and know this is what was prophesied let me just say this to you it was something that just gripped their hearts they couldn't explain it no more than you can explain it when it just starts taking a hold of your heart and it's moving and it's directing it here they start packing up notice the Bible says in verse 9 of Matthew 2 when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was and once you notice what star they had been following all along the guide now when they leave out of Jerusalem as soon as they get out of Jerusalem here they see the star once again Simon what are you saying I'm saying that there's a lot of things that look when God's dealing these these men were on a journey there's a lot of things that can come your way to try to dim the light Brothers I mean what should I do if there's anything that gets between you and that light it's the world get it out of the way anything that gets between that remember when the earth gets between the Moon and the Sun it brings an eclipse so when the world gets between you and the son the world brings its shadow what is the shadow Gloom Darkness doubt and it starts it's just the world right so anything that is wanting to take away as though uh your journey was nothing no no they began that journey by a supernatural leading you've begun this journey by a supernatural leading and we've got a destiny it's all it's all die we shall be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah we've got a promise the Holy Ghost is a sure promise whatever that is to your heart this morning remember don't allow things to come between you and the star the leading of the Holy Spirit a lot of things going to want to come but remember what is it doing it leads them until it comes over to where the young child was it stands over the young child so the star is there to identify this is him who you are searching for this is him the sign was declaring he's on Earth and that sign they followed is what pointed to them this is him oh man it's all I can do to hold back and when they saw that star they rejoiced they rejoiced I just say it in this manner here nobody else saw that star brother Brandon would say it just perfectly like this and he would give us examples in the scriptures remember when Paul was on the road now you could take even go in the book of Acts and one place it'll say the men heard the voice and then none of them just says they didn't hear the voice then over here it says they saw the light and then it says they didn't see the light you say well that sounds like that's contradictory no not at all what it is it had no meaning to them it had no meaning to them it was just the light that's why brother random could say he said a person can get up and say bless God I saw the pillar found brother Brown says judge it by the life you leave after you've saw it see not just hold a pillar Oh Glory to God this month's testifying to those things and seeing it right here in the services and that's not something that's a new occurrence how we think God for coming but look God doesn't do that it's not for me that's for you that's for you and me right that's that's for us but see if I'm think about it nobody else saw it I mean when because when they came herod's herod's looking and thinking what are you talking about you talk to the scribes and friends what are you talking about a star they didn't see it remember when John the Baptist was baptizing nobody else saw the pillar of fire nobody else saw the dove coming down John saw it right because he was ortained to see it he was supposed to see it he had a place in the scripture and let me tell you something right now it wasn't your smarts or my smarts my intellector your intellect that figured this out this message is the grace of God that has come to you and I and Found You and I you see why do I believe it because you ordained to believe it you were wrote in the prophecy and you can't escape that you can't get away from that there can be things in your life that's trying to put out the life but there's something that can't be stopped and that's the desire that God has placed within your life for this word to be made flesh in you Hallelujah you ordained to see it blessed are your eyes let's see Hallelujah that's why brother Randall could say it like this when you're looking for it because the Magis were looking for it when you're ready to receive the real Christmas present the real Christmas gift God's Christ's gift the Holy Spirit you're looking for it I don't know about you I look for Christmas gifts oh brother Samuel saying oh I can pay you know I preach on these things I can load a bundle of quotes brother Branson I'm just like a kid on Christmas morning I can't wait to open my gift I'm not if you don't know that's okay but I just understand you see all that right there was only pointed to one thing God was going to come down and God was going to wrap himself oh it wouldn't be in beautiful tinsel as a matter of fact they'd look on that package and say people as a man despised and rejected oh they don't have beautiful bows on it but what was inside of that package Oh Glory what was in that package was a blood that could pay for every sin that it was also a life that can be released to bring Deliverance to bring release to bring healing to bring everything that you and I have needed it didn't look good on the outside but oh what was on the inside was Jehovah what a real Christmas present maybe God didn't wrap it so nice and neat like everybody else oh they get the corners folded and all that right there I appreciate all that just buy a bag but you don't understand god well how did God wrap it up he wrapped it up by his word every word upon word upon word everything well you didn't have to have scotch tape to hold it together it was held together by the leadership of the Holy Ghost it was the Holy Spirit that was bringing this corner to this corner to this to this to this it was perfect what was it God identifying the word made flesh the woman at the well she saw it as the word may flesh brother Brian the same people in the temple saw him and said PLC Bob fortune teller well it looked like they had more credentials to recognize him God ain't looking at outward credentials it's that on the inside something that just reaches out I said I know that's God I know that's God oh he said you're looking for it you'll see it it's a Heavenly light sent down from God out of heaven to Bear record of Jesus Christ I think about this for two years they followed it two years we know that like I said with the scriptures why did God guide them mad jobs they were guided not by a GPS in one way it was I think it was brother Daryl Ward that mentioned that GPS God's positioning services I mean it was just yeah they were directed you know brother Brown dramatized he said they would sit down brother Shane he said they would sit down for the day they would in the daytime they would fellowship and oh man and it's so wonderful thank God for his grace he said at night here that star would be there he said they would just load back up and keep on heading down the way and they would have that Fellowship but why did God guide them why what was it that God made sure that they didn't get tangled up let me think about their Journey their Journey they could have been killed they were Bandits right I mean the bandits things everywhere I mean just like there's certain places in certain cities and certain cities in certain places in this city there's certain places you you know we know better than the goal right right right it's just like when I you know even when I went into Mexico you know as I talked to some brothers in the place I was going and said yeah you're good just make sure you you you're not gonna be going off by yourself you stay with the people you know that are there with you and bring you okay that's that's what I do and I made sure I did that but you see they have the right gifts they had the right gifts and look how let me I want to read this here this this statement that brother Branham has made here how that they have these right gifts can I have just a couple more minutes I'm doing good I'm doing good here I'm doing good my excitement Manhattan I'm doing good let me just drop these in that God guided the Magi because they had the right gifts I want you to think about your own life how why and how God has guided you God guided these wise men because they had the right identified gift to identify his son wise men today rise in the name of the Lord not with some fictitious something but with the gift that God promised for this day and God will guide you to identify that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there you are wise men now remember in the scripture there's the parallel the wise and the foolish virgin right the wise version is that which took oil in her land the wise virgin was one that responded to the call she was one who was made ready and to think God guides these wise men because they had the right gifts to identify him in this day once you think of this brother Brown was picking this up and he goes very he goes very slowly within this message God's gifts always find their places and he's just stopping and he's he said I hope the church is getting it right now he said for this lady you'll see an age the gift is fitting for the age we're living in so you see God ordained the promise of Malachi 4. Luke 17 30. all of those promises you say oh that was about brother Branham no brother Branham happened to be the veil but those promises was for Jesus Christ to identify himself as the word made flesh that would call you and I into our rightful place remember why did God watch over these gifts remember brother Branham remember he was going to put his hand upon the wire when he's when his daughter and them had passed away it didn't work brother bam found himself on the ground I've said this before I said I wonder if anybody was driving by the power line that day and how they saw it because he didn't touch it but how he ended up on the ground well you say what you want brother REM never said this but brother Brown says I don't know how I got there but see how how God had a way of just placing his Prophet there on the ground why it wasn't time for him to go remember the gun we preached about that before the gun he lines it up boom and the doctor said I don't know how your head's still on your shoulders why because the gift had to fully identify Jesus Christ it's the purpose that's why when we look at the seventh seal the coming of the Lord remember it's the his coming in the fullness of his Spirit to make a people ready that his fullness would live inside of you and I that's that's the whole Simplicity of the seven seal it's Christ coming into his Temple coming into his body of Believers and that's why we're caught away from traditions of man were being caught away from we realize it's not a tradition It's A Love Affair it's a relationship so it's identified so think of this that gift that God provided was to do what to identify Jesus Christ think how brother Brown would tell us about John the Baptist remember he talked about how John he said you know God took John out in the wilderness he said what did John had stayed around in Jerusalem you know had the people coming up and say hey hey you know your daddy your daddy's got a position down there and you know you'd announce the Messiah brother so-and-so he's a good looking guy over there good stature guy man he's got all his p's and q's remember my brother Ram talks about that John would have all that you'd have people coming around and pressuring you you need to select this guy you need it but God knew what he was doing because God already knew God already provided for himself a lamb God knew when it was time to be identified and God moved John out to that place and here John he was in position to announce him it was the gift that was fitted for the age are you with me now that gift that was fitted for the age now you know what that means when that has come to you when it's come to me when you and I can see that word made flesh you know what that's about it's God letting you know I want to be I want to live in your flesh I want to live behind your flesh what you see on the platform dominion over every spirit I want to manifest that through your life I want that Victory to be made manifest or you're like remember we're guided to the word made flesh not when we get to where the word is made flesh we fall down as though to say oh this is this is it no we know what it's about the word is made flesh there it's God identifying I want to identify myself in your flesh it's the whole purpose that's the whole coming is don't get too big on that trigger finger just attached see this is why so think think think as we bring as I'm bringing this down here I've only got a couple minutes but how God brings us into this place God guided those gifts because they were the gifts to identify him God has guided you has guided me well somebody cut me off God guided you guided me for what because within your life within your life just like within my phone there's a little card in here you call me I've already I'm in the network you've got to have the number inside of there you call that number you send a text hey I'm going to get it I've got a device I'm connected I'm baptized into the body into the network I'm I'm activated you understand I'm activating my little that little SIM card that little thing that's so small it's it's activated I can send and receive messages right I can download Visions I'm in videos I can I can get into those realms all right that's how it is with you and I it's not about it's not that we put ourselves here we haven't made ourselves see this it's God In His Amazing Grace why has God guided your life why has God watched over your life and over my life you say brother Samuel I've been raised in a message church I was raised in a message home but why has God watched over our lives to bring us to this place because in our lives don't tell me I thought we were to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the gift of the Holy Ghost comes to the real gift that's from God things that are to be that real gift from God is your soul what is it it's God uniting with God what is it Emmanuel God With Us the purpose of his coming was so that his life could be rendered blood cell opened that the life itself could make its way could come to you and I and here we are standing in 2022 and the Holy Spirit coming right through the word in this hour vindicating himself to be the same yesterday today and forever what does he do he guides us to the word made flesh we can look at that as we're hearing the message that's the same Jesus that's the same almighty God as the prophet could say oh he says can you get it now it's not I'm the son of man but I am a son of man revealing these son of man I'm not the one who has done these things I was only present when he did them what was it the word made flesh that was pointing and calling and drawing upon you and I and God sounding Out through this message that I want to be made flesh in your life you're the reason this message came you're the reason that I was born so you could be born again Hallelujah this is why God has guided you and I into this place and that's why brother Randall could say it just so simply like this he says if we can just look away wise men today he said just wanting to look away from all churchanity look away from just emptiness of Creeds emptiness and I I believe people are trying look God's going to have people that will stand in the tribulation they will come out of that system they'll have to they'll they'll have a choice in that time in the tribulation they're going to have a choice if they remain in that look the mark of the beast is going on already but if they remain in that and remember they're going to be pressures there's like pressures that comes right now and you can see all around people can cave to pressure that's why you must be pressurized now by the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is what helps you and I to withstand all the pressure of the world so the wise men today look away from church annity because it's emptiness I I don't want I don't want emptiness that's not what God promised God promised a real filling but the same word today to think there's a longing there's a DEET that calls it deep let me say this to you we are blessed to hunger and thirst after righteousness you're blessed you're blessed to have a hunger in your life a desire that says Lord be glorified in this Temple but the same sometimes it just seems like I maybe sometimes I feel like I'm going Beyond Myself no no wait let's just put that in perspective you know what that is that's a groaning within you because new life has come in and it's a desire Lord be glorified in this Temple Lord what is it it's the Zeal of the Lord moving in your life let me close as soon as they left the star come back on Abraham says when we're willing to lay aside all those other things he said then we can say I think this is this to me is so fitting these are these are words to take Lord Jesus guide me to that perfect light if we just say that just think listen how many believe this is a Vindicated word how many know that to be the truth let me just read this to you say Lord Jesus guide me to that perfect light and watch something Supernatural happen the holy spirit will come in a phenomenal way let's say I can't figure it out you don't have to say Lord Jesus guide me to that Perfect Light what's that perfect light what's that perfect light is him he's the light that lighteth all men right Song of Solomon describes the the bride the bride she has she comes in and what happens her light continues to shine it's in the morning but then it continues to shine brighter and brighter through the day that's the same way with your walk with God it gets brighter and brighter and brighter so follow the supernatural the Heavenly sign and they followed that sign until the word was made flesh they saw the young child standing there they didn't see a baby these wise men they saw the young child here they were on that Journey and that star they didn't keep on saying oh star where they realized they knew what that star was about that star was guiding them to the word made flesh we've seen the sign now where's he at they knew where's he at so they weren't looking for another star to arise they knew the star served its purpose it's led me to the word made flesh it's led me for what my soul has been longing for glory be to God that's why in The Book of Revelations when John is standing there and John has given a personal tour by that prophet John falls down to worship him in the prophecies see thou doest did not you're not to present your life to me you present it to the one who's reflected through me glory be to God it's God's desires for the word to be made flesh in you worship Jesus Christ worship God and how do we worship Him by giving our all to him oh my less bar heads Heavenly Father Lord just Desiring in everything just to be obedient and we see Lord you're leading I I and nothing is by chance with you Lord everything is so perfectly placed and ordered we see that Lord over and over even in this as we look in the scriptures the Lord I pray here this morning if there's one Lord that God that in their Journey Lord maybe I think the Lord could they could say right out of their heart even right now right where they're at they could say Lord guide me to that Perfect Light Lord I want to know you I desire that assurance that of the word made flesh inside of my life Lord you guide me the spirit of truth that's Lord tugged upon my heart that's moved Lord and drawing me Lord may they just may they just say that in a simple way that's how your Prophet put it so simple just say Lord guide me to that perfect light and then expect the phenomenal expect the supernatural to happen how God will continue to lead and guide Lord if the Lord in any Lord in any life if one may be on their Journey to the Holy Ghost to the word made flesh maybe Lord others of us Lord that has come to that place but yet we're still on a journey we don't stop until we're back home so Lord no matter where we're at may we recognize Lord that just like when the wise men came into Jerusalem they came to a place that they thought could help them but you're the one who had been guiding them all along as soon as they departed they saw the star that had led them safely thus far they begin to rejoice and Lord you're the same God that if Darkness if the world if Gloom if doubt friends oh Lord all those things that I know that you're able to discern and go right through very personally in our lives if there's been anything Lord that's crowded out or tried to take that out of our Lives Lord May right here this morning we depart from that Lord turn from it and Lord look to you the one who has guided me safely thus far to take me safely home granted Lord to where the very atoms of this body will be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye thank you Father for this day thank you Lord for providing your word to guide us into this precious place of where the word is made flesh in our lives Lord oh how we thank you Lord thank you for Lord coming thank you for the Simplicity thank you for the humility Lord how did it bypass all of the minds of the theologians Lord they were looking for a general they were looking for someone to Stamp Out the Roman army but you gave him just what they needed you gave him a baby they needed a baby and Lord in our lives we can look for a lot of other things but what we need is a birth that birth Lord is what is the Conquering power in our lives we thank you Father for your mercy now Lord as we just draw strength from you may we lord just continue to give our lives to you father Lord we love you and we thank you Father in the name of Jesus Christ amen won't you love him you might say brother Sammy you didn't get to where they presented the gifts well I thought I was but he told me back they're different and it proved out so we got some time to go here but you know the message like this you know brother Brian we can preach this in July right sure I know how I use the month July you get people say Christmas in July you know wrong choice of a month right but truth truth is it not true the whole purpose it doesn't change the whole purpose God coming down and becoming one of us he came that he might know what the struggles of a teenager are right that he might know what it is to go through all those pressures that he might know what it is as a man and when I say man I talk to you about a mankind he would know he could be the right kind of a mediator for you and I and that most of all that through that he could pay the price and he could send the holy spirit that same life that brought forth that creation and send that into you and I and we become a new creation where you've got ground to stand on and say I know who I am I know what God's Grace has done for me I know I'm not the same person that I used to be God has changed my life something has happened that I can't explain it well what happened something just began to pull up on my heart someone sitting next you say well I didn't see anything I didn't see anything my brother Bram said just like the wise men he said right here in this building this morning he said that star can move right across this audience and it moves and a life has changed just like that and it's reflected it's reflected don't you love him don't you just want to just Lord with all my heart I just want to open just all of my heart I just a fresh dedication Lord I received that Christmas gift I received that I received that Lord I just want more of you brother Bram stands at the end

there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love love wasn't that love every day every day I'm still amazed there's only one thing left to say wasn't that love oh wasn't bad love [Music]
