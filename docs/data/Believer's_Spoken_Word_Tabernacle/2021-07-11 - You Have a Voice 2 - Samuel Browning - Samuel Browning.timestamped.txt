[46:16] i'd want to go to verse verse 8.
[46:22] am i out here do i have some in here
[46:24] okay
[46:27] i'm going to really need that
[46:33] verse 8 and thou shalt number
[46:37] seven sabbaths of years unto thee
[46:40] seven times seven years
[46:44] and the space of the seven sabbaths of
[46:46] years shall be unto thee
[46:48] forty and nine years then
[46:51] shalt thou cause the trumpet of the
[46:54] jubilee
[46:55] to sound on the tenth day of the seventh
[46:58] month
[46:59] in the day of atonement shall you make
[47:02] the trumpet sound
[47:03] throughout all your land
[47:07] and you shall hallow the 50th year and
[47:10] proclaim liberty throughout
[47:11] all the land unto all the inhabitants
[47:14] thereof
[47:15] so notice these are this is a set time
[47:17] by god
[47:18] this is not something that israel that
[47:21] has come up with this
[47:22] is the feast of the lord they are
[47:24] appointed seasons of god
[47:26] and god has already declared this that
[47:28] in this
[47:29] time you're to cause the trumpet to
[47:32] sound throughout all your land and the
[47:34] 50th year
[47:36] you shall hallow and proclaim liberty
[47:39] so if we're not asking anybody can we
[47:41] proclaim liberty
[47:42] god has a set time this is the time of
[47:45] liberty
[47:46] it shall be a jubilee unto you and ye
[47:50] shall return every man unto his
[47:52] possession
[47:54] and ye shall return every man unto
[47:57] his family and verse if we could go down
[48:01] to verse 13 in the year of this jubilee
[48:04] shall you return every man unto his
[48:08] possession amen may god bless you and
[48:11] bless the ring of the word as you're
[48:12] being seated
[48:14] i just want to say before i maybe get
[48:17] into
[48:17] to ministering here this morning i want
[48:20] to say we just so appreciate your
[48:23] your prayers while we were there last
[48:26] well just this past week here
[48:30] down at the believer's youth camp it
[48:32] started last saturday and it went
[48:35] through thursday evening the the
[48:38] services
[48:39] i didn't know they were going to do this
[48:40] or else i would have let you know
[48:42] i let the young people know when i got
[48:44] down there as soon as i found out that
[48:46] they were going to be streaming the
[48:48] services and so
[48:50] the services are archived there the
[48:52] video and
[48:54] that's archived the the the thursday
[48:57] morning service that
[48:58] we spake there well they were videoing
[49:02] it
[49:03] but lightning struck and so it was it
[49:06] was quite a
[49:07] quite a moment you know when we were
[49:09] ministering i just had make uh made a
[49:11] thought
[49:12] um i made a statement of just where we
[49:15] were in the middle of ministry
[49:16] i said god is a great big god and went
[49:17] boom and the lights went out in the
[49:19] building
[49:20] you say what happened then we just
[49:21] started dancing
[49:23] the young people were already up and
[49:25] they just started dancing and shouting
[49:26] and just
[49:27] moving around you know and and just just
[49:30] as such a liberty and
[49:31] you know it was a tremendous tremendous
[49:34] time i i just can't even begin to even
[49:36] tell you
[49:37] um there's no way of knowing how many
[49:40] deliverances
[49:41] that took place in that service
[49:43] homosexuality
[49:44] just just those demons just just removed
[49:47] just just cast away and
[49:49] lives that you know that that just set
[49:52] free you know from
[49:53] pornography set free from you know so so
[49:56] many other things that you just go right
[49:57] down through the list
[49:58] fear and anxiety and on and on and lives
[50:01] being filled with the holy ghost i
[50:03] um you know and i i just it's just so
[50:05] wonderful to see that and you see
[50:08] you see the young people they you know i
[50:10] had to
[50:11] we had to just cut it off when we're
[50:12] preaching because they kept on pulling
[50:15] they were pulling and pulling and
[50:16] pulling and it was tremendous
[50:18] uh because they were hungry they were
[50:21] hungry and they
[50:22] they probably stood most of it more of
[50:24] the time
[50:25] than they were sitting matter of fact
[50:27] i'm i'm convinced of that
[50:29] and so it just was a tremendous
[50:31] tremendous
[50:32] time there in in the meeting of what god
[50:34] has done
[50:35] and you know that's not just one place
[50:38] where it's not just happening there but
[50:40] it's all throughout the bride body i
[50:42] mean just announce it like this the move
[50:44] is on for the bride
[50:46] amen the revival is on for the bride of
[50:48] jesus christ and
[50:50] i believe it's going home time amen so
[50:53] it was just tremendous to see that and
[50:55] and the things that's taking place and
[50:57] you know
[50:58] um i just so appreciate uh
[51:01] your prayers and just to see what god
[51:04] has done and
[51:05] i ask you just to continue to keep me in
[51:07] prayer because i'm still a little weak
[51:09] right now even in my body and and um
[51:12] but we just want to turn our attention
[51:14] here to
[51:15] to the word here for a few moments
[51:18] and uh you know as we're we're looking
[51:22] at this thought on you have a voice
[51:25] and when we think of this of the jubilee
[51:28] it's set forth in the scripture remember
[51:31] everything that we look at even in the
[51:33] old testament
[51:34] there is much much prophecy that is
[51:36] given in the old testament that
[51:38] we know that is is to be fulfilled
[51:42] within the new testament
[51:44] many many things that spoke of the groom
[51:46] the lord jesus and he fulfilled that
[51:48] part
[51:48] and there's many parts within that that
[51:51] also that speaks of the bride we know
[51:53] there's prophecies that
[51:54] have been spoken in the old testament
[51:56] regarding even that of
[51:58] israel coming back into her position and
[52:01] you know when you you think of it you
[52:03] know in this regard that god
[52:05] he designated this was a type that
[52:09] when the land itself knowing that there
[52:11] would come times where
[52:13] debt would incur and situations would
[52:15] take place to where that people would
[52:18] actually be removed from what
[52:20] rightfully belonged to them but just
[52:22] because they were removed from it
[52:24] did not take it away from belonging to
[52:27] them
[52:28] but but it only it remained in its place
[52:30] so
[52:31] the inheritance did not move from them
[52:34] or even with them but god would grant
[52:37] their
[52:38] his grace that would actually move in a
[52:40] sovereign time
[52:42] that there would be a sounding of a
[52:44] trumpet is actually the shofar the
[52:46] ram's horn and it would actually be
[52:48] blown and it
[52:49] that through the sounding of that of
[52:51] that that declaration
[52:53] it had a meaning now there might have
[52:54] been you know others that were around
[52:56] and they could hear a sound taking place
[52:58] into them
[53:00] they maybe have a question on what's
[53:02] what's taking place or what's going on
[53:04] it might have just seemed like a foolish
[53:05] noise or it might have just seemed like
[53:07] you know well somebody's just blowing a
[53:08] horn or something but
[53:10] but to those who were actually true
[53:14] born israelites sons of
[53:17] god it had a meaning to their life
[53:20] as a matter of fact when they were they
[53:22] were in a place and
[53:24] of debt and trying to work off of debt
[53:26] and labor and it didn't matter if they
[53:28] had been
[53:28] in that in that situation let's say that
[53:31] they had entered into it after two years
[53:33] from
[53:34] from from a jubilee that had just
[53:35] sounded they would be there for 48 years
[53:38] but there might come another one
[53:39] who entered into to bondage or to debt
[53:43] and it was maybe only one year from the
[53:46] 50th year
[53:47] it didn't matter how close it was or how
[53:49] far it was
[53:50] this was a sovereign act of almighty god
[53:53] that when the 50th year come
[53:55] the horn or the trumpet was going to
[53:57] sound and that sound
[53:59] had a meaning within it that could
[54:01] designate to the sons of israel
[54:04] that you can go back to your inheritance
[54:06] you don't have to ask nobody
[54:08] you don't have to ask the master can i
[54:09] go free uh
[54:11] w will will you stop bothering me no the
[54:14] the sounding of that
[54:16] of that horn or that trumpet it held
[54:18] within it a meaning
[54:20] it held a voice it held inspiration and
[54:22] it held authority you see there was an
[54:24] authority that passed
[54:26] over their ears and down into their
[54:28] heart that they knew
[54:29] that the days of slaving this is the
[54:32] last day
[54:33] this is the last moment i'm no longer
[54:35] going to be a servant
[54:36] i do not carry this back with me let me
[54:38] tell you something whatever they were
[54:40] working in that field did not go back to
[54:41] their inheritance
[54:43] there they went back to their
[54:44] inheritance as free
[54:46] sons of god and this is exactly what god
[54:50] would be speaking to you and i he would
[54:52] be speaking in a greater measure
[54:55] that for the sons of god as there came a
[54:58] fall
[54:58] in there in the garden of eden and here
[55:00] we come back under
[55:02] we come under a bondage we come under a
[55:04] servitude of sin and
[55:06] enslaved by by by that birth of a woman
[55:09] of that first nature that no matter how
[55:12] how how
[55:12] how good a person tries to be or how
[55:15] much they try to better themselves
[55:17] they can never get away from the
[55:19] condemnation
[55:20] that's over their life why because it's
[55:22] still
[55:23] under a sexual birth blood
[55:26] and there's only one thing that can
[55:28] actually come and now
[55:30] move for that sexual birth blood and
[55:32] that would be
[55:33] there must come a blood on the scene
[55:36] that is greater
[55:37] than the sexual birth blood there must
[55:40] come a blood that has within it
[55:42] a power that is able to loosen it from
[55:45] its past
[55:46] and actually tied in to what its
[55:48] inheritance
[55:49] really is you see it's a true
[55:52] inheritance in the land and you know
[55:54] many of you as bible readers you know
[55:56] that that inheritance when it was
[55:58] designated
[55:59] to a certain tribe it could never leave
[56:02] that tribe
[56:03] that which belonged to judah it always
[56:05] remained to judah and
[56:06] and so forth and zebulun and whatever
[56:08] more their boundaries and their borders
[56:11] always remained the same they could
[56:14] never ever it was never a changing of it
[56:16] because that was their inheritance and
[56:19] those that were a part of that family
[56:21] let's just say it's judah
[56:22] they their their inheritance lay within
[56:25] the boundaries that were given to judah
[56:28] so if there they were under that
[56:30] standard when it came time for
[56:32] the jubilee to sound it might have been
[56:34] a man out of the tribe of judah
[56:36] that man would not run into the
[56:38] inheritance of reuben because
[56:40] that's not his inheritance but the
[56:42] sounding with letting no
[56:44] return to your inheritance you so you
[56:46] see that the sounding
[56:48] would also be the call to return but if
[56:50] you're going to return to something
[56:52] you've got to know who or what you're
[56:54] returning to
[56:55] and the way back must also be revealed
[56:59] now
[57:00] when we when we see it in this manner it
[57:02] was an act of god i love how brother
[57:04] rahm says that
[57:04] in another place he says it was an act
[57:07] of god's
[57:08] grace you see this was not an act of man
[57:11] at all but the jubilee itself was a
[57:14] sovereign
[57:15] act of almighty god and notice i
[57:18] i want to read this here out of return
[57:20] in jubilee brother graham says now a man
[57:23] and his family could go back to their
[57:25] original inheritance
[57:26] if they could hear the jubilee a trumpet
[57:30] sound
[57:30] and know what it meant to them
[57:34] if they heard the priest sound the
[57:36] trumpet the trumpet is the gospel
[57:39] you see the reason many cannot go back
[57:41] is because the trumpet is given an
[57:43] uncertain sound
[57:45] this is why that a trumpet itself must
[57:47] give
[57:48] a certain sound you say what do you mean
[57:50] by a certain sound
[57:51] i'm talking about a positiveness that
[57:54] comes
[57:54] not just by the letter but comes by god
[57:57] himself getting in his word
[57:59] and he begins to sound out liberty his
[58:02] presence
[58:03] jubilee authority to our lives you see
[58:06] it removes
[58:06] any question so what's it doing it's
[58:09] putting our
[58:10] faith in the word of almighty god you
[58:13] see what it does
[58:14] faith in yourself you'll never rise up
[58:16] faith in your thinking
[58:17] you'll stay there you'll stay there but
[58:19] if your faith gets placed
[58:21] in the word of god oh my and the spirit
[58:24] of god begins to move
[58:26] and to catch us away from our earthbound
[58:28] thinking and
[58:29] all thoughts of defeat and well i cannot
[58:32] do this or
[58:32] can i do that but there must come an
[58:35] inspiration
[58:36] that's greater than anything that man
[58:38] could give
[58:39] there must come an inspiration that
[58:41] would cause
[58:42] our eyes of faith to begin to rise and
[58:45] look beyond
[58:46] circumstances and no matter how bleak
[58:48] they are no matter how great
[58:50] they are there's an inspiration that has
[58:52] life in it
[58:53] authority in it has power in it and
[58:55] brother it
[58:56] ministers to the depths of our soul to
[58:59] where
[58:59] we go from saying i don't know if it
[59:01] could be or
[59:02] maybe it's not for me but the
[59:04] inspiration of god
[59:06] it changes the atmosphere from if it
[59:09] could be or it might be
[59:10] it changes it to a place of it shall be
[59:14] this is my inheritance
[59:18] so this inheritance when they hear it
[59:22] and they know what it means they know
[59:25] that that's their inheritance you see
[59:28] what if a trumpet's sounding
[59:30] and the trumpet says well all you got to
[59:32] do is believe that jesus
[59:33] is the christ and that's it you're born
[59:35] again that's an uncertain sound
[59:39] because it's not dealing with what is
[59:42] the real
[59:42] problem and the real cause the real
[59:45] problem
[59:46] is that first birth it's not dealing
[59:49] with that sin
[59:50] nature and so when we think about it an
[59:53] inheritance like that
[59:54] or all you got to do is shake the
[59:56] preacher's hand or all you got to do is
[59:58] you know believe brother branham's a
[59:59] prophet let me bring it down in our
[1:00:01] rings
[1:00:01] all you got to do is you don't believe
[1:00:02] the doctrines of the message but it
[1:00:04] never deals
[1:00:05] with sin nature you can believe all the
[1:00:08] doctrines of the word
[1:00:09] and you can look at them and say well
[1:00:11] that's true and that's a man
[1:00:13] but there's got to come something than
[1:00:15] just an agreement with the doctrines
[1:00:17] that's part of it we must be able to say
[1:00:19] amen but there must come a life
[1:00:22] of that word that deals with that first
[1:00:24] baby that first birth
[1:00:25] because that's the problem come on now
[1:00:29] many times that ain't the doctrines of
[1:00:31] it it ain't doctrines what you
[1:00:33] what your what we deal with is that of a
[1:00:36] first
[1:00:36] nature where that first man is still
[1:00:39] alive
[1:00:39] [Music]
[1:00:41] come on now but there's got to be one
[1:00:42] that's able to bring death
[1:00:44] to that first man how does he bring
[1:00:46] death by calling us to life
[1:00:49] and recognize that there's one that's
[1:00:51] here greater
[1:00:52] and that's not who you really are you
[1:00:55] are a son
[1:00:56] and daughter of god
[1:00:59] oh my when they hear it they know what
[1:01:02] it means i mean
[1:01:03] look if somebody in the word could tell
[1:01:05] you
[1:01:06] well god don't require that no more then
[1:01:08] why don't we throw the whole bible
[1:01:10] away then i'm gonna just put it straight
[1:01:12] why don't we throw it all away then
[1:01:14] if we can't have confidence that god
[1:01:16] keeps his word
[1:01:17] he said i'm god and i changed enough he
[1:01:19] said i won't alter what went out of my
[1:01:21] mouth
[1:01:22] are you with me god ain't changing
[1:01:24] nothing as a matter of fact
[1:01:25] the final scriptures in the book in
[1:01:27] revelations 22
[1:01:28] said whosoever adds to it or takes away
[1:01:31] his
[1:01:32] part will be taken out of the book of
[1:01:34] life let me tell you something
[1:01:35] on the day of judgment there's going to
[1:01:37] be many people
[1:01:38] that are disappointed the drunkard won't
[1:01:40] be disappointed
[1:01:41] he knows where he's going the prostitute
[1:01:44] ain't going to be disappointed
[1:01:45] she knows where she's going but a many a
[1:01:48] church member
[1:01:49] is going to be shocked they're going to
[1:01:51] be disappointed
[1:01:52] when they wake up in hell and say
[1:01:54] somebody
[1:01:55] told me that i was all right but brother
[1:01:58] we're not under the sounding
[1:02:00] of an uncertain sound we are under the
[1:02:03] sounding
[1:02:03] of the word of god what does that do it
[1:02:06] brings a
[1:02:07] faith and a courage and a faith in that
[1:02:09] word
[1:02:10] that you and i can stand as sons and
[1:02:12] daughters of god
[1:02:14] when they hear it and they know what it
[1:02:17] means
[1:02:19] they heard it on the day of pentecost is
[1:02:20] that right
[1:02:22] now there were many that heard it on the
[1:02:23] day of pentecost and said these guys are
[1:02:25] drunk
[1:02:28] right what is this
[1:02:32] but then you had some that heard it
[1:02:35] and there was conviction that set in
[1:02:38] i'll tell you that's a blessed thing in
[1:02:39] this hour
[1:02:41] we're living in an hour where where
[1:02:43] where people move without conviction
[1:02:46] come on now but it takes the holy ghost
[1:02:48] to bring
[1:02:49] conviction to a life let me tell you
[1:02:51] something if the preaching of the gospel
[1:02:53] and the holy spirit doesn't bring
[1:02:55] conviction to your life you're doomed
[1:02:58] it takes the holy ghost to bring
[1:03:00] conviction to your life
[1:03:01] you say brother samuel how did you pray
[1:03:03] well i'll tell you what if somebody's
[1:03:04] going the wrong way i pray god turned
[1:03:06] their world upside down
[1:03:08] god you know how to take them from the
[1:03:09] top and put them on the bottom you know
[1:03:11] how to turn their life around
[1:03:12] brother samuel you'd actually pray that
[1:03:14] done it many times god knows
[1:03:16] how to get your attention when maybe you
[1:03:18] think you're too high
[1:03:19] you're too good or maybe it might be a
[1:03:21] situation that is entirely different
[1:03:23] but god knows how to get your attention
[1:03:26] brother what is it about
[1:03:27] it's about our soul
[1:03:30] god take peace from their life don't let
[1:03:32] them sleep
[1:03:34] brother samuel you don't love me oh no i
[1:03:36] love you i want to see your soul
[1:03:38] i want to see your soul make it you can
[1:03:40] have everything in this life
[1:03:41] and you'll still end up in hell but if
[1:03:43] you ever meet the lord jesus christ
[1:03:46] in the redeeming grace and the blood
[1:03:48] that's been shed for you
[1:03:49] brother you're the richest man or woman
[1:03:51] that's upon
[1:03:52] this face of the earth
[1:03:56] when they hear it they know what it
[1:03:58] means so there was a sounding that went
[1:04:00] out
[1:04:01] what must we do to be saved
[1:04:04] so when the sound went forth it had a
[1:04:07] meaning to them they didn't call it
[1:04:08] you know these are drunk but it had a
[1:04:10] meaning to their life
[1:04:12] and so how did they respond peter then
[1:04:14] how the trumpet is being sounded notice
[1:04:17] the certainty in the word is sounding
[1:04:19] out in that hour
[1:04:20] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:04:23] the lord jesus christ
[1:04:24] repentance is not a haphazard event
[1:04:27] repentance isn't well you know god
[1:04:29] i was born in this sorry family and i
[1:04:31] was like that ain't repentance that's
[1:04:32] worldly sorrow
[1:04:33] you want somebody to feel sorry for you
[1:04:35] but when repentance is where
[1:04:37] you recognize you're wrong and you abort
[1:04:41] the wrong that's in your life no excuses
[1:04:44] for it
[1:04:45] no no excuses you accept the
[1:04:48] responsibility
[1:04:49] that god i'm sorry that i have left
[1:04:51] lived under the influence
[1:04:53] of the enemy in my life and lord i
[1:04:55] recognize
[1:04:56] that freedom has come what are you doing
[1:04:58] instead of heading this way
[1:05:00] you're now heading this way what are you
[1:05:02] heading towards
[1:05:03] you're headed back to your inheritance
[1:05:08] is that right and be baptized in the
[1:05:12] name of the lord jesus christ because
[1:05:14] who's whose name are you under
[1:05:16] as judah went to judah zebulon went to
[1:05:18] zebulun
[1:05:19] reuben went to reuben then the real
[1:05:22] children of god
[1:05:22] come under the name of the lord jesus
[1:05:24] christ to recognize
[1:05:26] that our borders our boundaries our
[1:05:28] inheritance
[1:05:29] is in jesus christ and he is the word
[1:05:33] and we hear the call of the word that's
[1:05:35] why the scripture said
[1:05:37] that he gives the holy ghost that he
[1:05:39] sounds forth
[1:05:40] his name when they hear it they know
[1:05:44] what it means and you
[1:05:45] shall receive the gift
[1:05:48] of the holy ghost somebody say shall
[1:05:52] we shall is not a maybe
[1:05:55] shall does not mean shall mean certainty
[1:06:02] over and over we could go through the
[1:06:03] scriptures on the shelves
[1:06:05] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:06:07] thirst after righteousness for they
[1:06:09] shall be filled not a question
[1:06:12] it's a certainty and they know that
[1:06:15] that's their
[1:06:16] inheritance no matter where where they
[1:06:18] lost how far they went back
[1:06:21] whatever they had to do they had the
[1:06:23] privilege to come
[1:06:24] and receive again their inheritance
[1:06:27] so it didn't matter what they were under
[1:06:30] it didn't matter
[1:06:31] what what what type of a condition that
[1:06:34] they were in
[1:06:35] the condition itself is not who
[1:06:38] they were are you with me they might
[1:06:41] have been under this
[1:06:43] sexual demon or under this and this
[1:06:45] thing was ruling on their life
[1:06:46] but it had nothing to do with who they
[1:06:48] really are
[1:06:49] you see the word itself identifies you
[1:06:52] for who you really
[1:06:53] are what's that doing that gives you a
[1:06:55] strength and a courage to recognize
[1:06:57] i don't have to remain under this
[1:07:00] bondage
[1:07:01] any longer i'm not a servant i'm a son
[1:07:04] of the living god i don't have to stand
[1:07:07] here
[1:07:07] and be moved about as a slave i'm a son
[1:07:11] of the living god what does that the
[1:07:15] sounding of the word
[1:07:18] is that right it didn't matter what they
[1:07:20] had lost or how
[1:07:21] how far they'd went the devil will
[1:07:23] always try to whisper in your ear
[1:07:25] you've went too far let me tell you
[1:07:27] something if you went too far the holy
[1:07:29] ghost wouldn't be dealing with your life
[1:07:32] if the holy ghost ain't dealing with
[1:07:33] your life but you're in a heap of
[1:07:35] trouble right now
[1:07:36] but the holy spirit when it's dealing
[1:07:38] with your life
[1:07:39] and how as it's moving in that life
[1:07:41] what's it doing
[1:07:42] it brings to a place that maybe a person
[1:07:45] has been in and out and
[1:07:46] up and down and never really come in to
[1:07:48] their inheritance they've heard about it
[1:07:50] quoted it they've talked about it
[1:07:52] they've even listened to it and
[1:07:54] even at times it thrilled them but they
[1:07:56] never came into that inheritance
[1:07:58] and then the enemy you know something
[1:07:59] will sidetrack them and then here the
[1:08:01] enemy will come again
[1:08:02] and say well you know what you've been
[1:08:04] in and out and up and down and
[1:08:05] everything else
[1:08:06] but there is something that is sounding
[1:08:09] in that life that there is nothing
[1:08:11] in this world that holds any interest
[1:08:13] for him as a matter of fact
[1:08:14] it wouldn't matter if everything the
[1:08:16] devil can heap on you he can never
[1:08:18] keep you from your father
[1:08:22] are you with me the spirit of god begins
[1:08:25] to sound right out
[1:08:26] it does not matter i've done this i've
[1:08:28] done that i've done this
[1:08:29] but if the spirit of god is still
[1:08:32] dealing with your heart
[1:08:33] it shows that there is grace for
[1:08:36] you
[1:08:40] what do i do lay everything aside and
[1:08:43] run to him
[1:08:44] run into the inheritance
[1:08:48] because you ever get in that inheritance
[1:08:49] brother there's no going back amen
[1:08:52] are you hearing me there's no going back
[1:08:54] there's nothing to go back to
[1:08:56] you've been united with god's choosing
[1:09:00] for your life oh
[1:09:03] my my my now notice how this drama
[1:09:08] is like a drama that's being unfolded
[1:09:10] you know
[1:09:12] as you look through the scriptures we
[1:09:14] read of that last
[1:09:15] uh the last last week when we were
[1:09:17] together in ephesians 1.
[1:09:20] and i'm not going to read that here this
[1:09:21] morning but i want to tie a few of those
[1:09:23] places in
[1:09:25] we have been blessed with all spiritual
[1:09:27] blessings
[1:09:28] in christ amen these are not sensations
[1:09:33] these are blessings
[1:09:35] he had chosen us in him before the
[1:09:38] foundation of the world
[1:09:40] in hebrew in ephesians 1 5 having
[1:09:43] predestinated us
[1:09:44] unto the adoption or the placement the
[1:09:47] positioning
[1:09:48] of children by jesus christ to
[1:09:51] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:09:53] of his will so this
[1:09:54] is all in in the very counsel and the
[1:09:58] mind of almighty god as a matter of fact
[1:09:59] this is a drama
[1:10:01] that is being unfolded god could never
[1:10:04] make man to sin but god put a man
[1:10:08] on freemore agency and remember how
[1:10:11] that the bible describes how that the
[1:10:13] woman she was deceived
[1:10:15] but adam was in the transgression is
[1:10:18] that right adam stepped out
[1:10:20] you know as he was here with his wife in
[1:10:22] united there with his wife he steps out
[1:10:24] and he takes he takes her her sin
[1:10:28] upon himself because remember when god
[1:10:30] when god spoke
[1:10:31] uh to that of the woman and the woman
[1:10:34] herself you know and
[1:10:35] all these things why hast thou done this
[1:10:37] and and who did this remember
[1:10:39] god laid the responsibility or he's
[1:10:41] bringing it to a place
[1:10:42] of adam and he's looking because adam
[1:10:45] has to give a responsibility because she
[1:10:47] is identified in him that's why god
[1:10:50] could not touch her
[1:10:54] are you with me this is why that even
[1:10:56] even when we have been we are united
[1:10:58] with the lord jesus christ and let me
[1:11:00] say this before you ever even come to
[1:11:02] the realization
[1:11:03] that i'm a son and daughter of god i
[1:11:05] mean realization by
[1:11:07] real birth and positioning you realize
[1:11:09] that there's nothing before that
[1:11:11] could ever touch you or take you until
[1:11:14] god dealt with your life
[1:11:15] there is nothing i don't care how many
[1:11:17] automobile accidents
[1:11:18] i don't care how many things that came
[1:11:20] your way you might had to duck your head
[1:11:22] and it went flying on by
[1:11:23] there is nothing that could take you why
[1:11:26] because just like moses told pharaoh
[1:11:28] we are not leaving out of here with even
[1:11:31] a hoof behind
[1:11:32] you see when god he let us know he's got
[1:11:35] our names
[1:11:36] engraved in the palm of his hands you
[1:11:38] say brother samuel what are you talking
[1:11:40] about i'm telling you that we are not in
[1:11:42] a haphazard event
[1:11:44] we are in a drama that's being unfolded
[1:11:47] the word this is not something that's
[1:11:50] wishy-washy and
[1:11:51] up today and down tomorrow that's not
[1:11:53] the word of our god
[1:11:54] the word of our god is a solid place
[1:11:57] that you and i can stand on
[1:11:59] where the lord jesus said heaven and
[1:12:00] earth shall pass away
[1:12:02] but my word shall never fail because why
[1:12:05] it's a solid place what we see happening
[1:12:08] right now
[1:12:09] the way that god is dealing with your
[1:12:11] life right now the way that your life
[1:12:13] is expressing him in this hour do you
[1:12:16] realize
[1:12:17] you were part of the sons of god that
[1:12:19] shouted for joy
[1:12:20] that he drew job's attention to you
[1:12:23] realize you were part of those
[1:12:25] who never went along with satan's
[1:12:27] websites i mean his rebellion
[1:12:29] there in heaven you realize you were
[1:12:30] part of those who stood in that hour
[1:12:33] you say how can that be because you're
[1:12:35] standing right now
[1:12:37] this word you didn't remember it but
[1:12:39] this word
[1:12:40] has stirred up a gene on the inside that
[1:12:43] lets you know
[1:12:44] you were always a part of god
[1:12:49] that's why the devil hates
[1:12:50] predestination
[1:12:53] because predestination clearly declares
[1:12:56] this has been your lot before there was
[1:12:59] modern molecule you said what are you
[1:13:01] saying i'm not asking for something that
[1:13:03] don't belong
[1:13:04] to me i'm i'm claiming
[1:13:07] and taking what rightfully belongs to me
[1:13:11] this always belonged to me the life that
[1:13:13] i live now
[1:13:14] is the life that always belonged to me
[1:13:19] it was my inheritance to live and to
[1:13:22] manifest
[1:13:23] god our father as a son of god it was
[1:13:26] your inheritance
[1:13:27] as a daughter of god to manifest the
[1:13:29] living god
[1:13:33] you see this inheritance by
[1:13:35] predestination
[1:13:37] that we recognize in our lives
[1:13:41] that as brother brown would lay this out
[1:13:44] and
[1:13:44] let me just refer to it he said jesus
[1:13:49] he never left me
[1:13:53] an inheritance my inheritance
[1:13:56] was already given to me
[1:14:00] you say well what was the problem then i
[1:14:03] had no way
[1:14:04] to be able to tap back into this i had
[1:14:07] no way to get back there you see
[1:14:09] they were the israel where it was
[1:14:12] enslaved and there was
[1:14:13] absolutely no way for them to get back
[1:14:16] into their inheritance
[1:14:17] what had to happen there had to come a
[1:14:19] sovereign act
[1:14:21] of god to where that trumpet would be
[1:14:24] blown
[1:14:25] in that 50th year and what would it do
[1:14:27] it would give them the authority to lay
[1:14:29] everything down and return back you see
[1:14:32] that
[1:14:33] is what when god became flesh it
[1:14:35] couldn't be nobody else than god
[1:14:37] god himself became flesh in order to do
[1:14:40] what that the price
[1:14:42] itself could be paid the sin debt
[1:14:45] could be settled that you and i could go
[1:14:48] back to our inheritance
[1:14:52] you see he paid for it and then he
[1:14:55] brought
[1:14:56] you your inheritance because why it's
[1:14:59] the spirit of god
[1:15:01] that the holy spirit are you with me now
[1:15:04] the holy spirit is
[1:15:05] your portion it is that of life you see
[1:15:08] this is why the holy ghost
[1:15:10] when you could look at a person and they
[1:15:12] could say i've received my inheritance
[1:15:14] boy i'm under the anointing of the holy
[1:15:16] ghost and yet you look at their life
[1:15:18] they're still smoking and
[1:15:19] looking at things they ought not look at
[1:15:20] and running around out here and doing
[1:15:22] this and doing that
[1:15:23] you're not seeing a life that's living
[1:15:25] by the inheritance
[1:15:27] sure the holy spirit can come upon them
[1:15:30] that's exactly right
[1:15:31] but brother remember the holy spirit is
[1:15:33] a quickening spirit
[1:15:34] what does he come to do he comes to
[1:15:36] quicken that seed
[1:15:38] that word on the inside and that's where
[1:15:41] he abides
[1:15:42] the holy spirit does not abide on your
[1:15:44] flesh he does not abide on your spirit
[1:15:46] but he takes his abode there in that sea
[1:15:49] in that place that he has reserved for
[1:15:52] himself you see
[1:15:53] god has provided in this hour a place
[1:15:56] that he might reveal
[1:15:57] and express himself why he is jehovah
[1:16:00] jireh
[1:16:01] in your life he manifests himself he is
[1:16:04] jehovah jireh
[1:16:05] when the rest of the world is going the
[1:16:07] way that they're going
[1:16:08] yet god has reserved unto himself a
[1:16:11] remnant
[1:16:12] that would believe the word and would be
[1:16:14] filled with his spirit
[1:16:19] he paid the price and then brought us
[1:16:22] back to our inheritance
[1:16:24] i mean there's not one of you would look
[1:16:26] at your inheritance and say
[1:16:28] well you know i believe this inheritance
[1:16:32] but
[1:16:33] if there's still claims on it it's not
[1:16:35] fully under the inheritance
[1:16:37] the inheritance is where there is no
[1:16:40] bringing back
[1:16:41] of of the holes of the rakes or whatever
[1:16:43] tool it was or whatever instrument or
[1:16:45] whatever bondage
[1:16:46] it does not come back to the inheritance
[1:16:48] it's still there
[1:16:50] let me just say this to you the word
[1:16:52] itself is a wonderful thing
[1:16:53] and to enjoy but remember what the word
[1:16:55] is coming to do the word is giving you
[1:16:57] the authority
[1:16:58] to lay down that habit it's giving you
[1:17:00] the authority to cast down that spirit
[1:17:03] it's giving you the authority to rise up
[1:17:06] but you've been bound with it so long
[1:17:08] until it's become something that's just
[1:17:10] a part of you
[1:17:11] i say denounce that devil in the name of
[1:17:13] the lord jesus christ
[1:17:15] and lay it down and return back to your
[1:17:17] inheritance
[1:17:18] listen you don't know how many times
[1:17:20] i've been prayed for i'm asking you
[1:17:22] right now
[1:17:22] not to recite how many times you've been
[1:17:24] prayed for i'm asking you do you believe
[1:17:27] what the word has done for you
[1:17:35] hallelujah i'm talking about a place of
[1:17:37] victory amen are you hearing me i'm
[1:17:39] talking about a place of victory i'm
[1:17:41] talking about a place where you
[1:17:42] can really express yourself as a son and
[1:17:45] daughter of god
[1:17:49] you see like joshua joshua himself
[1:17:52] remember he had to
[1:17:54] he divided what belonged to israel
[1:17:58] joshua was not the one that decided
[1:18:00] judah goes over here and
[1:18:02] reuben goes over here and no that was
[1:18:04] already
[1:18:05] decided before the foundation of the
[1:18:08] world
[1:18:09] but their birth held within it a mystery
[1:18:12] when that name was called out it held
[1:18:14] within it the placement in that land oh
[1:18:16] my
[1:18:17] so if the same inspiration that was in
[1:18:20] the mind of god
[1:18:21] and that same inspiration would hit the
[1:18:23] mothers in the birth
[1:18:24] and they would call out that name and it
[1:18:26] would lay down a characteristic
[1:18:28] in the land of israel for that name
[1:18:30] zebulon judah whatever more
[1:18:32] then it would take the same inspiration
[1:18:34] to come to joshua
[1:18:36] and what was joshua doing when he was
[1:18:38] dividing the land it was the
[1:18:39] inspiration of almighty god that was
[1:18:42] dropping down
[1:18:43] on a vessel of humanity that had
[1:18:46] surrendered its thoughts to almighty god
[1:18:48] and joshua would stand there and he
[1:18:50] would minister the inheritance
[1:18:52] are you with me now you see that's what
[1:18:54] god has done
[1:18:55] in the evening time brother this message
[1:18:58] is not
[1:18:58] the inspiration of a seminary it's not
[1:19:01] the inspiration
[1:19:03] of schools of man but this is the
[1:19:05] inspiration
[1:19:06] of almighty god that has come down to
[1:19:09] divide to you and i
[1:19:11] our inheritance our portion our place
[1:19:14] our part in the body of jesus christ
[1:19:17] which is the word of the living god
[1:19:20] to anybody else it sounds like
[1:19:21] foolishness why no inheritance
[1:19:26] oh to all those nations that were around
[1:19:31] because some of them in there were not
[1:19:32] israel like born
[1:19:34] they were bondmen the bondwoman never
[1:19:37] went free in the jubilee
[1:19:39] never only those who were born
[1:19:43] sons what are you saying
[1:19:47] that we were always sons and daughters
[1:19:48] of god amen
[1:19:51] those who were bought in from other
[1:19:53] nations they could never go free
[1:19:54] under the jubilee they still had to
[1:19:56] remain and they served and they served
[1:19:58] and they served they can never go free
[1:20:00] but you see that's why this word holds
[1:20:02] meaning to you
[1:20:04] it's come to declare liberty to you now
[1:20:06] to some people
[1:20:07] just turn it down just a little bit then
[1:20:09] right here i'll give you permission to
[1:20:11] do that
[1:20:15] you see the rest of them of a bondman
[1:20:17] they'd have to continue
[1:20:18] they they would continue on to serve
[1:20:20] because it did not
[1:20:22] minister an authority to them to be able
[1:20:24] to rise up
[1:20:25] and to walk on in to an inheritance
[1:20:28] because they didn't have any inheritance
[1:20:30] among the land you see let's just put it
[1:20:32] let's just put the devil on notice right
[1:20:33] now
[1:20:34] when the enemy wants to get on your
[1:20:35] shoulder and try to point out all your
[1:20:37] faults
[1:20:38] all your mistakes and he wants to try to
[1:20:40] tell you you must not have any
[1:20:41] inheritance in this land
[1:20:42] then you tell me why he's wasting his
[1:20:44] time running his mouth
[1:20:46] he's never told the truth he's a liar
[1:20:49] are you with me he's a liar and a
[1:20:51] murderer what's he trying to do
[1:20:53] he's trying to destroy your confidence
[1:20:56] in the word
[1:20:57] he's not going to tell you that this
[1:20:58] message ain't the truth he's not going
[1:21:00] to tell you well the holy ghost ain't
[1:21:02] real
[1:21:02] notice how he switches now and he begins
[1:21:05] to tell you
[1:21:06] this isn't for you what should i do call
[1:21:08] him a liar
[1:21:10] and denounce it don't talk with a liar
[1:21:12] if they've been alive they're still a
[1:21:14] liar
[1:21:15] there'll always be a liar what should i
[1:21:17] do rise up
[1:21:18] in the truth of god's word because
[1:21:20] that's what holds the real identity of
[1:21:22] who you really are
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:26] listen you don't know how many times i
[1:21:28] failed but let me take your attention
[1:21:30] away from your failures
[1:21:31] and look at the one who has already
[1:21:34] standing victorious
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:40] hallelujah
[1:21:44] hallelujah notice in leviticus 25
[1:21:48] 23 the land shall not be sold forever
[1:21:52] for the land is mine so once again it
[1:21:55] belonged to god
[1:21:57] the land belongs to god their
[1:21:59] inheritance was what
[1:22:01] was given to them by god
[1:22:04] for you are strangers and sojourners
[1:22:07] with me
[1:22:08] and in all the land of your possession
[1:22:10] you shall grant
[1:22:12] a redemption for the land
[1:22:15] now notice this here
[1:22:19] oh my as we could we could look at that
[1:22:22] you know
[1:22:22] how has it belonged to that tribe and
[1:22:25] and that inheritance belonged to them
[1:22:27] now remember we we came into this place
[1:22:29] even last week
[1:22:31] of how that this this being a type
[1:22:34] israel could fall
[1:22:35] back into uh you know a bondage the
[1:22:38] the sons of israel could fall right back
[1:22:40] into that
[1:22:41] into a bondage again after that jubilee
[1:22:44] had come why because it was only a type
[1:22:47] you see this is why that the blood of
[1:22:49] bulls and goats they could come and
[1:22:51] offer
[1:22:52] the blood of bulls and goats it was a
[1:22:53] covering so they could come
[1:22:56] and have fellowship with god but it only
[1:22:59] it only covered it never atoned
[1:23:01] for sin it never dealt with the real
[1:23:04] root of the problem
[1:23:06] now man if a man came back and committed
[1:23:08] the same wrong in one year's time
[1:23:10] that man died because
[1:23:13] why because you see that was speaking of
[1:23:17] in a greater measure of the strength of
[1:23:19] the one
[1:23:20] sufficient sacrifice that when that
[1:23:23] sacrifice
[1:23:24] not only was made but accepted
[1:23:27] and then the life that lived in that
[1:23:29] sacrifice would come back upon the
[1:23:31] worshipper
[1:23:32] this is where paul said for for by one
[1:23:35] offering
[1:23:36] he has perfected forever them
[1:23:39] that are sanctified why it becomes the
[1:23:43] very
[1:23:44] strength in your life because the nature
[1:23:47] or the desire
[1:23:48] of sin has passed from you
[1:23:52] is that right so now there there was a
[1:23:55] true land
[1:23:56] that was being spoken of a true land now
[1:23:59] let's read here in romans 5 14
[1:24:01] the bible says nevertheless death
[1:24:03] reigned from adam to moses
[1:24:05] even over them that had not sinned after
[1:24:06] the similitude of adam's transgression
[1:24:09] who is the figure of him that was to
[1:24:10] come so even those
[1:24:12] who didn't go according to adam's
[1:24:14] transgression but they were still
[1:24:16] under the reign of death
[1:24:20] all those things reigned because of that
[1:24:23] birth that came through him by
[1:24:25] disbelieving
[1:24:26] the word but not as the offense so
[1:24:29] also is the free gift the free gift
[1:24:34] for it if through the offense of one
[1:24:38] many been dead much more the grace of
[1:24:40] god
[1:24:41] and the gift by grace which is by one
[1:24:43] man jesus christ
[1:24:45] hath abounded unto many and not as it
[1:24:48] was by one that sinned so is
[1:24:51] the gift for if the judgment was by one
[1:24:54] to condemnation
[1:24:56] but the free gift is of many offenses
[1:25:00] unto justification
[1:25:03] oh my for if by one man's offense
[1:25:06] death reigned by one how much more
[1:25:10] they which receive abundance of grace
[1:25:13] of the gift of righteousness shall reign
[1:25:16] in life
[1:25:17] by one jesus christ or you see what
[1:25:20] happened here
[1:25:20] it's the changing of that ring where a
[1:25:23] life was under
[1:25:24] the reign of death and all the things
[1:25:26] that came with it
[1:25:27] fear and all the all the evil that came
[1:25:30] with it all the sin all the attributes
[1:25:32] it was
[1:25:33] death that was reigning there but now
[1:25:35] through and by the lord jesus christ
[1:25:37] has one represented us in in death or
[1:25:41] in that uncondemnation now comes forth
[1:25:44] one
[1:25:44] if the very righteousness of god that
[1:25:47] you and i might
[1:25:48] reign in life by jesus christ it's
[1:25:52] changed it in other words we are no
[1:25:54] longer
[1:25:55] the tail but we have become the head
[1:25:58] are you with me in other words we have
[1:26:00] no we are no longer on the ones that are
[1:26:02] enslaved
[1:26:03] but now we are the ones that's ruling
[1:26:07] simply put and faith is our victory
[1:26:09] brother graham said the sin
[1:26:11] that once ruled you
[1:26:14] you now rule it
[1:26:19] you are a master over it
[1:26:22] why what has raised you above that he
[1:26:25] won your own efforts that raised you
[1:26:27] above it
[1:26:27] well i quit this and i quit that then
[1:26:29] it's still not right
[1:26:30] it takes something greater then you're
[1:26:32] quitting you're struggling
[1:26:34] you're trying it takes the very life of
[1:26:37] the lord jesus christ
[1:26:38] that will raise you into a place of
[1:26:41] mastering that
[1:26:42] and ruling over it
[1:26:46] this is not a reforming word this is a
[1:26:48] word that holds power
[1:26:50] within it to bring real deliverance in
[1:26:53] our life
[1:26:57] hallelujah you see this is why it's
[1:27:00] important
[1:27:00] that when god didn't win your life
[1:27:04] that the things have been removed out of
[1:27:05] your life hindrances you say
[1:27:07] well i i used to drink i don't drink no
[1:27:09] more that's good but don't stop there
[1:27:13] why because the bible said when the
[1:27:15] unclean spirit has gone out not when
[1:27:16] it's cast out when it goes out it just
[1:27:19] leaves
[1:27:20] it gets under the presence and the
[1:27:22] preaching of the word and here you begin
[1:27:24] to agree with that word what's happening
[1:27:26] devils are being removed but remember
[1:27:29] you need to get that which was once
[1:27:31] filled now empty it needs to now be
[1:27:34] filled with the presence of almighty god
[1:27:37] i'm talking about an abiding in your
[1:27:39] life to where it's no longer
[1:27:41] the same old man but now there's a new
[1:27:44] creation
[1:27:45] by the spirit of the living god
[1:27:48] notice therefore as by the offense of
[1:27:50] one judgment
[1:27:51] came upon all men to condemnation even
[1:27:54] so by the righteousness of one the free
[1:27:56] gift
[1:27:56] came upon all men unto justification of
[1:28:00] life i love that
[1:28:02] we weren't even looking for him but he
[1:28:05] came looking for us
[1:28:07] just as death i mean you didn't ask for
[1:28:09] fear to set it in your life you say hey
[1:28:11] hey i want anxiety hey
[1:28:12] hey can i have that this isn't a
[1:28:14] mcdonald's menu
[1:28:19] it's hard to believe there's things that
[1:28:21] could be worse than cows not standing up
[1:28:22] but
[1:28:23] this right here when you you and i you
[1:28:24] know what brother ram called it and how
[1:28:26] can i overcome
[1:28:26] where we got the human grab bag of life
[1:28:31] we got things thrown in our satchel that
[1:28:32] we didn't ask for there's a lot of
[1:28:34] things that you could try to say oh my
[1:28:35] i'm not going to be like daddy here and
[1:28:37] i'm not going to be like mama there and
[1:28:38] i'm not going to be like grandma there
[1:28:39] or grandpa there let me tell you
[1:28:41] something that's part of the tree that
[1:28:42] you were born in
[1:28:45] but if you can only recognize there's a
[1:28:46] greater tree that's here than the woman
[1:28:48] tree
[1:28:49] it's called the tree of life brother and
[1:28:51] when the tree of life comes
[1:28:53] it gives you a strength over every
[1:28:55] earthly strain that's there why
[1:28:57] there's a greater power and authority i
[1:29:00] i know there might be things back in
[1:29:01] your past of well my daddy did this or
[1:29:03] my mama did this or
[1:29:04] i was abused here or mistreated there
[1:29:07] but let me
[1:29:08] have your eyes and let's look away to
[1:29:10] the lord jesus christ
[1:29:11] let's look to one that not only brings
[1:29:14] forgiveness
[1:29:15] but let's look to the one who brings a
[1:29:17] deliverance who can wipe out all the
[1:29:19] bitterness
[1:29:20] all the lack of forgiveness all the
[1:29:22] grudges that you hold in your life
[1:29:24] let's look at the one who can repair
[1:29:26] your spirit
[1:29:27] that the enemy wanted to mark and take
[1:29:29] down and say
[1:29:30] i'll get their life so twisted up
[1:29:32] they'll never be able to look
[1:29:34] anywhere else but he underestimates the
[1:29:37] power
[1:29:41] of the trumpet sounding out that your
[1:29:44] inheritance and the jubilee is on i
[1:29:47] don't care what the devil
[1:29:49] has done or how far away it is but when
[1:29:51] that
[1:29:52] son of god or daughter of god they hear
[1:29:55] the trumpet
[1:29:55] they can rise up and say i'm not going
[1:29:58] to stay here
[1:29:59] no longer
[1:30:01] [Applause]
[1:30:03] oh the devil said you can't go no long
[1:30:05] i've had you this way for many years
[1:30:07] i heard the trumpet
[1:30:11] i'm not going to argue with you you
[1:30:12] heard it too see you
[1:30:17] come on friends why are we doing holding
[1:30:18] conversations with the devil
[1:30:21] he don't hold the mystery of your life
[1:30:24] he tried to twist your life up
[1:30:26] he tried to put marks on your life young
[1:30:28] people you hearing me
[1:30:29] you're trying to get your life so
[1:30:30] tangled up in things on the internet
[1:30:32] and everything else he'll try to get you
[1:30:34] so twisted up and try to mark your life
[1:30:37] what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:30:39] hinder you and trying to stop
[1:30:41] the purpose that god called you to walk
[1:30:44] in you say i'm just a young person
[1:30:46] joshua had young men boaz had young men
[1:30:49] in the field
[1:30:50] god is not looking at an age as though
[1:30:52] you've got to be a certain age
[1:30:54] to rise to this place what do i have to
[1:30:56] do you might be a newborn christian
[1:30:59] in god but if you'll surrender your
[1:31:00] heart god sometimes will take your life
[1:31:03] past people that's been sitting in the
[1:31:04] church for years
[1:31:13] let me try to come down because my
[1:31:14] strength is waning
[1:31:19] as by one man's disobedience many were
[1:31:22] made sinners
[1:31:24] so by the obedience of one shall many be
[1:31:27] made righteous
[1:31:29] we've got different representation
[1:31:33] hallelujah let me keep on reading here
[1:31:35] moreover the law entered
[1:31:37] that the offense might abound but where
[1:31:39] sin abounded
[1:31:40] grace did much more abound oh
[1:31:44] it can look so black and dark but grace
[1:31:47] abounds greater oh you don't know the
[1:31:50] situation
[1:31:51] grace abounds greater are you with me
[1:31:55] oh brother samuel you don't know how how
[1:31:57] black it is or how dark and
[1:31:58] there might have been things that i said
[1:32:00] that brother samuel i'm so ashamed
[1:32:02] that i said those things what should i
[1:32:04] do let grace abound
[1:32:08] let grace abound because it's abounding
[1:32:10] if you don't accept it
[1:32:12] somebody else will you might as well
[1:32:14] accept
[1:32:15] god's grace for your life
[1:32:21] what i have to do to make my life better
[1:32:23] nothing because you can't
[1:32:28] oh glory be to god nothing because you
[1:32:30] can't well instead of drinking five
[1:32:32] drinks i'll just drink one you're still
[1:32:33] a sinner
[1:32:34] well i ain't gonna drink any if you have
[1:32:36] the desire you're still a sinner
[1:32:38] preach brother samuel you see because if
[1:32:41] those are
[1:32:42] attributes of one thing unbelief
[1:32:45] it's unbelief in the word of god
[1:32:48] i'll never forget a man you've heard me
[1:32:49] tell this story before i was there
[1:32:51] panera years ago
[1:32:52] early one morning i was just in there
[1:32:54] studying him a bible out and you know
[1:32:55] drinking some coffee and things like
[1:32:57] that
[1:32:57] and i was real early when they had
[1:32:59] opened and i went up there to the
[1:33:01] the coffee bar or whatever they call it
[1:33:03] and i went up there and i don't like
[1:33:04] that old hazelnut stuff
[1:33:06] but they went up there and you know how
[1:33:07] it is you ask people uh this fresh
[1:33:09] coffee yeah i made it a day ago you
[1:33:11] ain't a coffee drinker
[1:33:13] i went up there and that person they
[1:33:14] looked at me and they said oh my i said
[1:33:17] they said you want some of this hazelnut
[1:33:18] this gentleman walked up i said no sir i
[1:33:20] said i don't i said i don't care for
[1:33:21] that stuff
[1:33:22] he said well you know what he said i
[1:33:24] like this stuff he said you know
[1:33:25] he said i used to drink beer he said but
[1:33:27] i just changed the rule for this i
[1:33:28] looked right at him and you know how
[1:33:29] panera's are set up i looked right at
[1:33:31] him i said well that's funny i said
[1:33:32] because i didn't have to quit nothing
[1:33:34] i said jesus christ came down and took
[1:33:36] the very desire from my life
[1:33:38] he stopped filling his coffee cup i'm
[1:33:40] glad because it ran over and burning
[1:33:41] he turned around and looked at me right
[1:33:43] there while people were right there in
[1:33:45] that place
[1:33:45] i said yes sir he said what do you mean
[1:33:47] i said well sir let me just say
[1:33:49] something to you
[1:33:50] because he what it was he's one of them
[1:33:52] guys that don't believe in god
[1:33:54] i could see his books that he had up
[1:33:56] there and he began to talk to me
[1:33:57] and it peaked at that point in time and
[1:34:00] you see when i began to speak to him
[1:34:02] just a little bit
[1:34:03] i said sir what it is i said is that all
[1:34:05] you've ever known about and it soured
[1:34:07] you
[1:34:08] is because you've only saw religion i
[1:34:10] said but i ain't talking to you about
[1:34:12] religion
[1:34:12] i said cause religion i said let me ask
[1:34:14] you something i said because
[1:34:16] i think you got enough knowledge about
[1:34:18] this who was it that crucified the lord
[1:34:20] jesus
[1:34:21] i said men that knew the word i said
[1:34:23] they knew the bible
[1:34:24] they knew the scriptures i said they
[1:34:26] crucified it i said why they were
[1:34:28] blinded
[1:34:29] it was a religious spirit that crucified
[1:34:32] the very one that they needed to receive
[1:34:36] oh he began to fellowship and here he
[1:34:39] came down
[1:34:40] right there brother it was just like a
[1:34:42] canopy sat down
[1:34:43] right around us and about that time i
[1:34:45] said sir the god that you've heard about
[1:34:48] the gods you've always wondered about
[1:34:50] he's standing right here
[1:34:51] right now in this place
[1:34:55] that man got so shook up in the presence
[1:34:57] of god he left his books
[1:34:59] left his coffee what'd you do i took him
[1:35:01] and i ran out to his car
[1:35:02] said you forgot these oh how i wish he
[1:35:05] would have just entered in
[1:35:08] he couldn't deny it it wasn't me
[1:35:11] it wasn't any vernacular that i had it
[1:35:13] was god himself
[1:35:15] you see what it was is my life like your
[1:35:17] life was simply
[1:35:19] a stage that he could step on and make
[1:35:22] himself
[1:35:23] known brother it wasn't man's words it
[1:35:26] was the presence of almighty god
[1:35:28] if that man could have only received it
[1:35:30] he would not have had to try this
[1:35:32] or read this anymore his days of trying
[1:35:35] to satisfy
[1:35:36] and read this book and read this book
[1:35:38] his days of self-help
[1:35:40] would have been over why because the
[1:35:42] helper was
[1:35:43] there
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:47] let me tell you he's here this morning
[1:35:51] he's here this morning hallelujah
[1:35:56] you see that is sin reigned unto death
[1:35:58] even so might grace
[1:36:00] reign through righteousness unto eternal
[1:36:02] life by jesus christ
[1:36:04] our lord
[1:36:09] so when we look at this true
[1:36:11] representation
[1:36:13] you see we were represented
[1:36:16] in adam in death
[1:36:20] but there came one the second adam
[1:36:23] to represent us in life
[1:36:28] amen god himself came down
[1:36:31] to become our representation
[1:36:35] he came to represent the inheritance
[1:36:39] that had been taken from the sons and
[1:36:41] daughters of god
[1:36:43] let me just try to i'm just going to try
[1:36:44] to bring this down here right now
[1:36:48] i know most of you know what that means
[1:36:51] you see the prophets
[1:36:55] the spirit of god would come down upon
[1:36:57] the prophets
[1:36:59] and they would speak and they would
[1:37:00] utter forth the living arctic oracles of
[1:37:03] the word of god
[1:37:05] it would represent even as moses would
[1:37:07] stand there and call for flies and
[1:37:09] other things that were taking place
[1:37:10] based on the needs in that moment it
[1:37:13] would recognize that
[1:37:14] even though here they were under a blood
[1:37:16] that was a bulls and
[1:37:18] and goats but they were walking
[1:37:20] steadfast in the word that god had given
[1:37:22] them
[1:37:23] and as they walked in that word the
[1:37:25] spirit of god would move into their life
[1:37:27] to where when needs arose they could
[1:37:29] speak like joshua
[1:37:31] like others you know they could speak
[1:37:33] and you see
[1:37:34] when we when we look at this the spirit
[1:37:36] of god would come down
[1:37:37] and you and i could look at that and
[1:37:38] realize that wait a minute that wasn't
[1:37:40] the man that opened the red sea that was
[1:37:42] god
[1:37:43] i mean it wasn't a man that went up
[1:37:45] there and brought the walls of jericho
[1:37:46] down
[1:37:47] that was god it wasn't a man who stopped
[1:37:50] the sun
[1:37:51] it was god in that man's voice that
[1:37:53] stopped the sun
[1:37:54] is that right so we're recognizing there
[1:37:56] are glimpses
[1:37:58] all along of this of this living
[1:38:01] inheritance that's to return to the sons
[1:38:04] and daughters of god
[1:38:05] you see what are you what are you
[1:38:06] talking about i'm saying that that
[1:38:08] inheritance
[1:38:09] would not be just that where the spirit
[1:38:11] of god would move down
[1:38:12] and then it would pull back then it
[1:38:14] would move down and then it would pull
[1:38:16] back
[1:38:16] i'm talking about to where when the
[1:38:18] spirit of god
[1:38:19] would be able to set down in and
[1:38:22] actually take
[1:38:23] its abode and begin to declare
[1:38:26] redemption has come you see that's what
[1:38:29] happened
[1:38:29] with the lord jesus christ when john's
[1:38:32] ministry
[1:38:33] was to was was to declare and announce
[1:38:35] the messiah
[1:38:36] now remember the only way he would know
[1:38:38] who the messiah was
[1:38:39] he would take the same pillar of fire to
[1:38:41] come down
[1:38:42] that john met and identify that this
[1:38:45] is the lamb of god and it would abide
[1:38:48] upon him is that what john said
[1:38:50] he would not come and go and come and go
[1:38:52] but it would actually abide on him
[1:38:54] what was that speaking of that was
[1:38:56] speaking of sons
[1:38:58] and daughters of god that would actually
[1:39:00] enter back in
[1:39:01] to their inheritance we're not coming
[1:39:03] into the land going out of the land
[1:39:05] coming into the land going out of the
[1:39:07] land but brother by one spirit
[1:39:11] we have been baptized into one
[1:39:14] body are you with me we're talking about
[1:39:18] a true
[1:39:19] living evidence in the word
[1:39:23] now let me just pause here for a minute
[1:39:25] it brings it to me you might get cold
[1:39:28] but don't ever let don't ever let
[1:39:29] yourself stay in that kind of condition
[1:39:32] if you're cold what should i do get up
[1:39:34] next to the fire
[1:39:36] get some wood on the fire start allowing
[1:39:38] god
[1:39:39] that your life would be evaluated what
[1:39:41] is it that's getting between me
[1:39:43] and god well brother samuel i feel so
[1:39:45] defeated why are you feeling so defeated
[1:39:48] i'll tell you why you're feeling
[1:39:49] defeated is because you're not
[1:39:51] abiding in his presence like you ought
[1:39:54] to be
[1:39:55] when you abide in his presence this is a
[1:39:57] privilege that you and i have
[1:39:58] we're not just church members this
[1:40:01] message never come
[1:40:02] to bring us an association of just a few
[1:40:05] things we can
[1:40:06] talk around it and be affiliated with
[1:40:08] that's not what this message is about
[1:40:11] this message come to sound out to the
[1:40:14] children of god
[1:40:15] this is your inheritance and
[1:40:18] live in this inheritance amen live in it
[1:40:23] all that god has put in his word is for
[1:40:25] you and i
[1:40:26] in this hour he has freely given us all
[1:40:29] things
[1:40:31] you say brother sam what are you talking
[1:40:32] about i'm talking about if your prayer
[1:40:34] life has got down
[1:40:35] you need to just you need to just make a
[1:40:36] real consecration of god
[1:40:38] and say lord forgive me and start
[1:40:40] looking at what little things that the
[1:40:41] devil
[1:40:42] has tried to put in the way to get
[1:40:44] between you and your prayer life

[1:40:48] land he ain't gonna put a bottle of
[1:40:49] whiskey in your way

[1:40:55] seem very
[1:40:56] innocent i'm just going to preach now
[1:41:02] he'll use things that you could look at
[1:41:04] and you could try to justify
[1:41:06] well i know so-and-so does this and
[1:41:08] so-and-so does that
[1:41:09] but your birth is not based on so-and-so
[1:41:12] so why are you trying to live your life
[1:41:13] based on so-and-so
[1:41:15] you should not be walking according to
[1:41:17] what i see others do this or i see
[1:41:19] others do that you don't live your life
[1:41:20] on that
[1:41:21] because what if they jump off a bridge

[1:41:24] what's your excuse going to be well lord
[1:41:26] i just was watching them he said shame
[1:41:28] on you
[1:41:29] you should have your eyes on me your
[1:41:32] eyes is to be on the pillar fire are you
[1:41:33] hearing me this morning
[1:41:35] you see you can sit right here in the
[1:41:36] church you can backslide something right
[1:41:38] here
[1:41:39] in the church how can that happen when
[1:41:41] the word itself is coming forth and you
[1:41:43] don't apply yourself
[1:41:45] you don't give yourself to it you don't
[1:41:47] pray you don't read well brother samuel
[1:41:49] i still love the lord i'm not calling
[1:41:51] that in question
[1:41:52] but i'm asking you are you living in
[1:41:55] your inheritance
[1:41:58] or are you just taking up space
[1:42:02] but i mean what are you saying i'm
[1:42:04] saying live
[1:42:06] live when god passed by israel
[1:42:09] and she was there in the condition of
[1:42:11] her sin
[1:42:12] he went by her and said live
[1:42:16] live live out
[1:42:19] that life as a son and daughter of god
[1:42:24] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[1:42:29] satan will use anything
[1:42:32] let me just give you something right
[1:42:33] here because i happen to be a pastor
[1:42:36] your pastor you realize that satan would
[1:42:38] love to get me so busy
[1:42:40] with cares of the people
[1:42:44] you all oh brother salmon you're a
[1:42:46] pastor
[1:42:48] but a pastor gets so busy brother brown
[1:42:52] warns
[1:42:52] every minister over and over in the
[1:42:54] message he said don't you ever
[1:42:56] get too busy where you can't
[1:42:59] pray and hear god's voice
[1:43:03] listen aren't you interested in fixing
[1:43:05] people's problems nope
[1:43:07] nope nope nope brother samuel where's
[1:43:10] your heart at because i can't fix them
[1:43:15] we could sit in that office a month or
[1:43:17] sundays but unless you receive the word
[1:43:19] and submit your life to the word it'll
[1:43:21] never do a bit of good
[1:43:23] and let me just go and drop this god
[1:43:24] never intended that the pastor would be
[1:43:26] the personal
[1:43:27] psychiatrist counselor and everything
[1:43:30] else he intended that the word
[1:43:32] would be your counselor the word would
[1:43:34] be your god
[1:43:35] he said no i'll never leave you nor
[1:43:38] forsake you
[1:43:40] it's true there's times that you have to
[1:43:42] talk to me
[1:43:43] as your pastor it's true and don't ever
[1:43:45] let the enemy tell you well this is a
[1:43:47] silly old question
[1:43:48] it'd be better that we sit down and we
[1:43:51] look at it because that old sleuthing
[1:43:53] the devil
[1:43:53] might be trying to tell you something he
[1:43:56] might be trying to run you down
[1:43:57] and he's afraid to get in the presence
[1:43:59] where the word is a living sword
[1:44:01] and he's uncovered why because now
[1:44:04] you're not just walking alone
[1:44:06] as you feel it but the spirit of god has
[1:44:09] uncovered that devil
[1:44:10] that's trying to hinder you what will
[1:44:12] happen to a son and daughter of god
[1:44:13] they'll unite with that word and say
[1:44:16] devil
[1:44:17] you had me thinking this you had me
[1:44:19] feeling this
[1:44:21] pretty soon it won't be the pastor
[1:44:22] calling him a liar you'll be calling him
[1:44:24] a liar
[1:44:26] [Applause]
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:29] tables turn pretty quick don't they
[1:44:32] so there's a simple example just simple
[1:44:36] things of life
[1:44:37] even things that that is part of my duty
[1:44:40] and my responsibility
[1:44:41] there's things that's part of your duty
[1:44:43] and responsibility i might as well close
[1:44:45] this
[1:44:46] there's things that's part of your duty
[1:44:48] and responsibility
[1:44:49] as parents i know many you've got
[1:44:51] children and things like that
[1:44:53] there's parts and duties that are our
[1:44:54] responsibility maybe his grandparents or
[1:44:56] whatever more
[1:44:57] but never ever should anything a family
[1:45:00] or whatever more
[1:45:01] get in the way of god being first
[1:45:04] in our life satan is subtle he's sly
[1:45:08] what's he wanting to do he's trying to
[1:45:09] get us outside of our
[1:45:11] inheritance what should i do
[1:45:14] live in the place that god has called
[1:45:17] you
[1:45:17] to live in brother i will make this
[1:45:19] statement in the message influence i'm
[1:45:21] closing
[1:45:22] he said you watch he said god will bless
[1:45:24] a family
[1:45:25] and brother brahma uses examples of
[1:45:27] natural things he said they get a better
[1:45:29] home
[1:45:30] get a better car he said they're in a
[1:45:32] better neighborhood he gives all these
[1:45:33] examples which things would that maybe
[1:45:35] sometimes people say boy we need better
[1:45:36] this and we need better that and we need
[1:45:37] better this and better that
[1:45:39] and then get into a better place
[1:45:42] don't just limit it to that but just
[1:45:43] think of the word better if we get this
[1:45:45] better
[1:45:46] and brother that says what happens is he
[1:45:48] said they start
[1:45:49] the getting away from the presence of
[1:45:51] god
[1:45:53] the brethren said you must always stay
[1:45:56] where the presence of god
[1:45:58] is where the presence of god is there to
[1:46:01] affect
[1:46:02] and influence your life brother and
[1:46:04] sister i know that we are called upon to
[1:46:06] make decisions
[1:46:11] y'all hearing me i know we got decisions
[1:46:14] we have to make
[1:46:15] decisions are made in the mind
[1:46:19] that's the battleground that's no man's
[1:46:21] land it's like this right here
[1:46:23] this aisle right down here this isle is
[1:46:26] in no man's land
[1:46:27] it doesn't belong to this side it
[1:46:29] doesn't belong to that side
[1:46:31] if somebody wants to walk out of this
[1:46:32] and go right down here and walk to the
[1:46:34] bathroom
[1:46:35] you walk right down through here if
[1:46:37] somebody wants to come in that way they
[1:46:38] walk right down through here
[1:46:39] this does not belong to either side of
[1:46:41] the church it's a no man's land
[1:46:43] that's your mind and decisions
[1:46:47] are made in the mind
[1:46:50] and the enemy likes to come in with such
[1:46:52] subtleness
[1:46:54] he likes to use things and to try to
[1:46:56] bring snap traps
[1:46:58] and ensnarement what do i do brother
[1:47:00] samuel i'd let the word discern it
[1:47:02] i'd be honest before god and this is
[1:47:05] what i would do if there are things that
[1:47:06] that you see that you know are in the
[1:47:08] way let me just tell you something
[1:47:10] friends
[1:47:11] if in a person a person's life say i
[1:47:13] tell you what i know this is the will of
[1:47:15] god and they're not praying like they
[1:47:16] ought to be
[1:47:17] they're not staying in the word like
[1:47:19] they ought to be how can you be so sure
[1:47:20] that that's
[1:47:21] god's will you're walking on emotions
[1:47:25] and of feelings
[1:47:26] we're living in a time where there's
[1:47:28] things that we ought to be praying about
[1:47:29] and not
[1:47:30] just taking things for granted well we
[1:47:32] can do this and we can do that
[1:47:33] and we can do this let me just tell you

[1:47:52] times when that happens
[1:47:53] but don't let that right there be an
[1:47:55] encouragement to stay cold

[1:47:59] his grace knows about
[1:48:01] your situation and he's coming to woo
[1:48:03] you

[1:50:08] you can let it go
[1:50:11] if there's things that you look back and
[1:50:13] say i got a little cold let it go
[1:50:15] just let it go don't it's not wallowing
[1:50:18] in it
[1:50:19] let it go let it go and move on
[1:50:22] with the lord and ask god say lord
[1:50:25] sharpen my discernment because there's
[1:50:27] not one person that's here there's not
[1:50:29] one believer that's here that could say
[1:50:31] you know well yeah there's been some
[1:50:33] traps in my life there's been some
[1:50:35] decisions i
[1:50:35] wish i'd have made a different decision
[1:50:37] concerning this every
[1:50:39] one of us have been there every one of
[1:50:43] us have been in a state
[1:50:44] just like joshua was when joshua coming
[1:50:47] into the land
[1:50:48] and remember here they come and the
[1:50:50] gibeonites come
[1:50:51] and here he finds a situation where he
[1:50:53] looks at it and all of a sudden these
[1:50:55] guys come and they say
[1:50:56] hey we come from a long distance man
[1:50:58] look at us we got holes in our shoes
[1:51:00] holes in our garments we got moldy bread
[1:51:02] and everything is tale
[1:51:04] and joshua should have checked it with
[1:51:06] the word
[1:51:08] but instead he went by feelings
[1:51:12] right god told him
[1:51:16] that it's to go to the euro and the
[1:51:19] priest
[1:51:19] says in the book of numbers that joshua
[1:51:21] and elias are the priests
[1:51:23] with the hero shall divide the land
[1:51:25] because the land
[1:51:27] give me this right here because the land
[1:51:29] itself the holy spirit
[1:51:31] is divided to you and i by the word
[1:51:33] because he sends
[1:51:35] the spirit in his name
[1:51:38] are you with me the holy ghost a new
[1:51:41] birth does not come out of
[1:51:43] does not come outside of the word
[1:51:48] there is an authority there is that
[1:51:50] discernment so
[1:51:51] every every one of us at times we could
[1:51:53] probably go we could go right through
[1:51:54] here and say you know what
[1:51:55] there's been some times where i made a
[1:51:57] pact with some gibeonites
[1:52:00] what do i do brother samuel well don't
[1:52:02] be looking for holy shoes the next time
[1:52:04] don't be looking for stale bread but
[1:52:06] brother samuel how am i gonna know it
[1:52:08] go to the word that you didn't go to the
[1:52:10] first time
[1:52:11] remember the word is the filter that god
[1:52:14] has given us in this hour
[1:52:16] i don't care how something looks i don't
[1:52:18] care how it feels
[1:52:19] it might look right it might feel right
[1:52:21] but what does the word
[1:52:24] say about it are you hearing me what
[1:52:26] does the word say about it
[1:52:28] it's not what i feel it's not what i
[1:52:30] think it's not what things seem to be
[1:52:33] you and i listen my brother and sister
[1:52:35] discernment by the spirit of god
[1:52:37] there's things that you and i can look
[1:52:39] at and until god reveals it because
[1:52:41] there ain't nobody here a prophet
[1:52:44] come on now there's things that god did
[1:52:45] not even show brother branham at time
[1:52:47] about a person's character or something
[1:52:48] like that right out from first are you
[1:52:50] hearing me
[1:52:51] but you see god in his time this is
[1:52:54] where everything is to be weighed
[1:52:55] and balanced by the word i what do you
[1:52:57] what are you saying i'm saying as
[1:52:59] parents
[1:52:59] as grandparents as husbands as wives i'm
[1:53:02] saying as a church
[1:53:04] that let everything itself pass through
[1:53:07] the word
[1:53:08] if it can't pass through the word with
[1:53:10] the spirit
[1:53:11] blessing then i say don't even be a
[1:53:14] partaker of it
[1:53:17] can i get an amen on that one lord
[1:53:20] that's the truth
[1:53:21] let the word because why god has made
[1:53:24] you
[1:53:25] to live in victory
[1:53:30] you know how it is in your life you know
[1:53:31] you start maybe you're not eating right
[1:53:33] or
[1:53:33] there's things that you start letting go
[1:53:35] and here and there sometimes
[1:53:38] just one little thing let me do one
[1:53:40] little thing right here
[1:53:41] like let's say somebody's electrolytes
[1:53:42] gets off man you're in a mess of trouble
[1:53:47] you know in bad trouble it affects
[1:53:50] everything effects all kinds of things

[1:53:53] other things in your body and so forth
[1:53:54] it can get we can get wide open we can
[1:53:56] get really off
[1:53:57] but what has to take place there's got
[1:53:59] to be a replenishment
[1:54:01] and a continual nourishing of the needed
[1:54:04] nutrients and brother let me tell you
[1:54:07] something
[1:54:08] we are not looking for food in this hour
[1:54:11] god has provided food
[1:54:16] let me just give you a little bit of
[1:54:17] admonition well brother samuel when i
[1:54:18] come to the house of god
[1:54:20] i know god ministers to us i know god
[1:54:22] meets our need
[1:54:23] but let me encourage you you need to be
[1:54:25] in the message
[1:54:27] you need to get in the message of the
[1:54:28] hour or brother samuel i don't
[1:54:30] understand it you mean you'd let that
[1:54:32] devil deprive you
[1:54:33] i would just renounce that devil i would
[1:54:36] put on the message
[1:54:37] and say god give me what i have need of
[1:54:40] yes

[1:55:00] is your place
[1:55:01] this is your word this is your message
[1:55:03] that same god
[1:55:04] is the god who is present to reveal just
[1:55:07] what you have need of
[1:55:09] well i can't say it like so and so god
[1:55:11] ain't interested if you can say it like
[1:55:12] so and so
[1:55:13] so-and-so might be saying a lot of
[1:55:15] things and not living it god's
[1:55:16] interested in your heart lining up with
[1:55:18] it and living it
[1:55:20] amen
[1:55:28] let's pray
[1:55:34] oh jesus
[1:55:40] i wonder if there's one this morning
[1:55:44] you want to be remembered in prayer
[1:55:49] god bless you
[1:55:53] maybe there's one this morning that
[1:55:56] god's called to you in your life and let
[1:55:58] you know
[1:56:01] you're not meant to be a servant you're
[1:56:03] meant to be a son of god
[1:56:05] you're meant to be a daughter of god
[1:56:08] amen god bless you
[1:56:11] amen let's just invite him
[1:56:15] he's already here and you just invite
[1:56:17] him for what you have need of
[1:56:21] i know that no doubt sitting right here
[1:56:22] in the building
[1:56:24] there's lives that i'm going to ask you
[1:56:27] to take
[1:56:28] your eyes off of yourself off all your
[1:56:30] failures
[1:56:32] i'm going to ask you to take your eyes
[1:56:33] off brother samuel you don't know this
[1:56:34] sin that's in my life
[1:56:36] i don't need to know it but what i'm
[1:56:39] asking you
[1:56:40] is if you can look to the lord jesus
[1:56:42] that there's one who's already
[1:56:44] made a way to where you go from being
[1:56:48] reigned over
[1:56:50] to where you reign over it
[1:56:54] you say lord i want that reality in my
[1:56:57] life
[1:56:59] i want that reality but sam what reality
[1:57:01] are you talking about i'm talking about
[1:57:03] the spirit of the living god
[1:57:06] moving in in the very depths of your
[1:57:08] life
[1:57:09] listen whether you're streaming whether
[1:57:11] you're here no matter where you're at
[1:57:13] don't just settle for a part way life
[1:57:16] don't don't just settle for that friends
[1:57:19] go all the way because a part way life
[1:57:22] it's never it's not the inheritance but
[1:57:25] go all the way
[1:57:27] let god take you all the way into your
[1:57:29] inheritance
[1:57:30] to everything that he's placed he's sown
[1:57:32] and he's desired for your life it'll
[1:57:33] come forth
[1:57:36] amen would there be one to say lord take
[1:57:39] me there
[1:57:40] take me there and then god bless you
[1:57:45] it reminds you temptation can come sure
[1:57:49] temptation is not sin though
[1:57:52] heeding it is sin
[1:57:56] not here this morning as the spirit of
[1:57:59] the lord to just

[1:58:11] [Music]
[1:58:12] lord god i i've drawn a little cold
[1:58:16] sometimes just decisions not not
[1:58:18] necessarily things that would be
[1:58:19] regarded as sin it's just things start
[1:58:22] getting between you
[1:58:24] and him oh you're not a sinner
[1:58:28] you're a believer you're a son and
[1:58:30] daughter of god living in your
[1:58:32] inheritance

[1:58:35] life but it just feels like your life

[1:58:40] i want it to be
[1:58:43] lord jesus i want to draw night to you

[1:58:51] lord
[1:58:53] i realize there's some decisions that i
[1:58:56] should have made some better ones lord
[1:58:58] but i'm owning them lord and i'm asking
[1:59:01] you lord god
[1:59:03] not only forgive me but guide me lord
[1:59:05] help me to be more sensitive knowing
[1:59:07] that the test

[2:00:55] because that's the reality lord when we
[2:00:57] can look away

[2:01:11] inspected the sacrifice
[2:01:14] was there any spot blemish or brokenness

[2:01:30] us lord the perfect

[2:02:33] that lord god stands to represent
[2:02:37] us and what we're asking for lord a life
[2:02:41] that's asking for deliverance that's
[2:02:42] asking for freedom

[2:02:46] asking lord for healing in their body no
[2:02:48] matter
[2:02:48] what it is lord there's a blood
[2:02:51] that's greater than that blood that came
[2:02:54] by the sexual birth

[2:02:58] represent
[2:03:00] that all that we ask for lord god
