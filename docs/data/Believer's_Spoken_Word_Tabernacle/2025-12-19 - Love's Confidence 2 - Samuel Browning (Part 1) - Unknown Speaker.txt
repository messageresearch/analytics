Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh so brother Ram as he told us he said if you're a believer then there's nothing impossible with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because because of him nothing that we could do but it's because of him and we believe him. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we stand here tonight to believe that no matter what day of the week it is, he's still the same God. &gt;&gt; We we don't come to church differently on Thursday than we do on Sunday. God is the same God at all times. Amen. And we so appreciate that. So enjoyed the songs and um so we just want to turn our hearts here just in this further part of the service just right into the word of the [music] Lord. So let's just go to him in a word of prayer and then we'll get right into the word tonight. Heavenly Father, how thankful we are for your mercies, Lord, once again this day. Lord, we have truly so much to be thankful for, dear God, for all that you have done for us. And most importantly, Lord, when we think of that, yes, there's been a lot ways that Lord, that you have provided, not only physically, oh God, in touching us, strengthening our bodies, but how we are so thankful that God, that you brought us to yourself. We're thankful that you found us, Lord, because Father, it's through that, Lord, that there's a real strength that comes into our hearts. It's a confidence, Lord, that is not produced by anything that we have done, but it's the grace of God. Lord, I pray tonight that you would just come by our way, Lord, once again, Lord, as we're gathered here, Father, to come to hear from you. That's what we want to hear from Lord. We want to hear from you. We ask that you would speak to our hearts, Lord, through your word. For all the different needs, Lord, that have been read, spoken and unspoken. Father, we just commit it all into your hands. We ask oh God that knowing that there are many needs Lord that's among us needs upon our hearts and we commit every one of them into your hands Lord we thank you for your mercy Lord we ask that God you'll just come and just take your word and speak to our hearts Lord and just commit myself Lord to you and this congregation and may you just have your way we pray in Jesus precious name amen Amen. Amen. God bless you. And let's go right into the [clears throat] scriptures here tonight. And I want to just move into this portion of scripture. Amen. And uh [clears throat] look at a little bit of where we were uh last week. And Amen. So good to see each and every one of you. And um [clears throat] Brother Brian had already mentioned that with where things will change, but I had looked at it here just to even a little bit ago that as far as where the ice and so forth. For those of you that'll be driving to early in the morning, I think at about 5 and 6 in the morning is when that is supposed to drop. The temperatures very very quickly. So, it's just going to continue to go down, but we're good here. [laughter] And so, I know maybe some of the the kids are thinking, man, you know, don't do a rain dance for for ice. You do you do an ice dance, you know, but uh but so just uh we just want to pray. And I I was saying, you know, I trust that there's enough salt that's been down on the road. And I know some places I've been, I've walked more on salt than I have on the concrete. And so we just trust the Lord and just just ask each and everyone just be careful there in the morning and the Lord will just watch over us. So that doesn't mean I'm going to keep you tonight. [laughter] So let's read here verse 14. Amen. In first John, we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world. And whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love, and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him. And herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness or confidence in the day of judgment. Because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath torment, and he that fearth is not made perfect in love, and we love him because he first loved us. Amen. May God bless you. Bless the reading of the word as it's being seated. [clears throat] I want to just continue to pick up this uh thought here just for a few moments tonight and moving forward. Um and when we are looking [clears throat] here in these scriptures that we have read in our text to see how that John would write of it and maybe I'll just pull it back up. We have seen and do testify. This this word seen is the uh same word that would be used where John would say we have known and believe. So it's what God has revealed to them. And this is where John is able to write with such an assurance and such a confidence because not only to be able to perceive what God has done and that to be revealed but then to believe that. And the only way we can really believe it and it becomes something that is real personal is when God would reveal this personally to our hearts that what he has done for us in that becoming our redeemer and our savior. And so when we look at this, this is the whole uh objective of the gospel of Jesus Christ is to bring that revelation. The very first opening scripture in the book of revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ. This is the whole goal of what God is to bring to the heart and life of the believer. And then through that revelation taking hold within a person's heart, it will bring about an absolute change within their life. And it will create a faith that will actually reach to govern circumstances in their life that can come up. It will also be through that revelation where there will be a continual unfolding then of the very character and the nature of Christ becoming more and more one with him. And so when we're looking at this, God's desire within our hearts is that we would stand with confidence. God does not want us to be unsettled in our walk or in our in where we are with him. God always is interested in that bringing that of stability and where that we would be in our walk. There's always that place to where we can actually know where we're standing with God. And so I want to just kind of come back into this here just a moment and read this particular quote that we have read here a few different times. And brother Bham says it like this. He says, "We we know that drinking and carrying on is sin, but the whole thing is because of unbelief because if you believe God and Jesus Christ to be his son, you are absolutely not going to do those things. He that's born of God does not commit sin or a practitioner of it. You must believe and the whole thing lays in faith. He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but already passed from death into life. And brother Bram says, you believe that to be the truth, there it lays. There isn't nothing else you can do but only believe. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And if you believe, then them little immoral things will just drop off like that. As you believe, you become love &gt;&gt; and love is God. And you begin to wind yourself into Christ. And then and then these other things, you don't have to quit doing them. They just quit themselves because how why would that be? The lifeline to them or the desire, the appetite is cut off. So if there is no more desire for it, then it will not no longer be there. And so then the the simplicity, you don't have to quit doing them. They'll just quit themselves. There's just no desire to do it because the worshipper having purged has no more conscience or desire of sin. And so when we look at this this real purging and the cleansing that comes in our heart and we can see what God has done within our life to be able to actually catch a hold of the love of God and be able to see, you know, many can look and even when it starts in our life to begin to see how that God would come down and through that of salvation that God had become our savior. But then to see that it was more than just uh knowing and accepting him in the in the in that of Lord forgive me of my sins and to know that but then that it would come into the depth of what his coming was about in order to produce a sanctified life, a separated life to where it would bring about a relationship. And I I understand that there's things that when even as a person would come to serve the Lord, there's a lot of things you want to know and things of Lord I I don't want to do this or I don't want to do that. I don't want to do anything that would displease him. And that that's something that never it never departs from your life. It's something that would continue on. And it it moves into a place. So let me explain it to you like this. It moves into a place within your life to where that everything you begin to find the evaluating decisions you'll make based on how will this affect my walk with God. How will it bring influence? So it will it becomes to a question to where that it's not so much is this right or is this wrong. You begin to live your life based on how will this affect or take up my time or take up my walk. How will it affect my walk with God? This is where the deepening of the love of God within our life that you can see that I just he said my life just he said you just get so full of God it just pushed all those other things out &gt;&gt; and you see it wasn't something that anybody told him uh you know you can't ride your motorcycle because there's nothing wrong there's nothing wrong against it then your life begins to be weighed on it's really living a life that's pleasing unto the Lord so once the Holy Spirit has come then your life comes into that channel of how that I might be able to please him and to serve him better. And so, you know, when brother Brandham would would take this over and over, you're familiar through the message that, you know, God's desire and through the scriptures is not that we would u serve him under a slaveike mentality. And I realized that sometimes that even as I said when God first gets a hold of a life and sometimes it can be from what we've come out from under maybe previous teaching or other things and sometimes it's not even that it's just our own perception and we come into a place and it's like that we are are living our lives as though that it's at any moment that oh if if I do something or if I do this and and and and everything is then it's just under a slaveike mentality. ity. Now, let me just say this to you. You can be a fullyborn son of God and still have a slaveike mentality. &gt;&gt; And that's one of the objectives that God wants to clean that out because that can never bring about in our life what God would lead us to. Because slaveike mentality is based on if I do this, I feel like this. If I do this, then God loves me. You can never change God's love for you. &gt;&gt; You know, you or I, our love will grow. That's true. And our love grows is the more that we'll believe him, the more that the love that the love of God will move within our hearts. But in reality, it's not that God loves you anymore now tonight where you're sitting than he did when you was so far out in the world. The love of God was the same because his love goes clear back before there was Adam, stardust or molecule. And it was his love that led him even in the mind of God to where that he would make a propituation before there was any atom stardust molecule before there was ever any angels before the devil became the devil and led the others astray. God always loved you. And the degree that he loved you was so that he would a would absolutely or it would be displayed that he would absolutely make a way for you and that God would bring it about so that you and I might come back to a full relationship with almighty God. So you know there's a lot of things and I realize there's times and we go through and I'm not saying that we would not focus on our walk with God. I believe you begin to see the value of things within your life. You begin to see the value in your walk with God of overcoming your flesh and putting your flesh in subjection. So just in case you haven't known it that even when the Holy Spirit comes, the flesh man is never going to reach over into the soul man and shake hands and say, "We're buddies." &gt;&gt; It'll never. The prophet said, "It's a constant war until the day you're set free." This flesh don't like to pray. The flesh don't like to go to church. Flesh don't like to read. As a matter of fact, you have to tell your flesh even in times when you don't feel like listening to a message. You don't feel like praying. And you come to a place to realize press beyond that feeling. It's a barrier and to press beyond that. And you you understand you many of us have been serving the Lord long enough that you realize in pressing beyond that, you don't let that barrier stand there to define you. whether or not you are a Christian or a believer or not. You begin to recognize and begin to discern the tactics of the enemy and to understand that there's feelings that will always be there. But that's not what you live your life by is your feelings because you're going to have good feeling days, you're going to have bad feeling days. But remember, the love of God never changes. It never fluctuates based on the stock market. It don't change anything about you. As a matter of fact, even though like the prophet said, you would go astray, he still stands right there to welcome you back. &gt;&gt; My So if we can just God help us to even, you know, even here tonight with every one of us that that love would so deepen in our hearts for what God has already done for us. Because this quote that I just read to you, it is not about anything that God has to do for us. It's about us accepting what God has already done for us. I I pray that God will help it to be so real and make it so real to each of our hearts to where brother Brown would use this over and over about, you know, himself going overseas. And he says, "What if every time that I set before I went to go overseas, we were going to be separated and, you know, Sister Mey set him down. I'll tell you what, Bill, if you ever even flirt with with another woman or you do this or if I I'll tell you what, I you will find your bags on the doorstep when you get home. And then Brother Bram says, "Well, let me tell you something." And brother Bram says, "What kind of a home &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; would that be?" But you so brother Rammy as he goes into that and he says now he says she'll never she'll never it that will be not something that would ever happen if I if I love her like that what way what way that I would love her like that that I would would even though that she might forgive me uh I could get by with that she would forgive me but I would not want to do that to hurt her &gt;&gt; and so brother Brown would say this he would he would apply this principle that you and I might be able to relate to this to be able to see that though God could give a person and say you know what if you want to go smoke go smoke if you want to drink go drink if God would say something like that to you or me that would literally scare me to death &gt;&gt; what do you see in me Lord that you would think I want permission to do that &gt;&gt; I don't want to do anything like that that those things the desire have been taken from my life. And so, it's not that we're not doing those other things. It's not, oh, I'm dressing this way cuz if I don't dress right, then sure is the world, Brother Samuel's going to blast it. And if I don't if I if I do this and then so and so is going to say this. You you're living beneath your privileges. You need to understand what the love of God has done for you that it's so far greater than any pleasure that you can have in life. It will bring you such satisfaction. As a matter of fact, it will bring you THE ULTIMATE ACCEPTANCE THAT NO MATTER IF YOU NO MATTER HOW MANY LIKES or dislikes on Facebook or whatever more, you will have the ultimate acceptance when that revelation of Jesus Christ has broke into your heart. Sin flees from your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is why brother Brown when he would say that my heart, he says, I don't believe my heart would let me do it. Now watch how he goes on right after making those statements. He says, "When I look at my Lord and see he died yonder on Calvary, the lovely for me, the unloly, he, the pure for me, the impure to save me from a death of sin and an eternity in hell. Something in me, if I could get by with it, I don't want to do it. I love him." He said, "Yes, sir. I love him. Even if I thought if I'd go do it and he'd forgive me. I don't want to do it anyhow. I don't want to do nothing to hurt him. I love him too much. That's what we have to have. It's something in your heart love. &gt;&gt; Oh, it it don't condemn me to smoke. You know, I I drink a little. I Well, brother, you don't love him. Something's happened if you really love him. &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said, "I used to have a person in the Baptist church." He goes on in this quote. They said, "This person would constantly ask me," Brother Brandham, do you think it's wrong to smoke? Do you think it's wrong to drink? And Brother Brham says, "You know, I wrote this little answer in my Bible." And in this answer or response to it, Brother Bram said, I wrote, "Don't ask me foolish questions. Make this up in your mind. If you love the Lord with all your heart, you won't smoke, chew, drink any shine." He said, "That still holds good tonight. So you see it what matters is where is the depth of God's love in your life. &gt;&gt; See remember the prophet tells us he'll say the altar is in your heart. Then he'll say the altar is in your mind. It's not conflicting because as the man thinkketh in his heart so is he. And so God will meet you right there. And a person can absolutely catch a hold of the love of God and repent of their sins and yet still have the same desires in their life that they always had. What what is the need? It's for the love of God to go deeper in their life and for them to go deeper in God's love. You see, the only way that that will come is is really submitting ourselves to the Lord and saying, "God, make it more real to me. make it more sure TO ME BECAUSE FLESH AND BLOOD ain't going to give it to us. It ain't going to be something that's taught into us or schooled in us. As a matter of fact, the prophet said in Satan's Eden, your new birth is not schooled in you or taught in you. It's predestinated from the hand of God from before the foundation of the world. So God knows the very moment and the time. God's not taken back by it and said, "Oh, let me get a picture here cuz I didn't know it was going to happen here. I didn't know it was going to happen like that." As a matter of fact, within even and many lives, God has to bring the realization to your heart of even what has already taken place in your life when the desire of the world has fled from your heart. So if you love or a person still loves the world, it's just not went deep enough yet. But the reality is as we will believe, we become love. &gt;&gt; And so what does that do? Well, you know, it'll actually produce a confidence and a trust in our life as we walk. It will actually produce that trust. Love will a faith that when we walk and no matter what circumstances, no matter what situations arise, there's a love that holds steady in the midst of it all. And that is the love of God that has been placed in our hearts. Now I want you to look here in the scripture of Ephesians 3. And Paul would write it in this way and say, "I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you which is your glory. For this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named, and that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man, that Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye being rooted and grounded in love. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So notice how Paul writes this. his his prayer is that the the children of God would absolutely come to know the depth of God's love that that that Christ would dwell in our hearts by faith being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth length depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you might be filled filled with all the fullness of God. Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according to the power that workketh in us. Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages world without end. Amen. Now this last part of it unto him that is able. All of this is is that reality that what the re what the being rooted and grounded in the love of God and that that in itself will lead to a faith dwelling in our hearts then as we approach the circumstances and conditions of life and no matter what it is maybe you're praying for a loved one maybe there's situations at home maybe there's a financial need maybe there's a lot of things even when we look even into our own lives and know that God's desire is is a deepening of his own life within us. In other words, that our life is lived day by day to be conformed to the image of almighty God. So, and so in that in that regards when God gave us the new birth, he didn't just all of a sudden say, "You're done with patience, boy. You're patient. You're ready to go." No. The new birth puts us into the place to start to grow up into him in all things. Is there a measure of patience? Yes. Is there a measure of faith? Yes. Knowledge? Yes. Virtue? Yes. All of those things in a very small measure. But within that, it now comes into the place to where we would become more and more into his own image. And God will only actually bring us and lead us into those places as he would reveal it. And we can actually see and submit and surrender our lives. You say, "How long will that go on?" Until we're changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. until we're changed. And when we're changed, remember when whether it we passed and go before or by the way of the grave or it is at the consummation of the rapture. To me, it's a great miracle of how that the character itself what God has so placed within everyone of the hearts of the believer has come to the perfection of what God has called for even within that stature of a perfect man. That in itself is absolutely I mean to see how God is working and bringing us all into that place of to become more and more like him. And who doesn't want to be more like him? That's what real love does. I want to be more like him. And it isn't so much becoming more like him in great big things. It's in the little things. It's in each one of these aspects of our life. But what will actually lead and bring those things about in our life? Well, first of all, there's got to be a love there because if there's not a love there, then he's not going to be able to talk to us and really speak to us in that way and call for a greater depth. As our husband of faith, of knowledge, of virtue, of temperance, but as our husband, when the word will come forth, we recognize the word has not come to destroy us. It's not come to condemn us, but the word has come to bring to light little areas that maybe were not brought to light before, but as we're walking in the light and not only walking in it, BUT OUR LIVES BECOME FILLED with more of that divine light and as the love of God taking over IN OUR LIFE, LITTLE things that were little things before, now they stand out in a greater way. What's doing that in our life? It's the love of God. When you read in Ephesians 5, that love that of a husband that would have for his wife, like the love that the Lord Jesus has for us, it is a sanctifying love. Not a not a put down, not a condemning. It's a love that is cleansing and it's looking to raise us up. Not raise back raise up that first birth, but raise up that attribute that he came to redeem that that would come back fully into the expression of all that God has called for. And it's a confidence within our lives because there's many things that God will actually would ask of us and we could look and say, "Lord, you sure you got the right guy? Lord, how how how would I be able to do this?" But it all comes back to not by power, not by might, not name it, claim it, but by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. It's all about us recognizing our weaknesses in his presence.
