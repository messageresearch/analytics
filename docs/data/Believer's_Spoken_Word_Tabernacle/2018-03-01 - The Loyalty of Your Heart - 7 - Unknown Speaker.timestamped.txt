[17:57] help us Lord in the remaining part of
[17:59] the service Lord your God I pray that
[18:02] you'll just Lord watch over it's Lord
[18:04] you know the conditions Lord that are
[18:06] outside with the weather the father I
[18:08] just pray Lord as we commit these things
[18:11] into your hands Lord and father just
[18:14] leaving it there Lord and that we might
[18:16] Lord be able to enjoy ourselves in you

[18:22] Lord to express to our hearts tonight
[18:24] father we want to say we love you Lord
[18:26] we appreciate you father in the name of
[18:29] the Lord Jesus Christ may you minister
[18:31] to every need more amen
[18:35] god bless you let's let's look in Romans
[18:38] chapter 5 and verse 1
[18:58] certainly wasn't planning on the the
[19:01] weather and the conditions the way that
[19:02] it was and its how everything kind of
[19:06] just has taken us by surprise even
[19:09] though I'm watching that looking at that
[19:10] looking on the radar but so we need to
[19:21] know where I came from in Quebec brother
[19:24] Steve Brisson was flying on those roads
[19:27] and those roads were iced iced over each
[19:31] service and so I was just sitting in the
[19:35] car I said to the Lord Jesus cuz it
[19:37] wasn't straight roads it was up up and
[19:39] down and curves oh lord help us you know
[19:42] so we got to looking at this tonight and
[19:47] you know it was just kind of testing the
[19:48] roads on her way in and so you know we
[19:52] just we do the best we can do you know
[19:54] with it and um at the time I had got a
[19:56] text cuz I was just so looking over
[19:58] things and by the time I got a text
[20:01] there's no way we could make a call to
[20:03] everybody and do all of that either so
[20:05] you're not disappointed are you okay
[20:09] well I figure if we have to go Turtles
[20:12] pace on the way home I guess we'll do it
[20:13] but it's good to be in the house of the
[20:16] Lord amen and I I didn't expect those
[20:19] who live a distance away I'm glad they
[20:21] didn't try to make it so let's just look
[20:25] in the word and let's have a little bit
[20:26] of a study here tonight in Romans 5
[20:29] verse 1 therefore being justified by
[20:32] faith we have peace with God through our
[20:35] Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have
[20:39] access by faith into this grace wherein
[20:42] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[20:46] glory of God and not only so but we
[20:48] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[20:53] tribulation worketh patience and they
[20:57] say lord help me help me to mature in
[21:01] this and patience experience and
[21:05] experience
[21:08] oh and hope maketh not ashamed because
[21:11] the love of God is shed abroad in our
[21:14] hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given
[21:17] unto us amen may God bless you and bless
[21:21] as what as you're being seated I think
[21:26] that that's something that within our
[21:27] lives as we've been looking at this with
[21:29] tests and trials that we all desire to
[21:33] be pleasing to the Lord and and that the
[21:36] Lord would would help us that when even
[21:39] in looking at tests and trials that
[21:41] we're we're able to look at him not in a
[21:45] measure because we'll never come to a
[21:46] place of being an autopilot and what I
[21:49] mean by autopilot is we're that we
[21:51] something just switches on and we say oh
[21:53] this is a test or trial and know it
[21:56] affects there's a part of us that really
[21:58] feels the effects of it there's two
[22:00] realms of us that really feels the
[22:02] effects of a test or trial and you're
[22:04] never gonna get beyond that our flesh
[22:06] our spirit that part of spirits
[22:08] connected to the mind all of that it
[22:10] feels the effect of it but I believe
[22:13] that the greatness of God moving within
[22:15] our lives is also bringing out of our
[22:18] lives for even what he knows
[22:20] awaits us whether tomorrow whether the
[22:22] next week whether the next month the
[22:24] year God is working all things out after
[22:27] the counsel of his own will and so when
[22:30] we're looking at this the the scriptures
[22:32] as it said that it's knowing this how do
[22:36] we glory in tribulations because we know
[22:38] that tribulation worketh patience and we
[22:41] see how patience it from patience
[22:43] there's an experience and from
[22:45] experience there's there's hope and hope
[22:48] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[22:50] God is shed abroad in our hearts by the
[22:52] Holy Ghost which is given unto us you
[22:55] know the experience is every one of us
[22:57] that things that we have come through
[22:59] the tests and trials down through the
[23:01] pathways of life wherever and however
[23:04] long that we have been serving the Lord
[23:06] those tests and trials in our lives have
[23:10] worked patience and from that patience
[23:13] it's worked experiences in our life
[23:16] sometimes you might look at the
[23:18] experience in your life and it may not
[23:20] even though I'm not going to say that
[23:21] we don't say it's not great but
[23:23] sometimes you just don't understand
[23:25] sometimes the great impact that an
[23:28] experience can have on someone the
[23:30] experience that God would bring you
[23:32] through and me through or someone else
[23:34] in here and that experience is not just
[23:37] for our molding or making but where that
[23:39] we're able to pull it next to somebody
[23:41] else and say hang in there sister God is
[23:44] faithful hang in there my brother of God
[23:46] is faithful I've been there I've been
[23:48] there maybe not the exact exact specs of
[23:53] the tester trial but to know that God is
[23:55] faithful I've been maybe it's a
[23:57] situation about a job maybe it's a
[23:59] situation about a loved one and may not
[24:01] be the same degree but we do know that
[24:03] God is still God and that experience
[24:05] that testimony your life and I believe
[24:07] that God not just as God use his word
[24:10] the Bible tells us that we receive
[24:12] patient and comfort from the Scriptures
[24:15] and that gives us hope you see the
[24:18] Spirit of God is able to direct us and I
[24:20] believe this with all my heart into the
[24:22] word into the message and looking at
[24:24] these things that sometimes what we're
[24:26] going through or what we will come
[24:28] through you'll find that how the Spirit
[24:30] of God will direct you right into
[24:31] something that where you'll just
[24:33] encourage you with a word and I I've
[24:35] told you that many times before it's not
[24:37] just things that I've read sometimes but
[24:38] even through some of the greatest tests
[24:40] and trials I'll hear you know brother
[24:42] branham's voice come right through my
[24:44] mind right through my heart now hear him
[24:46] saying this particular phrase in the
[24:48] message and it'll come back to me I said
[24:50] thank you Lord because I I know that
[24:52] that's the Lord bringing it back to me
[24:53] and and I'm thankful for that because
[24:55] the Bible said it is the Spirit of Truth
[24:57] and he'll lead and guide us into all
[24:59] truth and bring those things back to our
[25:01] remembrance what we have need of and
[25:03] sometimes you know when we're we're
[25:05] looking for things and we may not have
[25:07] the the answer for it sometimes we're
[25:09] may be searching for a scripture or
[25:10] searching for something maybe a Lord
[25:13] when we're looking in the message and we
[25:14] don't seem like that we're finding maybe
[25:16] something that's pinned right down but
[25:18] God in the midst of it all we know that
[25:20] he's got it in control and what I want
[25:23] to just kind of just look at it just
[25:24] seems tonight what's pressing on my
[25:26] heart and just for a few moments is that
[25:28] when we look at this there's a hope and
[25:30] a hope itself there's an expectation
[25:32] that moves in our life and then we can
[25:34] have
[25:35] an expectation because of what of what
[25:38] God has done in our life and there's a
[25:40] patient's and the patient's has moved
[25:42] and experienced and spirits experience
[25:44] itself it brings forth hope none of
[25:47] these things right here are given or
[25:49] handed to us but this is all part of the
[25:52] molding and the shaping of our character
[25:55] and our hope maketh not ashamed now I'm
[25:57] not going to ask you tonight but how
[25:59] many of us have expected things to turn
[26:02] out a certain way and it did we expected
[26:07] it that's hope that's what this word is
[26:09] it's an expectation brother brems said
[26:11] it like this and the message even to
[26:13] wear that when himself he says he's
[26:15] broken my heart he's talking to the Lord
[26:17] he said you've broken my heart many
[26:19] times over and over again but I love you
[26:23] for it
[26:24] so the breaking of the heart was that
[26:27] maybe the expectation of what certain
[26:30] things that this would happen this way
[26:31] or this would come out this way or this
[26:34] would happen and it didn't happen that
[26:35] way perhaps even when a person
[26:37] themselves has been prayed for and God
[26:39] drops in their heart of that there is a
[26:42] healing within their body now we
[26:44] understand that it's faith to bring that
[26:46] about but the expectation itself of how
[26:48] that it's going to be that is
[26:50] sovereignly reserved to God even the
[26:53] timing of it to a believer once it drops
[26:55] that's it it doesn't matter it might
[26:58] come tomorrow it might come the next
[26:59] moment might not it doesn't matter it's
[27:01] that's a seed and the faith of Abraham
[27:04] it simply is that God has already said
[27:08] it and God will fulfill it and he gives
[27:11] us the strength to be able to hold on
[27:14] and to maintain in that promise and you
[27:16] know as God continues to give us his
[27:18] strength there's a dissolving of our
[27:20] strength and we're so thankful for that
[27:23] that's what we want in our lives and and
[27:25] I look at that how many times that we've
[27:27] had disappointments in our life we've
[27:29] had things to where that we wanted
[27:31] something to go in a certain way and it
[27:33] didn't and we've had certain
[27:35] expectations but yet thank God for the
[27:38] love of God when it's shed abroad in our
[27:40] hearts it holds us in the midst of it
[27:41] because no doubt within families and
[27:44] marriages and and all across even within
[27:46] a church sometimes
[27:47] disappointments there's there's a
[27:49] there's things that we are our
[27:51] expectations are not maybe where we want
[27:54] them to be but yet what holds us and
[27:56] what keeps us in the midst of it is it
[27:58] because our expectations are met or our
[28:00] disappointments or or what we're wanting
[28:03] no it's it's the love of God that that's
[28:05] what holds us and that's what keeps us
[28:07] in the midst of everything that's a real
[28:10] love because truly we're gonna
[28:12] experience disappointments and the
[28:14] reality is it's not that God himself
[28:16] wants to disappoint you and I but the
[28:19] truth of the matter is it's not God ever
[28:21] making a promise and then he pulls it
[28:23] back around from you and I and says no
[28:25] I'm not gonna do it that way no God
[28:27] makes his promise and how that that
[28:30] promise is fulfilled is left up to him
[28:34] now I want to read to hear a little
[28:36] statement out of the out of the message
[28:38] the Messiah and brother brems referring
[28:41] to the stats cliff family and I just
[28:44] want to read this to you how brother
[28:45] Branham would would speak concerning
[28:47] this a moment in their life what a
[28:50] trying time when the little baby was
[28:52] passing away and I and I look at this
[28:55] brother em says here's the little mother
[28:56] that's standing here her baby had died
[28:59] over in Germany and her husband's a
[29:01] chaplain they called up long distance
[29:03] about five times through a day and night
[29:05] to ask me to come said they know that
[29:08] God would raise that little baby up I
[29:10] said let me go pray and and I went and a
[29:13] prayed that afternoon that night and
[29:15] I'll show you brother band goes on to
[29:17] talk about how the doctors they believed
[29:19] it and they read the book prophet visits
[29:21] visits Africa and then the little mother
[29:24] in the next paragraph she said God will
[29:26] raise the baby up and see what faith her
[29:29] faith was God will raise the baby up
[29:31] the doctors read the book prophet visit
[29:34] South Africa he said the baby had been
[29:36] dead before they noted about four or
[29:38] five hours so they got the father word
[29:40] down to the base where he was and the
[29:43] baby had been dead died in the night and
[29:45] so the doctor said all right I'll tell
[29:47] you what I'll do
[29:47] I'll slip over and turn the oxygen back
[29:50] on and he let the baby lay there for two
[29:52] days with the oxygen turned on waiting
[29:54] and I was over here praying they was
[29:57] going to fly me across with a jet I
[29:59] could leave here
[30:00] an army jet and be back the same day to
[30:02] Germany now I want you to catch this
[30:04] they have faith that God will raise the
[30:08] baby up the doctor has read the book
[30:10] prophet visits Africa and the doctor is
[30:14] convinced but what he's read and he goes
[30:17] in and turns on the oxygen it says we're
[30:20] gonna leave this oxygen and on until he
[30:22] gets here
[30:23] the doctors convinced so what I'm trying
[30:26] to say there is nothing where you'd like
[30:29] the Lord Jesus remember when he came to
[30:31] gyruss is Houston the others he had to
[30:33] put them out where there wasn't any
[30:35] belief there's no such thing here all
[30:38] are in agreeance with this and belief so
[30:42] what we would look at it say that's the
[30:44] conditions that are met they're all
[30:46] believing I mean here is a tragedy
[30:49] that's happened here where this baby has
[30:52] already died we would look at and say
[30:54] the the parents have faith the doctor
[30:57] has faith to where he would go in and
[30:58] turn the oxygen supply those conditions
[31:00] are met is that right the scripture you
[31:04] know the scriptures are clear God
[31:05] respects faith anytime where faith is
[31:08] many times out you know brother Rambo
[31:10] tell us he said that how people were you
[31:12] know would go rub a poster they would go
[31:14] do this or how they even touch the
[31:16] Beatles and he said many times he said
[31:18] what it is he said God honors faith and
[31:20] then people believe they're touching God
[31:22] but look what's this situation that's
[31:26] here one morning he says about daylight
[31:29] I got up and the wife went out of the
[31:30] room and she went out of the room
[31:32] I just waked up and I'm laying there a
[31:35] bit directly I heard something coming
[31:37] into the room and had looked and there
[31:39] was something moving in the room and I
[31:41] jumped up and I said Lord what would you
[31:44] have your servant know he said do not
[31:46] rebuke that that's the hand of the Lord
[31:50] so I got her on the phone
[31:52] imagine making this phone call yeah I've
[31:56] thought about that many times imagine
[31:58] making this phone call
[31:59] I said no God has called your baby and
[32:07] so when she come over to see us he left
[32:10] at the house when I left yesterday she
[32:12] said what was it brother branham
[32:14] my weakness of faith I said you have
[32:17] great faith you pray for your baby
[32:20] you and your husband held on to it God
[32:23] raised that baby and he refused to do it
[32:25] because he knows what's best and still
[32:29] you love him
[32:31] that's real faith many times just take
[32:40] that phrase and search it through the
[32:41] message that's real faith you'll hear
[32:43] you'll see that same phrase used about
[32:47] three other times where brother Ram is
[32:49] talking about with people whose faith
[32:50] has rose to a place to receive their
[32:52] healing but you see there's another
[32:54] aspect of faith faith isn't always that
[32:56] I get what I'm Reese what I'm praying
[32:59] about that's not faith you see there's
[33:03] many times we want certain things and
[33:05] we're praying about it maybe we pray
[33:07] today we pray a week pray a month pray a
[33:08] year pray and pray and pray and we're
[33:10] keeping on and we're praying and we're
[33:12] not we seem like we're not getting any
[33:14] answer does that mean that we stop
[33:16] praying no don't keep praying until you
[33:18] have an answer from God either way keep
[33:21] trusting him keep committing it into his
[33:24] hands but if God himself in any of this
[33:27] case would would choose to say no and he
[33:30] doesn't say no because he doesn't have a
[33:33] heart think about it this is a mother's
[33:35] child I mean you know when I think of
[33:39] just as imposter how many times that
[33:41] I've prayed here how many times in other
[33:43] places I've been and prayed with mothers
[33:45] and dads that where their children have
[33:47] went wayward or or certain things that's
[33:49] come up that's a father's heart a
[33:51] mother's heart is for their child even
[33:54] when they're going through things but to
[33:56] look in the midst of this not only do I
[33:58] look at how that brother branham had to
[34:00] make the phone call and handle this and
[34:02] I don't want to make this you know talk
[34:04] about it a lot but I want you to
[34:06] understand something right here that
[34:07] brother Branham himself he has this gift
[34:10] within his life God has given this it's
[34:13] not just a gift but here he stands as a
[34:15] prophet of God he has the authority I
[34:18] may say to you like this he had the
[34:20] authority if he would have prayed for
[34:22] that baby God would have honored the
[34:23] prayer God would have honored it God
[34:26] would have raised it up that
[34:28] the difference friends there is a faith
[34:31] that is there that house if he himself
[34:34] that's why brother brems says you want
[34:35] to watch he said that with that gift
[34:38] what a person would do and see God God
[34:40] could trust where the Prophet himself
[34:42] God could trust it now listen that's an
[34:44] example even to you and I that you and I
[34:47] would be in a place to say Lord let me
[34:49] be reso reserved that I'm not anxious to
[34:53] do something but if there's any
[34:56] anxiousness let me be anxious to be
[34:58] yielded to where to where I'm just as
[35:03] much at peace if he says yes or if he
[35:06] says no see it isn't the magnitude that
[35:09] God would use us it's just simply enough
[35:13] to know that we are reserved to him
[35:15] that's that's the blessing that we're
[35:18] here so notice he says I got her on the
[35:21] phone let me I'm sorry I already read
[35:23] that he said you've got a great faith
[35:25] you pray for your baby you and your
[35:27] husband held on to it God raised that
[35:29] baby and he refused to do it because he
[35:31] knows what's best and still you love him
[35:34] that's real faith I believe with all my
[35:36] heart that these experiences within it
[35:38] that when we get to the other side and
[35:40] we and we meet up with the stats cliff
[35:42] family we're going to be able to shake
[35:44] their hands and say thank you that God
[35:47] did you allow the experience in your
[35:49] life to bring strength to me you allowed
[35:53] an experience for a part of the word to
[35:56] be taught by experience that real faith
[35:59] is not me getting or everything is
[36:02] answered just like I pray for it but
[36:04] real faith is trusting him even when the
[36:09] answer does not come how I wanted to
[36:13] come disappointed you think she wasn't
[36:17] disappointed sure they were sure they
[36:20] were it wasn't that they no doubt the
[36:23] stance flips were walking around I'm
[36:24] gonna read you a moment I'm gonna read
[36:26] you another part in here of where there
[36:28] is the condolences that brother Branham
[36:29] actually personally gives to the stats
[36:32] cuz I ran across this the actual
[36:34] personal condolences of where he himself
[36:36] is trying to help them to understand
[36:38] even what he himself doesn't understand
[36:41] that's real faith then their hearts
[36:45] there's no doubt they're disappointed
[36:47] but do they love the Lord absolutely
[36:51] so you mean that because their baby
[36:53] wasn't raised up that that that that
[36:56] they they they didn't have faith no they
[36:58] had real faith real faith is standing
[37:04] look what brother Bremen goes on to say
[37:06] look at this teaching moment anybody
[37:11] anybody when mountains are moving and
[37:14] things can have faith but let it go
[37:18] backwards one time and see how it works
[37:22] anybody can have faith when mountains
[37:24] are moving anybody can have faith when
[37:27] God is so moving
[37:29] through a church but what happens the
[37:32] Prophet says when God allows joy to be
[37:35] pulled back from the church every once
[37:37] in a while what happens to it what
[37:39] happens when it would be like a stream
[37:42] somehow that stream would would seem to
[37:44] kind of trickle and we have to dig a
[37:46] little bit what happens when the swim
[37:48] ever after were digging for a while that
[37:50] we have to depend on do because God did
[37:53] not just to provide one way to water the
[37:55] land he provided dude that was the
[37:58] promised to Jacob that year to do if
[38:01] Heaven belongs to you do the streams the
[38:07] fountains all of the wells all of us but
[38:10] sometimes there's times in our life
[38:11] where there's a testing that comes on
[38:14] what are we gonna do it's easy anybody
[38:18] can have faith when mountains are moving
[38:20] and things can have faith but let it go
[38:22] backwards one time and see how it works
[38:25] that's when you prove whether you've got
[38:27] faith or not now I'm not talking about
[38:31] your feelings I'm talking about an
[38:34] anchor because then your feelings in
[38:36] your spirit your spirit might be so so
[38:41] moving back and forth but within you
[38:43] there's something holding not you
[38:47] holding on he is holding you
[38:53] every Sun that cometh to God must be
[38:57] chastened and tried of God so remember
[38:59] our trials works patience and patience
[39:03] works hope and so forth so we just hold
[39:07] on to God whether he blesses us or not
[39:11] we are right there to believe him anyhow
[39:13] cuz he promised it we just hold on to
[39:19] God whether he blesses us or not
[39:23] are serving and our our faithfulness
[39:26] that I said once again that even in how
[39:30] that we respond even and how the in our
[39:33] our daily walk and even how that you
[39:36] know it's easy it's easy to come to
[39:38] church when you feel like you're on
[39:39] cloud nine it's easy when everything is
[39:42] going good it's difficult when you don't
[39:46] feel but seven you always feel that's
[39:51] what you think I don't always feel like
[39:54] preaching I don't always feel like
[39:57] taking different meetings that I'm asked
[39:59] and I pray about it and I actually try
[40:01] to move it away but then God will drop
[40:03] it right in I don't always feel like it
[40:07] and even within that but you know what
[40:09] within the midst of it what I can say
[40:11] the same as you God gives grace God
[40:15] gives strength to you and I hallelujah
[40:19] glory whether he blesses or not that's
[40:21] that's not what it's about
[40:23] it's holding on to him see this is a
[40:26] hope that makers not ashamed if it
[40:29] doesn't happen the way that maybe I
[40:31] thought it's going to happen I'm under
[40:33] the love of God it's still abroad
[40:34] in my heart it's an anchor that's the
[40:37] love of God he'll make known all those
[40:40] things in his time because there is one
[40:44] expectation that we have that I will not
[40:47] be ashamed of we've already received a
[40:50] down pile a down payment and a deposit
[40:53] of that we are expecting the rapture
[40:58] we're expecting whether we go by the way
[41:01] of the grave or whether we remain we are
[41:04] expecting
[41:05] complete deliverance that is a true true
[41:10] expectation in this condolences to the
[41:13] stats close family I put this I put this
[41:18] the link the hyperlink as below on this
[41:20] right here because a pastor had posted
[41:21] this on a collection of things I'm with
[41:23] and and I asked the brother I said my
[41:26] just you know I'm studying on some of
[41:28] these things where did you find this
[41:29] from but it's actually an in a pre mood
[41:32] to a message but I wasn't able to find
[41:35] it but I was able to pull it from this
[41:36] from this resource where brother ramus
[41:38] is ministering here he says he's
[41:41] speaking to the stats cliff family I
[41:43] hope I included this yes he said it
[41:46] wasn't something that Satan slipped up
[41:50] on you
[41:51] it was the planning program of God no
[41:53] he's talking talking specifically to
[41:55] brother and sister statically this is
[41:58] the condolences brother and sister
[42:00] stance cliff how can I make you see that
[42:03] now no more than I could when I went in
[42:06] the room there to play pray for a little
[42:08] Sharon and God refused to hear me see
[42:10] brother branham he's not even in the
[42:12] place to where that he's gonna make to
[42:14] be able to make them see you can't
[42:17] there's not things that where brother
[42:20] Ram himself understands he's not going
[42:22] to be able to make them see and
[42:23] understand if you can see and understand
[42:26] there's no need to trust but you have to
[42:30] trust with things you don't understand
[42:33] when things don't make sense
[42:35] you trust see that's in the midst of it
[42:38] all look you know how it is sometimes
[42:39] you can have so many many things coming
[42:42] around about building bridges and your
[42:44] this or that you find yourself if you're
[42:46] not careful somebody took your blood
[42:47] pressure if they took your pulse at that
[42:49] time and all of a sudden you find your
[42:51] some of them I said wait a minute wait
[42:52] wait wait wait wait well that's not up
[42:54] to me that's not up to me it's in his
[42:59] hands and you're fine right there if you
[43:02] could have your pulse taken at that time
[43:03] you find it going down why because it's
[43:08] a trust saying you know Lord you've got
[43:10] my life in your hands
[43:11] Oh watch this he says
[43:15] I couldn't understand then how that
[43:18] would be his program he taken a little
[43:20] sharing in those I couldn't understand
[43:22] how that would be his program right did
[43:29] brother branham standing loyal in the
[43:30] midst at that time yes he did yes he did
[43:34] what's his sports was his spirit
[43:37] affected yes it was he took the glove
[43:40] off and said when he was on the pair on
[43:43] power line I'm coming to join you is
[43:46] that right
[43:47] see the outer part was affected with
[43:51] that in sorrow but in Lotus he says I
[43:54] couldn't understand that that then how
[43:58] that would be his program but look now
[43:59] what is know what's happening but look
[44:02] what that little story has done it
[44:04] brought thousands to Christ so an
[44:08] experience that was there in his own
[44:12] life that's brought thousands to Christ
[44:15] what was it that brought him to Christ
[44:17] wasn't little sharing was it was it was
[44:20] it hope his wife it was the experience
[44:22] of a living Christ that there is an
[44:25] anchor there is a living God who holds
[44:28] you in the midst of your tests and
[44:31] trials let me tell you something when he
[44:33] was preaching to the Pentecostals the
[44:35] Pentecostals had already seen miracles
[44:38] come on somebody they had already seen
[44:41] that but it was an anchor it was of a
[44:43] living Christ remember even where that
[44:45] man that he hunted with Bert is that
[44:48] right Bert no doubt look at things what
[44:51] Bert had seen with in religions and and
[44:53] seen a lot of things had seen a lot of
[44:54] no doubt signs and miracles and a lot of
[44:57] those things we're not casting those
[44:58] things aside but friends let me tell you
[45:00] if that's where our anchor is that we
[45:02] are missing the mark of the high calling
[45:04] of Jesus Christ it is on a life that is
[45:08] anchored in him
[45:09] the Bible says signs and wonders follow
[45:11] them that believe I'm going to tell you
[45:13] one of the greatest signs and one of the
[45:15] greatest wonders is that transformation
[45:17] by the new birth and to see a life that
[45:20] remains solid and steadfast and looking
[45:24] to the coming of the Lord
[45:25] then no matter what comes or go sure we
[45:28] have our times
[45:29] terms are down as far as within our
[45:31] spirit but yet in the midst of it all
[45:34] there's no question you're a believer no
[45:38] question where you're standing and who
[45:41] you're in love with
[45:43] hallelujah we're not in love with an
[45:45] attribute we're in love with a person
[45:49] they're right you can get along with
[45:52] attributes of people right on your job
[45:55] there's people you like working with but
[45:58] lord have mercy don't bring him home no
[46:01] no but see we're not in love with an
[46:04] attribute of God we're in love with him
[46:07] and all that he is he's just not all
[46:12] grace
[46:13] he's justice he's a deliverer his
[46:17] judgment all those things all are
[46:20] wonderful attributes of God a few weeks
[46:24] ago brother bream says I was coming down
[46:26] off of a hillside where I went up one
[46:27] afternoon in the woods to hunt and I was
[46:29] setting up on the hillside thinking of
[46:31] the time when I was a little boy and
[46:33] used to squirrel hunt and I thought well
[46:35] things has changed a lot since then but
[46:37] look at the sorrow if you'd go through
[46:41] that would you do it again if you had to
[46:44] go back over your life I said yes I
[46:47] would first I said I don't believe I
[46:52] would because I'd have to go through the
[46:55] sorrow of seeing hope my first wife go
[46:58] and little Sharon and them and then
[47:02] something said but look at the thousands
[47:06] of souls that's been saved I said God
[47:09] yes I'd go through it again anything for
[47:12] your kingdom it's worth it all to be his
[47:16] child to serve Him
[47:18] through the last long mile would you go
[47:23] through it again
[47:24] if first he said no I wouldn't why the
[47:27] sorrow the sorrow that he had to
[47:29] experience but something said consider
[47:32] the thousands of souls that's been saved
[47:35] you see friends our testimonies our
[47:37] trials
[47:39] how that God is molding and shaping us
[47:42] but it's not just us these testimonies
[47:46] look it down through the Scriptures all
[47:48] of those down through the scriptures
[47:50] where they themselves
[47:52] you take Shadrach you take the Hebrew
[47:54] children just to save time you take them
[47:56] these are testimonies not just something
[47:58] that's written but if parts of the
[48:01] scripture for you and I to receive
[48:03] comfort from they didn't know they
[48:07] didn't have a word from God when they
[48:08] stood there they didn't have a word from
[48:10] God even as they're walking up the
[48:12] stairs they didn't have a word from God
[48:14] even when they were being thrust into
[48:17] the furnace but he met him there they
[48:20] stood faithful loyal in the midst of
[48:25] every time so our loyalty is not about
[48:28] I'm getting answers I'm getting
[48:30] connection I'm hearing him my prayers do
[48:32] not feel like they're going off of
[48:33] they're off the ceiling and ricocheting
[48:35] back that's that's not what it is our
[48:37] loyalty is is that he is faithful
[48:41] there's not one of us in here that
[48:44] haven't prayed and you felt like your
[48:46] prayers was coming right back off the
[48:47] ceiling there ain't one of us in here
[48:49] that's prayed about certain things that
[48:51] you felt like he ain't hearing me and
[48:54] there's been that test that's come to
[48:56] you because you don't feel maybe it's a
[48:58] time where here you are praying and you
[49:00] don't feel him you hadn't heard from him
[49:06] what we do in the midst of that time we
[49:08] trust we can go back and take comfort
[49:12] from the scripture when it came to
[49:14] Daniel and said from the first day from
[49:17] the first time you prayed I heard your
[49:20] prayer it made it to heaven it made it
[49:24] through everything else it made it there
[49:26] see let me let me just let me just drop
[49:29] these few things in here the scripture
[49:32] speaks to us here concerning of how that
[49:36] this trying of our faith and how that
[49:38] it's working patience and notice how it
[49:43] says here in James the trying of your
[49:44] faith worketh patience but let patience
[49:47] have her perfect work
[49:50] I was so struck I'm so struck by this
[49:53] there's the scripture let patience so
[49:57] it's not just a given its let it you can
[50:02] be pulled many way but let patience have
[50:04] not his but her perfect work
[50:09] God chose moving by inspiration that it
[50:13] would display that of patience one
[50:16] that's timid one that would be like a a
[50:19] weaker vessel one that would come forth
[50:22] its submission in the midst of these
[50:26] times that you may be perfect and entire
[50:31] wanting nothing you know brother branham
[50:38] he tells us when we're looking at that
[50:40] in the statue of a perfect man we
[50:44] understand that we must be born of the
[50:48] incorruptible Word of God we are born we
[50:52] are born of the gospel of our salvation
[50:55] birthed into that part that God has
[50:58] ordained for our life but in that
[51:01] growing of our life it all starts from a
[51:05] new birth but then we grow into a full
[51:09] stature of a son and daughter of God
[51:12] we're not born in full stature we grow
[51:16] unto all that is within us every part
[51:21] and remember thinking how that all of
[51:23] this together every leaf every apple
[51:27] every stem everything that will be on
[51:30] that apple tree every bushel of apples
[51:33] all of it is representative represented
[51:36] in that germ of life in the seed the
[51:40] only thing that has to happen is is the
[51:42] quickening power comes up on it
[51:45] to give it the authority to become what
[51:48] God has spoken and so we see that how
[51:53] that if faith work if the scripture said
[51:56] faith worketh patience but M says if
[52:00] you've got faith then you'll
[52:04] of patience you see it works out in our
[52:07] left do is it is it something to where
[52:11] that we come to a place and all of a
[52:13] sudden well I'm done with patience here
[52:15] today and you know after patients know
[52:17] its continuum it's not it's not that way
[52:21] of thinking that well because what
[52:24] you're gonna find yourself doing when
[52:25] just looking at that you'll find
[52:27] yourself up and down up and down up it's
[52:30] not that it's a maturing and God brings
[52:34] forth all of the fullness of the virtue
[52:37] according to the light that's given in
[52:39] the hour and season of his word yet God
[52:43] is faithful to perform his word so here
[52:46] when we look at this and and I'm
[52:48] watching the time I've got just a few
[52:51] more moments here let me read this to
[52:54] you out of the flat tire of church age
[52:58] it's very it was very very beautiful
[53:01] here here here we find in this age it
[53:08] seems how that God is the onlooker he
[53:12] knows what's going on you sees
[53:16] everything
[53:17] when Robert libram says to the untutored
[53:20] mind they they can't understand how that
[53:23] when his people are in trouble how that
[53:25] we're in there in this condition how can
[53:28] he not just give in and lavish
[53:31] everything upon them see that would be
[53:35] the thought but if that can but but
[53:38] that's not God's Way of bringing forth
[53:40] out of our life you believe he's working
[53:47] notice brother M says in a fat tire age
[53:50] he said now faithfulness and patience go
[53:54] together
[53:55] in fact patience is the outcome of
[53:59] faithfulness for it says in James 1 3
[54:03] the trying of your faith worketh
[54:05] patience there is absolutely no other
[54:08] way in which to gain patience it has to
[54:12] come by the trial of our faith Lord I
[54:16] need
[54:17] patience so interpreting that is lord I
[54:22] need trials right but we probably don't
[54:26] say you know lord I need patience but I
[54:29] will be I believe every one of us I
[54:31] believe that we can say lord help me to
[54:33] wait because we see even within
[54:37] ourselves on certain things where we've
[54:39] hasty it helped me to wait Lord you know
[54:45] friends even even when God is working
[54:47] and sometimes here we are we can build
[54:50] all kinds of bridges I know I'm not just
[54:52] preaching to me tonight we can have all
[54:54] this but then as it comes that place we
[54:56] realized wait a minute what am i doing
[54:58] and you know what you've built a bridge
[55:01] and yeah you come to a place and it was
[55:03] not even necessary
[55:06] all it was was us getting under the
[55:09] plate you know what that is
[55:10] that steal us and God is still letting
[55:13] us know the stream of life got to dry up
[55:17] he had to let he had to let Abraham get
[55:21] completely dead all right
[55:23] and God knows what he's doing in working
[55:27] in our lives there is absolutely no
[55:29] other way in which to gain patience it
[55:31] has to come by the trial of our faith so
[55:34] you mean I can't gain patience just by
[55:36] coming and listening to the word no you
[55:39] mean I can't gain patience just by
[55:40] praying no you mean I can't get patience
[55:43] just by reading and study no patience
[55:47] can only come by the trial patients
[55:53] experience experience well where the RAM
[55:55] refers that scripture Romans 5
[55:57] tribulation worketh patience how highly
[55:59] God regards this out working of our
[56:02] patience that's a powerful statement how
[56:05] highly God regards this out working of
[56:08] our patience and it refers to James 1:4
[56:10] and that patients have our perfect work
[56:12] that you may be perfect and entire
[56:13] lacking nothing God's will for us is
[56:18] perfection and that perfection is
[56:22] patience waiting on God and waiting
[56:29] for God that's the perfection that the
[56:33] molding of our character this is the
[56:37] process of character development when
[56:43] you think of this waiting this is God's
[56:46] desire for perfection is this patience
[56:50] waiting on God waiting for God remember
[56:55] the message is brother read and preached
[56:56] trial court trial a trial d trial to me
[57:01] where I as I'm listening to those
[57:03] message I think what how God so
[57:06] profoundly took us in this hour to come
[57:08] out and to address these things of mr.
[57:11] skeptic mr. impatient all these are the
[57:13] things and you know what God allowed
[57:15] even in Abraham's life God allowed the
[57:18] promise it was the promise was as sure
[57:21] as when God had it in his mind that
[57:25] promise was was sure but God allowed all
[57:28] of those things allowed the time to go
[57:30] on but in the midst of it all it was a
[57:34] trying it was a testing into the midst
[57:37] of it Abraham his patience grew it grew
[57:42] it grew to such a place - here he takes
[57:46] Isaac one who was given to him from the
[57:49] dead and he walks him up to that
[57:52] mountain I tell you friends that right
[57:54] there what God God already knew what he
[57:56] was going to bring him to to show him
[57:58] that but God didn't require that at the
[58:00] first this is a maturity of his face and
[58:06] God and God brings our faith there's a
[58:08] maturity of our faith even how the
[58:10] Prophet himself how that he continues to
[58:13] put that example of Isaac and Abraham
[58:15] going up to the mountain over and over
[58:17] in the message of Shalom he ties it into
[58:19] that of the rapture he ties it in the
[58:21] patriarch Abraham he says for what God
[58:23] has done within your soul you have
[58:25] confidence that he'll also transform
[58:27] your body and he goes on to tell us even
[58:30] in the wings of a snow white dove he
[58:32] says here he is standing on the mountain
[58:33] that day and he speaks of God revealing
[58:36] his word and he says this revelation has
[58:40] led me to a faith
[58:43] I never had before so here it was a
[58:47] growing in his life so huh well as faith
[58:50] is growing what else is growing patients
[58:53] as patients is growing what else a grunt
[58:55] experience and hope all of that it grows
[59:00] stronger and stronger and stronger you
[59:04] loved him tonight say lord help me keep
[59:09] working Lord in me let me help me Lord I
[59:13] want to be found
[59:14] patient even when I have been and when I
[59:20] am disappointed when things don't go the
[59:24] way that I would want them to go every
[59:27] one of us every one of us in here we
[59:30] always want the pastor
[59:31] path of least resistance that's true we
[59:35] want that but God knows God knows what
[59:38] path to lead us in because he knows what
[59:41] he's bringing out of our lives it's all
[59:43] working what the world might look at
[59:47] different ones on the job and say oh my
[59:49] goodness how I know but you don't know
[59:51] what people are watching in your life
[59:54] they may never read a Bible they may not
[59:58] they even may even proclaim they don't
[1:00:00] believe in the Lord at all but they
[1:00:02] watched the inker in your life and they
[1:00:04] say that's a Christian that's a
[1:00:08] Christian here they are in the midst of
[1:00:11] all that that is going through but there
[1:00:14] is something that within them it holds
[1:00:17] there's an anchor what a greater witness
[1:00:20] and a greater testimony he's faithful
[1:00:23] the anchor points aren't you glad the
[1:00:28] anchor holds in the midst of the storm
[1:00:31] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord as we
[1:00:36] come here Lord to the end of this or the
[1:00:39] little time that we've had together I
[1:00:41] pray that Lord that you'll just take
[1:00:44] your word

[1:01:03] answer Lord even that when it's been
[1:01:05] known when it's been Lord not according
[1:01:09] to how that we were even praying for
[1:01:12] something Lord to take place the Lord
[1:01:16] were thankful the Lord God to know that
[1:01:19] there is a greater within a slore that
[1:01:22] holds us the father that even in the
[1:01:25] midst of the time if our own thinking
[1:01:28] attitude or any part would get out of
[1:01:31] line we're thankful for the love of God
[1:01:34] that shed abroad in a heart supply to
[1:01:37] directing us Lord right back in bringing
[1:01:41] us right in line

[1:01:48] looking at it you did it with Joe Lord

[1:01:53] place Lord it was a little bit of a of
[1:01:56] an attitude Lord and things that Joel
[1:01:58] was having
[1:01:59] but you directed Lord you moved upon the
[1:02:02] scene and you brought forth

[1:02:51] that particular moment in his time he
[1:02:54] didn't understand that it didn't make
[1:02:57] sense and there's no way that that he
[1:02:59] could try to make sense to them of their
[1:03:02] situation but he relayed to them the
