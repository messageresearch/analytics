[Music] an empty place [Music] if not for grace a whole place oh yes not for praise [Music] oh hallelujah amen aren't you thankful for the grace of god and so thankful i always think of that scripture in hebrews 12 speaks to us that everything that can be shaken will be shaken and that's what's taking place there's been a shaking all the way down through the ages paul spoke of it there's always been that every time when god gives a word god gives a message then the testing time comes the time that when that when that part of the bride is uniting with that word then the word itself in flesh is tested in that part of the bride just as it was when the lord jesus went up there and was tempted of the devil and he overcame by the word and we recognize that we're overcoming by the word it's not a word on the outside of us but it's the word of god on the inside of us and we're overcoming by the blood of the lamb by the word of the testimony amen of that same stock of that same caliber oh my how thankful we are for the grace of god tonight amen truly we can't say enough child paul would say let us have grace whereby we may serve him acceptable aren't you glad for grace comes to correct us comes to lift us comes to deal with our life that's grace see the way the world presents grace and the way that most of the churches present grace is it's as though that you can do anything you want to and you know god still loves you but that's not real grace grace comes to deal with our lives even when it came for israel to come up to the promised land remember even the testimony that joshua and caleb brought back was the spirit of grace remember how paul would write about it he would say that those that rejected it they did despite unto the spirit of grace although we we want to receive the spirit of grace we amen it's it's the grace of god that's here making us ready for that great moment amen and i say that moment is upon us we're here we've arrived amen let's just bow our hearts to him in a word of prayer [Music] heavenly father lord we're just so thankful for this opportunity that we have here this evening lord a few moments that we have to just come away in your presence lord we realize that it's more than lord just just coming to a service for the privilege of the believer is that we might live in the presence of god because lord it's your presence accompanying our lives oh god by the holy ghost but it's just something special about it lord when we can come together as paul would write lord in the hebrews that we would forsake not to assemble ourselves together your prophet would tell us lord that when we come together those licks of fire he said it's the godhead bodily among us lord and father there's no telling lord what you will do i just pray tonight lord in this this time that we've gathered here lord i don't believe that anybody has come here lord to take up time because there's a lot of things that lord that maybe would say would be on our plate things that lord that could be very pressing but lord we've come here tonight to have a meeting with you lord dear god we believe that you've arranged it before the foundation of the world and so lord as we come into your presence we want to invite you lord we believe you're here we just want to invite you to come and speak and minister to our lives you know just exactly what we have need of lord father would you just just help me in this congregation all together lord to just be able to step aside now that you could come down among us lord very personally and just speak to our hearts in such a personal way lord may you move for each need that's gathered here lord i heard the prayer requests lord as we've been praying lord for sister linda that god that you'll just continue to move for her lord oh father we recognize lord that there are times where setbacks and things will come but that's not our focus lord our focus is upon that true report lord that has been revealed to us lord and we believe that report lord that it's by your stripes lord that our sister is made whole father lord we stand upon that lord god lord with a full agreement oh god agreement in this hour we just ask the lord may that same angel of the lord just continue to brood lord upon her body lord just setting everything in order oh god just to bring your lord right out of the lord that hospital bed lord into therapy lord i pray that god that you'll strengthen lord every fiber in her muscles o god lord restore if there's any lord that's when to atrophy we ask o god for lord a restoring for we're under lord the power of restoration in this our lord and we believe oh god that lord even now lord that you're moving father lord we pray o god that you'll just move lord for every need those that were spoken and unspoken those upon the hearts of your children lord that are gathered here lord gathered by way of the internet god we just invite you lord that you'll just come lord and have your way very personally lord in our hearts lord we love you and we thank you father once again what a privilege it is lord that we can come together here the seat we love you now lord may you just take control in the name of jesus christ amen and amen amen i'm sure it's good to see you amen uh missed you all on sunday caroline sister nida god bless you my goodness so good to see you amen uh you just uh you're always in my thoughts and in my prayers and when i'm not here but you're not here you're missed amen i certainly certainly love you amen it's just good to be here with you couldn't wait to get here and see you tonight amen we i want to just as we turn to ephesians chapter 3 if you would i want to read a few verses out of there tonight i want to announce to you brother barry had contacted me this morning you know he's over there in poland and he's been going around to a few of those countries and right now during this week and uh we're not gonna he asked if we could just cancel the services and maybe just to we're going to reschedule lord willing at a later date but he's weary right now he's just been going day and night and he's still not back and you just continue to keep him in your prayers as well i wondered if it would be too much we had had it planned out and like i said there was some communication there and then last week we were talking and he just felt you know so let's go ahead and look at it but i didn't know he didn't know either of everything that would take place there in poland there's a lot of pictures and videos that he even has shared with a lot of the different ones of refugees and things that have come from ukraine and so just keep him in prayer as well i don't know exactly the date that he returns i think it might i would imagine it's going to be this week or the first part of next week so just keep him in prayer as well also youth meeting tomorrow evening there at our home at 7 pm certainly look forward to being with the young people and well as we're looking into ephesians 3 and i just want to say thank you for your prayers as well as we were there with jonathan martin and the saints and spoke there on sunday morning and then sunday evening to the young people servants just had just just a wonderful time in the presence of the lord so they just wanted to send their greetings as well so let's let's read here in ephesians 3 verse 1 i don't mean to keep you standing you're probably tired from the day let's read here in verse 1 for this calls i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles notice how paul is recognizing is the purpose i paul the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of god that has given me to you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery as i wrote a four in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit i want you to catch that it's revealed by the spirit that the gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in christ by the gospel whereof i was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of god given unto me by the effectual working of his power unto me who am less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ verse 9 is where i really want to get to and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery so paul's just he spoke about the mystery that was given unto him or that was revealed which was hidden in god and now the holy spirit has revealed that mystery now paul is expressing verse 9 and to make all men see we realize not all men will see but those that are ordained to see will enter in to fellowship with this mystery so and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery so there's there's an anointing paul is announcing there is an anointing of the word of the gospel by the spirit of god to open the eyes of the believer to see this fellowship isn't that tremendous how the holy spirit comes see the word it comes with transforming power and there's a vision behind it to open our understanding and to build faith and to build courage to know what god has for us oh i just love that and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him amen may god bless the word as you're being seated i'd just like to speak to you a few moments we've been looking at communion we've been talk we've been speaking on prayer and i want to just speak here as we've looked at the desire for fellowship and i want to speak this evening on entering entering into fellowship and when we look here within this verse this this is the result of this fellowship this mystery being unfolded and entering into this in fellowship to this mystery it brings about as verse 12 is saying in him we have a courage and a confidence an unreserved approach to god with freedom and without fear see god wants to remove anything and what would be between us and him to have full fellowship and there's no way that we could remove that but god himself made a way by coming down that what that wall that barrier what was between you and i could actually be dealt with but god dealt with it and provided for you and i that you and i can come unto him and come fully into fellowship with him just as adam and eve did in the beginning and so god made this in this way and to think we would have a courage and a confidence because as we've looked at it here even in some of the sundays that god he will make things known to you and i sometimes he'll speak it right out there's other times you'll be listening to a message or you're reading in the scriptures and something will strike your heart right into the service or wherever it might be and as it strikes your heart then you begin to enter into prayer and begin to ask god to come and fulfill that in your life because that's a law of the kingdom that we would ask jesus said ask for the holy ghost and god will give it to you now the only way we can really ask is that we have to have faith that that belongs to us or any other promise of god or whatever it is that god is speaking to us in this time in this hour you and i are not moving into promises or moving into things that where we are presuming but god is making known to you and i just exactly what we need to be praying for in this hour the prophet would call it in this way and i don't have time to preach on this tonight but he would speak of how that prayer is really the radar of the church of the living god he said because when by a radar they don't fly a plane or they don't fly anything by looking out just the windows at site remember that's how a lot of uh of pilots they've crashed into into water because the water is dark and they hadn't really learned to fly by the instruments so god in the god by the holy spirit brings the church into praying by the radar of the holy ghost praying for things that are oncoming events but god is desiring that those things would come to pass in our life now you can bring it down on a personal level you can bring it down and place it as far as a body of believers right here in this local church then bringing it also into the body of jesus christ around the world because there are things that god is pressing upon your heart and my heart to pray for individually in our lives then there are things that god is pressing in our hearts as a congregation to pray for the congregation then there are things also for the body of jesus christ so we we know that there are things that we are praying for and and that's part of god being able to reveal his word to you and i as the prophet called it love secrets where he would speak to you and i lip to here now now don't get in your mind that you know in a way well i haven't heard god speak to me well maybe there's things that god is dealing with or desires to deal with that's hindering him from speaking to you in that way it doesn't mean that you're not a part of the body but it might mean that there are things that you've allowed to come in and get you bogged down and silenced and and tuned and put that voice out from it being the preamble predominant or preeminent voice in your life you say what must i do i recognize that and then identify the very thing that he's calling out as a hindrance in your life it might be unconfessed sin it might be things that you've allowed to creep into your life but there is a blood that is present and you see the blood is not something that was just shed back there before the foundation of the world in the mind of god and then here at calvary but the holy spirit that was in that blood cell is present to bring conviction and deal with our hearts that's how that the blood of jesus christ is still present right here to be able to dismantle sin to be able to deal with our lives and bring us into full fellowship and so when we we think of this that's the great privilege that we have of this of this mystery of god to fellowship with this mystery now don't don't don't let the word mystery get you know way out here like oh my it's something that's ooh and nobody understands no remember it's not man who who who moves into it to understand it but it's god by grace that unfolds to you and i as a matter of fact without the anointing of the holy spirit coming in this age through the word and speaking to you and i you and i would not know where we are at within this scripture you ever ever had anybody calling you and say help me i'm lost and you say where are you i don't know where i'm at what you're really not going to be able to help them at all right because they don't know where they're at but you see when there is an anointing that can come to show you and i where we are at and where we should be then then we can get clarity and the pathway opens of how to get where we should really be so then what was a mystery no longer is a mystery what was confusion and frustration no longer is confusion and frustration it becomes clarity and where there is clarity then faith itself can be let loose into the promises of god that god has for and is calling for in our lives so when we look at this mystery of god paul would write of how that this mystery was revealed to him he would he would it would you know clearly declare this was not something that that that it was learned by a seminary by a theologian this was not something that he learned in a school somewhere paul had a lot of schooling through gamilia but it was remember paul could write in galatians 1 that the same god who separated me from my mother's womb is the same god who taught me this revelation you see god the god's way of teaching is that he himself would come personally and reveal himself to you and i there's a lot of things about it in the word of god and in our life and that that can be mysterious to us or we can have questions about but when he comes on the scene and as we're praying about it remember god will give an unction of things for you to pray about you think in a service like this or a service that comes on sunday if he tarries it ought to be something that as you're praying you are praying and expecting god to come on the scene and speak and minister and answer questions and dissolve doubts we are serving a living god we are not here just to uh just among a group of people and just to come here and play church we are here to have a meeting with god this is a time that that thing wrongs can be made right it's a time where understanding is open it's a time where things that were mysterious become clear to us as believers that's our promises and you have a right to ask god to come and reveal these things to you it belongs to you and i in this hour and that's god's desire as we would ask him so paul paul knows this and he knows that this divine revelation of the holy ghost this mystery of god of the effect because this mystery of god will actually it'll put the people of god right in position right where they need to be and to think if you can just bring it down like this that the real fellowship of the mystery of god it brings us back into a place of an open channel where we are just exactly where we need to be under the blood of jesus christ where god can speak to us at any time let me say it where prayer is not something of a ritual but rather your life has become a channel that's in tune with god where the scripture says pray without ceasing there is a fulfillment going on in your life there is a channel of fellowship that has been open to you and we're not just praying about we heal this one lord touch this one lord but there is a channel that's open where god is revealing his word to you and i in this hour i believe we ought to pray about requests there's many requests that we have but listen we have god speaking lift to hear to us of things right now that pertain what is going on now and what is coming down the road and we should be in prayer we are not and we are not in darkness paul said you are children of the light paul would write i would not have you ignorant who is it that would not have a signature it's god and paul said i realize what's been revealed will will remove ignorance from the children of the living god it's god's light to you and i so when we looked at this this mystery of god is just like the positioning of the children of israel within the land of inheritance that inheritance was already given to them before time is that right when their names was called out as they were being birthed their position was already given to them but they had to come fully into that place of inheritance and it would take joshua it would take that of the holy spirit not the law the letter could not do it it would take the holy spirit you see we can know the letter and the law and it will bring we can see that that there are things that must be lined up but the same holy spirit who gave the law he desires to pack us into position and release to you and i what belongs to us watch how paul would write this in colossians 1 26 even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generations but is now notice but is now made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles notice whom god would make known which is christ in you the hope of glory that's that's the mystery it's christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily so you know when we look at the time that here we are where we are we are standing in this hour this is adoption time this is the time that it speaks in romans 8 that the earth is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god this is why the earth the batching forth of the earthquakes and the volcanoes the earth itself is calling to come back fully under the manifestation or the rulership of the sons and daughters of god you see the earth knows her position oh mine the earth knows she's out of position is that right she's been tilted over but there is a groaning within her to come back in position why she is a redeemable attribute of god that's exactly how it was and it is inside of you it's a longing to come right back into position through the fall we were taken out of position but by the grace of god we are brought back into position in our soul by the baptism of the holy ghost and soon and very soon we will receive a body that matches the experience on the inside brother this lining up does not stop here then on the eternity it only moves forth in our soul to where our bodies now will receive that oncoming straightening where it will not be a bodyborne of man and woman it will be a body he shall call and i will answer oh glory be to god we're right in the time of the adoption of sons or placing of sons but you see brother graham said they've adopted something else and they don't know the mystery of god so what is the mystery of god the mystery of god is the holy ghost now you see when we say it that way and so simple paul would say great is the mystery of godliness and yet it would you we we hear that said so much of the holy ghost and i have the holy ghost and i'm talking about all around us it's it's a common term that you can get among many many other churches and things as well but you see when we paul would write it that they've adopted something else instead of the mystery of god you see because the real mystery of god being revealed it brings us into divine fellowship with god under the blood amen as new creations in christ jesus now notice brother braden would go on in revelations book of symbols and he would talk about he said people don't know the mystery of god they've not been taught the mystery of god the only thing he said that they are being taught is join your turn to church put your name on the book be a good fellow treat your neighbor right can i add to that a little bit just believe god sent a prophet but that's not the mystery of god that's not the mystery of god well just just say i believe the message that's not the mystery of god remember the message is that get into christ the message is a message that says get in christ get under the blood amen the message is that's what it is so notice now they've been taught these other things but he says you know you must know the mystery of god now this is personally that we must know the mystery of god and no man can reveal it to you but the one that had the book the bible said no man can call jesus the christ only by the holy ghost you see only by the holy ghost in your life can you call jesus to christ in other words to say he is the mighty conqueror he is the one that overthrew sin that overthrew the world that overthrew the flesh that overthrew the devil how do you know that because you've had a personal experience with that living lord jesus christ and he is manifesting his glory his power and his authority through your life as a redeemed son and daughter of god that's the great mystery of it because remember the new birth itself is a mystery it's not something that can be explained is that right even as as jesus would speak in john 3 that you know the wind bloweth where it listeth you know that no man know when to come and whether it goes so is everyone that is born of the spirit of god right you then become a paradox a mystery let's just be honest you are a paradox in your own south because you cannot explain but you know that a reality has taken place in your life and what is that that now is entrance of fellowship with the mystery of god oh blessed be his name now notice how he would write that in revelations chapter 1 verse 1. think of this the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant john who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and all things which he saw now now think of this in verse 3 blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand john to the seven churches which are in asia grace be to you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto god and his father to him be glory and dominion forever and ever amen now notice what this revelation of jesus christ as it comes forth the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ it bears witness together in other words a person cannot truly have the real baptism of the holy ghost and their life not being testified of in the word of god because you see this is the spirit of truth it will direct us into the truth the holy ghost will never cause someone to depart from the truth when they depart from the truth that's a sign they never met jesus christ they know about him now remember brother graham said that a good baptist he said a good baptist or a man can take you in the scriptures and twist you around and make you think like you don't know nothing but he said that man has only known him in the flesh but you're not saved by knowing him in the flesh you must know him in the spirit of revelation the holy ghost where god would make himself known now watch how john written under inspiration here this is the announcement remember john was the one that jesus said what it be what what is it to you if this man come if he tarry till i come and remember there was a saying that went out oh you know jesus said this here and this is wrong but what it is they misunderstood he would see the coming of the lord but the coming of the lord remember is that of a secret coming it would be the coming of the holy ghost down through seven gentile ages and it would be capped off here in the seventh in that of the bride coming where the fullness of the holy ghost would come to the body of jesus christ and there would be a uniting of bride and groom together where we're no longer twain but now we have become one you see that's the announcement of the scripture and here john is announcing there that these are not two separate things he's announcing that that this grace and this peace that is coming from the throne of god is that same grace and peace that is being brought by the seven spirits which are before the throne and those seven spirits are messengers of jesus christ and what do they do they bear the message of the covenant oh my god oh blessed be his name you see this is god's mercy oh my my my now when we when we recognize how john remember john heard a voice now don't now don't don't don't don't go to sleep on me john heard a voice and he said i turned around to hear the voice that was speaking to me he turned around to see it he heard it now he wanted to see it because he knows if i heard a voice then somebody is pressing speaking to me and when he turned around to see what he saw was the bible says in verse 13 in the midst of the seven candlesticks was one likened to the son of man notice one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden girl so it was not gird around down here within a priestly way but it was gird around the paps oh my what was it it was christ himself veiled in his bride is that right and what is it it's the power and glory of god that's over her life are you hearing me now because the power and the glory of god that is veiled over her life and you could look and say well why is it there about her perhaps because that's a sign of judgment remember when the word comes forth it is mercy but to spurn it and reject it it's judgment it's not judgment that's coming when you reject it you are judged right there that's why the prophet could say the mark of the beast is not coming it's already here when you turn down the gospel of jesus christ you are marked is that right so notice i turned around to see this voice so this voice would be would be visible before him and notice when i noticed in his right hand were seven stars and out of his mouth went sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand now remember that right hand is that of power glory then in my right hand the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches now let me just pause and come back to that in a moment back in the old testament when we're talking about entering into fellowship because what i just read has a very key point but i want to go back and pick up some background on this which i i know we're familiar with but how it pertains and applies to our lives not just once but over and over again remember when when israel any time that that there in order for them to enter into fellowship they had to enter through the blood there was that of the red heifer that was taken and that red heifer was slain she was slaying there before eliezer or the priest and then she was burned and those those the you know the the ashes they were mixed with clean water and that type of faith what it was to be sprinkled in upon the worshiper a type of the preaching of the gospel it is the waters of separation you see how can a man know he's wrong unless there be a gospel to bring conviction to his life you see that's what the real gospel is it's the blood that is witnessed back there and the holy spirit is bringing conviction here what's he doing he's opening the way or revealing the way into fellowship is that right think about how brother branham would take it in the manner of how many were coming to him even in the time and and you know they remember the one man said you know i went to uh to to to the pentecostals and they said do this and i went to the lutherans and they said do this and this other one said i would when you get happy enough and he said brother brahma i i just want it so bad well remember they told that man you need to go see brother branham he's a prophet now think of this brother braham says you don't need a prophet brother he said you just need to get straightened out here at the beginning and what it was the man already had a genuine experience but you see when others came along they were tampering and trying to put things in the way that was not what god ordained it never brought stability in that man's life but when that man could stand right there before the word and the word could position him in the mystery of god that man jumped off that porch and said praise god i've had it this whole time why it was a reality that struck him in that moment what was it it was the mystery of god that was made known to him oh my and when it's made known like that brother you talking about fellowship you're talking about fellowship now think of this in in this time of how that the blood would be would be shed and that blood remember was to be taken and it was to be sprinkled seven times and there's different places even in the tabernacle of where that would take place even on the day of atonement but these these right here would be the sprinkling of the blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times that's out of numbers chapter 19. now god had made a way let me just refer to a few places he said god had made a way that that that a believer in his journey out of fellowship might have a way of approach again into fellowship now there's a lot that that we could say within that the key is for remaining in fellowship and god provided that way so that man could come back into fellowship you know think about it this is why brother brahma says church doesn't save you but he said church keeps you in fellowship well how does it not save me but it keeps me in fellowship because remember the preaching of the gospel is what brings conviction to a life the preaching of the gospel is what reveals the way into the holiest of holies with a real fellowship and so the preaching of the gospel is set forth to continue to minister to our needs when hindrances arise and when the flesh itself could start to get in the way the waters of separation what is it god's desire for fellowship oh my there's times that you can set and be so cold and you don't know what's going on in your life you're wondering what's happening where have i got off the way why don't i have the joy like i used to have let me tell you something you've got an access you don't have to dwell on it you can say father i desire that you would compress and lord and speak personally to my life why you have a privilege with the waters of separation and you're inviting the holy spirit to come down and deal with your life and if there's things that need to be made right things cleared out of the way there is grace that's present and a blood to see that it's taken care of oh my so the next thing where a person they would enter into the fellowship after coming into the courts with the believers on common ground you see common ground is what's under the blood when the bible says in the book of acts that they had all things in common it's not speaking that well we were just all you know on the same income level or we were all that's not what's speaking of they had all things in common in other words there was one vision one goal one mind and they were under one blood that's the common grounds that god has given for the believer that's where real fellowship takes place is that right someone who's not fully under the blood you can only fellowship so far with them right but thanks god for you know thanks be to god for the level that you're able to fellowship with them in pride and you look and say god help my life to be a light let it be salty let it be something that will encourage and cause a hunger to arise for that greater degree of fellowship is that right don't shame them don't shame them because well you know you're not where i'm at if you'd be doing this that will never remember the waters of separation is not a waters of shaming but the waters of separation is waters that bring conviction do you realize that conviction comes by the sweetness of the holy spirit through the preaching of the word paul said speaking the truth in love is that right and to think that even in how you live your life you can live your life with such sweetness and such power that god will absolutely thunder out of your life and there's conviction that'll strike hearts and lies that you won't even have to say a word to it why there's a voice behind your life that's crying out what is that voice i'm talking about it's the voice of the blood that speaks through your life oh my so the next thing is to enter into on common ground of fellowship and you see there was a public testimony of seven stripes of blood showing that death went before them to pay the weight so this blood was placed before them and that blood was there to identify that there's one who's already made away oh boy i wish i had time to really preach on this there is a blood you see what happens he's identifying that that blood would be placed before the worshiper those seven stripes which would represent seven gentile ages which would represent seven thousand years are you hearing me you're showing that it would be the blood when the blood is presented before it brings a realization oh my no matter what the person could think no matter what types of doubts uh thoughts of doubt and unbelief but if that blood can be presented before them oh my there's a spirit of the living god that'll bring faith within that heart and in that life to recognize that though i am unworthy but there is a worthy one that has made a way that i can come in to this place what do i have to do you must accept god's provided way oh glory be to god notice of how that a public testimony that's blood being with seven stripes was a public testimony to the blood and a public testimony it comes to life everyone would have to enter through every age through that blood and after the entering in through the blood they'd come into fellowship oh my that's the only grounds that that any believer can meet god on is in the blood they're not believing on it but in it to believe in it is to be born again to be a a partaker of that life because the blood was shed not only to put away your past sins but that blood was shed to make a way that you can come right back into the desire and the position of what god ordained you to be as a son and daughter of god the blood made a way for that the church didn't make a way for that the blood of jesus christ made a way for it the churches brought confusion the church has said do this the church said do this but god comes and the anointing of the holy ghost coming through his word upon his children reveals the pathway to life my my where would we be without the holy ghost that's why brother branham could sit there and frankly challenge and say we don't need to understand the greek and the hebrew he said what we need is the same holy ghost who gave the word to come and reveal it because he said it will take more than a student comparing verse to verse to open this book it takes an operation of the holy ghost oh my this is why when john would write in 1st john chapter 1 verse 3 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ now notice what john is writing of that this fellowship is not about you coming and joining a church but this fellowship he's that the invitation is is this fellowship is the same desire of what took place when the morning stars shouted for joy this same fellowship is the same desire that what god had when he would stand there there in the body of the lord jesus and the prayer would be made the last request would desire our fellowship and our companionship that where i am they may be also you see that same thing that was being prayed for are you hearing me now it was radar the prayer was going out intercessory prayer it was radar announcing what is coming to the church in that hour and notice how this is being announced those that are recipients of that fellowship of the mystery of god the holy ghost now that prayer is going out for all them that are afar off as many as the lord our god shall call oh this fellowship is not something that looks at cutting people off you say well well this person just seems to go this way but remember what brings separation is the promise that you and i are holding the promise that we hold to is what leads to separation of others that's what led to abraham and lot being separated because abraham was not going to let go of that promise because that promise had a hold on his life oh my abraham didn't have a full hold on the promise but the promise had a hold of abraham before abraham ever knew about the promise no wonder paul could say i seek to apprehend that which i'm apprehended of oh my oh this glorious revelation that moves down and grips our life and causes us to pray and say lord be it unto me lord come lord jesus do the further work in my life how glorious oh my my mother notice and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message so this is what the message really is which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth so the testimony of fellowship will be that of light it will bear witness with the word of god and the light that god is given in that hour because the light of what is being emitted remember the light itself is that of the word that was god has wrote now become expressed that same word is the blood and it is the life to that hour are you hearing me now if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin so this is the power of coming into the common grounds of fellowship under the blood of jesus christ not only do we have fellowship with one another and what really makes that fellowship is because of the fellowship of the mystery of god of the holy ghost among the believing children of god we we have there is a cleansing that has taken place in our life not just a removing of the past sin but god has come and dealt with the nature on the inside where it has led it to a place of complete death how long that takes for every person and every individual there's got to be a dying out are you with me because the holy ghost is not god coming down cleaning us up and moving on the inside come on now that be adultery because we still got a living husband see god's got to marry a virgin are you hearing me so how does that happen there's got to be a death to that old nature then the quickening power of god comes and rises and raises up that seed on the inside which is the virgin womb of almighty god a creation of the living god god can't marry somebody who's got a living husband and has already been married before but he marries a virgin are you hearing me now oh my that's the scriptures in the message now notice this notice the waters of separation when it's preached now brother if we could just kind of step back a little bit now notice when we're looking at this of these of the blood and of entering into fellowship brother branham would begin to talk about what he is seeing in that hour where there was ministry going on but it was only taking the people as far as the waters of separation in other words to recognize that they are a sinner and they need to accept the pro the perpetuation the provision that jesus christ has made for them and to repent of their sins that's what the waters of separation will do is that right but then brother branham would go on to identify he said but they've got to be taken on into the fellowship of the holy spirit because you see the preaching the waters of separation is necessary it's a necessary uh entrance but it is not the fellowship of the holy spirit so that fellowship of the holy spirit it is that which becomes a real relationship brother brown would say like this relationship he's born again he's a new creature in christ he come through the waters of separation well what if somebody what if it would be you and you heard the preaching of the gospel and you said i don't need to do that to be a christian then then you not even come into the waters of separation because the waters of separation it's what's there to cleanse you and to change your thinking are you hearing me because our thinking was evil we wouldn't even give it a time of day something were to come and you know they hear the word as it's speaking well that's just a little too tight i don't think that needs to be that way you see but the waters of separation is a preparation that god has made that you and i can not only be convicted of our sin but that we can move into a place to where we can actually begin to see the blood before us to enter into that place now think of this and you know in many of the cases now i want you understand this then when we think of this in this hour we're living in in revelations chapter 10 the bible says that mighty angel descended with a little book open in his hand now the little book you know it's this book but the little book speaking of this message is for that of the lamb's book of life you see every message through the seven church ages he that hath an ear it would be speaking to the messenger of that age but there were ordained children of god that would hear that word in that hour and come under the blood is that right but because of the fall that took place in eden then there are many names there's a book of life which is just another section is that right but the lamb's book of life that's there that speaks of the bride of jesus christ a body that's been made up but since the fall had come there's many that live upon the earth that would have never lived on the earth had there not been a fall come is that right and the bible we could read i don't have time to read it but you know the scriptures in john chapter 3 whosoever believeth on him that he might be saved you see it's not a guarantee but those that believe on him not in him on him might be saved you see god has placed it in a way that even those that are not elect that they can be saved not part of the bride but be saved is that right but you see to the bride of jesus christ uh you know friends i'm not lifting people up i'm lifting this word up and this word is flesh in the bride of jesus christ you see it is not just to believe on him but god promised the seal of the holy ghost that there would come a security in the lives of the believer to where they're not wandering and they're up and they're down but they have a confidence so they can fellowship with the mystery of god oh hallelujah oh my think of it like this we walk through the blood of sanctification so there's many that can be in the outer courts they're in the outer courts even friends listen even around our message because you have to enter in first of all through the outer court you see you don't enter in any other way you don't skip the outer court and go straight to the third court but remember jesus said i am the door to the sheepfold right no man coming to the father but by me so though there's a door of an entrance that we enter in and remember as we said i don't know a few services ago when you enter through that door if you can you know in your mind picture that tabernacle picture i had up here when a man enters through that door on the eastern side he's pointed there and he's pointed toward the west is that right because remember there was blood sprinkled eastward oh hallelujah gloria let's just preach here for a moment i know i can't get going on that but you're pointed in the right direction is that right how many times they can sit down with somebody and what little notice even what the message of the hour has come to do is to point us in the right direction and to encourage us into that place of life because many were calling that of the outer court the place of life or calling the holy place the place of life but the only place of life is what is there in the holiest of holies in the bedroom is that all right it's a fellowship you see god provided that way let me just let me just read this here you can read hebrews 10 when you get home hebrews 10 19 through 22 when you get home because god has an objective through that new and living way he's provided for us that we might enter with a true heart full assurance of faith our hearts are sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies are washed with pure water notice to enter into this full fellowship the first thing is the kitchen when you enter into the kitchen that's through hearing the word as we've been saying you hear the word and the word begins to bring conviction to your heart in your life and you open up to accept christ as your personal savior and you begin to feast on the word and enjoy it he said but after you've accepted him and you've been separated what those waters of separation does is it separates you from your evil thinking then the next thing is where you come into the living room so from the kitchen to the living room now notice how brother brand puts this in the living room he says this is where you take the little bride she takes her veil off you're coming a little closer then when you do that you put your arms around her you embrace her and that's how it comes into the fellowship of the lord jesus now notice what he's saying that that of the holy place or the living room or he'll call it the parlor where the veil you know the bride takes her veil off you say what is she doing taking her veil up in other words things that she's holding up she just she just you know taking the veil off right i mean when i went in security checkpoints and stuff when i've been flying you know i could walk up there you know when you'd go in to the uh into the airport but i had to do this you know why because i had to see my face make sure that it matches what's right here on your id where your name is on it and your tickets right there right you see god doesn't take the veils down we've got to take the veils down anything that's between him and us that's what the living room's for to let all letting the veils come down how do the veils come down through his embrace he begins to embrace us well we could really preach some family services right here couldn't we jesus just does not take us and take us straight from the outer court into the holiest of holies you see there is a natural progression to divine fellowship we see it clear back in genesis 1 we see it right here there is a natural progression to fellowship jesus moves no notice his desire remember as the prophet said his desire for fellowship is greater than ours but he knows in order for that fellowship to come we and ourselves must be brought into that atmosphere a full surrender are you hearing me now it is not something that's just turned on with a switch but his atmosphere and his presence it creates an atmosphere of surrender where the veils of the day the veils of life all those veils begin to drop all around us and excuses and and reason all the same faceless begins to drop right around us why we are in the presence of the love of god that's working on our life and love is having a way it's working in our life there's things that's being cut away things that's being removed then the next notice this embrace and he says this embrace notice what this embrace does give me a little bit more in his monitors please you embrace the written word i want you to what this is in the holy place now veil's coming down you embrace the lord's gospel you embrace the written word you believe it with all your heart you see for a person wanting to enter into fellowship you can't get there without embracing the written word you see that and that's something just turn it down just a tiny little bit you you can't look even in our daily walk with god what i'm preaching of here it's something when you can invite the holy spirit to apply it personally in your lives in a daily basis because you can't enter into fellowship listen friends every one of us know if you're if you are not staying in step with god i can tell you right now it's hard to enter into fellowship it's hard to be available come on the cares of life and everything else we're not making excuses but we're trying to identify by the waters of separation that these things just don't well you know i believe the message i'm a part of it you know and i used to have this in my life i don't have this in my life no you were created for fellowship with god not just to come to church not just to be associated around where the mystery's being preached but you are ordained to have fellowship with the mystery of god to embrace notice to embrace the lord's gospel god it doesn't matter what you want me to do whatever you have planned in my life i'm ready now to receive it that's the living room but then inside the bedroom he says that's where you must go in order to have complete fellowship because that's that's becoming into relationship and he speaks of how he says too many are ashamed to go into that complete relationship with god to new life and new birth but once you go in there then all the shameness and backwardness and everything's gone he said you you said whereas before he said when you come into that place it don't matter if the president of the united states is standing right there you'll shout the glory of god it doesn't matter if it's your boss it don't matter who it is you are in fellowship with god see as he's placing it it's not just something at church not just something on a midweek service not just something in your prayer closet but it is every day of your life you have a fellowship with god how about that little german that went to a meeting here he is back in the butcher shop and every once in a while glory to god and he would raise up speaking in tongues and everything and they had honey what's wrong with you oh you know he began to speak about what had taken place and and you don't mean to tell me you went down there among a bunch of them nuts do you oh yes glory to god thank you thank the lord for the nuts he said because if there wasn't no nuts what would hold this world together you see there was a fellowship that he had he was just like that old man that the that his daughter put him up in the attic you know she said i ain't gonna let you have a bible i ain't gonna let you have nothing because i gotta have my friends over and i don't want you embarrassing me in front of my friends but she put him up there and you see a man that's got fellowship with god he don't need just a bible to see god he can see god in nature he can see god all around why there's a fellowship and he can recognize his creator boy he got to read that geography book and where it said there's places in the sea they can't even find the bottom of it oh he got the shouting when he thought about he put my sin in the sea of god's forgetfulness what is it it's a fellowship of the mystery of god and he was so full of joy oh glory be to god let's stand i tell you this is a this is a moment and it's a time and i'll just say it in this way i they can't get to where we were going to trying to get to tonight but you you get to you get the point the ram tells us like this with this the blood placed before us you see the gospel it doesn't come to condemn us the voice of condemnation is if you allow satan to remain there and to hold you back if you allow him it'll be condemnation see the spirit of god comes to bring liberty now you see god comes and he deals with our life to enter into fellowship now i want you to think of this of entering in fully into the holy ghost and i want you to think about this of remaining in that fellowship and effectual as a believer as well and allow the holy spirit just to apply this to our life because we we all realize right here even though i heard brother brian praying in the prayer request i want to grow into that stature of a perfect man we're here in that hour as brother branham would identify because we have not added these virtues to our lives brother braham identifies he says he starts with a born-again experience in god is that right that's a foundation that no other man can lay brother brandon would identify that and he would say it's not man adding it he said because if a man does it he said it's like a black bird trying to add peacock feathers but if you look at every one of those virtues and that coming out in our life those are not if i can say in this way maybe god would help me to be make it simple enough those are not things that we just sit around like we are in a lawn chair taking in the sun and drinking sweet tea and patience oh boy i just feel patience flowing out of my life i just feel faith flowing out of my life i just feel brotherly kind no no no remember jeremiah 7 i believe psalms 1 1 in the times of dryness around here of adversity of test and of trials that's where faith will really declare itself patience when you're praying for something in god's word you don't see any evidence of it but there's patience patience is what comes by the in outworking of the holy spirit to know god said it maybe nothing wrong with god or wrong with his word but maybe i'm not in line with where i need to be in my thinking about it what is it in the midst of that time patience that's why james could say let patience have her perfect work on and on we could go we want to we want to grow more and more into that statue of christ now remember god has given us the vitamins in this hour he's given us the vitamins that we need in this hour to be victorious to be overcomers and mature how many of you here brother branham on tape say he said where he said we're hearing the message he said i believe we're hearing it intellectually he said but we need to lay in the presence of the sun and ripen you say oh brother samuel i'm going to pray for all those people that are hearing it intellectually know all of us because you see first of all the word must be received in the channel of our mind god makes us aware of these things and we things think about it things that you and i have looked at in past years and past times and now it's standing out real clear before us it's god's grace even in this hour even in in working in our life in his overcoming power what is that it's the spirit of god personally in communion with him as husband and wife and we are praying for those things that he is making known to us that are beneficiary to his kingdom and we're part of his kingdom listen you're not praying about this need no you pray about natural needs david said i've never seen a child of god have to beg for bread we do pray for those natural things but we never put those natural things ahead of the kingdom of god seek ye first the kingdom of god that's how our prayers should be if our prayers are more on the natural and material things of life then we've got the wrong order but if we're praying lord for the kingdom of god first lord keep me in the center of your will lord keep me lord in step with you lord help me if there's anything that allowed the creep in my life if there's amnesia if there's things about me lord that's come around lord help me lord help me to see it lord god i want to walk so fully and pleasing and writing step i want to see the word lord god moving in my life a maturing taking place that's seeking the kingdom of god first not that we don't pray about other things but there's a lot out there that pray about a lot of other things too and they've got needs and god hears them but god is making known to you and i the mysteries concerning this fellowship of the things that we're to pray for what access that we have lot could not pray for his own deliverance because he didn't know that but abraham shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do abraham was able to pray for it daniel it was nobody else in the kingdom but daniel it was revealed to him that here is 68 years in 70 years this is how it's going to be but when that revelation that 68 years if i can say that third pool was revealed to daniel he began to pray and seek for the coming deliverance why it was revealed to him daniel wasn't just praying god put food on the table in babylon god put shoes on my feet in babylon no daniel recognized he understood by the books this is the time to be praying for deliverance that's communion with god and we want to grow we want to grow and this is why we need the word the preaching of the word of god the ministering of the word it keeps us in fellowship with him it cleanses he cleanses think of this let me just read this and i am closing here he said now before you enter into that place there's a blood veil hanging there for the cleansing you must recognize that blood as an innocent substitute through the preaching of the word brought down the veil of the blood see the preaching of the word brings the veil of the blood on display it burning what is who who is that blood it's jesus christ himself coming present in the meeting paul said i i never established you on the entire words of man wisdom but in the your faith would be established in the power of god the veil of blood has been brought before us by the preaching of the gospel and in there you'll see that someone has died in your place then you'll throw down all your earthly possessions all your faing dangle ideas all your dancing your immoral living and all the things that you've fought up in your own self and you go to church your new rules your new commandments your non-mediating and all these things you'll lay it aside and plunge holy into the blood and say lord wash me and cleanse me [Music] see that's that's that's that precious opportunity that we have through the washing of water by the word as we bow our heads in a word of prayer to understand it in this way there's things that no doubt that for some of you that's prayed about god i want to see a real move in my life but remember in order for god to move you've got to move upon his word your heart is moved but when your heart is moved there's got to be something that moves you within that that heart being moved to say yes lord that is me not because god won't come over top of that but if you'll just move upon that as he's dealing with your life as he's speaking to your heart and you'll just invite him right down that channel right now he'll come [Music] he'll come if it's something that you've got to get cleared out of the way if it's condemnation if it's something in your life if it's something that's lacking when you say brother samuel i need to get back into fellowship with god then right now is the best time to do it right now is the best time to do it if there's things that need to be removed away from your life don't wait to another day don't wait to another time you might say brother samuel these are things that i've got here at home but maybe there you've come into the living room and you're in the time of embrace are you letting the word embrace you brother samuel i no longer i no longer do this and i no longer do that and i know i know but are you letting the word embrace your life because when the word embraces your life then then it brings you to a place to say lord what you desire for me lord that's what i want i want to line up fully with your word and then it comes the entering into the bedroom where relationship real fellowship takes place and it's his life that was in the blood that comes inside of you and it produces it brings forth the son and daughter of god the blood of jesus christ that's the grounds of fellowship tonight i wonder has every head is bound throughout this building and across the internet those that would stream it that you just like to let it be

enemy would want to get a foothold in our life would like to bring division lord in the home or division lord in the church but oh god there's a desire for fellowship it's much greater than our part
