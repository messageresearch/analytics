[30:03] [Music]
[30:05] Amen wonderful tonight he's worthy
[30:11] tonight these lovely isn't it a ring god
[30:15] bless you it's good to be with you again
[30:17] this evening it's nice to see you all in
[30:20] the midweek the ones that could make it
[30:21] out and we just appreciate the mercy in
[30:24] the grace of God to be with you here
[30:27] once again I know many you're working
[30:29] folks so we'll just get straight in the
[30:30] scripture tonight try not to keep you
[30:32] four or five hours so my wife reminded
[30:36] me about that tonight so but if you have
[30:38] your Bibles tonight when we looked in
[30:40] the Book of Daniel the seventh chapter
[30:42] and I I think it was clear back in March
[30:46] I I preached a sermon here I believe on
[30:49] on the inspiration of God and I've
[30:52] actually got the home churches things
[30:54] I've kind of taken several different
[30:56] thoughts from that and so I'd like to go
[30:58] maybe back on that direction tonight and
[31:01] I'd like to speak on the inclination to
[31:05] inspiration now before you ask me why I
[31:07] use the word inclination it's because it
[31:09] rhymes with inspiration so sounds really
[31:11] it's kind of evening anyway but the idea
[31:14] of being inclined or somebody that's
[31:15] inclined to inspiration and I would like
[31:18] to take my text so Daniel the seventh
[31:19] chapter this evening and we're gonna
[31:21] read verses 15 to 16 for a text and then
[31:25] we'll have a word of Prayer here the
[31:27] Bible says this it says that I Daniel
[31:30] was grieved in my spirit in the midst of
[31:33] my body and the visions of my head
[31:36] troubled me and I came near unto one of
[31:39] them that stood by and asked him the
[31:41] truth of all this so he told me and made
[31:44] known the interpretation of these things
[31:48] now if you were called a lie who says in
[31:51] the book of Job he says the inspiration
[31:53] of God gives understanding and so he had
[31:56] seen these visions and they had troubled
[31:58] him and then it was made known the
[32:00] interpretation of these things so we
[32:02] look to the Lord tonight - maybe
[32:03] continue to do the same and give us
[32:05] understanding tonight and that before we
[32:07] do so let's just bow our heads for word
[32:08] of Prayer our most gracious Heavenly
[32:11] Father we so thankful for your mercy and
[32:14] your grace and your kindness to us your
[32:18] dear children Lord your loving-kindness
[32:20] it's better than life to us father
[32:22] your words sweet as the honey in the
[32:24] comb Lord we're so thankful father I
[32:27] think of a natural people Israel and how
[32:30] you promised them a land a good land
[32:33] that flows with milk and honey your
[32:36] prophet said as the type of us the
[32:38] believer having received the Holy Ghost
[32:40] father and Lord even in the midst of our
[32:43] earthly journey we go through trials and
[32:45] we face Giants and we face the
[32:47] proverbial walled cities of life and yet
[32:50] we're so thankful for this Holy Ghost
[32:52] gospel we're so thankful for your spirit
[32:55] living with and in your people tonight
[32:57] that you were leading guide us probably
[32:59] you would manifest yourself by your
[33:01] power Lord not by the wisdom of men but
[33:03] by the power of your spirit that our
[33:05] faith should not stand in the wisdom of
[33:07] men but in the power of God and lo we're
[33:10] so thankful tonight that you give us
[33:12] your spirit that we might freely know
[33:14] the things which are given to us by your
[33:16] grace and by your provision because you
[33:18] have said it Lord and we rejoice in that
[33:21] tonight
[33:22] father I pray the word which has been
[33:23] read now Lord me you just give and other
[33:26] it's an inspiration that which were said
[33:28] may inspire and move the hearts of these
[33:30] your children that have gathered here
[33:32] tonight Lord they're not my children but
[33:35] they're your children a father you
[33:36] they're your dear ones with whom you
[33:38] have purchased with the precious blood
[33:40] of Jesus Christ Lord I believe you have
[33:43] plans for them plans for peace and for
[33:46] an expected end Lord you desire to do
[33:48] good things to do great things in their
[33:50] life by your spirit father believe
[33:53] you've purposed each one here tonight
[33:54] that you've called that they would be
[33:56] blessed by you for a purpose
[33:58] father I just pray you come and take
[34:00] preeminence in the service now as the
[34:02] angels of God walk the aisles may your
[34:05] spirit moving every heart I pray and
[34:07] father bless your children may they go
[34:09] from this place tonight with a greater
[34:11] inspiration moving and stirring them in
[34:14] their life I pray Lord for myself I just
[34:16] want to be more yielded to you than I've
[34:18] ever been before I want to be so careful
[34:20] to hear every
[34:21] and be led by your father and we just
[34:24] commit ourselves to this purpose now we
[34:26] ask that you had your way and father we
[34:28] give you the praise and the glory and
[34:30] the honor for it for you asking in the
[34:32] mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[34:34] Christ and the bride says Amen god bless
[34:37] yous you're seated tonight so as I said
[34:41] I was taking this thought of inspiration
[34:43] several different ways and nor will and
[34:46] I might continue with it even Sunday by
[34:48] the grace of God but the brother Brennan
[34:52] makes a statement and it kind of ties it
[34:53] all back into this I want you to retain
[34:56] this in your thinking and in your hearts
[34:58] as you meditate upon these things or the
[35:00] brands that inspired believers with the
[35:02] inspired Word he says the two together
[35:04] brings the results amen and so as I've
[35:07] said before and I'm going to say it
[35:08] again
[35:09] we know the Word of God tonight is
[35:11] inspired amen it was not necessary
[35:13] before I came to service tonight for me
[35:15] to go make sure the word was inspired I
[35:17] didn't have to qualify it I didn't have
[35:19] to get it inspired I didn't have to take
[35:21] it to a certain place the word of God's
[35:23] inspired he's preserved it he's given it
[35:25] by his own grace it was his own counsel
[35:28] but tonight the questions can we find
[35:30] ourselves living in the same inspiration
[35:32] can the Word of God that's been written
[35:35] it could be more than just words of the
[35:36] page tonight you God writing in our
[35:38] hearts amen
[35:39] I believe that's what the Spirit of God
[35:40] comes to do is to put the long dog in
[35:43] our inward parts amen
[35:45] and I believe if you're believing
[35:46] tonight and you have to hold the ghost I
[35:48] believe that's a reality for you tonight
[35:50] and everything you need for your earthly
[35:51] journey is already in you by the Holy
[35:53] Ghost and I saw what you understand the
[35:56] inspiration is that something that's far
[35:58] off from you the inspiration on this
[36:00] Bible is here but I believe the
[36:02] inspiration in the believers at the
[36:04] heart tonight if we can allow God to
[36:06] speak to us and direct us in such a way
[36:10] we can find ourselves seeing the witness
[36:13] of this and our lack of the great away
[36:14] and then I want you to send that people
[36:17] in this Bible they were moved and they
[36:19] were inspired to do things they themself
[36:21] really understand at the time and yet we
[36:24] find out it was gone most was inspired
[36:26] to stand in the gap for a people Joseph
[36:29] a man in prison for 13 years and he
[36:31] comes out interprets a King's dream
[36:33] brother Ram talks about is alive was a
[36:35] type of Christ that man didn't know the
[36:37] prison name is a type of Christ Moses
[36:39] didn't know and then the prophecy didn't
[36:42] even really fully understand and yet we
[36:45] find out it was God all the time I
[36:47] believe as believers we can find many
[36:49] times our life that not as though things
[36:51] are alike and maybe we even scratched
[36:53] our heads at the time maybe we are Salva
[36:55] didn't even know it was God time maybe
[36:59] we even thought we made a mistake and
[37:02] then sometimes we hear the word of God
[37:03] and we obey the Word of God then we
[37:05] begin a question like John the Baptist
[37:07] visit yours in another Lord that man
[37:11] muted seen a vision that men knew that
[37:13] God spoke to him yet he found himself
[37:15] because of those circumstances a man
[37:17] well that's his nature that was the
[37:19] spirit of Elijah that's his nature a man
[37:21] that comes back to what I'm talking
[37:23] about tonight sometimes people when God
[37:25] speaks to them sometimes they get
[37:26] inspired you know it's like Elijah he
[37:28] was a bold man up there was a 450
[37:30] prophets the bear but when he come down
[37:32] off that mountain
[37:33] he was a man he was a man he was just a
[37:36] man like you and I are they're like
[37:37] passions a man sometimes this is why I
[37:40] say that sometimes the devil trying to
[37:42] scourge you because you got bills or
[37:44] because you got troubles or because
[37:46] you're going through things and you
[37:47] think well that's not very spiritual but
[37:50] I want you understand these people in
[37:51] the Bible there are many like passions
[37:53] they went through the same kind of
[37:54] trials the same kind of things it wasn't
[37:57] there a statue that made them of special
[37:59] people understand he was a God the god
[38:03] they served the Bobby's disciples
[38:07] that's what made them different and if
[38:09] he's the same God tonight that makes you
[38:11] the same way so you're special whether
[38:14] you feel like they're not and then now
[38:16] you're not special like the world says
[38:17] you're special or you know Sesame Street
[38:20] but you're a different kind of people
[38:22] amen
[38:23] I'm not saying that to be glad I
[38:24] remember the world's always preaching
[38:26] this idea when you're
[38:27] showing the listener but listen you
[38:29] really are a different kind of people in
[38:31] the day the heirs of the super highways
[38:33] and supermarkets there's a super people
[38:41] there's people like the Prophet Dame of
[38:43] the Bible says he was a man with an
[38:44] excellent spirit the Spirit of God
[38:46] listen the other magicians even believe
[38:49] that God could live and work in a man
[38:51] and here it was right in front of them
[38:53] manifested and then he had an excellent
[38:57] spirit the Bible said nah that's pretty
[38:58] that's a good compliment that's what I
[39:00] want me know him for amen
[39:01] well I could be known for a lot of
[39:03] things and not for a lot of other things
[39:04] I am known for amen
[39:06] but that's he had an excellent spirit
[39:08] amen praise the Lord and so we look at
[39:11] this the inspired word with the spy
[39:14] believers homies inspire tonight if
[39:17] you're an inspired believer it's going
[39:18] to bring results the proper said it
[39:20] would bring results bring it to anybody
[39:24] you're the class of people on the earth
[39:27] that believe so why do somebody else to
[39:31] do we're looking in the pew neck stuff
[39:33] we're looking for some great something
[39:35] the great something is here Christ is
[39:38] here he's anointed tonight he's ever
[39:49] been a man he can defeat the devil the
[39:52] Word of God can defeat the devil any
[39:54] place anywhere and anytime that's a
[39:57] midweek service amen
[39:58] hey oh man he coming up here to get me
[40:01] sorry praise the Lord excuse me amen now
[40:10] and I want to make a point and I've said
[40:11] this Amen but I want you understand you
[40:13] can't make inspiration happen remember
[40:16] you can wait for inspiration I've talked
[40:18] about this last time I was there you can
[40:19] read your Bible and you can pray brother
[40:21] Ram said you can do that every day we'll
[40:23] grow closer closer to God real closer to
[40:26] God read your Bible and pray everyday
[40:28] hey man listen it's not so far off that
[40:31] it's impossible it's it's something you
[40:33] can do read your Bible and pray that's
[40:36] where you get your inspiration
[40:38] if your hearts are attentive and your
[40:40] ears are inclined you can receive
[40:42] inspiration from God and amen we wait on
[40:46] inspiration and we yield to it amen
[40:48] we don't want to wait on and they're not
[40:49] yield to it like Balaam but we want to
[40:51] hear from God amen
[40:52] I mostly hear from the Lord amen well if
[40:55] we want to hear from him let's do what
[40:57] he says when he speaks to us amen I mean
[41:00] I'm talking about this idea being
[41:01] inclined or inclination to the Spirit
[41:03] tonight and the reason I'm taking this
[41:05] thought and this is kind of what I was
[41:07] hurling get around to here is that many
[41:09] times inspiration like I said it doesn't
[41:11] always look the way we think it's going
[41:14] to look amen
[41:16] sometimes it manifests itself a little
[41:18] bit differently and we get the wrong
[41:20] idea about once what inspiration is
[41:22] inspiration is not always you're running
[41:24] and shouting and jumping although it can
[41:26] be and that's good and that's fine but
[41:28] that's not always what it looks like and
[41:31] then we look in this Texas over here
[41:33] tonight in Daniel he sees Rothfuss this
[41:35] property sees his visions and it
[41:37] actually troubles his spirit amen he
[41:40] actually becomes agreed because of the
[41:41] things that he sees I think of John in
[41:43] the first chapter of the book of
[41:44] Revelation when he turns to see the
[41:46] voice of one speaking him he falls down
[41:48] like a dead man and then that's not our
[41:52] idea of having church tonight that's
[41:54] exactly what happened to him when he got
[41:55] inspired and he's seen this thing he's
[41:57] found like a dead man and even the
[41:59] Prophet we know many times and the
[42:01] meaning come out under the power of
[42:03] those visions he said he didn't wipe
[42:05] them out
[42:05] amen and so sometimes inspiration
[42:08] affects an individual differently than
[42:11] maybe they'd expect amen
[42:13] the reason I'm saying this actually I
[42:15] like I said I've been studying this
[42:16] thought looking at it and I had a sister
[42:19] come to me one day at church and I was
[42:20] talking with her and her husband after
[42:21] church and I got to talking about this
[42:23] and it kind of inspired me to speak
[42:25] about inspiration on this thought a man
[42:27] but she was talking to me and this is
[42:29] the sister and since the time she become
[42:31] a Christian she began to deal with
[42:33] things she get these tremendous burdens
[42:34] or weights in her life and she was
[42:37] convinced there was something wrong with
[42:38] her mentally man and so I want to I want
[42:40] to preface this night this is this is
[42:42] not in a replacement for something that
[42:44] has an actual chemical imbalance or
[42:46] something like that I'm
[42:47] not trying to replace that I'm not
[42:48] trying to take you away from a doctor
[42:50] but in this sister's case I think in
[42:52] many times with many of us I'd begin to
[42:54] talk to her I begin to feel her spirit
[42:56] out a little bit and talking about this
[42:57] idea and she would go through these
[43:00] things and not realizing why it was she
[43:03] thought there was something wrong with
[43:04] her amen
[43:05] praise the Lord and so and I think many
[43:08] people in the same instance they they
[43:10] get a certain burden or maybe they're
[43:11] sensitive to the spirits of certain
[43:13] things and many times they think there's
[43:15] something wrong with them I said sister
[43:16] I don't think there's anything wrong
[43:18] with you actually I think God's trying
[43:19] to use you and there was actually the
[43:21] obvious she lost she wasn't good enough
[43:22] I'm like no I think God's trying to use
[43:25] you I said sister there's so many needs
[43:27] and burdens in the church today and even
[43:30] this he said like I said people don't
[43:32] always know what it is we don't always
[43:33] know what it is but I believe you're
[43:35] catching the spirit of it what God's
[43:37] want me to do is pray amen and so she
[43:41] kind of brightened up and I talked her
[43:42] about this and some of the things I'm
[43:44] talking about tonight with you but I
[43:46] said even in my own life and I'm not
[43:48] saying this to promote myself but if
[43:50] somebody's in the ministry or whatever
[43:51] I'm sure they can relate but there's
[43:53] been times I'll go to preach somewhere
[43:55] and I'll go in the back office and I
[43:57] have my coffee in the morning and I had
[43:59] my bagel or whatever I'm having and I
[44:01] feel great I'm getting ready to preach
[44:03] and the next thing you know I'll be
[44:04] weeping on the floor or I'll be on a
[44:06] burden and when I was first preached I
[44:08] thought what's wrong with me
[44:09] see I thought there's something wrong
[44:10] with me and you might argue there still
[44:12] is but in this case in this case it was
[44:15] actually God trying to deal something
[44:16] with me and I begin to notice after a
[44:18] while you get a certain burden or a
[44:20] certain feeling about it and it would
[44:22] cause me to preach or going to certain
[44:24] inch a channel of inspiration and what
[44:28] I'd find out is there somebody in the
[44:29] Carnation going through whatever I was
[44:31] feeling and so I've been gonna recognize
[44:34] and so I say this tonight I think that's
[44:36] not just for the ministry I think many
[44:39] times we go through things and it's more
[44:41] than just the if it's cloudy outside or
[44:43] whatever but many times as Christians
[44:45] we're subject to the spirit of thing and
[44:47] God inspires us and I think many
[44:50] Christians they don't always recognize
[44:51] what it
[44:52] I didn't recognize it when first started
[44:53] happening I thought to myself like this
[44:56] sister thought there's something wrong
[44:57] with me why didn't I get ready to preach
[44:58] I get all whatever and then I think I
[45:01] was you know it's like it was a big deal
[45:03] but we find out and the Prophet talks
[45:05] about this and he says that many times
[45:07] he's a poet she says poets prophets
[45:09] spiritual people he says they're always
[45:11] considered neurotic or something wrong
[45:14] with them
[45:15] amen and he gives the example of Stephen
[45:17] Stephen Fowler and he wrote old black
[45:21] Joe and old Kentucky home and how the
[45:22] man he'd get done and he'd go take a
[45:24] raisin trying to kill himself or were
[45:26] young copper he went to drown himself
[45:27] brother Brandon he's the example to show
[45:29] you that that people that get inspired
[45:31] amen many times when when the
[45:34] inspiration leaves they have a wood they
[45:37] look like they're neurotic brother
[45:38] Graham says this and it's in the sermon
[45:39] blind bartimaeus 1957 he says see he
[45:43] says when you're out there it's
[45:44] wonderful but it's when you're coming
[45:46] out he says look at Jonah the Prophet
[45:47] well that was a message of God and
[45:50] prophesied to the city about the size of
[45:52] Saint Louis Missouri to people which
[45:55] didn't know the right and left hand
[45:57] he said his message were so forceful
[46:00] until they put sackcloth on their
[46:02] animals but then when the spirit left
[46:05] and he was so depleted they sent her a
[46:07] little tree and he got angry and
[46:09] wouldn't God would strike him dead
[46:11] because a little cutworm cut the gourd
[46:13] tree out from hundred is that right he's
[46:15] looking Elijah the Prophet on the
[46:17] inspiration a man stood there called a
[46:20] fire out of heaven cold water out of
[46:23] having the same day killed four of the
[46:25] priests and wrong with the threat of a
[46:27] woman run out into the desert it was
[46:30] either 40 days and 40 nights walking
[46:32] around the angel woke him up when he was
[46:34] sleeping
[46:34] fed him twice for that long journey he
[46:37] was water in the desert not knowing
[46:39] where he was and when God found him he'd
[46:42] been pulling back in a cage he says how
[46:44] many knows that is only to just get the
[46:46] spiritual side friends he says I love to
[46:48] hear people shout I say amen
[46:50] I love to hear people praise the Lord
[46:53] but that's not spiritual yeah I've seen
[46:55] people shot and danced and praise the
[46:57] Lord
[46:57] no nothing more about spiritual things
[46:59] than a Hottentot knowed about Egyptian
[47:01] out you might have get your dictionary
[47:02] half
[47:04] he said they come up on the pop I'm just
[47:06] running around and around and screaming
[47:08] and carrying on that's emotion emotions
[47:11] all right but brother when you come
[47:13] right down to the fact of it that's not
[47:15] spirit that's joy but spirit is
[47:19] spiritually discerned amen so much I
[47:22] want show says it's spiritually
[47:23] discerning things and this is why it's
[47:26] careful like I talked about inspiration
[47:27] to not only you to it but to receive it
[47:30] the right way because we don't want to
[47:32] be if you're sensitive to the Spirit of
[47:35] God and you don't submit that to God you
[47:38] become sensitive to other kinds of
[47:39] spirits amen
[47:41] brother BAM talks about he used the
[47:42] example King Saul Amen because the evil
[47:45] spirit that come on is that right
[47:46] because he rejected the word of the Lord
[47:48] so we never want to go to God with her
[47:50] own idea well we never want to seek God
[47:52] and try to hear our thought in his own
[47:54] voice we want to stay neutral and let
[47:56] God speak to us and then we want to
[47:58] receive it the way it comes amen
[48:00] otherwise you've threatened to get
[48:01] yourself into other kinds of spirits
[48:02] amen and so that's why I said this many
[48:05] times Christians maybe they have a
[48:06] certain burden and they think that
[48:08] they're maybe they're depressed or they
[48:10] think that they're melancholy and many
[48:12] times this why I don't try to qualify
[48:14] this I want to be careful but many times
[48:16] it's not a mental issue at all but
[48:18] they're actually catching the spirit or
[48:20] they're sensitive to burdens or needs in
[48:23] the body of Christ now that doesn't mean
[48:25] just the building you're in but the very
[48:27] body of Christ amen
[48:28] and because people don't realize it
[48:31] that's why they they don't submit your
[48:34] name n the Bible says this in 1st
[48:36] Corinthians chapter 12 and the 24th
[48:38] verse it says our for our comely parts
[48:40] have no need but God hath tempered the
[48:43] body together having given more abundant
[48:45] honor to the part which lacks that there
[48:48] should be no schism in the body well
[48:50] praise the Lord amen long doesn't want
[48:54] there to be a schism in the body he
[48:55] wants to work together and so the parts
[48:57] that are weaker or more uncomely the
[48:59] Bible says here those members should
[49:01] have the same care for one another if
[49:03] one member suffers all suffer with it or
[49:06] if one member on
[49:07] enjoy Swift today men siddhappa stores
[49:10] more abundant honor amen praise the Lord
[49:12] you think about your heart and your
[49:14] hearts very vital to the operation your
[49:16] body but listen it's very weak as well
[49:18] it doesn't take much to damage the heart
[49:21] that's why it's protected so well praise
[49:23] the Lord and so many times in the body
[49:25] the members that seen the we kiss for
[49:28] the seamless fragile sometimes they're
[49:30] the ones that God bestows were abundant
[49:33] on Iran because they serve a function
[49:35] that maybe you don't see it visibly like
[49:37] your hand in your finger here I Amen I
[49:39] think God for prayer I just got back
[49:41] from India here amen and I know people
[49:43] were praying for me and I know what it
[49:45] means to me as a minister when people
[49:47] are praying for you because that's what
[49:49] makes the difference a man does anything
[49:53] but the people that come together and
[49:55] they pray and brother Branham here I was
[49:57] just reading this cooked at home church
[49:58] here the other day my brother man when
[50:00] he's getting regular Palestine he asked
[50:02] the people to pray for him he says those
[50:03] prayers he says that would be accounted
[50:05] to you for those souls just as much as
[50:07] my efforts over there and then listen
[50:10] don't ever think your Labor's in vain
[50:12] he said well I'm just praying for this
[50:14] and this son I didn't do nothing special
[50:15] you shut up
[50:17] and you believe the word and you're
[50:19] praying for one another and the Bible
[50:21] says when one rejoices one long-desired
[50:23] we all rejoice because listen it's a
[50:26] body we need each other and when you
[50:29] begin to recognize - somebody's not me
[50:31] versus them or this person here is this
[50:33] person not here and when I don't care if
[50:35] it's your pinky toe gives it a little
[50:37] paper cut and you watch the whole line
[50:40] we're gonna work he'll walk normally
[50:42] medicine captain you break out the
[50:44] bandage and you get out the alcohol the
[50:46] body takes care of itself and then
[50:49] listen these hands if I cut my toe these
[50:52] guys aren't in pain
[50:53] yeah they feel the burn into what's
[50:55] going wrong because it's connected to
[50:58] the body and you become connected to
[51:01] this body of Christ
[51:04] connected when you come to this body
[51:09] your subject you're subject to
[51:13] sufferable one summers but we also
[51:14] rejoice when one is honored Amen how God
[51:18] has tempered us together why that there
[51:20] would be no schism in the body praise
[51:23] our Lord
[51:24] my my brother in says this and this
[51:26] isn't a question as it answers 1954 he
[51:29] says and I think this is relevant to
[51:32] what I'm saying tonight he says I'll
[51:33] give you my estimation of what I think
[51:35] is the closest thing to an evidence that
[51:37] a man is a Christian than anything I
[51:40] know of you know what it is now watch
[51:42] this now this is not what most people
[51:43] would think but he says it's travail of
[51:45] soul but that's a remarkable thing we
[51:49] thought be something else look at
[51:50] exciting he said this true battle soul a
[51:53] person that's always so hungry and
[51:55] thirsting for God than just simply deny
[51:57] they just keep stamped they've got to do
[51:59] something for God they're full of love
[52:01] and they're just soldier we all just
[52:03] travail them all the time the Bible says
[52:05] he that goeth forth song and tears will
[52:07] doubtless return again rejoicing
[52:09] bringing with him precious sheaves as I
[52:11] ride he says all those sins now watch
[52:13] this analogy he uses is it now look this
[52:16] church he said it this morning
[52:17] if this group who people here that I if
[52:19] God would say now look William Brando
[52:22] I'm gonna make you answer for that group
[52:23] of people what you tell them now what do
[52:26] you want do you want them all to shout
[52:27] to share I want them to shout do you
[52:29] want them to all speaking with tongues I
[52:31] won't ever one of them - that's not
[52:32] there some message churches hey I'll
[52:35] come back to here in a minute hey man he
[52:37] says this do you want a wall to dance in
[52:38] this merit he says I want every one of
[52:40] them - all right well that's good but
[52:42] what would you rather have them do and
[52:44] he says I'd rather have a church that
[52:47] has such a burden on their heart for
[52:49] prayer than the Justina's altar and
[52:52] we'll be here day and night
[52:53] yells and in their house just constantly
[52:58] in prayer and humble and trying to get
[53:01] people to come to God and make him call
[53:03] the hospital and visiting the sick and
[53:06] trying to get people to come to church
[53:08] and do right I'd rather have that then
[53:11] all the other put together
[53:13] he says the although the other is right
[53:16] it belongs to the church so I want to
[53:17] make sure I don't throw that out
[53:18] amen I'm all for something praising God
[53:20] we can do that - amen I think we ought
[53:23] to shout rejoice because God speaks to
[53:25] us in the first place we ought to be
[53:27] excited about that amen he says but if I
[53:30] had to have I put that first because if
[53:33] you've got that the other will take
[53:35] place so I don't have to make you praise
[53:38] God come on guys let's get go when that
[53:41] happens the other will take place that's
[53:43] when that person you've been praying for
[53:44] for months they get delivered and they
[53:47] get saving you see them in church I
[53:48] don't have to make you rejoice you
[53:51] rejoice just finally because they're
[53:55] sick in their body and you see the Lord
[53:57] do something on the line when you're
[53:59] praying for your traction you're praying
[54:00] for salt Franco would give you a greater
[54:03] measure and you see it come to pass
[54:05] nobody has to make you praise God nobody
[54:08] has to make you shop you've got a reason
[54:10] to shop you got victory amen he's you
[54:17] got that you just get so hungry for God
[54:19] that shouting will take place you got so
[54:22] hungry for God speaking in tongues will
[54:23] take place he's not so hungry for God
[54:25] you just keep on her and keep this up
[54:27] you go to seeing yourself get
[54:29] indifferent just remember look out
[54:33] there's another spirit trying to work
[54:35] itself in their notes the other spirit
[54:38] come so if we see ourselves getting
[54:40] indifferent we know what spirit that is
[54:41] and then we shouldn't be indifferent
[54:43] with one another we should actually be
[54:46] trying to bear one another's burdens all
[54:47] the Bible says bury your own Amen not me
[54:50] trying to shuck paper are there any of
[54:51] you you know fix my tire for me cuz I
[54:52] don't want to do it nothing like that
[54:54] amen and then we should we shouldn't
[54:57] have to we shouldn't have to make each
[54:59] other feel each other's burdens because
[55:01] we're part of the body amen it's one
[55:04] thing to have
[55:05] ramps is one thing to have sympathy but
[55:06] compassion is doing the will of God amen
[55:09] since what we're talking I just know I
[55:11] feel bad for somebody this is this is
[55:13] what I'm saying you get a burden and
[55:14] maybe you don't know why it's because
[55:16] you're touched with their and further
[55:17] mister the Bible says Amen it's one
[55:20] thing to just feel bad about it that's
[55:21] something to be touched by it
[55:23] hey man so a lot of Christians are they
[55:27] they encounter these same conditions and
[55:29] like I said they feel heaviness they
[55:31] feel burdens and this we live in a dark
[55:33] and an erotic age and you've got every
[55:35] scientist in every psychologist and
[55:37] every doctor telling you oh it's just
[55:39] this it's just that and men's hearts are
[55:41] failing for fear a man and many times we
[55:44] think there's something wrong with us
[55:45] because we we do what we all do when we
[55:48] get sick we will get on Google and look
[55:49] it up and we'll I'll get on the Mayo
[55:51] calm website well I got this sin oh you
[55:54] do you feel you feel sad sometimes well
[55:56] yes I do
[55:57] oh well there's something wrong with you
[55:59] it's like that's everybody hey oh do you
[56:02] ever get discouraged well I want so I
[56:04] hope you might have this oh mercy Lord
[56:07] I've got this problem I got that problem
[56:10] and a lot of times the devils put a
[56:11] scarecrow on you
[56:12] hey man many times just the devil trying
[56:15] to say there's something wrong with you
[56:17] and actually st. Joe God's actually got
[56:19] enough confidence in you but he's trying
[56:23] to get you to Christ I need you two to
[56:25] intercede for somebody else what the
[56:28] sisters his sister God's trying to use
[56:30] you is what it is and we were talking
[56:32] certain things in this somehow I'm
[56:33] getting it all tonight mmm but I said
[56:35] it's the Lord's trying to get you to
[56:37] pray about a certain thing or entering
[56:39] for a certain thing and you don't
[56:41] realize it I don't know what that does
[56:44] for you but that got her excited what
[56:46] she realize that her problems and a
[56:48] trial wouldn't even her own but God had
[56:51] enough confidence in that little lady
[56:53] that he went to pray through her for him
[56:55] eating the body amen see it changes your
[56:58] whole attitude about the burden and I'm
[57:00] gonna have myself here a little bit amen
[57:02] but it's because she didn't recognize it
[57:04] my brother man he talked about this and
[57:05] I'm he uses this example he's talking
[57:08] about somebody who's asked about
[57:09] speaking in tongues so I'm not trying to
[57:10] make y'all Pentecost tonight but it's
[57:12] it's in the word amen but he talks about
[57:14] this in questions and answer
[57:15] he says I when I asked your brother he
[57:17] says have you ever felt the Holy Ghost
[57:19] shaped you so bad till you just couldn't
[57:22] hardly say nothing would you sit quiet
[57:24] sometimes just sit there and cry have
[57:26] you did that
[57:27] he says left the Holy Ghost now he's
[57:29] talking about this because the person
[57:30] asks about tongues is the reason people
[57:31] don't speaking with tongues many times
[57:34] is they don't know how to yield
[57:36] themselves to the spirit now and I want
[57:39] you to saying this pertains to anything
[57:41] with the spirit not just this amen he
[57:43] says many times they don't know how to
[57:44] yield themselves the spirit they're
[57:46] looking for something way off this is
[57:50] what we do we're looking for something
[57:52] away off they says when it's right on
[57:55] them that's the reason they don't some
[57:57] people just get this as worked up in
[57:59] emotions a bunch of words it has no
[58:00] meaning
[58:00] still got the Holy Ghost amen he says
[58:03] the people that are looking for
[58:04] something far and they miss it because
[58:05] it's there already
[58:06] amen amen praise the Lord my brother and
[58:09] he gives you an example in his own life
[58:11] and for the sake of time I'm not gonna
[58:13] read the whole quote but many of you
[58:14] were probably hopefully familiar with
[58:16] the story a brother man talks about time
[58:18] he was at the hotel they were having
[58:19] meetings and he was at the hotel praying
[58:21] one day and he got a burden on him amen
[58:24] like I was talking about earlier I don't
[58:26] know how bad it was but it was so bad
[58:28] really bad said they he told Billy Paul
[58:30] go ahead and have brother Baxter preach
[58:32] the meeting he got so burdened he didn't
[58:35] even want to preach a man I don't think
[58:37] we're the brain just skip Church skip
[58:38] Church it must have been that bad it was
[58:41] so heavy on him he said go ahead and run
[58:43] without me amen and he got down and he
[58:45] begin to pray and I want you know this
[58:48] is the prophet of God now this is the
[58:50] man that seen visions and he's seen
[58:51] miracles and he asked himself when I'm
[58:54] not like I said it's in the quote but he
[58:55] he asked himself you said Lord what's
[58:58] wrong with me and he knew something no
[59:03] he thought there was something wrong
[59:04] with him and then we can talk about how
[59:06] spiritually wasn't this that he didn't
[59:08] know he said Lord what's wrong with me
[59:11] and also he said he began to hear
[59:12] somebody praying and he said something
[59:14] like German Arlo ducks the man he's
[59:16] looking around for the bellhop and the
[59:18] owner he's looking who is it
[59:19] and then he finally realized it was him
[59:21] not his praying or I was just so he said
[59:25] it just kind of cuz it's telling me
[59:26] waiting for you done
[59:27] he said when it got done I thought I
[59:29] could run through a troop and leap over
[59:31] a long so that's the way to get where
[59:34] the burden you pray maybe you think
[59:38] there's something wrong the Prophet did
[59:40] to ask the Lord about it quit asking
[59:42] Facebook and quit asking Google could
[59:44] ask in your neighbor asked the Lord
[59:46] motors is something wrong with me and
[59:49] got me into savings and God begin to
[59:51] pray for you and that's how you get rid
[59:53] of the burden hey man we don't have to
[59:56] go drink a bunch of alcohol to get rid
[59:57] of our burdens we've got new wine comes
[59:59] straight out of listen many times we
[1:00:04] deal with heavy burdens you were never
[1:00:06] intended to bang them alone jesus said
[1:00:09] take my love my burdens easy my looks
[1:00:12] like he's sewing you got a bird you
[1:00:15] don't think he came back give it to him
[1:00:17] he never intended you to do it by you
[1:00:20] some of the break place he put the
[1:00:21] burden on you so he would pray so now
[1:00:25] the prop against them praying he goes
[1:00:27] down to meeting Billie's get ready to go
[1:00:28] out and bill oppose get ready leaves and
[1:00:29] I'm calling India and he goes and he
[1:00:31] preaches that night and many know this
[1:00:33] testimony but a woman coming to meeting
[1:00:35] and ship it on the way there the
[1:00:36] hospital won't even transport her cuz
[1:00:38] she had tuberculosis so back and lungs
[1:00:40] it was heat up and they're driving down
[1:00:41] the road and the hit of thing and she
[1:00:43] begin to hemorrhage and the bot that
[1:00:45] time she was supposed to die I'll send
[1:00:47] some come over and God healed her right
[1:00:50] there on the side road all the way to me
[1:00:52] this is the property even see a vision
[1:00:53] about it he didn't know nothing about
[1:00:55] that he inquired the time there's at the
[1:00:58] same time he was praying hotel
[1:01:05] just something you can do you can stand
[1:01:07] now you don't have to do it that way
[1:01:08] necessarily I'm not trying to push a
[1:01:10] certain thing what I'm saying is when
[1:01:12] the inspiration comes sometimes it's not
[1:01:14] making you jump up and down sometimes it
[1:01:16] feels like a burden because there's a
[1:01:18] need somewhere and his whole point is if
[1:01:20] he hadn't prayed if the Lord had
[1:01:22] interceded for that woman what wouldn't
[1:01:24] happen to her hey man ah I was just to
[1:01:30] make another illustration this isn't
[1:01:31] just the program I'm talking about it's
[1:01:33] not just telling them talking about I'll
[1:01:34] give you another quote I'm going to read
[1:01:35] this one to you tonight brother Brown
[1:01:37] says this in questions and answers 64 or
[1:01:39] are you following me all right I'm not
[1:01:41] trying to not trying to go too fast or
[1:01:43] anything here but brother Brad says this
[1:01:45] any questions and answers is in 1964
[1:01:48] they asked him can every Son of God be
[1:01:51] so anointed so he can do miracles signs
[1:01:54] wonders or is this just he says it at
[1:01:56] the directions of the Holy Ghost is yes
[1:01:58] it's out the directions of the Holy
[1:02:00] Ghost if you are a son of God or a
[1:02:02] daughter of God how many then we got you
[1:02:06] tonight wherever you are whatever you
[1:02:08] are when you have received the Holy
[1:02:10] Spirit then the Holy Spirit directs you
[1:02:13] to do things I like that do things
[1:02:16] you're not talk about fussing fight with
[1:02:18] your neighbor are you not the message he
[1:02:20] directs you to do stuff wants you to do
[1:02:22] some things a man we're gonna get
[1:02:23] something done in the kingdom of God he
[1:02:26] says I don't have time I said I he said
[1:02:28] I wish I could just tell you little
[1:02:29] stories every man I think of it just
[1:02:31] have to pass it by but I think this one
[1:02:33] will hold for just a minute he says I
[1:02:34] was down and married in Mississippi as
[1:02:37] many of you oneness people brother Big B
[1:02:38] was holding a sponsor my meetings he's a
[1:02:40] oneness brother one night in the meeting
[1:02:43] Billy Paul and went over to the arena
[1:02:45] and had give up prayer cards I was
[1:02:47] pouring down rain and the people were
[1:02:49] saying outside with umbrellas and things
[1:02:50] and Billy give up the prayer cards and
[1:02:53] he'd come to get me is then when he why
[1:02:55] come to get me there was a little lady
[1:02:56] that sat down in front and there was
[1:02:59] another lady walking with a little baby
[1:03:01] trying to keep it quiet and this little
[1:03:03] lady sitting here with a little calico
[1:03:04] dress on ever it was was a mother to and
[1:03:07] she'd seen the lady you're familiar with
[1:03:09] the story I hope I wouldn't I want to
[1:03:10] point something out with us tonight the
[1:03:12] Holy Spirit spoke to the woman something
[1:03:15] on her
[1:03:16] go pray for that baby now watch this Wow
[1:03:19] she said next time she passes I'll go
[1:03:22] pray for her that was a good idea
[1:03:24] watch what happens but when she passed
[1:03:27] by the lady was holding a prayer card oh
[1:03:29] she said I couldn't pray for the baby
[1:03:33] what happened that you could frame of
[1:03:34] the baby Oh My she's got a prayer
[1:03:36] couldn't I couldn't pray for the baby
[1:03:38] said brother branham will pray for that
[1:03:40] baby tonight and Who am I to pray for
[1:03:43] the baby if brother Brendan's gonna pray
[1:03:45] for the baby watch what he says now that
[1:03:48] was reverent
[1:03:50] and that was nice but that can't always
[1:03:52] be the will of God sometimes it's
[1:03:57] different amen this amendment we get
[1:03:59] superstitious about this stuff and then
[1:04:01] we know there's a need maybe in their
[1:04:03] own life you say well if I get a church
[1:04:05] son there if I can just get a hold of
[1:04:07] stone so if I call such-and-such a
[1:04:08] preacher if somebody comes by and
[1:04:10] there's a certain thing listen that's
[1:04:12] nice
[1:04:12] that's reverent but that can't always be
[1:04:15] the will of God beside where so much
[1:04:18] religion and so much preaching and so
[1:04:20] much preaching churches well it's all
[1:04:22] week we leave God on this building I've
[1:04:25] heard so much retarget sikri well if we
[1:04:27] come and we do this we do that my
[1:04:45] neighbor my child goes or something I've
[1:04:47] got to come on the scene
[1:04:49] I think for church so let's not just get
[1:05:10] an idea like this one listen she was
[1:05:13] ready to practice she saw that prayer
[1:05:14] card many times we're ready to do
[1:05:17] something for the Lord well somebody
[1:05:18] else will do it what God told you to do
[1:05:21] you need to go do it
[1:05:22] and then listen God was wanting that
[1:05:25] woman to do it you know the star in the
[1:05:27] moment anyway God put that on her heart
[1:05:30] and it was for a reason and God puts
[1:05:33] things on your heart amen
[1:05:35] don't ignore it or think it's something
[1:05:37] else but I want you to learn to
[1:05:39] recognize maybe in a greater way than
[1:05:40] you ever had before
[1:05:41] because maybe there's a need and you are
[1:05:45] the one that God is wanting to use to
[1:05:46] meet the need he might not want to use
[1:05:49] me to get it it might be you it might be
[1:05:52] you it could be me coming out whatever
[1:05:54] Amen but if God is speaking to us let's
[1:05:57] not get a traditional idea many times
[1:06:00] our traditions make the Word of God of
[1:06:02] none effect he says that can't always be
[1:06:07] the will of God sometimes it's different
[1:06:09] the Holy Spirit kept telling her go pray
[1:06:11] for that baby finally she thought so now
[1:06:14] we begin to rationalize like we do
[1:06:17] finally she's hard well that woman will
[1:06:19] turn me down cold knowing that she's got
[1:06:22] a prayer card she wouldn't want me to
[1:06:24] pray for that baby she brought that baby
[1:06:27] here not for me to pray for but for
[1:06:30] brother brand to pray for it well that's
[1:06:31] not why she brought the baby though she
[1:06:33] actually brought the baby there to the
[1:06:34] baby would be healed brother Brown was
[1:06:37] just the means of the end is that right
[1:06:38] but see how she did why nobody want me
[1:06:41] to pray amen brother Brown will pray for
[1:06:46] so the hatred the spirit kept saying go
[1:06:48] pray for that baby
[1:06:50] finally like I like this promoter wasn't
[1:06:54] even the best
[1:06:56] finally she's a while to relieve myself
[1:07:00] I'll just give her my seat sit honey
[1:07:04] would you want you got that baby we did
[1:07:06] it come sit here take my seat oh honey I
[1:07:08] don't want to take your seat I'm trying
[1:07:10] to keep the baby quiet oh but you look
[1:07:11] so tired and worn I should say well I am
[1:07:13] well sit down here and take my seat and
[1:07:17] she said I see you got a prayer card
[1:07:18] perhaps there's a brother I'm gonna pray
[1:07:20] for your baby she said well I hope this
[1:07:22] number will be called said well I do too
[1:07:25] unless she said well are you sister are
[1:07:27] you a Christian said oh yes Justin I'm a
[1:07:30] Christian too and said ever since I've
[1:07:33] been sitting here the Spirit of the Lord
[1:07:34] has been Tommy pray for that baby
[1:07:37] would you give me permission now what
[1:07:39] you think about that she rationalized
[1:07:41] their own mind already she don't want me
[1:07:43] to break I like it you know well if I
[1:07:45] pray for the baby maybe maybe something
[1:07:47] bad will happen like what we do amen
[1:07:52] what's that push they might turn me down
[1:07:54] and they'll be worse Wow well they might
[1:07:58] not want me to pray for him but what if
[1:08:00] gluttonous means my prayer well then
[1:08:02] you'll be in the exact same spot you're
[1:08:03] in any way trying to put some complex on
[1:08:14] well you're just not good enough you're
[1:08:15] not brother randomly you're not the past
[1:08:17] you're not us but your son would you
[1:08:27] give me permission let me give it
[1:08:29] permission would you give me permission
[1:08:32] I know brother Brown will proof that
[1:08:34] baby if it's called and you just keep
[1:08:35] holding your card he'll get it said but
[1:08:37] if I lay my hands upon the baby and just
[1:08:39] offer a little prayer to make myself
[1:08:41] feel better oh and get out from under
[1:08:45] what's calling me wouldn't offend you
[1:08:48] you know what she said I would offend me
[1:08:50] greatly don't you program I'm the only
[1:08:53] the prophet of God will pray from hi
[1:08:55] baby don't you go crazy
[1:08:58] I'll let somebody I'll call up Billy
[1:09:00] Paul and you get him on the phone

[1:09:24] to be even if you don't I'll take it
[1:09:27] Amen I believe in the power of prayer I
[1:09:29] believe it's in every Christian I

[1:09:33] weakness Christian Christians had pray

[1:12:03] God is owning you to do the supernatural
[1:12:06] you look more supernatural part here

[1:12:43] Lord I'm willing to be used by God I
[1:12:46] don't want to bluff about it or RV or
[1:12:49] fuss about I'd submit to it this man
[1:12:51] talks about I believe it's blasphemous
[1:12:53] names he said them men of old they're
[1:12:55] those apostles there were men a few
[1:12:56] words one
[1:12:59] they're wrong I said Lord let me be such
[1:13:03] a prisoner like the Apostle Paul we're
[1:13:05] gonna have to give me a flowchart and
[1:13:07] the play-by-play and enough information
[1:13:10] though I can understand it God just one
[1:13:12] word from you God - one little myth from
[1:13:19] God it's a commandment to me Maria she
[1:13:28] almost dropped out of her seat it
[1:13:32] reminds me of a I was reading the book
[1:13:34] of Acts of the night when Peter for the
[1:13:36] kids and peers in prison they're praying
[1:13:38] here's the man they're praying for we
[1:13:57] say oh that couldn't be me you're the
[1:14:04] one singing your brain don't be
[1:14:06] surprised that God answers prayer uh-huh
[1:14:12] praise the Lord
[1:14:14] that's pretty good Damon let's see if we
[1:14:18] understood how effective our prayers
[1:14:19] were we'd pray a lot more we wouldn't
[1:14:22] have to be told to pray we'd do it a man
[1:14:25] I don't know if I were sure my my little
[1:14:26] girl had testimony she was praying few
[1:14:28] years back we had real dry season up
[1:14:30] there where we're at in Van Wert and
[1:14:32] hadn't rained for weeks and she asked me
[1:14:34] Virginia after daddy can we pray for
[1:14:37] rain I said that's a good idea in the
[1:14:42] Bible Elijah was a passion he would know
[1:14:47] different you know and he prayed for
[1:14:49] instance we'd go and pray for she prayed
[1:14:52] for I went in the store and I come on
[1:14:54] ten minutes later and I tell you what he
[1:14:56] was pouring
[1:15:01] you can say what you want to think about
[1:15:03] that but I believe God answers the
[1:15:04] prayers of children he's hot listen he
[1:15:07] said to have a favorite child
[1:15:09] hey man how many sometimes we didn't
[1:15:12] have faith like that I don't have to
[1:15:15] have explained or drawn out something he
[1:15:17] said it I believe that settles it I'll
[1:15:21] tell you what my little girl one to pray
[1:15:22] a lot more after that
[1:15:25] you realize God hears your prayers and
[1:15:28] he wants to use you it'll change your
[1:15:30] whole attitude towards serving God this
[1:15:34] one my father overseen amen watch what
[1:15:37] the Prophet says here there's not what
[1:15:40] if she had not done that it's what I
[1:15:43] really want to come to with us tonight
[1:15:45] what if she had not done that what about
[1:15:48] him framed for that woman what if he'd
[1:15:50] not done that what if he just took some
[1:15:51] pills or what took a nap or whatever
[1:15:53] what if she had not done that see what I
[1:15:56] mean that woman would have hadn't made
[1:15:57] me more sympathy for that baby a mother
[1:15:59] to baby than I would and the mother
[1:16:01] being he says can we all do miracles yes
[1:16:05] can we all do miracles yes when you're
[1:16:09] directed by the Holy Ghost to do
[1:16:11] miracles God you ask seek again he's in
[1:16:16] us to do stuff hey man if he's in here
[1:16:19] he's gonna be rivers rivers of living
[1:16:22] water for the rest there was a truck too
[1:16:23] and then he's not a hot water heater in
[1:16:26] you he's not a kiddie pool in you
[1:16:28] he's got rivers coming up there's
[1:16:30] something you coming out to do something
[1:16:32] and listen I don't believe it's like
[1:16:35] that it wasn't no little trickle oh my
[1:16:37] goodness a man but the best is a big old
[1:16:39] Gus shirt come on Smita rock amen I
[1:16:42] believe is enough brought you here
[1:16:43] tonight we could just tap into it my
[1:16:47] face
[1:16:48] God could mean everything
[1:16:50] [Applause]
[1:16:54] anyone in bondage amen we we don't
[1:16:58] suffer tonight from a lack of resources
[1:17:00] and then we're not suffering Zach
[1:17:03] because there's not enough power to get
[1:17:05] the job done
[1:17:06] brother rested we got untapped resources
[1:17:09] brother I tell you what if a surveyor
[1:17:11] came out here tomorrow and he checked
[1:17:13] this church out and he found out there
[1:17:15] was a big thing of oil under this church
[1:17:17] you'd have a big decision to make
[1:17:19] amen none of that resources that would
[1:17:22] change how you treat this problem I
[1:17:24] don't forget another building what you
[1:17:25] want to do one big go pump out here hey
[1:17:27] man when you realize what you got
[1:17:29] available and the devil election is
[1:17:38] going to think you're just an ordinary
[1:17:39] person nothing ordinary about you now if
[1:17:50] that woman would not have carried out
[1:17:52] what God told her perhaps they've been a
[1:17:53] rebuke in the spirit to her she
[1:17:55] disobeyed God amen think about what
[1:17:57] would happen that baby if that woman is
[1:17:59] this thing God had an that uncle's had a
[1:18:01] nag her into it but I don't want to say
[1:18:02] it that way but he had to really pull
[1:18:04] out every man who pray for the baby
[1:18:06] would pray for the baby because he
[1:18:07] wanted to do it and that's how he wanted
[1:18:09] to do it
[1:18:10] and she hadn't done it what would hurt
[1:18:13] him into that baby than that mother what
[1:18:15] you think about every smart with your
[1:18:16] own life if God is wanting to use you
[1:18:19] certainly if you're not really Cernan -
[1:18:22] what's it mean maybe maybe the person
[1:18:24] sitting next year maybe a lost them
[1:18:26] maybe someone you don't even know yet
[1:18:29] amen
[1:18:30] he says this always always if you are a
[1:18:36] Christian something is persuaded to do
[1:18:39] something go do it and he says again go
[1:18:43] do it
[1:18:44] don't doubt it go do it I think you wish
[1:18:46] to go do it
[1:18:47] he's trying to emphasize something there
[1:18:49] amen don't doubt it good it's like I
[1:18:52] said this woman she had nothing to lose
[1:18:54] really and then we act like we're gonna
[1:18:58] lose out if we pray for somebody or
[1:19:01] share a message with
[1:19:03] amen well listen I said I look I've done
[1:19:08] I've been that way before look up here
[1:19:10] all holier than thou now go get that
[1:19:12] from me I've done the same thing I love
[1:19:15] no point in doing that that's pointless
[1:19:18] you don't know listen when Jesus tells
[1:19:21] the parable the seats are their master
[1:19:23] team that he just thrown it everywhere
[1:19:25] he throws on stony ground he throws it
[1:19:29] on the path but he's not worried about
[1:19:31] running out hey man where it goes
[1:19:35] determines what turns out listen that
[1:19:36] sheets over he's not worried about it he
[1:19:39] throws it out there hey man listen I'd
[1:19:42] rather be guilty throw it out there and
[1:19:44] land on the wrong ground they're not
[1:19:46] throwing out there in missed the right
[1:19:47] ground well I'm not trying to sound glib
[1:19:54] but it's true we we act like we're gonna
[1:19:56] man
[1:19:58] well my co-workers there they're gonna
[1:20:01] think I'm a Holy Roller think you won
[1:20:04] already
[1:20:05] Williams just tell you now huh
[1:20:07] especially you sisters if you're out
[1:20:09] there in the world and they're gonna
[1:20:10] think you're nuts anyway they're gonna
[1:20:12] call you might as well get started now
[1:20:16] what are we worried about anyway I ain't
[1:20:20] doing this because I'm trying to impress
[1:20:21] nobody all right if I see one salt
[1:20:25] listen one salt sweet ten thousand words
[1:20:29] listen they can go to a ballgame you get
[1:20:31] excited they can they can go with honor
[1:20:33] get excited over there their
[1:20:34] presidential nominee when they get
[1:20:36] exciting though rhyme the streets no
[1:20:38] carinii but when one soul comes a guy
[1:20:42] because results rocks and excites me the
[1:20:48] sea got boost something for every one of
[1:20:49] his little laflamme's I'll be honest
[1:20:57] maybe it sounds silly but listen if I
[1:21:00] come to church
[1:21:06] I'm happy for you sure about that
[1:21:36] oh man I tell you what I hear that and I
[1:21:39] began to get excited I get a little
[1:21:41] victory next thing I know c1 is honored
[1:21:44] we're all so then if we're part of the
[1:21:59] same body
[1:22:00] there's no schism then it's in our best
[1:22:03] interest of the other is less so why
[1:22:05] wouldn't I pray for you why wouldn't I
[1:22:07] want them hey man why would you want to
[1:22:09] bless one another remember this is why I
[1:22:13] say this many times we miss
[1:22:14] opportunities do something for the Lord
[1:22:17] because we mistake it as a as a personal
[1:22:21] trial or a personal issue there's
[1:22:22] something wrong with me
[1:22:23] and what I'm saying tonight is if you're
[1:22:27] a Christian God has more confidence in
[1:22:29] you than you realize amen
[1:22:31] that was the remarkable thing about job
[1:22:33] listen it's not remarkable that a man
[1:22:35] should have conferencing it is in this
[1:22:36] day and age but the idea that a mention
[1:22:38] of confidence God everybody should have
[1:22:40] confidence in God God can't fail and you
[1:22:42] can't live really spiritually and
[1:22:46] some staff conferencing god that's
[1:22:48] another thing when you always God have
[1:22:49] put confidence in you not in your flesh
[1:22:52] and your natural belly but in the
[1:22:54] Lucky's place in you he's got enough
[1:22:56] confidence in you that he wants to
[1:22:57] intercede through you he wants to speak
[1:23:00] to you he wants to minister to you
[1:23:02] that's a marvelous thing we don't want
[1:23:05] to take it for granted
[1:23:08] because we do many times amen
[1:23:11] that's trying to get our attention and
[1:23:13] we think it's just us we think were
[1:23:15] going through a crisis what do you think
[1:23:17] is what's wrong I think God's actually
[1:23:19] trying to get our attention
[1:23:20] no brother Brent talks about his own
[1:23:22] life he talks about I believe it's in
[1:23:24] the Uniting same time he said he'd
[1:23:26] prayed to God because he had tension in
[1:23:29] his life he's familiar with this but he
[1:23:30] had a tension in his life and he he
[1:23:32] prayed God would take that tension from
[1:23:34] his life and I want shows God never took
[1:23:36] that tension from his life but he took
[1:23:38] the fear of it out of his life
[1:23:41] see the tension actually made him who he
[1:23:43] was he said I might not even be a
[1:23:47] Christian without that time listen that
[1:23:49] nervousness that that bit on edge it's
[1:23:51] cuz he was built that way it was for a
[1:23:54] reason God couldn't take that from him
[1:23:57] without changing who he was but he took
[1:24:00] the fear of it away and that's what I
[1:24:03] want you tonight to realize that don't
[1:24:05] be afraid if God has used you or if
[1:24:07] you're going through this rings a bell
[1:24:09] if this resonates with you if you
[1:24:12] realizes God speaking you don't be
[1:24:13] afraid of a bird and don't be afraid of
[1:24:15] maybe Daniel look what he went through
[1:24:18] it's for a reason and when you realize
[1:24:21] that it takes the fear of it away cuz
[1:24:24] that's what's the real problem is the
[1:24:25] fear of it Amen I give it I talk about
[1:24:28] time others at the home church I give an
[1:24:29] example I said if I woke up and I come
[1:24:31] to church here tonight and I said in the
[1:24:33] vine awesome my stomach just hurt like
[1:24:35] there was a knife in my stomach and I
[1:24:36] was up here I get I'd probably shut down
[1:24:38] the server three quick and then I'd be
[1:24:41] concerned I didn't know what's wrong did
[1:24:42] I eat something there's something
[1:24:44] happened you know handsome
[1:24:45] I wouldn't know what's wrong and I'd go
[1:24:47] to the hospital or whatever because of
[1:24:49] the fear of it amen but if that same
[1:24:52] service I cover tonight and and a
[1:24:54] brother comes in here comes a brother
[1:24:56] Brian a big 300 foot
[1:24:57] pound gorilla of a man comes in and he
[1:24:59] wants to slug him and I jump in the way
[1:25:01] and I take that blow for him listen it's
[1:25:04] gonna hurt just as much it's gonna make
[1:25:06] me suffer just as much but I'm not gonna
[1:25:08] be afraid I know I know
[1:25:13] and because I know why not only will I
[1:25:16] do it I would do it again do it again
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:26] [Applause]
[1:25:32] and then when you realize what it is
[1:25:35] when you even your trials your trials
[1:25:38] they're not they're not pointless the
[1:25:41] trial your faith is worth more than gold
[1:25:43] trying to fire we don't really sit that
[1:25:45] way when we go through it but how many
[1:25:48] can testify you've been through a trial
[1:25:50] and you went through it and maybe you Co
[1:25:52] along years later and you run into
[1:25:53] something they're going through the
[1:25:54] exact same thing and you can stand and
[1:25:59] testify
[1:26:00] I'm know God is faithful I know exactly
[1:26:03] what you're talking about
[1:26:04] I've gone through that and I know that
[1:26:06] the same did for me can do it for you
[1:26:10] listen your trials and the burdens of
[1:26:13] things you go through there for a reason
[1:26:14] and when you realize it it takes the
[1:26:17] fear of it away I'm not saying not gonna
[1:26:19] have trials can't make that promise that
[1:26:21] would be a lot through much tribulation
[1:26:23] we do enter the kingdom amen yeah I
[1:26:25] can't say nothing to have trials but I
[1:26:27] could strike and testify he'll take you
[1:26:29] through and I can't say that you'll
[1:26:31] never get a burden but I can testify
[1:26:33] I'll help you bear the burden and then
[1:26:35] he'll make a way when there's no leg and
[1:26:37] that's the miraculous thing
[1:26:43] see now you're not afraid of the pain
[1:26:46] little more my children I mean how many
[1:26:49] parents you see your kids sick you saw
[1:26:51] if I could just take that for them I
[1:26:53] would be sick listen your heavenly
[1:26:55] father already did it for you if you
[1:26:58] feel that way how much more does God
[1:27:01] feel that way in you so don't be
[1:27:03] surprised when you go through this it's
[1:27:06] gone in here he's actually entering in
[1:27:09] in you to the infirmary the Bible tells
[1:27:13] us to endure hardness as a good soldier
[1:27:17] a man I like that and do hardness as a
[1:27:22] soldier soldier sometimes I gotta take
[1:27:24] some blows cuz it's part of the job and
[1:27:26] then it didn't say to her hardness as a
[1:27:28] victim didn't say didn't do her hardness
[1:27:30] the song has got rougher than everybody
[1:27:32] else you endure hardness as a soldier
[1:27:34] listen that soldier when he's enlisted
[1:27:36] he knows he's gonna go through fights he
[1:27:39] knows he's gonna be attacked but he
[1:27:40] knows he's gonna win in the end
[1:27:42] if he's got the right kind of leadership
[1:27:44] he's in the right army hey man listen
[1:27:46] captain you're gonna listen there's a
[1:27:58] reason you wear armor hey men you're
[1:28:01] you're expected to take some gloves
[1:28:02] we've expected some fiery dark to come
[1:28:05] our way and then that's why you've got a
[1:28:07] ship listen if I tell you what let's
[1:28:11] just one of these guys camps out in the
[1:28:13] foxhole and lets the girls do the
[1:28:14] fighting y'all I'm on a wall hey man one
[1:28:17] of these guys with the Stolen Valor
[1:28:18] listen if you're lifted and you're in
[1:28:21] the fight you're gonna be attacked
[1:28:22] you're gonna get hit but listen you
[1:28:24] don't have to get defeated cuz you've
[1:28:26] got on the armor that can take every
[1:28:28] blow give that a shield that can quench
[1:28:31] every fiery darling and you've got a
[1:28:33] sword it can cut through their soul and
[1:28:35] spirit to the dividing asunder of the
[1:28:38] Johnson Larry
[1:28:39] listen you've got the weapon to defeat
[1:28:41] the devil when the doctor don't have it
[1:28:46] and the psychologist don't have it and
[1:28:47] politics don't happen the banker don't
[1:28:49] have it you've got the answer to the
[1:28:51] devil's question Paul talks to the
[1:29:01] bottom and he's striving for masteries

[1:29:12] know they're gonna get hit probably I
[1:29:14] want at least once or twice less they
[1:29:15] just toilet lay the guy out and then
[1:29:18] it's expected but they're conditioned
[1:29:21] because they know that they can give it
[1:29:23] a lot better than they take it and then
[1:29:26] if I get hit this much I'm gonna hit him
[1:29:27] back twice as hard I know that I can in
[1:29:30] do her and hit a lot harder than the

[1:33:20] deal with the Corinthian church
[1:33:21] they've got least chief apostle there
[1:33:23] trying to take his place
[1:33:24] there are boast about their credentials
[1:33:26] and their boast about how spiritual
[1:33:28] they're you know what Paul said I'm
[1:33:29] gonna Gloria my infirmities a little bit
[1:33:31] let's not suffered for this church I
[1:33:33] ain't kind of difficult see I was
[1:33:36] imprisoned I was beaten I was
[1:33:37] shipwrecked that's what he could boast
[1:33:40] um I was willing to suffer for the
[1:33:44] people of God Daniel had to suffer he
[1:33:48] could go first and things but think of
[1:33:51] what it was when it coming on the other
[1:33:53] end what a testimony in that wasn't
[1:33:56] overcoming that's what I want my life
[1:33:59] amen
[1:34:00] he never promised me a trial free
[1:34:02] existence so I might as well quit trying

[1:34:06] it but what I want to see the victory if
[1:34:08] I gotta go three Lord let me come out
