[37:56] alleluia alleluia a man you love him
[38:01] this morning
[38:02] and which really what a precious a
[38:05] precious testimony that that is when we
[38:08] can truly have that confession that it
[38:10] is indeed wealth that is that is a very
[38:16] very precious reality we just want to
[38:19] say greetings to our visitors here this
[38:22] morning may God bless each and every one
[38:25] of you and I won't try to call you by
[38:28] name because I believe in somebody out
[38:31] but we want to just remind you we'd sent
[38:35] out the email in regarding to that of
[38:37] the rescheduling of brother George Smith
[38:39] where he was supposed to be here with us
[38:40] this past Thursday and Friday and then
[38:43] from the weather so that's been
[38:46] rescheduled February the 8th and
[38:49] February the 9th to ask you to keep that
[38:51] in prayer also I think it was mentioned
[38:55] as well but let's keep the Costello
[38:57] family and prayer brother bill Costello
[38:59] brother passed away suddenly yesterday
[39:02] so let's remember them in prayer just
[39:06] comfort them in this time also for
[39:10] brother Davis he over the crest is here
[39:13] but mister crest the Lord willing we'll
[39:16] be going home on January the 23rd that's
[39:20] been that's been a month's ordeal it's
[39:24] been there but yet within it all God has
[39:27] been proving himself many UPS many downs
[39:33] but yet in the midst of it God has
[39:34] proven himself faithful let's just
[39:37] continue to hold our sister up in prayer
[39:39] before the throne of God I
[39:42] I always admonish you in doing that
[39:43] because sometimes when we see someone
[39:46] maybe they can finally make it here and
[39:48] it's like we'll let up on praying with
[39:50] if God would have let up on Peter when
[39:53] Peters shackles would have been off he
[39:55] still was in prison but they kept
[39:58] praying until he showed up there at the
[40:01] house I believe when God God's desire
[40:04] that when we go when we're praying for
[40:07] things we want
[40:08] we know that God's desires for full
[40:10] deliverance and so let's continue keep
[40:13] sister crescent prayer she's doing very
[40:16] well brother David had text me in
[40:18] regards to the therapy that she's been
[40:21] going through and even within the lungs
[40:23] just a clear report on that so we give
[40:26] the door sister Carmen Bosley in prayer
[40:41] as well she's recovering there at home I
[40:44] know that as I spoke to her last night
[40:46] and even her husband Michael had called
[40:50] me and they just they just were
[40:53] astounded by breath during the time of
[40:58] the food and different ones that's when
[41:00] over with them and even as sharing the
[41:03] food that was broadened going over and
[41:05] praying with her that was just you know
[41:08] the thing when you would come down to
[41:09] fit into these times like this we are a
[41:12] body if the greatest Dettman that we can
[41:18] do is operate independently amen we are
[41:21] a body and and the work of how God moves
[41:24] within our lives in it that's it's a
[41:26] witness you know we can speak about a
[41:28] lot of things but this was this has been
[41:31] such a witness and her husband had
[41:33] called me there on the phone on Friday
[41:34] and he said I I don't know what to say I
[41:36] don't know what to say he said I've
[41:38] never seen this before in my life
[41:40] so you know it the one thing we won't we
[41:43] definitely want to ask God to help us to
[41:46] be tender and be sensitive to the needs
[41:49] of one another within the body amen and
[41:53] sometimes you know as we've said before
[41:54] it's not just even food but even through
[41:57] things that you can have others that are
[41:58] here that maybe you don't know they're
[42:01] going through anything physically or
[42:02] whatever but just sometimes a kind word
[42:05] sometimes a car sometimes just a phone
[42:10] call sometimes just the text and you
[42:12] know just something like that that God
[42:15] can really speak and encourage his
[42:17] people with and I'm so thankful for the
[42:20] body of Jesus
[42:21] I watch you I'm think I'm so so thankful
[42:25] for not only the part that's here but I
[42:28] think before the body of Jesus Christ
[42:30] around the world amen we want to before
[42:34] as we turn our attention to the word we
[42:36] want to lift the mission offering this
[42:38] morning and and then go right into the
[42:41] word so if the brothers will come if
[42:42] you'd like to stand with me and
[42:44] musicians I'm finished we'll go right
[42:50] into the word from here also would we
[42:55] mention to you that as it comes as you
[43:01] just would remember it continue remember
[43:04] the column brother the Collins family
[43:06] and the Thompson family in prayer and
[43:08] that the Lord would just continue to to
[43:11] strengthen them as it comes to your
[43:14] heart just continue to to keep them in
[43:16] prayer amen so let's just pray here
[43:24] Heavenly Father Lord as we turn our
[43:27] attention Lord God to you Lord into the
[43:32] word this morning
[43:33] Lord we stand here in great need Lord
[43:37] because without you Lord Jesus were as
[43:40] helpless as helpless can be father the
[43:43] Lord we're looking to you that you would
[43:45] just Lord and move on the scene among us
[43:48] in a very special and very personal way
[43:50] Lord that you would just come Lord and
[43:53] fulfill what you have determined and
[43:56] desire to be fulfilled in this service
[43:58] Lord may our faith Lord may it rise
[44:02] within you Lord and may you grant to
[44:05] each and every part in every life Lord
[44:07] those desires that Lord that they have
[44:10] in you I pray that Lord that you would
[44:12] just receive all the glory Lord just
[44:15] meet us Lord here this morning Lord God
[44:18] as we Lord desire to look into your word
[44:21] and we know that we need you Lord to to
[44:24] take us in Lord and that our
[44:26] understanding would be open father Lord
[44:29] we pray that as we lift Lord this
[44:31] mission offering now Lord we ask that
[44:33] God that you'll take father
[44:35] and Lord that you would multiply and
[44:38] direct it or God the Father Lord by your
[44:41] spirit Lord Jesus we pray Lord we just
[44:45] want to give you all the honor and glory
[44:47] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[44:50] amen as we look here in the word here
[44:56] for a few moments let's go to Luke
[44:58] chapter 1 verse 67 I just pray that the
[45:10] God will just help me to deliver this
[45:12] this morning the part of this as he is
[45:15] so pressed it on my heart
[45:27] in in Luke chapter 1 verse 67 I'm just
[45:32] gonna read these scriptures here just to
[45:34] take a background and set a direction of
[45:36] where we're going to go and his father
[45:39] Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost
[45:42] and prophesied saying blessed be the
[45:45] Lord God of Israel for he hath visited
[45:48] and redeemed his people and hath raised
[45:52] him up and horn of salvation for us in
[45:55] the house of his servant David as he
[45:58] spake by the mouth of his holy prophets
[46:01] which have been since the world began
[46:04] that we should be saved from our enemies
[46:06] and from the hand of all that haida to
[46:10] perform the mercy promised to our
[46:13] fathers and to remember his holy
[46:15] Covenant the oath which he sware to our
[46:19] father Abraham that he would grant unto
[46:21] us that we being delivered out of the
[46:24] hand of our enemy might serve him
[46:27] without fear in holiness and
[46:30] righteousness before him all the days of
[46:34] our life may God bless you and bless the
[46:37] reading of the word as you're being
[46:38] seated I'd like to just take a thought
[46:45] from here and we've really been the
[46:48] mercy of God I'd like to look at that
[46:51] thought on that he performed his promise
[46:56] mercy and when we look at it here in the
[47:02] scriptures where we would draw this from
[47:04] in verse 72 and verse 73 that God's
[47:09] coming in the fulfillment of his word
[47:13] all that he has spoken and everything
[47:16] has has spoke to one great achievement
[47:20] that that God would have and we see how
[47:24] that everything you know God and how
[47:27] that he would direct the prophets and
[47:28] and his servants everything was so
[47:31] focused on this coming of of salvation
[47:34] and of this Redemption that God had
[47:37] promised and when we look at it the
[47:41] that this the performing of the mercy
[47:44] that is promised I I think of the
[47:46] scripture here that is just just so
[47:49] precious that had just been looking at
[47:51] in Micah 7:20 and hear Micah at the end
[47:55] of this chapter he says thou wilt
[47:57] perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy
[48:00] to Abraham which thou has sworn unto our
[48:04] fathers from the days of old and I'll
[48:07] tell you without God's mercy you and I
[48:11] would stand hopeless if it was not for
[48:16] the mercy of God so when we look at that
[48:21] that performing of his mercy that mercy
[48:25] that was promised we we recognize that
[48:28] it's God he's coming to fulfill his word
[48:31] God is not going to do something outside
[48:35] of his word now we understand that God
[48:38] when God reveals his word that God can
[48:42] add to that revelation by unfolding more
[48:46] of an understanding that lays sealed
[48:48] within that revelation such as when he
[48:51] gave the revelation of the coming son
[48:53] and of that seed and God continued to
[48:56] unfold all that was within that
[48:59] revelation of the promised Messiah and
[49:01] how that you know it would come through
[49:03] Abraham and then how that here coming
[49:05] through that of the of the lineage of
[49:07] David God is is unfolding all that was
[49:10] within that revelation at first and he
[49:12] unfolds when it is necessary that his
[49:16] people would need to know these things
[49:19] and be directed by that word yet we know
[49:22] that it's God after the word has been
[49:25] spoken God Himself comes behind his word
[49:28] to fulfill that word and to confirm it
[49:31] and when we look at this of the great
[49:33] mercy of God I think of how that when
[49:36] I've studied and been just studying this
[49:38] on for weeks of of the great mercy of
[49:41] Almighty God and many of the of the
[49:43] writers and things like that or the
[49:45] rabbi's and different ones they refer to
[49:47] this great mercy of God of the word that
[49:50] is used
[49:51] in many instances of his sad which is
[49:53] his goodness and his faithfulness and
[49:55] his kindness but yet it's as as that
[49:58] would be emphasized that it's not just a
[50:01] steadfastness we we we are thankful that
[50:04] God is faithful to his word but yet if
[50:07] that faithfulness is without love a
[50:10] steadfastness of loved and the
[50:12] faithfulness itself we would all be
[50:14] dissolved and swallowed up but there
[50:17] must be a steadfastness in love and in
[50:19] other words God is not fulfilling his
[50:22] word out of mere duty it's just
[50:25] something that he has to do that that's
[50:27] not how God fulfills his word when God
[50:30] fulfills that this promise to you and
[50:33] and confirms it to your life as he's
[50:35] confirmed it to our life when he moves -
[50:37] you know - to move within your life
[50:40] that's God fulfilling his word not out
[50:42] of duty he's fulfilling it out of his
[50:45] love to his word and how that you have
[50:48] given yourself to that word to say Lord
[50:50] I believe what you said and I believe
[50:53] that that's from me Lord and God moves
[50:56] with it with a great love to fulfill his
[50:58] word and I'm grateful for that and we
[51:01] look at that one of the things that has
[51:03] stuck out to me within that of thee of
[51:05] the riders as hound that when we look at
[51:09] the mercy of God one described the mercy
[51:11] of God to be likened to that of the glue
[51:14] of the Covenant if there was not
[51:17] anything that would hold to the Covenant
[51:20] more mercy itself it brings where God
[51:23] Himself is not just committed to his
[51:25] word but I want you to think of this for
[51:28] a moment just let me drop this for a
[51:29] moment if God is fulfilling his word and
[51:33] he's having to look at everything all of
[51:36] the mistakes and all the failures and
[51:38] everything else if there's not a
[51:41] something that is present where God
[51:43] Himself is able to fulfill his word then
[51:46] here is God coming to fulfill his word
[51:48] and here he is having to overstep all of
[51:51] these all of these faults all these
[51:53] mistakes all these shortcomings but it's
[51:56] within him to take care of all of these
[51:59] things I hope you're with me this
[52:02] morning on that that another
[52:04] words God cannot go ahead and fulfill
[52:06] his word with the grudge God cannot
[52:09] fulfill his word was something in his
[52:11] heart are you with me so it so there
[52:14] must be that of a resolve for God to be
[52:17] able to move forward and fulfill his
[52:20] word because as God is dealing with
[52:23] humanity but yet God is looking deeper
[52:26] than just your flesh or my flesh he's
[52:29] looking down into the depths of our
[52:31] heart and that's the whole thing that
[52:33] God desires to woo to himself and we
[52:36] find that within here that God Himself
[52:39] begins to make a way and I'll refer to
[52:41] different places in the scripture here
[52:43] but if we find that God himself makes a
[52:46] promise here in genesis 3:15 after the
[52:49] fall has come about God makes a promise
[52:52] and this promise is in his mercy they
[52:55] Adam and Eve at that point we started to
[52:58] look at a little bit last week but they
[53:00] didn't deserve this but yet God steps
[53:03] forward and he performs his mercy in
[53:08] that he says I will give I will put
[53:11] enmity between thee and the woman and
[53:13] between thy seed and her seed and it
[53:16] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[53:18] bruise his heel God himself
[53:21] already he's promised now within just
[53:23] this verse of scripture think of this
[53:25] just this one verse of scripture lays
[53:28] even they-they fulfillment and the whole
[53:31] advent of the Messiah within this verse
[53:33] of scripture steps out not only that the
[53:36] Gentile ages but men in the millennium
[53:38] the future whom all because of this
[53:40] scripture here God
[53:42] uttering his word and it is by virtue of
[53:45] a promise there is nothing in this
[53:48] promise that contains if nothing there's
[53:53] no if in this promise but God has
[53:56] declared I will then you find of how
[54:00] that God he moves you know after the
[54:03] dealings in the times of Noah and God he
[54:06] moves to deal with an Abraham and that's
[54:09] what
[54:10] to work with here this morning of how
[54:11] that God dealing with Abraham's life
[54:15] because here God has said he's going to
[54:17] perform and we know that he did that but
[54:20] we see even the culmination in our day
[54:22] and time and even after were taken off
[54:25] of the performing of the mercy that is
[54:27] promised there to Abraham and to the
[54:29] patriarchs and to all the father's all
[54:32] that oath that he had made and we see in
[54:34] in Genesis 12 verse 1 where God speaks
[54:38] to Abraham and verse 1 and verse 2 and
[54:40] verse 3 and God lets him know I get the
[54:43] out of the land or the country from your
[54:46] kindred and from your father's house and
[54:48] unto a land that I will show thee and I
[54:51] will make thee a great nation and I will
[54:54] bless thee and make thy name great and
[54:56] thou shalt be a blessing and I will
[54:59] bless them that bless thee and curse
[55:01] them that curse thee and in thee shall
[55:02] all the families of the earth be blessed
[55:05] right here just even within the very
[55:08] first three verses which we know were
[55:11] already uttered to Abraham when he was
[55:13] down there in the earth of Chaldees God
[55:16] has already laid down there is and there
[55:19] is an issuing in of promise right here
[55:23] that is not an issuing of if but God has
[55:26] said I will this is God himself it when
[55:30] you notice I will it's not we will but I
[55:34] will God's not needing the we it's that
[55:38] I'm gonna perform this I will do this so
[55:42] all of those things that are laid out
[55:43] and and brother Brennan puts it like
[55:45] this and the message the masterpiece he
[55:47] said we begin now taking man he began
[55:50] now taking man from his covenants of
[55:52] saying that if you will I will and he
[55:55] began with the man called Abraham and he
[55:58] gave to Abraham a covenant
[56:00] unconditionally and every time he would
[56:03] start a masterpiece
[56:05] Satan would get in because the word when
[56:09] he started with Abraham he said I've
[56:11] already done it now this is
[56:13] unconditionally not that if you will I
[56:15] will but I've already done it he said
[56:18] now the great sculptor he is deep
[56:21] termined to have this masterpiece this
[56:26] is God's perfect will this is God's
[56:31] determination it's not it didn't enter
[56:34] in with will yet God never here and even
[56:37] in the very beginning in the Garden of
[56:39] Eden God gave His Word and God even in
[56:43] the giving of that word the conditions
[56:45] if you will do this then I will do this
[56:47] if you will do this I will do this
[56:49] everything it was based on a condition
[56:52] but here God has given his covenant
[56:55] unconditionally non conditionally
[56:58] doesn't mean that there's nothing for us
[57:00] but yet be unconditional part is that he
[57:03] himself is the performer of his own work
[57:06] he's the one who makes the promise he's
[57:08] the one the performance but yet it
[57:11] requires us to believe but you and I can
[57:13] not even believe unless he gifts us to
[57:16] be able to believe so it's all coming
[57:18] back to him but he's determined to have
[57:24] this masterpiece and he goes on and
[57:26] talks about our Abraham from the
[57:28] patriarchs he said now what God was
[57:30] doing he's rebuilding the masterpiece
[57:33] that is fallen you know you would think
[57:35] that even go directly when building the
[57:37] masterpiece that was fallen you would
[57:39] think that he would do it directly to
[57:41] making a man once again or bringing
[57:43] forth that image but God remember his
[57:46] image everything all of God's works they
[57:49] have foundation they have foundation is
[57:54] that right
[57:54] yet God doesn't move outside of the
[57:57] foundation of his word anything that God
[57:59] does he moves by the foundation of his
[58:01] word so God just did not start and start
[58:04] immediately with working and laying in
[58:06] the imagery of the body there but God is
[58:08] laying a foundation now we see the the
[58:11] you know the the counter to that even
[58:13] when you look in the book of Revelation
[58:15] when it talks about that beast that is
[58:17] sending you know in and out of the pit
[58:19] and it had no foundations there's
[58:22] nothing to base it on but see God
[58:24] Himself he has a foundation when God
[58:26] doesn't work there's a foundation and he
[58:28] wants this to be very clear that the
[58:31] film
[58:31] son of his image and masterpiece is
[58:35] going to be the foundation that is
[58:37] rooted in faith in love in grace and
[58:40] imperfection all of this is going to be
[58:43] a foundation I'll tell you that is the
[58:46] foundation and the cornerstone of Jesus
[58:49] Christ himself that is the foundation of
[58:52] which the Church of the Living God is
[58:55] built upon is the very election and
[58:57] faith and grace and love and perfection
[59:01] of the Lord Jesus Christ God has set
[59:04] forth this foundation got a foundation
[59:08] so God as he's preparing that foundation
[59:12] and you you look at how Abraham of where
[59:14] God has said I will and I will and you
[59:17] know we were understand that Abraham
[59:19] himself he's ordained this is what I
[59:22] want you to keep in mind I want you to
[59:23] keep that in mind of this mercy of God
[59:26] it being the glue to the Covenant here
[59:29] is Abraham and God speaks to him he's
[59:31] down in a condition that is not a
[59:34] condition that would merit nor would it
[59:37] invite that of God speaking to him but
[59:39] God speaks to Abraham and Abraham begins
[59:44] to respond he he's uniting with that
[59:46] voice he walks out of the land and yet
[59:48] or out of there of the earth Cal DC
[59:52] comes into the land of promise as much
[59:54] as Abraham is ordained I want you to
[59:58] catch this as much as he's ordained he's
[1:00:02] got to come God's provided way then may
[1:00:07] seem like an awful simple statement but
[1:00:09] just because he's ordained does not mean
[1:00:12] that God is going to pass by certain
[1:00:14] things in his life
[1:00:16] what is that the mercy of God the mercy
[1:00:18] of God is not passing over your
[1:00:20] difficulties your problems all your
[1:00:23] troubles that is not God's mercy passing
[1:00:26] over but his mercy is to supply the
[1:00:29] antidote and what is needed in order to
[1:00:32] bring about what each
[1:00:34] Oh glory be to God so he had to come
[1:00:38] God's God's provided way and he did come
[1:00:42] God's provided way he showed it was
[1:00:44] displayed it was displayed that it was
[1:00:47] of the four donación of Almighty God
[1:00:50] he display of the prevailing power of a
[1:00:54] gene of God laying in a life it actually
[1:00:58] displayed that and showed and here you
[1:01:00] find Abraham here he comes into a
[1:01:03] situation he's in the land and I know
[1:01:06] these things are familiar but I want you
[1:01:08] to just take account of this he's in the
[1:01:11] land and a famine comes up and Abraham
[1:01:15] goes down he begins to go down into
[1:01:17] Egypt and sojourn there God never told
[1:01:20] him to go down there God never let him
[1:01:24] to go down there but Abraham walking by
[1:01:27] his own natural sights and you know what
[1:01:29] this is what Abraham this is a part of
[1:01:32] Abram this is what Abram there's no
[1:01:34] doubt about it
[1:01:35] this is what he's always done when
[1:01:37] trouble has come are you with me see
[1:01:41] these are the thing maybe his daddy was
[1:01:43] that way as well maybe his great
[1:01:44] grandpappy was that way all of this but
[1:01:47] you see God did not make a choice in
[1:01:49] time the choice was made before anything
[1:01:53] else existed yet God chose his word and
[1:01:57] his word will prevail
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:01] so he's acting he just is a normal
[1:02:04] action flight from something just take
[1:02:07] off and run and it goes down and he
[1:02:09] tells the lie that he tells but I want
[1:02:13] you to notice this I want you to think
[1:02:15] of this for him this is something might
[1:02:17] seem so simple but I want you to
[1:02:19] consider this what if God had not showed
[1:02:22] up to Pharaoh what if God had not showed
[1:02:26] up to Pharaoh you say by the Samuel the
[1:02:28] mercy of God would have overrode no
[1:02:30] God's mercy does not override his word
[1:02:34] his mercy works in unity with his word
[1:02:38] as a matter of fact that
[1:02:40] mercy is his own person the angel of his
[1:02:45] presence that's his mercy Amen to come
[1:02:49] and and bring that word into fulfillment
[1:02:51] but notice here's Abraham I wonder what
[1:02:54] Abraham was doing he saved as far as
[1:03:00] maja you know my life is spared I'll
[1:03:03] tell you everything is good truth man
[1:03:05] that was a tight fix my goodness I'm
[1:03:07] glad we got out of that but you see
[1:03:09] God's looking beyond Abraham's not
[1:03:12] seeing the seriousness of this because
[1:03:15] what he doesn't know God knows God knows
[1:03:17] that Sarah is the appointed wound Sarah
[1:03:20] his part of the promise God knows that
[1:03:22] but in the midst of it see Abraham could
[1:03:25] not even keep what God gave him the deep
[1:03:29] God never told him to leave the Lamb
[1:03:32] Abraham could not keep that he ran from
[1:03:35] that but yet in the mess and mercy of
[1:03:38] God the grace of God the Prophet calls
[1:03:41] it like this he said the grace of God
[1:03:44] appeared to Abraham how did it appear to
[1:03:49] Abraham by declaring to Pharaoh the
[1:03:52] woman you have she belongs to that man
[1:03:55] that was God's grace it was not Abraham
[1:03:59] Abraham wasn't over there oh god please
[1:04:01] Lord send a visitation to pharaoh lord
[1:04:04] please send a visitation let me tell you
[1:04:06] something this was not abraham's
[1:04:08] determination this is god's
[1:04:11] determination amen as far as with
[1:04:15] abraham this would have been it but god
[1:04:18] is determined and God's grace moves in
[1:04:22] his mercy in the fulfillment of that
[1:04:24] word I tell you you know it's like the
[1:04:26] Prophet puts that he says Abraham tested
[1:04:28] God's patience
[1:04:29] and he said we test God's patience
[1:04:32] that's the truth God told him one thing
[1:04:37] and he went and did another thing if it
[1:04:40] was just God just looking at his word
[1:04:42] and mercy was not there it would have
[1:04:45] been done but you see God has confidence
[1:04:48] that he is the one and he will bring
[1:04:51] forth
[1:04:52] what are you spoken hey man you believe
[1:04:55] that we are part of that word that word
[1:04:58] that God Himself that word has God spoke
[1:05:02] his word we were there in him we were
[1:05:05] represented in that word its Christ God
[1:05:09] will have a fulfillment to that I want
[1:05:13] you to watch this here you know brother
[1:05:16] Branham talks about in this in the
[1:05:18] message of grace is that Abraham was
[1:05:21] supposed to stay in that land but he
[1:05:22] went down into the you know Philistines
[1:05:25] he went down there to sojourn to get out
[1:05:28] of the famine things was a little hard
[1:05:30] up in his country so he went down there
[1:05:33] to sojourn down there with him he done
[1:05:36] exactly what God told him not to do but
[1:05:40] yet the grace of God appeared to him and
[1:05:42] kept favor from taking but King from
[1:05:46] taking his wife he said Abraham said
[1:05:48] it's my sister he lied about it listen
[1:05:50] now but yet the grace of God held him
[1:05:53] because he repented he was willing to
[1:05:57] repent
[1:05:59] why was there mercy why was mercy kept
[1:06:03] why was mercy held he was willing to
[1:06:05] repent not because he was perfect but he
[1:06:13] was willing to repent and anybody that's
[1:06:17] willing to repent the grace of God still
[1:06:19] goes for you the grace of God is
[1:06:21] searching for you and that goes for
[1:06:23] year.the backsliders this morning the
[1:06:25] grace of God is still looking for you if
[1:06:27] you'll just repent God's grace is
[1:06:30] sufficient I want you to look at this in
[1:06:34] the scripture for a moment I don't read
[1:06:36] anywhere in this scripture nowhere do I
[1:06:40] read in here where we find Abraham as it
[1:06:44] were coming before God and saying Lord
[1:06:46] forgive me for telling that lie boy how
[1:06:52] do I got the sleepers awake now
[1:06:55] most of you don't find this you don't
[1:07:01] find it in the scripture as far as the
[1:07:04] words that said but you said by the same
[1:07:06] I believe he repented sure you do I do
[1:07:09] too
[1:07:10] but how do we know that he repented is
[1:07:13] repentance me just coming and say
[1:07:15] brother he not forgive me I'm wrong I'll
[1:07:17] forgive me brother
[1:07:18] Enoch and I continue to do the same
[1:07:20] thing that's not repentance you see I
[1:07:23] can have the right words and it looks
[1:07:25] like man this guy repented but if you if
[1:07:28] your actions don't change
[1:07:30] you ain't repented come on somebody this
[1:07:34] is here God is laying out the plan of
[1:07:37] his mercy you want mercy mercy is not
[1:07:39] lip service mercy is not I'm sorry
[1:07:42] because a lot of people are sorry but
[1:07:44] they're sorry for the way things turn
[1:07:45] out you understand that's called worldly
[1:07:48] sorrow I'm sorry that things are the way
[1:07:52] they are the way they are my life that's
[1:07:53] not repentance
[1:07:54] that's worldly sorrow but godly sorrow
[1:07:58] sorrow if unclear pendants are
[1:08:01] repentance that's not to be repented of
[1:08:05] glory be to God and it shows it shows
[1:08:09] itself in a life is that right Abraham
[1:08:13] notice in Genesis 13 here Abraham goes
[1:08:17] up in verse 1 out of the land of Egypt
[1:08:19] he takes his wife he takes all he had
[1:08:22] lot with him into the south and in verse
[1:08:24] 4 notice he in verse 3 sorry he went on
[1:08:28] his journeys from the south even to
[1:08:29] Bethel under the place where his tent
[1:08:31] had been at the beginning between Bethel
[1:08:33] and hey I under the place of the altar
[1:08:36] which he had made there at first and
[1:08:38] there Abram called on the name of the
[1:08:40] Lord what did he do he went back he
[1:08:44] repented he went back to where the
[1:08:47] reprove ER had reproved him and he went
[1:08:50] back to where he knew God spoke to him
[1:08:54] you see it ought to be something that
[1:08:57] was in a life if God's not speaking to
[1:08:59] you
[1:08:59] that ought to bother you
[1:09:01] if he don't bother you that God ain't
[1:09:03] talking to you there's something wrong
[1:09:06] if my wife wasn't talking to me man I
[1:09:09] tell you what I need me up I'm not
[1:09:13] talking about honey to-do list and
[1:09:14] everything else but those things come
[1:09:15] part of the love package too but you
[1:09:19] understand what I'm saying if she wants
[1:09:21] it if there's things that she wasn't
[1:09:22] expressing to me if there's things like
[1:09:24] the Prophet would tell us in Corinthians
[1:09:26] book of Corrections he said if my lives
[1:09:28] and my wife would not come and put her
[1:09:30] hand upon mine and express her love to
[1:09:32] me he said I would begin to question and
[1:09:35] say what's wrong now I know we look at
[1:09:37] it and say well brother sandal it ought
[1:09:38] to be that of the husband expressing to
[1:09:41] the wife that is true but the wife can
[1:09:43] only reciprocate the love that she is
[1:09:45] shown or expressed to how do we love the
[1:09:48] Lord we don't love him with our own love
[1:09:50] we love him with the love that he has
[1:09:52] expressed through us it is reflected
[1:09:54] back to him listen you mean I gotta put
[1:09:56] my hand on him and and tell me what a
[1:09:58] good provider he is and tell him about
[1:10:00] this and tell him about that I know that
[1:10:02] man is full of faults I know but so are
[1:10:04] you
[1:10:06] so am i come on now but yet remember the
[1:10:11] scripture says not you dwell in the
[1:10:13] praises but he dwelleth in the praises
[1:10:16] of his people how did the Prophet tell
[1:10:19] us to get his attention when we're
[1:10:21] praying when you're praying he says
[1:10:23] begin to just start with a little
[1:10:25] worship I love you
[1:10:29] appreciate you in or whoosh start
[1:10:32] solution you'd be surprised you might
[1:10:35] get biscuits instead they're burnt them
[1:10:37] things these good my gonna be in tight
[1:10:46] in here now then we do now to stop this
[1:10:48] gear right here but here God Abraham
[1:10:53] noticed God doesn't tell him where to go
[1:10:56] God didn't tell him where to go but yet
[1:10:58] Abraham knew this is where God spoke to
[1:11:01] him and he has not spoke to me in a long
[1:11:05] way you see God's desire is continued to
[1:11:10] have communion when our lives not just
[1:11:12] draw us to a church not
[1:11:14] bring us to a gathering his desire is to
[1:11:17] so employ our lives and to have Dallas
[1:11:19] ship with you and I and hear this
[1:11:21] expression is repentance is to turn from
[1:11:24] and turn unto and move to what God is
[1:11:28] calling us back to and yet you find that
[1:11:31] within this right here God himself he
[1:11:33] still doesn't speak to Abraham Abraham
[1:11:35] comes here in warships he comes right
[1:11:38] back to the place where he has left God
[1:11:40] and he begins to worship but yet God
[1:11:43] doesn't speak to him because there's
[1:11:47] still something that is there that God
[1:11:50] told him to get rid of before so once
[1:11:54] again the grace of God now watch mercy
[1:11:56] mercy is not going to come all the way
[1:11:58] over and say hey for him I love you so
[1:12:01] much oh my Abraham you're so precious oh
[1:12:03] my a more have your one of my sons
[1:12:05] Abraham I come my eyes covered I can't
[1:12:08] see nothing you're doing huh that's not
[1:12:10] mercy that's called disgrace but mercy
[1:12:14] is going to deal with this
[1:12:16] Mercy's going to deal with this problem
[1:12:19] so what mercy does mercy allows strife
[1:12:23] to enter into the camp
[1:12:26] whew strife between Kurtzman's why if
[1:12:31] there had not been that strife
[1:12:33] I wonder if the strife had not been
[1:12:35] there would Abraham have separated
[1:12:37] within that time but God had to allow a
[1:12:40] situation to arise that Abraham could
[1:12:42] say this ain't gonna work you choose
[1:12:45] where you want to go I'm going the
[1:12:47] opposite way what was Abraham doing he
[1:12:49] was reflecting what was written in him
[1:12:52] God had already spoken now he's dying to
[1:12:55] it he's done the grace of God appears
[1:13:01] and the strife itself is allowed to
[1:13:04] arise but notice how Abraham handles the
[1:13:06] strife Abraham didn't say you're a
[1:13:09] hitchhiker you ought to be happy I just
[1:13:13] brought you along no Abraham doesn't
[1:13:17] despise him but Abraham let's neighbor
[1:13:19] him recognizes that this cannot this
[1:13:22] type of a union cannot go on
[1:13:25] it's not moving in Abraham's life God
[1:13:28] can't tell he wants to do jobs already
[1:13:30] spoke in this water and now it's up to
[1:13:32] Abraham to act in faith in his word and
[1:13:35] even when God can look and say I see lot
[1:13:38] still with you but yet God Himself will
[1:13:40] not just come right down and make a
[1:13:42] visit and say hey lots still here
[1:13:45] your daddy's dead but lots still here
[1:13:47] God didn't come down that way but God
[1:13:49] allowed a situation to arise and Abraham
[1:13:53] discerned it this cannot go on
[1:13:58] what's happening here
[1:14:00] God's performing mercy Jamie Brown think
[1:14:06] of this the Prophet places it like this
[1:14:08] I don't know if I had this port up there
[1:14:10] not been out of Abraham's covenant
[1:14:11] confirmed in 1961 builder says God told
[1:14:15] him to separate himself away from his
[1:14:17] kindred away from his people but Abraham
[1:14:20] he said like an ordinary man God never
[1:14:23] run him out or back to his homeland for
[1:14:25] doing it but Abraham never did yet
[1:14:27] blessed of God until he separated
[1:14:30] himself from all his people he didn't
[1:14:36] get run out of the land what kept him
[1:14:38] from being run out of the land mercy you
[1:14:42] say well how could mercy it if this is
[1:14:44] what God is calling for because God is
[1:14:47] able to look down into the depths of
[1:14:50] Abraham's heart where you and I right
[1:14:52] now could have we were to look at it
[1:14:53] lord have mercy
[1:14:54] in legal astern Sweden wrote him off but
[1:14:58] Nehemiah said concerning that by
[1:15:00] inspiration in Nehemiah 9 that god
[1:15:03] looked down upon Abraham and found that
[1:15:05] he had a faithful heart it was not the
[1:15:09] mistakes that God was allowing to him
[1:15:11] God saw the faithfulness of his heart he
[1:15:16] not only believed but he also received
[1:15:19] divine assistance to be able to believe
[1:15:23] that's the same thing for you and I he
[1:15:27] never did get blessed of God until he
[1:15:30] separated himself from all his people
[1:15:32] God kept back the blessings came back to
[1:15:37] bless
[1:15:37] things until L Abraham would respond
[1:15:41] correctly to the Word of God oh my oh
[1:15:45] that's that my desire is the Lord I want
[1:15:48] to respond correctly I want to respond
[1:15:52] right this morning I want to respond if
[1:15:54] you tarry another day I want to respond
[1:15:56] right tomorrow I want to respond right
[1:15:58] why's that the blessings themselves will
[1:16:00] continue to flow in my life
[1:16:05] hola
[1:16:06] he took his father along you know
[1:16:08] friends as I said it does something if
[1:16:10] we don't if we're if I we're not living
[1:16:12] in that place to where our delight is in
[1:16:14] the Lord and we're looking for the Lord
[1:16:16] every day you know he didn't just come
[1:16:18] to church and look for God well I'm
[1:16:20] waiting for God to show up and he comes
[1:16:21] the church God wants more than that God
[1:16:23] wants to have a relationship with you he
[1:16:25] wants to show up and visit you not just
[1:16:28] during the daytime he'll visit you at
[1:16:30] the nighttime he'll visit you in the
[1:16:32] early morning God will visit you there
[1:16:34] in your house he'll visit you there on
[1:16:35] your job this God's desire is to have a
[1:16:38] relationship with you not a church life
[1:16:41] a church life you can turn on a church
[1:16:44] life you can turn off but that ain't
[1:16:47] what God came for this is not the mercy
[1:16:49] of God if that's all God wanted we
[1:16:52] wouldn't need mercy but we need mercy we
[1:16:56] need mercy what to lead us to that
[1:16:58] desire that God has oh my can we find
[1:17:04] after Abraham here he separates he
[1:17:09] separates from lot and after he
[1:17:12] separates the Lord said unto him after
[1:17:16] he was separated from lot lift up now
[1:17:19] thine eyes and look from the place where
[1:17:21] thou art northward southward eastward
[1:17:23] and westward for all the land which thou
[1:17:26] seest to thee will I give it into that
[1:17:29] seed forever and I will make thy seed as
[1:17:32] the dust of the earth so that if a man
[1:17:34] can number the dust of the earth then
[1:17:36] shall thy seed also be numbered arise
[1:17:38] walk through the land and the length of
[1:17:41] it in the breadth of it for I will give
[1:17:43] it unto thee last time Abraham had this
[1:17:46] right here it was down in the earth
[1:17:49] Caddy's when God spoke to him and that
[1:17:50] God
[1:17:51] God speaks to him when he comes into the
[1:17:53] land and God shows him the land this is
[1:17:56] the this is the next time that he has
[1:17:58] communication directly from God now he
[1:18:00] gets a sign from God as we said down
[1:18:02] there with a row where God's grace
[1:18:04] appears and does not allow Pharaoh to
[1:18:05] take Sarah his wife but yet right here
[1:18:08] God is letting it be known that now
[1:18:10] through this separation God's desire is
[1:18:13] for that separation and through that
[1:18:16] separation God Himself will make his
[1:18:19] word known further to Abraham not
[1:18:24] because he deserves it this is the glue
[1:18:28] of the Covenant sticking right here I
[1:18:32] wonder what if God did the way you and I
[1:18:34] did you've held out from Genesis 12 4 or
[1:18:44] 5 and you've been okay you went down
[1:18:48] into Egypt look at you and you kept
[1:18:51] locked expect me to talk to you now what
[1:18:56] have you done that's worthy of it this
[1:19:00] is where mercies need it not on our
[1:19:04] works not on our works if it was by our
[1:19:08] works listen friends we wouldn't have
[1:19:10] nothing to do even with one another
[1:19:14] that's the truth because we disappoint
[1:19:17] one another you would say a man I'll say
[1:19:20] a man for you we disappoint one another
[1:19:24] but yet here is the love of God His
[1:19:27] mercy moving down his mercy it's not
[1:19:30] saying I'm gonna tolerate this Abraham
[1:19:31] I'm just going to go along with it huh
[1:19:33] you're not pretend to didn't even happen
[1:19:34] no God is dealing with him he's bringing
[1:19:37] him along notice how faith itself you
[1:19:40] know faith has a way of displaying
[1:19:41] itself it displays itself it shows
[1:19:46] itself in works works according not
[1:19:50] according to the works of man but it is
[1:19:52] the works according to the divine
[1:19:54] promise abraham listen to me now abraham
[1:19:58] could have done a lot of good things
[1:19:59] here in genesis 13 he could have given
[1:20:02] lot the most joy
[1:20:04] slang lot you can have this plot you can
[1:20:06] have that man the moisture slain you'd
[1:20:08] say mine what a good guy but there had
[1:20:10] to be coupled with that separation
[1:20:13] because that was a work required by the
[1:20:16] word but in order for that work to be
[1:20:19] done see Abraham could have just done it
[1:20:21] but yet it had to be something to wear
[1:20:22] abraham was united with the promise of
[1:20:26] god and it was not something out of just
[1:20:28] i have to do it but it was out of love
[1:20:30] love out of what love to who love to the
[1:20:33] one who called him faith will display
[1:20:38] itself in works notice how that god when
[1:20:44] he he speaks here you find you find such
[1:20:47] a beautiful reality within Genesis 14
[1:20:50] where Abraham himself here is he he goes
[1:20:55] after you know these kings five kings
[1:20:58] and and you know are these four kings
[1:21:00] they've overthrown the five and here
[1:21:02] Abraham arms his servants and he goes
[1:21:04] after them he doesn't even hesitate he
[1:21:08] doesn't think he doesn't stop and have
[1:21:10] prayer and fast about it but he goes
[1:21:12] right after it and it shows what
[1:21:15] authority that a man has when he's
[1:21:17] separated unto the gun to God when a man
[1:21:20] is separated various authority from God
[1:21:23] to act upon that word he didn't have to
[1:21:26] pray about it Abraham looked at it this
[1:21:28] is the land that God had given me by
[1:21:30] promise Lots part of that land I'm going
[1:21:32] out after him look at this his trained
[1:21:38] servants born in his house he armed him
[1:21:42] these servants go out they're born in
[1:21:45] his house they're armed with the whole
[1:21:46] armor of God they're going out into this
[1:21:48] battle as far as those kings in those
[1:21:51] armies they may more that mask
[1:21:54] Abraham but it's not about in number
[1:21:57] Abraham did not consider the number
[1:22:00] Abraham did not even consider what he
[1:22:02] was
[1:22:03] up against what was Abraham looking at
[1:22:05] this is God's Word what's happening
[1:22:09] mercy mercy in the Covenant has brought
[1:22:13] forth this part in Abraham's life that
[1:22:16] God knew was there the whole time and
[1:22:17] Abraham now is looking at a situation
[1:22:20] and instead of becoming so encompassed
[1:22:25] by what he sees he looks at what the
[1:22:27] promise that was made and he acts upon
[1:22:29] that promise my look at this the great
[1:22:37] campaign when he returns and how that
[1:22:39] God moves there and and visit and God
[1:22:43] visits him there you know here making
[1:22:45] himself known Melchizedek the priest and
[1:22:49] king of the Most High Most High God and
[1:22:52] he visits Abraham and and he blesses
[1:22:55] Abraham he who had the promises he
[1:22:57] blesses him and and notice Abraham even
[1:23:00] in the midst of this time Abraham is
[1:23:02] tempted he's tempted he's tempted to
[1:23:06] take riches of this world he's tempted
[1:23:09] to take riches for his service he's
[1:23:12] tempted to take earthly things but
[1:23:14] Abraham says I will not even take so
[1:23:17] much as a shoe lasted let's now have
[1:23:19] said thou has made Abraham rich he's
[1:23:23] been tested he's being tempted there's
[1:23:26] things that's alluring him and you know
[1:23:28] we can look at it Genesis that very part
[1:23:30] in Genesis 14 it brings it right down
[1:23:33] into our life can we be content with
[1:23:36] what God has given to us hey man can we
[1:23:40] be content I'll say there null in the
[1:23:43] natural I say it in the spiritual we
[1:23:46] don't you don't have to add anything to
[1:23:47] this message you do you hybridize it you
[1:23:51] don't have to add anything to it to make
[1:23:53] it glamorous or glorious God himself has
[1:23:56] vindicated it
[1:23:58] we don't have to bring back Nilson add
[1:24:01] this and add that God Himself gave a
[1:24:03] clear direction and a vindication
[1:24:06] he has included and given to us all that
[1:24:09] is necessary that's why the Prophet
[1:24:13] would ask the question are we
[1:24:14] sufficiently impressed with the word in
[1:24:17] our midst
[1:24:21] gonna need this
[1:24:23] God I need this I just say God perform
[1:24:25] your word because he performs his word
[1:24:29] than everything that he is everything
[1:24:32] that he has given and in accordance with
[1:24:34] his word he's there and he's there to
[1:24:36] use at his at his Liberty to minister to
[1:24:40] our lives
[1:24:41] everything is there healing deliverance
[1:24:42] all the gifts everything is better
[1:24:44] within him in the word my water what a
[1:24:52] reward you know God couldn't tell
[1:24:53] Abraham Abraham don't take that don't
[1:24:56] take that Abraham don't take that good
[1:24:59] god oh god was silence he allowed him to
[1:25:04] be tested what's gonna happen but
[1:25:11] Abraham by the grace of God remember how
[1:25:15] was he able to turn that down he
[1:25:17] realized the principle that he was
[1:25:20] living his life life was a principle
[1:25:22] that was not for self hello he did not
[1:25:27] think himself when he went after a lot
[1:25:30] he was not living for himself but how
[1:25:33] God comes on the scene in Genesis 15 1
[1:25:36] and God rewards God rewards him the
[1:25:41] Bible says after these things the word
[1:25:43] of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision
[1:25:44] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[1:25:47] and by exceeding great reward let me
[1:25:52] tell you
[1:25:53] Abraham anointed were the promise of God
[1:25:57] going down there under that word there
[1:26:00] wasn't a king to Kentucky
[1:26:04] that wasn't a sword there wasn't a spear
[1:26:06] there wasn't an armed man that could
[1:26:08] have touched him you know they're after
[1:26:10] the commanding generals they're after
[1:26:12] the leaders are after those things after
[1:26:14] there wasn't one contention it wasn't
[1:26:17] that he was just walking along and
[1:26:18] saying my name is Abraham and my or
[1:26:20] Bruce and I know that but I'm trying to
[1:26:22] get a point across Abraham himself went
[1:26:24] down there by way of the word but it was
[1:26:27] not an act it was in faith to the word
[1:26:31] and faith demonstrated itself in the
[1:26:34] works that were shown there and Abraham
[1:26:36] as did the rest of his trained
[1:26:39] servants they fought in that's the same
[1:26:41] way when the Lord Jesus Christ Himself
[1:26:43] came to this earth a man he pursued the
[1:26:48] enemies even unto death and the Prophet
[1:26:51] said even unto Dan is the lowest parts
[1:26:54] of Hill he went to the lowest parts of
[1:26:56] Hill he paid the sin debt for you and I
[1:26:59] he was tempted he was tested in all
[1:27:02] points such as we have it wasn't an act
[1:27:04] when he had to turn his head it wasn't
[1:27:06] an act when he was tested it was a
[1:27:09] reality but it all overcame he overcame
[1:27:14] I am thy shield han - you know I'm your
[1:27:25] protection
[1:27:26] I am your buckler I am your strength and
[1:27:29] I am your reward not what the kings of
[1:27:32] this earth can give you
[1:27:34] I'm your reward I'm your reward a reward
[1:27:42] is that which is given for one who is
[1:27:45] faithful
[1:27:46] so God Himself by His mercy has to have
[1:27:50] been able to forget forgive all those
[1:27:54] things that Abraham has done and move on
[1:27:57] those remember he just can't come and do
[1:28:00] his word by duty it must be from his
[1:28:07] heart you said well the how in the world
[1:28:11] could Abraham's for his faults his
[1:28:14] failures and mistakes because when that
[1:28:16] word itself is made
[1:28:18] known that word coming to past is Christ
[1:28:20] its Christ that a standing Miriam that
[1:28:23] were for that word to be able to call
[1:28:25] out of Abraham's life to atone for his
[1:28:27] sins
[1:28:28] it was able to stand there and convict
[1:28:30] him and Abraham could repent let me tell
[1:28:32] you it does no good to bring conviction
[1:28:34] and reproof if there ain't no repentance
[1:28:38] there right but conviction and reprove
[1:28:41] it ought to lead to repentance because
[1:28:43] the goodness of God leadeth to
[1:28:45] repentance if Abraham would have walked
[1:28:51] around like many folks do without any
[1:28:53] conviction we wouldn't be reading about
[1:28:54] him today this one because of his flesh
[1:29:01] but it was God's faithfulness but there
[1:29:04] was a part within Abraham that could
[1:29:05] respond and be convicted
[1:29:07] oh brother Samuel ha was convicted long
[1:29:12] ago you need to be walking conviction
[1:29:13] every day of your life I'm not saying
[1:29:16] condemnation
[1:29:17] I said conviction when you walk in real
[1:29:19] godly conviction you watch the things
[1:29:22] you do you watch the things you say you
[1:29:24] watch the life that you live that's real
[1:29:27] godly conviction conviction is not just
[1:29:30] something under sanctification or under
[1:29:32] justification conviction is a part of
[1:29:35] our life all the way he believed God
[1:29:41] here God lets him know of what is to
[1:29:44] take place the word of the Lord came to
[1:29:46] Vinh verse 4 this shall not be thine
[1:29:48] heir but he that shall come forth not
[1:29:50] out of thine own bow that err and he
[1:29:53] brought him forth abroad and he looked
[1:29:55] now toward heaven told him to look
[1:29:57] toward heaven tell the Stars if thou be
[1:29:59] able to number them and he said so shall
[1:30:01] thy seed be and he believed in the Lord
[1:30:03] and he powdered it to him for
[1:30:05] righteousness
[1:30:07] watch this he believes what God has said
[1:30:11] and it's counted to him for
[1:30:13] righteousness
[1:30:15] if we could just pause for a moment we
[1:30:18] could ask the Lord Lord is Abraham fully
[1:30:22] where you want him to be no but yes he
[1:30:26] is no yes he is as far as in your
[1:30:29] eyesight no but in my eyesight
[1:30:32] a finished product I am bringing him to
[1:30:37] the image that I've known of him all
[1:30:40] along but Lord what about this and what
[1:30:43] about this what about that I know that
[1:30:45] but all that right there I'm chiseling
[1:30:46] away he makes us known to Abraham now
[1:30:54] watch what Abraham does Abraham so in
[1:30:57] tune with God here he he asks God what
[1:31:00] God desires to make known to him Oh in
[1:31:05] verse seven he said unto him I am the
[1:31:08] Lord that brought thee out of ur of
[1:31:10] Chaldees to give me this land to inherit
[1:31:12] it and he said Lord God whereby shall I
[1:31:14] know that I shall inherit it he's not
[1:31:18] doubting he believed God so in believing
[1:31:22] God he knows there's a fulfillment of
[1:31:24] that promise he knows that when God
[1:31:27] makes a word of promise God comes to
[1:31:29] confirm it God confirms his wireless
[1:31:32] signs and wonders following so he's
[1:31:34] asking for God to come and confirm that
[1:31:36] word that's just what God wanted him to
[1:31:38] do and here look at this how that
[1:31:44] Abraham i watch so what's how this is
[1:31:46] going on the mercy of God Abraham notice
[1:31:50] what's happening in this covenant
[1:31:51] Abraham is the mind of Christ though not
[1:31:55] fully dwelling in him yet but yet he's
[1:31:58] being drawn and you find him operating
[1:32:01] under the mind of Christ God tells him
[1:32:06] to lay out all of these sacrifices cut
[1:32:09] lay the sacrifices out and he opens them
[1:32:11] up the birds they were not to be divided
[1:32:13] but then all of a sudden here in verse
[1:32:16] 11 the Bible says fowls came down upon
[1:32:20] the carcasses and Abram drove them all
[1:32:22] he here is Abraham operating in tune
[1:32:26] with the mind of Almighty God what is
[1:32:28] this this is mercy Abraham recognizes if
[1:32:32] this right here that God is laying down
[1:32:35] to confirm the covenant there can't be
[1:32:37] one part missing it can't even be a peck
[1:32:42] see everything has got to be hearing
[1:32:45] must be the fullness in order to God to
[1:32:48] come and confirm it so Abraham God
[1:32:52] didn't telling me Abraham did something
[1:32:54] and surely the vultures
[1:32:55] but Abraham knew this right here God had
[1:32:58] told me to laid this out and the
[1:33:00] vultures were coming and he knew they
[1:33:02] would pick those things away but Abraham
[1:33:04] stood there and he shooed the vultures
[1:33:06] away
[1:33:07] what if he hadn't shooed the vultures
[1:33:09] away there would have been no confirming
[1:33:13] let me tell you something friends
[1:33:15] shooing the vultures away is not just
[1:33:18] for the stage of sanctification we can
[1:33:20] apply it very very very deeply and very
[1:33:22] clearly there but in each and every part
[1:33:25] of our life it's Satan that would like
[1:33:27] to take word away from us promises away
[1:33:30] from us but as the seed of Abraham we
[1:33:33] must stand there upon that word
[1:33:34] we're always standing on God's Word when
[1:33:37] there's something that tries to take
[1:33:38] away something that is our god-given
[1:33:41] right we have an authority surely the
[1:33:43] fowls I don't care who it is we have an
[1:33:46] authority you understand we're dealing
[1:33:50] with spirits these are the fowls of the
[1:33:52] air it was spirits shooing them away you
[1:33:57] realize if that had not been shoot away
[1:33:59] here in this hour there would not have
[1:34:01] been a token that would been a deliverer
[1:34:03] to you and I the token would not be
[1:34:05] delivered over a carcass that was worm
[1:34:07] hole eaten and looked like Swiss cheese
[1:34:09] but the only way is that that living
[1:34:12] Lord Jesus Christ the very fullness of
[1:34:14] himself it had to be him there had to be
[1:34:17] a call for the fullness and to believe
[1:34:19] that God is the same in every aspect in
[1:34:22] every part of his word his spinder on
[1:34:26] that where will is he doing driving away
[1:34:27] them fowls that spirits that were coming
[1:34:31] in religious spirits but he stood there
[1:34:33] to drive them away but you and I might
[1:34:36] enjoy the blessing and the promise that
[1:34:38] we have in Christ right now
[1:34:41] that was promised us but this was
[1:34:44] necessary he kept the fraud vultures
[1:34:50] away that's our God and trust us to keep
[1:34:55] the vultures away notice how that God
[1:35:01] comes along it makes the promise with
[1:35:04] him there in Genesis 15 lets him know
[1:35:07] that it's going to be an error out of
[1:35:09] your own bowels which we read but then
[1:35:11] here you come into the chapter of the
[1:35:14] women the chapter of sorry I and Hagar
[1:35:19] you come into a chapter here to where
[1:35:22] there's misunderstandings you come into
[1:35:26] a chapter here where self-will asserts
[1:35:29] itself you come into a place to where
[1:35:32] the Prophet would call it the great
[1:35:34] trial to where that Sarah herself would
[1:35:38] suggest to Abraham because in looking at
[1:35:41] her condition there's no way that III
[1:35:43] perhaps what God will do it might be
[1:35:46] that he'll give a seed through that of
[1:35:47] my handmaid she had no word to stand on
[1:35:53] but what's this this even shows look at
[1:35:55] the weakness that's here and here in the
[1:35:58] midst of this misunderstanding you
[1:36:00] realize that Ishmael himself was a
[1:36:02] misunderstanding that's why the Prophet
[1:36:07] could take us in 1964 look elated Jesus
[1:36:10] he said Abraham did not even look to the
[1:36:12] misunderstandings of the promise come on
[1:36:17] somebody there's a lot of things you can
[1:36:19] look at our misunderstandings of the
[1:36:21] promise but God is still God
[1:36:24] and the profit Center like this Abraham
[1:36:27] did not become focused on the
[1:36:29] misunderstandings Ishmael was a
[1:36:32] misunderstanding right but notice the
[1:36:37] mercy of God the mercy of God didn't
[1:36:38] take your smell say okay look you know
[1:36:40] Abraham because you all you know
[1:36:42] repented of it we'll just forget about
[1:36:43] it no Ishmael still afflicting to this
[1:36:46] day there's certain things that you
[1:36:49] could wish and say my wish I'd have
[1:36:51] never done that in my younger days
[1:36:53] there's certain things you would have
[1:36:55] never saw certain things you never
[1:36:57] partake off certain things you wish you
[1:36:59] never been around or this would happen
[1:37:01] or that would have happened why it still
[1:37:03] haunts and you look at it look at it
[1:37:10] even when God gets a hold of a life you
[1:37:12] take a lot than maybe it's been so lived
[1:37:14] within the world it's so hard and you
[1:37:16] can see the hardness upon a person's
[1:37:18] life from where they lived in the world
[1:37:20] one day when God gets ahold of their
[1:37:22] life you know all of a sudden change
[1:37:23] their skin and give them nice baby skin
[1:37:25] and take away all the hardness Scott
[1:37:27] doesn't do that but those things are
[1:37:29] reminders that grace has found you
[1:37:33] amen sometimes you look at situations in
[1:37:36] your life you look at failures you look
[1:37:38] at you look at scars but remember what
[1:37:41] scars are scars are not open wounds but
[1:37:44] scars are evidence that healing has come
[1:37:48] when I was wounded but now I am healed
[1:37:51] [Applause]
[1:37:55] every one of us in here there's things
[1:37:57] scars we wish we didn't have scars can
[1:38:00] sometimes be words that's been said he
[1:38:04] Vince that's happened you don't feel
[1:38:05] like you can even get beyond but I'll
[1:38:07] tell you there's a greater one there's a
[1:38:10] greater one than your memory and your
[1:38:11] ability here this morning there's one
[1:38:13] that not only forgives and forgets but
[1:38:16] there's one who can take the very steam
[1:38:18] of those words that were spoken you see
[1:38:25] friends sometimes these things when you
[1:38:27] look think about brother Brad talked
[1:38:28] about even sister Rosella
[1:38:31] you never said here sister Rosella
[1:38:33] beautiful complexion and beautiful skin
[1:38:35] Oh What did he say
[1:38:36] she looked at him and said I wish I
[1:38:37] looked like medium the hardness of her
[1:38:42] life that she had lived God didn't take
[1:38:46] that away sometimes seeds that are sown
[1:38:48] God don't take those seeds away mercy
[1:38:51] don't always take things away but
[1:38:53] sometimes there's things that remain
[1:38:55] that God can remind you if it wasn't for
[1:38:57] me you see he takes it to such a place
[1:39:01] for you and I can see there is no way
[1:39:04] but him it's not fathomable here not
[1:39:09] here but it's believable here but look
[1:39:15] how Sarah look what Sarah said in in in
[1:39:18] genesis 16:5 my lord Sarah in noticing
[1:39:22] what has taken place
[1:39:23] Sarah I said unto Abraham my wrong be
[1:39:27] upon thee not me thee my wrong
[1:39:37] it's her wrong but her own would be upon
[1:39:41] Abraham how can
[1:39:43] be mercy she's married God is looking at
[1:39:51] him and holding him responsible Sara
[1:39:57] notice how Sara opted God would have
[1:40:00] wiped her right out but it was her
[1:40:04] marriage her Union to Abraham and
[1:40:07] Abraham bore this sin if it would have
[1:40:13] been on her God would have removed her
[1:40:15] but that's the same way it is with you
[1:40:17] and I if it was not for our union with
[1:40:19] Jesus Christ our mistakes would put us
[1:40:22] right out but I'm not talking about
[1:40:25] living a defeated life I'm talking about
[1:40:27] when we're walking within this word but
[1:40:30] you and I are subject to mistakes but
[1:40:32] God's grace remains sufficient that
[1:40:38] ought to make you live more convicted
[1:40:40] that ought to make you live more
[1:40:42] thankful when you get that understanding
[1:40:45] it causes you to live with greater
[1:40:47] conviction and it's not about can't do
[1:40:49] this can't do that it's I love him more
[1:40:52] that's the kind of conviction I don't
[1:40:55] want to do anything that would displease
[1:40:56] him oh ma notice the Prophet says it
[1:41:03] like this I gotta read this pyrius in
[1:41:06] prayer in 1964 he said Lord forgiving
[1:41:08] our sins we pray that you'll not look at
[1:41:11] our misunderstandings our ignorance
[1:41:13] concerning the things that we should
[1:41:15] know that you'll forgive us for that and
[1:41:17] remember us just human beings father
[1:41:20] were subject to all kinds of mistakes
[1:41:23] and troubles
[1:41:24] thou art the infinite infallible
[1:41:26] everlasting God we pray that you'll be
[1:41:28] merciful to us and granted to us the
[1:41:30] blessings that we asked for for we ask
[1:41:33] it in Jesus name Amen
[1:41:38] your God makes known let me just just
[1:41:41] for time let me just move Genesis 17
[1:41:44] here the mercy of God's moving how that
[1:41:48] God lets him know the Covenant that I'll
[1:41:51] make between you and me he lets it be
[1:41:54] known that in verse 17
[1:41:57] verse 7 to 17 he said I'll establish my
[1:41:59] covenant between thee and thy seed after
[1:42:01] thee in the generations for an
[1:42:03] everlasting covenant to be a God unto
[1:42:05] the into thy seed after thee promises
[1:42:08] and there the the land were in your
[1:42:10] stranger verse 19 here God notice how
[1:42:12] God honing this in he's not deviating
[1:42:16] from the original revelation he's honing
[1:42:19] it in
[1:42:20] and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear
[1:42:23] thee a son indeed and thou shalt call
[1:42:26] his name Isaac and I will establish my
[1:42:29] covenant with him for an everlasting
[1:42:31] covenant and with his seed after him and
[1:42:37] here think and look at the mercy of God
[1:42:40] after this is spoken
[1:42:43] Abraham laughs so she is of old age and
[1:42:50] me bear a son he laughs what held in
[1:42:57] that time he's not laughing at God but
[1:43:00] he's looking at his own his own self
[1:43:03] oh my can't be refined to other places
[1:43:07] look at this other places before we've
[1:43:09] already shown where Abraham's looking at
[1:43:10] the word he goes after a lot he takes a
[1:43:13] promise but see this is requiring a
[1:43:15] greater faith this isn't just believed
[1:43:18] God sent a prophet
[1:43:21] this is requiring a greater faith this
[1:43:24] is not just faith of well I'll be
[1:43:26] repenting my sins and be baptized in the
[1:43:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:43:29] requiring a greater faith a greater
[1:43:33] faith is required so God how do we know
[1:43:39] we understand all moves upon the scene
[1:43:41] and he brings that that dissolving that
[1:43:44] leading to Abraham now notice here he
[1:43:47] comes and begins to talk to Abraham
[1:43:49] Sarah's in the tent you're familiar with
[1:43:52] this and how that that angel makes makes
[1:43:56] that declaration the angel the Lord
[1:43:58] standing there is God standing right
[1:44:01] there and making a declaration that at
[1:44:04] this time at the point of time in this
[1:44:07] year in the year Sarah
[1:44:10] I shall have a son what he spoke back
[1:44:13] there he's here to fulfill it it was a
[1:44:16] word there but notice how quick it came
[1:44:18] right quickly to the fulfillment and
[1:44:21] confirmation of that word
[1:44:22] he wasn't just gonna stay around as a
[1:44:25] word I hope you're hearing me now it
[1:44:28] wasn't just gonna stay around as a word
[1:44:29] and just rejoicing around the word but
[1:44:31] that word was spoken to become flesh
[1:44:34] thank God for the word but of all we're
[1:44:37] doing his washer been around a word and
[1:44:39] whoops have been around the ladder
[1:44:41] I'm telling you friend there won't be
[1:44:42] much there but it's worshiping around
[1:44:45] the living Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[1:44:47] word himself he points us to a living
[1:44:50] reality of confirmation of himself in
[1:44:54] his church to overbeat a car hallelujah
[1:45:00] oh no he didn't stop there when the
[1:45:05] seventh angel went off the scene he
[1:45:07] didn't stop that's the beginning I said
[1:45:11] that's the beginning there is not
[1:45:13] there's not gonna be another message
[1:45:15] coming now it's time for that message
[1:45:17] and that message is writing itself out
[1:45:19] in the hearts of the people the same
[1:45:22] Spirit of God the same angel the Lord
[1:45:24] that brought the word and delivered the
[1:45:26] word is the same age of the Lord leading
[1:45:29] the Church of the Living God
[1:45:32] what a comfort that is you didn't get in
[1:45:37] that you see you can worship around the
[1:45:39] word that's been given and miss what
[1:45:41] it's all about
[1:45:43] they were down there worshiping around
[1:45:45] the word that had been given and Paul
[1:45:47] found them and said have y'all heard had
[1:45:49] you heard that they're been here have
[1:45:50] you heard received the Holy Ghost
[1:45:51] I believe Dobson the prophet I said have
[1:45:54] you received the Holy Ghost I didn't ask
[1:45:56] if you could read I didn't ask if you
[1:45:58] could put it together I didn't ask if
[1:46:00] you can make sense I'm asking you has
[1:46:02] there been a change in your life
[1:46:05] have you been with entire or is it just
[1:46:10] acknowledgement of facts doctrines
[1:46:16] fountain look John's disciples John had
[1:46:19] disciples is that right they were
[1:46:21] gathered around that word John was
[1:46:23] trying to tell him
[1:46:24] you boys are missing it there's the Lamb
[1:46:26] of God is that right
[1:46:29] her brother Samuel they were walking
[1:46:31] right was the Lord not they they were
[1:46:33] not if they stayed with John to stay
[1:46:36] with John is to walk on with the word
[1:46:37] that came from John John the physical
[1:46:40] man would have been by the wayside but
[1:46:42] that word went on and that where had
[1:46:44] become flesh right there in the water it
[1:46:47] changed from the Prophet to his prophecy
[1:46:50] lorry be to God he meant Christ residing
[1:46:55] within the hearts of his people here's
[1:46:59] Sarah isn't she laughs how can this be
[1:47:06] she sees her condition how is this going
[1:47:09] to be look at me I'm old he's old both
[1:47:15] of us these things have ceased to be
[1:47:16] between us how is this going to be not
[1:47:20] by might nor by power but by my spirit
[1:47:24] saith the Lord
[1:47:25] how's this gonna happen he said I will
[1:47:31] Sarah laughs and God called her out on
[1:47:35] it oh my it seems to be the betting
[1:47:40] ground of the promise but you see the
[1:47:42] mercy of God held right there the mercy
[1:47:45] of God did not just say okay Sarah your
[1:47:47] unbelief will just bring it forward
[1:47:49] no he deals with it the mercy of God is
[1:47:54] there the word that has been given
[1:47:56] between Genesis 18 and when Isaac
[1:48:00] himself comes along there in Genesis 21
[1:48:03] there has been a dissolving of all doubt
[1:48:09] then have to send another message the
[1:48:12] message that God came and vindicated
[1:48:14] himself the promise that
[1:48:16] was given God vindicated it and
[1:48:18] shearling under that vindication
[1:48:20] dissolved her doubt mercy I know this is
[1:48:26] simple oh it's so simple this morning
[1:48:28] but the reality of it is friends if it's
[1:48:31] not for the mercy of God the glue of the
[1:48:34] Covenant you and I would not make it our
[1:48:39] mistakes and everything as good as a
[1:48:42] good week as you can try to have yet
[1:48:44] it's all filthy rags in his sight
[1:48:47] because when you go to start trying to
[1:48:49] stack your goodness up before God as
[1:48:51] though that Lord I've done something
[1:48:53] good dad does not appease God whatsoever
[1:48:56] he looks for one thing and that's the
[1:48:58] blood tag do you have the life that
[1:49:01] token on this play because the token on
[1:49:05] display brings the desire in your life
[1:49:08] to the forefront and that faith declares
[1:49:12] itself in the works this is why God
[1:49:16] could have smote her here but she is
[1:49:19] identified in Abraham a brother brand
[1:49:24] could say like this he says when
[1:49:26] backsliding he said I wish somebody
[1:49:27] would have asked me a question on
[1:49:28] backsliding today he said there's no no
[1:49:31] way at all for you to keep out of it I
[1:49:32] know people can make these things and
[1:49:34] they give license you know I've had
[1:49:36] people stand and quote to me and said
[1:49:37] you know brother Samuel I can't help you
[1:49:39] no I drink you know everybody makes
[1:49:41] mistakes and I stand straight up and
[1:49:43] said that's a lie you can't help it if
[1:49:46] you got the Holy Ghost he is an
[1:49:49] overcomer you can't make excuses on the
[1:49:55] word and sometimes that don't make it
[1:49:57] you have friends or calls people to get
[1:49:58] mad at you but the thing about it is I'd
[1:50:00] rather you be mad at me now let me tell
[1:50:02] you the truth then standing there at the
[1:50:03] day of judgment and want to point a
[1:50:05] finger in my face I want to be honest
[1:50:07] with you because that's a real joy the
[1:50:14] real joy is the Holy Ghost that's the
[1:50:16] life of God but you backslide and he
[1:50:22] said you backslide to the people in the
[1:50:24] church but not before God you backslide
[1:50:26] on Christ but you don't
[1:50:28] because when you sin you're gone but
[1:50:31] you're constantly falling Paul had to
[1:50:33] die every day over the same I don't send
[1:50:36] your friends listen you realize this
[1:50:38] goes even to your attitude entertaining
[1:50:41] thoughts against people come on now
[1:50:45] let's dig a deep now but not when I'm
[1:50:47] not guilty dips and I'm not guilty this
[1:50:49] and I'm not guilty of this sounds like
[1:50:51] that woman brother ran was reaching on
[1:50:53] you know he's reaching out said you've
[1:50:55] reached a lot unbelief she's afraid God
[1:50:58] she's their brother an amen brother
[1:51:01] answer Wow
[1:51:02] you know I didn't even touch her they
[1:51:04] said her she the biggest gossip in the
[1:51:07] city and I'll mind you when the Prophet
[1:51:13] stood there in Toledo fruit buns
[1:51:16] cafeteria and here he was looking at
[1:51:19] this woman here she was in the condition
[1:51:22] he was in he was a recipient of mercy
[1:51:24] but he was not willing to extend it at
[1:51:26] that time so God had to have a
[1:51:29] conference with this prophet cuz his
[1:51:30] prophet will always recognize his word
[1:51:33] and that the prophet of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:36] is in you and you're born you'll
[1:51:38] recognize his word - he pulled him to
[1:51:41] the side and he began to show him the
[1:51:43] earth how it's covered with blood and
[1:51:45] every time of where he would send there
[1:51:47] was a bumper of blood brother rather
[1:51:52] quickly he repented of what his thoughts
[1:51:55] because he said right there I was
[1:51:57] criticizing her he said any of the eyes
[1:52:00] of God this is where it really gets down
[1:52:02] in the eyes of God I was just as bad as
[1:52:07] she was whoo
[1:52:09] you made a critical spirit as the same
[1:52:11] thing as a striptease same thing Oh
[1:52:15] glory
[1:52:16] no you can't classify sin sin is sin
[1:52:20] it's unbelief but that's why we need the
[1:52:24] mercy of God to wear when God would
[1:52:27] speak to our hearts and deal with arts
[1:52:29] quickly turn from that thing
[1:52:31] so God forgive me that is not becoming
[1:52:34] to me as a temple of the Holy Ghost for
[1:52:36] that to be there girl to be to God and
[1:52:42] God visited here
[1:52:44] look how God takes Abraham I'm closing
[1:52:47] here Genesis 22 yeah the climax of it
[1:52:52] God Abraham here think of what Abraham
[1:52:55] all did these chapters of where
[1:52:57] Abraham's been through Abraham has
[1:52:59] personally here he has been walking he's
[1:53:02] standing on the Word of God to bring him
[1:53:04] to where he's at in Genesis 22
[1:53:07] what grace it's taken what mercy if not
[1:53:11] for mercy he would have been rode off
[1:53:13] way back there in Genesis 12 as a matter
[1:53:15] of fact it would have been before
[1:53:17] Genesis 12 he would have been rode off
[1:53:19] in Genesis 11 Genesis 11 yes because
[1:53:24] Genesis 12 once said the Lord had said
[1:53:27] the Lord had said God had spoke to him
[1:53:31] down there but he only made one little
[1:53:33] move to her own but the grace of God
[1:53:37] held mercy covenant mercy he sells him
[1:53:45] take that only son Isaac the one whom
[1:53:48] thou lovest get up into the land of
[1:53:51] Moriah and offer him there for a burnt
[1:53:53] offering upon one of the mountains which
[1:53:55] I will tell thee Abraham we know as he
[1:53:58] comes on in verse in verse 5 Abraham
[1:54:02] said unto his young men as they drew
[1:54:03] near he he saw the place and he tells
[1:54:06] the young men abide here with the ass
[1:54:07] and I am the lad will go yonder and
[1:54:09] worship and come again oh my Abraham
[1:54:13] what's Abraham standing on he's standing
[1:54:16] on God's Word it's not just where God
[1:54:19] has said take an offer up thy son but
[1:54:22] he's going here with faith in the word
[1:54:25] God made a promise that this son that I
[1:54:29] will give thee through Sarah will be
[1:54:32] your heir and I will establish my
[1:54:34] covenant with him and he had their seed
[1:54:36] throughout each generation he's standing
[1:54:40] upon that word
[1:54:41] here's this word Abraham acting in faith
[1:54:45] on that word
[1:54:46] he takes Isaac up there to the mountain
[1:54:48] he doesn't know he doesn't know that
[1:54:52] there's gonna be Iran there he doesn't
[1:54:55] know that he doesn't know how this
[1:54:58] change is gonna come about but he knows
[1:55:01] that God has told him where to go to so
[1:55:05] he's walking up there by faith Abraham
[1:55:07] had to have seen this by vision it had
[1:55:10] to be something that Abraham because the
[1:55:12] Bible said he seemed the place afar off
[1:55:14] it was a place that God had made known
[1:55:17] to him he reckoned this was the place
[1:55:20] God's talking about right here he's
[1:55:22] walking up there taking his only Son the
[1:55:25] love of his life the strength of his
[1:55:28] life his heir the one in whom the
[1:55:34] promise that God has made here's the one
[1:55:38] Abraham is being brought into such a
[1:55:42] declaration of complete obedience will
[1:55:47] it be everything will it be everything
[1:55:53] what was he showing that's exactly what
[1:55:57] the bridegroom would be oh the word
[1:56:01] walking in all the obedience to the word
[1:56:04] and all that the bridegroom is this
[1:56:08] bride is to walk in full obedience to
[1:56:12] the word not a part of the word but a
[1:56:15] full obedience Calvary listen Calvary
[1:56:18] was not just so that we could come and
[1:56:20] live you know good lives and have peace
[1:56:22] all for is listen those things are all
[1:56:24] wonderful but it's for redemption and
[1:56:26] not just redemption of the soul but
[1:56:28] redemption of the body it leads to a
[1:56:31] full reconciling all the way back home
[1:56:37] and here God uh ters out after Abraham
[1:56:41] he says God will provide for himself a
[1:56:45] lamb look is so in tune with God he'll
[1:56:49] provide for himself a lamb for a burnt
[1:56:51] offering
[1:56:52] so they went both together
[1:56:55] we see how that god of the angel of the
[1:56:58] Lord it called to Abraham to stay his
[1:57:00] hand but then in Genesis 22 and 20 25 22
[1:57:05] 15 and 16
[1:57:06] he calls unto Abraham the second time
[1:57:09] and he said by myself have I sworn saith
[1:57:11] the Lord because thou has done this
[1:57:13] thing though it's not withheld thy son
[1:57:15] thine only son that in blessing I will
[1:57:18] bless thee and in multiplying I will
[1:57:21] multiply thy seed as the stars of the
[1:57:24] heaven and as the sand which is upon the
[1:57:26] seashore and dies seed shall possess the
[1:57:30] gates of his enemies and in thy seed
[1:57:33] shall all the nations of the earth be
[1:57:36] blessed because thou hast obeyed my
[1:57:40] place that's what was happening the
[1:57:45] whole time
[1:57:46] Abraham was obeying his voice his word
[1:57:51] but ever as the word would continue to
[1:57:54] open it would require a greater faith
[1:57:56] but for a greater faith Abraham couldn't
[1:58:00] work yourself up into that God had to
[1:58:02] provide that so with that word that God
[1:58:05] was expressing God was also quickening
[1:58:08] that word to Abraham and that's why what
[1:58:12] we must have is that quickening the Lord
[1:58:15] the Spirit of God coming and quickening
[1:58:17] that word two hearts quickening into our
[1:58:19] hearts quickening it to arts this is
[1:58:22] this promise you and I are living by
[1:58:25] this promise right here this morning the
[1:58:29] seed it has come and it has possessed
[1:58:32] the gates of the enemy there was a
[1:58:36] necessary transaction at the gates and
[1:58:39] he met the transaction is that right
[1:58:42] we met the elders at the gate and there
[1:58:45] was a transaction at the gate he settled
[1:58:48] the transaction at the gate and the
[1:58:51] close he settled the transaction at the
[1:58:53] gate he told the Church of the Living
[1:58:55] God that the gates of Hell cannot
[1:58:58] prevail against it there's not a
[1:59:00] transaction of handle that can come
[1:59:02] against this church
[1:59:04] and because of that heroes on the Easter
[1:59:07] morning the gates of hell could not keep
[1:59:11] him the gates of the grave could not
[1:59:13] keep him the gates of death could not
[1:59:14] keep him and he arose and he led
[1:59:18] captivity captive and captivity captive
[1:59:21] being led up there they spoke and those
[1:59:23] that were there within the gates they
[1:59:26] said open up all ye everlasting gates
[1:59:29] and be ye open up who is this King of
[1:59:36] glory
[1:59:38] see they were able to say they were
[1:59:40] waiting in paradise for the transaction
[1:59:43] to be made but the transaction had been
[1:59:47] made they had been living for that
[1:59:49] transaction and here they were they
[1:59:51] arose there that morning it was not him
[1:59:53] that gave the direct does another hear
[1:59:56] the declaration is the Lord mighty in
[1:59:58] battle they said the Lord mighty in
[2:00:01] battle who is it that says he is Lord
[2:00:06] the Holy Ghost in you says he is Lord
[2:00:10] [Applause]
[2:00:13] he's the risen Christ in you Christ says
[2:00:17] I am the risen Christ
[2:00:19] so whatever whatever the need is the
[2:00:25] transaction has already what's needed
[2:00:28] has already been fulfilled in Christ all
[2:00:32] that we have to do is go to the gates
[2:00:35] with authority to receive and a juror
[2:00:40] Satan he must give transaction has been
[2:00:45] made for any promise of God in every
[2:00:47] promise of God the necessary transaction
[2:00:50] has already been made I'll say it this
[2:00:54] simple there are no excuse to walk out
[2:00:57] of here living below your privileges
[2:01:01] whatever your need is friends and I mean
[2:01:03] it because God knows how to speak to you
[2:01:04] personally and bring a need up before
[2:01:06] you in your life but just take that need
[2:01:08] and say I'm standing here with my token
[2:01:10] I'm standing here with my token the
[2:01:13] token that he has given me and I'm
[2:01:15] standing at the gate because the token
[2:01:17] speaks that the transaction has been
[2:01:19] fulfilled and he's there to back up that
[2:01:23] word you stand on that word and he's
[2:01:25] there to make that word alive and real
[2:01:28] to you not a word that you got to take
[2:01:32] from a preacher or anybody else God
[2:01:34] wants that word to be flesh in you to
[2:01:36] where it's pulsating like a stream of
[2:01:38] life through your life you're loving
[2:01:41] these are our promises not because we
[2:01:44] deserve them not because we're we're
[2:01:48] good because he's good because he's
[2:01:52] faithful and he clothes us by His mercy
[2:01:55] he'll called us to repent he directs us
[2:01:58] when we're wrong it's him that gives us
[2:02:00] a grace to live with a real genuine
[2:02:01] conviction not a conviction of fear but
[2:02:04] a conviction is says Lord that my walk
[2:02:07] be pleasing to you what I want my life
[2:02:11] to please you I love you I don't want to
[2:02:13] do anything Lord that would displease
[2:02:15] you in any way but I want my life to be

[2:03:26] mercy held and father as your prophet as

[2:04:35] they recognize this morning Lord that
