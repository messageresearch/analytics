[38:59] precious minerals that are beneath the

[39:11] lord what about our lives

[39:22] really their lord

[39:27] chaos
[39:28] beneath all the disorder

[39:34] a seed of god on the inside that
[39:38] needed light to reach it

[42:28] sunday whatever he starts
[42:30] he finishes he don't leave no job half
[42:34] half done he finishes it out amen
[42:37] so let's let's begin reading here i want
[42:39] to go back to verse 1 and then we'll
[42:41] come down from there
[42:42] paul says though i speak with the
[42:44] tongues of men
[42:46] and of angels and i have not charity
[42:49] i've become as a sounding brass or a
[42:52] tingling symbol
[42:54] and though i have the gift of prophecy
[42:56] and understand all mysteries
[42:58] and all knowledge though i have all
[43:00] faith
[43:01] so that i could remove mountains and
[43:04] have not charity
[43:05] i am nothing my goodness i mean if we're
[43:08] just looking at what we see out here we
[43:10] would say
[43:11] my goodness that's it right there but
[43:13] paul says though i have all of that and
[43:15] if i don't have
[43:16] charity all right it's nothing it's
[43:19] nothing
[43:20] it doesn't need to add up to nothing
[43:23] though i bestow all my goods to feed the
[43:26] poor
[43:26] and though i give my body to be burned
[43:30] and have not charity it profiteth me
[43:32] nothing
[43:33] of all the great sacrifices that we
[43:35] could make but yet if
[43:36] charity is not governing it it's not
[43:39] even wrecking to our account
[43:42] it's nothing verse four charity
[43:45] suffereth long and is kind
[43:48] i want you to notice we've been looking
[43:50] at this here for some time
[43:51] notice how paul then will go right into
[43:53] this this verse and then into the next
[43:55] verse of what
[43:56] it is not charity envyeth not
[43:59] it bonneth not itself and is not puffed
[44:03] up
[44:04] doth not behave itself
[44:07] on semen seeketh not our own
[44:10] is not easily provoked and think of
[44:14] no evil amen may god bless the word
[44:17] as you're being seated tonight we want
[44:20] to look here
[44:22] for a few moments here in the in the
[44:24] first part of that verse of first
[44:26] corinthians 13
[44:27] 5 and you see there's many things that
[44:30] even that we have been looking at here
[44:32] within charity and what paul was dealing
[44:34] with it's a real
[44:35] substance in our life this is not a
[44:38] charity in which when
[44:39] it speaks of charity it's speaking of
[44:42] that of
[44:43] the very love of god that's not
[44:46] something that you or i can
[44:48] attain to in our lives but it is so
[44:52] it's a sovereign work of almighty god
[44:55] it's god that begins to deal with our
[44:57] heart deal with our life
[44:59] and it's we surrender to his call
[45:03] and as he begins to work in our life
[45:05] from repentance and
[45:07] then into being baptized in the name of
[45:10] the lord jesus christ it's just
[45:11] it's simply just taking god at his word
[45:14] of the promise
[45:15] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[45:17] spirit
[45:18] it's all it's all in love it's looking
[45:21] and knowing that what god has promised
[45:24] god is faithful
[45:26] to fulfill that promise and
[45:29] so this is of the charity it's the very
[45:32] love of god it's god's own life that god
[45:36] would deposit into our life and then
[45:38] through that
[45:39] the working of his life in us remember
[45:42] how paul would say
[45:43] in one place of the scripture in in
[45:46] thessalonians he would say
[45:48] of how that were to love one another he
[45:50] said you need
[45:51] no man teach you for you are taught of
[45:54] god
[45:56] because even in the expression once that
[45:59] has been expressed to us
[46:00] we've caught that from god then we
[46:03] recognize
[46:04] that it was god who loved us when we
[46:07] were unlovable
[46:08] it was the love of god that reached to
[46:11] us and looked beyond
[46:12] everything even of the times that we
[46:15] ignored his call
[46:16] even when he tried to deal with this
[46:18] even of the little things that god
[46:20] would have done that we we just walked
[46:22] right on past but it was god
[46:24] watching over our life all along and
[46:28] even to this moment but to but to see
[46:31] that how that that charity itself as
[46:34] paul would write of this it's a real
[46:36] substance in a life it's something
[46:38] that's behind that
[46:40] should be a real substance behind the
[46:43] gift and these things that we read about
[46:45] in the first part
[46:46] of first corinthians 13 these are things
[46:49] that can be all
[46:50] seen out here and demonstrated out here
[46:53] but yet if there's not a real substance
[46:56] of charity
[46:57] behind that it's nothing
[47:00] it means nothing at all and this
[47:04] is why when brother branham would tell
[47:05] us in the message of prisoner
[47:08] he would speak to us and say don't ever
[47:10] judge
[47:11] your life by how many miracles or
[47:14] signs or wonders or gifts he said don't
[47:17] ever judge it by that
[47:18] but judge your life by the sweetness and
[47:21] the humility
[47:22] to the word of god in your life that's a
[47:25] real prisoner because
[47:27] a prisoner is one who is yoked to the
[47:30] word
[47:30] by the holy spirit times we can feel a
[47:34] pull because as we're still here
[47:36] within this body but a prisoner is a
[47:39] prisoner
[47:39] to the word where we want to so lose
[47:43] sight of ourselves i want to continue to
[47:45] lose sight
[47:46] of myself this is the desire
[47:49] this is what a real a real prisoner in
[47:53] how to be or how that a real prisoner of
[47:56] the lord
[47:57] is further becoming and so when we look
[48:00] at this here
[48:00] tonight as you see the scripture says
[48:04] does not behave itself unseemly this is
[48:07] dealing with
[48:08] an expression it's dealing with a
[48:11] behavior
[48:12] and so when we look at this one of the
[48:15] thoughts that
[48:15] one of the things that i want to just
[48:17] look at and maybe just to drop this and
[48:19] i don't know if i'll get to this tonight
[48:21] but i want you to remember that though
[48:24] you can come from whatever state or
[48:27] whatever country you come from and
[48:29] there might be certain characteristics
[48:31] you bear of that country or that
[48:34] city or whatever you come from but when
[48:37] we have become a child of god by the
[48:40] spirit of god
[48:42] we no longer are holding to that first
[48:45] birth that first nationality or
[48:48] ethnicity however you want to put it
[48:50] we now recognize there's a greater
[48:53] calling in our life
[48:55] we still bear the reflection in this
[48:58] life
[48:58] as the scripture said it's a bride out
[49:00] of many
[49:01] kindreds nations and tongues but the
[49:04] sovereignty of how that god has
[49:06] assembled his people
[49:08] unto himself that you begin to recognize
[49:11] that yes we have a natural family but
[49:14] you recognize i am
[49:16] part of the family of almighty god
[49:19] from that moment on you recognize
[49:21] yourself
[49:22] as a pilgrim and a stranger in this land
[49:25] you realize
[49:26] this is only a temporal journey you
[49:28] recognize that
[49:30] every moment and each time it's a
[49:32] molding it's a shaping this time that
[49:35] we're here
[49:36] is a time for an opportunity to make a
[49:38] decision
[49:39] a time god gives us an opportunity in
[49:42] this
[49:43] life to receive a real
[49:46] pardon from sin to receive a release to
[49:49] receive eternal life
[49:50] and then to walk and make ready for that
[49:54] for that land that is coming in
[49:57] because remember in that land what we
[50:00] are going to
[50:01] even in the millennium and then into the
[50:04] future home
[50:05] remember it is not something that just
[50:08] for you and i even say well you know i'm
[50:10] just going to be over there but
[50:12] god after he gets a hold of your life he
[50:15] molds your character he shapes you as a
[50:18] matter of fact brother rem says he does
[50:20] this with
[50:20] nail scarred hands and he molds us
[50:23] and trains us to be conformed to his own
[50:27] image because we are his children
[50:31] begotten by him and he is
[50:34] faithful to raise us and to
[50:37] build us up and mold us even through the
[50:40] tests and trials we go through
[50:42] there's a purpose in it and saying all
[50:44] that i say it for this
[50:46] we have a greater representation
[50:50] we have a greater constitution that we
[50:54] are a part of and that is of that new
[50:57] jerusalem
[50:58] of our future home we have a greater
[51:01] identity
[51:02] as a matter of fact if you went from
[51:04] this nation
[51:05] to another nation they would say oh
[51:08] you're american
[51:09] but remember when you've been born of
[51:11] the spirit of god
[51:12] they can say you're a christian because
[51:15] we are identified by the spirit from
[51:19] that land and our lives are under the
[51:22] governance and the direction of the holy
[51:25] spirit himself
[51:26] who is the word so then there's an
[51:29] expression out of our life
[51:32] as delegates of that new city we're
[51:34] heading there
[51:35] this is where this is where we're going
[51:38] right now is the time of the molding and
[51:41] the shaping of our character
[51:43] and we can truly say amen to this
[51:46] character molding is not the funnest
[51:48] part
[51:50] character molding is not something that
[51:52] you or i would just stick our hand up
[51:54] and say
[51:54] hey i'll take a little bit more of that
[51:56] but we know that that's what's needed
[51:59] and
[51:59] god always gives to us just what we need
[52:03] just as we're able to handle it and he
[52:06] gives us the grace to come through it
[52:08] oh i tell you i thank him for that the
[52:11] bible and just
[52:12] thinking of this i this scripture i'm
[52:14] just drawn to the scripture here
[52:16] in romans 12 9 and then we'll read down
[52:19] to verse 10.
[52:21] it says let love be without
[52:23] dissimilation that means without
[52:25] hypocrisy
[52:26] abort that which is evil cleave to that
[52:29] which is good so
[52:31] these are things that as a believer
[52:34] abort that which is evil but
[52:36] cleave to that which is good be
[52:39] kindly affection one to another with
[52:42] brotherly love
[52:43] in honor preferring one another
[52:48] i want to just this is where i'm drawn
[52:50] to on this part
[52:51] that charity does not behave itself
[52:54] unseemly
[52:56] and that that whole phrase it means it
[52:59] doesn't act
[53:00] rudely or unbecomingly right
[53:03] and to see that this is part of of an
[53:06] expression and in honor preferring one
[53:10] another you know
[53:11] there's there's really only one honor
[53:14] that we need to seek
[53:15] and that's the honor that comes from god
[53:19] everything gets into trouble when it
[53:21] tries to find honor one from another
[53:23] and faith is broken and everything else
[53:26] just it goes haywire
[53:28] this is why only real honor is the honor
[53:31] that comes from god
[53:32] oh other honor it fades away it's
[53:35] temporary and men lose their souls and
[53:37] they lose
[53:38] everything else because they seek after
[53:40] the honor of men instead of after the
[53:42] honor of god
[53:43] when the lord jesus came remember he
[53:45] came among a bunch of religious
[53:48] people in that time and they were
[53:50] seeking honor
[53:51] one from another even some who would not
[53:54] even make a decision or stand up for
[53:56] their son
[53:57] when he was healed they were afraid
[53:59] about being kicked out
[54:00] of the synagogue why they honored more
[54:04] their their the pharisee down there or
[54:07] the priests they honored them more
[54:09] than they honored the word and so
[54:12] now when it comes to it this is where it
[54:15] shows to you and i
[54:16] that even when we don't understand and
[54:19] many times
[54:20] we don't understand but to recognize the
[54:22] word we can say lord
[54:24] i honor you lord and by giving ourselves
[54:27] to him
[54:28] god will unfold it god will interpret it
[54:31] god will open our understanding he's not
[54:34] asking you and i have to do that
[54:36] as brother brian sung that song be it
[54:38] unto me according to thy word
[54:40] that's honoring god
[54:44] just let god do what god does so
[54:47] we honor god by standing on his word
[54:51] this is what the scripture in honor
[54:54] preferring one another so
[54:55] this is not this honor it's not speaking
[54:59] of
[54:59] an earthly honor that
[55:02] that is of this world this is speaking
[55:05] of
[55:06] in honor preferring one another this is
[55:09] a real honor
[55:10] it's this word it deals with a price
[55:13] that is placed on something
[55:15] a price which is of a value a price
[55:18] either
[55:18] that has been paid for something it's an
[55:21] honor
[55:21] the word honor also deals with honor
[55:25] which belongs or is shown to one
[55:28] and i think we can wholeheartedly agree
[55:31] there's times that there's honor
[55:33] it doesn't belong to someone but yet we
[55:36] honor them anyhow
[55:38] are you with me but iran teaches us that
[55:40] the spirit of god through the scriptures
[55:42] teaches that
[55:43] even where brother bram says when you
[55:44] cannot honor the man you honor the
[55:47] office is that right respecting the
[55:50] office peter would write
[55:51] honor all men love the brother
[55:53] brotherhood honor the king
[55:56] is that right these are scriptural so
[55:58] these are principles
[56:00] and i i'll say it in this manner that
[56:02] they are principles that just doesn't
[56:05] apply when it's convenient for us
[56:08] or when everything is going our way or
[56:10] everybody agrees with us and my
[56:12] we're right on the same bullet points
[56:14] and we know
[56:15] this these scriptures call for
[56:18] expression
[56:19] when everybody's not on the same bullet
[56:21] points as you and i
[56:23] when everybody doesn't go along with the
[56:25] way
[56:26] we think or we feel but this is where
[56:28] the real
[56:30] character and charity is expressed even
[56:33] in this time
[56:34] even in our behavior
[56:38] a price that is fixed here you know a
[56:41] price
[56:41] the scripture says in first corinthians
[56:43] 6 20 for you are bought with a prize
[56:47] therefore glorify god in your body
[56:50] and in your spirit which are gods
[56:53] this is a price we've been bought with
[56:55] the price
[56:56] what price have we been bought with
[56:58] we've been bought
[56:59] not with silver or gold we've been
[57:02] bought with the precious
[57:04] blood of the lamb
[57:08] and to recognize that even in these
[57:10] things our
[57:11] how paul would write of it in this way
[57:13] in colossians 1 21
[57:15] you that were sometimes alienated and
[57:18] enemies in your mind
[57:19] by wicked works yet now hath he
[57:22] reconciled in the body of his flesh
[57:25] through death to present you holy
[57:29] unblameable unreprovable in
[57:32] his sight
[57:35] i want you to catch this for a moment in
[57:37] his sight
[57:39] in the sight of the world and others
[57:43] perhaps many of us could have been
[57:44] rolled off as a lost cause
[57:49] it's true and in reality i don't care it
[57:52] doesn't matter
[57:52] how good you were how good anybody was
[57:56] without the mercy of god
[58:00] we would still be trapped
[58:04] we needed someone a kinsmen
[58:08] to come to you and ask and to bring
[58:12] the price of ransom to be able to
[58:16] set us free and then that that faith
[58:19] from that
[58:20] act could begin to rise in our hearts to
[58:23] believe
[58:24] what he has already done for me
[58:27] and grace to act upon it
[58:30] in his sight i mature
[58:34] in the site of the town of samaria
[58:38] the woman at the well would have never
[58:39] been deemed worthy
[58:41] but in his sight you see his side
[58:44] goes deeper than what can be seen on the
[58:47] outside
[58:48] his side was it goes to the depth to
[58:52] know what the real
[58:53] need is down there and to think if in
[58:56] his sight in his side here we are
[58:59] standing
[59:00] with the holy spirit in our life
[59:02] identified as
[59:04] holy unblameable and unreprovable
[59:07] because we are not the same people
[59:10] we used to be we've been
[59:14] changed there's no longer the tie to
[59:17] that former
[59:18] life our ears have been open to hear
[59:22] his voice we're not hearing the word as
[59:25] a stranger
[59:26] we're hearing the word as friends and
[59:29] daughters of god
[59:31] that's an act of the holy ghost you know
[59:34] right
[59:35] in his sight
[59:40] brother branham says in the sight of the
[59:42] church
[59:43] you can backslide but he said in his
[59:46] sight
[59:48] there is a bumper of blood and god
[59:51] cannot see you through the blood
[59:54] she said to others you could backslash
[59:57] but to god you cannot
[59:59] backslide because your life is hidden
[1:00:02] in christ
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:06] in his sight
[1:00:10] but don't we appreciate that then
[1:00:13] then we must apply it and recognizing
[1:00:16] that
[1:00:16] in his sight brother branham could say
[1:00:19] it like this
[1:00:20] he said if i had a little charger
[1:00:23] maybe let's say like this bottle of
[1:00:25] water here
[1:00:26] and let's just say it had within it some
[1:00:29] of the literal
[1:00:30] drops of his blood oh he said i would
[1:00:33] take that and
[1:00:35] i would hold it to my bosom and say how
[1:00:38] precious that is
[1:00:39] this blood that was for me
[1:00:42] he said but i recognize sitting here
[1:00:45] tonight
[1:00:46] is something of greater value
[1:00:49] than his blood because he was willing
[1:00:52] to shed his blood for you and i
[1:00:56] we are the purchase of that blood
[1:00:59] so in his side he deemed
[1:01:02] us worthy and more precious
[1:01:06] than his own blood for he shed his own
[1:01:09] blood
[1:01:10] that he might bring us back to him to
[1:01:13] open the way
[1:01:14] that we might come back to him as sons
[1:01:16] and daughters of god
[1:01:17] it's it's a greater price that's in his
[1:01:20] sight so
[1:01:21] to recognize the value in his life
[1:01:25] to recognize who it is you are
[1:01:28] to recognize who's sitting beside you to
[1:01:31] recognize
[1:01:32] who's around you are you with me
[1:01:35] in his sight we're talking about
[1:01:38] sons and daughters of god
[1:01:41] i want you to think of this here
[1:01:45] in psalms 105 verse 11
[1:01:49] a very tremendous chapter brother brown
[1:01:51] will take this and
[1:01:53] he'll read almost from verse one but i'm
[1:01:55] not going to
[1:01:56] and you preach the message respects if
[1:01:58] you haven't listened to that in a while
[1:01:59] it'd be good
[1:02:01] but brown i want you to catch what is
[1:02:03] dealing with this here
[1:02:05] in verse 11 of psalms 105 saying
[1:02:09] unto thee this is what god had said unto
[1:02:11] abraham and
[1:02:12] jacob and isaac saying unto thee will i
[1:02:15] give the land of canaan
[1:02:17] the lot of your inheritance when they
[1:02:19] were but a few men in number
[1:02:21] yey very few and strangers in it
[1:02:24] when they went from one nation to
[1:02:26] another from one
[1:02:28] kingdom to another people he suffered no
[1:02:31] man to do them wrong
[1:02:33] yeah he reproved kings for their sakes
[1:02:37] saying touch not mine anointed and do my
[1:02:40] prophets no harm
[1:02:42] now remember here is god
[1:02:45] guiding guiding israel he's directing
[1:02:48] them here he brings them out of egypt
[1:02:50] remember
[1:02:51] god called him out of egypt he says not
[1:02:55] because
[1:02:55] that the lord loved you anymore but he
[1:02:58] had a
[1:02:59] promise that he made to the fathers
[1:03:02] and you are a part of that promise
[1:03:06] and god has come to confirm
[1:03:09] and fulfill that promise and how that
[1:03:12] god
[1:03:12] guided them through the wilderness
[1:03:14] taking care of their clothing
[1:03:16] taking care of their food and of their
[1:03:19] water god
[1:03:20] is a provider what a testimony we could
[1:03:23] preach on that
[1:03:24] god will never call you to do anything
[1:03:27] without
[1:03:27] providing the means to do it
[1:03:31] he is jehovah jireh
[1:03:34] he provides for himself because if he
[1:03:36] put it on your heart
[1:03:37] he's only asking to borrow your body
[1:03:40] it'll be him do it and he'll provide all
[1:03:42] that's necessary
[1:03:44] god as they walked with god here they
[1:03:46] were
[1:03:47] they were not an army as far as a
[1:03:50] trained group of people
[1:03:51] but they were marching out under the
[1:03:53] word
[1:03:54] the pillar of fire and cloud by day and
[1:03:57] here they are
[1:03:58] moving not as a trained army but god
[1:04:01] even as they walk with just simple
[1:04:04] honor to the word of god coming through
[1:04:07] his servant moses
[1:04:08] god displaced kingdoms they wouldn't let
[1:04:11] them pass by the
[1:04:12] king's way and god displaced them god
[1:04:16] god would come against them god would
[1:04:19] not allow
[1:04:20] his people to be touched or to be
[1:04:23] to come upon and be vexed now we know
[1:04:25] that there were those
[1:04:26] who came in that way they would come at
[1:04:28] them and god
[1:04:30] even held it in the place of amalek and
[1:04:32] god said i'll remember from generation
[1:04:34] to generation
[1:04:35] what amalek has done i'm glad that god
[1:04:37] still remembers tonight
[1:04:39] what amalek has done i'm glad he
[1:04:41] remembers what what took place right
[1:04:43] there
[1:04:43] in the garden of eden when the enemy
[1:04:45] came in against the
[1:04:46] weak one he came down i'm glad that the
[1:04:49] strong one
[1:04:50] tonight still makes himself no i've not
[1:04:54] forgot my covenant i've not forgot the
[1:04:57] trap you've been in
[1:04:58] but i'm here and i stand with my hands
[1:05:01] up
[1:05:01] in the air as a deliverance in your life
[1:05:06] god remembers his word
[1:05:10] glory be to god and you know not only
[1:05:12] does god remember his word
[1:05:13] god even remembers the attitude you and
[1:05:15] i take to it
[1:05:16] in the book of malachi there was an
[1:05:18] ascribing angel that while the word is
[1:05:21] going forth an
[1:05:22] angel is ascribing the attitude that the
[1:05:25] people have
[1:05:26] toward the word as it's coming forth is
[1:05:28] that right
[1:05:29] it's a book of remembrance oh aren't you
[1:05:32] glad
[1:05:33] oh you say i don't understand at all it
[1:05:35] will watch your attitude towards it
[1:05:37] if your attitude you see because it's
[1:05:39] just like the prophet tells talks to us
[1:05:41] about
[1:05:42] the opening of the seventh seal and that
[1:05:44] quickening power
[1:05:45] the lord coming among us it depends on
[1:05:47] the attitude you take
[1:05:48] toward it as whether it'll do you any
[1:05:50] good or not
[1:05:51] is that right it depends on the attitude
[1:05:54] when god asks you to do something
[1:05:56] when he told them about remember the the
[1:05:58] the
[1:05:59] the hear the the empty uh uh jugs at the
[1:06:02] the uh there it came at the marriage
[1:06:04] feasts when they were empty
[1:06:06] and he said go fill them with water it
[1:06:08] depended on the attitude that they took
[1:06:10] at that time but there was an attitude
[1:06:13] they heeded to a word that said
[1:06:14] just do what he said unto you to do
[1:06:17] don't try to figure it out just go do it
[1:06:19] they did their part but he came and did
[1:06:22] only what he could do what made the
[1:06:25] difference their
[1:06:26] attitude towards the word my mama
[1:06:33] touch not mine anointed and do my
[1:06:35] prophets no harm
[1:06:37] you see it's honoring god
[1:06:42] when they honored moses it wasn't just
[1:06:44] moses
[1:06:45] they're honoring god being manifest in
[1:06:48] moses
[1:06:50] are you with me when they honored elisha
[1:06:53] they were honoring god being made
[1:06:56] manifest
[1:06:56] in elijah
[1:07:00] recognizing god
[1:07:04] touch not mine anointed and do my
[1:07:06] prophets
[1:07:07] no harm how that god
[1:07:11] would would guide israel through this
[1:07:14] now let me just drop a few things here
[1:07:16] in the scripture as as we're reading in
[1:07:18] honor preferring
[1:07:20] one another this word prefer it means to
[1:07:24] go before or to show the way to go
[1:07:27] before our lead
[1:07:29] to go before as a leader
[1:07:33] this deal this this display of honor
[1:07:37] it's not something that is just to be
[1:07:40] told but the real preferring one another
[1:07:44] in honor
[1:07:45] is show me
[1:07:49] and it's not me saying brother richard
[1:07:51] show me it's where brother richard might
[1:07:53] see something
[1:07:54] or somebody else see something and
[1:07:56] instead of just taking you know the
[1:07:58] oh well here this needs
[1:08:01] but there's sometimes where there's
[1:08:03] things
[1:08:05] be an example be an example to how it's
[1:08:09] done
[1:08:10] it's like you think maybe somebody says
[1:08:12] oh my goodness
[1:08:14] i tell you what these young people i
[1:08:16] tell you what they they need to
[1:08:18] they're getting too caught up you know
[1:08:20] when they're playing volleyball or
[1:08:21] whatever
[1:08:22] somebody needs to show them that points
[1:08:23] don't matter we'll get in the court and
[1:08:25] show them
[1:08:27] don't lecture them show them
[1:08:30] preach somebody be an example
[1:08:34] let them see an example this is
[1:08:37] part of honor in honor preferring one
[1:08:41] another
[1:08:41] let somebody be the go before hey this
[1:08:44] is this is the scripture
[1:08:46] this is what god himself came down he
[1:08:49] did not come down
[1:08:50] with an addendum to the commandments and
[1:08:53] say
[1:08:53] here here's another uh load of writings
[1:08:57] no he came down as the expression
[1:09:00] of the writings he was the very nature
[1:09:03] of
[1:09:03] god that was on display for you and i
[1:09:07] this is so that you and i we can see god
[1:09:10] this is why john can say
[1:09:12] we have handled of the word of life with
[1:09:14] our hands
[1:09:17] it's that god on display
[1:09:22] and if i might say it it's like when
[1:09:23] brother branham as he came to jamaica
[1:09:26] and the president president this is not
[1:09:27] even a believer the president talked
[1:09:29] about billy crown
[1:09:30] coming into jamaica and he said oh my we
[1:09:33] had wonderful meetings and
[1:09:35] you know and then another brother oh we
[1:09:36] had wonderful meetings he said but when
[1:09:39] william branham came god came and
[1:09:42] visited us
[1:09:44] he wasn't putting brother adam as god
[1:09:46] but he's letting me know
[1:09:48] there was something a greater one who
[1:09:51] was
[1:09:51] in our midst
[1:09:54] i say tonight god will stand and be your
[1:09:58] representative amen
[1:10:02] oh god what a compliment
[1:10:05] preferring one another you see this is
[1:10:08] why
[1:10:09] must always prefer one another
[1:10:13] just referring to some quotes he said
[1:10:15] that's the life of christ
[1:10:17] is to prefer your brother or sister and
[1:10:19] if they are wrong
[1:10:21] listen to these words now i'm dragging
[1:10:24] my feet purposely
[1:10:25] if they are wrong that's all right
[1:10:29] you'll never make them any better by
[1:10:32] kicking them around
[1:10:34] put an arm around them pick them up
[1:10:39] is that right that's
[1:10:43] brother batman true in here in another
[1:10:44] place and he's talking about david
[1:10:48] and he says of reverence
[1:10:51] we ought to honor one another and
[1:10:54] respect one another
[1:10:55] as brother and sister
[1:10:58] and love one another with undying
[1:11:02] love he said people say well i just
[1:11:05] can't he said
[1:11:05] you just stay there long enough until
[1:11:08] you feel that way
[1:11:10] amen you know brother branham would give
[1:11:12] him examples and i just
[1:11:14] many of these things you know is just as
[1:11:16] he brings it to my heart brother brown
[1:11:18] would talk about
[1:11:18] even staying in a prayer in a season of
[1:11:22] prayer
[1:11:23] until you feel different it wasn't gun
[1:11:25] christianizing people but it's
[1:11:27] recognizing that there are times
[1:11:29] that this guy has got to be brought
[1:11:33] in subjection and
[1:11:36] praying in a season of prayer you're not
[1:11:38] defeated
[1:11:39] you're raining are you hearing me you're
[1:11:42] reigning as a son and daughter of god
[1:11:46] if we're going to stand in dominion
[1:11:48] there in the millennium
[1:11:50] we got to start right now
[1:11:55] right this is not my inheritance but
[1:11:58] it's my
[1:11:59] possession is that right yeah
[1:12:02] so known as he said that's a real good
[1:12:04] sign of christianity when you can't
[1:12:06] from your heart this is very very
[1:12:07] important from your
[1:12:09] heart love those who do not love you
[1:12:12] love the unlovable and he goes and
[1:12:13] speaks about how the pharisees you know
[1:12:15] they
[1:12:15] only do favors for them who do favors
[1:12:18] for them you know scratch your
[1:12:19] scratch my back and i'll scratch yours
[1:12:22] and i like how brother brahman says in
[1:12:23] the message adoption he said i'll
[1:12:24] scratch yours whether you scratch mine
[1:12:26] or not
[1:12:28] amen this word came with the full
[1:12:31] character
[1:12:34] you say now you be kind to those who are
[1:12:36] unkind to you
[1:12:37] do good for those that would do evil for
[1:12:40] you
[1:12:41] always remember that keep it before you
[1:12:43] that god is watching you remember in his
[1:12:45] sight
[1:12:46] remember god was good to you when you
[1:12:50] were
[1:12:50] evil to him
[1:12:55] now in how god had spoke regarding
[1:12:58] how god would lead israel god led
[1:13:01] abraham
[1:13:03] and let's just look at even with abraham
[1:13:05] and the promise
[1:13:06] of how that god would speak to abraham
[1:13:09] and call abraham
[1:13:11] out of the of the land of chaldeas
[1:13:15] and remember abraham his back down in
[1:13:18] the lineage was
[1:13:19] his great great grandfather and i don't
[1:13:21] know how many greats to put in there of
[1:13:23] of noah but it was enough to where that
[1:13:26] abraham
[1:13:27] had heard that god had spoke to noah
[1:13:32] abraham's down there in a situation as
[1:13:34] an
[1:13:35] idolater or making idols brother bram
[1:13:38] tells us like this
[1:13:39] and faith is our victory he heard about
[1:13:42] god's visitation to noah and he got down
[1:13:46] and he prayed and he said god like you
[1:13:48] spoke to noah
[1:13:50] will you speak to me the same way amen
[1:13:54] it invited god to speak to abraham and
[1:13:57] say
[1:13:58] get thee out of the land of thy kingdom
[1:14:01] god came it was god dealing with abraham
[1:14:04] think about it
[1:14:05] i wonder how long that abraham had known
[1:14:08] that about noah
[1:14:09] how long that abraham maybe was going
[1:14:11] around and he knew about it
[1:14:13] but here he is a man of 75 years old i
[1:14:16] don't know when he prayed that prayer
[1:14:18] maybe he was 74 years old but really
[1:14:21] when it comes down to it how many years
[1:14:23] did he go along in life
[1:14:25] oh lord jesus this is why the bible says
[1:14:30] that direct them when they're young in
[1:14:32] the way that they shall go
[1:14:34] when they grow old they will not depart
[1:14:36] why there's
[1:14:37] more than doctrine that's been given
[1:14:40] it's a living
[1:14:42] expression of a living god
[1:14:45] it's a real substance or an anchor
[1:14:48] something to
[1:14:49] that they can come back to it's not you
[1:14:52] it's god
[1:14:55] that came back in that moment
[1:14:58] and here is here is abraham and remember
[1:15:01] what god told abraham
[1:15:03] he said when he called him out into the
[1:15:06] land that he would go
[1:15:08] god said i'll bless those that bless you
[1:15:12] amen and those that curse you i'll curse
[1:15:15] them
[1:15:17] now i want you to remember this
[1:15:21] that god when he made that statement
[1:15:24] it did not give abraham
[1:15:29] an occasion to the flesh are you hearing
[1:15:31] me
[1:15:32] it didn't just give him such a liberty
[1:15:34] that he could just act in your way
[1:15:37] but god is the god of his word
[1:15:40] and and the word itself that's him
[1:15:43] that's his
[1:15:44] nature that's his character abraham
[1:15:48] was a delegate of god he was
[1:15:51] looking and he he was being called by
[1:15:53] god
[1:15:54] into this place now remember he brought
[1:15:57] out
[1:15:58] his his you know his his father and
[1:16:01] and here lot came with him and he had
[1:16:04] them with him
[1:16:05] and then after his father passed away
[1:16:07] then they come into the land
[1:16:08] but now after a period of time
[1:16:13] there comes a situation in the camp
[1:16:17] of there of the air between abraham's
[1:16:20] herdman
[1:16:21] and lot's herdsmen now i want you to
[1:16:24] just to look at this scripture here in
[1:16:26] verse five it says
[1:16:28] lot also which went with abram had
[1:16:31] flocks and herds and tents
[1:16:32] and the land was not able to bear them
[1:16:35] that they might dwell together let me
[1:16:37] just pause here
[1:16:38] that was all in the plan of god
[1:16:43] god had already told him to separate
[1:16:47] but god knows how hard it is
[1:16:51] to be separated from
[1:16:54] those that you love
[1:16:58] and by new this this love that was
[1:17:00] within
[1:17:01] abraham filial love god didn't say
[1:17:04] why you got that old feeling of love god
[1:17:07] knows how hard it is
[1:17:09] so god already in his mind
[1:17:12] this was already laid out this was not
[1:17:14] an afterthought
[1:17:15] but god knows a situation
[1:17:18] will arise but in that situation
[1:17:22] god has confidence in his word that he's
[1:17:25] told
[1:17:26] in abraham that the word will make the
[1:17:29] choice
[1:17:30] of the word and the word will act like
[1:17:33] the word
[1:17:35] god's got confidence this is all now
[1:17:37] just like we've been saying the
[1:17:39] handkerchief to be here
[1:17:40] the glass is here it's god this
[1:17:43] situation
[1:17:44] that you and i could say oh my if lot
[1:17:46] would have just been over there
[1:17:47] oh my if this would have been over there
[1:17:49] oh my this would have never happened
[1:17:51] this was arranged by god
[1:17:54] that this strife would come
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:59] god let strife come between jacob
[1:18:02] and his father-in-law because he needed
[1:18:05] to get
[1:18:06] jacob he needed to get israel back in
[1:18:08] his homeland
[1:18:10] are you ready for me god knows exactly
[1:18:13] how to
[1:18:14] get us into position
[1:18:18] the bible says in verse 7 there was a
[1:18:21] strife
[1:18:22] between the herdman of abram's cattle
[1:18:25] and the herdman of lot's cat and the
[1:18:28] canaanite and the perizzite dwelled
[1:18:30] then in the land right
[1:18:33] it's very interesting the canaanite and
[1:18:35] the perizzite dwelled there in the land
[1:18:37] here are these unbelievers out here and
[1:18:39] they're going to sit and they're looking
[1:18:41] at
[1:18:41] wonder how they're going to handle this
[1:18:44] see somebody's watching somebody's
[1:18:47] watching you
[1:18:48] everybody else can do what everybody
[1:18:50] else does at work and you know what
[1:18:52] dog eat dog they expect that kind of
[1:18:55] stuff out of one another
[1:18:56] but they look at you amen
[1:18:59] somebody help me preach the parasite and
[1:19:02] canaanite they dwell in the land
[1:19:03] and abraham said unto lot look who took
[1:19:07] the initiative
[1:19:08] let there be no stride yes you do not
[1:19:11] record in these scriptures
[1:19:12] lot speaking up abraham spoke up
[1:19:15] right this is silver dollar
[1:19:19] this is part of silver dollar silver
[1:19:21] dollar isn't just
[1:19:22] oh i've heard directly the voice of god
[1:19:25] it's also the action
[1:19:27] receiving the life the character the
[1:19:30] person who was within the voice
[1:19:33] let there be no strife oh my
[1:19:36] god amen an absolute is a
[1:19:40] end of all strife you've got to have a
[1:19:43] real absolute to be able
[1:19:45] are you with me let me just stay with
[1:19:47] this not run with those
[1:19:49] it's so hard sometimes i have to run on
[1:19:50] them trails i praise thee
[1:19:52] between me and me and between my herdmen
[1:19:55] and thy herdmen
[1:19:56] for we be brethren
[1:20:01] the strife didn't change we're brothers
[1:20:04] it didn't change how i feel about you
[1:20:06] i'm letting you know we're still
[1:20:08] brothers
[1:20:09] abraham took the initiative to make sure
[1:20:12] we're not letting this change we're
[1:20:14] still
[1:20:16] reverent that's the son of god
[1:20:20] stepping up brother
[1:20:23] are you with me oh my mama look at he
[1:20:27] says
[1:20:27] is not the whole land before thee
[1:20:30] separate thyself i pray thee from me
[1:20:37] if i will take the left hand i'll go
[1:20:40] right
[1:20:41] if i'll depart to the right i'll go left
[1:20:44] in other words abraham said i'm going to
[1:20:47] give you the choice
[1:20:52] i'm going to give you the choice the
[1:20:55] direction that you that
[1:20:56] that you're going to go i'll go the
[1:20:58] opposite way all right
[1:21:00] now this is part of the testimony i want
[1:21:03] you to look
[1:21:04] you never find in the scripture here
[1:21:06] just to move through this
[1:21:07] you never find lot saying
[1:21:11] uncle you know you're a little bit up in
[1:21:14] age
[1:21:16] this land's barren you know what
[1:21:19] you probably should have the land that's
[1:21:21] a little bit better
[1:21:22] water i've seen some land down here that
[1:21:25] looks
[1:21:26] like the garden of eden but abraham said
[1:21:29] uh-huh there's been a lot of things that
[1:21:31] got this world in trouble of things that
[1:21:33] looked good all right but they can't see
[1:21:37] beyond it block didn't ask
[1:21:41] abraham lot did not prefer his brother
[1:21:44] are you with me
[1:21:45] he didn't prefer him lot just said all
[1:21:48] right
[1:21:48] i already know where i'm going then i'm
[1:21:50] going to this land where it's
[1:21:52] watered it just looks like the garden of
[1:21:55] the lord
[1:21:56] it's watered so nice my flocks are gonna
[1:21:59] go
[1:22:00] there and if you'd if you would have
[1:22:02] read lot's facebook post
[1:22:04] you'd have said this guy's all about lot
[1:22:09] instead of the song it's all about you
[1:22:11] jesus it's all about
[1:22:12] me jesus come on now
[1:22:16] you see this is lot he he had that way
[1:22:20] now let's just look at this just for a
[1:22:22] moment you see even within that part of
[1:22:25] it of how that lot
[1:22:26] would even display himself when the
[1:22:29] fussing had started
[1:22:30] abraham caused or said that's enough
[1:22:36] brother brown would say this like this
[1:22:37] say this over and over and let me just
[1:22:39] just to pick that up he's speaking of he
[1:22:42] says
[1:22:42] how did god abraham gave lot the
[1:22:44] opportunity if you go left
[1:22:46] i'll go right you go right now go left
[1:22:48] he said that's the christian way
[1:22:51] giving them benefit of the doubt
[1:22:55] how many of you know what that means
[1:22:56] benefit of the doubt benefit of the
[1:22:59] doubt
[1:22:59] means that there are times that somebody
[1:23:02] might say something to you
[1:23:04] and you could doubt it
[1:23:07] their actions and whatever more there
[1:23:09] might be things you could stand there
[1:23:11] and try to say okay you get your
[1:23:13] attorney i'll get my attorney
[1:23:15] they'll get our papers and i'll get your
[1:23:17] papers and we'll just settle this out
[1:23:19] because my
[1:23:20] points are going to be heard
[1:23:24] this is not what happened in this strife
[1:23:27] are you hearing me what happened in it
[1:23:30] over and over as brother brown tells us
[1:23:32] he gave lot the benefit
[1:23:35] of the doubt you know what that meant
[1:23:37] was
[1:23:38] released released
[1:23:41] now i want you to think about this
[1:23:43] giving the benefit
[1:23:45] of the doubt he said the ramp says like
[1:23:46] this he gave lot he said abraham acted
[1:23:49] as a christian would do
[1:23:50] showed that's god's faith the spirit in
[1:23:53] him
[1:23:54] he gave lot his own choice that's the
[1:23:56] way a christian spirit does
[1:23:58] it always goes the extra mile or gives
[1:24:02] the coat
[1:24:03] and it says here's the land before us
[1:24:06] we're not going to argue
[1:24:07] we're brothers i think that's something
[1:24:10] to be
[1:24:10] really applied right there to hold it in
[1:24:13] that manner
[1:24:14] we are brothers
[1:24:18] we are brothers it's a benefit brother
[1:24:21] brahm says
[1:24:22] that was the real christian spirit in
[1:24:23] abraham give
[1:24:25] even the enemy the benefit of the choice
[1:24:30] it got quiet in here we went from
[1:24:32] shouting to
[1:24:35] [Laughter]
[1:24:37] now look what paul says here in
[1:24:38] colossians 3 verse 12.
[1:24:41] i only be a few more moments put on
[1:24:43] therefore as the elect of god
[1:24:45] holy and beloved bows of mercy kindness
[1:24:48] humbleness of mind
[1:24:50] meekness long-suffering forbearing one
[1:24:53] another
[1:24:54] forgiving one another
[1:24:59] it's easy to forebear when you don't
[1:25:01] have to forebear
[1:25:03] amen i can forgive everybody when i
[1:25:05] don't have to forgive nobody
[1:25:09] wave offenses just wouldn't come
[1:25:12] offenses
[1:25:13] will come
[1:25:17] this is part of the testing and the
[1:25:20] shaping in our life
[1:25:24] there's still little prickers
[1:25:28] sticky parts about that carnal nature
[1:25:31] that
[1:25:31] sometimes things that people do or say
[1:25:34] just get
[1:25:35] caught in the thorns come on now
[1:25:39] sometimes in my house i look out my i
[1:25:41] look at the other day i'm looking out
[1:25:43] the office window and i'm sitting right
[1:25:44] there and i look out there where'd that
[1:25:46] piece of styrofoam come in my
[1:25:47] landscaping and
[1:25:48] got in my rose bush it took away from
[1:25:51] the beauty of my rose bush
[1:25:53] up around that dogwood what in the world
[1:25:56] or what it was
[1:25:57] it was just trash that was blowing along
[1:26:01] what happened to getting away was the
[1:26:03] thorns
[1:26:04] on that rose bush it needed a little bit
[1:26:08] of
[1:26:08] help to get it off of there because that
[1:26:12] rose bush
[1:26:13] didn't look too good with that piece of
[1:26:15] styrofoam like wrapper
[1:26:17] hung onto it and god knows how to get
[1:26:21] things off of you and i
[1:26:22] this is why we must be washed with the
[1:26:25] washing
[1:26:26] of water by the word
[1:26:29] because sometimes there's things that
[1:26:30] just get stuck
[1:26:32] there's things sometimes it gets stuck
[1:26:34] in our spirit
[1:26:36] stuck in our mind and we get stuck on
[1:26:39] and you want to say you've said the same
[1:26:41] thing over and over
[1:26:43] it's time to get over it
[1:26:46] amen mama
[1:26:56] if any man have a quarrel
[1:26:59] against any now it didn't say if
[1:27:00] anybody's got a core against you
[1:27:04] he said if you've got a quarrel a
[1:27:06] complaint
[1:27:07] against somebody great
[1:27:13] what should i do with that even as
[1:27:16] christ forgave you
[1:27:18] so also do ye thank you
[1:27:23] well they're gonna know that they
[1:27:24] displease me
[1:27:27] i'm gonna pout at them a little bit even
[1:27:30] as christ forgave you
[1:27:34] so also do ye and above all these things
[1:27:38] put on charity which is the bond
[1:27:42] of perfect this whole phrase of put on
[1:27:48] it sink into like a garment
[1:27:52] you see the charity on the inside
[1:27:55] being now displayed on the outside
[1:27:58] that which is long-suffering and kind
[1:28:01] that which is
[1:28:02] right here the tenderness the bowels of
[1:28:04] mercy
[1:28:05] it has to be displayed as the bond
[1:28:08] of perfectness that which
[1:28:11] we're a life is totally absorbed it's
[1:28:14] put on charity
[1:28:18] so what what do you see well you see a
[1:28:19] little bit of the blue shirt but
[1:28:21] now you see the jacket
[1:28:25] right put on charity now notice
[1:28:30] the benefit of the doubt i got to take
[1:28:32] this back off or i'll sweat it up
[1:28:34] i'm closing
[1:28:38] this is what i want you to catch me
[1:28:41] god god's choosing of abraham
[1:28:45] you know that that don't change god's
[1:28:47] choosing
[1:28:48] god's choosing is not altered god does
[1:28:50] not choose down here in time
[1:28:52] like people who choose kickball teams
[1:28:54] god didn't choose and say
[1:28:56] man shouldn't have chose that one
[1:29:00] god don't work that way right
[1:29:04] god molds us he shapes us
[1:29:08] he forgives us molds us
[1:29:12] shapes us we fill the test again
[1:29:16] molds us forgives us molds us
[1:29:20] shapes us see god's all about mastery
[1:29:23] learning
[1:29:24] man when i had a teacher in college
[1:29:26] first one ever told me i believe in
[1:29:27] mastery learning i thought what's that
[1:29:30] and what they said is you're going to
[1:29:32] pass the test
[1:29:34] if you got to take it over and over and
[1:29:36] over and over
[1:29:37] because i don't accept failures in my
[1:29:39] class now first i thought
[1:29:42] man that's great but you know what that
[1:29:44] did that took the
[1:29:46] off of it but you know what it didn't
[1:29:48] make me lose i studied for those tests
[1:29:52] and by the grace of god at least all
[1:29:54] that i can remember i didn't have to
[1:29:55] take
[1:29:56] i didn't have to take them over you see
[1:29:57] what it was mastery
[1:30:00] said you're going to pass it you might
[1:30:02] have to take it 100 times
[1:30:04] but you are going to pass it because
[1:30:06] greater
[1:30:07] is he that is in you
[1:30:09] [Applause]
[1:30:13] glory be to god and the christian
[1:30:15] attitude now that's within
[1:30:17] abraham it's not just abraham standing
[1:30:20] on the word of god
[1:30:22] honoring god's word but he's honoring
[1:30:24] the word of god
[1:30:25] and at the same time honoring the word
[1:30:28] he's also
[1:30:29] honoring lot without compromise
[1:30:32] he's not going along with lot like let's
[1:30:34] let's go on down that way and
[1:30:36] let's go no he's standing on the word
[1:30:38] honoring god
[1:30:41] god's beholding all this and at the same
[1:30:43] time
[1:30:44] he's honoring what
[1:30:47] you make the choice
[1:30:50] abraham didn't ask him now what started
[1:30:52] this
[1:30:55] whoo abraham probably knew better now he
[1:30:59] everyone's saying we ain't getting this
[1:31:00] in the pastoral office
[1:31:07] he gained the benefit of the doubt
[1:31:11] benefit of the doubt
[1:31:15] and notice how god honored his
[1:31:18] attitude god
[1:31:21] let abraham in the situation that god
[1:31:26] had already orchestrated and allowed to
[1:31:29] come to
[1:31:30] pass god stepped back
[1:31:35] and abraham displayed
[1:31:38] a real christian attitude
[1:31:42] and because of that once abraham was or
[1:31:46] lot was separated
[1:31:47] what did god sell to abraham abraham
[1:31:52] lift up now thine eyes
[1:31:55] look to the north look to the south look
[1:31:57] to these look all around you
[1:31:59] for the land i give it to you all right
[1:32:04] brother says it like this i close
[1:32:08] god saw that great move
[1:32:12] that abraham had done
[1:32:15] that great thing that he had submitted
[1:32:19] himself
[1:32:20] and give his brother the benefit
[1:32:23] of the doubt and took the lower part
[1:32:29] abraham what what part are you going to
[1:32:30] take i'm taking the barren lands
[1:32:34] you see within that when abraham gave
[1:32:37] that choice
[1:32:39] lot also showed what was in him
[1:32:44] but abraham even when it came time for
[1:32:47] judgment
[1:32:49] showing that abraham kept no records
[1:32:53] of evil he said lord
[1:32:57] per adventure there's 50. will you spare
[1:33:00] the city
[1:33:01] what about 40 30 brought it on down
[1:33:04] 10 who was he interceding for
[1:33:08] lot lot wasn't thinking about lot wasn't
[1:33:11] thinking lot didn't know what was coming
[1:33:13] on
[1:33:14] but look what the effect of this
[1:33:17] light did this revelation it continued
[1:33:20] to mold
[1:33:21] the very character within abraham to
[1:33:24] abraham's standing
[1:33:25] as a king and as a priest in honor
[1:33:29] referring to one another amen
[1:33:33] may god help us as delegates of that
[1:33:36] city
[1:33:37] lord mold me shape me lord
[1:33:41] help me to humble myself help me to take
[1:33:44] the things to you in prayer and
[1:33:46] just to be honest just to really lay our
[1:33:48] hearts out before god
[1:33:50] and lord jesus that you would help us to
[1:33:52] enter in on behalf of
[1:33:54] brother or sister or whatever it might
[1:33:56] be
[1:33:57] because remember lot was not
[1:34:01] a believer of the same quality of
[1:34:03] abraham doesn't mean now don't take this
[1:34:05] out of context it doesn't mean that
[1:34:06] everybody that doesn't
[1:34:08] agree with you or they're a penny no
[1:34:11] there's sometimes there's disagreements
[1:34:13] between silver dollars
[1:34:15] and sometimes there's disagreements and
[1:34:17] things between silver dollars and
[1:34:19] pennies
[1:34:20] and sometimes there's disagreements
[1:34:22] between silver dollars and
[1:34:24] things that are not even change wrote on
[1:34:26] the book of life
[1:34:28] but this is where the scripture says to
[1:34:30] honor all men
[1:34:34] is that right may god help us
[1:34:38] lord jesus
[1:34:41] i'm grateful lord for your mercy
[1:34:45] your word lord as you speak to us
[1:34:48] it challenges our hearts
[1:34:51] father there's we say man to it lord
[1:34:56] the desire from our heart is that our
[1:34:58] lives would be
[1:35:00] molded in your
[1:35:03] to your own glorious image
[1:35:07] lord these many of these scriptures
[1:35:10] these parts within it lord
[1:35:14] we need your help lord jesus
[1:35:17] because lord we know that this is not
[1:35:21] it doesn't just lie within us lord
[1:35:24] to move in this way but there's a
[1:35:26] longing the desire
[1:35:28] in our heart as believers is to please
[1:35:30] you lord jesus
[1:35:32] and lord to see how that you move
[1:35:36] oh god seeing abraham's
[1:35:39] attitude in that time lord you
[1:35:42] came down oh god and you spoke to
[1:35:46] abraham to look from where he was oh god
[1:35:50] he seen the land as that land of
[1:35:55] possession
[1:35:56] that land that belonged to him
[1:36:00] oh god help us lord
[1:36:04] help us these are lord this is what we
[1:36:07] desire lord that you would speak to us
[1:36:10] lord
[1:36:12] as you spoke to abraham lord that you
[1:36:15] lord
[1:36:15] speak to our hearts in that way help us
[1:36:17] lord
[1:36:19] help us lord to recognize that the
[1:36:23] footsteps of the
[1:36:24] righteous are ordered of the lord lord
[1:36:26] sometimes it's so easy for us to
[1:36:28] recognize it
[1:36:29] when it's things that are going our way
[1:36:31] when things don't rub against the grain
[1:36:34] but god help us to recognize when that
[1:36:37] does rub against the grain that it's
[1:36:39] that's the moment that lord
[1:36:42] we need to ask for your grace
[1:36:46] lord jesus to submit to the molding

[1:37:10] the love of god dwelling in us
[1:37:13] lord that love dwelling in our life it
[1:37:16] presses within us
[1:37:19] it moves within us even lord of
[1:37:21] something that may be that
[1:37:23] just the slightest little bit
[1:37:26] maybe it's been a thought maybe it's
[1:37:29] been some way that we've acted or
[1:37:31] or even the feeling about an action
[1:37:33] maybe it's not even an action that lord
[1:37:35] where a finger could be put on it but
[1:37:37] it's just something about it within us
[1:37:39] that we catch that point
[1:37:41] that's not us that's you lord
[1:37:46] oh god help us to be sensitive

[1:38:56] likely
[1:38:58] help us lord god not to get our eyes
[1:39:01] on the things of this earth
[1:39:05] help us lord to stand as abraham stood
[1:39:07] that day
[1:39:10] abraham realized he was heir
[1:39:13] to it all and because he recognized that
[1:39:18] it affected his conduct

[1:40:37] may lord god from even as her heart lord

[1:40:42] just to yield to you as you would deal
[1:40:45] with her

[1:40:49] just continue

[1:48:29] you can be seated if you
[1:48:34] if you can't see you can stand up i
[1:48:36] think they're going to try to show me
[1:48:37] okay okay i just want to give a quick
[1:48:40] testimony
[1:48:42] of how my sister came
[1:48:46] let's say 25 30 years ago my brother
[1:48:49] bill
[1:48:50] at one of our family functions
[1:48:54] he tried to talk to her and he left
[1:48:58] and i came a little later with my wife
[1:49:01] and i sat next to her and she was very
[1:49:03] upset
[1:49:04] because somehow she got the
[1:49:06] understanding that bill
[1:49:08] told her that she was going to go to
[1:49:10] hell if she didn't give her life dear
[1:49:11] lord
[1:49:12] and it took me 45 minutes to calm her
[1:49:15] down
[1:49:17] so it wasn't her time so
[1:49:20] you know we're close family but yet
[1:49:24] we didn't we we see each other mostly on
[1:49:27] the holidays and that
[1:49:29] but when it came time to hang around
[1:49:31] with my sister we didn't hang around i
[1:49:32] didn't hang around with her too much
[1:49:34] but what happened was after mary's
[1:49:37] sister mary died in march
[1:49:40] she came up from columbus she's been
[1:49:42] living there for three years
[1:49:43] she came up from columbus and i asked
[1:49:46] her to stay with me
[1:49:48] and maria so as she stayed with us
[1:49:51] one day her and i were in the kitchen
[1:49:55] and we're just talking
[1:49:57] and all of a sudden she starts telling
[1:49:58] me that the lord was dealing with her
[1:50:00] she's been
[1:50:02] checking things out and and i just sat
[1:50:04] there i just listened
[1:50:06] because i didn't think too much of it
[1:50:07] i'm just gonna let it go
[1:50:09] so i got to a place where she she
[1:50:12] started saying that
[1:50:14] she needed the lord and
[1:50:17] i still didn't do anything but then
[1:50:20] after we kept talking she started to cry
[1:50:24] and that's when i stood up and i went to
[1:50:26] her and i told her i said
[1:50:29] i'm gonna i said i'm gonna pray but i'm
[1:50:31] gonna ask you to ask the lord to forgive
[1:50:33] you
[1:50:34] and to come into your heart and that's
[1:50:37] what happened
[1:50:38] we prayed amen and she she gave her life
[1:50:42] to the lord
[1:50:43] now here we are 14 months later she's
[1:50:46] been locked up in columbus because she
[1:50:48] hasn't been able to come out much
[1:50:51] maybe i've seen her twice and talked to
[1:50:54] her a few times but
[1:50:55] in the meantime the lord's been doing
[1:50:58] the work
[1:50:59] still in her life and i and i and we go
[1:51:02] back to that we've talked a few times
[1:51:05] already how
[1:51:07] it wasn't her time when bill spoke to
[1:51:09] her
[1:51:10] i mean anybody could have talked to her
[1:51:12] it wasn't her time
[1:51:14] so it wasn't a work that bill did myself
[1:51:16] it was the lord
[1:51:18] because the bible says that no man comes
[1:51:20] to god unless god first draws them
[1:51:22] and as we were even sitting at the same
[1:51:24] spot today her and i
[1:51:26] she just she's surprised how the lord is
[1:51:29] still
[1:51:30] dealing with her life it's a shock
[1:51:33] because that's what the
[1:51:35] and i told her i said that's the way the
[1:51:37] lord works
[1:51:38] so we're in 14 months ago
[1:51:42] after i talked to her a little bit more
[1:51:45] i
[1:51:45] we talked to her about baptism and then
[1:51:48] i told her it says well when you get
[1:51:49] ready to baptize you
[1:51:51] bill and i will baptize you and she goes
[1:51:53] good
[1:51:54] she says good so here we are 14 months
[1:51:57] later
[1:51:58] i wouldn't have thought this and
[1:51:59] probably her in bill when they thought
[1:52:01] we're bad guys here
[1:52:03] so it's all the work of god and we're
[1:52:06] very grateful
[1:52:18] let's pray together
[1:52:22] gracious heavenly father we come before
[1:52:24] you thanking your lord for another soul
