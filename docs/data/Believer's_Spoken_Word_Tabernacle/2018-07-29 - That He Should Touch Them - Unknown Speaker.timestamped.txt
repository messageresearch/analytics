[0:00] about three weeks ago I got up early
[0:04] that day and I decided you know usually
[0:09] we go and do other stuff well I decided
[0:12] to put the Lord first and I said I'm
[0:15] going to go pray and spend some time
[0:17] with him I went downstairs and I was
[0:21] talking to him and then I remembered I
[0:24] said Lord I told him about the Michael
[0:27] and I asked him to please
[0:32] we were talking about him going OTR
[0:35] because everywhere he went they won't
[0:38] call them they give him an interview but
[0:41] that was it and my husband said there's
[0:45] no choice I'm gonna have to go well I
[0:47] was telling the Lord of that and I said
[0:49] lord I I wouldn't want my husband to go
[0:52] OTR I said please I said can you please
[0:55] have somebody call them that he could
[0:57] then you can work local here I'm that
[1:00] way you don't have to leave and I I went
[1:05] and heard a message and then I went to
[1:08] do my stuff I went outside of a lot of
[1:11] my friends my husband comes out for his
[1:13] phone I thought he was talking to his
[1:15] aunt and he um after he was done he said
[1:19] I have an interview tomorrow that was
[1:22] like four hours after the prayer and I I
[1:26] just looked at him and stayed quiet I
[1:28] didn't say nothing I was just waiting
[1:30] well the next day he went to the
[1:32] interview when he come back
[1:34] he told me he said well you know what
[1:37] these people treated me like I deserved
[1:39] to be treated they were so nice to me
[1:42] and he said well the guy told me he

[39:45] I be in the midst of them also Lord this
[39:49] is our comfort or God and Lord were

[40:50] same presence Lord the same Spirit of
[40:53] God that moved in the beginning that you
[40:55] would move once again this morning Lord
[40:58] by way of your word
[40:59] Oh God and father may there be
[41:02] atmospheres
[41:03] Oh God that are changed lives that are
[41:07] changed Lord even situations that Lord
[41:10] that we even might be looking at Lord
[41:13] and wondering oh god how but may you
[41:17] come Lord and may we be changed Lord to
[41:20] where we're no longer looking through an
[41:22] eyes of limitation of our own senses but
[41:26] we can see through the eye of God that
[41:29] all things are possible Lord we just ask
[41:32] that you would come Lord and just break
[41:35] the word to our hearts now we pray in
[41:38] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[41:42] I'm gonna read a few verses and then
[41:44] we'll let you have your seats I won't
[41:46] keep you out standing the whole time
[41:48] verse one of Mark 10 and he arose from
[41:53] thence come into the coasts of Judea by
[41:58] the farther side of Jordan and the
[42:01] people resort unto him again and he was
[42:04] want he taught them again and the
[42:07] Pharisees came to him and asked him is
[42:10] it lawful for a man to put away his wife
[42:13] tempting him so did they really want to
[42:17] know no they asked him tempting now you
[42:25] look at it and what they were anointed
[42:28] with to even ask a question such as the
[42:31] way that they could place that question
[42:33] you realize there's an anointing that
[42:35] they're under they asked the question
[42:40] tempting him and he answered and said
[42:43] unto them what did Moses command you I
[42:47] love how the Lord turns it around don't
[42:49] you even when they would asking me so
[42:53] well you know what the law says
[42:58] what did Moses command you and they said
[43:01] Moses suffered to write a bill of
[43:04] divorcement and to put her away and
[43:07] jesus answered and said unto them for
[43:11] the hardness of your heart he wrote you
[43:14] this precept but from the beginning of
[43:18] the creation God made them male and
[43:21] female and for this cause shall a man
[43:25] leave his father and mother and cleave
[43:28] to his wife and they twain shall be one
[43:31] flesh so then they are no more Twain but
[43:36] one flesh what therefore God hath joined
[43:40] together let not man put asunder it
[43:47] shows even in that verse that everything
[43:51] that God has brought together and is
[43:54] according to his word Satan is going to
[43:58] attack that Satan's attack listen now
[44:03] Satan's attack is not against the
[44:06] letters he's not Satan is not an anti
[44:09] word he's Antichrist so he comes against
[44:14] even what God has laid out within his
[44:18] word and so even within this this word
[44:23] that we read here in verse 9 what
[44:25] therefore God has joined together let
[44:27] not man put asunder I say with all her
[44:31] heart we don't take anything for granted
[44:34] and we should not take anything lightly
[44:37] but what God has done within our lives
[44:42] and our hearts then that is something
[44:45] that God also has entrusted with in our
[44:47] lives to keep it within that freshness
[44:50] and in the house his disciples asked him
[44:55] again of the same matter and he said
[44:57] unto them whosoever shall put away his
[45:00] wife and marry another committeth
[45:02] adultery against her and if a woman
[45:07] shall put away her husband
[45:08] and be married to another she committeth
[45:11] adultery may God bless His Word and
[45:15] bless you as you're being seated I like
[45:17] to continue to read continuing on there
[45:22] in verse 13
[45:29] and they brought young children to him
[45:33] that he should touch them and his
[45:38] disciples rebuked those that brought
[45:42] them think about this of how that the
[45:49] Lord Jesus in this moment these
[45:53] disciples if we can say it so much like
[45:57] this it wasn't just like they were new
[45:58] recruits but they had been around they
[46:01] had seen a lot of miracles they had seen
[46:04] many things taking place it shows even
[46:09] in this verse of scripture of where we
[46:13] continually need within our lives
[46:15] the continual checking and leadership of
[46:21] the Holy Spirit because what God was
[46:27] doing in Christ was not when God does
[46:31] something so great it isn't that it
[46:33] makes other things insignificant but yet
[46:36] it brings everything else in - it's
[46:39] right in proper place and I believe that
[46:43] there are things that were that God
[46:45] would admonish us in the scriptures you
[46:50] realized that the the Lord Jesus spoke
[46:53] to the Pharisees when they were so
[46:56] adamant about many things that was going
[46:58] on there within the temple and other
[47:01] things like that and you remember that
[47:02] the Lord Jesus mentions this in the book
[47:05] of Matthew it's recorded in this way but
[47:08] you have omitted the more weightier
[47:11] matters of the law they had been as far
[47:15] as tithing on anise and mint all there's
[47:17] all those things with that's all a part
[47:19] of the word but they had omitted what
[47:23] was to be the motivating force behind
[47:28] their keeping of the word and see what
[47:33] God recognizes is what is coming behind
[47:37] the offering and the sacrifice and that
[47:40] that omitting
[47:41] but the Branham brings us to this place
[47:43] is said it's a sin of omission you said
[47:46] it's not the big things we leave undone
[47:50] it's the little things and I'll say it
[47:56] like this this is where I've trusted you
[47:58] understand what I'm going to say is that
[48:01] we recognize what God has done in
[48:05] visiting us within this generation and
[48:07] the word that God has given to us but
[48:11] let us always remember that it was not
[48:15] something that would so bring us to a
[48:18] place to where his life then is not
[48:21] reflected down here in this earth that
[48:25] we begin to look over things as though
[48:27] that's not significant but let us look
[48:31] at everything and know that when God has
[48:34] sent his word God has intended that word
[48:38] that it would come and it would bring us
[48:41] out and bring us into our inheritance
[48:44] and that what God has already sown in
[48:47] our life that in his presence that land
[48:51] of adoption it will bring out what he
[48:54] has placed in our life but we must stay
[48:58] fully in the land be in the land first
[49:01] of all and then remain in that land and
[49:04] remaining in that land is to remain in
[49:07] his presence it's very very important
[49:11] and I I say it because we recognize the
[49:13] hour that we're in you know it's and I
[49:15] say it in this regards because you know
[49:18] I wasn't aware of it when I would have
[49:21] only been 2 years old but and there were
[49:23] many who took things and I don't believe
[49:27] that people took things deliberately out
[49:30] of context that the Prophet had
[49:31] mentioned but there are things that the
[49:34] Prophet himself he made a declaration as
[49:37] a private student of the word under
[49:39] inspiration and he spoke concerning 1977
[49:43] that's a whole separate study within
[49:45] itself because there are things that
[49:46] really did begin to terminate and come
[49:49] to an end but yet it's so sometimes the
[49:52] way that that individuals have thought
[49:54] about it and once again
[49:55] don't believe that people intended that
[49:57] to be wrong but you had many I know that
[50:00] some you know that had even come and
[50:03] they said you know I'm gonna retire
[50:04] because I I want to make sure I enjoy my
[50:08] retirement before the coming of the Lord
[50:10] and and so they were taking out you know
[50:12] the accounts and and different things
[50:14] like that and and I'll say it like this
[50:16] that that's something that when we look
[50:19] at it I believe that God he calls us to
[50:23] a place to where we are able to live and
[50:26] walk with God as Enoch walked and yet
[50:30] even in our lives with what he's
[50:32] appointed us to even where he's placed
[50:34] you within your community and your job
[50:38] and all those things like that being
[50:40] sure that where he's placing and then
[50:43] walking with God by allowing his
[50:45] presence in a real personal relationship
[50:47] and keeping that enriched within your
[50:50] life so that it's his influence that his
[50:53] will
[50:54] might be lived and brought forth out of
[50:56] our life and and not to where that we we
[50:59] take one and forget the other and and
[51:01] take one and forget the other but
[51:03] remember all things it's not I get the
[51:06] natural in order first and then I'll go
[51:08] after the spiritual you'll be chasing
[51:09] yourself like a dog trying to find its
[51:12] tail you can't work that way the Bible
[51:15] as the principle seek you first the
[51:18] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[51:20] then all of these other things will be
[51:24] added unto you
[51:25] so it's first being lined up here it's
[51:29] lined up with him and then in the
[51:31] vertical and then the horizontal you'll
[51:33] be lined up that is not permission to
[51:42] call off work
[51:43] [Laughter]
[51:51] verse 14 but when Jesus saw it he was
[51:55] much displeased and said unto them
[51:57] suffer the little children to come unto
[51:59] me and forbid them not in for of such is
[52:04] the kingdom of God
[52:06] verily I say unto you whosoever shall
[52:09] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[52:12] little child he shall not enter therein
[52:15] and he took them up in his arms let me
[52:19] just comment on that a moment in verse
[52:21] 15 the receiving of the kingdom as a
[52:25] little child he shall not enter you know
[52:29] a child is just brought to a place from
[52:33] from early on to believe that what you
[52:36] have said about certain things that
[52:39] you're gonna do it and when they're
[52:43] younger you test them on it you let them
[52:46] know I maybe will make a fire tonight
[52:49] they're gonna be right there to remind
[52:50] you dad you said about a fire tonight
[52:52] dad dad you said about a fire dad what
[52:54] took a marshmallow there to remind you
[53:00] and I believe that these are things that
[53:03] where we sometimes I know things come
[53:05] about in our lives where we're not able
[53:07] to maintain and hold our promises and I
[53:10] ask that that's something I believe that
[53:12] within us that we we have to look at
[53:14] these things and ask God to to help us
[53:19] that we don't over tax ourselves and
[53:25] what your quotient was called many say
[53:27] stretch yourself too thin you get
[53:30] stretched thin you know what happens
[53:32] it's a great snap take a rubber band and
[53:36] you stretch it and it'll snap
[53:42] you love him his presence is so sweet
[53:47] look what he did in verse 16 and he took
[53:51] them up in his arms and they put his
[53:55] arms upon them and blessed them and this
[53:59] is what I want to draw our attention to
[54:01] in verse 13 and they brought young
[54:06] children to him that he should touch
[54:08] them this is what I want to speak on
[54:11] this morning that he should touch them
[54:15] and I think of this when we look at this
[54:18] in the scripture there is a thought here
[54:22] I want to move first to the spiritual
[54:24] and then bring it back then then coming
[54:25] back here but he look how the Lord Jesus
[54:28] he's asked the question here in regards
[54:32] to the right of a man to put away his
[54:37] wife and I want you to know when notice
[54:41] where the Lord Jesus goes - he doesn't
[54:46] start with where they're at and where
[54:49] the entanglements but he goes back to
[54:54] the beginning he's taking them back to
[54:57] the original document of which they're
[54:59] looking at the original document but
[55:00] there's one thing that they're missing
[55:02] when looking at the original document
[55:05] they don't have the love of God and the
[55:09] inspiration of God to know what God is
[55:13] truly saying so he brings them back to
[55:17] the program of God by taking them back
[55:21] before there was sin had even entered
[55:25] and he takes them back there and then
[55:28] bringing them back there to a correct
[55:31] union and what a correct union is is
[55:33] what God Himself has joined together
[55:35] then you find how the scripture then
[55:38] opens to that of where children then
[55:41] come on the scene and children are
[55:44] brought to him that he should touch them
[55:47] and I look at it in this in this regards
[55:51] you and I the way that we were
[55:55] brought forth upon this earth and even
[55:58] where if it was a mom and dad that was
[56:02] filled with the Holy Ghost and serving
[56:05] God it still was by an act of God's
[56:09] permissive will and you're still under
[56:11] that first birth and it must be that you
[56:15] come in contact with the Living God who
[56:19] who knows all about your life and he's
[56:22] the one who can really give you true
[56:25] life and he's the one who indeed is is
[56:30] able to undo the first birth and I
[56:33] believe with all of my heart that when
[56:37] you see every age of the Gentile ages
[56:40] when things had got off-track God would
[56:44] send a message to bring the people back
[56:47] in contact with the Living God so that
[56:51] they themselves might know him as the
[56:54] true atonement and the life giver and
[56:57] source of life himself he who walks in
[57:01] the midst of the seven golden
[57:03] candlesticks and I believe that with all
[57:05] in my heart that God when he sends his
[57:07] messenger and then the ministry under
[57:10] the people under it I believe it's just
[57:12] like Philip when the Greeks came to him
[57:14] and they said where we would see Jesus
[57:17] Philip brought them to him when
[57:20] Nathaniel there was a question that was
[57:23] you know where Nathaniel was under the
[57:26] tree Andrew going to him and what did he
[57:28] say we have found him who was wrote in
[57:32] the scripture you see it wasn't just a
[57:35] movement somewhere but this is according
[57:38] to the word and that's what caused
[57:41] Nathaniel to come and look and as
[57:44] Nathaniel remember his question what
[57:46] good thing can come out of Nazareth and
[57:48] when he comes there here the Lord Jesus
[57:51] standing there and the word already has
[57:55] for knew him the word near now come to
[57:58] life seize everything that has taken
[58:01] place the conversation and he addresses
[58:05] that and what does
[58:06] do for Nathaniel it unveils that this is
[58:10] not just a man but this is the Living
[58:14] God because who else could know the very
[58:17] secrets and intents of the heart
[58:21] see God when he visits a generation it's
[58:25] to bring that generation to the
[58:27] realization that indeed he is the same
[58:31] yesterday today and forever
[58:34] that he is the Living God it's not just
[58:36] a theory it's not just a quotation but
[58:39] indeed he is still the same and he is
[58:43] alive
[58:47] so it's children the children eyes look
[58:52] at that they brought young children to
[58:53] him that he should touch them and we
[58:56] recognize that that it's the children of
[58:58] the promise that are born of the word
[59:01] which is God's own life poured out upon
[59:05] his promised word as much as Moses was a
[59:09] part of that word Moses pouring his life
[59:13] upon that promise could not bring it to
[59:15] life he couldn't manifest it the way
[59:18] that God could manifest it but when God
[59:22] poured his life in the promise and stood
[59:26] there as the promised Word of the hour
[59:29] and then he poured himself into Moses
[59:32] that's the difference that's the
[59:35] difference that's what this is we're
[59:37] five minutes in God's presence it it
[59:41] takes care of years and years and years
[59:46] of trying to figure him out trying to
[59:48] know him so I look at this this this
[59:55] this quote and gods only provided place
[59:59] of worship
[1:00:00] brother brems says now you'll notice
[1:00:03] every three years after a great meeting
[1:00:05] what takes place a denomination this is
[1:00:09] 20 years and no denomination dear dying
[1:00:14] lamb may it never do that
[1:00:18] if I go in this generation may the
[1:00:22] people who believe this message never
[1:00:25] stands still for a denomination the old
[1:00:29] domination is the very fruits of
[1:00:31] bitterness
[1:00:33] you see when even to look at something
[1:00:36] and you know we're the only church our
[1:00:38] pastor is only pastor or were the only
[1:00:40] ones listen friends you have to be
[1:00:42] careful because listen God has an elect
[1:00:45] bride are you with me
[1:00:47] God has an elect bride but there are
[1:00:51] also going to be many outside the city
[1:00:55] that is not part of his bride but has
[1:00:58] received they've received the salvation
[1:01:01] of the Lord
[1:01:01] and God knows who they are His grace
[1:01:05] spills over from the Brum from that of
[1:01:07] the Lamb's Book of Life into the book of
[1:01:10] life and God knows exactly so with with
[1:01:13] within at all it's just simply to keep
[1:01:16] our lives focused on him and I'll say it
[1:01:19] like this it's even to where the Suttons
[1:01:22] of the subtlety of even denomination is
[1:01:24] where even in our thinking to where we
[1:01:26] can even get thinking of just our family
[1:01:29] our families the standard or our
[1:01:31] families there's sex denomination
[1:01:33] because already it's dividing and
[1:01:35] divisive within the body we're not it's
[1:01:38] not many bodies one body it's one body
[1:01:44] is that true so to recognize
[1:01:48] denominations is not just having a name
[1:01:51] that is fitted or common but it's simply
[1:01:55] even being drawn off and in an in
[1:01:58] exclusiveness but no no we are in need
[1:02:02] of God's call medical we're needed in
[1:02:05] need of His grace that doesn't mean that
[1:02:07] we compromise and listen when Paul look
[1:02:10] when Paul stood there and Paul would
[1:02:13] even speak
[1:02:14] false workers deceitful workers and on
[1:02:16] and on that very thing Paul did not want
[1:02:19] to see injury to the body but remember
[1:02:22] it's that the body would go on so it's
[1:02:25] always remembering that our heart is to
[1:02:27] be about the body of Jesus Christ if our
[1:02:31] focus is not about the body of Jesus
[1:02:34] Christ then I wonder are we a part of
[1:02:37] that body because when we're a part of
[1:02:41] that body then all that is a part of it
[1:02:43] it is a focus within that and listen
[1:02:46] it's not just something Universal but it
[1:02:48] manifests itself in every local body the
[1:02:57] very hour that you mentioned
[1:03:00] denomination among you I don't think I
[1:03:04] would I would be Darris them to say I
[1:03:06] don't think anyone was saying that of a
[1:03:09] a church where the message is being
[1:03:13] preached I don't think anyone any one of
[1:03:15] us would say or a denomination I don't I
[1:03:19] don't believe we would say that so
[1:03:21] there's something as he's mentioning
[1:03:23] right here when you mention denomination
[1:03:25] among you so it must be threads or those
[1:03:28] things that would be similar to it my
[1:03:32] prayer and I pray is your heart oh God
[1:03:34] try my heart Lord keep it ever true let
[1:03:40] us have no confidence in the flesh if we
[1:03:44] see something in God has showed you
[1:03:47] something he showed me something
[1:03:48] remember it's God who has showed it and
[1:03:52] if God showed it then before you tell it
[1:03:55] make sure you live it I don't care he
[1:04:02] said how sincere you are and I you I
[1:04:06] think we can agree denominations I don't
[1:04:09] believe there's wrong intentions in all
[1:04:11] of those things we're program and we
[1:04:13] want to see this is preserved and we
[1:04:14] want to keep this I don't believe that
[1:04:15] it's all together that it's wrong
[1:04:17] intentions but you see it's what's
[1:04:20] behind it
[1:04:20] god never entrusted that his church
[1:04:24] would be led by man
[1:04:27] but it would be the holy ghost coming
[1:04:31] through the offices that he has placed
[1:04:34] within the body
[1:04:35] it's him moving through your life so it
[1:04:38] is the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:04:41] working among the body because we're not
[1:04:44] children who are just left to find our
[1:04:47] own way he said the moment you take man
[1:04:52] for your leader instead of the Holy
[1:04:54] Spirit to confirm this word that's the
[1:04:57] hour you die the genuine seed cannot
[1:05:01] because there's nothing left after the
[1:05:03] seed it's the same thing was back at the
[1:05:07] beginning it's the bride that fell into
[1:05:09] the ground to bring forth the corn of
[1:05:11] wheat again in that wonderful the
[1:05:14] genuine seed cannot de nominate the
[1:05:17] genuine seat can there can be
[1:05:19] denominations and thoughts and this is
[1:05:22] amande we believe this and this camp and
[1:05:24] this camping but the genuine seed and if
[1:05:26] there's genuine seed that have come
[1:05:28] under any of that
[1:05:29] remember God Himself will not leave hoof
[1:05:32] behind his promise is to himself until
[1:05:38] we all come in the unity of the faith so
[1:05:45] in looking at that thought of it I
[1:05:47] believe that this is something that when
[1:05:50] we look at this this statement that the
[1:05:52] Prophet makes that we we can see the
[1:05:55] track on down through the scriptures of
[1:05:59] how things can Sol easily become that
[1:06:02] and I I caution that it doesn't become
[1:06:05] something to where that we can look at
[1:06:08] it and say well you know brother Graham
[1:06:10] said this message cannot denominator and
[1:06:12] I agree with it with all of my heart but
[1:06:15] remember the seed cannot de nominate
[1:06:17] there can be denominational thoughts and
[1:06:20] thinking and fragmentation and divisions
[1:06:23] and everything and there has been all of
[1:06:25] that can come so listen that's what I'm
[1:06:26] saying our confidence is not just
[1:06:29] looking at a word under a false pretense
[1:06:31] of what we think it is but to recognize
[1:06:34] we are called to be vigilant within this
[1:06:37] hour as the scripture said that have
[1:06:39] been we have been referring to in Rome
[1:06:41] nine except the Lord of Sabaoth that
[1:06:44] word Sabbath is that of the Lord whereby
[1:06:48] in his hosts his army of people he
[1:06:51] maintains his cause this is a vigilance
[1:06:56] this is why that even Solomon look when
[1:06:59] he would describe the beauty of the
[1:07:01] bride there two different places in the
[1:07:03] Song of Solomon he would also describe
[1:07:05] in her beauty that she's terrible
[1:07:07] awesome and all inspiring as an army
[1:07:11] with banners its comely as tears are so
[1:07:18] it's a part where she's not willing to
[1:07:20] relinquish any rights and what belongs
[1:07:23] to her and I believe that that's what
[1:07:26] God has called and his calling in this
[1:07:28] hour and I believe that's what rises in
[1:07:30] our hearts we're not gonna compromise by
[1:07:34] God's grace with him in arm it's
[1:07:38] motivating us John 1:1 1 first John look
[1:07:47] how John brings this that which was from
[1:07:50] the beginning which we have heard which
[1:07:51] we have seen with our eyes which we have
[1:07:54] looked upon and our hands have handled
[1:07:56] of the word of life for the life was
[1:08:01] manifested and we have seen it look at
[1:08:04] this
[1:08:04] it was manifested what was manifested
[1:08:06] the life and we have seen it and we bear
[1:08:12] witness of it and we show it unto you
[1:08:16] that eternal life so it was manifested
[1:08:19] we have seen it it's been uncovered
[1:08:22] unveiled to us now we are bearing
[1:08:25] witness to that and we are also in the
[1:08:28] bearing witness is showing that same
[1:08:31] life unto you glory be to God which was
[1:08:37] with the father and was manifested unto
[1:08:39] us this is a mystery this is a hidden
[1:08:43] mystery now being made known that which
[1:08:49] we have seen and heard declare we unto
[1:08:52] you
[1:08:53] that you also may have fellowship with
[1:08:56] us and truly our Fellowship is with the
[1:08:59] father and with his son Jesus Christ
[1:09:01] notice what the call is the purpose here
[1:09:05] of what we've seen and what we've heard
[1:09:07] we're declaring it unto you that you
[1:09:09] might have fellowship with us and truly
[1:09:13] our Fellowship is with the father and
[1:09:16] with his son Jesus Christ
[1:09:18] Noora if the desire it's a longing when
[1:09:22] God what God has done in your life in
[1:09:24] your heart don't you want it for
[1:09:27] everybody else you have a longing for
[1:09:31] what God that reality that joy that even
[1:09:35] in the midst of your I'll say a gloomy
[1:09:38] day out here there's still joy down in
[1:09:41] the midst of your soul
[1:09:46] that is something when there's a
[1:09:48] stability it's a life source it's a it's
[1:09:51] a faith that where you can look and say
[1:09:53] I don't know how all of this is going to
[1:09:56] come out I don't know how God is going
[1:09:58] to work this out but I know that God's
[1:10:00] in control and Lord as you're in control
[1:10:04] I'm asking you to take me under control
[1:10:08] I submit my mind that submit my thoughts
[1:10:11] I submit my emotion that submit
[1:10:14] everything Lord that your will might be
[1:10:17] performed
[1:10:30] you see it's like when you have whether
[1:10:36] your garden or your flowers or whatever
[1:10:38] you have you you are your confidence is
[1:10:43] in what you have planted that it will
[1:10:45] come forth and produce but you cannot
[1:10:51] just leave that garden go
[1:10:53] you can't just let the flowers go you
[1:10:57] know even if you have mulch down weeds
[1:11:01] will come up if you're so often you have
[1:11:05] to cultivate and loosen around it you
[1:11:08] see it's not something that once it's
[1:11:09] been planted it goes on autopilot but
[1:11:15] there is a care the Bible says in the
[1:11:17] book of Genesis God planted a garden
[1:11:20] eastward in Eden and there he placed the
[1:11:24] man whom he had formed that he would
[1:11:26] dress it and keep it God planted it by
[1:11:32] his word so he's turning it over to Adam
[1:11:35] but remember how his Adam to keep this
[1:11:37] garden
[1:11:39] by his word so gods were now working
[1:11:44] through human instrumentality even
[1:11:46] though he hasn't fallen but notice God
[1:11:49] in trust God takes his work God's not
[1:11:52] God's not in fear God takes his word and
[1:11:56] he entrust that word that's the same
[1:11:58] that he's done in every generation
[1:11:59] that's the same thing that he has done
[1:12:02] in this hour God entrust his word
[1:12:05] remembers the Prophet said he just
[1:12:07] doesn't give it to flirter
[1:12:09] he speaks it to his beloved I look at
[1:12:17] this I look at this Todd was just so
[1:12:19] pressing that he should touch them I
[1:12:21] thought of a place or brother branham
[1:12:26] mentions in the message of how that God
[1:12:30] hides behind skin bilham says it like
[1:12:37] this and I want you to just to take this
[1:12:38] even though a familiar story maybe two
[1:12:43] perhaps to most of you but bream says it
[1:12:47] like this and I've not put it there
[1:12:49] because I just want to just phrase
[1:12:51] things he says there's there's a home a
[1:12:55] Christian home this is very important
[1:12:58] it's a Christian home
[1:13:04] a Christian home remember they were
[1:13:06] first called Christians illegals Antioch
[1:13:11] the first called Christians and the
[1:13:13] Christians I believe it was cristianos
[1:13:16] ano sir there are to be christ-like see
[1:13:21] they didn't give themselves that name
[1:13:24] the Methodists did not give themselves
[1:13:27] that name
[1:13:28] it was those outside that gave them that
[1:13:32] name it's because they didn't understand
[1:13:35] what God was doing then you had others
[1:13:39] that didn't pick that up and that was
[1:13:41] the name they were carrying the name
[1:13:42] without carrying carrying what was
[1:13:44] really a life of what God had done and
[1:13:47] moved on but there was a home a
[1:13:48] Christian home and you remember brother
[1:13:50] Brent says there was a big storm you
[1:13:52] know that came up and he said you know
[1:13:55] lightning was flashing it's getting late
[1:13:57] in the night and the mother said to
[1:13:59] Junior junior you go upstairs and go to
[1:14:03] bed don't be scared go on up there every
[1:14:09] time when I read this on here brother
[1:14:10] bran tell I remember see most of my life
[1:14:13] I was raised in big country farmhouses
[1:14:17] that's why to this day I still have
[1:14:19] problems with just wood floor just
[1:14:20] that's all we had and that's all I
[1:14:22] remember getting out on cold floors
[1:14:24] things like that I'm not against it
[1:14:27] that's no pivotal place see honey no no
[1:14:30] that's this is best brother Samuel this
[1:14:33] isn't doctrine is my opinion but I
[1:14:38] remember that it seemed like I was a
[1:14:39] long way away from mom and dad you know
[1:14:42] so little junior Oh with his pants on
[1:14:47] you know his pajamas he goes up the
[1:14:48] steps and he's looking back he's half
[1:14:50] crying brother Brent talks about it and
[1:14:51] he says he even called out to his momma
[1:14:54] he said mama come up here with me
[1:14:56] oh she said junior nothing is going to
[1:15:01] bother you that lightning can't hurt you
[1:15:03] you know what she's doing she's giving
[1:15:06] him true word it's true Christian whole
[1:15:10] she is looking at the situation and
[1:15:14] she's giving him a true word that hey
[1:15:17] that
[1:15:17] and he's not gonna hurt you she said
[1:15:23] junior my little son mother wants to
[1:15:26] tell you something now watch this she
[1:15:27] says we're a Christian family we believe
[1:15:29] in God we believe that God protects us
[1:15:31] in storms we believe that we believe
[1:15:33] that God takes care of his own I want
[1:15:35] you to believe that Junior that don't be
[1:15:38] scared God is with us he'll protect us
[1:15:43] Junior snubbed a few times
[1:15:45] mama I believe that too
[1:15:48] but when that lightning is so close to
[1:15:51] the window I like to feel the God that's
[1:15:55] got skin on it it wasn't that he was
[1:16:00] arguing that she was not speaking the
[1:16:02] truth but what he needed to calm him in
[1:16:06] the storm that was present he needed a
[1:16:10] God with skin on it he needed someone
[1:16:14] that had faith in that word and who knew
[1:16:17] that word and had proved that word and
[1:16:20] that word was sure he needed God with
[1:16:23] skin on it let me tell you something in
[1:16:26] this generation we need a God with skin
[1:16:30] on it and right now we need God with
[1:16:32] skin on him with same living God not
[1:16:37] just words we need that same word that
[1:16:40] has been delivered God delivered it
[1:16:43] through his messenger God come down in
[1:16:46] this hour in a veil of flesh and God
[1:16:49] took upon anointed that messenger with
[1:16:53] his spirit and there he spoke that word
[1:16:56] and that word has been vindicated by the
[1:16:59] very presence of Almighty God God was
[1:17:03] skin on it and that was a call to you
[1:17:06] and I what God did there in that
[1:17:11] messenger is what God wants to do in
[1:17:16] every life God with skin on it if it's
[1:17:21] not God with skin on it in your life
[1:17:28] then very easily it can be things we
[1:17:30] believe this is true I believe that's
[1:17:33] true you've got to have him who's the
[1:17:36] standard because the standard even if
[1:17:40] you get off in your thoughts you get
[1:17:42] denomination on your thoughts the
[1:17:44] standard is there and you can be
[1:17:49] corrected you can be brought back in
[1:17:52] line because the desire of your heart
[1:17:54] the desire of our heart is to please him
[1:17:57] that's what's important clear his spirit
[1:18:04] coming down God was skin on it and I I
[1:18:08] look at this and I think of Exodus 12
[1:18:13] with the family and that's really what
[1:18:18] I'm honing in here today he's on the
[1:18:22] family and the family application you
[1:18:26] know brother branham he takes it will
[1:18:30] send a message the token and he speaks
[1:18:35] of a time in the opening or at least of
[1:18:39] what i've quoted here he takes us back
[1:18:41] to a moment of where Jacob had met God
[1:18:45] had been changed by God but then Jacob
[1:18:49] had kind of taken his own course and it
[1:18:51] brought some trouble in his family and
[1:18:54] when it came back God spoke to him and
[1:18:56] said in Genesis 35 I want you to come
[1:18:59] back to Bethel where I met you and I
[1:19:03] relieved you in the hour of your
[1:19:06] distress he come back to where you've
[1:19:10] drifted from and that's a whole separate
[1:19:12] thought to minister on but I look at how
[1:19:14] that when the Prophet is speaking this
[1:19:17] it is a call when he's giving this out
[1:19:20] like Jacob did he said told his wife and
[1:19:22] all of them wash her clothes and
[1:19:24] everything and put away them gods it's a
[1:19:26] call back to her God met and became one
[1:19:32] with his creation after day of Pentecost
[1:19:35] it's the call back to that same living
[1:19:38] God
[1:19:39] in the same living expression because
[1:19:42] after that took place then we see how
[1:19:44] things drifted and things got off but
[1:19:46] God calls us to this place and he goes
[1:19:51] on talk about how that Joshua he said
[1:19:54] you know how even how Joshua approached
[1:19:56] it there in the beginning of Joshua
[1:19:58] before crossing over wash your clothes
[1:20:00] come not at your wives and so forth
[1:20:02] getting ready for within three days
[1:20:03] we'll cross Jordan he was getting ready
[1:20:05] was applying the token he was applying
[1:20:11] the token the word even in preparation
[1:20:15] so the applying of it is also it's that
[1:20:19] which goes into the preparation he says
[1:20:22] get ready apply it believe it clean up
[1:20:27] let your children let your family let
[1:20:31] your loved ones see it in you it'll take
[1:20:35] an effect I say Amen let them see it in
[1:20:43] you and it will take an effect so what
[1:20:46] they see is not you but Christ and it's
[1:20:52] Christ in you that takes an effect
[1:20:55] because remember don't allow the enemy
[1:21:00] to stretch you to where you are looking
[1:21:04] at trying to bring transformation
[1:21:06] through natural measures now there's
[1:21:09] just let me just deal on this just a
[1:21:10] moment there are standards of the word
[1:21:12] that we are accountable for from when
[1:21:15] they're coming from early on they are
[1:21:18] not to be left to self-discovery are you
[1:21:23] with me
[1:21:25] with Samuel they've got to have their
[1:21:28] own experience nobody in here disagrees
[1:21:30] with that but I also remind you that we
[1:21:34] are to be their Holy Ghost until they
[1:21:38] get old enough to receive it there's a
[1:21:43] challenge to all of our hearts it's an
[1:21:47] to take and take an effect upon our
[1:21:50] lives
[1:21:51] it's have an effect and I want you to
[1:21:55] watch this what job program says this he
[1:21:59] says then apply the token in prayer let
[1:22:02] me come back to that I understood forgot
[1:22:03] that he brought it back to my attention
[1:22:05] you don't try to handle things even you
[1:22:09] look at your things in your marriage
[1:22:11] here you are husband and wife you look I
[1:22:12] said well this is natural but remember
[1:22:14] if we believe God's Word and know that's
[1:22:16] a spiritual union that had to take place
[1:22:18] first then we've got to rely upon the
[1:22:21] supernatural God to give us leadership
[1:22:25] not while I've been married now I know
[1:22:28] it all I've got everything I've got
[1:22:29] everything put together I've got the
[1:22:31] scriptures I've got the quotes but we
[1:22:33] need God
[1:22:35] we need the supernatural God that he
[1:22:39] would lead us remember he gave Adam to
[1:22:41] dress it and keep it but he did not
[1:22:43] remove Adam from the supernatural part
[1:22:48] and the supernatural does not mean that
[1:22:54] the natural says I have nothing to do
[1:22:56] with it this is all supernatural I'll
[1:23:00] just kick back and relax it'll all
[1:23:02] happen on its own it won't there's
[1:23:07] things that we have to do very simple
[1:23:09] brother Bram says if you don't tell your
[1:23:11] wife that she's the best cook in the
[1:23:12] country if you don't tell her you know
[1:23:15] he goes on to those things he said then
[1:23:17] who is
[1:23:26] hoo-wee
[1:23:28] we're just getting started I'm a time I
[1:23:32] just started for today I'm just saying
[1:23:33] we're just getting started
[1:23:40] then apply the token in prayer you know
[1:23:48] the quicker that we can recognize and
[1:23:50] I'm not just saying well know something
[1:23:54] we need to be born again III think
[1:23:55] that's something that you should realize
[1:23:57] that puts you in contact with the Living
[1:24:00] God but it doesn't remove and say well
[1:24:03] you're not going to have any problems
[1:24:04] you're not gonna have any issues you're
[1:24:06] not gonna have any that's that's not
[1:24:08] according to the Word of God as a matter
[1:24:10] of fact when you've been born again then
[1:24:12] you have been equipped with divine
[1:24:13] authority where the word now is seeded
[1:24:16] in power and authority in your life and
[1:24:20] Paul had to look look how much time that
[1:24:23] Paul took under the leadership of the
[1:24:25] Lord in the book of Ephesians he turned
[1:24:27] in Galatians he brought it in
[1:24:29] Corinthians he brought it you said oh
[1:24:30] that was just for them remember that's
[1:24:32] pride they Paul lend her the leadership
[1:24:35] of the Lord salt they had a need I I
[1:24:38] don't want to look at myself and I'll
[1:24:40] just tell you they're straight out I
[1:24:41] don't have it all together but he does
[1:24:44] he does he's the image that I want to
[1:24:49] see and I want to I want to be reflected
[1:24:52] and he's the image I want to set before
[1:24:53] you I don't want my thoughts or my ideas
[1:24:56] set before you I want him
[1:24:59] because when it's him then he cultivates
[1:25:02] himself from your life they called how
[1:25:06] God has made me the way that I look the
[1:25:09] way that I think about things God has
[1:25:10] made me that way and God has made you
[1:25:14] another way but the one things that's
[1:25:16] the same he is Christ is the same nature
[1:25:19] within us and he is manifesting his
[1:25:23] victory through all of our weaknesses
[1:25:25] and even our strengths because our
[1:25:29] strengths can be our biggest hindrance
[1:25:31] when it's not yielded to history my then
[1:25:37] apply the token in prayer with
[1:25:41] consideration with believing so here is
[1:25:43] prayer
[1:25:44] you see when there's situations that
[1:25:46] arise things take place I know I'm
[1:25:49] talking right down where we're living
[1:25:50] there's things that have that arise and
[1:25:53] there's things that you can look at I
[1:25:54] can look at and you know as far as in
[1:25:57] our natural strengths you or frustrate
[1:26:00] yourself trying to make it happen
[1:26:03] trying to make it turn around but I want
[1:26:05] you to look at this right here by prayer
[1:26:07] it brings you in contact with God and
[1:26:12] you stay in contact with God and you're
[1:26:15] looking to God to say Lord my eyes my
[1:26:19] senses every part of me may look and say
[1:26:22] I don't see how this can be but Lord
[1:26:25] this is your word this is what you have
[1:26:29] laid out and and I know you to be the
[1:26:32] same yesterday today forever it might be
[1:26:35] an old promise but Lord you kept the
[1:26:37] promise to me of the Father you revealed
[1:26:41] yourself to me you cleaned up my life
[1:26:44] you filled me with the Holy Ghost you
[1:26:46] kept your promise
[1:26:47] and that's where I stand before you not
[1:26:50] as a worthy mortal but as a son and
[1:26:53] daughter of God clothed in the blood of
[1:26:56] Jesus Christ called by the voice of that
[1:26:59] blood I stand before you Lord on the
[1:27:02] authority of your word Lord if it's
[1:27:08] something in me that needs to be
[1:27:10] arranged in order for what I'm desiring
[1:27:14] to happen then arrange it in me you see
[1:27:19] sometimes we're so focused on trying to
[1:27:22] arrange others and it's not so much that
[1:27:24] others are the problem that's saying
[1:27:26] there are problems but remember it's
[1:27:28] even the arrangement and everything must
[1:27:31] come in here to actually be in here to
[1:27:34] believe that God is able because if not
[1:27:39] if it's not arranged in here it's you're
[1:27:41] reaching out with the natural measures
[1:27:48] then apply it with prayer or in prayer
[1:27:51] with consideration with believing apply
[1:27:57] it with such love and so forth till you
[1:28:00] know it's going to take place it's going
[1:28:03] to take place I mean just I mean just
[1:28:07] dealing this just a moment I'm just
[1:28:08] going to touch this just a moment this
[1:28:09] morning
[1:28:10] when we look at this thought
[1:28:12] consideration I want to make sure that
[1:28:17] I'm as clear as clear can be when we're
[1:28:22] looking at consideration it's taking
[1:28:25] into account what is really needed
[1:28:32] example with Paul was Benjamin even in
[1:28:37] Zachary but more or less now with Paul
[1:28:39] and Benjamin there's certain things has
[1:28:41] changed there's certain I'm not picking
[1:28:43] on them and I hope I'm not embarrassing
[1:28:44] them if I am will maybe ice cream later
[1:28:53] that sound like that was for me
[1:29:01] but there are things that is much
[1:29:03] different with them now than when they
[1:29:06] were little when they were when they
[1:29:12] were little the time of discipline was
[1:29:16] quick even if even with me you know
[1:29:19] going and laying things out and telling
[1:29:22] them my heart this is why and this is
[1:29:24] holding their hand you know what
[1:29:25] sometimes me crying with him it was me
[1:29:28] expressing my heart because the way that
[1:29:31] I look at this let me tell you friends
[1:29:34] there's a statement that the Prophet
[1:29:36] made before I was ever married and it
[1:29:38] resonated within my heart I even
[1:29:39] preached it before him but it came to me
[1:29:41] within that of the natural and he says
[1:29:43] how that God disciplines us as his
[1:29:47] children he disciplines us with a vision
[1:29:50] in mind church age book he disciplines
[1:29:55] us with a vision to know that if this
[1:29:56] isn't corrected here where it'll be
[1:29:59] later on if they're allowed to stand in
[1:30:02] the floor now and twirl around what will
[1:30:05] it be when they get married you're with
[1:30:12] me
[1:30:13] Donner I don't expect you to scream and
[1:30:16] shun that but I want CDI we want we did
[1:30:20] just to get be sown it's it's looking at
[1:30:25] see what you see now it's an entrusting
[1:30:28] with a molding and a developing of that
[1:30:30] and let me just try to end this part
[1:30:32] here this morning within that that
[1:30:34] aspect of it that I'm not going to
[1:30:36] approach them as a young child as I
[1:30:38] would him as an 18 year old boy in other
[1:30:41] words me and your buddies buddy we're
[1:30:44] buddies and you know or you know I don't
[1:30:47] have any daughters but you know we're
[1:30:49] buddies and buddies don't remember
[1:30:51] brother Ben talked about a buddy when he
[1:30:53] talked about sister Rebekah 18 years old
[1:30:55] he weren't in a compromise her brother
[1:30:58] branham was not a like this this was
[1:31:01] that's not how are you pry applied that
[1:31:03] I'm not going to get into that this
[1:31:04] morning brother Ben didn't approach it
[1:31:06] that way friends let me tell you
[1:31:07] something God brought us a message in
[1:31:10] this generation that covers the basis I
[1:31:14] believe that was all my heart
[1:31:16] that's how I live that that's how I
[1:31:18] apply that I can't help it when I go
[1:31:20] there situations I come in - alright you
[1:31:23] know what you might call me a nut or
[1:31:24] whatever more I can hear his voice come
[1:31:26] forth I'll hear it I'm a nun remember
[1:31:28] exactly the message so many times I
[1:31:29] maybe can other times I can but you know
[1:31:31] it is it's something that one my prayer
[1:31:33] has always been God right there so deep
[1:31:36] on my heart Lord that is principle in my
[1:31:40] life principle in my life I don't want
[1:31:46] to forget things we're not now go out of
[1:31:47] service so write it in me just not left
[1:31:50] to this up here where it's tell me here
[1:31:56] so if we if we're not careful we're
[1:32:00] looking at things and we are treating
[1:32:03] five-year-olds like 18 year olds you see
[1:32:08] where this brings us back into the place
[1:32:10] to where we need God's leadership into
[1:32:15] the discipline book
[1:32:18] you as me God God's done the same thing
[1:32:22] what I'm speaking to you God this must
[1:32:24] be a pattern in the scripture if it's
[1:32:26] not in the scripture then or not not be
[1:32:27] spoken but God has dealt with every age
[1:32:30] according to where they were at
[1:32:33] God will even deal Nate listen I've been
[1:32:36] in times where even when you look at
[1:32:39] remember that on the the minister
[1:32:41] remember he kept on preaching repentance
[1:32:42] in the window stop preaching repentance
[1:32:44] he said when everybody repents that's
[1:32:50] the inspiration God's given sometimes
[1:32:52] you look at and say how long is brother
[1:32:54] Sam you're gonna labor on this let me
[1:32:56] change something it is in laboring
[1:32:57] because I'm just like wow I really
[1:32:59] enjoyed this thought there's times of
[1:33:00] thoughts that I was just waiting to keep
[1:33:03] moving on and God just picks me up and
[1:33:04] pulls me on a hole or Lord ha there's so
[1:33:07] much it's pew you may know right there
[1:33:08] but it's for a time there we'll get back
[1:33:10] to it if he tarries but how many times
[1:33:15] in myself when I went in just just me
[1:33:18] little me I've gone into a meeting and I
[1:33:20] thought I thought I knew you know it was
[1:33:21] a comfort to me I found I knew I was
[1:33:23] going to preach so I said I can actually
[1:33:25] eat when I got there I could actually
[1:33:26] eat a meal with them and then the next
[1:33:29] morning you wake up and in prayer and
[1:33:31] all of a sudden here it is moments
[1:33:32] before I'm ready to step out the hotel
[1:33:34] and all of a sudden hear this thought
[1:33:35] it's inspired in prayer and I have
[1:33:37] nothing this have to jot down a few
[1:33:40] things but you know what it is it's God
[1:33:42] knows the needs of his people that is
[1:33:48] such a rest he knows what we have need
[1:33:52] of when we have need of it it might be
[1:33:55] something that we would look and say
[1:33:57] well that's simple that's something over
[1:33:59] I've already covered back there but
[1:34:00] remember what Peter said under the
[1:34:02] leadership of the Lord I find it well
[1:34:04] I'm still here in this Tabernacle to
[1:34:06] stir up your your remembrance your pure
[1:34:10] mind by way of remembrance what was he
[1:34:13] calling them back to virtues of that
[1:34:16] life that is to be expressed and come to
[1:34:19] maturity in our lives and the word
[1:34:24] brings us to that you say Amen
[1:34:31] sorts of consideration a plant was such
[1:34:36] love and so forth till you know it's
[1:34:38] going to take place it's going to take
[1:34:40] place that's a very key important point
[1:34:42] with love apply it in confidence you
[1:34:49] know faith works by love faith works by
[1:34:55] love love is the results or faith faith
[1:35:02] is the results of love your love it
[1:35:07] comes faith is that right so it's love
[1:35:11] being projected and love itself because
[1:35:15] I heard the brother brems said the other
[1:35:16] day he says go to the drugstore and buy
[1:35:18] me a quarter of it you can't explain it
[1:35:22] you can try a man was in the insane
[1:35:26] institution there writing about the love
[1:35:28] of God if you can't you can't bring it
[1:35:31] down to where it's just something
[1:35:33] explainable it's just something that you
[1:35:35] know that resonates from the very depths
[1:35:39] of your soul apply that confidence
[1:35:45] believing it's going to help when you
[1:35:50] talk to that child when you talk to your
[1:35:54] husband talk to your wife talk to this
[1:36:00] loved one believe that it's going to
[1:36:03] help so look look what's being shota
[1:36:05] don't know miss this faith in the word
[1:36:10] releases the atmosphere of his presence
[1:36:15] and remember if a heart condemn us we
[1:36:21] cannot have confidence so if there's
[1:36:24] anything in you that condemns or just
[1:36:28] give that right
[1:36:30] so that faith itself can be a master of
[1:36:34] every circumstance so that love itself
[1:36:39] can have you might listen you might be
[1:36:42] walking forward with truth but remember
[1:36:45] it's not just truth it must be God with
[1:36:49] skin on it so so the approach in it is
[1:36:56] our lives in individually being
[1:36:59] evaluated under God's presence when we
[1:37:02] are laying ourselves before God and the
[1:37:05] Lord's Prayer is not just a prayer but
[1:37:08] it is indeed the heart's cry thy will be
[1:37:10] done in earth as it is in heaven give me
[1:37:17] this day my daily bread and Lord lead me
[1:37:22] not into temptation but deliver me from
[1:37:25] evil for thine is the kingdom and the
[1:37:28] power and the glory amen
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] notice he said so so here when you're
[1:37:35] speaking there's an atmosphere of the
[1:37:37] word and I'll say like this if you're
[1:37:42] not in the right tenor if you're not in
[1:37:44] the right place and all of us have
[1:37:46] failed
[1:37:47] and it isn't that all of a sudden you
[1:37:50] come to place behind off no longer fail
[1:37:52] but it's recognizing if you're not in
[1:37:54] the right humor at that moment be angry
[1:37:58] and sin not you didn't say you were
[1:38:02] gonna get angry it should be angry and
[1:38:03] sin that right
[1:38:06] so when you've not in the right tenor of
[1:38:08] something or the right humor of
[1:38:10] something it's best to say the Lord
[1:38:13] change me I'm all you know if they check
[1:38:20] your blood pressure at that time of you
[1:38:24] you know you weak and I was like oh I
[1:38:28] need some chocolate to pick me up er oh
[1:38:29] it's a weekend so like my energy is gone
[1:38:33] see listen friends we talked about we'll
[1:38:36] try every spirit one of the things that
[1:38:39] you can recognize even as the Prophet
[1:38:40] said your body was not made to lie when
[1:38:44] something is brought to you you can try
[1:38:46] it not just by the words look at what
[1:38:49] it's leading to and look at what it's
[1:38:51] doing in you Alleluia
[1:38:56] that's the truth here's he says just
[1:39:02] stand there and say Lord I've claimed
[1:39:05] them they're mine I'm getting them for
[1:39:09] you Lord oh well we could just preach it
[1:39:12] on this right here I'm getting them for
[1:39:14] you what is it what is it I might be mom
[1:39:17] and their mom or their dad or whatever
[1:39:19] however however it is as far as with you
[1:39:21] the mother you're the dad you hear you
[1:39:23] are you standing I'm getting them for
[1:39:24] you this isn't about me Lord
[1:39:26] it's about your kingdom seek you first
[1:39:30] the kingdom of God you you want to see
[1:39:32] their soul saved you want to see them
[1:39:34] turned around you want to see their life
[1:39:36] on fire with God then remember you must
[1:39:39] keep the order of overcoming that's God
[1:39:42] first God first family second you last
[1:39:48] and you can actually put family before
[1:39:52] God and when you've done that you put
[1:39:54] yourself before God but remember it's
[1:39:59] him first him first
[1:40:04] that's the order of overcoming and I
[1:40:07] believe that every one of us we want to
[1:40:10] have our lives like conduits that invite
[1:40:13] the supernatural that invite God to come
[1:40:17] down and to speak to us because we don't
[1:40:21] know situations that we might be faced
[1:40:24] with or called upon and we're living
[1:40:27] within this hour but our focus and our
[1:40:31] courage and our strength is to come from
[1:40:34] God apply it for us so we're saying in
[1:40:40] our heart Lord I'm doing this for you
[1:40:43] I'm doing this for you Lord this is
[1:40:46] about see and you know what that is when
[1:40:48] it's about him eternal life is living
[1:40:52] for others see that creates an
[1:40:55] atmosphere oh my I just love this he
[1:41:00] says apply it and create that atmosphere
[1:41:03] around you that they'll just drop right
[1:41:06] into it we are how much your creators we
[1:41:12] can create some atmospheres
[1:41:15] it depends on what kind of atmosphere
[1:41:18] you want to create I'm not gonna ask us
[1:41:22] your hands because we're all we've all
[1:41:23] been in that place of where that an
[1:41:26] atmosphere and something that all we
[1:41:28] just had to say this or that or I'm not
[1:41:33] the only one I'm preaching to all and
[1:41:36] the atmosphere you've got to work to get
[1:41:39] that atmosphere back
[1:41:44] and getting the atmosphere back you know
[1:41:47] it takes more than just the words I'm
[1:41:49] sorry
[1:41:50] it takes God with skin on it to create
[1:41:56] that atmosphere again hallelujah and and
[1:42:02] you're called for it
[1:42:03] I said you're called for it you're
[1:42:06] anointed for this if you are born of the
[1:42:09] Spirit of God you're anointed for this
[1:42:13] you might come to red sea sometimes and
[1:42:16] you think what's going on and the Lord
[1:42:19] speaks back to you and says why cry unto
[1:42:22] me speed and go forward for I who
[1:42:30] commissioned you there you have forgot
[1:42:33] your commission but your commission is I
[1:42:36] am with thee Oh glory be to God see this
[1:42:48] is where the Prophet brings us to this
[1:42:50] place on the rich young ruler in the
[1:42:53] message come follow me it's also titled
[1:42:56] leadership shorter version where the RAM
[1:42:58] speaks it to graduates there in Arizona
[1:43:00] libram the cautions even those who are
[1:43:04] the graduates of brother brems says that
[1:43:06] our message does not become just
[1:43:08] theology remember in trying to do God a
[1:43:12] service Jeffersonville
[1:43:14] and also in Shreveport he reads a
[1:43:17] portion out of Deuteronomy and charging
[1:43:20] us charging those who believe this
[1:43:27] message it's a great charge that he
[1:43:31] takes the time to read this and and this
[1:43:34] is what I would say that within this let
[1:43:41] me just I have to I I don't want to skip
[1:43:44] these things and just leave some of this
[1:43:45] to them so until next week or something
[1:43:47] listen friends
[1:43:51] theology is not just is not just well
[1:43:56] I'm not gonna teach them the truths of
[1:43:58] this message I'm not going to lay these
[1:44:00] things out before them you know God's
[1:44:02] got ministry that's true God does got
[1:44:04] ministry but God has entrusted you in
[1:44:08] your home don't neglect your duty
[1:44:15] it's just like this can you imagine can
[1:44:17] you imagine a platoon that would neglect
[1:44:20] their duty and then they're coming to
[1:44:22] merge with the rest of the army and here
[1:44:26] they are one's got their legs up here
[1:44:28] and one's got you know as he's walking
[1:44:30] along he's got his gun on this side and
[1:44:31] the rest got their guns on this side the
[1:44:33] one's got his hat over here and they got
[1:44:35] all sorts of things they're not even
[1:44:36] dressed right I'll tell you what that's
[1:44:40] sergeant the generals gonna have him
[1:44:45] well I'm glad God had a seventh angel
[1:44:51] messenger and he he the chief general
[1:44:57] came on the scene that mighty angel and
[1:45:02] he spoke and gave direction to our life
[1:45:05] that as we can live under his influence
[1:45:09] than he can prepare us for all that we
[1:45:13] have need of we have not been left to
[1:45:17] our own devices huge focus word is here
[1:45:22] to confirm that word and bring it to
[1:45:24] pass so I say it in this in this regards
[1:45:26] here then it's not something that we
[1:45:29] look at and just say well they'll figure
[1:45:30] it out on their own this is something
[1:45:33] friends that I believe that our children
[1:45:36] need to know what we believe and why we
[1:45:39] believe it it's not just because the
[1:45:42] church teaches it or we believe it it's
[1:45:45] why do we believe this it's not just
[1:45:48] something we quote from the word but
[1:45:51] it's this is what God's desire is for a
[1:45:54] life we're called to be a separated
[1:45:56] people we're not to look
[1:45:59] like the world smell like the world sake
[1:46:02] like the world you can call out of Egypt
[1:46:08] don't take them back to bondage honey
[1:46:12] because the rapture is too close it's a
[1:46:18] bonus well you know brother Simon I
[1:46:26] don't know so much are you trying to
[1:46:28] make an excuse I'm asking you mom I'm
[1:46:33] asking you daddy where's your life at
[1:46:36] remember it's God with skin on it well
[1:46:45] we'll send them too well bring him to
[1:46:47] church will setting up to Sunday school
[1:46:48] it ought to be school at your heart it
[1:46:53] ought not be that they're up there
[1:46:54] teaching them things that they hear for
[1:46:55] the first time I love you but I'm here
[1:46:58] to preach this word words here I'm here
[1:47:03] to burn it burns within my heart to see
[1:47:05] that this message it does not become a
[1:47:08] denomination it doesn't become away a
[1:47:10] lifestyle of something that we're just
[1:47:13] saying oh yeah we we go to church and
[1:47:15] yeah you know yeah we we we well you
[1:47:18] know we we yeah we believe a prophet and
[1:47:20] you know God centered but no it's it's
[1:47:22] something and you say well you can't
[1:47:24] make that happen in in people's hearts I
[1:47:26] know I can't but I know that God can do
[1:47:29] it and God will do it and has done it
[1:47:31] and he's doing it with every heart that
[1:47:34] he himself can touch and as identified
[1:47:37] that's one of his children my heart's
[1:47:40] desire is to bring you to him that he
[1:47:43] might touch you because when he touches
[1:47:46] you there's a strength there's a
[1:47:49] stability there's your anchor well I'll
[1:47:55] send them to you smeeting youth meeting
[1:47:57] doesn't replace that that's not even my
[1:47:59] vision within a youth meeting my vision
[1:48:01] and the youth meaning is not to train up
[1:48:03] where things have been lacked I'm just
[1:48:06] pressing my heart absolutely not
[1:48:10] that doesn't mean that we're gonna have
[1:48:12] a quiz you know coming up but I you know
[1:48:14] I look at just the simplicity of things
[1:48:16] you know and you know pardon me sister
[1:48:19] Carmen just to use the example I heard
[1:48:21] the testimony back there I didn't know
[1:48:22] the second part but I had asked you to
[1:48:24] give the first part to my but I looked
[1:48:27] at that back there and my heart just was
[1:48:28] just pulsating within my heart but see
[1:48:31] the simplicity of it you didn't have to
[1:48:33] go through no down I know it was sister
[1:48:36] Carmen she's went through that with with
[1:48:38] her children I believe that with Peter
[1:48:40] but you understand here it was it's not
[1:48:43] just leaving it as a story but it brings
[1:48:47] it to a reality we are like Peter
[1:48:50] there's a need that has a rose and we're
[1:48:53] going to come up empty but let's cast on
[1:48:55] the other side of the boat because God
[1:48:57] has made this promise to us and it
[1:48:59] brought them together where they could
[1:49:01] pray pray for it what's it doing it's an
[1:49:06] instruction it's a training just using
[1:49:11] that example because it's pressing here
[1:49:13] before us you see friends that's the
[1:49:15] same way with that that black sister
[1:49:17] down there in Memphis she didn't just
[1:49:19] read the Bible as Bible it was just
[1:49:22] theology see herself there was a need in
[1:49:25] her life
[1:49:26] and it was revealed to her there's a
[1:49:28] need and she said Lord eyes that
[1:49:30] Shunammite woman where is your Elisha
[1:49:35] she knew he's still God she found her
[1:49:39] place in the way in the scriptures for
[1:49:42] the need in that moment her boy was in
[1:49:46] need her boy needed God wished in on it
[1:49:50] and what was the story of a oh my
[1:49:54] woman it became God with skin on it
[1:49:59] somebody having faith that God is still
[1:50:02] the same God that could ground the plane
[1:50:05] that that Memphis Airport and to where
[1:50:09] here she is out there on the fence
[1:50:11] she just didn't get out there five
[1:50:14] minutes before he got there she had been
[1:50:16] there all night the dew was on her back
[1:50:19] I love those
[1:50:23] she was waiting for God to fulfill that
[1:50:27] promise I believe that was all my heart
[1:50:31] it's bringing Christ present you can
[1:50:40] have all the right things but where's
[1:50:44] your passion do your children does your
[1:50:49] husband does your wife do they know your
[1:50:52] passion for the Lord do you have a
[1:50:56] passion for God I trust this is striking
[1:51:04] our hearts listen friends I don't just
[1:51:07] preach things it's reflective I want to
[1:51:09] bring it here the moment that I stop
[1:51:11] reflecting the moment but I read in the
[1:51:13] where I'm listening to the message and I
[1:51:15] stop reflecting that's the moment I'm
[1:51:17] back slid because you understand his
[1:51:21] presence the Holy Spirit the Prophet are
[1:51:24] just looking at this week as this
[1:51:26] presence comes his presence is so
[1:51:28] necessary the Holy Spirit coming through
[1:51:30] that word to shake us that our roots
[1:51:33] would go deeper it's necessary it's the
[1:51:38] teaching of the value is his presence
[1:51:40] it's his life it's God with skin on it
[1:51:44] there where you and I we can say like
[1:51:47] Paul said follow me as I follow Christ
[1:51:54] think of this inspiration of the remnant
[1:51:57] can I have a few more moments
[1:52:03] remember the inspiration of the remnant
[1:52:05] that came back from Babylon
[1:52:13] the temple is what is reared up first
[1:52:19] God has a as retur come at the right
[1:52:24] time then after the temple notice the
[1:52:27] order is the temple first the place of
[1:52:31] worship and as the temple was raised
[1:52:35] then God has Nehemiah come and Nehemiah
[1:52:40] is burdened about the walls of Jerusalem
[1:52:44] and Nehemiah takes the people out there
[1:52:48] I imagine it wasn't maybe so much of a
[1:52:53] comfortable moment for them I want you
[1:52:55] just to take this in a moment
[1:52:57] Nehemiah in the scriptures he takes him
[1:53:01] out there and now he has people those
[1:53:04] that's come with him and others that are
[1:53:05] there and here they are looking down
[1:53:07] upon Jerusalem the temples there but he
[1:53:15] points out considering how the walls are
[1:53:19] burned down are falling down I would say
[1:53:24] at that moment it wasn't something it
[1:53:27] wasn't a rejoicing moment it was but it
[1:53:30] was something that see God's burden upon
[1:53:32] their heart was they saw the need they
[1:53:37] saw the need and as they saw the knee
[1:53:40] then at that time Nehemiah spoke under
[1:53:44] the leading of the Lord I want to read
[1:53:45] this because I don't want to just
[1:53:46] paraphrase this he says you see the
[1:53:49] distress that we are in how Jerusalem
[1:53:53] lieth waste and the gates thereof are
[1:53:56] burned with fire come and let us build
[1:54:00] up the wall of jerusalem that wiii be no
[1:54:03] more a reproach then i told that home of
[1:54:06] the hand of my god which was good upon
[1:54:09] me has also the king's words that he had
[1:54:12] spoken to me and they said let us rise
[1:54:15] up and build so they strengthened their
[1:54:19] hands for this good work
[1:54:24] to build up the walls what were the
[1:54:26] walls
[1:54:27] it's pretension God said in Zechariah
[1:54:30] and I'll be a wall of fire round about
[1:54:34] you walls of protection remember when
[1:54:41] when when David had had compromised and
[1:54:44] let down the latter part of Psalm 51
[1:54:46] build up oh god the walls of Jerusalem
[1:54:51] the walls of Jerusalem when David spoke
[1:54:54] that they weren't or doubt but David
[1:54:56] recognized my identity is in Jerusalem
[1:55:00] can we I recognize our identity is not
[1:55:04] in Jerusalem of this earth but is in
[1:55:06] that New Jerusalem build up the walls
[1:55:09] the Lord build up the walls Lord the
[1:55:13] responsibility the keeping will God tell
[1:55:17] you so much so we could spend within
[1:55:20] that part right there that how that when
[1:55:25] when Nehemiah spoke within those things
[1:55:28] in regards to that and how that David
[1:55:30] spoke within that building up the walls
[1:55:32] of Jerusalem those walls of protection
[1:55:38] and I tell you what in the hour that we
[1:55:41] live in and the hour we live in the time
[1:55:46] that we live in let me say it's such a
[1:55:51] terrible age
[1:55:57] it's the most deceptive of all ages but
[1:56:03] yet God in the midst of this has
[1:56:08] ordained and he's bringing out of people
[1:56:12] called by his name and I'm telling you
[1:56:17] this right here you you are ordained to
[1:56:21] overcome in this hour there is
[1:56:24] everything that you can look at and I
[1:56:25] could look at it and say oh brother
[1:56:27] Samuel Oh brother Sam my kids in this
[1:56:33] world and the way it's going take your
[1:56:39] focus and say Lord the way your word is
[1:56:45] going we're going you understand
[1:56:52] it's what you're looking at who you're
[1:56:55] looking to because where you're looking
[1:56:57] your feet will follow and the call of
[1:57:02] the word comes through the message in
[1:57:04] this hour get back into line and step
[1:57:09] peeled up for well so Jerusalem if there
[1:57:12] stage has been let down say God give me
[1:57:14] the strength to build him up give me the
[1:57:16] strength the Lord the value of his
[1:57:19] presence the value of his life I'm
[1:57:24] telling you listen friends we are
[1:57:27] anointed for that this is not a pep
[1:57:29] rally but I believe with all my heart
[1:57:31] did one sometimes when you look at
[1:57:33] situations you can look at things it can
[1:57:35] seem so bleak but let me say this to you
[1:57:38] God is taking a bride out of this age
[1:57:45] and I'm gonna tell you right now I'm not
[1:57:47] gonna preach this today out of the
[1:57:49] scripture but God's identified this even
[1:57:51] in a promise that the Prophet led by the
[1:57:53] Spirit of God shook it before us that
[1:57:55] Bend this generation the climax of the
[1:57:58] rapture that began at the opening of the
[1:58:01] seals when our bodies are changed the
[1:58:03] climax of that there will be young
[1:58:06] people they'll be children that are
[1:58:11] changed and they'll be old ones that
[1:58:18] will be changed it's the promise that we
[1:58:22] have within this hour and what a
[1:58:27] responsibility that we have all may that
[1:58:32] ever be our prayer that he should touch
[1:58:35] them that he would touch us and continue
[1:58:39] to touch us you know it's something
[1:58:41] about a touch when God touches you don't
[1:58:49] you love him when he touches
[1:58:51] love it like brother BAM talks about he
[1:58:55] said that Corinthians book of
[1:58:58] Corrections he said he said I would
[1:58:59] think something's wrong if my wife every
[1:59:02] once in a while didn't come over to me
[1:59:04] and put her hand on me and say honey he
[1:59:11] said I would think something's wrong
[1:59:14] you see it's touch brother brems said
[1:59:17] well he said how did that wife he said
[1:59:20] she can take that husband that's all
[1:59:24] twisted up and boys she can touch him
[1:59:27] she can whisper in his ear
[1:59:29] honey getting set him down on the chair
[1:59:33] she can sit on his lap she said I
[1:59:36] appreciate all you do I believe going
[1:59:43] he's got a bride in this tower said
[1:59:47] Jesus sit down
[1:59:50] you're the center of our life but let me
[1:59:52] let me just tell you I want to sit on
[1:59:55] your lap he comes down you sit we sit on
[1:59:58] his lap I want to tell you I just love
[2:00:00] you I want to tell you I appreciate all
[2:00:04] you do you know every part I mean you
[2:00:08] know what I'm up you know when I'm down
[2:00:09] David said he knows my uprising in my
[2:00:11] down sitting Lord you know all of me you
[2:00:13] know all of that lord I want to say
[2:00:15] thank you for your faithfulness our
[2:00:17] thank you for your grace Lord thank you
[2:00:20] for direct thank you for correcting me
[2:00:21] but I've been wrong thank you lord
[2:00:25] and here we are just you know moving our
[2:00:27] hands through his hair
[2:00:31] you're my lord
[2:00:45] you're anointed let's just stop here
[2:00:48] you're anointed for this if you listen
[2:00:51] friends
[2:00:54] let's walk under his presence and I say
[2:01:02] this as your pastor those of you that
[2:01:04] look to me as your pastor I can never
[2:01:07] nor what I ever want to or never try to
[2:01:09] replace that personal relationship
[2:01:12] between you and the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:14] can't do it
[2:01:19] but your confidence on your face is to
[2:01:22] be slowly in him
[2:01:25] and listen to me well you look at within
[2:01:28] your own abilities it's true our own
[2:01:31] abilities are insufficient for the task
[2:01:34] but God has never ever called people
[2:01:39] never whose abilities were sufficient he
[2:01:43] called Abraham and Sarah bring forth a
[2:01:46] child it looked like he would have
[2:01:48] called people who would have had the
[2:01:50] ability God didn't do it that way all of
[2:01:54] these things are for you and I in this
[2:01:59] hour we would draw strength from that
[2:02:02] not to trust in our own ability and the
[2:02:07] trusting not in our own ability means
[2:02:11] fully submitting our abilities to him
[2:02:16] not Lord I don't know I can do it you
[2:02:19] can no no it's submitting our life into
[2:02:23] his hands my brother Ben talked about
[2:02:26] the man trying to put the coat on the
[2:02:27] little boy you say keeps going around
[2:02:29] you got one arm in it keeps going around
[2:02:31] keeps going he said but if he can give
[2:02:34] his hand to the man who has the coat
[2:02:36] then that man can take his hand and
[2:02:38] guide it into the other sleeve I believe
[2:02:43] the same God who changed my soul will
[2:02:46] also be the one who guide me into the
[2:02:49] change of my body I put on a crime it
[2:02:53] liken unto his own glorious garment it's
[2:02:57] a change our lives in his hands it's
[2:03:01] supernatural
[2:03:03] let me say this to you I know I keep
[2:03:05] going I just did so much of my heart but
[2:03:09] remember this we're not walking by
[2:03:15] earthly senses but is to recognize that
[2:03:18] the supernatural God is here to
[2:03:22] influence our lives because to look
[2:03:25] through just this realm right here
[2:03:28] it looks bleak you look through this
[2:03:30] realm right here you can look at a
[2:03:32] doctor's report it looks bleak you can
[2:03:35] look through these eyes you can say on
[2:03:37] my wayward son or my wayward daughter or
[2:03:39] my son or my daughter you're just
[2:03:40] looking at this eyes to remember
[2:03:42] remember the same God who got a hold of
[2:03:46] your life that's the confidence that's
[2:03:50] where your confidence is is in him in
[2:03:53] his working when he did in your life
[2:03:56] that's the confidence that you can look
[2:03:58] and have for those sand I've been
[2:04:02] praying for him for a long time keep
[2:04:04] praying you never forget to test him I
[2:04:07] think brother Billy Paul gave this
[2:04:09] testimony where man asked brother
[2:04:13] Branham and brother Billy Paul him to be
[2:04:14] there and a man asked for the Branham
[2:04:16] the question should I continue to pray
[2:04:19] for him and I know I don't remember all
[2:04:20] the parts should I continue to pray for
[2:04:22] him and brother branham's response to
[2:04:24] that brother was when he was asked
[2:04:26] should I continue to pray for my loved
[2:04:27] one should I continue to pray brother
[2:04:29] BAM turned and he asked the man he's a
[2:04:32] brother he said was Calvary worth it for
[2:04:35] you was Calvary worth it for you
[2:04:41] someone who held for you I think that
[2:04:46] says a whole lot someone who held for
[2:04:49] you you're loving this morning
[2:04:53] you've been commissioned this morning if
[2:04:56] if you've not had that commissioning in
[2:04:57] your soul you can receive that this
[2:04:59] morning don't just don't just go upon
[2:05:02] just being a part of a church or being
[2:05:04] around that won't work but God intends
[2:05:09] for you to live in victory and just
[2:05:13] remember there's this things that even
[2:05:14] that the Lord has spoken today and when
[2:05:16] God even through things if how he'll
[2:05:19] continue to guide listen to me
[2:05:20] let's just lay everything about our
[2:05:22] lives just let all the feelings let it
[2:05:24] be laid aside and say God come and
[2:05:27] direct me
[2:05:28] come and direct me Lord Jesus let's pray
[2:05:34] Lord Jesus
[2:05:40] we just want to say Lord this morning
[2:05:42] how we love you Lord words words fail us
[2:05:49] Lord so many times and father no doubt
[2:05:54] as I speak here at Lord this morning
[2:05:56] father there's so many things that even
[2:05:59] from throughout the years and even Lord
[2:06:02] when years ago Lord in times when
[2:06:06] speaking on the family all my so many
[2:06:09] experiences now Lord that father from
[2:06:14] even my heart and my life Lord the Lord
[2:06:18] I'm looking to you of that inspiration
[2:06:23] Lord that you would guide and direct our
[2:06:27] hearts and our lives what I know as I
[2:06:30] stand here today I don't stand as a
[2:06:33] perfect person in my self perfection by
[2:06:38] the blood of Jesus Christ in my soul
[2:06:40] where I've been redeemed absolutely the
[2:06:43] Lord you're working on me it's something
[2:06:49] Lord that
[2:06:51] we can have a lot of understanding
[2:06:55] becomes the father mother husband life
[2:06:58] but there's nothing like the
[2:07:00] experiencing of it because it's not just
[2:07:03] words it's supernatural and that it
[2:07:11] being supernatural it calls for this
[2:07:13] natural to submit that the supernatural
[2:07:19] God can fulfill his word of promise
[2:07:25] through our lives Lord Jesus I pray Lord
[2:07:32] that you would forgive us Lord of our
[2:07:35] mistakes and our shortcomings and I
[2:07:40] asked that Lord not only for myself but
[2:07:42] the entirety of this assembly and I ask
[2:07:45] that from our hearts Lord may just come
[2:07:50] a renewing Lord within this moment that
[2:07:53] where we are at Lord that for each heart
[2:07:57] in each life to take Lord God these
[2:08:00] things very seriously very dear to heart
[2:08:02] the Lord it's you your desires to be in
[2:08:09] us with skin on
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:16] I pray the Lord where mistakes or maybe
[2:08:21] there's things Lord that have been made
[2:08:24] I pray that fatherís we're here in your
[2:08:28] presence I pray that God that the enemy
[2:08:31] would not be allowed to Lord a press
[2:08:35] with condemnation but I asked the Lord
[2:08:38] that in genuine conviction which is
[2:08:41] entirely different from condemnation
[2:08:43] find conviction always points us not
[2:08:49] only what's wrong but to where that we
[2:08:52] can behold I pray this morning Lord may
[2:08:59] there be whole lives this morning Lord
[2:09:02] lives that would be made whole
[2:09:07] I pray that God
[2:09:10] [Music]
[2:09:12] maybe Lord which seems like promises
[2:09:15] that we're even looking at where it
[2:09:19] would seem like as it were maybe but the
[2:09:22] carpet has been pulled out from
[2:09:23] underneath our feet but I pray that God
[2:09:25] this morning as your presence warming
[2:09:28] those promises to our heart Lord and
[2:09:32] calling us back to look to you the
[2:09:37] supernatural God and that our faith
[2:09:41] would be in you Lord as your prophet
[2:09:45] told us over and over he said Abraham's
[2:09:47] faith was not so much in the promise as
[2:09:51] it was in the God who made the promise
[2:09:56] free stagger not but unbelief
[2:10:01] [Music]
[2:10:03] but he was strong giving praise under
[2:10:06] God believing that what he had promised
[2:10:10] he was also able to perform Lord I pray
[2:10:14] when we try to handle things in a
[2:10:18] natural level we will be frustrated but
[2:10:22] God like Moses when he went down to
[2:10:25] Egypt he didn't go down there just with
[2:10:28] his intellects of the word but he was in
[2:10:33] the hand of God and I pray this morning
[2:10:36] God that for every marriage Lord for
[2:10:38] every husband for every wife Lord God I
[2:10:41] pray for every mommy for every day I
[2:10:43] pray for Lord the grandparents Lord in
[2:10:45] their responsibilities in this hours
[2:10:47] well Lord Oh God
[2:10:49] may our lives be fully in your hand
[2:10:56] because as those seven stars are in the
[2:10:58] right hand then all the power and
[2:11:00] authority of a Godhead is behind us Lord
[2:11:04] Granite Lord our design Lord is to
[2:11:10] submit into surrender to you help us
[2:11:12] Lord I pray in the applying of your word
[2:11:16] I pray God we're homes that Lord where
[2:11:20] the voice of God is not being played I
[2:11:24] pray God that they recognize Lord the
[2:11:27] importance of God
[2:11:30] what Jesus we know it's it's not just a
[2:11:33] voice Lord God of the seventh messenger
[2:11:36] Lord but it's the voice Lord within that
[2:11:39] voice so god I pray Heavenly Father may
[2:11:43] who god they're just such an arrangement
[2:11:46] Lord a changement of me or God a
[2:11:49] consecration Lord like Joshua told Lord
[2:11:52] that father where things are laid aside
[2:11:55] and sanctifying ourselves Lord making
[2:11:59] ready for the cross we are standing we
[2:12:06] see our promised land in my father's
[2:12:09] house are many mansions we see it Lord
[2:12:11] coming into sight Oh God
[2:12:15] brandon lord i pray this morning may
[2:12:18] each and every heart lord with with real
[2:12:22] reflection not just in this moment but
[2:12:24] god as we leave from this place may our
[2:12:28] hearts be reflective in our own lives
[2:12:33] [Music]
[2:12:36] Granite Lord we pray in the name of
[2:12:41] Jesus Christ amen
[2:12:47] may God bless you just stay with me
[2:12:49] let's sing that song we've been made
[2:12:52] more than conquerors I believe that with
[2:12:55] all of my heart no matter the task no
[2:13:01] matter the situation God is for you who
[2:13:07] can be against you
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:21] amen just play it one time through let's
[2:13:25] just close our eyes let him just play it
[2:13:28] one time through my plate
[2:13:33] we just worship the Lord right there in
[2:13:36] your heart just take that in
[2:13:41] just just thinking up on that plane one
[2:13:45] more time
[2:13:46] [Music]
[2:13:59] let it be our prayer now we've been made
[2:14:04] [Music]
[2:14:10] over time
[2:14:13] [Applause]
[2:14:14] [Music]
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:23] [Applause]
[2:14:29] [Music]
[2:14:45] [Music]
[2:15:00] [Music]
[2:15:06] it's time you know many times when I've
[2:15:09] dealt with things within the family
[2:15:11] sometimes I know how the enemy would
[2:15:14] like to get you can get on people's
[2:15:15] shoulder and I'm not removing conviction
[2:15:17] but I want you to understand this when
[2:15:23] Esther came before the king
[2:15:28] she had a courage to stand before him
[2:15:31] she said they're going to slaughter her
[2:15:33] me and my people
[2:15:37] it has were said my word is my word
[2:15:40] I can't God and I changed not but he
[2:15:46] said this is what you can do
[2:15:49] you can you and your people can put on
[2:15:52] the full armor of God you can arm
[2:15:55] yourself and what seeds were sown but
[2:16:00] you can come and you can sow good seed
[2:16:03] that'll counteract the effect of the bad
[2:16:07] seed we're not left without a hope we
[2:16:14] can take that word and you rise within
[2:16:17] that word where the word has called you
[2:16:19] to this morning God has spoken his word
[2:16:22] to our hearts just as he did to Adam
[2:16:26] multiply and replenish the earth don't
[2:16:31] be one like brother BAM says it in the
[2:16:34] place of the message he said if you've
[2:16:35] been a failure as a housewife you've
[2:16:39] been a failure as a husband you're gonna
[2:16:41] be he said let that be a has-been you
[2:16:46] see it comes to a place repulsive I Paul
[2:16:49] said it like this he said I have learned
[2:16:51] to forget those things that are in the
[2:16:55] past
[2:16:58] I think of story
[2:17:04] here's this older Widow she takes robert
[2:17:08] e lee general robert e lee after the war
[2:17:10] he goes down to visit she says generals
[2:17:13] he said i want you to come on here i
[2:17:14] want to say something he comes out there
[2:17:17] she says general i want to show you this
[2:17:19] tree it's just a tree i want to show you
[2:17:22] this tree you say you know what happened
[2:17:25] to this street she went through a whole
[2:17:26] list my son was killed this was
[2:17:28] happening this it was a lot of things it
[2:17:30] was just it was just it be glue you know
[2:17:34] general he said he said cut it down and
[2:17:38] burn it
[2:17:40] there's some things you need as
[2:17:42] memorials but that Memorial held in
[2:17:47] bondage it might have seemed heartless
[2:17:50] but it was what she needed she needed to
[2:17:53] cut it down and burn it I'll tell you
