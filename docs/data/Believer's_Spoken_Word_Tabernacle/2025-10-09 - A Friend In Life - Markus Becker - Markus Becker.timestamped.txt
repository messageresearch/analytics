[30:03] good. Oh, hallelujah.
[30:06] Good old time. He put a song
[30:11] deep down in this.
[30:13] [Music]
[30:15] Oh, hallelujah.
[30:18] the good old time at
[30:21] the darkest night I know.
[30:25] Oh my God is Oh yes, you're good, Lord.
[30:30] Oh yes, Lord.
[30:33] Oh, we're singing now. Where we were
[30:36] sinners,
[30:37] we were so unworthy
[30:40] and you still for us, he chose.
[30:45] Oh, hallelujah. You filled us with
[30:49] your Holy Spirit.
[30:52] Now I can stand. I can testify
[30:57] with all of my mind that his love. Oh,
[31:01] it's everlasting.
[31:04] Oh, and his mercies I know tonight.
[31:09] Oh, God is good.
[31:12] Oh, yes.
[31:14] good all the time.
[31:17] Put a song of praise deep down in this.
[31:21] Oh my God is Oh, you're so good.
[31:26] Lord, you're good all the time. And
[31:28] through the darkest of night, I know.
[31:33] My God is good. Oh yes.
[31:39] Oh.
[31:40] Now, let's sing that chorus now.
[31:43] Although I may not even understand
[31:48] all of the plans that you have for me.
[31:54] But I know my life, Lord, is in your
[31:58] hands.
[32:00] And through the eyes of faith, I know I
[32:03] can clearly see that my God is good
[32:09] all the time. Oh yes, Lord. What a song.
[32:13] Put a song of praise deep down in this
[32:16] heart of mine. My God is good.
[32:20] Oh yes.
[32:22] Good all time.
[32:25] Through the darkest night, his light is
[32:28] going to shine. God is good. Oh yes,
[32:34] God is good.
[32:36] Though I may not, though I may not even
[32:41] understand.
[32:44] Well, all of the plans that you have for
[32:48] me.
[32:49] But I know my life, Lord, it is in your
[32:54] hands.
[32:55] And through the eyes of faith, I can
[32:59] clearly see that my God is good
[33:04] all the time.
[33:07] He's put us all put us on praise in this
[33:11] heart of mine. God is good. Oh yes, he's
[33:15] good.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Good all the time. Through the darkest
[33:21] of night, I know his light will shine.
[33:25] God is good. Oh my God. God is good. God
[33:29] is good. Oh my God is good.
[33:33] Oh God is good. God is good. My God is
[33:37] good.
[33:38] My God is good.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord Jesus.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's good all the time.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:48] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[33:51] Praise the name of the Lord.
[33:54] Praise the name of the Lord.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's a That's a real testimony.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because the times themselves can
[34:02] be very up and down. But God is a
[34:05] constant.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; He's not a variable. He's a constant.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; He's the same. And he's our keeper. He's
[34:12] our anchor through it all. Amen. What
[34:14] holds us and keeps us. Gives us the
[34:16] strength and the encouragement that we
[34:18] have need of day by day and moment by
[34:21] moment. Sometimes you come into a
[34:23] service and you might just feel like I
[34:25] don't think I'm going to be able to put
[34:26] one more step in front of the other. But
[34:29] God's grace is sufficient.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; And God God comes down and he has a way
[34:33] of just divinely connecting with us as
[34:36] his children. And you come out of there
[34:38] and my you're refreshed. You're
[34:40] strengthened. You got a brand new
[34:41] vision. All because of him.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; Because it's God watching over his word.
[34:47] &gt;&gt; And he sees to it. His word won't fail.
[34:49] And we're a part of that word. We not
[34:50] just a part of it. We are that word.
[34:53] Yes, sir.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're just so thankful. I
[34:55] don't want to take away here tonight,
[34:57] but we are so grateful to have uh
[35:00] brother Marcus here with us tonight and
[35:02] was thankful brother Nathaniel had
[35:04] reached out and uh brother Marcus had um
[35:06] conveyed through there and we were um we
[35:09] met one another. It was back was it 21
[35:12] or
[35:13] &gt;&gt; 22 somewhere around in there. And uh so
[35:16] as I told you last week, it just really
[35:18] enjoyed brother Marcus's spirit when I
[35:21] first met him. And then just getting a
[35:24] chance just to talk and just to
[35:25] fellowship and my just I just love his
[35:28] approach to the word. And so I I know
[35:31] that God God has something great in
[35:33] store tonight.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; He's going to use the the veil and the
[35:36] flesh of a German
[35:40] But it'll be God.
[35:43] &gt;&gt; God has a way. He hides and reveals
[35:46] himself in simplicity.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we we just want to pull on
[35:50] the gift of God tonight. Amen. I want to
[35:53] just say it's it's just such a such a
[35:55] privilege to be together. And so I
[35:57] wonder if we just couldn't couldn't
[35:58] stand and um uh before as brother Marcus
[36:02] would come and I hope it'd be all right.
[36:05] I just would like to sing that song.
[36:06] We're together again. Amen.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; And maybe just to greet one another in
[36:11] Christian love. And
[36:13] &gt;&gt; it's so wonderful, brothers and sisters,
[36:15] to dwell together in unity.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; It's all because of him. Cuz we're all
[36:21] as different from night is today. Let's
[36:24] just sing this as we invite brother
[36:25] Marcus to come. We're together again.
[36:29] Why don't you shake hands with one
[36:30] another? Bring one another Christian
[36:32] love. The Lord bless you. We're together
[36:36] again.
[36:38] Oh, and one accord.
[36:43] Oh, something good is about to happen.
[36:47] Something good is just in store. We're
[36:51] together again.
[36:54] Oh, just praising the Lord. We're
[36:57] together. Oh, we are together again.
[37:03] Just praising the Lord. Yes, Lord. We
[37:07] are together again
[37:11] in one accord.
[37:14] I know something good is bound to
[37:18] happen. Something good is just in store.
[37:22] We are together again.
[37:26] Oh, just praising the Lord.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, while we're standing,
[37:33] let's bow our heads if that's fine for
[37:35] you. Heavenly Father, we thank you for
[37:37] these wonderful songs and for the good
[37:39] atmosphere that we have. And Lord, may
[37:42] you just use me to say the right words.
[37:46] I want to say, Father, especially for
[37:48] those who are a little bit weak in their
[37:50] faith, a little bit people who are
[37:52] standing a little bit in their own way
[37:54] as to say help and encourage those
[37:58] especially among us. Father, may you
[38:01] help me to express the right words and
[38:04] may you help the audience to to receive
[38:07] it in the right way. Father, may you
[38:09] bless this church. May you bless the
[38:11] bride in the US, Father. And definitely,
[38:14] Father, may you bless Israel, Father,
[38:16] because those who bless Israel, they are
[38:18] blessed already.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; So, we ask these things in the name of
[38:21] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; And while we're standing, let's open the
[38:26] word of the Lord. And I thank very much
[38:28] the musicians
[38:31] in the first book of Samuel chapter 30
[38:34] verse 1.
[38:40] And it came to pass when David and his
[38:42] men were coming to Ziglac
[38:45] on the third day that the Amalachites
[38:47] had invited us invaded the south and
[38:50] Siglac and smitten Siglak and burned it
[38:52] with fire.
[38:54] And had taken the women captives that
[38:57] were therein.
[38:58] They slew not any either great or small,
[39:02] but carried them away and went on their
[39:03] way.
[39:05] So David and his man came to the city,
[39:08] and behold, it was burned with fire, and
[39:10] their wives and their sons and their
[39:13] daughters were taken captives.
[39:15] Then David and the people that were with
[39:17] him lifted up their voice and wept until
[39:21] there was no more power to weep. That
[39:24] that is part of our life, too.
[39:27] &gt;&gt; And David's two wives were taken
[39:29] captives. Ahinuim, the Jezraelite, and
[39:32] Abigail, the wife of Nabal the
[39:34] Carmelite.
[39:36] David was greatly distressed, for the
[39:39] people spoke of stoning him because the
[39:42] soul of all these people was griefed,
[39:45] every man for his sons and for his
[39:47] daughters.
[39:49] But David encouraged himself in the Lord
[39:54] &gt;&gt; his God. May the Lord add his blessing
[39:55] to the reading of his word. We may be
[39:58] seated and I trust that it is fine for
[40:00] you to put off my jacket. I really want
[40:03] to thank the pastor for the noble
[40:05] invitation and I can just give back the
[40:08] compliments that is seem to be a
[40:11] wonderful man and uh we had a very
[40:13] wonderful fellowship. I thank the Zas
[40:16] family and the church to for the time
[40:18] that is here and this is my last evening
[40:20] in that area and going back to Toronto
[40:23] tomorrow. So my name is Marcus Becker
[40:25] and my pastor is brother Rod Wald in the
[40:28] southern part of Germany and and uh yeah
[40:32] what what what what what can we say more
[40:34] about that? Okay. So, uh I would like to
[40:38] enter directly into the subject is as I
[40:41] want to respect the time when I'm
[40:44] presenting myself and people when I'm
[40:46] preaching somewhere for the first time
[40:48] and there is always a little bit of
[40:51] reservation and it should be that way
[40:53] you know what kind of thoughts the man
[40:56] have where does he come from where do
[40:58] you want to go but I want to say it like
[41:00] this the message that we believe does
[41:04] not come from America.
[41:06] That's right.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; It does not come from Jeffersonville.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; It does not come from brother Brandon.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; The message that we we believe comes
[41:14] from the presence of Almighty.
[41:17] &gt;&gt; It's not an American message.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a
[41:22] sect. Why should I become sectarian?
[41:26] &gt;&gt; And when you travel a lot, you see so
[41:27] much cold war.
[41:29] &gt;&gt; Cold war pertains to communism.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message that we believe is not
[41:35] a cult. Why should I become cultish?
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. The message that we believe is not
[41:41] a denomination. Why should I bring the
[41:44] trash of denominations into this
[41:46] message?
[41:48] &gt;&gt; What is the message of the hour? It's
[41:50] our father
[41:51] &gt;&gt; talking to us.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon was just a voice,
[41:55] &gt;&gt; but it's not his message.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if if if you write a letter to
[42:00] your to your wife,
[42:01] &gt;&gt; you will she will never embrace the
[42:03] postman,
[42:07] &gt;&gt; you embrace the man who wrote a letter.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; And the message comes from God.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; It's not brother Ram's message.
[42:15] &gt;&gt; So we understood when I'm traveling
[42:17] around is that you have to have a lot of
[42:20] patience with people because not
[42:21] everybody in the message is spiritual.
[42:24] &gt;&gt; People love God, but many people are not
[42:26] mature.
[42:27] Amen. And that's what we're facing. And
[42:30] you should never lose the love for God's
[42:33] people.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; If you lose that love, you have left
[42:36] everything, lost anything. So we find
[42:39] out that that I would like to entitle
[42:42] that subject for this evening, a friend
[42:46] in life.
[42:48] The message that we believe is not a
[42:50] doctrine. It's a relationship.
[42:54] Amen. It's a relationship between the
[42:56] heavenly father and the earthly bride.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; For 2,000 years, we tried everything. We
[43:01] tried Pentecostalism and it never
[43:03] worked.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; We tried reformation and it never
[43:07] worked.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; We tried legalism and it never worked.
[43:11] &gt;&gt; Legalism is only good to frustrate
[43:13] people.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; We tried Protestantism, it never worked.
[43:18] But the Bible says in the days of the
[43:20] voice of the seventh angel, the mystery
[43:23] of God,
[43:25] &gt;&gt; not mysteries, the mystery,
[43:28] &gt;&gt; what was in the back part of his mind.
[43:31] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon says God wanted to
[43:33] be a father.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; God wants to be touched.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so we we see that David was a
[43:41] tremendous man and and he was brought up
[43:46] in a way very
[43:48] uh unprivileged.
[43:50] You see, here is the father and and the
[43:53] new king of Israel is is is to be
[43:55] called, is to be searched. And the
[43:58] father thinks about the biggest and here
[44:00] comes here comes Arnold Schwatzengar and
[44:03] he
[44:05] &gt;&gt; and the prophet said, "God is not in
[44:07] muscles."
[44:09] &gt;&gt; The next one, he he he's intelligent. He
[44:12] can quote,
[44:14] &gt;&gt; but it takes more than just quoting,
[44:16] brother Brennan. Amen.
[44:18] &gt;&gt; It we we we came into a time where the
[44:21] mind of God
[44:23] &gt;&gt; takes the church over.
[44:25] &gt;&gt; Brother Blam said in the seventh seal
[44:26] when the supernatural breaks in that's
[44:29] the mind of God.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; We come we come from our background. I'm
[44:33] a man who has a gift. I'm a man who can
[44:36] preach. Maybe not good but again I can
[44:40] sing. I don't have a golden voice. But I
[44:43] always tell the church, look, God is not
[44:46] interested that we are entering blessed
[44:49] into the tribulation.
[44:52] &gt;&gt; God is not interested that we're just
[44:53] going to be blessed into the
[44:55] tribulation. God wants to take us home.
[44:59] &gt;&gt; So, so one of the things that brother
[45:00] Brandham taught us is never major on a
[45:02] minor.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; It's not a sin. I'm a gifted man when it
[45:08] comes to spiritual gift. But the gift is
[45:10] the minor for me.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; The giver is
[45:14] &gt;&gt; what takes me home.
[45:16] &gt;&gt; There's no gift that takes that gift
[45:17] that that gives me eternal life.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; But once you have the giver, you have
[45:21] everything that you need.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[45:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; So God is not interested that we are
[45:27] entering blessed into the tribulation.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; God wants to take us home. And the most
[45:32] important thing is the character of God.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can only understand you
[45:39] can only grow when when when you
[45:42] understand your father.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; I want to say this message present the
[45:47] Lord Jesus in such a wonderful way.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; Here is David and David un so
[45:53] underprivileged.
[45:55] His own father didn't see the potential
[45:57] in us.
[45:59] Don't don't be frustrated if the world
[46:02] does not know who you are
[46:04] &gt;&gt; unless you know who you are.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Sometime the church doesn't realize who
[46:09] you are. But it's important that you
[46:11] know who you are.
[46:13] &gt;&gt; And here comes the prophet and he said
[46:14] look God does not see the muscles. God
[46:17] doesn't see the knowledge. I mean God
[46:19] sees what's in the heart of a man.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; So David rose up that way. a man
[46:25] underprivileged and he became such a
[46:29] tremendous man and David had always an
[46:32] integrity for God,
[46:34] &gt;&gt; a character, a loyalty,
[46:37] &gt;&gt; but he made mistakes
[46:40] &gt;&gt; and God God loved to help David
[46:45] because God loves to help his children
[46:48] when our heart is right with God.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; God has many titles. the rose of Sharon,
[46:54] the lily of the valley, Jehovah, Gyra,
[46:56] and and and but in this generation, he
[46:59] reveals himself as a very present help
[47:03] &gt;&gt; in times of troubles.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Brother, this message has a father.
[47:08] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. We are the only
[47:10] people on this earth who are not who
[47:12] don't have a religion. Don't make that
[47:14] message to be a religion. This message
[47:17] has a father.
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[47:22] And so so so we see and we want to deal
[47:24] with some of the cases where I'm going
[47:26] to say that that there is cases of
[47:29] people they don't need a doctrine.
[47:32] I mean we have a lot of pictures of
[47:33] brother Brandham in our home.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; But that's not what changes the life of
[47:37] a person.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pressure will not change the
[47:42] bride.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; The bride needs love.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And love is the greatest power there is.
[47:49] Right.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; I always told the the young people, can
[47:52] you say amen so far?
[47:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; That I'm just that I'm just when we were
[47:56] younger, we were not believers. And and
[47:59] and I had two stars in my life. One was
[48:01] Arnold Schwatzenegger and the next one
[48:03] was Sylvester Stallone because we were a
[48:05] bad message believers. And I saw Arnold
[48:07] Schwarzenegger in a film and he used his
[48:09] breast muscle.
[48:12] And I was a skinny boy and I started
[48:14] bodybuilding. I always said the same
[48:17] thing. I repeated yesterday. Everything
[48:19] that you see here was here.
[48:22] It's just a change of dispensation.
[48:26] But I found out if you want to have
[48:28] muscles, you cannot eat McDonald's.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; You need a real steak. And if you want
[48:33] to have spiritual muscle, you cannot eat
[48:35] Facebook.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; You cannot eat Harry Potter.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; You need spiritual food in due season.
[48:44] This message that we believe is Red
[48:46] Bull.
[48:48] &gt;&gt; It's Red Bull.
[48:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. So all things are good. Good
[48:52] music, gifts, church, barbecue, all
[48:55] these things are good. But this is
[48:57] secondary.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. The first thing is the life of
[49:01] Christ.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; It's he himself.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; When he becomes her and she becomes him.
[49:06] Can you say amen?
[49:07] &gt;&gt; Nothing is wrong but never major on a
[49:10] minor. Right?
[49:11] &gt;&gt; And I I'm I'm I'm a person who got got
[49:13] experience. So we have to deal with two
[49:17] kinds of groups of people. There is
[49:19] persons who cannot.
[49:22] And more pressure is toxic for these
[49:25] people and there is pe persons who will
[49:28] not. And we're not talking this evening
[49:31] about pe people who don't want but we
[49:34] talk about people who want but you can't
[49:37] they cannot. Brother, when you become
[49:40] older in the message, you understand one
[49:42] thing. You're not changing anything
[49:44] unless God helps you.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; When we were younger, brother, we were
[49:50] full of zeal and full of naivity. But
[49:53] today, we understand, look, God has to
[49:56] do certain things.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. More pressure does not bring more
[50:00] results.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; But revelation is the greatest power
[50:04] that there is.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; It's the love divine. You can never
[50:07] separate revelation and love because
[50:09] revelation is not knowledge. Knowledge
[50:11] makes you arrogant
[50:13] &gt;&gt; and me myself.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; But brother brother sister I have a good
[50:18] news for you. Sometime we have to
[50:21] correct a little bit and and
[50:23] but I want to tell you this gospel is
[50:26] always good news.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; If it's not good news anymore then it
[50:31] loses its it its flavor. The good news
[50:35] is we have a father.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; Now to understand the family of God, we
[50:40] have to understand one thing that me
[50:43] personally I created many things
[50:48] but I have only one daughter. Brother
[50:50] Brandon said in a quote he says the
[50:53] first thing that came out of God was
[50:54] that logos.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; And then he says the first thing that
[50:58] God created were the angels. Quote
[51:00] brother Brandon and Bose is right. What
[51:03] is the difference between the logos and
[51:05] the and the angels? The angels were
[51:08] created.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. My daughter, the difference
[51:12] between my creations and my daughter is
[51:15] part of me is in my daughter. My DNA.
[51:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[51:21] &gt;&gt; So the logos is not a second person in
[51:23] the Godhead. Forget this. It's the same
[51:25] person.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; God became
[51:30] &gt;&gt; but it's the same person. Amen.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; Out of that logos came Melzdc.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Out of Melzdc came Jesus Christ. And
[51:38] brother Bram said the bride was in him
[51:44] &gt;&gt; as as Eve was in Adam.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? That
[51:49] when God called Adam, two people came.
[51:52] &gt;&gt; Two people came because Eve had no name.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; Eve was just woman taken from the man.
[51:59] &gt;&gt; God said, "Adam, where are you?" and Eve
[52:01] and Adam came. Eve got her name later.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; So whenever the Bible speaks of Christ
[52:06] and brother said you must see Christ in
[52:08] every verse in the Bible, there you see
[52:10] the brideal
[52:12] &gt;&gt; because she's brother and sister. I want
[52:14] to tell you this. This is your book.
[52:17] &gt;&gt; This is your story.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; We are not here because of William
[52:21] Brandon. We were here already in the
[52:23] mind of God.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold, I sent you the prophet
[52:27] Elijah. But that what it means. I mean I
[52:31] mean if if the bride was in Christ in
[52:33] what form ever? Okay I'm not
[52:35] speculating. Just say what the prophet
[52:36] say.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the bride was in Melzdc.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; And when the bride was in Melzdc, she
[52:42] was in the pillar of fire.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; And when the pillar when she was in the
[52:46] pillar of fire, the bride was in God.
[52:49] &gt;&gt; Brother, I tell you one thing. Brother
[52:51] Brim said God made a picture of us
[52:53] before the foundation of the world. And
[52:56] here and here we were.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. And God takes our souls and throws
[53:03] them in seven church ages over seven
[53:06] continents. And God put part of himself
[53:09] into us because David said in the
[53:11] Psalms, God made everything perfect in
[53:14] his time. He even placed eternity into
[53:16] our hearts. And there is only one who is
[53:18] eternal. That's God himself.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; So God throw our souls in seven church
[53:23] ages. And when seven church ages are
[53:25] over, the whole family is there.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody's missing.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Brother Benny was the first messenger
[53:33] who could say God is not anymore
[53:36] complete without you.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Brother, nobody can preach you into the
[53:41] bride
[53:42] &gt;&gt; and nobody can preach you out of the
[53:44] bride.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; God's people are not driven by fear but
[53:49] by love to the father.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:53] Amen.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, when we preach, we
[53:56] don't speak preach to to colors.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; It's too late for superior complexes and
[54:03] it's too late for inferior complex. We
[54:06] don't talk to colors. We talk to
[54:08] theophanes
[54:09] &gt;&gt; to the inner man to the heavenly that
[54:11] built that being that is that is
[54:13] definitely there. Can you say amen?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So, we understand nobody can preach you
[54:18] in. Nobody can preach you out. Not even
[54:20] your thoughts will bring you out.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; You will pay. We will pay for our our
[54:25] thoughts.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; But the plan of God is eternal.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; So here, brother Bray said, "The eternal
[54:30] thoughts of God." Let me ask you, are
[54:33] the thoughts of God eternal? If you can
[54:35] see this, you will see many things.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; That's what he says.
[54:40] &gt;&gt; If you don't see this, you just see God
[54:42] send a prophet.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; Brother, to see to see brother Brandham
[54:45] in the Bible is not very difficult. But
[54:47] you must see yourself. That's right.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; You must find your name in that book
[54:51] &gt;&gt; because brother Blam said the believers
[54:53] are the words in that book.
[54:54] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. So when the seven seals were
[54:58] revealed, we were revealed.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Where we came from, what we do on earth,
[55:02] where we go back to.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:06] He said they are not simply like a man
[55:08] with a blueprint who has drawn up which
[55:10] one day will be translated into
[55:12] substance and form but they are already
[55:15] real and eternal and part of God.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; There's a quote when brother Brandham
[55:19] says and please understand it the right
[55:22] way I don't have time. Uh he says he
[55:25] says God in the beginning was alone with
[55:28] his thoughts.
[55:29] In other words, he wasn't alone
[55:32] [Laughter]
[55:35] &gt;&gt; because his thoughts are eternal. They
[55:37] are substance. They are part of him.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; God knew. There's people that God
[55:42] thought about. Therefore, brother B can
[55:44] say the go the Beatles were not even in
[55:46] the mind of God. Was God surprised when
[55:49] the Beatles came? He knows everything.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; But they are people who are the thoughts
[55:54] of God expressed on this earth.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. So here's what brother Brham said.
[56:00] Just like a little dew drop.
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have a bride and we have a
[56:04] church. There's always time to
[56:06] evangelize because it's still time to
[56:08] say whosoever come let him come.
[56:13] &gt;&gt; Still time for that. Okay. But if you
[56:15] were not in the beginning in his mind,
[56:16] you will never become upright.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; But you can receive eternal life.
[56:20] Definitely. So
[56:21] &gt;&gt; just like a little dew drop. I don't
[56:23] know much about chemistry, but it must
[56:25] be that's the congelling of humidity on
[56:27] the stand or atmosphere. And when the
[56:29] nights get cold and dark, it falls from
[56:32] heaven and drops upon the ground. It
[56:34] fell from somewhere. But the next
[56:36] morning before the sun comes up, it's
[56:38] laying there. The little fellow
[56:40] shivering. Just let the sun come up.
[56:42] Watch it go to shining. It's happy. Why?
[56:45] The sun is going to call it right back
[56:48] to where it come from. That's good.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we have three pulls and no
[56:53] three pushes.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Nobody has to push the bride.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way with the
[56:59] Christian says brother Brandham.
[57:00] Hallelujah. We know when we walk into
[57:03] the presence of God, something in us
[57:05] tell us that we come from somewhere and
[57:08] we are going back again by the power
[57:10] that's pulling us.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the pre-existence of Marcus
[57:15] Becca, but the word that laid in us was
[57:17] part of us of him. Can you say amen?
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? The sun is pulling
[57:24] &gt;&gt; the little Therefore, we live in the
[57:26] time where the sun went up. The night is
[57:30] over.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, it's the rising of the
[57:34] sun. What to do? To pull us.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; Therefore, there's a man who can turn on
[57:39] the light. That's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; Therefore, and I hope you see it the
[57:45] same way. If not, you just add it to my
[57:48] ignorance. We live in Lauda. Definitely.
[57:51] So, it's a seven church age. But the
[57:53] bride cannot be in Laia.
[57:56] &gt;&gt; A person said to me, "Brother Marcus, we
[57:58] are in La." I said, "Maybe you, but not
[58:00] me."
[58:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "Because I'm not blind.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not miserable.
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I'm not wretched." Because brother Blame
[58:08] said, "My ministry is to declare that he
[58:09] is here. Blessed be the name of the
[58:11] Lord."
[58:13] &gt;&gt; But we live in loudies here. That's
[58:14] that's that's fine
[58:16] &gt;&gt; because the president of the of the of
[58:19] the millennium is not Mr. Trump
[58:22] &gt;&gt; though he is tremendous
[58:25] &gt;&gt; tre unbelievable that's fine but this is
[58:28] for this time here this is for this
[58:30] earth okay
[58:31] &gt;&gt; amen okay so keep a balance in all thing
[58:33] keep a balance in all thing can you say
[58:35] amen
[58:36] &gt;&gt; so we understand that brother Brandon
[58:39] explains where a shock come from amnesia
[58:43] now this amnesia we are told it's caused
[58:45] it came to a place where you cannot
[58:47] identify yourself in other words you
[58:50] don't know who you Ah, that's an unusual
[58:52] thing. It don't happen too often, but
[58:54] it's caused from a shock. Brother Bram
[58:57] speaks about World War I. And these
[58:59] people, they were shocked. It's somebody
[59:01] that don't even know who they are. They
[59:05] find it war. Sometimes soldiers get it.
[59:08] Sometimes people get it. Another thing
[59:10] cause it is the worry. Worry will cause
[59:13] it. Worry has no virtue to it at all.
[59:18] Therefore, if you cannot handle the
[59:20] news, read the Bible.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; If you cannot handle the news, read the
[59:26] Bible.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; No worry. And he says, "Now worry
[59:31] sometime cause it." Another thing that
[59:34] caused it among the people is getting
[59:36] between two opinions. That will cause
[59:39] amnesia. That's right. Therefore, every
[59:41] pastor protects his pullpit that not one
[59:44] is pulling in this direction, one in
[59:46] this.
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Now, look,
[59:48] &gt;&gt; when we came on earth, we wanted to go
[59:52] directly into our theophony, but we
[59:55] landed in Lorraine.
[59:58] God never asked you, do you want to be
[1:00:00] male or do you want to be female? Never.
[1:00:01] Nobody asked you, brother. It's a funny
[1:00:04] thing, but I come from a broken home.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; I come from a broken home. I never
[1:00:09] choose my home. I was 14 years old. I
[1:00:11] ready to die because I had cancer and
[1:00:13] God's miraculously healed me without we
[1:00:15] were not believers at that time.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; There are there's people who have a very
[1:00:19] difficult fate, a very difficult family
[1:00:22] situation.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; But one thing is sure, brother, if you
[1:00:25] think you came the wrong way on this
[1:00:27] earth, be sure you will leave the right
[1:00:29] way.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Be sure this is transforming process.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; Nobody ask you want to be rich or want
[1:00:36] to be poor.
[1:00:37] Nobody asked you want to be black or
[1:00:39] white. Nobody asked you.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said this quote,
[1:00:42] brother Brandham in the message, things
[1:00:43] that are to be. God pre-planned
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; your birth for many generations.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; You're not you you're here because God
[1:00:52] wants you to be here.
[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. You your life is not an accident.
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; You are desired. You are here because
[1:01:00] your father wanted you to be here
[1:01:02] exactly in that time.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:01:06] &gt;&gt; So, we wake up in a body that we don't
[1:01:08] like
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; when I wake up in the morning, I look in
[1:01:14] the mirror. I said, "I don't know you,
[1:01:15] but I wash you anyhow."
[1:01:18] Amen. We we we come in families that we
[1:01:21] don't like.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Brother, we we I never had a father and
[1:01:25] I so much hated my life. Run away from
[1:01:27] home. It's a long story, but I want to
[1:01:28] be don't want to become emotional this
[1:01:30] evening. I'm an emotional type. I'm a
[1:01:31] little bit of an evangelist. Therefore,
[1:01:33] I'm a little bit like who I am. Okay,
[1:01:36] that's how he is.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; But I tell you, I gave my heart to the
[1:01:38] Lord Jesus when I was 20, 21 years old.
[1:01:41] And one of the first thing that God
[1:01:43] revealed to me was that he was my
[1:01:44] father.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; Since that time,
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not fatherless.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, as as as earthly
[1:01:51] fathers, we made a lot of mistakes.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; But there so important to connect your
[1:01:56] children with the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:57] because he is the father.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? Here
[1:02:01] is that prodigal son.
[1:02:04] And people ask the question, where are
[1:02:06] all the miracles? Where are the sign? I
[1:02:08] tell you, our life is the miracle.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; We are the miracles. We are what God did
[1:02:13] in our life is the greatest miracle
[1:02:14] there is.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Never let Satan tell you a complex. This
[1:02:18] is the most glorious time that there
[1:02:20] ever was on earth. There's never been a
[1:02:22] day like this day before. This day, this
[1:02:26] scripture is fulfilled. Three years ago,
[1:02:28] it was a prophecy. Now it's history,
[1:02:30] brother Brandon.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; So here we go. So here we go. And we we
[1:02:36] we we we are in that connection. Amen.
[1:02:40] That we live in a body. We live in a
[1:02:42] society. Amen. And
[1:02:45] have you ever thought about that? And if
[1:02:47] I'm walking out, I trust it's good for
[1:02:49] the pastor because I have no notes. I
[1:02:50] just speak from my heart and that is
[1:02:52] always the best. But I have my red line
[1:02:53] that therefore I have make the slide. It
[1:02:55] keeps me a little bit my on my track.
[1:02:57] When Adam and Eve came in the Garden of
[1:02:59] Eden, they came as adults.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; They didn't come as babies. They came as
[1:03:03] adults.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. But we didn't come as adults. We
[1:03:06] went we we we wanted to come in our
[1:03:08] theophony, but we had to go first to the
[1:03:10] birth channel.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; I was there at the birth of my daughter.
[1:03:16] My wife needed one midwife. I needed
[1:03:18] two.
[1:03:19] &gt;&gt; Honest. Honest. I'm That's too much for
[1:03:21] a man. I I was I I was I was finished. I
[1:03:23] mean, a birth is is something is really
[1:03:25] something.
[1:03:26] It it makes a hard man's tremble.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; So So the whole our whole birth was
[1:03:34] nothing else than a shock.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the midwife took us and
[1:03:39] gave us a spanky. That was the
[1:03:40] beginning. That was the welcoming part
[1:03:43] of this earth.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; The midwife said, "You will get more in
[1:03:45] life. You will see." You see? But look
[1:03:48] what brother said. A shock caused
[1:03:50] amnesia. We came on earth and didn't
[1:03:52] know who we were.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's so good,
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; brother. I I was in the world. I could
[1:03:57] dance like Michael Jackson. Honest. I
[1:04:00] But I had to promise my daughter that I
[1:04:01] didn't do it behind the pulpit. Okay. I
[1:04:03] could I could do the moonwalk like
[1:04:05] Michael Jackson. Brother, I did not know
[1:04:08] who I was, but the great eagle knew
[1:04:10] there is an X somewhere.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; That was the difference. We did not know
[1:04:14] the Lord Jesus, but the Lord Jesus knew
[1:04:16] us.
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:04:20] He said, "Brother Marcus, what kind of
[1:04:22] doctrine do you have this evening?" I
[1:04:25] have a father.
[1:04:29] He calls me his own. Long before even
[1:04:35] time began,
[1:04:37] my life was in his
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. There was so many problems in the
[1:04:44] life of Job.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; And brother brother, I we will see it. I
[1:04:48] hope I'm coming through, but I want to
[1:04:50] stop at a certain time to to to not to
[1:04:52] to be respectful to the church. But job
[1:04:55] in that situation, brother, and here
[1:04:56] come the brothers, they mean well.
[1:04:59] Everybody who wants to help you means
[1:05:01] well.
[1:05:02] But the great pioneist by the name of I
[1:05:06] think it was Rubenstein, he was asked
[1:05:07] the question, Mr. Rubenstein, is it
[1:05:09] difficult to play piano? He said, no,
[1:05:11] it's not difficult. You just have to put
[1:05:13] down the right buttons at the right
[1:05:14] time. That's that's all what piano is.
[1:05:16] &gt;&gt; And and to have a leadership of God,
[1:05:18] it's so easy. You just must say the
[1:05:20] right thing at the right time to the
[1:05:22] right person in the right spirit and he
[1:05:24] has to receive it in the right way to
[1:05:26] understand the right thing what you said
[1:05:27] rightly. So easy to have a brother. If
[1:05:29] people go through difficult situations
[1:05:32] sometime no words is the best word
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; not interfere in the things that we do
[1:05:37] not understand anyhow.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Can you
[1:05:41] say amen so far?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; So we see that that that we are
[1:05:44] depending on on God. And here is Job and
[1:05:47] those youngsters they meant well. The
[1:05:50] first was a nice Lutheran. He said Job I
[1:05:53] mean the problem but only believe.
[1:05:57] I mean when we were younger we had these
[1:05:58] Bible slogans
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; but you cannot do nothing without God.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Uh only believe the prophet said I have
[1:06:06] a quote and thank you for the quote.
[1:06:07] Thanks I appreciate this but I need the
[1:06:09] right word at the right time. You
[1:06:11] understand?
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; The second one was a nice methodist. He
[1:06:13] said Job what you need is uh that it
[1:06:16] that it shivers down your back. And we
[1:06:17] love that we I come out of Pentecost. We
[1:06:20] love these things but to be honest
[1:06:22] that's not the answer for our question.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can have wonderful meetings. We
[1:06:26] can have wonderful conventions, great
[1:06:29] things, but it's not the answer.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Unless the Lord does
[1:06:35] something by his word in our life. The
[1:06:37] third one is a is is a Pentecost. He
[1:06:40] said, Job, you must you must speak in
[1:06:41] tongues. And we love those things. But
[1:06:44] it doesn't change Job.
[1:06:46] &gt;&gt; The fourth one was God.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Brother Bam said El was eloo.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; El Shai
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; in a man. And he said, "Job, look,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; your life is only 60, I say my own word,
[1:06:58] is 60, 70 years, but God will bring you
[1:07:00] back into your youth because somebody
[1:07:02] paid a price for you."
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; And Job said, "I know that my redeemer
[1:07:07] lives." And then God comes and said,
[1:07:10] "Who is the one darkening the counsel of
[1:07:14] God?" Job stop to be a teenager. Stop to
[1:07:17] be a child. Speak to me as a man.
[1:07:20] That's right.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that God calls the
[1:07:23] church into a maturity?
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; We are not teenagers anymore.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he just asked him one
[1:07:31] question. Job, I know all your life is a
[1:07:34] misle misery. But where were you boy
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; when the sons and daughters were
[1:07:39] shouting for God?
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; Job understands. I must make the picture
[1:07:44] of my life bigger than I thought it. Our
[1:07:47] life is more than just 70 years in
[1:07:49] Lorraine.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Or in Ohio. Amen. Can you say
[1:07:53] amen?
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; So we understand this. So here we see
[1:07:58] now please understand
[1:08:01] I have to do work in my work. I h I'm
[1:08:04] working as a social worker in the
[1:08:06] integration. I have to help people in
[1:08:08] integration.
[1:08:09] Please understand that people who are
[1:08:12] non-believers they have a soul.
[1:08:16] Well, when we were young in the message,
[1:08:18] we were just young. We were just
[1:08:19] teenagers. We everybody had the eagle
[1:08:21] belt
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; and the eagles. And nothing wrong with
[1:08:26] that. Come on. Okay. One of the
[1:08:28] ministers in the Germany had had seven
[1:08:30] angels tattoo.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; The only thing that that that we're
[1:08:34] missing is the eagle piercing. But one
[1:08:36] day somebody will invent this with all.
[1:08:39] But brother, that's fine having the
[1:08:41] eagle belt and the eagle tie and so
[1:08:43] forth. But the eagle must be here,
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; brother.
[1:08:46] You must be here,
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; brother. And we had that arrogance
[1:08:49] around us
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; that we could not shake. We were so
[1:08:52] revelated for some time that we couldn't
[1:08:54] shake a hand to somebody else who
[1:08:56] doesn't have that same
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; standard, brother. It's a complex.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; It's a question of lack of maturity. If
[1:09:04] we have, if you are a strong brother,
[1:09:06] then help your weak brother. Give him a
[1:09:08] helping hand. Help him a little bit up.
[1:09:10] Encourage him a little bit and said,
[1:09:11] "Hey, the Lord Jesus died for you the
[1:09:13] same as for me. Because revelation is
[1:09:16] progressive men.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Unbelievers have feelings.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; They have a life. And brother Ramy said
[1:09:25] life was precious in the eyes of God.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Now if you see a bump, a vagabond in the
[1:09:30] street, brother, for us it's just a
[1:09:32] vagabond. But definitely he's a boy of a
[1:09:34] mama. For mama, it's my boy.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; And maybe that same man is the father of
[1:09:39] a little daughter. And for the little
[1:09:40] daughter, that's her father.
[1:09:42] I tell you one thing, you are never
[1:09:44] wrong in respecting people.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; We're never wrong in that. You're never
[1:09:49] you you're never right in despising
[1:09:51] people. You will never help people by
[1:09:53] despising.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; So here we have two people by the name
[1:09:56] of France Beckenbower and and and Bertie
[1:09:59] Folks. Two uh soccer players both very
[1:10:04] very successful as players and as
[1:10:06] trainers. France Buck as coaches. France
[1:10:09] Beckenbower he was always let me say he
[1:10:13] he was healthy in his self-esteem okay
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; he said he said look when when they were
[1:10:19] losing a match he said look what's the
[1:10:21] problem next match we're winning what's
[1:10:22] the problem okay and Mr. Folks was as he
[1:10:26] as successful as Mr. Beckenbower but he
[1:10:29] was always somehow defending himself.
[1:10:32] Okay. Uh you must understand the defense
[1:10:35] uh made mistakes in their tactic and the
[1:10:37] midfielders they did this and you
[1:10:39] understand and they try to find out
[1:10:41] where's the difference and they found
[1:10:42] the difference in their youth in their
[1:10:44] childhood because Mr. Beckenbar comes
[1:10:46] from a wealthy family.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; His father is a was a prominent person.
[1:10:51] His uncle was prominent and Mr. folks.
[1:10:54] But in comparison, he was a foster
[1:10:57] child. He had no father and he had no
[1:11:00] mother. And they found out that the
[1:11:02] bonding
[1:11:03] and the life of a person the first three
[1:11:05] years is so important.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; The bonding, not the doctrine, the
[1:11:10] bonding,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; the warmness. Brother, if we take the
[1:11:14] empathy out of that message, we don't
[1:11:16] have anything anymore. We just have a
[1:11:18] cold formal doctrine. Not not more.
[1:11:21] Right.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; But this message came to reveal a
[1:11:23] father.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the bonding to the Lord Jesus
[1:11:28] Christ and I thought sorry for this is a
[1:11:31] little bit my throat
[1:11:34] and I thought by myself
[1:11:36] if the bonding in the natural in the
[1:11:39] family is so important for the
[1:11:41] development of the character of the
[1:11:43] personality of a child what about the
[1:11:46] bonding with my heavenly father
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; brother? If if if we're preaching a God
[1:11:53] who is always uh unsatisfied,
[1:11:57] who is always criticizing us and we
[1:12:00] preached it long enough, okay? A God who
[1:12:03] is standing there who is happy if we
[1:12:05] miss the rapture. Amen. Because we if
[1:12:08] people were rejoicing a little bit, we
[1:12:09] said remember it's only few very We are
[1:12:12] few this evening.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; We are not much people. We are not
[1:12:15] millions here. It's not it's not the
[1:12:17] stadium of Cleveland. We are few people
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; but people like to make it fewer and
[1:12:23] fewer.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Okay, that you always went out of the
[1:12:26] church. I said when I came in I thought
[1:12:27] I have the Holy Ghost but now I know.
[1:12:30] You see false preaching can take
[1:12:32] everything away from you. Right. Right.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; You see, so you you present a father who
[1:12:37] is always whatever you do, had you did
[1:12:39] you ever had a father in your life and I
[1:12:42] speak those who whose father was not a
[1:12:44] Christian that you felt your father was
[1:12:46] never never satisfied with you.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do did it was never enough.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Brother, we we we we we rose up. I'm a
[1:12:55] German. We don't show too much emotion.
[1:12:57] That is our problem. But I tell you
[1:12:58] this, with the Holy Ghost, we are able
[1:13:00] to break that circle
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; and we have to do it.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; And here and and and and that's part of
[1:13:07] a father. But if you show a father who
[1:13:09] helps you, a father who wants you to
[1:13:13] make the rapture, who does everything
[1:13:14] that you make the rapture, then you can
[1:13:16] sing what a friend I have in Jesus.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; It depends on the picture that we have
[1:13:22] of the almighty God. And I don't speak
[1:13:24] about the group who doesn't want a
[1:13:27] person says look I want to live in sin I
[1:13:29] want to live in immortality I want to
[1:13:31] drink I want to smoke I want and want I
[1:13:33] want to sing in the choir and you say no
[1:13:36] you can drink you can smoke you can live
[1:13:37] however you want but not here
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking about people who want to be
[1:13:41] right with God but they cannot achieve
[1:13:44] it somehow.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's the woman.
[1:13:49] Please understand.
[1:13:51] Amen. This also know that in the last
[1:13:53] days perilious times shall come. For men
[1:13:56] shall be lovers of their own self,
[1:13:58] covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[1:14:01] disobedient to parents, unthankful, uh
[1:14:04] uh without natural affection. Please
[1:14:06] understand, when I was younger and I was
[1:14:08] reading this, I thought they are
[1:14:09] monsters.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; But they are not monsters. They are
[1:14:12] human beings. But we live in a sick
[1:14:14] society
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; and sick generation produces sicker
[1:14:19] children. It's not the fault of the
[1:14:20] little ones.
[1:14:22] the next generation will be even more
[1:14:24] sicker. And there's one remedy for a
[1:14:26] sick generation. It's healthy families.
[1:14:30] &gt;&gt; And healthy churches
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; with a warmness, with an understanding,
[1:14:34] with a helping hand, with the love of
[1:14:36] God directing us.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen people that were so
[1:14:40] revelated in the message, but it was
[1:14:41] pure arrogance?
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; That's that's not what this message came
[1:14:45] for.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; It made us in the image of our own
[1:14:49] father. But that's what the message came
[1:14:50] for.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, here is Joyce
[1:14:54] Mia. And we can sing about Joyce Meer. I
[1:14:56] agree with you. Just a woman preacher, a
[1:14:58] prosperity gospel and so forth. And and
[1:15:00] I looked up her life because we had some
[1:15:02] people one time they were a little bit
[1:15:03] fans of her. And Joyce Meer doctrinally
[1:15:06] is completely wrong denomination. We
[1:15:08] understand all that thing. But she has a
[1:15:10] tremendous testimony because as a child,
[1:15:12] she was abused by her own father.
[1:15:15] Sexually abused over and over and over
[1:15:17] and over. and she threw away her life,
[1:15:20] lived in the streets. You know what she
[1:15:22] said? But one day the Lord Jesus found
[1:15:24] me
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; and established me and I came to be a
[1:15:29] minister to proclaim the good news in
[1:15:31] her way. We let don't think doctrinally.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; But I thought by myself if the Lord
[1:15:36] Jesus can do it in a denomination, what
[1:15:38] can he do in the message?
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; If he can do it in a denomination, what
[1:15:42] can he do? So never give up people.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; Never give them up. God has the last
[1:15:46] words. Amen.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Brother, when we were younger, I tell
[1:15:51] you one thing. We were full of zeal,
[1:15:52] full of energy, and full of naivity. I
[1:15:55] remember myself, we came to the Lord and
[1:15:57] I thought
[1:15:59] whole Germany
[1:16:02] comes to the message by
[1:16:07] that's what we thought,
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; And then God said, "Okay, Marcus is a
[1:16:10] fine boy, but we have to mold his
[1:16:11] character a little bit." And then it
[1:16:13] went by and you get it. And then and
[1:16:15] after all these years we
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; today we pray different. Lord keep me on
[1:16:21] the way.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Lord give me a pure heart. Give me a
[1:16:24] right integrity. Let that capstone not
[1:16:27] be just a doctrine. Let it be part of my
[1:16:30] life.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; We have to understand as ministers these
[1:16:33] youngsters they look upon us
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; and that's a good thing. They watch our
[1:16:37] behavior. They watch how we talk, how we
[1:16:39] handle things and they have a right to
[1:16:41] do this.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. But I want to tell you
[1:16:44] thing time means nothing for God.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; When you were young I see you say say
[1:16:50] you we we together we're family when we
[1:16:53] were young we were praying we were
[1:16:55] praying many many good things but we
[1:16:57] forgot our own prayers over the years
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; but God did not forget them.
[1:17:03] &gt;&gt; Time means nothing for God.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Space means nothing for God. God
[1:17:08] remembers our prayers when we were young
[1:17:10] 40 years ago. God remembers them. For
[1:17:13] them, they are still there. Therefore,
[1:17:14] we consecrate the children to the Lord
[1:17:17] knowing, Lord, one day my arm will be
[1:17:19] too short. Amen. But your hand will
[1:17:22] never be too short.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I give them back into your
[1:17:26] hand because I do my best. But salvation
[1:17:29] doesn't come from parents. Salvation
[1:17:31] comes from God.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Brother, I do you did your best. And and
[1:17:35] people are so sometimes so so so
[1:17:39] uh are so how they are. Okay. Can you
[1:17:41] say amen?
[1:17:42] &gt;&gt; So we understand. Amen. We live in a
[1:17:46] sick society.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. Understand the people. Have have a
[1:17:51] have a feeling for them.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Bride is bride. Therefore, I made the
[1:17:58] introduction. Nobody can preach someone
[1:18:00] into the bride.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; But there's still a hope for a person.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; People say there is no way. Jesus is the
[1:18:08] way.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have Jesus, you have a way.
[1:18:11] Brother Marcus, I'm in a dead end.
[1:18:13] You're not in a dead end. With the Lord
[1:18:14] Jesus, you have a way.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the way where there seems to be
[1:18:21] no way.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; That's what we tell the youngsters.
[1:18:26] Don't give up in your life. Never give
[1:18:28] up.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; Don't give up because you have a father.
[1:18:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not yet you holding up the
[1:18:34] message that you you're doing in the
[1:18:36] beginning, but there comes a time when
[1:18:37] this message carries you.
[1:18:41] Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That picture is a is not a father.
[1:18:44] It's not a grandfather. It's a father.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Of a little of a little girl. And
[1:18:50] uh this is a is a wedding ceremony. It's
[1:18:53] his own daughter.
[1:18:55] So the father has cancer. It's an
[1:18:56] unbeliever. It was over in there in
[1:18:58] Holland in in in in the news. He's an
[1:19:01] unbeliever, but he has cancer. He will
[1:19:03] die soon. But look the understanding
[1:19:05] that he has of a father. So what they
[1:19:08] are doing with his little daughter, they
[1:19:10] are playing marriage and he brings his
[1:19:14] daughter to the altar knowing that in a
[1:19:16] couple of weeks he will die and that
[1:19:19] girl one day will marry and they plan to
[1:19:21] continue the marriage from that moment
[1:19:24] on where she stands at the altar so that
[1:19:26] she can say my father brought me to the
[1:19:29] altar.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; Brother I told by myself if an
[1:19:32] unbeliever have such a concept of a
[1:19:34] father what about us who have the holy
[1:19:36] ghost? What about us, brother? These
[1:19:38] youngsters, they need a father.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; They need a mother.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; They need someone who hugged them.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's brother Brandham. I'm
[1:19:47] hurrying through. Amen. Here's brother
[1:19:50] Brandon. And he was so he was so happy
[1:19:54] when the car was full and they went over
[1:19:56] from Jefferson Will to Tucson. Rebecca
[1:19:59] said, "Brother, my father went back into
[1:20:00] the car and they had a little picture of
[1:20:02] a of a little angel." Amen. And and what
[1:20:06] did what did brother Bannon want to show
[1:20:08] his daughter, little one, honey, sugar,
[1:20:12] however you want to call it, daddy's not
[1:20:15] always with you.
[1:20:17] Do we tell those our children? We're not
[1:20:20] always with them. We have a little span
[1:20:21] of time, but in that time, we want to
[1:20:24] make a connection between you and the
[1:20:25] Lord Jesus that when I'm leaving, I know
[1:20:27] you're in the best hands that there is.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, it matters to serve the
[1:20:32] Lord. It matters to take the family and
[1:20:34] pray together. A family that prays
[1:20:36] together stays together
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; in the evening. Amen. Take your children
[1:20:40] and tell them how you how much you love
[1:20:42] them.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; People say, "Brother Marcus, we don't
[1:20:44] have time for this. We don't have time
[1:20:46] for this. You have to major on a minor."
[1:20:49] Amen. Remember God had many many things
[1:20:51] to do,
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; lot of angels,
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; lot of planets, the Milky Way, a lot of
[1:20:57] things to organize. But his family was
[1:21:00] for him so important that every evening
[1:21:02] he came down in the cool of the evening.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Again,
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; working is not sin. Making money is not
[1:21:10] sin. Building house is not sin. But ma
[1:21:12] never major on a minor.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; God and the souls first.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; God does not want us to go blessed into
[1:21:21] the tribulation.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; We're not we God wants to prepare us to
[1:21:25] go home.
[1:21:27] Make make your your bullet list.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; And have number one first and that's the
[1:21:33] mind of Christ.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; That's not having just Can you say amen?
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; So here brother Brandon takes it on a
[1:21:39] higher level that brother Brandon was
[1:21:41] asked two times the question. Your own
[1:21:43] angel is your theophony.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; Questions and answers two times. Brother
[1:21:48] Brandon please explain about our
[1:21:50] personal angel. And then brother Bra
[1:21:52] said he says and preach for two for two
[1:21:55] pages blah blah blah blah blah blah
[1:21:57] blah. I said blah blah blah blah blah
[1:21:58] blah and the last phrase he said yes
[1:22:00] that is your theophony the body in which
[1:22:02] you go when you die. What was the
[1:22:04] question? Brother Brandon please explain
[1:22:06] about our personal ancient. Brother
[1:22:07] Brandon please explain about the angel
[1:22:09] that beholding the face of the father
[1:22:11] all the time. Brother Brham said yes
[1:22:13] that's the body that you enter into when
[1:22:15] you die.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brother, brother, sister,
[1:22:20] when you die, God is not thinking. Um,
[1:22:23] will Marcus Becker get a theophony?
[1:22:26] Uh, was he always in church? Did he pay
[1:22:29] his tithings?
[1:22:31] Rather, Paul said, "We know
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; that we have."
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; When this earthly body
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; will be dissolved. We know. We have. We
[1:22:41] will not earn it.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; We have
[1:22:44] &gt;&gt; by what? By God's grace.
[1:22:46] &gt;&gt; Brother Marcus, will you make the
[1:22:47] rapture? I make the rapture by God's
[1:22:50] grace
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; because if I have to do it with my own
[1:22:54] power, forget it.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Don't ever start. But I have a father,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; brother. Brother, that your own
[1:23:01] theophony will would take you home.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; It was not Elijah searching the
[1:23:07] chariots.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; It was the chariot finding Elijah.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:23:14] Therefore, and I don't make a doctrine
[1:23:16] out of it, but let's say what the
[1:23:17] prophet says, okay? I put just my name
[1:23:19] into it, okay? He said, "Quickening
[1:23:21] power brought me. Let me see behind the
[1:23:23] curtain of time, and I've seen all of
[1:23:24] you there." And I said, "I was there."
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; Was it a vision? I couldn't say what it
[1:23:29] was, but I believe he must have seen
[1:23:31] Marcus Becca. What is the reason or what
[1:23:34] is my proof? My proof is that I love the
[1:23:36] Lord Jesus and this message so much. So,
[1:23:38] I must be part of the word.
[1:23:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the difference. A pre a
[1:23:45] brother said one time, "The church goes
[1:23:47] to church, but the bride comes to the
[1:23:50] word."
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Brother, I've seen too much people.
[1:23:54] Look, there is a song service, okay? And
[1:23:56] and I mean, if you're in Africa, okay,
[1:24:00] uh that's fine. I'm quite sportive,
[1:24:04] okay? But they're more sportive than us,
[1:24:06] okay? So for so for 30 minutes higher
[1:24:09] higher higher higher lower lower
[1:24:12] higher higher higher for 30 minutes.
[1:24:15] Okay, that's fine. There's nothing
[1:24:16] against it's not a sin. But then the
[1:24:18] word start and the whole church
[1:24:22] understand after 30 minutes of
[1:24:24] kalanetics
[1:24:26] after 30 then then you're finished. You
[1:24:28] see and then some of the people they are
[1:24:30] just and then there's there's only one
[1:24:33] way to wake them up is when the minister
[1:24:36] said I now come to the end
[1:24:40] and every minister is a little bit of a
[1:24:42] psychologist. She just continue continue
[1:24:44] after 50 minutes my last thought.
[1:24:49] Amen. Okay. And then the same people
[1:24:51] when the service is over and the worship
[1:24:54] start they are there brother that is
[1:24:56] minoring on the major.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; The major is the word
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; because music will not form my
[1:25:02] character. Transforming power is in the
[1:25:05] word of the Lord. Though all these
[1:25:07] things are good nothing will nothing but
[1:25:10] never major on a minor. You understand
[1:25:12] that?
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; So, we understand. Look, come on. Here's
[1:25:15] Mike Tyson. That was one of the stars
[1:25:17] when we were younger. Tyson, they call
[1:25:20] he said in the interview, he said, "I I
[1:25:22] I want I want to push the nose of my
[1:25:24] enemy right into his brain." Oh, and we
[1:25:28] said, "Oh, what a monster." But Mike
[1:25:29] Tyson said this, "And keep these things
[1:25:31] in mind." Amen. Keep one thing in mind.
[1:25:34] what this miss
[1:25:37] uh the woman preacher uh what she said
[1:25:40] she said she said a sentence that I
[1:25:42] never forgot. She said people who got
[1:25:45] hurt do silly things.
[1:25:48] That is the reason where a church must
[1:25:50] pay attention why somebody left. Why
[1:25:54] somebody has hard times and if we're not
[1:25:57] careful we are then bringing blame upon
[1:26:00] that person. People who got hurt do
[1:26:02] silly things.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Never throw dirt to people who leave the
[1:26:08] church. They have their reason.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Sometime it's just a hurt in their human
[1:26:12] spirit. If they if they're God's
[1:26:13] children, God calls them back.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; Just keep them up in your prayer. Just
[1:26:18] speak highly of these people. I mean,
[1:26:21] you know why we are not a sect? And I'm
[1:26:23] just I'm jumping a little bit because I
[1:26:25] follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost.
[1:26:27] You know why we are not a sect? A sect
[1:26:30] always works with membership,
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Ah, you are here in that building and
[1:26:35] you must understand uh we are the super
[1:26:37] eagles. We're not only a church. We we
[1:26:39] are we are the church. I just so
[1:26:42] wonderful the church. Now I'm so
[1:26:44] impressed
[1:26:46] the church and and and here come just
[1:26:50] here just we're just the chosen. We're
[1:26:52] really so a person leaves the church
[1:26:54] because he got hurt. Okay. Now the
[1:26:56] church has to defend itself. You must
[1:26:58] understand brother so and so left us
[1:27:01] because he was never part of us. It's
[1:27:03] very simple. For many many years you
[1:27:04] call him brother and sister and now you
[1:27:06] left him because he he was never part of
[1:27:08] us. So after some years the person
[1:27:12] e confesses his sin gives his heart to
[1:27:14] the Lord Jesus Christ and he comes back
[1:27:16] to the same church and the people say oh
[1:27:19] before the foundation of the world we
[1:27:21] were always eagles we were always
[1:27:22] together. Brother, who wants to believe
[1:27:24] that if a person is a brother, he's a
[1:27:27] brother.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; If he's part of the family of God,
[1:27:30] nothing will take him out of the hand of
[1:27:32] God.
[1:27:33] &gt;&gt; We must be very very wise because the
[1:27:35] person might not hear us. But the
[1:27:36] youngsters there listen very carefully
[1:27:38] how we deal with these kind of people.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; And if we need if we need credibility,
[1:27:44] if we want to have credibility, we must
[1:27:46] have character to deal with this
[1:27:48] situation. God allows us that we get
[1:27:50] sometime difficult people in the church
[1:27:52] and God just wants to see how we get
[1:27:54] along with these people.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So here's Mike Tyson.
[1:27:58] He said he said all these muscles I
[1:28:01] built up to to to protect my little
[1:28:06] soul. That's what he says.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. There's a quote, huh? Mike Tyson,
[1:28:10] he said, "As a boy, I was a sensitive
[1:28:13] boy
[1:28:15] and they hurt so much my feelings that I
[1:28:17] built up all these muscles so I could
[1:28:19] give everyone a knockout." Mike Tyson
[1:28:21] became Muslim
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; and he became
[1:28:27] Christian, a Baptist.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; That's what I want to say. You can
[1:28:31] change or we can change our religion
[1:28:35] three times a year. We can change our
[1:28:37] doctrine. We can change our church, but
[1:28:39] we will not change the inside unless the
[1:28:42] Holy Ghost comes.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We must. A person says, "Brother
[1:28:47] Marcus,
[1:28:50] I'm leaving your church because there's
[1:28:53] so much I have so much problems with the
[1:28:55] people in that church. I'm leaving your
[1:28:56] church." I said, "You can go, but the
[1:28:58] greatest problem goes with you.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; That's you yourself."
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; We can change our doctrine. We can
[1:29:07] change our our our way of of seeing
[1:29:09] things but it's so important that we are
[1:29:12] changed on the inside
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; that the mind of Christ takes over.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? But please understand
[1:29:20] that many people who are puffed up in
[1:29:23] their mind they have a soul which is
[1:29:26] very very sensitive.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; If you deal with people you must
[1:29:30] understand that some are just playing.
[1:29:32] They are not what they are. And you once
[1:29:34] you see it, you can deal with them in
[1:29:37] the right way. People who got hurt back.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; People who got hurt back.
[1:29:46] &gt;&gt; And if you understand this, you don't
[1:29:48] take all things too serious. You
[1:29:51] understand this answer comes from a hurt
[1:29:54] feeling. Amen. Once you see it, you take
[1:29:57] that situation under your control.
[1:30:00] Brother Billy Paul. Because if you deal
[1:30:02] with people, you must understand the
[1:30:04] human being. Brother Billy Paul, he
[1:30:06] brought us a very very nice example.
[1:30:09] He said he said he was with his father
[1:30:13] and his father had to correct a brother.
[1:30:16] And brother, it's so important that God
[1:30:19] corrects us. But if we're honest with
[1:30:21] one another, we have we don't have
[1:30:22] always the disponyability
[1:30:24] to be corrected.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; I don't say you, I said we.
[1:30:29] It takes the right atmosphere to really
[1:30:31] get a real correction.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Honest all of us. Okay. Billy,
[1:30:38] brother Brandma understood the people.
[1:30:40] He said to Billy Paul, "Billy, Billy uh
[1:30:42] on on that on that on that on that uh
[1:30:44] hunting trip." He said, "Billy, look, I
[1:30:47] have to correct brother so and so this
[1:30:49] evening, but he will not take the
[1:30:50] correction. There will be a tension then
[1:30:52] between us." Huh? If we are at the
[1:30:55] fireplace this evening, you ask me a
[1:30:58] certain and certain question. I will
[1:31:00] answer you the question and he gets his
[1:31:02] answer.
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. God is a gentleman.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; God loves to correct us, but he waits
[1:31:14] for the time that we can take it.
[1:31:19] Brother brother, if you're if you're old
[1:31:20] enough in the in the message, you learn
[1:31:22] to have patience with yourself.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And once you have patience with
[1:31:27] yourself, you have patience with your
[1:31:28] children
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; and you have patience with people in the
[1:31:32] church because you understand my brother
[1:31:34] cannot change unless God is changing the
[1:31:36] situation.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I make two two I'm I'm
[1:31:39] I'm going fast. Marilyn Monroe. Now here
[1:31:43] comes the angel of the Lord
[1:31:46] and God's brother.
[1:31:49] God is responsible for people not only
[1:31:53] for the bride. Amen. God loves people.
[1:31:58] Therefore, God so much loved
[1:32:01] the world. Here's the angel of the Lord
[1:32:04] comes to the prophet. Speaks about a
[1:32:05] young woman by the name of Marilyn
[1:32:07] Monroe. She will die in that in that
[1:32:09] minute.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; If God cares for Mary Monroe, be sure
[1:32:15] God cares for our children.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; And God cares for us.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then what happens is is and it
[1:32:26] might be humorous, but please understand
[1:32:29] one thing. The angel told brother
[1:32:32] Brandham the minute when Mary and Monroe
[1:32:34] will die. When we were born, our date of
[1:32:37] expire is already on our front.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; If you want to do something for God, do
[1:32:44] it today.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; If you want to tell your children how
[1:32:48] much you love them, don't wait for the
[1:32:50] funeral.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; If you want to tell your parents, look,
[1:32:53] mama, dad, I want to tell you one thing.
[1:32:55] I I I don't understand everything, but I
[1:32:57] want to show you that I was privileged
[1:32:59] to be in a house like this. If you want
[1:33:02] to tell a man, a man of God, if you want
[1:33:04] to tell anybody in the church how much
[1:33:06] in in in silence you have an
[1:33:08] appreciation,
[1:33:09] tell her today because you don't know if
[1:33:11] there is a tomorrow.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; If you want to serve the Lord, young
[1:33:15] young people, I'm a don't ask for
[1:33:18] tomorrow. Say today.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; If you want to give your heart to the
[1:33:21] Lord Jesus, don't wait for the next
[1:33:22] youth camp. Say
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; once you listen to the voice of God, I'm
[1:33:26] I say yes Lord.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:30] So when we were born the date of our
[1:33:32] expire is already on our front or the
[1:33:35] rapture. God knows each and everyone who
[1:33:37] is in the rapture.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; Therefore he calls us bride and not
[1:33:40] church.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; Brother said I hope you understand what
[1:33:43] I say. I don't call you don't call you
[1:33:44] church anymore. I call you bright.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; So people in Germany I mean that little
[1:33:50] lifespan 70 80 years. Amen. If you
[1:33:53] become older you understand every now
[1:33:55] every day every every year becomes
[1:33:57] precious.
[1:34:00] Brother, I was never in a false doctrine
[1:34:03] system.
[1:34:05] But I I I feel sorry that I missed too
[1:34:09] many years in this message by my own
[1:34:11] caralology.
[1:34:12] I was not in the world. I had the Holy
[1:34:15] Ghost relatively fast. I was a clean boy
[1:34:17] right through. But I was too childish
[1:34:20] for many situations. Was just canality.
[1:34:23] Okay. We were talking about things that
[1:34:25] we never understood. We were judging
[1:34:27] things that we never understood. God
[1:34:28] could never use it because we had that
[1:34:30] arrogant spirit. So we have these some
[1:34:33] years on this earth. I want to say this,
[1:34:35] let's do something with it.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; When my father asked me, I want to say,
[1:34:39] Lord, I did something with my life. It
[1:34:41] was not only I'm saved. No, I wanted to
[1:34:43] be a blessing
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; for the people around me.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; So there's a there's a movement in
[1:34:50] Germany which which speaks of healthy
[1:34:52] living. Okay. It's a little it's jokey
[1:34:55] but but but behind every joke is a
[1:34:57] truth. So you can eat eat healthy
[1:35:01] and you can live healthy but when your
[1:35:03] time is up you die healthy.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; When your time is up your time is up.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; So therefore the youngsters you can go
[1:35:11] to McDonald's
[1:35:16] when when our time we we can just eat
[1:35:18] broccoli the whole day
[1:35:21] but when our time is up our time is up.
[1:35:24] Do you understand this?
[1:35:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Here's brother Brandham. He
[1:35:27] said, "I wanted to come to that young
[1:35:29] woman, Marilyn Monroe." He She said that
[1:35:32] woman, she was always sad.
[1:35:36] Now, Marian woman was the nicest woman
[1:35:39] on earth. But brother Ram said she was
[1:35:41] always sad. Do you understand that
[1:35:43] outward beauty does not make you happy?
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that brother Bram
[1:35:50] didn't preach legalism? I mean I mean if
[1:35:53] if a man if you present yourself as a
[1:35:56] young girl and a man marries just your
[1:35:58] carcass.
[1:36:02] Is that the right word? The car of a
[1:36:05] car. Is that correct?
[1:36:07] Correct. No. Your carery. Okay. Of your
[1:36:10] the model model T or whatever.
[1:36:14] And the boy loves only your body. Do you
[1:36:18] understand that you have to make one
[1:36:19] diet after the other? So that your
[1:36:21] husband in 20 years will still love that
[1:36:23] same body.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; But if a boy loves your spirit, he will
[1:36:28] always love you.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; If a boy loves your being, you know,
[1:36:32] even you become older. Therefore,
[1:36:33] brother said, uh Sarah got older and the
[1:36:36] eyes of Abraham got dimmer.
[1:36:42] Amen. I wish you a husband who loves
[1:36:44] your spirit
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; because he will always love you.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you become gray and old and
[1:36:50] whatever, you know. Amen. But but
[1:36:52] somebody who loves your being.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; So So brother Brammy said this. She
[1:36:56] needed a real case of salvation.
[1:36:58] Something that gives security in her
[1:37:00] heart. Her father she has never seen.
[1:37:03] Her mother was in the insane
[1:37:04] institution. All that was on the mind of
[1:37:07] that girl. She needed Christ.
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; You see how brother Bram speaks
[1:37:11] different about those Jezebels.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that God understands
[1:37:16] life? And on the white throne judgment,
[1:37:19] God will be a true judge.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will. That's right.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; Our father, he will judge things
[1:37:25] rightly.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, he will.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Some of the people, they did not have
[1:37:29] any kind of chance.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Brother, I had to deal with people who
[1:37:32] left the message. And I always tell
[1:37:34] this, they never left the message. They
[1:37:36] left a fanaticism in this message.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; They got a complete perverted picture of
[1:37:42] the message and of the messenger and of
[1:37:44] the Lord Jesus Christ. They had no
[1:37:46] chance. It's in their mind. But God will
[1:37:47] be a a a right a good judge. God will
[1:37:50] understand. Can you say amen? I'm
[1:37:52] hurrying through
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; here. That other second woman you can
[1:37:56] call it brother Marcus. That's Liz
[1:37:57] Taylor.
[1:38:00] That is a girl. Same history. I mean in
[1:38:03] Hollywood. I mean at that age with that
[1:38:06] picture she's 16 years old.
[1:38:10] Do we understand that every person needs
[1:38:13] some good words? Because she says in her
[1:38:16] own biography, when I got my first
[1:38:19] compliments, definitely was sexual
[1:38:21] compliments. I mean, I longed for these
[1:38:24] kind of compliments. So, he became more
[1:38:26] and more worldly like a Jezebel. But
[1:38:29] behind, but don't look the outside. Here
[1:38:31] is a soul. Here's a heart craving
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; because we must understand that we're
[1:38:37] not robots. We are not computers. We are
[1:38:40] human beings. I tell you one thing.
[1:38:42] Brother Brmond said, "Every woman wants
[1:38:44] to be pretty. There's nothing wrong with
[1:38:46] that.
[1:38:47] &gt;&gt; We went to the time when we when our
[1:38:49] girl when when everybody wanted to be a
[1:38:52] scarecrow
[1:38:54] and we and we thought that's spiritual.
[1:38:56] The more scarecrow, the more spiritual."
[1:38:58] But brother said, "Every woman wants to
[1:39:00] be pretty." And there's nothing wrong to
[1:39:02] be pretty. The only thing is you
[1:39:03] shouldn't be sexy. That is the
[1:39:05] difference.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; That's And brother Brmond said, "Every
[1:39:08] man wants to be successful.
[1:39:10] There's
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; nothing wrong but bring it in the right
[1:39:12] channel.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; But every woman, every person needs some
[1:39:16] good words,
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; some empathy, some feelings. Therefore,
[1:39:21] when we pray, we don't just tell God
[1:39:23] what to do. We expect that God tells
[1:39:26] something to us.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; Now, our young girls, they have long
[1:39:31] hair and they have long dresses. They
[1:39:33] need a compliment. Now, who will give
[1:39:35] them the compliment? the school,
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; the world.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; No, that must be daddy. Daddy must tell
[1:39:44] his children, "Honey, I see you. You're
[1:39:47] looking great."
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's what we should do
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; to tell our children how much we care
[1:39:53] for them, what they mean to us. Not not
[1:39:56] to take these things as granted.
[1:39:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Now, I can tell the brother now you're a
[1:40:03] wonderful brother and you made a good
[1:40:04] song service and wonderful. That's fine.
[1:40:06] But if their own father said,
[1:40:09] I want to tell you one thing. I'm so
[1:40:11] proud of my boy.
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; That means a lot for a boy.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; We come from a generation where we did
[1:40:19] not give much compliments. We took
[1:40:20] things for granted. But but but but
[1:40:23] there is a generation who must break the
[1:40:25] cycle.
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; Brother, my my daughter was marrying a
[1:40:29] couple of weeks ago and I didn't make
[1:40:30] the didn't make the the the ceremony
[1:40:32] because my daughter thought papa's
[1:40:34] always so embarrassing. So they asked
[1:40:36] the other pre preacher to make that's
[1:40:38] fine but I said give me five minutes
[1:40:42] and my daughter was sitting there and
[1:40:43] the boy was sitting there and the
[1:40:44] audience was sitting there and I said I
[1:40:46] want to tell you one thing I'm a father
[1:40:48] of a daughter and my daughter was always
[1:40:50] a darling I consider my daughter to be a
[1:40:53] present from the Lord.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; I was so proud and I was so happy for 20
[1:40:57] years together. I thank you so much. We
[1:40:59] thank God for our child that became a
[1:41:01] friend in our life. So we wish you from
[1:41:04] all our heart the very best for the
[1:41:06] future life. It is so important that we
[1:41:08] express those things
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; because people are human beings. They
[1:41:12] need
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; some kind of a good words.
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; That is what these youngsters need in
[1:41:16] Hollywood and they just they don't have
[1:41:18] no channel who understand. Therefore
[1:41:20] they dress themselves the way
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; you remember that brother Brandham said
[1:41:24] he called these people Ricky's and
[1:41:26] Ricetta and God corrected him. He said
[1:41:28] you should not call him that this
[1:41:29] because many of them are still my
[1:41:31] children.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; We're not. You understand? I'm We can
[1:41:37] speak against outside things and preach
[1:41:40] against it. But find the heart of a
[1:41:42] person.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; So I'm I'm I'm I'm going through
[1:41:47] everything.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. To because I want to respect the
[1:41:51] time. Can you say amen so far
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; for do do you love the Lord Jesus?
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that was a real amen. That was
[1:41:58] a real Amen. Preach it, man. Don't teach
[1:42:00] it. Okay. Right. That makes even a
[1:42:03] German dance. Okay. We are not big
[1:42:06] dancers. Shouldn't. But let me see how
[1:42:07] it is. Look, God,
[1:42:11] if you don't have a father, maybe your
[1:42:13] earthly father was not the father that
[1:42:15] he should be. But don't forget, you have
[1:42:17] a heavenly father.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that? How
[1:42:20] beautiful the Bible is, how beautiful
[1:42:23] the message is. I mean here is the
[1:42:26] prodigal son and and I mean he he he
[1:42:29] spent all his money in in in what it was
[1:42:34] okay we are mixed audience you
[1:42:36] understand what I want to say
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; all kinds of immoralities and whatever
[1:42:41] he is now finished and then the Bible
[1:42:43] said this
[1:42:45] and the prodigal son came to himself
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; there was no deacon said now boy it's
[1:42:53] time to serve the lord And we have to
[1:42:55] God calls the boy back.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Woo.
[1:43:03] Tell me that is a miracle. When a person
[1:43:06] comes to himself,
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; you cannot force it. You cannot hinder
[1:43:10] it. That is between God and his child.
[1:43:14] &gt;&gt; And look how beautiful. Beautiful. What
[1:43:17] was the first revelation of that boy? I
[1:43:20] have a father
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; and my father is a wealthy man, is a
[1:43:25] fine man. He loves me. His first
[1:43:27] revelation was not, oh, we have brother
[1:43:28] Brandham.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. His first revelation said, I have
[1:43:32] a father
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; and my father is my king and my father
[1:43:37] is my savior and my father is my
[1:43:39] bridegroom and my father is my friend
[1:43:42] and my father is my servant and he is my
[1:43:44] king at the same time.
[1:43:46] Nothing can separate me from the
[1:43:48] relationship with my father.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; No sickness, no nothing because can you
[1:43:55] say amen?
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; And you see, look, third point, I'm
[1:44:01] hearing really stupid and I see the time
[1:44:03] and I told you last time said, "Brother
[1:44:05] Brandon, there is a new ministry." I
[1:44:08] spoke with some of the brethren today. I
[1:44:11] was telling them about what's happened.
[1:44:13] Just remember that the first time I was
[1:44:14] here, you remember the Lord had told me
[1:44:16] something was going to happen. Change in
[1:44:19] the m ministry. It happened. Said
[1:44:21] another one is going to happen and it
[1:44:23] happened. Now there is another one
[1:44:25] greater far greater than all the rest of
[1:44:27] them put together already confirmed and
[1:44:29] ready. I hope it happens tonight. I just
[1:44:32] might say this. I don't have time to
[1:44:35] explain it to you but the brethren who
[1:44:36] does know about it's wonderful. It be
[1:44:38] such a great thing for the people and
[1:44:41] I'm grateful to God that the hour is
[1:44:44] soon at hand when God is going to help
[1:44:47] his children. Third pull, especially it
[1:44:50] will be for those who can't master the
[1:44:53] faith to raise up and get a hold of God
[1:44:55] like they should do. I believe the Lord
[1:44:58] is providing a way for us now to take
[1:45:00] care of them also.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Some run into Yeah, that is wow. We we
[1:45:05] are both in the same denomination
[1:45:06] definitely. Though some runs into faith
[1:45:09] that they just can reach over and
[1:45:11] receive anything. Why? That's great
[1:45:13] faith. Some of them has mustard seed
[1:45:15] face and has to wait so long to get
[1:45:17] through. I believe the Lord is making a
[1:45:19] way for those people now.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; God a father.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; And the weaker the child is, the more
[1:45:29] the father cares.
[1:45:31] Brother, the coming of Revelation 10,
[1:45:33] the mighty angel Christ himself is God
[1:45:37] came down
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; to take us home.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; God is not waiting in heaven. And I know
[1:45:43] I'm repeating myself. Now, now there is
[1:45:46] a boy who who wanted to buy a dog one
[1:45:49] time and he sees the owner of the dog
[1:45:52] comes and the boy says, "I want to have
[1:45:54] this dog." And the owner says, "Why do
[1:45:56] you want to have this dog? I mean, it's
[1:45:58] just handicapped. He cannot walk like
[1:46:00] the rest. it's just uh has no value. And
[1:46:03] the boy, he puts off his trousers and
[1:46:06] from his knee down, he has an artificial
[1:46:08] leg. And he says, "I want to have this
[1:46:10] dog because when we go out, I understand
[1:46:13] him and he understands me."
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; Quote, "Brother Brandham, God became man
[1:46:18] to understand man."
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; Quote, Brother Brandham. God became
[1:46:24] teenager to understand the teenager.
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; So when you pray, God knows what you
[1:46:29] talk about.
[1:46:30] [Applause]
[1:46:31] Brother, that's our father, that's our
[1:46:33] God, it matters to serve the Lord.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; Brother, if you see that love that God
[1:46:39] has for his children, you cannot leave
[1:46:40] the message. There's no way.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; There's no way. You say, "Where should I
[1:46:44] go?"
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; When there's people together, there's
[1:46:46] always tension. I realize this. That's
[1:46:48] normal. It's humanity.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; But we have to say, Lord, where should
[1:46:52] we go? This message has words of eternal
[1:46:54] life.
[1:46:56] &gt;&gt; Here we hear things. Here we hear things
[1:46:59] that no denomination can preach
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; because in the days of the voice of the
[1:47:03] seventh age, the mystery of God shall be
[1:47:05] revealed.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Look, really last one. I had quite some
[1:47:09] more, but but that's fine. Look. Amen.
[1:47:11] The prophet Elijah. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Remember, Amen. Amen. He said, "And if
[1:47:18] the musicians would come up, okay, then
[1:47:20] then I know my time is up and I'm 50
[1:47:22] minutes over, but uh I would imagine on
[1:47:25] every limp," he said.
[1:47:27] All around through the place was swarms
[1:47:30] of angels. And God came down and he
[1:47:33] said, "My poor little tired servant.
[1:47:36] He's so nervous and tore up. He don't
[1:47:38] know what to do. I want to pick out the
[1:47:40] angels standing there that's got the
[1:47:42] softest hands.
[1:47:44] Don't you scare him. Walk over, stroke
[1:47:47] his bro. Right. Easy. And I want the
[1:47:50] best cook among you." And got up there
[1:47:52] and get all the vitamins that you can
[1:47:54] find and put it in this cornmeal. The
[1:47:56] world's turned him down, but I'm going
[1:47:59] to treat him right. Hallelujah. That
[1:48:02] means praise be to our God. Don't be
[1:48:04] scared of it, said brother Ram. Bring
[1:48:06] the best that we got. Cook him a corn
[1:48:09] cake and set him down some water. And
[1:48:11] this soft-handed angel went over and
[1:48:14] stroked the little servant of God on the
[1:48:16] bone. Remember? And we don't believe in
[1:48:20] tattoos, okay? But if you want to make a
[1:48:22] tattoo, then make that slogan to be a
[1:48:24] tattoo. Okay? At least write it on your
[1:48:26] heart.
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; Remember, if you have done your best,
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; God still got those angel in order. He
[1:48:34] loves you just the same as he loved
[1:48:36] Elijah.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the musicians would come.
[1:48:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we have a baby have the song I
[1:48:46] have a father. Do you know that chorus?
[1:48:48] Remember that, brother Bram says
[1:48:52] when Elijah
[1:48:54] when Elijah
[1:48:56] was on that under that juniper tree the
[1:49:00] day before he was killing 400 priests of
[1:49:03] Baal.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; Then he got an email from Jezebel.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; And look
[1:49:11] how God so much understanding us. God
[1:49:15] not being nervous.
[1:49:17] Amen. Brother Brham said it was the same
[1:49:20] God, the same doctrine, the same Elijah,
[1:49:25] but he doesn't dramatize the situation.
[1:49:28] Brother Brham said the anointing left
[1:49:30] the prophet,
[1:49:32] not more and not less. So if the
[1:49:35] anointing leaves you and you have your
[1:49:37] anxiety, remember that you are still the
[1:49:40] same son of God
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; that you are
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; in good days.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; And and and when Elijah was there and he
[1:49:50] wanted to die, God didn't send a social
[1:49:52] worker.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; God came down himself.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; If you are on the path of your duty, God
[1:49:59] will send the same angel to you.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Lift you up a little bit.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Tie this. And and and that angel had
[1:50:06] something to eat. Amen. Some vitamins.
[1:50:09] And brother Brham said, "I wanted to
[1:50:10] know what kind of vitamins were in those
[1:50:12] cookies because Elijah was running for
[1:50:14] 40 days in volume." The message that we
[1:50:17] believe is Red Bull because tie that
[1:50:21] story to Revelation chapter 10 when a
[1:50:24] mighty angel comes down and he gives a
[1:50:26] bride something to eat and she eats from
[1:50:28] the body word of the body of Christ and
[1:50:31] runs with it to the millennium and the
[1:50:33] great things hereafter.
[1:50:35] This message is substance, brother.
[1:50:38] this message substance. Can you say
[1:50:40] amen?
[1:50:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, God so much cared. So when we
[1:50:44] are down,
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; God is obligated as a father.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; He said my faithful my my my my my son
[1:50:53] was so faithful. I now I have to do
[1:50:55] something for him. Do you have the nice
[1:50:57] song? I have a father. Do you know the
[1:50:59] chorus? Isn't that beautiful? Is that
[1:51:01] our doctrine for this evening?
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Let me finish reading by this. All is
[1:51:05] fine, but you can play softly. Okay, if
[1:51:07] that is good. We were we were
[1:51:09] evangelists, young evangelists before
[1:51:12] and for us alter call was always
[1:51:14] crushing the people.
[1:51:17] I mean we were young. We were Yeah.
[1:51:21] But God has a lovely way to break us. A
[1:51:25] lovely way. And brother Bland speaks
[1:51:27] about the uh conversion of Gabe. Gabe
[1:51:32] was just a man who doesn't want to come
[1:51:34] to church. and his wife went to church
[1:51:37] and and always they prayed for that man
[1:51:40] Gabe.
[1:51:42] And one time he said he said, "Brother
[1:51:46] Ram said, Gabe went with the pastor.
[1:51:49] They went just hunting and the pastor
[1:51:51] looked back
[1:51:53] and Gabe was just standing there." And
[1:51:55] the pastor said, "Gabe, what's wrong
[1:51:57] with you?" And Gabe said, "Pastor,
[1:52:00] the sun is setting down and I realize
[1:52:03] the sun in my life is setting down, too.
[1:52:06] Amen. And then he said, "Dear this, do
[1:52:08] you see?
[1:52:10] You know, I'm not a of a good hunter.
[1:52:12] You know that I'm not getting anything."
[1:52:14] But God knew we need
[1:52:17] the thing that we were we need all these
[1:52:20] and these dead animals to eat and
[1:52:21] whatever. You see, I realize I have a
[1:52:25] father. I say in my own words, who gave
[1:52:27] me these things. He said, "Pastor, from
[1:52:30] now on, I want to serve that God, that
[1:52:32] father who cares so much for me,
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; brother, this message is not pressure.
[1:52:39] Not at all. This message is a love
[1:52:42] affair.
[1:52:47] &gt;&gt; The great man in this generation is not
[1:52:50] William Brandham."
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; No, sir.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; It's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what I want to tell my
[1:52:59] daughter, our all our children. Hey,
[1:53:03] amen. It matters to serve the Lord. You
[1:53:07] want to find somebody who loves you.
[1:53:08] Really, the Lord Jesus really loves you.
[1:53:11] Really loves you. A friend in life when
[1:53:14] everything went wrong. Have you ever had
[1:53:16] that thing especially on a Wednesday
[1:53:18] evening and you didn't feel well and you
[1:53:20] have some hard stomach pains and some uh
[1:53:26] head headaches
[1:53:28] and you have bad thoughts
[1:53:31] and then you hear a voice don't come
[1:53:32] this evening better stay home have you
[1:53:35] ever heard that voice
[1:53:37] &gt;&gt; in other words it speaks German and
[1:53:38] English
[1:53:41] German and because I hear it in German
[1:53:43] but I tell you one thing you don't
[1:53:45] become become more spiritual by staying
[1:53:47] home.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; When everything goes wrong, come in the
[1:53:50] house of your father. Say, "Heavenly
[1:53:51] Father, here I am.
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; I'm wrong as I can be, but I need you. I
[1:53:56] need a friend. I don't need a doctrine.
[1:53:58] I need now a friend who helps me."
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; If the devil tells you to stay home, you
[1:54:03] tell the devil, "You stay home. You stay
[1:54:05] home."
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Honest.
[1:54:10] And the more mistakes we make, the more
[1:54:12] we see how our father brings us through.
[1:54:14] And that brings a bonding
[1:54:17] that nobody can separate. Nothing will
[1:54:20] separate us from the love of God.
[1:54:21] Nothing. Can you say amen?
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; A great shalom. I have a father. And
[1:54:27] that's what's what's all about.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; His name.
[1:54:34] Oh,
[1:54:36] I have family.
[1:54:39] [Music]
[1:54:43] He calls me his own.
[1:54:49] [Music]
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; He'll never
[1:54:54] leave me.
[1:54:57] No matter where
[1:55:01] I go.

[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:55:08] my name.

[1:55:28] He hears me well. Brother D.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; If the pastor would come,
[1:55:36] &gt;&gt; yes, I have a maker.
[1:55:44] Oh, he called my heart.
[1:55:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, he knows who we are.
[1:55:52] Don't me
[1:55:54] even
[1:55:56] be asking.

[1:58:47] and changed my soul.
[1:58:51] And now I know I need you so

[1:59:15] alone.

[1:59:35] create
[1:59:37] them in your mind

[2:01:00] All I knew
[2:01:03] was chicken food.
[2:01:08] I knew nothing about him.
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:14] Oh, one day papa knew he had spoken.
[2:01:21] Another seed down here in this earth.
[2:01:27] [Music]
[2:01:29] He came flying over where

[2:02:18] [Music]
[2:02:20] God.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:02:26] Oh, I didn't know how to fly.
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what to say.
[2:02:37] [Music]
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; But the voice came speaking to me again
[2:02:45] and again and again.
[2:02:46] &gt;&gt; Oh my jeez. Come fly
[2:02:50] your way. Oh,
[2:02:53] at first I was afraid she died down with
[2:02:59] him. Oh,
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; but something God.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, it look like it.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Oh, and then I rose upon
[2:03:12] my
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:16] papa God.
[2:03:19] Oh
[2:03:22] my papa God,
[2:03:26] you save me.
[2:03:30] And of my whole life you forive me.
[2:03:37] You cleanse and make me whole.
[2:03:43] You came and touched my heart and
[2:03:47] changed my soul. Oh,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; and now I know
[2:03:54] I need you. So he's my
[2:03:59] God.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; I want to sing that last verse and you
[2:04:04] know you think about that as the eagle
[2:04:06] came by.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham don't tell us how many
[2:04:10] times it circled.
[2:04:14] &gt;&gt; But no matter what was going on in the
[2:04:17] little eagle Hallelujah.
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; It couldn't change from not being an
[2:04:21] eagle.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; But he was going to stay right there
[2:04:25] until it got
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; what it needed to get.
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; It might have been part five, part 10,
[2:04:31] part 50, part
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; He was going to stay right there.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; Because God's got confidence
[2:04:38] to break back all of that that darkness
[2:04:40] that's around us trying to discourage
[2:04:42] us.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said it like this and it's
[2:04:45] the rising of the sun. And he said,
[2:04:47] "What was different in that moment is
[2:04:49] that little eagle had always been taught
[2:04:50] to look down.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; And for the first time in his life,
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; he was taught to look up."
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; We We can never We look down. What's
[2:05:02] looking down? Looking at ourselves.
[2:05:05] &gt;&gt; We We can never be We can never be
[2:05:07] anything looking at ourselves.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; But it's looking at him.
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; It's looking at him. He's the one that's
[2:05:14] waved over us. He's the one that we're
[2:05:16] pointed to. It's the Lord Jesus. That's
[2:05:18] what that's what this message is. It's
[2:05:20] the revealing
[2:05:21] &gt;&gt; of the Lord Jesus
[2:05:23] &gt;&gt; where the way was blocked up and man had
[2:05:25] made it creeds and made it isms made it
[2:05:28] doing and made it all about what you
[2:05:30] could do. But God revealed himself in
[2:05:32] sovereign grace in this hour that I am
[2:05:35] your way.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; The target the target never moved.
[2:05:40] &gt;&gt; Man tried to move it but it never moved.
[2:05:42] &gt;&gt; He's remained the same. Hallelujah.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Aren't you grateful that the veils have
[2:05:46] been taken away?
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; That you can see him for who he really
[2:05:50] is and to know what his desire is
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; for your life.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; He wants to He wants to He wants to be
[2:05:56] everything, all things to you.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Don't you love him tonight?
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just look up to him. I
[2:06:04] didn't know how to fly
[2:06:10] and I didn't know what to say.
[2:06:16] [Music]
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; But the voice came speaking to me.
[2:06:22] &gt;&gt; It spoke directly.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; One of my dreams come fly your way.
[2:06:30] Oh,
[2:06:33] at first I was afraid
[2:06:36] deep down with him. Oh, but something
[2:06:41] got you stir. You looked back in.
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, and then I rose upon my
[2:06:51] eagle wings.
[2:06:52] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. You're my Lord God.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[2:06:59] Oh. Oh, he's my perfect God.
[2:07:04] Oh Lord, you save me.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. And from my old life, you
[2:07:12] forave
[2:07:13] me.
[2:07:15] Oh Lord, you cleans and made me whole.
[2:07:21] Lord, you touched my heart and changed
[2:07:26] my soul.
[2:07:29] And now I know I need you so

[2:07:43] love him.

[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that together. Oh, I
[2:07:54] love
[2:07:55] him.

[2:18:19] to me. He spoke to every heart in here.
[2:18:22] I believe that every one of our hearts,
[2:18:23] he spoke to us personally tonight. Thank
[2:18:26] you, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord God.

[2:18:49] you. Can we sing that?
[2:18:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; He carth for you.
[2:18:55] I think brother Brandham after he spoke
[2:18:58] marriage and divorce and
[2:19:00] &gt;&gt; it's not just a relief,
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; but he's seen God's grace come down in
[2:19:06] that meeting
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; where people had their suitcases packed
[2:19:10] and ready to
[2:19:12] &gt;&gt; go their separate ways.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; You remember hearing Brother Bram's
[2:19:15] voice and he calls out, I believe it's
[2:19:17] brother Robersonson, and his voice just
[2:19:18] breaks and he says, "It's over now,
[2:19:21] Roy."
[2:19:22] &gt;&gt; I believe that's the one he called out.
[2:19:24] You just you you sense not only the
[2:19:25] relief, but it wasn't just about relief.
[2:19:28] &gt;&gt; It was God's grace.
[2:19:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. For the father.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; There's nothing to me to be able to see
[2:19:35] the expression of God's grace.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; There's nothing like that.
[2:19:41] And then he sings before
[2:19:43] preaching.
[2:19:45] &gt;&gt; And I don't want to say preaching, but
[2:19:47] declaring who is this
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; Mazdc?
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; And he sings a song, he carth for you.
[2:19:54] Friends, I don't believe those things
[2:19:56] were coincidence.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; Just like at the end of the message, the
[2:19:59] one of the last messages of leadership,
[2:20:01] he sings the song at the very end, God
[2:20:03] be with you till we meet again.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Could we sing that together
[2:20:12] tonight?
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; He carth for you.
[2:20:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm glad he cares.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; And you know what? Not only does he
[2:20:20] care, but the prophet said he died and
[2:20:24] made a way that you might care.
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; We couldn't even have a care.
[2:20:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; If he didn't make a way that we could
[2:20:30] have a care.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, all you can see is Jesus Christ.
[2:20:36] &gt;&gt; It's all you see is the love of God on
[2:20:38] display.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory be to God.
[2:20:42] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it together. He
[2:20:46] careth for you.
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:54] Oh, he
[2:20:58] carth
[2:20:59] for you
[2:21:05] through
[2:21:09] sunshine
[2:21:11] or sun
[2:21:14] and
[2:21:16] I
[2:21:19] carth
[2:21:22] for you one more time.
[2:21:26] Oh,
[2:21:28] he
[2:21:31] carth for you.
[2:21:37] Oh yes, he
[2:21:42] carth
[2:21:44] for you
[2:21:47] [Music]
[2:21:50] through
[2:21:53] sunshine
[2:21:55] or shadow.
[2:21:57] [Music]

[2:22:04] car
[2:22:06] for you.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's been so good to be
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; in the presence of God
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; just to take in the word that God what
[2:22:19] he spoke to our hearts tonight.
