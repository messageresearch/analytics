Just send everything a right, oh God, that we can just be in that channel that the inspiration can flow through, Lord God, to minister to that need in our life. We commit this service, commit, Lord, all of these things into your hands. And we ask it for your glory and your glory alone, Father. We ask it now in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Amen. This morning, musicians, thank you. Amen. And [clears throat] we want to go right into the scriptures here. I'd like to go straight to Hebrews um chapter 4. And uh certainly I trust you uh had a good Thanksgiving and uh good thing Thanksgiving and Christmas is spaced out else we may not be able to fit in our clothes. [laughter] But uh we're just thankful to be together. We have so much truly to be um so much to be thankful for and you know to as a believer it's not just one day out of the year but we are so thankful to God's mercy. Amen. For what he's done in our lives. Uh undeserving. That's true. Uh but we are so appreciative of his grace. And so we are so grateful for that. It's good to be together. Amen. Here uh in service here this morning. Uh let's look here in verse nine. Amen. I think I see some of Sister Rita's relatives there. God bless you all. God bless you. Good to have you all. Amen. Brother Malachi, good to have brother Malachi with us. Amen. It's good to have all the home folks. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse nine, there remainth therefore a rest to the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, he also ha he ha also hath ceased from his own works as God did from his. Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fell fall after the same example of unbelief. For the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing aunderder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marorrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight, but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do. Seeing then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. Amen. May God bless you and bless the reading of the word as you're being seated. I want to just speak here just um take a few moments and to speak on this of yielding to God's desire. We've been looking at that on the fellowship within the mystery. God brings us completely uh into a complete uh offering and separation. And when we look at coming into this place of rest, we know that what we have read here in Hebrews, there is an objective that God has had for his people. And actually what all have longed for since that time that Adam and Eve when they when they were they made the choice and they separated uh from the word of God and and then as they uh went out but yet God made a promise that he would make a way back. &gt;&gt; And so it has been the longing that has been within the heart of the believer. The prophets all have looked with great anticipation even for the fulfillment of the word that would carry us clear into the millennium and the future home. And yet there are many many little increments that are fulfilled along the way in order to make that possible. The main the main event of all of that is is God himself becoming one of us in order to pay the ransom and then that his life might be shared with you and I. And so when we see this of the rest and that's God's objective. That's the whole objective of the word. The word is not is not sent uh to trouble you. The word is not sent to condemn you. The word is sent to in order to bring conviction. And the conviction is is where the spirit of God moving upon your life to re to help you and I to see who we are and the privileges that we have and that we're actually living beneath. And God's grace is sufficient in that moment when he makes those things known. It isn't about God asking you and I to actually do something, but it's actually you and I just yielding to God's presence that is right there as he's fulfilling his word. And as we'll yield to him, God will take us to where we need to be. &gt;&gt; So when we think of this, brother Brandham asked this question. And I want to just background a little before I display this quote. And he's asking the question, he says, "How do I get into that body to the body of Jesus Christ into the rest which is the Holy Spirit?" And we have been looking at how that God will take us through justification, sanctification, and then into the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And it's all all of that is a work of the self-same spirit. As a matter of fact, brother Brandham would say that of the Holy Spirit, he says it is not. He said it's it's more of the same spirit that fills you and seals you away. So it's the Holy Spirit working all along. I mean you and I could not even repent unless the spirit of God brought conviction on our life because the Bible says it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance. So when we see it's God working all along to bring things about in our life. So it's it's it's all of this is him. And that's why you don't ever want to lose sight of him because when you when when when when he begins to deal with your life and then you start, you know, becoming focused upon, well, I don't see this or I I I don't know if I'm here, you're losing sight of him. You have to keep your eyes on him who begun the work in your life. &gt;&gt; And if you just focus on him, that's Satan wants to distract you and get your attention on yourself. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because if he can get you to look at yourself, he's already got you whipped. &gt;&gt; Because remember, the prophet said, "Don't ever doubt your weapon." And the weapon you've been given is the word. &gt;&gt; And God makes his word real to your heart that you might stand with that word and say, "The promise of God belongs to me." And that's for every promise in your life. Even when symptoms come up, if you're praying for healing and God's dropped the word in your life, don't ever look at anything else but that promise. It doesn't matter what comes up. It doesn't matter what surfaces. God's word cannot fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when we look at this, brother Ram is talking how do we get into this? And he refers to Romans 8:1. And and let me just backgroundly. And the scripture says, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ that walk not after the things of this world, the flesh, but after the things of the spirit." And he says that paying no attention to what the world has got to say. If you're sick and the doctor says you're going to die, you pay no attention to it. It don't bother you a bit. If they tell you you have to become a Catholic before you're saved or Presbyterian or have to do this, you pay no attention to it. And he says, "Therefore, no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, the things that they see, because everything that you see with your eyes is earthly." &gt;&gt; But it's the things you see in your spirit through the word. The word is God's looking glass that reflects what he is and what you are. And brother Brandham just has a time there. [laughter] This is the only book in the world that tells you where you come from, who you are, where you're going. Show me any page of literature anywhere with all the science, anything else, every good book that's written, none of it can tell you that this is God's looking glass that shows what he is and what you are. And then in between there is the bloodline that shows what you can be if you want to make that choice. &gt;&gt; SO GOD SHOWS HE reveals himself. SEE HE MUST REVEAL HIMSELF. THEN THAT through the revealing of himself it actually is unfolding the mystery OF WHO WE ARE. AND SO THEN in between there because remember it takes God's grace revealing the word and it takes his grace to bring us to what he is showing that we can be. NOW WHAT HE'S SHOWING THAT we can be is that of through his word being revealed to our lives. And so when when he's when he's coming in this way, it's grace that takes us all the way. like Paul would say that he hath called you according to our gospel uh through sanctification to the obtaining of the glory of Jesus Christ. So God has made a call through his word WITH AN OBJECTIVE to obtain the glory. And let me just tell you the glory I IS NOT JUST THE FILLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. That's the beginning of it. But then when THE HOLY SPIRIT IS COME, IT LEADS US FROM GLORY UNTO GLORY UNTO GLORY TILL EVENTUALLY THIS BODY IS changed and we stand. &gt;&gt; Yes, he is. &gt;&gt; SO YOU KNOW FAITH IS SO IMPORTANT IN OUR LIVES and faith the Bible tells us without faith it's impossible to please God. And this is why when brother Brandham would would speak of this of faith and what we see in front of us, you don't ever go by your feelings. Now, I know throughout this congregation, we all still have our feelings. And I would like to be able to announce to you that by the time you get to a certain time in your walk with God that your feelings will no longer bother you. But that's not true. Your feelings are still there. As a matter of fact, brother Brandham took it like this in uh works of faith express one of the last messages that he's preaching and he says this. There's many other places perfect faith 1963 but he says it like this. He says look he says I'm not above temptation. YOU THINK THAT I DON'T get feeling gloomy at times and he tells us this is the remedy for him in works of faith express. He said, "When I get to feeling what they call a a case of THE BLUES, I GO to Romans chapter 4 and I read about Abraham." And he said, "As soon as I begin to read that about Abraham," he said, he's staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief. He said, "I BEGIN TO FIND those things begin to move away from my life." You see the word IS OUR SOURCE OF STRENGTH NOT ONLY WITHIN OUR LIVES BUT REMEMBER it's the word as the Holy Spirit as we read the word we take in the word IT'S WHAT GIVES STRENGTH TO YOU AND I listen friends the greatest things and times is when even you don't feel like listening to a message you don't feel LIKE PRAYING YOU DON'T EVEN FEEL SPIRITUAL AND READY AND ready to enter into that as a matter of fact you you're LIKE STRUGGLING LIKE WITH YOU DON'T WANT TO, you don't, you don't, YOU JUST DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE PUTTING FORTH THE EFFORT, BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS, and I know I'm just echoing words that YOU'VE ALREADY EXPERIENCED, BUT WITHIN THAT MOMENT, WATCH HOW GOD comes on the scene, BECAUSE JUST THAT MOMENT OF YIELDING AND PUTTING ON that message, just that moment OF GETTING IN PRAYER WITH GOD, and you find a sweet release THAT COMES INTO YOUR LIFE, AND GOD KNOWS JUST WHAT YOU HAVE. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING? THAT'S ALSO TRAINING YOU AND I BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT MORE TIMES IN THE JOURNEY WHERE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FEEL LIKE A CHRISTIAN OR FEEL HIS PRESENCE. BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T FEEL IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT HE'S STILL NOT GOD OF HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD MOLDING US AND maturing us as sons and DAUGHTERS OF GOD. NOT THAT WE'RE WALKING AROUND PRESUMING, BUT WE KNOW AS HE SAID, "LO, I AM WITH THEE ALWAYS." &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS WHY when the prophet would say it like this, don't ever go by your feelings. He said, even after you're prayed for, oh, brother Brandham, I I I'm more sick now than I was. He says, that's the greatest sign that you've already BEEN HEALED. &gt;&gt; NO DOUBT YOU COME OUT of a service and THE SPIRIT OF GOD HAS MOVED upon your heart IN SUCH A WAY YOU MIGHT BATTLE TEMPTATIONS LIKE YOU'VE NEVER BATTLED THEM BEFORE. BUT THAT'S THE GREATEST SIGN that you have been set free &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SATAN IS TRYING TO CLAIM TRYING TO RECLAIM WHERE GOD HAS BROUGHT LIBERTY EVEN INTO YOUR HEART TO ACCEPT WHAT HE'S ALREADY done through his word for your life. &gt;&gt; And this is why brother Bram says it has nothing to do with it your feelings. It's my faith that does it. He said, "Right before us, we see the image of a perfect healed person by faith. Then we just make step by step till we step right into that person and just walk right on." So God makes him makes reveals before you what you can be. He reveals before you of a perfectly healed person. And you see what is actually creating THAT THAT'S NOT A MIRAGE. THAT IS THE word that he came to Abraham when the Bible says the word of the Lord CAME UNTO ABRAHAM BY VISION. THIS WORD IS ACTUALLY opening up. And remember, we're living in THE HOUR OF JOHN 5:19. THE SON CAN DO NOTHING, BUT WHAT HE SEETH THE FATHER DOING, THAT DOETH THE SON LIKEWISE. WE'RE NOT LIVING IN THE DAYS OF HEARING, BUT I HAVE HEARD, BUT NOW I SEE. WE'RE LIVING IN THE HOUR OF THE OPEN BOOK. WE'RE LIVING IN THE HOUR OF AN OPEN VISION. WE'RE LIVING IN THAT HOUR WHERE GOD OPENING IN our hearts and walking straight into that. &gt;&gt; You know what you see in front of you can affect you greatly. &gt;&gt; And Satan also likes to pre present if I can say visions. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. That's why every that's why every vision has to be checked by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. This is why when even they tried to persuade the prophet, if that angel of the Lord gave you a vision and told you this and told you that, brother Bram said, if he told me this AND TOLD ME THAT and it's not according to the word, IT WOULDN'T BE THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; SEE, THE WORD OF GOD IS OUR [screaming] ABSOLUTE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT HOLDS OUR IDENTITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Glory be to God. &gt;&gt; And then the enemy, look what he did when they came into come into the land. They the 10 spies came back and they came back with a report with a vision and it WAS THAT HAD SUCH AN ANOINTING UPON IT THAT IN THE TENTS THE BIBLE SAYS THEY WEPT BECAUSE THEY SAID WE CAN'T DO IT. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE. THE GIANTS ARE TOO BIG. I I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO LIVE THAT KIND OF A LIFE. WE'LL never be ABLE TO LIVE OVERCOMING. LOOK WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO TO MY CHILDREN. MY CHILDREN are not going TO LOVE ME. THEY'RE GOING TO HATE ME. MY MY CHILDREN CAN'T LIVE THIS. BUT YOU SEE, CALEB AND JOSHUA WERE NOT LOOKING AT THE CIRCUMSTANCES, BUT THEY WERE IN FELLOWSHIP WITH THE GOD WHO HAD ALREADY DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE. AND THEY WERE LOOKING TO GOD THAT HE IS STILL THE SAME GOD THAT PERFORMS THE impossible things. &gt;&gt; HEY, LISTEN. GOD DON'T NEED A GREAT BIG PERSON TO WHIP THE DEVIL. GOD DON'T EVEN NEED GREAT BIG FAITH. HE JUST NEEDS SIMPLE FAITH TO TRUST HIM. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE YOU WITH ME? GOD DON'T NEED MIRACLE FAITH TO WHIP THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; GOD JUST NEEDS SIMPLE FAITH TO TAKE HIM AT HIS WORD AND STAND RIGHT THERE LIKE ABRAHAM DID FOR 25 YEARS. &gt;&gt; YOU MIGHT SAY, "BROTHER SAMUEL, LOOK AT ABRAHAM'S MISUNDERSTANDINGS. LOOK AT HIS STUMBLINGS." THAT'S TRUE. BUT FIND IT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. FIND IT WRITTEN IN THE NEW DIVINE COMMENTARY OF HIS LIFE. YOU KNOW WHY? THE THINGS YOU READ ABOUT, MISUNDERSTANDINGS, ALL OF THESE THINGS HERE AND THERE, THAT WAS THAT FLESH PART OF ABRAHAM. BUT WHAT IS WRITTEN IN THE NEW TESTAMENT IS WHAT COULD PASS THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THAT WAS THAT REAL TRUE SEA OF WHO ABRAHAM, THE IDENTITY THAT GOD SAW ALL ALONG AND IT WAS THERE IN THE BOOK. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. So walk step by step until we come into that image. Ephesians 2:8, "For by grace are you saved through faith, and that not of yourselves. It's the gift of God." Now, I know everyone has faith, but in order to believe and to be saved, it takes God coming &gt;&gt; and anointing your faith &gt;&gt; to direct it in him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who's the finished work? &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, because remember in the days of Noah, they there was the ministry that was contrary to that of Noah that said there's no such thing as rain. &gt;&gt; What they were preaching is what they had always known. &gt;&gt; But God was revealing the very judgment you're scoffing at, it's right under your feet. &gt;&gt; It's right above you. They were unaware OF IT. BUT GOD HAD A MAN WHO BECAME AWARE OF THE OTHER REALMS. AND WHEN NOAH BEGAN TO SPEAK and they were they were saying, "Oh, there's no such rain." What was that? That was unbelief. You know the prophet said, "UNBELIEF IS FAITH, BUT IT'S FAITH in the wrong direction." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; SO IT IT TAKES GOD. NOW, WHAT WOULD CAUSE SOMEBODY TO DISBELIEVE? IT WOULD be the enemy, &gt;&gt; right? It would be the spirit. IT'S NOT A PERSON, IT'S A SPIRIT. SO HERE WE ARE. EVERY PERSON COMES IN TO THIS WORLD. YOU HAVE A DEPOSIT OR A PART OR THAT ABILITY OF FAITH. BUT IT COMES NOW THROUGH WHAT INFLUENCE we come under AND RESPONDING TO THAT INFLUENCE. I I'M SO GLAD THERE'S SOMETHING IN ME THAT IS NOT WHAT I PUT THERE OR WHAT YOU PUT THERE, BUT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WILL RESPOND AND RECOGNIZE EVEN WHEN WE WERE UNAWARE OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE. YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING, HOW DID I GET EVEN HERE THIS MORNING? BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. GOD IS THE FIRST ONE THAT HAD GPS, GOD'S POSITIONING SYSTEM. AND GOD KNOWS HOW TO FIND HIS CHILDREN AND BRING THEM RIGHT INTO position &gt;&gt; and bring understanding to our lives. &gt;&gt; For we are his. This is the scripture in verse 9. NOT OF WORKS LEST ANY MAN should boast. &gt;&gt; It's not about just let me drop this here. It's not about how long a person was at the altar. Right. &gt;&gt; I think we understand. You're mature enough to understand this. I know we're not talking about against the altar. What we're talking about is the prophet said, he said, "You could lay on this altar for days. &gt;&gt; They would have to bring your food to you." &gt;&gt; He said, "BUT IT WILL NEVER do you any good unless YOU ACCEPT WHAT HE'S DONE." YES. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, SOMETIMES WE'RE FIGHTING AT THE PROMISE THAT GOD SAID, "I'VE ALREADY MADE IT AVAILABLE. &gt;&gt; STOP [screaming] FIGHTING IT." &gt;&gt; WHO WAS JACOB FIGHTING WITH? WELL, YOU SAY THE ANGEL of the Lord. He was fighting against his own will. &gt;&gt; Are are you hearing me now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz see, IT TAKES WHAT THE GRACE OF GOD DOES. It takes this out of our hands and it's placing it into God's hands. This is why the next scripture says we are his workmanship. That's why DAVID COULD SAY, "KNOW you that we are his sheep." &gt;&gt; The sheep OF HIS PASTURE. WE HAVE NOT MADE OURSELVES, BUT HE HAS MADE US. &gt;&gt; WE'RE HIS WORKMANSHIP, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. God already saw you &gt;&gt; walking in the promised land of this world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; AND DON'T CARE HOW MUCH I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH TIME. I don't care what has passed. Do you remember the quote I read to you last week and I sent that to a number of other ministering brothers and so forth. I read to you last week and I I wanted to just take that and just deal with that here. But let me just uh emphasize that where where where the prophet says some of you are sitting here disagreeing even right now. He says but I can see a little bit I can see further than what you can see and one of these days you're going to be believing this and it's not going to be too very far along. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he said the HOLY SPIRIT HAS TOLD ME TO PUT A LITTLE SPOT OF grace here for you. AND THEN HE REFERS US TO ABRAHAM AND SARAH BECAUSE SARAH laughed within herself at the promise. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SEE GOD, HER IDENTITY WAS WITHIN ABRAHAM. YOUR IDENTITY, MY IDENTITY AS THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, IT WAS ALWAYS IN CHRIST. AND SO IT IS GOD THAT IS SUPPLYING YOU AND I. IF IT HAD BEEN LEFT UP TO you and I, THE BIBLE SAID WE ALL LIKE SHEEP HAVE GONE ASTRAY. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IT WAS NOT YOUR FAITH THAT THAT THAT THAT FOUND THAT FOUND YOU, BUT IT WAS GOD'S FAITH THAT FOUND YOU. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID IT WAS NOT, HE SAID, I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED IT WAS ABRAHAM'S FAITH THAT PERFORMED THE MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; You say, "Wait a minute. Hebrews 11 said through faith SARAH CONCEIVED." BUT ABRAHAM WAS THE CHANNEL &gt;&gt; THAT THAT FAITH CAME THROUGH A MESSENGER. HE WAS A CHANNEL THAT FAITH CAME INTO HIS HOME AND GOD CHANGED THE SITUATION around &gt;&gt; and it became personal. This is why that God the unfolding of this faith to you and I even as the prophet would stand there in perfect faith and he says look if you don't have faith for this right now I'm going to he said you put your faith and I'm going to put my faith on top of your faith and we are going to believe and claim the promise of God for our life. Hallelujah. But you see right now in this hour I'm not walking by the FAITH OF WILLIAM BRANDHAM. BUT GOD USED THE FAITH THAT HE DEPOSITED THE REVELATION. It has been PLACED UPON OUR LIVES. BUT LOOK WHAT IT DOES. IT IS TO BRING ABOUT A REAL FAITH IN our hearts in the promised word of God. &gt;&gt; So good. &gt;&gt; So what did you have to do with it? What did I have to do with it? &gt;&gt; Nothing but just yield. &gt;&gt; That's so good. &gt;&gt; Just yield. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. See, this is why when brother Brandham talks about the ministry changing and he speaks of how this new ministry coming on and I say this sometimes this terminology is I understand new sometimes for individuals but each ministry Noah's ministry Jesus ministry it had three pools within that ministry. So there is God is continuing to unfold with an achievement like the achievement of the Lord of the ministry of the Lord Jesus was not just to heal the sick to walk on water but the achievement of that ministry was to deliver the word and with that delivering of the word is TO PAY THE PRICE AND SEND BACK THE HOLY SPIRIT. SO THE GOAL, are you listening to me now? The goal of every ministry, AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MINISTRY THAT COMES FROM ALMIGHTY GOD, IS NOT TO produce little Elijah's, Noah or little this. NO, NO, NO. THAT'S NOT GOD'S IDEA. BUT GOD'S IDEA IS THAT HE CHOOSES LIVES THAT ARE UNIX THAT HIS SEED LIFE CAN PASS THROUGH. AND SO IT'S NOT MAN ESTABLISHING his image in the heart of a people so THAT THEY CAN SAY, "OH, I SEE YOU GO TO SO AND SO." WHY? OH, BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE THIS DOCTRINE. YOU BELIEVE THAT. WE'RE NOT UNDER THE NAMES OF DOCTRINE. I DON'T WANT MY OWN NAME BECAUSE MY OWN NAME MEANS I'M IN A fallen condition. &gt;&gt; But the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST IS ABOVE EVERY NAME. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Is that all right? SO THE OBJECTIVE, LISTEN TO ME NOW, THE OBJECTIVE OF EVERY MINISTRY IS THAT IT WOULD PRODUCE CHRIST IN YOU. IT WAS CHRIST THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF NOAH. AND WHAT DID HE DO? ONLY EIGHT WERE SAVED. Went in there to the ark. Is that right? &gt;&gt; BUT THERE THE EFFECT WAS COMING INTO THE ARK. SAME WAY IN ELIJAH'S DAY. REMEMBER ELIJAH? EVERYBODY SAW WHAT HAPPENED ON MOUNT CARMEL, BUT IT WAS 7,000 THAT NEEDED THE STIMULATION OF THAT REVELATION TO BRING COURAGE TO STAND ON GOD'S WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT THE OBJECTIVE FOR WHAT? IN WHAT WOULD be allotted to them? For the Holy Spirit to be able to I don't want to just say dwell, but to come and to influence the lives of the elect. &gt;&gt; Because the Calvary hadn't been made away. So there could not be an indwelling of his spirit like you and I are made are made privileged to be a partaker of. But that's the objective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody okay sir? &gt;&gt; That's the objective. So the prophet is talking about now he said there's a new ministry that's coming on in his own ministry. And he says now he says it's going to be far greater. He says and I I don't have time to explain it to you but the brethren who knows about it it's wonderful and it'll be such a great thing for the people. I love that statement. IT'LL BE SUCH A GREAT THING FOR THE PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; He It wasn't ABOUT WILLIAM BRANDON. IT WASN'T ABOUT MAKING a name for himself. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, WHEN HE STOOD IN FALSE ANOINTMENTS AT THE END TIME, HE SAID, "IT AIN'T WHAT I KNEW. IT AIN'T WHAT I DID. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT I SURRENDERED MYSELF TO. I JUST HAPPENED TO BE STANDING PRESENT WHEN HE DID THE MIRACLES." AMEN. [laughter] &gt;&gt; GOD HAS ALLOWED YOU AND ME TO BE STANDING PRESENT. AND WHAT WE'RE WATCHING IS NOT THE UNFOLDING OF HIM ON OUT HERE, BUT WE'RE WATCHING THE UNVEILING OF CHRIST IN OUR OWN LIVES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's breathtaking, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Overwhelming. I'm grateful to God that the hour is soon at hand. I believe when God is going to help his children, especially for those who can't muster the faith to raise up and get a hold of God like they should, I believe the Lord is providing a way for us now to take care of them. Also, &gt;&gt; some runs into into the faith that they can just reach over and receive anything. That's great faith. Some of them has mustard seed faith and has to wait so long to get through. I believe the Lord is making a way for those people now. And I don't know when it will be, but it will be just as certain as I'm standing here. It will be. Let me just kind of update. It's not coming. It is. &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD MAKING A WAY FOR YOU AND I. HOW HAS GOD DONE THIS? HE HAS DONE THIS BY his word. &gt;&gt; Now remember when WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EVEN THAT of his WORD AND HOW THAT he would reveal himself. Now remember, God shows who he is, what we can be, and then in between there is that bloodline THAT IF YOU CROSS THROUGH THERE, IT'S WHAT it's bringing you through there. It brings you RIGHT OVER HERE. SO GOD HAS PROVIDED A WAY TO CLEANSE US THAT HE MIGHT seal or fill our lives and bring us into this place of an expression. So I want to say this to you in this manner. Choice is a great thing. &gt;&gt; Right. That's true. &gt;&gt; Now, just keep that in mind. Brother Brandon makes this statement in choosing of a bride, how choice is a great thing. And we know we have many choices in life, but there's really two big choices in life. And so within this faith, I want to just let me just drop this now. Faith is an atmosphere that is created by the unsealing and fulfillment of prophecy. You remember the scripture a few weeks back that I read to you out of uh Jeremiah chapter 29 where God is saying I know the thoughts that I have toward you &gt;&gt; to bring you to an expected end of peace. Now remember he says in at 70 YEARS I WILL VISIT BABYLON AND CAUSING YOU to return in the fulfillment OF MY PROMISE IN CAUSING YOU TO RETURN BACK TO this land. Now I WANT TO JUST SAY IT TO YOU LIKE THIS. IT WASN'T 70 years that brought the change of atmosphere. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; There you go. &gt;&gt; Cuz listen, listen now. TIME ALONE WILL not change you. &gt;&gt; IF THERE DOESN'T COME A CHANGE IN A PERSON'S LIFE, THEY CAN BE LIKE THIS YOUNG, AND IF THEY DON'T CHANGE, THEY'LL BE LIKE THIS WHEN THEY'RE OLD. &gt;&gt; SEE, THERE'S GOT TO COME A CHANGE. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE WHO CAN SPAN THE BREACH. THERE'S GOT TO BE ONE WHO CAN MAKE UP THE GAP. &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHO ALONE CAN DO THAT BUT GOD HIMSELF. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO HERE WITHIN THAT IT'S NOT JUST TIME BUT IT IS GOD FULFILLING HIS WORD. REMEMBER DANIEL IN THE BOOK OF DANIEL SAID I UNDERSTOOD BY THE BOOKS. THIS IS THE TIME. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HE READING? JEREMIAH'S WRITINGS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT ISN'T SOMETHING THAT HE HAD JUST GOT OFF THE SHELF AND BLEW THE DUST OFF OF. &gt;&gt; HE HAD BEEN IN THAT WORD. &gt;&gt; BUT THIS MOMENT, THIS SEASON, THIS TIME, IT WAS DIFFERENT. THERE WAS AN ANOINTING UPON THAT WORD [screaming] THAT CAUSED HIM TO SAY, "WHAT WILL BE IS NOW UPON US." [cheering] &gt;&gt; LISTEN NOW. THE CHANGE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE MINISTRY OF THAT WORD IN SEASON, OUT OF SEASON, IT HAD AN EFFECT. &gt;&gt; LET ME JUST drop this in. I had met with a brother years years ago. You know, he wanted to sit down with me and go over uh with the opening of the seventh seal and latter reign and things like that and wanted me to kind of help him with study. And so we had we had met, you know, this is probably now about 19 years ago, 18 years ago. And we sat down and I began to deal with just things, you know, with the gifts and all those things and going through the things, you know, where brother Brandham had taken us by scripture. And I, you know, had sent him a lot and then we got together and went through those things. And I begin TO POINT OUT THAT WITH THAT OF THE latter rain, it's not something we're looking forward to. But the latter rain is what is falling even now. &gt;&gt; Because the latter rain is the maturing rain. IT'S THE QUICKENING RAIN. IT'S WHAT BRINGS THE GRAIN TO HARVEST. &gt;&gt; And and what was incredible, I'LL NEVER FORGET WHAT THE BROTHER TOLD ME AT THAT TIME. HE SAID, "BROTHER SAMUEL," he said, "now I understand." He said, "Because every time," he said that in in our church, he said, "When that was mentioned or put out THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S COMING BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, many are looking for, oh, when the when, you know, when the thunders are open and WHEN THIS HAPPENS, MAN, THERE'S going to be a great dynamic thing." That's not it. This is not a PUBLIC SHOW. AMEN. &gt;&gt; GOD'S NOT GOING TO REPRODUCE ISUZA STREET. &gt;&gt; ISUZA STREET SERVED ITS PURPOSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND AND THE LIFE PASSED ON THROUGH THAT SHUCK. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING POINT THAT THIS BROTHER MADE TO ME. HE SAYS, "NOW I UNDERSTAND." HE SAID IT WAS WHEN THAT WAS PUT OFF AS SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE. HE SAID, "YOU COULD FEEL A DEPRESSION COME OVER THE CONGREGATION." IT WASN'T THAT THE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT TO BELIEVE. BUT REMEMBER, THEY CAN LIVE NO HIGHER THAN WHAT'S BEING MINISTERED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID THERE HAS TO BE. HE SAID EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE AN ABSOLUTE. OH, HE SAID HOW WE NEED A MAN THAT HAS AN ABSOLUTE OF GOD'S [screaming] WORD AND HOLD THAT ABOVE THAT CONGREGATION TILL EVERYONE RISES. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT A MAN'S IDEA. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE ABSOLUTE OF GOD'S WORD. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HEY, WE'VE GOT THE EVIDENCE. &gt;&gt; THE EVIDENCE NOT JUST OF A BODY CHANGE, BUT THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE FREE. &gt;&gt; THE EVIDENCE THAT THE HOLY GHOST IS FOR YOU. THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU'RE HEALED. HOW? WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE? THE EVIDENCE IS HIM. [cheering] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So the breaking of that begins to break back the clouds. &gt;&gt; Did it stir everybody at once in Babylon? NO. MATTER OF FACT, DID it stir everybody? NO. &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOME who never left Babylon. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But there were those who were part of that first season &gt;&gt; to go back and rebuild the temple. and and and IT WASN'T THAT THE SECOND ONE'S COMING ON. It wasn't that they were somehow lacking, BUT IT WAS GOD HAS EVERYTHING IN SEASON. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT HAVE DONE? LISTEN TO ME NOW. &gt;&gt; This was very important for a church, very important for your family, VERY IMPORTANT FOR DISCIPLING. WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO TO HAVE EVERYBODY AT ONCE IF this part wasn't made ready to sustain what was coming on? Right &gt;&gt; now, I'm not only talking ABOUT THAT WITH THE CHURCH, BUT I'M TALKING ABOUT IT WITH INDIVIDUALS LIVES WHEN WE'RE DEALING WHEN I'M working with hearts, WORKING WITH LIVES. THIS IS WHY THAT WE JUST DON'T SAY GET THE HOLY GHOST. GET THE HOLY I KNOW THAT, BUT REMEMBER THE PROPHET TELLS US HE WON'T COME IN AN UNFIT TEMPLE. SO I NEED WITH THAT PROMISE IN MIND UH COMING ALONGSIDE AND BUILDING THEIR FAITH AND INVITING LIKE AND NOT ADMONISHING THEM. INVITE GOD INTO YOUR MUSIC. INVITE GOD INTO YOUR CLOTHING. INVITE GOD INTO THIS RIGHT HERE. AND YOU INVITE GOD. GOD PREPARES THE TEMPLE FOR HIMSELF TO COME AND DWELL IN. &gt;&gt; ARE you hearing me? &gt;&gt; AND IF WE'RE NOT CAREFUL, IT'S LIKE WE'RE TRYING TO HURT. GOD'S PEOPLE ARE not &gt;&gt; herdsmen. shepherds, &gt;&gt; you lead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; We lead, not push, not shove. &gt;&gt; Sometimes that can be out of frustration. &gt;&gt; We're wanting to see something happen. YOU DON'T KNOW. You do not know what's happening inside of that person's heart. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes you can make the wrong judgments. If you had been there when Abraham and Sarah, you would have called Sarah an unbeliever. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT BROTHER, SOMETHING HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE, DON'T CLOUD THE ATMOSPHERE. &gt;&gt; DON'T EVEN LOOK AT THE ATMOSPHERE YOU SEE AROUND YOUR LOVED ONES OR ANOTHER [screaming] BELIEVER. AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, YOU'RE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING, YOU'RE A BELIEVER. &gt;&gt; I'M NOT GOING TO CLOUD THE ATMOSPHERE. NOT GOING TO UNDO WHAT THE WORD IS TRYING TO DO. LET THE WORD DO WHAT THE WORD DOES. [applause and cheering] GOD DON'T NEED THE HELP OF SIRI. I [screaming] &gt;&gt; got in the way. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T NEED ANY OTHER WAY ENGINEERED. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; My goodness. God had a reason when he when he came upon this earth in the beginning to break back the clouds. Choice is such a great thing, you know, because God never within the sovereignty of God and his elective grace. God never removed choice. &gt;&gt; Every person has a choice. &gt;&gt; So there's a beautiful, beautiful way that election, the sovereignty of God works with choice. God knew the end from the beginning. &gt;&gt; This is why in the book of Ecclesiastes, it says that those things which are have been. &gt;&gt; So, &gt;&gt; see, it's not something that's just for you and I. We're coming to learn or to see or to understand. But God already knows. &gt;&gt; He's omniscent. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you with me? He's omnistant. He's all knowing. So, it isn't God looking down through a crop of humanity like picking a kickball team. I choose you. &gt;&gt; Let me see here. Choose you. I choose you. I choose you. Come on. We We've all been there. &gt;&gt; There was some games when I got picked, you know, when I was in elementary school. I got picked right away. I I got kicked pretty far. I could catch pretty good. But if you wanted to pick somebody to run relay races, I was last. [laughter] You know why? I wasn't good at it. I say that so that you understand God's choosing is not about how good you are. &gt;&gt; AS A MATTER OF FACT, ESAU WAS A MUCH BETTER MAN than Jacob. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ABOUT HOW GOOD YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS AND YOU SAY, "WHAT IS THAT CHOOSING? WHAT IS THAT?" GOD LOOKED DOWN ALL THE WAY, SAW THE END FROM THE BEGINNING, AND HE SAW WHAT YOU WOULD DO WHEN THE WORD WOULD COME ACROSS YOUR PATH. HOW DOES GOD KNOW THAT? BECAUSE HOW DOES HE respond to his own word? &gt;&gt; WE ARE A PART. WE'RE ALWAYS A PART OF GOD. AMEN. &gt;&gt; MY BOYS, THE THREE BOYS, WELL, ZACH'S NOT HERE THIS MORNING. THEY WERE IN ME THE WHOLE TIME. &gt;&gt; They were in me. IT'S NATURAL. EVEN AS THEY TAKE ON CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS AND WHATEVER MORE, NO MATTER HOW MUCH THEY SAY, "NOT going to do this. Not going TO DO THAT. JUST GIVE IT A FEW YEARS." [laughter] THAT'S WHY I CATCH HIM WEARING my shoes around the house now and I say [laughter] just wait a FEW YEARS TILL YOU GET THAT REVELATION. THREE PAIRS OF COMFORTABLE SHOES IS BETTER THAN 10 pair that you can't stand in. [laughter] Oh, we have a good time. BOY, JUST WAIT. YOU SEE WHAT IT IS? I AND THEY THEY'VE COME OUT. THEY COME OUT OF ME. I KNOW THERE'S CHARACTERISTICS. I KNOW THE STRAINS. I KNOW THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BATTLE. And yeah, they've got HDR mixed in there. God bless their hearts and we pray for them all the time and SO FORTH. BUT YOU KNOW, ALL OF THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT I'M SAYING IS INSIDE OF YOUR LIFE, IT WAS ALWAYS TO BE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE THE DUCK &gt;&gt; THAT was born &gt;&gt; and he walked around with the chickens. &gt;&gt; Come on. This is the testimony story, TOO. ONE DAY HE GOT A SCENT OF WATER. SPRINGTIME HIT AND HE GOT A SCENT OF WATER. BUDDY, HE NEVER WAS IN THE CHICKEN PIN AGAIN. &gt;&gt; HE WENT TO THE WATER. WHAT WAS IT? THE SCENT OF WATER. IT AROUSED WHAT [screaming] WAS IN HIM. &gt;&gt; HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THAT WATER. HE WAS BORN FOR THAT WATER. &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL [screaming] YOU, YOU WERE BORN FOR THIS WORD. choice is a great thing. &gt;&gt; You see now look I God our we have our own free moral agency. &gt;&gt; Free moral agency. &gt;&gt; Just let me tell you like this. Just because somebody has made a choice right now. That ain't you can't define that and say, "Well, they've already made their choice and they're going to you don't know that." &gt;&gt; That's right, &gt;&gt; friends. I have watched God restore lives that have been gone for years. That's right. &gt;&gt; Out of sight. &gt;&gt; You see, you can't and and you don't want to you don't NEED TO EVEN WORRY ABOUT WRITING anybody off. &gt;&gt; You don't want to do that anyhow. &gt;&gt; YOU LEAVE IT IN GOD'S HANDS. &gt;&gt; Listen to me now. THIS IS WHY WHEN THE PROPHET'S TALKING ABOUT with free moral agency, he said, YOU KNOW, I'M A FREE moral agent. If I want life, I can have it. If I want to refuse it, I'm a free moral agent. I can take the devil then but if I want God I can take God and that's before every person that ever come on this earth. Now he says you know it's not by my mental conceptions he said but what is it? It took the Holy Spirit to bring me from the earth. And if the Holy Spirit made me what I am without having any choice, how much more can he bring me back out of the dust of the earth &gt;&gt; by choice? not my intellectuals, not my church membership, but by the Holy Ghost that's brooding down and calling to me, I'll answer back to it. And he raised his hands and swore that he raised me up in the last days. Oh, brother, intellectual will never do it. Mental conception will never do it. It's the work of the Holy Spirit that brings the human being to his place. Make your choice. Oh, happy day. I fix my choice on thee, my savior and my God. No matter what the rest of the world does, it's sinking sand. My choice is on thee. &gt;&gt; Do you see? Choice is A GREAT THING. YOU'VE GOT A CHOICE SITTING HERE THIS MORNING. YOU KNOW, YOU HAD A CHOICE ON whether you were going to come to church. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; You had A CHOICE. YOU HAD A CHOICE WHEN YOU CAME IN HERE IF YOU WERE GOING TO be a worshshiper. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YOU HAD A CHOICE IF YOU WERE GOING TO ENTER IN AND GET INTO THE WORD AND SAY, "GOD, SPEAK TO MY HEART." YOU HAD A CHOICE. THESE ARE ALL CHOICES. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE A CHOICE WHEN YOU LEAVE OUT OF HERE. AND you know, MAYBE WHATEVER TIME YOU LEAVE, YOU'LL HAVE A CHOICE WHERE WHAT YOU DO THE REST OF THE DAY. IT WILL ALL BE CHOICES. &gt;&gt; You might say, "Well, there's plans already laid out." But you'll choose whether or not how long you do those plans or even if you go through with them. &gt;&gt; You still have choice. &gt;&gt; Choice is a great thing. And choice does not remove that free is not does not remove the election of God. BUT GOD KNOWS AND SEES WHAT choice that you're going to make and he puts that before you. In other words, brother Ram SAYS IT LIKE THIS. GOD DON'T MAKE ANYBODY serve him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; NOBODY. IT'S A CHOICE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. JESUS SAID, "IF YOU LOVE ME, keep my commandments." That's right. &gt;&gt; You see, the reason he WOULD EVEN SHOW HIS WORD is because he loves you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The rich young ruler didn't see it that way. HE SAW IT AS I can't do this. That wasn't what the commandment was about. IT WAS GOD'S LOVE. &gt;&gt; GOD'S LOVE WAS UNFOLDING TO HIM. THIS IS WHAT'S KEEPING you back because it's something you value more than eternal life. Yet, you're here asking for it, but you're valuing your own possessions. &gt;&gt; It was a choice, &gt;&gt; right? It was a choice. So choice, it took the Holy Spirit. You and I did not choose. I mean, we didn't choose, you know, uh, how our nose is going to look and we didn't choose what parents were going to come through. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Let me just say it like this. You didn't even choose what the act was, whether it was the act inside of marriage or it was under maybe adultery or fornication. You didn't even choose that. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. &gt;&gt; Come on. We don't need to preach the blood takes care of it all. &gt;&gt; It does. &gt;&gt; But you didn't even get to choose that. You didn't get to choose who your parents were. &gt;&gt; Your parents didn't even choose you. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Boom. &gt;&gt; YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T EVEN, YOU KNOW, YOUR PARENTS DIDN'T TAKE YOU AND, YOU KNOW, LIKE A MR. POTATO HEAD. I like this nose. I like this ear. AND I YOU'RE NOT, IT'S NOT YOUR CHOICE. &gt;&gt; You know, parents, I hope he acts like you. I hope he has this like you. I hope he I hope he Okay. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; YOU DIDN'T GET TO MAKE THAT CHOICE. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. And if you DIDN'T GET TO MAKE THAT CHOICE, THE HOLY SPIRIT IS WHAT BROUGHT YOU FORTH IN THAT WAY, THEN HOW MUCH MORE WHEN YOU'RE PRESENTED WITH THE CHOICE THAT YOU MAKE A CHOICE TO surrender and yield to his working, &gt;&gt; how much more will he not bring you out? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch this. Brother Brandham goes on to say, "The Holy Spirit that's moving down through his word is and saying, "This is my word. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the MOUTH OF GOD." YES, HOLY SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; I promise eternal life to THEM THAT BELIEVE. I BELIEVE, HOLY SPIRIT, I'LL SEAL YOU. THEN WATCH your life begin to move. &gt;&gt; Not the church, THE HOLY SPIRIT. NOT THE DENOMINATION, THE HOLY SPIRIT. SO IT'S RESPOND. IT'S YIELDING TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; IT'S YIELDING IN FAITH TO THE WORD. YES, I BELIEVE IT. WHAT GOD IS SAYING, "YES, LORD, I RECEIVE IT. YES, I BELIEVE IT." AND THEN watching our life being moved by him. &gt;&gt; Let me just say it. The same one moving your life is the same one that moves with uncction for things to be said how they're said. &gt;&gt; It's the same Holy Spirit that moved on the prophets. He's the same Holy Spirit here this morning. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, this is why when you know David could write about how marvelous God's thoughts were toward him, he said in Psalms 139, "Oh Lord, thou hast searched me and known me. Thou knowest my downsitting and my uprising. Thou understandest my thought afar. Thou comp thou compasseth my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways." Verse 17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, oh God. How great is the sum of them. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand. And when I awake, I am still with thee. In Psalms 139, going back up to verse 13, for thou hast possessed my reigns. Thou hast covered me in my mother's womb. I will praise thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Marvelous are thy works, and thy and my soul knoweth right well. MY SUBSTANCE WAS NOT HID from thee, WHEN I WAS MADE in secret, and curiously wrought IN THE LOWEST PARTS OF THE EARTH. THINE EYES did see my substance, yet being unperfect. AND IN THY BOOK ALL MY MEMBERS were written, which in continuence were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them. &gt;&gt; David is writing about the book of life. &gt;&gt; David under inspiration is aware. God, you have known all about me. &gt;&gt; You are able to look and you are able to see. You know me and you also know all the downsitting, all the upright. In other words, you know the temperament that you set in my life. &gt;&gt; You know the temperament is also an opportunity for overcoming. &gt;&gt; Your temperament can be a great thing, but it can also be a hindrance. &gt;&gt; The prophet, it was revealed to the prophet about his melancholy. He had to shoot them eye and the squirrels through the eye. But he was crying about it because something was off. &gt;&gt; But see, then the Holy Spirit came to him and said, "I made you that way for a purpose." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because why? To stand. And brother Bram caught it. It was to stand and see the word hit hit dead on with a bull's eye. &gt;&gt; I've made you that way for a purpose. Ain't it incredible how God will even bring together? I think of it even in marriages. I think how God works such in a in a tremendous way. And we look at that and we we look down in the temperament. Oh, the old temperament. REMEMBER THE PROPHET TELLS US that what it is. He said the Holy Spirit is that will that sits down in the middle OF THE WHEEL. HE SETS DOWN IN THE MIDDLE. HE SAID OF YOUR TEMPERAMENT. &gt;&gt; God needed Paul to be a chloric. &gt;&gt; We're going through. &gt;&gt; HE NEEDED A MAN WITH VISION, A MAN THAT WOULD stand unrelenting. And remember, God also seen the weakness in that strength. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO GOD KNOWS ABOUT ALL OF THAT. GOD KNOWS ABOUT GOD KNOW LOOK AT LOOK GOD KNEW ABOUT EVERY TRIAL. GOD, YOU UNDERSTAND FRIENDS, THERE IS NO WAY FOR YOU AND I TO COME INTO PERFECTION. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT IF YOUR SOUL THAT COMES THROUGH THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. I'M TALKING ABOUT INTO MATURITY. THERE'S NO WAY TO COME TO MATURITY WITHOUT THE TEST AND TRIALS. AND THE WORD IS SENT TO ENCOURAGE YOU AND I. &gt;&gt; AND REMIND US WHO WE ARE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO OTHER WAY. THAT'S HOW CHARACTER IS MADE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; This body CAME FORTH THROUGH HIM BY A SEXUAL ACT. BUT THAT WHEN WE WHEN WE GO AND PASS INTO THE RAPTURE AND I KNOW HAVING YOU KNOW GOING INTO THE THEOPHONY BUT THAT GLORIFIED BODY IS NOT GOING TO COME IS NOT GOING TO BE A SIMPLE REPLACEMENT. IT'S GOING TO BE A RESURRECTION AND THAT FROM THE VERY MIND OF GOD IT WILL BE COMPLIMENTARY. IT WILL NOT BE WHAT HAS COME THROUGH JAMES AND PAT BROWNING. IT WILL BE WHAT HAS COME FORTH ACCORDING TO GOD'S ORIGINAL WORD. IT WILL NOT HAVE THE COMPLEXES IN IT. IT WILL NOT HAVE THE WEAKNESSES IN IT. IT WILL BE FREE FROM ALL OF THAT BECAUSE IT'S COMING STRAIGHT FROM GOD. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO, I want you just to think of that God had it all written here &gt;&gt; right in his right in his book, the book of life. Like you have a family album. YOU HAVE PICTURES OF YOUR kids when they're born. &gt;&gt; God had pictures of you and his family album before you were ever born in this earth. &gt;&gt; HIS FAMILY ALBUM WAS ALREADY MADE UP. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THE BIBLE TELLS US IN REVELATIONS 13 that there were those WHO WILL NOT WORSHIP THAT OF THE BEAST, WILL NOT BE ENTER INTO HIS SYSTEM. They they they THEY HAVE THEIR NAMES WRITTEN IN THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? GOD ALREADY MADE UP HIS FAMILY ALBUM. &gt;&gt; And you KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? IF HE'S ALREADY MADE UP HIS FAMILY ALBUM, THERE HAD TO BE something positive to take a picture of. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE ALREADY TOOK A PICTURE OF YOUR REPRESENTATION BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; THIS IS WHO YOU ARE. THIS IS WHY THE WORD ITSELF, THAT PHOTO ALBUM, THAT FAMILY ALBUM IS NOT SOMETHING WAY OUT THERE. THAT FAMILY ALBUM IS THE WORD OF GOD BEING REVEALED. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, GOD'S NOT JUST MAKING KNOWN HIS THOUGHTS ABOUT YOU. You are his thoughts. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE HIS WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THAT'S WHY WHEN THE WORD IS CALLING FOR THE CHARACTERISTIC OF CHRIST IN THIS HOUR, THAT'S WHY A METHODIST MESSAGE WILL NEVER TAKE AN EFFECT ON YOU. A PRESBYTERIAN, A BAPTIST, A PENTECOSTAL, IT CANNOT BRING FORTH OUT OF [screaming] YOUR LIFE WHAT CHRIST CAN IN THIS SEASON. [cheering] &gt;&gt; They had their part. They lived out their word. They lived out their season. Now it's bride time. Right? &gt;&gt; You have to recognize your day and its message. &gt;&gt; Is that right? So here before, think of the word before you were a gene in your father. &gt;&gt; As we said before, you didn't know about it, but God made a bedding ground to take you out of your mother. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So then you could have fellowship with your father. The ram says the life that you've come in now, the natural life, physical life that was by your father and the way you can come born again, the only way it has to be from your heavenly father, his attributes. &gt;&gt; All the father has given me will come to me. You are here because your name was placed on the Lamb's book of life before there was even a foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; You're a gene, a spiritual gene out of your heavenly father, a part of God's word. You said, I've said it. I've said it before. You was with Jesus when he was here because he was the word. YOU SUFFERED WITH HIM, DIED WITH HIM, buried with him, rose with him, and now you're sitting in heavenly places with him. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Remember, before &gt;&gt; God told Jeremiah that before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee. &gt;&gt; AND BEFORE thou camest out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and ordained thee to be a prophet unto the nations. The prophet said you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute &gt;&gt; that was IN GOD. THAT THOUGHT of you and expressed you and he made an earth to take you out of and to make you a human being. &gt;&gt; Sin come along and perverted his way. You come anyhow, but you was lost with the world. So he come and redeemed you the expressed attribute. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram goes on and who is this Melazdc? And he says now he says I want you to think about it. You were in him his attributes in the beginning. This is when the book of life comes into view. And he refers to Revelations 13. I already referenced the of the beast that comes upon the earth will deceive all those people on the earth whose names were not written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. And he speaks, he says, think of it. Jesus before he was ever born, 4,000 years before he came on earth and several thousand years before you came on earth, Jesus in God's mind died for the sins of the world. and the book of life was made and your name was put on the the book of life before the foundation of the world. He said that's the Bible truth. Your name was ordained of God and placed on the book of life before the foundation of the world. You were there in his attributes. You don't remember it. No, because you're just a part of this life. You are a part of God when you become a son and daughter of God. Anybody remember being in your father? That's good. &gt;&gt; Does anybody remember being in your mother? &gt;&gt; Let me ask you. Do you remember the day you were born? &gt;&gt; Some of you don't. You don't know. Is he going to touch my doctrine? I'm asking you a question. Do you remember the day you were born? &gt;&gt; Do you remember the doctor? Do you remember the nurse? Oh, some of you, man. But you know what? Is there any question you've been born? That's right. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU QUESTIONING YOU'VE BEEN BORN? &gt;&gt; You're here. [cheering] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE THE CERTIFICATE, BUT YOU'RE HERE. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO DISPUTING. &gt;&gt; YOU UNDERSTAND, FRIENDS? YOU CAN TRY TO GO. OH, I'M GOING TO GO BACK TO THAT. GO BACK TO THAT MOMENT WHEN DR. BRADICK WAS THERE IN ROCKFORD AND VANWARD HOSPITAL IN VANWARD, OHIO, AND DR. BRAD WITH WHATEVER NURSES that was there at the time, Stella. I don't know who they were, but oh, WHEN THEY WERE THERE, YOU DON'T REMEMBER THAT. BUT YOU KNOW, I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN BORN. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU KNOW WHY? I'M RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW, WALKING [screaming] AND LIVING AS A HUMAN BEING. AND I KNOW I'VE BEEN BORN AGAIN AS A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. MY LIFE'S BEEN CHANGED. I'M WALKING [screaming] IN GOD'S WORD. AND MY SOUL SAYS AMEN TO THE WORD OF GOD. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. PUT THAT THE DEVIL'S NOSE. [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; CUZ I'VE GOT MY CERTIFICATE. MY NAME [screaming] IS ON THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THAT ATTRIBUTE WAS FIRST GOD, the thought. Now, let me just I'm honing in on something here. The attribute was first God, the thought, the attribute itself all in one without being expressed. Then when he expressed secondarily, he became then the word and the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; and dwelt among us. So now just keep that in mind as the Bible takes us regarding in Romans nine and I want to just come through this in Romans in Romans nine and with this on that that attribute remember neither because they are the seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall thy seed be called that is they which are the children of the flesh says these are not the children of God but the children of the promise are counted for the seed. Now you saw that when the Lord Jesus came there were those who were of the flesh &gt;&gt; and then those who were actually of the seed of Abraham the promise &gt;&gt; you're saying what what what was it that made the difference when the word was made flesh &gt;&gt; the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents OF THE HEART THE WORD BROUGHT FORTH THOSE REACTIONS. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; JUST AS MUCH AS THE WORD BROUGHT FORTH THE REACTION WHEREIN THEM THEY SAID YOU'RE BEZEL ELBA. THEY HAD everything religiously down. These were not scallywags. &gt;&gt; These were people as the prophet said you couldn't put your finger on their life. &gt;&gt; They had everything down that Jesus said you're whited supplers. &gt;&gt; Look good on the outside but you're full of dead men's bones. &gt;&gt; Right. BUT JUST AS MUCH AS IT BROUGHT THAT EFFECT on them, I don't want to focus so much on them. WHEN IT BROUGHT THE EFFECT ON THE BELIEVERS, &gt;&gt; IT BROUGHT THE EFFECT ON THE BELIEVERS. It here CAME A MATTHEW. HERE COMES PETER. HERE COMES ANDREW. HERE COMES NATHANIEL. HERE COMES BARTHOLOMEW. HERE COMES THEM. YOU SAY, "YEAH, BUT HERE COMES JUDAS." BUT REMEMBER, JUDAS DEPARTED. &gt;&gt; IT WAS IN HIM ALL [screaming] ALONG. That's right. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME? JUDAS HE WASN'T GOING TO CONTINUE ON WITH THE WORD. BUT THAT'S DIFFERENT WITH YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S DIFFERENT WITH YOU. IT'S NOT YOU TRYING TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT, NOT YOU TRYING TO MAKE SOMETHING FIT, BUT YOU ARE RESPONDING TO THE WORD IN OUR MIDST. AND THAT'S WHAT'S MAKING THAT CREATION IN YOUR HEART. THAT'S WHY THE PROPHET SAID, "WHAT IS THAT THAT'S MAKING YOU FEEL THAT WAY?" 1965 EASTER SEAL. IT'S GOD FULFILLING THE [screaming] WORD FOR THIS DAY. &gt;&gt; HE SAID THERE WERE MANY THAT WAS WALKING IN A PREVIOUS LIFE IN A PREVIOUS DAY. BUT NOW IN THIS TIME, THE PROPHECY [screaming] BEING FULFILLED, IT HAS AN EFFECT UPON THE SEED OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And who are the seed of God? The attributes of God. &gt;&gt; Attributes of God. his thoughts. &gt;&gt; Now watch this. When Rebecca also had conceived by one, let me go back to that minute. I think that's powerful. For this is the word of promise. At this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son. I keep reading through that right there. I keep thinking of that quote I went through and just rehearsed again. I read about I think about that for this word of promise. Sarah who first doubted but now remember it was God who came in. IT WAS GOD who performed the miracle in her life. &gt;&gt; Sarah had nothing to do with it. Oh, I really believed. I REALLY KNOW IT WAS GOD. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO DOUBT SOME OF YOU WERE RUNNING AS FAR AWAY FROM THIS MESSAGE YOU GET, BUT YOU CAN'T OUTRUN THE PLAN OF GOD. &gt;&gt; ALL KINDS OF CHOICES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THROUGH YOUR LIFE. AND THE DEVIL THOUGHT HE COULD SNOW YOU IN, SEAL YOU IN, BUT HE CAN'T KEEP BACK. [screaming] THE WORD FROM COMING INTO MANIFESTATION. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Let me just tell you something. You can be in the awfulst mess. You can have be in the awfulst sin and condition there is. But there is nothing &gt;&gt; that Jesus won't step down &gt;&gt; into a situation and turn that situation around. &gt;&gt; You say, "How do you know?" Because he did it for me. IF THE ANGEL OF THE LORD CAME INTO THIS PIG PIN, &gt;&gt; I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN MY PIG PIN. &gt;&gt; HE CAME TO ME THERE. &gt;&gt; OH MY. &gt;&gt; GOD CAME TO THE WOMAN IN THE WELL AT THE WELL IN THE CONDITION SHE WAS IN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; He had an appointment. &gt;&gt; That was before Google calendar, too. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Notice, and not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by her father Isaac, for the children being not yet born, neither having done good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, &gt;&gt; not of works, but of him that calleth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It was said unto her, the elder shall serve the younger. It's written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated. Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate, them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, this is specific calling. what I just read here on this verse and what I read here, this is specific calling. You've got to keep your word balanced because you can say, "Well, many are called, few are chosen." But you've got to keep the choosing what God is saying in the word when where he's talking about this calling that's taking place here. &gt;&gt; You're receiving a specific call. It's not you going along with the rest, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD DEALING WITH YOUR LIFE PERSONALLY. I know we went along with mom and dad. went along WITH OTHERS. YOU MIGHT HAVE WENT ALONG, BUT ONE DAY &gt;&gt; IT GOT PERSONAL. &gt;&gt; ONE DAY THE WORD GOT PERSONAL in your life. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS IT? IT'S GOD MAKING A PERSONAL CALL. &gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT LIKE ON YOUR CELL PHONE WHERE THEY SEND OUT AN ALERT AND YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF CHURCH. YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUPERMARKET. AMBER ALERT. AMBER ALERT. AMBER ALERT. YELLOW CAR WITH THIS LICENSE PLATE. [screaming] SUCH AND SUCH HAS HAPPENED. AND EVERYBODY GETS it &gt;&gt; except if you turn them off. &gt;&gt; This is different. &gt;&gt; YES, THE CALL GOES OUT. IT GOES OUT TO ALL. BUT IT'S SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT REGISTERS WITH YOUR DEVICE. &gt;&gt; IT REGISTERS IN YOUR life &gt;&gt; to do what? Bring you into rest. And rest &gt;&gt; is your position. So how does God call us? He calls us by his word. He calls us by his word. This is why Jesus said, "The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit and they are life." He says in verse 65, "No man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father." &gt;&gt; Can I have just a couple more moments? Let me just drop this drop this bring this down of the attributes of the thought and of the word and I want to just just deal with this just a moment. The prophet takes this all through the message, but the message the future home. I've been combing through that here the past past while. And it just so struck my heart how the prophet because I remember just from studies on the gifts and things like that, brother Bran will take this message in the future home. And he's picking up things that he's already taught all along. And he makes he makes the declaration about how that there is something much different with he says a prophecy and an interpretation and he's talking about discernment. Remember when brother Brandham he he he he he told them he says look the same thing that prophecy is not something to come by a person's feeling &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; oh I feel this is something that needs to be said that's why brother Brandham could say even regarding interpretations question answers God being misunderstood multiple ones where he goes through that and we took a whole service on that and he deals with how he says many times interpretations what it is what's wrong is because people give an interpretation based on what they feel the spirit is wanting to say. &gt;&gt; This is very important. See that it not limited. Just follow me here within this. So when brother Brandham comes into future home, he's bringing this back up and he says, "Look," he says, "the one who stands there in that discernment like you see on the platform and and you're from so and so and this and this and that." The prophet says that's how specific that prophecy &gt;&gt; in the church within one of the nine spiritual gifts is to be &gt;&gt; right now. Brother Bram says within that he says it will now here's what he says he'll give three three qualifiers. He says it will call out somebody specifically by name &gt;&gt; tell them what to do and what to avoid. Or he says it's something that's spoken and the person or persons there know it's to them and it hasn't called their name &gt;&gt; you know out publicly. &gt;&gt; So so what it is it becomes known between them and God. So discernment and prophecy is not the ideas of man. &gt;&gt; It's not the impressions. &gt;&gt; It's not spiritual impressions but it's God at work. Now listen. That's the same way it comes down within our lives when the word of God is coming straight from God's thoughts. Listen now, brother Bram says this in future home. The world, this earth is one of his attributes the same as you're one of his attributes. The world become one of his attributes because it's God's thinking in the beginning to have a world, to be on a throne, to be a king, to be a redeemer, to be a healer. That's his attributes. Just like an attribute of you, he said, I can say I can't say post lest I think of a post. I can't say man unless I think of man. And when I think of man, then I say man. The thinking is my attribute and the expression is THE WORD. LIKE ISAIAH, HOW COULD HE say a virgin was going to conceive? He said, ' See, many of you wondering how that discernment comes. I'm going to tell you. IT'S A WORD THAT I SAY AND IT ISN'T MY THINKING CUZ I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW OF THE THINKING OF IT. HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHO YOU ARE, WHERE YOU COME FROM WHEN I DON'T KNOW YOU? HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHAT YOU DID 10 YEARS AGO WHEN I NEVER SEEN YOU IN YOUR LIFE, IN MY LIFE? HOW CAN I TELL YOU WHERE WHAT YOU'LL DO? AND WHERE YOU'LL BE 10 YEARS FROM NOW. HOW DO I KNOW THE FUTURE? BUT IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S THOUGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU SEE WHAT HE'S GETTING TO RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; THIS THIS MESSAGE IS NOT MY THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS NOT WILLIAM BRANDHAM'S [screaming] THINKING. &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS GOD'S THOUGHTS. [cheering] &gt;&gt; THUS SAITH THE LORD. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; IT'S GOD'S ATTRIBUTES, THE NOW HIS WORD BEING EXPRESSED. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY LISTEN, YOU'RE NOT BEING CALLED BY A MAN. YOU'RE NOT CALLED BY A CHURCH. &gt;&gt; OH, brother Samuel, so and so witnessed to me. WHATEVER MORE GOD MIGHT HAVE USED A vessel &gt;&gt; and you might look and say, "That vessel is not even serving God anymore." The prophet clears that up. See, his need is not with a shock. He said, "Sometimes there's people that have the real truth. They're just carriers of it." &gt;&gt; True. And they've been they've been used as witnesses to and here they are they've disp HOW HOW THINK ABOUT THAT IN AFRICA when all those threw the books away all those things. Brother Samson Tay speaking of that how the trash cans were filled and everything else but when those trash cans were filled ain't it incredible God seen to it that WHERE THOSE BOOKS WERE AT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO PICKED THEM UP IN THE FILLING STATIONS [cheering] &gt;&gt; WHAT NOBODY ELSE WANTED. &gt;&gt; THERE WERE [screaming] PEOPLE WHO WANTED IT. THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY were after, but it was God guiding and directing them right into the place. &gt;&gt; SEE, IT'S BY NO THE DISCERNMENT. IT'S NOT MY THINKING. SO, WHAT YOU SEE HAPPENING ON THE PLATFORM, THAT'S THE SAME THING THAT'S HAPPENING BY THE WORD OF GOD AS IT'S BEING REVEALED. IT'S NOT US THINKING OF A POST. IT'S NOT US THINKING OF A MAN. IT'S GOD HIMSELF, HIS THOUGHTS, WHAT HE THINKS OF YOU, AND THAT'S WHAT HE'S EXPRESSING. Let that mind that was in Christ be IN YOU. LET THAT MIND THAT WAS IN CHRIST BE IN YOU. SEE, IT'S NOT YOUR THINKING. &gt;&gt; It's his thinking through you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not expressing your own words. You're expressing &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; His words. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As many as received him, &gt;&gt; to them gave he the power, the rights to become the sons of God. &gt;&gt; You have the right. You have now a right that's been ministered to you. And that right itself, as you yield to that right, it'll take you to the power &gt;&gt; to the authority that makes an expressed son of God. &gt;&gt; I say, Lord, I want to yield. &gt;&gt; I want to yield. &gt;&gt; I want to I want to keep yielding. I don't want to Listen, there's no time to conflict with your thoughts. Listen, it's a time to doubt your doubts and believe God's word. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; This word is more real than the thoughts you have of your own self. &gt;&gt; THESE THOUGHTS RIGHT HERE, THESE THOUGHTS RIGHT HERE IS THE VERY THING THAT'LL DISPEL AND BREAK THOUGHTS. AND THESE ARE THE THOUGHTS. THIS WORD IS WHAT WILL BRING A NEW BIRTH. &gt;&gt; IT'S WHAT BRINGS DELIVERANCE. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A WORD THAT IS DROPPED FROM ETERNITY DOWN INTO TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. JESUS SAID, "NO MAN CAN COME UNTO ME EXCEPT THE FATHER WHICH HATH SENT ME. DRAW him and I will raise him up at the last day. If I be lifted up from the earth, speaking of his crucifixion, I will draw all men unto me. You see, he's drawing. &gt;&gt; I know it's a sad thing where the word when we hear the message indictment and how that the word was crucified. But do you realize the prophet goes on to say if you read further in that message he said now that word he said up to that time at Calvary that word had not come into effect &gt;&gt; but when that happened at Calvary he's talking about back at Calvary then the word came into effect and he said now this word that's been here all these years now talking about IN HIS MINISTRY NOW that it's been rejected now that it's been crucified now it's coming into effect Amen. &gt;&gt; SEE, THE WORD HAD TO BE REJECTED. IT HAD TO BE CRUCIFIED. &gt;&gt; You and I are benefactors &gt;&gt; of this life. &gt;&gt; It's now, as the prophet said, it has now recently come into effect. &gt;&gt; No man cometh unto the father but by me. Let me close on this one. Everybody in here has a I'd say probably everybody maybe everybody doesn't. I understand cell phone. Most of us still have radios in our car. I think it's like somebody the other day wanted to give me a CD. They a brother sent me a thing about my daughters have just put out this CD. You want to order them for your library? I thought I don't even have CD players. [laughter] I don't have them. I don't have them. Is it on Apple Music? [laughter] I mean, uh, you know, we I could have really joshed him and teased him, but I didn't. I I was good. I was good. But, you know, within it, I mean, the the CDs, what I'm trying to say is is that even within it comes to the cell phones and the radio, there's a signal that goes out, &gt;&gt; TV, all those things, the wireless, it goes out. But there's got to be something to receive the signal &gt;&gt; that's being transmitted. &gt;&gt; See, those signals are being transmitted all around. I mean, you know, sometimes I hear people say, "Oh, Wi-Fi, it's making me feel this way and this, you know, and they're making fun of people. I just, you know, sometimes I just Anyhow, I I just, you know, there's certain things about signals and this and there's signals all through this room. It's amazing how many signals. It is absolutely amazing how many signals. I mean, think about all the &gt;&gt; the Wi-Fi signals right here cuz your phone's still on. You might have put it on, turned it off. I mean, as far as vibrating this right here, &gt;&gt; it's a signal that's being sent to a little box over there. And then that box carries a wire underneath and all the way back over there. But you don't see anything between here and there. &gt;&gt; But one thing about it, if something goes wrong, you'll know, hey, hey, hey, somebody needs to get him a microphone. Somebody needs to get him a microphone. I can't hear. I need again microphone. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But you don't see it, but you know it's happening. &gt;&gt; And this is why the prophet would speak about when the word was made flesh and when the word is made flesh, he says it like this. He was that transmitter. &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has an eternal life. Verily I say unto you, he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life. Now let me ask you something. That word has been went out from a transmitter. What part of that in there did it ask you to do something other than believe. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Believe the signal that's being transmitted. &gt;&gt; Watch this. IF YOU CAN JUST BE THE STATION TO PICK that up BY SOME CONTROL INSIDE OF you by faith, it'll move you right into the cycle of God to the new birth and be born again. &gt;&gt; PICK IT up and it'll move you. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [laughter] &gt;&gt; ALL I GOT TO DO IS GET DIALED IN &gt;&gt; AND IT'LL MOVE YOU INTO THE CYCLE OF GOD RIGHT INTO THE new birth. But in there in the new birth, notice the privilege is always that warning, that little buzzer. Then you'll always have that buzzer, that that contact that's there to warn you, guide you, direct you. Why? Because his spirit of truth is sent to lead and guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; What's happening? It's God fulfilling his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it that's making that creation inside of you? It's God fulfilling that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen friends, even for every one of us that here, I believe God wants to take every heart deeper. God wants to take us deeper. It's a control. It's taking wanting to take us deeper. And there's things that if you can just recognize that it's him. &gt;&gt; It's what he started IN YOUR LIFE. AND YOU AND you continue to yield to him. Brother Samuel, if I can just get rid of this, if I can just get rid of this, you you have to believe his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you have when you believe his word, you start fellowshipping with his word. You're inviting THE WORD OF GOD INTO YOUR LIFE BECAUSE IT'S THE WORD THAT WILL KILL SIN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WORD THAT'LL BUILD FAITH. THE WORD, LISTEN, THAT'S WHAT CHANGES THE atmosphere &gt;&gt; around your life. &gt;&gt; It's the word of God. &gt;&gt; And it will move you into the cycle of the new birth. What do I have to do, brother? yield. &gt;&gt; You yield &gt;&gt; to God's desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Samuel was told to go down to the house of Jesse, I want you to listen now. When he came to Jesse's house, I want you to watch this announcement. Samuel comes there and he says to the Lord before going, "How can I get down there and anoint David?" &gt;&gt; He didn't even know it was David. How do I get down there and anoint one of his sons? How do I do that? And you know what God said? Take a sacrifice. &gt;&gt; You know what this You know what that was? That was God. How God was going to come and anoint you and I &gt;&gt; through a sacrifice. When Samuel came to the house, he said, "I'm come peaceibly." [laughter] &gt;&gt; HE COME TO OFFER A SACRIFICE. BUT WITHIN THE SACRIFICE, there was a mystery. &gt;&gt; There was an event that was to take place. &gt;&gt; It would be a secret anointing. &gt;&gt; There you go. But it would be openly manifest. &gt;&gt; It would not be a public show, but it would show itself publicly later. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? [applause] &gt;&gt; IT WOULD START OUT IN INFASY AND THROUGH THAT ANOINTING, IT would bring forth a maturity. &gt;&gt; WHAT WOULD IT DO? IT WOULD IT WOULD BRING FORTH THE KING THAT WAS anointed on the inside till he sits on the throne. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I HAVE BEEN ANOINTED AND REVELATIONS 3 SAID we shall sit with him in HIS THRONE. SO THE ANOINTING IS WHAT MAKES YOU AWARE WHO YOU ARE AND BRINGS YOU INTO YOUR PLACE. And then it's Christ maturing, moving in your life to bring you into that position. &gt;&gt; Here's here's Samuel. He's ready. Remember, here's a prophet. He's going with the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; He's going with one of God's attributes. I'm going to anoint one of Jesse's sons. And when he sees the first one come, this guy's a great strapping guy. &gt;&gt; He looks perfect, man. And Samuel went, &gt;&gt; God said, "Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; NO, DON'T ANOINT HIM. &gt;&gt; I've not chosen him." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THEY BROUGHT THE NEXT ONE. &gt;&gt; GOD ALLOWED EVERY ONE OF THEM TO PASS before Samuel. DAVID WASN'T EVEN IN the house. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT A COMPLEX. HIS [screaming] FATHER DIDN'T EVEN INVITE HIM INTO THE HOUSE. &gt;&gt; This is an important matter, son. A king's going to be anointed. You just stay out there with the sheep. &gt;&gt; He wasn't summoned. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD SENT SAMUEL &gt;&gt; WITH A MESSAGE &gt;&gt; TO ANOINT A KING. [screaming] &gt;&gt; [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; AND HE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN ON THE SCENE WHEN THE SEALS WERE BEING PREACHED, &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S HERE [screaming] NOW. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; THERE'S A PEOPLE ON EARTH BEING ASSEMBLED BY THE WORD OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IF THE SAME ANGEL OF THE LORD THAT RAN BACK ISRAEL TO HER HOMELAND TO MAKE HER READY, &gt;&gt; get her in place so he could reveal himself. the same angel of the Lord &gt;&gt; bringing people, &gt;&gt; drawing our hearts, dealing with your life, &gt;&gt; that you're more than just an ordinary young person. &gt;&gt; Sure, you walk with the same flesh, have the same battles, but you're more than just ordinary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's something different about your life. &gt;&gt; And let me just tell you something. YouTube can't explain it. &gt;&gt; Google can't explain it. &gt;&gt; GAMES CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. &gt;&gt; COLLEGE CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. A PROFESSOR DOES NOT HAVE THE MYSTERY. A DEGREE DOES NOT HAVE THE MYSTERY OF YOUR LIFE. GOD [screaming] HOLDS THE MYSTERY OF YOUR LIFE. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; And here was David. He comes in ruddy. &gt;&gt; Little guy. &gt;&gt; Don't look like a king. &gt;&gt; But this is why God told Samuel, "Don't you look on the outside. That's right. &gt;&gt; Don't you look on the countenance. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Don't you look based on this cuz that's not my choice. &gt;&gt; That's not how I choose. I choose by that which is of my own heart. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, you mean to tell me God didn't know all the failures that David would have? Remember, the Holy Ghost wasn't given in that time like it is now. But even through all of that, why was David a man after God's own heart? Because David would repent. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; He didn't try to make excuses for his shortcomings. &gt;&gt; Now, he needed help. THE WORD HAD TO DEAL WITH HIS LIFE. REMEMBER, CUZ MAN, he would not have come out and said, "KILL THAT MAN." &gt;&gt; THE WORD HAD TO OPEN HIM UP AND GET HIM LINED RIGHT UP JUST RIGHT. AND DAVID SAID, "That man." About that time, the word just dropped it down and said, "You the man." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You the man. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT DID DAVID DO? HE REPENTED. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER SAID, "WELL, IF MY DAD HADN'T BEEN LIKE THIS, IF THIS HADN'T BEEN LIKE THIS, IF SHE HADN'T BEEN WALKING around up there LIKE THAT, IF THIS, IF THIS, IF THIS." NO, HE REPENTED BECAUSE THERE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ANY WAY BACK WITH EXCUSES. &gt;&gt; It had to be full repentance. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And David, God already knew that. That's why God already knew all your shortcomings. That's right. &gt;&gt; He knew all my shortcomings. He knew all your failures, knew all of mine. &gt;&gt; God didn't choose you based on that. &gt;&gt; Cuz if that choice had been on that, you would have been standing last on the kickball line. &gt;&gt; And you can go on their team by default. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; But God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; He poured that anointing oil. And I love how the prophet said it. He said, notice, he just didn't drop it. He said, 'When God pours the Holy Ghost on, he pours it on. &gt;&gt; I stop here. Whose desire was it for David to be king? Was that David's desire &gt;&gt; or God's desire? &gt;&gt; Whose desire is it for you to serve God? Yours or God's? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's. That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why the prophet said, "You're not a Christian by your desire." &gt;&gt; You're a Christian by God's desire. &gt;&gt; And that desire, that word will keep moving on a life until eventually what? Full surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then even with full surrender, he's what's he doing? Molding us and shaping us into that place. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Saul. Saul. How did you know that David was anointed king? As a Bible reader, you know, it came to about the second time, second or third time of their interaction. Remember, he didn't cut he didn't cut the the the skirt this time. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. But it was after after this these times that Saul realized, you're my neighbor. You're the one that God's anointed. &gt;&gt; You know why? His behavior. &gt;&gt; That's so true. &gt;&gt; It wasn't because of his giant killing skills. &gt;&gt; It was his behavior. &gt;&gt; His character is what separated him. He was behaving like a king before he was ever on the throne. YES. [screaming] &gt;&gt; GLORY BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT THE ANOINTING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT DOES UPON YOUR LIFE. LISTEN TO ME NOW. IT WILL MOVE UPON YOUR LIFE TO WHERE YOU BEGIN TO CALL THOSE THINGS THAT ARE NOT AS THOUGH THEY ARE. WHEN THE HOLY SPIRIT MOVES UPON YOUR LIFE AND SAYS LIKE I READ THAT QUOTE, I'LL SEAL YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. I BELIEVE IN LORD. &gt;&gt; AND THEN WHEN HE SEALS YOU WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT, I'M TAKING YOU IN RAPTURE. I BELIEVE IT LORD. YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It's God's desire breaking over our lives &gt;&gt; and it's us yielding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I say to you friends, this yielding is not something that happens at 11:00 on Sunday mornings &gt;&gt; or 7 p.m. on Thursdays. &gt;&gt; But the shielding is every moment of your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right here in the service right here this morning. &gt;&gt; There can be a beginning. It can be a start for whatever the need is in your life. Whether it's the Holy Spirit, deliverance, something of besetting sin, a weight upon your life, healing, whatever it is. Remember, see that image in front of you. And I can't just say see that image. But what has the word done? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The word has not shown you any negative image. &gt;&gt; Can we say amen to that? Amen. &gt;&gt; The word has not shown you any negative image. Oh, brother Samuel, today when you mentioned that about Judas, is that all you got out of the service? &gt;&gt; You let the devil rob you? &gt;&gt; You let the devil robbed you? Oh, brother Samuel, if you had mentioned them 10 spies, you let the devil rob you. Do you Let me ask YOU A QUESTION. GOD DIDN'T EVEN TELL THE 10 SPIES, &gt;&gt; what the devil's tried to tell you. &gt;&gt; God has never done that through the scripture. He never even ran Esau down. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He gave him opportunities. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; THE WORD IS SET BEFORE US. &gt;&gt; YES, it is. &gt;&gt; And it's time just to say it's for me. &gt;&gt; It's for me. &gt;&gt; This is not the ideas of a man, not the impressions of a man, and let me study something to make the people feel good. No, no, no. &gt;&gt; This is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Because the only thing that'll bring change in life is the word of God. And sometimes before change can come, the conditions around have to be changed. &gt;&gt; God drives back the darkness in order so the seed can receive light. &gt;&gt; You're light in the Lord, right? You're light in the Lord. You become light in the Lord. Let your light shine on your loved ones. &gt;&gt; Let the light of God shine through. Let the light Let it let let it shine through. Oh, brother Sam, I can't wait tonight. I can't wait till I get done with this. I'm gonna sit down and give him a Bible study. Don't don't don't. That's called frustration. &gt;&gt; They don't need that right now. They need you to BE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; SHINE THE LIGHT. SHOW THEM JESUS IN FLESH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T NEED THAT. THEY NEED THAT. THERE'LL BE A TIME FOR THAT. BUT NOW'S NOT THE TIME. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Show them what it means for the word to be made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Samuel, I don't feel that ex spiritual. You don't have to feel spiritual to tell your son or daughter you love them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel spiritual to tell them you care about him. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't have to feel spiritual. You don't have to send out. You don't have to quote a quote. You don't have to put a scripture. Let me JUST TELL YOU, YOU HEAR WHAT I'M SAYING THIS MORNING. YOU ARE HIS THOUGHTS. &gt;&gt; THERE'S TIMES FOR WORDS TO BE SAID. &gt;&gt; But this is the hour for words to be lived. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let your light shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Samuel, we may not talk about nothing in the weather. Then be Jesus talking about the weather. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAMUEL, MY MY KIDS ALL THEY want to talk about if we get together today was Ohio State and that team up north. &gt;&gt; Then you know what? Be Jesus. &gt;&gt; There you go. That's so good. And just so if you need a little help on that right there, I think I happen to see a little bit of a clip. Ohio State one. &gt;&gt; That may be all you need to know. &gt;&gt; And just GIVE A LITTLE BIT. TALK TO THEM A LITTLE BIT AND LET THEM TALK. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Let them talk &gt;&gt; and you talk along with them. Oh, brother Samuel, that's so carnal. See, that very thing can keep you from them. That's right. &gt;&gt; Your carnality didn't keep Jesus from you. &gt;&gt; Your carnality, my carnality didn't keep him back from me. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Matthew's carnality did not keep him from going to Matthew's house. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But he went there and the light was shown. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, it's not us just hearing God's thoughts. We are his thoughts. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Let him take you into that cycle. Hear that transmission. Let him take you there. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father. [sighs] &gt;&gt; Oh, dear God. How it just Lord, it means so much just to our hearts. our hearts just Lord as I've just just sat Lord for weeks on in and just you know just pondering just that just there within future home and just that moment just going through there just listening to it and I just just stopped it Lord and just begin to thank you just Lord how you so impress your word upon our hearts oh God this this word. It's not by chance that we're gathered here this morning. The word that you've sent, Lord, it's not the thoughts of a man. It's your thoughts, Lord. And that's something, Lord, that we're resting in that. We're resting in the word of God. What a rest it brings to us. Lord, I pray if if there's one here or the sound of my voice or that would hear this that if they've not made that choice yet, I pray God, may they may they see you and may they see what they can be. And may Lord when they see what they can be, may they may they see that bloodline that's right between that can take care of all the unbelief. It can take care of fear. It can take care of doubt. That bloodline that can take care of all unbelief. That blood that's been made available as the spirit of God would anoint us, Lord, to be able to see It's already done. Lord, there's not one person here or should you, Terry, next week that even in surrendering their life to God, you don't have to go to Calvary one more time, you already went to Calvary for us. You already went to Calvary for that one that maybe doesn't even know about you this morning. You went for them. But Lord, in that season, in that moment, how you begin to deal with the hard and life to bring it to yourself. I love how your prophet said that in future home. How he led us to himself. You've led us by your word, Lord. Your spirit, Lord, calling upon our hearts and drawing us through justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We're not our work. It's not our work. We're your workmanship. Now, Lord, I pray here this morning. Lord, maybe there's sons and daughters here this morning that they just need that atmosphere around their life to be dissolved, to be changed. May they just take your word this morning. Allow the word to change the atmosphere. Drive away that unbelief. Drive away that gloom. Drive away that doubt that the light can shine down upon that seed. May you change the atmospheres and lives. Lord, may you, Lord, coming into lives that dear God, where that darkness has been drove back, clouds have been broken back, may the light of God shine in the depths of their life. And I'm asking you, Father, if there's anything that would be hindering in any heart or any life, would you by your light of your word, whereby all things stand naked and open before you with whom we have to do, would you just shine your light into our life? If it's something that's keeping us back from full surrender, would you just shine your light into our life, Lord? Because we want to side with the word of God. Lord Jesus, if there's something in our heart or our life, if there's something maybe that's become harbored, maybe it's a feeling, maybe it's a grudge, maybe it's a resentment, Lord God, may you shine the light. And father, for we don't want anything in our lives that would keep us from being more like you, Lord. Right here this morning, I give this congregation, myself, Lord, into your hands. &gt;&gt; Lord God, it's your word that has been spoken. Father, you have transmitted of your life, of your word. Now, Lord God, the greatest request is we just want to be the station to pick that up. Whether it's for the new birth, for healing, oh God, maybe it's a financial need. Father, you're still Jehovah Gyra. You're Jehovah Rafa. Maybe there's a great battle at hand. God, I pray may you just move down, Lord, for every need. And Lord, knowing that law of life is within us, may we just surrender like that little fish. That fish don't try to swim. It just surrenders. Oh, God granted. No wonder your prophet could say, "Just let God take you to the Holy Ghost. Just let God take you to your healing. Let God take you to whatever you have need of. Just yield. Say, "Lord, I yield." The universal sign of surrender is yes with our hands up. &gt;&gt; But God can see with our heart. Lord, I surrender. [music] I surrender, Lord. Take me, Lord. Like David after the anointing had come upon his life. Take me Lord. Lord, he had to go through many hard trials. He had to go through many things, Lord, where he was hunted down like a dog. But everything from before the anointing, then after the anointing was all character preparation for the throne. Even that which Abigail would come out and express to him, David, you don't want any regrets. Oh God, grant it this morning, Lord. Grant it, Lord. Take us, Lord. Take me deeper. &gt;&gt; Take us deeper, Lord. Deeper than we've ever been before, Lord. Grant it, Lord God. As a station picking up, Lord, this signal of your word. Grant it, Lord. I pray. Bring cleansing into lives, Lord. The Holy Spirit, Lord. May every heart be so focused, Lord, on you, the transmitter. Grant it, Lord God. Whatever their need is, Lord, you're the one who gives the Holy Ghost. You're the one that healing comes through, we're focused on you, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. bring me to you, Lord.
