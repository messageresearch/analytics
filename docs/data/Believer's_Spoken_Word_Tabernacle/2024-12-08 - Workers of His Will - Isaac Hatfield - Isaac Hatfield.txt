this morning amen give him a hand clap of Praise morning amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen did you come to have church this morning amen we appreciate the opportunity brother Samuel having the confidence and we just I'm not sure where he's at this morning but we want to be praying pray for him anden just praying for the service here that the Lord would give us Grace amen if you have a need on your heart let's just bow our heads and talk to the Lord this morning amen whatever need you have just lift it up before him Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your presence this morning we thank you Lord for the atmosphere that we have in this place father realizing Lord that doesn't come from a man but father that comes from you Lord as you begin to inhabit the Praises of your people father we realize Lord that there's another one that's stepped into the room father and Lord You're greater than any struggle you're greater than any Affliction Lord You're greater than any demon power Lord that would try to come against your children of God and we ask Lord that you have your way this morning we ask that you take control of speaker and hearer alike father and you just begin to minister once more father we'll be sure to give you the glory and honor Lord for you're the only one worthy of it father in the name of Jesus Christ we commit this service to you amen and amen if you have your Bibles this morning and we'll go straight to the word thank you musicians we want to turn to the Book of Matthew chapter 7 and then uh we just want to say thank you to each one of you have prayed for our family and my wife and uh the Lord's done such a work and she's doing much much better and then we wasn't able to bring him today but doing much better and we just want to say thank you for all the prayers and all the thoughts amen we just have a little thought this morning out of Matthew 7 and we want to start in the 18th verse uh down to the 29th and it says a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is heed down and cast into the the fire wherefore by their fruits you shall know them and not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him onto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock prise God and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes amen you may have your seats this morning may God bless the reading of the word and we just want to take a little thought out of that passage on workers of his will workers of his will and and just to take a few things amen not to hold you long this morning morning but some things that have been speaking to my heart out out of this area of Matthew 7 and and and to see these two classes of people that would come on that day and he said not everyone that saith Lord Lord but it's he that doeth the will of my father and there would be a people that would come and that would come under a rebuke that he said I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity and so we want to um be careful to mention that throughout the whole Bible we realize that there's two classes amen and you can see it here in Matthew 7 that he talks about a good tree and a corrupt tree amen and you can see he talks about you know a false Vine and a True Vine or a wise man and a foolish man or you know a wise virgin and a foolish virgin and you see it all throughout uh scripture and here uh that there would be two classes and one that doeth the will of the father and one that would be a worker of iniquity and and in Matthew 25 it also talks about how there would be a separation like a a shepherd separ Ates his sheep from his goats amen that on that day you know there'd be a separation the sheep from the goats or or maybe you're familiar with the wheat from the tears that there would be a separation that that that one would be gathered to be burned and one would be gathered into the barn of the farmer so we realize that maybe sometimes these these Spirits manifests in different ways but we want to bring it down to those two the two seeds those two Vines amen that that go throughout the whole word but the one we want to talk about first is that class of workers of iniquity and he would say many would come and he would say I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity and I think my uh what would it be like to to to to try to serve the Lord and to try to work for the Lord your whole life and spend a whole life amen trying to Labor uh uh um so to speak for the Lord and then on that day you would hear rebuke depart from me ye that work iniquity and brother Brandon would begin to tell us of course that that's where the disappointment will be you know it it won't be the drunkard or The Bootlegger or The Prostitute that will be disappointed on that day but it it'll be the multitudes that would fall under that religious spirit to think that I've got a right to be here because of my works and because I did this and because I did that amen and that very few would be saved and so brother brandom's telling us that you just be one of them because in Matthew 7 it also tells us that it would be a Straight Gate and a narrow way that would lead on to life and few there would that would find it and me and brother brandham tells a dream that his mother had that brother brandham was standing besides this highway and there was three steps that led up to the highway and and brother Brandon thought how beautifully that represented his ministry of the three steps of justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and there come a woman that was going to try to get on this highway but she was wearing high heeled shoes and brother Brandon begins to tell her sister you can't walk this highway like that and so she would try to get on the highway and walk the highway but as it got narrower and narrower she would begin to to fall off and and his mother described the horrible screams and things because because she was trying to walk the highway the narrow way without keeping every word of God she may have been obedient to every word except for one but this narrow way that the Christian walks and mean it requires an obedience to the word of God and mean it requires an adherence to the word of God BR Amen to walk this narrow way that leadth onto life amen that's the age that we're living amen amen as that Capstone begins to come closer and closer it becomes as brother Brandon would call it a honed age amen it's a narrow way amen but but the believer can walk in that way amen and so he would say it's a straight gate in a narrow way and that there would become come some that would come on that day and they would say I've done this and I've done that but brother Brandon would say that he said he said now these people claim they done it but they did not do it because that's right for he said I never knew you they just claimed they had done it he said like somebody going down to the bank and saying I you know I wrote a check out of your bank brother brandom and brother Brandon say I checked the bank it's not true you said you did it but you didn't actually do it and here they were claiming that they had done all these great things amen but it showed that there was something missing because he said I never knew you some something something's wrong somewhere along the line amen you you you were impersonating maybe something am mean but you weren't actually doing it amen and it shows uh in this age Amen brother Aaron uh many times you see if you look into uh sometimes you see people trying to get views I mean everyone nowadays is trying to do social media and and do anything to get views and attract attention so they'll go into restaurants and they'll pretend like they work there and they'll pretend like you know it's just another day on the job and and try to work until someone discovers that they don't actually work there and and they'll they'll try to impersonate police officers you you'll see videos about howy they they find somebody in a police car and they realize that they're not a they're not a police officer at all me but but it's an impersonation and and they could spend their whole day working at Wendy's or they could spend their whole day trying to pull people over but at the end of the day uh they'll come and and and they won't get a paycheck for that because they were in impersonating that they they weren't right to begin with they they they had on the the uh maybe the uniform and the badge but but they didn't have they were never hired they didn't come the provided way because they started wrong amen and that's the that's the thing that we don't want to Misses we don't want to start wrong because brother brand said you know you can go down to the 10- cent store and get a uniform and a badge and put it on and try pretend like you're in in the Army but but unless you have the the papers am mean to prove that you have the confirmation and mean then the uniform won't do you no good and a badge won't do you no good but you got to get the confirmation of the commission amen and that's what the believer has to do today you got to get your papers amen there in the first coming when Jesus come back on the day of Pentecost amen he was telling them he was commissioning them before he ever left the Earth amen that that they would go into all the world and preach the gospel and they would lay their hands on the sick and they shall be healed amen but before they were to go they were to go up to Pentecost and receive the confirmation of the commission and get the Holy Ghost that would that would that would lead them and guide them and amen and anoint them to do what they were commissioned to do and that's what the believer has to do this morning me is get the confirmation I mean you don't want to start wrong amen you want to come God's provided way amen for for brother Brandon would tell us you know if you jerk a gun amen just a thousandth of an inch Amen brother Aaron at 100 yards that's going to it's going to get farther off and farther off the longer that bullet travels and so that's why you want to be on the mark am me we read in Matthew 7 about the wise man and the foolish man amen they both built a house is that right brother Paul they both built a house but the problem was the foolish man didn't start right he started on the wrong foundation and he built it upon the sand am mean he did just as much work am mean but at the end of the road amen he didn't have anything to show for it because he didn't start on the right foundation amen and that's why it's so important to start on the right foundation to get started right Amen to come God's provided way amen and get your life established on the right foundation because if you take an apple tree and you plant it in good ground it will produce apples amen and if you see somebody that desires to see a living God and somebody that that wants to see if this message is real and there's a desire in their heart and if you plant them upon the right foundation then they have the ability to grow and produce what the word said they could produce amen but if you just plan them off in the wrong condition amen that then it takes away the Life Source for them to be able to thrive and be what God said they could be and that's how many of these started brother brand say how these workers of iniquity maybe they they got off in a little fleshly idea amen and how many first of all how many believers do we have here this morning amen so this category doesn't apply to you so just bear with me for a minute okay just just help me out we're going to get to your portion here in a minute amen but this is this is the the workers of iniquity okay so they started wrong maybe thinking that they could just earn a meal ticket and go and preach the gospel maybe thinking that they they just come under an emotion or some sort of a a Personal Agenda and they went out under that kind of inspiration amen but but the but what is Iniquity iniquity is to know to do something brother Shane and not to do it am mean and so here they are it's not that they didn't know right but they just weren't willing to do it mean and brother BR would tell us that every man knows that he ought to be born again every man knows that he needs to get the Holy Ghost but the problem is they would begin uh to put a shame upon the true gospel and make fun of the true experience of God and so because of their because of their image or because of politics amen people would begin to begin to shy away from the true word of God am mean because it didn't match their denomination taught or it didn't match the the the the what they had for their lives am mean maybe they wanted to climb in the denomination become a great preacher or Pope and they couldn't do it if they adhered to the word of God so instead knowing better they would instead choose to go a different way amen instead of just adhering to the word of God and that's the mistake and that was Israel's mistake am me brother Dave in the wilderness because what was the problem was when they stopped marching according to the word of God that's when they started wandering amen and when the Christian stops marching in line with the word that's when they start wondering maybe this is right maybe that's right and they begin to get their eyes on other things and if you're not careful you'll wander in the wilderness for years and years amen but you should just stay in line with the word and if you just keep marching in line with the word it'll take you where you need to go with God Amen you can March through justification you can March through the Wilderness but you're not meant to stay there you want to keep marching all the way to the promised land and that was what that that was where Israel made their mistake because it's not them brother Brandon would say not all that say Lord Lord but the one that doeth the will of my father not he that starts it's he that finishes there's no shortcuts you're disqualified at the end of the race no shortcuts you must come just the way the scripture said amen and and that's the overcoming class that's the ones that's going to be the finished amen not just to start right but you got to start right amen but you also want to finish right amen so all the while amen you just want to keep your eyes on the end of the road and keep walking with this word amen this Christian walk amen it's like that boy riding the bicycle I mean he he didn't look to the left or to the right he just looked to the end of the road and it took him where he needed to go amen but brother Brandon would talk about uh uh in 1 Corinthians 10 it's talking about here these children of Israel and it's says moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized onto Moses in the cloud and in the sea and did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness and brother Brandon would begin to say he permitted it but but he wasn't pleased with them you know here they were in the wilderness God was feeding them Mana God was taking care of them but they begin to complain they begin to look back to the garlic of Egypt they they said maybe we should have never left maybe maybe we should have just stayed where we were life wasn't so bad in Egypt after all and they begin to murmur and complain and God permitted them to partake of these wonderful Supernatural things but he wasn't pleased with them and they were overthrown in the wilderness and and brother Brandon begins to preach this in Corinthians book of correction that that that we want to check up we want to make sure we're right though we've partaken of the blessings though maybe some even sat in the meetings of the prophet and and God permits wonderful things but you want to make sure that your life is lining up with the word of God Amen for we're at the time of battle and we don't want to be overthrown at the time of battle but it's a checking up time Amen to make sure your life is is lining up with every word of God that that that we want to go on with the word and mean we don't just want to go on with the word and then stake down our tents and say Lord You've you've done so much for me I'm happy right here but you want to you only want to stick down your tents enough that the next day when the pillar of fire moves on you can move with it anden you don't want to get so so so pinned down in your Christian experience amen that as God begins to reveal his word to you that you can't allow it to change you and transform you amen amen like like how a new wine must get in the flexible skin amen and the key to Revival brother Brandon would tell us is flexibility Amen to have enough flexibility in your Christian walk amen that that you can be corrected and you can be changed and you can allow the word to begin to dig out things in your life that don't belong there and call you into higher places amen amen that that that you don't put a period upon your understanding but you just put a comma and and and brother DAV it's not that the message is going to change because it's the word of God Amen but your understanding as you begin to grow in the revelation of the word you may see something that you may have thought something was a certain way and then years later you realize it wasn't just exactly that way amen and sometimes you have to have the humility to admit I was wrong and the Word was right and Lord I'm willing to change my ways to walk in the revealed word for my day amen but but here these these children of Israel come up to the borderline in Hebrews 6 says it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tasted of the Heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance sing then crucify to themselves the Son of God aresh and put him to an open shame and then Hebrews 10:26 for if we sin willfully after that we have receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins and here brother Brandon would begin to explain this and there's a powerful quote and I believe it's question and answers on the Holy Ghost about this Hebrews 6 anden but but basically amen this doesn't belong to the believer this doesn't apply to the the the born- again believer this is this is speaking of a borderline believer this is speaking of somebody that come up right to the border and they partook of the Holy Ghost as it fell upon them they maybe even experienced the anointing and they tasted of the good work word of God and and mean they come so close to it that they tasted of it brother Shane but but they didn't receive it amen but they weren't willing to walk in it as brother Brandon would say about you know how many preachers would sit in their studies and prepare for their sermons and run across scriptural truth that would rebuke their congregation but but they weren't willing and they didn't have the courage to stand out against it and mean he even would say that the sins of Sodom vexed lot's righteous soul but he wasn't willing to call out against it amen and here he's showing that amen there would be some and brother Brandon preaches a message one time called God had explained and and there had been a bunch of ministers that had set a trap for him and were trying to pin him on his Doctrine and things but the Lord showed him what was going to happen so he goes down there and he preaches God had explained and he had ministers come up to him and say that that was the best thing I've ever heard and and there was we we've got 50 or 70 ministers that want to come down and get re-baptized and brother brand would say how many of them showed up not a one of them amen because God in his grace and mercy would reveal a path that they could walk in am me but because of their denominations and their Creeds a mean they wouldn't show up and walk in the word of God am mean and Jude would tell us that there would be men of old for for ordained to this condemnation am mean turning the grace of God into lishness am mean and brother BR say what is lishness it's to know truth but refuse to walk in it amen God and his grace would bring a message to this generation am me but ministers would refuse to to walk in it amen because it didn't fit the mold of their church or their system oh my but but but but that's why the Christian walk am mean it matters what side of the Border you're on am mean there is a group of borderline Believers that refuse to cross over I mean there is a place you can come in the Christian walk that if you're not careful you'll have just enough religion to make you miserable and you're just enough religion to try to avoid going to hell and mean and that's a miserable place to be amen but if you just cross over that line just that little border right there just move from one side to another am me you'll enter into a world like you never knew am me you'll still have bitles there's still Giants in that land amen but you're fighting it's your land it belongs to you amen and it becomes a joy to serve the Lord it becomes a reality that you are called of God and mean that you belong in this land that God's placed you in this land and you have a right you're a Son of God and the daughter of God Amen and God has predestinated you to be a part of it amen we don't want to live on the other side of the Border Amen on that side of the Border maybe you could fall away but on this side amen you're sealed under the day of your Redemption Amen on that side you look at you look at us bunch of people and call us a bunch of holy rollers and Fanatics and brandom mites but if you ever cross that Veil you won't do that no more but you'll say I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them and I am glad to be called a heretic amen for the Lord I'm glad to be a fanatic if it means I'm a fanatic for the Lord amen but outside of that Veil they can't see it their eyes are blinded but cross over that Veil one time oh and it'll become a reality this word will become uh uh something great to you something something beyond what you could ever understand in your intellectual abilities on the other side of that border am mean and if you are on the other side of that border it doesn't mean you're a worker of iniquity it just means you need to cross over amen cross over amen where the man is always fresh am mean where the there's honey and there's wine and there's grapes amen oh and it's a beautiful land amen but outside of that land there would be some second Timothy would tell us that would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof just as fundament just as fundamental brother Brandon would say maybe just as correct in their teaching amen and they maybe teach the second coming and they teach this and they teach that amen but but but as a form of godliness they might be very religious amen and go to church and be preachers even amen but they deny the power thereof amen putting their own interpretation to the word amen and refusing amen the power of the word amen amen and and and sometimes I I think maybe even as young people or around this message if you're not careful sometimes you look out at at maybe even denominations and and you see that they teach things that you believe and sometimes you think well what really makes us different than them they believe in the second coming Amen in the hour that we're living in in the condition of the world amen amen almost every Al Christian is looking for the coming of the Lord because they recognize the hour and me say what what really makes us different from them but although they might have a form of godliness amen and many of them deny the power thereof amen and that Veil is what separates you from the world it's that power that makes us different than the rest of the world am mean that power to come into the building and change hearts and lives am mean the reality of this word not just a dead letter but the person of the word Jesus Christ to be welcome in our midst and we don't deny the power thereof brother Dave we welcome the power thereof because we've entered behind the veil and we've come into a relationship with the power and it's the power of the word it's Jesus Christ that comes into our midst amen and comes on Thursday nights and Sunday mornings it begins to speak to your heart because the word is still a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart amen that's what makes us different we have the power of the Holy Ghost amen the Risen savior has come amongst us am mean the the Le toan world has blocked him out he's standing knocking at the door but they don't let him in but the bride has let him in and said come in and commune with me come in Lord I want to have fellowship with the power of this word Lord I don't want anything in me that's contrary to you and I know it'll take more than the Creed to take it out am mean but the power thereof I mean it doesn't take a 10-step program to fix a life but the power thereof can change it in a moment in the twinkling of an eye it can it can convert a soul and mean it can take drug addiction out of your life it can take pornography out of your life it can give you an overcoming power oh but you've got to invite the power thereof to be a part of the church to be a part of your life am mean you'll never do it with just a form of godliness it's the power thereof amen for I like how brother Wayne says it about men Ministry sometimes he said some are uh uh some are called some are sent and some just got up and went because maybe they had a a certain feeling or a certain unction or somebody said that they would pay for their Seminary school so they got up and went but they never went like Moses did to the back side of the desert and got converted am mean that they would be fit to preach this gospel they just got up under some Seminary or some theology oh and how harmful it can be amen for somebody to use this word behind a sacred desk to try to present their own ideas under their own ability without that sacred calling mean brother Brandon even sometimes wouldn't preach something for years because he didn't know if it was exactly right just yet you see how that nature was in a profit that when he would hunt squirrels he'd have to be right on the mark and how that rolled over into his ministry that it would have to be right on the mark amen but others would get up and just shoot Any Which Way and just maybe hope that one time it'll hit oh but how harmful how many lives have been hurt how many churches have been broken am me because they just got up and went oh my I I I think uh brother Paul that what if today we had a urum and thumb sitting in the Church of God and every sermon would have to flash or it wasn't right and every every prophecy would have to flash or it wasn't right amen amen maybe it would weed out some of the the nonsense that would would would come into denominations amen but we do have a uraman Thum it's the word of God and we can compare every scripture we can compare every sermon we can compare every prophecy and say either it flashes or it don't oh my amen I believe in in true called men of God and true called Christians amen not a bunch of impersonators amen that would try to get up without or papers amen like the man that would try to get into that wedding supper but he didn't have his wedding garment amen he he he got there but he didn't come the right way uh he didn't come God's provided way he didn't come through the door and get his wedding garment to get into the supper and there's only one door there's only there's only one way there's only one spirit that 1 Corinthians 12:13 would say by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body and there's one provided way and it's God's way Amen in Genesis Cain Jesus uh the Lord would even come down and maybe try to give Cain another chance to say if you just did it like your brother Abel you would you would be doing okay but Cain would say no I want my way but Cain's way was not God's provided way and so it would never work and so only God's provided way will work in this hour and many would maybe come and say well well because I've spoken tongues I have a right to enter and mean because I prophesied have not we cast out Devils have not we done this and that amen but Paul would tell us though I speak with tongues like men and angels though I do this and though I do that and mean but if I have not charity I am nothing I mean and friends I just believe the message of the hour if that's okay I mean this feels like a sister Church to me so I just believe I have full Liberty to preach the message anden so whatever brother brandom taught we believe in it we believe in the gifts we believe in the power of God Amen we believe in all of it from cover to cover it's nothing but the truth we're not here to add or take away amen but we are workers in the kingdom of God and when as workers God gives us a tool belt of the gospel and we've got our pliers and we've got our wrenches and our screwdrivers and we've got our hammer and me and if we want to do father's will you better not get rid of your Hammer you better not get of rid of your wrench because you don't know when you might need it amen so so we we would not get rid of the gifts we would not I mean I don't believe a a True Believer has to choose choose between gifts and the word or I don't believe a Believer has to choose between emotion and the word amen we just want it all and me if it's in the word we want it all if brother Brenham taught it we want it all amen amen but here these would come in and say but just because because I spoke in tongues that I have a right to enter but but Paul would begin to tell us that amen lest you have the giver am mean you can have all the gifts but you must have the giver am mean and when the giver comes in am mean it'll bring a conversion am mean and that's what you have to have in your Christian walk is a conversion to change something from old to new otherwise that amen they get the cart before the horse amen and think that just because amen those the you know Brandon would deal with it and a mean so many times with the Pentecostal group mean because they would preach speaking in tongues as the evidence and all those things so he's showing that that's not the true evidence amen but the true evidence of the believer amen he would begin to tell us would be to receive the word for your day amen to show that there's got to be a conversion because when brother Brandon went beyond the curtain of time and mean he would say I mean this is this is the Holy Ghost this is perfect love nothing will enter here without it amen and so that's why a Believer must be converted and until God can come in your heart and God is love and that love begins to grow into your life am me amen that that character begins to grow into your life amen because that love cannot be impersonated amen so that's why amen they would show up on that day with just maybe I mean maybe an outward expression but no love in their heart but but but when you've got that love in your heart you know it comes from God because Satan cannot impersonate that love oh and the scripture says in 1 John 4:8 he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love amen so here amen these workers of iniquity would fall under that rebuke I never knew you amen but it wasn't only that God never knew them but here the scripture saying he that loveth not knoweth not God so not only did God never know them they never truly knew God because they never had love they never had God in their hearts which is love amen and the Bible would begin to tell us if you love me keep my Commandments I mean and what was the problem with these workers of iniquity was they were disobedient to the word of God they refused to keep the Commandments of God Amen and so how could they truly love God and not keep his Commandments amen but they were come some into the Earth that would be children of Disobedience amen disobedient to the revealed word of God Amen refusing to walk in the Commandments of God am mean and how would we know them brother Dave mean by their fruits you shall know them I mean because the rain's going to fall on the just and the unjust and mean now we're getting somewhere with this okay just bear with me the rain's going to fall on the just and the unjust amen but a good tree cannot bear corrupt fruit and a corrupt tree cannot bear good fruit and mean and some people sometimes it seems like they get so tangled up in that area because they'll go to a youth camp or something and they'll see somebody get under the anointing and then go out and live a contrary life and they'll just want to throw the whole thing away but that was one of the first things brother random learned when he come around the spirit of God in Mishawaka was that the rain falls on the just and the unjust and those two could stand up you remember it one could speak in tongues one could interpret and one could be a real Christian and one could live uh with multiple wies and he would say how could it be and mean but the rain's going to fall on the just and the onjust but by their fruit ye shall know them oh here we're getting something brother brandom says then I knew the truth of the camp meeting in the vision the Lord showed him a vision of that parable of the sewer how there would W come one sewing the seed and another would come behind him sewing the seed and the wheat and the tears would both Rejoice amen say praise the Lord under the an oting and he's saying the parable of the sewer and the seed the sixth chapter of Hebrews and the evident manifestation of spiritual gifts in a mixed audience all became wonderfully clear oh don't you like when it becomes wonderfully clear he says the swer in white was the Lord the sewer in Black was the devil the world was the field the seeds were people elect and reprobates both partook of the same nourishment water and Sun both prayed both received help from God for he maketh his son and Rain to fall on both good and evil and although they both had the same wonderful blessing and both had the same wonderful manifestations there was still one great difference they were of different seed amen and he said now also was the answer to Matthew 7 and he reads amen about the workers of iniquity and he says Jesus does not deny that they did the mighty works that only the Holy Ghost going accomplish by way of man but he did deny ever knowing them he says these weren't backsliders these were Wicked unregenerate unregenerate reprobates these were the seed of Satan oh my and mean you know what that tells me me because sometimes in your Christian walk you're going to make mistakes and sometimes you might even backslide amen but amen but that doesn't make you a worker of iniquity amen sometimes you get such a complex amen when somebody preaches about a about the wrong seed and you say is it me is it me Lord and mean but it had nothing to do with you and mean it was never in you to be a worker of iniquity for brother brandom said they tasted the good Reign from heaven but to begin with they were wrong to begin with their objectives wasn't right their motives wasn't right and mean you see they weren't right from the beginning am mean but that am me sometimes you you wonder maybe if am I a worker of iniquity but the truth is you don't even know what it would be like to be a worker of iniquity you don't even know what it's like to have the wrong motive and objective am me because am mean from the beginning the seed of God dwelt inside of you and it separated you and see it comes down to the seed these were not a backsliders these were seed of Satan amen that come on that day amen and we and we're cast out from the presence of God Amen but the true seed of God Amen will not be cast out on that day am me because am mean from the beginning am mean the seed of God dwelt inside of you oh you say what Hey Brother Shane maybe sometimes you think one day I I'm just going to fall one day everyone's going to find out that I'm a failure one day one day the Pastor's going to realize I'm just a hypocrite and I'm just like a Judas amen but under the identification of the word you can look the devil in the eye brother Brandon say it wasn't so from the beginning and it was never in me to be a Judas it was never in me to be a backslider and mean that that would be a worker of iniquity it was never in me and mean to betray the Lord it was never in me to disbelieve this message and me because from the beginning the seat of God was planted in my soul and called me Amen to believe the message of the hour it wasn't so from the beginning amen because you are defined by the word amen and you cannot beat your type oh my see if Judas is your type then you're not going to be able to beat it am me but if the Lord is your type if Abraham is your type if Moses is your type then you cannot beat your type you can't be something different than what you are brother Aaron but what God has called you to be that's what you are that's what you were and that's what you're going to be tomorrow that's what you're going to be next week I'm saying there's a seed that dwells in the heart oh brother Brandon would say am mean that your anointing tells on you amen that's his that's the he says he says your anointing tells on you whatever your spirit is moves you you're motivated by a spirit anden and sometimes maybe when you were young brother Paul you would try to do something and you would try to get away with something and say uh yeah mom I did take out the trash and and then maybe Ben comes along and say no he didn't I I saw him I had to take it out he didn't do it you see it's something that told on you amen and your anointing tells on you amen you say oh I'm never going to make it oh I'm just a failure amen but there's an anointing upon your life amen why are you still here amen what brought you to church this morning what's kept you through all the trials and the heartaches what's anchored your soul Beyond the Veil and mean your anointing tells on you and mean your lips sometimes you even get discouraged and you begin to confess the wrong thing but then that anointing begins to pick you up and say you're a liar that's not the truth you're a Son of God you're a daughter of God you came from God and you're going back to God and you never did it in the first place oh your anointing begins to tell you out and mean you begin to confess the devil's lie and me but the devil's lie doesn't Define you the word of God defines who you are oh we're living in a day where everybody's got to have their pronouns and say I'm a he or she or this or that amen but I don't care what you say you are I mean I want to know what are you are you a boy or are you a girl because what you say you are doesn't really matter and me brother Wayne would begin to tell the church the other today about objective versus subjective truth and you can look at this pulpit and you can say it's a closet you can say it's a door I mean from your subjective point of view you can say whatever you want but it doesn't really change the objective truth is that this is a Pulpit am mean and the devil would try to am mean from his point of view tell you mean that you're going to fail and you're never going to make it am mean but that doesn't change the objective truth about your life but the truth is amen that you are a son of God God that you are a seed of God Amen that the Rapture is for you am mean the Millennium is for you amen and you are not defined by the devil you are defined by the word of God and so when the word says you are loosed you are loosed when the word says you're anointed you're anointed when the word says you're an overcomer you're an overcomer and mean whatever the word says about you that is the definition over your life oh my amen your your your complexes don't Define you your mist Stakes don't Define you oh glory amen because we all make them but they don't Define you you see when Abraham's commentary was written by Paul amen and when Paul would write about Moses Moses and Pa Abraham they made mistakes am mean Abraham would lie Moses would make mistakes even kill a man uh under his own abilities a mean but when Paul wrote their commentary he would be like Abraham who stagger not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving glory to God and mean what defined Abraham it wasn't his mistakes and mean Paul defined him as a man of Faith a hero of Faith who staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith giving glory to God oh and your mistakes do not define you oh and me brother brother Wayne would preach a while back on identification and he would say when an Eagle Falls it doesn't change the the species amen a fall doesn't change the species a mistake didn't am mean he wasn't an eagle one day and a chicken the next brother and mean he was and mean when he fell he was an eagle and when he got up he was still an eagle and mean he never was a chicken to begin and he wasn't never going to be a chicken and mean and you are not a bride member one day and a worker of iniquity the next day mean but you are what you are and mean when you ever recognize what you are you'll realize that your mistakes don't change who you are your faults don't change who you are your your your failures don't change who you are Church you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ and you came from the mind of God oh and despite everything else that's who you are despite the fall the eagle was still the eagle oh and brother Brandon would say that this man learned that science says that a bumblebee should never be able to fly me but brother Brandon would say I guess the Bumblebee didn't listen to what science had to say because he flew anyhow and they would say that the days of Miracles are passed but brother brandham didn't listen to what they had to say because the word had already defined that he was the same yesterday today and forever amen and so you got to stop letting the devil Define who you are but you say despite what science says despite what the devil says I am an eagle I am the bride despite despite what the devil says I like that word despite it means without being affected by or without taking any notice or being influenced by not prevented by amen you know what that means amen the Lord amen that's called me to preach this gospel that means that I'm a preacher despite whether it's a good sermon or a bad sermon amen my feelings will definitely maybe change me if it goes good if it goes bad I mean you're going to feel it but despite that it doesn't change that I'm a preacher and me and the pastor may have good days and bad days and up days and down days but despite that it doesn't change that he's the pastor and me you think well I just feel like I made a mistake and and one day the Lord's just going to open the Earth and swallow me up because of my stupidity I me well if daythan and cor was your type maybe but if that's not your type then you can forget about it am mean because it doesn't change what God thinks about you am mean because your identity is stronger than that it comes from the word of God oh you might have this is Sunday so amen tomorrow might be a little rough sometimes those Mondays Amen brother Ben they're just Mondays that's all you can say Amen but I'm going to tell you what despite what tomorrow holds I can tell if you can identify yourself in this Bible as a Christian then I don't care what tomorrow holds I I know what you're going to be you're going to be a Christian I mean I really don't know what next week holds if we have a next year I don't know what it's going to hold but I can tell you you're going to be a Christian next year you're going to be an overcomer next year because despite what the devil's going to throw at you amen your identity doesn't change because you have been defined oh you are defined by the seed that lays inside of you amen you are not defined by the outward conditions you are defined by the seed and so that's why we can spend amen laying a foundation for the workers of iniquity but then if you could ever recognize who you are in the scripture and if you could ever realize that that is not you and me then you can let off the pressure and and look the devil and tell him I know who I am am I I I know what I am and it's not going to change amen because it's anchored in the mind of God Amen but this would be a time amen that we could know what these seeds are that we could know what these Spirits are a prophet could come and begin to identify him to us begin to show us uh you know he would begin to tell us that if the church only knew its position and it will one day then the Rapture will go is that right brother Alex me so so the prophet would begin to reveal amen who this bride is and that she's been called out of denominations Amen in only one book brother Brandon would say there's only one book that reveals who you are where you came from and where you're going and so as the as as we're in this age where the Lord's revealing who we are and mean and also revealing to us what this other Spirit would look like and so in second Thessalonians 2 and 3 it says let no man deceive you by any means MH for that day shall not come except they coming a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed the son of predition who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God or is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God remember ye not that when I was yet with you I told you these things and now you know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time now brother brandom takes that and shows that it would be revealed at the breaking of the seals and mean that this man of sin would be revealed in his time and that would be at the breaking of the seals and so he said we we would know exactly what it was and he say who is this man of iniquity who is this man of sin this fellow that's a working iniquity but he would be revealed in his time and so this is in the first seal and and this seal is just beginning to break open that that white horse rider was not Christ but it was the Antichrist and showing that this man of sin this workers of iniquity amen was beginning to be revealed as that Antichrist spirit that would come into the into the age and so in verse 7 it says the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and so he says deceivers you see deceiving the people often to something um see but only he God that leth will let until the church Christ the bride be taken out of the way and then shall that Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth destroyed with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness and then that perish because they receive not the love of the truth that they might be saved and brother BR says with all deceivableness of unrighteousness deceive deceiving people by unrighteousness so here comes this class of deceivers trying to deceive people by unrighteousness and them that perished and then he says not this bride so them that perish but it's not going to be this bride now them that's looking for such a thing because they receive not the love of the truth so he showing us that the mystery of iniquity does already work amen who is this man of iniquity who are these workers of iniquity am me showing that there was this seed of Satan this Antichrist spirit that began to come in and work in workers of iniquity and try to deceive amen the true bride amen that there would come false Christ that there would come false prophets amen and that they would deceive the very elect if it were possible amen but of course brother Brandon would tell us amen that it's not possible that those whose names on the L's Book of Life would not be deceived and and then brother Brandon would actually tie it back to that Hebrews 6 just like it would be impossible for them to be renewed amen that that there's a bride and it's impossible for them to ever be deceived amen because you are the word amen so if it were possible amen but you've been built to withstand amen amen amen that other seed that that that that seed of iniquity that would try to penetrate this age amen but brother Brandon would tell us that that he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the Greater Works and she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen so here brother brandom's saying I just want to read this one more quote here to to to to to bring this out he said now I said a moment ago that the false Vine came into full fruition in this age her fruit would mature and ripen that is correct this evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mustard seed that grew into a tree where in Lodge the fowls of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity and then he says all this is true brother Dave and then he says and if this is true then it must also be true amen that the bride church WIll mature and her rightness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ amen you got to recognize amen where you belong in the scripture sure there's a mystery of iniquity sure Satan is coming Amen to to totally embody himself amen as an antichrist spirit amen but at the same time there's another mystery it's the mystery of godliness and you've got to recognize where you're head ship belongs amen Satan is not your head amen but your head amen is the mystery of godliness your headship is the word is that right brother amen you come under the headship of this word amen and you recognize amen that God was made flesh amen and while Satan is trying to inhabit fleshly vessels amen and become incarnate in his army oh there is another Army rising up anden God has come down and been made flesh in a bride body picking up some workers of his will picking up an army that would withstand this Antichrist Spirit an army that would only adhere to the word of God and Me Say what is all this about what is all this about iniquity and workers of iniquity and Mysteries of iniquity and cups of iniquity what's it all about you see in in in in in the first Exodus they had to wait until the amorites cup of iniquity would be filled because they were going to inhabit at the land but until the cup of iniquity would be filled amen then then God wouldn't drive them out but once it was filled then it would become time for Exodus oh and we are living in another age amen where it's Exodus time for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and we're just waiting while that Gentile cup of iniquity is being filled am mean and we're waiting brother dayve for that last seed to come in amen amen what's it showing what's it all got to do with us this revealing of iniquity and Mysteries of iniquity am mean mean it don't have anything to do with you am mean because while Satan's coming down incarnate amen the scripture says only God he that lth will let until he be taken out of the way D so what does all this show to us friends it shows that it's Exodus time it shows that it's time where God's going to take a bride out of the way and me and you will not have to stand the Judgment with those workers of iniquity amen but you will be in Paradise amen enjoying a wedding supper amen with the Lord himself the power thereof will pick you up off of this Earth and change your mortal body in the moment in the twinkling of an eye you'll no longer be in this old Earthbound condition and me but while Satan's having his time in the tribulation I'll be in glory celebrating eternity with the Saints of old because I came from God and that's where I'm going back to oh this bride doesn't go through the tribulation and the blood of Jesus purifies this bride oh Hallelujah he stood my tribulation on Calvary tribulation is in my past and Rapture is in my future because he bore it for me at Calvary oh friends you might be guilty of iniquity you might have been born in sin you might have been shapen in iniquity but that doesn't make you a worker of iniquity oh my but while he laid there on that cross brother Shane and he was wounded for your transgression he was bruised for your iniquity and you will not have to stand the Judgment with those class amen you're of a different seed and the destination of this seed is eternity the destination of this seed is Paradise oh hallelujah it's the mystery of the translation of the seed of God Amen someone would come and ask brother Brandon one time cuz in Matthew 8 said the children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer Darkness where there shall be weeping and nashing of teeth and they would say is that the same as casting them out of the mind of God and brother Brandon would begin to answer the question and be like well you're referring to the wedding supper now and he begins to show well the children of the Kingdom always refers to Israel and me and so begins to answer this question and mean and and brother Brandon would preach to us that under those 70th weeks of Daniel that there would be a Reconciliation for iniquity for Israel I mean because you see iniquity is to do wrong right and you know to do something and you don't do it and at the cross I mean they were guilty because they they crucified their Lord amen but what the difference was amen was amen for Israel they didn't do it willingly amen but God blinded them amen that you might receive life amen is that right brother amen so God blinded them that us Gentiles might have a chance to receive the message amen and so they will have a space where reconciliation for iniquity will be made and brother Brandon begins to answer this and say no amen it's not what he's talking about they won't be cast out of the mind of God because he cannot forget Israel amen and you remember what the rebuke was to those workers of iniquity and mean it was I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity and I begin to thank brother Dave ma if he can never forget Israel what about this bride mean and mean you're worried that one day he's just going to rebuke you and say I never knew you depart from me but how could he forget you and mean when he came when you came from the back part of his mind and mean when he put your name on the L's book of life before the foundation of the world what about it brother Aaron I was there I was there as a Son of God shouting for Joy amen when the morning started are sing for Glory and we saw the Plan of Redemption God putting some names on the Lamb's Book of Life by the spoken word and when he spoke his name that he would be the lamb slain from before the foundation of the world he spoke my name with his and so I can read Matthew 7 and I can know that worker of iniquity doesn't apply to me because he knows me he knows me he knew me before the foundation of the world Amen our mother might forget her suckling child but how could he forget us whose names are engraved on the palms of his hands and mean what about it amen that a god rich in Mercy that somebody could step into a prayer line amen and in a moment they could put their sins under the blood amen and in that moment a prophet couldn't even call it out because it was forgotten it was under the blood and that same mind of God can never forget you amen he can forget your sins in a moment amen but how could he forget you his children who came from the back part of his mind who were his before the foundation of the world Oh my he would say I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end and how could he be thinking about you and thinking about an expected end for you if he never knew you but he would say I called you amen and your future was clear amen and you're going to make it because because you're my seed oh hallelujah hallelujah amen what about amen see you started right because you started in the mind of God oh my you started right you were there when the worlds were formed Amen in John 6 would say all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out for I came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me you see it's not all that saith unto me Lord Lord but he that doeth the will of the father and here he says and this is the Father's will which ha sent me that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day oh he's got a purpose and he will not lose a one of his amen those prodal that you're worried about he will not lose a one of his amen amen sometimes you might make mistakes but he will will not lose a want of his sister and me amen he cannot lose those Eternal attributes that came out from him oh but we want to do the will of the father that's what Christ Christianity is would be to do the will of God and so brother Brandon would tell us that this is the Father's will this is his word and his will is his word and then he would say in uh true and false Vines this is the Father's will that used to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and be born again you see this is the Father's will that you should do his word and if you I mean if you want to be a worker in the kingdom of God you don't just want to be found working without purpose you want to be found working in the will of God and Father's will is to be born again amen it it Marvel not that I say unto you you must be born again am me except a born man be born again he can in no wise and see the kingdom of God Amen it's not something that you work amen friends it's something that's Born Into You am mean me without that new birth every effort is in vain am mean because am mean you could make every effort you could do every effort you could be a a a a a Christian to a tea as far as Works go but that's not Father's will father's will is that you be born again and because that is God's program of acceptance and mean God's program is that you come under the blood and be born again and mean here these group would come on that day and say have not I done this and have not I done that and look at me and look at my successes and look at my righteousness and my Prosperity but that is not God's program God's program of acceptance was to get under the shed blood I I I can imagine that maybe in the first Exodus that there would be some that that would maybe I mean refuse to follow the command of Moses the prophet because they might think well I I'm a good Christian and I'm an Egyptian and and I'm a priest and I'm this and I'm that so I don't need under the blood I mean I'm good enough amen I can survive these plagues amen but but there was another class of people that were hid away under that token and when they were hid away under the shed blood and they were safe and that's what God recognized is God only recognizes the token amen it's not have not I done this and have not I done that amen but it it's my hope is built on nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling and mean it's God's provided way it's the shed blood and mean why was Cain rejected and Abel accepted because Abel got under God's program and he got under the blood I mean why was Rahab accepted and pardoned and me why were the children of Israel amen safe under that token because it was God's program it's not your righteousness that's right amen that's a good thing it's not our righteousness amen sister Anna Maria it's not our it's not our righteousness will get us nowhere with God I mean because we could come to the Lord and say I quit smoking I quit drinking I quit Dancing out in the world anden and he could just stand there and say okay well that sounds great great you did it you did it that that's your works but what about me what what can I do for you and you can say I I'm very righteous and you can bring all your righteousness to The Altar and say Lord I I've done all this and I'm a good Christian and I read my Bible every day and I pray amen but am mean that's what you do that's your works but am mean what God does for you is Grace that's the shed blood and mean you are not saved by works but you are saved by grace through faith not of Works let's any man should boast and mean and mean none of us have a right to boast our own works this morning but the only thing we can boast upon is the shed blood of Jesus Christ oh and it's a good thing you can get away from that Armenian bondage am me that one day and mean because maybe you forgot to read that bi your Bible that day that you're going to go to hell somehow and mean because you forgot to pray that night or you fell asleep while praying and now you you think that God's going to just condemn you and throw you away and but if you're a Son of God you're still a Son of God Amen if you've got the blood over your life amen then you make a mistake just repent and move forward and mean you got to stop letting the condemnation hold you down for days and weeks and months and me put it under the blood get in the program of God and move forward and be a worker for the Lord I mean you I mean you say Lord I wasted so much time I mean but forget those things which are behind and let's press towards the mark of the high calling and we say I've done this and I've done done that why don't you just put it under the blood and get back on your feet like the eagle that you are and say Lord I'm ready to get back up and fight for you I'm ready to begin to work Lord in your kingdom once again oh my you live under condemnation you live under faults and failures and mean and you're you're you're so wore out and mean because you're trying to attain perfection in your own Works am mean and the scripture would tell us to be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect if you're trying to attain that in your own works you'll drive yourself crazy but Perfection comes from the shed blood and you can make a mistake brother Alex and there is still a perfect blood pumping for you daily and me that you can get under that shed blood and you are still perfect because there's a perfect blood amen that he shed for your sins oh my and mean Works haven't gotten me this far and so why would I trust them to carry me through and me it's exhausting it's exhausting I mean you you if you try to do it upon the program of your works right you'll never attain it you'll never I me if you're waiting to accept the promises of this message if you're waiting to move into higher Heights with the Lord because you're still making mistakes amen then who is going to claim these promises who is going to possess this amen Amen brother Paul I maybe you've got your angel wings but I don't have mine yet I still make mistakes amen you might never make a mistake amen but I do so I need the blood amen and we all make mistakes to tell the truth aen but if you get under that shed blood then you can accept the finished work at Calvary because it's not based upon your goodness it's based upon the shed blood amen and what he did for you and he already paid for every promise so you don't have to work it up to try to earn it just put everything under the blood and begin to accept the promises of God oh my you can begin to claim them you can come boldly Before the Throne of God and ask abundantly that your Joys might be full am mean you can seek and you shall find you can knock and it shall be open it it might be opened onto me it shall be opened onto you I mean you can you can seek the Lord and you have a promise that you shall find them but you say well maybe maybe because this mistake maybe because of what I did last last week amen that promise isn't going to come to pass amen isn't the blood powerful enough Amen to purge those sins away that you can move on you can get out of that rut and mean you don't have to stay there forever and mean the power there of Amen is hereen that can change your life that you don't have to stay in that rut of addiction you don't have to stay in that cycle of failure constantly amen and mean there is a power that can give you the ability to overcome that thing oh my it's God's program it's and it don't change amen if you ever accept God upon the basis amen if if God's ever healed somebody amen and you come upon the same basis that he seals somebody before he's Duty bound to his word to meet you on that same basis and so if you ever find God's program then you know that if you come God's provided way he's Duty bound to his word to meet you upon that program amen and if God has ever accepted somebody before you can come that way and say Lord amen how do I know I'm going to be accepted amen because the first fruits of the Resurrection our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ went to Calvary as our sacrifice and he was accepted amen and so if you're in him you can have the confidence that you're going to be accepted amen amen that you can have the confidence that if the Same Spirit dwells in you it shall also Quicken your mortal bodies that he came up as the first fruits and was waved and me and his life was accepted then that same life inside of you brother Brian can be accepted oh my but what about let's bring it a little bit farther to our day anden brother Brandon one time went beyond the curtain of time and he's beginning to to meet all of the saints that had gone before and he's saying uh these aren't all bandoms are they said no these are your converts and then brother Dave he would begin to say well will Paul's group have to stand and be judged and they would say yes and he would say well then Glory I preached exactly what Paul preached and amen that group would cry out we are resting on that amen and then the the that voice would begin to tell them and if you are accepted on that day and and and it's I believe it's in the rejected King and it says and you will be and mean then you will present am mean these converts as the trophies of your ministry and mean you see God's program is to get under the blood and me you see the program for today is to get under this message of the hour and mean because we've already had a prophet go beyond the curtain of time and say I preached what Paul preached and if you are accepted on that day and you will be then he would present us with him as the trophies of his ministry so what do you got to do in this hour to be accepted get in the program of God amen and if God's program is the blood then get under the blood and if God's program is the message then get under the message and start working in the program of God oh my it's God's program and me and brother Brandon would say that that's the way we always Escape is following God's program mean and God's program in the day of Noah was to get in the ark and God's program and the to the children of Israel was to get under the token and God's program today is to get under the message of the hour brother BR said we're not to come together to talk about the message we are come together to get in the message can I hear it amen and the message is Christ he is the word that's right we're to get into it get beneath it and me brother brand would say the church ought to get in God's program then the church will move all right he would say and sooner we can get to that the better the church will achieve the purpose of God when we get to God's program and mean we're not trying to get into our own program now we're trying to lay aside our program that we might get in God's program uh we don't want your program we don't want my program we amen I I I believe I can speak for your pastor this morning this church wants to get under the program of God and me because he's a Believer and mean and I'm a Believer and you're Believers and we have a desire Lord what is your program that we might get under it and and if his program for today is the message of the hour then we ought to get under the message of the hour and me you see brother Braham tells about that Lighthouse and those birds would come and try to beat the light out he said when they should have just used it to go to safety instead they beat their brains out trying to put the light out it's said oh how they today instead of trying to beat this message out they should be using it to go to safety am mean and you see they're trying to write articles about this message they're trying to print things and and build websites about this message but if they would just recognize that it's God's program of Escape for this hour am mean they're working they're really working but they're not working they're not accomplishing anything for the kingdom of God because they're working against God's program instead of for God's program and under God's program and in God's program today and mean is to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit and mean we're not meant to be led by man we're meant to be led by the Holy Spirit and God places men in his church that he might lead through them but he is the leader and mean I believe God's program is still to to to to to be dressed in Holiness and mean it might not be popular today but I still believe it's God's program and you know God's program is still that his word might come through a prophet in Amos 3:7 that he would do nothing until he reveals it first to his servants the prophets oh it might not be popular but it it's I believe it's popular in this church because it's God's program you see am mean they would try to uh brother would say that that's part of God's program preaching is his program oh my I mean there's a lot coming against preachers in this hour am mean saying we should just press Play Amen but what's God's program I hear a prophet says preaching is his program and he says God has so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program oh but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we are in God's will doing his program amen amen amen we want the church to move along this morning but we've got to get in the program of God am mean so that the church might move along mean I don't want to be guilty of paralyzing the program of God everybody say Lord what have you called me to do what's your program for my life what's your will for my life what does this message say and how can I operate as a worker in the will of God to do the program of God and I believe it's God's program and mean I believe it's God's program to worship him oh you see there's a lot that would try to come against true worship in this hour and and the devil would try to use Satan's program to Rob worship from the Lord or to try to get people off in either formalism or fanaticism but I believe there's a bride and me that's walking in the program of God that worship God in spirit and in truth oh brother BR said when the Holy Ghost comes into the church and wants to bless the church people set just as cold and starchy that's the same thing the Pharisee did too busy with other things we got too much to do we're afraid we'll interrupt something don't worry he says you won't interrupt nothing when you're entertaining Jesus you'll be right in the program of God you might be out of man's program but you'll be in God's program when you're entertaining Jesus I think it's about time we get out of man's program and man trying to tell us what we should do and how we should worship and we could read this quote but don't read that quote and we can worship God this time but not that time and I say let's get in the program of God and worship God in spirit and truth and be the the the children he's called us to be oh friends I've been commissioned Amen to let everything that have breath praise the Lorden like that woman washing his feet amen that had an elbow through a bunch of of Pharisees and and Prestige and in denominational order to get to Jesus amen but brother Brandon would begin to say Amen that people get so worried about order me and he would begin to tell them I I hope they can get out of order long enough to get saved amen and and Satan's program trying to lock the people down until they're scared to hardly make a move amen amen but but you've got to break out of Satan's program to get into God's program and get saved and Worship the Lord oh I'm not talking about true order I'm talking about Satan trying to rob God of his worship and God of his praise amen and Satan always tries to twist God's program am mean because I believe it's God's program that that that men and Brethren ought to dwell together in unity amen and Satan of course would try to twist that and try to to bring in a world Council of churches and try to bring in a false Unity me but of course God's program of Fellowship is under the shed blood amen but under that shed blood Amen brother would say God has a program and that program is written in his word and his word said we should all be one all together not divided divisions and fusses and stews but we should be one Christ prayed that we would be one and he said this will all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one for the other oh my I believe it's God's program amen uh of course Satan would try to twist it into a false Unity but I believe brothers and sisters can dwell together in unity amen oh well sir you know you get wrong sometimes you get hurt but I believe that there is a way and that we could get the differences behind us and mean that that that we could leave the arguments at the door and mean I I don't believe I believe we want to be workers of his will not just a bunch of Fighters and mean not just getting up trying to fight with each other and fight with our neighbors and and fight with this church and that church and this pastor and that Pastor I mean but we want to be workers in the will of God Lord what can I do to help my brother and sister Lord what can I do to build him up Lord I don't want to talk bad about him Lord what can I do to try to help get them out of the rut that they're in they made a mistake but I don't want to spread it all over the church Lord what can I do can I pray for them can I go and get the pastor and talk to them Lord what can I do am me I don't want to do something to to fight against the will of God and and try to tear down and break up fellowship and and hurt somebody Lord I want to provoke my brothers and my sisters onto love and onto good works I I want to encourage them Lord amen to get back up and keep fighting cuz we need them in the program of of God we want to be about father's business amen as we bring it to a close here you see we can learn to follow the beat of the word praise the Lord because when you conf find God's program then you can stop you you you sometimes you feel like you're working and you're working but you're not getting anywhere you're not accomplishing anything but you check yourself Lord am I in your program and when you can find the program of God and you can follow the beat of the word man so when the word would say in Hebrews let us labor therefore to enter into his rest so you say what am I supposed to do am I supposed to labor or am I supposed to rest I mean but it's follow the beat of the word that's you labor when it's time to labor and then once you enter you rest when it's time to rest if you're seeking the Holy Ghost you repent and you be baptized but then you don't have to just beat an altar to get it from God he said repent be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so you can find begin to find the channel of God that you can work and accomplish you see uh uh when Jesus come on the scene there would be many that would be baptized under repent repentance under John's baptism but then there come another time where they had to go and get re-baptized because they had to go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and today you could be baptized a thousand times under repentance and and and work and work and work but you're not accomplishing anything because that's not the word for this day you could try to go get purified under the blood of BS and goats and go out and sacrifice BS and goats all day long but God God has already sent a savior and shed his blood and entered in once and for all for your sin so so so it it would be work and vain it it it wouldn't be the program for today and and so today we're living in an astronaut Age and and you could try to get to the Moon with a horse and buggy but you're going to get pretty frustrated you could even try to get there with an airplane and you could fly around all day long trying to break into that orbit and but good luck getting to the Moon because that's not the program for this day you got to get in the spaceship and so you see me maybe some maybe not right now but maybe in the summertime you go to cut your lawn and you could go out there with a pair of scissors and you or you could take a herd of goats out there or you could try to one of those little SC things and try to cut your grass but it's going to be a lot more work but we're living in the age of the right riding lawn mower amen so you can take you can take your scissors out there and you can work all day long brother but instead of working you can just pull out your riding lawnmower and begin to ride on the on the word for this day amen and it reminds me of that Paul Raider me trying to cut down that tree and getting tired and getting weak and running out of strength am me but that voice of the boss would tell him Paul why don't you just roll it down to that River over there and start riding on it anden you see you can work and work and work and get so frustrated anden but why don't you just start riding on the program of God and Me in the program of God and mean you could try to pull yourself up by the bootstraps to get into this Rapture amen but if the same spirit that dwells in you quickens your mortal body it shall Quicken your mortal body I mean you could try to you could you you could fret and stew and fuss all day long about your children amen but the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house shall be saved amen so instead of working and working and working just get under the program for go for of God oh and begin to follow the beat of the word you you you could try to keep yourself day in and day night day in and uh uh and day out amen but when God seals you with the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that sealed you anden brother Brandon would say uh uh what is this the seal first thing it shows is a work that has been completed a completed work the next thing it shows is ownership and the next thing it shows is security keeping it so you can try to keep yourself but get in the program of God and you get the Holy Ghost and it'll keep you you won't you you you won't have to do it in your own ability just it's the program of God oh my brother B said I believe the honest in heart wants to see something real words are fine but will that word work if God made a promise of healing will it work if he made these promises will it work he said the things that I do shall you do also and more than this cuz I go to my father would it work well I'll tell you this it worked for Jesus and mean because brother Brandon would tell us the word was in the word right the current was in The Wire and this bride is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and brother Brandon would tell us the word is in the bride in the mind of Christ to know what he's once done with his word amen and and so as as the musicians come brother brandom said Satan's wire had no current in it it was dead Creeds it it won't current now you see on the on on the Temptation on the mount and mean Satan used scripture against the Lord and the Lord would respond it is also written and so it says it's the same wire Jesus used the father's word Satan used the father's word Satan was Satan Jesus was God that's the difference see it comes down to those right there those two seeds he said that's the true one is the Creed the other one is the word one is true and the other one is false one will produce it and the other one can't produce it do you get it same kind of wires now that's exactly right same wires Hebrews 2 we just got or Hebrews 4:2 we just got it like denominational like denominations Say by wisdom see denominations by wisdom says this the days of the current is passed you see I I if it's wired up wrong it will never work right you you could take a good wire and plug it in a bad outlet and you won't get no life I mean but if you could ever get it wired right I mean you you could ever get that word restored and placed in the bride and she's got the right ground she's grounded in Christ her faith is rooted and grounded in the word then it will produce what it said it will produce I me the word will work you see brother Brandon preached the message trying to do God a service without being in the will of God and he began to show that David tried to bring the ark back but he consulted the captains of hundreds and thousands and not the prophet Nathan that stood in the midst and so it was a true Revelation but it was wrong because it it wasn't God's channel for that work and so brother Brandon would begin to tell us that the word of the Lord sometimes he said you have to put it in the right place or it's not the will of the Lord see though it's the word of the Lord but he said let that soak deep and you'll get a general conception of what I'm trying to say and begins to show that it it a church couldn't place he said now he never does nothing except he first reveals it to his servants the prophet so he said there's no church no Methodist Baptist Pentecostals or anything else can ever put this church into the bride it'll have to be the answering of Malachi 4 for God to send a prophet to be revealed to so here it was here we were like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison Benjamin Franklin discovered electricity amen is that right but it it wasn't doing no good until they discovered how to harness it and make it work and put lights throughout this building so there had to be a Thomas Edison come along yeah begin to harness it and say I'll put this wire here and I'll put this wire here and this wire here and this ground here and then boom there's light amen and brother Brandon would come along and here they are those Pentecostals begin to discover the power of God but they would just blow it all off as Steam they weren't interested in Father's work they weren't about the father's business and mean they instead of taking that and making it work they would blow it all off a steam maybe they would get a hold of that anointing and say well let's go empty all the hospitals and let's go do this and that but they didn't maybe take the time to really say Lord what is your will what is father's business for this message amen but we could find that father's business would be to see this word be Vindicated Amen in a people Amen to vindicate Malachi 4 to vindicate Luke 17 to vindicate in the word for this day that somebody wouldn't just blow it all off as Steam but somebody would get that word inside and begin to channel it that it could work so a prophet comes on the scene and he says you know since I was young I I've always believed you know in the power of God and there's enough power in this building right now but the thing of it is can we find the right wire to current it to you and he would begin to say in all my time searching wires I've only found two wires that'll bring the power of God visible and Divine Healing and things and he said it's two wires it's love and it's faith will bring the power of God visible you see the power exists already in this building but a prophet would come along and say here you are if you just connect this and if you just get love and if you just get Faith it'll make that word work it'll produce healing it'll produce salvation and a Prophet come along and here was a church that had begin to receive the pouring out of the spirit and a prophet begin to place it and say here you are and me a a pastor you go to this position and a a prophet's in this position and and a pastor doesn't tell a prophet what to do and an evangelist doesn't tell a pastor what to do and what was going on a church was beginning to be placed wires were beginning to be placed here and here and all of a sudden oh there's a bride on the earth that this message is not just a form of godliness but the power thereof begin to explode and all a sudden the lights come on oh there's a bride amen that's about the father's business and the word works for her because the word is in the word the current is in the wire amen producing a bride oh that could be a worker in his will could we stand our feet this morning oh we don't want selfish motives we just need some real workers that'll get under this message and and keep the sayings of this message you see wise man built his house upon a rock and there come one day a rich young ruler who had kept all the Commandments of God but when he come to a junction where he was standing before the word and the word said forsake all and sell all that you have and give it to the poor take up your cross and follow me then that saying was too hard for him but there was another Rich Young Ruler named Moses who accepted the leadership of the word and when he come down to the end of his Road brother brandom talked about that Rich Young Ruler he said when he come to down to the end of his Road there was nowhere to step he'd refuseed leadership but when Moses come down to the end of the road he said he talks about how his leadership was right there his leadership The Rock and he could step right onto that rock Christ oh and when there was no Egypt when there was no task Masters when there was no more bricks and straw still there will be a Moses because Moses accepted the leadership and he was built upon a rock and me and we have received a leadership in this hour amen and it brother brandom me he spoke not as the scribes but as one having Authority and me because it was more than a man it was the son of man a son of man revealing the son of man a word of authority that has come into our AIDs that if we'll just keep the sayings of this word I believe it's the leadership that'll get us beyond the curtain of time I believe it's the leadership that'll get us there on that day that's right say Lord I don't just want to keep the easy sayings I want to keep all of the sayings I don't just want to keep some of them but when it really Pricks my heart when it really Cuts deep I want to keep those ones too Lord and maybe we could just all bow our heads just as we close in prayer believe we need some real workers like David's mighty men that would be about the father's business that his his least desire would be our Command say Lord if you want somebody to believe every word here am I Lord Lord your least desire is my command if you want somebody to to to forgive and ask for forgiveness here am I Lord if you want somebody Lord to stand and preach the gospel unashamed and not add or take away here am I Lord Lord I want to be a worker in your will Lord maybe I've got off the road but I want to Center myself back in the will of God oh and the Bible brother Brandon would tell us that whosoever shall keep all these Commandments and do these things will have a right to the tree of life amen so don't be weary and well-doing now's not the time to be weary and well doing but as the prophet would have that because you have chosen the narrow path in the heart harder way thou has walked of your own choosing but it would tell them you have picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way and because of that momentous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits thee Oh My on that day I believe there will be a people who won't hear the words depart from me ye that work iniquity iniquity and me but enter into the joys of the lord well done good and faithful servant and when brother brandom said as we as every eyes closed and every head is bowed he he in the Ephesian Church age he says if God had that against this church he's got it against that one too because you left your first love I've got it against you I have something against you that's my complaint you once had a great time but you let the world begin to creep in and you got to acting a little formal you're still holding my name you're still doing the things that's right you got a lot of patience and so forth and you labor you're like a mule you just labor and work he says my my my see you've left Grace and Faith and power to swap it for labor and works well I tell you brother brandom I help every widow woman I can well that's a good thing I commend you for that but where's that first love you once had where's that Joy you used to have as David once cried oh Lord restore to me the joy of my salvation where's them all night prayer meetings and tears on your cheeks my goodness the Bible's even Dusty got cobwebs on it you read old love stories and news and things and things that oughtn't to even be allowed to be published and put out for a trash can and we Pentecostal people picked them up and just Loft over them like a bunch of flies on a garbage can he says that's right oh mercy what we need is back to our first love back to Pentecost amen maybe that's where am me your desire this morning Lord I want to be a worker but Lord I I've let distractions get in my way I maybe I I've got a little away Lord and I pray Lord that you restore the joy of my salvation Lord that you restore the first love I I I've got to where it's just works just going through the motions sometimes it feels like and Lord I want to get back that feeling I want to get back that where the presence of God comes down in my home in my car amen God bless the hands let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for your mercy and your grace this morning Lord what a wonderful congregation father Lord it just so wonderful Lord to preach this word to them Father just Lord what a great caliber of people and father each one of us Lord desire to be closer to you Lord sometimes we get off the beaten path we we get distracted with work Lord we're workers and sometimes we get distracted with the work father but may we never forget Lord that you want us on the altar Lord you want our time Lord you want our fellowship you want our worship Lord may we never get so distracted with the emotions of the work Lord that we fail to give you the praise and the the honor that you deserve Lord and we begin to lose sight Lord your presence becomes a little distant from us father I pray that you restore Joy I pray you restore close walks Lord with each individual Lord that's my desire a closer walk with you father Lord we want to start right if there be one in here this morning that's not Lord maybe they're not even got on the right foundation maybe they're Lord not even got the Holy Ghost but father I believe Lord there's not Lord there's no better time like now than to start right Lord sometimes it looks so daunting father this Christian walk seems like Lord we see the pastor and it seems like he's so far in a walk but Lord how did he get there Lord he had to take the first step and then he had to take the second step and by the leadership of the message of the hour it could take him to where he's at and father maybe there's one here this morning that needs to take that first step maybe some need to take that second step that third step but Lord May everyone no matter where they're at help us Lord that if we just follow the leadership of the program of God for this day Lord I believe it'll take us all the way home may you grant it Lord and bless this congregation today in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless bless you this morning you may take one by
