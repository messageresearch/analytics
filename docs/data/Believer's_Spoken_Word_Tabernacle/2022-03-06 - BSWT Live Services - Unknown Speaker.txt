thing that you should rise even from this moment is is to take a confidence and a certainty that god keeps his promises because he has taken his word and he has shaken it right before us it's god that takes it right there before your heart don't wait another day don't wait another moment give your all to him right now this is this is the moment this is a time of complete surrender to almighty god

friends even in this hour where we're at we're not living and just walking around lives that have already you know when life those of us that's already crossed over into the new birth there's an urgency in our lives in this hour it's time to leave let me tell you something it's time to leave complexes it's time to leave that old nature it's time to leave hurts it's time to leave unforgive me

got authority to cast your cares on him why cause he careth for you let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you are so mindful of this hour lord that we're in so precious lord jesus father what a what an awesome time that we are living in lord for the world oh my it's a lord it's just a terrible time for the world lord my heart breaks just to see him lord and false security and then to see lord just just running scared oh god but i think also lord those lord that's still in those systems god help us to get everyone out help us to reach that last one help us god it may not be lord it may not be what we can say i find lord god it isn't our words it isn't our words but it's your presence lord it's your presence lord as you would come you would lord god just speak to that person's life maybe it's a loved one maybe it's a co-worker oh god right here lord i'm speaking no doubt to daniel's that the lord god are in position in place maybe in some places lord that they have not chose to be some positions but i pray father god may they be available to you may we all be available to you looking to the mercies of god lord if there's a word that we can drop most of all may it be the expression of your own life it's not how good we can explain the word lord reality if we're able and somebody's able to come by an explanation somebody else will have another explanation it must be something lord that goes so much deeper lord god we look to you father [Music] we ask the lord god right here this morning lord i know undoubtedly there's lives that are right here under the sound of my voice whether here by way of internet or god that need they're in need of that real that real experience with you in need lord of coming under the safety of the blood lord to where their life lord is completely transformed they'll be battles but they've got a strength on the inside there's a love affair between you and them that though temptation can arise there's a dove on the inside that will lead them and give them strength through that temptation things the lord god that you would manifest through their life overcoming power oh god granted may you move lord i pray for every brother and sister young and old lord all that are gathered here lord i pray that father right here in this time in your presence [Music] may the lord god cast their cares upon you may they take lord life lord god and say lord i deliver i i give my life to you lord i surrender it lord to you lord god it takes your presence to come to bring that release into a life to where that they would surrender lord i ask right now maybe that same comforter spirit of truth the lord god has come and spoke this message this morning now lord god as you've already been making visits to hearts and lives may they on the end may they on the inside open the door may they open it oh god say lord jesus come in fully lord i don't want you just to come in lord where i'm just saved from my sins i don't want you just to come in to where you stand on a carpet and but you can't touch this and you can't touch that [Music] but i want you to come in fully i want you to have every door of my life jesus every room of my life is available to you [Music] i want you to have the uppermost seat the preeminence in my life really lord i pray may that just drop with such a certainty lord god that even in this moment lord as they would go even in prayer in their hearts lord such a certainty lord god that's stirring in their hearts that this is the moment that this is the season lord god oh lord jesus this is not a work up friends this is the presence of the living god speaking with certainty a moment of time to where you can put your foot down you can have uncertainty when you approach the promise of god if there's anything get it get it cleared out repent [Music] and if you when you fully surrender he'll fully come in he will he will that's his promise but samuel what should i look for well i'll tell you the after effects of it because the experience itself is the same of passing from death onto life the venue might be a little different the way everything exactly and the experiences and everything but there is one thing that is sure you pass from death into life that the desires and the things that you once had in your life you no longer have and he has become your all in all he is your life for he has given you life lord god right here lord this morning i know there's sickness around us i think lord of our sister linda lord they're in the hospital that lord god that sickness is an enemy that's gathered around her there's other setting right here lord god i know they're sitting here this morning they're in pain i know that [Music] lord god suffering different ones with afflictions in their body some suffering lord with afflictions in their spirit oh god it doesn't matter lord if it's there in the flesh they're in the spirit they're in the mind they're in the soul i'm the lord that healeth all that diseases lord jesus you're here right here among us lord father i pray [Music] god that you would move lord not only for sister linda there in the hospital lord we believe that you are lord god we ask the lord for her and lord for every other need lord that's gathered here some lord god that are across the internet lord god father we lift them up lord before the throne of almighty god whether it's a sickness in their body lord a trial that they're facing lord a test or a circumstance where the enemy is all around them lord god but i pray father right now lord [Music] may they lord take a look from the vantage point placed upon that rock lord god where there might be some that's a little weak in their faith then lord god i can stand here there's others can stand with me and we can let god express lord taking of our faith and say there is victory in the camp this morning there is healing in the camp this morning there is deliverance in the camp this morning jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever he cares about you he cares about your sickness he cares about your feeling he cares about your need he loves you and he cares for you oh granny lord god may we look lord may we live lord god for living in that vantage point set me up on a rock now shall my head be lifted up god i pray this morning may the dynamics of the holy ghost move lord and surge through the body lord even while we stood here and ministering lord and just sensing the pulsation of the holy ghost lord as you've taken the meeting lord god that's the desire that we've had when we've come here in this service is that the holy ghost would take the service this morning lord god and take us lord god from a physical address of 1530 lake breeze road sheffield ohio and lord god would pack us away into the heavenlies lord god would pack us the lord god away father [Music] granted lord may a surge of the dynamics of almighty god move through that life right now granny

cod you're going to die if you lay there oh i say this morning why set we here till we die [Music] let's take the word of the lord if all you can do is wiggle your finger right now go ahead and wiggle
