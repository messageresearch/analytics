want to talk about this evening Lord Jesus there is no one like you so no one is of the quality no one is as awesome no one is as wonderful no one is as loving as him and that's what we're stating when we sing this and that no one else presumably because that there is no one like him no one else has the ability to touch my heart in the way that you can God so just think about let's just I want to sing that one more time and I just want to think about that for a moment that no one else is like you God and no one else can touch me and help me and be with me in the way that you can because they can't touch who you [Music] are F there [Music] you oh all together with your heart is there is none like you oh no one else can't touch my heart like you do you do I could search Eternity long

bless the name of the Lord Jesus tonight father we welcome you in our midst father and ask that you would just have your way oh God we bless the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen if you if you would you go ahead and take your seats for a moment I thought I'd sing another song we haven't practiced this one [Music] either but just a song I heard not too long ago when I thought my this uh really speaks the song is titled run to the father oh yeah amen [Music] I've carried a bird for too long on my own I wasn't create to Bear it alone I hear your invitation to let it all go yeah I see it now I'm laying it down and I know that I need you I run to the father I fall into Grace I'm done with the hiding no reason to wait my heart needs a surgeon my soul needs a friend so I'll run to the father again and again again and again oh oh oh you saw my condition had a plan from the Star your son for [Music] Redemption the price for my heart I don't have a context for that kind of love I don't understand I can't comprehend all I know is eyes need you I run to the father I fall into Grace I'm done with the hiding no reason to wait my heart needs a surgeon my soul needs a friend so I'll run to the father again and again and again and again oh oh oh oh and again and again oh oh oh I need your sight long before my first breath running into your arms is running to life from death oh I feel this Rush deep in my chest your mercy is falling out just as I am you pull me in and I know I need you now I run to the father I fall into Grace I'm done with the hiding no reason to wait my heart needs a surgeon my soul needs a friend so I'll run to the father again and again father I fall into Grace I'm done with the hiding no reason to wait my heart found a suron my soul all found a friend so I'll run to the father again and again and again and again oh oh oh and again and again amen amen amen amen thank you musicians you know I think what what speaks to me that song you know I was I was telling um I think it was brother Ben I was telling you know I might be 44 years old but thank you yeah I was um someone asked if I was Zion's brother thank you um but I I said you know and and I I believe that there's I believe I'm not weird I think that a lot of people are are kind of like me and that though we get older there's that little person you know that that little boy inside that little girl inside right maybe I'm just being too vulnerable right now and no one else wants to admit anything like that but I feel like I'm still that 20-year-old like a bit uncertain at times you know and we're just kind of going we're just going with this it's like are you sure no well you look sure well it's just honed art you know and uh you know cuz I was I was I was telling him about brother Samuel and I was like you know brother Samuel to me is like I'm like impressed you know like I'm like this is my Elder not like super right but I mean like like he's been a pastor for so long you know I'm standing behind his pull pit you know like there's some differences here you know he can quote the message and con conversation like nobody's business you know and I'm like I mean I know the message but I just can't quite you know it's uh wow you know you know and yet when I when I call him up on the phone you know he's like hey buddy and I'm like like really like I'm I'm at buddy status like this is awesome you know cuz like cuz I you know cuz that little little boy inside you know is is still like wow how could How could a brother like this consider me like a peer like just like one of his buddies and his friend and but I think that that is just indicative and that's just me being super vulnerable and it's indicative of you know what this song I think was saying is that is that there's that small person on the inside of all of us that we just have to run to our father sometimes because the uncertainty that we Face the we don't know what it is and we don't always have it all under control and we don't always and it's I don't know sometimes but Lord I'm just going to run to you because I know that you can take care of the problems amen so anyway so that's just kind of how that song just uh speaks to me is that I I I don't I'd like to project that I'm somebody big and important and have it all together but and that's that's just not the case right amen so I'm I'm just thankful that that I have a father I can run to amen all right so all right so go ahead and stand with me if you would I've been told some of you didn't remember your Bibles so I do have it on this lines so um if you would like to turn to Genesis chapter 2 and verse 18 those of you that were here this morning should be very familiar with this passage and the other thing I was going to mention is is um is the ritual that Pastor do and you all think that perhaps it has something to do with like oh we just oh it's so wonderful we acknowledge all the ministers in our midst and that's that's lovely and and it's really really has nothing to do with them it's a hazing ritual that we do um to the minister who's about to come up it's like oh let's point out all the ministers in the congregation that are going to be judging the next guy who's about to come up here it's not intimidating at all I preach for brother I preach for brother um Scott Smith in in uh in Lenor North Carolina um and um and I didn't know anybody there I had never even met Brother Scott before he called me and said yeah I've heard good things so why don't you come on down and I was like okay that's that's amazing and wonderful but praise the Lord I'm I'm in um and uh and then he proceeded to get up and it kind of special meeting so he I mean I was like look who's not a minister in the congregation would have been a shorter list you know and I knew no one and I was just like oh this is help us Lord why is my timer there okay all right so Genesis Chapter 2 Verse 18 we've got the slides praise the Lord so and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him and help meet for him um I'd like to just talk on the topic of loneliness this morning we talked about alone and and don't worry this sermon will stand on its own if you need anything from this morning service I will bring it back in so don't worry about that but we talked about alone this morning so we want to look at loneliness this evening can we just go to the Lord in prayer father um your scripture is still speaking to us Lord there's so many truths that we can extract out of each and every line Lord and I pray that tonight you would do that again Lord as we look looked at it from one angle um this morning I pray that you would uh bring out the context of this from a different angle Lord Jesus and that Lord that this would be a help to people that they would see you in a greater way Lord God and that we would look and find in you Lord that sum total of all satisfaction is in you Lord God and so father we're looking for that we pray that you would Minister to the hearts of the people and just use me Lord to speak in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray amen amen and you may be seated so I'm happy to be here again and we had a really good time a year ago and preached on um finding the will of the Lord and um I I thought I did a terrible job but everybody said seemed to be blessed by it so um well praise the Lord you guys don't need much I guess and just say say the things the Lord wants you to say and it doesn't have to be smooth okay well thank you I appreciate that so so this morning we talked about this and and I just want to kind of bring this back in really quickly to set the stage but we talked about how this scripture was is is really that the rest of scripture is predicated upon this right here because we have creation and creation had a purpose and what was what was Genesis 1:1 one in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth and we can say well why why did he do that and so if you can look and you begin to see that you know as I said this morning God didn't stop at kangaroos you know if God would have stopped at kangaroos you would have meant like apparently the point of creation was kangaroos God wanted something but God didn't stop at kangaroos he created all of this and when he got to man that is when he stopped creating which indicates to us that he had finally finished what he had started to do that the that the reason for and then he gives man dominion over the Kangaroos and everything else right so so so the point of all of that was that man would be there and then he says wow you know what it's good that man shouldn't be alone and I asked the question it's like how does God know this and it's more than just God well he he ran the scenarios and he realized that it'd be better that you know man had somebody to be with because you know 100 Years of him being alone we understood this through for knowledge and I realized you know he was lonely and so it'd be better if he had someone he he knew it more than just that he knew it more than just because he's God and he knows stuff like that but he knew it because he could because he created man in his own image and he knew that he he if he created to express attributes that he could be made known and to know then then Man created on the same grounds also wanted those to know and to be made known and this morning we talked about the expression and how to make yourself known is to express yourself in the same way that God himself expressed himself and so so we see this scripture that it's it's not good that man should be alone and and so but I want to look at this from a slightly from this topic of now loneliness and we're going to look at the differences because just merely being alone doesn't mean you're lonely is that okay all right so so I want to ask for a moment you know before God created everything was he lonely it's a fun question you know the answer brother Trevor not really I I don't was he lonely like I well he wanted to have Fellowship so then there must have been a desire in there now we look at now now this is something that we we're we're going to get into and I don't want to you know sell the point too early but but what you know loneliness as we look at that like what is that what how is that see but but we want to recognize it's not always a negative we look at loneliness always in the negative it's the the one of the worst things in the world is loneliness and hey I'm not disagreeing with that at all but what causes loneliness from what desires within you is is is loneliness uh being expressed out of okay so God had the desire in him to to make himself known and to be known so there was a desire there that you could say maybe wouldn't got all the way to the to what we would call loneliness but God no longer wanted to be alone so I'm not saying that he was sitting in the corner and rocking back and forth I'm so lonely no one likes me it's like well well Lord there is no one else right so if you created someone maybe you'd have some people to like you right so so so God I'm not saying that God was doing that but what I'm saying is there's a desire in God to not be alone and he wanted the fellowship so he creates man you know and and and it's it's not like it's not like what is loneliness a bit more like it's not just that you know there's people around right because God could have just you know God had created angels you know God could have just created a bunch of adoring fans oh God you're so amazing you know it's like would you guys like this we don't know but you're so amazing God you know and they and they were and and and if God would have created you know people to just to just automatically be there and worship him and tell him how awesome he was and every he wouldn't have been alone would he have but even though he wouldn't have been alone do you think that that well it couldn't have because he didn't just create you know adoring fans he created people on the basis of free moral agency who could choose him and so if he did that then it was more than just having more people there to you know be around but it was that there was something that that was doing that was satisfying a desire on the inside so God doesn't merely create to have humans there to have adoring fans but he creates man in his own image like him right so that so that the response of the way God would respond to his own self would be there woo that's a now we just suddenly got real deep now but you know you understand where we're going now is that in order to satisfy that desire for that kind of Fellowship it was more than just beings being there but it was someone that could satisfy the relationship that God was looking for that there was a there was a and and we understand it as a deep to and a deep to respond to a deep right and we we think of that always from our perspective you know is that Lord there's something in me Desiring and I'm calling out after you and brother Bram says if there's a deep there there's a deep to respond well okay flip that now right it was it was a deep responding to a deep it was a desire that is like a well that it that wants to draw in and what responds to that the same desire that's like a well that wants to draw in so both want to draw in but both give out to themselves and I I think that you know God didn't say you know it was a deep and then there was there was there was a a a water trough to respond to the to the well that you had that was empty that's not what that's not what he said it was a deep it was a drawing sensation a desire of pulling that that responded to a desire of pulling so it's the same on both sides it's not there's there's a thing that needs something and here's the thing that has something both need and both have woo so so this is turning out very different than I was thinking okay so we need more than it's more than just people it's more than just people around it's more than just beings there but it's be it's it's those who have inside of them the qualities that can satisfy that need for fellowship and that need for connectedness and this is what God has created you and I for is to have that connectedness from him and with him all right so he he decides I'm going to give Adam a help meat someone who can someone because God God is Supernatural and God is in spirit and you know we know God will Express all of his characters into Jesus Christ and that that is going to come but at this point in time God there is is spirit and he's he he's a logos so he's knowable but yet he's not there in flesh and so so in order to teach man about himself self he creates he puts the world here and he creates the situations and he gives us the words that we might learn to know him that's what is this if it's not about getting to know him you know what is this if it is not getting to getting to know his Doctrine no I mean yes but the but what like take the next step the doctrine is to know him right I mean we talked about we talked about no eternal hell this is message Doctrine this morning the whole idea of no eternal hell is to show is merely to show it's not punishment it's relationship it's have you chose the relationship or haven't you so the doctrine is to show him so so what he's doing is he's placing man here on Earth and he's now he's he's setting up he's setting up the architecture and as we said he's even allowing for evil so that his great love can be expressed to its full fullest extent because without sin and everybody's perfect everybody's just easy to love and now love isn't known the way it could be known and so he allows for evil so that you can you you now can experience the great love of God to love someone who's unlovable because we recognize you know in the Garden of Eden they what they understood before the fall was that God loves those that are perfect I mean they didn't really know what perfect meant CU they didn't have the contrast but then the contrast comes and now they learn that God loves more than just the perfect that that God's love is so great it can love those who are imperfect am I talking to someone tonight now God loves those that are imperfect how many are imperfect how many know that God loves them despite of their imperfection it's actually what what what you are doing is literally manifesting the way that God might be able to make his great love [Applause] known and you're you're part of that and so God God wants to express that and so God wanting us to learn who he is wanting us to learn the relationship with him puts man and he says you know what if I don't give Adam a helpmate if I don't I've made him like me but like me means I made someone I wanted Fellowship I need Adam to understand how I feel about him so I'm going to create a bride for him taken from his very his very elements from his everything about him he he's taking the like the little spoonful of the ocean out of Adam all the qualities that are there and from his side he takes those qualities and he puts them in a bride so that he can show Adam this is the desire I have with you I want you to experience this because this is a type of what I want with you and the desires that you're feeling I want you to understand those I want you to grow in love for this woman because and I want her to grow in love with you and I want I want you guys to understand and to meet the friendship and the fellowship and the love desires that you have with one another because I want you to understand in the Physical Realm the spiritual type the spiritual and Supernatural relationship that I want with you prise the Lord so there's a natural manifestation of a spiritual truth so so so then in one sense to have a person that is your spouse is to cure loneliness is to show what loneliness is and isn't and in another sense it is not because it is not merely that because look look here's the thing if Eve would have solved Adam's loneliness and she would have perfectly solved that would Adam ever have said well but there's still something in me that's calling out Hallelujah there still a deep here all we both had deeps but there's a deep that both of us now have that's still calling out for more and if that relationship would have solved that then then then then Adam not would not have Adam just wouldn't have met like well you know I've got Eve I'm good thank you God that was nice of you to provide her we're happy now appreciate that don't need you anymore I am so satiated in my desire that I've had that because you've given me Eve that God I I just there's there's there's no room left for you God I I I I just hardly desire you anymore is that possible no no there's lots of jokes that could go there but we're going to leave those alone we're going to go on loneliness Hebrews chapter 6 number three brother brandom says' oh the grace of God that changed this nature give me the opportunity to desire the opportunity to desire and to Crave and to thirst thy love kindness is better to me than life oh God my heart will long after thee David said as the heart panteth for the water book so my soul thirsts after thee Oh God God gave man that thirst to worship him to love and seek after him but man perverts it by the call of the devil and he goes in lusts after women and pleasures and things of the world trying to satisfy that Holy creation that God has put in to love him you see the desire within you that is the deep that is calling out for more than what is in you is a holy creation that God has put there can I say it this way to make it very plain that the the desire that you have that turns into loneliness if not dealt with appropriately is and and and again we think loneliness we think oh that's terrible it's bad it's one of the worst things ever and and and of course but but the desire that caused that loneliness is a holy creation that God put in there to love him he places it upon the things of the world but brother once he's changed that fountain with Wiggle tailes all kinds of disorders of the sistern has been cleansed out and sterilized and the pure water of God is put in there sin can never touch it all right so what is the fountain the the the the fountain here that's calling out for the Waters of God it is this well inside of you that God placed there a desire within you that is that is there and it is wanting to receive something it is Desiring and calling out to receive something and God has the water to put in to put in there and you have the water to put into God and so so so so what we're looking for is we're looking for God to be the ultimate satisfaction of all of these desires that we have in our lives amen now now now that's a powerful statement but it's kind of like we it's like we brother Trevor um Christians like I think everybody in here is a Christian and we should basically get that concept that God satisfies everything amen we're together on that okay that's good so then I I guess I don't have to preach this I don't know what I'm doing but but what is what is sin then sin in our lives is is a manifestation of unbelief we know that but what what is the unbelief that that is there the unbelief ultimately is is that you do not believe that God or you do not act in a way that says you believe that God is the ultimate satisfaction of the desires on the inside of your heart because if you don't believe that not only in know know form but truly on the inside of you to say like look I recognize I I'm feeling this way I have a desire that I want to fill and but I'm just not it's yeah but there's things over here that I'm pretty sure are going to satisfy that you know I mean have you ridden roller coasters thrilling you know but brother brandom said I think that ought to be the thrill of the church is for man to pray until he gets into the presence of God so so I mean when's the last time you prayed and got yourself into the presence of God that your heart rate came up as much as going 80 M an hour straight down yeah I can see it may be a little bit different in application but it has it been thrilling to you has it been something that you sought after I'm I'm I man I just I just have a penchant for a little bit of thrill and a little bit of action today so you know what I'm going to do I'm going to pray and I hate to throw this after this but said no one ever right I mean like should have said yes did probably not If we're honest are we are we doing that and so so so what is sin see see that's what that's what the the God has put desires on the inside of us it's a holy desire that must be there because if we didn't have it we wouldn't desire after God but what sin is is sin is coming and trying to replace the Fulfillment of that desire with anything but the one who created himself to be the Fulfillment of that desire and so when we go after things of the world or even good things in our lives and put them and want them to be the source of our fulfillment we've got problems mothers have have dealt with this many many times because mothers have felt like if I have children and I can raise children in the in the admonition of God then I will feel fulfilled and they've left and they've grow their children have been raised and they're like but I don't feel the Fulfillment that I thought I'd feel and it's because they replaced maybe a Godly thing to raise your children in the admonition of God but they've but they've wanted the the act of doing that to be the Fulfillment in their life and they've they've been found empty because they ow they put that as an idol above their relationship with God being the thing that satisfies the hunger of their hearts all right so so but God is the pure water and when it gets in there sin can't touch it and when I'm talking about Sin here I'm not talking about the filthy things of the world but I'm talking about anything that is the replacement of of of the the satisfaction that we can receive from being in the presence of God from knowing the word of God from believing that he is who he says he is and is longing for us and wants to be there to satisfy that every desire amen so I was a little worried we were at dinner the other day and I you know mentioned my title to brother Samuel and he's like oh and brother Barry was here in March he talked about you know being alone you know never being alone and I was like really really so I'm just going to repeat everything brother Barry said that's nice that's really good everybody's just going to know like oh he's a brother Barry clone he's just so I listened to his sermon and it was nothing like this but he did say something that I'll I'll I'll call your attention back to and I believe he may have said it again at winter youth retreat and maybe many of you young people were there but but he said we shouldn't feel bad for feeling bad and the reason and the reason that's true is because inside of you God put that desire and it is a holy thing that he did so you are going to have times and praise God you'll have times where you are feeling unsatisfied now I get I get it that it's not your standard fair for preaching these days but you're going to have these times but that can be a good thing if if it's motivating you in the right direction what those things are saying is is that maybe God is there feeling that that the Deep that's over there the deep that you have is just feeling a little empty right now and maybe the Deep that's up there is saying you know what I'm feeling just a little empty and if we can get the two together my we're going to have something so so it's so that see what we have to understand is is that desire we shouldn't you you don't have to feel bad for having the desire God put the desire there what that desire should and those feelings should begin to do is to begin to push you in the direction of the answer and the satisfaction of it amen so in Psalm 25:16 David says turn unto turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for I am desolate or sometimes rendered lonely and Afflicted so David himself is crying out to God now we recognize he's going to the right Source but I want us to understand look at his language I am desolate I God right now I am in a dry place I'm desolate God I feel lonely and Afflicted right now God didn't know David was such a sinner such a lame believer no he was human like you and I like these Heroes of the faith were they that different were they that different you know maybe you're having a time like Joseph where you're in you're in prisoned you can look and and recognize what God has said it's like yeah but I mean you if I was in prison right now I mean I'm not Joseph so there's no way I could respond respond in the same way why because Joseph was just written about in the Bible and that somehow makes him elevated these were real people lived on the same Earth that you and I do they were no different so if David can say I am desolate lonely and Afflicted hey you think you'll never be that way you think you'll never feel that way it's all right but at least David is going and he he's recognizing if I'm feeling this way I have to turn I have to go this way now there are times that David did not turn that direction Psalm 63:1 a Psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is and I just love to think about this from the poetic element you know is that here David is he's expressing this in song He's expressing this in Poetic language you know it's it's not it's he's not just saying Lord I'm sitting here in the middle of a Sandy dry desert and I'm longing for you it's too bad I don't have a bottle of water if I had a bottle of water this Psalm would be different because then I wouldn't be so dry it's look half the songs we sing have poetic language like this that we that we that we interpret far differently than that right so David is saying look look Lord I am right now I am in a place God not not in a physical place but God you know I'm just we we have the expression you know he was in a really dark place it's like that doesn't mean he was in a basement with the lights off does it right so David David is in a place he's like God right now I am in a dry and thirsty land I'm in a season right now God where I feel dry I feel like I there's something that isn't good that I I I need water God I can tell Lord I I when people come I react a little oh I've got some edges God that need some sanding down to make them a little soft but you know and our our pastor preached the other day about you know a cactus is just you know it was a it was a nice plant that was a soft plant that just didn't have water for very very long and then the leaves twisted up and dried up and shriveled up to a point and sometimes we get Lord I am in a dry place and when people come around me they are getting pricked and I don't want to be that way Lord I need some water God and so David though but look at the response of David David though he recognizes exactly where he is and but he's saying but God so I know I've recognized Lord I need to get up a little earlier and seek you my soul has got to thirst first after you oh God my flesh oh God has to long after you instead of all of the other things that my flesh could long for oh God I I need my flesh to long after you I need all of me to long after you oh God because right now my soul is just thirsty I've got to have more oh God so so though there's a Triumph in here he's like oh God Thou Art my God early will I seek thee and we look at that and we think my look at this man David this is a man who knows the source of everything that he needs and he's going to that man but we don't often look at the fact that David but he was a man who needed stuff and and we've got to we've got to recognize sometimes when we're sitting there and we need something we can have the same reaction as David and and and instead of you know get in a little corner and feel sorry for oursel but yet we can recognize God you are my God it's it's okay I don't have I don't have to I know the source I'm a little prickly but I know the source there's a deep that's calling but I know the source amen so what is the answer then to loneliness well God yes amen so John 16:32 and3 I'll just leave that there for a bit behold the hour cometh yay and is now come that ye shall be scattered every man to his own and shall leave me alone this is Jesus talking to the disciples before before he he's there and uh before the crucifixion and and he says and yet I am not alone Lord because the father is with me I am not alone though physically he he became alone but the father be uh because the father is with me these things have I spoken unto you that ye might have peace Amen in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world so he spoke to them and said look there's going to come a time when you're going to leave me there's coming a time when I am myself am going to be alone though I am God in flesh I am going to be alone but yet I will not be alone because the father is always with me these things these things have I spoken to you that you might have peace because there's going to be times when all men will leave you and you will be alone you will be in a dark place you will be in a dry and thirsty land and you will you'll look around and say but no one is with me all around I see Roman soldiers and Sanhedrin members accusing me but yet I have told you so that you could have peace you will not be alone because the father will be with you amen so just like Jesus here we are as being expressions of who he was we we we exist by by a new birth on the same playing field on the same same plane in in existence as Jesus Christ himself because we have the life of God the literal life of God is living inside of our being when you have a new birth all right the the difference is you don't have perfect flesh like he did but otherwise you have the same life so you can have the same things the same desires the same connection with the father yourself that you can have and he spoke these things and showed you these things that you could have peace in those times it won't be fun it won't be it won't be a you know just a walk in the park no it was a it was a walk down to the judgment all but you wouldn't be alone thank so how do we cure loneliness have God Amen we don't worry we're going to break it down more okay so but before we can like before we can answer what what's the cure look maybe we need to dive in and really understand what loneliness actually is is that all right and to to just take a pivot here and and and just ask a few questions and begin to look into this just a little bit and and so I I want to ask you this does loneliness rob you of Joy can loneliness and joy exist in the same person or is loneliness like let's just be real tonight I mean you had Brothers whever come preach like it's going to be that way so open thine heart because we're going to Dive Right In and you know start chopping so does does loneliness is loneliness a black hole of joy does it Rob if if if one is feeling lonely does it Rob you of all joy that you might have in your life because there are times when we feel that way don't we we feel like it is a black hole we feel like it is robbing all joy from me and I I'm I'm I'm powerless to to do anything I need someone I need something's got to come and change this for me and I would say well what is that thing right so so think through it think through one of the last times you've been lonely think one through one of the last times you were sitting there you were alone and you you were feeling feelings of loneliness and you certainly were like Joy is a very long way away from me and and and and what am I going to do and back in the back of your mind you were like well God has to do this but is that what you wanted come on you you you wanted god with skin on it as we say so often typically that's what we want is is we want god with skin on it to come and to take away the loneliness I need to be around people I need to I need someone to come and and but but but what we're actually saying is is I need someone to come and be God to me to to to to to take to take the place of God to satisfy the desires that I am feeling in my heart right now and there's no way I'll feel any Joy unless someone comes and does that or I have a nice pizza and go to bed sometimes that helps helps me sometimes okay you know hey I was 15 once too okay so but I think that's not a good way to look at it and I think we that's that's a product of the negativity that we've fallen into in those moments and we've allowed you know our we' have allowed that the devil to lie to us in those moments to say you can't you you this oh you're feeling lonely it can be no joy for you until the loneliness question is satisfied you are alone and there's nothing you can do about it I'm I'm look I'm human too I mean like how does he know it's happened to me right so so is loneliness merely the state of being alone of not having another individual in your life or individuals in your life is it more than just that because often that is so so so what we're what what I'm trying to present here is is our thoughts about loneliness and trying to get real um you know real deep and honest with our own lives to recognize that in those Seasons where we feel lonely what well we understand that God is the source and the the just the wonderful deep that can respond to that deep in our lives but yet when we're in those times of loneliness that is the farthest thing from our mind we we we we conceptually know that but we actually don't believe that and so I I want to take some time to just really look at that and and to understand our own our own selves a little bit more to see how you know and maybe debunk some of the you know the patterns that we get into where we try to solve the questions of loneliness and so so I would just like to ask um of the married people here well we won't ask you to raise your hands we don't want to cause problems but of the married people here and I'm going to just tell you you young people so that we don't cause marriage problems you're just going to have to believe the answer when I tell you that this is how everyone feels like has anyone you know been married and ever felt lonely hey people whose wives are not here um are answering in the affirmative marriage young people doesn't solve loneliness now it helps and this is why God created Eve from Adam and that's wonderful and that was helpful but it did not again it didn't if it solved that question if it solved that desire completely then man wouldn't continue to desire for God so so we have to understand this is an Avenue that God gave us to help with that to to be that this would be wonderful and and and amazing however the source but do not forget the source the source is him so if you can be married and and yet you know you look marriage doesn't cure loneliness you know if you have your spouse or your person your soulmate whatever modern phrase We want to use doesn't keep you from loneliness then what does keep you from loneliness well it's got to be more than just having someone else around and and so and we're going to talk about that a little bit but let's talk about some like like we we want things to be tangible right I mean we that's one of the things we that's as we talk about you know that's why when we say it's like well what solves loneliness and it's like God it's like we know the answer but then we want to talk about like how how does that work and the first thing that comes into our mind is like well if God would just have some skin on it and come into my life then that would then God would solve the loneliness in my life and well maybe that would help some and oh that was something outside I was like what in the world is a speaker doing and and so and so but that's some one of the things that we look for and and again like I recognize like we know that it's one of this like Sunday school all over again it's like it's like you all know the right answer and you can answer the right answer in church but then you go out and you live your life and your life isn't expressing the right answer right and so here's another one and we talked this morning we talked about video games and we talked about you know all of the so all of the you know psychological tricks in a video game and social medias and things like that you know you've got the thumbs up you've got the hearts you've got the i l Ys sm's you know people respond to one another I love you so much with three heart emojis and you know unless it's you know maybe I don't love them that much and then it's blue instead of red and you know all the tricks and things like that that we do you know and and then in video games you know you have achievement unlocked and what that is telling you is that you've actually done something worth doing and the video game is rewarding you and it has to do that to you because if it doesn't tell you that that you've unlocked an achievement and it hasn't if it hasn't told you you've done a good job you would have absolutely no idea that you had done a good job because you hadn't actually done anything yet except for moved you know white boxes into green boxes or something like that it's like coou you're amazing like achievement unlocked you can do the white boxes to the green boxes good that's so wonderful so they so so because they know that they have to they have to tell you you're amazing keep going and I'll tell you you're amazing again because there's absolutely no way that you could tell otherwise and so so so but yet but don't like but it works and it works on us who know that God is the answer to our loneliness that God is the answer to our desires but yet people can spend all kinds of money on psychological tricks through screens and try to emulate the feeling of hey you don't have to be you don't have to be lonely because your video game Clan is here for you you matter what would they do if you weren't there at 7:30 how could they achieve anything we don't know what they've achieved by 900 p.m. but you know but it's all feelings it's it's trying to satisfy that desire right and then in some ways it's even doing a good job of it because there's many people in in some ways because they continue to go back to that thing and if it didn't work at all they wouldn't go back to that thing except for all that it's doing is making them addicted to the thing that actually almost but never does solve the issue that's in their heart but yet it says it it it feels like I've done something it feels good it feels like I'm not lonely it feels like I'm matter to other people it it feels like I'm doing and that's what we're doing is we're gravitating towards the feelings of success and in in in a community sometimes but but what really is there so I I I what I'm really trying to bring out with this point here is that there are times that we go to places where people actually aren't like there's actually no physical people on your social media there's actually no physical people on your video games okay yes they're in another place but let's Also let's all let's all get real honest and understand that there's such thing as AI right now and then and it can approximate a human sometimes and and then there's also times when we say well that's a person on the other end yeah but you know it's a guy and it's not really a girl it's just pictures of a girl but there's a guy talking to you instead but yet you think you have it's solving loneliness and it's not even what it says it is and this works on plenty of people so we say well like look look brother Trevor what I'm trying to say is that I I I I I you know to solve my loneliness I need a real person near me to solve the problems that I have I I just I've just got to have this thing and and if I don't have that I I'll just always be lonely but what I'm telling you is actually in practice you don't even believe that and that's not even the answer but in practice you don't even believe that because there's plenty of other things that you do that are only human simulation but not actually humans there's nothing actually tangible there but yet you're you want to say to me like God isn't enough because he's not tangible need god with skin on it but then there are even things that you gravitate towards and want to have in your life to solve these problems that have no tangibility to them at all so where are you now I hope everyone followed that it was a little okay right okay good good so we preach and we agree and we knot our heads in church and we amen that Jesus is the only thing that can satisfy a Lonely Heart except for well we have the caveat that we want him to be with skin on it but yet we look after things we go for things that are not tangible and so even that we so actually what we're recognizing is that I actually do go for things to satisfy my loneliness that are intangible and I'm actually okay with that and so I just wanted to flip the script on the devil there for just a moment to recognize like hey just because we we we know God in the spiritual realm in some ways like and he's intangible in some ways that should be okay with every single one of us and we shouldn't make a dependency is the point that I'm trying to get to on god with skin on it and that we're being dishonest with ourselves if we well the devil's lying to us and we're believing that lie if we're saying the only way that I can cure you loneliness is through another person I've got to have this other person or or no these things I write into you that you would have peace all would leave me but I will not be alone because the father is with me though it was intangible for Jesus the man but yet even there were times where he left the fellowship of others and we'll talk about why that is here in the timer and on the time that we have left and and he left people and he left the humans he left the other people around that he could that that that had skin on them but yet he went me to not just to be alone but to find Solitude with with the father because that was the thing that had to satisfy him and we'll talk about what that is in just a moment now many of you may be familiar with the five love languages anyone five love language acts of service U physical touch um uh gifts um words of affirmation and quality time yeah and these are the five love Lang anges I think Gary Chapman is the author of the book and there's you know and then he decided he was making a lot of money so there's the five languages for men and the five languages love languages for women the five love languages for parents with kids um there was one helpful nugget in there but you know um and you know and then five love languages part two I don't know if that actually existed but he might as well have but anyway um five more love languages to confuse us all I don't know but I want to give you just kind of the general point if you're not if you're you're familiar with this this is a refresher but if you're not familiar with the five love languages is is is basically they they they they give you the they they tell they tell you that each of us has the has has the concept of a love tank and that love tank needs to be filled now a love tank that sounds like deep calling to the deep but anyway I don't know that they understood that but we do so hey praise God we do have a love tank and that's a deep that needs a deep to respond to it okay and so you have a love tank and your spouse has a love tank and you know and and you like receiving gifts and your spouse never gives you gifts how do you feel like if when people give you gifts you're like they love me I know they love me because they gave me a gift like to give a gift is expensive and it's like they love me and it just satisfies you and it fills up that love tank because you you have the the language you speak the language of gifts and and so and but what if your spouse never gives you gifts then you're like she doesn't love me he doesn't love me I never get I never get a I give them gifts all the time and I never get one back they don't love me and the spouse is sitting there going are you yeah how can I love you anymore than I Poss than I do right now it's just like I don't understand why you don't get it it's because you're not speaking the right language just buy the gift and then your spouse is like oh you do love me and it's like you have got to be kidding me right now that's what it took and so you begin to understand that people have you know kind of these different languages and we all kind of have some little bit of this and a little bit of that you know I'm not a very gifty person you know it's nice to get something but you know I do live in Lea and you know I buy what I want usually and you know that's just how a lot of us are you know so getting a gift isn't as cool as you know if I never if I didn't have stuff maybe I would speak the love language of gifts a little bit more but you know um but but but there's these different things and some of us you know just we need to you know we need people to spend time with us and if you didn't spend time you know or you need acts of service it's like you know if your wife is acts of service Brothers do the dishes hey recipe for Success right there do the dishes for her she's going to she's going to be like he loves me and you're like I did the plates but if that and so learning your spouse learning the love language of your spouse then then you can begin to re recognize oh if I communicate this way to my spouse then they will recognize the love that I'm trying to express and in a sense I'm expressing my love to that person in a way that maximizes that they hear what it is I'm trying to say that I love you I want you to feel that and you seem to need it this way to really feel like you're loved so guess what because I love you I'm going to edit how I do this so that that you can feel loved and that's wonderful so so um you know um and and words of affirmation some of us just man we just need to be told that we're doing a good job a lot of guys feel that way actually just don't know if you knew that a lot of us are still that young person inside not really sure how this is all working and just putting on a good face hoping that it's going well so sisters probably be good if you just said he might feel that way it doesn't look like it doesn't seem like it lots of bravado lots of Pride lots of you know of course I've got this of course I got this I have no idea what I'm doing I got this babe I got this and so maybe if you told him he was doing a good job that you you'd recognize he just did the dishes for you because you filled up his love tank and you you know you were speaking words of affirmation and then he felt great and then he's like I love her so much like she just really gets me and so I'm going to go and do the dishes for her and then she's going to be like ah so amazing he loves me so much because he did something for me and he showed me that he loved me and then suddenly everybody's speaking the right language and and like man it's honeymoon phase all over again and this sermon isn't about the five love languages but what it is about is to is that we recognize there's a love tank and God has a love tank and there's a deep calling to a deep and that if we're but but but but to in a in a personal level and what I want to say is that marriage isn't solving loneliness because and even because even when we have that person around we're still requiring that person to continue ually day after day day after day speak the language of love that we need spoken to us for us to feel loved for us to not feel lonely and when that language isn't spoken for a while because things get busy and things happen and you know all of these things that we begin to get into that dry and thirsty place and we begin to get into that place we like I am I even loved does he even get me does she even understand like who I am and all that I'm trying to do and you know all of these things that we complain about in our heads you know when we're in those places and we're married so what is that what is that I'm saying there's times even in marriage that you can feel lonely and that that it is that that desire is actually never filled in one moment in the moment that you say I do and we're at the height of how wonderful it is if it was actually solved in that moment you'd not need your SP house to continue to speak the love language that you need them to speak for you to feel loved that God did not design you to actually feel satisfied and and have you know check that box off I don't need that anymore because it's done God designs you to continually seek after him it's a continuous process it will not be satisfied even in heaven even in eternity there will be a desire in inside of you and praise God for it I never never want the desire in me for more of him to ever leave me because I know that act I want that desire to be absolutely insatiable because I recognize that he has unsearchable riches and glory and so I want to always be drawing from a fountain that never can run dry and that's wonderful because I can be refreshed daily when I get into his presence and so to begin to flip the script and to begin to recognize that that that anything that I'm trying to find to cure the loneliness on the inside of me if it isn't coming from him and and we're going to get into who he is in just a moment and tie this all together but if it's not coming from him then then look this thing can't be satisfied by just mere people and just by mere experiences this thing can only be satisfied by him it's not that just the right answer to the question of what do you do when you feel lonely and well what's what's the cure to loneliness well God it's not just that he's the right answer it is that he is not only the the the thing that satisfies but he's the one that put the desire and put that desire in such a way that only he possibly could satisfy everything else that you're looking for if it's not if it isn't something that was given by him to express the the relationship that he wants to show you is never going to come anywhere close to satisfaction the only reason that marriage is is because God knew it wasn't good that man lived alone and I wanted them to see what it was like on a physical basis so that they could understand the spirit spiritual aspect so there's something intangible it's God in even in his intangible that is the only thing that can satisfy that loneliness and satisfy that Holy desire that he put inside of us so so I want to talk about Vision just for a moment because we talked a little bit about this morning you know hey no one gets me I'm just going to go sit in my room and be bored and I'm going to close people off cuz they don't get me anyway and I'm going to be alone and and and and how bad of a thing that was and but but yet isn't there there's a truth to that right like we get to a place where we feel lonely because no one gets me we say that when we feel lonely there just isn't anyone that understands what I'm going through there isn't anyone that can can what we're really saying is there's no one that kind of aligns in their Vision with me and so there there's kind of two possibilities for this and that's you know well you have the right vision and everyone else is a loser or perhaps you need to modify your own Vision brother brandham says at Thy word Lord I'll let down the net he says and down along the bank come this lovely lonely galileon despised and hated by the churches yet the Prince of Peace So Jesus himself is this lovely lonely galileon he's he's there you see and he's hated by the churches so the very people that should love him don't he's a lonely galileon he has disciples around him he has crowds following him but he's lonely and in the times of loneliness he gets away and he goes and he gets he he he he goes and's like brother Trevor but you said we shouldn't seek after alone to be alone this morning but now you're saying Jesus went to be alone and it but he wasn't alone know those times that he got to Solitude he got there for the specific reason and can imagine Jesus like look I have come here to save this world I have come here to manifest myself to die on a cross because these people they have my word but they don't get it the religious leaders have no idea who I am actually am even though they say they're been they've been looking for me for thousands of years but they have no idea who I am I'm the one who's got to go and die for all of these people like does anyone share the vision of Jesus I mean that's an interesting question because that's one yes I do but no that's like back then right like while he's there even Peter does he share the vision of Jesus like at this time are you going to restore the kingdom is now the time we get to kick out the Romans when do we get to the good part Lord when do we get to the good part I've got the sword you want me to take off malus's other ear oh Lord I'll do it just the courage that I have right now in this moment Lord is just I am Unstoppable I will take the Romans on myself like does anyone share the vision of Jesus no Peter I'm gonna look Peter Peter I literally just told you I'm going to go die for you and I'm good with that and I have to do that and you're still trying to cut off people's ears would you stop Peter doesn't share the vision of Jesus no one does he's a lonely Galilean no one gets him no one got Jesus you know they're in a boat do you now believe it's been years do you do you cuz you said we got it a little while ago and and you did and but now we know Lord that thou art the Christ it's like do you now believe do you do you really so Jesus is a lonely Galilean because no one shares his vision the people who should share his vision don't share his vision they hate him and so there he goes he's walking along and in order to find someone who shares his vision he has to get away from the people around him to go and talk to the father because only the father shares his vision now I'm so thankful that we have a Church of the Living God in our day that there's all kinds of people that should and can and will share the vision that we ourselves have and so and and there should be a big large vibrant wonderful Holy Ghost filled body of Believers that you are around that that share your vision that get you and at least on some things and so but but if we're so if we're sitting there saying well no one gets me it's like well what's your vision like what's the vision that you have that PE people don't get because maybe that's the problem is is that you aren't sharing your vision needs to be edited your vision needs to be altered to to be more focused on Jesus Christ and to be more recognizing that Jesus Christ is the answer and that if we all got together around that and shared that same desire then then maybe there'd be a a camaraderie that we would feel that would take away some of the loneliness that we are feeling because we do have that in one another and that's you know can you imagine a husband and wife and my it's happen so often right that that they've gotten together but they don't share the right Vision you know you take a girl from a you know very legalist family you know things are done by the book believer and then you take a a guy from maybe one of those you know looser families believer but he's got the desire that he wants the right kind like he recognizes there's been problems and he wants he wants he wants the right kind of wife he wants a a girl that like she knows devotions and she's re you know so so he finds a girl that's in this home where things are much stricter but this girl is getting a little bit tired of the strictness and she's looking for a guy who can be a little bit more fun and a little bit more loose and so the guy is everything this girl wants he comes from a family where things are kind of loose and that looks appealing to me and he's like I've come from this family where everything's loose I'm not really I it's like I would like some structure I would like things to be done a little bit more by the book and she comes from that and just what she represents is everything that I would like a wife to be and they get married are are they sharing a VI Vision think this is going to be problematic so they're together they're married but there's still loneliness because they're not sharing the vision right they're not aligned in the vision so that's that's a that's a problem and so anyway you can maybe find some of some of that so how much of loneliness is actually selfishness sometimes so I and I just want to say here I'm I'm not trying to beat anyone up at all I I what I what I am trying to do is that we just that we look at this issue from all sides so that we can understand our own hearts and you know look I I understand there's loneliness is a hard thing and and many of us find our places in seasons and periods of loneliness and it is dry and it's really difficult and I I have I have every you know respect for that and every you know I'm I'm not trying to to push anybody off at all right but I'm trying to deal with this issue in love and and and that we honestly look at this and and so that we can understand how we do solve that problem and how when we get into those periods of dryness that the things that maybe sometimes we're looking for aren't really the things that are going to satisfy and solve the problem so and I need to hurry so um thou Isaiah 419 and10 God speaking to the proph or the prophet speaking here thou whom I have taken from the ends of the Earth and called This is God speaking to the prophet but he's writing down thou whom I have taken from the ends of the Earth called from the chief men thereof and said unto thee Thou Art my servant I have chosen thee and not cast thee away fear thou not I am with thee be not dis dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help thee y I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness now God is saying this to a prophet that he has called out this Prophet is aligned with the vision of God the prophet finds himself in the vision and God is saying I don't worry about the things that are going to come I'm with you that's who I am I'm going to be with you I'm not going to send you into these Hard Times except I'm going to be with you so you you you you you're aligned with my vision right I I could say that I'm going to be with you anyway but would you care if you weren't aligned with my vision right right so so so sometimes we we have to begin to understand what is loneliness some loneliness is when we we aren't sharing Vision with someone else right so Psalm 23:4 yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me so I want to like I want to like we we need to think about this for a moment because I want what I want us to understand in this section is who God is and it is who God is that makes the difference because when we say well well God but but if we don't recognize who God is if we don't have a real sense of who he is and that his promises to us are yay and amen then we then then we won't look for him to solve the loneliness right because if someone comes along and says you know I will be with you in the Valley of the shadow of death and it's like oh man that's great that's great but what if that person was kind of Shifty and wearing a hood and said I will be with you in the Valley of the shadow of death and was rather Shifty looking and untrustworthy like I will go down that dark alley with you this is singularly not comforting you won't be alone you know but but maybe I'd be okay with that my wife and I were talking about the sermon we were at the Kalahari I was there this week for a um I guess last week for a for a a work Tech conference and so we were there lot lots of people there and a Friday the last day of this seminar is was Friday and so you have to check you know we were coming over here so we had to check out of the hotel at 11:00 and so my wife doesn't have a room you know now and she has to just come and kind of sit in the the hallway and there's nice couches and different things but you know she has to come and sit in the hallway and we began to talk about it's like hey you know when when you were in the room and I'm in the classes are were you feeling lonely she's like well no not really I was vlogging I was doing my pictures and creating a scrap scrapbook and all of these things that she had brought to do while I was you know listening to Tech technical conference talks and it's just riveting by the way and um and and you know and so she brought things for her to do and then we spent the evenings together and and and that was nice but you know I was like well when you were in the room by yourself were you lonely she's like well no not really I had things to do and I had you know all these you know and and it's like yeah but so and then when you were in the hallway after we had to check out of the room um sitting there in the hallway with all of these people walking around and were you lonely she was like yes I was a little bit more lonely in the afternoon while I was sitting there amongst thousands well not thousands but hundreds and hundreds of you know people and and she was loner though well why because the cont of I'm here and no none of these people but my husband really share the same vision that I have and so the contrast was heightened so she could recognize there's lots of people here but none of them share the vision and that's not helping me any at all now if it would have been a just a lovely you know Conference of Believers and she'd have been sitting in the hallway she'd have been like this is amazing please come sit with me and things like that so she was sitting she had chosen a chair and it was kind of close to the the dining hall and it was just kind of outside the door she's sitting there in the chair and there's another chair you know next to her and for a while I was sitting there but then I had to go and to another conference and and things and so you know well this so this other guy I mean they're just they're just chairs right there for everybody you know it's not like the chair next to her is taken so this guy comes and he's got his laptop he's got his earbuds you know he sits down and he opens up his laptop and he starts doing his thing you know and it's like I mean and I came out and I was kind like part of me was just like hey but you know she's not alone even though when you sat there no one else was sitting with her and physically she was alone but I want you to know that you shouldn't sit there because she's she's not alone she is but she's not alone she's she's with somebody and we were just we were just talking about like what if that guy would have leaned over just kind of just looked at you and been like don't worry I will never leave you or forsake you that would have been super creepy right like no thank you I don't know who you are no thank you I don't know who you are I don't have a clue whether I would want you near me or not I you could be anybody you could be a serial killer you could be anything I don't know you I don't know if you're a good person I don't know if you're the sum total of all righteousness I don't know if you're everything that is awesome I don't know if you're everything that is wonderful I don't know if you're everything that is Holy that if you're if you're everything that is true if you're everything that is good if you're everything that one could ever want I don't know if you're that and I if you want to tell me you'll never leave me or forsake me I don't know that I care but if one were to come along and you knew that person and the characters and the qualities of that person and they came down and sat right down next to you and said I will never leave you or forsake you that's not creepy at all that's the most wonderful moment that could everen happen in your life so we begin to understand what is the cure for loneliness I want to tell you he is the cure for loneliness and if you're feeling lonely and he is not then then and he's not solving that for you then I would say perhaps your vision isn't aligned with his I would say perhaps you don't know who it is that is saying to you I will never leave leave you I will never forsake you perhaps you need to have times when you get to prayer and in your prayer time he begins to reveal himself to you you begin to feel his presence coming around you and he begins to show you who he is and that he cares about you and that he's going to take care of your problems that he's going to take care of your hearts that he's there for you and that he's wonderful and maybe just maybe in prayer your heart actually begins to beat a little faster because you begin to recognize who it is that's there with you and when you see him and know him my it's the thrill of the church to know him he is it's not no no no no no no look that brother Trevor what's the cure for loneliness God you see the difference you see the difference it's not God it's him he the one who is the sum total of all Perfection is found in him and it is that one that loves you it is that one that cares for you it is that one that desires to satisfy every longing and put and even put that longing in your heart to cry out for him and he it is he is the one who comes to you and says I am with you that's the answer to loneliness is to know him to align with his vision because when you recognize who he is and it's just like oh you you're the one you're the amazing one you're the wonderful one you're the righteous one what is it you would like because I'm telling you what I haven't experienced anything near as amazing as that and guess what sign me up what would you like I want to share the vision what do you need from me what can I set me in action because a lot of times when we're lonely it's cuz we're bored and when we're bored it's because the vision there's problems with the vision we're not we're not in action with the vision now I'm not saying that we'll never be bored that there never be a time when you don't have anything to do and all of that you you understand but but there are sometimes we have long seasons of of malaise of uncertainty of not knowing and and but God is there and maybe sometimes we're in those Seasons because we're actually not listening to what he's saying because he wants to come and say look this is he this is who I am and and I'm I'm I'm wonderful I'm I want you to be a part of this this offer is is is better than anything you'll ever get but sometimes we're like yeah but Mom and Dad want me to do that and I'm a little you know miffed at them right now and so I just can't I just can't accept the offer of of doing awesome things with how amazing the amazing one that you are I get it it's an amazing thing Lord that you're asking me but but but but my parents want me to give my life to you and I right now I am just in a season of rebellion let's just be honest I'm just lord I can't because I I I I am diametrically opposed to satisfying anything that my parents want of me right now and you stick your foot out and you load the gun and you shoot yourself in the foot because let me tell you something the off offer of him being with you and never leaving you and never forsaking you how awesome he is let just I'm just I'm just going to tell you right now it is so awesome that it is going to even overcome you know how how reluctant you are to satisfy your parents' desires that you find Jesus like I'm ju I'm just telling you I get it I've been there too I've done that but nothing has ever satisfied me has ever thrilled me as much is when I know I'm in the will of God and I'm making a difference in people's lives and he's making a difference in my life and the satisfaction and the overwhelming peace and wonder of all of that and it's not and and that this isn't just for preachers this isn't just for brothers but it's for every single person whosoever will let him take of the Water of Life freely do you have the desire yes you do cuz he put it there but he is the deep that can respond to that and it's not that he just wants to come and satisfy you and say oh did oh did you want something oh did you need something here let me satisfy that good boy excellent good job I've satisfied that for you good good enough go go on your Merry way you're satisfied now no no no no like that would be nice entertaining narcissistic but there's a deep in him oh there's a deep in him that has a deep in you that wants to respond he wants it to be two-way he wants you to be active he wants you to be a part of it he wants you to desire him as much as he desires you and there's such a reward and such a fulfillingness to that to know it's like I'm not just some you know dummy that's just sitting here just completely dependent upon God I am yes in some ways that's true but I'm not merely that that is only in my flesh but the seed of God that's on the inside of me that has the characters and qualities that everything that he is is also on the inside of me is also the one that wants to satisfy that one who created that attribute in the first place and that's fulfilling and that's rewarding and marriage is is a type of that and it's wonderful yes but it is not a replacement for the satisfaction that we can have in knowing Jesus Christ in understanding his promises young people old people dive into the word of God not for the not for the instruction this is this is not basic instructions before leaving Earth I think that's one of the dumbest things forgive me if anybody else has ever preached on that that's fine I'm not against it but but this is not merely basic instructions before leaving Earth this is a this is a a letter of to you something to to show you the characters and the promises of God so that you might know him and then and then he came and then he lived that way on this Earth and and then he died and rose again and then he poured himself out into other Believers that we might know him who he is I don't want to just know about him I don't want to just know what he can do for me but God how can I reciprocate that love oh and and have a meaningful relationship with you oh God amen amen musicians you come I'm over time you forgive me I I just I wanted to express this all thank you Lord Christ in you is the hope of glory amen we'll leave that up for a bit it's Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you Christ coming into you and being that deep to respond to that deep what a hope that is what an amazing journey that is what a what a thrilling thing that is that he has invited you to be a part of and to satisfy your every longing with his own self and it can be done because we know who he is and the more the more you can you can begin to play You're figuring out what you're going to play that's fine the more that we recognize and and just so just hear this for a moment I just I know it's been long but just a a final thought here the more that you can recognize the further you can expand your understanding of who he is his qualities his nature his characteristic to take him from just some guy with headphones sitting in a chair next to you to recognizing who he is that he is that wonderful one the more like you we I know we know it I I you know we've been preached it's preached to us but the more you personally can can have a relationship with the word of God to where it can come and reveal to you who you are and who he is and and that you can your your understanding and the depth you know I I I I just like I just want to know him more and more and more I want to know him as the source to satisfy my loneliness I want him to be the one that that he is the one who never leaves he is the God who sees I want to know him as the God who sees he is the god who saves I want to not just know about that I want to experience that I want to know that I want to I want to know that like nobody's ever known that before I want to dive into that so so so hard it just you know that that that I can't hardly come out you know that I almost Dove too deep and I'm losing breath and I got to come to the surface surface surface you you understand what I'm say this that's what this year that that I've decided I want this year to be I want this year to be a year of depth for me and maybe maybe you would want to join me in that and let 2024 be a year of depth where you dive into the glories of God where you begin to not just come to church and not just do the thing but when you get to a where you recognize that God I want you to be my every answer I don't want to just know that that's the right answer but God I want to feel that that answer is nothing but the truth shall we pray Heavenly Father God we want to see you and know you Hallelujah this year in ways that we've never seen you

don't spend another year just just being another believer just dwelling on the premises dive in get personal with him let him say God how can you Lord I I don't understand I feel this way and I don't

come and fill me oh God let me see you for the one who takes care of this problem and that problem let me Dive Into You and let him let the spirit of God come to you and say I'm here and you're not

Sam Lord You're my comfort hold [Music] meone oh [Music] hallelu I am not [Music] alone you're my comfort yes Lord always hold yes you do [Music] Lord amen you know I you think about how that but in this hour how brother Trevor was diving into that on that of loneliness and you know God knew he knew that each one of us would be here he knew even the state the condition he knew all the mud that would be packed in our lives he knew all of our weaknesses he knew all of those things but his choosing had nothing to do with our weaknesses nothing because your weaknesses your failures your mistakes that's not who you are that's not what defines you the world wants to try to Define you it'll try to satisfy offer take god-given thirst and pervert it example how the prophet brought that with that thirst he said it's a natural god-given desire for a lady to want to look beautiful but he said Satan will get if he can get a hold of that he'll try to pervert it you notice how when Satan perverts anything he doesn't in a way of shaming you to try to make you feel like you're nothing and to strip every form of value away from you but you know when God deals with your life God doesn't work that way God doesn't have to shame you into serving him God works by his love by his word to draw us out of us what he's put in us you know even that longing that you have that that that stirs up in your heart you know why that is God put that there in you and when his word word for this age is passing over your life that's what's making that creation inside of you I've just referred to you a direct quote that's what makes the creation inside of you because now what brother Trevor talked about that Vision now you can begin to see a vision of Victory you can begin to see a vision of yourself standing over that besetting sin you can begin to see yourself standing in Victory instead of the victim you see yourself as a mighty conqueror and there's only one that can do that for you and that's him if you'll let go of your vision and take his vision and then just start walking in step by step into that Vision God will do the work and I I think when we're gathered here t tonight the Lord would preach things would Minister things so personal Satan's objective in every aspect is to try to isolate people you remember what he said about brother Trevor said about his wife she was setting in that foyer there of Kalahari I've been there big place had to go there for conferences and things and all those people walking by I've been in the mall and felt all of alone why is that because there's nobody else that I can really connect to nobody else that shares the same vision at least that I know of you know think about it how refreshing is it when you're out to eat you're walking in a store and we see one another say oh God bless you sis God bless you brother what is it it's it's it's like a breath of fresh air somebody that you know is sharing that same vision think about how that is with God God moving by our way and stirring that up in our life and that begin we begin to say yes Lord yes Lord I say this as we just sing another song here if you would like prayer
