very special as as believers the privilege that we have to be able to assemble together in the name of the Lord then bring our licks of fire together and what the Lord will do in our midst and how that he works in our life is just something special to us you know coming to church is not a ritual to our lives it's not something that's you know we look at and say well I think I can fit it in but it's it's what we base everything around you know with in reality that's why we make decisions about jobs or we make decisions about whether this can be done or that can be done we we look at and say will this interfere with church well you know if it interferes with church then sorry we can't do it amen and I'm so thankful that God is so placed that within our hearts it's just such a privilege to be in the house of the Lord tonight and we just want to look right into the word and ask if you'll just turn with us to Exodus 14 and as you're turning there I want to just mention to your Lord willing this coming weekend family and I we be gone and ministering and brother Brandon Senna Cola will be coming over and he'll be ministering here in the Assembly and just keep us in prayer Lord willing we'll be down and bluffed in this this weekend and so you just keep us in prayer if you would it's hard with missing last Sunday because I've got everything bottled up so I have this old wait till we get back but let's look at this here tonight and Exodus 14 verse 10 and when Pharaoh drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried out unto the Lord that's the right thing to do I said that's the right thing to do they cry out unto the Lord if that would have been right there where they stopped but then they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt has thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt thus with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness Moses said unto the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today what do I have to do stand still that's it stand still and see behold the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace amen and amen amen let's just bow our heads tonight amen anyone want to be remembered in prayer maybe a need on your heart or something before the Lord let's just go before him tonight let's pray for one another Lord Jesus father we're just so thankful that you Lord have made a way for us or God to come Lord into your presence Lord we're thankful Lord God to be standing or God in your presence tonight and father we believe oh god that this is where that Lord that we have been gathered Lord in you and Lord were thankful that you gave us Lord the opening an opportunity to be able to come to the house of God Lord I know throughout Sunday Lord there were Lord just true churches Lord that were canceled Lord all the way and Lord different ones clear down into Arkansas in different places Lord that were just canceled Lord from the way that the weather had hit but father we're just thankful that you made a way tonight Lord we just pray that Lord that you would come Lord tonight and would you just take us Lord take your word and speak to us Lord what it is that you want to say to us Lord father we know that it will take more dear Lord God than just a gift it'll take Lord the gift being used by you father Lord to minister Lord to your people father so Lord we ask that you would come Lord minister to every need Lord those that are behind the uplifted hands father Oh God tonight Lord we've come expecting Lord God to father Lord to see you father and to hear from you Lord we just set our needs before you Lord be leaving dear God that you're all that we have Father and we ask Lord God for your blessing now upon your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen God blesses your being seated I look here in the scripture and I want to the Lord will help us tonight I'd like to look at that portion of verse 13 and Moses said unto the people fear you not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today you know when you you look at this within the word as we were touching upon this last week and you know it's just one of those things that you just wasn't even thinking of passing this way it was going straight over into the first place there at Marah and that's what I had been studying for months and looking for there and then how the Holy Spirit picks this up and then when those things get brought before you and I feel like not everything that's set in before me and there's no way in the world that we'll be able to break into what it is that that God just seemed to be quickening last week but nonetheless the Lord had his way and when we look at this here tonight you know and we think about this in the scripture of where that the people themselves had come to and how that God would instruct the people to stand still you know it's not the first time through the Scriptures or would it be the first time that God would actually direct his people time and time again to stand still you find it in countless times through the Scriptures when Israel and different ones would come upon different battles and things that were more than what they themselves knew what to do with when you look in a situation like this in 2nd chronicles 20 verse 17 if here was a time when mohab was invading Israel Jehoshaphat is the king and you find that here within Judah how that they had went before the Lord and then a man by the name of jahaziel there one of the Levites the Spirit of God came upon and he begin to prophesy and say you shall not need to fight in this battle set yourselves stand you still and see the salvation of the Lord with you o Judah and Jerusalem fear not nor be dismayed tomorrow go out against them for the Lord will be with you you find in another place which many of us can identify with where job was in the heat and thick of the trials and tests and remember ivory everyone had already spoke bill daddy live as and Joel had tried to go back and forth with them and so forth to where that they had got job you know to where that job was still standing on his sacrifice but Joe had been able to be affected by the things that they were saying to wear that as they remember those men were looking at the goodness of themselves or how a person would be good that if you're good there will be no test there'll be no trials and so they were actually portraying self-made righteousness and remember Ella who was there the whole time but he didn't speak up until each of them he said I figured that the ancients should speak first because wisdom should speak but then you find when Ella who begins to break forth and begins to speak he takes you know the very the very direction within the word and would cause job to consider things that was all around job things that would seem so small and insignificant like that of the clouds how the clouds would form how even the snow would form how even though rain drop the dew drops all these things that you know Joe would would overlook and not willingly but evens and consider God's care and direction to wear that Ella who would tell him in this statement of job 37:14 hearken unto this old job stand still and consider the wondrous works of God I'll tell you that's a miracle when we're in the midst of tests and trials we need to hear from Ella who we need to hear from the Lord to help us today just stand still just just stand still because we hear so much we've got this rumor we've got this thought we've got this things you've got you're surrounded by all sorts of things voices are flying left and right but here in the midst of it remember now just stand still settle down calm down and just let's hear what God has to say think about it even when here when Israel had actually you know chosen Saul to be the king Samuel would actually rehearse before the people after that they had already chosen so and I found this to be very remarkable of how Samuel would say to the people in 1st Samuel 12 it is the Lord that advanced Moses and Aaron and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt you find over and over in the scriptures this God is new you know God doesn't do anything just to be doing it he doesn't say anything just to be saying you know to think about it throughout the scriptures this is something that would be rehearsed as a part of Israel's heritage as a matter of fact so many things of the Psalms that we read that are actually sung within certain times a memorial in the feast within Israel these are not things that are just happenings or just mere scriptures or just mere songs these actually have a significant meaning to them when they're singing them to where that even Samuel moved by the Spirit of God how many times have we read this here of how that it is brought to the attention it is the Lord that brought you out of Egypt now you would think you know that how many times God said that over and over in the book of Exodus he says it over and over in the Book of Numbers he actually says it over and over in the book of Deuteronomy he'll say it through each and every one of them Nehemiah Ezra Micah all the way on down through there why it is needful for them to remember that it is the Lord who brought them out of Egypt or in one place he would say out of the iron furnace and I believe that we can never ever let us never get too big that we forget that it's the Lord that brought us out and the same Lord who brought us out is the same Lord who takes us in now I know that we've been brought out and we're taken into Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but we also know that there is an actual catching away going into there is a body there is a rapture that is waiting and that is promised and that we are a part of what the church has looked forward to and you know what's being rehearsed to us the promises of what God was what God did that same God is the same God tonight we cannot and the rapture itself will never take place with the minimizing of God's power in any way it must be the same power that was originally delivered to the church on the day of Pentecost and that same power returning in the Church of the Living God and living through the lives of the people the Prophet said it welcomes back the Lord Jesus to the earth so here how that Samuel would be moved by the Spirit of God stand still look what he tells him here pardon me stand still that I may reason with you before the Lord of all the righteous acts of the Lord in that beautiful these aren't righteous acts of the Lord which he did to you and to your father's notice in Psalms 23 - he maketh me to lie down in green pastures notice this it's not it's not us doing this he maketh me you know this is the responsibility of our Shepherd to actually settle us and bring us to a place that even has sheep and that we are able to sit down and enjoy the presence of the Lord - where we're not bothered by parasites were not bothered by little schisms and this and that or whatever more the Bible says he maketh me to lie down in green pastures he leadeth me beside the still waters why do you need steel waters so you can see yourself you need to be able to see yourself so he will lead us beside the still waters there's times for troubled waters and there's times for steal waters is that right there's times for preaching and there's times for teaching now think of this here in Psalms 46:10 be still and know that I'm God this is settled - to be settled in him and know that I'm God I will be exalted among the heathen I will be exalted in the earth the Lord of Hosts is with us the God of Jacob is our refuge sail on in numbers 1330 here you find Caleb and Caleb the Bible says remember when the reports had come back from those who had went over in the land and everything was being said about the land and all these things like this and what does the Bible say right here it says that Caleb's killed the people before Moses I'll tell you Caleb had a presence about his life and it was not about his natural DNA it was Caleb remember the Bible said he had another spirit about him he had wholly followed the Lord it was something the presence of the Lord was about his life to where he was actually able to steal the people now I don't know what kind of vernacular he used I don't know if he said shut up be quiet stop talking hey listen what you have to say doesn't matter it doesn't mean anything because why you're talking against what God has said so to think of this here brother bran tells us here he says this is a nervous age that we're in now think of it it's a nervous age you know brother BAM in this message here of stand still brother BAM talks about how he says within the country now this is back in 1957 and I think I heard him just say something here in 1954 as well he says you know across the country he said they've actually identified there's 80 some percent that's identified with mental problems now think about it that was back then in 1957 now when you look at it here he says it's a nervous age and he says and what ear said it's that when I give this solemn warning notice I give this solemn warning to the church stand still God always commands to stand still before he does anything the churches is in a neurotic condition they're proselyting puling fussing stewing but stand still now that's the message now to think about it to stand still is to come back to the word think about it how that Israel they are watching the Egyptians and remember that cried unto the Lord as we read in our text but then as they continued to dwell I want you to watch where it's going watch how they continued to dwell upon the advancement of the horse rider and the horsemen and watch how they were coming after him they begin to get their eyes upon what and who was pursuing them and when they begin to get focused upon that then they turned around and they begin to blame Moses but you see when you look and just let yourself live in a humanistic realm you'll look for excuses that are humanistic excuses but you and I were not built and made to live within a humanistic realm you understand we're not built to be victorious by living in this realm there's no way that we can walk in victory by being confined to this realm but on the other hand you and I are to have the influence of the victory from that of where our eyes are tuned beyond that of the natural and when we can look to the Lord well you don't matter what everything else is all around us we know who is with us and I believe that tonight that if we can have our eyes so focused upon that and you know that Satan's objective is to try to get our eyes off of that he might get your eyes upon all the rumors all the situations and everything that you know is said to come your way and you know how it is around the workplace in whatever more rumors fly like a dime-a-dozen you got all kinds of people that have everything drummed up you said brother samuel what should I do I tell you what if you believe that God gave you that job then I would stand there and say Barry nobody can move me out of here until God tells me that I'm done here because this job wasn't about me it ain't about my skills it's God confirming and keeping his word as Jehovah Jireh he's providing for me for my family for my needs and you can stand right there when all types of breath of Satan comes around your way and you can stand there on the Word of God knowing this is what God has for me now look at this here you know so they've got to come back to the word get away from looking at the enemy you know when you think about it brother man would say it like this he says that when Israel was standing there at the midst of the Red Sea he said God brought him to a place like that he said in there they're their way of looking at it he said there wasn't anything else that could be done but to stand still you see it was God's Way of proving and making himself known as we were saying that last week and probably won't be the last time we say it but how can you know that he's a healer unless you've been healed how can you know he's a deliverer unless you've been delivered you see these are not things that we quote or we recite even for myself when I preach I cannot preach according to what I read I preach according to the experience and you see my experience being found in the world that indeed that Jesus Christ is the same but I can preach according to the experience for who I know him to be now you see if a person only knows him to be puny and weak and he's not as strong as it used to be that's all the experience that they have within their lives so that's all that they can either live or they can either preach but you know I didn't meet anyone who was diminished in power but I met beliving God and I believe I'm talking to people tonight who met by living God who actually bring brought such a deliverance within our life and then he himself who is the promise made himself real to us that as he spoke to us then the anointing of the word now moves upon our life to quicken that seed within us not to look at this here in the scriptures here you find Moses now right after this has been spoken in Exodus 14 verse 15 and the Lord said unto Moses we're for Christ now unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward you know when you listen to brother Branham preached why Christ thou speak and brother man why Christ down to me Moses in there in 63 and then the says on this message he said this morning I'm preaching and I'm preaching it to myself he said I'm preaching on me this morning he said we all need a rebuke and I need one with what he's dealing with is how that God has equipped you and I and house he equips our live he Commission's our life and the Prophet goes through to deal with things that will actually paralyze our faith he talks about living right our dress you know you might look at things and things will they don't matter how a dress it does matter God is concerned with how you and I address and you see how we dress how we present ourselves we do not want to be identified with the world you see when will you come under the pressures and succumb to those things like that you're paralyzing your faith you see friends what it is you want your faith to be free to operate program says when you have it when you can't stand people talking about you or the reproach that you have to bear he said what you are doing you are allowing your faith to be paralyzed but I believe tonight we don't want no perilous paralysing of faith I don't want my faith to be grounded we want our faith to be honed into the word to whatever God has called for you want to be able to stand on that word and know that God is standing behind you now think of this here within the Scriptures speak to the children of Israel that they go forward and he tells Moses but lift up thou of thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea he goes on to say I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and I will get on or upon Pharaoh upon his host is chariots as Horseman's and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I've got me honor upon Pharaoh his chariots his horsemen and the angel of God it says removed from before and it went by on them and it became a go-between the Egyptians could no longer advance and it was there as darkness to them but it was light to Israel now I want you to remember this and think of this here tonight when God tells Moses to take the rod hold it up and stretch it out across though the waters remember that rod was a judgment rod that rod also represented the name of the Lord and brother Ram brings it to us like this he says that rod itself in Moses hand was that of the deity in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so to think of it that that deity within that name that power that was with him that name think of it now what looked like a regular staff but you know what it was it was the scepter of Almighty God this was a word where God's Word how that God Himself was coming down to bring deliverance to his people now when you look at this here within the scriptures it was a go-between and to think how that brother Graham says it like this he said when God was ready to speak he had to steal the people you know it's hard to say something to somebody if they're talking it's hard to say something even you know right now you may not be talking but inside you might be you know it might seem like they're you've got more freeways going on than Los Angeles does you've got all kinds of things going on and you know frustrations and things and whatever more you you know things trying to figure out it what about this but yet to see within the midst of it brother BAM says you can actually say within your heart Lord I'm gonna stand still I'm gonna believe your word and I'm going to expect to see you to move on the scene now I'll tell you I believe it like this as a personal witness that those words to you and I and they seem like little words but when those words are spoken by faith to believe that he is able to do it you watch him come on the scene and he will do things that you and I would think to be impossible listen God is not too big that he looks at your problem your situation or mine and says it's insignificant that's not how values have been remember every experience within our lives is just a test to trial that God is able to make himself known to us now think about this he had to steal the people blood Ram says one day way down coming out of Egypt before they got there God wanted to show his glory and God can only show his glory when his people stand still and looks for it that's what's the matter today with our church people does not stand still and look for the glory of God it's written in the scripture stand still and see the glory or the salvation of God so to stand still this is this is God's design now notice relevance is coming up to the Red Sea this covenant people who had the promise of God who were standing firm on the promise and it's strange to see that when people take a stand for God it looks like the devil throws everything in their way that he can throw in their way but God makes a way through that way he said some of my greatest experiences I've ever witnessed before God is when I get to a place where I couldn't go over under or around but just stand still God makes a way through it somehow God makes a way through it somehow it's unexplainable we just know God made the way notice he hasn't failed yet he never will fail God cannot fail the Brethren says it seemed like when the children of Israel had got up to this Red Sea the pillar fire leading him Pharaoh's army behind him the mountains and the sea cutting them all if all nature would have wept out for this little people unarmed in a great marching army but sometimes God's paths leads right through such places this is important God wanted to show his power God loves to display his power he loves to display his power now think of this brother branham you know puts it real simple I don't think I included this particular quote but billabong talks about how that and going it's just continuing on here he talks about how you get little Joseph or or one of the little girls he said of here's you know Rebecca Sarah he'll get him up you know on his lap and he says you know I get to talking to him and and things like that and you know he says then one of them will you know say he said I I start talking to him and and one and will say daddy draw your muscle up daddy oh you got such a big muscle he said now there's not much there but as long as they think that it makes me feel good and he said our heavenly father likes for his children to know that he's got muscles he can do things for them and sometimes I bring a conversation up so it has to lead to that I just love to hear sat notice I bring a conversation up there on my lap and I bring that conversation up to where they tell me daddy make a muscle because it makes me feel good when I do and they say wow daddy you got a big muscle you see God brings things up so that his muscles can be flexed and you and I say why you got a big muscle wow but the Rev saying you know I used to be a pugilist or a boxer I'm getting old and fat and flabby and decrepit now but I still like to think that I'm back like I used to be but there's one thing about God he's the same yesterday today and forever there's no old age with him he's eternal and not only bad but everyone that receives him becomes eternal with God for there's only one eternal light and God has that alone and when we receive God's eternal life we become eternal with God everything that has a beginning has an end and God had no beginning and he has no in he's eternal forever he goes on to tell us how God wanted to display his power and I found how the brother Bram takes this approach and I I won't read all of this part here but I just in listening to this and looking at it I find it the same way has it's written in the scripture to where the focus itself even though it is told to Israel stand still and see the salvation of the Lord but to think about it even the earth itself is a redeemable attribute of Almighty God and the earth itself has helped right here we'll read about it tonight it helped Israel once it's going to help others over in the tribulation you're with me so the earth itself has been a help many times not to think about it he said he had the red seed to stand still and wall itself up and stand at attention he had the Red Sea glory it obeyed creation obeyed its creator now brother Graham was talking about how he says he will loves you know in that latter paragraph there he said if his people would only listen to him stand still to see his promise he'd like to display that same thing to them today to deliver his people from their bondage of sin and doubt and frustration and sicknesses and every redemptive blessing that Jesus got for belongs to the people it's yours God got the sea to stand steel to watch him do something oh the earth was probably rejoicing and you know because the earth knows what's going to come here in the Millennium very shortly the earth knows what's going to take place in the future home and the earth remember they are waiting groaning for the manifestation of the sons of God the earth no doubt at that time maybe said glory to God maybe this is the moment well maybe this was the time but it wasn't it was just a type of that time Oh mom you know brother Adam he goes on to talk about this and he talks about this I refer to this last week in the message redemption in completeness enjoy what a wonderful message brother Rama goes through that and he deal with how that he said what this was Israel had already come out and there had already been a spiritual death inside of Egypt and they had already been recipients of God's life he said but now you find an enemy that's after God's people he said it was physical death that was gonna try to overtake him and brother Bram said it just like this he says now for example he said how God is going to make a way of escape from physical death where he sent the angel of God between that of the approaching army and that of Israel and brother Ram said it's just like a believer as soon as he gets saved maybe a cancer has eaten him up or some disease God has redemption through power the same as he has redemption for the soul he has redemption for the body do you realize that this here the divine healing is the very earnest of the resurrection divine healing itself oh my we recognize there is absolutely must have that soul must have a divine healing but to think about it that when sickness and other things that would seek to strike our body I'm glad that tonight to be able to stand there as a witness and there's witnesses around this building right here that he is a Redeemer of the body it's a witness times we got sick and then here we get well and then we get sick and then he heals us but you know what one of these days all of that is a testimony there's going to come a final healing one day it'll be a change of this mortal body glory be to God hallelujah now to think of this watch how that this would take place in Exodus 15 let's look at this here just for a few moments the Bible here now when this has taken place and what Israel has witnessed what God has done and moved on their behalf the Bible says in Exodus 15 1 then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and they spake singing I will sing unto the Lord this there was no confusion this was unto the Lord you mean God like singing oh yeah the Bible says he dwells in the praises of his people come on friends I know sometimes you know people say well we worship different in whatever more but you know he dwells in the praises of his people he doesn't dwell in the nots he dwells in the praises I mean to me it's just something about it that you know you're actually able to render out praise for that which is due praise and he's worthy of all our praise whether he does any thing else for us or not amen now think I will sing unto the Lord oh my I will sing them to the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously glory be to God oh my the horse and his rider has he thrown into the sea notice he threw it into the sea the Lord is my strength and my song and he has become my salvation isn't this incredible but this same song is also sung over in the Book of Revelations and isn't it astounding that this is the opening for the chapter of the rapture in Psalms 27 the Lord is my light the Lord is my salvation oh my this has more than just a meaning this is a type that's not only building faith for the children of Israel but God is letting a witness be known that devil your end is coming glory be to God let's just stay with this tonight though the Lord is my strength and song and he has become my salvation aren't you glad I'm glad he's become my salvation and I'm glad he continues to become my salvation is that right sometimes when you're down he becomes your salvation right when you need healing in your body he becomes your salvation right and one of these days he will become the end of our salvation glory be to God he has become my salvation he is my god and I will prepare him in habitation my father's God and I will exalt him the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name now think about this here let me read a few places in the scripture in Psalms 106 verse 7 I love this our fathers understood not by wonders in Egypt they remember not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the Ritz at the sea even at the Red Sea and how many tonight would say Lord forgive me for not remembering when I need to remember but help me Lord to remember the multitude of thy mercies Lord you're faithful you're faithful what brother saying AHA I can't remember I know he's done so much for you but if you can just let it slip away and say Lord you're faithful because he is and you'll find God begin to bring things back to you and you might think why didn't I write that down why didn't I remember that but you see it was there it's a part of your experience but now how that that will be brought back to you within that time that you can remember the multitude of his mercies why is that because our tests and our trials are not just experiences that are things that we say boy I'm glad I got through that no those are the molding but chastening the discipline the child training and yet at the same time through that it's a building of our faith it's God preparing us for what the next step would be home nevertheless oh my nevertheless he saved them for his namesake that he might make his mighty power to be known he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness and he save them look at the scripture he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and he redeemed them from the hand of the enemy those that hated them the enemy aren't you glad this is our promise it's the same thing for Israel you know in the natural God is going to redeem Israel come on somebody same way that God here is doing that of the Gentile church now notice here and the waters covered their enemies there was not one of them left then believe they his words they sang his praise psalms 136 this is one of the Paschal Psalms one that they sing in the Passover it's one of the Hallelujah Psalms Oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endures forever to him which divided the Red Sea into parts for his mercy endureth forever notice to him that divided the Red Sea glory be to God he opened up this way through the Red Sea you know and I think about that you realize that within the midst of this right here they had come to a place I believe it's called I can't remember what the pronouncing was reading it you know and some of the rabbinical writings and things like that how that it's called where it leads him right down to that place bow is a Roth or something to that nature which and actually when they had encamped right there before the Red Sea the Bible lets it be known that's a point where they were actually camped there and that very name means Lord of the north and it was an Egyptian god an idol and to think of it that how that God himself would make known his power that here they were before the God or that of what Egypt would look at the Lord of the north think about it now think about it who said I will ascend unto the sides of the north they covered here how the God himself would make himself known within this time and would show his glory in the midst of it oh my eye look at this here in the scripture it says he made Israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy and do it forever but over through Haverhill and his host in the Red Sea about how to spell when I came across this word overthrew well I didn't bout I did have a spell and how I've continued to have a spell this word overthrew it is that word that means is through the idea of the rustling of the lion's mane which accompanies his roar he overthrew Pharaoh by the rustling of the mane that's accompanying his roar it was the roar of the lion that roared in that time and it overthrew payroll it overthrew his chariots on my what is that lion's roar this is my people these are my children I have redeemed them this is my purchase and he roars he roars and he overthrows him with the rustling of his mane go to be to God no wonder Nehemiah you see these things it's something that is very apart there in Israel and I believe a part of our life as the people of God you see one of the things that's been lost down through time I don't have time to deal with the tonight but one of the things that's been lost down through the ages was the very BT of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ was the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and here within the midst of this time remember that he saved them for his namesake that he might make his mighty power to be known in the book of Nehemiah chapter not near my referring back to this moment he says I believe it is in verse 10 he says of how that he showed signs and wonders upon Pharaoh and all his servants and all the people of his land for thou knewest how about dealt proudly against them so did us now get V a name as it is this day Wow so this experience this happening is God getting him a name yeah but he already had a name this he's manifesting his name is that right but you see he's never manifested this in this way heaven knows of it but you see and the angels themselves did not know him to be a savior they do not know him to be a redeemer they do not know him to be a healer no wonder David could say in the Psalms I believe it some 130 oh how excellent is thy name in all the earth he got himself a name what's this here in Exodus 15 verse 4 he goes on here's this singing boy I'll tell you what this was a song now this song wasn't in a hymnal you with me this song wasn't in the hymnal it wasn't anything that they could come back out and say hey Moses Oh ho-ho they'll be singing on these new songs now now I'll be singing on there but you see this was inspiration that was given in this hour you see when you look at it you think of songs that are written and under the inspiration of Almighty God you know you take for example some of the songs that are written there have been wrote here over the past few years and you look within some of those songs and it seems like well it don't seem like there's any mention sometimes of redemption or blood but remember it seems like brother Samuel that we're singing face to face with God it seems like we're there that's called the love affair that's called to wear that the bride is seeing him face to face and you might say well how in the world is that taking place that's not even among people who are you know writers or or bride or whatever mourn yet there are some but how would that be remember voice of the healing recognizing your day and its message brother Ram says brother Moore now Jack Moore he said brother Moore he said notice them he said by being Christians they feel the pull of the hour are you with me they feel the pull of the hour but by not being in luck they don't realize what it's all about they're asking for send allowed to pray fast but you see they don't recognize what it's all about but you see much of that inspiration though that in itself could drop but you see they don't have that representation of meaning of what it has for you and I because you and I do not look at redemption as though that we were unworthy this event you and I by God's grace in this hour it's restored to you and I that we were always saved we were always a part of God we were in the mind of God we were there when the lamb was slain from the foundation of the world think about the very inspiration that strikes the Prophet when brother Graham says the first person he said I seen with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said that calls me to recognize I needed something more he said was that black man as he was standing there and he was preaching think about the scripture brother Brad notice he said all the rest him had been preaching about what was going on down here on earth he said but he dropped back and went clear back beyond the horizontal rainbow and went clear back there and said where were you when the Morningstar shouted for joy and the sons of God shouted he said where would you see that was inspiration within this hour don't you realize sometimes that when you faint for you and I it's not you that has everything or I that have everything but how that God is so divinely set the body together that there are things that you might be praying about you're wondering questions or whatever more and God not have it maybe it comes out through a tape maybe it's there for another member of the body maybe it's through another ministry and all of a sudden that comes you say well why would God do that so that we're not depending on our own selves because we're doomed to fail but our dependency is upon the Lord Jesus Christ and to think of how that God had that place there you said well that was part of the prophets message I agree but there had to be something that would strike him to cause him to move in that direction exactly where God you and I take us back there where we were in the mind of God you know why you go back there and that settling comes in and what we Redemption you realize that you can't fail because God gained failed in Durst and what that does it drives figure out it drive scare out all right now notice within this you know and I'm so thankful to God you know God knows just how to balance the Calvinism and Arminianism but I think sometimes we get too much if I can look at it I think there's still a lot of too much of arminianism still we still look at a lot of things like what we do I'll tell you what its continuing to become more and more real how God shows his mercy that it is not being you and I it's been God's grace I made a choice you made a choice that God already made his spirit moved upon you to make that decision think about where did the faith come from us come from for us to be able to even stand whether it's for healing in the service where did that come from sovereignly given from a sovereign one glory be to God tell you right here in the service last week brother Ray was sitting right back there he told me the testimony after service it's all right brother ray he told me the testament to service he came back nine I know his knee had been bothering me nowhere I prayed about I heard him speaker to Paul but here that we come into this point in time in the service and you know the word is just coming forth and how at that moment para when the Lord begin to speak about standing still he said I had a vision of a leg come right here before me and he said his leg was so swole up than me where he couldn't nearly even walk had to kind of swing it around and you know putting it up and putting socks on and things like that why I know what that's life cuz my wife's had to put socks on me the fast past few weeks because of my back and so I said oh my I know I know what you're talking about but I didn't know about knee but you know what when they come out there after that service he said I found myself just tapping my foot he said while the song service was going on and he said is that was going on he said of find myself here there's no stompin the foot he said the knee itself the swelling was gone I can move that me it was something he said I just seen it that the leg itself placed on the altar of Almighty God excu what did that was it brother ain't no a sovereign God he dropped the faith for that moment same thing he's done for many of us thank God for His mercy I don't know about you but I love seeing God's power I don't want a religion with our power I don't want that power if the religion remember the Bible the Prophet tells us God hates a powerless religion aren't you glad not only power to heal us it's a power that we live right live in holiness live right Oh glory think about this here and how then in Exodus verse 15 or chapter 15 verse 4 verse 4 there verse 10 notice here hi I'm boy I don't have time to get through this adequately but look at this here just for a moment he says in verse 4 how he says that right hand oh Lord he's become glorious and power that right hand Oh Lord had dashed in pieces the enemy and in the greatness of thine excellency thou has overthrown them that rose up against thee thou set us forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together fledge stood up lad as a heap and the debts were congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them I will draw my sword my hand shall destroy them but thou did us blow with I wind and to seek cover them they sink as lead in the mighty waters well Nehemiah records it david records it and another scripture at the top part of this one I just read the Bible says that they sank into the bottom as a stone right here at the very part it says that it sank as led in the mighty waters in other words there was they were not able to overcome the waters because the waters under the command of the Lord come on somebody the Red Sea was not for the Egyptians but the Red Sea was for us come hold somebody hey man this earth it's our mother come on now besides remember over in the Book of Revelations the dragon opened its mouth and spurted out water but the earth helped the woman are you with me so now when you look at this here you find hound that they were slunk as a stone sunk has led what's how this is recorded now the bible in the previous chapter there i'm not going to read it but you see when the israel was walking into the waters how you know i don't want to take you back there do you know to Cecil B DeMille but you remember how it was when some of you've seen it's maybe some of you haven't when the Ten Commandments and you know you think about how they're walking over and then you know God holds this holds that the the Egyptians at bay for a certain time and then God releases there of the Egyptians and they are able to go the Bible doesn't tell us here that when the Egyptians were released to come after Israel but you see God was not going to let just a fourth of that army come into that water because this army it represented Pharaoh's might and his power these horsemen and horse riders represented here these demon powers that had been pursuing the Church of the Living God down through the ages come on somebody not to think of it here of how that in the midst of it when they're walking through the waters and no doubt they probably begin to maybe hear the rumble feel the rumble or they could hear them pursuing and to think maybe you know some of them said hey let's keep moving you know and to think about it you know they were able to make it upon the bank but I wonder when I look how the scripture records it you know to where some of them might have been looking at it and they're just looking one step ahead and they keep on moving but you know the Bible says that the Lord Himself he looked down through the pillar fire through the cloud and he troubled the hosts Israel didn't know that was taking place but you see it was God who was seeing it all the way through all Israel had to do was walk home they just had to walk home they had to follow the word that said keep on moving aren't you glad when this word has taken a hold in your life there's all sorts of skepticism and everything else it don't matter how many websites blog post you no matter what comes your way you're going forward there's something about it that's real oh my I think like Moses where the Bible said Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter but he chose rather to be called a son of Abraham my glory be to God God took off the chariot wheels Israel didn't know about that see it might be something you're dealing with and you don't know that God's trouble in the host may be physical death is pursuing you may be the hounds of hell maybe fence things that's trying to come after you and you may not realize it but just keep walking because God Himself is the one who removed the wheels off the chariots the chariots represented their power and God took those wheels off now remember here Moses stretches he's told by God stretch your hand over I want you to remember this they sink like lead right they sink like a stone the Bible says in Exodus 14 verse 30 and 31 thus the Lord saved Israel who's Israel somebody that has his name Israel Elf they have his name they are prints power with God thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the seashore and Israel saw the great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians and the people feared the Lord believed the Lord and his servant Moses they sank his lid when as a stone to the bottom burned him up like stubble but yet how the scripture records it here that Israel saw the Egyptian notice here they didn't see him the Bible didn't say they saw the mighty warriors they saw Egyptians come on somebody you know Satan wants to blow himself up and try to blow up the things members let me tell you something a demon is nothing but a fallen angel and you remember as you standing there with the baptism of the Holy Ghost remember you have God on your side I hope you're with me now there ain't nothing to stand or to tremble before a demon you why by standing within Christ you've already overcome let me tell you something right now when you're walking in the pathway of the Lord you got to remember whose path you're walking in right here you're walking in his provided way and God is going to take care of this let me tell you something there was not enough self-help books Israel didn't sit down on the seashore and say you know what I'm gonna find out how to overcome this I'm gonna read read read read read read read it's going to take power enough psychology you with me it ain't gonna take lexicon it's gonna take power it's gonna take God's power you see think of this here God wanted Israel to see the dead Egyptians so God allowed them to float up there to the shore you see brother Ram tells us like this and different places in the message he said to think of it what it would be like for those Jews how they felt when they could look back and see the very thing that made and whipped him and beat their backs of straps and pulled him over was now dead floating in the sea he said brother you come through the red sea of the blood of Jesus Christ in every old dirty habit that's drove you to do things that you wouldn't do you'll find it Dan in the blood of Jesus Christ floating on the dead stream believed and goes on to say he said Moses looked back and he saw the taskmasters drown he said that's a type of us coming through the blood of Christ cleansing - sanctifying power set aside from sin looking back and seeing all the smoke and drink and card parties picture shows all the lowlife things of the world dead in the blood of Jesus Christ he goes on to say all them old past masters that made you do things you didn't want to do made you lie and take things and cheat and steal and do everything you ought to do drink and carry a home and go to places you shouldn't you pass through the blood of Jesus Christ you'll see every one of them dead and back there floating in the blood the time keeps going on to st. you see them all things that drove you to do what you didn't want to do but he said what it is you're a slave to it but you see the blood of Jesus Christ it's the person who made the purchase showing his power that is taking you not only out of the market but you're never to be on the slave block again I hope you're with me you're never to be on that slave block again oh my to think of it here of how that Israel and sometimes you would look at it I just close with this sometimes you look at and you think why do things come around my way why is it sometimes you know because there's things that you can come around your way maybe it is some of these things that was named out maybe it's things that would be named presently within this hour maybe it was just some old religious church spirit you know where cuz we got a lot of that around the message and things like that too but you know it could just be something like that that God took her took Church anity out of your life it grew to a place to where you said you know what I need to know God for myself it's not enough to know that this message is the truth I don't want to be inducted by that same god of the word and it's something how he deals with your life and you see how that God himself we're gonna allow things to encroach and come about and try to touch our life but notice all of that is witnesses come on now it's witnesses that those things are dead and you're no longer bound to that so sometimes when you experience the temptation you say why why would I experience the temptation because God would allow and permit it and Satan is there to try to move but God will allow it to remind no longer a slave no longer asleep and he'll let you see it on the seashore of your life as a witness yes indeed I am for you now you're free but God lets it be a direct witness to you that you can see what he Cink has led you can see what he burnt up a stubble you can see what he dropped in the sea as a stone aren't you glad I'm so thankful to the whole mighty God what a reason Moses had to sing in the spirit what a reason Miriam had of echoing it they saw something to rejoice about come on friends they saw something to rejoice about you know I brother Branham called him Pentecostals he called him holy rollers he called him where others would look at him and call him fanatics now no doubt they had people in that hour that knew how to search out Pentecost Pentecostal and search that out in the query and pull it up and try to make every little bit of display of joy in the camp of Almighty God as though it's some kind of work up I'll tell you what people got problems that do that you got problems you're missing the joy of the Lord you're missing the joy of the Lord o brother Samuel everything is not perfect I know including you but there is one who is perfect there is one who is working in our midst there is one who is cleaning up lives there is one who is changing us there is one who is dismantling holds upon lives there is one in our midst who is still healing the sick healing the sick in the body healing the sick and the soul there still is a living God among us displaying his power making his name to be known her glory you know let's just stop here let's just stop don't you love him oh my to think of it but the RAM says that like this he said you know when he came into Simon's house he said all the rest of them when that woman came in they started whispering oh oh you know she's gonna mess up his reputation brother Ram said hold it all sinners don't mess up Jesus reputation his reputation is made where he takes sinners and changes him aren't you glad you see his reputation in your life it's the same he's the same yesterday today and forever it's a reputation his name it has a reputation and in our lives by His amazing grace his power is made known for his namesake that I'm still the saying aren't you glad oh ma let's just stop here tonight don't you love you don't you appreciate these journeys that the Holy Spirit just take us on little things that he just opens up oh ma tell you just means so much to me to show him that how these things that God would polish up show us these little nuggets because you know this is part of our journey this right here that we're looking at it's not just something that was just some type of something that took place and it's passed on but God was laying it down not only as a type of sanctification that God was also laying this down as a type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost he was laying it down that's the words of the Prophet he also laid this down as a type of that sea of glass of when one day we will stand on the other side and we will sing and rejoice and we will sing the song of Moses he hath triumphed gloriously let's just stop here tonight let's pray Lord Jesus fathers we bow our hearts in your presence how thankful we are in this hour Lord that you would make known your glorious name Lord when we think of this Lord the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my lord it's something that sweeps over our soul Lord it's something Lord that just resonates within our hearts it's not just something Lord there's many who can receive tears and other things and that Lord we don't despise any of that or knocking that no matter Lord coz we know that people can only come to a place that you've allotted them to come to but when we think of it Lord God we not only think lord god of you paying the price for us the lord we're thankful dear God to where the word is preached in power and demonstration to where the name of Jesus Christ is preached and believed just as it was in the early church Nord God that the name of the Lord is a strong tower that father to see that were identified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ by that quickening power by your life Lord moving upon our life Oh God it's not just something we talk about it's not just something of a memory that we look back 2,000 years ago but we recognize the Lord God that we are the very reason we are part of that Lord and that's your power the deity of the name of Jesus Christ that same power and authority has moved in our life same reputation that it was among our brothers and sisters down through the ages Lord God we say that by your grace not that we merited it no no we could never do that Israel did not merit you opening the red scene you wanted to display your power father out pray here this evening no doubt there's knees there is that's setting right here maybe there's lives or God but there's things that they've been struggling with they've been enslaved with maybe it's fashions of the world pressures but father tonight they're ready to stand still father to look at you to focus on you maybe Lord it's things your God of areas in their life maybe things Lord that they're looking at that they all not be looking at father you know the needs or it I pray

that you would make your power known in their life maybe they just stand still and see the salvation of the Lord granite Lord God maybe there's one here Lord tonight they're suffering in their body Lord God were sickness is trying to take them I'm pray tonight father we're gonna I don't have to ask for the angel God to go between that sickness and then you're already there but I ask the Lord God father you would make your power known in their life Lord I'll think of it here over the past year actually over the past couple of years but when I think just within this past year how you've made your power known Lord how many different needs that you feel that are outright miracles things that Lord God doctors could not touch father you did not do that to give us a great name no that's you making your name known that's you Lord God letting us know that father when we can look and we can see it stimulates it stirs our faith Lord something about it or gone to what David said Lord I long to see what you're doing in the sanctuary I long to see it out here if we could paraphrase it I long to see it out here in my everyday life Lord God I want to say thank you Lord right here as a congregation Lord we want to say thank you Lord Jesus father how that you have moved Lord so many different needs or God that you've moved on Lord God father experiences Lord I realize that these things can be encouragement even from one assembly to another but I realize Lord that it's encouragement it's what Lord that you would do to encourage a sword to show and make known your power your great name Lord that our faith would be built father we thank you for that but dear God truly signs and wonders accompany the believer and we believe that Lord God we are believers sword you said in my name they shall cast out devils they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover this is your word it's the Great Commission it's given to the Church of the Living God Lord Jesus I pray
