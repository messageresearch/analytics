think what this Easter morning resurrection time what it means to us certainly would love to see everyone here where I'm not preaching few couple people in the camera but I know that God is is president that same God that you would sense right there come right there right where you're at same God right here has been an it is anointing has just been the same even very very great during these times he's made his self visible here so we just want we just want him to have his way in this service this morning just want to greet you the name of the Lord Jesus Christ just want to look into the word of the Lord if you will help us here this morning and if you would if you'll turn with me to Psalm 146 and I want to just read through this Psalm this morning in Psalms 146 perhaps as you have to have turned there or are turning there we'll just just offer a word of Prayer our Heavenly Father Lord as we just come before you this morning how think for we are for your mercy or God thankful Lord for your great provision Lord for our lives Lord to know that oh god you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord that's the message that is burning in our hearts Lord Oh God evident Lord in our life I ask Lord Jesus that this morning that may there come a stir among us Lord may there be an Easter Lord in every home Lord every heart this morning Oh God Lord we just asked your blessing in your direction upon your word may you come Oh God and just Lord confirm your word take it to our hearts Lord guide and direct us Lord we are just the Lord awaiting you and your leadership Lord for this moment Lord we pray we thank you for your grace Lord upon our lives and your mercy Lord Oh God we just ask that you'll just take control now father in the name of Jesus Christ amen Psalms 146 verse 1 praise ye the Lord praise the Lord O my soul while I live will I praise the Lord will I praise the Lord I will sing praises unto my god while I have any being put not your trust in Princes nor in the Son of man in whom there is no help his breath goeth forth he returned it to his earth in that very day his thoughts tear happy as he that hath the God of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord is God which made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is which keepeth truth forever which executed judgment for the oppressed which giveth food to the hungry the Lord loose me loosen the prisoners the Lord opened the eyes of the blind the Lord raiseth them that are bowed down the Lord loveth the righteous the Lord preserveth the strangers he relieving the fatherless and widow but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down the Lord shall reign forever even though God o Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord amen may God bless you as you're being seated and I just would like to take a very very simple title here this morning and we know that it certainly is not in the length of the title but it is in the author coming to express that title and make it real to our hearts and I just want to speak these words happy Easter the things too as we find that brother branham would mention it like this to us in the great and mighty Conqueror and he would speak of he says may it be that it's a happy Easter to everyone of us it's one of the greatest days this is a commemoration of the resurrection of our Lord it's one of the greatest days of all the world's history it's the resurrection and this is this is where our our happiness and our reality is tied to not just that he raised but we have also raised with him and because of what it means to to us as as believers I realized that this you know maybe would seem to be a peculiar text that would be read for a time of Easter but to look at it it is it is something that just filling on my heart to move in this direction and perhaps the Lord will help us then too to see this when we look in the scriptures I I take I take that thought because we know that Easter itself is more than just a time of the year it's more than just a memorial if if it's only just a memorial to us and there is no more than just that of something that we remember or something were you know many times people will come together as a family and yet many of the things not even realizing why this is what is it about this moment that would be so special that would cause us to remember remember the Lord Jesus when he was unfolding the Varon the Passover when he had said I desired to eat this Passover with you remember when he he had taken the bread and blessed it and then he took the cup and blessed it and he spoke of the bread he said take and eat this is my body and he said drink of this of this of the cup he said for in this this is the blood of the New Testament or the life contained therein and He blessed that to know that there would be through the varying through the very offering up of his life that here that we you and I would receive what we would have need of to actually come to a living reality in our lives with God and we we see this and I want to draw your attention to the students sure of Psalms 146 and verse 5 and the scripture would say happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help I I just feel to stop here for a moment I want you right here if you've got a need on your heart you already know this but I feel an unction of the Holy Ghost you pray upon your heart and you ask God Lord you come speak to my heart this morning now as I read this scripture in verse 5 happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help whose hope is in the Lord his God notice not happy was are not happy will be but happy is and this word happy is also the word that is used you will find it used in the in the Hebrew that speaks of blessedness of the blessedness that would reside in the heart and life of the believer happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for himself this speaks of a present tense a living reality this is not something of a past event it's a living reality and this is why that as the believers as the believers as a child of God we should be the happiest people in the world because not only has Jesus raised from the dead but he's here with us the same faith that was once delivered to the Saints that they have contended for that saying faith is right here among us that same God working among us to show himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever how reminds you Jesus took time in there especially in the book of of John where he would speak on the coming of the comforter on the Spirit of Truth and he would declare to them that you have joy now but soon you will have sorrow but he said your sorrow is going to be turned unto joy and he let them know they were not aware of what he was talking about but he let him know that once your sorrow has been turned to joy and he ties it into that of a woman that is in travail that when she has in travail orders of great sorrow and pain is taking place but once that which she has held within now has been delivered or brought forth or made manifest then the sorrow is turned to joy that a man child is born into the world he was speaking of when his life now recognize this he was speaking of when his life that has as Eve herself remembers she didn't have her own name but when she is taken out of Adam as Adam was put to sleep God put Christ to sleep open up the side and took out the elements that would go to make up the bride of Jesus Christ it is not something outside of word but it must come from him and he knowing that by his word that you and I as a believer here this morning as one that you may not even be a believer but there is a tug or a pull upon your heart and me just say it like this but the random would go on to say he said you ought to be a happy person that God would even lead you and you would even want to come and hear the word of the Lord he said keep following him and he leads you to the fountain of eternal life don't stop just because you hear the word the word is only to point out to you there is a fountain that is open in the house of David that can take the unclean and make them clean so how that God would would so work in a life to where it would be his own life coming back to that part of husband and wife it would be God's own life that would come into the believer there on the day of Pentecost and remember they would not be reflecting a church a church as a woman they will not be reflecting a church because to reflect a woman is to reflect fallen condition is to reflect deception but remember they were to receive that of the man Christ Jesus the Holy Ghost which Peter said the hidden man of the heart they were to receive a headship of that of a life that would come to them showing that the Dominion of the world had been broke from over their life and so what our happiness that we ought to have remember they were sad when they were walking in Luke 24 as you read of the events leading up to the resurrection even when he was taken like the lamb was taken and inspected prior to the Passover they did not know what was taking place but the scripture was being fulfilled from the book of zechariah smite the Shepherd and the sheep will be scattered but it did not say the wolves would be scattered they were always sheep the sheep were scattered it would take the Shepherd to come and bring the sheep back together and that's what he did after his resurrection the sheet sent word together the sheet together there's only one way that the sheep are brought together and that's by his word for he said my sheep know me and I am known of them his voice in his word we know his voice and that is his word this is why when the Spirit of God in no matter where it's at in a life but how God would even begin to deal with a heart you ought to be happy that God has even spoke to your heart let me just say it to you like this this morning you might look in your life and say I've got so many different things in my life brother Samuel I really need I really need your real sanctification I really need the baptism of the Holy Ghost let me just tell you something take off that sadness and be happy because God has already dealt and began dealing with your life what should I do be happy in the Lord and look to God to lead you to what the desire is in your life to a fulfilling of that they were sad let me just say it to you when you are sad oh man think about how the prophets said we were made to be happy we were not made to walk around worried worried is not something of the Spirit of God worry is a spirit of permit we were not made to be worried we were not made to live sad that is not how God made us to live that is not humility that is distrust in Jehovah and when the enemy can get us in a place where we're discouraged like he got them as they were walking on in on the road to him he made us remember he starts porn and on when the enemy can get you discouraged but RAM said that's when he wants to pour it on they started what did they start doing they started acting like people whose very life line had been taken out you see what it was depression was moving in a poem where Peter said what are we gonna do let's go fishin they didn't know what in the world to do they just went on back to their lives they went back to try to relieve themselves they their expectations that they had that they had thought we thought he should have been the one to redeem Israel and he is the Redeemer but what happened is their thoughts about things was not lining up with the thoughts of God but God in His mercy because they were a part of that thought then God in His mercy he came and he sought them out a man it was Mary Magdalene at the tomb that morning let me just tell you something here for a moment the first ones that saw Jesus when he rose was women come on somebody he was Mary Magdalene went to the tomb then there were other women that were there with him now are you with me now and you're recognized here they were and here when Mary you know she didn't she did this is a gardener that's what she's supposed him to be but when he spoke her name she recognized who it was she knew because when he called her name it moved it did something it released it brought the reality of who it is that's talking to her don't you realize this hid her eyes was withholding from knowing him standing there but as soon as he spoke she recognized this is not a gardener this is rabona my master my lord why he called her name hello glory be to God in the highest they were sad and walking around with sadness and Jesus even steps out there in Luke 24 they didn't recognize him but he began to step out and he begins to walk with them and they had they are sad in their communications but notice he had told them that their sorrow would be turned to joy and when their sorrow would be turned to joy remember what he told him you'll have a joy that no man will be able to take from you it's a joy that no matter what circumstances arise no man will be able to take this joy from you I'm telling you this as an everlasting eternal joy within a heart as a believer we can go through all sorts of things and things sometimes you seem like you're praying for and it seems like everything is happening contrary but there's a joy in our heart because the joy of the Lord is our strength we know in whom we have believed I said happy is the man who's helped whose help is the God of Jacob happy is that man when they came out of the tomb remember Jesus met him he met him when they begin when they were told go tell my disciples and Jesus appears before the women and he says all hell those two words oh hell that word is a salutation of great cheerfulness it's a salutation of great joy hallelujah I mean you say it like this he's a present God happy is is he the scripture opens to us even in Acts chapter 1 and it expresses like this it says all Theophilus in sense of all that Jesus began no how it opens the book of Acts is not the Acts of the Apostles is the acts of the Holy Ghost in and through the Apostles because it was not men acting upon their own account this was God that same Jesus now reflected in the body of his bride that which he began to do and teach you see his death brother ran will pick it up like this in the token he said his death did not stop him he was only the beginning you see all of that lights and shadows that was laid within the Old Testament but it all was pointing through that of a real Liberty of a freedom of a working of the Spirit of Christ because remember you and I were not here in a rightful condition that's right and this is why there had to come the crucifixion thank God for Calvary but it didn't stop there it put him in the tomb but it didn't stop there he went down and into hell and he laid every one of the sin upon the devil you know the Bible said I believe it's in Romans five he was delivered for our offenses I'm telling you it don't matter if it's something past present future he gathered up the sin of the world you know what he paid the price for every sin he saddled the question of sin death he deposited the Lord and he rose up on that Easter morning but it didn't stop where it kept on going because if it stops there then we are still in sin we are still in bondage but because he rose he came with a message to you and I because I live you shall live also he gathered them there and he spoke to them he revealed himself through the stretchers and he told them as he breathed on them he said I've sinned the promise of the Father upon you you shall be endued with the Holy Ghost this is his promise what that he would be the Living God the present God working among his people this is why Hebrews 13:8 is not just a scripture no scripture is just a scripture all Scripture is given by inspiration from God but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he's the same he has never changed I'm God and I changed or not man has changed but God has never changed he revealed himself to John when John was there on the Isle of Patmos he would reveal himself to John and let John know in verse 17 fear not I am the first and the last I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and have the keys of hell and death I want you understand this he he himself he went and he paid the price you see here he was he died he here he was but now the Spirit of Christ the Spirit of God in Romans 11 says if that spirit that raised up Christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal body why because to show that these seeds must be raised to life that you and I were dead in sin and trespasses there was no way for you and I to get out of it Oh God had given little glimpses where the Holy Spirit would move through revelation you know it would move upon the prophets of old it would move down upon their and through the elect now they were offering the lamb but now there was coming a promise of one that he would come and he would dwell with us even in us because the scripture declares he that is the Lamb of God the identification of the Promised One is he on whom the Spirit comes and abide and that's exactly the same way it is for every son and daughter of God brother the spirit don't come and leave the Spirit comes and abides it takes its abode in its temple that it has cleaned up that it has called for its glory and it's SATs down here badge on the inside oh my you cannot separate God from his people amen when the Holy Ghost has come it is a seal of the Living God I said yes he that has the God of Jacob for his help been everything that you got need of you have the overcoming power within you this is why we should be the happiest people in the world then they reminds you happiness does not consist of what goods of the world you own go ahead save and do everything you can to get certain goods it'll be out on the street in a few years if not a few months by the shirt by the dress by whatever it is and you save and save eventually the threads will wear bare your taste for it will fade what is it because it's just a material it's just things of this earth my brother there is one thing that does not fade and that's the joy of the Lord oh I wish I had some witnesses right now a man of where through many dangers toils and snares I have already come his Grace had brought me safe thus far it'll safely take me on home oh let me tell you something that's real children of God oh my the road is not easy oh is it easy from the inside is it easy to live a Christian life it is because it's his life on the inside but the road the path is not an easy path it's not an easy road our position the matter of fact every force of darkness is against us but oh what a promise in reality we have that if God be for us who can be against us greater is He that is in us than he that's in the world I said happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help this is why we are to be the happiest people that's living in this day Christians trelles especially in this hour as they believer to realize our Redemption draweth nigh we recognize that more and more the signs and those things that we see happening all around old brother it is a happy time for us because this world is not our home this is we're just Pilgrims and strangers I'm as much a pilgrim or a stranger here as I would be when I went to the Philippines I'm not a citizen there I don't belong there I just went there for a visit and the reality of it is though this body right here might be an American but I've got a different citizenship on the inside I've been born of the Spirit of God oh my brother when the word came my way I believed and got the passport and then after I got the passport he said go on up there and receive the visa on your passport that will guarantee your entry you know that visa says that visa says I've got all the necessary inoculation all that I need to give hair brother he injects his life back into us we are Pilgrims and strangers happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help I'm he even liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore I've got the keys of hell and of death this is why blue Rann would tell us like this don't you look you said for anything greater you can't have no greater than the Holy Spirit you got it right now you see this is the problem many don't have it this is why they run to and fro there'll be a famine a famine in the last days come on for what hearing the word of God where will the famine be the famine is in the hearing a person can hear it it could be preached right over them but unless the hearing he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church oh brother you see what a blessed reality when the Holy Ghost has come he reveals the truth places you in the truth and becomes the truth leading you on the inside oh man this is why there's a famine there is no lack with the Lord I'm telling you right now you can take the very words jesus wept if the Holy Ghost gave that to be preached this morning the Holy Ghost will take that word this morning and he'll whip every devil he'll meet every need he'll circumcise every heart he'll cast out every devil you want to know why because he's making it known and real that it's the same God come down and become one of us and took our sin upon himself and paid that price and release back the Holy Ghost Satan cannot stand in the presence of the revealed word when the angel of the Lord is passing to deliver that word let me just tell you right now there's the angel of the Lord that accompanies my ministry there's the angel of the Lord that I cut every ministry every one this pawn of the Spirit of God come on now the message investments brother branham even tells us that when Joshua stood there that day remember what the people's charge was there in Joshua it said let us see that God that was with Moses let him comfort himself with you as well and we will follow why because the people of God are not following me they are following saith the Lord the teller of fire the Spirit of Truth that's how God leads his people by his word is that right oh yeah don't let that shake you the same God who gave the word he's here with us happy is the had that he people who have the God of Jacob for their help whose hope is in the Lord amen the angel of the Lord he was with them through the journey in the wilderness is that right Amen that presence the Holy Spirit was present with them to guide them through the wilderness keep him in the way bring him into the place that he prepared for us he's here with us to bring us into my father's house are many mansions don't look for anything greater you can't have no greater than the Holy Spirit is that right when Jesus remember what he said he said greater works than these shall you do not more not not not not ones that would be bigger or greater it means more of the same but where the profit would take that up greater than this he said what it would be he said his mouth the declaration would be preached the Holy Ghost is come and that is the greater works amen to preach the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the resurrection of Jesus Christ it is an Easter coming personally to you and in you and living through you ho glory this is why the scripture this is why when it come to Gideon Gideon said if God be with us we'll be all his miracles where is the god of power come on now where is the god of power where is this where is that same nature you know Israel the Spirit of God will begin to move upon Israel the Bible records it in Isaiah 52 and Isaiah 53 that it'll become a longing in the hearts of Israel that for all God Oh for the arm of that power and thy strength as that has opened the Red Sea they will begin to call for the same power of the same God to come and manifest himself you know why because when there is a desire within the heart for God to come God is going to move upon that life there's a message of the real baptism of the Holy Ghost that is to go to Israel after the rapture of the Gentile bride and they will come to know his power he is just the same oh yeah glory be to God because remember when Naomi and Ruth came back it was barley seasoned barley is resurrection power a man when Ruth herself here and Gentile bride the Gentile bride comes in resurrection power is a right and Naomi herself coming back comes into resurrection power war glory if God be for us we're beyond his miracles now let's look here just a few moments let me just take just a few moments here and just preach how he breaks it in Psalms 146 this is what this is what hearing notice happy years which made heaven and earth the sea and all that therein is I want you to notice this is the only word which may that goes back to past tense let me preach a little bit now you see in the midst of Everest chapter every verse if every verse does not reveal Jesus Christ to be the same then something's wrong with that revelation not the verse happy is remember he reveals himself in the book of revelations he which was which is and which is to come amen he is the Lord God Almighty notice how it's revealed which may he which made heavens and earth and sea and which all are all very early this is what the Lord God did notice the consideration this same God that would be on my side this same God that I can say I am happy because he is my help he is my expectation because what he is the one when there was nothing God did not start taking atoms and molecules and generate something there was no atom or molecules nothing it was nothing but a know him before the Angels but notice in his mind he already had the plan laid out and notice he spoke notice he spoke and when he spoke then what happened the word began to come into expression that begin to come and begin the four things begin to come into their place what by His Word and the earth itself became a watered garden of eden and was transformed from a darkness of chaos and voidness into a beautiful water garden of eden because it obeyed the word of the lord and it came and it moved around the sun think about it this which made heaven and earth see and all there in the Lamb's Book of Life was already wrote in his mind come on now revelation 13:8 the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world Isaiah 53 it speaks past tense because why it's already a finished work in the mind of God it was just to be made manifest it's letting us know that where our happiness is derived from is because we know where we have come from and where we are going we know who is over it all God is over let me just say like this the same deity of God the same one where the scripture said all things were made by him in John 1:3 it goes on to say he created all things by Jesus Christ what is that his word it's his word that brings creation her brother it takes more than just reading the word it takes him who is the word to step into that word and bring that word to life hey man to where it moves from where it's not the deity in heaven but the deity that was in heaven is now inside of you and me is to make us aware of the same God that was there and that same God is dwelling here oh I think how what brother Ram said he said to think he said that he said of a born-again Christian he said you take a man who's the center that's never known what it is to really you know have his sin deck clean and his heart filled with God he said he cannot even imagine how the mighty God who I love this language he said how the mighty God would desire to come down and be reconciled and become buddies buddies with that man I'm telling you God wants to be your buddy God wants to be your friend God wants to be your helper your buddy one who sticks closer to you then a brother oh it means something to me grow repeat of God Oh to think of it he keepeth truth forever God keepeth his word he's watched over his word he's kept his word even even what God has promised remember he keeps truth his word is truth but remember the word is a person jesus said I am the way the truth and the life so the keeping of truth is God coming to fulfill his word now here in the scripture let me just pause here just for a moment in the script circles we're looking at this happy is because we realized that for many Easter itself would be no more than just Easter lilies that's all that is for many it's no more than just a hat or a dress and yet if we bring it on down to there may be there's many vetted that could even have teary eyes when they would think of Calvary thank God for that if it's really from the heart but to recognize the Calvary was to pay the debt in other words to make you acquitted of the charges that were against you that you would have a right to believe now listen to me now this is why he was raised for our justification a person that is called by the Spirit of God in justification the same devil the same spirit the one that made him live filthy when they were in the world when they can just respond to the call that there is an acquittal of all charges and they can rise and believe that though they can say Lord forgive me of my sins lord how repent Lord Jesus I need you as my Lord and Savior they can still have all the habits all the world the same one that made them do it out there is still living right there inside of their life what needs to happen they need to go deeper to where now the work of the acquittal the work of the blood being applied how do you apply the blood you apply the blood by obedience you take the simplicity of the word and you obey it when the scripture said repent God can't repent you've got to repent the says you'd be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ God can't be baptized you've got to do that you've got the two parts that you have to do in obedience to God's Word and God said I'll do something that you can't do and there's no man can do it no Church can do it and that is I will give you the gift of the Holy Ghost you can't earn it you can't merit it it's got your name on it it's been under the tree of Calvary with your name on it he'll my it was all wrapped up just for you to be delivered in this hour now let just tell like this anybody that really wants to be free they can be free and you have my permission to call anybody who says I really wanted to be free but you know what God never set me free you've got my permission according to the Word of God to call him a liar because they did not want to be free if you ever want to be free you are already free he has already paid for every offense right now he has already have been raised for our justification a full acquittal where you and I can believe on him well glory be to God you see it just depends on how much and do you really want it notice the scripture goes on in in here in 90 Bruce chapter 9 when we begin to talk about this life now remember there is a covenant that God has made there's no way remember the covenants that God would make with man when God made it to where man had to keep a certain part man couldn't keep it man always failed for him going from the very beginning in the first dispensation of innocence man fell from that covenant but then men see how that God was setting in an example of the unconditional covenant there with Abraham to where it was not based upon Abraham's merits it was not based upon Abraham's work was not based upon his status or who he was it was the unmerited grace of God the sovereignty of God's election and we find that within this covenant that God is not asking if you will I will but I have already is that right then we find of how that from out of that unconditional coming it you have found that later on I believe it's alms eighty nine where we begin to rerun folded to us of the sure mercies of David of how that God has dealt with David and how that there is to be that of the temple man of a tabernacle one that will actually be raised up but he's speaking prophetically much all the way through Psalms eighty-nine it is the sure mercies of David which was the fulfillment in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ it's being fulfilled in the lives of the believers by the same Holy Spirit the same God who gave it it will be fulfilled in through the lives of the 144,000 and it will all come to pass there even the wedding supper there in the Millennium there in the future home but sure mercies of David are continually being unfolded when God makes a covenant even when you read there at some point in time there can be all kinds of falling short in within that covenant but remember God's God's Word is not anchored to flesh God's Word is who the ears it is anchored to him who cannot lie it's anchored to him who cannot repent he's not man that he should repent or lie he is one who has made his word and his word is sure Oh glory be to God notice here it speaks of how how much more verse fourteen Hebrews nine how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the Eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God purge your conscience there's got to be a purging of the conscience the soul from dead works to serve the Living God let me just skip this just for time to move down through here Paul would go on to bring this forth that in order just as the first covenant as the first Testament as that which was given at first it was given and dedicated or inaugurated brought forth with blood so would this estimate in order for this Testament to come forth remember jesus said this is the New Testament in my blood remember in order for this Testament to come into force whatever a testator has said like if you were to go to make out a will and you know my son can have this my daughter can have this and this and this and this that will is for when you are deceased when you die or you pass then what is wrote in that will those who are wrote in there can actually come when it is made known to them or somehow they have an inclination daddy left me address her daddy left me a bedroom said mama left me this this set whatever it is that has been wrote in there and designated you can actually go and make a claim upon and this is exactly where had the Lord Jesus himself when he calmed brother he did not come with another along another another list of Commandments he did not come with another law he came to fulfill that word he came to represent this is what Phasis is what the first Adam was when he walked with God one who could hear lip two-year he came to represent and identify this is what every son and daughter of God is to be and will be his life was a witness that there are gonna come more just like me glory be to God amen there will be more sons and daughters of God for that is why he came to this earth he came to redeem that which belong to him he came to bring it out of the pawnshop brother he sent back the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is the receipt that lets it be known his presence coming right in to your living room right now it lets it be known that every promise that is made whatever your need is whatever it promised that he's made he is present to fulfill that word Oh glory this is why we serve God with living signs because the Bloods been applied and the life is within the blood a man is not a dead God went well he used to do that he's the same yesterday today and forever as he raised up that body on the Easter morning here to take nothing less than the same power of the Holy Ghost by the same vindicated word to raise a body in rapture cuz he said I am Alpha and Omega he ain't diminished in power and listen it can't be power without word that come together I said they come together is that right well notice this serving the Living God serving him his living presence right among us it's his living presence he does the same he does the same that he did before this is where the scripture would say in mark 16 the Lord was with them they went preaching the gospel and the Lord was with them confirming the word with signs and wonders following is that right that's what Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also verse sentir look at this in in sums 146 verse 7 look every one of these I want you to notice keepeth executed every one of these down through here executed giveth Lucifer openness raiseth loveth preserveth reliever every one of them are present tense realities that's why as a as a believer happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help let me tell you what he does this is the kind of here just for a moment verse 7 now these things are packed full you could spend a month of Sundays on this here which executed judgment for the oppressed let me tell you what oppression is it's a devil oppression is one who is under the control of another and they can't get free but he comes who who does happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help the same one that looses Jacob the Bible said in the Book of Jeremiah a stronger one than he had gathered him back home loosen it whoo-hoo executed gentlemen you know a sickness is an oppression come on somebody Amen we're on top no questions now feeling it's a devil it's a tormentor a sickness a disease I'm talking about a condition of a soul a man like you take a 1 lakh who was by the name we know him as Legion we don't know what his name is but the man was a very good man but it all started one time like he just took one little drink hit one little thing started it he took one little look he started with one little thing that he thought I can control it I'll be all right and what did it do it overtook his life - eventually or even come in at times oh he had a sweetness sometimes about him he would be around his family but then all of a sudden there'd be a time them Devils would come back and drive him right back out into the tombs I'm telling you brother it was a devil I think many times what we're calling personalities on people is nothing but Devils it is not personalities it is absolutely demons of oppression that would want to bind the children of God but I've got news for the devil this morning there is one that is with me in me and anointing this word that execute judgment on the oppressed that absolutely can take that word and Pierce the devil's hide with it I tell you this morning in the name of the Lord quit being the devil's playground if you're being oppressed this morning there's one is greater ball we can preach on that but let's just moon we just want this one just go as he just directed this is what he also does he give a food to the hungry hallelujah David said he's satisfied for long and soul he fell at the hungry soul with goodness you know God made a man to thirst but he made they put that thirst within him and the only way that first ever be satisfied is by the one who put it in a lot of things the devil can try to give and fill it with different things this is why you have things people change from this to this and do that and to this and to that and to that look this is why you find even among the athletes in the sports and people who are famous look at they got all the money in the war and see if they got so much money they could bottle it up like Kleenexes and blow their nose on it and throw it away they got someone they got so much money but look what it's done many times you order you see their lives their lives are nothing but dope addicts and drunkards and prostitutes and whoremongers and adulterers and everything else why because they have not found the one who can satisfy that first I'm telling you you can look all the way through life you can look up and down and say when I get this I've got it alright I get this I've got it let me just tell you right now they are nothing but empty promises from hell they are not full of life whatsoever they leave your only wanting something else but if you ever meet God in the power of his resurrection according to his word blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled rather the world is gone there is no more love for the world there's no more case or desire for the world he is your all-in-all the salmon do stir get hungry yeah but not for anything the appetites been changed no Sam you just don't know how fun is you mean sin sending fun the Bible says the sin is bread but for a season pleasure for a season come on now that's how Satan wanted to sell that bill to Eve in the beginning he came and begin to talk to her about the tree he put his hand begin to touch her her hand she begin to have emotions move through her body well how I feel like I've never felt before he's making me feel so special no it's not he's drawing you out into a trap that's exactly what he's doing it was moving into such a way till it even moved in her mind what he was saying became an imagination between them right in her mind so much for them said she said Wow wouldn't that be a thrill he moved her into that place simply by touching her he made it as though hold this is one thing that'll be so much fun it will just give you so much joy what did it do it brought through that one yielding to that one word it brought every sickness it opened up a hole where in that Satan could never get in to the to the people of God he had opened up a hole to let every germ disease every devil every sin sickness everything back in but all my there was one who came down and he took our place and mother he said with my life inside of you I will seal you and your shell will be preserved and it will lead to a change of the body oh I'm glad he giveth food to the hungry aren't you I'm glad he gives us our daily bread you see every one of these happy is he you've got to be a witness of it you got to be a witness for you can start telling other people come on now the way to be a witness of it is to have that same life the same God who is the word the same Living God living and making himself known to be the same living signs living wonders the Lord loosen a--the the prisoners it meant amazing isn't this amazing that how that Satan would come around and promise people he will use agents and he will promise people you can be free there just over the top you know that that stuff I tell you about a prophet and you know that stuff about you know you can't cut your hair and wearing that and those are those are things yes that's in God's Word but notice how that the enemy will just so put it on my this is so over-the-top and look at their lives bound their lives are full of sin and the Bible says they come bound trying to promise you Liberty you can never you never adequately disclose Liberty unless you're a product of it if you're not a product of Liberty you don't know what you're talking about in Liberty is more than a state of mind Liberty is more than just about living in the land of the free I'm talking about a Liberty where you are set free and that reality moves in to your life you're no longer a prisoner a prisoner is one who does what somebody else wants them to do well I can't help it I can't get free of this no Christ has already made you free will you believe what he's done for you are you willing do you hate it enough so you wanna dance if a person don't hate it it'll stay right there you gotta hate that devil let me tell you something I have it is a devil it's an unclean spirit don't try to put quotes on it don't try to don't try to doctor it up and make it look real good I have it here's a devil it's a place where a devil can congregate but there is to be we're gonna let no devil have any place in your life there is a greater one that is present that lucema 'the prisoners how sad it would be if we did not have the president living God how sad it would be if we did not have a token and were admonished to apply it apply it think of it brother branham uses what I just quoted living signs from a living word by living presence those words those sentences are spoken right after he said take this token and apply to your families apply it to your homes apply it to your loved ones thank God that we've got a living reality I remember her different ones you know that I went to school with here's what they said they said you know what Samuel hit that they said Sam they call me Sam they said you know what they said his daddy and mom and they sent him off to a youth camp I'll tell you what he got his mind changed around now that's what they thought because they had seen that guy before but what they didn't realize is I hadn't got my mind changed but there had been a great work of the supernatural God it was not a camp that changed me it was the same God that came there and met Paul on the road to Damascus I met that same God I didn't meet a tape or a book I met the God who set the message where the message said come unto me oh you better heavy laden and I will give you Savio's for your soul reach me from the prison house this is the presence of the Living God not did it in the past no no he still doesn't he Lucinda 'the prisoners Oh glory he loosened Peter when Peter was in a common prison he loosened Paul and Silas when they were in the Philippian prison you see there's times you can still get into prisons sometimes you can get into prisons in your mind sometimes you can get into prisons prisons which are actually traps come on now traps that are not even all together with me even sinful it looks so innocent but it's a trap it's hindering you from walking as a son and daughter of God ought to walk it is where victory becomes a word of the past and only something to look for in the future but victory is not past or present it's a present tense reality I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me [Applause] prisons that need to be set free but this is the presents God he openeth the eyes of the blind he not only came in Auckland been naturalized let me do something what kind of a God who can do that the Pharisees could quote the Scriptures but when that Living God began to show up the same I am that sent Moses and met Moses and they claim to be Moses disciples but when the I am stood before them and here was a man who didn't even have even any apples clay was put upon his eyes and he was told to go wash in the pool of Siloam what happened there were eyes bad the creator himself that came into there and he now had eyes he that did not even have eyeballs now there came eyes they didn't even that all they said was this is Beelzebub you're breaking the Sabbath this is all they knew was a letter letter the other letter they didn't know the Living God of the world but he opened the eyes of the blind and let me just tell you something he not only opened the eyes of those who were physically blind there are multiple accounts of that in our day he opened up the eyes of the blind will it be to God but what's more important than your physical eyes being open is your spiritual eyes to have our spiritual eyes open is more important than any physical if we had our dreads or our Rather's we would rather be I'd rather be physically blind than to be spiritually blind hey man because remember the Pharisees they said we see and Jesus said because you said you see your sin remains they seen but they didn't see as far as to recognize who it was and the heart was not given to it they tried to kill it they tried to eradicate it but brother you cannot stop God he openeth the eyes of the blind I once was blind but now I see let me just tell you real personal I said in a message Church that he was a pastor of a message church which for many of you out there some that may be listening don't know that and I set four years then I know it's true I knew it was truth did I understand about mom and dad did I know what it was what made him tick not at all I couldn't understand it it was a mystery they could tell me about it did you believe it's true yeah I believe it's truth I've seen a difference between others I've seen a difference where you see things where word is being compromised then you see those things but one thing about it I didn't know I didn't know I looked at it and looked at it but all I remember when God began to deal with my life brother Iraq and still remember the moment where he opened and revealed where this message was not a message of mama and daddy but this message became my message this message became a revelation of Jesus Christ to me personally that my sin debt was paid it became right it gave me life I remember that and I'm a living reality to this moment my eyes became open he raiseth he raiseth them that are bowed down I know I'm not gonna have time to go through all these but I just want you to know this is a present God he raises up those that are falling he raised them up those that are bound with infirmity he loosens him a mattre meet he exalteth he raiseth up things that you and I could never see he raises up that we can see him hey man those who are bowed down those who who are weak he raises up boom Naha like even the man at the gate called beautiful he raised that man that man was bound and lame from his mother's womb every one of us came to length spiritually from our mother's womb we couldn't walk right couldn't talk right couldn't live and write but all it took is the passing by of the Holy Spirit hallelujah when they came by the gate called beautiful silver and gold have I none but such as I have rise up in the name of Jesus Christ where wasn't the word of authority what was it faith in the name of Jesus Christ it brought a man who had been lame he couldn't walk he was there he was gonna go and get receive something just to make do for that day he got something that is not just for one day not just for Sunday not just for Thursday but he received a real healing in his life brother that changed him forever he had been changed and he went about leaping and praising and giving glory to God I tell you in the world has come into the heart and the life of a believer brother Liberty sounds it brings real Liberty he preserveth the stranger we were strangers come on this is why God would tell Israel be good to the strangers give them food give him raiment because he said when you were strangers in Egypt I took care of you is that right we are pilgrims and strangers the Lord preserveth the stranger God God his life is manifested through his body his body though the members differ they were to have the same care one for another the Lord preserve it the stranger how has God preserved us he went before us he has sent back the Holy Ghost happy is he here Oliva 'the the fatherless and the widow you know the Bible says it's not good that man should be alone it's not good that man should be alone the word alone al o in E in the Hebrew is spelled be ad bad it's not good that man should be alone you and I though coming into this earth with father and mother alone this is why the enemy wants to isolate get off to self but here's the promise here oliva 'the how does he relieved he said i will be your father and your mother your sister and your brother i will be your all in all they that have forsaken houses and lands from me i will not only bless you in this lifetime but i will bless you in the world to come here leave us the fatherless and the widow he says where that where your fellow let me preach now he said when your when your mother or your father have forsaken you this is the word of the Lord in Psalms when father and mother have forsaken you how the Lord will take you up hey man when God comes though I had a father and a mother who were standing and filled with the Holy Ghost but they did all they could do and point me to Almighty God but I needed to have the comforter I needed to be relieved of the loneliness that was in my life I was alone I was lost and I'm done but he said I will not leave you comfortless he relieved the fatherless and the widow you might feel all alone right now listen if you've got Jesus he's living on the inside he said oh I'm with you always he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you and if you are alone you don't have to be alone it's not good that man should be alone God has made a helpmate happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help come home now God's provided a hell mate one that will help you one that will secure you one that will strengthen you he relieved us aren't you glad that he relieved us aren't you glad when you look at things and I look at things and say God I don't know how to approach this Lord I need help here Lord what do I do here Lord the Lord deal with the heart here Lord what about there all of those Saints I'm grateful that he comes and his relief is he directs us into his word and he lets us know I've got this and the same yesterday today and forever he relieves our stress he relieves our anxiety he relieves our fear he relieves I'm talking about a living God but the way of the wicked he turned us upside down this is the only part here in this scripture all this whole portion of Scripture and lets it know the wicked everything's going right remember David said I've seen him prosper like the Green Bay tree and just all my everything is so good remember a song of saifa ASF Asaph in Psalm 73 a Seth got to looking at how the world was going my goodness it looks like they got it easy my goodness it looks like there ain't nothing come their way ma they don't have it as hard as I do my all the way down Psalm 73 and you get to a spot where you recognize Asaph was still coming to the house of God that had his eyes on the world it came to a certain spot in the psalm 73 where it says I hadn't lost my footing I had slipped why he got his eyes off of the god that he should have had his eyes on but God in His mercy that's why I love Psalm 73 in better they said God restored hey Seth his vision right back brother he won no longer just playing in the church his vision had been restored he got his eyes back in line I'm so glad so glad because the way of the wicked oh it seems your good seems seem so and I'm not talking about to that of the natural remember lot looked down there and he saw the well-watered Plains of Sodom like as unto the Garden of God it looks like one it kind of looks like the Garden of God it looks like a blessing all that looks like that's such green grass my tell you how that's all laid out there man I'm telling you there wouldn't be one problem my sheep my cattle they'll have no problem gracing over there but God notice Abraham Abraham stayed in the barren land only look barren to the natural i but it wasn't barren he he what does he do he leadeth me inside the green pastures it does not mean like we looked at on Tuesday Belly green deep grass that we can sit around and get all fat in it means he's leading us step by step of the way he gives us the food that we have need of the rest of the world says what do you see in this we look at it and say maja I am receiving the nourishment of the rushing mighty wind that is proper moisture and there is my food hidden in the rocks and there I'm following my shepherd the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want the way of the wicked he turneth upside down and they just be very clear on this wickedness it's not altogether to go out into the world and sinning and everything else all those things are true that's part of wickedness but remember there's one sin and that's unbelief it's failing to accept what God has provided where a man will take a church membership or he'll take an acknowledgment of a creed well let me bring it on down he will take an acknowledgment of the message of the hour is the truth he will simply settle for that instead of ever getting what the message is really pointing to and it's really all about and that is the literal life of Jesus Christ the baptism of the holy ghost me remind you there'll be many disappointments come that day of rapture many disappointments now the bootlegger will not be disappointed the drunkard will not be disappointed the prostitute on and on they're not going to be disappointed but who's going to be disappointed is the church member those that set around it and Jesus even knows him as a friend when he came into the man who was sitting at the wedding supper he never called him stranger he said friend brother BAM tells us it shows he knew him by church acquaintance friend how did you get in here he was so close to the way but he would never submit he did not have to make the wedding garment all he had to do was receive and come God's provided way oh my I don't want to just be a friend I want to be his lover I want to be that son and daughter of God amen I want to be one that is submitted to him you don't have to be that way you don't have to be where it's turned upside down it's closed the Lord shall reign forever even thy God o Zion unto all generations praise ye the Lord I'm not going to preach on that but I will he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the same to all generations his power his nature his characteristics he's the same I'm glad that that's what the token brings it brings a confidence to know that the what the same God did in me it's the same God for my family it's the same God for every need the same God that had to come down and turn my life around that's the confidence not in me but in him he's the same to every generation praise ye the Lord
