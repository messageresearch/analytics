[31:24] thankful for the time that you have
[31:27] given to us Lord to be able to come
[31:29] together for Lord we realized that it's
[31:32] not Lord concerning us Lord so much as
[31:37] it is Lord you coming and speaking to us
[31:39] Lord regarding the purpose that you have
[31:42] for our lives Lord as we are here
[31:46] tonight or God from all walks of life
[31:50] Lord every one of us Lord having a need

[32:10] just come we want to just give ourselves
[32:12] Lord entirely into your hands tonight
[32:15] Lord and we just pray the Lord you'll
[32:18] take the Lord not only a speaker but
[32:20] here and Lord just Lord half your way in
[32:23] the midst Lord of our lives
[32:26] Oh God we just pray that you'll just
[32:28] come Lord and speak your word to a
[32:30] hearts Lord but you know what do we have
[32:32] need of tonight Lord we give ourselves
[32:35] to you now Lord in the name of Jesus
[32:38] Christ amen amen if you open up your
[32:42] Bibles there and let's turn to in the
[32:47] book of Peter there first Peter chapter
[32:49] 2 and I want to read just a few verses
[32:55] of Scripture there
[33:12] verse 13 of verse Peter to submit
[33:18] yourselves to every ordinance of man for
[33:22] the lord's sake be to the king saud that
[33:28] with well doing you may put to silence
[33:30] the ignorance of foolish men as free and
[33:34] not using your liberty for a cloak of
[33:37] maliciousness but as the servants of God
[33:39] honor all men love the Brotherhood fear
[33:45] God honor the King servants be subject
[33:49] to your masters with all fear not only
[33:52] to the good and gentle but also to the
[33:55] froward for this is think worthy if a
[33:58] man for conscience toward God endure
[34:00] grief suffering wrongfully for what
[34:03] glory is that if when you be buffeted
[34:06] for your faults you shall take it
[34:08] patiently but if when you do well and
[34:10] suffer for it you take it patiently this
[34:13] is acceptable with God
[34:16] for even hereunto were you called
[34:19] because Christ also suffered for us
[34:22] leaving us an example that you should
[34:26] follow in his footsteps who did no sin
[34:30] neither was guile found in his mouth who
[34:34] when he was reviled reviled not again
[34:37] when he suffered he threatened not but
[34:42] committed himself to him that judgeth
[34:45] righteously I want you to notice that
[34:48] that verse when he was reviled reviled
[34:53] not again so it shows that there were
[34:57] things that came against him to try to
[35:02] revile him draw him out
[35:04] stir him up but he reviled not again
[35:08] when he suffered he threatened not he
[35:14] could have really rendered some threats
[35:16] is that right he could have rendered
[35:19] threats he could have said one of these
[35:22] days you're gonna be standing right
[35:23] for me he could have done that he could
[35:26] have looked right at him and said I'll
[35:28] remember you is that right but he didn't
[35:33] threaten he didn't threaten you see he
[35:37] was Kong he came to that place in the
[35:40] midst of his suffering it was brought to
[35:42] that place but yet he threatened not how
[35:45] how can this be how can this be is this
[35:50] something that was just for the Lord
[35:52] Jesus that is not for us as believers no
[35:57] it's for us it's for us it's for us
[36:03] here's what he did here was the
[36:05] overcoming but committed himself to him
[36:11] that judgeth righteously who his own
[36:15] self bare our sins in his own body on
[36:18] the tree that we being dead to sins
[36:21] should live unto righteousness by whose
[36:25] stripes you were healed for ye were as
[36:28] sheep going astray but are now returned
[36:31] unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your
[36:34] souls
[36:35] amen may God bless you mrs. Ward as
[36:38] you're being seated I want to continue
[36:44] to look at that thought here tonight for
[36:46] a few moments on committing committing
[36:50] yourself to the Lord when we look here
[36:54] at the first part of the scriptures here
[36:57] that we've read in 1st Peter 2 even the
[37:00] very first phrase that we read from
[37:02] there is submit yourselves and to submit
[37:05] is to voluntarily give over and we know
[37:10] that that is what God has has called for
[37:14] is that even when dealing with the
[37:18] things even of this world as Peter would
[37:22] speak it there that of how that we even
[37:25] are to conduct ourselves and to conduct
[37:28] our lives that the gospel itself has not
[37:31] given to us a Liberty as though that we
[37:35] are to look down upon P
[37:37] or to even as we realize that this world
[37:40] is already it's headed to judgment
[37:44] we recognize that we recognize that even
[37:47] some of the people we don't know who but
[37:50] some of the people even that we would
[37:52] rub shoulders with on a daily basis some
[37:54] people that we come in contact with that
[37:57] they'll never turn to the Lord and yet
[37:59] we don't know what the outcome and where
[38:02] the end will be we don't know we know
[38:04] that God when he places you and I even
[38:08] in the communities that we live in and
[38:10] where we're at this is not by chance but
[38:12] God places us there that it would be not
[38:16] so much as a blessing for us with which
[38:18] which the things that God provides truly
[38:21] are a blessing from him but yet it's
[38:23] about us being a light in in this time
[38:26] this this day and in the community and
[38:29] even in the job where God has placed you
[38:32] an ayah to rest in and you know when we
[38:34] we look at this in the scripture here of
[38:37] how that the Lord Jesus himself he
[38:40] suffered very much he was he was
[38:44] persecuted he was withstood he was
[38:47] ridiculed his entire life it was always
[38:51] the mark that was laid upon his life
[38:54] things were spoke about him even
[38:56] regarding that of his birth he had to
[38:58] bear those things all of his life he
[39:00] never came into a place as far as we
[39:03] could say of reprieve to where things
[39:05] were not being said about him or against
[39:08] him or he wasn't being tried or
[39:10] persecuted but yet to think about it if
[39:13] he had got caught up in all of that we
[39:15] would still be dead in our sins tonight
[39:18] but you see God himself could not this
[39:20] could not be an act he could not strip
[39:22] everything away it could not be to wear
[39:25] that it would be every and everywhere
[39:27] that he went that he was going to be
[39:29] welcomed and everybody was gonna love
[39:31] him everybody was gonna like him that
[39:33] was something remember the Bible tells
[39:35] us very clearly that he came into the
[39:39] world and yet the world knew him not
[39:41] here he came into this place and we know
[39:44] that it was not that of the world when
[39:46] we look at cosmos that God Himself
[39:49] created but we realize that that which
[39:51] know that the the the administration and
[39:53] the government that's upon the earth
[39:55] right now that that's not of God but we
[39:58] recognize that just as there was in our
[40:00] life an administration there was
[40:03] something about our life but yet God
[40:05] Himself comes down on the inside and he
[40:07] changes that administration we are the
[40:10] same we are the same temple but yet it's
[40:13] a new creation inside of a new temple
[40:16] there's a new owner that's moved in on
[40:18] the inside and yet we look at this of
[40:21] how that you know it could have been in
[40:23] such a place that everything would have
[40:26] been so seemingly easy but yet God he
[40:30] came down and we know that the purpose
[40:33] and the reason and why all the
[40:35] persecution while the suffering it was
[40:38] Satan that was against he's always been
[40:41] against the very working and the program
[40:43] of God and let me tell you something you
[40:46] are a part of the program of Almighty
[40:49] God it don't matter what size the part
[40:51] it is to play it's just that you are a
[40:54] part of the Word of God a part of the
[40:57] program of God when the Spirit of God
[40:59] has put you into the body by that
[41:01] spiritual induction of the Holy Ghost
[41:04] and there it's God Himself moving
[41:07] through your life just as he worked
[41:09] through the life of of his son when he
[41:12] was here upon earth that same God
[41:14] working through your life and yet
[41:16] because of our identification in him we
[41:20] suffer persecution we suffer there are
[41:24] suffering that's not just persecution we
[41:27] understand that trials and yet we
[41:29] understand that when all of these things
[41:31] as it comes our way
[41:33] there were many things that as we can
[41:35] look with the Lord Jesus no doubt he was
[41:38] pulled to limits upon many things cuz
[41:40] the Bible says when he was tempted the
[41:43] Bible said he suffered and that word
[41:45] suffered means to be vexed to undergo a
[41:49] sensible experience he he knew he was
[41:52] touched this this suffering and
[41:54] everything would go to such depth in his
[41:57] emotional realm I want you to think
[41:58] about this you might look at it and say
[42:01] well you know I've had words
[42:03] said to me or this has been said to me I
[42:05] want you to think about it his whole
[42:07] life he had things said about him
[42:09] everywhere he went he had things talked
[42:11] about him he had that cloud upon his
[42:13] life that he was born his mother of a
[42:16] drunken soldier he had that about his
[42:18] life but you know what it was something
[42:20] that was down there that was greater and
[42:23] to recognize of how that he even looked
[42:26] when all of these things would come
[42:27] about in his life you see it wasn't that
[42:30] God required you and I as far as this
[42:33] body to be virgin born in order to be an
[42:36] overcomer the virgin birth was so that
[42:39] the price could be paid you with me that
[42:44] virgin body sucked that virgin body
[42:46] suffered he as brother been traumatized
[42:49] it he had a headache he experienced
[42:51] temptation he went through all those
[42:53] things that's not how he overcome by the
[42:55] virgin body he overcome by the
[42:58] indwelling of the Holy Spirit in his
[43:01] life that let him know who he was and he
[43:05] overcame by that in knowing who he was
[43:08] he's a part of the word is that right he
[43:11] is the word are you with me so it being
[43:13] that of the word then what is he doing
[43:15] he's committing himself to that of the
[43:18] word unto God that God will completely
[43:21] direct for he says I of myself can do
[43:25] nothing but he committed he committed
[43:30] himself to him that judgeth righteously
[43:33] I pray that God will help me to bring
[43:36] this as these things have been just
[43:38] moving on my heart and the things he
[43:39] even spoke to me regarding it but I look
[43:43] at this word committed and we looked at
[43:45] it last week and the very word committed
[43:48] means to give over into the hands of
[43:49] another but do you realize this same
[43:52] Greek word is the same word that's used
[43:54] in the New Testament for betrayal
[43:57] betrayal itself is where there's a
[44:00] giving into someone's hands but it's a
[44:04] giving that's by deception so we found
[44:07] that with within this of how that the
[44:10] Lord Jesus as we
[44:16] that last week and yet here in the midst
[44:19] of the time of where he's prayed he's
[44:21] asked if it's possible let this cup pass
[44:23] from me
[44:24] he himself had to had to die right there
[44:28] when we look at Calvary we see the death
[44:30] on Calvary but the death itself took
[44:32] place in the garden that's where the
[44:35] real death took place because the death
[44:38] was to the will of God that's the real
[44:41] death that Calvary was the manifestation
[44:44] of that overcoming that took place
[44:46] within the garden that's where the lamb
[44:48] prevailed in the garden is that right
[44:52] but here we find that when they they
[44:56] come to take him the Lord Jesus himself
[44:59] he arises and he gathers all of the
[45:02] disciples and I'm just going to refer
[45:04] out of Matthew 26 verse 45 where he
[45:07] refers to them that this is the hour
[45:10] that the Son of Man is betrayed into the
[45:13] hands of sinners and he spoke to them
[45:16] arise let us be going behold he is at
[45:19] hand that does betray me and while he
[45:21] yet spake lo Judas one of the twelve
[45:23] came and with the great multitude with
[45:25] swords and staves from the chief priests
[45:27] and elders of the people now he that
[45:30] betrayed him gave them a sign now what
[45:34] you think about this Judas betrayed him
[45:39] is that right
[45:42] but even what's this now look how the
[45:45] Lord Jesus even prior to coming to all
[45:49] of these stages he knew as he said one
[45:53] of you is a devil is that right now let
[45:57] me ask you a question did Jesus act any
[46:00] different towards Judas than he did to
[46:02] the rest of them was there any way that
[46:05] they could have picked it out and said I
[46:07] know it's Judas you see it you see how
[46:09] Jesus looks at him you see I treat see
[46:11] you see there wasn't anything like that
[46:15] you see it shows what it means when we
[46:19] can stand in position of the word and
[46:22] rest in God not rest in ourselves
[46:27] he said what do you mean by resting in
[46:29] yourselves I'm talking about resting in
[46:30] our emotions our emotions our feelings
[46:33] always got to be checked you with me I
[46:37] feel to say this check I think this
[46:40] check it's not rest in my emotions God
[46:44] speaks to me but every time the voice
[46:46] even though it sounds the same way it's
[46:48] not always God are you with me it's
[46:51] check it sometimes the checking of it is
[46:54] not so much what's being said but check
[46:57] it of it of how is it affecting me in my
[46:59] spirit is it is it rising in my spirit
[47:04] is it causing those sandals right
[47:06] there's a check God ain't gonna do that
[47:08] are you with me
[47:09] so it's checking every one every spirit
[47:13] the Bible said beloved try every spirit
[47:17] see whether it be of God or not so here
[47:20] here comes Judas and he betrayed him he
[47:24] that betrayed him gave him aside and
[47:26] said whosoever I shall kiss the same as
[47:29] he hold him fast for with he came to
[47:32] Jesus and said he'll master and kissed
[47:34] him and Jesus said unto him you deceiver
[47:37] you betrayer I knew you all along come
[47:42] on somebody how did Jesus approach this
[47:48] home brother Sam you know that's Jesus
[47:50] but if Jesus is inside of you then you
[47:54] and I have the authority to be able to
[47:57] approach it with in this manner even
[48:00] when Satan would get up on my brother
[48:03] and my sister but yet to be able to
[48:05] stand there and say my brother my friend
[48:08] come on somebody
[48:11] man illusion but notice he came in he
[48:16] Jesus didn't draw back he's a friend
[48:19] wherefore art thou come then came they
[48:22] and laid hands on Jesus and took him and
[48:24] the whole one of them which was with
[48:26] Jesus stretched out his hand
[48:31] drew his sword and struck a servant of
[48:35] the high priest and smote off his ear
[48:37] this was alliance these are alliances
[48:43] you're picking on Jesus
[48:54] you
[50:54] the Prophet would speak to us there in
[50:56] the church age book regarding our tests
[50:58] our trials that comes our way
[51:00] of how that were to conduct ourselves
[51:02] with joy
[51:03] amidst the trials those things that he
[51:06] in His infinite wisdom permits to come
[51:08] our way how do we conduct ourselves in
[51:11] the right way how do we conduct
[51:13] ourselves in joy by committing ourselves
[51:16] unto him who judges righteously but say
[51:24] me are you saying that I can't judge
[51:25] righteously sometimes our emotion cast
[51:28] judgment sometimes our feelings render
[51:32] judgment come on somebody why do you
[51:34] think they called in jurors and they
[51:36] asked jurors have you heard anything
[51:38] about this case they wanted me to serve
[51:40] jury duty here not too long ago in the
[51:42] city Lorie I said I'm a pastor I'm you
[51:47] know these people I might be pastoring
[51:49] them some day I'm not gonna serve on
[51:53] that but I have an exemption that I'm
[51:55] able to do that as a pastor where there
[51:57] they'll permit that but you know they
[51:59] asked a journey to Jerry but people to
[52:01] come in there and they asked you do you
[52:02] know anything about this trial do you
[52:04] know anything about this yeah I don't
[52:05] know how people don't know anything
[52:06] about these trials they go in and set on
[52:08] I mean everything's blasted in your face
[52:10] I don't know how they don't know I
[52:13] really don't sometimes you almost wonder
[52:15] is it a gimmick you know but to think
[52:18] about this why because we and our
[52:21] emotions this is what the Lord Jesus is
[52:24] even instructing us Ruby / Peter that in
[52:27] our emotions we could judge so
[52:29] unrighteous ly that's why we need to
[52:32] commit it to him because you never know
[52:35] you never know that person who's come
[52:38] against you might might be you data lead
[52:41] them to the Lord
[52:42] so you either leave a door open or you
[52:44] close the door woo glory be to God this
[52:49] is where the Lord Jesus here in
[52:52] directing us as Paul would look at this
[52:54] in Philippians chapter 1 verse 29 and he
[52:57] says for unto you it is given in the
[52:59] behalf of Christ not only to believe on
[53:02] him but also to suffer for his sake
[53:05] having the same conflict which you
[53:08] selling me and now here to be in me Paul
[53:11] we realize Paul suffered many many
[53:14] things and there was many things as Paul
[53:16] would write about this conflict the same
[53:18] that you've saw because everywhere that
[53:20] Paul went there was conflict but it was
[53:25] not conflict that was signature Paul you
[53:29] say what do you mean by that
[53:30] it wasn't Paul acting outside of the
[53:34] leading of the Lord and then turning and
[53:36] saying I'm being persecuted no with me
[53:42] who's sowing seed tonight way following
[53:46] this was not anything we're paul paul we
[53:48] know being late what great things you
[53:51] must suffer for my name's sake i'm gonna
[53:54] show this to you and how that paul when
[53:57] he dealt with this in acts 14 nineteen
[54:00] just one example but i want to hone in
[54:01] on this one there came thither certain
[54:04] jews from Antioch and Iconium now
[54:06] they've been run out of Antioch they've
[54:10] been run out of Iconium is that right
[54:13] who persuaded the people and having
[54:15] stoned Paul drew him out of the city
[54:18] supposing he had been dead howbeit as
[54:22] the disciples stood round about him he
[54:25] rose up and came into the city
[54:28] now let's you watch this you can read
[54:33] this just verses on back to where when
[54:35] they were put out in Antioch when they
[54:38] were put out they shut they shook the
[54:41] dust off their shoes and they departed
[54:44] and they gave glory to God having joy in
[54:48] the Holy Ghost not joy in the
[54:52] circumstances joy in the Holy Ghost so
[54:59] they leave but now in this time how God
[55:04] would direct Paul Paul didn't get up and
[55:06] leave that city he got up after being
[55:09] stoned and walks back into the city this
[55:14] is not an act
[55:15] God is displaying to the believers that
[55:19] live there
[55:20] of the standing in the midst of the
[55:23] times of things that would come about
[55:25] your life God will grant you grace when
[55:28] you feel like you can't go no more when
[55:31] you're left for dead God will raise you
[55:33] right back in place Alleluia
[55:38] because there's other times that we can
[55:40] read about in the scripture where Paul
[55:41] will move right out of the city and the
[55:44] Bible says that how that the next day
[55:46] they departed with Barnabas to Derby and
[55:48] when they had preached the gospel to
[55:49] that city and it taught many they
[55:52] returned again to Lystra and Iconium and
[55:55] Antioch they went back to those places
[55:59] what to do what confirming the souls of
[56:03] the disciples and exhorting them to
[56:06] continue in the faith and that we must
[56:09] through much tribulation enter into the
[56:13] kingdom of God they exhorted them within
[56:17] their life and within their walk and I
[56:20] look at how that the Lord Jesus he laid
[56:22] this out in John 16:33 these things have
[56:26] I spoken unto you that in me in me you
[56:29] might have peace in the world
[56:32] you shall have tribulation but be of
[56:36] good cheer I have overcome the world and
[56:42] you know you would think these words
[56:44] would frighten you frighten people away
[56:48] but to the believer the Lord Jesus knows
[56:53] that it's a greater power it's not the
[56:56] reasoning and intellect of men but it's
[56:59] the very power of God his presence his
[57:02] spirit that would woo his children unto
[57:05] himself in a love affair to where he
[57:08] himself steps on the inside and when you
[57:11] know what when you fall in love with
[57:13] somebody you don't care about all of
[57:16] these other things even out brother
[57:17] Branham brought it with that young man
[57:19] and that young lady murdered brother BAM
[57:21] talked about how she coming up here and
[57:23] she didn't even have shoes on her feet
[57:24] brother Graham said she had that gingham
[57:26] dress and she had you know these things
[57:28] that where they didn't have nothing but
[57:30] yet what was it if they fell in love
[57:33] with one another and that's what the
[57:35] Lord Jesus himself would look at it
[57:38] friends it's not that all of a sudden we
[57:40] get filled with the Holy Ghost and fall
[57:41] in love with God the Holy Ghost won't
[57:43] come unless you are in love with him are
[57:46] you with me
[57:47] jesus said if you love me keep my
[57:50] Commandments and we will come and make
[57:53] our abode in thee
[57:56] you gotta allows him you gotta love him
[57:59] and seek after him and then he comes and
[58:02] this this is where that with that love
[58:05] affair of that love dwelling within the
[58:08] heart no wonder Paul could just echo out
[58:11] by the Spirit of God that who shall
[58:13] separate us he's not even looking at all
[58:19] the things that could come but it is the
[58:22] power of Christ residing within his
[58:25] heart by a love affair the Lord Jesus
[58:32] told him in Matthew 10 he told him there
[58:37] and I didn't include some of these here
[58:39] but I have them I if you want to return
[58:40] them in your Bible you can but he told
[58:43] him I'm gonna send you out I'm sending
[58:45] you out his sheep among wolves be you
[58:55] therefore wise as serpents and harmless
[59:00] as doves and once you think of this be
[59:04] wise as serpents and harmless as doves
[59:10] knowing that there's going to be
[59:12] situations of which he mentions that
[59:16] you're going to be delivered unto
[59:19] counsels now once you think of this
[59:22] delivered unto counsels they're gonna
[59:26] scourge you in their synagogues you're
[59:31] going to be brought before governors and
[59:32] Kings for a testimony against them in
[59:35] the Gentiles but when they deliver you
[59:37] up this is where he says now when they
[59:39] deliver you up take no thought how or
[59:46] what ye shall speak for it shall be
[59:52] given you in that same hour
[59:54] what shall what you shall speak in
[59:58] another part of the gospel and mark it
[1:00:00] says do not premeditate I'm gonna say
[1:00:05] this I should I say this I should have
[1:00:06] say that the wiser the serpent harmless
[1:00:11] as a dove there are many many encounters
[1:00:16] that you read in the scriptures and
[1:00:19] maybe I just referred to a fume here
[1:00:21] that when you look at in the book of
[1:00:24] Acts you see that there were many
[1:00:28] encounters that even Paul would come
[1:00:31] into and Paul himself never used the
[1:00:35] same approach each time that's the same
[1:00:40] way when they came into the land of
[1:00:41] Canaan it was not the same pro chawl the
[1:00:43] time but yet he was God first it was God
[1:00:47] first sometimes where Paul would would
[1:00:51] come into a situation you have in the
[1:00:54] Acts chapter 23 where Paul stands there
[1:00:57] and he looks he's brought in remember
[1:01:00] right here into question before the
[1:01:03] Pharisees and Sadducees and the Bible
[1:01:06] says that Paul perceived that over a
[1:01:11] great majority was Pharisee so what Paul
[1:01:15] said is I believe in the resurrection
[1:01:19] and what happened he divided that
[1:01:22] assembly just like that I believe in
[1:01:26] angels he began to do that you see he
[1:01:29] didn't come right out and say you every
[1:01:31] one of you are wrong what was that the
[1:01:35] same Holy Ghost that led him in that
[1:01:39] moment be how could that happen
[1:01:41] because Paul had committed himself unto
[1:01:44] God you think Paul wasn't tempted to
[1:01:47] blast him you think Paul wasn't tempted
[1:01:50] he was tempted me tell you something
[1:01:54] even when the Prophet stood there in the
[1:01:56] brand in the land the Lord told
[1:01:59] there's gonna be a test before you and
[1:02:01] remember when that young couple was
[1:02:03] making out in the service that was the
[1:02:05] test God didn't tell him what the test
[1:02:06] was going to be but notice where was the
[1:02:09] test he was tested even in that of his
[1:02:11] emotions but he said I stopped at I
[1:02:15] forgive you don't do that no more oh ma
[1:02:20] handling a situation lecture like a son
[1:02:23] of God taking control of that situation
[1:02:26] he didn't come down and you know just
[1:02:27] just lay down the law upon him and and
[1:02:30] just take the whole rest of the surface
[1:02:31] and say I feel that of the Lord I'm
[1:02:33] gonna change my sticks and I'm gonna
[1:02:35] speak on fornicators and you see what
[1:02:40] was it he was not reserved to William
[1:02:42] Branham but brother Branham was reserved
[1:02:45] to the Lord are you with me brother
[1:02:48] Branham was not reserved to William
[1:02:50] Branham brother Branham was reserved to
[1:02:52] the Lord William Branham in his emotions
[1:02:57] was there oh my you think of how that
[1:02:59] the enemy know that man was just given
[1:03:01] him all the scriptures and things that
[1:03:04] could be said in that moment look how
[1:03:10] the situation was handled see God knew
[1:03:13] God the test itself God knows even the
[1:03:16] test friends listen to me even the test
[1:03:19] and these things that God permits to
[1:03:20] come our way it's all part of our
[1:03:23] molding but it's all part of it that how
[1:03:26] in ourselves will we commit ourselves to
[1:03:30] him because in these things which the
[1:03:34] prophet in victory day millirem tells us
[1:03:36] he said if you could just look through
[1:03:38] God's looking glass
[1:03:40] he said these little trials these little
[1:03:45] disappointments and he uses that term
[1:03:47] little disappointments he said if you
[1:03:50] could just focus away and look at it
[1:03:53] it's God only bringing you to places
[1:03:56] that you might have a victory day in
[1:03:59] your life because in Christ it is
[1:04:03] victory after victory there's one
[1:04:05] victory and then because of that victory
[1:04:08] then we have that that that way
[1:04:10] that's made that we can have victory in
[1:04:13] trials and it makes way for that great
[1:04:17] Victory Day that's coming because these
[1:04:20] victories are only temporary is that
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:29] enjoy him enjoy the victory because
[1:04:33] tomorrow you might be on the battlefield
[1:04:34] again right I thought when I was playing
[1:04:42] football you know our coach would tell
[1:04:44] us enjoy this win tonight but he said
[1:04:47] you'd be here tomorrow morning at 7:30
[1:04:48] ready to run sprints watch films
[1:04:54] couldn't hard to get the sleep out of my
[1:04:56] eyes sometimes on those Saturday
[1:04:57] mornings and you're sitting there trying
[1:04:59] to watch film and everything but you
[1:05:01] know what it was it was we're gonna look
[1:05:02] at what you did
[1:05:03] right and what you did wrong we're gonna
[1:05:06] have everything graded for you but then
[1:05:08] we're gonna start prepping you for the
[1:05:09] next opponent then you got to go the
[1:05:14] whole weekend thinking about this guy
[1:05:16] you got a face can you enjoy steak
[1:05:20] knowing you got to face somebody like
[1:05:21] that you're loving tonight any good so
[1:05:28] good but it said take not take no
[1:05:32] thought what you're gonna say but it's
[1:05:33] the spirit of your father that speakers
[1:05:35] in you and he goes on and lets them know
[1:05:38] of how that even brother is gonna
[1:05:41] deliver up brother
[1:05:43] he lets him know that there's going to
[1:05:46] be the father will DIF deliver up the
[1:05:48] child and how a child will raise up
[1:05:51] against the parents and cause them to be
[1:05:52] put to death
[1:05:53] I tell you betrayal is a terrible thing
[1:05:55] but betrayal inside of family didn't
[1:06:02] Lord Jesus see he knew this betrayal of
[1:06:04] things betrayal things that can come
[1:06:06] around and even betrayal within the
[1:06:09] family of God betrayal is a hard thing
[1:06:12] i'ma tell you something right now our
[1:06:15] spirits are not made to handle betrayal
[1:06:17] we're not we are not built emotionally
[1:06:21] to handle betrayal
[1:06:24] listen our human spirit everything about
[1:06:28] us does not like betrayal this is where
[1:06:33] that from the midst of it that in the
[1:06:36] midst of betrayal is to look to God I
[1:06:40] mean you know you've been in a workplace
[1:06:42] sometimes and there's things that
[1:06:44] sometimes you realize you don't go
[1:06:47] talking to everybody
[1:06:48] oh I feel so at home got around you you
[1:06:53] better be careful who you feel at home
[1:06:54] around Jesus told him in this verse I'm
[1:06:59] reading you beware of men he wasn't
[1:07:02] telling them to walk around in fear but
[1:07:04] you know what there's some times where
[1:07:07] there's things you might feel like
[1:07:08] saying but maybe you just better keep it
[1:07:11] because there could be somebody that all
[1:07:14] of a sudden Satan can anoint their
[1:07:16] memory or anoint their tongue and then
[1:07:18] what happens is there's things that just
[1:07:20] get centered right on you man oh man Wow
[1:07:27] just following you sir betrayal you
[1:07:33] think what in the world what in the
[1:07:36] world he said you'll be hated of men for
[1:07:41] my sake my betrayal is such as such a
[1:07:50] great thing in our lives every one of us
[1:07:54] if you haven't you will experience it
[1:08:02] but betrayal itself is one of those
[1:08:05] things that here the Lord Jesus this was
[1:08:08] the greatest betrayal of all times but
[1:08:12] look what he did in the midst of this
[1:08:14] time and I believe that we and ourselves
[1:08:17] can grow from this he committed himself
[1:08:20] to him who judges righteously
[1:08:26] blue bream says it like this in
[1:08:28] Ephesians he says I know thy works and
[1:08:33] thy labour that patience as he walks in
[1:08:35] the midst of his church he's aware of
[1:08:37] the suffering of his people and he cares
[1:08:39] as it was in the days of captivity in
[1:08:42] Egypt when he heard their cries he who
[1:08:44] never changes still hears the cries of
[1:08:47] the oppressed as he walks amongst them
[1:08:50] the very word laborer signifies a
[1:08:52] weariness through oppression God's
[1:08:56] people do not only work for him in a
[1:08:59] labor of love but they suffer for him
[1:09:02] with joy they are patient in bearing the
[1:09:06] yoke that first aid suffered great
[1:09:09] persecution it had to work hard to
[1:09:12] preach the gospel and shed for truth
[1:09:18] their enemy it wasn't that their they
[1:09:21] didn't have a spiritual enemy but their
[1:09:23] enemy was a very much so a natural enemy
[1:09:30] they were not they were not gathering in
[1:09:33] places like you and I are able just to
[1:09:36] freely drive in here and have a sign out
[1:09:38] here they didn't have all of the of
[1:09:45] conveniences or the ease but yet they
[1:09:49] preach the gospel because there was a
[1:09:53] motivating power in their life of that
[1:09:58] divine love that press them through even
[1:10:01] the hardest times and it gave them
[1:10:04] strength and encouragement through the
[1:10:07] hardest of times the Cobra Graham says
[1:10:12] this he said their high calling in life
[1:10:14] was to serve God is that your high
[1:10:17] calling is to serve God not how I want
[1:10:21] to I want to become this Sunday I want
[1:10:23] to become that Sunday but the high
[1:10:26] calling is to serve God if God sees fit
[1:10:30] that this is to be then he'll open the
[1:10:32] door but my first priority the high
[1:10:36] calling is to serve God
[1:10:39] that's first now notice he says and when
[1:10:42] their hopes in life were blighted that
[1:10:48] means just like taking away their hopes
[1:10:50] and life were blighted they were patient
[1:10:54] and committed all to him who had
[1:10:58] promised a lasting recompense in heaven
[1:11:01] for what they had given up for him on
[1:11:03] earth what would the whole the whole
[1:11:05] summation of this is is that when things
[1:11:08] came about the hopes that they had
[1:11:11] within life know there's things that you
[1:11:13] still have to do on a day-to-day basis
[1:11:15] you still have to go to work you're
[1:11:18] still got to pay your bills and let me
[1:11:19] tell you something you have to live as
[1:11:22] though he could come the next moment but
[1:11:23] you have to also move within this moment
[1:11:27] as though that you yourself that God
[1:11:30] would continue on so that even means in
[1:11:32] the raising of our children that means
[1:11:34] in everything that we do do it heartily
[1:11:37] as unto the Lord giving our all every
[1:11:40] moment until he himself takes us away
[1:11:43] and sometimes as it says here their
[1:11:49] hopes were blinded I wonder I wonder how
[1:11:57] many meetings that James had scheduled
[1:12:00] to preach when he was taken home to the
[1:12:05] natural mind that would not have looked
[1:12:07] like this is what needs to be James was
[1:12:10] a leader of the church in Jerusalem and
[1:12:14] everything seemed to be so blinded but
[1:12:16] you see God knows everything and all
[1:12:20] that he's doing his work is not going to
[1:12:22] recede but it's only going to increase
[1:12:24] and the increase comes from the heart
[1:12:28] and from the life from the effectual
[1:12:30] working of the Holy Spirit that in it
[1:12:33] all when there's things that you can't
[1:12:35] understand I can't understand don't tell
[1:12:40] me you understand why there's some
[1:12:41] people that were taken home at the age
[1:12:43] of 17 some are taken home to glory at
[1:12:46] the age of 10 and some are taking home
[1:12:48] what by the assignment you don't
[1:12:49] understand I don't understand
[1:12:52] when you're looking to look at a man
[1:12:54] that even here 55 years old or whatever
[1:12:57] more and taken home a man preaching the
[1:13:01] gospel as an evangelist who a man that
[1:13:03] as a young man here he is swimming and
[1:13:05] is taken away in a curtain a current you
[1:13:07] don't understand that but God knows he
[1:13:15] knows and you say well if I don't
[1:13:18] understand how it's not a battle
[1:13:20] understand it comes down to the place of
[1:13:22] say the Lord it my spirit of all tore up
[1:13:25] Lord
[1:13:26] I don't understand what's taking place
[1:13:28] but Lord you're in control
[1:13:33] you're in control Lord that starts even
[1:13:40] the process of committing it starts the
[1:13:47] healing it starts to dissolving this is
[1:13:54] not just in death I'm talking about I'm
[1:13:55] talking about in trials brother Brent
[1:13:57] says I think we ought to stop here and
[1:13:59] deal with the thought that God's people
[1:14:01] have always been and always will be
[1:14:03] persecuted he goes into of the parallel
[1:14:09] between Cain and Abel and Ishmael and
[1:14:12] Isaac and Esau and Jacob but then
[1:14:17] brother Branham makes a statement in the
[1:14:19] New Testament
[1:14:20] a few paragraph 1 down we find Judas
[1:14:23] betraying betraying Jesus while the
[1:14:26] religious orders of the first century
[1:14:28] attempted to destroy the early believers
[1:14:30] the children of this world controlled by
[1:14:33] the devil hate the children of God who
[1:14:35] are controlled by the spirit it's Satan
[1:14:43] flatting against God Satan anoints flesh
[1:14:49] to come against flesh that is veiling
[1:14:52] God but that's why you can stand and
[1:14:56] recognize this warfare is not a flesh
[1:15:00] and blood affair is
[1:15:04] a flesh-and-blood affair it's Satan see
[1:15:08] this is where the Prophet would even
[1:15:09] bring it and speak to us these things
[1:15:13] you see these things are spoken in the
[1:15:14] message these things are spoken in the
[1:15:16] scripture but then we must apply them
[1:15:18] and there's going to be situations that
[1:15:20] arise that we have to apply them whereas
[1:15:22] the Prophet told us you must recognize
[1:15:24] he said that it's not your brother doing
[1:15:27] that it's Satan or your sister and he
[1:15:34] goes on and remember how the Prophet
[1:15:38] brings us to this and this is where I'm
[1:15:42] working in to this place here it
[1:15:44] determines the attitude that we take
[1:15:48] towards it
[1:15:53] even if somebody's done wrong
[1:15:55] my attitude matters my attitude matters
[1:15:59] persecutions come my way
[1:16:01] my attitude matters my attitude matters
[1:16:05] what I say Matt it matters now let's
[1:16:09] just look at this here rearend goes on
[1:16:12] to say no matter how just an upright a
[1:16:14] Christian is before the public how
[1:16:16] gracious he is to his fellow man doing
[1:16:18] not but good let him confess Christ as
[1:16:21] his Savior and acknowledge the operation
[1:16:24] of the gifts of the Holy Spirit in
[1:16:25] tongues prophecy healing and miracles
[1:16:27] and he will be condemned in other words
[1:16:32] to declare Jesus Christ is come in the
[1:16:36] flesh you will be condemned it looked at
[1:16:41] as a oddball you see many of the
[1:16:44] religious world they look back on what
[1:16:46] was done for them but they fail to
[1:16:49] recognize that was done that you and I
[1:16:53] might be brought back to God in a union
[1:16:57] to where that same God that lived in
[1:17:00] that body desires to live inside of that
[1:17:05] body of his redeemed subjects that he
[1:17:09] has brought to himself as what he said
[1:17:13] the spirit of this world hates the
[1:17:16] Spirit of God
[1:17:17] and because it can't overcome the spirit
[1:17:21] of God
[1:17:22] it tries to destroy the vessel in whom
[1:17:29] the spirit of truth dwells it cannot
[1:17:32] overcome the Holy Ghost in you so it
[1:17:36] tries to destroy you it comes he comes
[1:17:41] against your flesh in your spirit yes
[1:17:47] sir
[1:17:48] these parts where it's vexed listen
[1:17:55] every one of us have said things wrong
[1:18:02] every one of us every one of us have
[1:18:05] been in times where we responded in a
[1:18:08] way that we should not have responded
[1:18:10] but do you see the convicting power of
[1:18:13] the Holy Ghost within your heart that
[1:18:16] even draws you to it brings you to that
[1:18:19] place and you are so smitten in your
[1:18:21] heart to say Lord forgive me I shouldn't
[1:18:24] have said that about this I shouldn't
[1:18:26] have done what is it it is the dwelling
[1:18:29] of the keeper of Almighty God within
[1:18:33] what's he doing he's moving upon the
[1:18:36] gates there's a gate that had gotten
[1:18:40] loose come on gate our gates in our
[1:18:45] spirit you can't overcome the Spirit of
[1:18:50] Truth so he tries to tear down and
[1:18:51] destroy the vessel that's what Satan
[1:18:55] tries to do and as far as within any of
[1:18:59] our lives we're all full of mistakes but
[1:19:03] the brim stands on the message he that
[1:19:05] is in you he said don't you lose your
[1:19:07] confidence in me he said as far as
[1:19:09] mistakes I'm full of them
[1:19:11] and that's truth every prophet was there
[1:19:16] right but yet the reality of it is it's
[1:19:19] the revelation there is no fault in the
[1:19:22] revelation who is Christ
[1:19:27] right there's no folding there that
[1:19:29] revelation is perfect they sought to
[1:19:35] kill the Lord Jesus think about Lazarus
[1:19:38] here lastest has been raised from the
[1:19:40] grave
[1:19:40] you know the very next chapter the Bible
[1:19:42] said many of them came to see Lazarus
[1:19:44] here was Jesus setting there but it was
[1:19:47] what happened to Lazarus that drew many
[1:19:51] to come and want to see what had
[1:19:53] happened this man that had been raised
[1:19:54] from the dead but there was chief priest
[1:19:56] who came also and said let's kill him
[1:19:58] because you know why he's turning many
[1:20:00] people from us to Jesus well as it
[1:20:04] wanted to destroy the vessel why because
[1:20:06] the vessel was a testimony of the glory
[1:20:10] of God multiple times they sought to
[1:20:16] kill Paul multiple times and in every
[1:20:24] one of these times that they sought to
[1:20:25] come at Paul God made a way don't live
[1:20:32] in fear about things that your job or
[1:20:34] this or that let me tell you something
[1:20:36] if you're looking to the Lord you got
[1:20:38] God on your side the Bible said the Lord
[1:20:42] is my helper I will not fear what man
[1:20:44] can do unto me it's looking to God let
[1:20:48] me tell you something I don't care how
[1:20:50] powerful the union is I don't care how
[1:20:52] much this is there's nothing more
[1:20:54] powerful than a man who's in position
[1:20:58] with God nothing is more powerful than a
[1:21:02] man or a woman who's in position with
[1:21:05] Almighty God nothing can overthrow that
[1:21:08] because God's got you there for a
[1:21:10] purpose God will let you know what you
[1:21:17] need to do persecutions and trials let
[1:21:19] me get to this my lord
[1:21:21] persecutions and trials are a natural
[1:21:24] and normal part of the Christian life
[1:21:25] there is only one thing you can do about
[1:21:28] them commit them all to God
[1:21:35] now committal is not a give up you
[1:21:41] understand
[1:21:41] committal is not just saying can't do
[1:21:45] nothing about that's not committal
[1:21:46] committal is by Authority putting it
[1:21:50] into the hands of one who has greater
[1:21:51] authority you you if you give up if
[1:21:55] they're what is that needs to be
[1:21:57] committed it's just laying there but
[1:22:00] your committal shows faith in Him
[1:22:03] who's able to do something about it
[1:22:10] commit them all to God the persecutions
[1:22:14] in trials look at this part judge not to
[1:22:21] help me Lord and leave they're out
[1:22:29] working and final judgment to him leave
[1:22:37] it to him I want to read this scripture
[1:22:43] with you in Psalms 37 look at this
[1:22:50] direction that David gives us here as
[1:22:55] we're coming down here and verse 1 he
[1:23:00] said fret not thyself because of
[1:23:03] evildoers
[1:23:05] you know what fret means to boil up in
[1:23:07] anger jealousy fret not thyself because
[1:23:14] of evildoers neither be thou envious
[1:23:18] against the workers of iniquity how many
[1:23:23] remember Psalm 73 the psalm of Asaph if
[1:23:25] you haven't read that you read back over
[1:23:27] it
[1:23:27] Asaph was a chief musician in David's
[1:23:31] army David so ASEP kept coming to church
[1:23:35] Asaph kept playing but a Seth got to
[1:23:38] looking at the wicked
[1:23:42] nothing goes wrong with them they
[1:23:44] prosper they're going up it sounds like
[1:23:48] one of our songs up up but I can't say
[1:23:50] up up up to be with Jesus but it looks
[1:23:52] like they're going up up Asaph got to
[1:23:58] looking so much at that to a saps own
[1:24:02] testimony in Psalms 23 said my foot had
[1:24:06] almost slipped I almost lost my footing
[1:24:12] because I got to looking at that you see
[1:24:16] it isn't envy that oh ha I wish I could
[1:24:18] be out in the world this is so hard
[1:24:20] no it's like ah it seemed like here in
[1:24:24] the workplace or whatever more everybody
[1:24:26] loves them and it seems like it's envy
[1:24:31] Envy what it's envy to me I want to be I
[1:24:36] want to be loved and lacked like all of
[1:24:39] them now you can take the attitude and
[1:24:43] say it don't matter I am a Christian
[1:24:47] don't you lose your Liberty for a cloak
[1:24:49] of maliciousness I'm a Christian I don't
[1:24:53] need that no we all need one another we
[1:24:57] all need love woo glory be to God for
[1:25:05] they listen listen for they shall soon
[1:25:09] be cut down like the grass and wither as
[1:25:13] the green herb but look at this
[1:25:16] direction that's given in verse 3 trust
[1:25:19] in the Lord and do good so true trusting
[1:25:27] in the Lord that's in word right but the
[1:25:31] N word trust reflects in doing good is
[1:25:37] that right so shalt thou dwell in the
[1:25:41] land and verily thou shalt be fed
[1:25:45] delight thyself also in the Lord and he
[1:25:49] shall give thee the desires of thine
[1:25:52] heart I'd say probably everyone is can
[1:25:53] quote that scripture
[1:25:55] but notice this delight myself this is
[1:25:59] an action that you called to delight
[1:26:03] thyself in the Lord and the desires that
[1:26:09] are in your heart you give them to you
[1:26:11] because if you're delighting yourself in
[1:26:13] the Lord if there's anything that's out
[1:26:15] of cater the Lord will dissolve that
[1:26:18] you'll bring it to light you'll repent
[1:26:20] of it and get that desire out come on
[1:26:23] somebody because you cannot delight in
[1:26:26] the Lord with enmity against somebody
[1:26:29] but if you're delighting in the Lord
[1:26:31] you're there in the cleansing flow and
[1:26:34] what happens there's a cleansing that's
[1:26:35] going on he'll point out listen when
[1:26:38] we're reading in the work we're
[1:26:39] listening to the message we're in prayer
[1:26:41] the Holy Spirit convicts not just in the
[1:26:44] house of God he'll bring things to our
[1:26:48] attention in our lives if we're
[1:26:50] delighting ourselves in him then those
[1:26:54] desires that are righteous that are
[1:26:56] godly those desires of thine heart he
[1:26:59] you'll bring them forth verse five
[1:27:03] commit thy way unto the Lord that
[1:27:10] journey commit it to him if you keep
[1:27:18] talking about it you ain't committed it
[1:27:23] you keep talking about it you ain't
[1:27:25] committed it you keep hashing it you
[1:27:28] ain't committed it but to commit it is
[1:27:33] where as a prophetess say like this he
[1:27:35] said when the doctors have said they can
[1:27:37] do no more for you he said look to God
[1:27:42] and His Word and know that he is a
[1:27:44] healer he said and take that word and
[1:27:47] say Lord I commit myself to you and he
[1:27:49] says and then act like you're healed now
[1:27:57] I don't believe you understand I don't
[1:27:59] believe this is just things we just say
[1:28:00] out but when it comes that place where
[1:28:03] we can look at that in the word and say
[1:28:04] Lord there's a power
[1:28:06] comital help me to rise even to that
[1:28:08] place to where I can commit this to you
[1:28:13] Lord God to where I'm not I'm not gonna
[1:28:16] try to judge it out solve it out and
[1:28:18] I've got everything to sign I don't know
[1:28:21] you do and I'm not gonna let my life be
[1:28:26] robbed with worried I'm gonna delight
[1:28:30] myself in you because you're the real
[1:28:33] joy of my life you're the real delight
[1:28:37] of my life you're what makes my world as
[1:28:39] it were go round how many times mother
[1:28:43] and said I love to hunt I love to fish I
[1:28:45] love those trans back there he said but
[1:28:47] I would never trade anything for this
[1:28:50] time in his presence in his presence
[1:28:57] what about this women commit it to the
[1:29:00] Lord Trust also in him and he shall
[1:29:08] bring it to pass and he shall bring
[1:29:10] forth look at this thy righteousness as
[1:29:14] the light and that judgment as the
[1:29:19] noonday can I have just a few more
[1:29:26] moments I'm gonna just skip over some
[1:29:32] verses and I want to I read this to you
[1:29:36] last week out a life story and I want to
[1:29:38] read this here brother bream says if
[1:29:42] someone talks about you and you talk
[1:29:44] back about them
[1:29:45] God can't fight your battle you're
[1:29:48] fighting it yourself now brother Branham
[1:29:50] over and over even and throughout the
[1:29:52] message brother Branham he deals with
[1:29:54] this and he'll say this phrase many
[1:29:56] times even when there were situations
[1:29:58] that people were taking tapes and
[1:29:59] splicing them and brother Brown says
[1:30:02] they're making me say things that I
[1:30:03] didn't say still do it today
[1:30:06] they splice quotes together they'll
[1:30:09] quote what they want a quote out of it
[1:30:10] and when they get done with it it don't
[1:30:13] look anything like the image of Jesus
[1:30:15] Christ it looks like a mongrel
[1:30:18] you asked me the same you oughta not say
[1:30:21] that or no I ought to say that but you
[1:30:24] see what he did brother branham himself
[1:30:26] noticed this he said in the message I
[1:30:28] believe it's recognizing your day in its
[1:30:30] message brother Brown said what he did
[1:30:31] he says look he said I I gave that over
[1:30:35] to God he said as long as I'm fighting
[1:30:38] it
[1:30:38] God can't fight it now it didn't mean
[1:30:43] that he didn't stand against it but
[1:30:45] brother Brown was not gonna waste his
[1:30:47] time trying to track them guys down you
[1:30:49] understand me there's things that we can
[1:30:52] do them just be an absolute waste of
[1:30:54] time I don't know how many times I've
[1:30:59] told you you ain't going to convince
[1:31:01] these people on their blog posts and
[1:31:02] everything else why read the trash well
[1:31:06] I'll read it well I'm gonna win them
[1:31:09] back to the Lord
[1:31:10] be careful who's winning who why would
[1:31:14] you study that and give yourself to that
[1:31:16] when God has given to us the riches of
[1:31:19] his glory
[1:31:21] there's no vindication no light nothing
[1:31:25] that will ever come from reading those
[1:31:26] things but if you can get before God and
[1:31:29] say God I know this word is right I know
[1:31:32] it's true will you reveal yourself to me
[1:31:34] Lord then you'll have a stability even
[1:31:39] of the things that you cannot explain
[1:31:42] and it wouldn't matter how many
[1:31:45] contradictions you find come on somebody
[1:31:54] you don't matter
[1:31:57] he doesn't matter and it isn't that it
[1:32:01] doesn't matter because we make
[1:32:02] everything they'll say if the Lord
[1:32:03] we don't make everything they'll say if
[1:32:05] the Lord God never made everything thus
[1:32:07] saith the Lord are you with me
[1:32:09] brother branham himself he says so much
[1:32:12] of this is my own opinion come on
[1:32:14] somebody he said don't do that
[1:32:17] is that right but God and God reveals
[1:32:22] and declares whatsoever he has said he
[1:32:25] will bring back to our remembrance
[1:32:27] they're right
[1:32:29] could over it be to God so he says don't
[1:32:34] fight this just let loose and let him do
[1:32:38] it and just commit it to him the
[1:32:42] greatest weapon that I know of
[1:32:44] a Christian today is a committal to God
[1:32:46] when you can't do nothing about it just
[1:32:49] commit it to him and God will take care
[1:32:51] of it
[1:32:53] commit it to him God will take care of
[1:32:56] it
[1:32:57] now watch what's this looming their
[1:32:59] narrow this down here on the fretting in
[1:33:01] Proverbs 24 17 rejoice not wind an enemy
[1:33:07] falleth and let not thine heart be glad
[1:33:11] when he stumbleth love does not rejoice
[1:33:14] in iniquity I knew it all along I hate
[1:33:21] that in looking back discernment I knew
[1:33:23] he was that all along I knew lest the
[1:33:36] Lord see it watch this lest the Lord see
[1:33:39] it and it displeased him and he turn
[1:33:43] away his wrath from him so haughty I
[1:33:50] knew God was going to deliver me and
[1:33:53] fire her I knew God was gonna remove him
[1:33:59] I just knew it because I'm a son of God
[1:34:01] and he came against me God says huh I
[1:34:05] think I'll just pull it back and I think
[1:34:08] I'll promote him I think I'll promote
[1:34:12] her
[1:34:16] hmm verse 19 fret not thyself because of
[1:34:22] evil men neither be thou envious at the
[1:34:25] wicked for there shall be no reward to
[1:34:28] the evil man the candle of the wicked
[1:34:30] shall be put out my son look at this
[1:34:33] wisdom my son fear the Lord and the King
[1:34:35] and metal not with them that are given
[1:34:38] to change for their calamity shall rise
[1:34:42] suddenly and who knoweth the ruin of
[1:34:43] them both I want you to think of the
[1:34:49] Lord Jesus here in the closing moments
[1:34:50] on the cross kind of looked at this last
[1:34:54] week but in the midst of what was taking
[1:34:57] place he said Father forgive them clear
[1:35:05] - his last moments he was tested it's
[1:35:10] anything is there anything that can
[1:35:13] anchor into his heart is there any
[1:35:15] bitterness any enmity anything and all
[1:35:19] that can come and he says Father forgive
[1:35:24] her how how listen to me now the spirit
[1:35:30] left him in the Garden of Gethsemane it
[1:35:36] left him but here he is hanging on the
[1:35:39] cross it's committed there had been such
[1:35:43] a committal that had taken place even
[1:35:45] there even in the garden the full
[1:35:47] submission - here he is on the cross
[1:35:50] Father forgive him
[1:35:52] they don't know what they're doing you
[1:35:55] remember when brother Branham and spoken
[1:35:57] words original seed a trial came up and
[1:36:02] brother Brent says oh he said forget
[1:36:05] about it somebody was pointing something
[1:36:06] out to him they were pointing it out
[1:36:08] Brent's - forget about it
[1:36:10] he said that was predestinated before
[1:36:12] the before the world - give me a trial
[1:36:15] and you know what they said how can you
[1:36:18] look at it that way but that's what he
[1:36:24] answered it was predestinated to give me
[1:36:27] a trial
[1:36:29] what was happening a committal it was
[1:36:32] committing himself because he because
[1:36:35] they said this is about you and your
[1:36:37] family somebody is talking about you and
[1:36:38] your family the brem says forget it
[1:36:41] forget it here they are the disciples
[1:36:48] asked you for a few moments I didn't ask
[1:36:50] you for an hour here they are the Lord
[1:36:56] Jesus his face is set toward Jerusalem
[1:36:59] and he he tells them to go ahead he says
[1:37:02] and tell him we'd like to come into this
[1:37:04] village in Samaria
[1:37:06] well they send people out to meet him
[1:37:10] and say we don't want you here and so
[1:37:15] John the Beloved hey why don't we call
[1:37:24] fire down out of heaven like Elijah did
[1:37:29] but Elijah didn't do it out of his
[1:37:34] vexation of his spirit Elijah didn't do
[1:37:40] that like you're wronged me you don't
[1:37:43] want us in this village send fire down
[1:37:45] and consume them now there's no doubt
[1:37:50] that John we could say well John was
[1:37:52] looking back into that time of Elijah to
[1:37:54] where Elijah was there preserved and the
[1:37:57] fire itself was there issued out and it
[1:38:00] took away those men that came to take
[1:38:02] him but you see what the Lord Jesus
[1:38:04] caught was he said you don't know what
[1:38:06] spirits are up see it was discerning
[1:38:09] your knittin look this opposition is
[1:38:11] coming but look out the Lord Jesus
[1:38:13] handles that he said you don't even know
[1:38:15] what spirit you're up now I want you to
[1:38:16] think about this what if the water if
[1:38:18] fire had been called down there wouldn't
[1:38:22] have been no place to send Philip to but
[1:38:26] there was some more seed down in Samaria
[1:38:29] and when Philip and Philip got sent
[1:38:32] after persecution came Paul made havoc
[1:38:34] of the church Church scattered him God
[1:38:37] sent Philip down to Samaria and Samaria
[1:38:40] wend brother Philip went down there
[1:38:41] in the word and hearts were one to the
[1:38:44] Lord God knows what he's doing for that
[1:38:50] moment in time what if the Lord Jesus
[1:38:52] had stopped there at that moment in time
[1:38:54] what if they had received him his face
[1:38:56] was to go to Jerusalem think of that
[1:39:10] you think he didn't know he could have
[1:39:13] known that was gonna reject that they
[1:39:14] was gonna turn him out sometimes there's
[1:39:19] things that you're turned out of some
[1:39:20] things sometimes there's things that
[1:39:22] don't work out and things don't happen
[1:39:25] across the spectrum but you know what
[1:39:28] God knows exactly what to do to get us
[1:39:32] in position our face is fixed on Jesus
[1:39:37] and there's certain places he don't want
[1:39:41] to stop him it doesn't mean that that
[1:39:44] place may not get visited later but God
[1:39:47] knows no doubt may be sitting right here
[1:39:50] there's been people that maybe you
[1:39:52] worked with and then after a period of
[1:39:55] time how that God would turn around
[1:39:57] different ones maybe in your
[1:39:59] neighborhood maybe they even rejected
[1:40:02] the gospel when it was first given to
[1:40:04] him but they turn around because there's
[1:40:08] a seed and they turn around and receive
[1:40:10] it but send me of that impossible come
[1:40:15] on friends Paul himself was a persecutor
[1:40:18] of the Church of the Living God
[1:40:19] Paul himself said I was a blasphemer he
[1:40:23] said I did it in ignorance is that right
[1:40:25] this is where even the Prophet could not
[1:40:28] just say it about Scripture but witness
[1:40:30] it even in his own meetings he said you
[1:40:32] let the power of God come down and said
[1:40:33] and God will take ahold of a skeptic
[1:40:35] someone who's been a despiser and a
[1:40:38] rejecter of these meetings he said and
[1:40:40] God will come down and do a work in that
[1:40:42] heart he said I'll turn him into a
[1:40:43] witness that's why sometimes you don't
[1:40:49] know when we're shaking the dirt off
[1:40:50] don't throw the shoe Adam I hope you
[1:40:56] with me tonight just because your family
[1:40:58] don't receive and don't respond don't
[1:41:00] shake don't shake it off and throw the
[1:41:02] dirt Adam come on just recognize for
[1:41:06] this moment because when they shook the
[1:41:08] dirt off their shoes back there in
[1:41:10] Antioch the Bible we read in acts 19
[1:41:12] they went back to Antioch when at the
[1:41:15] appointed time and God knows every every
[1:41:19] one of those junctions he knows when
[1:41:21] descendants he knows when to open the
[1:41:23] door
[1:41:24] faithful what must we do commit
[1:41:28] ourselves to the Lord commit ourselves
[1:41:30] think of it even when Paul went off the
[1:41:32] scene every messenger went off the scene
[1:41:34] when the Prophet himself went off the
[1:41:36] scene look at this the message that has
[1:41:38] been delivered to you and I what does he
[1:41:40] do it he committed to the Lord knowing
[1:41:44] that God's Word it cannot fail God
[1:41:48] cannot fail oh ma no longer there will
[1:41:52] be a bride there is a bride not they
[1:41:57] will be in His image B they are in His
[1:41:59] image in his likeness glory be to God he
[1:42:05] committed this is a word it's been
[1:42:08] committed to the Lord how much more God
[1:42:11] knows every situation knows every part
[1:42:13] in our lives
[1:42:14] he knows everything you've been through
[1:42:15] everything you're going through
[1:42:17] everything you and I will go through but
[1:42:19] what it comes down to committed to him
[1:42:22] who judge righteously say Lord my spirit
[1:42:26] that's all tore up all of this that's
[1:42:29] all bothering a committed Lord into your
[1:42:32] hands and let him have it he's faithful
[1:42:40] and he cares do you care you loved him
[1:42:47] tonight
[1:42:47] oh just I'm so thankful to the Lord
[1:42:50] let's just bow our heads in order prayer
[1:42:53] Lord Jesus you are so faithful Lord
[1:42:58] thank you Lord for your word that you've
[1:43:02] given to us tonight Lord to instruct us
[1:43:05] and to lead us Lord and direct us Lord
[1:43:08] you are truly Lord as Peter would
[1:43:12] admonish us by the Spirit of God that
[1:43:15] how that the enemy himself roaming about
[1:43:18] as a roaring lion seeking whom he may
[1:43:20] devour but Lord has were admonished gird
[1:43:24] up the loins of our mind Lord that
[1:43:29] girding up Lord taking the belt and
[1:43:32] tightening it a little tighter Lord
[1:43:36] gird about with truth truth and Lord we
[1:43:41] recognize the truth truth is the person
[1:43:46] Lord Jesus you know every every need you
[1:43:51] know every situation that's here tonight
[1:43:54] every everything Lord that in any of our
[1:43:58] hearts Lord that we have either been
[1:44:00] through or going through you even you
[1:44:02] see all of this Lord and when you have
[1:44:04] come tonight to speak to us you have not
[1:44:07] come Lord to condemn but you do correct
[1:44:10] us and you do show us Lord that there is
[1:44:13] authority we have as we looked at it
[1:44:16] last week I have power to lay my life
[1:44:19] down and I have power to take it up
[1:44:21] again we have within Lord that authority
[1:44:24] Lord to submit ourselves to you well the
[1:44:29] scripture said submit ourselves unto God
[1:44:33] then resist the devil and he will flee
[1:44:38] from you Lord if we submit put ourselves
[1:44:42] under the word put every part under the
[1:44:46] word Lord and Lord Jesus sometimes Lord
[1:44:50] in our lives we do we experience things
[1:44:53] Lord that can so vex us in our spirits
[1:44:57] things Lord that can be said and be done
[1:45:00] the Lord is is likened unto that of
[1:45:03] betrayal wounds that can come up in our
[1:45:05] lives the Lord Jesus even in the midst
[1:45:10] of persecution and trial father we
[1:45:14] receive it Lord we're not exempt from
[1:45:18] that you yourself when you came down and
[1:45:20] walked here upon this earth you are not
[1:45:24] removed from that but you showed us the
[1:45:27] way of how to overcome and overcoming is
[1:45:30] always putting ourselves last it's you

[1:57:45] they're yours now
[1:57:48] from the start to the finish honey
[1:57:57] baby give me
[1:58:00] [Music]
