[37:36] oh my goodness it was just tremendous i
[37:40] i just was so enjoying it myself and i
[37:42] said i wish i was there because it's not
[37:44] the same i've i've had the stream before
[37:47] it's it's just not the same you know
[37:48] brother brown tells us when we gather
[37:50] together and we know that to be the true
[37:53] it's more of the godhead bodily among us
[37:56] and
[37:57] say how did you act in your living room
[37:59] well i act in my living room just like i
[38:01] act here
[38:02] i don't act any different at home
[38:05] uh you know but it just was so good and
[38:08] just such a rich word for this hour so
[38:11] encouraging
[38:12] amen so strengthening in our lives and i
[38:14] just so appreciate uh brother nathan
[38:17] coming there uh without myself not
[38:20] knowing exactly the direction of
[38:21] different things to go i thought i
[38:23] better go ahead and get on this and
[38:26] and get brother nathan here and i
[38:28] appreciate those of you how you stood
[38:30] here even last thursday
[38:32] and brother richard with gomez they had
[38:34] to
[38:35] just really as i called them and asked
[38:37] them at that point in time if they'll
[38:39] just take
[38:40] and do a prayer meeting at that time and
[38:44] so they did and i appreciate that and i
[38:46] know different ones as they were able to
[38:48] be here we're here and uh there's
[38:50] certainly one thing that we can never do
[38:52] too much of and that's pray
[38:54] friends say we might sing too much we
[38:56] might read too much we can do a lot of
[38:58] things too much but we can never pray
[39:00] too much
[39:01] and so we we just always want to to be
[39:04] in prayer
[39:06] um
[39:07] i think that's i think that's pretty
[39:08] much it of what i wanted to share with
[39:10] you i
[39:13] i really am i want you to pray for me
[39:15] because i was very torn about whether to
[39:17] even uh go this weekend i just kept on
[39:20] moving back and forth and uh just just
[39:23] praying about it because i wanted to be
[39:24] here and there's things that even last
[39:26] week i was ready to bring
[39:28] to the church and so
[39:31] but god knows everything in god's time
[39:33] and we just need to hear from him
[39:35] so
[39:37] everybody doing okay
[39:39] okay all right
[39:41] well let's just let's turn in the word
[39:43] of god if we can thank the musicians i
[39:46] want to also thank the lord for
[39:48] just touching paul and
[39:51] you know there's a lot of different
[39:52] things that as you if something that you
[39:56] i don't want to give this too much time
[39:57] but as you
[39:59] if you have a question about something
[40:01] at any time on whether to come or not to
[40:04] come you can always call the deacons or
[40:06] myself i know there's a lot of different
[40:08] guidelines and some new things that's
[40:10] even today has even been further altered
[40:13] of some things that they're further
[40:14] learning so if you have any question at
[40:16] all you can always call the deacons or
[40:19] or myself and you've done very well with
[40:21] that i can tell you that as a
[40:22] congregation whether it's been a text or
[40:24] a call or someone's asked me about the
[40:26] samuel what about this and we've gone
[40:28] according to everything we know
[40:30] at that time that there's been more
[40:32] things that they've updated i i'm glad
[40:34] they're coming to more of an
[40:35] understanding on things uh you know
[40:37] because everything that's come about was
[40:40] is definitely new and and i can always
[40:42] respect where people are a person could
[40:43] say hey we got this wrong here but this
[40:45] is i can always respect that because you
[40:47] know why we're all human
[40:49] all of us and so i can always really
[40:51] appreciate that so let's just keep also
[40:53] one another in prayer
[40:55] and uh let's as we look into the word of
[40:57] the lord here tonight
[40:59] as we have our bibles open maybe we just
[41:01] bow our hearts in just in a word of
[41:02] prayer
[41:03] heavenly father
[41:05] lord it's just so good to be here
[41:08] tonight lord
[41:09] i am just so thankful lord whether i was
[41:12] a speaker or just a common just to set
[41:15] and pull on the word of god on the gift
[41:18] of god to lord to receive from you and
[41:22] just to be here lord with brothers and
[41:24] sisters of light precious faith and i
[41:26] know there's some lord tonight that they
[41:29] would love to be here lord but for
[41:31] certain measures and certain things that
[41:33] lord they're looking at and lord being
[41:36] precautious or different things lord i
[41:38] pray that god that you'll just richly
[41:41] minister to them those that are are sick
[41:43] lord i pray that you'll touch them lord
[41:46] as we thank you god for touching paul's
[41:49] body lord we thank you for lord your
[41:52] hand of mercy that's been on us as an
[41:54] assembly lord we love you and we thank
[41:57] you lord i don't know what i would do we
[41:59] don't know what we would do without you
[42:02] lord for it's your leadership that's so
[42:04] precious in this hour father we love you
[42:07] and we thank you lord we ask that you'll
[42:09] just come and be the speaker of the word
[42:12] now lord just help me to step aside and
[42:14] may you come down lord anoint that gift
[42:17] you've placed in my life and you just
[42:19] use it lord just take the words those
[42:22] things that you've laid on my heart you
[42:24] know how lord to unfold it it's your
[42:26] mind lord that you've sat lord upon my
[42:29] heart so i just ask that the mind of
[42:31] christ would have the right of way here
[42:33] this evening we pray in the name of
[42:35] jesus christ amen
[42:38] amen
[42:40] luke chapter 6
[42:41] and verse
[42:42] 46
[42:44] and just read a few verses of scripture
[42:46] before we're being seated
[42:49] and why call ye me lord
[42:51] lord
[42:52] and do not the things which i say now
[42:54] this word lord lord is his master
[42:59] is his ruler he that is has the chief of
[43:02] my life so why call you me lord lord and
[43:06] do not the things
[43:09] which i say
[43:10] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[43:13] sayings and do with them i will show you
[43:16] to whom he is like
[43:17] he's like a man which built a house
[43:20] and digged
[43:22] deep
[43:22] and laid the foundation on a rock when
[43:26] the floods the flood arose
[43:28] the stream be beat vehemently upon that
[43:31] house and could not shake it for it was
[43:34] founded upon a rock
[43:37] but he that heareth
[43:39] and doeth not
[43:40] is like a man that without a foundation
[43:44] built and house upon the earth
[43:47] against which the stream did vehement
[43:50] did beat vehemently and immediately
[43:53] it fell and the ruin of that house
[43:56] was great
[43:58] amen may god bless the reading of the
[44:00] word as you're being seated
[44:02] i want to just speak here just a few
[44:04] moments tonight
[44:05] just meditating on thoughts that
[44:09] when we were looking at before
[44:11] on that thought of unaltered
[44:14] and i just thinking of this pondering
[44:16] this it's just just inspiring to my
[44:18] heart upon this thought is like what i'd
[44:20] like to speak
[44:22] from that
[44:23] is being changed by the unchanging god
[44:28] we
[44:28] we
[44:30] look here
[44:31] in the scriptures and we know that james
[44:34] would pick up this very thought as well
[44:37] in that
[44:39] we want to be
[44:40] doers of the word and not just hearers
[44:43] only
[44:45] james would write about how a hearer is
[44:47] just
[44:48] someone who is like beholding themselves
[44:51] in a mirror
[44:53] but then they walk away and they forget
[44:56] about what they saw in the mirror
[44:58] and the mirror was actually reflecting
[45:01] or showing
[45:03] things that needed to be attended to and
[45:07] taken heed to
[45:08] and we realized in our own life and i
[45:10] just say this and lord willing will come
[45:12] to it a little later in the service
[45:15] god has not entrusted that you or i
[45:18] we are the ones who change our own lives
[45:22] it's god who brings about change in our
[45:25] life
[45:26] the only thing that god asked of you and
[45:28] i is where we can stand in his presence
[45:31] and really take account of when the word
[45:34] is dealing with our life and then open
[45:37] and surrender our life and yield to him
[45:40] and say lord
[45:42] change me lord
[45:44] is to be very open with god because
[45:47] god's being very open with us
[45:49] you know the bible says faithful are the
[45:53] wounds of a friend
[45:55] and how that you know that
[45:58] deceptive
[45:59] are those secret kisses of another
[46:02] we want in god we can always count that
[46:04] god is always going to be up front with
[46:06] us
[46:07] because the bible would tell us in
[46:09] another place in the communion chapter
[46:12] there in first corinthians 11 of how
[46:15] that that if that in our lives that god
[46:18] will come and deal with our life lest we
[46:21] be condemned with the world
[46:24] god's desire every time that he brings
[46:26] any form of correction or admonition or
[46:29] anything in our life is that our life
[46:32] there would be a further separation from
[46:35] the things of the world and that our
[46:38] lives would be yielded to him because we
[46:40] are put here for a purpose to serve him
[46:44] and to display his glory
[46:47] in every part of our life this as god
[46:50] would call us in this hour
[46:53] it's it's something us as the lord jesus
[46:55] would say to those who would say lord
[46:58] lord and yet he's not really the ruler
[47:02] or the master of their life we do not
[47:04] want to be people
[47:06] even in this hour in this time where
[47:08] we're just simply acknowledging the word
[47:11] or agreeing with the word simply because
[47:14] we know it's the scripture or we know
[47:16] it's the message but we want the word to
[47:19] change our lives
[47:21] because that's why this word has come to
[47:24] change us
[47:25] brother braham tells us in the time of
[47:27] martin luther brother ram said with the
[47:29] explosion of truth that was present upon
[47:33] the earth in that hour he said they had
[47:36] such an explosion of truth that it just
[47:39] could have sent the world and everything
[47:42] right into emotion right into a real
[47:44] motion where hearts were being so
[47:47] transformed and changed but
[47:49] there were many that as brother baby
[47:51] says were only hearing the word in a
[47:55] manner to debate it they were not
[47:57] hearing the word and this is how he says
[48:00] it that it might have a practical
[48:03] outworking in their life
[48:05] if there's one thing that we want to see
[48:08] we want to see this word having an
[48:10] effect in our life
[48:12] because we know that the word has within
[48:15] it transforming power
[48:17] that has that that has the ability
[48:20] to transform us and change us
[48:23] and so when we when we look here in the
[48:26] scripture
[48:27] we find that as it comes down to in our
[48:29] life and i want to just kind of lay a
[48:31] little precursor in looking at it like
[48:34] this
[48:35] that there must be a right foundation in
[48:38] our life a solid foundation in order to
[48:41] build upon
[48:42] because you can't build upon a wrong
[48:46] foundation
[48:47] there's got to be just like when they go
[48:49] to build a house
[48:51] jesus is speaking of this here to where
[48:53] you don't just go build on the ground as
[48:56] you see it if you hire a contractor
[48:58] they're going to dig down to a certain
[49:00] place based on the dynamics of the of
[49:03] the land and water and everything else
[49:06] but there has to be a foundation no
[49:09] matter how well a house looks up here if
[49:12] something's wrong with the foundation
[49:15] the rest of that house it'll never stand
[49:18] there'll be problems there'll be
[49:19] everything else that's why that in many
[49:22] times we are looking sometimes at what
[49:25] we see out here on the surface and it's
[49:27] not the surface that needs to be dealt
[49:29] with
[49:30] it's coming back to the right foundation
[49:33] and to recognize that anything that
[49:36] comes about
[49:38] should be tied in directly and under the
[49:42] influence of the right foundation
[49:47] so brother branham would take this
[49:51] and brother brown would speak about in
[49:53] this foundation because a foundation is
[49:55] so important of things in the natural as
[49:58] well as things in the spiritual
[50:02] and to think he says bill abraham says
[50:04] i'm believing that the day that we're
[50:05] living now the most essential thing that
[50:08] i could think of a minister speaking is
[50:10] to get the people back to the general
[50:12] principles of the gospel how many
[50:14] believe that that's the message of the
[50:16] hour
[50:17] the message of the hour is not mysteries
[50:20] the message of the hour
[50:23] is that reflection from the throne of
[50:26] almighty god that brings the church back
[50:29] to that foundation as a matter of fact
[50:33] this message that god has given to you
[50:35] and i
[50:36] it is a message to where that the holy
[50:39] spirit has come and has built the church
[50:43] under the very holy spirit the power of
[50:47] god has built this church into a
[50:50] dwelling place of god himself
[50:53] it's been the word it's the principles
[50:55] of the word because creeds can never
[50:57] produce this
[50:59] dogmas can never produce this
[51:01] but it's kind of come back he said to a
[51:03] place for if you're not built upon the
[51:05] right foundation it's no good what's the
[51:08] use of building upon a foundation that's
[51:10] already been condemned
[51:13] he said what would the use of trying to
[51:15] paper and paint an old building that the
[51:18] government had condemned that's what
[51:20] many people are trying to do today by
[51:23] reforming
[51:24] trying to reform
[51:27] the gospel is not
[51:29] uh a reformation
[51:31] but the gospel comes to bring
[51:34] transformation
[51:36] in our life
[51:38] so it's not a reforming
[51:40] it's a transforming
[51:42] even working in our lives as believers
[51:45] on the foundation of our life it's not
[51:48] god reforming us or calling us to reform
[51:52] ourselves it's god working to transform
[51:56] our lives into his very image
[52:00] now i want you to notice this he says
[52:02] all these other things would be just a
[52:04] wasting time i'm going to start a new
[52:06] page here i'm going to try to do a
[52:08] little bit better than than i've done
[52:10] here brother brown said it's even
[52:11] foolish to try you're wasting your time
[52:14] and he says you've got to start back to
[52:16] the foundation you've got to build a new
[52:19] place not patch up the old one build a
[52:22] brand new one you've got to come back
[52:24] and start right that's the reason you
[52:26] see so many faulty mistakes so many
[52:29] people in different people who profess
[52:33] christianity he said you are only the
[52:36] you are the only bible that many people
[52:38] will ever read you christians your life
[52:41] is the only bible that men a lot of men
[52:44] and women will ever read just the way
[52:46] you act and do so christians are
[52:48] supposed to be a living example of what
[52:51] christ is and if christ is in the human
[52:54] heart then he will certainly live his
[52:57] own life for christ is in you and the
[53:00] spirit of christ be in you then you
[53:02] become a new creature
[53:04] so we talk about a foundation there is
[53:08] no other foundation that faith can
[53:11] really rest on than the word of god
[53:14] we could go through and we have in times
[53:16] past with different subjects a litany of
[53:19] scriptures that speak and express where
[53:22] god is the inspiration of god would
[53:25] strike all of those down through time
[53:28] david writing many places in the psalms
[53:31] of the assurity
[53:33] that is in the word of god that the word
[53:35] of god is established forever
[53:38] if how that god's word it cannot fail
[53:42] whatever's gone out of his mouth
[53:44] he's going to back it up and perform it
[53:47] so yeah that's something we it's god
[53:50] that you and i it's one thing to look at
[53:52] that and say that is tremendous and you
[53:55] must have that faith to even present
[53:57] yourself before god but then to even
[54:01] rest within the assurance that he brings
[54:03] in our life by the holy spirit which is
[54:07] the word of god the holy spirit is not
[54:10] something separate from the word of god
[54:12] but the holy spirit is christ himself is
[54:16] the word of god it is the writings of
[54:19] the word inside of you you know it's not
[54:22] something that's different but it's a
[54:25] word experience that ties us into the
[54:29] word to where our lives are regulated
[54:32] and lived by the word of god
[54:35] and so this is why that here in isaiah
[54:39] it would write it would read like this
[54:41] in isaiah 40 verse 6 the voice said cry
[54:44] and he said what shall i cry all flesh
[54:47] is grass and all the goodliness thereof
[54:50] is as the flower of the field the grass
[54:52] withereth the flower fadeth because the
[54:55] spirit of the lord bloweth upon it
[54:58] surely the people is grass the grass
[55:01] withereth the flower fadeth but the word
[55:04] of our god
[55:05] shall stand forever
[55:09] hallelujah
[55:11] glory be to god we're talking about
[55:13] standing in this day when paul said
[55:16] having done all to stand stand therefore
[55:20] and the only way that we can stand is to
[55:23] have the living god the word of god
[55:26] standing in our lives
[55:30] are you with me
[55:32] oh my i just i i was going i'm just
[55:34] going to move from running some
[55:36] scripture but i'm just going to stay
[55:37] here tonight because we want to go we
[55:39] won't get nowhere first corinthians 3 10
[55:42] according to the notice what paul says
[55:44] according to the grace of god which is
[55:46] given unto me as a wise
[55:49] master builder
[55:52] i have laid the foundation
[55:54] and another buildeth thereon but let
[55:57] every man take heed how he buildeth
[55:58] their own
[55:59] for other foundation can no man lay than
[56:03] that that is laid which is
[56:06] jesus christ
[56:08] i'll say it like this the foundation
[56:11] of every life of every believer is the
[56:14] revelation of jesus christ to you
[56:18] dwelling in you
[56:21] amen and that's personal
[56:24] that's a foundation that's an anchor
[56:27] remember paul would speak of it as in
[56:29] hebrews 6 as that assurance we have as
[56:34] an anchor that enters into within the
[56:38] veil and we know what an anchor does an
[56:40] anchor is there to keep you
[56:43] resting solid in one place
[56:47] because waves are going to come
[56:50] storms are going to come
[56:52] tests are going to come
[56:53] trials are going to come disappointments
[56:56] are going to come mistakes are going to
[56:57] come but there must be an anchor
[57:02] that when everything is said and done
[57:04] the tossing and so forth but there is an
[57:07] anchor as it writes again in the
[57:09] scripture there is a rock that you're
[57:12] founded upon it in other words the
[57:14] question becomes very real and very
[57:17] clear that in that manner that are
[57:21] are you founded upon the rock
[57:23] are you anchored in jesus christ
[57:27] you see
[57:28] satan will always come
[57:31] to task brother rem tells us this and i
[57:33] think it's very very good in the message
[57:35] the contest
[57:37] we are made up in three parts body
[57:39] spirit and soul
[57:41] and the new birth is that which pertains
[57:44] to the soul
[57:46] the holy spirit can fall remember we
[57:48] went through that on the courts up here
[57:50] the holy spirit can fall
[57:52] upon the spirit and upon the flesh
[57:55] and even where a person could enjoy
[57:58] brother graham said can be in the outer
[57:59] court and enjoy the word of god why that
[58:02] and it looks good wow i see that wow
[58:04] that looks good but you see
[58:06] there's something that to a believer
[58:09] that it's not just enough to just say
[58:12] wow i like that wow i see that oh yeah
[58:15] this goes together here this goes
[58:17] together there it's something about it
[58:19] as they come near the presence of god
[58:21] for it's the holy spirit drawing them
[58:24] the desire becomes for the living god
[58:27] because there's only one thing that can
[58:29] satisfy that in a heart and that is god
[58:32] himself who put that thirst on the
[58:35] inside it's god alone that makes a man
[58:38] or a woman a son and daughter of god
[58:41] anchored in the promise no matter what
[58:43] test comes no matter what a hell could
[58:46] break around around them but there is an
[58:48] anchor in their life they are the same
[58:51] they are the same just as he is the same
[58:54] yesterday today and forever what is it
[58:57] they have an experience a foundation
[59:00] that identifies that they are connected
[59:03] with him who is faithful the same
[59:06] yesterday today and forever
[59:09] i'm not talking about if you get
[59:10] discouraged we all face discouragement
[59:12] at times we all can get down but i'm
[59:15] talking about a life that even in the
[59:17] midst of things that's taking place
[59:19] around it's a life that is remaining
[59:22] steadfast in the things of almighty god
[59:25] a life that is founded upon the rock
[59:27] it's got a foundation when storms come
[59:30] against it rain comes against it when
[59:33] temptations are sail there is an anchor
[59:36] on the inside
[59:38] you're not going to find that man or
[59:39] woman running around back in the world
[59:42] and saying well you know if this hadn't
[59:44] happened if so-and-so hadn't done this
[59:45] to me if that you know what it comes
[59:48] down to is they never went deep enough
[59:50] in jesus
[59:52] i'm telling you friends this is an hour
[59:53] we've got to be straight
[59:56] i've had to be straight many times in
[59:57] that back office there straight right
[59:59] here at this pulpit at times it's a time
[1:00:02] that reality is it's time where we're
[1:00:05] looking at things there's got to be a
[1:00:07] life that no matter of the tests and
[1:00:09] trials of life you can still look at
[1:00:12] that person and say that's a christian
[1:00:14] no matter it's not always a sunny day
[1:00:17] it's not always a a real happy day but
[1:00:21] down inside of their soul there is joy
[1:00:26] i'm talking about a foundation
[1:00:28] a foundation that cannot be shaken
[1:00:32] a foundation that's firm that that
[1:00:34] should just give us a rejoicing
[1:00:37] within our heart
[1:00:38] because this foundation that we are
[1:00:41] we are anchored to
[1:00:42] is jesus christ
[1:00:45] amen this word
[1:00:48] this word you know there's no way
[1:00:51] without without the word of god
[1:00:54] you see for us to come into the places
[1:00:57] that we have now that we are now
[1:00:59] dwelling in in christ god has laid all
[1:01:01] of this out within his word and when
[1:01:03] paul could say that i have laid the
[1:01:05] foundation where no other man can lay it
[1:01:07] was that revelation of jesus christ look
[1:01:11] when paul went up to the upper coast of
[1:01:13] ephesus when he went up there they were
[1:01:15] all you know john's disciples baptizing
[1:01:18] and john and all of those things they
[1:01:20] were right now listen to me now they
[1:01:22] were right in that place
[1:01:25] but notice there was a desire within
[1:01:28] their life to know more of god
[1:01:31] you say how can that be because god sent
[1:01:35] them the answer that they were craving
[1:01:38] for
[1:01:39] and paul came along to him and he began
[1:01:42] to talk to him and he realized wait a
[1:01:43] minute he said he said what what have
[1:01:46] you been baptized unto what and they
[1:01:48] said unto john's baptism and john apollo
[1:01:52] at that moment could recognize that they
[1:01:55] had not there had not been ministered
[1:01:57] unto them that the atonement the lord
[1:02:00] jesus christ being the paschal lamb it's
[1:02:03] already been offered up and now the holy
[1:02:06] ghost has come back to the church of the
[1:02:08] living god they they did not know that
[1:02:11] junction of time but you see this is why
[1:02:14] god sent his word because the holy ghost
[1:02:17] will travel with the word
[1:02:20] because it takes the spirit of god to
[1:02:23] give the word and so then what happens
[1:02:25] it's the holy spirit coming with the
[1:02:28] word to deliver the word and bring an
[1:02:30] experience where a life is founded upon
[1:02:34] the right foundation when paul walked
[1:02:36] away from them in ephesus after they
[1:02:39] themselves had been filled with the holy
[1:02:41] ghost baptized in the name of jesus
[1:02:43] christ paul never had to worry about him
[1:02:47] why they were founded on a true
[1:02:50] foundation
[1:02:51] this is why when paul when he could
[1:02:53] stand there or not paul but peter when
[1:02:55] peter could speak of how
[1:02:57] you know peter was speaking the
[1:02:59] revelation of jesus christ in the house
[1:03:01] of cornelius having the keys here here
[1:03:04] turning that to the gentiles notice when
[1:03:07] that would take place the holy ghost
[1:03:09] falls on them
[1:03:11] first
[1:03:12] then they are baptized in the name of
[1:03:16] the lord jesus christ
[1:03:18] you see it shows that the holy spirit
[1:03:21] will always work in accordance with his
[1:03:24] word to bring his word to pass
[1:03:29] it always works on that right foundation
[1:03:31] and this is why i just say it to you
[1:03:33] here tonight
[1:03:34] the foundation where we have been placed
[1:03:38] as believers in this hour
[1:03:40] we have not been placed upon the ideas
[1:03:43] of a man
[1:03:44] let me just say some things pretty
[1:03:46] straight
[1:03:47] this message is not the ideas of william
[1:03:50] branham
[1:03:52] are you with me
[1:03:54] nor does god need anybody coming in and
[1:03:57] trying to sort out and tell us what is
[1:04:00] and what is it
[1:04:02] that's plain and straight but we have
[1:04:04] been established brother brown himself
[1:04:06] would say that there is nothing that
[1:04:08] should be there in the church because
[1:04:12] then you know that's outside of that
[1:04:14] that foundation of god's word it's the
[1:04:16] complete program of his church as he
[1:04:18] would lay that down so this message that
[1:04:21] god has sent to you and i brother and
[1:04:23] sister i can tell you just like this and
[1:04:25] i'll say this i say it by the grace of
[1:04:26] god i i don't have to quote i could
[1:04:29] preach this message from the bible
[1:04:32] well brother samuel what do you i do
[1:04:34] because i'm inspired and i'm not ashamed
[1:04:37] to quote what has been said by the
[1:04:40] messenger
[1:04:41] are you with me i i'm not ashamed of
[1:04:43] that i'm given to this word how you've
[1:04:46] experienced it even as i've experienced
[1:04:48] it standing right here and reading
[1:04:50] because this message is not the thoughts
[1:04:53] of a man
[1:04:54] i'm telling you friends it's deadly when
[1:04:56] people want to start messing around and
[1:04:58] trying to take out and say this was
[1:05:00] brother branham slots it's deadly
[1:05:03] because you have to answer the question
[1:05:05] where does that stop
[1:05:09] are you with me it's like a disease that
[1:05:11] gets started
[1:05:12] preach brother samuel i think i will
[1:05:15] this is a right foundation we've been
[1:05:17] placed on is jesus christ this message
[1:05:21] has exalted jesus christ and brought
[1:05:24] back that revelation in the church to
[1:05:27] where when people see you and i they're
[1:05:29] not seeing brother branham they see
[1:05:31] jesus christ
[1:05:34] braham wanted nothing to do with
[1:05:36] anything like that
[1:05:38] this is why in ephesians chapter 2 when
[1:05:41] paul would write of it like this
[1:05:42] speaking of this foundation and let us
[1:05:45] know
[1:05:45] therefore you are no more strangers and
[1:05:47] foreigners
[1:05:49] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[1:05:50] of the household of god and are built
[1:05:52] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[1:05:54] prophets jesus christ himself being the
[1:05:57] chief
[1:05:58] cornerstone
[1:06:00] see we're part
[1:06:01] of that foundation i want you just to
[1:06:03] catch this just for a moment
[1:06:05] we are part of that original foundation
[1:06:10] we were always a part of that original
[1:06:13] foundation
[1:06:15] that foundation is the word himself
[1:06:19] are you with me
[1:06:21] now remember the word itself it sets
[1:06:25] it rests brother ben talks about that
[1:06:27] masterpiece there resting on the
[1:06:30] pedestal of those four steps the four
[1:06:33] patriarchs you know faith of love and of
[1:06:36] grace and perfection
[1:06:39] it rests the whole work of god rest upon
[1:06:43] faith
[1:06:44] love grace and perfection and all of
[1:06:48] those four are are a part of whom god is
[1:06:51] and his working in our life that there
[1:06:54] the very image that comes forth
[1:06:56] is that of the word that is spoken by
[1:07:00] the prophets
[1:07:02] god builds his body
[1:07:04] is everybody with me
[1:07:06] so we are built upon the foundation of
[1:07:08] the apostles and prophets jesus christ
[1:07:11] himself being the chief cornerstone so
[1:07:13] right now in this time this there was a
[1:07:16] promise given to the philadelphian age
[1:07:18] is that right
[1:07:19] i will make a pillar in the temple of my
[1:07:22] god
[1:07:23] is that right
[1:07:24] god also had said in that time that
[1:07:27] there is an open door i have set before
[1:07:29] thee
[1:07:30] that open door was a return to the
[1:07:33] original bible way
[1:07:36] of where god would bring a real
[1:07:40] experience into the lives of the people
[1:07:43] it was a missionary age but then through
[1:07:45] that it would further catapult on down
[1:07:48] into the age we're living in i it all
[1:07:51] comes down to just saying it like this
[1:07:53] god was even announcing that the return
[1:07:57] to the original way the real fullness of
[1:08:00] pentecost god had already begun to open
[1:08:03] and it would come forth in this last day
[1:08:09] we're not just here
[1:08:11] under a portion
[1:08:14] it's the fullness
[1:08:16] of god among us
[1:08:20] that's the revealing
[1:08:21] of the son of man
[1:08:24] i say it like this we are part as
[1:08:27] brother branham would say it we are part
[1:08:29] of that same structure
[1:08:31] in other words the same experience
[1:08:34] that peter had
[1:08:35] we
[1:08:36] have see peter
[1:08:39] peter those there starting out
[1:08:42] before the church ages ever began they
[1:08:44] were there in the fullness of pentecost
[1:08:47] is that right
[1:08:48] but you see then notice god promised i
[1:08:51] will restore not back to the ephesian
[1:08:53] age
[1:08:54] she was already a fallen woman
[1:08:56] but back to that of pentecost wherein
[1:09:00] christ himself was veiled in his
[1:09:03] fullness in a bright body
[1:09:07] god said i'll restore oh that's
[1:09:08] beautiful in it we could really dwell on
[1:09:10] that a lot i will do this i will do this
[1:09:13] thing
[1:09:16] notice in whom all the buildings fitly
[1:09:18] framed together groweth
[1:09:20] unto a holy temple in the lord in whom
[1:09:22] ye also are builded together for an
[1:09:24] habitation of god through the scripture
[1:09:28] see this is where this foundation
[1:09:32] let me just say this to you before i
[1:09:33] read this quote to you
[1:09:37] the bible says that the lamb was slain
[1:09:40] before
[1:09:41] the foundation of the world
[1:09:44] so before
[1:09:45] adam stardust molecule
[1:09:49] before it before at all the lamb was
[1:09:51] slain
[1:09:53] brother brown would say it like this in
[1:09:54] lamb's book of life
[1:09:56] when he wrote his name
[1:09:58] he wrote yours at the same time
[1:10:03] that's fitting as it is within genesis
[1:10:05] but to see
[1:10:07] that within that within this time as
[1:10:10] peter would write
[1:10:12] about he was the lamb
[1:10:14] who was for ordained
[1:10:17] who was and he ties it back in slain to
[1:10:20] be to be slain
[1:10:22] for ordained to be the lamb of god for
[1:10:24] you and i but he was manifested for us
[1:10:27] you see it wasn't just good enough that
[1:10:30] it was for ordained but it had to become
[1:10:33] manifest
[1:10:35] that's the same way in our life it's we
[1:10:38] it's not just talking about foreign
[1:10:40] nation thank god for foreign nation
[1:10:43] thank god for predestination but it
[1:10:45] takes the holy ghost to come down and
[1:10:48] inspire that in the heart to recognize
[1:10:51] and begins to deal with the life that
[1:10:53] yes there i am not the son of james and
[1:10:57] pat browning where it begins to deal
[1:10:59] with your life and call you back into
[1:11:02] what god had for ordained you to be
[1:11:04] that's not a work of a man or a church
[1:11:07] that's a work of almighty god what is it
[1:11:10] it's based on that foundation stone
[1:11:12] before there was adam stardust a
[1:11:14] molecule before the devil wherever was
[1:11:17] before the devil was ever the devil the
[1:11:20] foundation was already settled that's
[1:11:22] why when the uprising happened there in
[1:11:25] the church where some got a hold of
[1:11:27] things and started teaching that the
[1:11:29] resurrection was passed aminos and
[1:11:31] felidas remember there were many whose
[1:11:34] faith was made a shipwreck
[1:11:36] maybe high meanness of elitism you know
[1:11:38] in their day they would have made
[1:11:40] youtube videos too
[1:11:41] but you see what it is
[1:11:43] many people's faith were shipwrecked
[1:11:47] but here's what he said the foundation
[1:11:51] of god
[1:11:53] standeth assured
[1:11:56] the lord knoweth them that are his
[1:12:00] hallelujah
[1:12:02] that's kind of that's the sure
[1:12:04] foundation that we are built upon
[1:12:07] resting upon and dwells
[1:12:09] within our life this is why it begs the
[1:12:12] question being answered are you part of
[1:12:14] that true foundation has it been
[1:12:16] revealed and made alive to you
[1:12:19] you see because when it is then brother
[1:12:22] baby says in god's provided place of
[1:12:24] worship
[1:12:24] you're sealed in there you're beneath
[1:12:26] the blood you don't go out no more
[1:12:29] then what are you you're god's son in
[1:12:32] god's family sealed in by the holy
[1:12:34] spirit the devil couldn't get you if he
[1:12:36] had to for you are dead your old husband
[1:12:39] part is dead and you are buried and your
[1:12:42] life is hid in god through christ sealed
[1:12:45] by the holy ghost how's it going to get
[1:12:47] to you how's it going to get out you're
[1:12:49] there glory he said now he says now i'm
[1:12:52] just going to leave that for a few
[1:12:54] moments but he says then a new creation
[1:12:58] now think about it we don't need a
[1:13:00] building upon the old foundation brother
[1:13:03] said we need a new foundation
[1:13:05] is that right we we can't build upon
[1:13:08] that first birth because it's shaky sand
[1:13:11] a matter of fact it's under judgment
[1:13:13] already
[1:13:14] is that right but he says then a new
[1:13:17] creation not to a denomination but to
[1:13:20] the word
[1:13:22] you're a creation listen to these words
[1:13:24] you're a creation of the word
[1:13:29] you're not a creation of the church you
[1:13:32] are a creation of the word
[1:13:36] hallelujah because listen this now the
[1:13:39] foundation stone
[1:13:41] was laid in you
[1:13:44] before the foundation of the world
[1:13:47] predestinated to be sons and daughters
[1:13:50] of god the foundation stone was already
[1:13:53] laid in you
[1:13:55] what was that foundation's tone that
[1:13:58] predestinated to be a son and daughter
[1:14:01] of almighty god but once he comes he's
[1:14:06] the one that where the old foundation
[1:14:08] passes away all things are passed away
[1:14:12] and behold all things become new there
[1:14:14] now is a true foundation in your life
[1:14:18] a foundation that is not man-made
[1:14:22] but it's a foundation that comes clear
[1:14:24] back from the mind of god from eternity
[1:14:27] that foundation stone is laying in your
[1:14:29] life then with a foundation stone in
[1:14:32] your life what can be done it can build
[1:14:34] word on top of a word on top a word on
[1:14:36] top a word experience on top of
[1:14:39] experience growing into the full stature
[1:14:43] of jesus christ
[1:14:45] oh my just as when he came brother brown
[1:14:48] would go on in this quote
[1:14:51] and he said just as he came
[1:14:53] when he came let me just let me just go
[1:14:55] ahead and read it here because it just
[1:14:57] saved i don't have to paraphrase it
[1:14:59] upon this stone
[1:15:01] continuation upon this stone upon stone
[1:15:04] in each aid to vindicate that word
[1:15:06] that's coming up just exactly as jesus
[1:15:08] did in his age which is the capstone of
[1:15:11] it all in him laid every age and jesus
[1:15:14] was moses and jesus was david and jesus
[1:15:18] was the prophets is that right
[1:15:20] they all spoke of him
[1:15:22] when he walked on the road to emmaus is
[1:15:24] that right
[1:15:25] it was revealing himself in the
[1:15:28] scriptures
[1:15:29] oh my
[1:15:31] oh my
[1:15:32] we just got to go here
[1:15:33] he said look at joseph sold for almost
[1:15:35] 30 pieces of silver thrown in supposed
[1:15:38] to be dead taken out went to the right
[1:15:40] hand of pharaoh joseph was in jesus when
[1:15:43] he come
[1:15:44] he was the fullness of the kings the
[1:15:46] prophets that god had bodily rested in
[1:15:49] him he come to redeem listen to this now
[1:15:52] he come to redeem out of there a bride a
[1:15:56] masterpiece a masterpiece that says to
[1:16:00] satan when satan says days of miracles
[1:16:03] has passed there's no such a thing as
[1:16:06] these things you're talking about
[1:16:08] this masterpiece says talking about the
[1:16:10] bride get thee behind me satan see it's
[1:16:14] a masterpiece standing and guarding
[1:16:19] the foundation stone
[1:16:22] in your life
[1:16:26] that of jesus christ
[1:16:28] now
[1:16:30] just as he when he came
[1:16:34] he was the keystone
[1:16:36] to the old testament saints
[1:16:40] that then
[1:16:42] rapture resurrection
[1:16:45] followed
[1:16:47] likewise
[1:16:48] in the hour
[1:16:50] that we are living in
[1:16:52] he is not coming
[1:16:55] as
[1:16:56] as just a cornerstone but he is the
[1:16:58] capstone
[1:17:00] that that he now has become the capstone
[1:17:04] you see the work all the way through now
[1:17:07] he comes remember what the capping is
[1:17:09] the capping is declaring a finished time
[1:17:14] right the scripture said in this hour
[1:17:16] this is the finishing of the mystery of
[1:17:18] god
[1:17:19] it's declaring a finishing hour it's an
[1:17:23] hour of finishing touches
[1:17:25] it's an hour of the finish
[1:17:28] and he who was who is the author is also
[1:17:31] the finisher
[1:17:32] is that right he's here to finish to
[1:17:36] perform all that he said that he would
[1:17:38] do
[1:17:40] now when we look at that to know he was
[1:17:43] the reflection
[1:17:44] of all
[1:17:45] that was spoken of the prophets and the
[1:17:47] psalms and so forth so now
[1:17:50] inside of his bride body it is to be a
[1:17:54] reflection of him who is the bridegroom
[1:17:57] a reflection of this word remember what
[1:17:59] we read here earlier that that a
[1:18:01] christian is to be a reflection in their
[1:18:04] actions in every part of their life is
[1:18:07] to reflect almighty god
[1:18:12] i want you to think of this
[1:18:15] first corinthians 3 10
[1:18:19] let me go back to this where we read and
[1:18:22] paul said according
[1:18:23] to the grace of god which is given unto
[1:18:25] me
[1:18:28] as a wise
[1:18:30] master builder
[1:18:33] i have laid the foundation in another
[1:18:36] buildeth thereon but let every man take
[1:18:37] heed
[1:18:38] how he built their own
[1:18:41] depaul was not tooting his own horn
[1:18:44] but he knew his position
[1:18:47] are you with me
[1:18:48] and he knew being a wise master builder
[1:18:51] that it was not his wisdom
[1:18:54] it was the wisdom of god
[1:18:56] it was the same wisdom of god that would
[1:18:58] cause the earth to settle right here
[1:19:01] the same wisdom of god as it speaks in
[1:19:03] proverbs where all of these things were
[1:19:05] divided out it was the wisdom of god
[1:19:08] remember the wisdom of god
[1:19:10] it's so far above that of man
[1:19:14] but yet it's so simple
[1:19:17] and paul is speaking of the wisdom
[1:19:19] remember what what a wise is to be
[1:19:22] filled with oil
[1:19:25] so paul is saying i this is under the
[1:19:27] orchestration of the holy ghost
[1:19:30] right
[1:19:31] where israel selected another king
[1:19:34] and it took god from leading the camp
[1:19:36] and god bring preeminent in the camp now
[1:19:39] paul could say as a wise master builder
[1:19:42] where jesus christ is the is the
[1:19:45] foundation that has been laid the holy
[1:19:48] spirit has has placed himself back into
[1:19:52] his church by his word
[1:19:55] oh glory be to god
[1:19:57] and him and the church is in him now
[1:20:00] notice this and i want you i want to
[1:20:02] draw from this this last part let every
[1:20:04] man take heed how he builds their own
[1:20:08] for other foundation can no man lay then
[1:20:11] that which is laid which is jesus christ
[1:20:13] now if a man built upon this foundation
[1:20:16] gold silver precious stone wood haste
[1:20:18] double
[1:20:19] every man's work shall be made manifest
[1:20:22] for the day
[1:20:23] shall declare it because it shall be
[1:20:26] revealed by fire and the fire shall try
[1:20:28] every man's work of what sort it is
[1:20:32] you you realize that everything
[1:20:35] going back to the old testament
[1:20:36] everything that came into the camp
[1:20:39] after a spoil some cities they went in
[1:20:41] god said burn everything and don't take
[1:20:43] nothing is that right then there's other
[1:20:45] times where things could come back in
[1:20:47] the camp but it had to come through the
[1:20:48] fire because the fire was a purifier
[1:20:51] is that right and see this is the
[1:20:53] example that the holy spirit gives into
[1:20:56] our life that whatever you're adding
[1:20:59] into your life make sure it passes
[1:21:02] through the fire
[1:21:04] if it can't pass through the fire then
[1:21:06] we don't want it added to our life
[1:21:08] because it only is going to slow us down
[1:21:12] that's why paul could say lay aside
[1:21:14] every sin that does so easily set you
[1:21:16] lay aside every way it calls for then as
[1:21:19] the foundation stone is in our life to
[1:21:21] take heed to the material that's built
[1:21:24] in our life
[1:21:26] and see the material is
[1:21:28] god provides the material
[1:21:31] we don't have to go look it up we don't
[1:21:33] have to say does menards have it there's
[1:21:34] no no this is not earthly material
[1:21:37] see what's described gold silver
[1:21:39] precious thing wood hay stubble all
[1:21:41] these different things
[1:21:43] that you could look at and say my some
[1:21:45] of these things are fine and yet some of
[1:21:47] these things you might think well i
[1:21:48] don't know i don't think too much about
[1:21:49] it but when it all comes down to it
[1:21:51] every man's work
[1:21:53] will be tried by fire
[1:21:56] this is why the scripture could say
[1:21:59] that we must all appear before the
[1:22:00] judgment seat of christ not the white
[1:22:02] throne judgment
[1:22:04] but the judgment seat of christ and we
[1:22:06] will give an account
[1:22:11] don't let that scare you
[1:22:13] but let us take real inventory and say
[1:22:15] god
[1:22:17] what's being built in my life
[1:22:21] you see if any man's work listen this
[1:22:25] verse 14 if any man's work abide which
[1:22:27] he hath built thereon he shall receive a
[1:22:30] reward
[1:22:33] if any man's work shall be burned he
[1:22:34] shall suffer loss
[1:22:36] but he himself shall be saved yet so
[1:22:39] as by fire
[1:22:42] now i'm not presenting to you anything
[1:22:43] that the scripture doesn't already
[1:22:45] present
[1:22:46] but i'm saying to you that for our lives
[1:22:48] as believers
[1:22:50] brother branham lays down we see it
[1:22:53] in the scripture
[1:22:55] that those there were people who were
[1:22:57] living for the first coming
[1:23:01] they were looking for those scriptures
[1:23:04] they were looking
[1:23:06] brother brahm takes us over in the
[1:23:08] message how can overcome and he's
[1:23:09] dealing with the election those who got
[1:23:11] up on easter morning with him
[1:23:14] and then he brings it into
[1:23:16] that
[1:23:17] the overcomers and and those who go in
[1:23:20] the rapture are those who are living for
[1:23:24] his coming
[1:23:26] loving
[1:23:27] his appearing
[1:23:29] loving is coming we're in the coming of
[1:23:31] the lord
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] because before the physical coming you
[1:23:36] have to come into his fullness to draw a
[1:23:39] bride out and unite us
[1:23:41] for that time
[1:23:44] so i say it in this manner
[1:23:47] what would it be to stand there on that
[1:23:49] day
[1:23:50] and you say well brother samuel
[1:23:52] man at least i made it
[1:23:55] but there should be something more in
[1:23:57] your heart
[1:23:58] to say god
[1:24:00] upon this foundation
[1:24:03] i want to
[1:24:04] see added to my life things
[1:24:07] that glorify the foundation
[1:24:10] things that exalt this foundation in my
[1:24:13] life lord i don't want to add oh my you
[1:24:16] know god's done such a work in my life
[1:24:18] and then go become busied with the
[1:24:21] things of the world
[1:24:23] it'll never it'll never stand there on
[1:24:25] that day and you'll stand there in that
[1:24:27] place where you could have done so many
[1:24:30] other things you know you won't stand
[1:24:32] there through eternity and oh i wish i
[1:24:34] would have done that wish i but no no
[1:24:35] but to think there even in that moment
[1:24:38] we
[1:24:39] want to stand there in that place and
[1:24:41] i'm not even looking forward to that
[1:24:43] time this is my desire right now i want
[1:24:47] to be in step with him
[1:24:51] i want things added
[1:24:53] that please him
[1:24:56] and sometimes in order for things to be
[1:24:58] added well you know how it is
[1:25:01] sometimes we're sometimes we're not too
[1:25:03] good at this
[1:25:04] you buy another sweater but where's this
[1:25:06] water gonna go if you don't throw out
[1:25:08] another one
[1:25:10] right
[1:25:10] oh man these shirts five
[1:25:13] my goodness five for ten dollars well
[1:25:17] pretty soon there ain't no room in the
[1:25:19] closet
[1:25:20] oh we just put them in the basement hang
[1:25:22] them up down there and everybody's gonna
[1:25:24] just keep going keeps going keeps going
[1:25:26] in order to really add
[1:25:28] there's got to be some taken away
[1:25:31] and see the holy spirit
[1:25:33] if you just give me just a few more
[1:25:35] moments the holy spirit is such a
[1:25:37] gentleman he'll never come and just rip
[1:25:41] things out of our life
[1:25:43] but he'll deal with our hearts
[1:25:46] the bible said in hebrews 4 12 that the
[1:25:48] word of god is quick it's alive
[1:25:50] sharper than 82 edge of sword it's a
[1:25:52] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:25:55] the heart this is why paul said let
[1:25:57] every man take heed
[1:25:59] how he buildeth their own because every
[1:26:01] one of us man and woman has decisions to
[1:26:05] what material that we bring in our life
[1:26:10] god doesn't decide that for us
[1:26:12] we have that choice
[1:26:14] just like when the word is coming forth
[1:26:16] we have a choice when we're looking at
[1:26:19] the word and we can look at the word and
[1:26:21] say my that was good that was wonderful
[1:26:24] or we coming or we can see where the
[1:26:26] word will show up our weaknesses
[1:26:30] it'll show up our shortcomings
[1:26:32] that's what we come to the house of god
[1:26:34] for the bible tells us that it's now
[1:26:37] now is the time that judgment must begin
[1:26:40] in the house of god
[1:26:42] we don't come here to know or we know
[1:26:44] our strong points
[1:26:46] but we come here that there's weaknesses
[1:26:49] that the parts were that are weak that
[1:26:51] it might be made known by god but god
[1:26:53] doesn't come down and pick on us and
[1:26:55] point things out but god he shows his
[1:26:58] word and you and i
[1:27:00] are standing there looking into that
[1:27:03] word and when you're really looking into
[1:27:05] the word
[1:27:07] the word will show things also in our
[1:27:09] life
[1:27:10] even in this even listen even as the
[1:27:13] services you can look and say oh my
[1:27:15] what a tremendous service but listen
[1:27:17] friends you can still look into the word
[1:27:19] of god
[1:27:20] and you can say lord
[1:27:22] make me more like you
[1:27:28] i'm gonna have just a few more moments
[1:27:30] let me just try to tie this little
[1:27:32] little thought up
[1:27:34] as the foundation and i think this
[1:27:36] should be something that we
[1:27:39] it should be the
[1:27:41] uh
[1:27:42] the mission statement if it were
[1:27:45] of our lives
[1:27:46] as the foundation as he is the
[1:27:48] foundation
[1:27:50] he should be the basis for all things
[1:27:53] done in the church
[1:27:55] in our lives
[1:27:57] and in our home
[1:27:59] he should be the basis
[1:28:01] if there's something being done that
[1:28:03] cannot glorify him
[1:28:07] then it's things we have to say lord
[1:28:10] this is taking away
[1:28:12] rather than adding two
[1:28:14] you see anything that comes that takes
[1:28:16] away from his presence
[1:28:19] and glory and victory in your life is
[1:28:22] not really adding it doesn't matter what
[1:28:25] it looks like out there
[1:28:26] but anything that comes that takes away
[1:28:29] from that
[1:28:31] it's taking away from that reflection of
[1:28:33] his own life
[1:28:34] inside of you
[1:28:37] this is why when when the bible speaks
[1:28:42] of abraham
[1:28:44] abraham met the king of that city
[1:28:47] melchizedek
[1:28:49] and from that time on
[1:28:51] he looked for that city
[1:28:56] melchizedek was king and priest of salem
[1:28:59] is that right
[1:29:01] brother branham picks that up in the
[1:29:02] message shalom and types that in
[1:29:04] to christ being put out of the church
[1:29:07] he said notice he said he was put out of
[1:29:09] jerusalem christ put out of the church
[1:29:13] but to pick up from that moment on
[1:29:17] abraham looked for that city
[1:29:20] he knew
[1:29:22] that cities around here somewhere
[1:29:25] because i had a visitation
[1:29:27] and here's how the bible describes that
[1:29:29] city
[1:29:30] he wanted a city he was seeking after a
[1:29:34] city
[1:29:35] that had
[1:29:37] foundations
[1:29:38] he wanted things what he was seeking
[1:29:41] after were things that were of principle
[1:29:45] things that were of standard
[1:29:47] look what it did for abraham's life
[1:29:51] you see abraham's sojourning after this
[1:29:53] place of meeting melchizedek look where
[1:29:55] it comes to
[1:29:58] change of the body
[1:29:59] the promised son
[1:30:01] arrives
[1:30:03] all because of that meaning
[1:30:05] that meaning gave him a purpose in his
[1:30:08] life
[1:30:11] abraham says once you meet him like that
[1:30:12] he says then you've got a purpose for
[1:30:14] coming to church
[1:30:16] you've got a purpose then for everything
[1:30:18] you do it's not just showing up to a
[1:30:19] service you've got a purpose
[1:30:21] you're on a mission why because it is
[1:30:24] the same spirit of god that has drawn
[1:30:27] you that is now working mightily
[1:30:30] in you
[1:30:33] see we're a reflection of that city
[1:30:36] this is why paul would write
[1:30:38] in this way romans 12 1 i'm i'm coming
[1:30:41] down i'm coming down
[1:30:46] i beseech you brethren by the mercies of
[1:30:48] god that
[1:30:49] ye
[1:30:51] do what
[1:30:54] everybody else asleep
[1:30:56] that you do what
[1:30:58] present
[1:31:00] see just as the sacrament god didn't
[1:31:02] come down when the worshiper came or the
[1:31:04] high prayer or the priest came and the
[1:31:06] priest had the sacrifice they had
[1:31:07] received the sacrifice you know if paul
[1:31:09] had come and paul had sinned and there
[1:31:11] was things he had to offer a sacrifice
[1:31:13] or or maybe it was just a peace offering
[1:31:15] or a thanksgiving offering and was not a
[1:31:17] sin offering but the only way that
[1:31:19] offering could be accepted by god it had
[1:31:22] to be placed on the altar of god in the
[1:31:25] right order
[1:31:26] god didn't come down and just take it
[1:31:29] out of their hands this is what paul is
[1:31:31] speaking to our lives we we are not it's
[1:31:34] not a separate offering but now
[1:31:37] it's the offering of our own lives
[1:31:41] oh
[1:31:42] man that you present your bodies a
[1:31:46] living sacrifice holy
[1:31:49] acceptable unto god which is your
[1:31:51] reasonable service
[1:31:53] oh brother samuel you just you just lost
[1:31:56] me right there
[1:31:57] if you're under the blood
[1:32:00] god sees you as a just person
[1:32:04] god called job a just man
[1:32:08] he wasn't looking at the man he was
[1:32:10] looking at the sacrifice that job
[1:32:13] offered
[1:32:16] you with me
[1:32:18] when the bible says a just man joseph
[1:32:21] was a just man simeon was a just man it
[1:32:24] wasn't that those men not that they were
[1:32:26] bad men but that just that is recorded
[1:32:29] in scripture it speaks of their
[1:32:32] sacrifice
[1:32:35] hallelujah we're not just in our own
[1:32:38] south we are just by a just god coming
[1:32:42] by his righteousness into our lives and
[1:32:45] bringing us under the blood
[1:32:49] so it prays it gives us we're not
[1:32:51] presenting our own works we're
[1:32:53] presenting our lives even in that place
[1:32:56] to say lord
[1:32:58] change me
[1:33:00] keep changing me
[1:33:02] notice
[1:33:03] added to this here brother brown would
[1:33:05] say it like this when he would read this
[1:33:06] text he said this is notice he said the
[1:33:09] conjunction
[1:33:10] and
[1:33:11] be not conformed to this world notice
[1:33:14] it's calling us to present ourselves
[1:33:16] right
[1:33:18] holy separated acceptable unto god and
[1:33:22] be not conformed to the world
[1:33:25] under the pressures
[1:33:28] the scrutiny
[1:33:30] there's pressures that we face in this
[1:33:32] age every age just face pressures
[1:33:36] right
[1:33:38] when brother brown talks about the
[1:33:40] pressures of this last day is soft easy
[1:33:42] living it's a pressure
[1:33:45] look how the compounding of things in
[1:33:48] this hour were things that itself how
[1:33:51] things have come about in such a way you
[1:33:53] don't have to wait forever for an answer
[1:33:57] how do i fix this hose on on the on on
[1:33:59] the sink
[1:34:02] there it comes
[1:34:04] pray
[1:34:05] i might have to wait a while when i pray
[1:34:11] you see the conditions of this age
[1:34:13] would try to affect us
[1:34:18] that's why we have to be careful how
[1:34:20] what we are building
[1:34:22] upon our foundation
[1:34:24] see just like even as parents i know i
[1:34:25] don't have all the parents here but as
[1:34:27] parents remember there are principles a
[1:34:30] city that have foundation there are
[1:34:32] principles that are laid in with the
[1:34:34] children the bible said teach them and
[1:34:36] bring them up in the nurture and the
[1:34:37] admonition of the lord whatsoever you
[1:34:39] teach them now
[1:34:41] not just about what you say about what
[1:34:42] you do
[1:34:43] if it's convenient not to come to church
[1:34:46] they will carry on the same pattern
[1:34:49] are you hearing me now
[1:34:50] you see we must build upon that right
[1:34:53] foundation
[1:34:55] this is why there's things that should
[1:34:57] be no question in our life who is first
[1:35:00] we can say that god is first but our
[1:35:02] actions can speak otherwise
[1:35:06] it's okay to say i'll show me because
[1:35:08] this is god he'll come down and he'll
[1:35:11] change us
[1:35:13] are you with me
[1:35:14] many times we we stop shorting the place
[1:35:17] and we're looking at things and we say
[1:35:20] oh yeah man i made a mistake there oh
[1:35:22] yeah oh i failed there but remember
[1:35:26] confession is agreeing
[1:35:28] with what the word has said about it
[1:35:31] under the same nature of the word
[1:35:34] not just agreeing with the hell man oh
[1:35:36] yeah yeah no no no but confession is to
[1:35:39] say the same thing the word has said at
[1:35:42] the same nature of it in other words
[1:35:43] david said i hate that which thou hatest
[1:35:45] oh god
[1:35:47] that we're standing with the word
[1:35:50] though it smote us but then we can stand
[1:35:52] there and say god
[1:35:54] forgive me
[1:35:56] and let that area of my life be built
[1:35:59] let a testimony be built in that area of
[1:36:01] my life
[1:36:03] but be you transformed by the renewing
[1:36:05] of your mind that you may prove what is
[1:36:07] that good and acceptable and perfect
[1:36:08] will
[1:36:09] of almighty god
[1:36:11] brother bryan would say it like this he
[1:36:12] says
[1:36:14] he takes that scripture and he says now
[1:36:15] he says we've been saved as we are
[1:36:18] we've been filled with the holy spirit
[1:36:20] as we have
[1:36:21] now we want the mind that was in christ
[1:36:24] to be in us
[1:36:26] that we might be transformed from the
[1:36:28] natural things of life and be brought in
[1:36:30] to do the perfect will of god by
[1:36:33] transformation of god's spirit
[1:36:35] by his word
[1:36:37] so you catch
[1:36:39] it's god
[1:36:41] it's his spirit
[1:36:42] transforming us
[1:36:45] it's him bringing change
[1:36:48] into our lives
[1:36:49] it's his presence that changes even our
[1:36:52] objectives
[1:36:54] you see
[1:36:56] i told you i was going to close and i am
[1:37:02] just so much that we could just upon my
[1:37:05] heart to say
[1:37:08] sometimes
[1:37:10] let me just say this in closing here i
[1:37:12] said that before but i really am
[1:37:15] you remember what we referred to in
[1:37:16] daniel
[1:37:19] where daniel
[1:37:21] he went
[1:37:23] when the commandment was given
[1:37:26] nobody's to ask any petition of any
[1:37:28] other source
[1:37:30] except the king
[1:37:32] the bible says daniels we went through
[1:37:34] that in a few services
[1:37:35] daniel
[1:37:38] he opened his windows as he always did
[1:37:41] it wasn't daniel wasn't going to do
[1:37:43] daniel wasn't doing anything different
[1:37:45] daniel wasn't opening his window so i'm
[1:37:47] going to defy this no
[1:37:51] the bible says he went and prayed
[1:37:54] as he had done
[1:37:55] a four time
[1:37:58] this is where things really narrowed
[1:38:00] down with really the thought
[1:38:02] as the holy spirit just really just just
[1:38:04] speaking to my heart here
[1:38:07] daniel
[1:38:10] he went about
[1:38:11] and there were things unaltered that he
[1:38:13] did
[1:38:14] his prayer life was unaltered
[1:38:17] no doubt it was challenged it was
[1:38:19] challenged
[1:38:22] now there's things that daniel
[1:38:25] he was unaltered he continued on
[1:38:28] i want to bring it down to our lives
[1:38:32] because in our lives we recognize that
[1:38:34] we are
[1:38:35] being changed
[1:38:37] by an unchanging god
[1:38:40] is him he's immutable in his nature he's
[1:38:43] immutable in his way in other words he
[1:38:46] doesn't change
[1:38:49] he comes to change us and transform
[1:38:52] our lives
[1:38:55] but these are things where we have to
[1:38:57] watch very carefully
[1:38:59] peter would say it like this
[1:39:03] gird up the loins of your mind be sober
[1:39:06] and hope to the end for the grace that
[1:39:07] is to be brought unto you at the
[1:39:09] revelation of jesus christ
[1:39:11] as obedient children
[1:39:13] not fashioning yourselves
[1:39:15] according
[1:39:17] to the former lusts
[1:39:20] in your ignorance
[1:39:21] but as he which hath called you as holy
[1:39:23] so be holy in all manner of conversation
[1:39:25] because it is written be holy
[1:39:27] for i am holy
[1:39:30] you see there's things that
[1:39:32] you can look at and even
[1:39:34] sometimes the process of time and life
[1:39:37] you go through
[1:39:39] certain things
[1:39:40] as we said before with
[1:39:42] the pressures of the age and the
[1:39:44] pressures of the hour
[1:39:46] i wonder how many of us could say lord
[1:39:50] i need i need i need more patience
[1:39:55] it's not the work
[1:39:57] has not been altered in our life
[1:40:00] but there's other things from the
[1:40:02] pressures of life
[1:40:04] that worked on us
[1:40:07] to alter us
[1:40:10] not as
[1:40:11] pressures of life can work on you
[1:40:14] when you say as far as the foundation
[1:40:17] stone
[1:40:17] you're still a believer i'm talking
[1:40:19] about with the work of god in your life
[1:40:22] where you know your life is under the
[1:40:24] blood
[1:40:25] but remember there's things that can
[1:40:27] come into your life
[1:40:32] that can alter
[1:40:34] the ways you think and the way you go
[1:40:36] about things this is why paul said
[1:40:39] let no root of bitterness
[1:40:42] dwell in you
[1:40:44] cast out all malice showing there are
[1:40:47] things that can come into a life not in
[1:40:49] your soul when you've been sealed
[1:40:51] are you hearing me
[1:40:52] not in your soul
[1:40:55] but in your spirit
[1:40:58] and that's where you have to look we all
[1:41:01] all of us are testing and trial no
[1:41:02] matter what season of life no matter
[1:41:04] what the things that's all around us
[1:41:07] but it comes into a place
[1:41:09] to where we have to have in our own
[1:41:11] lives evaluating
[1:41:13] god
[1:41:15] has there been things in my life that's
[1:41:17] been altered
[1:41:19] that's not allowing the reflection
[1:41:21] of the foundation stone
[1:41:24] to reflect out
[1:41:26] and if there is
[1:41:27] let the fire of god right now
[1:41:30] come and consume that i just say lord
[1:41:33] consume it lord
[1:41:35] consume me lord god our god is a
[1:41:37] consuming fire consume that see this is
[1:41:40] where paul could say and i i think this
[1:41:42] is so fitting for the time
[1:41:45] that we're in
[1:41:47] i've closed up everything i have here
[1:41:52] forgetting
[1:41:53] those things
[1:41:55] which are behind me
[1:41:58] we're coming into a new year
[1:42:01] rod terry's tomorrow night strikes 12
[1:42:04] it's a new year
[1:42:07] right
[1:42:08] there's a lot of things that even as
[1:42:09] brother branham will stand and you hear
[1:42:11] it you hear brother branham will
[1:42:12] approach it in message after message
[1:42:15] and you can look and brother brown would
[1:42:16] ask god forgive me for the mistakes and
[1:42:19] failures of this past year
[1:42:22] because you can't go anywhere
[1:42:25] still holding
[1:42:26] the mistakes and failures of the
[1:42:29] previous year
[1:42:30] well brother samuel why would i have
[1:42:32] mistakes and failures
[1:42:35] well a person that doesn't do nothing
[1:42:38] doesn't make no mistakes
[1:42:41] but it's a person who's doing something
[1:42:43] who makes mistakes
[1:42:45] right
[1:42:46] god knows that this is how he could even
[1:42:48] speak to joshua as i was with moses so
[1:42:50] will i be with thee but in order to
[1:42:52] forget those things paul was letting it
[1:42:54] be known to us as believers we have an
[1:42:57] access
[1:42:59] to the blood of jesus christ
[1:43:03] and when we stand and confess
[1:43:06] our confessing
[1:43:08] lord
[1:43:09] what the word is showing up in my life
[1:43:12] i want to be changed lord
[1:43:15] i want to be changed
[1:43:18] and god isn't god isn't coming to where
[1:43:20] oh brother samuel i'll be this person
[1:43:22] i'll never have a bad thought i'll never
[1:43:23] make that's not what it is
[1:43:26] it's god coming
[1:43:27] to bring
[1:43:29] a change in our life to where more of us
[1:43:33] is gone
[1:43:35] and he has as brother brown describes it
[1:43:37] in the message contest that he would
[1:43:39] have more preeminence in our life
[1:43:42] in other words there's decisions every
[1:43:44] one of us have made at times and we'd
[1:43:46] want to look back and say phew wish i'd
[1:43:49] had some more input on that one
[1:43:51] right wish i'd thought that one through
[1:43:53] a little bit more but preeminence more
[1:43:55] of his preeminence in our life
[1:43:58] then it's more of his influence and
[1:43:59] we're looking more to him through the
[1:44:02] things that we've learned his grace has
[1:44:04] brought us through for all things work
[1:44:07] together for the good
[1:44:09] and we can look at that and forget those
[1:44:12] things that are behind us and reach
[1:44:15] reach
[1:44:16] for the things before
[1:44:17] see paul was paul was letting him know
[1:44:19] the power
[1:44:20] of the blood of jesus christ to loosen
[1:44:23] that god doesn't hold anything over our
[1:44:24] head but the gospel comes
[1:44:26] it brings reflection on our life
[1:44:28] evaluation where there's things that you
[1:44:29] and i we want to be men and women in
[1:44:31] this hour that can stand and we want the
[1:44:33] word preached to us we want to we want
[1:44:36] that word to come down and if there's
[1:44:37] things in our life that's not right on
[1:44:39] we want the word to deal with that life
[1:44:41] because when it's all said and done
[1:44:43] that's what's going to matter when we
[1:44:45] stand there that day
[1:44:47] and if there's something that's that's
[1:44:48] out of line now listen god doesn't hold
[1:44:50] anything overhead and say guess guess no
[1:44:52] no
[1:44:53] here's the simplicity of it
[1:44:56] maybe i need to just walk off the
[1:44:58] platform
[1:45:03] but here's the scriptures
[1:45:05] and one lord willing maybe if the lord
[1:45:07] allows it to pick it up next week
[1:45:09] the background that brother braham takes
[1:45:11] is the background
[1:45:12] of the rapture
[1:45:15] one thing
[1:45:16] have i desired
[1:45:19] that thing
[1:45:21] will i seek after
[1:45:23] that i may dwell in the house
[1:45:26] of the lord
[1:45:28] to be behold
[1:45:30] his beauty
[1:45:32] to inquire at his temple you catch those
[1:45:35] two words to behold means
[1:45:37] you're fixed on something
[1:45:40] you're fixed on him
[1:45:42] and what you're seeing
[1:45:44] causes you now to inquire
[1:45:47] of him
[1:45:50] oh
[1:45:52] what a privilege
[1:45:55] to be
[1:45:56] in jesus christ
[1:45:59] what a privilege to be
[1:46:01] in this foundation
[1:46:04] what a privilege it is
[1:46:07] that the holy spirit
[1:46:09] would deal with our hearts to mold us
[1:46:13] to shape us
[1:46:14] and to call to you and i and say
[1:46:17] look at this
[1:46:18] look at this and you say yes lord
[1:46:22] and by his transforming power
[1:46:24] he brings change in our life
[1:46:28] let's pray
[1:46:32] i wonder if as we go to the war lord in
[1:46:34] prayer if we just
[1:46:35] just every one of us if we just couldn't
[1:46:38] as we think about this new year coming
[1:46:40] in and
[1:46:40] i think about this thought
[1:46:42] tonight
[1:46:44] i wonder if we just couldn't each and
[1:46:46] every one of us just agree together and
[1:46:48] say oh god
[1:46:50] in this coming year
[1:46:52] let me be a better christian
[1:46:55] let me be a better
[1:46:57] soldier
[1:46:58] let me be a better witness
[1:47:01] brother adam would pray in one place of
[1:47:03] the message god in this coming year keep
[1:47:05] all envy and malice keep sickness from
[1:47:08] us keep these things from us
[1:47:15] heavenly father
[1:47:19] lord jesus as we look into your word
[1:47:23] how thankful we are lord
[1:47:27] for a true foundation
[1:47:30] thankful god
[1:47:32] by the grace of god we are a part of
[1:47:34] that foundation
[1:47:37] lord the holy spirit
[1:47:39] coming lord
[1:47:41] upon that
[1:47:43] that foundation stone lord that was
[1:47:46] placed in our life
[1:47:47] [Music]
[1:47:49] that lord our whole life would be based
[1:47:51] upon that
[1:47:53] experience
[1:47:54] of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:47:58] and upon that foundation
[1:48:00] there would be building
[1:48:02] growing as peter would write under
[1:48:05] inspiration
[1:48:07] add to your faith virtue
[1:48:10] add to your
[1:48:12] virtue
[1:48:13] knowledge
[1:48:14] add to your knowledge patience
[1:48:17] and adding to lord
[1:48:19] oh god
[1:48:21] as we look to you tonight lord
[1:48:24] i pray that god throughout this building
[1:48:28] and we look in this coming year
[1:48:31] lord we we want to stand in this moment
[1:48:34] and should you tarry in coming services
[1:48:36] and lord allow the word to examine our
[1:48:39] lives oh god
[1:48:40] lord your desire oh god
[1:48:44] is to lord work and move in our lives
[1:48:46] even in a greater way lord god
[1:48:50] father
[1:48:52] may we be honest
[1:48:54] before you
[1:48:57] may we lord
[1:48:58] lord inviting the holy spirit who's
[1:49:01] speaking to us
[1:49:02] to go to work the lord in our life
[1:49:05] sometimes lord situations or things that
[1:49:08] we are running from are the very
[1:49:10] situations that you
[1:49:12] have ordained to use as a tool
[1:49:16] to mold us
[1:49:18] and shape us
[1:49:21] help us lord
[1:49:24] for god every prophet and down through
[1:49:26] the scriptures they never wanted to go
[1:49:27] to those burning deserts
[1:49:30] but you took them into those places
[1:49:32] in order to mold them
[1:49:34] shape them
[1:49:35] and show them your glory
[1:49:38] they would come out of those places
[1:49:39] stronger than when they went in lord
[1:49:43] father through the tests and trials of
[1:49:45] life
[1:49:46] lord as we're setting and the word of
[1:49:48] god as lord being ministered to our
[1:49:51] hearts
[1:49:52] we don't want to be
[1:49:54] just hearers of the word
[1:49:56] we want to be doers lord
[1:50:00] yielding of our lives
[1:50:03] lord submitting of our lives lord it's
[1:50:06] the desire in our hearts lord
[1:50:08] that we want all
[1:50:10] of you we want the lord to please you
[1:50:13] lord in every way
[1:50:15] i pray tonight oh god that even lord if
[1:50:19] you should tarry as we would face the
[1:50:21] oncoming year
[1:50:22] of 2022
[1:50:25] i'm sure lord that there are things
