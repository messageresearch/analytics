[38:32] you Lord
[38:33] granite this morning father we pray in
[38:36] Jesus name Amen amen revelations chapter
[38:40] 12 verse 1 and there appeared a great
[38:45] wonder in heaven a woman clothed with
[38:48] the Sun and the moon under her feet and
[38:50] upon her head a crown of twelve stars
[38:54] and she being the child cried travailing
[38:57] in birth and pained to be delivered and
[39:02] there appeared another wonder in heaven
[39:03] and behold a great red dragon having
[39:06] seven heads and ten horns and seven
[39:08] Crown's upon his heads and his tail drew
[39:12] the third part of the stars of heaven
[39:14] and did cast them to the earth and the
[39:18] dragon stood before the woman which was
[39:20] ready to be delivered for to devour her
[39:23] child as soon as it was born and she
[39:26] brought forth a man child who was to
[39:29] rule all nations with a rod of iron and
[39:31] her child was caught up unto God and to
[39:35] his throne amen that's speaking of of
[39:38] Israel there we know the man child to be
[39:41] Jesus Christ is that right
[39:45] verse 6 and the woman fled into the
[39:49] wilderness where she hath a place
[39:52] prepared of God that they should feed
[39:55] her there a thousand two hundred and
[39:59] threescore days and there was war in
[40:02] heaven Michael and his angels fought
[40:04] against the Dragon and the dragon fought
[40:08] and his angels
[40:09] and prevailed not neither was their
[40:13] place found any more in heaven and the
[40:18] Great Dragon was cast out that old
[40:20] serpent called the devil and Satan which
[40:23] deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[40:26] out into the earth and his angels were
[40:28] cast out with him and I heard a loud
[40:31] voice saying in heaven now is come
[40:32] salvation and strength and the Kingdom
[40:34] of our God and the power of his Christ
[40:37] for the accuser of our brethren is cast
[40:39] down which accused them before our God
[40:42] day and night and they overcame him by
[40:45] the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
[40:48] their testimony and they loved not their
[40:51] lives unto the death amen
[40:59] may God bless you bless the reading of
[41:00] his word as you're being seated notice
[41:09] in the opening here of the scriptures
[41:12] you keep reading in the scriptures here
[41:15] this is the woman a woman the woman we
[41:18] can keep going all the way down through
[41:20] the chapter you have Israel that is
[41:23] spoken of here the elect of Israel that
[41:28] was waiting on the promise of the
[41:30] Messiah to come which was the Lord Jesus
[41:34] Christ then you have where the scripture
[41:38] picks up here a woman she fled into the
[41:41] wilderness where she had a place
[41:42] prepared of God for her to feed and be
[41:45] nourished that speaks of the elect
[41:48] Church of the Living God the Gentile
[41:51] church then you have here in another
[41:55] place where it would go on further into
[41:57] the scriptures and it picks up Israel
[42:00] again then it picks up also the remnant
[42:03] those that do not have the life of the
[42:07] Holy Ghost but they in the time of the
[42:11] tribulation they'll have to give their
[42:13] lives for what they believe but in the
[42:16] midst of this here I just my heart just
[42:19] very
[42:21] drawn to a point here I don't know how
[42:26] many weeks ago it was and but at any
[42:29] rate I was drawn to a point here I begin
[42:32] to look into this scripture in verse 6
[42:36] and the woman fled into the wilderness
[42:39] where she hath a place prepared of God
[42:42] that they should feed her there a
[42:45] thousand two hundred and threescore days
[42:47] as believers we recognize that this
[42:54] precious book that we hold in our hands
[42:57] and that we read from is not just an
[43:01] account of history but it's a book of
[43:05] prophecy and as believers these are not
[43:10] stories but these are events that what
[43:14] God has done before he will also do
[43:18] again there are times that God has
[43:21] chosen to speak prophetically of things
[43:26] that were and are to come there's other
[43:29] times that God has spoken in conjunction
[43:33] with what has been spoken through the
[43:35] prophets where God would speak through
[43:38] the lives of individuals in prophecy of
[43:42] what also was to come we find that
[43:46] within the scriptures as Peter was moved
[43:49] by the Spirit of God where he says that
[43:51] no scripture is of a private
[43:55] interpretation isolated without him
[43:58] being able to dovetail with the rest we
[44:01] understand that you know scripture can
[44:04] be taken here there but yet it must line
[44:07] up and always highlight Jesus Christ if
[44:12] it's truly in the thought in which it
[44:15] was given in it will never ever take
[44:18] away nor will it add to what was already
[44:21] said but it will just bring forth the
[44:24] real true reality of the Lord Jesus
[44:27] Christ because you know it takes it the
[44:30] only way that error is ever known as
[44:33] and exposed it there must be truth to
[44:37] expose the error and there must be truth
[44:40] that is able to repel error from moving
[44:43] any further and when I look at this as
[44:46] my heart was just taken within this this
[44:49] this scripture and just looking at it
[44:51] you're aware that I find it just quite
[44:56] fitting but God knows what he's doing
[44:58] I come across the statement here where
[45:01] brother Branham is dealing with this
[45:03] nation and what day that we're coming
[45:05] upon here we're coming upon the Lord
[45:07] willing this coming Thursday would be
[45:09] Thanksgiving Day and brother Branham
[45:13] makes this statement regarding it in
[45:15] from the beginning it wasn't so in 1959
[45:17] and he says concerning this day he says
[45:21] it's was set aside for our pilgrim
[45:24] forefathers to give things for what that
[45:28] he had done for them the blessings that
[45:32] he had given to them and the crops that
[45:34] they had been able to bring forth
[45:36] he said it's one real American day and
[45:40] he goes on all the other days like st.
[45:42] Patrick's and so forth come from across
[45:44] the seas but this is an American holiday
[45:48] Thanksgiving Day he goes on to mention
[45:51] and give an admonition of what should be
[45:56] done by those who were there within that
[45:59] meeting as Thanksgiving Day was
[46:02] approaching he said it would be good for
[46:04] you he says to get your family together
[46:07] and to enter take God's Word and to tell
[46:11] your children about this tell them that
[46:13] this nation was built upon such as that
[46:16] that our forefathers who fought to bring
[46:19] this freedom to us and left the other
[46:21] country so that we could have freedom of
[46:24] worship freedom of speech and freedom of
[46:27] press and so forth and we're thankful
[46:30] yet for it we don't know how long it
[46:33] will last that way but I say this long
[46:36] may our lands be bright with freedoms
[46:38] Holy Light protect us by thy might Great
[46:42] God our King
[46:45] I don't bring this this morning with the
[46:52] intent that Thanksgiving is coming up if
[46:55] this inspiration had dropped in the
[46:57] middle of June I would have preached it
[46:59] in June because it's something to be
[47:01] preached no matter what day of the year
[47:03] we're in of what this think and it would
[47:24] be a time Wow V not just something that
[47:50] is on a day but how that we live our
[47:53] lives when you look at this in the
[47:55] scriptures of revelations 12 verse 5 you
[47:59] know sometimes there's a great space of
[48:02] time that takes place between scriptures
[48:05] being fulfilled you see that in the life
[48:08] of the Lord Jesus when you read the
[48:09] Gospels in the time of the resurrection
[48:11] you'll find this account in mark this
[48:14] account in Luke this and John this in
[48:16] Matthew in all the events there's none
[48:17] that are contradicting but yet every one
[48:22] of them has a sequence of events that
[48:25] are divinely placed by God in a direct
[48:28] order there are things that were being
[48:30] fulfilled in throughout the resurrection
[48:33] of the Lord Jesus we find here in verse
[48:36] 5 of Revelations 12 of where you find
[48:40] the Church of the Living God who was
[48:42] waiting on the promise of the Messiah
[48:45] remember brother Branham puts it like
[48:47] this and the message birth pains it was
[48:49] a small remnant of believers who were
[48:53] actually waiting on the Messiah to come
[48:56] brother Bream actually names them off
[48:59] few believed on the massive amount it
[49:01] was a few believers he said at church
[49:05] that was waiting on this promise was a
[49:07] small little church so when it comes
[49:12] down to it we know that the promise of
[49:14] the Messiah of how that God would come
[49:17] and we find that within this year that
[49:20] this manchild that was to come forth
[49:22] here the Lord Jesus this was to rule all
[49:25] nations with a rod of iron and her child
[49:28] was caught up unto God and to his throne
[49:30] and then we find quite a space of time
[49:33] between verse 5 and verse 6 because
[49:36] after this you find after her here that
[49:39] he is caught up the sacrifice remember
[49:42] the Holy Ghost is sent back down to the
[49:44] people the promise the very reason of
[49:47] the Messiah coming in order to bring
[49:49] Redemption that his life might come back
[49:51] we find that God begins to move and
[49:54] remember the scripture says that this
[49:56] gospel shall be preached first beginning
[50:00] at Jerusalem and then unto the uttermost
[50:02] parts of Judea we find that how that the
[50:06] word itself you know civilization we
[50:09] recognize that civilization even as we
[50:12] know it now civilization is not of God
[50:14] civilizations of the devil we recognize
[50:17] within that discernment of what was the
[50:20] very purpose when you think of it God
[50:22] had already set a civilization upon this
[50:25] earth mat of by his word but then when
[50:28] Cain himself after he slew Abel remember
[50:31] he he went out from the presence of God
[50:34] and as soon as he goes out from the
[50:36] presence of God he begins to build a
[50:39] city and civilization begins to come
[50:42] forth from there it was there the
[50:44] purpose of it it was not something that
[50:46] was ordained of God but yet God Himself
[50:50] will once again have a civilization upon
[50:53] this earth but it will not be a man-made
[50:55] civilization
[50:56] it's a civilization of faith whereby it
[51:00] actually begins in the heart of the
[51:03] believer through him by the new birth
[51:05] and that new birth can never be
[51:07] overthrown that Satan can never prevail
[51:10] against the kingdom
[51:12] God once it is moved within the heart he
[51:15] can come against the vessel in whom it
[51:16] is veiled in he can come against that
[51:18] but he can never ever overthrow that
[51:22] revelation in the heart of the believer
[51:24] you see Satan was a loser in heaven and
[51:27] he's going to be a loser on earth are
[51:30] you with me today there is no there is
[51:33] no all of a sudden reversing of the
[51:35] story and he's going to become a winner
[51:37] but Satan himself God has allowed even
[51:41] all of this to take place that the
[51:43] purpose of God all the great attributes
[51:45] of God may begin to come forth and you
[51:47] find how that when the civilization
[51:50] would actually begin to progress
[51:52] civilization follows that of the Sun it
[51:55] follows that of the light moving from
[51:57] the east unto the west find of how there
[52:00] was such a high concentration right
[52:02] there within the East but then how that
[52:04] the word itself would begin to move
[52:06] remember here it was within the time of
[52:09] Asia Asia Minor you find it moving there
[52:12] across the Mediterranean then you find
[52:14] the word moving from the meditator from
[52:16] across the Mediterranean then moving
[52:17] into Germany then here the word is there
[52:20] in Germany begins to strike Luther's
[52:22] heart and then from that and Luther then
[52:24] it moves across the English Channel and
[52:26] then from the English Channel it makes
[52:28] its way to this scripture right here a
[52:31] land a place that's prepared by God now
[52:36] watch this this is God overseeing this
[52:39] you won't find this in the history books
[52:41] you won't find this in secularism you'll
[52:43] find a lot of other things but God this
[52:46] this place that you and I live in right
[52:49] now on top of this land it was a place
[52:51] prepared by God reserved for a work and
[52:55] a finishing up in this hour now watch
[52:59] this here in verse 6 and the woman fled
[53:02] into the wilderness now this is very
[53:04] this is very a tremendous did awfully no
[53:08] not all but the woman fled who's the
[53:10] woman the elect the elect fled and left
[53:14] the elect go with the light is that
[53:17] right but true Lutheran's who might have
[53:19] still been around when Wesley begin to
[53:22] break forth with sanctification
[53:23] they moved on with the lights because
[53:26] what it was they weren't tied so they
[53:29] weren't tied to words they had met Jesus
[53:32] Christ you see their life they they knew
[53:35] that pillar fire and they moved on it
[53:36] was the same way with those a true
[53:38] Methodists that would move on when the
[53:40] gifts the restoration of gifts would
[53:42] begin to take place here and fall and
[53:45] the Spirit of God began to manifest that
[53:47] the same way it would be true
[53:49] Pentecostals that would then move on in
[53:51] in the advancement of the light within
[53:53] this hour so within this the woman fled
[53:56] into the wilderness where she hath a
[53:58] place prepared of God that they should
[54:01] feed her there notice the purpose of it
[54:03] she fled to this wilderness a place that
[54:07] was prepared of God for what reason so
[54:11] that she could have a better living so
[54:13] that she could just do whatever she
[54:14] wanted to do not so it was a place that
[54:18] she might be fed of God now think of
[54:23] this here when you look at it brother
[54:25] Branham puts it like this and I didn't
[54:26] include these I'm just going to refer to
[54:28] these throughout brother Graham says
[54:29] from the persecution of the church and
[54:31] all through those dark ages that people
[54:34] come over here what is America America
[54:37] was established at Plymouth Rock for one
[54:40] purpose freedom of religion and the
[54:43] Bible said that she fled from the dragon
[54:46] and had a place prepared in what now
[54:49] what's the dragon who was the dragon
[54:51] Rome she fled from the face of the
[54:56] serpent she fled from that Roman system
[55:00] that had been encroaching and kept
[55:02] moving along as light would come open
[55:05] what what what happened after light and
[55:07] word and truth would be revealed after
[55:10] so long a time remember there were
[55:12] fallen angels that would get ride around
[55:15] there and then they would begin to
[55:17] influence and you would have people who
[55:20] didn't meet the God that Luther met they
[55:23] didn't meet the God that Wesley met
[55:25] people who did not meet the same God
[55:27] that Williams Seymour and many of those
[55:29] out there in Azusa Street and the same
[55:32] thing applies to us in our messy
[55:34] it must be a meeting with the Living God
[55:36] not enough just to know about the truth
[55:39] but it must meet face to face with God
[55:42] because he's the one you got to know his
[55:45] voice now to think about this what was
[55:48] America he said when she come here she
[55:51] was nourished for a limited time a time
[55:54] time of dividing just about a hundred
[55:56] and sixty-five or seventy years where
[55:58] she had a place prepared you know it's
[56:01] amazing to me even in just a little bit
[56:03] of countries that I've been able to
[56:04] travel in it's amazing to me the
[56:06] advancement in this in this in this
[56:08] country right here compared to other
[56:10] places I've been it is absolutely
[56:12] incredible
[56:14] how that this advancement would be
[56:15] within here and I know there's all kinds
[56:17] of sin I know that it that sin is just
[56:19] heaped up but to think within just a
[56:22] little bit of time of how much has has
[56:25] blossom forth I'll talk about a lot of
[56:27] the things of infrastructure and roads
[56:29] things you and I just take for granted
[56:31] but I'll tell you what in other
[56:32] countries they'd like to be able to have
[56:34] roads like you and I have even if it's a
[56:36] road that would be a country road with
[56:38] chip and seal you understand what I'm
[56:40] saying
[56:41] but you see within it notice the
[56:43] scripture depicts this nation our nation
[56:46] as something of very young as a lamb a
[56:49] lamb rising up out of the land think
[56:52] about it here when we look at the
[56:54] pilgrims when they came they came here
[56:56] it was in the early 1600s there had
[56:58] already been others that had already
[57:00] visited here already been settlements
[57:03] and different things that had set up
[57:04] here and to think just within this time
[57:07] a Declaration of Independence in 1776
[57:10] and you know look from this time 1776 to
[57:14] 1956 and 1956 is when the Spirit of God
[57:18] would call the Prophet in Billy Graham
[57:21] was called in Oral Roberts was called in
[57:23] they did not understand why they were
[57:25] being called back here to America and
[57:28] canceling all of their revivals across
[57:31] the country it's because that God was
[57:33] going to give a final reckoning and
[57:36] invitation whereby America would either
[57:38] accept the gospel or she would reject it
[57:41] and we know she rejected it in 1956 so
[57:45] too
[57:45] think of it she wasn't even 200 years
[57:47] old when she rejected the gospel of
[57:50] Jesus Christ you know what she did she
[57:52] rejected the very reason that she was
[57:56] here turn right around and rejected it
[58:00] this place was a place prepared by God a
[58:04] place whereby that he might feed his
[58:08] people we're not talking about natural
[58:10] grain we're talking about the freedom to
[58:13] hear the Word of God the Word of God
[58:15] that'll change a lot sustain a life it
[58:18] puts an anchor and a divine connection
[58:20] between God and His creation that they
[58:23] can be fed that their dependency is not
[58:26] upon a church upon a man but their
[58:28] dependency is upon the Living Word of
[58:31] God these were people who believed that
[58:33] man shall not live by bread alone but by
[58:36] every word that proceedeth out of the
[58:39] mouth of God I ask you who put that
[58:41] burden in their heart I'll tell you who
[58:43] put that burden in the heart the same
[58:45] God who put the burden in Abraham's
[58:47] heart to be a pilgrim and leave his land
[58:49] the same God who put the burden in
[58:52] Luthor's heart to throw down that
[58:53] Eucharist and everything else and say
[58:56] that's not the body of my Lord that same
[58:58] burden that pulsates in your heart this
[59:01] morning to know there is a land beyond
[59:04] the river the same God the same God now
[59:10] think of this here the rejection of the
[59:13] gospel in 1956 my and then another
[59:23] important event which I don't know if
[59:25] I'll get to this morning but the
[59:27] election of President Kennedy in 1960 of
[59:31] which the prophet called the worst
[59:33] mistake this nation ever made him glory
[59:38] be to God now watch here brother BAM
[59:45] goes on and says now the woman fled he's
[59:47] quoting the scripture the woman fled
[59:49] into the wilderness where she had a
[59:51] place prepared of God God prepared
[59:55] America for freedom of religion
[59:58] that she would be fed there a thousand
[1:00:01] two hundred and threescore days bloom M
[1:00:05] goes on to pick it up in Jezebel
[1:00:07] religion the parallel he said oh it's
[1:00:10] striking the parallel between Israel of
[1:00:13] the Old Testament and America now both
[1:00:16] of them were great nations both of them
[1:00:19] had been founded and people had come
[1:00:21] here because of religious persecutions
[1:00:27] think of how that Israel with Pharaoh
[1:00:29] they were in bondage they had been
[1:00:33] deprived of privilege they had become
[1:00:35] slaves watch this now but he said God
[1:00:38] made them a promise in the Bible what
[1:00:41] was Israel going by a promise in the
[1:00:44] Bible Moses did not walk down there was
[1:00:49] something that had been he had hatched
[1:00:50] out no it would have never worked come
[1:00:54] on friends it had been like leading a
[1:00:55] bunch of people out and they'd have been
[1:00:57] drinking kool-aid and all and would have
[1:00:59] come up died dead you understand if this
[1:01:01] was not something that was hatched up it
[1:01:03] was the Spirit of God who remembered the
[1:01:06] promise that he made to Abraham God does
[1:01:11] not forget his promises he does not
[1:01:15] forget his word but God will remember
[1:01:18] his word in the season though it might
[1:01:21] seem like he's forgotten but God is
[1:01:24] always right on time you see what God
[1:01:29] had to wait for is for the people who
[1:01:32] were dwelling in that land known as the
[1:01:35] amorite God had to wait to the kaepa
[1:01:37] fool you see Israel was looking at one
[1:01:40] thing Moses was looking at one thing but
[1:01:43] there's a part of the scripture that
[1:01:45] could not swing it into full into full
[1:01:48] manifestation because they were waiting
[1:01:50] on that cup of iniquity to fill up in
[1:01:53] order for there to be a release from
[1:01:56] Egypt you see every part of the prophecy
[1:01:59] of God has so many calls within it so
[1:02:02] many little parts of that will and
[1:02:03] everything must move and synchronized
[1:02:06] with in time nothing can get out of time
[1:02:09] but God will see to it that every
[1:02:11] stays in time and here's the wonderful
[1:02:13] thing just as much as God sees to it
[1:02:16] that the prophecy stays inside if you
[1:02:18] and I are a part of that word my brother
[1:02:20] and sister the same Holy Spirit that is
[1:02:23] manifesting that prophecy as we being a
[1:02:26] part of the word oh my God will see to
[1:02:29] it we do not miss what we need to be
[1:02:32] here any else aren't you glad about that
[1:02:37] now watch this God and made them a
[1:02:39] promise in the Bible or in his word and
[1:02:42] by his prophets that he give them a land
[1:02:44] and they'd come into this land and drove
[1:02:48] back the occupants of that land and had
[1:02:50] possessed their inheritance let me pause
[1:02:52] here just for a moment you see a lot of
[1:02:54] the things I don't dabble a whole lot in
[1:02:56] secularism
[1:02:57] I don't even doubt anything entertain
[1:02:58] myself with the politics and all the
[1:03:00] stuff of this world you know it's like
[1:03:01] right now young people you go to college
[1:03:03] plug your ears and just say God give me
[1:03:05] what I need so I get my certificate and
[1:03:07] be able to get the job if you're going
[1:03:09] there because I'll tell you right now
[1:03:11] some of the greatest reprobates are the
[1:03:13] professors in those places some of them
[1:03:15] they have no idea about what is the real
[1:03:18] foundation and the real principle of
[1:03:20] these things they want to paint
[1:03:21] everything like oh it's oppression
[1:03:24] whoever told them that come on somebody
[1:03:27] we're talking about a spirit what man
[1:03:31] what has never talked about is how one
[1:03:32] tribe would dominate another tribe come
[1:03:35] on somebody I stood right there brother
[1:03:38] worm you know what I'm talking about I
[1:03:39] stood right there in the cape coast
[1:03:40] castle one thing in our history book
[1:03:42] will tell us is how the white man went
[1:03:44] into Africa and chased down all and
[1:03:46] chased down all the black men that
[1:03:48] simply is not true I stood right there
[1:03:50] in the cape coast castle and I even
[1:03:52] after the guide has mentioned it I asked
[1:03:55] him I said sir I want to ask you
[1:03:56] something again right here there's a lot
[1:03:58] of heinous things where there were
[1:03:59] English men who were there in that
[1:04:01] fortress but who brought that who
[1:04:04] brought the Africans those here who
[1:04:06] brought them in here some of their own
[1:04:08] Chiefs and chiefs from other places and
[1:04:12] sold them for tobacco sold them for
[1:04:15] liquor you don't tell my brother Michael
[1:04:17] those things stand right there in the
[1:04:18] castle's that'll never be roped in the
[1:04:21] history books
[1:04:22] you know why because if it's get back
[1:04:25] then spirits continue to move what
[1:04:27] spirit you're talking about the Roman
[1:04:29] Catholic spirit that can keep people
[1:04:32] focused off of the real thing it keeps
[1:04:37] them to where they're fighting one
[1:04:38] another instead of being focused on
[1:04:40] Jesus
[1:04:41] you see that's Satan's objective if he
[1:04:45] can divide the kingdom he can conquer it
[1:04:48] come on somebody oh my both Sammy this
[1:04:52] ain't a history course I know it's not
[1:04:53] but the Bible is a history book now look
[1:04:56] at this here they come into a land drove
[1:04:58] back the in occupants of that land and
[1:05:00] had possessed their inheritance for God
[1:05:02] had a purpose of doing that
[1:05:05] oh brother man said so is this great
[1:05:07] nation of ours we come here and on
[1:05:10] Plymouth Rock this nation was founded on
[1:05:13] freedom of religion because our
[1:05:15] forefathers had fled Roman persecution
[1:05:18] of the modern Jezebel system and had
[1:05:22] come up and stood many great
[1:05:24] persecutions and martyrdom under the
[1:05:27] false system of Jezebel oh he said God
[1:05:29] had made the promise to the church to
[1:05:32] the woman to come into this country
[1:05:35] God had a place a place that the woman
[1:05:41] the church the elect could flee to
[1:05:44] aren't you glad Satan here that Roman
[1:05:47] system bringing persecution oh it was
[1:05:51] she was trying to snuff everything out
[1:05:52] but about that time as it stepped on you
[1:05:55] notice there were times God allowed them
[1:05:57] to stand right there in the face of it I
[1:05:59] think of William Tyndale I think of John
[1:06:01] house
[1:06:02] I think of mighty men of God that stood
[1:06:04] there in labor to be able to bring this
[1:06:06] word that you and I have the Bible that
[1:06:09] you and I have impact with us there were
[1:06:11] men who gave their lives to see to it
[1:06:14] that this word would be put into our
[1:06:16] hands ultimately with the burden moving
[1:06:19] by the Spirit of God knowing that it
[1:06:21] takes the Word of God and the Spirit of
[1:06:23] God moving on that word to move it into
[1:06:26] the hearts of the people people would
[1:06:28] stand but about that time after God said
[1:06:31] enough testimony has been given
[1:06:34] enough testimony that these are people
[1:06:37] who have not been brainwashed they met
[1:06:40] me
[1:06:41] Locke the Hebrew children they didn't
[1:06:44] hear from God that God was going to meet
[1:06:46] him in the fiery furnace but they stood
[1:06:49] they said we don't know what God's gonna
[1:06:52] do but we know he's going to deliver us
[1:06:54] from your hand either way and God was
[1:06:56] silent in that time and he let them
[1:06:59] stand and what was it their faith was
[1:07:02] proved in the midst of that time and
[1:07:05] then God brought a delivered same way
[1:07:06] even in this time here where the enemy
[1:07:09] would come in and God will allow a
[1:07:11] testing and a trying of that word that
[1:07:14] revelation that had been given in that
[1:07:16] hour and then there would be another
[1:07:17] place that would open up here Wesley OMA
[1:07:20] sanctification by the blood and then
[1:07:23] there would be another part that would
[1:07:24] open up aren't you glad that God has a
[1:07:27] place that has been prepared for you and
[1:07:30] aren't you glad that after the test and
[1:07:33] trying's are over here after we have
[1:07:36] been proven out that you and I have a
[1:07:38] place that is prepared for you if I go
[1:07:42] away I will prepare a place for you
[1:07:46] aren't you glad you have a place
[1:07:48] prepared by God think of this under the
[1:07:51] inspiration of the Holy Ghost under
[1:07:54] God's inspiration they were motivated
[1:07:57] you know it takes inspiration you can't
[1:07:59] do anything without inspiration you've
[1:08:01] got to be inspired there was never an
[1:08:03] artist that you're a picture just
[1:08:04] because he was bored there's never been
[1:08:07] a writer who wrote a book because he was
[1:08:08] bored there's never been a songwriter
[1:08:11] who wrote a song simply because he
[1:08:13] didn't have anything else to do that day
[1:08:14] it was inspiration that struck and when
[1:08:17] inspiration strikes you cannot control
[1:08:20] the timing of when that inspiration
[1:08:23] strikes you've just got to be ready to
[1:08:25] capture it and be captured by let me
[1:08:27] tell you something that God was moving
[1:08:29] within the hearts of these men and women
[1:08:32] and they were being moved by the Spirit
[1:08:34] of God you know they didn't have all the
[1:08:37] things that this is the prophecy this is
[1:08:39] exactly what's taking place but you know
[1:08:41] they were being
[1:08:42] by the Spirit of God there was a hunger
[1:08:45] that was rising in their life you know
[1:08:46] he wasn't what they heard about
[1:08:48] Jamestown it wasn't what they heard
[1:08:50] about Roanoke Island it was not about
[1:08:52] all those things that they heard about
[1:08:54] they did not come here because it would
[1:08:56] be better soil to plant potatoes no sir
[1:08:58] these were not carnal people these were
[1:09:01] people who were inspired by the same
[1:09:04] Holy Ghost that inspires the elect
[1:09:07] children of God today they came here to
[1:09:09] this place knowing that their life would
[1:09:12] be in jeopardy in the voyage across that
[1:09:14] ocean they knew their life they didn't
[1:09:16] even have a promise there would be a
[1:09:18] house or something awaiting of they did
[1:09:21] not know how they would do it you say
[1:09:23] what is said that was motivating them
[1:09:25] the liberty and freedom to be able to
[1:09:29] worship God that's what was motivating
[1:09:33] these people Omaha you see brother BAM
[1:09:39] says God had a reason for it God was
[1:09:43] going to show the world what he could do
[1:09:45] with a little band of people that wanted
[1:09:48] freedom and freedom of religion to serve
[1:09:50] God it don't take a big a lot of people
[1:09:53] it just takes people with a hunger for
[1:09:55] God come on somebody he don't take a big
[1:09:59] group of people
[1:10:00] it only took a group of people who had a
[1:10:02] hunger for God you realize that many of
[1:10:04] them died on the voice over half of them
[1:10:06] died on the voice over here I think they
[1:10:08] started out 106 and in the 51 of them
[1:10:11] died and there more of them that died
[1:10:13] within the first few of the first year
[1:10:15] or whatever more that was here even some
[1:10:17] of them McCain went ahead and returned
[1:10:19] back years later but there were those
[1:10:21] who came here with the original purpose
[1:10:23] I'm telling you right now they were
[1:10:25] right in step with the prophecy of
[1:10:27] Almighty God you see it isn't something
[1:10:29] that they felt spiritual but they were
[1:10:31] spiritual they were spiritual because
[1:10:34] they failed and they were not going to
[1:10:36] give heed to that Roman Catholic system
[1:10:39] that had already taken over that angling
[1:10:42] in church had a different name but it
[1:10:44] was still that Jezebel system they
[1:10:46] realized you know what during a man
[1:10:48] that's my Holy Ghost they stood for that
[1:10:51] the Holy Ghost it is an inner
[1:10:54] power a conviction of divine truth it
[1:10:57] was not something that they were going
[1:10:58] to be ruled by men you know what it was
[1:11:01] it was a desire within their heart the
[1:11:03] same as it was within Abraham there is a
[1:11:06] land it God had stirred their hearts
[1:11:12] think about it there had already been a
[1:11:14] discovery made of this place somebody
[1:11:18] had already been here and they heard
[1:11:20] about it they heard about this land and
[1:11:24] when they heard about this land what
[1:11:26] they envisioned was Liberty that was
[1:11:31] exactly what God had in mind are you
[1:11:34] with me
[1:11:35] now think of this here a purpose brother
[1:11:38] Bremen goes on now I think these are
[1:11:39] important statements brother Ben goes on
[1:11:41] to say in time tested or faith produces
[1:11:43] the goods he said here's where our
[1:11:45] forefathers landed for this freedom of
[1:11:47] religion on Plymouth Rock it is from
[1:11:50] these sacred soils here that praying men
[1:11:52] and women went forth to establish this
[1:11:55] great spiritual economy that we are
[1:11:57] privileged to serve today
[1:11:58] no American could be ashamed of their
[1:12:01] forefathers who landed in this country
[1:12:03] brother Branham I wish I could say the
[1:12:06] same thing today but then again he said
[1:12:08] no American could be oh let us have meal
[1:12:13] I'm not being political I'm just saying
[1:12:15] what he said he said no America come on
[1:12:20] no American could be ashamed of their
[1:12:22] forefathers who landed in this country
[1:12:25] went to church packing guns whoo who
[1:12:29] came here for freedom of religion went
[1:12:32] on horseback covered in old wagons
[1:12:34] fought the Indians and so forth to get
[1:12:37] to go to church
[1:12:39] lord have mercy what kind of excuse to
[1:12:41] you and I have they fought to go to
[1:12:43] church it was not something easy they
[1:12:46] didn't have some kind of a nice car and
[1:12:48] it was an easy passage sometimes coming
[1:12:51] to the house of God it meant their life
[1:12:53] but the reason they were here
[1:12:56] the reason daily they did what they did
[1:12:58] is because of their desire and hunger to
[1:13:01] share
[1:13:02] living car they didn't want to serving
[1:13:05] by a Creed they didn't want to serve him
[1:13:07] by a Dogma these were not people that
[1:13:09] were saddled with forms they knew
[1:13:12] there's a living person I must have that
[1:13:15] person
[1:13:16] [Applause]
[1:13:22] hello glory what a parallel between here
[1:13:28] this nation in Israel remember as I
[1:13:34] refute uu refer to a few places in the
[1:13:36] scripture when God met Moses he told him
[1:13:41] I want you to go down I want you to
[1:13:45] carry this message to my people I've
[1:13:48] come down and I'm sending you I want you
[1:13:51] to bring them out of the land that
[1:13:52] they're in and I want you to bring them
[1:13:55] unto a land that floweth with milk and
[1:13:57] honey he was reminding them of the
[1:14:01] promise that belonged to him then you
[1:14:04] find when Moses comes down if I could
[1:14:07] refer just to a few places as they stood
[1:14:10] there before Pharaoh Moses would express
[1:14:14] in Exodus 5 thus saith the Lord God of
[1:14:17] Israel let my people go that they may
[1:14:19] hold a feast unto me in the wilderness
[1:14:22] see Moses when he came down the word of
[1:14:26] the Lord did not come down there to make
[1:14:30] life easier
[1:14:32] as a matter of fact when the word began
[1:14:35] to move on the scene life got a little
[1:14:37] bit harder
[1:14:38] it didn't get easier it got harder as it
[1:14:42] came closer to the fulfillment to think
[1:14:45] of how that when they stood there before
[1:14:47] Pharaoh and they would make known of
[1:14:50] these things Pharaoh simply envisioned
[1:14:53] it he's moved on by spirit to God said
[1:14:57] I'll allow his heart to be hardened and
[1:14:59] you know what Pharaoh's interpretation
[1:15:01] of this is these people are idle they
[1:15:05] got too much time on their hands so you
[1:15:08] know what I'm going to do they can go
[1:15:10] gather their straw now than themselves
[1:15:13] why why why did he say that that they
[1:15:16] will not regard vain words do you see
[1:15:22] what Satan the scoffer and the mark
[1:15:25] marker would want to do as though the
[1:15:28] promise of God the coming of the Lord I
[1:15:30] tell you right now this morning don't
[1:15:32] you look for it well it might be a month
[1:15:34] off it might be a year off it may not be
[1:15:37] an hour or a minute off don't regard
[1:15:41] what's being spoken as pain words the
[1:15:43] promises are sure and remember the
[1:15:47] spirit of the scoffers in the last day
[1:15:50] 2nd Peter chapter 3 it says that men
[1:15:53] will look and say well all things
[1:15:55] continue as they always have been really
[1:15:59] it takes spiritual discernment you've
[1:16:03] got to have spiritual discernment in
[1:16:05] this hour in order to have spiritual
[1:16:08] discernment you need to be spirit filled
[1:16:11] and to be spirit filled is where you
[1:16:14] have your own experience with Jesus
[1:16:17] Christ to where you're hearing his voice
[1:16:22] notice favor goes on to tells him what's
[1:16:27] how favor oh then we'll start to relax
[1:16:29] you see the devil was gonna chest and
[1:16:31] say are you gonna stand on this are you
[1:16:35] gonna stand on it what God's revealed to
[1:16:37] you are you gonna stand on it see it
[1:16:40] isn't just what he's revealed and then
[1:16:42] look they're out of the land but no
[1:16:44] what's revealed has it captured your
[1:16:47] heart to where there's a stand on the
[1:16:49] inside so much so that Pharaoh you know
[1:16:52] subtly here he comes along it says to
[1:16:54] tell you what an accident
[1:16:56] you can go sacrifice but just do it
[1:16:58] right in the land I mean you can stay
[1:17:01] right here and Moses said we will not do
[1:17:05] that we will not do that the Egyptians
[1:17:08] would rise up upon us they don't they
[1:17:11] don't want no part of it you see what it
[1:17:12] is - a real heart that's desiring to
[1:17:15] worship God hid in just any place here's
[1:17:18] a chosen place that God has for the
[1:17:22] believers to worship and
[1:17:24] let me tell you something that place
[1:17:26] it's not a land that place is the person
[1:17:30] of the Lord Jesus Christ that is the
[1:17:33] gate that's the place to worship how
[1:17:39] many times you know you'd find brother
[1:17:40] Ramos who has moved under the
[1:17:42] inspiration of God come out of this mess
[1:17:43] coming out of her my people the exact
[1:17:46] voice of the scripture and how many
[1:17:48] times then brother Brandt would tell the
[1:17:49] people he would tell them and say you
[1:17:51] know what go ahead and go on back to
[1:17:52] your church you'd be a real good
[1:17:53] Christian you know what it is if those
[1:17:55] people got a real true taste and a real
[1:17:58] good dose of the Holy Ghost and the Word
[1:18:00] of God had struck their heart there
[1:18:01] would not be anything there within that
[1:18:03] church or that place that would be able
[1:18:05] to hold him there might be other people
[1:18:07] that would stay there but there would be
[1:18:09] people who would flee to a place that
[1:18:12] God had prepared you see the Bible said
[1:18:14] that the woman fled into the wilderness
[1:18:16] she was not packed away she fled there
[1:18:20] was a way that was open where did that
[1:18:22] way begin it began a lot farther and
[1:18:24] farther back than the Mayflower or the
[1:18:26] Speedwell that way itself it was made in
[1:18:29] their heart that Liberty was burning in
[1:18:32] the heart that high cancer the Lord God
[1:18:35] freely it was already in their hearts
[1:18:38] the way was already in their hearts when
[1:18:45] Moses said no I ain't staying here you
[1:18:47] let us go three days journey three days
[1:18:51] journey not just one day not just two
[1:18:56] days but three days not just
[1:18:59] justification not just sanctification
[1:19:02] come on all the way we want to hold a
[1:19:06] feast unto the Lord glory be to God a
[1:19:10] complete separation why a separation
[1:19:14] where a new land is opened unto us call
[1:19:17] him be to God in the highest
[1:19:19] oh my and Pharaoh said I'll let you go
[1:19:21] and you may sacrifice to the Lord your
[1:19:24] God watch this again
[1:19:25] you may sacrifice to the Lord your gone
[1:19:27] in the wilderness but just don't go
[1:19:29] overboard I mean too far keep your
[1:19:34] senses about you that's the problem
[1:19:37] census we keep our census and we need to
[1:19:40] lose our census
[1:19:42] we're wasn't so interested in keeping
[1:19:44] our mind instead of losing our mind and
[1:19:46] that we might find the mind of Christ
[1:19:47] see Satan's willing to make compromise
[1:19:50] and you say blessed God I'm standing on
[1:19:53] what God did in mind in my life you're
[1:19:55] going to be tested you will be tried and
[1:19:57] the devil will say hey it's alright no
[1:19:59] problem you can just worship God right
[1:20:01] here in the land I mean after all you
[1:20:03] know it's about your heart where your
[1:20:06] heart is your body will follow you can't
[1:20:11] tell me you can't tell me or tell
[1:20:12] anybody else my heart is really for God
[1:20:14] and your body is somewhere else because
[1:20:17] if your hearts for God then it will
[1:20:19] cause your body to stand in the presence
[1:20:22] of God come on friends I mean either
[1:20:26] we've got quickening power on the inside
[1:20:27] of us or we don't either we've got the
[1:20:29] fulfillment of the word that talks about
[1:20:31] the quickening power of God that's able
[1:20:33] to bring this body and subjection or we
[1:20:35] don't let's not kid ourselves let's not
[1:20:38] fool ourselves we're living in a late
[1:20:40] hour Satan will make you prove when
[1:20:44] Daniel purposed in his heart he said I'm
[1:20:47] not going to defile myself with the
[1:20:49] Kings meat or his wine Daniel was living
[1:20:53] right in the midst of Babylon but he was
[1:20:55] still living and overcomer he was still
[1:20:59] live in a separated life I believe
[1:21:02] Daniel a testimony he didn't have the
[1:21:04] Holy Ghost like you and I have it but
[1:21:06] what a testimony it is that the children
[1:21:09] of God in this hour being able by the
[1:21:11] grace of God by the Holy Ghost to live
[1:21:14] right in the midst of hail Satan seen
[1:21:16] and yet living and overcoming live how
[1:21:19] is that possible because the overcomer
[1:21:21] is on the inside and they overcame him
[1:21:25] by the blood of the Lamb and the word of
[1:21:27] their testimony and they loved not their
[1:21:32] lives unto death you can love your life
[1:21:42] God let him know you're gonna
[1:21:45] I brought you on eagle's wings in Exodus
[1:21:48] 19 and I brought you to myself in Exodus
[1:21:53] 23 god affirmed to Moses then I'll send
[1:21:58] my angel before thee to keep being the
[1:22:00] way and to bring the end of the place
[1:22:01] which I have prepared only heed his
[1:22:06] voice so this angel of the Lord that was
[1:22:09] in their midst was not a mute he had a
[1:22:14] voice so the pillar fire led him by the
[1:22:19] word it was the age of the Lord in the
[1:22:22] word leading the people come on friends
[1:22:25] it wasn't Moses words Moses in order for
[1:22:29] Moses to know what to do
[1:22:30] oh I love how the prophet puts it in God
[1:22:32] does God change his mind he said Moses
[1:22:35] looked up there of that pillar fire he
[1:22:37] got his information from the logos that
[1:22:40] was following them in order to tell the
[1:22:42] children of Israel what to do you see it
[1:22:45] was a channel that God had in that hour
[1:22:47] of channel it was God's grace that had
[1:22:50] been provided for them that they might
[1:22:52] know God's will and pathway through the
[1:22:55] wilderness aren't you glad God has
[1:22:59] provided that for you and I also Moses
[1:23:02] think of how Moses within the midst of
[1:23:04] it he would ask Lord let me see your
[1:23:07] face he would ask them and without scar
[1:23:11] Lord the one thing that oh that that
[1:23:14] means the most to us is that your
[1:23:16] presence would go with us Moses said if
[1:23:19] your presence doesn't go with us then
[1:23:21] don't you carry us one more step you see
[1:23:23] Moses even though he was given the word
[1:23:25] he realized that the word itself it is a
[1:23:28] possession that belongs to us as
[1:23:30] believers but it must be the waymaker
[1:23:32] himself the Holy Spirit the angel of the
[1:23:34] Lord that is directing the camp of the
[1:23:37] Lord and opening up the way and the
[1:23:39] promises and so Moses said we are just
[1:23:42] content to abide where you are biting
[1:23:45] and when it's time to move when you're
[1:23:47] moving we want to move and he said it
[1:23:49] shall be
[1:23:50] how is it that it shall be the house how
[1:23:53] will we be distinguished from all the
[1:23:56] other nations of this earth is it not in
[1:23:59] that Dai presence will go with us well
[1:24:02] was it a Moses here was pressing that
[1:24:05] desire that it's not just enough to be a
[1:24:08] church but in order to be the church
[1:24:10] spoken of in the Word of the Living God
[1:24:13] it must be the Holy Ghost Omaha no
[1:24:16] wonder the Prophet said that a church
[1:24:18] itself or it can have everything so
[1:24:20] right like a bejeweled corpse
[1:24:23] that's laying in a casket but without
[1:24:25] the Holy Ghost he said it is nothing
[1:24:27] there must be the Holy Ghost in the camp
[1:24:30] to lead the Church of the Living God it
[1:24:33] must be the Holy Ghost supply what for
[1:24:36] you and I have meet up he's taking the
[1:24:38] word that he delivered for his prophet
[1:24:41] in this hour and he is ministering to
[1:24:44] our needs and that same one ministering
[1:24:47] to our needs that deals with our life is
[1:24:49] the same Lord God that'll pack us across
[1:24:52] the Jordan one of these mornings notice
[1:24:57] God goes on to say here he gave warning
[1:25:03] and Deuteronomy that they would keep the
[1:25:08] statutes and the judgments that were
[1:25:10] being given you see this is a great
[1:25:12] learning lesson Liberty is not just do
[1:25:17] whatever you want to do that's called
[1:25:20] confusion you know what that comes out
[1:25:24] of that comes out of was it is it
[1:25:25] Alexander Crawley who were the guy that
[1:25:28] the Satanic guy do whatever thou fill us
[1:25:31] to do that don't come from God God sir
[1:25:36] Liberty has boundaries he didn't let the
[1:25:40] sea say I'll tell you what see you just
[1:25:42] go wherever you want to go today daddy
[1:25:43] loves you you go wherever you want to go
[1:25:45] today no he said I've got the moon here
[1:25:48] and yours boundary set for you God even
[1:25:52] has ways that the water will flow him
[1:25:54] water flows south or it'll float north
[1:25:57] there's certain ways depending on where
[1:25:59] it's positioned on the hemispheres of
[1:26:02] this earth who orchestrated that
[1:26:04] Almighty God everything has an order and
[1:26:07] must abide within its order it has
[1:26:10] boundaries when God replace Israel in
[1:26:12] the land there were boundaries that were
[1:26:14] special for it let me tell you something
[1:26:16] we ought to be zealous about the
[1:26:18] boundaries that God has given us in
[1:26:20] Christ we ought to be selya's about
[1:26:22] taking every bit that God has given to
[1:26:24] us in this hour and also just as Elias
[1:26:28] with maintaining what God has given us
[1:26:33] but he told him when people begin to see
[1:26:38] the statutes and the judgments in your
[1:26:40] life they will say this is what they'll
[1:26:43] say when they see the word in action in
[1:26:46] your life they will say surely this
[1:26:50] great nation is a wise and understanding
[1:26:53] people
[1:26:56] for what nation is there so great who
[1:26:59] have gods so nigh unto them as the Lord
[1:27:02] our God is and all things that we call
[1:27:04] on him for what nation is there so great
[1:27:07] that hath statutes and judgments so
[1:27:09] righteous as all this law which I set
[1:27:12] before you this day and then God makes a
[1:27:16] very important statement I believe it's
[1:27:19] verse 11 he said don't forget to tell
[1:27:23] you teach your children your children's
[1:27:28] children these things and he says
[1:27:29] especially especially the day you stood
[1:27:35] before the Lord your God you see it's
[1:27:40] more than just statutes and judgments we
[1:27:43] want to teach them the word of the Lord
[1:27:45] but what what are we talking about with
[1:27:47] teaching submitting to his word
[1:27:51] instructing them in the word of truth
[1:27:53] this house is guided by the Holy Ghost
[1:27:56] the token is applied here you can they
[1:28:00] can memorize all the statutes all the
[1:28:02] judgments but friends let it be that the
[1:28:05] life that is behind specially the day
[1:28:08] that thou students there let it be the
[1:28:10] life of the Holy Ghost the token on
[1:28:12] display that punctuates the word the
[1:28:16] statutes that's being expressed because
[1:28:20] it's that life it's him him who is the
[1:28:23] word that they will heed to see God was
[1:28:28] letting him know this you know brother
[1:28:29] Brown will make this statement he made
[1:28:32] Israel the most mightiest nation in the
[1:28:34] world and she stayed that way until she
[1:28:37] got out of the will of God what did he
[1:28:40] do with America he made her the
[1:28:41] mightiest nation in the world until
[1:28:43] she's getting out of the will of God he
[1:28:46] said all then he goes into talk about
[1:28:49] America our forefathers who came here
[1:28:52] for religious freedom
[1:28:58] the vehm goes on to say I want you to
[1:29:00] catch this these Americans he talks
[1:29:05] about George Washington they came across
[1:29:10] the valley for Juno and has been in
[1:29:11] multiple times when I went to New York
[1:29:13] and then this last time when I drove up
[1:29:15] to Connecticut and I think about as I
[1:29:16] crossed the Delaware River there there's
[1:29:19] not a time that I don't cross then my
[1:29:20] boys even this last time going to
[1:29:24] Connecticut I said it again I said
[1:29:26] there's not a moment I can't think about
[1:29:27] when they cross through ice George
[1:29:35] Washington prayed all night it wasn't
[1:29:40] because he was such an expert general
[1:29:42] sometimes what you get to looking at is
[1:29:45] this outside part but what was it what
[1:29:47] was it these men were men of God they
[1:29:51] had spiritual discernment about their
[1:29:54] life you tell me how the majority of
[1:29:57] that arm not even having shoes how is it
[1:30:02] that they could have won the war that
[1:30:04] they want how is it because God was with
[1:30:08] them because they were with God you know
[1:30:13] why it was the purpose the motive the
[1:30:16] reason behind it
[1:30:17] how did they get the right motive how
[1:30:20] did they get the right purpose they were
[1:30:22] in line with God you think there might
[1:30:27] not have been things that try to come up
[1:30:28] in their heart but I believe with all my
[1:30:30] heart spiritual men like George
[1:30:32] Washington to him they could hold those
[1:30:33] men and hold him to a place I'll tell
[1:30:36] you when they're giving out orders you
[1:30:37] might as well say they were taking texts
[1:30:39] and preaching there was there was lives
[1:30:41] and hearts my brother and sister that
[1:30:43] were being held in line with one
[1:30:44] principle with one motive with one
[1:30:47] purpose you know what it was freedom
[1:30:49] liberty that's what was pulsating in
[1:30:53] their heart that's the same thing that's
[1:30:55] moved into your heart that's moved into
[1:30:57] my heart when that earnest that
[1:30:59] downpayment that deposit of the Holy
[1:31:01] Ghost has moved into your heart from the
[1:31:04] other
[1:31:04] ha it's a witness by the liberty that
[1:31:07] you are born of right now that there is
[1:31:09] a place I'll never grow old I'll never
[1:31:15] be sick but I'll be in his presence
[1:31:19] day after day moment after moment what
[1:31:25] is it that keeps you going that Liberty
[1:31:28] on the inside oh there's a Liberty bail
[1:31:32] that's much greater than one hung in
[1:31:34] Philadelphia and when that Liberty Bell
[1:31:37] was read that was another bail that was
[1:31:39] rent that was one whose side was ripped
[1:31:47] on Calvary and there was a loosening
[1:31:51] there of reconciliation a loosening of
[1:31:55] Redemption a loosening and a judgement
[1:31:58] was poured out upon the Prince of this
[1:32:00] world all of those who were waiting in
[1:32:03] paradise
[1:32:04] that had offered up the lamb by
[1:32:05] revelation they were standing there they
[1:32:08] were hungry they were waiting what were
[1:32:10] they looking for that land Abraham was
[1:32:13] looking for that land they had a
[1:32:19] principle the Prophet said something
[1:32:21] that they had to fight for Psalms 33 12
[1:32:25] blessed is the nation whose God is the
[1:32:27] Lord brother branham just flatly says it
[1:32:33] he said this nation is a Catholic nation
[1:32:35] and it's the truth because of what she
[1:32:38] did
[1:32:39] it is a Catholic nation he said because
[1:32:41] of her leader now hold on you see
[1:32:47] friends don't try to save this sinking
[1:32:49] ship just make sure you get in the
[1:32:52] gospel ship
[1:32:53] just make sure that you don't sink
[1:32:55] trying to turn it around because there
[1:32:57] ain't no turning it around now the Lord
[1:33:01] is that spirit 2nd Corinthians 3:17 and
[1:33:03] where the Spirit of the Lord is there is
[1:33:05] Liberty
[1:33:08] you see God let him know and Deuteronomy
[1:33:11] 6 I'm just referring to these places
[1:33:12] here God let them knowing Deuteronomy 6
[1:33:15] when you get in the land you start
[1:33:18] enjoying wells that you didn't dig you
[1:33:22] start living in houses that you didn't
[1:33:23] build you start eating no vineyards that
[1:33:26] you didn't plant when you start drinking
[1:33:28] water from wells you didn't dig what is
[1:33:33] it he's provided at all but notice what
[1:33:37] he told them be careful that you don't
[1:33:40] forget the LORD thy God which brought
[1:33:45] you out of Egypt what was he telling
[1:33:47] them don't get comfortable in your
[1:33:50] surroundings why because why were they
[1:33:53] in the land they had to get back in the
[1:33:55] land in order for the Messiah to come
[1:33:57] when you get in the land start looking
[1:34:00] for the Messiah don't get comfortable
[1:34:03] with all of this you know you say well
[1:34:04] why did God provide wells why did God do
[1:34:07] this because God said if you'll just
[1:34:09] keep me first in your life I will make
[1:34:12] sure you have a good success but when
[1:34:15] you try to start doing it on your own
[1:34:16] and you belong to me I'll make sure you
[1:34:19] fall flat on your face so that you can
[1:34:21] recognize you're here you're here not to
[1:34:24] serve your purpose you're here to serve
[1:34:26] my purpose and that in itself is the
[1:34:34] tender mercy of God let me try to close
[1:34:41] here
[1:34:47] how did this happen of where we see it
[1:34:50] now how did it get to where it is now
[1:34:59] familiar scripture to us Isaiah 14 how
[1:35:06] are their fallen from heaven o Lucifer
[1:35:09] son of the morning how art thou cut down
[1:35:14] to the ground look at these last words
[1:35:16] which didst weaken the nation's Satan
[1:35:25] cannot overthrow God's purpose but what
[1:35:30] he seeks to do is weaken
[1:35:33] once it gets weakened by what not
[1:35:37] heeding to the Lord God he seeks to
[1:35:41] weaken little by little like he did in
[1:35:46] the Garden of Eden he just began to talk
[1:35:48] to her then he began to insert words and
[1:35:52] change words what's he doing he's
[1:35:54] weakening her the whole time he's
[1:36:01] disarming her and she doesn't even know
[1:36:04] it this is Satan's tactics thou didst
[1:36:06] weaken the nation's Daniel chapter 2
[1:36:11] verse 40 and the fourth Kingdom speaking
[1:36:14] of this that of the Rome and the fourth
[1:36:17] Kingdom shall be as strong as iron watch
[1:36:21] this for as much as iron breaketh in
[1:36:24] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[1:36:31] iron that breaketh all these shall it
[1:36:33] break in pieces and bruise
[1:36:38] see the iron this beak act that the
[1:36:41] characteristic of this fourth kingdom of
[1:36:44] Nebuchadnezzar the dream Daniel
[1:36:46] interprets is this of the Roman kingdom
[1:36:50] the same spirit that's been throughout
[1:36:52] the earth all the way from the beginning
[1:36:54] that dragon we read about the red dragon
[1:36:56] Satan the devil oh it's all speaking of
[1:36:59] one and the same person he has his own
[1:37:02] church he has his own religion he has
[1:37:07] his own preachers come on friends notice
[1:37:12] this he breaks into pieces what does
[1:37:14] this iron do it breaks into pieces and
[1:37:17] subdues all things it comes in with
[1:37:25] flatteries flatteries comes in with
[1:37:31] flatteries moving things to pieces very
[1:37:35] very innocent the Bible says in
[1:37:41] Revelations 13 I'm coming down I beheld
[1:37:48] another beast coming up out of the earth
[1:37:49] notice not out of water out of the earth
[1:37:53] this is the place that God had prepared
[1:37:57] for the woman to flee here she is
[1:38:00] revelations 13 America represented as a
[1:38:06] woman here she is and I beheld another
[1:38:10] beast coming up out of the earth and he
[1:38:12] had two horns like a lamb and he spake
[1:38:19] as a dragon notice when it first comes
[1:38:21] up like a lamb like a Lamb of God
[1:38:25] freedom of religion freedom of worship
[1:38:27] but they had two horns you see this lamb
[1:38:31] never became a ram is that right
[1:38:36] brother Ram takes us and lets us know he
[1:38:38] said what this is that's our American
[1:38:40] Buffalo and do you realize under
[1:38:43] President Obama is when they actually
[1:38:45] put forth that this to be a national
[1:38:48] symbol
[1:38:49] of the United States the American bison
[1:38:54] I've got the articles right in front of
[1:38:56] me I'm not gonna refer to him today but
[1:38:59] to notice within this time of where it
[1:39:01] sounded prophecy you see you look at and
[1:39:03] say well what God promised there but God
[1:39:07] also promised what would come about you
[1:39:12] see it never was a land notice Israel
[1:39:14] God would give him Shiloh but after a
[1:39:17] while he would move on God would give
[1:39:20] them places and Israel would be in the
[1:39:22] land but even when God brought Israel
[1:39:24] into the land Israel in the majority did
[1:39:28] not remain true to God let me tell you
[1:39:31] friends it's not a place here on this
[1:39:33] earth that'll help you to be spiritual
[1:39:35] it's a person you want to live a
[1:39:38] victorious life you can taught it you
[1:39:41] can try to take a tour of churches you
[1:39:43] can try to find them a sign this church
[1:39:44] try to find it here try to find a pair
[1:39:46] but there's one place you need to make
[1:39:48] sure you get and that's in Jesus Christ
[1:39:51] when you ever meet him face to face you
[1:39:54] then have come to your place of rest and
[1:39:57] you'll know where you belong in the body
[1:39:59] you have access then to all of that you
[1:40:03] see this is the reality it isn't that
[1:40:05] all of a sudden because that all grows
[1:40:07] old understand how many times people
[1:40:10] start a job all this is the best job in
[1:40:11] the world this is the wonderful job in
[1:40:13] the world one week two weeks three weeks
[1:40:18] five what are you doing I'm just waiting
[1:40:21] to all of a sudden some of the cons
[1:40:23] start coming out on it because it's not
[1:40:26] the Utopia with what is it you say been
[1:40:29] the same - what is it it's because
[1:40:30] there's something there
[1:40:32] the real longing a real thirst within us
[1:40:36] there is a place there is a place that
[1:40:41] is the satisfying of all things
[1:40:45] there is a place it's a longing it's a
[1:40:49] thirst and I'll tell you what when you
[1:40:51] meet the Lord Jesus Christ you have met
[1:40:54] the satisfy of your soul you might be
[1:40:57] disappointed in life
[1:40:58] this could disappoint you this could let
[1:41:00] you down this charm might flow fall
[1:41:02] through this might happen but you have
[1:41:04] met the satisfier and the sustainer of
[1:41:07] your soul and although all those other
[1:41:10] things they can try to affect you but
[1:41:12] you have met him and he really is
[1:41:18] freedom he really is
[1:41:23] Liberty there is no Liberty outside of
[1:41:29] the Lord Jesus Christ that is that land
[1:41:33] the smally it is that land of the
[1:41:36] Blessed Holy Ghost the land of the world
[1:41:39] of this hour that God has opened up to
[1:41:42] us once Satan had it all and down
[1:41:47] through the ages the Creed's and the
[1:41:48] dogmas and everything has been all sewed
[1:41:51] up and didn't want the Holy Ghost the
[1:41:53] person of Christ within the church but
[1:41:55] God here a promise by His Word
[1:41:58] just like he promised that he made a way
[1:42:00] for the woman to flee into the
[1:42:02] wilderness God by virtue of a promise of
[1:42:05] his word he opened up the way for you
[1:42:08] and I he opened up the promise within
[1:42:12] this hour for you and I and we and we
[1:42:17] lock those pilgrims that came over there
[1:42:20] you notice what they're called pilgrims
[1:42:23] no wonder brother Bantam could say an
[1:42:26] invisible union brother enim you say
[1:42:28] this is not much of a Thanksgiving
[1:42:29] message he said ho I think it's a very
[1:42:31] fitting message for the occasion they
[1:42:34] left that Roman persecution and because
[1:42:37] they left it behind you know what he was
[1:42:39] saying they died to it they left it
[1:42:42] behind then they could be married to the
[1:42:45] anointed Word of God Liberty
[1:42:50] the Holy Spirit was free to move among
[1:42:55] how did this happen
[1:42:57] in Israel how did this happen here in
[1:43:01] this United States little by little
[1:43:11] letting down on the standard of the word
[1:43:17] little by little Satan kept coming in to
[1:43:24] where brother Branham when you listen to
[1:43:27] the message hybrid religion or titled
[1:43:30] condemnation by representation brother M
[1:43:33] spends the first half of that message
[1:43:34] telling the people what did I tell you
[1:43:37] about going to the voting booth last
[1:43:40] week he let him know you made the
[1:43:43] biggest mistake this America has that
[1:43:46] it's ever done listen to me he said they
[1:43:49] voted in a man who stands for that Roman
[1:43:55] Catholic system and brother Brian asked
[1:43:59] the question how did it come that way
[1:44:00] brother Graham said it's because the
[1:44:03] voice of politics has overrode the voice
[1:44:06] of God he said if the voice of God had
[1:44:09] been proclaimed in the churches the
[1:44:11] voice of politics wouldn't have stood a
[1:44:13] chance he said but what happened in here
[1:44:16] is people sold out their birth rights
[1:44:18] and voted him in and you know what he
[1:44:21] said put him there the woman's right to
[1:44:22] vote when the Spirit of God had given
[1:44:24] him a vision back in 1931 and said the
[1:44:27] woman would rise and the woman's vote
[1:44:29] would put this one in why did it do it I
[1:44:34] find it I find it remarkable that
[1:44:36] brother M goes on to saying Jezebel
[1:44:38] religion the reason that he was put in
[1:44:41] is because people were so caught up with
[1:44:43] the political we get bigger tax cuts
[1:44:45] we'll have more money in our paycheck I
[1:44:48] know it's just a little phrase stuck
[1:44:50] right in the middle of that message but
[1:44:51] you see what it is brother have said
[1:44:53] people sold their birth rights for that
[1:44:56] right there you know what it is money
[1:44:57] love of money you gotta ask yourself the
[1:45:01] question are you planning on staying
[1:45:03] here in
[1:45:04] this world are you interested in getting
[1:45:05] out of here you see this is what the
[1:45:09] brother BAM is talking about you realize
[1:45:11] in this hour this is not the mind of
[1:45:13] William Branham this is not this is the
[1:45:16] mighty God that is speaking through that
[1:45:19] vessel I get to find the hour and the
[1:45:22] time when this Jezebel system has rose
[1:45:25] to power because of letting down letting
[1:45:28] down letting down little by little by
[1:45:31] little by little the almighty dollar
[1:45:34] took precedence how did this get in look
[1:45:41] where it's at now look right then I
[1:45:50] don't have time to read these statements
[1:45:52] to you but I want to bring it into this
[1:45:56] place can I just closed closed down on
[1:45:58] this era many of these points and I
[1:46:01] think it deserves a little bit more time
[1:46:02] than what I can give but I want to just
[1:46:05] draw you to this place right here what
[1:46:06] happened to Israel after all this Conley
[1:46:08] background brother Graham said they
[1:46:11] begin to get carefree they begin to get
[1:46:15] where they didn't care what went on they
[1:46:19] begin to get slack in their worship to
[1:46:23] God worship that God goes a lot much
[1:46:27] deeper than just here our lives our
[1:46:33] worship to God how we live and conduct
[1:46:36] our life on a daily basis in a home on
[1:46:38] the jobs and in the score they begin to
[1:46:43] get slack in their worship to God
[1:46:46] although they held a form of religion
[1:46:48] just like we have they had a form of
[1:46:50] godliness but they begin to get free
[1:46:52] with their people and they begin to
[1:46:55] bring in different heresies into the
[1:46:57] church and the worship of Balaam begin
[1:47:00] to creep in
[1:47:03] i'ma just birthrights
[1:47:12] [Music]
[1:47:19] let me just draw to this place here I
[1:47:23] believe this to be admonition for us
[1:47:27] Israel that could come to this place but
[1:47:33] they got away from the purpose of why
[1:47:35] they were in the land what happened in
[1:47:37] this land that we're in the purpose is
[1:47:42] lost freedom is preached that you can
[1:47:48] live any kind of life that ain't freedom
[1:47:50] that is not what the forefathers meant
[1:47:54] that's not what was meant whatsoever but
[1:47:57] notice what's been interpreted today no
[1:48:03] more there's a standard but in other
[1:48:05] words what word is used the same word
[1:48:07] that was used among the Roman Empire
[1:48:09] when they conquered and conquered
[1:48:11] another nation you know what the word
[1:48:12] was tolerance that's not my makeup
[1:48:16] that's exactly what history states when
[1:48:19] they took over another country in their
[1:48:22] religion they said you don't stand
[1:48:23] against it but you must tolerate them
[1:48:25] tolerance Wow that word is broadcast
[1:48:30] everywhere in it tolerate tolerate you
[1:48:34] must have tolerance we must spend for
[1:48:37] the word of God we must stand on the
[1:48:42] Word of God must stand for principles
[1:48:44] remember we are tested we will be tested
[1:48:47] we will not leave this world without
[1:48:51] being tested by every word are we gonna
[1:48:57] stand on every word I say tonight or
[1:49:01] this morning
[1:49:01] I believe we need to take the approach
[1:49:03] what Paul told the Galatian Church stand
[1:49:05] fast in the Liberty wherewith Christ
[1:49:08] hath made you free be not entangled
[1:49:12] again with the yoke of bondage you know
[1:49:15] that Liberty that struck your heart what
[1:49:17] God has started in your life what God
[1:49:18] has done in your life don't let the
[1:49:20] enemy bring you any compromise
[1:49:22] but let it be settled in your heart that
[1:49:25] it's oh it's gotta be all him I don't
[1:49:32] want to farm
[1:49:33] I want him think about Ezra Ezra that
[1:49:41] came back into that place after they had
[1:49:43] been put out of the land because of
[1:49:46] disobedience and then you had people in
[1:49:48] that hour that were wanting to
[1:49:49] compromise I think of this morning how
[1:49:52] just my heart it ring out in this
[1:49:53] morning or last night Ezra stood in that
[1:49:57] place and said God had given us grace to
[1:50:01] return to this place he given us a nail
[1:50:04] in this place and we will hold the
[1:50:08] standard here
[1:50:10] remember Nehemiah Nehemiah went right
[1:50:12] down through the scrolls there were men
[1:50:14] who were claiming to be priests there
[1:50:16] claiming to be a part of it and me and I
[1:50:18] went right down through the scrolls and
[1:50:20] he said you're not a part of what number
[1:50:22] what is written here in the word you
[1:50:24] don't belong in the priesthood get out
[1:50:26] you with me these were not why would
[1:50:29] they were these guys saying these things
[1:50:31] to be harsh it was not that they
[1:50:33] recognized God has brought us back here
[1:50:36] there's a standard to be kept I'll tell
[1:50:39] your friends if we get Lexton our
[1:50:40] thinking if we get laxed in our our ways
[1:50:43] you better be careful that you're not
[1:50:45] left behind hold on the same you're
[1:50:47] preaching fear I'm preaching reality
[1:50:49] it's not because you come to a message
[1:50:51] Church that you're safe or just because
[1:50:53] you know that brother Branham is the
[1:50:55] prophet of the hour or the messenger now
[1:50:57] you better know the prophet of the hour
[1:50:59] the Holy Ghost
[1:51:00] you better know the Spirit of Truth you
[1:51:02] better have a real true experience with
[1:51:05] God if you don't have an experience with
[1:51:07] God you will be left behind in the
[1:51:09] tribulation that is a fact
[1:51:15] it's to be in a place of freedom well I
[1:51:19] can't get over this I can't get over
[1:51:21] this there is a place of freedom there
[1:51:23] is a land of freedom come on somebody
[1:51:25] there is a place of adoption there is a
[1:51:29] land of liberty there is a place
[1:51:33] as the word went forth and it rose
[1:51:37] within the heart of these Pilgrim
[1:51:39] Fathers to recognize there is a place
[1:51:41] that we can worship freely I'm telling
[1:51:44] you this morning there is a place there
[1:51:46] is a person where you can worship freely
[1:51:49] you can live a real godly life you don't
[1:51:52] have to worry about what family says or
[1:51:55] what they say on the job but when you
[1:51:57] meet him and come into this place it's
[1:51:59] him it's all that matters
[1:52:01] he will equip you Jacob to meet he saw
[1:52:04] that's what he'll do there is a place
[1:52:08] and see Israel came into this place but
[1:52:13] what Israel started to do is let down I
[1:52:16] mean such wonderful delicacies such
[1:52:20] wonderful things I think God for the
[1:52:23] revealing of this word but listen
[1:52:24] friends don't you get complacent don't
[1:52:28] get complacent you ought to be more
[1:52:30] prayer if the words really struck in our
[1:52:33] heart it ought to be more of a design
[1:52:35] hope brother Samuel I see so much sin
[1:52:38] why don't you quit looking around come
[1:52:41] on somebody the Bible says in that X is
[1:52:44] equal chapter 9 then it says I want you
[1:52:47] with an corn to seal those who cry and
[1:52:50] sign for the abomination of the wicked
[1:52:52] that's done in the city I say does
[1:52:54] anybody got a burden a burden not about
[1:52:57] all everybody's failing everybody is
[1:53:00] this everybody's that Jesus ain't failed
[1:53:03] Jesus ain't gonna fail
[1:53:05] Jesus has a bride Jesus has a bride
[1:53:08] that's an overcomer there are overcomers
[1:53:11] in this hour but Satan's tactic is to
[1:53:16] try to get you to look like the word
[1:53:17] ain't being effective but the word is
[1:53:19] effective the word is having an effect
[1:53:23] on his people after all those words that
[1:53:32] the Prophet told us very simple how can
[1:53:34] you have faith for somebody else and you
[1:53:36] don't have the faith for your own self
[1:53:37] but once you got the faith for yourself
[1:53:40] you've got that token then you know hey
[1:53:42] that same power of God did the
[1:53:44] impossible for me it can do it for them
[1:53:45] too
[1:53:46] you say you've got the faith that's
[1:53:49] needed in this hour
[1:53:50] the faith to face impossibilities Paul
[1:53:59] letter no there's gonna be Grievous
[1:54:01] wolves Paul wants you to stay with us no
[1:54:04] I've done my part
[1:54:07] now the word that's been spoken he who
[1:54:10] spoke it through me will bring it into
[1:54:12] effect but I'm gonna let you know just
[1:54:15] so you're not startled there's gonna be
[1:54:16] grievious Wolf's rise up there's gonna
[1:54:19] be men rise up from among your ranks
[1:54:20] speaking perverse things there's gonna
[1:54:23] be ministers as Paul goes on to tell in
[1:54:25] Corinthians our deceitful workers he
[1:54:29] lets the church to know this don't be
[1:54:31] alarmed by this but what does he say
[1:54:36] stand stand take unto you the full armor
[1:54:43] of God that you might be able to stand I
[1:54:48] don't know what ground that God has
[1:54:51] given you but whatever ground that God
[1:54:54] has given you you not only had to fight
[1:54:58] to take it you said well God gave it to
[1:55:00] me yeah he did it God gives it to you
[1:55:02] but you gotta fight to take it and once
[1:55:06] you take it you gotta fight to keep it
[1:55:09] if there's no such thing as setting back
[1:55:12] on a picnic the land is a land of
[1:55:16] overcoming and in this land remember has
[1:55:20] Paul our beloved Paul would say
[1:55:23] I press toward the mark of the high
[1:55:28] calling of Christ Jesus my Lord you say
[1:55:33] old brother Paul said brother
[1:55:36] I count not myself to have apprehended
[1:55:39] but uh I seek after that I might
[1:55:42] apprehend that which I'm a pretend
[1:55:44] enough Paul recognize I've got a race
[1:55:48] that I'm running but I just jogging I
[1:55:51] ain't just running a race just be
[1:55:53] running with buddies I'm running a race
[1:55:55] to obtain the prize I bring in my body
[1:55:59] in subjection being temperate in all
[1:56:05] things decisions that I'm making on will
[1:56:10] this further my walk with God or will it
[1:56:15] hold me back you say you've got to make
[1:56:19] that decision each and every one of us
[1:56:21] have to make that decision day after day
[1:56:24] and moment after moment either you're
[1:56:29] gonna have take more ground or you're
[1:56:31] gonna lose ground but you're the only
[1:56:34] one that can determine that but there
[1:56:36] are promises I'll tell you this morning
[1:56:38] there are promises to be taken in God
[1:56:42] there's a promise of the body change
[1:56:48] there are promises to be obtained within
[1:56:51] this hour they are not things that are a
[1:56:55] pipe dream it's a reality promises that
[1:56:59] are real you say I wait till I get this
[1:57:01] and then I'll get real serious with God
[1:57:03] how about getting serious with God right
[1:57:04] now you keep putting it off you're let
[1:57:07] Pharaoh keep telling you you can worship
[1:57:09] in the land or maybe you can just go a
[1:57:11] day outside of the land but why don't
[1:57:12] you just draw the line this morning and
[1:57:14] say you know what I'm not just going
[1:57:16] just one day out to feast I'm going on a
[1:57:18] three-day journey I'm going all the way
[1:57:21] with the Lord all the way let's bow our
[1:57:27] heads
[1:57:28] dear Jesus Lord a place that's been
[1:57:37] prepared for us this nation that we live
[1:57:40] in warden I hear how your prophet would
[1:57:44] say it over and over still one of the
[1:57:48] greatest nations to live in the Lord
[1:57:54] where it's come to right now it's a
[1:58:00] place Lord God that we're looking to
[1:58:04] leave and not just hear of this nation
[1:58:08] but there's a bride all over the world
[1:58:11] Lord God that's being brought together
[1:58:14] in you the fulfillment of your word of
[1:58:18] Ephesians 1:11
[1:58:19] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:58:21] of times you would get there all things
[1:58:24] in Christ even one Lord it's you drawing
[1:58:30] and has drawn us together
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:35] Lord not in a club not as a gathering of
[1:58:40] people but in you in you
[1:58:47] or Jesus I asked this morning
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:53] Father on behalf of each and every one
[1:58:57] your God you know the needs throughout
[1:58:59] this assembling this morning I pray God
[1:59:03] if there's a longing in the heart
[1:59:06] there's a place for that longing to be
[1:59:10] fulfilled
[1:59:12] there's a deep calling there's a deep to
[1:59:14] respond Lord I pray this morning that
[1:59:19] God made that great libertine that great
[1:59:24] sounding of jubilee May had strike
[1:59:26] within the hearts I pray father that if
[1:59:31] there be any Lord where they've let
[1:59:34] Pharaoh talk them to just staying around
[1:59:37] in the land well they believe the
[1:59:40] message but they just they really
[1:59:42] haven't made a step they haven't stepped
[1:59:46] out they believe it by knowing that it's
[1:59:49] truth mentally but they haven't really
[1:59:52] made a step I pray this morning Lord may
[1:59:57] they take courage to know the Lord had
[2:00:00] sure desire but they would be free
[2:00:04] because just to have a knowledge is not
[2:00:07] freedom but Lord freedom is the person
[2:00:13] of Jesus Christ
[2:00:16] or maybe they've made a step out but
[2:00:20] they realized this morning I want to go
[2:00:23] all the way I want to go all the way and
[2:00:26] feast with my lord I want to open the
[2:00:31] door that he will come in because the
[2:00:36] latch I've got control over the latch I
[2:00:39] want to open the door to have a feast
[2:00:43] with my lord where he would come in sup
[2:00:48] with me and I with him hearts this
[2:00:52] morning the Lord throughout this
[2:00:53] building God our hearts tremble with the
[2:00:59] responsibility of this hour knowing that
[2:01:02] it's not upon iron our strength but it's
[2:01:07] us yielding
[2:01:09] [Music]
[2:01:11] there's a cloud of many witnesses around
[2:01:14] us they're Saints that's already
[2:01:20] gathered on the other side
[2:01:23] Lord God from down through the ages and
[2:01:26] some Lord that's been gathered over the
[2:01:29] years from around our ranks Lord
[2:01:34] they've already overcome their standing
[2:01:38] there in a body you prepared for them
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:44] they've lived for your coming as we're
[2:01:47] living for your coming
[2:01:50] lord I pray Heavenly Father this morning
[2:01:53] [Music]
[2:01:55] may we take courage may Lord God from
[2:02:00] within our hearts we stand fast in the
[2:02:06] Liberty realizing Lord that Satan does
[2:02:10] not come in like a firestorm but he
[2:02:14] comes in subtly he comes into weakened
[2:02:19] weakened weakened little by little by
[2:02:24] little the Bible says that Delilah
[2:02:28] pressed on Samson daily
[2:02:33] it says the same thing for Potiphar's
[2:02:36] wife regarding Joseph oppressed upon him
[2:02:42] Delilah wanted to know what's the secret
[2:02:44] of your strength Lord I pray this
[2:02:49] morning
[2:02:51] throughout this congregation God calls
[2:02:55] our hearts to reflect deeply are we
[2:02:59] still standing on the same ground that
[2:03:01] we've stood on when you got a hold of
[2:03:03] our life or are there things that we've
[2:03:11] compromised on under the heading of
[2:03:15] wisdom god help us I pray right now
[2:03:19] father is your tender mercy what poor
[2:03:22] God throughout this congregation Lord
[2:03:25] every one of our hearts Lord this is our
[2:03:30] heritage Lord got your word that you've
[2:03:34] delivered to us in this hour which is
[2:03:37] not a new word Lord
[2:03:38] it's the prophesied promise of this hour
[2:03:42] from the scripture Lord a restoring of
[2:03:46] the original Bible faith a land where
[2:03:52] the church had gotten out of but it's a
[2:03:56] land we've been brought back to Lord
[2:03:59] father I pray that from the depths of
[2:04:02] every heart may there be a real renewing
[2:04:05] here this morning Lord realizing we're
[2:04:11] in the fight the fight of our life the
[2:04:14] battle is on it's a heated engagement
[2:04:18] this is the greatest battle ever fought
[2:04:21] spoke in the Daniel chapter 12 a time of
[2:04:24] trouble such as there never was the
[2:04:27] battle that the Prophet would stand here
[2:04:29] in this time and say there's a battle
[2:04:31] that's fixin to be engaged here in a
[2:04:33] little while Lord we're right here in
[2:04:35] this time a time Lord God were this
[2:04:39] bride the second Eve is being tested
[2:04:45] Lord Jesus we need you Lord more now
[2:04:51] than we ever did him help us Lord from
[2:04:56] within our hearts or God made the vision
[2:05:00] be fresh wood may every decision Lord
[2:05:04] that's made may it be passed through the
[2:05:07] word filter may it be evaluated and
[2:05:10] looked at what would my lord same with
[2:05:15] this draw me closer to him or take me
[2:05:19] further away or God
[2:05:23] may every whispering voice of Pharaoh
[2:05:26] may it be broken from around the hearts
[2:05:29] of your people Lord and may father rise
[2:05:35] within the hearts to say I'm not just
[2:05:38] gonna stay here in the land I ain't
[2:05:40] going out just a little bit I'm going

[2:06:23] the one Lord that is set before him Lord
[2:06:27] and they seek after Oh God and

[2:07:17] church that that's not what makes it a
[2:07:20] church that's not what makes it a place
[2:07:23] of worship but it's hearts that have a
