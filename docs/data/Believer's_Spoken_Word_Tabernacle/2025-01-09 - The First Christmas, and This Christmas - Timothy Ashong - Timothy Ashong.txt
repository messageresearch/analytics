Pedraza family for Penny Pedraza and um they're going to have a a condolences and where the family and friends different ones can come through and um it's at the Andreas Crematory and funeral home it's off of Broadway we sent that out an announcement and uh with the address um and that's going to be from 5: to 7: tomorrow and so um maybe perhaps I don't know I don't think we sent it out by email because I really have switched from that but um we want to just just encourage you we we were there with uh brother Richie and sister paty uh the other night and we left out of there and I told my wife and I left out of there I said I'm the one that's left encouraged just the strength that you know that you you see within their within their lives and I tell you that's something right there that when you you you leave out of there you know it's you know it's the Lord and so they have been very very you know thankful for the prayers and have continued over the time not only when we were together but over the phone calls and things like that very thankful and says they know it's the prayers of the people and so we just we're so thankful to God for his mercy and I know all of those uh texts and things that's come in uh brother Richie had mentioned them as well as sister py and I want to say God bless you amen you know just to take the time out to send the text just to let them know you're praying to encourage them to phone call different ones that stop by God bless you richly amen for that um brother Richie and sister paty they're very they certainly mean a lot to us you know they're just they're just as a brother or sister and you know in the Lord and then you take all of their labor of love and the sacrifice and so we just want to support them tomorrow evening from 5:00 to 7:00 and the family uh will be gathered there uh also I wanted to mention to you and um um regarding I've sent I sent out different texts last week um because I've put together um uh a setup on telegram so that we can get out announcements and prayer requests and I've mentioned to I sent out to different ones and some of you really help me brother Drake you were pushing it all around uh you know and so we were just uh different ones getting everybody on board and the the purpose of that is with announcements and prayer requests where those can be pushed out to you and it's set up so that you don't have 50 60 70 responses of hand emojis thumbs up and so forth and that's because every one of us have enough text threads uh I've got I've got threads that I have to absolutely turn off at night because I'm connected with Brothers clear over around the world and all of a sudden I'd get at 2:30 in the morning this praying brother and you and it's not even it's for a different need from somebody over over in Sweden or whatever so you know how it is you have to silence those and when you're at work so the purpose is is just so that we can get announcements out quickly because really with email email is very Antiquated uh emails almost it's like the Pony Express now you know when we were trying to get out announcements for when we had to cancel a few weeks back the service my you're just hoping you get everybody covered and so we just there's announcements that come up if you um are not someone that maybe is techsavvy and you need help or assistance with that we've got brother Shane brother Brian and some of these young Brothers they certainly would be glad to help you but let's try to let's try to all get on to that because that's the main um thrust that I'm using to get things out announcements and and prayer request and so um if you see that someone's not on there in your family or or what have you so I'll just keep making the announcement I'll keep trying to contact but if you could help me out as well you see somebody that's not on the list say hey hey come on let's let's let's get on but I do there's Brothers here that can really that can help you um CU I know sometimes that can be a little bit overwhelming but that's that's the main tool that um that I'm going to be using to get things out to you so um let's just try to do that with the telegram and uh everybody okay okay um so we're so glad to have uh brother Timothy here with us and uh that he would make um make time to come by here and be with us it's not a very long trip that he's on and um he just had him and his wife just had their first grandbaby born on the third and so uh she left from here to go to Germany and then he'll be on Tuesday flying over to Germany uh to be with his son morai uh where they just had he has a a grandbaby a baby girl and so uh I thought there was a different anointing when I picked you up he was getting that Grandpa anointing uh but we sure love brother Timothy he's a real friend real brother in the Lord a real friend of this church amen amen let's just sing that song Amen Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by amen whatever your need is

wife a text and then we can get it processed and pushed out on that prayer request thread on telegram so um just type it out as you want it to be and then I'll I'll push it from there myself or my wife and we're just trying to get all of that just set up so I know there's been some that's already went out different requests and also announcements too so I just I wanted to make that known to you

lord strengthen us Lord Jesus to the glory of your name have your own way in our midst Lord in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray with faith and Thanksgiving amen God bless you let's stand to the Book of Luke Chapter 2 and say some few things Luke Chapter 2 The Gospel of St Luke Chapter 2 Luke Chapter 2 just to let's read from the gospel in Luke Chapter 2 and it came to to pass we are reading from verse one and it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the word should be taxed and this taxing was first made when serenus serenus was governor of Syria and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea onto the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his spouse wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth a firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the in may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word God bless you let's be seated praise the Lord hallelujah so it's always a privilege to be in the house of the Lord and a privilege to serve the Lord amen we love him because he first loved us and we are looking forward to the day when we shall see him face to face amen oh hallelujah what a day that will be so just to encourage ourselves this evening we want to speak on the first Christmas and this Christmas the first Christmas and this Christmas Hallelujah and the prophet of God said he said Christmas is here to stay it's here to stay and it will stay because it's here to stay amen and the prophet of God said I just wish it could be Christmas all the time Christmas is here to stay and the prophet of God said I just wish it could be Christmas all the time why and he said everybody seems to be so friendly around Christmas time wanting to help one another yes sir so the prophet said he wish it would be Christmas all the time and he said the fact and the fact of all this with all the error and everything that there is about it because as we have been taught and we know he was not Christ Jesus our lord was no born in December but thank God the whole world is celebrating name but we as Believers brother Bram said we don't celebrate Christmas we worship Christ he said the birth of Christ or the birth of Jesus is not to be celebrated he said you can celebrate the birthday of Lincoln or Washington or whoever it be but not Christ the C the birthday of Christ should be worshiped amen that's that's good praise the Lord and with all the error and everything there is something about it there is something about with all the error and the Santa Claus and whatever there is something about it he said God as God something in it you know hasn't he he has he's got something about it just the very name and the Very thought of the birth of the Lord Jesus Oh the word has put a Santa cross in his place sure but not to the Christian it is still Christmas they put a Santa Claus but to the Christian it's christas and the prophet of God said now where you say the rest of them all Santa Claus and go on like they do he said well we just must as well do it well no sir no this is not a pagan celebration to us this is a sacred hour if there has been no Christmas there would have been no Resurrection if there be no Christmas then it have been no love there's been no peace there's been no Hereafter for the believer if there has been no Christmas there will be no Hereafter for the Christian then there would have been no Resurrection for the Christmas and so Christmas is not a celebration to us is a worship to us no wonder that the wise men when they came they said we have seen a star and we have come to worship him so remember we are just speaking this evening on the first Christmas and this Christmas the prophet of God said God stands on the promised word for each New Year it stands on it this year to fulfill what he has got promised for this year whatever it is I want to be right in the center of his will Amen in the future like they did am there is a promise for this day for this year whatever I be I want to be part of it I we want to make ourselves ready we want to create the right atmosphere so that he can step in and fulfill his word for this age in your life in my life amen we should be looking forward we should be condition we should be prepared for him to do do what he has promised for this year in our lives remember this the first Christmas and this Christmas the prophet of God said nothing has changed he said God takes his man but not his spirit right he said the devil takes his man but not his spirit so then he told us it's like the man one morning I heard it a man got up early and went out and picked up the paper came back and sat down put his feet on his stable or D and whatever and his glasses on he begin to read the paper his wife said she was getting breakfast for him he said John anything new John anything new he said no the same old thing just new people yeah that's right murderess rape and everything somebody has done it see listen just new people just new people the same old thing the same old story but just new people so we are the new people in the block now anything new the first Christmas and this Christmas anything new no just new people amen are we together amen just new people and the prophet of God said listen God don't take away his Spirit the devil don't take away his spirit so the spirit that has been operating all these years at the first Christmas and this Christmas is the same just new people and a man's character is expressed through his Works he said a man's character is known by his Works he said that is why God used the spirit of Elijah upon Elijah upon Elisha upon John upon William Bram and that spirit is coming again but different characters or different people but how do you know that this is the spirit you watch the characteristics so he told us the very holy ghost that was upon Christ is the same holy ghost that comes upon the church yeah so by the expression by the manifestation then you will know the spirit that is at work May the Lord Jesus help us anything new no just new people at the first Christmas remember at the first Christmas there was Supernatural visitation there was a man called Zacharia and his wife Elizabeth there was a Simeon there was an Anna praise the Lord and the Bible told us at the firstr christas Zacharias a righteous man and his wife and he talk talk about their langage where they were coming from where Zacharia came from where Elizabeth came from and he said they were working according to all the Commandments and the ordinances of God the light they had in their day right we just read the scripture the scripture says so this man and his wife were righteous working according to the Commandment all the Commandments and the ordinances of God under the blood of boots and goats that's true that's and they live such a life until one day the great angel Gabriel came down to him in the temple and I want us to remember this that this man and this woman and the men of all ages have been men and women of like passions as we are remember they had their challenges they had their difficulties they had their trials they had their dis disappointments at the first Christmas this Christmas good and I want us to remember Zacharias was a priest being a priest does not exempt in from life challenges and the Bible said he they had no child for his wife was a bar so remember he said in those days it was a big reproach not to have a child so this righteous man and righteous woman had their own challenges at the first Christmas but I want you to remember this their challenges did not stop them from rending their services to almighty God and then remember and I thought of it what of is Zacharia did not go to church that day will not be reading the story like this despite his difficulty the Bible say it was his lot it was his time to minister and I said no it might be how Zakaria might have been praying for people because he stood between the people and God so I believe people might have brought their counsels or I mean their problems and their questions and their needs to the PRI right and I believe he might have prayed for many people without children and they got children that is so good that is so good and I believe he might have prayed for many women that were baren and they became fruitful and I believe in pray with people men with challenges impotency or whatever challenges and they might have got the answers because it's store between the people and God despite his difficulty despite his challenges he did not miss Services maybe the devil might have come to say hey what is the use of going to church you pray for this one that woman has brought baby for dedication you pray for this one what about your own wife physician heal yourself that's and I believe he had a lot of reproaches to go through right don't forget we are not Exempted from challenges and trials because you are faithful because you're a Believer because you are committed it does not exempt us from Life trials and life challenges sir are we together we are talking about the first Christmas and this Christmas yeah and I believe the same devil might be coming to him talking to him what's the point of going to church you pray for people look at this one there might be something wrong with you you pray for this one look at them look at what about your own wife there is something wrong with you remember the enemy the devil will never encourage you brother said one day when he lost sister hope he lost sister uh Mida I mean what's the son Charon Rose and sister hope he said the devil came to him he said he could not tell me there is no God right but he told me that God don't care for me he said look Billy you struggle from morning sometime brother pray for people for two weeks standing day night pray he said Billy what couldn't he do for you you pray for people and just like that he said look this problem of your wife and your child he could have just like this but look at his everywhere seem to be black he could not tell me there is no God but he convince me that God don't care for me and I want us to remember he's still doing that today he wants you to believe that God don't care for you he want you to believe all the time you've been going to church you give your tithe you give stress of it you are here and there there and there what has come out of that he want you to believe that look at your requests do have this request this request what has done that what has come out of that look at this one there look at this and he want you to believe that look that's it where to go to church because what have you enjoying and somebody else is not enjoying the word look at that one your neighbor is not even a Christian but look at how comfortable they are look at how peaceful they are look at him look at his children look at their look at this and that does it worth to go to church at all remember he's still doing that today yes sir so brother told us the greatest battle that is ever fought is for right here right and so I know he's still fighting that battle today the battle is still going on and he want to convince you that he does not care for you but remember God is always mindful like I say his mind is full of you [Applause] Hallelujah but the accuser of the Breen the discourager of the Breen the enemy of God and the enemy of God's people right he comes to let you know he doesn't care for you the first Christmas in this Christmas but thank God that despite the challenges of Zacharia and his wife he was faithful amen amen he was going to church and despite his challenges he was still praying for people it was his time to go to church it was his hour to minister to the people and pray for the people intercede for the people burn incense on their behalf hold their prayer before God lord hear the prayer of thy children Lord remember thy people Lord remember Israel Lord undertake for your people and remember remember a gift is to get yourself out of the way and he said brother said the gift is not for you it's for the people that's why Joseph interpreted dreams for people but his own dream he could not interpret it the first Christmas the angel came to Zacharia at the appointed time because God has a season God has a time and God has a purpose he does not forsake and he does not forget division is for an appointed time and at the end it will speak if it carries wait for it because it will not fail the prophet of God said God is not in hurry it's not in h we get impatience but God is he has a program so be patient be patient he will do it trust him yes sir that day Zakaria went to church he did not know that the the story will be changing that everything was going to be changed that day he's going to start a new book a new page is open a new story will be told his story was going to change his life was going to change his family was going to be changed he never knew that that would be right yes sir so don't miss church service hallu don't miss church service that's right come on now oh I don't feel like going to church today what of if that day Zakaria has said I don't feel like going to church today oh the other day the way the people were looking at me I don't want to go to church today that's so good oh I'm feeling depressed I don't want to go to church today oh if you come to feel that you recognize you are feeling depressed come to that's why you should come to church if you have known oh I'm depressed run to the house of God when you don't feel that is when you should be there because we are not leaning on our feet feelings we are not depending on our feelings we have an order from God not to forsake the assembling of our together as the man of some people have and they have air from the [Music] faith oh that God will help us this 2024 I would 25 I will not miss CH service I'll go you giv your heart the story told about one old lady and every he said she's even difficult for her to walk to just to go to church said but old lady oh man how you going you can take your steps he said you know what I do said when I get up first I send my heart to church I send my heart to church and my body follow it when my heart goes to church my body will go to church Hallelujah because where your Treasures are your heart will be there I send my heart to church and my body follows it once my heart is there my body will go all that this 2025 you'll be more determined than ever before amen then you put down excuses oh the way this one think about me the way this one is looking at me the way this no no no no no I'm not interested in that because I'm not coming here for anybody I not here for anybody it is an appointment with God it is an appointment with God and Jesus keeps all his appointments we have an appointment with him and remember even if nobody goes to church he's here and I'm here to meet him and he's here to meet us that is so good Zacharia oh my goodness listen saints of God sometimes you come to a place you feel so lonely as if nobody cares for us but that's just a feeling he cares for us he always cares and sometimes so nobody even encourages me that's true but if nobody encourages you encourage yourself [Applause] amen listen sints if you are depending on somebody to encourage you you'll be disappointed because that day you want somebody to encourage you that somebody is himself or might be having problem and that fellow needed some encouragement so if you are depending on me and I'm not able to do you be disappointed that's right maybe somebody slept on the wrong side that they on the bed pillow so he woke up already and you are depending on that fellow to tell you how are you oh he didn't even tell me happy birthday if nobody say happy birthday to you say it to yourself wish yourself happy birthday that's good pre wish yourself that's right when I was a child I behave as a child yes sir when I grew up and I became a man I put childish things away right be like that spring the prophet spoke about he said when you go hunting and this little spring every time is bubbling it's bubbling and he said one day look let us spring of I want to talk to you I want to talk to you I want to know why you are always happy he said is it because I came here to drink from you he said if that spring has mouth you say I appreciate you coming to drink from me but that's not what makes me happy or is it because the deer they come and drink out of you he said if he had a mouth he would say I appreciate and come but that's not what makes me happy there is something Ben there is something Beyond me there is a power from the bottom and that bubbles up bubbling keeps me alive keep me happy keep me joyful keep me always [Applause] rejoicing that a Christian word he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water that is so good depend on the Lord for your joy for your peace for your happiness thank God for mothers thank God for fathers thank God for husband thank God for wives but remember if you depend on your wife and your husband and Mama and Papa Mama didn't wish me this maybe mama papa forgot Mama is having problem papa is having problem husband is having problem somebody is in pain somewhere the joy of the Lord is our strength let the joy of the Lord be your strength there you go [Applause] [Music] yes cast your mind put your trust in the Lord rejoice and again I say rejoice we should be happy people that's right that's right we should be thankful to the almighty God oh this 2025 Lord help me to lay aside every foolishness help me to lay aside every selfishness help me to lay aside every canity anything that easily beset us that makes us unhappy that makes us s from path the path of righteousness anything that makes me to make God unhappy we want to make the king happy brother bham said Jesus wants to be entertained he wants to be entertained properly that is so good your lord my Lord Our Savior Our Redeemer right want his subjects to entertain him to make him happy Hallelujah yeah all the first Christmas there was a lawyer Zacharia and his wife Elizabeth that were committed to the C of Christ to serve the Lord walking remember despite their challenges they were working according to the ordinances of the Lord think about it if he had not gone to church that day right that's right that's so good but there was something God had for him brother Bram said sometimes like he was speaking about Abraham and Sarah he said the day the angel of the Lord came the Lord came in Elohim came when that three visitors came in when Abraham said I've taken upon myself though I'm fresh and blood but I've taken up to speak to the most high God he said that morning Satan knowing that there was coming a visitation he made Sarah to force what did Sarah said she went out he said came back not talking and maybe AB say how was the market ma hello ma what's wrong what happened I've been telling you that we should check what we believe since saidah left lot and the wife left the church do you see how they are prospered so I went I met lot in the market today with men carrying a briefcase for her how many trolleys or whatever it was unloaded with Goods look at our cars and our C they are starving to death and we say we are right we say we are the Believers he said the enemy was trying to hinder them for the visitation you remember the at ere you create is very important we want to create the right atmosphere at home that's why when we come to church you think some service is for nothing it's for something we are creating an atmosphere when we begin to see all things possible Lord I be we are creating an atmosphere when we begin to sing we are creating an atmosphere brother Bram said the angel of the Lord he likes that son only believe wow so when we begin to sing and we are worshiping we are creating an atmosphere and it is the atmosphere that brings the results so when you create a FY atmosphere at home Prophet say you drive the spirit of God away you drive him away he said because he's timid the Holy Spirit you drive him away by your behavior and your attitude and your conduct and your words you speak see he just step oh that we welcome him we create the atmosphere for him Lord we have been waiting for you this 2024 let whatever has gone in the past be gone but this time this

it said HH you are saying what oh my God how can I swallow this I love this sister I love her nice but how can I believe this how am I going to explain it you don't need any explanation you just need to believe even if you cannot explain it believe it how is he going to explain it an angel spoke to her and so she has conceived can you explain it what is the scientific proof about that nothing but at that first Christmas Joseph stood with Mary right it is hard to explain what you are saying right the Bible say he was minding to put are we Mar say no disassociate say quietly I don't believe the message I don't want say Joseph son of David Don't Be Afraid right believe his story right believe what she's telling you and thank God at that first Christmas Joseph stood with her right right he identify himself amen amen with the word made flesh in that hour he went through reproaches they went through reproaches at the first Christmas but they stood there who stands today this Christmas for him to Bear the reproach of the word you believe something you cannot explain yes I believe it because I know it is the word of God Amen at the first Christmas and then again at the first Christmas there was a decree from Caesar Augustus right everybody should go oh my goodness everybody should go why and Mary was Heavy she was packing the word made flesh right am yes in a woman was Emmanuel because the angel said You shall conceive you shall bring forth a son his name Shall be Called Emmanuel God With Us and so carrying Emmanuel everything should have gone fine backing Emmanuel everybody should have bowed before her hello sister hello God bless you no she was despised at the first Christmas nobody want to do anything with her why because of Emmanuel in the womb because of the revealed word because of the visitation of the Holy Ghost at the first Christmas and so it is this Christmas Hallelujah amen are we together who is on the Lord side who will stand for him amen at the first Christmas remember Spirit don't die am right remember the same things there new people right that's right there new people Mary and Joseph has to go what is all this how you thought she's a Believer and they believe the message many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord will deliver him from all and God hands was in that too right Mary and Joseph even the king might not even know what he was doing but God knew what it is because the heart of the king is in his hands the kingdom of men God rules in the Affairs of men it does not matter who is in the white house or blue house or green house it does not matter what nation or which of the nation we are coming from right you might not like the one that is there I might not like it but God is in it all because there must be a pharaoh that God rais up and God is in control of everything that is happening today in America in the Middle East and the west and whatever there is somebody that is our God who controls everything so be at peace with yourself the first Christmas and this Christmas and remember this we must be where he want us to be right it's word to be fulfilled right if you are not there he will force you to be there so you better line up before you are forced to line Mary and Joseph were out of place they thought where we are here is fine for us he and then no no no no no it has been prophesied where the Messiah will be born and so all that was happening was to force them to go where they have to be because when you are in the vision you must be where the vision want you to be brother had a vision he has to pray for a sick child and he has to do some things some certain things might be at certain places he cannot tell the people he went to the house I think the little C or the little daughter or whatever and then he went there and out of compassion he did not wait for the vision right right he went ahead of the vision he took the baby pray right he realized I've made a mistake I should have wait for the vision Lord have mercy upon me I've been very foolish he cannot tell anybody because the vision must speak that's right right and if God give the vision he has to work it out if your dream is from God leave it God will work it out you don't force anything and they stand there and then the brother said oh I want to go if this brother lives something will be out everything must be how it has to be listen there is nothing too hard for God to do no no no no no no no no leave God's work into God's hands don't go ahead of him we are not wiser we are not smarter that that is so true grandama must come from here and take a lens and try what has that God to do but that's the vision as he saw in the vision it must be that way right so Grandmama you are needed grandpaa you are needed your man your everybody is needed we must be in our place maybe you missing church service that day will cause embarrassment to the church you not be where you should be we have fed the church being out of your place we AFF the church being late we AFF first the church being impatient we have fed the church are we together amen may God help us we want to prepare ourselves we want to consecrate ourselves so that the Lord will step in the first Christmas amen and this Christmas when grandama came in from the back and this one yeah the vision is complete now so your position my position our position is important to God find your place in the house of God what do you want me to be where you want me to sitall Lord help me I don't want to be out of place I don't want to be there may God help us we line up for him then the glory of the Lord will be made manifest Joseph and Mary and God was in it they didn't no and brother said Mary must be on this donkey and this donkey stum here and there oh and she was pking the word right Emmanuel oh because I believe the message everything should be fine he didn't promise that he promised Grace no matter what you will go through he promised Grace sufficient Grace sufficient Grace hallelujah amen amen the first Christmas there was Grace right and God made it the way that every law every place was locked they were forced to go to the stable it was not their wish it was not their intention but the word of God must be fulfilled right Bethlehem the least of the tribe out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule over my people listen every word will be fulfilled every word of God will be fulfilled every promise that God made he will fulfill it may God give us Grace Just to be where he want us to beise the Lord why was he born in the stable because he was a lamb his first convert were shepherds they were the first converts when he was born the Shepherds were at the backside taking care of that that's why he was not born in December was not born in December because if it is December they will not have been in the cold with snow and the angel of the Lord appeared to them he said hey you are here something has happened go back go to Bethlehem the Savior has been born the Savior has been born on the first Christmas it was Shepherd that received the message at the first Christmas and the Bible say the host of Heaven came down and they sang they worshiped the Lord when the word was born there was worship there was celebration why God and man as United Jehovah has come into His creation all the bridge has been he came to brid the Gap to unite man and God to bring relationship at the first Christmas and this Christmas is the same hallelu at the first Christmas there was a Sor L by the Holy Ghost it was revealed to him he was not going to die until he sees the Lord Christ even though he was blind he was led by the Holy Ghost to the word made flesh at the first Christmas and this Christmas the Holy Ghost will lead every seon to the word made flesh this Christmas at the first Christmas there was Hannah an old woman the Holy Ghost led her though she was blind physically but not spiritually the Holy Ghost LED them to the word made flesh those that are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God this Christmas too the Holy Ghost will lead God's elect Hallelujah to the word I'm just trying to cross my L at the first Christmas there was wise man and this Christmas there are wise men and Wise Women and wise boys and wise right all right way back in the East way back somewhere they

were they the only ones steadying the Stars no there were others but God reveals himself to whom he wills at the first Christmas God revealed himself to whom he will this Christmas is the same all throughout the ages is the same not he that willth or he that run but God that showeth Mercy H amen amen and the Bible said they saw that star they knew the Messiah is on the earth something has happened when something is happening on Earth is happening in heaven he gave signs the first Christmas in this Christmas they said let us go and see when the Angels reveal the secret to the shephers they said let us go and see when God reveals to you you will not just sit down you'll be stimulated by Revelation oh you will not keep quiet you will move you will get out of your starchiness and coldness amen when God is revealed to you you is stimulated you cannot hold your peace they move out let's go they left everything right we want to go and see what has been revealed to us when the woman that where met Jesus she left a PO water pot I cannot she went to the town Hallelujah shouting and screaming come I see a man who has toldo me isn't this the Messiah at the first Christmas and this Christmas list in the wise man that is why they were wise because they follow the star the stars appears in the night Hallelujah and they and they travel through the night think about it right there was no street light like we have today no street light no pave RS and no no Super Highway always know but when God is revealed to you something is in your heart you don't care about what you will go whatever it cost you will go amen oh Hallelujah at the first Christmas they travel for two years that's right traveling in the night watch the star okay listen through the jungles through what you call it swamps area mountains and hills and and valleys and trouble trouble trouble upon trouble difficulties upon difficulties at the first Christmas this Christmas oh sometime we have so many troubles brother Braham said that it seems that when we become Christians we have more problems than when we were not Christians following that star traveling through the night sitting on their H H camel and I said those men were real man to own a camel back there even today is not a small thing even if they rented came for two years how long do you rent your cars that's good that's good even if they rented it for two years what just to attend one service just to worship the king we have seen a star in the east we have come to worship him that was their Vision that was their purpose that was their Revelation to worship him that's all right and it took them two years traveling right and they thought oh my goodness when they got to Jerusalem said this is the big city that's the big church the pope is there let's consult the Pope the AR Bishop let's consult them we are in the big city and they went there and they had no news they didn't know nothing about it what are you talking about and they look at at these people Fanatics holy rulers because they were shouting everywhere why is he that is born King of the Jews and remember this were not just wishy-washy they were dignities they they were Royals dignities with their robes we are sinen said what are you talking about there is a king here they took to ER said no no that's not we are talking about the king of the Jews and they no no no this one we just got the light we got the revelation of it that he's just born that's right and they tried to they said no no no no no we saw the star are you sure are you sure you have not been misled or you are you know under you know hallucination or whatever you call it or you know something wrong say no no no we have seen the star we followed it and oh my goodness when they came to Jerusalem they lean on their own understanding they thought it would be here this a church this man know about it and when they lean on their own understanding they got confused that's why many of our people have gotten confused with all kinds of doctrines and all kinds of ideas follow the star Hallelujah don't guide the star let the star guide you don't tell the star what to do let the star lead you you don't guide the guide you don't instruct the guide the guide is the leader follow the Holy Ghost the sty of Bethlehem at the first Christmas the sty of Bethlehem was leading them until they lean on their own understanding and they almost lost their lives that's why many of our people are confused today because they want to know what Kenneth Haan said H what this brother said here I want I I'm not interested in that like I said if you want to know God you don't ask siral to Siri who is God Siri doesn't know God you can ask Siri show me I want to go to mcdonal ask Siri about God he doesn't know about William brah he doesn't know so to know God do not come Siri or Alexi he must come by Revelation he might come about the Holy Ghost if you want to know ask the Holy Ghost when they got to Jerusalem they went to the Bible they found there Bethlehem that's where the governor will be coming oh he's there oh yes it's already there set the creatures and then you think you have they are they that testify of me the first Christmas then I said why didn't all of them when they saw that the thing was already in the scriptures why didn't all of them let's go and look for it yeah because all is there the Messiah why didn't all of them go but it was not given to them it was not given to everybody thank God for your eyes for They Se amen for your years for the year for it is given to you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom hallelujah amen oh praise the Lord the first Christmas in this Christmas think about it they went out of pharaoh herod's house and the Bible and the star appear again oh there's a star and the Bible say they Rejoice andly wow that's the St that's the message that's it oh praise the Lord hallelujah you can think I'm crazy but that's fine that's only your thinking we have seen a star we have come to worship me I am here to Worship the Lord I am here to glorify him I am here to Magnify Him I am here to let you know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we his subjects we worship him we is subject we identify with him at the first Christmas and this Christmas amen they went out to look for him and the star appeared again and the star begin to lead them and the star begin to lead them and they just keep following that star and they just keep following that star the star LED them to the word made flesh right yes and the star will always lead us to the light to the sun the star LED in to the sun of the Living God Emmanuel after two years almost two years journey and think about it when they came to Jerusalem I mean when they left the came to Bethlehem the star stood in that house enter here God here amen and I said how do they know him maybe there were many people in the house many young people in the house J said I don't know him but he that sent me to baptize he gave me a sign and I believe God gave them a sign yes maybe there were other children around the house here and there think about it the first Christmas think about it Jehovah as a boy Jehovah running around Jehovah playing around Jehovah playing with his friends at the first Christmas great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justify in the spirit SE of angels on to the Gentiles what a mystery super sign and think about it hallelujah hallelujah I don't get any twoyear boy here any boy that is two years think about it and this dignities when they came in the star this is he this is he maybe there were other children there but said this is it we want this son we want this the king of the Jews we want the king of the Jews what are you talking about because that was their message the king of the Jews where is he and they came say this is the king of the Jews Oh Glory this is the king what is happening what is what has become of these people and everybody might be looking we the king of the the Jews the king of the Jews Jehovah as a two years boy wow and this men with their robs yeah and they saw that twoyear boy wow and they worship him they bow before him they pay homage to him what is what is happening when the word is being you there is an attraction what was the attraction over there what was the attraction the elect of God theyve seen the word they've seen the light they C the Revelation they found Christ and they don't care about anybody's thinking anybody's feeling anybody's idea whatever whoever look at them whoever think they were crazy they don't care about that they found him they found him we are seen him no wonder Philip said na come we have found it that Moses spoke about we have found in the Messiah the king of the Jews oh no wonder who has believed our report to whom has the hand of God been revealed if you are believ it today is because it's revealed hallelujah hallelujah it must reveal to them that this is the king of the Jews and when it is revealed to you you don't care about nobody whether Mama believe or Papa don't believe whether whoever you

TI two years this one giv go this is for you sir and this one brought right Frank ases right and this one brought me it was all presented to Jesus to the Child Jesus to the boy Jesus to the little

if you see the light you worship him you don't care what anybody says you worship him no wonder brother say he goes to the Wilderness he goes to the Ws and then he there he said I begin to Worship the Lord and I go around the three and I run run run and I oh I run run run just worshiping the Lord Lord let me read this and try and close hallelujah amen the first Christmas in this Christmas Amen brother Bram said who we stand with me who will stand with me he said in this hour who will stand with me like the Warriors of David the Warriors of David when David said I desire fresh water from the world of Bethlehem and he said some of the soldiers heard it sir you said you want water from B says I I get fresh water from betham and they pulled their Sals and they took a backet and they fought they 40 miles they jeopardized their lives they rescue I mean they they jeopardize their lives they sacrifice their lives because the king want fresh water right the king need a service they fought in and out and sometime we have to fight Christianity is a fight in and out so not easy to even come to church you have to fight it's a fight Footprints means possession right that's right they brought the water to the king and David said this is too much for me this is blood of those men I will not drink it I will give it to Jesus I'll will give it to my king they brought it to their King I give it to my king our King deserves worship he want worship David thrw it down he says Lord I give this to you who will give all to the King today this Christmas praise the Lord oh Lord help me we ought to give the most enest Eed to the things which we have had what type of people ought we to be when when we see the great Jehovah come down and do the things that he does and see them compared scripture by scripture that they are the truth and we sit around sometimes like a wat on a log and just so unconcerned we ought to be busy every minute trying to get people to Christ we ought to be live Stones we should never be slothful like we are we go up to church and we see the Lord Jesus do something or bless us in such a way and then we go back out and then we oh very nice meeting now the preaching of the word we enjoy it but that's not the main thing that's not we should not Worship the Lord just after we get through preaching preaching the word as we usually do just worship him that's wonderful but we should worship him every hour of our life but we should worship him every hour of our life when we are at work we should worship him every time the opportunity present itself Worship the Lord by testifying of him right if you see some if you see some some of you ladies see a woman in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking air and saying sister there is a better life than this you men at your work when you hear a man using the name of the Lord in vain get a chance to one side and slip over and take him by the hand and say you there is better life than this you shouldn't use those words and tell him in make Gentle Way all those things is worship all those things is worship we ought to Worship the Lord by telling them there is a God Of Heaven that answers prayer he say here let's say he said and tell them in Meek Gentle Way all those things is worship and when we see someone sick and the doctor says there is no more can be done we ought to Worship the Lord by telling them there is a God Of Heaven that answers prayer and then when we see those things take place that we do see take place and then we should never let let those things slip we just let it go through our fingers that's what the matter with the great Pentecostal church today they've let the very cream of the crop slip through their fingers the first Christmas and this Christmas who is on the Lord side brother Bram said he want fresh experience of the original Pentecost back to the original Pentecost back to where you can say for me to live is Christ and to die is G the first Christmas in this Christmas who worship the king he wants to be worshiped he wants to be entertained who else will entertain him than his wife than his bride than his people God bless you God be with us let's draw closer to him let's be more committed to him don't be playing Church don't be fully with the things of God the king must be entertained the king must be worshiped the wise men will always worship

Christmas and this Christmas amen it was a wonderful message tonight wonderful message tonight you man to realize brother br will take that you realize as you the amount of messages that brother Brad would preach around around Christmas and and dealing with that that part of it you know to me you you know how I feel I look at the example what was spoken through the messenger and you look at his life and to think of how that brother Timothy was bringing that out many different statements that brother brandham had made I mean you can go through a whole service after service but to put it back to what what it really comes back to you know we we can't be I'm not responsible for what all the world has done but it's like brother Brandon when he preaches that message impersonation Christianity he charges us with the responsibility as parents as as Christians to put it on the right emphasis and know oh we we understand that but to think think of what it is he said we're not worshiping Christ in a Manger that's right is Christ in you hallelujah it's Christ in me and when you think you think of brother Brandon would bring it down so fitting he said how he was born in a stinking stable yes place that was totally unfit for a king to be born in and he said that is the same way of each and every one of our lives our lives were stinking messes not fit for a king but aren't you glad that he looked beyond our faults Hallelujah that I I can worship I can speak how Great Is Our God that God came not that we were worthy we never became Worthy on our own it's him it's his worthiness amen oh aren't you grateful for the grace of God Amen just a just even a greater determination to persevere to be in the house of God and then even when we get here persevere beyond our feelings persevere Beyond self and say Lord I've come here for one purpose my life life is for one purpose and that's to worship you that's to worship you I'm not going to I'm not cuz you realize you can worship you can worship according to the dictates of your flesh and we could give into our flesh but I'm not going to let my flesh I'm not going to let my flesh I want to worship God I want to I let let my son go let my daughter go that he might worship me hands you were made to raise my feet you were made to walk you were made to carry me not the feet is not over me as a son and daughter of God this is a temple
