moving it's been God working in our lives to him we give glory amen there's nothing that we can glory in you know even any any movement that's been made in obedience we can't take credit for it it's God's grace God's grace that he would have our heart in a condition to be able to catch where he's leading us so it all comes down to his glory and I'm so grateful it just brings us to more of a realization our dependency on him and we see our littles but all how we can see his greatness how we love him don't we love him God is so good friends it's so good amen we want to go right into the word tonight just if you'll turn with us to Deuteronomy nine will keep you standing very long Lord willing tried to finish this thought here this evening Lord willing brother John LaFontaine will be here with us on Sunday so you would just just keep him in prayer and also keep me in prayer I just got a call yesterday and just asked to be to fill in for one of the Brethren at the youth retreat that is not going to be able to make it and so if you would just be in prayer God knows and Lord willing I'll be doing the morning sessions and just teaching and so I was just just numbing for myself but the whole camp if you just just keep us in prayer that God will just move in a very very special way he already knows every need you believe that he knows every need and he knows just how to minister to the needs of his children and and we just pray that God will just pour out of his spirit and bring life to hearts that are in need of life bring encouragement to those that's discouraging that he himself who is the answer that he'll just make himself known amen let's just read here in Deuteronomy 9 verse 23 likewise when the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea saying go up and possess the land which I have given you then you rebelled against the commandment of the Lord your God and you believed him not nor hearken to his voice you have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew you thus I fell down before the Lord forty days and forty nights as I fell down at the first that is a paradox right there did you catch that I fell down as at the first the first time that my heart was moved to intercede it hasn't wavered even up to this time now there's been a lot of things that took place up till this time right here there's just a huge leap that has taken place but Moses is letting it be known as I fell down at the first because the Lord had said he would destroy you I prayed that word means to intervene mediate go in on one's behalf I prayed therefore unto the Lord and said O Lord God destroy not thy people and thine inheritance which thou has redeemed through thy greatness which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand remember thy servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin aren't you glad that there's there's something present that's able to turn his attention how many's glad for the token of the Holy Ghost in your life how many's glad for the blood that's Abel that that captures his attention and he says I see the desire of your heart Oh aren't you glad for that lest the land wench twin style broadest us I'll say because the Lord was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them because he hated them he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness yet they are thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by the eyes stretched out on may God bless his word bless you as you're being seated so good to be together this evening last week we you were examining once again on the intercessory prayer and you see the very heart of Christ here as we Moses is relying this to the generation that is preparing to cross over God's been building their faith there has been testimonies that are being developed and I guess God is building their faith God is also putting the dread of them upon the other in the inhabitants there of the land but Moses is letting him know that he doesn't he's not boasting in himself but he's letting him know if it wasn't for the mercy of God you wouldn't even be here but you see Moses himself knew the mercy of God he knew it by personal experience because he himself one had went away and he had lost the vision so Moses himself you know by an experience you know he knowing the grace of God and the depth of God's redemptive grace as far as what could be known in that time he was able to stand there on behalf of the people and I think as we have so rightfully looked at this here at different intervals of time that we know that it takes more than just our our ability to be able to intercede on behalf of one it really takes the Spirit of God on the inside when I I look at those scriptures where when Paul would admonish the believers and Ephesians and Colossians and the other places and he would say to forgive even as Christ has God as has given you forgiving you for Christ's sake the even as that's that's a tall task and when Paul would go on to say in Colossians 3 I believe it is put on therefore as the elect of God holy bowels of Mercy and he goes on to speak of having a core among you forgiving even as Christ has has forgiven you that that's something that takes some that takes something greater than our ability and I believe that's where Paul could say put on therefore as the elect of God it's a sinking that word means to sink into an adornment that is present and I believe that that is present in our life if we have been born of the Spirit of God we have access to that garment of forgiveness to that of the mercies of God but it requires us to just surrender and just to sink into that and that's something that is greater than our abilities it's greater than our words it actually takes a sovereign work of Almighty God you realize - even for your sins and my sins to have been forgiven it has taken a sovereign work of God's grace and that's the same thing it takes within the lives of each and every one of us it takes a sovereign work of God and this is a sovereign work of God that it's taking place in Moses heart according to the promise of God and to see this tonight I want to drop it like this that the love rhythm says God seen the love that Moses had for these people it was the love of God that it was so rightly placed I want you to so hold on to that now it was so rightly placed in Moses life so that it was not just a word that Moses knew but it this was the very God the very life of the promised Christ himself he who was veiled in the fire in the bush that same life that same God who spoke the promise that same life and heart of the promise was pulsating through Moses life Moses was yoked and United with that promise and to see that we you know when we look at that that realizing that when Moses interceded he was interceding according to the plan and will of God that had been spiritually revealed to him and Denis he he would pray and he would intercede remember there was a mixed multitude that came up out of Egypt Moses was an ignorant of that that there were people who were just present who were just there who were just traveling along and yet in the midst of it you see down through each part of the journey that you'll see that different things will come out and the Bible says they complained against God they complained against Moses and then we took a little bit last week and we looked at that in numbers 21 where that here they spoke against Moses spoke against God God sent fiery serpents down and it's it bit them and there were those who died but then there were those who rose up and said Moses we have sinned against the Lord and it's speaking also against you pray to the Lord for us and the Bible says Moses prayed or he intervened interceded on their behalf you see it's always something when you look at it that here when two people come to the realization that they were wrong there was mercy for them if they were willing to ask for that mercy I don't know about you tonight but I want to be humble enough to realize that I need God's mercy every day of my life and to recognize that there are things that as brother Brennan would place alike this that we stagger into ignorantly there's things where we make mistakes not willfully there are things that we need God's grace and at that time thank God that there's conviction that strikes our heart when things are wrong and we can rise up and we can look to the Lord and say Lord I'm asking for your mercy Lord please forgive me you realize what a high price that is to be able to look to God and to be able to ask God for forgiveness you know why you ask God for forgiveness is because a life is pulsating within you that desires to be pleasing to the Lord and anything that is Grievous or somewhat of an offense any way that you think this I maybe I've said this wrong where I've looked at this wrong and this could be displeasing to him because within our hearts our desire is to police him in all points and it all matters and you know brother Graham called that about our life he said that's attention that belongs to the believer he said you know being a Christian he said you don't really relieve tension but rather you add tension to your life and he likens it to that of an automobile going down the road and he talks about the belt you know that would be around the different pulleys on the engine if that belt breaks on your car you're not going to go anywhere I don't care how much power that you got in that car but brother mem says that belt it's lack of attention upon a believer he said in the tension to a believer he said it's not a bad thing it's actually a blessing and he said because what it is it brings us to this place Lord am i pleasing to you and he said we find ourselves asking that question daily you know why because it matters to you it matters that you're policing to him yet you just don't want to take things for granted we want to walk pleasing to him because we realize every moment in this life we've got to make every moment count and we need his help there's a goal that we're after we're not just people gathered here tonight that are just coming around a church and and become part of a some sort of a system or a society but we are a part of the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we've got a promise that's burning within our heart a promise of deliverance and that song we suddenly see the signs of the time that are all around us it's something within us that's a groaning that's a desiring for a relief from this walk from this life that we're in yet were filled with joy of the Lord in our soul but yet there's a desire and a longing to be with him and he knows that that's why he came back and he deposited his life within you and I so that we might be where he is and I think of this of how that when Moses would pray you know it took prayer itself prayer is not just something that you would do or we would do based upon just what we see but prayer itself when we look at intercessory prayer it is that where there is eyes or site that looks beyond the present circumstances and it looks to God who made the promise and knowing that the present circumstances that it's all in God's hands that God is more than able to turn those circumstances around and you're able to intercede on the behalf of others needs I'm talking about things that you and I we would like to try to engineer with our hands sometimes we may feel we can change this or change that but there's only one thing that can really change things and that's gone he's the one that changed our life and you and I can look at that and we'd realize prayer just like in this situation it changes things so when I think of it here in terms of looking at Israel coming out of Egypt they're delivered by the mighty hand of God and how that many of them were kept there were many that died along the way but there was a seed there was a group of people in whom God knew and when he made the promise he made it with them in mind and look within it you find that how the Lord Jesus here in John 17 when he makes a great prayer of intercession here here is the very perfect sacrifice himself and he speaks in John 17 sick he said I manifested thy name unto the men which thou gave us me out of the world dying they were and thou gave us them me and they have kept that word they have known that all things whatsoever thou has given me are thee for I have given unto them the words which thou gave us me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did it send me look at this in verse nine I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou has given me for they are thine you recognize that the redemptive work of Calvary was for the elect in mind bill man lays this very clear with predestination he said predestination is not God simply choosing and picking out now but it's what he already elected and chosen from the foundation of the world and that choosing was not like picking kickball teams on the playground you were chosen because you were in him you were always a part of him you're a part of that word which is him he knew what bit of time where you would live when you would be born he knew all of those things and to think that the redemptive work of the Lord Jesus Christ the redemption as the Prophet tells us and who is this Melchizedek Redemption he said is with the elected in mind because it is the son of man who came to seek and save that which was lost and you know how Jesus lays it out in the parables in Matthew 13 then he breaks over I believe in Luke chapter 11 and he talks about the parable of the prodigal son he was always a son he was always an eagle he was always the Sheep but remember he made a choice and went astray lacked what happened back in the garden but more but upon this moment mother mam tells us that there was a mama and a daddy that was praying for him and they knew he had went wayward and brother brems so glory brother Babel said well that mom and Daddy were gathered in that living room praying for that boy he said the angel of the Lord began to move as that prayer was being offered up he said the angel the Lord went to that Pigpen right where that boy was that I believe that was on my heart I'm a living witness of that the angel of the Lord went down there and begin to deal with that boy's heart and begin to close him to think about his father's house it began to cause him you see where he was drawn before his physical body ever left the Pigpen all my I know sometimes it looks discouraging because you can still see him in the Pigpen but remember there's got to be something move and turn their heart while they're in the Pigpen and it's gonna be that ritual turn and eventually you see him leave the Pigpen it's God the angel of the Lord he's moving on that prayer why because that prayer is in intercession according to the promise that day and their offspring shall be there with them believe believe in the Lord Jesus Christ and die in the house shall be saved those are promises that you're able to take their before the throne of God and the age of the Lord is there to make good upon those promises that's what God said that's his promise to us and to think of how that the Lord Jesus would lay this out with Redemption plan that it's all about bringing back to himself those whom were lost in the beginning now when you look at this this is the elect of where that Jesus would go on to say here in the scriptures all mine are thine and dine on mine and I am glorified in them you see Jesus is not glorified in just the righteous ones but glorified is where the full honor the full dignity the full reality of who he is is made known in that of the elect believer in this hour you understand me it brings I would suggest this it brings you and I to such a responsibility because you don't know who are your life who it's touching and who it's effective there's many people that will not read the Bible or haven't read the Bible but read your life and they know there's something different about it what is that that is the very glorification of the Lord Jesus Christ the supreme sacrifice that has ascended to the mediatorial seed and sit back down the Holy Ghost to bring in reality through your life there has come Redemption there is deliverance there is victory there is a complete victorious life in Jesus Christ what is that it's a Holy Ghost in your life that has given you power and dominion over sin to where you're able to bring your body and subjection and your life is a billboard of God's amazing grace so he's glorified in them now verse 11 said I'm no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to the Holy Father keep through thine old name whom those whom thou hast given me that they may be one as we are one so here's intercessory prayer the prayer of intercession is that the people be united that every elect child of God be united I hope you're with me tonight we recognize that the elect of God let me say like this being elect of God you never can you never could and you weren't on your way to hell you might have been going down that pathway but remember really for every human being the Bible says that hell was not created for human beings it was created for the devil and his angels is that right but to see this right here that even in the midst of it the elect of God the Lord Jesus look at the attitude that he took he never just took it as it was something for granted but he prayed for those thou hast given me that they may be one even as we are one his desire was for fellowship this was the request that he made think of it this is the request that he made before he ever made the request at the end of Matthew and in through John about let this cup pass from me he asks for our fellowship because he wanted to be one with us I tell you Moses just did not have a burden to bring the people out in the wilderness but remember the burden in his heart whereas he Moses I think in Exodus 15 when the spirit of prophecy began to move on his life and victory had come up the Bible says that Moses spoke to the Lord and as he was singing out he said Lord until that people be passed over until that people be passed over Oh Lord thou has brought them out and thou shall plant them in the land you recognized the spirit of prophecy knows no defeat that's why in the Church of the Living God that he reveals himself in a Sevenfold manner there in revelations 1 that they had the testimony of Jesus Christ what is the testimony of Jesus Christ it's the very name of the Lord Jesus Christ revealed in by the presence of his word the Holy Spirit taking his word and revealing that divine nature and you and I are called by that same name glory be to God the testimony of the Lord Jesus Christ notice while I was in the world I kept them in thy name those that thou gave us me I have kept and none of them is lost but the son of perdition that the scripture might be fulfilled and now I come to thee that these things I speak in the world that they might have joy fulfilled in themselves so to see how that when the Lord Jesus ascended up there from Mount Olives and the disciples turn to go back to Jerusalem as they went back to Jerusalem here he was moving to the me to toil work he's already been presented as the sacrifice already been accepted it's he'd already rose from the grave now here he goes to intercede on behalf of the promise because he went there you and I were in him there when he rose from the grave we got up with him we were represented in him who is the word and he went there to intercede on the media toriel work when John looked there in Revelations for he saw one that sat on the throne in Revelations 5 when John was told to look and see when John began to weep he said John look the Lion of the tribe of Judah he had prevailed to take the book and loosen the seals they're out recognizing that that is for this hour the time that you and I were living in that when intercession itself is just about closing out when the rapture itself has come that intercession time is over because when he leaves the intercessory box the same seat that is a seat of Mercy will become a judgement seat when the blood is no longer there and that's why at the very heart it pulsates the within our lives even as we look concerning our loved ones and concerning really anybody you look up on lives you look on hearts that you come in contact with on your job or at your restaurants or different places there's something about it that burns in your heart that you see people in situations and you look and you say there is some there is an answer here that is able to minister to their life because it's something about your life in my life it's filled with life that's beyond this life and you know there's an answer that burns in your heart no matter the travesty and everything that has taken place there is indeed a healing in the Lord Jesus Christ until you in this hour there's more hurt people than you can shake a stick at but I'm glad they're still balm in Gilead I'm so glad about that he's seated on the mercy seat until the last one comes in now I realize that sometimes that this has been a point of contention of which that you know Baptists don't have to preach on it Pentecostals don't have to preach on it nobody has to preach on these things except around the message and that is where you have some that have looked and said well you know when he took the book you know he left the mediatorial see the mercies over with but what it is it's failing to place things correctly in the word God will always reveal what he is ready to do before he does it is that right he reveals that we're living in the time just like when brother John the Baptist could say that the kingdom of heaven is at hand though right it's still at hand tonight you and I look back and say 2,000 years but 2,000 years has been like this it's been a work that's been taking place down through time so God himself making an announcement in this hour and the releasing of the seals of the book to where that God Himself would actually begin to Thunder out his voice and turn our hearts back to the original Bible faith that was once delivered unto the Saints of the Living God it would be that same apostolic faith that was lost back there from the beginning when it started in the church ages but here in this last name this small increment of time God by His grace would move for you and I and revealed to us the things that we have need of not as knowledge but as that which would sow stimulate and correlate with that part that was sown within us faith rises up to recognize that we were always a part of him I tell you what it does brother Branham Labor's on the point it tells us why that he's laboring within predestination why he's laboring an election he said it's to drive the fear out of the church I'm telling you brother and sister our security is not in ourselves our security is in the blood of the Lamb the Bible says in Revelations 12 that we overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony so it's in him that we are counting on and he prayed the Father for us what some of the RAM says this now the lamb in the time of intercessory back here he knew that there were names in there that was put in there from the foundation of the world and as long as their names have never been manifested on earth as yet he had to stay there as an intercessor there were a lot more names that were manifested on the earth after 1963 brother Brandon goes on and you can pick this up we've dealt with this here before brother brems goes on clear into 65 we're waiting on that last sheaf to come in we're waiting on maybe it'll be a black one down in Africa brother BAM tells us over in Washington there in the message he said the Church of the Living God will slug on she'll keep on pressing on until that last name that last one comes in Wow because the promise is sure we know there is a last one we know there's a final as we've said before there's a final day there's a final moment there's a final time we are living in the end time we're not ignorant of this we're not walking as Paul said you're not ignorant brethren in darkness but you're walking in light Levin goes on to say it he said perfectly predestination he had to stay there because he came to die for those that God had ordained to eternal life you catch that he came to die for those whom God had ordained to eternal life by his foreknowledge he saw them not by his own will his will was none should perish you catch that divining there Calvary is for the elect it is a purchase of redemption but as it says in the book of Peter he will he desires that no one would be lost that's his desire and that same life within us desires the same thing there are people that you don't know you're not a witness to by your life maybe little things that you feel like why couldn't I drop all of this why could nine fall all of this maybe God wanted you to fold out the part that needed to be folded to that person and they themselves were not meant for that of election and redemption but they could look to the Lord in salvation because they could look and say lord save me I'm lost and they could have faith that there was a sufficient purchase was made and they can believe God for the forgiveness of their sins but yet never able to see that truth that reality and Christ be glorified in them fully as he is the believer but let me tell you something justification is a part of Christ being glorified in somebody's life sanctification is another fold a second work of grace being glorified in a person's life I don't know about you but I could shout what somebody's been sanctified the whole brother slamming you got to give him what for why do I gotta give him what for well they don't believe like you believe who said they gotta believe like I believe are you with me this is a message friends for the elect but it is not a message that calls you and I to look down at other people it ought to be something on our heart that says welcome welcome welcome but it's not welcome according will they receive exactly how you're bringing in or one or more but it is a life that bids them welcome not welcome of sin but it actually puts before them of what Christ himself has already done now notice this by his foreknowledge he knew who would and who were not there for as long as there was one named hatton never yet been declared in earth price had to stay there as an intercessor to take care of that name aren't you glad but as soon as that final name had been splashed in the Clorox bleach then his intercessory days was over let him that's filthy be filthy still at him that's holy be holy steel and he leaves the sanctuary and it becomes a judgement seat woe unto those outside of Christ then I'm glad that he's there I'm glad that he has been there and he is there because that's the thrust of the gospel remember when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost he was preaching of the full work the redemptive work and he was preaching by the authority that the sacrifice had ascended up to the mediatorial seed and now the fulfillment of joel to the promise of the holy ghost of which they were looking for has now been poured out upon the believer so he was preaching that these are the mediatorial days and he said that it is unto you and to your children and as many as the Lord our God shall call you see the minitor work of the Lord Jesus Christ is not just by sacrifice and by blood but a redemption is also by power and redemption comes with a full completeness as well and this is what the heart of the early church was bringing about that there indeed is a real complete work there is a power that's able to liberate you from sin that's able to lift you up because a purchase has been made and the life within that blood has been released and there's a power that's able to open up a pathway like God did through the Red Sea he's able to bring you through there and through the same thing that purges you cleanse you set you free is the very same blood that destroys the enemy that removes his hold upon your life better release of that life inside of you says I once was bound but now I have been set free then it brings a little dance about your step because you realize your enemies are dead glory so there's been a much interceding on our behalf you see all the way down through time here there's been intercession you realize that the Spirit of God Peter would speak of this in first Peter chapter one I believe of how that the Spirit of Christ speaking through the prophets signifying what time what manner of time of which this salvation should come speaking of the very change of the body the redemption of the body they did not know the time though nor the day nor the hour remember down through the ages they've lived every moment as though that the next moment was his coming up I'm talking about the believers they lived with that kind of an urgency about their life they prayed with him that way as a matter of fact they took what Paul said comforts you one another with these words if there was any comfort to be given it was comfort that would come by the word of the Lord and I believe with all my heart that we look at this even how the Lord Jesus himself he told us when he went away he said I will pray the Father for you that he would send you uncomforta another comforter and he will lead and guide you into all truth now think of this intercessory work and you know you realize that things within the scriptures brother and sister there disconnected it's not all of a sudden that you and I or anybody else yes things are just dropping out of the sky and we alone I did this and I didn't even realize it but you realize God brings things our way even with what he is ministering here tonight and other times and things you read in the scripture and things that you're listening in the message these are not things to where you're just building knowledge but remember it's the Spirit of God that is speaking to you and I and the word is always meant to be applied and the Spirit of God will always help you and I to know when to apply that word I think of where when you look at Abraham's life brother Dan tells us was gardening Abraham's life I believe it's in by faith faith is the victory and he says tells us of how then Abraham one day he heard about Noah and Abraham he said went out in the field and begin to pray he said God he said I know that you and he said that you're a living God and I want to meet that same God that moved for know I heard what what you did and he said when he got out there in the field and started praying that way he said that day God came down and spoke to him you see there's got to be a life that crosses another life's path that'll cause them to think there's something more beyond this they may not be able to put in words where you're at but they know about your life Jesus is present in your life they know that's a living God they know that there's something real that's there you see it gives them a point of reference that they're able to refer to and say I want to know that same God that so-and-so knows I they testified to me on this I've seen their life I want to know that same God they don't know right now tonight they might be in a worse situation it might be a very bad situation that they're in but there can come a memory within their heart that would rise up and they should say lord I remember so-and-so that I work with the Lord they testified you're a living God the Lord will you intervene on this position right now I'm telling you he's a living God and your life just as much as you got Bible markers in your Bible as much as you highlight it and you've got ribbon sticking out let me tell you something you are the ribbons of the words that contained in here when that life is reflected through your life it's a point of reference of the Living Word and here was Abraham he already knew when they got thinking him back to eighth Noah's life and I believe that Moses could look back to Abraham's life you see Abraham was one that even when God had revealed to Noah regarding impending judgment Noah built and preached to the whole generation matter of fact Noah preached like everybody was going to be saved here you know he rebuked sin he preached it as though everybody but you see God had already told him it's for him and his family oh Lord I want you to catch something right here you see if it was truly that Noah himself was just preaching out of form then there would have been nothing that would have been able to help the people in but you see I believe that Noah had a spiritual insight like you and I can look into tonight and realize it's not a man's family but the family is the family of God and when that word has been delivered through a profit that profit is not bringing forth natural sons and daughters because it's not his seed line he's there as a minister of the throne from the right hand of God and he's ministering that seed life of God and is there's going to be children of God that are brought forth in that hour what by the same spoken word that same holy spirit it brings forth life so who is the family the family is the family of God you see and I'm saying you're a greater privilege tonight to be a son and daughter of God so you could have been born a Branham and be lost you're a greater privilege to be a son and daughter of God just because your last name you're not guaranteed anything come on friends the only name that counts is the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only name that's the only name that anybody is saved by that's the only name Donal recognized because that's the name of salvation and redemption and righteousness and salvation and holiness so in this spirit of intercessory he no doubt how it moved within the heart of Abraham I'll tell you it shows us the power of a separated life before God when knowing when Abraham he begins to stay here and he's you know staying with the Lord the Bible says in Genesis 18 22 that the men turned their faces from fence and they went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham drew near and said well now also destroy the righteous with the wicked look at this spirit of intercession peradventure there be 50 righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the the place for the fifty righteous that are therein that be far from thee to do after this manner Abraham in tune with God's heart to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right see this intercessory work that's taking place do you realize what a blessing it is to have your eyes open because when you have your eyes open you're able to truly intercede you're not interceding about getting somebody to a church you're not interceding about getting somebody Lord that they believe just like I do know you're interceding knowing that the answer is Jesus Christ you're not trying to get him to a camp you're trying to get them to Jesus Christ throw to me to God God goes on to say yeah 450 I'll spirit in verse 26 in verse 27 Abraham said behold now I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord which am but dust and ashes he knew he were nothing but dust and ashes but he was in contact with the Lord God Oh glory be to God so Abraham prayed earnestly look at that very nature of Christ and Abraham that called out for lot you know brother Ram take many different angles on lot many different ways that you find even have brother Ram will bring certain types in certain ways good and just for example you know billet and many times will and we always recognize that crossing into the promised land used to cross into the baptism of the Holy Ghost yet brother Ram will take us in the message redemption and completeness and joy and he'll speak of how them coming through the Red Sea that that was actually the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see he was applying things that came by divine power and is to recognize the type and has its being spoken of in that moment and we know that what would speak of the righteous one lot does not speak of the elect but yet there are times that brother Branham would use this as an example to where brother Ram would say that lot himself was unaware of impending judgment and then brother rambles talked about it that lot himself was a believer who got himself singled out from the rest of the body so it's watching how things are applied remember it was it was Lots own ambitions that caused him to separate from the rest of the body now if you can apply this correctly here and we can look at and say well he got his own ambitions and got returning towards the things of the world and that can happen what a person can actually begin to become so wrapped up in everything looking at the success of life and what they can have that they fail to recognize this life yes but a vapor you don't have a promise of tomorrow why would you want to give all your all your work and resources for a house that when you get retired you won't even be able to enjoy you understand what I'm saying it's a reality that this is just a plea of leading passing time it don't mean that we're not to work for things but it means that we're not to have our ambitions and our goals our affections set on things of this earth but to see that how but even with lot himself brother Ram talks about how that we you know in that wolf can get that deer all singled out from the rest of them he tells us don't forsake to assemble yourselves together he said when the devil can get you all isolated off to yourself to where you actually believe and start to think that I can be just a good a Christian at home as I can of church and brother Ram says you cannot do that you can do it it's totally contrary to God's provided way but he said you get yourself all singled out you get yourself all drawn out you know why you're not willing to walk on with God we need one another program tells us in that same quote we need one another more now than we ever did he said see when you're in fellowship with one another you have people who pray for you people who holds your name up before the throne of God I'll tell you what if you don't got nobody else to pray for you put me on your list every moment of the day every hour say Lord God brother Samuel needs help Lord he needs help by the same udl I sure do need help I need his leadership I need his grace and His mercy every day of my life I'm not dependent on my works or my righteousness I'm depending on him no repeater god I look here you know at Abraham you look at law he got himself all singled out you know his pride is he got too ambitious and looking at things but I think God that Abraham was able to stand there and said Lord will you spare it if there's only ten only ten will you spare it God said I'll spare it if there's only ten Abraham was so on with God's nature I'll tell you Abraham like Noah he caught the real kernel of the message in that hour it's a message of preserving life when Daniel and Daniel chapter 9 when there was a hasty decision regarding here the image of the beast the dream that Nebuchadnezzar has and he rose up and said I want you to kill all the last man daniel stood up in that hour and daniel said why is the king so hasty with his judgment he said let us pray and seek for the mercies of God and Daniel stood up and he began to pray he took his fellows with him the rest of them didn't know what to do but Daniel had contact with God and then you could stand there and pray for the mercies of God and God revealed to Daniel and the Bible says when God revealed to Daniel answer it said Daniel bowed himself and begin to worship the Lord an answer came brother and that answer itself was well that Daniel needed and Daniel knew I've got the answer this same answer in when it's delivered it's going to spare death guess that has sought to take this province its sought to take wise man but this answer that's come strictly and straightly from the throne of God it's called the secret of life it's gonna preserve lifes in this hour why there was one who was able to stand there and said let's intercede on behalf i'm telling you brother and sister the rest of the wise men did not become elect Hebrews but they were saved because God himself there was salvation that went throughout that Kingdom and God preserved his elect and he preserved the other wise men because of the prayer of intercession then you believe God still answered prayer glory that's one thing the Holy Ghost it brings in our life to have power with prayer think about this a living an intercessor in life brother bamboo you know he talks about this and souls in prison he talks about how that women would dress he talks about some of me you know he said they'll make fun of you about how you you'd wrestled fashion and so forth and you look like a Holy Roller he said don't you worry you got something a little sex green that don't got the world all looking out there she hasn't got it oh she's doomed you got more on you got virtue she's got nothing she got a bait that traps all all souls in the hell the blind walks into it now you've got something now you better watch how you take this this is not meant to walk with pride you realize brother man tells us and how can overcome he talks about the sisters he said getting long hair and you start to get a pride about your long hair it's not enough just to have the right clothing out here I believe in holiness out here but I also believe in the spirit of meekness on the inside so what's what he's telling here here you are your life the way that you're dressed your life your life is actually preaching he said you know you may not even be on a church book but it might be your righteous life that's holding the wrath of God from the world today the world won't believe it you woman that's called Holy Roller you little man that don't hardly know anything but you cried at God day and night for the sins of the country you might be the one that's holding off the wrath where God said if I can find 10 I'll spare it if I can find 10 as he was in the days of South asylum so shall it be he said not if I can find 10 Methodist and Baptist 10 Pentecostals 10 athletes 10 message believers Mize will bring it on down come on friends if I can find ten senators if I can find ten ministers but if I can find ten righteous there is one righteous that's Christ Christ living in one them ten of spirit so the righteousness God was looking for the blood if he found the blood he'll spirit do you realize even right now what's holding back the wrath of God is because you and I under the blood are here and there's still more names to be splashed names or name or whatever it's still dear Ellis when you walk in a workplace your life failed by and shrouded by the blood of Jesus Christ do you realize it's holding the wrath of God back to minister grace to hearts and lives now I'm saying like this here let's try to kind of bring this down here remember Jesus and we looked at this a little bit on the Sundays Jesus he knew what was going to take place with Peter but he told Peter I prayed for you he knew the direction was going to be taken but that had to be for the fulfillment of the word but he said I prayed for you when you're converted then you go sprint strengthen your brother you see intercessory prayer it's being able to pray for one another you to the promise by the same spirit where you that same faith that moves in your heart that's how you pray you pray by the same effectual faith and work that God has done in your life and that's how you're able to effectually pray you see intercession by the spirit it's recognized by the Word of God in the plan of God intercessory player intercessory prayer is not asking God to bless something he's cursed like I could not pray god bless the USA I can't pray that you with me yet I can still pray according how the scripture says that I would that every man pray everywhere and Paul goes through and speaking of who and how that you ought to pray you see even when brother Graham said I've given up praying for her but remember brother Branham would offer a prayer for the president you see it's having discernment within those things brother BAM was not praying that America would turn around because she's already send away her day of grace but there are lives and hearts that are still here you with me so when we look at this it's having an understanding because even when Abraham prayed for Ishmael even though Abraham had his heart that he desired that God would bless Ishmael but he wanted to make Ishmael that he would be the one of the Covenant but you see even though Abraham being elect of God and having an intercessory prayer he God he could not change what God had already ordered that it was not going to be Ishmael that he would make the covenant with but with Isaac aren't you glad that in your life in my life the Covenant is not with Ishmael it's with Isaac amen the book of your first Union has been put in the Sea of God's forgetfulness Ishmael was under that first union but now under this new union with Christ Jesus it is the Isaac that was promised because we in Christ take on Abraham's seed we are joint heirs with Christ Jesus we are in the covenant of the covenant life and giver himself oh my just think of how this to be an intercessor you must be filled with the Holy Ghost you must be filled with the Holy Ghost you see feel because what the Holy Spirit is the new birth its eyes men cannot even see the kingdom of God except he'd be born again it gives eyesight things that others cannot see it gives eyesight and listen to me now even when others who aren't born again but there might be things that are going on that they don't even see but another one who is in the body they're able to call out and say lord help my brother help my sister and they're able to pray on their behalf in intercessory prayer now you and I this is the way that I believe with intercessory prayer that is the same spirit of christ that's praying through us according to the promise you know the bible tells us in Luke chapter 18 I'm not going to read all this but the Bible talks about that there were two men that went up to the temple to pray and this is in Luke 18 verse 9 and there was a Pharisee in verse 11 that said the Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself god I thank thee that I am not as other men are extortioners unjust adulterers or even as this public Oh Lord this kind of sounds like they were in the same church I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I possess and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying God be merciful to me a sinner I tell you this man went down to his house justified rather than the other I don't care what the other had done I don't care if he did everything twice a day he did not go down to his justified because he had justified himself no man shall be justified in the eyes of God outside of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ if your rest is in your works you're still lost but you must rest in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ if you're resting in him listen brother and sister you have been set free from your own works for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted see sometimes God lets you see wrong see what you're gonna do about it he'll let you see it what are you gonna do about it intend there's been a lot of things I'll be honest with you you know what no doubt it's wrong with me I don't think but there's a lot there's things that I have you know just sometimes going around and I see different things let me just tell you the approach I've taken with it I looked at it like this I said Lord you let me see certain things but it's not to criticize the person but you've let me see it and I'm asking you to help me let my feet be ordered because I don't believe that brother meant wrong I don't believe this one means wrong Lord help me help them Lord help me you showed this to me I'm responsible now there would be more mercy for that individual than it would be for me but I look at it like that I need God's grace we all need God's grace I tell you friends that's a reality here in this life it isn't that were just oh we're a bunch of sorry people we can't live a victorious life that's not what I'm talking about I'm saying that we need God's grace every single day if there's any victory or any praise in our life it's because of the Lord Jesus Christ you realize the attitude that we take even when we come together it will affect whether his presence comes down among us or not we can take this kind of an attitude right here well I think God I'm not like a lot who turned his tent going down that way bless God I'm not turning my tent my tennis straight right here that ain't intercessory prayer you're justifying yourself before the throne of God in a matter of fact they don't even have access to the blood is not opening Jesus Christ blood does not open for accusation brother the devil is there to accuse they are not you cannot come before the throne of God and accuse your brother or sister you can't do it I want you think about this what about us when you look at how brother Branham himself and I mentioned to you last week about him standing in that little place in Cleveland cleburn's cafeteria there in Toledo remember that little lady how she was scantily dressed and that policeman had his arm around her you remember how brother Branham had the attitude toward it God how can you let such stand my little daughter's Lord God I don't want them to be raised up in this field how can you let stuff such stuff stand around here like this and brother Graham tells us of how that God took him around and you know how God began to show him a vision of the world and how that every time his sins that they would they would come up but there was a bumper of blood that was there that he would actually take care of his sins and you know how it went on brother Ram says that hound that the Lord said you know he said I've forgiven you he said but you're wanting to stand here and condemn her and you know how when when the whole thing goes on these are this is a key statement that I always look at in there brother Ram says I seen in God's eyes I was as bad as she was that has been a loaded statement for me over the years it wasn't brother man standing there in shorts in a halter top but you see it's not just about the clothing out here it's the clothing in here you've got to have the right clothing on the inside and no doubt all the pressures every one of us friends sometimes you go in place you think really do we have to have the music this loud is this supposed to help me synchronize my bites of steak and cut it a certain Lane what's what's supposed to do is supposed to make me faster so I eat more and I spend more money sometimes you know you go to certain places and you know so really there's only some places you can go certain times of the day and actually hear some the rest of time you just read their lips and say we'll talk afterwards let's just eat right now you know you can get to a place you can think lord have mercy why do they happen you know you can get yourself in such a ynx such an atmosphere about yourself say god help us god help us they might be your tendency it may not be your tendency but nonetheless we need the help of the Lord and I say like this before brother Brown could ever intercede for that woman in prayer he had to have the right spirit on the inside to intercede for you see before you could ever pray for somebody you got to have a heart for him you got to be able to enter in you may not know what they're going through it may not be that you condone their actions that someone I'm talking about I'm talking about you look and say Lord I don't know what they're going through I don't know what they're feeling the Lord I don't know what they've been through but I believe they belong to you Lord and I pray that God that you would help them Lord God but you and minister to them as you've ministered to me Lord you're standing there intercession they may not even have the strength or the confidence to raise their head but remember the Lord Jesus knew that about Peter and he said don't tell Peter my disciple that I'm going before him God knows what he's doing that's where I will look what about us what about us in every local assembly every local assembly right here it's like a womb it's like a womb you're carrying with a desire to see life come forth there are many different stages right here present there's not one of you including myself that can speed somebody along but we want to be a help we want to keep moving as God letting Moses to keep moving they kept praying and look brother sister every time they prayed they kept moving every time they prayed they kept moving God was moving and interceding many different stages but there must be a resounding faith to intercede and minister to the needs that are present the Bible says in Philippians Paul told the church looking on every man on his own things but also on the things of others this is where the Prophet would admonish some of the older seasoned sisters in the spirit of sweetness to go and try to help others this is where he would Mohnish the older brethren speak to the younger this is just a little foretaste here it's just a little drum but you see we all have something to do your there's a burden in your heart for this assembly I trust there is it's not about making this church all we want this church to be now we're interested in crys being reflected in lives that's what we're burning for that's why we would speak with one another that's why we would take time to call somebody catch somebody that's why we would help them encourage them along the way somebody else might look and say they don't deserve encouragement but yet somebody needs to be encouraged sometimes they know they're beneath sin they know they're loaded down but they need to be encouraged just point them to the one who can help them in their time of need they're already beat down shut down they're already down there they need to be pointed and lift up their eyes unto Him what about us what brother Sammy you've got that hey this ain't a one-man show the days of one man ministry are over buddy this is a body ministry this is where there's a burden that moves through this church where you're a part of this local assembly you say I'm a part of the bride of Jesus Christ I am to worldwide but God gave me a burden for this local assembly for the lives that are here I pray and I study according to what God has placed before me here that's where my that's where my whole reliance is with that do you pray for the rest of the body I do but yet I know where God has placed me and there's a burden here that no matter if I wanted to lay it down I can't I can't woe unto me if I preach not the gospel you think there aren't times that I felt like just saying you know what I'm discouraged sure there have been times like that but whoa and to me if I don't preach the gospel I didn't get myself this burden I did not get myself this love for the people and you did not give yourself the love that you have for the body of Jesus Christ for the brothers and sisters of where you've got a burden to see Christ glorified and magnify in the light you didn't do that but God did that in your life we are a member of one body if God wanted us to be one big massive body around the world of which that is the entire body of Jesus Christ he would have left it like that but that's not how God seen fit you realize he could have done that all of those who gathered out of this province he could said okay you come out of this province we want y'all to come right back here to Jerusalem all you from Antioch come back here to Jerusalem all you from Corinth you know you can't live in Corinth you gonna go to hell come on back to Jerusalem you know all those are in closet oh come on you gotta come back to Jerusalem they had already met the high priests and King of Jerusalem Jerusalem the Holy Spirit fell in Jerusalem as a promise that is where David's throne will sit in the Millennium it moves into our hearts right now by the baptism of the Holy Ghost God keeping a promise that he made in his word but now to see that Jerusalem being unfolded in the lives and hearts of been believing children to where you and I would stand right here and have a heart to pray for one another your loving I think of how Paul said I in ceased to pray for you I think of one brother here I won't call his name out but he texts him here just just some days ago and there was some needs that he had heard about you know within the churches things it was and he said you know buscemi said we may not be able to be there he said as far as you know right there he said but we and stand right in prayer I looked at that text I said God thank you they may not have been able to stand right here but yet to see it that how they're a part of this assembly they're here but you look at it they said we may not be able to be but we're standing in prayer I said things be to God no wonder Paul could talk about travailing you know it's revealed together in Christ until Christ be formed in you let me just skip down here don't you love him let me just close with this here's Israel in the days of Samuel they made a choice and the choice they made was based on what they were seeing out of other countries other countries had a king and so they made a choice that they themselves wanted a king God let his displeasure be known to him Samuel prayed for him and then Samuel came to him and he let him know that within it all of this has been prayed for he says in verse 20 at first verse Samuel 12 because God actually let a sign be given by the Thunder and by the rain in the time of harvest that I disapprove and then look at how the people became the Bible says in verse 19 they said to Samuel pray for thy servants unto the Lord thy God that we die not for we have added unto all our sins this evil to ask us a king and Samuel said unto the people fear not you have done all this wickedness yet turned not aside from following the Lord but serve the Lord with all your heart and turn you not aside for then should you go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great namesake because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people I love this next part moreover as for me God forbid that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you though they were in the wrong Samuel said God forgive forbid that I sin against God in ceasing to pray for you but I will teach you the good and the right way of the mercy of God I want you to think of this and we can apply this down here just as God can look into Moses heart and see the cross he could see the love the Moses had for the people he saw the love of God of the promise properly placed in his heart and it drew God's attention away from the stubbornness of the people and it drew it to the promise of himself as Christ here veiled in Moses and I want you to recognize that same word as the Lord Jesus said if ye abide in me and my word about it in you ask what you will and it shall be done unto you I'll tell you when I think of that in terms of the scriptures I look at that in Romans chapter 8 and he just bear with me just a moment I'm coming down if you look at it of how that you and I in a journey the Bible says that in Romans 8:26 the Spirit helpeth our infirmities it helps our weaknesses I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand but every one of us have weakness we're encompassed with weakness for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered do you realize that the same Spirit of God living in you and I it is United us with Christ Jesus we are accepted in the beloved we are identified with our high priest we are in him and he is the high priest of his word he is our intercession he is the high priest that was selected from among men to represent you and I to offer up gifts on our behalf to intercede for you and I when we don't even know how to pray but the spirit maketh intercession according to our weaknesses you know why even in the midst of our mistakes and our failures but yet the Spirit of Christ on the inside of you and I remember it's calling out cuz there's a mediator on the throne but the Spirit of God on the inside of you he knows how to be the right kind of a mediator in me and you I'm telling you you and I've got somebody on the throne who never rose up and raised up to the heavens and forgot his humanity down here but he took that remembrance all the way to glory and on the throne and glory tonight there sits a human body there sets a body there as a memorial that I have overcome the world be a good cheer I have shed the blood even though the accuser wants to point out all kinds of faults but my blood has taken care of what Adam did and Adam sold them out but I paid the price and I have redeemed them but they're not perfect oh but they're in my perfection they are perfect and coming to perfection are you with me what's he looking at this is why brother Branham in that same quote I've been reading to you look at the power of believer God seemed to love the Moses had for the people brother brems would see that's why the word must be abiding in you because when the words are biting in you God is not looking at your stubbornness he's looking at the life of the word that's living on the inside of you I'm telling you I'm grateful there is a blood that's there that's able to capture his attention and now I'm the only just capturing his attention but there's an effectual working by the divine grace of God that's able to move on my behalf to able to lift me and give me strength that I'm able to live and overcoming life and prevailing over every gate of the enemy I'm glad about that tonight the Bible said he searches the hearts he that search of the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God I want you to think of this according to the will of God brother Brennan gives us two examples just just two out of so many there was a brother getting ready to go down on a plane there was a plane getting they told him we don't know if this plane is going to land if it does the landing gears not coming out so we're gonna try to land it but we don't know what's gonna happen brother Brown meets the brother later on on the platform but the brother said Lord wherever brother Branham is in the world would you put my name before him right now he said because I believe he can touch the throne of God for him for me brother Bram said he was you know he didn't realize but this brother's name just come to him you know after brother Bram got to talk to the brother and got to asking times and dates and stuff what it was God dropped the name of that brother and brother Rams heart and brother Bryan prayed for him and just as that plane was coming down landing gear popped out they met on the platform and identified all that brother bran said was a spirit of intercession bill Graham went on to talk about a baby who was around the tabernacle there they had called and so forth and brother bran wasn't able to get to it but brother Ram started praying and when he started praying he said you know he said they had to go ahead he said I couldn't go down in the hospital right then because they were getting ready to do tests on the baby and give us some kind of a treatment he said I knew would be a long process so I just stayed at home I'm and I prayed he said I got a report he's when I was finally got to the hospital that that baby had already gotten better he said so I just walked over putting her hand on her knee and just thank God he said see it wasn't about that I had to be there it was the Holy Spirit that interceded on behalf of that baby I'm telling you he's still the same God tonight he's still the same God I've witnessed in right here in this assembly it's not just something I've got to refer back to the message about I can bring it right here to this assembly bring it in my own life that the Holy Spirit is still an intercessor that intercede on behalf of one another I'll tell you tonight I'll say God don't let me just get my eyes on me myself and I and just my family but God let me have the right heart like Abraham had even though Locke wasn't under Abraham's nose but Abraham said he is part of the land and you gave me the land and I'm claiming him I'm glad that there's a spirit the Spirit of God let's stand it's our advocate brother and sister it's our advocate brother bill it's our advocate you know what an advocate is it's somebody who stands in on your behalf it's something to wear that as program says we stagger ignorantly sometimes into things fall into traps I want to ask you to raise your hands but they're saying you can look at and say oh my why did I say that like that Lord why not this well you get to look in on that and you recognize it within it it's much your heart but there's an advocate there for you if you confess your sin he's faithful and just to forgive you I know sometimes it's hard cuz everything is there and you wall within and under self condemnation but remember there he ever liveth to make intercession and if God be for us who can be against us you see what it is draw his attention to that word if something strikes your heart make it right there in the presence of God say Lord forgive me what are you doing you're drawing his attention there to the blood by which you are covered and identified in by his spirit if God be for us who can be against us he ever liveth to make intercession on our behalf the Rebbe said we don't plead for ourselves it's the Holy Ghost in us that pleads for us he gives an utterance he gets forth prayer it's him crying out an advocate brother Branham reads that scripture says and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world are we able to pray for other people when we see needs in their life maybe they've got situations that's come up in their life and you your path the way you cross them you cross their path and you realize it Lord they just need help right now most I'm you know they're not a believer they don't even go to church anywhere so does that stop you from praying for ho not you might be their only length if they've got and if God's brought that knee to your attention you're responsible to bring that before the throne of God when we can bring that before God's throne in intercession see it's not just interceding for one another's needs but the needs that we come across it might be a witness to that person that you can go back to them and say you know what we're lifting you up in prayer before the Saints with who does that be okay at our church and they might say sure I appreciate that they may maybe not understand it but then they themselves can get a little witness back as God would move for the need in their life don't get down because you never never seen sitting here it may not be that there are name to sit here but maybe that witness in their life has caused them to reach for what they are destined for and that was salvation Lord forgive me for my sins you see when we look at it down through time brother BAM tells us clearly like this he said if it's a Catholic man he said if he's trusting in the church for his salvation he's lost but he said if he's trusting in Jesus Christ that man is saved go horribie to God that don't bother me a bit that he saves others they don't bother me a bit that he saves others I'm glad because you know what he is a savior I know him as a savior I'm known as a redeemer I've said it a bunch of times if all I can do is fellowship with somebody and all they can fellowship about as a savior and I don't say that's all they can do I'll fellowship with you that he's a savior and we can see if God will open the door for a little bit more room but I do know he's a savior I'm not gonna beat somebody down because of what limited they know but I want to encourage him to live to your full potential amen and if God sees fit to open their eyes then that's in his hands may our lives live such a righteous life may we live as people with a burden may we live as people with a burden for instance does not get into where we come in to church and as soon as church is over we're just I'm not gonna preach on that tonight but let's have a birdie let's not get wrapped up in our own little world our own little problems let's have a burden realize that the devil the devil is stealing from you the joy stealing from being able to pray for one another I want people to pray for me I'll tell you one when I pray among most of my time is spent it's praying for other people it isn't just when I'm in time of prayer but there's time sometimes for the rail forget people's names I forget needs and sometimes it bothers me brother behind so Pascagoula I didn't mean to forget this but when he brings it to me I might be in a grocery store I said God you know if that made Lord forgive my feeble mind Lord I forgot Lord but minister I've told him I pray for him Lord and I didn't get it wrote down in time but let's let's be people with a burden because I'm telling you you're not going anywhere without me and I'm not going anywhere without you brother Samuel it's an individual fare I know that but this is a rapture in one astronaut the Lord Jesus Christ and I don't believe I'm preaching through a bunch of heathens I believe I'm preaching to believers I'm believe I'm preaching to sons and daughters of God I'm preaching what God has delivered for this generation and for this evening I'm preaching this because this is what father wants i dont preach things looking down the depot i preach this same gospel this word it's for this guy included right here I'm preaching to God's people I'm preaching to the purchase of his blood no malice pray Lord Jesus whoa God how we thank you tonight Lord that there is an intercessor on the floor how we thank you Lord God for the bloody lamb I would thank your Lord God as she revealed yourself Lord and continue to unfold yourself in this hour that you are our propitiation Lord God to think down through the ages the believers that's lived in every age the call has went out of them like it did in John even so Lord Jesus come they didn't know Lord God that it would be so many more years hundreds or a thousand or whatever more you they didn't know that but they lived every day they lived for your coming that's what Redemption did for them it calls them Lord to live their eyes above this world they were no longer trapped in just having ambitions nothing wrong Lord with having goals in this life but Lord God we don't ever want goals to be ahead of you there's one goal that we have one mark that we're pressing towards and that's the mark of the high calling of Jesus Christ our Lord our desire Lord God is to be delivered out of that second resurrection we don't want to be there in that second resurrection we want to be part of that first resurrection this is where Paul himself did not even live his life as though he was one who had already attained that he said I strive I seek to apprehend that which I'm not pretend enough he prayed for the saints of God many times in the opening letters philippians colossians thessalonians ephesians on and on it's mentioned prayer prayer for the people lord god I pray that we would stand not as that Pharisee we read about the Lord God if we see situations let us have that heart like the publican that can look and say Lord just as I need your mercy my brother and my sister needs your mercy Lord they're standing in need father what God would you minister to them help them Lord I don't even know the words to say but I know they need a touch from you Lord I know you love them Lord God I know you care about them lord I pray Heavenly Father oh god may our hearts Lord God be like that of Moses we're the world abiding in us and us in it Lord God to where that love of God as you Lord would speak a new commandment that I ran unto you that you love one another even as I have loved you Oh Brandon Lord God may the love of God Lord so Paul say Lord through our hearts Lord that desire Lord I don't want to see nobody miss it Lord nobody I don't want nobody Lord whether they're here or there under the listening Lord God but my voice or wherever they made me Lord dog I'm prayed Lord I don't want no one to miss it I want them to be there or God I want every heart every life boy I want every soul Lord God that I've ever been privileged Lord to preach the gospel to I don't want nobody to miss it Lord and not just them but others been longer a crime for those lord god father granny Lord God by your mercy Lord help us lord I pray O God as a church Lord God it's a womb there's many different lives Lord there's lives here Lord God in different stages help us lord help us to be patient as changed by the Spirit of God would remind us that the husbandman is patience he waits long for that ripening for the harvest he has

prayer father I pray Lord not only for myself Lord but I pray God for this entire assembly Lord I pray Lord God that father for every life and every heart Lord forgive us Lord if we become tunnel

accountable to pray with us lord help us sword God Brannen lord I pray father this is a part of that early church this is a part of the body of Jesus Christ ranek Lord God for father that spirit of Cain is not about us where Cain said am I my brother's keeper why are you asking me where he's at but father Abel's blood cried out against Cain but the blood of Jesus speak of better things that laugh inside of us Lord as the Prophet would relate he said Jesus blood cries out and said Cain come here you old Cain I can change all glory be to God the blood of Jesus Christ has a voice has a voice granite Lord God may we stand Lord O God his husband standing for their wives wives standing for their husbands Lord Brannan Lord God I think of how the Prophet he stood there that day right down there in the motel room in Shreveport Louisiana when his wife had that tumor he began to call out in intercession he never prayed and said Lord you know she reads so many chapters a day she listens to my tapes Lord that's not what he brought before your throne but he said Lord she's been good for me she stood between me in the public Lord she's fixed my meals Jesus she's ironed my clothes Lord he interceded on her behalf what she might have not thought anything about administered it ministered to your servanthood she did her part o Lord let us not despise our parts Lord that we are called to play but we each and every one up to have a burden Lord God and father you said the least the the doing it to the lease of this matchup Oh God help us Lord forgive us of our selfishness move where our hearts Lord God have been just about us forgive us Lord Jesus help us through her God that we would live Lord God intercessory lives Lord government a hard war that intercedes who were God on behalf of one another not one of us Lord would just turn away our children if we seen him going wrong we would not turn a blind eye to it but we would pray and we would ask for your leadership we would seek toward God that you might give us words of wisdom that you might deal with them in the night that you might deal with them maybe through another brother another sister but Lord we know that it would have to be you whatever the channel would be that would be fine with us but what did you that we're asking for Lord I pray may we have that same heart Lord for one another granted Lord Jesus I pray I Love You Lord I love these people Lord what God you know my heart Lord in always Lord I don't like to leave but I know they're always in your hands Lord God I love you I love the Lord
