[31:01] Hallelujah.
[31:03] What day of the week is it?
[31:06] Cuz this does not feel like a Wednesday
[31:08] night. Praise the
[31:10] Lord. I love the way you guys worship.
[31:13] And I was waiting for one about that
[31:14] fast. So you guys just
[31:17] You got me. And I I was actually I was
[31:19] thinking we're going to need a fire
[31:21] extinguisher cuz these guys are just
[31:23] There you go, man. They're playing like
[31:26] starting fires. Amen. Well, God bless
[31:29] you tonight. I'm not going to try to
[31:30] follow that up. So, we'll
[31:32] just we'll just go into the word here.
[31:35] If you want to open your Bibles to
[31:36] Hebrews 12, uh greet you in the name of
[31:39] the Lord and behalf of Pastor Paul
[31:42] offain and the church back home. And
[31:44] it's good to be here with you all. and
[31:46] and uh I was just I was thinking today
[31:49] about brother Sam's um just his
[31:52] confidence to ask me down. I I don't
[31:54] think I've come here to preach uh once
[31:57] when he's been here and that's okay that
[32:00] I'm not I just mean that
[32:02] for me that that's real special because
[32:04] it's just his confidence in me and um
[32:07] and your confidence in me and your your
[32:10] compliments when you see me out and
[32:11] about and I just I really appreciate
[32:14] that. It really means a lot and Praise
[32:16] the Lord. You know, I was also thinking
[32:17] I'm I'm not my goodness, I'm not much of
[32:20] a of a preacher. Um don't know if I can
[32:23] call myself a preacher, but then I got
[32:25] to thinking and I thought I don't I
[32:27] don't really want to call myself a
[32:28] preacher. What I'd really want the Lord
[32:30] to do is use me to minister. And uh so I
[32:33] heard somebody say that one time and I
[32:35] thought, boy, there's there's, you know,
[32:37] you watch ministries come through and
[32:39] man, you just got to be careful not to
[32:42] compare yourself amongst yourselves, you
[32:44] know, but I just think, man, if I could
[32:46] if I could just be used of the Lord to
[32:48] minister tonight. So that's that's my
[32:50] heart and it's good to be here with you.
[32:52] So Hebrews 12 and verse one. Now I just,
[32:55] you know, we know we're all familiar
[32:56] with Hebrews chapter 11. That's the
[32:58] faith chapter. That's the the heroes of
[33:00] faith. And so this is just following it
[33:04] up. And he says, "Wherefore, seeing we
[33:06] are also our compass about with so great
[33:08] a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
[33:11] every weight and the sin which does so
[33:13] easily beset us, and let us run with
[33:15] patience the race that is set before us.
[33:17] looking unto Jesus, the author and
[33:20] finisher of our faith, who for the joy
[33:22] that was set before him, endured the
[33:25] cross, despising the shame, and is sat
[33:27] down at the right hand of the throne of
[33:29] God. Let's just bow our hearts. Heavenly
[33:32] Father, we come before you, Lord. And
[33:35] Lord, we're just completely at your
[33:37] mercy tonight, Lord. just so grateful
[33:40] for the opportunity to be here. So
[33:42] grateful for this congregation and
[33:44] seeing the improvements to the building
[33:47] that you've that you've blessed them
[33:49] with is just joys my heart, Lord. And
[33:52] but knowing that that's just a
[33:54] reflection of the character of the
[33:55] people on the inside. And so it's a
[33:58] privilege tonight to speak to them. And
[34:01] I just ask you, Lord, to help me get out
[34:02] of the way completely, Lord, in Jesus
[34:05] name. Amen. Amen. You can have your
[34:11] seats. My note my notes kind of fill all
[34:13] over the place. I don't really like
[34:15] notes. Um I tend to maybe lean on them
[34:17] too much anyway, but um I just I
[34:20] couldn't just couldn't feel settled with
[34:22] them. So I'm just praying you you pull
[34:25] and I'll follow and we'll just see where
[34:27] we go. There you go. Yes, sir. Now
[34:30] Romans Romans chapter 5. Just just
[34:32] picking up a little bit on this. um you
[34:35] know the the the faith chapter and the
[34:37] heroes of faith and you know when you
[34:39] read that it they
[34:41] they were they're being praised for
[34:44] their faith but everything that they had
[34:46] to go through to produce that faith for
[34:49] that faith to be written about is things
[34:51] that we wouldn't they're not so pleasant
[34:54] you know we can read oh Abraham had
[34:56] faith and he believed and praise God
[34:58] well he waited 25 years for that promise
[35:01] and he was told to sacrifice his son
[35:03] Right? And then, you know, Sarah and
[35:06] dried up and and different things and
[35:08] just just what they had to go through
[35:10] and and you know, Abraham's life wasn't
[35:12] perfect down into Egypt and I think two
[35:15] or three times maybe lied every time he
[35:17] went down and and you know, you just you
[35:19] just you just run through it. Samson's
[35:22] mention and they and it's then it says
[35:24] how much longer it would take to mention
[35:26] everybody and the the mouths of lions
[35:28] and the they were sauna and and we think
[35:31] well what what kind of chapter is this?
[35:33] I don't wait I thought we were heroes of
[35:36] faith. I don't know if I want to be a
[35:37] hero of faith if that's what I got to go
[35:39] through to get there. But but you know
[35:42] there's a there's a very important
[35:44] element here just just in these couple
[35:47] verses. We could probably take these
[35:48] verses and preach all night on them, but
[35:50] you know, verse two says, "Looking unto
[35:52] Jesus, the author and finisher of our
[35:54] faith." Now, that's that's great. And we
[35:56] we talk about he's the author and
[35:58] finisher of our faith. And I'll talk
[36:00] about that more this evening, but I
[36:02] think there's an important key that
[36:03] we'll see tonight is looking unto Jesus.
[36:05] Looking unto Jesus. You have He's not
[36:08] just the author and finisher of your
[36:10] faith, but you have to look upon him.
[36:12] You have to keep your eyes upon him. I
[36:14] was reading today um uh some some I
[36:17] don't know what it is. It's a database
[36:19] of of Spurgeon sermons I guess um called
[36:22] the the preacher of preachers and and he
[36:25] was telling a story about how um they
[36:28] were judging this competition and these
[36:29] men were plowing in a field and and he
[36:32] the judge came and you know they just
[36:34] they weren't doing too well and so he
[36:36] said well what came to the first one and
[36:38] he said I'm gonna pick on you. I'm gonna
[36:39] come down here. Thanks for sitting in
[36:41] the front row tonight. God bless you.
[36:43] You don't got to sit back. I won't bite
[36:45] you. But he said, "What what were you
[36:47] looking at when you were plowing?" And
[36:48] the young man said, "Well, I was
[36:49] watching my hands. I was watching my
[36:51] hands and just making sure I had the
[36:53] good grip on it." And and he said,
[36:54] "Well, but you didn't plow straight.
[36:56] Look at your plow line." He said, "You
[36:58] you you didn't you didn't look at the
[37:00] right thing." And then he goes down to
[37:01] the next boy and he says, "Well, what
[37:02] did you look at?" And he
[37:05] said, "Did you do that cuz I picked on
[37:08] you?" And he said, "Well, I was looking.
[37:11] I was looking at at at my fur row. And
[37:14] he said, "Well, that's you you're you're
[37:15] looking too close to you." He said,
[37:16] "You're you're you're getting off.
[37:18] You're crooked. Your whole furl row is
[37:19] crooked." And then he came to the next
[37:21] boy and said, "You're you're you're the
[37:23] prized one tonight cuz you" And he says,
[37:26] and he says, "Well, what were you
[37:27] looking at?" And he says, "Well, between
[37:28] my two horses," he said, "There was a
[37:30] tree down there." And he said, "I kept
[37:32] watching that tree between them two
[37:33] horses." And he said, "You looked at the
[37:35] right thing." He said, "Look how
[37:37] straight your furrow is." And so we can
[37:39] we can desire everything from God that
[37:42] we that we hear. I you know I've been
[37:44] thinking a lot lately. We're we're
[37:45] blessed to have the message in and book
[37:48] and and tape and and those are great
[37:50] things and we're probably the first
[37:52] generation to have that in in in
[37:54] history. I mean there's few things Moses
[37:56] said here and there and you know we we
[37:58] we have those things written down but
[38:00] but we don't have it like like they
[38:02] didn't have it like we have it.
[38:05] But while that's a blessing, and I hope
[38:07] you understand me now and don't don't
[38:08] throw stones just yet, but it it it's
[38:11] it's it's a blessing, but it's almost
[38:13] got this other side to it. And I don't
[38:14] want to call it a curse, but I just want
[38:16] to call it it's it's something where we
[38:18] we we hear so much of this. We're such a
[38:21] blessed people that that we can we
[38:24] almost over complicate it because we
[38:27] have it, we see it, we can behold it, we
[38:29] can lay and this is what he said here
[38:31] and this is what he said here. But what
[38:32] we find down the road is well what he
[38:34] said here you know he was actually
[38:37] seeing something else. This is what was
[38:38] happening in the background. And so you
[38:41] have to know the background in order to
[38:42] know the reason why he said that. Does
[38:44] that make sense or am I rambling? And so
[38:47] but we can we can get that in our mind
[38:49] and and so when we get in our mind that
[38:51] that that that certain thing or or you
[38:54] know he said you know the take for
[38:56] example the third pool the third pool
[38:58] the spoken word. Well bless God. Now we
[39:00] have people going out and they're just
[39:02] speaking things and thus sayeth the Lord
[39:03] that aren't thus sayaith the Lord. Are
[39:06] you with me? And and you know the the
[39:09] third poll um there was a brother I was
[39:11] I was fellowshipping with and and he
[39:13] said you know we were talking about that
[39:15] tent vision and I said you know it's
[39:16] amazing. I said they were coming out of
[39:18] the tent healed. Not not sick. They were
[39:21] coming out healed but that was a that
[39:22] was a private thing that was over there.
[39:24] It wasn't a great show and typically we
[39:26] try to do things for for show. I mean,
[39:29] we best of
[39:31] intentions. Amen. And uh and and so he
[39:34] just he made this comment and he said,
[39:36] "Yeah, you know, you you look at the
[39:38] ministry today and he said, how many of
[39:41] God's people, you know, were were we're
[39:43] were we're were we're were we're were
[39:43] we're preaching the third pole. We're
[39:45] saying it's the third pole. We're thus
[39:46] sayeth the Lord. God told me." And and
[39:48] we talked a little bit about that last
[39:50] time as as Job's Job's friends. And the
[39:52] one said, "Well, I had a vision. I had a
[39:54] dream." Well, when you start looking at
[39:56] his dream, it's like, "Yeah, I don't
[39:57] know that that was from the Lord." Um,
[39:59] but and it proved not to be, but you
[40:01] know, it's it's when somebody says, "I
[40:03] feel led," or, "God told me," it's
[40:05] really hard to argue with that. You just
[40:06] got to kind of take your hands off of it
[40:08] and watch what happens. But you know, so
[40:11] so he said when when we come out and and
[40:14] different people in ministry dealing
[40:16] with people, if they they're coming out
[40:17] the other side of the tent, out the
[40:19] other side of that little room and
[40:20] they're hurt. They're not healed,
[40:23] they're hurt. And if it was the third
[40:25] pool, they would come out healed, not
[40:26] hurt, because the vision, they were
[40:28] healed. Are you with me? Amen. I I hope
[40:32] you're with me because some of you are
[40:33] looking at me real funny. So I'm just
[40:35] going to keep going.
[40:38] But but my whole point in this is is is
[40:41] we can have we can we're we're blessed
[40:43] with the message. We're blessed with
[40:44] with being able to read it and listen to
[40:47] it. We're blessed to we're blessed to be
[40:49] able to open our Bible. Men died that we
[40:51] could open our Bibles and we can read
[40:53] them ourselves and we can go to God and
[40:55] say, "God, I pray you'd speak to me.
[40:57] Open this scripture. Show me something
[40:59] in your word today." And how many times
[41:01] has it happened? But the the whole
[41:02] purpose, the whole point that I'm trying
[41:04] to get to is you can have this. You can
[41:06] have the message, but if you get your
[41:08] eyes off of Jesus Christ, you're going
[41:10] to plow a crooked furl. You have to keep
[41:13] your eyes on Christ. He's the author and
[41:15] finisher of our faith, but you have to
[41:17] keep your eyes on him. I love that cross
[41:19] right there. Yeah, that's that's you can
[41:21] keep that up. Romans
[41:24] 5:5, therefore, being justified by
[41:27] faith, we have peace with God through
[41:30] the Lord Jesus Christ. So, I want you to
[41:32] catch something now as we as we just try
[41:34] to build my foundation. We're justified
[41:37] by faith. So, he's saying, you have
[41:39] faith, you're justified by it. We have
[41:41] peace with God. By whom also we have
[41:43] access by faith into this grace wherein
[41:47] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[41:49] glory of God. So, this is all sounding
[41:52] really good so far. We can all say amen.
[41:54] Verse three. And not only so, but we
[41:57] glory in tribulations also. Why did he
[42:00] have to put that in
[42:02] there? We glory in tribulations also,
[42:05] knowing that tribulation workketh
[42:07] patience. So, I want you to catch
[42:08] something now because this is this is
[42:10] just something that I've been on and and
[42:12] you know, I'm I'm praying, Lord, give me
[42:14] fresh inspiration because this is just
[42:16] pulsing in my heart still and I've been
[42:18] on it maybe too long and so, you know,
[42:21] get Job off the ash heap, but I'm just
[42:23] I'm just got to be obedient to the Lord,
[42:25] too.
[42:27] But we we we we glory in tribulation.
[42:29] So, that the faith is there, but after
[42:32] the faith, there's tribulation. So, you
[42:36] know, there's just been a lot of people
[42:38] who have told, "Well, it's because
[42:40] you're going through this or you're not
[42:42] healed yet or whatever because you don't
[42:44] have faith." And I and I and I can't go
[42:46] along with that. May maybe the Lord will
[42:49] swing me around someday, but I just I
[42:51] can't go along with telling somebody you
[42:52] don't have faith. I can't go along with
[42:54] telling somebody you don't have the Holy
[42:56] Ghost. Only God knows if they have the
[42:58] Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost is
[42:59] given, but it's also a growth into
[43:01] perfection. So we can have the Holy
[43:03] Ghost and we can be making, you know,
[43:06] kind of fumbling along and things, but
[43:08] but it's not without the Holy Ghost. So
[43:09] we got to be careful. But that's good,
[43:12] you know. So it it's just it's just to
[43:14] tell somebody that, but we find that
[43:16] they they have faith and yet there's
[43:18] there's this other side after you have
[43:21] faith that you have to go through
[43:22] tribulation. Yeah.
[43:24] So, and he says, "Knowing that
[43:27] tribulation workketh patience, and
[43:30] patience experience, and experience
[43:32] hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,
[43:34] because the love of God is shed abroad
[43:36] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which
[43:38] is given unto us." But it's it's not
[43:40] until after you're you're you're you're
[43:43] getting patience in you. You're getting
[43:45] you have faith. You know, you look at
[43:47] the stature of a perfect man. Faith is
[43:49] the is the is the is the uh foundation
[43:51] stone. Well, then as we go up then then
[43:53] you add patience to it. You add all
[43:55] these things. So you have faith but you
[43:57] still have there's still character
[43:58] building. That's right. James chapter 1
[44:02] and verse two. My brethren, count it all
[44:03] joy. Count it all joy when you fall into
[44:07] diverse temptations, knowing this that
[44:09] the trying of your faith workketh
[44:13] patience. And then but let patience have
[44:16] a perfect work that ye may be perfect
[44:18] and entire wanting nothing. So this is
[44:21] this is again you're going to fall
[44:23] you're going to have temptation when you
[44:25] become a Christian that isn't a life of
[44:27] flower and bed of ease. It's that's
[44:30] that's when you become a Christian when
[44:31] you get filled with the Holy Ghost. That
[44:33] that's when the battle starts. That's
[44:36] that's into the promised land. And what
[44:37] did they do in the promised land? They
[44:39] fought for every step that they took.
[44:41] And I tell you, as you as you grow in
[44:43] the Lord and as you get some experience
[44:45] behind you and and and things, you know,
[44:48] you you you you just start to say, you
[44:50] know what, you fight for every inch and
[44:52] sometimes you get knocked back, but some
[44:55] but then you you just get back up and
[44:57] you got to keep fighting because a
[44:58] righteous man will fall seven times.
[45:01] A righteous man will fall seven times,
[45:03] but he's going to get back up one more.
[45:05] But it's the one who works in mischief.
[45:07] He's going to stay down and he's going
[45:09] to just kind of well okay s sur whatever
[45:12] it will be will be and he quits fighting
[45:14] he just here lay down and take it. But a
[45:16] righteous man is going to get up one
[45:18] more time then he falls. But it's so
[45:20] it's the trying of your faith that works
[45:23] patience. Your faith has to be tried.
[45:26] Every every son that cometh to God is is
[45:28] tried. He's he's he's he's chastised
[45:31] because if you're not chastised then
[45:33] you're not a son. Amen. That's the
[45:35] scripture. And let me just I'm going to
[45:37] grab a scripture for you because I
[45:40] thought I could remember it. It's as
[45:42] short as Jesus wept. And now that I'm up
[45:44] here, I can't remember it. So,
[45:47] it's
[45:50] Luke. I know it's in Luke. I just I just
[45:54] want to get it because it's Jesus's
[45:59] words. Luke 21 verse 19. In your
[46:02] patience possess ye your soul. Yeah,
[46:05] that's good. Impatience possess you your
[46:07] soul. Well, what what do you have to go
[46:09] through in order to get patience? Well,
[46:12] James told us, these other writers told
[46:14] us it you have to go through tribulation
[46:16] for your patient to in order to get
[46:18] patience. Because you remember a
[46:20] character, character isn't a isn't
[46:23] something that's just handed to you.
[46:24] Character is a victory. And so, you have
[46:26] to go through things in order to get
[46:28] this character because patience is a
[46:30] virtue. You have to go through things in
[46:32] order to build patience.
[46:34] I meant to set a timer and I didn't. So,
[46:37] u we'll just do our best.
[46:40] So, suffering brings patience, works
[46:44] tribulation to bring patience, of
[46:46] course. Now, patience makes love and
[46:48] makes trust. This is brother Brandham
[46:50] talking. Now, faithful and patience go
[46:53] together. In fact, patience is the
[46:55] outcome of faithfulness. For it says in
[46:58] James 1:3, "The trying of your faith
[47:00] workketh patience." There is absolutely
[47:03] no other way in which to gain patience.
[47:05] It has to come by the trial of your
[47:07] faith. Romans 5:3. Tribulation workketh
[47:10] patience. How highly God regards his his
[47:13] outworking of our patience is seen in
[47:15] James 1:4. But let patience have a
[47:18] perfect work that ye may be perfect and
[47:21] entire, lacking nothing. How do you get
[47:24] there? Through the trying of your faith.
[47:26] Through patience. God's will is is for
[47:29] us is to be per is perfection and that
[47:32] perfection is patience waiting on God
[47:36] and waiting for God. This is the process
[47:39] of character development. That is so
[47:41] good. So we pray God develop my
[47:43] character. God let me have a godly
[47:45] character. But I don't know if we really
[47:47] realize hopefully you still pray that. I
[47:49] mean if you're a son of God you're going
[47:51] to get it anyway. But you know when we
[47:53] say that you know I mean I know we
[47:55] always say you you prayed for what? You
[47:56] prayed for
[47:57] patience,
[47:59] brother. Use wisdom. No, but but it it's
[48:03] it's it's it's the process of character
[48:05] development. When we say we want the
[48:07] character of God, there's a process to
[48:09] it. And and it's
[48:11] this. Now, um somebody sent me um I
[48:14] think it's I I you forgive me. I know it
[48:17] as ODS. I think it's our daily strength
[48:18] or or uh something along those lines.
[48:21] Brother Steven Coffee in that group did
[48:22] it. Hebrews uh 10:36. I just taken a a
[48:26] snippet from it. For ye have need of
[48:28] patience, that after ye have done the
[48:30] will of God, ye might receive the
[48:32] promise. This is just this is just
[48:34] blowing my mind away because after you
[48:37] receive the promise of God,
[48:40] um um what's he what's he say? Yeah, you
[48:42] might receive the promise uh after
[48:45] you've done the will of God. After
[48:46] you've done the will of God, it's going
[48:48] to take some patience in order to get
[48:51] the promise. Right. The word patience
[48:53] that Paul uses in the book of Hebrews
[48:55] means endurance. Endurance means the
[48:57] ability to endure hard things over a
[48:59] long period of time. So I guess what's
[49:03] what's kind of led me to this thought is
[49:06] just watching people in their trials,
[49:08] going through trials myself, but
[49:10] watching people go through trials and
[49:13] and and by all means, God does miracles
[49:17] today just the same. He's the same
[49:18] yesterday, today, and forever. So, not
[49:20] for one minute do I say God the days of
[49:23] miracles has passed, but I just I feel
[49:26] like and and you know, let me let me
[49:28] just give you a testimony. You might
[49:30] have seen it. Sharon Van W in our church
[49:32] going through cancer and different
[49:34] things. God healed her. It it it it came
[49:37] back and she just the other day got a
[49:39] had another MRI scan just looking at
[49:42] what treatment do we go forward with and
[49:44] God completely took it from her without
[49:46] the medical treatment. Amen. Amen.
[49:50] Amen. So, so you you know, you come too
[49:53] late to say God doesn't do miracles, but
[49:56] it wasn't an overnight healing. That was
[49:59] something that Sister Sharon had to
[50:01] endure. That was So, I'm watching people
[50:03] and I'm watching the length of trial
[50:05] sometimes and oh my goodness, it's just
[50:07] God, you know, you you you know, you
[50:09] just you just pray and you say, "If if
[50:12] God is with us, then then where is the
[50:14] God of Elijah? Where is the God that
[50:16] does the miracles? Why is this taking so
[50:19] long?" Well, I believe friends that
[50:21] we're we're so late in the day. We're so
[50:24] close to the coming of the Lord that it
[50:26] said that that unless time was shortened
[50:28] that no flesh would be saved. So that's
[50:31] I mean that's no flesh. That so you
[50:33] can't say well oh but brother that's the
[50:35] sons of God are in there. Well the time
[50:37] shortened for the sons of God. But if
[50:39] time was continued on then this is
[50:41] saying no one's saved. So God's having
[50:44] to short the time. And I just think, my
[50:46] goodness, you know, it's just the the
[50:47] the the the sexual things that we have
[50:50] to endure and and see and and
[50:52] everything. It's just gotten so bad. And
[50:54] and so I think, you know, the we're
[50:57] crying out, "God, come quickly, Lord
[50:59] Jesus." But but you know, so it's just
[51:02] the length of these things has just been
[51:04] been just turning over in my heart and
[51:07] wondering, well, why is that? But so
[51:09] endurance means the ability to do hard
[51:11] things over a long period of time. As a
[51:13] believer, you have the power of God
[51:15] behind you. If you stand in his word,
[51:17] you can endure the test of time in the
[51:19] harshest of circumstances. The Lord is
[51:21] faithful and always with you. When you
[51:23] have endured and you keep on going, you
[51:26] will receive the promise because
[51:28] remember, it's not him that starts, but
[51:30] him that finishes the race.
[51:33] So, keep pressing on in faith. Don't
[51:34] give up. Now, I came across just as
[51:37] I've, you know, going through that that
[51:38] that trial of of of sickness that I went
[51:41] through and things. I' I came across
[51:43] this quote and and I've been dying to
[51:45] read it. I got to read it the other
[51:46] night to a to a group and so I'm going
[51:48] to read it to you
[51:49] tonight. Revelations 3:10. This is this
[51:52] is Let me tell you where this is because
[51:53] I'm going to give you just a little
[51:55] homework. Um school's out for the
[51:57] summer. We don't do homework, but this
[52:00] is just good. It's it's you should do
[52:01] it. The Philadelphiaian Church Age um
[52:04] exposition of the church age book and
[52:06] it's under the eulogy and the promise.
[52:09] So, Revelations 3:10, because thou hast
[52:11] kept the word of my patience, this is
[52:13] this is Christ talking. Because thou has
[52:15] kept the word of my patience, I also
[52:17] will keep thee from the hour of
[52:19] temptation, which shall come upon the
[52:20] world to try them that dwell upon the
[52:23] earth. Now, now I know I'm reading, but
[52:26] really try to lock in because this is a
[52:28] key I I think to my message to you
[52:30] tonight. What does he mean by the word
[52:32] of patience? Hebrews
[52:34] 6:13-15. For when God made promise to
[52:37] Abraham, because he could swear by no
[52:39] greater, he swore by himself, saying,
[52:41] "Surely blessing, I will bless thee, and
[52:43] multiplying I will multiply thee." And
[52:45] so after he had patiently endured, he
[52:48] obtained the promise. So Abraham is
[52:49] given this great promise.
[52:52] Okay? You see, the spirit is speaking
[52:55] about the word of God, which is given to
[52:57] us. To wait for the fulfillment of that
[53:00] word required patience even as it did in
[53:02] the case of Abraham. He endured as
[53:05] seeing him who is invisible. He was
[53:08] patient and then the word finally was
[53:11] fulfilled. So I just I just want to step
[53:14] back. I'm going to get ahead of myself,
[53:15] but I told you I don't like my notes
[53:17] anyway. It it's
[53:19] it's he endured as seeing he him who's
[53:22] invisible. He was patient and and and
[53:25] then the word was finally fulfilled. So
[53:27] when we pray, this this is why I'm
[53:29] saying we we we were blessed in this
[53:32] generation to have a prophet of God.
[53:35] And in that in those meetings, we have
[53:37] it on tape. We hear these things where
[53:40] somebody comes up and he he, you know,
[53:42] okay, well, it's, you know, he'll even
[53:44] say it's even obvious you you have
[53:46] crippled legs, you know, your crippled
[53:48] hand, but you know, and then he prays
[53:50] for me. Oh, there they go. They're
[53:51] taking off around the building and
[53:53] you're on a stretcher. just get up off
[53:54] the stretcher in the name of the Lord
[53:56] Jesus Christ. So, you know, your name's
[53:58] this. You live here and this and that.
[53:59] And he says, and oh, there they go.
[54:01] They're up off their stretcher. Just
[54:02] just get your legs. You'll be okay. And
[54:04] there they go. And so, we're used to
[54:06] hearing that. And so, we think, well,
[54:08] bless God. I'm going to go get prayed
[54:09] for. I'm going to walk out of here well.
[54:11] And then when you don't walk out of
[54:13] here, well, you say, "Well, what was
[54:15] wrong?
[54:16] What happened? What was what was what
[54:20] was that?" And and so you you understand
[54:22] God did something great in this hour and
[54:25] it builds our faith to hear those
[54:27] things, but then we can come with a
[54:29] false expectation and we think we're
[54:32] standing on the word, but it's our own
[54:34] interpretation of the word. Now, I know
[54:37] I know that's going to not sit well with
[54:39] some of you too good, but just bear with
[54:41] me. We'll keep going. We'll get through
[54:42] this together.
[54:46] This is the way God teaches his people
[54:48] patience. Why? If he fulfilled, now
[54:51] listen, that's good. Now I'm going to
[54:53] preach to mature sons and daughters.
[54:56] If he fulfilled his word and physical
[54:58] manifestation, the very instant you
[55:01] prayed, you would never learn patience,
[55:04] but would become more impatient with
[55:06] life. Let me show you this truth even
[55:09] more fully set forth. Hebrews 11:17. By
[55:12] faith, Abraham, when he was tried,
[55:14] offered up Isaac, and he that had
[55:16] received uh and he that had received the
[55:19] promise, the word of God, offered up his
[55:20] only begotten son. There it is. Abraham
[55:23] was
[55:24] tried after he received the word of
[55:27] promise.
[55:29] Most think that as soon as we pray in
[55:31] Jesus' name over the good promises of
[55:33] God, that there could not be a trial.
[55:36] But here it says that Abraham was tried
[55:38] after he received the promise. Now,
[55:41] there's just a little feeling of
[55:42] resistance. I just want to make it clear
[55:44] that I'm I'm reading the words of the
[55:46] prophet.
[55:48] But here it was that Abraham was tried
[55:50] after he received the promise. Um, that
[55:53] is exactly correct. According to the
[55:55] psalmist referring to Joseph, Psalms
[55:57] 105:19, until the time that his word
[56:00] came, the word of the Lord tried him.
[56:03] God gives us exceeding great and
[56:05] precious promises. He has promised to
[56:07] fulfill them, and he will. Yes, he will.
[56:10] But from the time we pray until the time
[56:12] we get the answer, we must learn to
[56:14] receive patience into our souls. For
[56:17] only in patience do we possess life.
[56:21] May God help us to learn this lesson
[56:23] even as we know the people of the sixth
[56:25] age learn patience. Of the people of the
[56:27] Hebrews faith chapter learned patience.
[56:30] Uh uh we we read the history of the
[56:33] lives of these great Christians. What a
[56:35] contrast we see between their lives and
[56:37] ours. for they were so patient and
[56:40] quiet. And today we are all but overcome
[56:43] in overpatience and haste. And that's
[56:46] not completely our fault because we're
[56:48] living in a Satan's Eden in the leady
[56:50] and age where you can get it now. And so
[56:53] it's it's not just just to say, well, we
[56:56] know the promises of God. We heard what
[56:58] happened. This this generation is is
[57:01] could I could I word it this way? Is
[57:03] breeding us to be impatient.
[57:06] It's breeding us to to be hurry up and
[57:10] wait.
[57:12] Yes, sir.
[57:21] I'll testify. I I've been I've actually
[57:24] been sick for a while here, too. and um
[57:27] found out that I had pneumonia, got on a
[57:30] steroid and antibiotic, went, you know,
[57:33] a ways past that and went back to the
[57:35] doctor because I still wasn't feeling
[57:37] well and I'm on another antibiotic. So,
[57:39] every now and then if I cough, it's just
[57:41] lingering
[57:42] [Music]
[57:46] pneumonia. May God help us to learn this
[57:48] lesson even as we know the people. Okay.
[57:50] So, um, all right. He goes on to
[57:54] say to say to them, "Because ye have
[57:57] taken my word and lived it, and thereby
[57:59] become patient, I will keep you from the
[58:01] hour of temptation, which shall come
[58:03] upon the world to them that dwell upon
[58:06] the earth." Now, here again, we see the
[58:08] overlapping of the two ages. And this
[58:10] promise has to do with the end of the
[58:12] gentile period, which culminates in the
[58:14] great tribulation. You say, "Well,
[58:16] brother, are you saying we're going
[58:17] through tribulation? I also will keep
[58:19] thee from the hour of temptation, which
[58:21] shall come upon the world to try them
[58:23] that dwell upon the earth. This verse is
[58:25] not a declaration that the true church
[58:27] will go into and through the
[58:28] tribulation. If it meant that, it would
[58:30] have said it. But it said, I will keep
[58:32] thee from the hour of temptation. This
[58:35] temptation is exactly like the
[58:36] temptation in Eden. It will be very
[58:39] inviting proposition held up in direct
[58:41] opposition to God's commanded word. And
[58:44] yet from the standpoint of human
[58:45] reasoning, it will be it will seem so
[58:48] very right, so enlightening and
[58:49] life-giving as to fool the world only
[58:52] the very elect will not be fooled. So
[58:54] your homework would be to pick it up
[58:56] from this and you'll see what's supposed
[58:58] to happen from now until the coming of
[59:00] the Lord. It's just a decent sized
[59:03] paragraph, but it's really
[59:05] good. So this just brought me to to
[59:08] realize why does God linger?
[59:11] Why do we go through such times of
[59:13] waiting on the Lord? There's a great
[59:16] purpose in God's mind. We will need
[59:18] patience in order for it. It it would
[59:20] deceive the very elect if it were
[59:22] possible. You need patience in order to
[59:24] not be deceived.
[59:26] Why isn't it possible? Because she's
[59:28] learned patience and thus God grants her
[59:30] to be kept from the hour of temptation.
[59:33] And and and I say, you know, when you
[59:35] read, if you would just read the rest of
[59:37] that that little eulogy there, because
[59:39] you'll see exactly with this new pope
[59:41] and different things happening. I mean,
[59:43] you you're looking, they're they're
[59:44] they're saying, well, we're going to cut
[59:46] funds and we're going to we're going to
[59:48] come up with the money to to to balance
[59:50] this budget. Well, right now, everyone's
[59:52] crying, hey, the budget's we're still
[59:54] the debt's still going up. We're at 36
[59:57] trillion. And then you look at, you
[59:59] know, not saying it is. I'm not just,
[1:00:02] you know, could it be you get a man in
[1:00:04] there that's making all these deals? And
[1:00:07] so just a week ago or so, um, uh, the
[1:00:12] news said that Trump was actually
[1:00:14] encouraging Ukraine and Russia to go
[1:00:16] speak to the Pope who gave an invitation
[1:00:18] to come to the Vatican. And so you just
[1:00:20] I'm not saying it is, but you just say,
[1:00:23] could it be? I mean, we know we're
[1:00:26] closer than we've ever been. That's
[1:00:28] right. And so these things are just
[1:00:29] they're going to start firing off
[1:00:31] quicker than what we can what we know is
[1:00:33] happening. So it's just it's good to be
[1:00:36] to know where we're at. So I just I just
[1:00:38] want to talk just a little bit about
[1:00:39] faith.
[1:00:42] What time did you give it to
[1:00:46] me? I know I know you went a little
[1:00:48] long. You were a little long. So I got a
[1:00:51] little bit of length. I can go. I'm just
[1:00:54] teasing. I so as I've been listening to
[1:00:57] different things and and just just over
[1:00:59] time pull pulling notes together I came
[1:01:01] across something brother Lonnie Jenkins
[1:01:03] said and he said it hinders our faith
[1:01:06] looking for something that God didn't
[1:01:07] promise rather than resting in the word.
[1:01:12] He said we scar our own faith looking
[1:01:14] for something God didn't
[1:01:16] promise. We can come presuming or even
[1:01:19] be
[1:01:20] enthusiastic. Brother Brandham said
[1:01:22] these things rather than it being true
[1:01:26] faith. Enthusiasm has the opposite
[1:01:28] effect and hinders our faith when we
[1:01:30] don't get what we're looking for. So you
[1:01:33] come and you're or you you you know you
[1:01:35] come to somebody and you say, "Thus
[1:01:36] sayith the Lord, God spoke to me and
[1:01:38] this is going to happen to you and then
[1:01:39] it doesn't happen." That actually
[1:01:41] hinders faith. That doesn't encourage
[1:01:44] faith. That hinders faith. And you and
[1:01:46] then you know I just just gonna deal
[1:01:48] with this for a moment because I feel to
[1:01:50] you say, "Oh, that that was that was
[1:01:51] them. They didn't believe." No, you need
[1:01:54] to go back and check your prophecy.
[1:01:56] Yeah. Come on now. Because if you
[1:01:58] misspoke and it wasn't the Lord, then
[1:02:00] you should be repenting. Because we know
[1:02:03] that that brother Brandham said, if if
[1:02:05] somebody prophesies and it doesn't come
[1:02:06] to pass, there's an evil spirit working
[1:02:08] among you. And so we must be careful. We
[1:02:11] must be certain that God is speaking and
[1:02:13] it's not just our enthusiasm. You know,
[1:02:16] I I I have a great feeling for people.
[1:02:18] And so when I see somebody in a need, I
[1:02:21] just, you know, I in myself, I can feel
[1:02:24] faith rising. God, I want that person to
[1:02:27] be well. And if I'm not careful, I can
[1:02:29] go to that person and say, you know,
[1:02:32] God, God, God just laid you on my heart.
[1:02:36] This is the way to do it. God laid you
[1:02:37] on my heart. Can I pray for you? Sure.
[1:02:40] But if you say, "God, God said, you
[1:02:42] know, God told me this and this is going
[1:02:44] to happen to you. I just I believe it. I
[1:02:46] feel it with all my heart." You better
[1:02:48] be careful
[1:02:50] because if it doesn't come to pass, then
[1:02:52] you got you got two problems working
[1:02:54] there. You and the person's faith could
[1:02:56] be hindered by you.
[1:02:59] Yes, sir.
[1:03:04] And if you need if you need an example
[1:03:06] in the prophet's
[1:03:08] life, then if you go read the
[1:03:10] supernatural books, you'll find where
[1:03:12] he's calling out for miracles. He's
[1:03:14] calling the miracle lines. And the angel
[1:03:16] of the Lord rebukes him for it. And he
[1:03:19] tells the prophet, he says, "You're
[1:03:21] putting too much emphasis on miracles."
[1:03:23] Now, I want you to I want you to catch
[1:03:25] this. Yeah. The angel of the Lord, who
[1:03:28] was doing the healing through a prophet,
[1:03:31] telling him what to say, discerning the
[1:03:33] hearts of the people. And and you think,
[1:03:36] you know, I mean, brother Brandon was
[1:03:37] sincere as sincere could be. This is the
[1:03:39] listen, this is our messenger. This is
[1:03:42] the prophet of this day. And thank God
[1:03:45] for his transparency because he said I
[1:03:48] was I was doing wrong because I was
[1:03:50] saying if you want to see a miracle then
[1:03:52] then bring me your worst case. And the
[1:03:54] angel of the Lord corrected him and he
[1:03:56] said, "You're putting too much emphasis
[1:03:57] on a miracle if you if you keep going
[1:04:00] the way you are. If the people won't
[1:04:02] believe unless they see a miracle." Now,
[1:04:05] this is the angel of the Lord who said,
[1:04:07] "If you can get the people to believe,
[1:04:09] then nothing will stand in the way, not
[1:04:11] even cancer." And now he's saying, "Hey,
[1:04:14] you're doing this wrong. This isn't what
[1:04:15] I told you to do. You're going to you're
[1:04:18] going to call for miracles, and unless
[1:04:19] they see it, they're not going to
[1:04:21] believe you." So you're you're really
[1:04:23] the prophet was in in jeopardy of
[1:04:26] hindering his commission direct from the
[1:04:29] angel of the Lord.
[1:04:31] Amen. Are you with me?
[1:04:35] I I don't believe I'm preaching strange
[1:04:37] doctrine.
[1:04:40] So sorry I didn't catch that in time.
[1:04:45] So what do what do we do? What do we do
[1:04:47] when we when we pray for somebody? when
[1:04:49] you come up here and and you you you
[1:04:52] know you're following scripture, right?
[1:04:55] Let them lay let the call for the
[1:04:56] elders. Let them lay hands on the sick
[1:04:58] and they shall recover,
[1:05:00] right? Anoint anoint with oil the prayer
[1:05:03] of faith will save the will save the
[1:05:05] sick. We have all of these promises in
[1:05:07] God's
[1:05:08] word. So, what's the what's the what's
[1:05:10] the proper way to come to the
[1:05:12] front? Well, I'm I'm going to I'm going
[1:05:15] to just do say some other things. I'm
[1:05:17] already
[1:05:19] I'm already way out there.
[1:05:22] Let me say this so I don't forget it.
[1:05:24] But I believe that the way to come up
[1:05:27] and to to have those to to to um what's
[1:05:31] the right word? Um to carry out the word
[1:05:34] of God is to come up when you come up to
[1:05:37] be prayed for. You you you keep it in
[1:05:40] your mind. Keep the scripture in your
[1:05:41] mind. They'll lay hands on the sick,
[1:05:43] they shall recover. They lay hands on
[1:05:45] the sick, they shall recover.
[1:05:47] anoint with oil. Pastor, would you
[1:05:49] anoint me with oil? I I don't feel good.
[1:05:51] Not well, we'll get to that in a minute.
[1:05:54] Would you anoint me with oil? I don't
[1:05:55] feel good. The thing to do is to stand
[1:05:57] right there on those scriptures. To
[1:06:00] stand right there on the word of God,
[1:06:02] not just healing. Whatever you have need
[1:06:04] of finances, I my father owns a cattle
[1:06:07] on a thousand hills. You know, you you
[1:06:10] you we grab these scriptures. This is
[1:06:12] you're keeping your keep your eyes
[1:06:14] between the horses on the tree, the tree
[1:06:17] of Calvary. Keep your eyes on Calvary.
[1:06:19] But you come up and you say, you know,
[1:06:21] this is my need. And and you get you you
[1:06:23] get prayed for. Thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:06:25] you. You go away rejoicing. The prophet
[1:06:27] said, go away rejoicing. He he would
[1:06:29] tell you, he said, I I might not see
[1:06:31] that they were healed, but go away
[1:06:32] rejoicing. Just keep claiming the word.
[1:06:35] And you go away and you stand on the
[1:06:37] word of God. But you don't come up here
[1:06:39] saying, "I'm going to leave here right
[1:06:41] now healed." Yeah. There you go. But you
[1:06:44] stand on the word. You hold on to the
[1:06:46] word and let God work the timing out.
[1:06:48] There you go. Your responsibility isn't
[1:06:50] the timing. Yeah. Your responsibility is
[1:06:53] just to believe the word of God. And if
[1:06:56] you believe the word of God, there's two
[1:06:57] instances that I had that I'm not going
[1:06:59] to read the quotes, but but um it's it's
[1:07:02] the there was two women come through the
[1:07:03] prayer line. Is it okay to talk about
[1:07:06] the prayer lines?
[1:07:07] to to to to they came up and they got
[1:07:11] prayed for. They came the prophet laid
[1:07:13] the prophet talked to them. He he told
[1:07:15] them where they lived. He told them
[1:07:16] their names, right? They walked away
[1:07:19] from that platform not not with a with
[1:07:22] with not a physical manifestation of
[1:07:24] that healing. And you know the prophet
[1:07:27] said it was probably two or three weeks
[1:07:29] later she was washing her dishes, one of
[1:07:32] them, right? And as she was washing her
[1:07:34] dishes, she just felt something come
[1:07:36] over her and and I think it was the
[1:07:38] gorder, I can't remember. Fell off.
[1:07:41] There was a man come through. And you
[1:07:43] remember he
[1:07:44] said he was he was blind. I think I
[1:07:47] think it was John John Ryan, I think,
[1:07:49] was his name. He comes on the
[1:07:52] platform and and and the prophet tells
[1:07:56] him, you know, just not not the prophet.
[1:07:58] Now, let's back that up. Not the
[1:08:00] prophet, Jesus Christ.
[1:08:03] Jesus Christ through the prophet says,
[1:08:06] "This is this is your name. This is what
[1:08:08] you're here for." And he and he goes off
[1:08:10] the
[1:08:11] platform. He comes back on the
[1:08:14] platform and Brother Brandham says he
[1:08:17] says, "Didn't didn't I pray for you?"
[1:08:20] "Yeah, you prayed for me, but but I'm I
[1:08:22] I can't see yet." He said, "I'm I'm I'm
[1:08:24] I'm still blind. I can't see yet. I I
[1:08:27] thought you said I was well." And
[1:08:28] Brother Brandham says, "I thought you
[1:08:30] said you believed.
[1:08:32] There you go. Yeah. Well, what do I do?
[1:08:37] And and and and he says, I am going to
[1:08:40] get so
[1:08:43] messed up here.
[1:08:51] Let me just let me just find it because
[1:08:52] I got it at the bottom of my notes just
[1:08:54] in case. And now we're
[1:08:56] here. Um he says, "I do believe you. I
[1:08:59] have no reason not to believe you.
[1:09:01] You've you've you've told me all things
[1:09:03] in my life. I don't know what to do.
[1:09:06] There was a woman back there testifying
[1:09:07] of a goiter a few minutes ago and it's
[1:09:09] gone. Then if you and I said then if you
[1:09:11] believe me why are you questioning me?
[1:09:13] I'm telling you the word of God. He said
[1:09:16] what must I do? He said knowing he was a
[1:09:19] Catholic and had to have some physical
[1:09:21] thing that he could hold to just keep
[1:09:23] testifying. By his stripes I'm healed.
[1:09:26] He went away from that meeting still
[1:09:29] blind. Am I doing that,
[1:09:33] brother? Just keeping you awake on a
[1:09:35] Wednesday night.
[1:09:37] He went away
[1:09:40] Thursday.
[1:09:42] Hello. Where am
[1:09:45] I? So he went away still blind again.
[1:09:49] Brother Brandham said two or three
[1:09:50] weeks. That man was going coming in
[1:09:52] tearing up meetings. You know, thank God
[1:09:55] I'm healed. Thank God. And he goes and
[1:09:58] he sits in a barber chair one day and
[1:10:00] they're starting to make fun of him.
[1:10:02] Thank God. He says, "I thought you said
[1:10:04] you're healed. I praise God, I'm
[1:10:05] healed." And then all of a sudden, his
[1:10:08] eyes were open two or three weeks later
[1:10:10] after being in the presence of the angel
[1:10:11] of the Lord after after having the the
[1:10:15] prophet touch him. Are you with me? Two
[1:10:18] or three weeks, right? So, we can't come
[1:10:21] up here. We can't we can't sit in our
[1:10:23] seats. Let me get to this because this
[1:10:24] is this is something that God I am just
[1:10:30] go ahead God.
[1:10:33] So the scripture says they'll lay hands
[1:10:36] on the sick and they shall be shall
[1:10:38] recover. Do you know that's a Jewish
[1:10:40] tradition?
[1:10:43] The Jews had to have something like
[1:10:45] that. Lay hands on the sick. You know
[1:10:46] the scripture that well if you just come
[1:10:48] to my house and if you do that we're not
[1:10:51] Jews. We're Gentiles. We're called to
[1:10:54] something greater. Yeah. And and and
[1:10:56] that's that's a lot to say because the
[1:10:58] Jews, we know they're God's people, but
[1:11:00] you're Gentiles. You're God's bride.
[1:11:02] You're the bride of Jesus Christ. So,
[1:11:04] you have a different commission. You
[1:11:06] have a different you have a different
[1:11:08] anointing upon your faith that you don't
[1:11:10] have to wait to come up to the end of
[1:11:13] the service. You don't have to wait to
[1:11:15] have the pastor lay hands on you. And
[1:11:18] you certainly don't have to wait for a
[1:11:20] special meeting when they're going to
[1:11:21] call a prayer line or or or the certain
[1:11:24] minister is going to be there because
[1:11:26] you I mean that's great if you have
[1:11:27] faith in them. That's great. But you
[1:11:29] know you you know brother Hannah you can
[1:11:31] have your wife lay hands on you. That's
[1:11:33] right. And that's the fulfillment of the
[1:11:35] scripture. They'll lay hands on the
[1:11:36] sick. Why? Because you're a believer.
[1:11:38] Amen. And these signs shall follow them
[1:11:40] that believe. And so we're Gentiles. And
[1:11:42] so while Peter yet spake the words, they
[1:11:46] received the Holy Ghost. So while the
[1:11:48] word is going forth, if God will anoint
[1:11:50] your faith, you can have your healing
[1:11:53] while I'm preaching.
[1:11:55] You don't have to come up front and have
[1:11:57] you're called to something greater. You
[1:11:59] remember the Gentile was the one who
[1:12:01] said, "But but Lord, even the dogs get
[1:12:03] the crumbs from the table." The Gentile
[1:12:06] was the one that said, "I'm not worthy
[1:12:08] for you to come under my house. Just
[1:12:10] speak the word."
[1:12:13] That's what you're called to. So that's
[1:12:14] what you know, brother Brandham said. He
[1:12:17] said, "I long for the day." There's
[1:12:18] something about those steps. He said, "I
[1:12:20] long for the day to to see." He said,
[1:12:23] "I've only seen it one time." He said,
[1:12:25] "I long for the day to see the entire
[1:12:27] congregation healed at one spontaneous
[1:12:30] move of God." He says, "I've seen it one
[1:12:33] time." They were ly they were piling up
[1:12:35] CS. They were piling up stretchers. They
[1:12:37] were just everything. And he said, "I've
[1:12:39] seen it one time. I long to see it
[1:12:42] again." And so, so he's he's trying to
[1:12:44] build faith. And and you know, I long to
[1:12:47] see that. I long to see when everyone in
[1:12:51] the congregation, what's the key?
[1:12:53] Accepts the word
[1:12:55] doesn't have some preconceived idea of
[1:12:58] what it means. Doesn't have some
[1:12:59] preconceived idea that I I must go up
[1:13:02] and have lay hands on, but but you
[1:13:04] believe in your seat that Jesus Christ
[1:13:07] is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:13:08] forever.
[1:13:10] He He can pass by you tonight while
[1:13:12] you're in your sleep. He He's walking
[1:13:14] the aisles. The angels are on the
[1:13:16] outskirts watching there. We're in the
[1:13:19] presence of of heavenly beings tonight.
[1:13:22] There is no limitations to what you can
[1:13:25] have this evening. That's right. And you
[1:13:28] don't have to come up here to get it.
[1:13:29] That's right. You don't have to go
[1:13:31] through a prayer line to get it. That
[1:13:34] brother Brandham talks about the prayer
[1:13:35] lines and he says he says that he
[1:13:38] referring to laying on of hands. He said
[1:13:40] that's a Jewish tradition.
[1:13:42] the prayer lines. That's a tradition of
[1:13:44] of days gone by. Will we have prayer
[1:13:46] lines still? We will. Did Brother
[1:13:48] Brandham have prayer lines even though
[1:13:50] he said that he didn't want to? He did.
[1:13:52] Did he have altar calls? He did, but
[1:13:54] that wasn't the way it was supposed to
[1:13:56] be. Those are traditions that we look
[1:13:58] for as people as as human beings. But
[1:14:01] the the the thing to do is to believe
[1:14:04] the word of God. That's what we're
[1:14:06] called to. That's what that's what your
[1:14:09] your faith can be anointed to. So you
[1:14:12] say, "I'm I'm not there yet, Brother
[1:14:14] Brandon. I I I'm I'm failing. I'm just
[1:14:16] what what do I and we get worked up and
[1:14:18] No, no, no, no, no. Don't don't do that.
[1:14:20] Let me find you something here. Go all
[1:14:23] the way back up in my notes.
[1:14:29] Let me just read you. These are these
[1:14:30] are the prophet's words. Now, this is
[1:14:31] what I wanted to something I wanted to
[1:14:33] say. Let's say, praise the Lord. There's
[1:14:35] the cursedness of passing through the
[1:14:37] prayer line after after prayer line.
[1:14:39] When you accept your healing, don't you
[1:14:41] never go through another prayer line.
[1:14:44] You you let that settle it forever. See,
[1:14:46] every time you come back, it makes it
[1:14:48] that much harder. That much harder. That
[1:14:50] much harder. See, it breaks it. That's
[1:14:52] good. He actually says when you go
[1:14:54] through a prayer line and you come back
[1:14:55] now around, he said there's that
[1:14:57] cursedness of the prayer line. That's
[1:15:00] the prophet of God, not Brandon
[1:15:01] Cynakola. That's so I forgot what I was
[1:15:05] trying to find you.
[1:15:15] You know, Brother Brandham, he actually
[1:15:16] says, and I I've got it here, but I'm I
[1:15:18] am so lost in my notes. He says in in
[1:15:22] the trial, the message called the trial,
[1:15:25] he calls three three witnesses for for
[1:15:28] the unbelievers. And he says, he says,
[1:15:31] "Now I'm going to call to the stand, Mr.
[1:15:33] Impatient." And he says, "Oh, he's a
[1:15:36] he's a rascal."
[1:15:38] And it's that whole thing about about
[1:15:41] believing something that's not true in
[1:15:43] the word. And and that whole thing,
[1:15:45] that's that's where I got that from is
[1:15:46] the message of Mr. Impatient. He's a
[1:15:49] rascal. Um remember, and and I just I
[1:15:53] just love these words just jumped out to
[1:15:56] me. Remember, no longer how, no matter
[1:15:59] how much it lingers,
[1:16:02] yet it's got to happen. It's got to
[1:16:04] happen. He says in other places,
[1:16:05] sometimes God lingers.
[1:16:08] Sometimes God lingers. What's the
[1:16:10] purpose? Because you have to be you.
[1:16:12] Patience needs birthed in you. Patience
[1:16:15] needs to grow in you. You need to be
[1:16:16] perfected to the perfecting of the
[1:16:18] saints. How do you do it? Through
[1:16:20] patience, we learn how to possess these
[1:16:22] vessels. That's so good. Through
[1:16:24] patience, you learn how to possess your
[1:16:25] soul. Are you Are you with me tonight?
[1:16:28] If you give me just 15 minutes, we'll be
[1:16:31] done.
[1:16:37] Oh my Where do we Where do we grab from
[1:16:39] here?
[1:16:42] So, let me let me just encourage
[1:16:45] you. You come up and you get prayed for
[1:16:48] and you walk away and you don't notice
[1:16:50] anything different. Stand on the word of
[1:16:52] God. Amen.
[1:16:54] That doesn't mean you didn't get your
[1:16:55] healing. That's right. That means you've
[1:16:58] you've accepted the promise of God and
[1:17:00] now you have some endurance to go
[1:17:02] through before you receive the promise,
[1:17:05] before you receive the physical
[1:17:06] manifestation.
[1:17:08] Oh
[1:17:13] my goodness.
[1:17:16] Exodus 15 says God speaking for I am the
[1:17:19] Lord that health thee.
[1:17:22] Psalms 103, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:17:25] and forget not all his benefits." Don't
[1:17:27] you dare forget his benefits. Yeah,
[1:17:29] there you go. They're promised to you.
[1:17:32] Who forgiveth all thine iniquities? Who
[1:17:34] healthth all thy diseases? Hallelujah.
[1:17:38] Who redeemth thy life from destruction.
[1:17:40] Who crowneth thee with loving kindness
[1:17:42] and tender mercies. who satisfyth thy
[1:17:44] mouth with good things, so thy youth is
[1:17:47] renewed like the eagles. Amen. So good.
[1:17:50] After he had patiently endured, he he he
[1:17:53] uh he obtained the promise. Can you do
[1:17:55] this the same thing this morning? Can
[1:17:57] you set your faith and say, "It's thus
[1:18:00] sayeth the Lord." And no matter what
[1:18:01] comes or what does, whether today is
[1:18:03] easy, tomorrow's hard, the next day
[1:18:06] they're teasing you, the next day
[1:18:07] they're making fun of you, the next day
[1:18:09] they say I'm crazy, I endure. Can you
[1:18:11] say amen? Endure is patience. You need
[1:18:14] patience to endure. After not before he
[1:18:17] endured, but after he endured, he
[1:18:19] obtained the promise. Amen. Oh my, there
[1:18:21] it is. You see, brother, that shakes all
[1:18:24] devils and everything else
[1:18:26] away. No matter how hard it comes, what
[1:18:29] it looks like, what anybody says, I want
[1:18:32] I I want to with patience, not fretting.
[1:18:34] Now, person can't have patience and
[1:18:37] fretting at the same time. You just got
[1:18:40] to set your sails right straight there.
[1:18:42] and walk right on. No matter what takes
[1:18:44] place, move right on. Listen, I'm going
[1:18:46] to say something. Look, faith, this is
[1:18:48] what I was wanting. Faith is
[1:18:50] unconscious.
[1:18:52] Amen. You believe it. That's good. You
[1:18:56] you we're we're constantly because we
[1:18:58] know, he says, if if you can just
[1:19:00] believe, if you have faith and you,
[1:19:01] well, God, if I can just believe, if I
[1:19:04] can just have faith, what do you do? You
[1:19:05] start fretting. Yeah. Because I know I
[1:19:07] got to have faith. Without faith, it's
[1:19:09] impossible to please God. So God, I got
[1:19:11] to I got to have faith. God, give me
[1:19:12] faith. God, give me faith. And you start
[1:19:14] fretting. What are you doing? You're
[1:19:15] actually hindering it. Faith is
[1:19:17] something that's unconscious.
[1:19:21] You got faith and you don't know it.
[1:19:24] That's right. A little further down, he
[1:19:27] was simply Jesus calming the storm. He
[1:19:29] was simply unconscious of fear or
[1:19:31] anything around him. That's right.
[1:19:33] Whether it was going to happen or
[1:19:34] whether it wasn't going to happen, he
[1:19:36] knowed it was going to happen because
[1:19:38] God said so. You know it's going to
[1:19:40] happen because God said so. God said,
[1:19:43] "I'm the Lord that heals all your
[1:19:44] diseases." God said, "I've never seen my
[1:19:47] children forsaken or begging for bread."
[1:19:49] That's right. So, you know it's going to
[1:19:51] happen. Yes, sir.
[1:19:56] He didn't say, "Oh, have I prayed
[1:19:58] through?
[1:20:01] Wonder if I fasted long enough. Wonder
[1:20:04] if I did this." He just walked right on
[1:20:06] unconscious. That's right. He believed
[1:20:08] that God w said was the truth. The true
[1:20:11] the the the words must be fulfilled and
[1:20:14] he knowed that his life was to fulfill
[1:20:16] them. That's right. Your life is to
[1:20:18] fulfill the word of God. Amen. You're
[1:20:21] placed on this earth to fulfill the word
[1:20:23] of God. You are the word of God.
[1:20:27] Hallelujah. Walk unconscious of
[1:20:30] criticism. Walk unconscious unto the
[1:20:32] world. Walk as you walk in Christ. Walk
[1:20:35] with him, not paying any attention. The
[1:20:37] right hand or the left, just keep moving
[1:20:39] on. If something comes up in the church,
[1:20:42] walk with God. Hallelujah. If sickness
[1:20:44] strikes you, walk with God. If the
[1:20:46] neighbor don't like you, walk with God.
[1:20:48] Just keep on walking with God. Walk with
[1:20:51] God. Doctor says you're going to die,
[1:20:53] walk with God. Yeah. Doctor says you
[1:20:56] can't. Well, walk with God. Just walk
[1:20:58] with God. That's all. For God has
[1:21:00] promised, I'll never leave you nor
[1:21:02] forsake you. Hallelujah. I'll be with
[1:21:04] you to the end of the world. And he took
[1:21:06] an oath by that covenant that he gave
[1:21:08] you. And he could and he would confirm
[1:21:10] it. Just walk with God. Then you'll have
[1:21:13] your ups and downs.
[1:21:15] That's right. Don't worry. That's good.
[1:21:18] You got to go through brier patches,
[1:21:20] over sharp rocks, over bluffs, down over
[1:21:23] the hillside, up through the mountains,
[1:21:25] over waters. But God, but walk with God.
[1:21:28] Yes, sir. There's so many hills to climb
[1:21:30] upward. You've heard that old song, but
[1:21:33] how little it'll seem when you get to
[1:21:35] the other end.
[1:21:36] So good. Amen.
[1:21:40] Hallelujah. That's good. Well, to be
[1:21:42] fair, I think you gave it to me at 7:22,
[1:21:47] so I think I've gone an hour.
[1:21:54] You're You're I just Thank you again.
[1:21:55] You're easy to preach to. I appreciate
[1:21:57] that.
[1:21:59] Musicians, if you want to come and if
[1:22:00] you want to stand to your feet, let me
[1:22:02] just try to just throw in a couple more
[1:22:04] things
[1:22:05] here. We're to run with patience.
[1:22:08] Patience is endurance. So, you could
[1:22:10] say, "We're to run with patience." We're
[1:22:12] to run with endurance. Patiently waiting
[1:22:14] for the fulfillment of prophecy. Brother
[1:22:17] Brandham said, "Faith waits with
[1:22:18] patience for the promised word to be
[1:22:20] fulfilled."
[1:22:23] Patience is mentioned many times in in
[1:22:26] in the in the message and in the
[1:22:28] scripture. Patience and longsuffering go
[1:22:31] hand in hand, right?
[1:22:40] Be patient with one another.
[1:22:42] Wait on one another. Be servants to one
[1:22:44] another. Don't be bigger than somebody
[1:22:46] else.
[1:22:47] Try to see how little you can be.
[1:22:52] Goodness, there
[1:23:06] was that that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:23:08] renew their strength. You say, "How can
[1:23:10] I wait any longer?" Just keep on
[1:23:11] waiting. When you've done all you can to
[1:23:13] stand, then stand. Just Just stand. How
[1:23:16] am I going to do it? Stand. He said it's
[1:23:19] the truth, and it's the truth. He said
[1:23:20] it'll happen. How? I don't know. But
[1:23:23] it'll happen. He said so. He promised
[1:23:26] it. If he promised it, it's got to
[1:23:28] happen. That's all. It can't waste. He
[1:23:31] don't waste words.
[1:23:33] That's good. Yeah. My there's just
[1:23:37] speaking of the young man named Garnet.
[1:23:39] He was preach brother Brandham's
[1:23:40] preaching a funeral and he and he let me
[1:23:43] just paraphrase this. He talks about
[1:23:45] this young man and and the young man
[1:23:47] said bound to uh I think a a wheelchair
[1:23:51] and he had um polio I think with is that
[1:23:55] the the iron lung he was in that tube
[1:23:58] and just just a what we would look at
[1:24:00] and say that what a what a miserable
[1:24:02] life what a bound life and but the young
[1:24:04] man said he said I wouldn't swap this
[1:24:07] for 10,000 lives like that looking at
[1:24:09] the other boys and hot rodding and
[1:24:11] drinking and gallivanting he said I
[1:24:13] wouldn't trade this because he knew the
[1:24:15] Lord.
[1:24:18] But God had to throw him in that stage.
[1:24:20] Brother Brandham said, that's to get out
[1:24:22] of him to serve the purpose. Look at his
[1:24:25] patience, his testimonies among you
[1:24:27] neighbors. Look what he was, what how
[1:24:30] his his little life was spoke to you uh
[1:24:33] many many of you that day of the
[1:24:34] judgment without that. That his life
[1:24:37] will testify right back against you. He
[1:24:39] was an example of what God wanted him.
[1:24:41] He served God's purpose. says, "As long
[1:24:43] as I live here, I suppose I'll always
[1:24:45] remember that gallant little soldier
[1:24:47] rocking on that bed in the iron lung
[1:24:49] between breasts, praising the Lord. He
[1:24:51] was an example to for me of his
[1:24:53] patience, never to complain, but the
[1:24:55] will of God be done. Thou h thou hast
[1:24:58] placed him before us, and now thou has
[1:25:00] taken him uh out of our presence."
[1:25:04] There's just a I mean, that's amazing.
[1:25:07] Yeah. How do we lay aside the weights
[1:25:09] that that the scripture said? You you
[1:25:12] follow that back and it it goes right
[1:25:15] back to casting all our cares upon him.
[1:25:17] Amen. Because he cares for you.
[1:25:21] Amen. At the end of the
[1:25:23] trials, you know, when when when God
[1:25:25] gives God gives that I'm the Lord that
[1:25:29] heals all your diseases. You can play
[1:25:32] something soft, brother. Go ahead. I'm
[1:25:34] the Lord that heals all your diseases.
[1:25:37] Right after that, they were they were in
[1:25:39] a trial. They came to bitter water.
[1:25:42] God provided, but they came to bitter
[1:25:44] water. They're three days out of the
[1:25:46] wilderness, murmuring, complaining,
[1:25:48] "This water's bitter. We got nothing to
[1:25:50] drink. We got nothing to eat." God says,
[1:25:53] "None of the plagues will come on you. I
[1:25:54] am the God that heals all your
[1:25:56] diseases." And then it says that they
[1:25:58] they threw the the tree. They threw a
[1:26:01] tree. They threw a cross into the bitter
[1:26:04] waters of life and they became sweet
[1:26:06] waters. Only God can do that. Amen. But
[1:26:10] they threw that in. And then the
[1:26:11] scripture says, "And they dwelt there,
[1:26:14] and there were 12 deep wells, many other
[1:26:18] places to drink from, and palm trees."
[1:26:21] So after this trial of bitter water,
[1:26:24] Yeah.
[1:26:26] God gave them shade from the trial.
[1:26:31] God turned what was bitter water into
[1:26:33] sweet.
[1:26:35] It may take it may take a long
[1:26:37] time. But if if and
[1:26:41] listen, I know I know it's hard. I know
[1:26:45] it's hard to endure. I know when we go
[1:26:47] through hard things that we don't
[1:26:49] understand that it it gets really
[1:26:52] difficult to hold on. It gets difficult
[1:26:55] to keep your eyes on the word of
[1:26:58] God. Sometimes God forbid it, but
[1:27:01] sometimes we can get angry at God
[1:27:03] because we know that God God h you have
[1:27:06] the power, but why did you let this go?
[1:27:08] Well, it could be a situation like this
[1:27:10] boy. If God would if he would have had
[1:27:13] health, he he might have been out there.
[1:27:16] He might have died in a car accident as
[1:27:18] a drunk,
[1:27:19] but God took him and put him in this
[1:27:23] position. And what a testimony he was.
[1:27:25] And at the end of his life, he said, "I
[1:27:27] wouldn't trade this for nothing."
[1:27:30] Why? Because he knew God.
[1:27:33] Because he knew God.
[1:27:36] So hard to find an end tonight. But if
[1:27:39] you just bow your hearts with me,
[1:27:41] we'll just we'll pray and then I'll turn
[1:27:43] it over to these brothers. But
[1:27:45] Hallelujah. I just I just wonder if
[1:27:48] you're weary tonight, if you're going
[1:27:50] through trial, if you're weary, if you
[1:27:52] just want to make lift your hand to the
[1:27:55] Lord. Amen. Hands up everywhere. My
[1:27:58] hands up, too. We all go through things
[1:28:01] and we get weary.
[1:28:04] Father, I pray Lord that tonight that
[1:28:07] this this group of your
[1:28:10] bride would just be able to come under
[1:28:13] those those trees in the shade away from
[1:28:16] the trial for a minute, drink the cool
[1:28:19] water, the cool sweet water that you
[1:28:21] provide in your word. And Lord, the
[1:28:24] trial might not go away when they leave
[1:28:26] here. It might meet them as soon as they
[1:28:28] walk out the door.
[1:28:31] But Lord, I pray for
[1:28:33] strength and I pray for
[1:28:36] understanding. I pray for balance. Lord,
[1:28:39] that's my heart is just
[1:28:41] balance. Somebody might accuse me of
[1:28:44] preaching the days of miracles has
[1:28:45] passed, but I I know my
[1:28:47] heart. I know you do miracles. We've
[1:28:50] seen them. Sister Sharon's just a recent
[1:28:53] example. There's probably other examples
[1:28:55] in this church recently, but but Lord,
[1:28:58] Sister Sharon had to go through that in
[1:29:00] order for there to be a
[1:29:02] testimony. And we know that you don't
[1:29:04] just throw us
[1:29:06] into into sickness. That's you don't
[1:29:09] bring sickness on us. That's that's
[1:29:11] Satan that does that. That's Satan that
[1:29:14] would bring sickness on us that makes
[1:29:16] that would maybe take take a loved
[1:29:18] one. But Lord, yet you you use it for
[1:29:21] your glory. and that sickness that took
[1:29:24] our loved one was just a vehicle to get
[1:29:26] them from this life over into your
[1:29:28] presence. And now if we could talk to
[1:29:30] them, they'd say, "Don't don't call me
[1:29:32] back. Don't grieve for me. I'm in a much
[1:29:36] better place."
[1:29:38] And so God, I just ask that you would
[1:29:40] bless this congregation there. There's
[1:29:42] no doubt in my mind that there are long,
[1:29:45] hard trials. The people testified of it
[1:29:47] with their uplifted hands. But I pray
[1:29:50] that those same uplifted hands would
[1:29:52] lift up just now and worship you. The
[1:29:56] God, the creator of the
[1:29:58] universe who even though these trials
[1:30:01] are going on, even though Job was called
[1:30:03] into a hard trial, yet you stood
[1:30:06] watching the entire time and Satan had
[1:30:10] boundaries. You gave Satan boundaries
[1:30:11] and you made sure that he didn't cross
[1:30:13] them.
[1:30:15] So even though sometimes we can't feel
[1:30:17] you, maybe you're standing behind us in
[1:30:19] the fire keeping the heat off of us. We
[1:30:24] don't feel you. We don't see
[1:30:26] you. But Lord, I just pray that tonight.
[1:30:29] Let let your people feel you. Let your
[1:30:32] people see you through the through the
[1:30:34] word, through one
[1:30:36] another. Lord, this has been a a real
[1:30:38] good group to preach to. They they've
[1:30:40] they've really pulled tonight and
[1:30:44] So Lord, I just I just pray God that I
[1:30:46] wouldn't have got in the way at any
[1:30:48] time, but that they would see
[1:30:51] Jesus, that they would see you in a more
[1:30:54] clear
[1:30:54] light, and that they would just fall
[1:30:57] more in love with you. Even in the
[1:30:59] hardships of life, they'd see that if we
[1:31:02] just cast our cares upon you, you said
[1:31:05] you'd care for that need in ourstead. We
[1:31:08] don't have to care about it because you
[1:31:10] care. Bless your people now. They're
[1:31:12] wonderful people. Just bless them, I
[1:31:14] pray. Bless the pastor as he ministers
[1:31:17] away. Keep the
[1:31:19] flock. Protect them. In Jesus name we
[1:31:24] pray. Amen.
[1:31:27] Amen. God bless you tonight.

[1:51:48] Amen. Sing through the fire. Through the
[1:51:54] [Music]
[1:51:58] fire. So many times I've
[1:52:02] questioned certain
[1:52:05] circumstances and things I could not
[1:52:09] understand.
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:14] So many times and trials. Oh, my
[1:52:19] weakness, my vision. And that's when my
[1:52:23] frustration gets so out of
[1:52:28] hand. Oh, but it's I am
[1:52:33] reminded I've never been
[1:52:36] forsaken. Oh, I've never had to stand on
[1:52:41] one test so
[1:52:44] long. That's when I look back at all my
[1:52:49] victories. The spirit rises up in me and
[1:52:53] it's through the fire. My weakness is
[1:52:57] made sure.
[1:53:01] Oh, for he never promised that your
[1:53:05] cross would not get
[1:53:08] heavy and your heel would not be hard to
[1:53:16] love. Oh, he never offered. Oh,
[1:53:21] victories without a fighting. But he
[1:53:24] said would always come on time.
[1:53:31] Oh, so just remember where you're
[1:53:35] standing in your valley of decision and
[1:53:40] the
[1:53:41] adversary says give on him but just hold
[1:53:49] on. Our Lord will show
[1:53:53] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:53:59] again. So many
[1:54:01] times, oh, so many times I
[1:54:05] question the certain
[1:54:10] circumstances, things that I could not
[1:54:13] understand.
[1:54:18] So many times and
[1:54:20] trials my weakness blurs my vision.
[1:54:25] That's when my frustration gets so out
[1:54:30] [Applause]
[1:54:31] of but
[1:54:34] it's
[1:54:36] my I've never been
[1:54:40] forsaken. Oh, I never had the
[1:54:45] sense
[1:54:47] alone. That's when I look back at all my
[1:54:52] victories. The spirit rises up in me.
[1:54:56] And it's through the fire. My weakness
[1:54:59] is made strong.
[1:55:04] Oh, he never promised that my cross
[1:55:09] would not get
[1:55:11] heavy that he would not be hard
[1:55:19] to Oh, he never
[1:55:22] offered my victories without a fight,
[1:55:26] but he
[1:55:27] set
[1:55:31] always for
[1:55:34] So just remember where you're
[1:55:37] standing and your body of decision and
[1:55:42] the adversary says give on him but just
[1:55:49] hold
[1:55:51] on. I know my Lord's going to show
[1:55:55] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:56:01] again.
[1:56:02] [Music]
[1:56:05] Oh, I know within myself that I will
[1:56:10] surely
[1:56:11] perish. But if I trust the mighty hand
[1:56:15] of God, he will shield the flames
[1:56:20] again. Yes, he will again.
[1:56:24] at
[1:56:26] all. He never promised that my cross
[1:56:30] would not get heavy and my he would not
[1:56:35] be
[1:56:37] hard. Won't be hard to climb. No, no,
[1:56:41] no. He'd never offer my victories
[1:56:46] without fighting. But he said help would
[1:56:50] always come on time.
[1:56:55] So just remember where you're
[1:56:59] standing in your body of decision and
[1:57:03] your
[1:57:05] adversary
[1:57:07] says give you on him just hold on cuz I
[1:57:13] know my Lord's going to show
[1:57:16] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:57:23] again. So just hold
[1:57:28] on. My old show
[1:57:32] up and he will take you through the fire
[1:57:37] again.
[1:57:38] [Music]
