to me on the text thread get it to me it's bwt Pastor gmail.com don't worry I don't have no filter on it so it isn't no filter of stopping this question uh if you got a question brother George is Brother George is here and uh what it is is that I want to be able brother George had asked me if I can get them together so that they're able to be read he's able to read them easily when they're here so um if you have something comes to your heart maybe it comes to your heart this morning try to email me or if you textt me or something just so I can get it down so brother George can have a chance to look at it before the evening service and um I'm just want to say thankful to have brother George here with us and I'm grateful before I mention that it's it's so good to have um brother Constantine brother Alexus sister Judith and brother Vivan so glad to have their mother here amen welcome home amen so good to have her here with us amen it's so glad that God made a way so we just appreciate brother George his stand for the word of the Lord and just such a you know balance it's one of those things you always see brother George put that here but there's a real I appreciate his real balance with being able to uh everything that you know is around he's seen there's been a lot that he's seen you know over the years and I think not only about brother George I think you know when we had brother Homer here there's a lot of veterans that's seen a lot of things over time but you know it just goes to show that no matter how time changes when that Revelation is solid upon our heart it that's the anchor that holds us time itself time doesn't change anything it only further manifests what's all what's already there and so we just appreciate that and want to pull on the gift of God this morning and um you know for those of you that don't know it and and I I just say it in this way uh you know brother brother George this is Brother bram's son-in-law and um he's just a he's just a man just like the rest of us but I thank God for some of the insights to me I've just I've appreciated not only from Brother George but different ones that I've been able to come in contact with through uh Jeffersonville there with brother Nathan Bryant and different ones and there's certain angles on things with stories from Arizona and things like that that I've just really come to really appreciate and so we just want to pull on the gift of God this morning I believe God has something for us he hasn't brought us together just to be seen amen sister Rochelle good to see you God bless you my goodness it's almost like it's almost like Naomi 2.0 right there hey that's a good thing that's a good thing no don't don't let anybody tell you different that's a good thing amen but we

matter what tomorrow brings what it has it St I will praise the Lord amen those aren't just words to song that's your confession amen no matter what happens today what happens tomorrow we will praise the Lord amen don't forget it all these songs we sang that's our confession amen while we're standing let's open our Bible to John chapter 8 it's good to be back with you and seems like I always come when there's some snow or something but I'll try to get back when there's green leaves too it's good to see all of you so we're going to look at a couple of scriptures here and uh I've got the King James version which is what you have and I've got another Bible uhhuh called the lza Bible probably never heard of it but if you've listened to William Brandon very long he talks about this man and it's a a little bit different translation but it's very good so John chapter 8 verse 31 as you look at your Bible then Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him so we got it narrowed down to the ones that believe in him it's wasn't for everybody if you abide in my word you are truly my disciples and you will know the truth and the Very truth will make you free so you have a choice you can follow and know the truth or you can stay over here in bondage and go down down to the hot place got choice we're not playing games today the truth the other place we're going to read is over in Galatians chapter 1 this is a key verse for the day that we're living in because we got a lot of foolishness going on and um Galatians chapter 1 Paul had been through this area preached to these people baptized these people he comes back back a few months later and some other believers had come through no you got to do it this way you know we' got this good idea and blah blah blah and Paul says in verse 6 I'm surprised how soon you have turned to another gospel away from Christ who has called you by his grace a gospel which does not even exist it's a zero how be it there are men who have stirred you up and want to pervert the gospel of Christ but though we other words me Silas Samuel William brandham anybody or even an angel comes down from heaven and preaches another gospel than that which I've already preached to you by Revelation let him be ACC cursed and go to the hot place quickly yeah we're not playing games and if you weren't paying attention the first time as I said before so I say now again if any man preaches another gospel to you you than that which you've already received let him be a cursed Heavenly Father we thank you for your word today we thank you Lord that you've called us all together here to this lovely place and Lord we don't take it for granted we realize this is a holy place to stand before your people we pray that you would anoint your word and make it real to each person we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated now I'm here for for two reasons maybe three One Pastor invited me and I appreciate it I don't even get invited everybody but I get invited at certain places and come back and I don't think I've told you this before but I got a friend who God deals in dreams and he dreamed that he was in um in brother Brandon's living room like a fly on the wall watching things you know and so he said in this living room there was uh two chairs and there was sister brandom and brother Neville and then me and Rebecca was sitting here by the fireplace so that's that's the scene and so um he said that uh the adults were talking about current things but then brother neble got up to leave okay he left March of 1974 and then sister brandham got up to see him to the door and the Lord called her in May of 81 and so they're by the door and they called hey Rebecca come here so she comes over and she left in November 06 they looked back at me and they said you keep doing what you're doing and that's why I'm still here been gone about over two weeks from my house and zero weather 5 Ines of snow but I'm doing what God called me to do so that's where we're here today and today we're going to begin a series that might take a long time we're going to get into the book of Acts book of Acts is foundational teaching the book of Acts is the only book in the Bible That's not finished because you're living the extension of the book of Acts there you go and so the writer is Luke now most people are under the you know idea that um Paul wrote most of the New Testament well that's probably true he was he was the preacher there was somebody else helping him okay brother Ram did the preaching he had other people helping him so the writer is Luke he was the Beloved pH physician he was a doctor high level Greek Citizen and uh he accompanied Paul on missionary Journeys did a lot of the writing throughout the New Testament okay now don't let this go over your head it's very simple but you need to know your Bible because those people in the church down the street they're reading their Bible too you got to know why you have long hair you got to know how why you're wearing a long dress why we follow the message of the hour it's important because the world is falling apart and the resurrection is imminent and are you ready or you just following along like okay this is what we do you got to know why when brother random was caught beyond the curtain of time and there's no other person that I ever heard of that went over there and came back and told us what it was like we have the word of the Lord amen and the all the great things he said but the vital part was and you will be judged for what you said the angel appears to Samuel today and tells him that he's going to start biting string Nails just like I would oh what about well I want to erase a few things we're humans but brother Ram didn't even Flinch he said what about Paul he will be judged by what he said too well if Paul's people get in my people get in because I preach what Paul preached so it's very important to go back and see what Paul preached it's right there in Galatians 1 so we stick with what Jesus said what Paul said what William brandom said the rest of it forget it okay so we are a vital part of God's plan he's got us here for reason yes and no one is going without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you will be left behind because the day after the Rapture this church will be full of people oh we want to get in too late too late so you got to got it fixed now so we got to have the Holy Ghost Divine love reflecting in our daily life that's why we come to church see what's missing and that's why we want to see if we're level just right that's got a secondary you know purpose you'll find out a little bit later so Luke became a disciple he was not an apostle okay a disciple is a follower now if you don't take notes I'm sure they're recording it you'll find out later but uh while Jesus was on Earth he had 12 disciples an apostle is one that's sent out it's a missionary okay Luke accompanied Paul the great missionary and the original disciples were mostly fishermen uh many could not even sign their name one was a tax collector one of the worst jobs there was uh one was a revolutionary and um there were 11 disciples and they became Apostles okay and so these were ordinary men that God used in extraordinary ways to spread the gospel just like you now some of you came out of the Catholic Church some of your relatives are still over there in the Catholic Church you had a man by the name of Francis of AIS he was a real man 900 years ago and William brandham said he was a preacher of the Gospel so we'll just leave it at that he preached what he knew and he said preach always use words when necessary well how do you do that you just show up as a Christian you don't have to preach words your life is what preaches so these people they were Ordinary People they were ued with the Holy Ghost and there was God's choice it all worked out because you know we look at it man is that the best you could find that's what God ordained why God ordained all of you why didn't you get some people in here really know what they were talking about no God ordained us to be here amen thank you Lord and He trusted you with the secrets of the Gospel okay so let's see if we can get through a little bit of this today uh is anybody in a hurry to go no no sir free free parking right okay not a problem so God's still in business he's still changing lives just like he did back there okay and the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts are two-part two volume set because he he wrote the the Gospel of Luke and then he wrote the book of Acts and in verse one of chapter uh one here of Acts he's uh writing to his friend in um in another place he says the former treaties which is the Book of Luke I have made o Theophilus of all that Jesus began to both do and teach until the day which he was taken up after through the Holy Ghost had been given Commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs seeing being seen of them 40 days in in speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom now this is the only mention in all scripture of the time frame between the resurrection and the Ascension okay very similar to this age brother Brandon was right over here in Green Lake Wisconsin 1962 and he said can't you see we're at the end time it's all over the next thing will be a sweep and get that little group together in a month or so see says 40 days a month or so same thing she'll be gone as soon as she's gathered together we're at the end there are no hopes left anywhere run to Christ people in another place he says we're not getting people to Christ we've got people to a teaching okay William sent you know William brand was God's Prophet God sent him we believe right what about the foundation what about getting people to Christ what about the Born Again experience you're not going without it right all this knowledge is not going to do you any good we got people fighting up our quotes oh he said here's forget it you got to get the foundation right there you go we don't know what he said in those 40 days he just says here speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God so today don't waste your energy uhhuh out in the desert of speculation leave it alone God will reveal according to your need will yes sir now brother Samuel rais these three boys did a pretty good job so far yeah there's hope but when they were 5 years old they they wanted the keys to the car it'll be revealed as you needed it not not one day before so God's going to reveal what you need as you need it and if you don't do the job today you might not get to that place so we got people figuring all this out look Heaven is only for those that get there there's no need to go figuring it out it's going to be this just just live today the job you have is get to the resurrection sir okay verse four we're making progress and being asend assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem but wait for the promise the Father which he saith you have heard of me where do they hear that John 141 15-18 ver 26 and he further expounds for John truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days from now when they therefore were come together they asked of him now here's the disciples they've been with him several years they've slept with him they ate with him they Miracles all this stuff now here's a resurrected being first one they've ever seen it's never happened before they had a political question just like today who cares who's President we're we're leaving this whole thing's going to burn I got news for you America is not going to get great again come on it's not going to happen it the Man simply is adjusting the thermostat temporarily it's all going to burn Prophet already said we're so worried about some of the Visions what about the vision he turned wow it's all smoldering ashes it's coming all this is going to burn okay let's get back to the story here so here they are asking him a question Lord will you at this time restore the kingdom will you now get the Romans off our back and make Israel great again you know no no so After experiencing these infallible proofs having close fellowship with the resurrected being having meals together Lord this is all wonderful but are you now going to get the Romans off our back you know that was their greatest most important question right they were humans just like us they had children they had to whip they had wives they argued with they were just like us they weren't superum William brandham wasn't Divine he was human so over here in the the lamza Bible in verse 7 it says it's not for you to know the time or the times which the father has put in his own authority and other words it's none of your business jump on these people should have known and understood by this time that Rebellion against Rome was not the proper Christian attitude but rather faithfulness to the message of the hour and the lifestyle of the Gospel simply imitating the master that's what they should have been catching you see the prophet says over here in Revelation chapter 4 how we need in Jeffersonville and Cleveland and all these other Villages thousands of lived voices the Thunder of God thundering out in sweetness Holiness Purity undefiled lives walking around the Earth today without a blemish yeah that'd be nice just just lives blossoming out with the gospel he says that is the Thunder against the enemy the devil doesn't care how loud you can holler he doesn't care how high you can jump none of this but What Hurts The Devil is to see that Sanctified holy life consecrated to God say anything to him call him anything and he's just as sweet as he can be moves right on that throws him that's the Thunder that shakes the devil so the devil doesn't care how much you know how much you can quote who your grandpa is none of that what about your lived life that's righten what about just preaching the gospel with your life when the sisters go to Walmart and they have the long hair there's people that oh well they signed their ticket the ones that say God bless you they're going another Direction you you didn't say a word so chapter 1 ver8 but you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and over Samaria now we hear those names every day in the news Israel's still there little bitty country because now today they're living on 17% of the original promise because through Wars and politics they've given it away and they the other people want it all well anyway it's not the story all Judea Samaria and under the uttermost part of the Earth all the way to Ohio the par the gospel didn't come in a parachute didn't come in a jet it came people over here on a horseback and on the rivers bringing the gospel and we are the fruit of all that effort okay so in verse n vanished in a cloud and they went and did what he said now you may thinking well this is pretty shallow we are bride material I hope so I hope all of you go to heaven but the same Prophet said there's three kinds of Believers in every congregation and only you know who you are don't worry about the next guy I can look at you know this one that well you must be no who am I that's right right so we're we're headed to the top of the pyramid okay starting to thin out and we're mature we want to hear the Deep things of God well this is the Deep stuff of God right here this is the foundation this church couldn't go up without a good foundation okay well anyway so be careful how you judge see we're so eager to put a label on people and judge people and um we have an entire library look everything William Bram said is on every cell phone of the planet you want to hear what he said go for it it's all there I'm just here to encourage you to stick with the program see and so um is this is sound okay everybody here okay um we can hear the Mysteries we can hear the doctrines Revelations and um we only want to stay balanced stay balanced right all these nice cars outside they're worthless if you don't balance the tires properly you won't go very far you know children are unbalanced do work out you got to stay balanced okay so you see you got to understand we're in a church full of Christians in progress we got people back here don't even understand English we got kids we got new people we got to have balance and so we're in progress so we got to review from time to time be sure the foundation is secured because you see not everybody had the same good cup of coffee that you had no we're all different you're looking at one person I'm looking at all the colors all the different stuff you know so we're individuals and um the Bible says in 1 John 3:11 this is the message you heard from the beginning that we should love one another that that's the whole basis love one another amen amen and so um we can we can try it in our natural flesh we oh God bless you real nice but you see it's automatic when you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is not optional it's not if you feel like it if all the stars line up if everybody's nice to me no you must you see if you want to be at the meeting in the air you must have the baptism of the Holy Ghost okay so in verse 10 two angels appeared the same Jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so likewise come in like manner as you seen him going to heaven and from there we have a private interpretation of the cloud that appeared in 1963 no that is an appearing this isn't the coming get that straight okay now um 12- 15 of chapter 1 they got together in the upper room Mary was there the mother of the Lord Jesus yeah and um she was there saintly obedient walking in truth of the hour she wasn't the Queen of Heaven the way they told you in the Catholic church and she was his Earthly mother and she was one of many that were there and she was not arrogant she wasn't selfish she wasn't demanding she wasn't in control she was an obedient lamb right yeah 1 Corinthians 15:6 says he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once it's commonly understood that that's the number that could have been on Mount of Olives to see him Ascend but he told him go to The Upper Room well guess what only 24% made it over there where's the rest somebody had to be unbelievers and make Believers 76% you know and so 12 through 20 15 through 25 they discuss the facts of the death of Judas the traitor now all this is in your Bible you got to read it for yourself we're going to jump over a lot of verses but you have to go home and read get in there and read read uh read um Scofield's notes he did a lot of studying oh yes you see scoffield finished his work finished ready to publish January AR 1st 1909 with no computer only pencil and paper and a few helpers and he's got a lot of Truth in there okay so they discussed the death of Judas the traitor they were quoting from Psalm 41 and also from 69 and um the scripture says and no one shall live there where he committed suicide what the Bible says they knew their Bible and to this very day that area where he committed suicide nobody lives there because the Bible is right when Jesus was here he he went to Village to Village praying and preaching the gospel but three villages did not believe corim Bida and capernium and to this day it's a pile of rocks nothing is there there's a few people in capernium because the Catholic Church bought the land and they got a chapel there but nobody lives here so the rest of the chapter has to do with the one you know replacement of um that they chose for replace Judas but see they were humans like us they had problems they had situations they were just like brother brandom and just like the song we just sang the more you yield the more God can use you but if you got to have your way well God's got better things to do you know so God's still in business just like the book of Acts he Hebrews 138 is still in effect so let's get into the good part here in Chapter 2 in Chapter 2 and verse one and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord one place verse two and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as fire and sat upon each one and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues and the spirit gave them utterance now this is day 10 they didn't know how many days he didn't say go up there for 10 days go up there god'll take care of it so they're up there in the upper room hiding from the from the angry Jews down here they don't know how many days 120 up there but they're in one Accord they're in agreement seeking for the Fulfillment of verse 8 of chapter 1 the noise came got the tongues of fire but you see the Church of Jesus Christ was at that point launched in Jerusalem that was the alpha Church we are over here in the Omega through seven ages and 2,000 years we've been restored back to the original through a prophetic message straight from God according to the prophecy of Malachi 4 you got to read your Bible am I preaching to people that know their Bible so in verse 5 it says they were there from every nation what's that all about because in the scripture in Leviticus 23 and also in Exodus 23 God ordained Seven Feast occasions throughout the calendar year okay for his people in three of those occasions all the male Believers were to go to Jerusalem so they saved up for this occasion they would all go they had have place to stay they had have place to eat so during the Feast of Pentecost which was the Feast at that time all these men were in ch were in town it's a big deal now back then Jerusalem was a walled City okay because they didn't have Air Force if you're going to you know hurt somebody you got to walk got to come through a gate so they walled the city and so then um it's got eight Gates one gate is closed we'll get to that later but anyway all these people all these extra people are in Jerusalem only in 1885 they started Living outside the city and so they're all there for this Feast of the Jewish religion and they were at least bilingual maybe three because they spoke Hebrew that was the that was the the language of the scriptures of the church the temple but they came from at least 16 other countries where they had been dispersed so they spoke that language where they were born so they're there for these six days 100 20 were up here for 10 days and that overlapped so when they come spilling out of the upper room like drunk man speaking a language that these people understood in 16 languages and um they're speaking it with a with a Galilean accent you know when the Canadians come down here it's another accent so all this is working together so they're coming out because when Jesus spoke these words over here in 18 be my Witnesses way far away they had no clue they didn't know the Earth was round Marco Polo hadn't come along their their world was very small they knew Spain was over here in Rome and but they're the end of the Earth but now we got all these 16 Nations here they're coming out of the upper room and um so when when they see that these people are speaking aren't these guys From Galilee they're unlearned they don't have a you don't barely can pronounce and it could have been more than 16 languages and um so while Peter had their attention he's speaking to people he's speaking to the crowd without a microphone that's one of my questions how did you do that we got 100 people here and we got to have a microphone yeah thousands right you know and so verse 14 of chapter 2 he begins his sermon where he says here um standing up with the 11 lifted up his voice uhhuh and said to them ye men of Judea and all that dwell in Jerusalem be known unto you this day and hearken to my words and so he could have spoke for 30 minutes we don't know but he ends over here in verse 36 therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom you guys crucified both the Lord and Christ okay and so he was led entirely by the Holy Spirit to say what he said he he didn't beat them into submission the way they would do at one of our churches today he simply was faithful to the truth he didn't call for immediate response but in 37 now when they heard this this 30 minute sermon they were they were pricked in their heart something's going on and they said to Peter and the rest the apostles uh What About Us in other words we believe what you said but where are we at in this picture what what can we do and he said well first thing you do is repent and be baptized every one even in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a promise for this promis is unto you and unto your children and all they far off all the way to Ohio and Indiana as many as the Lord Our God shall call by pray this to it's not for everybody all Ohio isn't going to believe this message no it's for a select few that will sit still and pay attention and let God do something in their heart with many other words you did testify and exort saying save yourselves from this generation okay so this doesn't just for the new people this doesn't in any way subtract or contradict the commission of a few days earlier when Jesus said and baptize them in the name name of the father son Holy Ghost the people in Rome make a big deal out of that and you guys remember they're saying it over there right now but in the name what's the name now there's been people baptized correctly throughout all history okay William Ram didn't invent acts 238 it's already there but he brought our attention back to the truth okay so it's simply the Fulfillment or the manifestation of the spoken word so this small yielded band of Believers 120 in one one gospel meeting grew to over 3,000 God was in charge it's a simple formula Ministry speaks truth God does the work we can only speak it we can't beat it into your head right amen we can only speak it Billy Graham said I have found that the gospel when the Gospel of Jesus Christ is presented with authority quoting from the very word of God he then takes that message and drives us supernaturally into the human heart it's Act of God that you believe that you even have the interest to be here today that's right yes sir come on now if you're here looking for a wife well that's your problem but you're here because God sent you right brother brandom says preaching is God's program how we going to get away from that that's good now don't come around to me and say well got to say what he said you're on I've been listening for 59 years too you know come on now so we might not be gifted like some of these people like Peter and these guys you know but your life is preaching every waking moment wherever you are wherever you go your life is showing something yes you see okay so in 42- 45 of chapter 2 there was Unity of purpose um and fellowship it was God's program for that time some have tried it today God's Prophet told them it won't work okay so they went to church every day oh you thought you had it tough coming here for a couple hours no every day they had Church they met together daily in their homes they had Holy Ghost Fellowship they ate together they remembered the Lord they were actually having communion every day in 47 and the Lord added to the church daily God is in charge okay brother Ram says I'm just a public servant of God to you the preacher is a public servant like the garbage collector like the policeman public servant so the news that we got for you today we are not the managers of God's bride that's right that's right now we have people around us with the same spoken word books with the same King James version they want to be in control that's not God's program that's organized religion we came out of that you had that in the Catholic Church very good no we're over here amen so we're not the manager of God's people and we're only following the New Testament examples okay we're going to jump over to chapter five and see if we can get through a few more chapters here because it's very important so in chapter 5 um we have a situation they had all things in common and this is the model in the idea advocated by communism and socialism they're not way out there they're coming out of the scripture see but it's never been achieved and these early Believers were not setting up an economic system they were simply responding to each other with gracious Christian Compassion that's right demonstrating and living out the love of God not only in words right okay so everything seemed to be running smoothly up through the end of chapter 4 but unfortunately all the Believers not all believers in the New Testament uh share the same Godly concern so chapter 5 and verse one but a certain man named ananas now you notice nobody names their little boy ananas I've never heard of anybody no and his lovely wife Safara does anybody call their little girl Safara oh it's got a bad connotation they sold a piece of land and they kept back a part of the land his wife was an agreement and um and they brought the money and put it at the apostles feet but Peter said uh ananas why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land while it was yours you know and so forth and um ananas hearing these words fell down gave up the ghost right and great fear Came Upon the people not that they were afraid they worked up okay and the young man arose wound him up went out and buried him right now and about 3 hours later see your Bible's full of details Luke was a good writer he wasn't making it Up 3 hours later what happened income Safara baling in like nothing happened yeah and Peter says now now tell me hone you um you sold the land for so much yep that's right how is it that you have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which buried your husband they're coming out in the door and they're going to carry your sorry self out of here and she went down now she's flat on the ground and they took her out we got a problem these are make Believers you see and um so anyway they buried her and great fear Came Upon the people it wasn't so much that they didn't turn it all in that that wasn't the main problem right God doesn't need your cash but if you keep back your tithing if you keep back your offering you will suffer that's right that's right but the sin was that they lied they tried to deser deceive the Servants of God and theyby deceived God in chapter 4 you can read it for yourself in 33 and 34 there they brought it all in hey no problem but here's these these unbelievers and on the outside they look good oh yeah they had nice clean clothes yellow tie whatever but on the inside there were cheats yeah so this living in common was a historical event it's not a Doctrine okay nowhere do we find that mandated for believers there's been those that tried to work out such a system and it failed every time due to human greed and lack of Holy Spirit brother random told some dear friends this will not work it didn't fail that day but 10 years later blew up so verse 11 fear Came Upon them they perked up verse 12-6 we have the ministry of Miracles to the hands of the Apostles draw uh you know opposite responses the make Believers and the unbelievers don't mess with those guys leave them alone but the Believers flocked to the me they flocked to the meetings they brought the sick and Afflicted in 5 and 16 here and there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about Jerusalem bringing sick folk and them that were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone there was Deliverance things were happening you see so the first persecution was back in chapter 4 and the disciples spent a night in jail they were warned now from now on do not speak in that name you go back and read it par paralyzed man man was born wrong he was he was healed and um but throughout the whole book The the what people couldn't put up with that name that's been that's been the problem all through these 2,000 years yeah don't use that name the Catholic Church didn't want people to get in and read the Bible it was a sin to have a Bible years ago oh we'll tell you what it means and we got the same organized religion today we'll tell you what state did here we'll tell you what wait a minute that sounds familiar you know so we got to be careful okay so they let him go and um and so when they uh when they went to their place see in verse 17 I'm sorry I got to get ahead of myself here a little bit but they warned him don't don't speak in that name so after all this Deliverance is going on all these people are being healed there's you know glory in the camp then the high priest the man that knew the scriptures the man that had it all figured out and those that are with him so he had this Entourage you know Sadducees they were filled with indignation people are being healed people are being delivered lives are being changed and they're upset because it didn't come through their little Channel see they laid their hands on that means they grabbed them and put them in prison verse 19 but the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out huh and says go to the temple and speak to the people the words of this life go preach to the people it's okay and um and so this this religious leader Sadducees it's a Jewish denomination they're not all the same over there okay they got they got they're all divided up just like the Baptist just like romit okay sorry and these people they denied Angels they denied Miracles denied Resurrection Supernatural what do you got left you got a few words on page it's all you got left so 18 they go straight to jail 19 angel opens the doors be strong go speak to at the temple preach the message of the hour so they went immediately had a sunrise service and um meanwhile the high high priest all his people got the cabinet together everybody had their donuts and everything's good okay got them all together now they send the guy over to get the prisoners we're going to take care of this business and of course verse 22 right but when the officers came they found nobody in the prison huh came back and told them yeah verse 23 uh you know we found the prison shut safely and the keepers at their po post of Duty but there's no prisoners huh got a problem so now 24 he's really upset how can this happen we got to investigate we got to form a commission you know and in 25 they get the news flash those preachers that you locked up over there last night they're over there teaching the people we got a serious problem so they're arrested nicely and you know they didn't because the officers they didn't want to get stoned the people are paying attention they they love what they're hearing now they're going to take the preachers away real nicely let's go over and have some coffee you know come over here with us because if they did it roughly they get stoned in a minute well the church was growing it was 120 now in 241 it's 3,000 in 247 added to the church daily such as should be saved in chapter 4 and verse4 about 5,000 more that's quite an increase that's all just first few months there you know in 5:14 God's moving powerfully with the apostles things were happening and the religious leaders were taking notice well obviously you know so here they are again verse 28 and there uh did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name see there's the problem we don't care what effects I don't care what you say don't use that name we got the same thing going on today we got people yeah brother Bram said what what how's that fit into the big picture what did Jesus say about all this so we got we got the conflict see don't use that name the same thing yeah don't use that name and behold you filled Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood on us well who did it obviously you well so the inspired response and Peter and the apostles they said well we ought to obey God rather than you guys the god of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you hanged on a tree him hath God exalted with his right hand to be Prince and savior for to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins because he was sent to his own only the house of Israel the beginning see and we Are Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God ha given to those to them who obey him and there's the only place you'll find that in the Bible you obey you'll receive the Holy Ghost right simple okay so their message was very positive it was factual was about God's power God's plan and Peter spoke it with love he didn't slander disrespect the authorities he wasn't Arrogant with the message of Christ and we've seen I've seen a lot of that and if you listen closely to William brandham on no tape anywhere does he appear arrogant or does he blast those who don't see it his way no you see so when people heard this mini sermon let's go over and see what Dr Lon says about this acts 5 and33 as you look at it on the screen there see we find it here real quick 5 and33 it says here and when they heard these words they were enraged and thought to murder the apostles see it's a little more hot sauce on the in chilava there yeah yeah so then Professor Galeo stood up and he asked that the apostles be taken outside we got to talk about this you know he says you guys ought to be careful and he gives a couple of examples of the past in 5 and 36 he gives brings to their attention you know was too long ago we had this guy named theudas boasting that he was really somebody and a number of men now 400 joined themselves yeah we're going to follow this man he was killed and as many as obeyed him were scattered and it came to zero and then there was other one here you know it also was dispersed now I say refrain from the be careful don't touch these guys leave them alone if this is a work of men it'll come to nothing you're wish and your efforts but if it be of God you can't overthrow it you'll be fighting God and so they um they said well okay if we have to they called in the preachers they beat him up a little bit they agreed and verse 40 and called in the apostles they beat them okay and commanded they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let him go see that's the key to the whole book don't speak in that name so anything today that separates your Revelation or your teaching from the name of Jesus Christ it's foolishness it's a waste of time God is not the author of confusion so I don't care how many books they're carrying how many Bible if it's confusion go the other way because you can't change people brother B says we got pennies nickels dimes quarters half dollars and silver dollar each one is working at their maximum capacity that's right okay they're not going to change leave them alone okay so the Antichrist spirit is still alive today and we have ministers today not too far from where you're sitting that are constantly removing the deity out of the name of Jesus Christ they're putting it over here putting it over there and when you do you got a problem okay they're left without power so these people left the courtroom rejoicing that they were encountered worthy to suffer some dishonor on the account of the mighty name of Jesus Christ 5 and 42 and daily in the temple and in every house they cease not to teach and preach Jesus Christ that's why we're in business today we constantly are on the same theme now the pope who's about ready to expire has said Martin Luther that's over no Martin Luther is not over I'm on Luther's side the protest is still on okay yes sir so these people had trials they had relatives just like we have and their ministers preached to you know mixed crowds only in heaven will there not be any make Believers and unbelievers and if you'll notice when you read the book of Acts we don't find anybody repeating the red letter words of Jesus from the the four gospels they were living out their gospel they were it was just automatic living it out and um they weren't repeating the words of the commission of M Matthew 28:19 they moved out into the deep Waters of Revelation and just obeyed what Jesus said so we're going to face persecutions it's not going to be a broken fingernail no it's going to be something serious see and um but there'll be those that will genuinely suffer for the name of Jesus Christ okay let's go into verse chapter 6 nobody's in a hurry you know if you didn't eat breakfast it's not my problem but you see six and seven are um they kind of go together and in verse one of chapter 6 and in those days when the number of the disciples was multiplied okay so all you math geniuses no there's adding and then subtracting but multiplying he gets big right there were murmurings of the grecians against the Hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration so disputes came up because of some of the people some of the widows were not receiving proper attention they needed some balance so there was the native born Jews and there was s the Jews that immigrated from other countries such as uh the ones from Athens and so forth and the widows depended on assistance from the local church and so the apostles had to Institute Church order some practical ideas for current situations real simple so these assistants they said now look we got some problems here you'all need to find seven men out there that have these qualifications in verse three um there got to be seven men of honest report full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom whom we may appoint over this business so their first assignment was social work now you have you have a picnic here once in a while right yeah and and who cleans up the mess pastor's wife right pastor's children well because people don't pick up their mess I mean in John chapter 6 everybody got all the free food they wanted from two little you know was three fishes and two loes but they were sorry just like us they left trash on the floor the apostles had to go clean it up so here's these Apostles these disciples and their first job was Social Work cleaning up after a lunch and so some of them went on to active work in the ministry okay and U in chapter 6 and verse 7 says and the word of the Lord increased and the number of the disciples multiplied there it is again in Jerusalem greatly and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith these priests see everybody couldn't read they didn't have education like we have so the priests could read they'd studi the scriptures and now oh this is the Fulfillment so they were obedient to the faith okay so um in verse 8 and Stephen it's one of the seven that they elected here he's full of faith and power great wonders and miracles amongst the people sounds good uhuh um the people loved him he became the first Christian martyr because every Revival produces twins right twins aren't exactly the same in this case and so most of the people loved Steven God was using him and so forth but there were certain people that arose to dispute they were there to argue and God allows people in the local church that are not just you know obedient Lambs they're there to argue probably not in this church but some others I've been in they're there for the pastor's Perfection so here they are arguing with the man of God and when they couldn't out argue him in verse 10 uh verse 11 then they suborned that means they paid money to these rednecks out here to say we've heard him say Blasphemous words against Moses and against God which was a lie but they would receive money so you know no problem so they paid this money in verse um uh 11 and the 12 and they stirred up the people and and the elders and the scribes and came upon him caught him and brought him to the council H and they set up false Witnesses this man ceases not to speak Blasphemous words against this holy place so there all these lies you know so based on these allegations the religious police grabbed him and they set up their false Witnesses bringing confusing allegations and um and what is a accusation repeating misquotations just just Chang it a little bit you know little pieces of message in wrong order misplaced out of Harmony yeah goes on today they set up false Witnesses verse 14 for we have heard him say this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and change the customs of Moses and all that sat in the council are looking at this one man and saw the face as it had been the face of an Angel well if that's the case why aren't they on their knees yeah all this stuff you said but here's a man looks like an angel well what's going on so then the high priest says to uh brother Stephen uh are these things true so he gives them the microphone aha hope you got a lunch because when you give the preacher a microphone you probably had a few preachers through here like that right not me and so um and so he said men and Brethren fathers hearken and so from there he launches into the deep water and it was God's way of refocusing the attention of the Believers away from Jerusalem now read it carefully because it's all 50 verses and um uh this it's a history lesson he makes four major points verse 2 through 8 the founding of the Hebrew Nation didn't occur in Jerusalem but out in Mesopotamia all about Abraham okay amen they could agree to that 9 through 37 all about the Patriarchs all about Moses The Liberation of God's people didn't C Jerusalem out in other places Egypt the Red Sea the Wilderness yeah that's true in verse 38 the law was not given in Jerusalem but out in the desert and we can all agree to that vers 39-50 all about the idolatry of the Hebrews out in the desert the building of the Temple look at verse 47 of chapter 7 says here but Solomon built him a house how be it the most high dwelleth not in temples made of hands as saith the prophet and he quotes the scriptures and down here in verse 50 hath not my hand made all these things but God doesn't live in a temple and physical building but over here in in the in the lamza Bible in verse 51 he gives them a final blast verse 51 it says here oh you stubborn and insincere in heart and hearing you always resist the Holy Ghost as your father so do you 52 which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted and murdered especially have you slain those who foretold the coming of the righteous one whom you betrayed and murdered you received the law of of disposition of angels and have not kept it so it gets really really serious you know so this view of History by Revelation brought to a real boil the growing conflict between the new religious movement and the city fathers verse 54 chapter 7 when they heard these things they were enraged and nashed their teeth at him we're going to get him but he full of faith and the Holy Spirit looked up to heaven yeah right through the ceiling and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God and he said behold I see the heavens open and the son of man standing at the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears with one Accord and shouted threats against stepen and They seized him they took him out of the city and began to Stone him with big sharp rocks and those that testified against him placed their clothes under the care of a young man called Saul and they swn Steven as he prayed saying Lord Jesus accept my spirit and as he knelt down he cried with a loud voice and said our Lord do not hold this sin against them and when he said this he passed away first Christ Christian martyr that's our brother and if you haven't seen it you need to find the movie called Paul Apostle of Jesus Christ it tells all this In Living Color very important okay we're going to go a little bit farther so here we go in chapter 8 because it's not even lunchtime yet um chapter 8 here we got the first mention of Saul at the end of chapter 7 he witnessed the death of Steven first martyr he was probably too young to participate because he was a Pharisee in training okay but what he saw right there was stamped in his mind he never forgot it he he didn't throw any rocks but he was one of the persecutors what did they hate they hated the manifestation of God's word in present tense it's okay to quote yeah there was an ark and there was David and all these things but don't bring it down to present tense handle that no no God's back there and there's going to be a millennium there's going to be streets of gold what about today where is God today so that's what they hated manifestation of God's word in present tense so fine for the history but no fulfillment of manifestation of the truth just say what he said I get so tired of hearing that you want to say what he said I can bring up some stuff how many of you have any idea uh we know what I mean this is just trivia really but we know that the photograph was taken in Houston Texas in January 1950 right okay the man that examined it was a freelance he didn't actually belong to the FBI but he was freelance his name was George J Lacy does anybody know what color his hair was have you ever heard it's all in it's just like these details in there had red hair so let's say what he said okay but we got to be balanced you see the Pharisees were the religious Elite of Judaism the people that did believe in Resurrection Supernatural but they were very self-righteous you probably haven't seen anybody like that but I have okay they were the only ones that were really right Revelation was the last thing on the mind everything had to be letter perfect today we call them legalists now the Sadducees were the other ones who didn't believe any of this but you see this is the fourth persecution 8 chapter 1 and Saul was consenting unto his death so he was in agreement to Steven's death and at that time there was great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria except the apostles okay and so with this death of stepen chapter 1:8 you shall go it comes into sharper Focus oh that's what it's going to happen yeah they're going to kill us we stay here so they start moving out you see this is several years after chapter 1 and they're all still at Jerusalem and um so it took persecution to move the Lord's people into action so the gospel is leaving Jerusalem it's all part of the larger picture and so Pharisees Saul was one of the main troublemakers instigator bringing persecution to the early church verse three as for Saul he made Havoc of the church entering into every house inhaling men and women committed them to prison the translation is that he was going from house to house if he saw the little sign of the fish on the wall or uh a cross h no M no problem profiling out of here out of here that's what that movie shows too and so um in his own words you know he tells about this in Galatians 1:13 so Havoc means trouble confusion and God is not the author of confusion okay so after the death of judas's scariot the church leaders chose maias he was probably a good believer probably paid TI he's probably a good man but he never did anything now God's choice was not what we would choose brother Brown says if it was up to us Americans we would have never chose Paul forget it God's choosing was a short hook-nosed sarcastic high-tempered Jew who had been killing Christians okay he's the one Dragon converts into court jail death they were people just like us killed for following Jesus and it's happening today in certain places okay they were walking in the light that God provided but later when he was converted God used him in a marvelous way even to be responsible for a large Port portion of the New Testament much later when he was you know preaching the word openly when he was accused falsely this is Saul later see Saul was his Hebrew name Paul would have been his Roman name when he was confessed he said to the authorities this I confess after the way those guys call heresy that's the way I worship god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets they call us Believers we're not just believing you know one part we believe the whole Bible just like it's written okay so these early Believers could have compromised they could have chosen easier path no resistance no criticism you know hold hands with the original with the the leaders but Martin Luther said Christ Alone we're not going to count beads we're not going to worship idols we're not going to burn candles we're going to follow Christ you know and so that's why we're still on the side of Martin Luther so in verse four they took off everywhere preaching the word the apostles state in Jerusalem now they weren't all preachers they were people just like you but as they lived their gospel in these other areas it was showing the way of God you see they weren't preachers just part of the way living out their testimony like Francis said preach always use words when necessary so these were the first missionaries as they traveled far away yeah they went to Lebanon 120 Mi North they sailed all the way to Cyprus 150 Mi they went up to turkey with Antioch 300 miles but in verse 5 of chapter 8 we have uh Philip he's one of the helpers of chapter 6 and um he was in we'll say a tent meeting up in Samaria 50 miles north of Jerusalem he's having a great Revival things are happening many people are healed there great joy and but every every Revival produces twins so there's a man there in town called Simon the Sorcerer he's a magician he worked from the Dark Side very involved in the oult and in verse 9 giving out that he was some great one yeah false advertising you know obsessed with power and selfy importance and the people even said well this man that's a great power of God and he had followers yeah no one seem to criticize him but rather they they uh you know marvel at his importance but God wasn't part of his picture if God's not part of the picture it's a wrong picture see so when but then when the people heard the preaching of the word and the name of Jesus Christ signs and wonders over here at Philip's tent meeting many believed many many were baptized even Simon yeah where we at verse 13 then Simon himself believed also when he was baptized uhuh continued with Philip and wondered beholding the Miracles and signs which were done so he's been baptized and um uh and then when when Philip saw the success of the meeting he calls Peter and John down to lay hands on these people for the Holy Ghost you know so when Mr Simon saw the the result of laying on of hands he offered them money hey maybe I can buy this magic trick yeah verse 19 give me also this power that on whomsoever I Lay My Hands he may receive the Holy Ghost so he's still the same old Simon see the water didn't didn't change him no I can help you guys of course his ministry wouldn't be for free either so he heard the truth he was baptized he wanted to be part of the move of God but he just couldn't detach himself from the old Simon you see so God granted a preacher of the Gospel to shake him into reality Peter said verse 20 thy money perish with thee because thou Hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money you have neither lot nor um part in this ministry your heart isn't right with God repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God perhaps thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee so he asked for prayer we don't know what happened to him after that so right in the midst of this great Revival amongst the Samaritans north of Jerusalem the angel of the Lord appears to to Philip the preacher verse 26 he said arise other words get up go towards the South which would be Southwest uh the road that goes down from Jerusalem into Gaza you ever heard of that yeah every day in the news right now Gaza is hot still there and he didn't explain he just said get up and go see Prophet says God doesn't tell His prophets everything you just got to obey walk by faith okay so he's going down to Gaza he's there all of a sudden now this is called time travel because it's 70 miles away they didn't have SUV like we have he's walking boom he's there okay verse 27 and he arose and went and behold a man of Ethiopia a unic of great Authority Under Candace queen of Ethiopians who had the charge of all her treasure had come to Jerusalem to worship okay that's one simple sentence but let's open it up the fact is that he's an important man he's a Believer he's a black man he's unmarried he's officer of the royal household is's actually The Treasure of the kingdom of Ethiopia now this is the book of acts way back in the time of Solomon the Queen of Sheba came up to worship and she saw she believed and she took that religion back to her people until this day there's been the Hebrew religion in Ethiopia you see and so this man had been up to the temple to worship he's coming back he had a real nice Chariot had a nice horse he's a you know politician and uh he's W he's going along and he's reading out of the spoken word book of Isaiah all of a sudden here's Philip walking alongside the Chariot uhhuh he's not questioning he's just obedient and um so he's walking along hi you understand what you're reading yeah 8:31 and he said how can I except some some man should guide me and he desired Philip to come up and sit with him so now Philip preacher is in the nice Chariot with the black man going along mhm and um and so 32 in the place in the scripture he was reading he was led as a sheep to the slaughter and so forth and 34 uh I pray the who's the prophet speaking himself or someone else aha so now he gives the microphone to Phillip and he starts right there preaching Christ because that's all they knew they didn't know about all the Fulfillment they didn't have you know iPhones and communication like we have but they were true to what they knew that's right and so he's he starts right there and he got as far as water baptism and so the the the unic well man if all this is true there's water if you believe so they stop the Chariot they go down baptizes the man they come out of the water and Philip disappears time travel now he's way over in this other place to another kind of people and then over here he's finally back at cesaria I think it is so all in one day three different kinds of people yeah right there in your Bible we're not making it up well chapter nine will'll be done I know you're about to starve so we got Saul a young fiery Pharisee legalist filled with hatred and murder against the Disciples of our Lord he persecuted the new Believers our brothers and sisters he was totally faithful to what he believed traditions of the fathers and I can show you on taper brother Ram says and we make a tradition of Martin Luther John Wesley and other men huh wonder who those other men could be it's happening while you're sitting here they're making contradition out of the life of William brandom and God is no part of it sorry that's right so he didn't wait around for orders he begged for arrest warrants anyone faintly associated with the way could be arrested brought back to headquarters in Jerusalem and so people took off seeking more you know peaceful surroundings this could have been four years after the resurrection and God allowed these persecutions in order that they would scatter to the end of the Earth okay and um a lot of times you might not understand how God is going to accomplish certain things because they had no idea okay to the end of the Earth how they were like us so we we worry about how God's going to accomplish things but remember the sign says in Psalm 4610 be still I'm God got to figure it out don't need your opinions God is in charge all he wants is your obedience so young Saul um government you know zealous government agent looking for those not complying with with the rules no regard for human rights no problem profiling if you even look like you're part of the way out of here so his journey is interrupted by divine intervention verse three and he tells this story in different pieces throughout the Book of Acts but we're going to put it all together for you today so he gets these arrest warrants to go get these people in Damascus that's 130 miles Northeast of Jerusalem and he's going along he's got some helpers with him it's about noon it's 100° in the Sun but all of a sudden about noon a much brighter light appears and it knocked them all off their horses it was so bright and so um now they're confused The Fearless Commander the Pharisee in charge of the anti-christian campaign is now faced down in the dirt uniforms all dirty and he seems like he's talking to himself we got to see serious problem they all Saw The Light they all fell off their horses and they all heard a sound but only Saul heard the voice in the Hebrew language Saul wh why are you persecuting me now he wasn't persecuting Jesus himself he wasn't there but he persecuting the people that look like him acting like him Lord who are you I am Jesus of Nazareth the one you've been persecuting and immediately he remembered St St that was always there he was totally disarmed helpless blind from the Brilliance and he had to yield completely so if you are one of God's elect CU I don't know who you are Pastor knows better than I do but you know who you are you know if you're following the truth or if you're just here looking for whatever but if you're one of God's elect he will hunt you down he doesn't care who you are what your ideas are he will find you right so he said what what do you want me to do I'm I'm I'm helpless I'm in the dirt arise get yourself on into Jerusalem into Damascus he had a glorious conversion verses 8 and N says here and Saul Rose from the earth chapter 9:8 and his eyes were opened he saw nobody and they let him by the hand brought him to Damascus and he was three days without sight and neither eat or drink now that right there is Supernatural you can't do that no just try it it doesn't work so supernatural's already taken hold get up I have a purpose for you I'll be with you it all comes down to faith in me you know all the traditions of the fathers you know but you got to have faith in Jesus Christ so God had a plan he wasn't disobedient to the heavenly vision he obeyed perfectly he stayed true he didn't compromise verse 9 verse 10 chapter 9: 10 and there was a certain disciple of Damascus named ananas and to him the Lord appeared in the vision ananas yes Lord I'm here and he said now look ananas I need you to get up and go down to the street called straight says right there and find the house of Judas there's one Saul of Tarsus he's in there praying and uh he's already seen in a vision that a man named anah that you is coming in putting his hands on him he might receive his sight an anas kind of like Peter argued now uh we've heard many things about this man what he's done to your Saints in Jerusalem and and he he's here under authority of the chief priest lord said get up and go he's a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel I will show him how great things he must suff suffer for my name's sake very interesting why didn't God pick him up way back here when he was right after the death of Steven no he lets you go lets you go he's watching the whole time God doesn't always solve things the way you want it but he has a time for things you see so uh you know ananas property owner in chapter 5 that's different so he goes to the address and he went his way in verse 17 entered into the house he found the house and puts his hand no no good morning nothing house everything no brother Saul that would be tough this is the man that killed Grandma now I got to put my hands on him brother Saul appeared to you on the on the way down here he sent me did you might receive your sight and immediately he could see and he arose and was baptized right now when he received this and when he had received meat okay they gave him lunch then was all certain days with the disciples at Damascus so all this is playing out see God already saw it's playing out God saw what you're going to do next week God saw all of our situations he knows what day the Rapture is going to be but it's got to play out that certain time and he's looking for faithful disciples he could look God can arrange he can put everything in order before 3:00 he lets it go on and on and he's watching the the reaction of the Believers so these things are not made up they're all part of God's plan and um he knows what he's doing you know yeah so I want you to read the book of Acts for yourself we're not going to read the whole thing for you but come back this evening we got some other important things that we're going to go into and maybe teach you something that you don't know you never know and um we trust that everybody will have a good lunch and remember the things we've taught you we'll leave this here for later but it's got a secondary purpose I told you about if I see anybody this afternoon trying to go to sleep that's good that's good for the [Applause] Samuel brother George and I have this kind of relationship so I know he won't mind but God God God has one of each of us and there's always a a uniqueness and and then God God knows what he's doing and there's all different all different ways manners in which God uses to to get forth his word that's the same thing within each of Our Lives you know I I really one thing I really enjoyed within it here this morning was a state statement brother George had made and said we are a church that's in progress and those are times this is why it's we see it within our families and everything else These are times where we have to revisit things at times have to kind of comb through things a little bit here and there but you know I'm glad God is faithful to that it's not based on what we see I I'd be honest if it wasn't for the Lord we wouldn't know what to do next and that was one of the things that a theme that we saw all the way through the book of Acts and you see all the way through God's not asking for big things a person could take and they will here in a few months there'll be people going through the streets I know they do it in the Philippines and other places they'll take wooden crosses and they'll actually even flag flog their backs their own backs many things that people will do and they do that with the best intentions people do don't do things to be wrong right but the only thing that God has ever asked of us is to believe to obey his word that's that's where there's Authority is when we obey his word or not it isn't that we have to have it all figured out we have to understand it it's just like if you show up at your job tomorrow and the boss asked you to do something you you have a choice whether or not you're going to go ahead and do that you may not understand it you might think it's hey I I think he's wrong but we know better because we we don't want to be on the unemployment line you know we might think it's wrong but we go ahead and go do it you know I don't think this but you know with with the Lord if we just Lord I'm obeying your word because you said it and that's the thing that when brother George opened up here today when the word was preached and God dealing with hearts and lives I just tell you that's what God is that's all he wants out of us is obedience and see obedience it starts in the heart when we look at obedience it starts from the heart it's an act in the heart that actually will show itself outwardly in our lives and I I think there's no greater thing that we could do continually in our lives is Lord let my heart be a place of sacrifice help me Lord give me the grace to sacrifice my own will my own ideas and let the word of God be preeminent let it be first place in my life I tell you what there's Witnesses throughout this building right here this morning this is in continuation the book of Acts and you know lives that we decisions that's had to be made and have been made but look at the results of it look at the peace look at the rest is there anyone here that's sad or upset that you've ever made a decision to serve the Lord I'll tell you this right here I was 19 years old I wish I wish I had continued on when I was a 13-year-old boy and I was laying there at an altar I wish I would have continued on because from that age from 13 to 19 a lot of scars on my life a lot of things that I wish that had not taken place but you [Music] know God is rich in Mercy and if it was nothing nothing more than the Lord maybe to temper me out cuz God does God does things in such a such a way I'll tell you I can stand before you and I know there's others in this building to be able to say there's no situation there's no nothing no sin too great that the blood of Jesus Christ can't take care of any Witnesses on that I remember when God got a when he got a hold of in my life I I didn't think I could do it because I thought back to that time when I was 13 years old and it only lasted so long you know my mind I'm not going to I'm not going to swear I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that and 13 years old you're out there among school I'm not going to do this and all of a sudden school would come back around and you're back in it again but you know what made that you say what made the difference brother Samuel was the blood of Jesus Christ when when you when you repent and that's obedience and you know it takes the takes the spirit of God to lead to that God did the work you know I never had to stop nothing I never did I'm just there's a there's a lot of things I could list out but I don't not going to list them out I didn't have to stop he came amen and a matter of fact he was the one when I was walking into a place down in sanduski working the second shift I was so worried about certain things now it had been weeks later and he came at that time I'm getting ready to come in second shift and and he spoke to me and he said I want you to notice I've changed your language yes amen right and I stopped and I thought when was the last time anything did come out of my mouth that was wrong I couldn't even remember so and understanding this we can you can have it's not about stopping this and stopping this it's just about serving him when he comes in he's the one that takes care of everything he takes care of that habits he takes care of it we could go throughout this building here this morning you know what that is that's what was was preached here this morning I'm looking at men and women brothers and sisters that the blood of Jesus Christ has moved in your life and God is acting out his victory that he paid the price on Calvary and Rose on that Easter morning and ascended back he's acting out his victory in your life daily right now we're sitting right here in lives that have been assembled back after God has touched you from flu and sickness you know what that is he's acting out as victory he's acting out as victory hallelujah sister Amanda with your back he's acting out his victory it's God acting out his victory and sometimes the situations and things that come about in our way we don't we don't want them we don't even we want to get out of them but you know God will take opportunities to act out his victory to just be able to display his victory through a surrendered vessel that is so true yes sir I say Lord just give us the grace to just submit that his victory can be acted out in our lives amen don't you love him this morning amen amen let's just bow our heads here father thank you for your mercies Lord this morning dear God we just are thankful that you have Lord just encouraging us Lord as we look into the word of God many many points that were made that we know to be truth that Lord these these men and women these brothers and sisters they were not super natural people they were Ordinary People such as us Lord but it was a supernatural experience by a supernatural God that brought the supernatural revelation of Calvary and the blood of Jesus Christ and the resurrection into their hearts that they could see that if there was no one else you did it for them Lord they become part beneficiaries of this Risen Lord Jesus Christ they became beneficiaries of this word that had been raised from Death unto life Lord Jesus thank you for your mercy once again Lord I pray father throughout this congregation that's gathered here this is your simple simple desire is Lord that we would obey you giving Lord the very depths of our hearts and our lives to you father I pray Lord may you just have your way Lord search every one of our

and found us yes Lord I pray throughout this building there's Witnesses not only standing here but throughout the building of the saving and cleansing and redeeming power of the blood of the Lamb
