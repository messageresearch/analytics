[33:46] amen amen
[33:50] you're loving tonight amen let's turn in
[33:53] the Book of Numbers chapter 14 and we
[34:01] want to read
[34:03] verse of scripture their beginning verse
[34:06] 11
[34:19] numbers 14 verse 11 and the Lord said
[34:24] unto Moses how long will this people
[34:27] provoke me how long will it be err they
[34:30] believe me for all the signs which I
[34:33] have showed among them I will smite them
[34:37] with the pestilence and disinherit them
[34:40] and will make a V a greater nation and
[34:43] mightier than they and Moses said unto
[34:47] the Lord then the Egyptians shall hear
[34:50] it for thou broughtest up this people
[34:53] and I might from among them and they
[34:56] will tell it to the inhabitants of this
[34:57] land for they have heard that thou Lord
[35:01] art among this people that thou Lord art
[35:04] seen face to face and that thy cloud
[35:07] standeth over them and that thou goest
[35:10] before him by daytime in a pillar of
[35:12] cloud and in a pillar fire by night now
[35:16] if thou shalt kill all this people as
[35:18] one man then the nations which have
[35:22] heard the fame of thee will speak saying
[35:25] because the Lord was not able to bring
[35:28] this people into the land which he sware
[35:31] unto them therefore he hath slain them
[35:34] in the wilderness and now I beseech thee
[35:39] let the power of my Lord be great
[35:44] according as thou has spoken saying the
[35:48] Lord is long-suffering and of great
[35:50] mercy forgiving iniquity and
[35:52] transgression and by no means clearing
[35:55] the guilty visiting the iniquity of the
[35:58] father's upon the children unto the
[36:01] third and fourth generation pardon I
[36:05] beseech the the iniquity of this people
[36:08] according unto the greatness of thy
[36:11] mercy and as thou has forgiven this
[36:14] people from Egypt even until now they
[36:20] god bless the reading of his word bless
[36:23] you as you're being seated
[36:27] I'd like to continue to speak here to
[36:31] you tonight and see if we get finished
[36:34] with this thought of it or not but
[36:37] intercession according to the promise
[36:41] and when we look at how that God has
[36:48] always he's made a promise in his word
[36:50] and you think of how each of the the
[36:54] promises that God has made it all with
[36:59] within it as brother Branham would
[37:01] express it that the Bible itself holds
[37:04] within it one one great goal that God is
[37:09] desiring to achieve and when we look at
[37:13] this and we see how that all of this
[37:16] many of these promises were were in type
[37:19] that would speak of the spiritual
[37:22] journey and when we look at this you
[37:26] know I look at how that God would speak
[37:30] to Israel in this time and here you find
[37:34] Moses sees he's interceding on behalf of
[37:38] of the promise that God has made and I
[37:42] look at this in terms of when we go to
[37:45] the book of Deuteronomy and I'm not
[37:47] going to read from there tonight but you
[37:49] remember in Deuteronomy 9 where we read
[37:51] from last week where Moses rehearses
[37:54] this and recalls this in the very
[37:57] presence of the new generation those who
[38:00] are going to God is going to take them
[38:03] into the land and he finds this
[38:05] necessary to rehearse to them that
[38:08] you're standing here because of the
[38:11] mercy of God you're not standing here
[38:14] because that you are some great people
[38:17] or that you are worthy but you're here
[38:19] tonight because of God's mercy and
[38:21] that's exactly the reason that we're
[38:24] here tonight we're here because of God's
[38:26] mercy if it wasn't for the mercy of the
[38:29] Lord we wouldn't be here if it wasn't
[38:32] for God's mercy that would even move
[38:34] across our pathway and would bring
[38:36] conviction to our hearts and draw
[38:39] to him we wouldn't be here because it
[38:42] never has been man seeking God but God
[38:45] has sought you and I out and so when
[38:48] Moses would let this be known in
[38:50] Deuteronomy 9 that I've prayed for you
[38:52] and I went up and I prayed again and to
[38:55] think about it that Moses continued
[38:58] there time and time again through the
[39:01] scriptures where he would move and pray
[39:04] for the people of Israel according to
[39:07] the promise that God had made and we
[39:10] think of this when you look at this
[39:11] promise here as we read from it tonight
[39:13] the promise was declared already in the
[39:17] mind of God it was already then when it
[39:20] was uttered to Abraham then after a
[39:22] hearing is uttered to Abraham it's
[39:24] revealed personally to Moses his part in
[39:27] it it's vindicated and when God the
[39:30] whole time when God had this in his mind
[39:33] as a great display of redemptive work of
[39:37] his of his mercy in of his love God
[39:40] already knew there would be a mixed
[39:43] multitude he already knew that but that
[39:46] was not what God was focused on was the
[39:49] mixed multitude but you know God already
[39:51] knew that there was gonna be those that
[39:54] would disbelief he knew that there would
[39:57] be those that you know would would not
[39:59] believe but the promise was not made
[40:02] with unbelievers or make believers in
[40:05] mind the promise was made with the
[40:08] believer in mind it was made in with the
[40:11] believers to whom that would be the
[40:13] vessels that God would actually prove
[40:16] the faithfulness of his word that he
[40:20] keeps his promise to think of it of how
[40:23] that even you know Moses would bring
[40:25] this to their attention that this
[40:27] journey that you have been on in the
[40:30] wilderness here when he would speak of
[40:32] it in Deuteronomy 8 that God has brought
[40:35] you through this time to Humble thee to
[40:38] let you know that men shall not live by
[40:40] bread alone but by every word that
[40:42] proceedeth out of the mouth of God he
[40:44] went on to say that this whole time has
[40:47] been to declare what has really been in
[40:49] the heart all along and I just would
[40:52] like this that it wouldn't have mattered
[40:54] with all the circumstances that arose
[40:57] within this whole journey it would not
[41:00] matter how many circumstances would rise
[41:03] it would not matter how many would
[41:05] disbelieve it wouldn't matter one bit
[41:09] when it come to that well the elect who
[41:12] are ordained to take that land and to
[41:15] take that promise there wasn't enough
[41:17] Devils of unbelief there was not enough
[41:20] that could hinder that promise come to
[41:23] from coming to pass me just say it like
[41:26] this God is going to and he is
[41:29] fulfilling his word you see when we look
[41:32] at this of how that Moses himself here
[41:36] he is you remember as we looked at this
[41:38] last week a very important point that
[41:40] Moses when the first discouragement came
[41:44] up when there in Egypt when he slew the
[41:46] Egyptian and there his brethren begin to
[41:49] question him and said you know what what
[41:52] are you going to do are you going to do
[41:53] to us what you did through the Egyptian
[41:55] he ran and he fled he did not have the
[41:58] courage that was needed and let me tell
[42:01] you this right here courage is not about
[42:03] just what we can recite and what we know
[42:06] but it courage to be able to stand on
[42:09] God's Word even when you don't know what
[42:11] comes next and even when everything
[42:13] looks so bleak and even when things are
[42:16] not turning out like you thought they
[42:17] would because when Moses was down in
[42:20] Egypt when he went back after he met God
[42:22] and God had revealed himself and
[42:24] vindicated the promise to him remember
[42:26] when he went down there the people
[42:28] themselves began to look at the
[42:30] situation and remember they were told
[42:32] you're going to have to gather the towel
[42:34] for bricks you're gonna have to and
[42:36] you're gonna have to maintain an exact
[42:38] amount of bricks you're making remember
[42:40] the people at that time I want you to
[42:42] watch this the people at that time rose
[42:44] up and they made complain against Moses
[42:47] and said why in the world did you come
[42:49] back down here look what kind of a
[42:51] trouble that you brought up on our lives
[42:53] but Moses did not run in that time
[42:56] instead what Moses did he went to the
[42:59] Lord God that he had met personally
[43:02] there the one who had made the promise
[43:04] known to him
[43:05] and even though in Moses comes to God
[43:08] and he says Lord he said what you have
[43:10] told me concerning this promise and
[43:12] concerning these people Lord God you
[43:15] said that you would deliver them that's
[43:17] why you sent me down here you see what
[43:20] Moses was looking at it wasn't happening
[43:23] maybe exactly how Moses thought it would
[43:25] happen but it did not deter him from
[43:28] going back to the Lord God and saying
[43:30] Lord you sent me down here you see Moses
[43:33] knew this was not mama that sent him
[43:35] there it was not just something he read
[43:38] he wasn't just there with a quote but he
[43:40] was there with the Lord God and he knew
[43:43] that he had met God and though that
[43:45] things were not happening the way that
[43:47] he thought they should and listen now
[43:49] even when the people themselves rolled
[43:51] up against him and said have you come
[43:53] back down here to make life hard have
[43:56] you come back down here to make it this
[43:58] way look at it if it would have been
[44:00] natural man Moses he would have just
[44:02] fled and run out of there but there was
[44:04] a greater absolute that was moving in
[44:07] his life and that absolute was what God
[44:10] had confirmed to him I have come down
[44:13] I'm sending you that the people
[44:15] themselves might come out of Egypt and
[44:18] be brought into the land of promise no
[44:21] questions you see what God promised he
[44:26] will fulfill it
[44:27] buh-bam tells us like this in the
[44:29] patriarch abraham he said when you have
[44:32] prayed concerning a promise of god he
[44:34] said you may not see one saying
[44:36] regarding that prayer being answered he
[44:39] said but what you don't see is that
[44:41] there's a grain of sand in that mountain
[44:43] that's already being moved and that
[44:45] grain of sand think of it a grain of
[44:48] sand is a testimony that the rest of
[44:51] that mountain is on the way I know
[44:53] tonight I'm preaching to people who feel
[44:55] like that sometimes where you feel like
[44:57] your prayers are not being answered you
[45:00] feel like you're praying and it don't
[45:01] seem like it's getting anywhere but
[45:03] remember in there in that realm and in
[45:06] that land that's unseen the Prophet
[45:08] called it like this he said there is a
[45:09] land called prayer and he said in that
[45:12] land called prayer is where the prayers
[45:14] themselves are gone before the throne of
[45:17] God and how
[45:18] times were the Prophet himself would
[45:20] stand there in the midst of that time
[45:21] and say I see you you were praying
[45:24] beside the bed and this is what you were
[45:26] praying let me tell you something that
[45:27] was more than a man that picked that up
[45:30] that was a living God who heard that
[45:32] prayer and when make it known to that
[45:34] person I heard what you were praying
[45:36] about your prayer itself you might have
[45:39] felt like it didn't touch the throne of
[45:40] God but I want you to know your prayer
[45:43] got through Daniel I want you to know I
[45:45] heard your prayer and those examples are
[45:48] brought to you and I that we can even be
[45:50] right now living in this time and how
[45:53] many times of things that you prayed in
[45:55] your prayer clothes that i prayed in my
[45:57] prayer clothes and had on my heart and
[45:59] the Spirit of God come right across this
[46:01] desk and call those things a house and
[46:04] minister to us just exactly what we have
[46:06] Nita and you know a man doesn't know
[46:09] that but you know that's God letting you
[46:11] know I heard your prayer I know what it
[46:15] is you're desiring I believe I'm
[46:19] preaching to people that still are needy
[46:21] aren't you I don't want the spirit of
[46:23] this a just said I got it all together
[46:25] that's the spirit that defies God that's
[46:28] a spirit that defies a trust and a
[46:32] reliance on him but you know there's a
[46:34] heart of a believer that says lord I
[46:36] need you Lord God I've got needs in my
[46:39] life and even when I feel like I'm on
[46:41] top of the mountain I still needs your
[46:43] Lord because there's a valley that's
[46:45] coming up because it's not the mountain
[46:48] that reduces the fruit it's the valley
[46:50] where the fruit is made known so we
[46:53] stand within this time and to think of
[46:55] how that in the midst of everything when
[46:58] Moses he entered in on behalf of these
[47:00] people and he began to pray that didn't
[47:03] start now this did not start just now it
[47:06] did not start there in the first part of
[47:08] Exodus when they made a golden calf it
[47:10] started even when Moses himself was
[47:13] brought back into contact with God and
[47:16] when it came back into contact with God
[47:18] remember he had lost the vision for the
[47:21] people he had forgot all about
[47:22] deliverance it was something he became
[47:25] occupied with the things that was all
[47:27] around him but once he met God who made
[47:30] the
[47:30] promised there was no way that Moses
[47:32] could get that promise off his heart he
[47:34] could not get it off his mind you will
[47:36] know why because he himself was
[47:38] identified with that promise and that
[47:41] same God who made the promise was now
[47:44] dwelling there and pulsating within the
[47:47] heart of Moses to where Moses had a
[47:49] heart for the promise of God promised to
[47:53] the people of God now once you think of
[47:56] me if somebody would have came and put
[47:57] their finger in your face and said you
[47:59] what in the world are you doing down
[48:01] here you're making things so hard on me
[48:03] look at what you're doing would you have
[48:05] had the Spirit of Christ within you to
[48:07] say you know what I'm gonna pray for you
[48:10] I'm gonna pray that God will help you or
[48:13] would you have just looked at the person
[48:15] and said an old unbeliever old make
[48:18] believer I'll tell you but you know what
[48:19] Moses didn't approach it that way if
[48:21] Moses would approach it that way you
[48:24] wouldn't be reading their Exodus you
[48:26] would not be reading numbers as a matter
[48:28] of fact Moses would not have been God's
[48:30] man for that hour because when God has a
[48:33] man that God would actually call and
[48:36] reserve to himself God will actually
[48:38] project his heart he will project his
[48:41] love his mercy he'll also project within
[48:44] that love and mercy is correction
[48:46] because when you love your children you
[48:48] don't just love them and look at and
[48:50] close your eyes and pretend everything
[48:52] they do is all right but you also
[48:53] correct them but nonetheless they're
[48:56] your children is that right you don't
[48:58] take your children and tear them down
[48:59] when they've done wrong but you look at
[49:02] them and you realize they need help I
[49:04] need to pray for him and I need to
[49:05] minister to what they have need of it
[49:07] maybe it's some Ministry of Correction
[49:09] maybe it's a ministering of mercy at
[49:11] that time but yet the Spirit of God will
[49:13] always give us what is needed in that
[49:15] moment and I look at this here with how
[49:18] that Moses himself has moved in to
[49:20] intercede according to the promise and I
[49:22] want to draw your attention right back
[49:24] here as we looked at it where in verse
[49:27] 17 where Moses asks God he's beseeching
[49:30] him in humility let the power of my Lord
[49:34] be great
[49:34] according his now has spoken saying now
[49:37] here Moses when he rehearses this back
[49:39] to God this is not just Moses rehearsing
[49:43] or
[49:43] citing something but it is something in
[49:46] that moment that the Spirit of Christ
[49:47] within him of what has been revealed
[49:50] remember this is the name of the Lord
[49:52] that's been revealed to Moses and so
[49:54] what Moses is putting back before God is
[49:57] his name his character his person his
[50:00] nature who has been revealed to him and
[50:02] so something that has just taken place
[50:05] here a situation arises and Moses is
[50:08] able to bring it before the throne of
[50:10] God and he says remember according to my
[50:13] word as you have said he's putting God's
[50:15] Word right before him the Lord is
[50:18] long-suffering and of great mercy how
[50:20] many glad for that tonight you're glad
[50:23] for God's long-suffering of his great
[50:24] mercy and forgiving iniquity and
[50:26] transgression you're grateful for that
[50:28] and there's also another part of it and
[50:31] by no means clearing the guilty now
[50:35] probably none of us within us a boy I'm
[50:37] so glad with with that part right there
[50:39] but you see God himself within his word
[50:42] there is the part within it that when
[50:45] you look at this for at this scripture
[50:47] that set right here it is the very
[50:49] nature of God now many times it can only
[50:51] be certain attributes that people will
[50:54] look at take many of for example many of
[50:56] the church's denominational and
[50:57] what-have-you they will only look at a
[50:59] God of grace and the grace that they
[51:02] look at is really what Jude spoke up
[51:04] they've turned the grace of God into
[51:06] lasciviousness because when God's grace
[51:09] is really given forth His grace will
[51:11] actually bring about the necessary
[51:14] conditions in order for God to step in
[51:17] and fulfill his word grace is not
[51:19] letting you and I get by with sin grace
[51:21] is not that at all but grace is even
[51:24] where God's favor would come to you and
[51:26] I and tell us your own and help us to
[51:29] see where we're wrong and to call out
[51:31] sin because within the midst of that
[51:33] time he is also interceding for us
[51:36] according to the promise aren't you glad
[51:38] he is a faithful heavenly father he
[51:41] knows exactly how to move within our
[51:44] lives and how to bring correction when
[51:46] it's time to bring correction now watch
[51:48] how that when Moses himself he brings
[51:51] this unto the Lord and how that Moses
[51:54] goes on and says pardon I
[51:55] seach the the iniquity of this people
[51:58] according unto the greatness of thy
[52:00] mercy and as thou has forgiven this
[52:02] people from Egypt even until now and
[52:05] notice in verse 20 and the Lord said I
[52:08] have pardoned according to thy word now
[52:12] look how this sustained adhere I have
[52:14] pardoned according to thy word
[52:16] but this wasn't Moses word this was
[52:19] God's Word but once God listened just
[52:22] like with everything else when God
[52:24] reveals his word and he makes that were
[52:27] known to the individual it now becomes
[52:30] your word it becomes what God has
[52:33] delivered to you in the book of Genesis
[52:35] chapter 3 where it speaks that the woman
[52:37] I'll give her a seed but the RAM tells
[52:39] us in the message oneness he said when
[52:41] God made that promise he said the woman
[52:44] has no seed he said but when God gave
[52:46] that seed to Mary it now is her seed you
[52:50] see when God has done something for you
[52:52] God moves for you then when you look
[52:55] within this right here this is not words
[52:57] that's been made up by Moses Moses is
[53:00] not altering listen to me now Moses is
[53:03] not altering the program of God he's not
[53:05] altering the plan of God this is
[53:08] perfectly in line with the plan and
[53:11] wisdom and will of God true intercession
[53:14] by the Spirit of God will never go
[53:17] according or not according to the Word
[53:20] of God true intercession will always
[53:23] work according to God's will you with me
[53:27] no matter how much we pray it's always
[53:30] got to be cording to God's will remember
[53:32] Abraham prayed let ishmael live before
[53:35] you that was not God's will God's Will
[53:37] was I'll establish my covenant with
[53:39] Isaac it wouldn't matter Abraham could
[53:41] have took a forty day fifty day 120 365
[53:44] day fast and praying it would not have
[53:47] changed God's mind you see it's always
[53:49] of the Spirit of God will always come
[53:52] according to the Word of God
[53:55] so there is an assent session that's
[53:57] according to the promise so here is
[53:59] Moses he is interceding according to the
[54:02] word that God has previously revealed
[54:05] verse 21 but as true
[54:08] as I live all the earth shall be filled
[54:12] with the glory of the Lord now here is
[54:15] God's promises I mentioned to you last
[54:16] week this promise carries clear over
[54:18] into the future home of the heavenly
[54:20] bridegroom and their earthly bride God
[54:22] is letting it be known that my word will
[54:24] not be defeated what I have spoken it
[54:26] shall perform that word it's going to be
[54:30] fulfilled the earth shall truly as truly
[54:32] as I live I say does he live tonight he
[54:35] ever liveth to make intercession this
[54:38] was not a priest who entered and who
[54:40] dies and then another High Priest comes
[54:42] in this high priests he died once and
[54:45] he's alive tonight he's there on the
[54:47] throne of God he's there to make good on
[54:49] every single promise that God has made
[54:52] you realize he's there even interceding
[54:55] on our behalf tonight to think of it you
[54:57] and I standing here in a steadfastness
[55:00] and faithfulness and even if there's
[55:02] something that's wrong he's standing
[55:04] there to intercede even where you feel
[55:06] like you're lacking strength he's there
[55:07] to intercede you let me tell you
[55:09] something he's just not a hot breeze
[55:11] interceding for all of our faults and
[55:13] our failures and our mistakes let me
[55:15] tell you something he's interceding that
[55:18] that word might come to pass in our life
[55:20] that the word as it strikes our heart we
[55:23] say Lord be it unto me according to my
[55:26] word he's there to intercede on his
[55:28] behalf of his word I'm glad for that
[55:33] tonight you see there's a word of
[55:35] discernment I want you to think of this
[55:38] here for a moment there's a word of
[55:39] discernment you believe God's words a
[55:44] discerner yes God's word it's precise so
[55:49] it's an intercession that's according to
[55:52] the promise it's a Living Word that sent
[55:55] forth to discern and separate and to
[55:57] think of this to be able to look into
[55:59] the midst of the people and see those
[56:01] whom the Lord has chosen do you realize
[56:04] when all of the Maltz and the mixed
[56:06] multitude and even with all that was
[56:07] down in Egypt before the mixed multitude
[56:09] came out you realize that God was able
[56:12] to look down there and then with within
[56:14] all of that right there and able to know
[56:16] who was really the chosen God was able
[56:20] to do that but yet we find how that
[56:22] here the word was given they all walk
[56:24] out as Paul records on first Corinthians
[56:26] chapter 10 all all did this all drink of
[56:29] the water in Iraq all all he goes in
[56:31] through all of that but yet within the
[56:33] midst of it the promise is made with
[56:35] that of the seed in mind now to think of
[56:39] this of how that God would say this in
[56:41] verse 22 notice because all those men
[56:44] which have seen my glory and my miracles
[56:47] which I did in Egypt and in the
[56:48] wilderness you see there was nothing
[56:51] that these men could say and say well
[56:53] you know God did that back in Egypt but
[56:55] he ain't done nothing now no there was
[56:57] no excuse not to believe that God was
[57:00] able to fulfill his word God had brought
[57:03] them through different pathways through
[57:05] different circumstances where it had to
[57:08] be the power of God
[57:10] it had to be miraculous it would be the
[57:12] same God what he did in Egypt would make
[57:15] himself known in the wilderness you know
[57:17] that's a good thing that no matter where
[57:19] it is that God is still God you know God
[57:22] is able to be just as much God in your
[57:25] home he's able to be just as much God in
[57:27] in your life he's able to be just as
[57:30] much God when you're standing there in
[57:31] the workplace as he is right here
[57:33] tonight
[57:33] it's cording to how our faith will
[57:36] either allow him to be or it'll limit
[57:38] him to be I'm telling you to a believer
[57:40] when our hearts are in tune with God God
[57:43] will show up anywhere anytime when
[57:46] there's a believer that is there you
[57:49] believe that I'll tell you I'm grateful
[57:52] for that tonight because it doesn't
[57:54] matter that we're but it matters that
[57:57] Blair we're looking to the Lord now look
[58:00] at this here and have tempted me now
[58:02] these 10 times and have not hearkened to
[58:05] my voice surely what's this they shall
[58:09] not see the land which I swear to their
[58:11] fathers neither shall any of them that
[58:14] provoked me see it but my servant Caleb
[58:18] because he had another spirit in him
[58:20] what's this discernment now what God is
[58:23] looking and the discernment is where the
[58:26] rest of them did not hearken to his
[58:28] voice he's looking at the discernment
[58:31] that they tempted him 10 times but at
[58:34] the same time he's able to look
[58:36] and see within Caleb's life and he
[58:39] identifies Kayla with one of the highest
[58:41] compliments my servant Caleb he hath
[58:45] another spirit in him you see God is
[58:48] looking beyond the flesh this is what an
[58:50] intercessory word does a word of
[58:52] intercession is that what it's able to
[58:55] look to the depth of the heart and of
[58:57] the life aren't you glad tonight for a
[58:58] word that can look right down into the
[59:01] depth in the heart of your life aren't
[59:04] you glad tonight but the Spirit of God
[59:06] can look down into your heart where you
[59:08] yourself is looked at something in it
[59:10] smokes your heart and said Lord how did
[59:12] I fall into this trap or how did this
[59:14] come about
[59:15] Lord forgive me I should have said that
[59:17] like that aren't you glad that he looks
[59:19] upon the heart aren't you glad that he
[59:22] looks on the desire of your heart come
[59:24] on somebody because once the worshiper
[59:27] has once purged he had no more desire
[59:30] for sin no more conscience for sin
[59:32] remember when when sister Bruce was
[59:34] sitting there in the interview she was
[59:37] asking these great questions of the
[59:39] prophet and the Prophet told her he said
[59:41] it's the desire of your heart sister
[59:43] Bruce you see that's what the real
[59:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost this is
[59:47] exactly what the word sets forth it's
[59:49] what the prophet kept bringing us back
[59:50] to if any man love the world or the
[59:53] things of the world the love of God is
[59:55] not even in him but when the love of God
[59:57] is in your heart and for my the love of
[59:59] God you love him you desire him it will
[1:00:03] absolutely smite your heart when there's
[1:00:06] something that's went wrong even when it
[1:00:08] comes to something you've looked at
[1:00:10] wrong maybe believed wrong but the
[1:00:12] Spirit of God on the inside we're
[1:00:14] bringing out you say thank your Lord
[1:00:16] forgive me Lord Jesus why because there
[1:00:19] is one who's able to discern and look to
[1:00:23] the depths of your heart aren't you glad
[1:00:24] I'm glad for a word of intercession
[1:00:27] that's able to look to the depths of our
[1:00:30] lives
[1:00:31] oma because he had another spirit in him
[1:00:34] and have followed me fully Caleb wasn't
[1:00:38] even in the land yet he didn't just go
[1:00:42] over into the land he went over and
[1:00:44] brought back a report but you see what
[1:00:46] God already looked at was he's obeyed me
[1:00:49] fully
[1:00:50] this is where the profit would bring it
[1:00:52] very clear to us that full obedience to
[1:00:55] the word guarantees us the token it's
[1:00:57] not a checklist I did this I did that I
[1:00:59] did that it's God looking into the very
[1:01:01] depth it's not me it's not the Prophet
[1:01:04] it's nobody it's no man that seals you
[1:01:06] and I it is the Holy Ghost himself it is
[1:01:09] that one that is clothed with the
[1:01:11] inkhorn that comes by and brings the
[1:01:13] ceiling upon our life is that right they
[1:01:16] covered in there in the book of ezekiel
[1:01:18] chapter 9 when it would seem like you
[1:01:21] know look in the sanctuary how that even
[1:01:23] that God would even mention there with
[1:01:25] that of that judgment angel passing
[1:01:27] through and he said I want you to begin
[1:01:29] with my house with my sanctuary so
[1:01:32] wasn't God just passing over sin but God
[1:01:35] comes and he deals with sin but you see
[1:01:38] there's those who actually are crying
[1:01:40] inside for the abomination but that's
[1:01:42] data that's on the wickedness that's
[1:01:44] done in the city now what I hope you
[1:01:47] understand this I'm not going to dwell
[1:01:48] on this too much tonight but it wasn't
[1:01:50] that they were crying out to God and
[1:01:51] saying Lord brother so-and-so such a
[1:01:53] sinner Lord I'll tell you Lord God so
[1:01:56] it's on such a world there's such a
[1:01:57] terrible person that was not that we
[1:01:59] made themselves would have been part of
[1:02:01] the smiting but you see there was a part
[1:02:03] within them that within their lives it
[1:02:05] was something about it
[1:02:07] thus wickedness the sin the abomination
[1:02:09] there was something where they were so
[1:02:11] separated from that by the desire of the
[1:02:14] love of God any type in their life right
[1:02:16] there that God could witness these
[1:02:18] people are the ones that are sealed and
[1:02:21] the rest of them go ahead and remove
[1:02:25] serious time in it you see it's a very
[1:02:28] serious thing regarding the sealing of
[1:02:31] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:32] so when we look at this God is able to
[1:02:34] bring the discernment that is needed and
[1:02:37] I want to reiterate this point the Lord
[1:02:40] will not forfeit his word he will not
[1:02:45] God will not walk away from his word
[1:02:48] there's things that God has put on hold
[1:02:52] when he put on hold when Sam took place
[1:02:55] in the garden now watch this now God did
[1:02:59] not look at it and say oh my goodness
[1:03:00] what's going to happen what's going to
[1:03:02] take place but you
[1:03:04] see within what has happened now it
[1:03:06] actually is permitted by God to wear
[1:03:09] that now the attributes of God better
[1:03:12] within God will actually display
[1:03:14] themselves but there actually will be a
[1:03:17] resuming of that seventh day God will
[1:03:20] not forfeit it but how that God is
[1:03:22] working his word working everything
[1:03:25] right along to bring it right back to
[1:03:27] the promise of his word it's the same
[1:03:29] way what God had promised with regarding
[1:03:31] to the house of Israel David sitting on
[1:03:34] the throne even though all the unbelief
[1:03:35] all the sin that had mounted over all
[1:03:38] the idolatry that had come about him but
[1:03:40] remember what God said I've not forgot
[1:03:42] my promise David will set my servant
[1:03:45] David will set upon the throne didn't
[1:03:49] mean they didn't get corrected they got
[1:03:51] corrected didn't mean judgment didn't
[1:03:54] come it did come but nonetheless God's
[1:03:57] not gonna forfeit his word listen to me
[1:04:00] now he will not step over his word
[1:04:02] remember the Prophet as we looked at
[1:04:04] this last week when brother Bram takes
[1:04:06] this regarding Moses and Moses throwing
[1:04:09] himself down in the breech on behalf of
[1:04:12] the people and how that God would look
[1:04:14] there he wasn't looking at a natural man
[1:04:16] but he's seen the love that Moses had
[1:04:19] for those people and what he saw as the
[1:04:21] prophet puts it in another place he saw
[1:04:24] the cross he saw Christ there displayed
[1:04:27] in Moses life
[1:04:28] he saw the heart for those people and so
[1:04:30] when you look within this of how that
[1:04:33] God will not step over his word remember
[1:04:35] Moses in there in Deuteronomy 9 he calls
[1:04:38] God's attention he said remember the
[1:04:41] servants Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he
[1:04:46] says look not to their stubbornness to
[1:04:49] their rebellion you see Moses didn't say
[1:04:52] nothing stubborn they in rebellion he
[1:04:54] acknowledged it they've got stubbornness
[1:04:57] they've got rebellion this is seen right
[1:05:00] here but Lord don't focus on that
[1:05:03] you see if God would have made that his
[1:05:06] focus there would have been no going
[1:05:08] forward but there's got to be someone
[1:05:11] there's got to be something that's able
[1:05:14] to turn their focus of God from the
[1:05:17] Burness and from the rebellion to the
[1:05:19] promise there's nothing that can do that
[1:05:21] but God's own heart within the life of
[1:05:25] Moses there that would actually turn the
[1:05:27] side let me tell you something the very
[1:05:29] spirit of God in you and I tonight when
[1:05:31] you're born of the Spirit of God you
[1:05:33] might make mistakes and you do you might
[1:05:36] have faults and you do y'all have
[1:05:38] failures but let me tell you something
[1:05:40] if it was not for the Holy Ghost on the
[1:05:42] inside that identifies you and I under
[1:05:45] the blood cell every one of us would be
[1:05:48] killed tonight if it wasn't for the
[1:05:50] mercy of God let me tell you when you
[1:05:52] look at it concerning this earth and to
[1:05:55] think of it that even has the Prophet
[1:05:57] himself would stand there and look on
[1:05:59] that little lady in the condition that
[1:06:01] she was in remember in that time that
[1:06:03] woman needed a lot of help she didn't
[1:06:05] need criticism she was already beat down
[1:06:08] but what had to happen was the Spirit of
[1:06:11] the Prophet had to change on the inside
[1:06:13] was he right for standing there as far
[1:06:15] as looking at sin sin is sin sin should
[1:06:19] never be blessed God never blessed us in
[1:06:22] God will always judge sin but the very
[1:06:25] heart and spirit of the Prophet actually
[1:06:27] had to be changed to that of
[1:06:30] intercession and how did God do that by
[1:06:32] showing him that of this earth and the
[1:06:35] blood and the bumper of blood and every
[1:06:37] time that you went to do wrong you would
[1:06:39] have been killed but the bumper of blood
[1:06:41] was still there
[1:06:42] you know he's speaking to his prophet
[1:06:44] and his prophet once he can get his
[1:06:46] spirit right and into the spirit of the
[1:06:49] intercessory then he can actually go and
[1:06:52] minister to the woman in the right way
[1:06:54] with the heart of love see the spirit of
[1:06:57] intercession didn't say forgive me you
[1:06:59] know you know you were dressed so sleazy
[1:07:01] and you know just go ahead God loves you
[1:07:04] know that one the spirit of intercession
[1:07:06] so you see the spirit of intercession
[1:07:08] it's not criticism that's all you want
[1:07:12] that won't allow the Spirit of God to
[1:07:14] move criticism actually what was
[1:07:17] criticism causing it to do bring
[1:07:18] judgment down how can you stand to look
[1:07:21] at this world I've got a little girl I
[1:07:23] what about me and mine she the Prophet
[1:07:26] right now look at that spirit of
[1:07:28] criticism it had already drew his family
[1:07:30] that his family was the only one
[1:07:32] righteous who but the Spirit of God
[1:07:37] showed up faithful to his word aren't
[1:07:40] you glad that he shows up faithful to
[1:07:42] his word when you and I've been in the
[1:07:44] wrong humor we've looked at things wrong
[1:07:46] but the Spirit of God said come here
[1:07:48] let's have a little conference here and
[1:07:49] you know instead of me just flat-out
[1:07:51] telling you you're wrong I'm just gonna
[1:07:53] show you a little something in my word
[1:07:55] I'm gonna show you and what does they do
[1:07:57] God you miss has confidence in his word
[1:08:00] that his word will actually bring
[1:08:02] discernment into the very heart of the
[1:08:05] believer because the word is sharper
[1:08:07] than any two-edged sword it piercing
[1:08:10] dividing asunder the bone from the
[1:08:11] morrow
[1:08:12] it's a discerner of the thoughts and
[1:08:14] intents of the heart that word itself
[1:08:16] will move down there in the depths of
[1:08:18] our life and put it into perspective and
[1:08:20] say lord help me forgive me Lord
[1:08:22] my attitude won right Lord my thought
[1:08:25] about this wasn't right what's he doing
[1:08:27] he's projecting his heart of mercy not
[1:08:30] that it would allow that individuals to
[1:08:32] stay in the condition but it's got to be
[1:08:34] as heart of intercession come for the
[1:08:37] people in order to minister even better
[1:08:40] judgment God will not step over his word
[1:08:45] he won't step over his word and I I want
[1:08:48] to say like this is like a two-fold part
[1:08:50] of that when you see God won't step over
[1:08:52] his word he couldn't step over Moses you
[1:08:55] take me Lord my name out of the book
[1:08:57] don't you block theirs you block mine
[1:08:59] out
[1:09:00] he put himself in the way of God's wrath
[1:09:03] and there's a two-fold meaning I look at
[1:09:06] this where God will not step over his
[1:09:08] word God himself he's not going to cross
[1:09:13] it neither is he going to alter it if
[1:09:16] God has to alter his word then he's not
[1:09:20] able to fulfill what he spoke he's not
[1:09:25] going to step over it he's not all of a
[1:09:27] sudden looking at the conditions and
[1:09:29] saying no mercy look where the people
[1:09:32] are at how do you know what let's just
[1:09:34] forfeit this word let's just abort
[1:09:35] mission but you see what God has
[1:09:38] promised remember body is
[1:09:40] like you and I we are watching the word
[1:09:42] become material in our lives you and I
[1:09:45] have never remember we bypassed off the
[1:09:48] often e we bypassed that and came down
[1:09:50] into this body of time to be tested and
[1:09:52] tempted in here
[1:09:54] are we being formed to the image of the
[1:09:55] word you and I do not know everything as
[1:09:58] far as knowing it's by faith we believe
[1:10:00] in what God has revealed and done with
[1:10:03] in our life and we walk not by side we
[1:10:05] walk by faith and you and I sometimes we
[1:10:08] can not see all of these things but yet
[1:10:11] within it God Himself already sees the
[1:10:13] end from the beginning let me tell you
[1:10:16] something God never brought you and I
[1:10:18] alone because all of a sudden he decided
[1:10:21] to come down and save us that's not the
[1:10:23] predestinated plan of Almighty God but
[1:10:26] God already foresaw us he foreknew us he
[1:10:30] predestinated us our destiny is a sure
[1:10:33] thing
[1:10:34] in Christ now you and I are coming
[1:10:37] there's enough folding it continues to
[1:10:39] be unfolded in our life God's not going
[1:10:44] to alter his word but and what God does
[1:10:48] he provides the needed grace in order
[1:10:52] for the condition to be right to fulfill
[1:10:55] it so that it all comes back then no
[1:10:58] flesh control in his presence Lord you
[1:11:03] know I took your word and I brought
[1:11:06] myself in the condition that's you
[1:11:07] you got glory but it is not all listen
[1:11:11] its grace that is released from God to
[1:11:15] bring about the necessary condition no
[1:11:18] wonder the headstone coming in this hour
[1:11:20] it's crying under the Church of the
[1:11:23] Living God grace grace unto it you
[1:11:26] realize it's a voice the word coming
[1:11:29] with correction the word coming
[1:11:31] interceding on our behalf you recognize
[1:11:33] what it brings about it brings about a
[1:11:35] lady and elect lady it brings about miss
[1:11:38] grace it brings about that lady who
[1:11:41] desiring to line up with the word and
[1:11:44] that her life would be tailored to that
[1:11:46] word that's what grace does if not for
[1:11:48] grace you and I would be swept along
[1:11:50] with the rest of it but
[1:11:52] grace itself has stepped in for you and
[1:11:54] I why did grace step in because that we
[1:11:57] were a good people I don't think so
[1:11:59] grace stepped in because God made a
[1:12:02] promise he made a promise to himself and
[1:12:05] that's exactly what God told Israel in
[1:12:08] Deuteronomy 7 God has not chosen you
[1:12:11] because you were some people you know a
[1:12:14] great people but God chose you because
[1:12:16] he loves you and he swore by an oath to
[1:12:21] your fathers of what he himself was
[1:12:23] going to do you see this bring us pretty
[1:12:27] good straight
[1:12:27] God is obligated to his word hey man
[1:12:31] that's where you and I have to know am I
[1:12:33] in that word and that word in me if you
[1:12:37] abide in me and my word abide in you ask
[1:12:39] what you will and it shall be done oh my
[1:12:43] you see prayer changes things I mean
[1:12:45] just I'm just gonna skip some things
[1:12:47] here prayer really changes things when
[1:12:51] you look at how you know brother Branham
[1:12:53] refer to this over and over you talked
[1:12:55] about Moses you know being pastor Moses
[1:12:58] and he talked about how you know brother
[1:13:01] brand will take that attribute within
[1:13:02] there of how that Moses was able to put
[1:13:04] up with all the fusses of the people was
[1:13:07] able to put up with all of those things
[1:13:09] and the times of them questioning and
[1:13:10] the complaining along the journey and
[1:13:12] you look at how that within it here if
[1:13:15] Moses was able to intercede according to
[1:13:18] promise I hope you understand that we're
[1:13:20] not lifting Moses up we're lifting God
[1:13:22] up because Moses himself the Scriptures
[1:13:25] are recorded he crumbled before it one
[1:13:28] natural man standing in right here this
[1:13:31] is God that's got ahold of his heart
[1:13:33] Moses could not get away from this
[1:13:36] promise if he wanted to because this is
[1:13:40] God's heart this was not a burden that
[1:13:42] Moses drummed up it's not something that
[1:13:45] Moses went instead heed but it was a
[1:13:47] burden that dropped in Moses heart for
[1:13:50] those people to see that word fulfilled
[1:13:53] I want you to think of this for a moment
[1:13:56] I want you to think of this I've thought
[1:13:58] about this for months now
[1:14:00] you think of how that after everything
[1:14:02] has taken place where you were here all
[1:14:05] the chatting all the times that they've
[1:14:07] come to him and then even when it comes
[1:14:09] to that place to where they reject going
[1:14:12] over into the land and then even when
[1:14:15] they start out the next day and start to
[1:14:17] go up and say well we're going to go on
[1:14:19] up to the land we realize we sinned and
[1:14:20] disobeyed against God and they're in
[1:14:22] greater if they're even and further
[1:14:23] disobedience you look at how within this
[1:14:25] time Moses did not know it was not
[1:14:28] revealed to him that we're gonna be in
[1:14:30] that land for forty years it was not
[1:14:33] revealed to Caleb we're gonna be here
[1:14:34] for forty years but I want to drop a
[1:14:37] little something to you you think they
[1:14:39] weren't disappointed a little bit you
[1:14:45] know with me tonight I guarantee you
[1:14:48] they were disappointed I guarantee you
[1:14:50] they were disappointed but there's had
[1:14:53] to be listen to me there had to be that
[1:14:56] of where they nurtured on the very
[1:14:59] promise by the Spirit of God through
[1:15:01] where they wouldn't allow bitterness to
[1:15:03] come up in against the people who they
[1:15:05] saw every day in the camp and even those
[1:15:07] who had went along with others who had
[1:15:09] actually spoke outright and those who
[1:15:11] had actually assimilated with that and
[1:15:13] said well yeah we can't go up and they
[1:15:14] had tried as well they had to actually
[1:15:16] go out and get manna with them same
[1:15:18] people they had to get water with them
[1:15:20] same people no doubt they might have
[1:15:21] said across the same table but they had
[1:15:23] to be able to look at those people
[1:15:25] listen to me now and not sit there with
[1:15:27] bitterness in their heart and say I'll
[1:15:29] tell you what if you hadn't done this
[1:15:31] look what we would have been if you they
[1:15:34] would have never ever went any further
[1:15:35] but if I can actually do a little
[1:15:38] quantum leap here tonight when they
[1:15:39] actually came in the land showing that
[1:15:42] Caleb himself had actually been so
[1:15:44] occupied with the promise of God sure
[1:15:47] what's he disappointed in what was
[1:15:49] happening absolutely sure he was
[1:15:51] discouraged that they themselves did not
[1:15:53] move into the promise but Caleb could
[1:15:55] say God made the promise and whether
[1:15:57] it's 20 30 40 50 God is going to fulfill
[1:16:01] his word and I don't care what I'm on
[1:16:04] what kind of shape I'm in God said I
[1:16:06] would be there in that land it
[1:16:09] didn't matter do you realize how much
[1:16:11] that Caleb occupied himself in the midst
[1:16:14] of all that unbelief that was in the
[1:16:16] camp he was able to instruct his
[1:16:18] children his daughters to wear his
[1:16:21] daughter's knew the law of inheritance
[1:16:24] he could not have had bitterness you
[1:16:27] talking about the grace of God they did
[1:16:30] not even have the Holy Ghost like we
[1:16:32] have it but he did have another spirit
[1:16:36] in him you think about Zola Fayette and
[1:16:38] all the rest of them that stood true to
[1:16:40] the word and the different ones Joshua
[1:16:41] how they would stand there this is why
[1:16:43] I'm trying to say to you tonight that
[1:16:45] Moses you think they weren't tempted to
[1:16:47] be bitter to be against Mohammed man
[1:16:49] here we are out in the winters do you
[1:16:51] think they weren't tempted you think
[1:16:52] listen friends it's a lot easier to look
[1:16:55] at every negativity around you and look
[1:16:58] at all that and say I'll tell you if
[1:16:59] this one that way and if this church is
[1:17:01] better here and if this was here and if
[1:17:04] this was here you're not drawing the
[1:17:05] Friends of God to your life but in this
[1:17:07] and friends many times God will allow
[1:17:10] things to happen he'll allow
[1:17:11] circumstances to come up to test you to
[1:17:15] see what is really in your heart he'll
[1:17:17] allow it to be exposed he'll allow
[1:17:19] greenness to come out he'll allow that
[1:17:21] testing time it's not taking God by
[1:17:24] surprise
[1:17:24] it takes you and I by surprise but it's
[1:17:27] in this time but we live a life of
[1:17:30] intercession on behalf of our children
[1:17:32] if Caleb would not have lived on the
[1:17:35] intercessory life think of what his home
[1:17:37] would have been like I'll tell you them
[1:17:40] people lord have mercy
[1:17:43] why couldn't they have taken the land
[1:17:45] couldn't they have done you see what
[1:17:48] kind of hold me to have him for no more
[1:17:51] they would have been the righteous but
[1:17:54] you see God already seen what kind of
[1:17:56] spirit was in him it was an intercession
[1:18:01] according to the promise so intercession
[1:18:03] isn't just what we pray but an
[1:18:05] intercession is even how that we live
[1:18:07] our lives in faith according to the
[1:18:10] promise no doubt setting right here
[1:18:13] brother kress I think of different ones
[1:18:15] that you know you you you you live
[1:18:17] during the time when they've people were
[1:18:18] writing off the rapture is gonna be in
[1:18:20] 1977 and all these other
[1:18:22] like that and truly you know what you
[1:18:24] know no doubt many would have been happy
[1:18:26] for that but you know what I want in yet
[1:18:28] and he can't come off that intercessory
[1:18:32] seat until every name's been splashed he
[1:18:35] can't come off of there you say why did
[1:18:37] the Prophet bring that out there but the
[1:18:39] days of intercessory is over that is
[1:18:41] looking at the at hand friends we're
[1:18:44] living in the time right now that this
[1:18:46] word that's been spoken it's identified
[1:18:49] what's been down through time and it's
[1:18:51] time for you and I had to recognize
[1:18:52] we're at the end time and know tonight
[1:18:55] that once that last name has been
[1:18:57] expressed on earth and that name has
[1:18:59] been manifested splash underneath that
[1:19:01] Clorox bleach that intercessory seat
[1:19:04] becomes a judgement seat and when he
[1:19:06] himself changes the road of a priestly
[1:19:09] robe when he changes his robe you and I
[1:19:12] get our Road change as well our change
[1:19:15] will match the change that's went on in
[1:19:17] heaven but right now he's a faithful
[1:19:21] intercessor aren't you glad for them so
[1:19:25] it looks so bleak no doubt to the eye of
[1:19:27] Moses my momma now look how the here
[1:19:30] Moses Moses when he prayed that prayer
[1:19:33] we read there in numbers 14 Moses prayed
[1:19:36] but even that God not only would show
[1:19:38] the greatness of his mercy but also how
[1:19:41] that God would actually bring correction
[1:19:43] separation that God would forgive
[1:19:45] iniquity and transgression
[1:19:47] long-suffering sonja's mercy and by no
[1:19:49] means clearing the guilty to see how
[1:19:52] that God Himself can look down to the
[1:19:54] depths and his word be able to separate
[1:19:57] who is guilty and who's not I'm glad
[1:19:59] that he is the one who's in charge of
[1:20:01] that tonight I'm glad that's not left up
[1:20:03] to me I'm glad it's not left up to you
[1:20:05] because no doubt you were to wrote me
[1:20:07] off maybe I were to wrote you off we
[1:20:09] could have wrote off a lot of other
[1:20:11] people but let me tell you something
[1:20:12] what matters is it's where our name is
[1:20:15] in God's book it matters where that God
[1:20:17] himself and how that he is working in
[1:20:19] dealing in our life let me tell you
[1:20:21] something friends don't you write nobody
[1:20:23] off I don't care how bad it looks I
[1:20:25] don't care how bleak it looks it might
[1:20:27] look like they're going completely plumb
[1:20:29] the opposite way but remember there is a
[1:20:31] promise that you're able to hold up
[1:20:33] before the throne of God
[1:20:35] you don't have to worry about you're not
[1:20:37] the one who can make them see or the one
[1:20:39] who can make them this or make them that
[1:20:41] or make them that that's already been
[1:20:43] determined but what you can do is pray
[1:20:45] for them and lift their name before the
[1:20:48] throne of Almighty God here's Moses now
[1:20:56] let's look at this and numbers 21 let me
[1:20:59] just try to come down here here's Moses
[1:21:02] the people now in verse 5 here they
[1:21:06] journey verse you know from first few
[1:21:09] verses of this chapter one a great
[1:21:10] battle then here they come across the
[1:21:13] way that then during journeying and
[1:21:15] they're discouraged verse five says the
[1:21:17] people speak against God and against
[1:21:19] Moses sure not their man we'd have been
[1:21:23] cutting them out right wherefore have
[1:21:28] you brought us up out of Egypt to die in
[1:21:30] the wilderness for there is no bread
[1:21:32] neither is there any water and our soul
[1:21:35] loveth this like bread and the Lord sent
[1:21:40] fiery serpents among the people and they
[1:21:43] bit the people and much people of Israel
[1:21:47] died therefore the people came to Moses
[1:21:52] and said we have sinned for we have
[1:21:57] spoken against the Lord and against thee
[1:22:00] now what's this they're acknowledging
[1:22:02] their sin you see the fiery serpents set
[1:22:08] loose who look and say oh my goodness
[1:22:10] this serpents that were sent loose but
[1:22:12] if them serpents hadn't been set loose
[1:22:14] and bitten them and there were some of
[1:22:16] them that died there had never been this
[1:22:18] response of repentance we have sinned
[1:22:23] they're brought to a place Omaha we've
[1:22:26] sinned because we've spoke against the
[1:22:29] Lord and against thee notice what they
[1:22:32] asked pray unto the Lord that he'd take
[1:22:35] away the Serpent's from us
[1:22:39] and Moses said you're the one that's
[1:22:42] done it you're the one to phrase how
[1:22:49] many times has Moses prayed for him even
[1:22:54] when they've asked for other things
[1:22:55] quail and other things Moses went and
[1:22:58] prayed for him oh god I hope we can
[1:23:02] really see this in the depth tonight
[1:23:04] Moses never washed his hands he couldn't
[1:23:07] it was a promise that was there he
[1:23:11] couldn't get focused on the mixed
[1:23:13] multitude there's a seed in there they
[1:23:18] meant there's a bride that's coming
[1:23:19] forth and Moses prayed that word prayed
[1:23:24] means to intervene interpose pray to
[1:23:27] meditate and mediate to intercede Moses
[1:23:30] prayed for the people and the Lord said
[1:23:33] to Moses watch this now this
[1:23:34] intercessory prayer and the Lord said
[1:23:36] unto Moses make me a fiery Serpent and
[1:23:38] set it upon a pole and it shall come to
[1:23:41] pass that every one that is bitten when
[1:23:43] he looketh upon it shall live and Moses
[1:23:45] made a serpent of brass and put it on a
[1:23:48] pole and it came to pass that of a
[1:23:50] serpent had bitten any man when he
[1:23:52] beheld the serpent of brass he lived
[1:23:56] here God showing the very offering up of
[1:24:00] the true atonement of the Lord Jesus I
[1:24:02] want to watch this brother Ram takes
[1:24:05] this in the message in sign and he asked
[1:24:08] he poses a question he says how he says
[1:24:11] when Moses he's interceding for the
[1:24:13] people he said why did Moses intercede
[1:24:16] and brother Ram jumps immediately to
[1:24:18] Genesis 22 how there was a ram that was
[1:24:22] provided for Abraham and he goes into
[1:24:25] this there's a crucial moment he says to
[1:24:27] where even though Moses was learned in
[1:24:30] all the wisdom of all of Egypt you you
[1:24:33] think he didn't know about snakebites he
[1:24:35] knew about snake bites come on now sand
[1:24:37] snakes were not toys in Egypt then when
[1:24:41] they were symbols they were prescient
[1:24:43] there but you see it wasn't wisdom of
[1:24:45] Egypt it wasn't natural wisdom that
[1:24:48] could take it away but that pillar of
[1:24:50] fire that angel of
[1:24:51] covenant that had brought him out he was
[1:24:53] that one that was there that cloud by
[1:24:55] day that killer fire by night he was the
[1:24:58] one who Moses would look to and Moses
[1:25:01] would receive what was needed for the
[1:25:03] people at that moment and here in the
[1:25:05] midst of the time when the people were
[1:25:07] dying when their poison itself was
[1:25:10] moving in and lives were being taken at
[1:25:12] that time here Moses steps in and begins
[1:25:15] to pray on behalf of the people let me
[1:25:17] tell you something this was not a people
[1:25:20] who deserved prayer they didn't deserve
[1:25:23] intercessory prayer you and I don't
[1:25:26] deserve intercessory prayer they didn't
[1:25:29] deserve it but nonetheless here the
[1:25:32] heart of God moving forward it prayed
[1:25:35] and it brings to hoga genre on the scene
[1:25:37] what is needed in that moment to provide
[1:25:40] for them one who's able when they can
[1:25:43] look to him look and live in their faith
[1:25:46] lunes what they would have to do they
[1:25:48] would actually have to believe that what
[1:25:51] God had told that prophet but when you
[1:25:53] look for her to that brace and serpent
[1:25:56] not just look on it but by faith you
[1:25:58] look at that and you realize that sin is
[1:26:01] already judged they had to be able by
[1:26:04] faith to look at that let me tell you
[1:26:06] something that's exactly the what God
[1:26:08] calls to the heart of each and every one
[1:26:10] of us tonight it's represented that sin
[1:26:13] was judged and it was met in the Lord
[1:26:16] Jesus Christ for whatever the need is in
[1:26:19] our life he already provided for you and
[1:26:21] I when you and I did not married it did
[1:26:24] not deserve that but God Himself
[1:26:26] interceded for you and me on our behalf
[1:26:32] and watch this here this is in the camp
[1:26:36] of Israel you with me now this is in
[1:26:40] God's camp here comes a man by the name
[1:26:44] of Balak and he calls up Balaam and he
[1:26:49] takes Balaam to a place as the Bible
[1:26:52] says in numbers 22 41 and he took Balaam
[1:26:55] you know this is all positional
[1:26:58] it was where he wanted to take Balaam
[1:27:02] Balak knew where to take him
[1:27:03] he knew what pewter said in and how to
[1:27:06] point it out to him you with me he knew
[1:27:09] how to look things out this was position
[1:27:11] it wasn't no one you just stay wherever
[1:27:12] you want to stay he took him up so that
[1:27:15] he would look at the uttermost parts of
[1:27:17] Israel better you know
[1:27:21] Balaam himself said I can't say nothing
[1:27:23] but what God puts in my mouth because
[1:27:25] God already told him I'm gonna put it in
[1:27:27] your mouth and you're gonna say even
[1:27:29] though you're here by your own self-will
[1:27:30] and permissive will but you're gonna say
[1:27:33] what I put in your mouth to say do you
[1:27:35] realize even though that Balak was
[1:27:37] determined to curse Israel it might look
[1:27:40] like they deserved a good old cursing
[1:27:42] come on somebody it looked like they
[1:27:45] deserved a good old cursing you think
[1:27:47] Bailey would have brought Balaam up
[1:27:48] there and said curse them if it didn't
[1:27:50] look like that man for sure they'll be
[1:27:52] cursed but you see when you get to
[1:27:54] looking at it there that there was a
[1:27:56] shout of the king in the camp there was
[1:27:58] that where that brazen serpent was
[1:28:01] raised within the camp and when the God
[1:28:03] began to move and he spoke there through
[1:28:06] Balaam you find there that in verse 8 of
[1:28:08] Numbers 23 here he goes how shall I
[1:28:11] curse whom God hath not cursed
[1:28:14] how shall I defy whom the LORD hath not
[1:28:16] defined for from the tops of the rocks I
[1:28:19] see him and from the hills I behold him
[1:28:22] lo the people shall dwell alone and
[1:28:24] shall not be reckoned among the nation
[1:28:26] there are separated people are you with
[1:28:29] me this is what God is seeing I hope
[1:28:32] you're with me now just just a few
[1:28:35] chapters before now just a few chapters
[1:28:38] move out of the way Moses I'm gonna take
[1:28:40] them all I'm gonna diss Herot every one
[1:28:43] of them I'm gonna send a pestilence
[1:28:44] among I'm gonna slay every one of them
[1:28:46] that was just a few chapters ago uh-huh
[1:28:50] who can count all of this who can count
[1:28:53] the dust of Jacob and the number of the
[1:28:55] fourth part of Israel let me die the
[1:28:57] death of the righteous and let my last
[1:29:00] end be like this
[1:29:03] god it's not a man that he should lie
[1:29:06] neither the son of man that he should
[1:29:08] repent I find this so intriguing that
[1:29:10] this is mentioned right here don't you I
[1:29:12] find it so intriguing has he said and
[1:29:14] shall he not do it see he's not going to
[1:29:18] alter his word he will fulfill his word
[1:29:23] oh my shall not make a good behold I
[1:29:27] have received commandment to bless and
[1:29:29] he hath blessed and I cannot reverse it
[1:29:33] it didn't matter what Balak wanted to be
[1:29:37] done
[1:29:37] Balak could have sucked and said you see
[1:29:39] this you see that this is wrong and that
[1:29:41] is wrong and this is wrong and that is
[1:29:43] wrong but do you realize here that when
[1:29:45] they're looking down
[1:29:47] this is not how Balaam sees them it's
[1:29:49] not how Balak Caesar it's how God sees
[1:29:53] them the Lord Jesus OMA hath he hath not
[1:30:02] beheld iniquity in Jacob remember just
[1:30:06] two chapters ago what we just read he
[1:30:09] hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob you
[1:30:12] see God's Word what God measures out for
[1:30:14] the time it ain't just the covering he
[1:30:17] means business there were people who
[1:30:19] walked in obedience who had repented and
[1:30:21] when they looked at that serpent that
[1:30:23] brazen serpent and they lived by faith
[1:30:26] right there they were identified with in
[1:30:29] that word and therefore when God would
[1:30:32] look down notice he hath not beheld
[1:30:34] iniquity and Jacob neither hath II seen
[1:30:36] perverseness and Israel the Lord his God
[1:30:39] is with him and the shout of a king is
[1:30:42] among them God brought them out of Egypt
[1:30:44] he hath as it were the strength of a
[1:30:46] unicorn surely there is no enchantment
[1:30:49] against Jacob neither is there any
[1:30:51] divination against Israel according to
[1:30:54] this time it shall be said of Jacob and
[1:30:56] of Israel what hath God wrought behold
[1:31:00] the people shall rise up as a great line
[1:31:02] and lift up himself as a young line he
[1:31:05] shall not lie down until they eat of the
[1:31:07] prey and drink the blood of the slain
[1:31:11] but we could go on and on because the
[1:31:15] prophecy keeps coming clear into the
[1:31:17] 24th chapter over into the Masonic
[1:31:21] Kingdom maybe these were people that had
[1:31:29] come out of Moses loins maybe God had
[1:31:31] just wiped all of them out and now he
[1:31:33] had a group of perfect people maybe he
[1:31:36] just perfect people all of those that in
[1:31:39] previous chapters they were all gone
[1:31:42] how could it be that God could say I've
[1:31:45] not even beheld iniquity in Jacob how
[1:31:50] could it be because God is looking at
[1:31:53] the atonement in the camp God's looking
[1:31:59] at the atonement in the camp I'll tell
[1:32:01] you what you can take a great lesson
[1:32:03] from this right here when you begin to
[1:32:05] look at this and realize that though our
[1:32:07] state Israel state it required
[1:32:10] discipline
[1:32:12] you with me it required discipline but
[1:32:15] you know what against all the enemies
[1:32:17] God is for us if God be for us who can
[1:32:22] be against us
[1:32:26] it didn't matter of all the curstyn they
[1:32:28] wanted to do God was four it doesn't
[1:32:33] matter if all the shortcomings this and
[1:32:35] that God is for us amen
[1:32:39] if God be for us then who can be against
[1:32:43] us
[1:32:45] now let me close on this plane God's
[1:32:51] faithfulness his intercession Balaam
[1:32:57] comes along and he realizes he's not
[1:33:02] gonna be able to curse them
[1:33:02] you can't curse them God's already
[1:33:05] blessed them I don't care how hard you
[1:33:09] try you ain't go to cursing but he
[1:33:11] realized gods look at this he is
[1:33:14] bringing them to a place God will be
[1:33:17] forced to deal with them according to
[1:33:18] his word
[1:33:19] you see Satan's deceptiveness to invite
[1:33:23] them into this feast here in numbers 25
[1:33:26] numbers 24 25 of how that when the feast
[1:33:30] came of Bal peor and inviting them in
[1:33:33] and realized what had taken place there
[1:33:35] of how that when they should have never
[1:33:36] mixed up there the sons of God Israel
[1:33:39] should have never went up there into the
[1:33:41] camp but when they got up there in the
[1:33:43] camp all the dancing and everything that
[1:33:45] had taken place and was going on that
[1:33:47] lusts rose in their heart and then you
[1:33:49] find of how that when God spoke to Moses
[1:33:52] here's intercession now he speaks to
[1:33:55] Moses at that time and he says I want
[1:33:58] you he said to take the numbers 25 for I
[1:34:01] want you to take all the heads of the
[1:34:03] people and hang them up before the Lord
[1:34:04] against the Sun that the fierce anger of
[1:34:07] the Lord may be turned away from Israel
[1:34:09] you say that don't sound like
[1:34:11] intercession it is every time every time
[1:34:16] when Israel had disobeyed there was
[1:34:20] always blood that was shed there was
[1:34:23] those that was that was slew at the base
[1:34:26] of the mountain there who's on the
[1:34:27] Lord's side let him come over here there
[1:34:30] was blood that was shed each time it was
[1:34:34] to do away with those who had actually
[1:34:36] sinned against God see God won't clear
[1:34:39] the guilty God's able to see to the
[1:34:43] depth and see the separation that's a
[1:34:45] word of discernment notice this he goes
[1:34:47] on to say to the judges in verse 5
[1:34:49] slay you every one of his men that were
[1:34:52] joined unto Baal peor
[1:34:54] and then verse six and one of the
[1:34:57] children of Israel came and brought unto
[1:34:59] his brethren a Midianite us woman in the
[1:35:02] side of Moses and the side of all the
[1:35:03] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:35:05] what disrespect you see what sin did it
[1:35:10] came so disrespectful he got to such a
[1:35:14] place to where they felt like they could
[1:35:15] bring it right in the camp that was
[1:35:18] disrespect come on friends you know
[1:35:23] there's a time when we look at things
[1:35:24] and for the mercy of Almighty God I can
[1:35:26] have mercy on somebody that's the first
[1:35:28] time coming to the house of God second
[1:35:30] time third time and what-have-you I can
[1:35:32] have mercy until God and seeing how God
[1:35:34] will move and bring it well how God will
[1:35:37] direct it in my heart and in your heart
[1:35:39] as well but to see that we're that we
[1:35:41] would actually allow the congregation of
[1:35:43] the Lord to be disrespected and called
[1:35:46] that the love of God that ain't the love
[1:35:48] of God that's compromise
[1:35:51] that's compromise they brought it right

[1:36:14] stand him on God's Word he intercedes
[1:36:17] with great faithfulness if you don't
[1:36:21] tell him who will no glory in the sight
[1:36:27] of Moses in the sight of all the
[1:36:29] congregation of the children of Israel
[1:36:31] who were weeping before the door of the
[1:36:32] tabernacle of the congregation and when
[1:36:35] Phineas the son of Eleazar the son of
[1:36:37] Aaron the priest saw it he rose up from
[1:36:39] among the congregation and took a
[1:36:41] javelin in his hand
[1:36:42] and he went after the man of Israel into
[1:36:45] the tent and thrust both of them through
[1:36:47] the man of Israel and the woman through
[1:36:49] her belly so the plague was stay from
[1:36:52] the children of Israel and those that
[1:36:54] died in the plague were twenty and four
[1:36:56] thousand and the Lord spake unto Moses
[1:36:59] saying
[1:36:59] phineas the son of Eleazar the son of
[1:37:02] Aaron the priests have turned away my
[1:37:04] wrath from the children of Israel while
[1:37:06] he was
[1:37:07] Arius for my sake among them that I
[1:37:09] consume not the children of Israel in my
[1:37:12] Zaius my jealousy
[1:37:16] we're for say behold I give unto Him my
[1:37:21] covenant of peace and he shall have it
[1:37:23] his seed after him even the covenant of
[1:37:26] an everlasting priesthood because he was
[1:37:29] zealous for his God and made
[1:37:32] an atonement for the children of Israel
[1:37:37] every disobedient through the exodus
[1:37:40] through numbers there was blood that was
[1:37:43] shed God let him know that I have bought
[1:37:45] you I have laid nations in order to
[1:37:48] bring you to myself I spoiled all of
[1:37:52] Egypt and purchased you to myself blood
[1:37:58] makes a purchase an atonement he made an
[1:38:02] atonement for the children of Israel let
[1:38:05] me read it out of Psalms 106 I'm closing
[1:38:09] they joined themselves and also in the
[1:38:12] Belfiore
[1:38:12] and they the sacrifices of the dead thus
[1:38:15] they provoked him to anger with their
[1:38:16] inventions and the plague break in upon
[1:38:19] them then stood up Phineas and executed
[1:38:24] judgment you know what this word
[1:38:27] judgment is it's the same word Moses
[1:38:29] prayed unto the people unto God for the
[1:38:32] people it's one who intervenes one who
[1:38:37] mediates one who intercedes on their
[1:38:41] behalf if this had not been purged out
[1:38:45] of the camp they all would have died but
[1:38:48] you see sin cannot be in the camp God
[1:38:52] will not permit sin to be left in the
[1:38:54] camp he'll bring it right across if you
[1:38:56] don't take care of it Iran will bring
[1:38:58] that javelin right down to where you're
[1:38:59] sitting he'll bring it across what
[1:39:02] brother Samuel you are not be sparing
[1:39:03] people let me tell you something we
[1:39:05] ought to value his presence more than we
[1:39:08] value our feelings we ought to value the
[1:39:11] promise of God more than we value well
[1:39:14] I'm afraid I'll hurt my son I'm afraid
[1:39:15] I'll hurt my daughter I'm trained I'll
[1:39:17] hurt this we ought to be mindful and say
[1:39:19] Lord I don't want to hurt you this is
[1:39:23] intercession friends intercession that
[1:39:27] goes along and Pat's people on the back
[1:39:29] is not intercession
[1:39:32] it's like providing tour guides to hell
[1:39:36] intercession stands up according to the
[1:39:39] promise even when you look at situation
[1:39:43] sometimes brother Branham would tell us
[1:39:46] all through the message and not just
[1:39:47] brother Branham it's right there in the
[1:39:49] scriptures this is where he's drawing it
[1:39:50] from and Titus and Timothy and he would
[1:39:54] speak about godly sisters helping the
[1:39:56] other younger ones he would speak about
[1:39:59] the older brothers helping the other
[1:40:01] ones remember you can't do it with
[1:40:03] criticism brother you can't do it with
[1:40:05] criticism sister you've got to have the
[1:40:07] right heart
[1:40:08] Phineas did not have a heart of
[1:40:10] criticism here it was none of them I'm
[1:40:13] gonna run it down that's not what this
[1:40:14] was God would not have accepted it his
[1:40:18] zeal was for the Lord God and that's
[1:40:22] what our seal has to be is for the Lord
[1:40:26] God when our seal that's what Moses seal
[1:40:29] was for this is what intercession was
[1:40:31] according to the promise it was
[1:40:33] according to the Word of God
[1:40:36] this is the kind of life I believe is
[1:40:39] worthy of the gospel I believe that
[1:40:42] don't you
[1:40:43] this is the kind of life that God would
[1:40:46] have us to live I believe that
[1:40:53] interceding according to the promise God
[1:40:56] ain't gonna let nobody no enemy is gonna
[1:40:59] put down his children you seen that that
[1:41:06] God said they're mine I know what they
[1:41:09] need I know what discipline they need
[1:41:11] and I'll correct him aren't you glad God
[1:41:16] don't leave correction up to everybody
[1:41:17] else but God Himself faithfully corrects
[1:41:22] us remember as many as I love Jason and
[1:41:28] I rebuke be zealous therefore and repent
[1:41:34] this is intercession according to the
[1:41:37] promise of Almighty God you love him
[1:41:41] tonight
[1:41:42] let's pray Lord Jesus oh my
[1:41:52] what your word is truly a Lord a
[1:41:56] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:41:59] the heart
[1:42:00] we see here Lord in your word
[1:42:03] intercession intercession it's not
[1:42:08] something Lord God where you close your

[1:42:21] oh it's perfect
[1:42:22] they can do no wrong no the Lord
[1:42:30] intercession according to the promise
[1:42:35] father to think Lord God the burden Lord
[1:42:39] that you placed upon Moses life it was a
[1:42:42] tight your prophet would place it two
[1:42:46] different places in the message and he
[1:42:49] would call it not the power of a prophet
[1:42:52] he called it in the message presuming
[1:42:55] watched the power of a believer
[1:42:59] Moses would throw himself in the way in
[1:43:04] other place he said what's the power of
[1:43:05] a saint before God or deceive a need had
[1:43:12] to be such a love in his heart we know
[1:43:16] Lord God but even how that Paul would
[1:43:20] write to us by the Spirit of God and he
[1:43:22] would speak to us regarding forgiveness
[1:43:24] he would speak regarding the bowels of
[1:43:26] Mercy he was not writing it to just
[1:43:31] anybody but he said put on as the elect
[1:43:35] of God sink into
