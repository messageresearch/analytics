[23:04] to your leading lord we love you and we
[23:07] thank you father
[23:08] in the name of jesus christ amen
[23:12] amen god bless you let's look here in
[23:14] the scripture
[23:16] ephesians 4 and i'm not going to have
[23:18] you standing long
[23:20] i want to just go into ephesians 4.
[23:28] verse 7 but unto every one of us has
[23:31] given grace according to the measure of
[23:33] the gift of
[23:35] so we are all partakers of the gift of
[23:39] christ
[23:40] the life his life wherefore he saith
[23:43] when he ascended up on high
[23:46] he led captivity captive and gave gifts
[23:49] unto men
[23:50] now that he ascended and what is it but
[23:54] that
[23:54] he also descended first into the lower
[23:58] parts of the earth
[24:00] he that descended is the same also that
[24:03] ascended up far
[24:04] above all heavens that he might fill all
[24:07] things
[24:09] and he gave some apostles
[24:12] and some prophets and some evangelists
[24:15] and some pastors
[24:17] and some teachers amen may god bless you
[24:21] bless the reading of the word as you're
[24:22] being seated
[24:24] i want to say i think as a congregation
[24:26] we
[24:28] certainly been benefited
[24:31] with the ministry that god has given
[24:35] and brought our way i just thank god
[24:37] when we are here i just two weeks ago
[24:40] brother andrew glover and come you know
[24:42] had come and i had actually asked
[24:44] brother andrew sometime
[24:46] before to make way for that
[24:49] and we didn't see brother jerry you know
[24:54] come and i just just so appreciate
[24:57] the word of the lord because
[25:01] for me i was fed i was blessed
[25:04] and i know that the church we were
[25:07] edified
[25:08] and you know god just has a way of
[25:11] coming
[25:12] and i think brother jerry put it in that
[25:14] manner
[25:15] last thursday night god is
[25:18] as we've looked at this is a great
[25:21] master diamond
[25:22] and there are chips off of that diamond
[25:24] and god
[25:25] has so fitted that for each one of those
[25:29] gifts that he has bestowed for our life
[25:33] it's god's love to us and how that god
[25:35] will take
[25:36] that gift and god will take it as it is
[25:39] so
[25:39] set in a way and reflect himself through
[25:42] it
[25:42] and every gift itself even as a man can
[25:45] have the same
[25:46] calling in his life but every gift is
[25:49] unique
[25:50] the experiences and how that the man
[25:53] will preach and how that he goes about
[25:55] god doesn't remove the temperament or
[25:58] the makeup
[25:59] of the man but god sets right down in
[26:01] the midst of that
[26:03] and god will will speak and direct his
[26:05] word and i i just so appreciate
[26:08] how that god is brother brandon would
[26:10] call it god's a
[26:11] god of variety he has a great bouquet of
[26:14] flowers and you know how it is in your
[26:16] uh perhaps in your yard you know i uh
[26:20] even for myself many times i'm looking
[26:22] and i'm evaluating in my flowers and my
[26:24] plants and i'm seeing is there
[26:26] is things too densely for me i say is it
[26:29] too densely the same color
[26:31] if it's all the same color it's not
[26:33] going to be highlighted but i need to
[26:35] break things up maybe have blue
[26:37] highlighted here
[26:38] variegation of leaves right here a white
[26:40] that will
[26:41] that will uh show up the green and god's
[26:44] a god of variety
[26:45] and in every way and in every gift god
[26:48] has it in such a measure that
[26:50] it is all comes back to highlight
[26:52] himself
[26:53] and it's his love that ministers to us
[26:56] as a body and i'm so thankful for how
[27:00] that god
[27:01] has has has used uh when brother andrew
[27:04] was here and brother jerry
[27:06] the messages that were just so so timely
[27:09] and just so many things that just on my
[27:12] heart
[27:12] i i was truly i refreshed and i so thank
[27:16] god for them yielding to the lord
[27:18] i want to continue here tonight and i uh
[27:22] you know looking at this thought on that
[27:24] of of
[27:25] of prophets and seeing this with the
[27:27] gifts that god
[27:29] has placed in the body and if you
[27:31] remember after a few weeks back we were
[27:33] showing
[27:35] that within this scripture that indeed
[27:37] there are prophets in the new testament
[27:40] and as there are prophets that are in
[27:42] the new testament we see it through the
[27:43] book of acts we see that
[27:45] but i want you now tonight this is where
[27:48] i'm going to start
[27:49] moving uh into that place that
[27:52] even every every preacher as i'll read
[27:55] here in just a moment
[27:56] every preacher that comes under the
[27:58] inspiration of the holy spirit
[28:00] in the new testament is a prophet but we
[28:03] recognize in the word that god has
[28:06] promises
[28:07] that there would indeed be prophets that
[28:10] were just
[28:10] more than preachers they would be seers
[28:15] and there's a purpose and a reason for
[28:18] why
[28:18] god does everything that he does
[28:22] and it's to catch what's going on as
[28:25] brother branham would
[28:26] uh take an example for you and
[28:30] i to catch as a symphony to where there
[28:33] are certain
[28:33] motions and certain beats that are to be
[28:36] movements that then will be reflected in
[28:39] the music sheet
[28:40] or what is being played from the music
[28:42] sheet
[28:43] it's reflected there in the great
[28:45] symphony
[28:46] and it's it's god that's at work it's
[28:49] god that has
[28:50] everything in control and god is working
[28:53] and we look at this with prophets and
[28:57] to recognize that prophets themselves
[28:59] are not
[29:00] made they
[29:04] are born and ordained of god
[29:09] jeremiah 1 verse 4 then the word of the
[29:12] lord came unto me
[29:14] saying before i formed thee
[29:17] in the belly i knew thee
[29:20] and before thou came us forth out of the
[29:22] womb
[29:23] i sanctified thee and i ordained thee a
[29:27] prophet unto the nations
[29:29] jeremiah didn't know this but god let
[29:32] him knew
[29:33] let him know i knew you before
[29:38] this is one characteristic of a ministry
[29:41] of a prophet is to connect us with that
[29:45] which was before
[29:50] amos 7 verse 14.
[29:55] and then answered amos and said unto uh
[29:58] marzia i was no prophet
[30:02] neither was i a prophet's son
[30:06] but i was a herdman and a gatherer of
[30:09] sycamore fruit so he says declaring
[30:13] i was not a prophet i was doing
[30:16] serving the lord walking with god
[30:19] i was a herdman i was taking fruit
[30:23] but now he declares in other words
[30:26] this is not my choosing
[30:29] i'm not doing this because oh i just
[30:32] felt impressed
[30:34] that's not it at all he's letting him
[30:36] know i was going this way
[30:39] i was serving the lord but god had a
[30:42] purpose for my life
[30:47] i tell you we could really preach with
[30:48] these things but i think the spirit of
[30:51] truth as he's here
[30:52] he's able to open and guide in those
[30:54] places and ways that
[30:56] i can't take time to speak on but you
[30:58] can see
[30:59] that as the prophet was ordained and
[31:01] chosen so is there a people ordained and
[31:04] chosen
[31:08] hallelujah and the lord look at this and
[31:10] the lord
[31:11] took me as i followed the flock and the
[31:14] lord
[31:15] said unto me go prophesy
[31:19] unto my people israel
[31:24] now when you look here in the old
[31:26] testament i know sometimes as
[31:29] speaking to bible readers maybe perhaps
[31:31] some of you that
[31:32] are new in the lord and even those are
[31:34] streaming sometimes when you
[31:37] are reading among in the old testament
[31:40] and with the old testament prophets
[31:42] you will find that how that the spirit
[31:45] of god will move upon them and you can
[31:47] be looking at it and saying
[31:48] what are they saying here then it seems
[31:51] like they're
[31:51] what's going on here and what's being
[31:53] said here there are things at times that
[31:56] are
[31:56] symbols and with a prophet
[32:00] a prophet is picked up and a prophet
[32:03] himself
[32:03] will see things that are going to come
[32:07] way out in the future yet he'll declare
[32:10] what is also going on right now
[32:14] and he'll come around and speak what is
[32:16] going to be in the very
[32:17] near future and a prophet you will say
[32:21] well how can he do that it's not the man
[32:24] it's the gift that lays in the man
[32:27] and the same one that reveals himself as
[32:30] he which was
[32:31] which is and which is to come the lord
[32:34] jesus christ
[32:35] he picks that man up
[32:40] and he lets him see it so
[32:44] there's the characteristics and i want
[32:46] to just really to
[32:47] to deal with some of this here tonight
[32:50] in looking at this
[32:51] part within the prophets a prophet
[32:55] is a seer you'll find that term
[32:58] it's used in the old testament it's used
[33:01] very
[33:02] very much in the old testament well seer
[33:04] is one who would see
[33:06] how can he see unless god shows him how
[33:10] can you and i
[33:11] see unless god shows us
[33:14] this is why even at times remember when
[33:17] god would show
[33:18] the prophet something he would take the
[33:20] prophet show the prophet
[33:22] a vision like he did zachariah of the
[33:25] candlesticks and he asked him
[33:27] what is this and zechariah says thou
[33:30] knowest
[33:31] what is it you see when there's things
[33:34] that we come face to face with
[33:37] god does not expect that you and i
[33:40] will know by our own intellects or by
[33:43] our own reasoning
[33:44] but when god shows us something the
[33:46] greatest thing we can do is say lord
[33:49] i know it's you speaking i don't
[33:51] understand
[33:52] it but god show me what it is that
[33:55] you're saying
[33:58] that's why god could take that prophet
[34:00] and the prophet didn't try to say
[34:01] well i think it's this or i think it's
[34:03] this or i think it's that but the
[34:05] prophet then relied on the one
[34:07] who was opening before him what he was
[34:10] saying
[34:11] i think that's the greatest thing within
[34:13] our lives that we can rely
[34:15] on the god who is opening his word and
[34:18] that's why the prophet would admonish
[34:20] us he says him revelation means
[34:23] more to you than perhaps you can realize
[34:28] because revelation bypasses the human
[34:31] realm of faking
[34:33] it bypasses our reasoning it drops
[34:37] into a level and we become connected
[34:40] with another place
[34:41] and it stabilizes our lives
[34:45] to where someone could try to shake you
[34:47] and it's not that you can't explain it
[34:49] but you have been connected and it
[34:52] stabilizes your life
[34:57] hallelujah that's what the holy ghost
[35:00] does in a alive
[35:02] this is why brother bram says we need to
[35:05] pray
[35:06] for revelation why would god come and
[35:10] reveal
[35:10] something if we're not desiring it
[35:14] oh god you don't speak to me do you want
[35:16] him to speak to you
[35:18] if you want him to speak to you invite
[35:20] him
[35:24] there's a religious group out there that
[35:27] only wants him to speak
[35:28] in a certain way and he's only going to
[35:30] speak by his word
[35:32] and in order for his word to be heard
[35:35] there first got to be a cleansing of the
[35:37] heart
[35:39] god just don't release revelation he
[35:42] first remember
[35:43] there must be a passover before there's
[35:46] unleavened bread
[35:50] so god god works everything is in his
[35:53] time
[35:54] and so we see a seer a foreteller
[35:57] think of how that peter under
[35:59] inspiration would reach back in the
[36:01] psalms and say
[36:03] david foresaw the lord speaking of a
[36:06] resurrection song
[36:07] david being a prophet caught up there by
[36:10] the spirit of god
[36:11] isaiah remember here comes isaiah
[36:14] into the temple of god in isaiah 6
[36:18] he's walked in that temple time after
[36:20] time after time after time
[36:23] but that day was different
[36:27] that day he saw the god
[36:30] who was in his temple he was
[36:33] no longer just coming in to the temple
[36:37] but now he sees the living god that's
[36:39] among us
[36:40] it becomes personal to his life
[36:44] and isaiah caught up by the spirit of
[36:47] god i think
[36:48] how the prophet would would would
[36:50] express it he said he was caught up
[36:52] beyond his senses
[36:53] what man in his right mind would say a
[36:56] virgin shall conceive
[36:59] that's never been done a man might be
[37:03] able to say well a man shall build an
[37:05] ark that's already been done
[37:09] but never has a virgin conceived
[37:14] many things that have taken place so you
[37:16] recognize
[37:17] that man yielded to god god picked him
[37:20] up
[37:20] and things were spoke through him that
[37:23] if he had
[37:24] let his reasoning catch it he would have
[37:26] said oh no i better not say this they're
[37:28] going to think i'm a kook they think i'm
[37:29] a knight this has never happened you see
[37:31] it could not come to his reasoning
[37:33] this is where oh my this is god's grace
[37:37] even to us as believers that god
[37:40] would give us something greater than
[37:42] reasoning
[37:45] what if what could be greater than
[37:46] reasoning thus saith
[37:48] the lord
[37:55] to be caught up in the very mind of god
[37:58] think of one isaiah
[38:01] in isaiah 53 here he is
[38:04] he writes of the report of the coming of
[38:08] the messiah
[38:09] not as something as though it's a future
[38:11] event
[38:13] i know you've heard me say this many
[38:14] times you've heard no doubt other
[38:16] preachers you see it in the scripture
[38:17] he's these words are wrote in past tense
[38:20] he was
[38:21] bruised for our iniquity
[38:24] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[38:27] him
[38:28] why the prophet was picked up to see
[38:32] what was there in god's mind and listen
[38:35] to me
[38:36] the works his works were finished
[38:39] from before the foundation of the world
[38:42] this is a drama that is unfolding
[38:48] [Applause]
[38:50] hallelujah amen oh glory
[38:53] where men have wanted to alter the
[38:55] script but god in his mercy
[38:58] sends a prophet to bring us back on
[39:00] script
[39:02] hallelujah glory be to god in the
[39:06] highest
[39:08] because it is very important that we are
[39:11] being caught up into god's mind because
[39:14] then we can clearly see
[39:17] that the thoughts of man are confusion
[39:22] look where it has led in the world that
[39:24] we live now
[39:28] her religion has produced a
[39:31] bird a cage full of every
[39:34] hateful and unclean bird
[39:37] the prophet of god picks it up in god of
[39:39] this evil age and says see
[39:41] the spirit of lawlessness
[39:45] what has produced that and they relieved
[39:47] the standard of the word
[39:50] what does it produce what we see going
[39:52] on now
[39:54] it's a people that did not like to
[39:57] retain god
[39:58] in their knowledge
[40:01] so that's why they want to rip
[40:03] everything down
[40:04] i'm going to preach
[40:08] they want to rip everything down why
[40:10] it's a spirit
[40:12] of destruction
[40:13] [Applause]
[40:16] because it speaks against them
[40:20] this is the same spirit that gets upon
[40:22] people that want to tear down
[40:24] the message a spirit of destruction
[40:30] want to take away the memorials and the
[40:32] history
[40:33] that have pointed to you and i that god
[40:36] is a living present
[40:38] god
[40:41] it is our heritage it is our history
[40:45] [Applause]
[40:50] that was free
[40:58] same spirit that's all around
[41:01] one to tear it down tear it down tear it
[41:04] down oh this never happened here and
[41:05] this here and this here what do i want
[41:07] to tear it down
[41:10] but thanks be to god there's a people on
[41:13] earth
[41:15] where they have rallied to the ensign
[41:17] that was promised and have been lifted
[41:19] up
[41:20] and back inside is made manifest in our
[41:22] lives
[41:23] and through our lives that indeed the
[41:25] enemy has come in like a flood but the
[41:27] spirit
[41:28] of the lord has rose a standard
[41:31] against the enemy
[41:35] [Applause]
[41:37] hallelujah it has brought the thoughts
[41:40] of man
[41:41] bring confusion
[41:45] and dissimilation
[41:48] and he leads man listen to me it leads
[41:51] man away
[41:52] from what god intended him to be a son
[41:55] of god
[41:59] one that would reflect his name one that
[42:02] will reflect his image
[42:04] that will reflect his character when
[42:06] jesus came he said i'm come
[42:08] in my father's name
[42:11] so it's coming back into the mind of god
[42:15] concerning the word
[42:17] the thoughts of god the way of the lord
[42:21] revealing himself to the people that
[42:24] we might walk pleasing according to his
[42:26] desire
[42:29] i want you to listen this state this out
[42:31] of the voice of the sign
[42:33] let me just say it before i don't forget
[42:35] it
[42:36] there's some messages i would love for
[42:38] you to listen to
[42:40] i'd like you to listen to brother brown
[42:41] preaches the way of a true prophet
[42:43] he preaches it twice he preaches it
[42:47] in jeffersonville in the middle of 62
[42:51] and then in the very beginning of 1963
[42:54] the way of a true prophet and i can tell
[42:57] you not just those messages but
[42:59] listen to those two messages as you're
[43:01] listening to those messages
[43:03] what is when you're listening you will
[43:05] hear as though it's almost he
[43:07] has seeing what is taking place
[43:11] it's because god has lifted him up to
[43:13] see this
[43:15] he sees the hooligans he sees all this
[43:17] all this stuff that's going on this
[43:18] nonsense and
[43:19] everything that's going on that people
[43:21] living all of that is identified
[43:24] are you with me
[43:29] because none of these things that are
[43:31] taking place all these movements
[43:33] they are against god
[43:37] they've got one agenda and that's a
[43:39] homosexual agenda
[43:41] it's not of god god is against that
[43:44] thing
[43:48] hallelujah it's satan once again using
[43:51] people like pawns
[43:57] but thanks be to god that our eyes are
[44:00] open
[44:04] and if you are caught up in that i say
[44:06] in the name of jesus christ
[44:08] get your head out of it get your heart
[44:10] out of it
[44:12] get back in line with the word
[44:16] hallelujah there's only one place we
[44:18] find true liberty
[44:20] and the real rights of a son and
[44:21] daughter of god and
[44:23] that is in the holy ghost
[44:27] my goodness i'm trying to come to this
[44:34] his credentials look he's speaking about
[44:36] a prophet his credentials
[44:40] is that god has vindicated this person
[44:42] to be a seer
[44:43] it's not a credentials of a school it's
[44:46] not a paper
[44:47] it's not well so-and-so sad and
[44:48] so-and-so
[44:51] god vindicates the person
[44:54] now look it says it's the english word a
[44:56] prophet just means a preacher
[44:58] anybody every preacher is a prophet
[45:02] because he is foretelling something
[45:04] preaching the word
[45:05] under inspiration is called a prophet
[45:08] but in the old testament
[45:10] they were more than that they were seers
[45:14] so he's laying this in because of the
[45:16] promise
[45:17] that we have been given one what i'm
[45:20] preaching of right now
[45:21] is not an agabus it's not a silas
[45:26] come on you know he read that they were
[45:27] prophets this is not
[45:29] this is not just a preacher it is a seer
[45:34] and god has set in his word promises
[45:37] that you and i the god made them for
[45:40] this
[45:41] generation that we're living in
[45:44] they were man who told things that was
[45:47] coming to pass
[45:48] and it happened that give him the rights
[45:52] to be the interpreter
[45:53] of the word for that day look at this
[45:55] statement because
[45:57] god took the word of that day and
[46:00] interpreted himself through that man
[46:03] what gives the man that right because
[46:05] god took his word
[46:07] and interprets that promise through that
[46:09] man's life
[46:12] think of how brother branham sit there
[46:13] next to brother brother eddie biscuit in
[46:15] the car
[46:16] ask him do you think that this could be
[46:18] that ministry
[46:20] that was prophesied and spoken there in
[46:22] malachi 4. he says
[46:24] from all i know i can see he says i do
[46:26] too and the presence of god
[46:28] came into that car let me just tell you
[46:30] it's more than a man claiming well this
[46:32] is who i am
[46:33] if that's what he's claiming that word
[46:36] is god
[46:36] and that word will act and perform
[46:39] itself
[46:40] according to that word it will not be
[46:43] the man
[46:43] trying to bring the word to pass the man
[46:46] will be a vessel and
[46:47] god will bring his word to pass
[46:51] come on preach with me now a little bit
[46:53] how much more in our lives ordained to
[46:55] be the bride of jesus christ
[46:57] it's not me struggling to be the bride
[46:59] it's not me trying to be the bride
[47:02] it is god himself that has taken a hold
[47:05] of our lives and we have surrendered
[47:07] it's
[47:08] god interpreting his word through our
[47:11] lives
[47:13] not what i say it's what he says
[47:18] because this blood has a voice
[47:23] the holy ghost speaks
[47:26] amen in christ out righteousness
[47:30] holiness purity
[47:33] [Music]
[47:37] that's what he come on the earth for
[47:39] he's always a sign
[47:41] when a prophet comes to the earth just
[47:43] watch as we go through it
[47:44] you see if it isn't so he always sends
[47:47] his prophet
[47:48] when you see a prophet rise on the scene
[47:51] look out
[47:52] we're looking for one to come now you
[47:54] know
[47:59] some of you i sent not too long i could
[48:01] find many other places
[48:04] some if i remember the one i sent you
[48:06] here's brother bosworth
[48:08] he was sitting right next to brother
[48:09] vale but the veil gives this personal
[48:11] testimony
[48:12] brother bosworth tugs him on the lamp
[48:13] pant leg and he's sitting right there
[48:15] brother brandon's standing there
[48:16] ministering you tense him he says
[48:19] this is what i've been waiting on that
[48:20] was promised in the word of god
[48:24] are you with me these men were not
[48:26] ignorant they knew
[48:28] there were promises in the world
[48:31] they knew the holy ghost would return to
[48:33] the church
[48:38] god did not send his word
[48:42] because there wasn't people to receive
[48:43] it god sends his word
[48:47] when there are people who are desiring
[48:50] for life
[48:56] oh my i just gotta stay on this here
[48:58] it's just so
[48:59] lord jesus and then when you
[49:03] see it you just remember it's fixing to
[49:05] happen
[49:06] this is his credentials then god
[49:09] interprets his word by him and through
[49:11] him
[49:11] numbers 12 6 tells us that remember the
[49:14] whole the entire bible
[49:16] was wrote by the prophets
[49:19] second peter 1 20 knowing this first
[49:22] that no prophecy of the scripture
[49:26] is of any private interpretation
[49:31] in other words a man cannot take a part
[49:34] of the word
[49:36] and that part of the word say it means
[49:38] this and then it contradicts here
[49:40] contradicts this if it contradicts one
[49:43] word
[49:44] it's not the right interpretation
[49:50] is that right none is of an
[49:54] isolated or a private interpretation
[49:56] it's to reveal it's like a picture
[49:59] can you imagine if you had a a a a
[50:01] puzzle
[50:02] and and here you are you know how it is
[50:03] you're putting together a puzzle you're
[50:05] starting looking for the last piece and
[50:06] you know how it is when you were little
[50:08] getting down to five pieces
[50:11] you want to be the last one to put the
[50:12] last piece in
[50:15] you didn't know it but the last piece
[50:17] lay within you
[50:20] [Applause]
[50:21] it's the finishing up in this hour but
[50:24] let me get back to my example here you
[50:26] are with the puzzle and what if
[50:28] somebody calls a piece to come about and
[50:31] on that piece
[50:32] it might it fits perfectly but when you
[50:34] see the picture on that face
[50:36] it comes into that place and you look
[50:38] and say something's not right
[50:41] you see all the rest of the beauty of
[50:42] this picture and yet you see this piece
[50:44] you're like
[50:45] it just man it just seems to dovetail
[50:48] but when you look at it it doesn't blend
[50:52] with the rest of the pieces
[50:56] that's what the word is to do
[50:59] it blends together to reveal
[51:02] jesus christ that he jehovah of the
[51:05] world
[51:06] is jesus of the new year
[51:13] hallelujah for the prophecy
[51:16] oh i like this came not
[51:19] in all time by the will of man
[51:22] so remember like we said i aim us it
[51:24] wasn't amos saying oh god
[51:26] oh lord i want to be a prophet lord i
[51:28] want to be a prophet no no he must say
[51:30] lord
[51:30] i'm so happy to serve you he didn't ask
[51:33] to be a prophet
[51:34] he didn't matter of fact if you don't
[51:35] talk let me just say it like this if you
[51:37] would have asked amos
[51:39] maybe a day before or a week before god
[51:42] spoke to him
[51:43] and said amos are you a prophet he'd
[51:45] have told him no i ain't a prophet
[51:47] do you have something to say i love the
[51:49] lord i'm so thankful for god's mercy
[51:52] amos what else you say well i know
[51:54] judgment's coming but i'm so thankful to
[51:56] be
[51:57] in the refuge but then here comes the
[52:00] day where god says
[52:02] i got something i want you to say you're
[52:05] going to be my prophet and these things
[52:07] you're going to speak
[52:08] you're going to i didn't identify that
[52:10] syria
[52:11] is coming upon as judgment upon israel
[52:15] you're going to point out their folly
[52:18] and all that's going on
[52:19] oh i'm sure that amos would have
[52:21] probably been saying lord is it possible
[52:23] let this cup pass from me
[52:28] now the honor and glory is to serve the
[52:30] lord but what god calls us to do
[52:32] is not comfortable to our flesh
[52:40] so run by the will of man then guys
[52:43] walking out there
[52:43] my i tell you what i'm i'm gonna tear
[52:46] this up you go sit down because you
[52:47] don't even have the right heart
[52:52] are you with me
[52:55] but holy men oh i love that holy men of
[52:58] god
[52:59] spake as they were moved
[53:03] by the holy ghost they were one
[53:07] with the word they were speaking amen
[53:11] they were caught up as brother branham
[53:14] would
[53:14] speak of this they're special the
[53:16] prophet is a special person
[53:22] they're built god has built them in a
[53:25] way
[53:26] even to where their conscience and
[53:29] subconscious
[53:30] will lay together they see visions
[53:33] without going to sleep now let me just
[53:35] let me just just move on just a moment
[53:37] here the scripture says on the
[53:39] outpouring of the holy ghost in joel 2.
[53:42] it speaks your old men shall dream
[53:44] dreams
[53:45] your young men shall see visions is that
[53:47] right
[53:48] that is of the whole body
[53:52] prophecy god encompasses remember the
[53:54] spirit of prophecy
[53:56] but what i'm speaking of is a prophet
[53:59] sent from god a person can see a vision
[54:03] but their conscience and subconscious
[54:05] does not lay together
[54:06] it that gift lays within that of a
[54:08] prophet are you with me
[54:10] i see her well i seen a vision no doubt
[54:13] there's people here
[54:14] myself others you know there are no
[54:15] doubt there may be things that god has
[54:17] shown to you
[54:17] but remember god has specially built
[54:20] this man in this way because it's not
[54:24] just visions of healing
[54:26] this has got to catch the vision of the
[54:28] word
[54:30] because without an open vision of the
[54:32] word the people perish
[54:35] there's got to be an open vision oh my
[54:38] so
[54:38] this man he's a little bit out of the
[54:40] way from the rest of him he's got a
[54:41] special commission
[54:42] remember how god likens his prophets to
[54:45] being eagles
[54:47] is that right i think we're
[54:50] a privilege in this time we see eagles i
[54:54] i i love it around our
[54:56] times i'm driving around and i see the
[54:59] eagles and there's an eagle that's kind
[55:01] of over by our house but it's it's
[55:02] nesting next to another church
[55:04] off of meister i want to tell it come on
[55:06] to my backyard
[55:09] i believe in i believe in eagles amen
[55:13] but nonetheless i'll i'll find myself
[55:16] just you know
[55:17] i'm walking down driving down the road
[55:19] or walking around i see it i'm looking
[55:21] for that white glimmer do i see that
[55:23] white glimmer off the head or the tail
[55:24] and
[55:25] and you start seeing now sometimes you
[55:26] can't see that but you know what i
[55:28] started looking for
[55:29] he was trying oh he's had an eagle and
[55:30] all of a sudden from a disc you see this
[55:34] it's not an eagle because it's getting
[55:36] up there and it's not it's
[55:37] it's not built for it but you catch an
[55:40] eagle
[55:41] and they just keep on soaring and
[55:43] soaring
[55:47] time my wife and i in the other house we
[55:49] were sitting on our
[55:50] our deck and i look we've seen the
[55:52] eagles and mines just sitting there and
[55:54] man you can't beat it i had coffee and
[55:56] eagles
[55:58] wonderful but here's what we noticed
[56:03] there was like four or five vultures
[56:06] that was moving in the air too so why in
[56:09] the world it seems like these vultures
[56:12] are chasing off these eagles but they
[56:16] weren't chasing them off the reason that
[56:17] happens is because the vultures
[56:19] start getting testy in a time of mating
[56:22] and so
[56:23] what happens is they start putting
[56:25] trying to put pressure on the eagles but
[56:26] you know what the eagles did
[56:28] they kept climbing
[56:31] they kept climbing and climbing and
[56:34] climbing
[56:34] they climbed past all the pressure
[56:40] they climbed into the realm they were
[56:45] [Applause]
[56:46] [Music]
[56:50] i say spread your wings
[56:52] [Music]
[56:54] pressure comes so higher pressure comes
[56:59] spread your wings there's a current to
[57:01] take you up higher
[57:03] there's an updraft not a downdraft god
[57:06] has sent a word in this hour knocked to
[57:08] ground
[57:09] and bind his people he sent a word
[57:12] to lift us up higher
[57:15] hallelujah lift us above sin
[57:18] lift us above doubt lift us above church
[57:21] lift us above unbelief
[57:23] he sent a word to lift us
[57:34] a prophet is a man whom the word of the
[57:37] lord comes to
[57:39] he foresees way off
[57:44] listen to me you say well what would be
[57:46] the value for seeing
[57:48] where things are far off
[57:51] is to let you know what is coming it's
[57:54] just if i
[57:54] just let's say listen let's bring it
[57:56] down to the spirit of prophecy
[57:58] what if the spirit of prophecy which he
[58:00] can do this he could come and say
[58:05] brother don't go on this roadway
[58:08] to work tomorrow there'll be a green
[58:11] truck
[58:12] and that green truck is going to cross
[58:14] over the median
[58:15] and it's going to come the wrong way
[58:18] take the other way to work
[58:20] and you might look and say what is that
[58:22] that's god preserving
[58:24] life now if a person looks at that and
[58:28] says
[58:31] and they go the same way they've been
[58:32] going
[58:34] they have forsaken mercy
[58:38] when god sends a prophet it is to catch
[58:42] the judgment that is coming on
[58:47] but within that message of judgment if
[58:50] our hearts can be so
[58:51] moved within that moment you find mercy
[58:55] aren't you glad mercy rewrote
[58:59] my life
[59:04] he sees the cup of god's wrath think of
[59:06] this
[59:07] you see god's wrath the prophet is
[59:10] caught up to see
[59:11] god's wrath already brother william the
[59:14] cup
[59:14] already filled can you imagine those
[59:16] that stood around
[59:18] when brother branham was speaking can
[59:19] you imagine how
[59:21] when brother branham would say in 1962
[59:23] this world's falling apart
[59:25] and say democracy has crumbled
[59:29] can you imagine what that would be
[59:31] thinking of at that time
[59:33] they're just looking at a little they're
[59:35] looking at things oh this will be
[59:37] corrected or this will come on board or
[59:38] this will do that god's not listening to
[59:41] me god's not
[59:42] trying to patch up this nation
[59:47] god's not trying to make this nation an
[59:49] overcomer
[59:52] this nation rejected god
[1:00:03] this is why brother bram said you can
[1:00:04] put an abraham lincoln and a george
[1:00:06] washington
[1:00:07] in every county
[1:00:10] it'll not turn it around why the
[1:00:14] people have rejected god
[1:00:18] and their hearts are hardened
[1:00:24] you're seeing a generation you see that
[1:00:27] movement that's going on right now
[1:00:29] they hate god
[1:00:35] i'm just going to say this very clearly
[1:00:37] to see message people and others get
[1:00:39] caught up in that nonsense
[1:00:41] shame on you i said shame on you
[1:00:45] you need a real awakening either you
[1:00:47] need a real birth
[1:00:48] of the holy ghost or you need to be
[1:00:51] shook back into your place
[1:00:55] you need to recognize what's going on
[1:01:01] there's only one thing that'll unite
[1:01:03] races and that's the holy ghost
[1:01:07] the holy ghost will make a tuxedo holder
[1:01:09] how to cover holes the holy ghost will
[1:01:11] make a black man reload a white man
[1:01:14] and vice versa
[1:01:17] they're trying to solve spiritual
[1:01:20] problems
[1:01:21] with the reasoning of man but they don't
[1:01:23] recognize
[1:01:24] they are influenced by demons
[1:01:29] but the influence of the holy ghost
[1:01:31] brings union
[1:01:32] with the nature of god
[1:01:38] they keep getting on these
[1:01:47] i tell you god's identifying i said
[1:01:49] god's identifying some things
[1:01:53] don't be upon in the devil's hand
[1:01:57] you give your all to god
[1:02:02] but this is who i am this is my
[1:02:03] nationality this is who i am this is why
[1:02:05] let god be the who i am inside of you
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:12] we don't glorify flesh we don't glorify
[1:02:14] ethnicity
[1:02:15] or nationality we glorify the god who
[1:02:18] brings forth
[1:02:19] out of every kindred nation and comes
[1:02:23] it's the holy ghost
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:30] i feel that spirit of god like it was
[1:02:32] upon amos
[1:02:35] let him know you you're going in a way
[1:02:38] of the world
[1:02:46] to be lifted up to see the oncoming
[1:02:50] judgment so prophets are signs
[1:02:55] of impending judgment
[1:02:59] listen to me let me just let me just
[1:03:01] work with this this thought here and
[1:03:02] we'll just
[1:03:04] they are signs listen signs of impending
[1:03:08] judgment god
[1:03:11] does not give a sign for
[1:03:14] nothing they don't send a prophet
[1:03:18] for nothing
[1:03:21] they are a sign they are a sign of
[1:03:24] impending judgment
[1:03:26] and they rise on the scene with a
[1:03:29] message of grace
[1:03:32] who desired to escape the coming
[1:03:34] judgment because let me tell you
[1:03:36] something
[1:03:36] he cares do you
[1:03:40] the remnant cares god's care
[1:03:45] is made known in sending his word
[1:03:48] look at this ezekiel 24 24
[1:03:52] also maybe another message to write down
[1:03:54] true sign overlooked
[1:03:59] testimony of a true witness there i gave
[1:04:01] you four messages
[1:04:05] oh brother this time what we've been
[1:04:06] doing having a good old time
[1:04:09] ezekiel 24 24 that's ezekiel
[1:04:12] notice is unto you a sign
[1:04:17] now remember ezekiel was not a prophet
[1:04:21] prior to the jews going into babylon
[1:04:25] god had promised he'll bring them back
[1:04:28] into israel
[1:04:31] but god sent ezekiel there
[1:04:34] so that ezekiel could speak to them
[1:04:37] point
[1:04:37] out to them this is why you're in the
[1:04:39] condition you're in
[1:04:41] god would allow him to display signs
[1:04:45] laying on his side for so long then he
[1:04:47] would tell ezekiel
[1:04:48] go and in front of the elders dig
[1:04:51] through a hole
[1:04:52] and out of that hole bring four things
[1:04:54] right in their midst
[1:04:55] it'll be assigned to them a prophet was
[1:04:57] doing things as a
[1:04:59] sign who is god's letting him know
[1:05:02] there's things that's been taken right
[1:05:03] from you you allowed by your
[1:05:05] carelessness
[1:05:06] for things to be taken from under your
[1:05:08] nose
[1:05:10] that's why brother brahm said he will
[1:05:11] not be and this was the founding father
[1:05:13] brother bam picks it up you know as he
[1:05:14] he mentions he says it's not the worm
[1:05:16] out here that destroys it it's the worm
[1:05:18] and the core
[1:05:19] our founding father says it will not be
[1:05:21] another nation destroy us we will be we
[1:05:23] will be destroyed from within
[1:05:25] this is what our founding father let me
[1:05:27] tell you something these founding
[1:05:28] fathers were men of vision
[1:05:32] they were men of vision my goodness let
[1:05:35] me get on this
[1:05:39] it's like public school why why do we
[1:05:41] have public school
[1:05:43] do you realize why school came into
[1:05:44] being well we want to make them smart
[1:05:46] that was not the reason for public
[1:05:47] education public education was so that
[1:05:51] children might learn how to read so they
[1:05:54] could read the bible
[1:05:57] that's not my words you can look that up
[1:05:59] if you can still find it
[1:06:04] why because our founders believed if
[1:06:07] people would avail themselves
[1:06:09] in the word of god that they wouldn't
[1:06:11] have to fully rely on the police it
[1:06:13] wouldn't be funding it's saying they
[1:06:14] just weren't going to have to rely
[1:06:21] the spirit of lawlessness ezekiel is
[1:06:25] unto you a sign
[1:06:26] according to all he hath done shall ye
[1:06:28] do and when this cometh you shall know
[1:06:30] that i am the lord god
[1:06:36] look what brother brahman says here no
[1:06:37] greater than solomon is here
[1:06:39] god through all ages
[1:06:42] has sent gifts
[1:06:46] and recognitions and signs to the people
[1:06:50] yeah he says every time you see prophets
[1:06:53] have always been signs every time you
[1:06:54] see a prophet rise
[1:06:56] you better be careful judgments on its
[1:06:59] road
[1:07:01] look at noah look at moses look at
[1:07:03] jeremiah
[1:07:05] before going into babylon look at john
[1:07:07] the baptist before the rejection of
[1:07:09] israel
[1:07:09] all along prophets are signs and the
[1:07:12] jews were commanded to believe these
[1:07:13] prophets
[1:07:14] and when they come forth with this
[1:07:15] message god through all ages was telling
[1:07:18] this wicked generation what they had
[1:07:19] done
[1:07:20] think of with abraham let me just
[1:07:23] let me just uh give just a few of these
[1:07:27] examples here
[1:07:28] abraham god calls abraham
[1:07:31] my prophet is that right
[1:07:36] abraham god had spoke to him called him
[1:07:39] out
[1:07:39] god comes down and takes upon a body of
[1:07:43] flesh
[1:07:44] to reveal himself
[1:07:47] to abraham personally and dissolve
[1:07:51] the doubts that are in sarah's
[1:07:54] heart
[1:07:59] that was prophetic
[1:08:04] when was that before after god does that
[1:08:06] he comes along
[1:08:07] abraham follows him he says shall i hide
[1:08:11] from abraham that which i am about to do
[1:08:18] seeing that he shall command his
[1:08:20] household after him
[1:08:23] see judgment was coming upon sodom but
[1:08:25] there was going to be a continuation of
[1:08:27] the seed line
[1:08:32] sodom didn't know judgment was coming
[1:08:34] but abraham did
[1:08:36] abraham received a message
[1:08:40] abraham was not in sodom he was outside
[1:08:43] of sodom
[1:08:46] he was not locked up in a denomination
[1:08:49] he was outside
[1:08:53] are you with me oh sodom looked like a
[1:08:56] really good place
[1:08:57] you know it looked like
[1:09:00] the garden of god come on now this is
[1:09:03] where lot went it looked
[1:09:04] like we don't want something that looks
[1:09:07] like we want he
[1:09:08] that is i don't want something that's
[1:09:12] like
[1:09:12] i won't see that ears
[1:09:20] what about noah
[1:09:23] this was before abraham god is getting
[1:09:26] ready
[1:09:27] to bring judgment upon the earth
[1:09:31] he said the wickedness of man not just
[1:09:34] his actions
[1:09:35] his thinking all together
[1:09:38] dwelling on wickedness
[1:09:43] and the earth was filled this is the
[1:09:45] bible filled
[1:09:46] with violence through them
[1:09:49] there were people who on earth could be
[1:09:52] inspired
[1:09:53] with demons for violence
[1:09:56] but god had a man on earth who is in
[1:09:58] contact with him
[1:10:00] that god could reveal righteousness
[1:10:03] to him and through him
[1:10:09] no so you're building a boat tell me
[1:10:12] what harbor you're building it in
[1:10:14] or not matter of fact i'm building 100
[1:10:17] 900 miles away
[1:10:18] hundreds of miles away from the nearest
[1:10:19] place of water
[1:10:21] what anybody knows you build a boat in a
[1:10:24] shipyard
[1:10:26] come on there were a lot of other boats
[1:10:27] being built in that hour
[1:10:30] are you with me there were other boats
[1:10:32] being built but there was only one
[1:10:34] that would withstand the oncoming
[1:10:36] judgment
[1:10:41] one man i received from god
[1:10:44] this is what the bible let me just read
[1:10:46] this the bible says by faith
[1:10:48] noah being warned of god of things
[1:10:51] not seen as yet
[1:10:56] amen what was that you said noah
[1:10:59] re ring
[1:11:03] rain how do you pronounce that
[1:11:08] rain r a
[1:11:13] never heard of that it's not in your
[1:11:15] dictionaries
[1:11:17] it's not in your books but god
[1:11:20] has let me know he's going to send rings
[1:11:29] he's going to wash away this wickedness
[1:11:35] but noah by god's grace
[1:11:38] it's revealed to him and noah a prophet
[1:11:41] of god
[1:11:42] he foresees the judgment coming he's
[1:11:44] it's coming rain
[1:11:45] it's coming right but there was elect
[1:11:48] that heard
[1:11:49] there's a preparation there's a
[1:11:51] preparation for you
[1:11:52] there's a preparation for you there were
[1:11:54] others who heard ah this doom and gloom
[1:11:56] message
[1:11:56] it's all doom and gloom but there are
[1:11:58] others who said your life
[1:12:00] you want to come receive life you want
[1:12:02] to receive life you want to receive
[1:12:03] difference the rest of them said oh this
[1:12:05] is this and this is that but the
[1:12:07] restroom said
[1:12:08] their safety their safety their safety
[1:12:11] their safety what are you listening at
[1:12:14] ah just depends on if you've got an ear
[1:12:17] to heal
[1:12:24] he moved with fear he prepared an ark
[1:12:27] for the saving
[1:12:28] of his house think of this isaiah
[1:12:31] jeremiah amos we could go on
[1:12:35] because amos and the rest of the
[1:12:36] contemporaries even picked up
[1:12:38] in those times where i have isaiah you
[1:12:40] have jeremiah
[1:12:42] they don't they don't deviate from one
[1:12:43] another it's a con it's a continual
[1:12:46] unfolding within that same prophecy
[1:12:49] that because you have rejected god
[1:12:51] there's a nation
[1:12:52] coming to take you over that's what they
[1:12:56] prophesy
[1:12:57] you know what israel thought we're of
[1:13:00] god
[1:13:02] we're founded on god abraham is our
[1:13:05] father
[1:13:06] sarah is our mother we are a christian
[1:13:09] nation
[1:13:10] we have laws and judgments and jeremiah
[1:13:13] and isaiah and o'er said
[1:13:15] you have the written word but your heart
[1:13:19] is far from god you don't have the right
[1:13:23] interpretation
[1:13:25] why because the right interpretation it
[1:13:27] brings
[1:13:28] deliverance it brings a reflection of
[1:13:32] what the written word is it becomes
[1:13:35] expressed
[1:13:39] it's very it's very much where we're at
[1:13:41] right now
[1:13:43] or we're a christian nation or where
[1:13:45] this or that
[1:13:46] no no no it's a god rejecting nation
[1:13:49] they've rejected the outpouring of the
[1:13:51] holy ghost
[1:13:56] are you with me this is why brother
[1:13:58] brahma says i don't pray
[1:13:59] for america anymore what was he talking
[1:14:01] about i'm not praying for a revival
[1:14:04] right you catch these these individuals
[1:14:06] oh we pray for revival
[1:14:08] oh god turn america around oh and we
[1:14:11] gather and we'll recite
[1:14:12] you know the scripture of course of
[1:14:14] chronicles if my people which are called
[1:14:16] by my name
[1:14:17] will humble themselves and they'll
[1:14:19] humble themselves as not praying in
[1:14:20] front of a tv camera
[1:14:23] preach brother simon i will
[1:14:27] first of all the name of the lord has
[1:14:29] got to be preached to you
[1:14:33] and the name of the lord is not an idea
[1:14:36] of man
[1:14:37] it is the lord himself and then that
[1:14:41] word is made manifest
[1:14:42] then you humble yourself to him
[1:14:46] and call on him
[1:14:52] it's not a promise for god to heal this
[1:14:54] land but god has healed this
[1:14:56] land
[1:14:56] [Music]
[1:15:00] and like jeremiah could step in the
[1:15:02] midst of the prophecy
[1:15:03] and god would inspire him and say tell
[1:15:06] them
[1:15:07] to speak to their seed that the seed as
[1:15:10] they will show that word
[1:15:11] that the seed will come back into this
[1:15:14] land
[1:15:15] that's what god has sent in this hour
[1:15:17] it's no turning her around but god has
[1:15:19] sent
[1:15:20] a word a message that is showing a
[1:15:22] people
[1:15:23] it's so the people for the millennium
[1:15:26] our people for the future home it is so
[1:15:29] the people
[1:15:30] and to the lord
[1:15:35] hallelujah glory be to god
[1:15:38] oh blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:42] think about paul in the time
[1:15:46] of the gospel when the jew to the jews
[1:15:48] was ending remember they rejected the
[1:15:50] messiah
[1:15:51] but god gave a space of grace after they
[1:15:53] rejected him and crucified him
[1:15:55] is that right who crucified him his own
[1:15:58] people
[1:16:01] catholicism they crucified him but god
[1:16:04] gave grace there was a remnant
[1:16:08] that had to be sealed before judgment
[1:16:11] could come
[1:16:17] the same way reason god stopped world
[1:16:20] war
[1:16:21] one you would have wiped it out but he
[1:16:24] said
[1:16:24] hold back the four winds until i have
[1:16:28] sealed my servants
[1:16:30] you see it's not only the sealing away
[1:16:32] of the gentile bride but god has to seal
[1:16:34] the 144 000.
[1:16:37] god said stop
[1:16:40] not doing with it just stop for right
[1:16:43] now god says
[1:16:44] hope right now we're under his care
[1:16:48] the enemy can only make certain advances
[1:16:50] as god allows him and then god says stop
[1:16:53] that's far
[1:16:54] enough
[1:16:58] oh my
[1:17:02] after that rejection of the messiah he
[1:17:03] turned to the gentiles
[1:17:07] but god moving in such a precious way
[1:17:12] see the bible says in amos 3 6 shall a
[1:17:15] trumpet
[1:17:16] be blown in the city and the people not
[1:17:17] be afraid shall there be evil in the
[1:17:20] city and the lord hath not done it
[1:17:22] see god when people refuse mercy
[1:17:25] judgment's come
[1:17:26] coming already
[1:17:30] but god gives mercy
[1:17:34] prior to judgment
[1:17:37] he cares do you care
[1:17:41] surely the lord god will do nothing but
[1:17:44] he revealeth his secret unto his
[1:17:45] servants the prophets
[1:17:46] the lion hath roared who will not fear
[1:17:50] the lord god hath spoken who can but
[1:17:54] prophesy
[1:17:56] i want you just to think of this
[1:17:59] iran says it like this i'm coming down
[1:18:01] here
[1:18:02] moses was a prophet just look at this
[1:18:06] that was god's sign to israel remember
[1:18:09] god said
[1:18:10] about the two signs and there would be a
[1:18:11] voice follow that sign
[1:18:13] they had been 400 years in bondage and
[1:18:16] god
[1:18:17] prepared a sign for them just before
[1:18:20] deliverance
[1:18:22] how did god prepare the sign for them
[1:18:25] you say moses was already born to be the
[1:18:27] deliverer
[1:18:28] that's true god already had it laying
[1:18:30] there in his life
[1:18:31] he was already ordained to be the
[1:18:34] deliverer
[1:18:35] his mom had whispered to him this is
[1:18:37] right this is the truth
[1:18:39] this is all right this is the truth this
[1:18:41] is the message of the hour
[1:18:42] this is the prophet of god she had
[1:18:43] whispered that to him
[1:18:46] but you see god when god sends a sign
[1:18:49] god prepares the sign
[1:18:52] so god called him away when he would
[1:18:55] finally
[1:18:55] lost all hope of himself and god said
[1:19:00] now he's in the right place
[1:19:05] he calls him up there and god makes
[1:19:07] himself
[1:19:08] known to moses and god steps inside
[1:19:12] of moses and he goes back down to egypt
[1:19:16] what did god do he prepared a delivering
[1:19:20] sign
[1:19:22] do you realize in your life christ in
[1:19:24] you the hope of glory
[1:19:26] is a delivering sign we have been
[1:19:29] delivered from this present darkness
[1:19:35] and translated into the kingdom
[1:19:38] of his dear son amen
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:46] some of you probably think he's caught
[1:19:48] up he keeps on saying a few more minutes
[1:19:54] he was a sign of deliverance to israel
[1:19:56] now look at this
[1:19:58] and a sign of judgment to egypt
[1:20:02] well which one is he depends on who you
[1:20:04] are
[1:20:06] to want his judgment to another
[1:20:10] is deliverance
[1:20:13] to one he's to announce him coming is
[1:20:16] announcing
[1:20:17] this nation is finished
[1:20:20] it's a national sign
[1:20:24] this is a scripture this is also the
[1:20:26] words of the prophet
[1:20:27] moses coming was a national sign to
[1:20:30] egypt
[1:20:30] your days of power are finished
[1:20:33] let me just tell you it runs much deeper
[1:20:35] than the united states it is announcing
[1:20:38] to the prince and pound the air
[1:20:40] he was already reminded when they're on
[1:20:42] calvary
[1:20:43] he lost the battle and the mighty
[1:20:45] conqueror
[1:20:46] he arose from the grave and now he has
[1:20:48] come back
[1:20:49] in the promise of his word it veiled in
[1:20:52] a people
[1:20:53] in this last days it's announcing
[1:20:56] satan your kingdom is finished
[1:21:02] it's a delivering sign
[1:21:05] this message in you in me
[1:21:09] is a delivering sign
[1:21:15] trying to have to preach how to run a
[1:21:16] little bit
[1:21:26] noah was a sign of deliverance to his
[1:21:29] people
[1:21:30] and a sign of judgment to the lost world
[1:21:32] and the unbeliever
[1:21:33] the very waters that choked the world
[1:21:36] and drowned the world
[1:21:38] was the only means of saving noah the
[1:21:40] only thing that could save him was the
[1:21:42] judgment
[1:21:42] and the only thing that will save the
[1:21:44] church today is the judgment
[1:21:46] you're talking about the judgment
[1:21:47] judgment must begin at the house of god
[1:21:50] it's through the preaching of the word
[1:21:51] that the judgment that which you're
[1:21:53] walking under
[1:21:54] walking under sin and walking unbelief
[1:21:56] but in the house of god
[1:21:57] there's judgment that can come to the
[1:21:59] house of god that can separate you
[1:22:02] and lift that judgment and lift you
[1:22:05] into a place as a son and daughter of
[1:22:07] god
[1:22:08] what does that the word there's only one
[1:22:10] thing that can separate you from you
[1:22:12] and tell you who you really are and that
[1:22:14] is the word
[1:22:15] [Applause]
[1:22:21] let's stand
[1:22:26] now preach a little bit more
[1:22:31] noah a delivering sign
[1:22:35] the same waters
[1:22:39] that drowned the rest of them
[1:22:43] noah and those of his house
[1:22:49] floated right along on the waters of
[1:22:51] judgment
[1:22:53] the ark was a place of safety
[1:22:57] a place of safety
[1:23:00] think about john remember we're talking
[1:23:03] about signs of impending judgment
[1:23:06] think about john lebron would say it
[1:23:08] like this he said for 400 years
[1:23:11] god never sent a prophet he said what
[1:23:15] was god doing why did god wait
[1:23:18] so long to send a prophet
[1:23:24] he said because he wanted it to be so
[1:23:26] outstanding to the people
[1:23:29] that god had it so set in his word it
[1:23:32] would be 400 years
[1:23:34] and then he would send john it would be
[1:23:36] so outstanding
[1:23:37] look even the pharisees and those were
[1:23:40] going out there
[1:23:41] sending who are you
[1:23:46] listen to me
[1:23:49] not one of these john identified himself
[1:23:52] in the scripture
[1:23:55] but john nor moses no jeremiah nor
[1:23:58] ezekiel
[1:23:59] nor any of the rest of him came to the
[1:24:01] people and said
[1:24:02] i'm a prophet you know i'm i'm your
[1:24:04] prophet i mean
[1:24:05] no that's something listen to me
[1:24:09] brother says the prophet knows who he is
[1:24:13] and when he comes with that word the
[1:24:16] people
[1:24:17] recognize who he is
[1:24:21] this is why you could think who in the
[1:24:23] right mind
[1:24:24] who could not see this or who
[1:24:27] and let me just say if you haven't seen
[1:24:29] it if i hadn't recognized
[1:24:32] ask god to reveal ask god say lord
[1:24:35] reveal yourself to me because you
[1:24:38] recognize there's something you
[1:24:39] recognize as different this is not just
[1:24:41] coming to church not just well let me
[1:24:44] find a church to be a part of this is
[1:24:45] not that
[1:24:46] that's that's that's like a social club
[1:24:49] it's not trying to be part of a church
[1:24:51] why i want to be part of a group of
[1:24:53] people it's not being part of a group of
[1:24:55] people
[1:24:57] is to get into christ god's desire is
[1:25:00] that we would come into
[1:25:02] him he made a way that we can come into
[1:25:10] him
[1:25:12] why 400 years because god wanted that
[1:25:15] prophet to stand up
[1:25:16] think now brother brahman said many
[1:25:19] times to get your spiritual caps on
[1:25:22] why did god wait almost 2 000 years
[1:25:29] because it's promised in his word
[1:25:32] john would come the god prophet
[1:25:36] of deuteronomy 18 would rise up
[1:25:39] and the spirit of truth the lord god
[1:25:43] who would reveal himself in the god
[1:25:46] prophet i'm talking about the lord jesus
[1:25:48] he would come back in the church
[1:25:51] as the testimony of jesus christ the
[1:25:53] spirit of prophecy
[1:25:54] as the holy ghost the spirit of truth
[1:25:59] and he would move down through the
[1:26:01] church ages
[1:26:03] age after age after age has went
[1:26:07] there have been men of god that god
[1:26:09] raised up
[1:26:11] but in this hour it's time for rapture
[1:26:18] and god fulfills his word that he spoke
[1:26:23] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:26:25] curse
[1:26:27] before that i send unto you elijah the
[1:26:30] prophet
[1:26:32] not the man physically elijah but the
[1:26:34] spirit
[1:26:35] the characteristic what did the spirit
[1:26:38] of christ do through elijah
[1:26:40] where the people were worshiping bowel
[1:26:43] and
[1:26:43] going according to all these things
[1:26:46] elijah had the word of god
[1:26:48] and said come to mount carmel
[1:26:52] they had tore down the altar of god no
[1:26:56] wonder they had to have programs in
[1:26:57] their church
[1:26:58] trying to rehabilitate trying to reform
[1:27:01] people
[1:27:01] the wonder programs of psychology
[1:27:05] why the altar of the lord needed to be
[1:27:08] repaired
[1:27:11] god's not here to change our thinking
[1:27:13] he's here to turn our hearts
[1:27:21] so elijah directed by the word of god
[1:27:24] he comes upon that mountain
[1:27:30] hallelujah he takes this stone
[1:27:33] that loose in that new sin this stone
[1:27:38] he brings it together according to what
[1:27:41] the vision of the word
[1:27:45] god has already showed him remember the
[1:27:47] scripture said i have done
[1:27:48] all of this according to thy word
[1:27:53] this was not elijah walking around
[1:27:55] something's got to be done by the people
[1:27:57] or something's got to be done i don't
[1:27:59] know what's going on something's got to
[1:28:00] be done
[1:28:01] no no this was god
[1:28:04] god seen the need elijah
[1:28:08] was waiting on the lord
[1:28:14] wait on the lord
[1:28:18] you got a need in your life wait on the
[1:28:20] lord
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:25] after everything went by the evening
[1:28:28] time came
[1:28:30] and when the sacrifice was laid upon the
[1:28:32] wood
[1:28:33] elijah told him go get 12 barrels of
[1:28:35] water
[1:28:38] i want you to soak this thing and
[1:28:39] there's going to be water run off on a
[1:28:41] trench
[1:28:42] is to let you see this ain't an
[1:28:43] artificial fire
[1:28:46] as a matter of fact what he did would
[1:28:48] make it impossible
[1:28:51] for fire to ignite what was wet
[1:28:56] but the supernatural god our god is a
[1:28:59] consuming fire
[1:29:02] hallelujah he came on the scene
[1:29:05] a prophet was standing there with the
[1:29:08] word
[1:29:08] and when he spoke that word elijah
[1:29:11] couldn't do it
[1:29:12] but he could stand on that word and god
[1:29:15] said
[1:29:15] i'm coming on the scene
[1:29:19] that word following in obedience to the
[1:29:21] word brought the fire
[1:29:23] obedience to the word grants you the
[1:29:25] token
[1:29:27] obedience to the word invites the fire
[1:29:29] of the word to come down
[1:29:31] it invites god to come into your life
[1:29:41] oh god oh god be merciful
[1:29:45] i tell you tonight if you're here and
[1:29:47] you don't have the holy ghost
[1:29:48] if you're listening to me on the
[1:29:49] internet or you'll stream this service
[1:29:51] i'm saying if you don't if you haven't
[1:29:52] surrendered your heart
[1:29:53] this is a time
[1:29:58] this is a time to say god i cast down my
[1:30:01] mind
[1:30:04] take me lord
[1:30:07] the sign of impending judgment do you
[1:30:10] recognize
[1:30:11] the bible says in ii peter that the
[1:30:14] spirit of the last days will come
[1:30:18] scoffers
[1:30:20] oh how long's this message been preached
[1:30:23] when was it you said brother branham
[1:30:25] passed off the scene
[1:30:27] brother branham went home to be with the
[1:30:28] lord at the end of 65
[1:30:31] but the angel of the lord never left
[1:30:34] [Music]
[1:30:38] scoffers shall arise in the last days
[1:30:40] and say
[1:30:41] oh all things continue on just like they
[1:30:43] were
[1:30:44] but they're willfully ignorant
[1:30:51] they go on no way that's just continuing
[1:30:54] on you need to get your eyes opened
[1:30:56] i say this with love in my heart there's
[1:30:58] an impending judgment
[1:31:02] this is more than just teaching on
[1:31:04] prophets the way god has brought this to
[1:31:06] show you and i
[1:31:07] we're not walking around blindly we're
[1:31:10] walking around
[1:31:11] our eyes have been open cause we're not
[1:31:13] seeing it through the eyes of a man
[1:31:17] we're not worshiping god through the
[1:31:18] eyes of a man when somebody handed you
[1:31:21] glasses
[1:31:21] and you're looking through their glasses
[1:31:23] but god has anointed your eyes
[1:31:27] without have
[1:31:30] that you might see
[1:31:34] when judgment was upon jericho
[1:31:38] rahab said she caught those two men
[1:31:44] she said come with me
[1:31:47] the rest of the people in the city
[1:31:49] didn't think nothing different about it
[1:31:51] oh that's just ray happened but there
[1:31:54] was a different
[1:31:55] there was different motives there was
[1:31:57] different reasons she called those men
[1:31:59] she said
[1:32:00] come into my house you know why
[1:32:03] she wanted to hear what they had to say
[1:32:05] she wanted to let them know
[1:32:06] i know who you're identified with the
[1:32:09] god
[1:32:10] that has sent you here to spy out this
[1:32:12] city
[1:32:13] that judgment is coming think of the
[1:32:15] paradox i don't know if it strikes you
[1:32:17] like this
[1:32:18] but to think the paradox how then in the
[1:32:20] midst of the time
[1:32:21] shireya wasn't walking around who were
[1:32:23] all doomed
[1:32:24] oh we're all doomed we're all going to
[1:32:26] be destroyed no
[1:32:27] there was something in her heart she
[1:32:29] recognized that sign
[1:32:31] she said give me a true token i want a
[1:32:34] real
[1:32:34] peace in my heart i want a real comfort
[1:32:37] i want to know that i know
[1:32:41] that i know that i know
[1:32:42] [Applause]
[1:32:45] what was that that was a seed of god
[1:32:48] that was being awakened
[1:32:52] the sign was right among them
[1:32:59] let's say god be merciful
[1:33:03] dear jesus
[1:33:07] lord
[1:33:10] my heart is trembling lord
[1:33:15] and yet lord i'm so thankful
[1:33:20] but yet lord the trembling of it
[1:33:24] your god there's loved ones
[1:33:29] lord loved ones are mine there's
[1:33:31] brothers and sisters lord there's good
[1:33:34] people good people
[1:33:38] the lord they need the holy ghost
[1:33:43] they need the true token like lord god
[1:33:47] like you took
[1:33:48] and brought in the simplicity through
[1:33:49] brother jerry the love of god
[1:33:52] in their heart where it's not keeping
[1:33:55] and trying to keep things
[1:33:57] and walk unto the power of two masters
[1:33:59] you can't
[1:34:02] the lord i pray tonight
[1:34:06] may you just lord for those lives and
[1:34:08] those hearts
[1:34:09] move for each one lord according to
[1:34:11] their need

[1:34:39] what i'm praying for
[1:34:42] i'm asking god for your mercy
[1:34:47] like abraham when he could see the
[1:34:49] judgment
[1:34:50] he asked for mercy
[1:34:53] god i pray from the hearts whether
[1:34:56] they're here
[1:34:57] whether they're streaming may they flee
[1:35:00] to the ark of safety
[1:35:05] may they run to you lord
[1:35:08] i pray dear lord jesus
[1:35:11] may you continue lord to reveal yourself
[1:35:15] to us lord
[1:35:18] oh how we thank you for your mercy
[1:35:21] we we feel like ruth

[1:35:28] in your eyes
[1:35:31] oh god what mercy
[1:35:35] what grace lord may there not be one
[1:35:40] the lord would be outside of this heart
[1:35:43] of safety
[1:35:45] but may god if there's hearts that are
[1:35:47] outside of it may they be so
[1:35:50] moved lord and may they flee may they
[1:35:52] flee to you
[1:35:54] may they recognize lord it's you calling
[1:35:58] may they run to you lord for in you
