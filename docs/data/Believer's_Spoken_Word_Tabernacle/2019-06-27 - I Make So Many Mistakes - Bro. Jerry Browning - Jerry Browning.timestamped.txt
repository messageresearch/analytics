[29:32] let's go to the Lord in prayer before we
[29:34] turn to the scripture tonight
[29:37] or not father for my benefit Lord but
[29:42] for that the people may benefit from
[29:45] your word your lord I pray dear God that
[29:48] you will direct me now Lord through this
[29:52] sermon that you've laid on my heart your
[29:54] God that I would be able to yield to you
[29:57] that you may speak to the people and be
[29:59] a help
[30:00] encouragement to them we ask this in the
[30:04] name of the Lord Jesus Christ into the
[30:06] glory of God amen
[30:09] turn with me in your Bibles if you would
[30:11] to Genesis chapter 16 I want to read
[30:14] verses 1 through 5
[30:19] what I'd like to title this tonight is I
[30:22] make so many mistakes
[30:32] just as 16 verse one now
[30:37] sarah abraham's wife bear him no
[30:40] children and she had a handmaid an
[30:44] Egyptian whose name was Hagar and Sarah
[30:47] said unto Abram
[30:50] behold now the LORD hath restrained me
[30:52] from bearing I pray thee go in unto my
[30:55] maid it may be that I may obtain
[30:58] children by her and Abram hearkened to
[31:00] the voice of Sarah Sarah Abraham's
[31:04] Abraham's wife took
[31:06] Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abe
[31:10] Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of
[31:13] Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram
[31:15] to be his wife and he went in unto Hagar
[31:19] and she conceived and when she saw that
[31:21] she had conceived her mistress was
[31:23] despised in her eyes and Sarah I said
[31:26] unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee I
[31:29] have given my maid in thy bosom and when
[31:32] she saw that she had conceived I was
[31:34] despised in her eyes the Lord judge
[31:37] between me and thee
[31:38] may be seated
[31:44] we consider Abraham to be the father of
[31:48] faith and that's what the Scriptures
[31:51] tells us that he is and
[31:54] the Scriptures refers to us as Abraham's
[31:58] children
[32:01] but as we look at Abraham's life I
[32:04] believe Abraham could stand and say I
[32:07] make so many mistakes
[32:11] here God had told him he was going to
[32:15] have a son
[32:17] and
[32:18] Sara begin to doubt how it could be by
[32:22] her and it caused Abraham to doubt and
[32:28] Sarah come up with this ideal this great
[32:32] human
[32:34] carnal ideal
[32:37] and said I know how we can get this done
[32:41] you
[32:42] go in into my handmaid she'll have a
[32:46] child and that'll be my child and this
[32:51] is the way we're going to bring to past
[32:52] God's promise
[32:55] first of all God doesn't need your help
[32:58] to bring about his promises
[33:00] he doesn't need my help to keep his
[33:03] promises
[33:04] God doesn't need my help to protect his
[33:07] word
[33:09] God doesn't need any man's help to
[33:12] protect his word his word will remain
[33:15] true
[33:16] there is always going to be a people
[33:20] that are in the middle of the road
[33:23] there may be those that are on the
[33:25] left-hand and those are on the right may
[33:27] be some that
[33:29] put too much but more focus on brother
[33:32] Branham than they do Jesus Christ then
[33:35] there's others on the other side that
[33:36] there's they're saying well there's
[33:38] nothing to it and they're leaving the
[33:39] message but there's always going to be a
[33:42] people that stays right there in the
[33:44] middle of the road believing the truth
[33:50] now as we find as time went on that God
[33:55] comes and tells Abraham
[33:58] that he's going to give a son
[34:02] to him by Sarah
[34:05] and he changes her name from Sarah into
[34:08] Sarah and
[34:11] he
[34:14] Abraham laughs
[34:16] in his heart
[34:19] same very thing that
[34:21] Sarah was guilty of a little while later
[34:25] Abraham laughed and said me and old man
[34:29] and Sarah as old as she is we're gonna
[34:32] have a child and then he says we had an
[34:38] ideal God and
[34:41] what we did was I had a child another
[34:45] child I had a child by Sarah's
[34:48] handmaiden
[34:49] he said all that Ishmael might live
[34:52] before thee
[34:54] but God wouldn't accept in that because
[34:57] that wasn't in line with his plan that
[35:00] wasn't in line with his promise
[35:03] it would be a substitution and God
[35:07] doesn't need any substitutions
[35:10] and
[35:12] so God doesn't know you and Sarah are
[35:16] gonna have a son
[35:19] then we find out
[35:21] sometime later that Sarah does conceive
[35:26] and she has a son
[35:29] but then
[35:31] Ishmael who's about 13 14 years old
[35:35] begins to mock the child and so Sarah
[35:39] says you know that idea we had Abraham
[35:42] scratch that
[35:45] you need to kick that bondwoman and her
[35:48] son out because her son's not going to
[35:50] be heir with my son
[35:52] now
[35:54] Abraham and Sarah's mistake
[35:57] has cost the world ever since
[36:04] the in the Bible the angel told Hagar
[36:09] that
[36:10] he was going to be a wild man
[36:13] he would never settle down and
[36:17] he would be against every man and every
[36:20] man would be against him
[36:22] and it's still that way today
[36:31] Abraham and Sarah
[36:34] before
[36:36] Isaac was born
[36:40] they
[36:41] went on it was on a journey and they
[36:45] came through this kingdom where
[36:48] Abimelech was king and
[36:52] Abraham had told Sarah when they first
[36:55] started out traveling when they left the
[36:58] land of the Chaldeans he said look
[37:01] you're my half-sister
[37:03] you're the sister of my father you're my
[37:07] father's daughter but not my mother's so
[37:10] you're my half-sister so anytime we come
[37:12] someplace and they asked who you are
[37:15] just telling me or my sister
[37:17] now Abraham did this out of his flesh he
[37:20] did it out of fear he
[37:22] did it because he was a human and had
[37:25] fear
[37:26] and as time went on
[37:30] they came through this Kingdom and the
[37:34] King looked on Sarah and saw that she
[37:37] was fair and he wanted her for wife
[37:40] Negra ham being fearful was gonna let
[37:43] him take her
[37:48] they took Sarah was getting her all
[37:50] prepared up to marry
[37:53] and then the Lord appeared to BEM elec
[37:55] in a dream and he said don't do it
[37:59] you've got a man's wife
[38:02] and Abimelech said did not he tell me
[38:06] that was his sister and did not she say
[38:10] that was her brother if I've done
[38:11] anything I've done it out of ignorance
[38:15] and
[38:16] he didn't want God to hold it against
[38:19] him God said don't touch her then
[38:22] and said not only that but restore to
[38:26] her husband and said I'm going to cause
[38:29] every woman in your land to be barren
[38:32] and I'm going to cause you to be sick
[38:34] and unless you get him to pray for you
[38:37] that he's my prophet and unless you get
[38:41] him to pray for you you're not going to
[38:42] get any better
[38:44] and that's something
[38:48] Abraham made so many mistakes
[38:52] here he was guilty of lying
[38:54] he's been guilty of
[38:57] doubting he was guilty of unbelief
[39:01] he was guilty at laughing at God
[39:06] and yet Abraham didn't do any of these
[39:10] things to be a bad person
[39:17] but it was God in His grace
[39:23] that Abraham through all his mistakes
[39:26] God was still with it and God still
[39:30] heard his prayer when he prayed for the
[39:33] King Abimelech and
[39:34] when God heard his prayer then he opened
[39:37] the wounds of the women and He healed
[39:41] Abimelech and told him been Electress
[39:44] toward the man his wife and send him on
[39:46] their way
[39:50] you'd think that the son could have
[39:53] learned from the father's mistake later
[39:56] on Isaac was guilty of the same thing I
[40:01] think about this when it was laid on my
[40:04] heart and I to be honest with you I come
[40:08] up with this title because I feel like I
[40:10] make so many mistakes
[40:13] and I seen in the scripture where
[40:16] Abraham made one mistake after another
[40:21] and
[40:26] but when Romans when Paul wrote roamed
[40:29] the book of Romans and I want to go to
[40:31] chapter 4 verse 16 through 20
[40:41] Paul didn't mention any of these things
[40:48] romans 4
[40:52] verse 16 therefore it is of faith that
[40:56] it might be by grace to the end the
[40:59] promise might be sure to all the seed
[41:03] not to that only which is of the law but
[41:07] to that also which is of the faith of
[41:10] Abraham who is the father of us all as
[41:13] it is written I have made the father of
[41:16] many nations before him whom he believed
[41:20] even God who quickeneth the dead and
[41:23] calleth those things which are not as
[41:26] though they were
[41:27] who against hope believed in hope that
[41:30] he might become the father of many
[41:33] nations according to that which was
[41:35] spoken so shall thy seed be
[41:38] and be not weak in the faith he
[41:41] considered not his own body now dead
[41:44] when he was about a hundred years old
[41:47] neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb
[41:49] he staggered not at the promise of God
[41:52] through unbelief but was strong in the
[41:54] faith giving glory to God
[41:59] this is what God thought of Abraham
[42:05] I'll quote three more scriptures for you
[42:08] Galatians three and six it says even as
[42:10] abraham believed god it was accounted to
[42:13] him for righteousness
[42:15] Galatians three and nine said so then
[42:18] they which be of the faith are blessed
[42:21] with faithful Abraham
[42:23] so in God's eyes Abraham was faithful
[42:28] Hebrews 2 and 16 said I don't really
[42:31] like this one we're barely talking about
[42:34] Christ for verily he took not on him the
[42:37] nature of angels but he took on him the
[42:40] seed of Abraham
[42:43] this is what God thought of Abraham
[42:50] now
[42:52] [Music]
[42:54] we'll get back to Abraham in a moment
[42:56] but many of you've heard of the
[42:59] interview with sister Bruce and how
[43:04] brother Branham went to pray for her she
[43:06] was having heart trouble and
[43:08] she was thinking she was going to die
[43:11] and brother Brandon went to pray for her
[43:14] and when he got there why he told her
[43:18] you know God hadn't showed me anything I
[43:21] believe you're gonna live and she says
[43:24] what I want most
[43:28] more than healing she said what I want
[43:32] most is an experience that I have been
[43:36] sealed by the Holy Ghost
[43:40] friends on tell you that's what anyone
[43:43] should want most is to know they've been
[43:46] sealed by the Holy Ghost we're not going
[43:49] to make it without it
[43:52] you're gonna have to have the Holy Ghost
[43:54] that's the Bible
[43:57] there was ten virgins and the only the
[44:01] ones that had the Holy Ghost went with
[44:03] the bridegroom
[44:07] while the other ones went to get it the
[44:10] bridegroom came and was gone
[44:13] by the time they got back so you're
[44:17] gonna have to have it
[44:19] you won't make the rapture without it
[44:22] you won't make the bride without Thor be
[44:24] having the Holy Ghost
[44:28] should most of all I want the experience
[44:31] I've been sealed by the Holy Ghost
[44:34] the rims I believe in your heart you are
[44:37] real born-again Christian
[44:41] and
[44:43] he says but you see you're a nervous
[44:47] type of person and he says and when you
[44:51] let little bitty things mount up and he
[44:53] says and it goes both ways with you he
[44:56] says when
[44:57] someone comes on your heart to pray for
[45:00] him why you can't rest until you've
[45:03] prayed for him it'll just keep building
[45:06] till you get there and pray for him he
[45:08] says and God works he said but then
[45:11] Satan works and he tries to get you
[45:14] believed to believe that you don't have
[45:16] it and then he says you let this and
[45:20] that begin to build up on it in your
[45:22] mind and
[45:24] he said but don't look at yourself
[45:32] now we've thought so much that we should
[45:35] be looking at ourselves we
[45:37] thought so much that we should look in
[45:40] the mirror take inventory take count and
[45:42] see if I got everything all right and
[45:44] then that's correct
[45:46] but you can't look at your flesh
[45:49] you can't look at this outward man when
[45:53] we're looking in the mirror we're
[45:54] looking in a spiritual mirror at the
[45:56] spiritual man we're not looking in a
[45:59] natural mirror at this natural man and
[46:02] we're not looking at a spiritual mirror
[46:04] at this natural man
[46:07] because
[46:10] this
[46:11] outside flesh is never going to get the
[46:15] Holy Ghost
[46:18] it stinks
[46:24] and as long as you're in this flesh
[46:28] you're always going to be contending
[46:30] with it
[46:33] because in your flesh
[46:36] you your spirit realm connects with your
[46:40] flesh and in your spirit you got memory
[46:43] and
[46:45] if you ever was a drinker why in your
[46:48] memory
[46:50] can
[46:51] connect with your flesh and you can
[46:54] remember what it tastes like
[46:59] whatever you had done you you that's in
[47:03] your memory
[47:04] the pleasures of this world that you may
[47:07] have taken place the part in
[47:11] you don't forget what they felt like and
[47:15] Satan works in that realm and
[47:18] you've got to contend with this flesh
[47:22] because of those things and
[47:26] in this flesh you're never going to feel
[47:28] righteous
[47:31] you know there are some people that they
[47:34] maybe go a stretch where they feel like
[47:36] I haven't done anything wrong
[47:39] maybe it's been thirty days and I
[47:41] haven't done one thing wrong boy I'm
[47:43] feeling pretty good right now
[47:49] that's somebody depending in their own
[47:51] righteousness
[47:59] there are people in this world
[48:03] that are good moral upstanding
[48:07] individuals
[48:10] but they don't have God in their life
[48:15] so just being good moral and upstanding
[48:18] isn't enough
[48:21] you've got to have Christ
[48:29] now the mystery of it all is that on the
[48:33] inside of this stinking rotten flesh is
[48:37] the real you and that's where God abides
[48:43] he's hid himself in flesh
[48:48] that's why others can look at you
[48:51] especially those of the world they look
[48:53] at you and I'll tell you what if you
[48:55] make a mistake in front of them they're
[48:56] sure lets you know about it I thought
[48:58] you were supposed to be a Christian
[49:02] but they're looking at your flesh
[49:05] but God sees the desire of your heart
[49:11] and I'm going to tell you something
[49:13] about the desire of your heart the
[49:15] desire of your heart will bring this
[49:17] stinking rotten flesh into subjection
[49:22] the desire of your heart when you
[49:25] realize you've made a mistake will want
[49:28] to get right
[49:30] right away kids it ain't something that
[49:34] you say well I'll tell you what Lord I'm
[49:36] going to bed tonight I'll take care of
[49:38] that in the morning no if the desire of
[49:40] your heart is to serve God then you're
[49:43] going to take care of it right as soon
[49:45] as it comes to your realization that
[49:48] you've done something you
[49:51] can't rest
[49:53] you got to know that you're pleasing to
[49:56] them you got to know that he's forgiving
[50:05] brother branham said if Jesus crying
[50:09] sister Bruce said if Jesus Christ was
[50:11] here he would lay his hands on you and
[50:14] you would be miraculously healed
[50:18] he said now I'm not Jesus I'm just a
[50:23] sinner
[50:24] he says but in God's eyes I'm not a
[50:27] sinner and neither are you
[50:32] she says I
[50:35] make so many mistakes
[50:45] he said we've got a blood sacrifice
[50:51] and he said that blood was shed for us
[50:54] and it covers our sins
[51:00] and he said and your mistakes that's
[51:05] what he died for
[51:07] so that your mistakes wouldn't be seen
[51:10] Oh hallelujah why because your mistakes
[51:16] can't come up before God because they
[51:19] first gotta pass through the blood of
[51:21] Jesus Christ
[51:24] and so the blood of Christ acts as a
[51:28] bumper and the sin never comes up before
[51:31] God the mistakes never show up before
[51:33] God that's why God could say through his
[51:37] prophet Paul that Abraham never doubted
[51:42] that's what God could say through Paul
[51:45] that Abraham staggered not at the
[51:48] promise of God but was strong in the
[51:50] faith giving glory to God why because
[51:54] God never saw any of Abraham's mistakes
[52:06] she said but I've still never had an
[52:09] experience that I can put my foot on
[52:13] and you know we all want something
[52:17] we all want something to give us
[52:20] reassurance and there's many people that
[52:22] they look to things but
[52:25] things something they felt on their
[52:28] flesh and I heard somebody say one time
[52:30] and god bless her brother I'm sure he's
[52:32] got the Holy Ghost I don't say for that
[52:34] but he said to me he said when I got the
[52:37] Holy Ghost it was like something warm
[52:38] pour down over my body and I don't doubt
[52:40] that but that's not the evidence
[52:45] that's not how I can say I believe that
[52:48] brother's got the Holy Ghost I believe
[52:50] that brother's got the Holy Ghost
[52:51] because I watched his life
[52:58] this is a
[53:00] minister that many of you would know I
[53:02] just don't say his name cuz I don't see
[53:04] anything
[53:06] but I believe to know that he has the
[53:08] Holy Ghost but not because something
[53:11] warm core down over
[53:13] but I've seen the evidence in his life
[53:17] over the years that I've known him and
[53:20] I've known him many years
[53:30] or the brand says ordinarily a human
[53:32] being is born in sin shaped and iniquity
[53:35] coming to the world speaking lies that's
[53:38] the nature of a human being
[53:41] he said that was your nature he told
[53:43] sister Bruce
[53:45] but it changed once but what changed it
[53:50] she said Christ
[53:52] and he said they're your sisters see
[53:55] that's it
[54:02] you know an individual can come through
[54:07] justification and sanctification and if
[54:11] they stop right there they're just in
[54:13] dangerous territory
[54:16] because sanctification means that the
[54:19] vessels been cleaned out and it's ready
[54:22] to be filled and the Bible says that
[54:26] when the spirits gone out of the man it
[54:28] walketh in dry places and searches for a
[54:32] home and it says when it can't find a
[54:35] place to rest it says I'll returning
[54:37] into my house and when it does it takes
[54:40] seven other spirits with it
[54:43] that's why it's so dangerous for an
[54:46] individual just to to move to a place to
[54:48] be sanctified and then not the one to
[54:51] have an experience with God and be
[54:53] filled with the Holy Ghost
[54:57] say what are they going to do to get
[54:59] filled with the Holy Ghost believe it
[55:03] it's a free gift it's not something
[55:07] you've got to earn
[55:09] it's not something where you've got to
[55:11] say well when I get righteous enough
[55:14] God's gonna fill me with the Holy Ghost
[55:19] go see then you're still looking at your
[55:21] flesh
[55:26] you know brother Branham says the
[55:28] problem is people come to sanctification
[55:31] he says and all they do is they just
[55:32] stop doing things because they know they
[55:35] shouldn't do them
[55:37] but that's not enough
[55:40] they've got to be filled with the Holy
[55:42] Ghost and when they are then the desire
[55:46] changes
[55:50] then what the worshiper once purged has
[55:55] no more desire of sin
[55:59] [Applause]
[56:05] and he says
[56:07] he quotes from the scripture he says he
[56:09] that heareth my words and believeth on
[56:11] him that sent me hath eternal life and
[56:13] shall not come into the judgment but
[56:15] hath past tense passed from death unto
[56:18] life
[56:20] he said that's it
[56:24] you have eternal life
[56:33] we as humans have a tendency we would
[56:36] like to have something that we could
[56:37] point you
[56:41] well this or that happened to me or I
[56:43] had this or that feeling her you know
[56:45] and I'll tell you what when the Spirit
[56:48] comes on you flows over and you get
[56:50] these foods they're great
[56:52] they're wonderful
[56:55] I love that
[56:58] you can feel it surging through here
[57:03] that's not the evidence
[57:06] because that rain falls on the just and
[57:09] the unjust
[57:12] but there was something that comes into
[57:15] your life that doesn't only clean you up
[57:17] and get you ready to be filled but
[57:20] something comes in and changes you from
[57:23] the individual that you were to someone
[57:27] else and that old man who used to be you
[57:32] you look at and say that was never me
[57:42] and you look back and you can't
[57:44] understand why did I live the way I
[57:46] lived why did I do the things I did
[57:51] because you were serving a master
[57:57] but something changed
[58:03] then you don't do the things you used to
[58:05] do only and it's not this distance you
[58:08] don't do them you don't have no desire
[58:11] to do
[58:22] brother branham goes on to pray for
[58:24] sister bruce
[58:27] pardon me
[58:35] and while he's praying
[58:37] he says all things work together for the
[58:40] good of them that love the Lord your
[58:41] Bible says that
[58:44] and he said so there must be something
[58:47] that God is working out in her life that
[58:50] we don't know about
[58:53] but what she was going through he said
[58:57] is gonna work out for her good
[59:01] my brother random has this interview
[59:03] before he goes out and preaches the
[59:04] message masterpiece and when he comes
[59:08] out to minister this message breaches
[59:11] message on masterpiece he refers to the
[59:13] interview he just doesn't say who it was
[59:15] with
[59:16] but he says this he said only interview
[59:19] a few moments ago I was speaking to a
[59:21] person in the room and that that's
[59:23] present now and said but brother branham
[59:26] I have so many things I know that's
[59:29] wrong a
[59:30] godly little woman and I said but look
[59:34] sister you don't look at yourself
[59:36] it's just what your desire is what you
[59:39] tried to do and if you really love the
[59:42] Lord you try to serve him with all your
[59:44] heart then all your mistakes is hid in
[59:47] the blood of Jesus Christ he made away
[59:54] see God made a covenant with man in the
[59:58] beginning but man couldn't keep his part
[1:00:03] he couldn't keep up his in so when God
[1:00:07] made a covenant with Abraham
[1:00:10] the only thing he required out of
[1:00:12] Abraham was a
[1:00:14] seal a sign that he had accepted the
[1:00:19] covenant between him and God and that
[1:00:22] was a sign of circumcision that was the
[1:00:25] only thing God required out of Abraham
[1:00:28] see God made an unconditional covenant
[1:00:31] and he's got an unconditional covenant
[1:00:33] with you
[1:00:41] forgive me if this offends in you one
[1:00:43] this example I'm gonna give
[1:00:47] but I read a sign one time
[1:00:51] that said a dog loves unconditionally
[1:00:57] a
[1:00:58] dog can get a love for an individual and
[1:01:04] no matter how that individual treats
[1:01:05] them the dog still loves them
[1:01:09] that's something that's unconditional it
[1:01:11] doesn't it doesn't matter how the person
[1:01:14] is it still comes and with God it
[1:01:18] doesn't matter how your flesh is the
[1:01:20] covenants not based on your flesh
[1:01:23] the Covenant is not based on you
[1:01:28] the Covenant is based on God
[1:01:37] so no matter what mistakes you make it
[1:01:40] never touches the Covenant
[1:01:44] [Music]
[1:01:45] [Applause]
[1:01:52] what God saved someone knowing he was
[1:01:56] going to lose them
[1:01:59] would God save someone not knowing how
[1:02:03] it was gonna come out and say well I'll
[1:02:04] tell you what I'm gonna give this
[1:02:06] individual a try and
[1:02:09] I'll give him a I'll give him a chance
[1:02:12] and we'll just see how it goes
[1:02:17] that's not God
[1:02:19] God knows everything he knows the
[1:02:23] beginning from the end there is nothing
[1:02:26] hid or secret to God
[1:02:32] God knew everything about your life what
[1:02:36] you would do what you wouldn't do he
[1:02:38] knew all the good you would do he knew
[1:02:40] the faith that you would have and he
[1:02:42] knew all the mistakes you would make
[1:02:44] before you were ever even born
[1:02:48] and he still loved you
[1:02:58] who was Abraham that God should call him
[1:03:03] Abraham was nobody he was an idol
[1:03:06] worshiper
[1:03:09] brother branham said they got their idol
[1:03:12] worship from Nimrod
[1:03:14] who started I he was the first one to
[1:03:17] start idol worship and he said it come
[1:03:21] on down through and then here's Abraham
[1:03:23] and his people and they were idol
[1:03:25] worshipers
[1:03:31] he said his people come from the Tower
[1:03:33] of Babel
[1:03:37] who was Abraham he was nothing there was
[1:03:42] nothing special about Abraham the man
[1:03:50] but God chose him and that's what made
[1:03:55] Abraham special
[1:03:57] because God chose him
[1:04:01] now we know that God knows what you
[1:04:05] would do what you wouldn't do he knows
[1:04:07] what you would choose and what you
[1:04:09] wouldn't choose he knows everybody
[1:04:13] but that's not why God called you
[1:04:15] that's not why he chose you
[1:04:18] he chose you because you're part of him
[1:04:28] he chose you but look
[1:04:32] I don't have it right before me right
[1:04:34] now but in the Bible I could take you
[1:04:37] through the names of the descendants in
[1:04:39] Genesis and each one of those names has
[1:04:42] a meaning behind it and
[1:04:47] we know that brother Branham said Cain
[1:04:50] married one of his sisters
[1:04:53] and then you could go through Kings
[1:04:55] lineage and
[1:04:57] look at the meanings of the names of his
[1:05:00] descendants and eventually you'll find
[1:05:02] one whose name means who is of God the
[1:05:07] question who is of God because they got
[1:05:10] so crossed up now that man had no idea
[1:05:16] who was seated garden who was it and we
[1:05:22] still don't know
[1:05:23] and he got so messed up Satan didn't
[1:05:27] know and he still don't know
[1:05:35] but God knows and that's how God chose
[1:05:40] you because he knows you're part of him
[1:05:43] he made you who you are
[1:05:48] he made you to have the temperament and
[1:05:51] personality that you had and I'm gonna
[1:05:55] tell you something the body change
[1:05:57] doesn't change that
[1:06:03] you'll still be the same person
[1:06:10] the essence of the same person
[1:06:13] just in a glorified body
[1:06:18] with a
[1:06:20] theophany
[1:06:27] and all the things that you deal with in
[1:06:29] this spirit within your spirit realm you
[1:06:31] won't be dealing with that no more
[1:06:34] that's how Satan is going to be bound
[1:06:41] you know what gets to a Tormentor
[1:06:46] someone who likes to agitate and torment
[1:06:49] people you know what gets to him when
[1:06:52] they aren't having no effect
[1:06:57] Satan is a tormentor
[1:07:00] but there's coming a day when he isn't
[1:07:03] gonna had no more effect on you
[1:07:07] then who is going to be in torment
[1:07:11] but right now he can torment you in your
[1:07:14] mind
[1:07:15] brother Branham said that's the batter
[1:07:17] brownie chose was the battleground of
[1:07:20] the mind and he fights you there in your
[1:07:22] mind and that's what he was telling
[1:07:25] sister Bruce he said he puts these
[1:07:27] Saints in your mind and then you get to
[1:07:29] thinking on him and it builds up
[1:07:32] you see this did you done wrong you see
[1:07:34] that did you done wrong you see dissing
[1:07:36] your oh and he gets build up and build
[1:07:38] up and build up to you then begin to
[1:07:41] doubt whether he'll even got it
[1:07:44] [Applause]
[1:07:46] Satan's good at his job
[1:07:49] he's been doing it a long time
[1:07:53] he's perfected
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:08:02] god knows what he's doing
[1:08:06] he doesn't just give people a try and
[1:08:09] see what they'll do he knows what he's
[1:08:11] doing he knows who he's choosen
[1:08:25] where the Brenham says in the message of
[1:08:26] oneness he said we know we make mistakes
[1:08:29] but you mustn't look at that it's not
[1:08:32] your mistakes because you're always
[1:08:34] going to have him
[1:08:36] stumble and falling doesn't have one
[1:08:38] thing to do with that a real true
[1:08:40] servant if he stumbles he'll get up
[1:08:42] again and if he wobbles god of pulling
[1:08:43] right back on the path as long as he's
[1:08:46] in the path of duty
[1:08:51] now he says this in the message of go
[1:08:55] tell 1960
[1:09:01] and because the message is right because
[1:09:04] God sent the message because God sent
[1:09:06] the messenger no doubt every gun in Hell
[1:09:09] will be firing at him and he'll stumble
[1:09:13] and fall
[1:09:15] and was he talking about that messenger
[1:09:18] the seventh angel messenger he said
[1:09:22] he'll stumble and fall we can look in
[1:09:24] brother Browns life and can we see that
[1:09:26] he made mistakes yes but he stumble and
[1:09:29] fall at times yes
[1:09:33] brother branham tried to take his old
[1:09:36] life
[1:09:37] but God prevented it
[1:09:42] he was a man he was human
[1:09:46] but God even through all his mistakes he
[1:09:50] was still God's prophet
[1:09:57] he preached some things in the earlier
[1:09:59] part of his ministry
[1:10:03] that he changed after the seals were
[1:10:05] over
[1:10:07] well no wonder he said the Bible become
[1:10:10] a new Bible to him
[1:10:12] when the seals were open
[1:10:20] you'll stumble and fall and get up and
[1:10:22] shake his head and go on we got a
[1:10:23] message there's nothing gonna stop it
[1:10:30] we can apply that to ourselves
[1:10:35] we've got a message and there's nothing
[1:10:39] going to stop it all the Devils in hell
[1:10:42] can't stop it you say what's my part
[1:10:46] your part is to live this message
[1:10:49] to live this word
[1:10:52] not to just know the message
[1:10:56] not did you say you believed the message
[1:10:58] but to be the message
[1:11:04] your what it's all about
[1:11:06] you're the reason he died you're the
[1:11:10] reason we had a have a redeemer you're
[1:11:12] the reason the book had to be took out
[1:11:14] of the hand of him that sat on the
[1:11:16] throne because God wanted you sane he
[1:11:20] wanted you to have a way back to the
[1:11:22] Tree of Life
[1:11:27] redemption story is all about you
[1:11:35] hallelujah
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:52] Abraham left the land sojourned called
[1:11:54] himself a stranger in the pilgrim and
[1:11:56] look Abraham as all mortals was not an
[1:11:59] immortal man not a man that can't make
[1:12:03] mistake but constantly made mistakes
[1:12:07] but no matter how many mistakes he made
[1:12:10] his anger still held
[1:12:21] and brother Bentham says
[1:12:24] our faith within us is anchored and
[1:12:28] though many times were walking through
[1:12:31] dark shadows and many times we're
[1:12:33] stumbling along the road but our anchor
[1:12:37] still holds
[1:12:42] like that song says the ship is battered
[1:12:46] the sails are torn
[1:12:50] but the anchor holds I
[1:12:54] can identify with that song
[1:13:00] sometimes I feel battered I feel like my
[1:13:03] sails are torn I feel like that the wind
[1:13:06] has gone out of me sort of speed
[1:13:10] but I've got something that'll holds me
[1:13:17] there's something within me that keeps
[1:13:19] me going when my flesh wants to stop
[1:13:23] when my flesh wants to give up there's
[1:13:25] something in me that won't quit
[1:13:35] what is that
[1:13:40] you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:13:42] [Applause]
[1:13:45] it just won't quit it won't stop
[1:13:50] you've got the inner teachers
[1:13:53] you've got a desire that has woken up
[1:13:57] within your heart that won't let you
[1:13:59] quit
[1:14:01] no matter how hard it gets no matter how
[1:14:04] tough it gets no matter how impossible
[1:14:07] it looks
[1:14:10] hallelujah
[1:14:16] hallelujah
[1:14:18] you know Abraham when he left
[1:14:26] he took his daddy with him and he took
[1:14:29] his nephew with him
[1:14:31] and brother Brown said as long as
[1:14:33] Abraham had them along God could never
[1:14:36] bless him
[1:14:39] and he says finally God took the old man
[1:14:45] Abraham's daddy died he said God took
[1:14:47] him why cuz Abraham wouldn't leave him
[1:14:52] even though he was instructed to - to
[1:14:56] separate himself
[1:14:58] but he wouldn't
[1:15:00] so God just took him off the seat and
[1:15:04] then there come a time when brother Bram
[1:15:08] said lot maxilla
[1:15:10] and he and Abraham separated ways
[1:15:14] then God could bless Abraham
[1:15:34] the Branham says look at Abraham and
[1:15:37] Isaac and Jacob
[1:15:39] and all the mistakes they've made
[1:15:45] look the mistakes that Moses me
[1:15:51] we many times have said and went back to
[1:15:53] his ministers were in the book of Joshua
[1:15:57] God spoke to joseline says as I was with
[1:16:00] Moses so shall I be with you and we
[1:16:04] pointed at how Moses made so many
[1:16:06] mistakes
[1:16:07] but God was with him and he was given
[1:16:12] Joshua the insurance look I'm not with
[1:16:15] you because you're so good in the flesh
[1:16:18] I'm with you as I'll be with Moses
[1:16:22] because I chose
[1:16:30] Moses was never outside of God's plan
[1:16:36] no if God didn't mean for the Egyptian
[1:16:39] to get killed
[1:16:41] by Moses
[1:16:43] but Moses still was never out of God's
[1:16:46] plan
[1:16:47] God's plan was he was going to be the
[1:16:50] deliverer you see what I'm saying and so
[1:16:53] he never couldn't get away from that
[1:16:56] he was always he remained in God's plan
[1:17:00] of how he was going to bring this about
[1:17:10] the Bentham says look at all the
[1:17:12] mistakes they made but God was with them
[1:17:14] he said it was a shadow
[1:17:16] one of how God would be with you through
[1:17:20] all of your mistakes and
[1:17:22] why
[1:17:24] because he called you
[1:17:28] who were you that God should call you
[1:17:34] who was I that God should call me I
[1:17:39] wasn't anybody
[1:17:47] who was my dad
[1:17:49] that God should open the truth of this
[1:17:53] hour up to him
[1:17:55] and bring him out of the denomination
[1:18:00] he wasn't anybody special
[1:18:04] but we look on him as a special man it's
[1:18:09] because the God that was in the man is
[1:18:12] because of the God he yielded himself to
[1:18:23] God told Abraham
[1:18:25] I'm going to bring you to me when you're
[1:18:30] old
[1:18:37] brother what I'm sitting in other words
[1:18:39] he said I'm gonna say to you I'm gonna
[1:18:43] bring you through
[1:18:46] you're gonna live a long life
[1:18:49] and you're going to be the father of
[1:18:52] Nations
[1:18:54] hallelujah the father of Nations
[1:18:59] now
[1:19:00] through natural seed we can see where
[1:19:04] Israel is God's nation
[1:19:11] Israel is a nation that come from
[1:19:15] Abraham
[1:19:17] but it's spiritual
[1:19:20] Abraham is the father of many nations in
[1:19:24] many nations he has children
[1:19:28] spiritual children of Abraham
[1:19:35] brother branham says before Abraham done
[1:19:37] one thing to merit anything God called
[1:19:40] it
[1:19:41] God called you God elected you
[1:19:46] he's not gonna lose you
[1:19:51] I Got News for You God's never gonna
[1:19:55] give up on you
[1:20:03] God's not gonna say well I'll tell you
[1:20:05] what that was the last straw
[1:20:10] they just went too far that time know
[1:20:12] why cuz God called you you're his elect
[1:20:21] God will stop you before you even go to
[1:20:24] father
[1:20:26] because you're his elect
[1:20:39] salvation is a free gift
[1:20:42] you didn't earn it
[1:20:45] you didn't buy it
[1:20:48] it's a free gift
[1:20:50] the Holy Ghost is a free gift
[1:20:57] no man can give it to you
[1:21:05] however the path of life does lie
[1:21:07] through man
[1:21:09] brother Branham says in one place he
[1:21:12] said boss teachers will bring false
[1:21:15] birth
[1:21:21] so I fail to see how individuals could
[1:21:24] sit under a pastor who doesn't have the
[1:21:25] Holy Ghost and be able to get the whole
[1:21:27] ego
[1:21:30] because they got nothing to lead them to
[1:21:33] it
[1:21:34] because you receive the Holy Ghost by
[1:21:36] hearing the word
[1:21:40] that's how it comes to the Gentile
[1:21:48] Joe bji brother Branham says you say but
[1:21:51] brother branham I made a mistake last
[1:21:54] week or last month
[1:21:57] I don't care how many mistakes you make
[1:21:59] we've all sinned and come short of the
[1:22:02] glory of God if you're a child of
[1:22:05] Abraham you're and you're ready to
[1:22:07] recognize that as sin and come back to
[1:22:09] God again God's mercy still hangs to you
[1:22:20] brother Adam said God would have done
[1:22:23] away with Sarah when she doubted
[1:22:28] but he couldn't
[1:22:31] because of Abraham
[1:22:33] he said Sarah was part of Abraham so God
[1:22:39] couldn't touch Sarah without touching
[1:22:41] Abraham and he says the same thing with
[1:22:44] you and I were part of Christ God can't
[1:22:48] touch you without first touching his son
[1:22:50] because you and the son are one you've
[1:22:56] been joined in Union
[1:23:07] he says he can't kill the elect he can't
[1:23:09] take your life because you're part of
[1:23:11] himself you're the word
[1:23:25] the band said that's where grace comes
[1:23:27] in
[1:23:29] he couldn't take Sara without touching
[1:23:32] Abraham he said that was where grace
[1:23:33] comes in because he can't touch you
[1:23:35] without touching his son
[1:23:44] it doesn't matter how many mistakes the
[1:23:46] church makes it's still his church
[1:23:58] God correct
[1:24:02] and I think God for that I
[1:24:04] think God that he doesn't just let us go
[1:24:08] that he will correct
[1:24:11] my brother random gives the example he
[1:24:13] says like a little boy or a little girl
[1:24:15] or a little child that's learning to
[1:24:17] walk
[1:24:19] he said let's learn to walk it's gonna
[1:24:21] fall
[1:24:23] he said if he's got a good if they got a
[1:24:26] good daddy he won't spank him because
[1:24:30] they fell but he'll just stand him back
[1:24:32] up and saying walk this way
[1:24:36] he said that's the way God is with us
[1:24:39] he just picks us back up
[1:24:42] brushes us off he says now walk this way
[1:24:45] side now talk this way
[1:24:49] now think this way
[1:24:55] the Lord is long-suffering and of great
[1:24:58] mercy forgiving iniquity and
[1:25:00] transgressions
[1:25:03] you know what a Knick watir
[1:25:06] Nick woody is doing something you know
[1:25:08] is wrong and do it anyway
[1:25:17] but God still forgives you that's his
[1:25:20] word
[1:25:25] you say how does how does that work in
[1:25:27] you make mistake
[1:25:31] it's like this give you an example
[1:25:36] you know it isn't right to lose your
[1:25:38] temper and and just go off
[1:25:44] but yet you've done it
[1:25:54] it's happening
[1:25:59] would God forgive you
[1:26:10] the RAM says and as long as you're
[1:26:12] wanting and hungry to give back to God
[1:26:14] there's a god somewhere calling to you
[1:26:16] or you wouldn't be hungry
[1:26:20] backslidings not lost I want someone to
[1:26:24] tell me where backslidings lost and
[1:26:27] prove it to the Bible
[1:26:30] backsliders not lost he's just out of
[1:26:32] fellowship
[1:26:33] Israel back slid but they never lost
[1:26:35] their covenant they lost their praises
[1:26:38] and joy
[1:26:40] David lost the joy of his salvation when
[1:26:42] he took Bathsheba your eyes wife but he
[1:26:45] never lost his salvation he never said
[1:26:48] restoring to me my salvation he said
[1:26:50] restoring to me the joy of my salvation
[1:26:57] there was a
[1:26:59] young lady named Betty doddery there was
[1:27:03] an brother branham's meeting
[1:27:06] and
[1:27:08] she was in brother Browns meetings when
[1:27:10] she was really young
[1:27:12] teenager
[1:27:14] and she came up before brother Branham
[1:27:17] and brother Branham into discernment and
[1:27:19] he says when he's giving this testimony
[1:27:22] he says he's not going to go into what
[1:27:25] was said but in the desert he told her
[1:27:28] what she had done
[1:27:30] and
[1:27:32] she God forgave her
[1:27:36] and when he's given this testimony she's
[1:27:40] setting in the service and he says she's
[1:27:42] sitting here now and has the Holy Ghost
[1:27:46] he said but as a teenager a kid
[1:27:50] she had done some things she ought not
[1:27:53] to have done
[1:27:56] but who has it
[1:28:00] who hasn't if it isn't grace we're all
[1:28:05] lost
[1:28:17] God had explained brother barristers in
[1:28:19] my life I've made many mistakes in
[1:28:22] come to you
[1:28:29] in my life I've made many mistakes
[1:28:32] I've done lots of things that's wrong
[1:28:34] I'll probably if I live much longer I'll
[1:28:37] do many more perhaps some of them will
[1:28:40] be stumbling blocks in your way I hope
[1:28:43] that you'll forgive me
[1:28:45] I was reading of Abraham how that the
[1:28:48] frustrations he had my the things he did
[1:28:52] he doubted God he lied about his wife
[1:28:54] and everything but when his Divine
[1:28:57] commentary was written in Romans 4 it
[1:28:59] never mentioned his mistakes but it said
[1:29:02] Abraham never staggered at that unbelief
[1:29:08] through God but was strong all his
[1:29:12] mistakes were all forgotten when his
[1:29:14] divine commentary of his life was
[1:29:16] written his frustrations wasn't even
[1:29:19] mentioned his mistakes wasn't mentioned
[1:29:21] brethren I hope that when my
[1:29:23] commentaries read that day he'll rub
[1:29:26] mine out too and won't think about him
[1:29:32] that hope he do too
[1:29:37] how many can say that
[1:29:41] when the God writes you divine
[1:29:44] commentary God don't make mistakes
[1:29:52] but mention how I loved you
[1:29:57] hallelujah talk about how I gave myself
[1:30:03] talk about how I surrendered
[1:30:07] talk about how I believed
[1:30:10] in an age

[1:39:09] Alleluia blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:13] don't you love the Lord tonight
[1:39:16] man how many say that was for me tonight
[1:39:22] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:39:26] what a
[1:39:28] what a precious reality
[1:39:32] you know I think the Lord put it so well
[1:39:35] you know here tonight
[1:39:38] you know when it all comes down to it
[1:39:41] it's the life that's what it all comes
[1:39:44] down to is the desire on the inside
[1:39:48] that's the real change that's the real
[1:39:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:54] as you know I think you're with sister
[1:39:57] Bruce
[1:39:58] you know I was actually in one years ago
[1:40:02] was naturally ministering there in
[1:40:04] brother Tim Humes assembly and I was
[1:40:08] speaking on with referring to that right
[1:40:10] there well brother Tim got up and he
[1:40:12] gave some background on it and he said
[1:40:15] concerning sister Bruce and the reason
[1:40:17] this interview was some of you have
[1:40:19] shared this with some of you too maybe
[1:40:20] don't know this sister Bruce is not the
[1:40:23] one who requested the interview brother
[1:40:26] Branham was
[1:40:27] and the reason brother Branham requested
[1:40:29] the interview is because sister Bruce
[1:40:32] was going around to
[1:40:35] sister Humes and different ones and said
[1:40:38] I wish I had what you have
[1:40:42] that put a whole new light on reading
[1:40:45] this
[1:40:46] so brother Brandon heard this that she
[1:40:49] was going around and saying this I wish
[1:40:51] I had what you had sister sister Humes I
[1:40:54] wish I had what you had
[1:40:56] so brother Brent said he calls this
[1:40:59] interview he calls it and when you read
[1:41:02] that interview as brother jury was
[1:41:04] ministering from tonight she wanted
[1:41:07] something as she asked she said twice
[1:41:09] she asks the question I want something I
[1:41:13] want that I could put my foot on that I
[1:41:16] know I've got the Holy Ghost
[1:41:19] brother Brown never tied her to a
[1:41:21] feeling to an emotion now you can have a
[1:41:24] feeling and have an emotion you know
[1:41:25] what truly that the experience itself is
[1:41:29] where you pass from death unto life
[1:41:32] you know within yourself that you've
[1:41:35] been changed and you know you didn't do
[1:41:38] it that's the miracle that's the paradox
[1:41:41] that's the new birth that's the baptism
[1:41:44] of the Holy Ghost
[1:41:46] and no matter whatever comes or goes
[1:41:49] there's not there's not enough Devils
[1:41:50] out of hell could ever talk to you out
[1:41:52] of it
[1:41:53] because you know that you know that you
[1:41:56] know something and I think you're just
[1:41:58] beautiful how the Lord brought it that
[1:42:01] even when you in yourself it seems like
[1:42:05] you've turned loose but you can't give
[1:42:08] up because
[1:42:10] you've got the one on the inside of you
[1:42:13] are you hearing me now the one on the
[1:42:16] side of inside of you and me who never
[1:42:19] gave up he never gave up when Noah Noah
[1:42:23] Noah and his failure he never gave up as
[1:42:25] was preached tonight with Abraham he
[1:42:27] don't quit
[1:42:29] so if you got the one who don't quit
[1:42:33] then how could you quit
[1:42:35] see that's a reality that desire a
[1:42:39] living God on the inside I'm telling you
[1:42:42] friends I'm so thankful for the true
[1:42:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you know
[1:42:49] what I'm thankful for I'm thankful for
[1:42:51] what the true evidence is where you can
[1:42:54] look and I can look in my own life and
[1:42:57] you know it's that desire on the inside
[1:43:00] where you know I'm not the same person
[1:43:03] what happened
[1:43:06] he changed me I'm not the person that I
[1:43:09] was
[1:43:11] amen glory be to God
[1:43:15] glory be to God don't you love the Lord
[1:43:17] I tell you many services you know that
[1:43:23] you can come back to but as I think

[1:43:28] praying through our brother at the end
[1:43:30] even in days and weeks however long God
[1:43:34] would tarry

[1:43:39] a memorial
[1:43:41] amen let it be something you you see the
[1:43:45] faithfulness of God in our life friends
