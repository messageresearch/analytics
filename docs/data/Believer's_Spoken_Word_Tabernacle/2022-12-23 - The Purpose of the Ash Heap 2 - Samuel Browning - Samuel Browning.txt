minister to every need Lord that's gathered here Lord granted Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen isn't it wonderful to be in his presence it's just wonderful to be amen gathered together with one another and just a precious time that God has given us we want to look in the scripture thank you musicians amen we want to look in the scriptures here this evening once again and I'm going to go right into verse 23 of Job chapter 19. and I want to just the Lord will help us just to try to resume of where we were last week and looking at this thought on the purpose of the ash Heap Job chapter 19 and verse 23. job says all that my words were now written and all that they were printed in a book that they were Graven with an iron pin and led in the rock forever for I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth once you notice that in verse 25 very familiar scripture to us I realize that you as I said to you before you can't listen to yours you'd be hard-pressed to find a message that you would not listen to that you will not hear this referenced this particular scripture but I want you to notice it all comes back down to there's a certainty I know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes Shall Behold and not another though my Reigns be consumed within me amen may God bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated we begin to look at that last weekend examining that of the Ash Heap and you find that that phrasing as we were looking at it that the phrase itself Ash Heap will not of it doesn't appear like that but we know it when you go to look it up it was refers to that of a of a dunghill and a dunghill is that which is a it's an ash Heath and here it comes from the place to where job when he had been Afflicted in his body and he was sitting set down the Bible says among the ashes and he was scraping the boils where he had been Afflicted in his body and we've we've looked at this for at some point in some time of the afflictions and where that job was at within this trial and as we looked at this within the ashifit refers and I said moments ago to the dunghill it was also a place where the refuse or the garbage was dumped it was known as a place that um in Jerusalem they had the dung gate and the dung gate was that which led to the Kidron Valley and that's where they would carry out the ashes and the dung of the animals and they would do it in that through that gate and put it into that place so that the winds themselves would actually take the stench and all of that and take it away instead of bringing it back in to the city you know the scriptures themselves and everything you know this is why brother Brown could say it so clearly if you read the Bible and do not see Christ in every verse go back and read it again because you missed something because in everything that was being done it was a significance and a testimony because if on this in this asheep it was a a less than desirable place to be and I'll say it like this without the holy ghost coming and drawing Upon Our Lives we would never have come to the realization of the asheep that we were born in as a matter of fact this life as I read that quote to you last week that this life at its best is a smoldering dump that's the that's that's at its best and so but took God coming to bring you and I to that realization and what that realization is is to where how the holy spirit will work and sometimes it's you know a period of time and the life just starts to surrender and you know there's a dying out that has to take place in a life before there can ever be a new birth there's got to be a dying out and the Holy Spirit he comes to work on our lives to bring us to that place to where we can stand there and realize that you know there I don't want anything to do with this world not just that we're there in a condition of well I don't like this that's going on or I don't like this but you know all of that works and sometimes it's a it's a process sometimes dying itself it's a slow process and sometimes even when sometimes to watch and situations going on but you know God is leading that process God is the one that leads each and every one of us into that place of a real experience with with him and it requires dying out until you know how it was in our lives until we came to a place to where we were sick and tired of being us Jacob had to get to a place he is tired of being Jacob and until he got to that place there could never come a change but you see that's an ash sheep as well God brings us to that place of death to where we recognize that I need the mercy of God and then through that resurrection power it lifts us above the stench and the filth of the world and you see this is God's grace to you and I because he's lifted every one of us as Believers from the ash heap of sin and unbelief that we were born in He Has Lifted us because remember contamination is all around but God has come in his grace to lift us out of that stench to lift our lives and transport us into the Beloved when we're safe when we're secure and this is the part that is just tremendous that the prevailing winds of the holy spirit that has brought that change within our life it continues to drive away all the stench and the filth of the world because it's God who comes in our life to drive all of that away and here we are we're setting in a place that we are redeemed we're not of the world we've been born again by the spirit of God that is from heaven and we find job in this situation and what job was looking for is the same thing that you and I look for job in this situation he's sitting there and he's looking for consolation he's looking for Comfort he's looking for something to give him courage you see he's looking for there there would be something around and there's nothing from any other source that's coming to giving comfort as a matter of fact the test itself is coming from every angle it's not just that his children were taken that was that was that was bad it wasn't just that is all of the his possessions were you know what he had in riches were taken it wasn't just that his his health was taken but then he has that of his wife he has that of his friends the very ground that job is standing on he's being tested on whether or not that this is real ground that he's standing on he's being tested on the Revelation that he holds in his heart you know everything that we claim in God we have to prove and it isn't that we have to prove it but it Satan makes us prove that everything that you and I confess and you say well brother Samuel then I'm not going to confess but you're not confessing by Your Own Strength we are confessing of what Jesus Christ is and what he has done and as he has revealed himself to us tests are going to come but the same God that inspires you to speak is the same God who will back it up it's not up to you or I to try to figure out how is this going to be but we stand there on that word and say God this is what you said and I'm saying what you've said so we're trying when none of us are any different when we come into these places that we we we desire to be comforted and to to receive encouragement I don't know about you but when I've come into the moments and sometimes we don't even recognize we're in an ashy we don't even recognize we're in a test or in a trial but there's been times that even throughout the day it might be a day that you're looking forward to there can be things I'm looking forward to I'm looking forward to getting in this vein of thought and so forth but there are times that even within that when you wake up you find yourself I need to go and find a source of strength and of courage anybody know what I'm talking about because there's Gloom that's all around and there's no even when there's no reason to feel gloomy and sometimes with situations come and you know what is it there's something in you that tells you there is a place of strength and courage there's a place that I can put my foot on and I'm talking about you've got an experience in your life but you know how it is when God his presence just comes down and he quickens a word to your life and it just does something to you at that moment it energizes you that's true got a situation here or something in here I don't know if I'll get to it but even when brother Branham was receiving strength and encouragement from his new ministry the Holy Spirit even directed him to words that General Patton and general Eisenhower Miss said and the Holy Spirit directed him even in those places and you say this is the thing it wasn't that those men were spiritual but how the Holy Spirit took those things that were being spoken at that time like Patton says brother Brown said my mind he's hearing a minister on the radio mentioned these things that Patton said don't send me no boys over here I want men I don't want cowards over here people that are afraid to die send me men said something begin to grip my heart and speak to me and he said I've talked oh I remembered what general Eisenhower had said if if I got a if I have put a bullet in the gun and he don't go off but I'm not going to throw down my gun I just take that bullet out and put another one in and I'm going to keep doing it until there's a bullet that fires off he was talking about the new ministry that was moving in in his life and he's recognizing God is speaking to his life to encourage him that I don't know how it's going to be but I know that God said he'd be with me I may have to cover those points here just again but we'll just see you know we need we need encouragement and I I believe that's what we come together for in times like this we come together for encouragement don't we that's why I come to the house of God I come to the house of God not just that my weaknesses would be made known I've Got Confidence in that and I'm grateful for that my flesh doesn't like it but I'm grateful for that because I need to grow I I need to know what I need to be what not only where my weakness is but where do I need to be where do I need to be called away to and I also I need to be in comforted I need to be strengthened I need to be encouraged not that when I leave out of here am I expecting that the test or the trial is going to be gone you know you can set in service and just have in your mind and say well I know it's still going to be there when I get home I know it's they're going to be and you can miss what God has for you but instead it's going to be there but God I need strength for this moment I need sufficient Grace because I'm looking at that I know that's fair but I don't want to face it On My Own Strength I'm here for refreshing from the presence of the Lord he's my redeemer amen this is what job is saying I know my redeemer liveth in other words this life this is this I'm not confined to this here but I have one in whom I belong to I have one that that is liveth to redeem me this is why David could even utter the words bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me and forget not his benefits he's the Lord that be that that that that that that that brings about forgiveness for all that iniquities heals on my diseases redeems my life from destruction I could say Amen to that who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfies thy mouth with good things sold that thy youth is renewed like the eagles so we come here we need refreshing from the presence of the Lord we need renewing we need those moments of of reprieve from God's presence and you know think about it job job had personally he had personally heard from God he he knew where he was standing but job did not understand what was going on job did not understand that he was even in a trial he didn't have that understanding but yet he was a prophet and yet it goes on this was said that God God could have broke in in any place and let job know what was taking place but it wasn't necessary that God would have job to understand it at that time because it shows that faith alone is sufficient to guide and direct us through every obstacle that the greatest thing that you and I could have is faith because faith is not something that you and I understand but faith is what is revealed to you and I it's a strength within our life to where when you can't explain things and I can't explain things but I know that beyond the clouds God is still there though the clouds are dark though the skies are gloomy but God is still God behind those clouds glory be to God now I want you to think of this here in this moment in second Corinthians chapter four The these these scriptures just just bless me when you think about it the Bible said we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed I want you to catch this here you know what Joe you know what Paul is speaking this is a positive confession yes there's negative circumstances that's all around and there will be but there's a positive confession there's a positive testimony that's why brother Brandon when you you can just type it in you'll find it 17 times in the message there never have a negative testimony you know that's a battle that doesn't mean that we're to compromise on it we are tested on that amen We Fear Paul Paul is letting us know all of this is all around but in the midst of it I am not in despair you see this is here's the secret if we could interview Paul we can ask Paul Paul what's the secret behind your confession and Paul would tell you that in the midst of this time I've learned not to complain when the tests or trials are going on I might start to but I recognized if I can just get into his presence and draw strength from him there's a confession that comes forth we got quiet our flesh complains right it complains our flesh does not like this was not Paul's flesh this was not Paul's standing up in the church and people saying well Paul's In the Flesh Paul was not in the flesh he's confessing a positive confession maybe before Paul maybe come to the platform or maybe when Paul if you could have seen earlier in the week maybe there was some complaining that was going on at first when it struck come on they were they're men and men of like passion subject as we are I can bring you a quote with brother Branham in that same place I'm talking about where brother Brown said here I am I'm battling the sinus infection's not going away and what God was trying to get him to do is to accept the new ministry that he confirmed to him and brother Branham here they are they're bringing him antibiotics the brothers are coming and praying for him and brother Brown said the sinus infection isn't budging a butt a bit and I can't even speak to nobody he was so hoarse he couldn't even speak to anybody and he said I got to a place after them brothers left I called media over to me imagine here the prophet of God saying this and he calls meaty over to him and he says you know what sometimes I doubt even whether I'm called or not oh my goodness I don't know about you that don't bother me a bit those kind of things like that I can follow a man like that because that's real you know what that that's that flesh that DNA but there was something greater than the DNA and I'll Branham that brought this message it was Jesus Christ hello him came down and spoke through this ministry is that right so in the midst of it it shows you and I that we can get down we can get in that place but over in the room so thank God for a wife that's a real help me where sister meaty looked at him and said you ought to be ashamed of yourself for even saying that I'd say she ain't like job's wife that was a real one weren't you a real help man you ought to be ashamed of yourself well I don't know if we're going to be able to do this and I don't know oh my but a real helpmate is there to do what encourage mm-hmm oh my I love it when it gets right down to where you can put it in The Lunchbox don't you notice in verse 10 always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus always always that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body so there's always the bearing about in the body the dying why that his life might be made manifest for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so the whole purpose of everything is that that life itself would be made manifest in the only way that that can be manifest is for us to die more to ourselves and I don't know about you but you know I I just say this about I'll just say it's about me I can say you know Lord I Need To Die more but there's things that God has done and he's taken me through and showed me that I I would have never signed up for it and I never would have thought I needed to die in certain areas maybe I'm just speaking for myself tonight y'all can just pray for me but I realize there's certain things that it was all about me dying more to myself it had nothing to do with with anybody else or anything it had more it had to do now look you know job knows he knows my redeemer liveth but this is the greatest Vision Brother Brad would call it it's the greatest Vision that that had been given because Daniel saw the angel the Hebrew children saw the Son of God Noah saw the rainbow Abraham seen God face to face but job saw the resurrection all the Patriarchs all the saints they had looked forward to that day with an assurance through their Visions through the revelations that there would come that time of a resurrection but job he actually saw it and to think you know Billy Brown would say it like this he says they have to have I have to have a crucifixion how many knows what a crucifixion is we know we can say well you know the Lord Jesus was crucified but you know it's one of the slowest deaths there's nothing instant about it it's just slow it's just slow and they have to have a crucifixion now watch out brother Brahman is bringing this before you can have a resurrection before the church will ever be able to see a resurrected power before I can ever see a new ministry he's talking about the third pool take place myself and before you can enter into a new fellowship with God there's got to be a self-crucifixion so there can come a resurrection let me just lay on this here just a moment this is where we're getting to the purpose here of of the ashy we've got to die out to our own thoughts die out to our own ways die out to everything that's around us and go through the trials and tribulations that we might see a new Resurrection a new life now he's talking to us as Believers then he breaks over and he says before a sinner can never become a Christian there's got to be a death then a resurrection before Abraham could see Elohim there had to be 25 years of testing before the Hebrew children could see the Son of God they had to go into the fiery furnace before Daniel could see an angel he had to go the Lion's Den before job could ever see the resurrection he had to go in and lose everything he had and then by Vision he saw brother Brown says if job could stand so firmly Upon A Promise how much more we ought to do after Christ is raised from the dead and become the first first fruits of them that slept and he sent back the Holy Spirit as a seal of Promise upon us that because I live you shall live also seeing his great presence among us working and doing the same signs and wonders that he did on Earth giving us the hope so notice brother Brahm is bringing that down we are seeing as here we are coming together the testimonies that that are among us we are seeing the same resurrection power his great presence Among Us it gives us hopes you know what hope is it's expectation that's why even as well said we come to the house of God there should be an expectation when we do come to the house of God now you may not be sitting in a trial you may not be sitting in a place of a test right now within this moment but God knows what you and I have need of he knows what is even coming down the road and God is working not only to encourage us he's there to prepare us he's there to strengthen you and I there is so much of the multifaceted approach of almighty God of how God is dealing with so many needs within just one service and brother Graham says now if we see that right Among Us let's get off the ash heat today with a new vision with a new power with a new determination because we see God in his power and we see the resurrection of the things that are coming so before any of these great Revelations could come there had to be a trial to go through so the revelations of even how God will make himself more real to you and I even coming that for there to be more like brother Graham says as I'm coming to that new ministry and he says even in that of for you and I to enter into a new fellowship with God I'd say every one of us would say Lord I want to be I want to be closer to you I want more of you I want more of God and with that in order for there to be more of God it's got to be less of me now I'll be honest my flesh when my flesh because the reasoning part will kick in and say wait a minute we're not signing up for a trial you might but I ain't right because this flesh is a pest house this this flesh wants things easy this flesh is weak it's Earth and vessel when I say flesh I'm talking about not just the body I'm talking about the spirit right the mind all of those parts they it wants things the easy way but there's a part that is there on the inside of us that as we're looking to God and we can see Lord I need more of you it's God stirring that up in our lives I want more of God I need more of God in my life but you know when we come to the ash heaps as I said sometimes we don't realize that were on the Ashy and we're praying I don't know about you but have been times as I've been I prayed and asked God help me to keep the right attitude I'm just going to be real help me to keep the right attitude Lord because you see thoughts can come our way feelings our feet listen when the Holy Ghost come he didn't do away with your feelings feelings are still there things can come our way it may be with even with sickness and even with disease and sometimes in the midst of it we have to pray God help me to stay focused in the right way help me Lord that I maintain the right attitude because thoughts can come your way but remember you can't stop the birds from flying over but it's to take that double barrel shotgun and blast them because what are you doing you can't find a roosting place here right we're going to be offended because we've also offended other people we're disappointed we've been disappointed and we've disappointed other people right sometimes it's even in the midst of those situations that we can look and say oh my this person or my boss or or this or that and we can look at those things and yet it isn't about them right listen what are you saying I'm saying that will stay on the ash Heap until we realize that that person is not the problem it's what's causing flare-ups in US it's what's agitating us whoo oh Lord you know it's like we want free agency for our friends we need free agency we want to trade people and get other people in and do this and do that and man if we don't like you know everything is just so used to it's like with the social media befriend befriend befriend and man if this ain't posting this befriend a new friend that's easy to do on social media getting down home aren't we but sometimes the situations we're brought into we're asking and Lord I'm praying brother Samuel I'm praying but I don't feel like I'm getting any stronger but it's how are we praying are we are we recognizing that the ash sheep is a place for us to die God I need to die more to myself this trial is not about anybody else or this situation my boss or this it ain't about nobody else it's about Lord I Need To Die to myself brother Brandon with that sinus condition that was going on in his body and God was letting him know this reason this is going on people are coming and praying for you laying hands on you the doctors are giving you antibiotics but God said I'm keeping you on this ash Heap until you accept what I have Vindicated already now think about how the prophet stood there in the message go tell and he stands there right after that and he says what it is I'm afraid of defeat I'm afraid of failing that I would step out there and it wouldn't happen you realize how God is working with the prophet's life brother Graham said God knows how to keep you on an ashy in referring to that situation until he's got the message across to you oh it sounds almost like us as parents sometimes you know when we can you know when the discipline comes the older they get well you know maybe it's not the belt and the timeouts anymore but man here comes the lectures and laying it out and laying everything else and it'll do no good anyhow but you know I mean the when it gets down the lectures they tune you out you know as they get older they let you know hey you know and you realize say Lord help me to be short sweet and to the point and may the Holy Ghost be there to punch it in [Laughter] but you realize that God knows how to hold us there until the message gets across to us because the whole message is about us dying and accepting and brother Branham brings that right back around for his own life in his own Ministry brother Brian said you know what it's like he said it would be like a man that has been sitting there he's read the word read the word read the word read the word heard the word preach heard the word preach heard the word preach he said and all of a sudden something just strikes him and he realized hey something's talking about me it's talking about me in the same message it's talking about me he said you know what finally happens with that man he accepts it what God has said about it he said that's exactly where I am with this new ministry I must accept what God has already confirmed now we're talking after Hattie Wright's house we're talking with all of this but you see God is moving the prophet into that face this is 1960. you will hear Brother Brown refer to this in 1961 1962. why there is a continual dying to William Bradham that Jesus Christ might be May manifest that's why brother Brown could tell Leo and Gene write it down in the book he said because the changing of the ministry going into the third poll will not be so much as a change in the ministry as it will be a change in me wow and to me this is just exactly where I believe that how God took the prophet that's the way he takes us that's the way he takes us right through the word of God it's God us yielding it's God doing the work it's us trusting the Lord and dying more and more to ourselves so here we are in this place think about how that even when you think of how with the crucifixion that you know the disciples after the event took place where the Lord Jesus was crucified think about it before the crucifixion he could not say all power in Heaven and Earth is given to me but after the resurrection after crucifixion come forth the resurrection then he could declare all power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me so it didn't lose power he gained power think about the disciples here they were they were so despondent they were so discouraged things had not happened the way that they thought they ought to happen they were crushed they were disappointed and the devil was working on them to do what bring them to an eye sheet and they came to an ashy but it was necessary for God to allow them to come to an asheep why that the resurrection might come forth to them but when they would see him it would stir their hearts in the promise that that would make known the promise to that it would encourage him it would take lives that were despondent that were disappointed that were crushed with all those events and it would encourage them in the promises of God think about brother Brandon would say it like this he says I remember in my own life he said on the road down to destruction when I heard a sweet voice say I'm Jesus I was once dead and I'm Alive forevermore and because I live you can live also and since that time putting my hand in his I've trusted him through the Dark Places when the times come where I can't see which way I'm going I still trust him Through The Dark Places places that I don't understand I still trust him Now watch how he says this every Christian believer has to be pushed into those trials I say Amen to that every Christian believer has to be put on their ashy so he can come forth with an experience I know my redeemer liveth not a historical Affair it's not something that we are are hoping and well it may be or it might be but I know like job could say I know my redeemer liveth this that reality of I know is the greatest revelation to our lives I know my redeemer liveth and I will see my redeemer who is your Redeemer job it's God God Is My Redeemer job had that Revelation even in that moment and it was even in that moment the prophet could tell us that the lamb that job had been offering up he saw at that moment what the lamb meant the lamb stepped forward in that moment job saw what the lamb was all about House of praise God I know my redeemer liveth John do you know what's going on I don't know what's going on but I know in whom I have believed I don't know everything that's taking place but I know my redeemer lives I know that he will bring me out I know that he will bring me forth God's working you know the Bible tells us that all things work together for the good to them who are the called yeah is that right yeah yeah everything they didn't say everything was good but it did say everything does work together for our good and God places us on the ashes in order to show his glory this is why when brother Branham you know if I could just take just a moment out no doubt we could go through here uh this evening as well when brother Graham's talking about 31 years of his life here he says I want to make my testimony this I've seen disappointments and they've seen disappointments I've seen the time I've asked for things cried for things begged for things and failed to get them anybody say yeah but look if I'll just wait patiently upon God then I know it works just exactly right it'll come out exactly right it does just exactly the right thing he goes in now in this same message when he lost his little Sharon Rose and brother random said that was one thing that stumbled me I said how can that be for the good how can it be for the good but months later I seen her standing in the beauty as a young girl and she was speaking to me standing by the side of that wagon I know that she would have lived he says this is what I know I know if she would have lived she might have turned out wrong God had to take her while she was tender and sweet I know I'll see her again I know I shall see her I know it Beyond any Shadow of Doubt he goes in talking about his wife he was 22 years old now that she was taken he said I didn't know what to do I'm just I I want to just this message here I've told you this message is 1960 April uh the 17th is just titled I know it's just a short short message but I don't know how many times I've listened to it here over the months right after he makes that statement about Sharon Rose and his wife he said but today I know it was all working for my good he didn't understand it then well brother Samuel how did he get through it he trusted God it shows there's going to be things that you and I don't understand there's things that don't line up that how can this be for the good but in the midst of it has got to be a trust that I Trust You Lord and that becomes a confession I Trust You Lord I don't know what's going on I don't see this situation you and I have been in situations things that you cannot just reach out and physically remove or turn around or a few words make it go away it won't some situations and you say how did this be how could this get this way but if we could realize it's God bringing you and I to an eye sheep sometimes we're so interested our flesh is interested in wanting to get off the ash sheep but the real victory in the ass sheep is where more of Samuel is Left Behind and more of God can come forth Hallelujah and God knows just how to do that if God would ask me to choose it well of course it'd just be like when I choose what I want to eat I don't choose stuff that I don't like to eat I don't chew stuff it looks funny I don't choose stuff that's moving it's got to be dead I don't want to eat it if it's moving I don't want to eat it with his eyeballs in it looking at me either I tell the brothers when I go overseas take mine out and take the head off I don't want it right we would choose things that we like if it was up to us listen I don't care how born again you are our flesh will never choose the hard way that's why I took the spirit of God to bring you and I to a real ass sheep to recognize that there would be a choice that would be made that would be the hard decision a great decision a momentous decision and what was it it was God pulling upon her soul it was God pulling upon that Whispers could come on what are you going to do with your friends what are you going to do with your co-workers what is so-and-so going to say what are your friends going to say now all those Whispers you know what that is that stench from the ash Heath that's trying to keep us there but God in his grace oh you talking about the prevailing winds of the Holy Ghost brother it's the winds that comes by and lets you know there is a fresh life there's a fresh experience there's a fresh walk there's a renewing there's a life that's so far greater than anything this world can offer my worst day as a Christian is better than the best day of the center you catch that how many Justified of that amen that's absolutely the truth now I want you to watch this testimony here that brother Branham said he said but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be ground and twisted and squeezed to get what was in it out remember we are all we delivered unto death Calvary could have never taken place without there being a Gethsemane right gethsemane's word was squeezed out we would like quick instant come on let's get the crucified but there there's a whole process we are always delivered unto death according to the dying of our Lord Jesus what was the dying to his will sure nevertheless not my will than will be done he was choosing to stand upon the word he was making that choice there was a dying going on that from Gethsemane it could go to Calvary and before he even got the calvary thing about it after Gethsemane he enters into pilate's Hall I think he goes in amongst people that are going to ridicule him speak against him ask him for certain things here it is in pilate's Hall but you know what that is it's dying he's being tested even when he was on the cross I like how brother Brown says it I think he quotes from Paul Rader all he had it would have had to have done he'd just give one nod to the angels they were all posted and that would have been it but he was dying to himself as a matter of fact when he died if we could do a spiritual MRI he had not one bit of bitterness in his life against Pilate he had not one bit of bitterness against Judas oh Lord help us let's follow him now see this is why we need the help of the spirit of God this is why at times Upon Our Ash heaps the spirit of God is leading us Lord I'm ready for Resurrection I'm ready for resurrection and here we find out I'm still in Pilates Hall how many Pilot's home why because there cannot be any spec bit bitterness resentment or whatever and you realize there's times you got to pray that out getting quiet now in the message super sense when brother brother Brown preaches that after he's come through the Holy Ghost series and just preached the super sign that morning brother Brian has given a word of counsel to the church spends about 40 45 minutes speaking to it before he actually goes in to preach the message the super sense and it begins to speak to him he says now listen let's maintain this consecration that has been brought about in the church right now we've seen God move and he said now Satan is going to come and try to tell you things against this one against that one and he said there might be things he said that he said don't you listen to it you turn it down right away I don't care if you think it's true or not burn it down right don't don't entertain it and then he goes in to speak he says if there's something comes in he says now he says if you feel like that there's some a little bit of something resentment or something he said just get along with God and pray it out now I know I'm not preaching to Angels I'm preaching to all of us tonight but you know what it works I could stand right there and when I was just walking in the yard the other day and listening I said Lord I'm a witness that works I know that works I'm so glad for the Holy Ghost I'm so thankful for the spirit of God in our life that we can pray and submit ourselves to almighty God and God brings healing in our life don't wrestle with things in your life of well why do I feel this way and the enemy beating you up why if you fell you shouldn't feel this way you shouldn't Miss no go to God in prayer and say Lord I give this to you this is my brother this is my sister or my co-worker my boss I give it to you Lord Jesus that's right it works don't it it might be it clocks in you know Satan is there to punch the card the next morning what I do pray the same thing again because it works it's dying out to self brother REM says here's what it was there was too much branum in there I could put myself in there and say there was too much Browning in there had to be squeezed out before God could make himself known there was too much of you in you I want a paradox too much of you in you that had to be squeezed out till God had to squeeze it out through trials and that squeezing was come oh he said it's hard when it's coming on but after a while the skies clear back then you see the purpose of God and that's when you can cry out I know my redeemer liveth and at the last days he'll stand on the earth and though the skin worms destroys this body yet in my flesh shall I see God these little trials and things are just for a moment they fade and they pass away and he said I want you to remember they're done for your good that God would get Glory let me bring it down here Paul says in verse 13 of that same chapter we having the same Spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you now I want you to notice that same Spirit of faith that I know he shall Raise Me Up I know my redeemer lives see that same Spirit of faith that we speak by a positive confession a positive testimony that I know that God is in control I don't know all these circumstances I don't know all of this just sometimes even when it's a sickness sometimes it's a sickness that can linger only no matter what it is disappointments sickness troubles it doesn't matter it has it all comes along it comes into that place that Lord I know that you shall raise us up also I know you're going to bring me through God you're going to bring us through you're seeing me through right now I may not feel like it but I know you're working Lord help me to die more to myself help me to submit myself in the midst of this time lord don't let there be nothing that that stands in my life because what this ass sheep is purposed for is that I might have a new fellowship with you there might be a Resurrection come forth there might be less of me Lord and more of you that's the purpose of the action God leads us to the trial that it would be less of us and more of him come forth for all things Paul could say in verse 15 or for your sakes that the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redowned to the glory of God for which cause we think not but though our outward men perish let me say Amen to that when they asked sheep the outward man is perishing yet the inward man is renewed day by day the inward man is receiving comfort receiving strength receiving courage for our light Affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory while we look not at things which are seen But at things which are not seen the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal to think of that your stance job greatest revelation Joe sees the resurrection job even seen of even in this hour of the resurrection of the word out of dark denominationalism job is beholding this in this hour it's compound I can't go into all that tonight but it's compound because when we look at it in job 19 here you come right after this in job 20. here comes a response from one of the one of the friends then job 21. job goes right back in it's like you look at it if you would look at Job you'd say job what's going on but job has had a moment of reprieve of refreshing of renewal God didn't give him understanding of the trial God didn't give him understanding but what God did was is giving the Revelation I know my redeemer lives and once God ever let me just lay this in once God ever gives the original Revelation he can never take away from that he only adds to it unfolds it more and more and that's what continues to happen in that of job that continues to unfold more and more just even to where you and I are standing today it's the same way in our lives same way in our lives what God has done originally in our life that original work it never takes away from it but he continues to add to it continues to add it continues to unfold himself but the ash sheep many many different ways many things of that ashy I think two examples here that I that even for brother Branham because we could talk about sickness we can talk about you know as I said we whether it's disappointments it's offenses on and on family or wherever it could be but even how brother Branham as I told you was on that ass sheep when he got to looking around at Oral Robert's place and he said God I must be the biggest hypocrite you couldn't trust me that's what he said but then the Lord spoke to him I am your portion you see it lets us know that sometimes even in our feelings about things can be an ashy well brother Samuel how long am I on that ass sheep until we get the message until we get the message I say God help me to get the message I I'm not saying that from my flesh or help me to get out of it I'm saying it from here God help me to get what it is that you're trying to say to me because I know if I'm on on the ash sheep there's more of Samuel I want to leave behind because I know that's what the purpose of it's for is that there would be a new Fellowship there would be more more of you that would come forth in my life oh God is so mindful he knows how to lead you and I into those places God knows how he just doesn't speak to you and I and say this has got to be more of this and more of this and but God knows how to bring us into these places that there brother Brian they're just so personable it's so personal every trial it's so personal that's why I could look at your trial Brothers train and say oh come on brother Shane come on I could but I know better than that because God is working personally with every one of our lives and you know the thing about it is sister Carmen the trial is not to defeat us the trial is not to shame us the trial is not to put us down the trial is so that more of Jesus Christ can come forth in our life oh God help me help us Lord help us Lord to look to you help me to die more to myself help me Lord in these situations that come about help me Lord I want to leave more of Samuel behind because he's the guy that gets in my way he's the one that hinders I want to leave more of him behind let's pray Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I pray Lord that you just just put it all together Lord I always just trusting Lord to bring it together to our hearts Lord right where it needs to be that go Lord to encourage us Lord to strengthen us the Lord in these moments Lord God in these times I know Lord should you Tarry Lord should you tarry a month months year so forth Lord down the road we will need to be reminded of these things Lord will need to be Lord encouraged and Lord we Look to You Lord to encourage us Lord not just Lord as we're speaking about tests and trials if that's the way you take it Lord but father each time when we come Lord to the house of God Lord as we come with an expectation Lord to hear from you to see to see you Lord as you would move among us as you would speak to our hearts help us the Lord not to be so Lord consumed with the ash Heap Lord that we miss your voice Lord but Lord I know Lord Jesus I know for myself Lord and I believe I can speak Lord God for every other believer here tonight Lord those that are streaming Lord we Look to You Lord God and say Lord I just need to hear a word from you Lord I just need a word from you Lord I need Lord God just encouragement Lord strength Lord from you Lord like job we may be Lord the understanding doesn't break in that moment the trial doesn't stop the test doesn't stop but Lord God we receive the refreshing and the strengthening that we need in our lives Lord there's a purpose that you have Lord oh God Lord Jesus This Is Where We Trust You Lord I don't understand it Lord there's many things that even it does I've looked at Lord not only in my own life but even Lord as a pastor Lord over the congregation and even in other settings there's things that Lord that I just be honest I don't understand Lord but Lord I trust you I Trust You Lord I know Lord God there's a rest within My Heart Lord you know what's best Lord you know Lord You're the one who's at work Lord God Lord how the prophet he didn't come to this understanding right away Lord God when you had taken Sharon Rose when you had taken Lord dear God his wife even when he goes on to speak Lord in that that further service of that day where I was quoting to Lord referring to of that of his new ministry Lord God you had begun to speak to him even in that time when he was on the ash sheep but he realized Lord God that through those Visions he had been relying too much upon Men been relying upon things that are around him and you were Lord speaking to him in that moment Lord and helping him Lord in that moment on the ash Heap Lord Jesus there was the Lord that reality Lord as the prophet himself as he stood right there he had to die to that Lord which he was afraid of afraid to make a mistake afraid to fail Lord he was there standing before him but Lord Jesus we know Lord we're a product that God where our life was able to be surrendered to you Lord and died to his self and this message Lord has come to our hearts Lord God you have delivered it Lord to our lives now Lord help us Lord I pray God help us Lord Jesus Lord to die to ourselves even more Lord help me Lord help every one of my brothers and my sisters Lord we need Divine assistance Lord sometimes the Lord the things that we're praying for Lord and we're praying and it just seems like there's no answer sometimes the Lord it comes down to the very things or the way that we're praying about things it's not leading us to death to self and self-crucifixion Lord God just so many different ways so many Avenues Lord that we can take from here but father you have such a such a precise way Lord of working in our lives to bring each of us into that Lord further expression of yourself Lord in our lives help us Lord father if there's one that's here or Lord God by way of the internet Lord that maybe lord they're laying on that Ash sheep Lord of dying to themselves in order Lord to come into that of New Life Lord I pray that God may you just Lord continue to guide him and help him Lord Lord to coming into that place of full surrender that they might be raised in that resurrection power Lord in the newness of Life Lord to serve you Lord not as a law not as a Creed not as a do or a don't but Lord In A Love Affair granted Lord tonight father may you Lord just continue to move Lord for every one of our needs Lord there's many Among Us Lord different ones that are dealing with sickness Lord in their body different ones the Lord God lord recovering from surgeries and things Lord I pray that God you'll continue to minister Lord to each one of them Lord in a very special way oh God minister to their bodies Lord strengthen them Lord in their Spirit Lord and in their mind oh God I pray Lord May you Lord God encourage him Lord strengthen them Lord Lord is that strengthening would come through the body Lord from one another may you also speak to him Lord and through Lord the very personal ways we pray God Minister Lord God to each one of the needs of your children Lord father we need you Lord and we love you father help us Lord God help us Lord we want to be more like you we love you father in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen oh I don't know what I do I join know what I do I don't know what I do without the Lord [Music] around and see all that he has done for me I don't know what I do without the Lord [Music] I don't know what I do I go know what I do I don't know what I do without the Lord [Music] and I love around and see all their needs he has done for me I don't know what I do without the Lord oh I don't know what I do I don't know what I do I don't know what I do without the Lord and I look around and see all that he has done for me I don't know what I do without the Lord [Music] My Redeemer faithful and true everything is [Music] me every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true Oh My Redeemer faithful and the truth everything is said he will foreign [Music] just kind of speak but I just want to say that um the Lord is really talk speaking he's really talking to us about not going through feelings and all that and uh last last Friday I had a dream the dream had to do with this and um I had a dream about the brothers asking um who who who wants the Lord who who loves the Lord and everything and so all the church stand up and I stay sitting down and then I said I started feeling like um what's wrong with me you know that because I wasn't really understanding and then I said what's wrong with me I really do I really love the Lord do I really things like that and it was really bothering me and then um I said no look inside inside of you and the Lord Of Glory that's why you know and then all those feelings they they left left so um their brother um came and preached and he he started saying the same things and he says just look inside look inside of you the Lord that and um that's it and um then the brother has been preaching about it about not going my feelings not not by letting any anything come and tell you anything but just believe God the inside that he's he's taking care of you he's taking care and um I thought maybe I should just give you the testimony because so he he kind of said you said what I told you to say so I um I think it's God trying to to tell somebody that the enemy is trying to tell them they're not no good they're whatever you know and and it's just not that it's not that just listen to what the brother is preaching because God is really leading him to um to help you guys um not to let the devil defeat you praise the Lord and then thank you [Applause] ma'am now you know brother Brandon mentioned in his own walk with God and I don't care how far along you are in your walk with God the enemy still will try to come that's how you we learn through these battles to Warfare we learned that and when I say learn that it doesn't mean that the battles don't come it is me recognizing God gives us Grace to help to recognize what's going on brother Brandon he said when when I was a young Christian he said Satan used to come and beat me all around the stump based on my feelings he said but then when I recognized have met God's requirements and I could point that right back to the enemy and said no you can't accuse me I've met God's requirements I've done everything that he asked me to do it was a learning same thing within our lives it's recognizing in the midst of all the feelings will come things come how God would allow us just to tap into that for a moment but the feelings is not who you are the feelings are not who you are amen that's not who you are is who you really are on the inside but Brandon said there was too much as he as they read that quote he said there's too much of you in you so it's two u's there's a u inside of you and it takes the word of God to let you know who you are it's the word that comes and brings a discernment and divides bone from the moral and pulls out on the inside who the real you is because this on the outside it can whisper to you and even use your own voice that's how thoughts will come that's one of Satan's tactics to make you think that well this is what really my desires are that's a lie your desires is what's coming from the inside my desire is to serve the Lord my desire is to live for him and you're Discerning that spirit that's coming what do I do stand against it how do I stand against it by the desire that's in your heart and say Lord I stand for you Lord I stand for your word Lord regardless of how I feel Thy word is truth he is Our Redeemer he is our deliverer he's an ever-present help in the time of trouble the hope of glory in our life [Applause] don't you love him how we just appreciate him listening Ryan's seeing something has a look back on this road I've traveled see so many times he's carrying me through yes Lord and if there's one thing that I've learned in my life it's my redeemer is faithful and true oh my redeemers faithful and
