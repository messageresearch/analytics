for all of our all of our unsaved loved ones sister Gomez thank you any unspoken prayer requests this morning an uplifted hand amen let's just go together with our brother [Music] a couple weekends ago I went down to Tennessee to brother Donnie's for their meetings and uh he was having a prayer line and it was it was quite lengthy and even uh at one time brother Donnie had actually even passed out and he was on the front they were giving him oxygen and stuff and a couple of other ministers were also very exhausted so they at the end they took them in the back and they're kind of all over the place another brother Ron Spencer was taking oxygen brother Donahue was uh taking oxygen stuff and they were just kind of laying around and my brother Donnie got his his breath back he uh looked around at the other brothers and he said just think we're the victors he said just imagine what hell's going through right now so sometimes Victory doesn't look exactly like what we think Victory looked at like you just think this morning how many carefully laid plans brother the the Satan head to try to keep you from being here but we're here we're still standing so sometimes uh that's what victory looks like that we can't see but uh I just uh love the Lord and just think from for all he's he's done for us and it we're still here we're still standing so let's just go before the Lord in prayer dear Lord Jesus we just come before you in prayer Lord and we just uh just want to take these requests Lord before you Lord each and every one just a serious needs Lord I read and in a book of Psalms where it where it says where Satan is pursuing your bride at the end but it says right before his time of Victory he stumbles and falls and it just kind of begs the question of who put the stumbling block in his way to make him stumble and it just seems Lord that maybe before the foundation of the world Lord you knew what was coming up and you would put put that there at that time just when it seemed like he was going to get victory but you had that in front of him to where he would stumble and fall in each one of these sometimes it seems like we're surrounded and seems like that Satan's got the upper hand Lord but you're in control Lord you can put a stumbling block in front of him at any time you can call a timeout you can do anything Lord that you want to and so it's just for us to rest and relax in you that you have everything in control and lord it's it's you that we look to We Trust in and we believe in Lord we just we just thank you Lord that we can look to you in times of of sorrow in times of Doubt Lord and in times of need Lord just knowing Lord that your your hand is Never Too Short Lord and you have Lord you know the end from the beginning you have all things in control Lord so we just commit these prayer requests Lord and into your hands Lord Commit This service into your hands Lord and just pray for brother Jerry Lord just to be able to get himself out of the way Lord and just just anoint Lord and use that gift Lord that you've placed within him you placed that there for the benefit of the body Lord so we just want to pull on that gift Lord and just allow you to Lord operate that gift the way you would like to operate the gift this morning Lord just to meet the needs Lord we just pray for the tithes and offerings all over that you would bless them Lord and just for the remainder of the service Lord I just pray that you would just be in control and just feel free in this place learn and feel welcome Lord have your way I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen [Music] as the brothers would come for the ties in the offering before you're seated greet one another let's sing the dope dope leads the lamp B flat B flat you may be seated

shaken savior you gotta change he's a chain breaker Hallelujah amen I kind of want to share something I heard last night I hope I can tell it before I start crying but um you know that one uh I can't remember what brother Brandon was but it was that boy that was led on the stage walking like a dog with a chain around his neck and brother Brandon had a vision of the boys uh brother who was injured too and brother Brandon had a vision of the boy healed and that boy bound and changed was actually praying for his brother and then brother Branham had another vision of the boy standing up and then once the boy saw his brother healed that's when brother Branham the boy started to believe and brother Branham said he picked up the chain and the boy raised to his feet and tears started to flow down his belly and I'm just glad that this message I was bound in Chains but this message Lifted Me Up amen broke the chains this message says behold I send you Elijah the Prophet this message Has Lifted us up amen hallelujah amen let's sing um something keeps holding me key of G his brother Samuel comes aren't you glad for that anchor [Music] the trials of this world were getting stronger [Music] the pole I felt was more than I could bear and I was on the verge of giving over thank you Lord the strength Within Myself just was in there [Music] holding me every day I see he's helping me Faithfully to overcome us giving me victory he's a reality something keeps holding me [Music] Satan laid before me his Temptations of his desire to steal away my face but I have found inside a revelation [Music] the strength I needed to keep me in his grace something keeps holding me every day I see he's helping me Faithfully my trials from God in Me constantly giving me victory is a reality something keeps holding me and Jesus keeps holding me the day I see he's helping me Faithfully to overcome my trial he's gotten me constantly and giving me Victory [Applause] he's a reality Jesus keeps holding me one more time Jesus keeps holding me every day I see he's helping me painfully to overcome my trials he's guiding me calm constantly Dory he's a reality oh Jesus keeps holding me Jesus reality Jesus keeps holding me foreign [Music] [Applause] and that's nothing but the truth based on our strength our strength has let go a long time ago brother Brandon was asked when his children with little Sharon Rose was taken home and his wife and the gentleman came by when he was on the road and said Billy how how are you holding your religion now he said I'm not he said he's holding me and I'm so glad that there's one who's got a hold in our life that's something that's greater than our human strength or our abilities amen I'm great I'm glad it's not religion but it's salvation amen it's a real reality and so we're just so thankful to be in the house of the Lord this morning aren't you glad to be here man it's so good to be gathered together Amen in the precious name of the Lord and we want to just say here this morning I want to welcome all the visitors and they're here with us different visitors God bless you good to have you and I'd like to welcome back sister Doris foreign and we're just continuing to keep our sister in prayer and amen we're glad to see you've been glad to see her here as a bottle art right over a month ago and she suffered there with a stroke but God is mindful God is merciful amen and uh you know and I know Sister Doris wouldn't mind me saying this but she said when the first time I went to see her she said you know what she said I believe that devil was getting got upset she said because I was coming back to church I said absolutely the enemy don't want to he'll contest every every promise and everything you know so when we're being contested you know you're doing what God wants you to do and then fight against it and press on so we just we thank God for that and want to continue to remember our sister in prayer we have um a dedication here this morning and I want to as just in a few moments as sister Carmen she's going to bring Little Caesar here to just dedicate him to the Lord it just really pressed upon her heart and many of you know our sister Carmen there is ministering there and taking care of Little Caesar behalf of other family and so she wants to dedicate him to the Lord and I think that's a tremendous thing you know I look at the scripture when they brought little children to him the Bible says that he should put his hands on them I'll tell you if there's anybody I want their hands on my kids it's Jesus the world wants to put their hands all over them can you hear me the government and schools and everything I don't have nothing against schools but as long as they keep their Lane and stay where they need to stay and keep their hands and their nose out of certain things it'd be all right but if there's one place that we want is to have our hands has his hands put on us and you know the disciples they rebuked him what are you doing you know sometimes the things that we regard as so little or we think is insignificant is very important in the eyes of God and so Jesus goes on to say suffer the little children and forbid them not coming to me for if such is the kingdom of heaven and I think that's that's the real desire McDonald's we dedicate Little Caesar to the Lord but the sister Carmen the desire is just to raise him the admonition to serve the Lord amen and soul let's just join together in a word of Prayer amen [Music] Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we thank you Father for your mercy Lord I thank you Father for this Lord little child is life Little Caesar dear God we lord just Look to You In This Moment and father knowing that God that there's something greater Lord within us Lord and fathers the Lord we yield of our hands Lord that it might be your presence that would Lord even touch him now that God that may you just Lord watch over his life oh God may you just keep your hand upon him I pray may his heart his Spirit lord always be tender and God I pray father is sister Carmen stands here Lord to dedicate him to you Lord asking God for your wisdom and Direction Lord and the raising Lord of Little Caesar I pray that God that Lord that you'll just take a hold of his life Lord oh God at a young age Lord I pray and may he come to know you Lord I pray father in a very special way Lord we just dedicate this life to you Lord and bless the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen [Music] amen [Music] amen Hallelujah I want to uh say it's good to have brother Jerry and sister Mina here with us of course Michael and it's Rose glad to have them have them as well and so thankful they could be here and brother Jerry the Lord willing not to be ministering this morning but it's coming Thursday and following Sunday and I don't know I haven't put the pressure on him for the next Thursday yet or not but I didn't mention it to him I just felt if I said something here pressure might come in a greater way I know he's got to drive but what it is is we appreciate your ministry Construction it's a blessing to us it's a blessing to us so we just want to just invite the prince of the Lord just to continue to move Among Us in a special way if you could as brother Jerry prepares to come I brother Nathan Bryant who was here with us in Memorial Day weekend I just asked if there's a prayer request that you would just continue to remember before the Lord Brother Nathan had just got an update when he was getting home yesterday and that was that his mother she had had cancer everything was free and clear but then some things started to reoccur and after some CT and Bone scans this week they determined that the treatment's no longer effective stronger treatments not even options so they've just had the doctor's advised she's just she stopped all treatment and just accepting pain management but we know as like brother Nathan had said we know that God's able to heal her with or without medical intervention we've got testimonies we don't even have to leave this assembly where God heals stage four cancer you know it wasn't the angel who mentioned cancer it was brother Branham who mentioned cancer to the angel nothing will stand before your prayer and brother Branham asked the angel not even cancer and the angel said not even cancer well I'm I'm thankful in an age when that word in other words when it's spoken fear can can can try to come that's part of the humanity in the side but I'm glad that we've got a strength on the inside a love of God that's able to strengthen Us in that hour and like I said before it's like them beavers that pop up at the fair on that whack-a-mole things can pop up but thank God you got a strength to go get back down get back down get back down I thank God for that aren't you I'm glad there's something deeper than just this this Humanity I'm glad there's something deeper I'm glad he's holding us aren't you amen you love the Lord and let's stand together and let's continue to sing this song that brother Brian was singing something keeps holding me Satan lay before me his Temptations of his desire to steal away my pain but I have found inside a revelation sure [Music] it was the strength I needed to keep me in his grace Jesus keeps holding me every day I see he's helping me to overcome my try he's guided me [Applause] [Music] the reality and Jesus keeps holding me [Music] reality Jesus keeps holding me please praise the Lord good to be here with you and I always enjoy coming here in your wonderful group of people to preach to and it's always easier when the people help you and so uh we we had brother Phil my associate and I we both scheduled to be out of town in Dixon at the same time and I had a another brother that I was asking to come and then he had to do something an expo down in Atlanta so he wasn't able to come then and then I I wasn't able to to get find someone else to fill in at the last moment and so uh and then for the service in Dixon this morning we had to cancel the service and uh the people are going to be tuning in here so I want to say to them if you're tuning in here this morning you've heard this message before but stay tuned in because I've got more to say than I said at home so and I when I preached this before I I gave a warning and I'll give it again because I I'm preaching to myself more than I think I'm preaching to you but I'm going to give a warning this one's going to burn and but it's good that so if you would while you're standing with me turn in your Bibles to Numbers Chapter 11. and we want to read the first three verses of scripture there and when the people complained and that's what I want to title this message this morning and when the people complained it displeased the Lord and the Lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burned among them and it consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp and the people cried into Moses and when Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was quenched and he called the name of the place tavarah because the fire of the Lord burned among them you may be seated when you take a look at Israel and that's who we're looking at this morning and we realized they had been in bondage for 400 years in Egypt and right there at the end of their bondage things got worse and you know Pharaoh told him all right your Talia bricks is going to increase but you're going to have to get your own straw to make the bricks and and uh so you know the task Masters really cracked down on them and things just kept getting worse and uh you know if you remember they came to Egypt because of a famine in the land and Joseph was a leader in Egypt at that time and so uh he had favor with the Pharaoh that was on the throne but then the Bible tells us that if Pharaoh rose on the throne that knew not Joseph and this was the Pharaoh that the children of Israel were under and it brought them from being guests in Egypt to being slaves in Egypt so their lives had drastically changed over the 400 years that they were there and things just got worse and then God comes down with a mighty hand and through plagues that he brought down upon Egypt he brings Egypt and pharaoh to their knees and to where they had to surrender and let them go and uh you know look at all the times Pharaoh refused to let him go but then finally he has to surrender to the will of God and let him go and so God delivered them as he had promised Abraham and this had been taught to them down Through the Ages that there was a deliverer coming that uh they were going to be delivered out of this bondage in Egypt and so once they were then they they exit in this Mass Exodus and they go out and you know the first thing they face is the water where they come to in Mora is bitter and so what do they do they complained and so then God tells Moses to cut this tree down put it over in the water and then it turns the water sweet and then they had water and then they they go on from there and you realize that they they were in the wilderness and uh traveling wandering around for 40 years but their clothes never wore out their shoes never wore out there there wasn't no place to go buy new ones there you know they didn't have the equipment to make new ones and uh but God so blessed that their clothes never wore out in 40 years you know I I don't know exactly how they did as their kids were getting older but it seemed like they always had clothes more and there was always shoes and uh you know God just took care of them and and then he you know they needed food to eat so he brought down Manna From Heaven Angel's bread and brother Branham says and they were eating Angels bread and they complained about it and you know the Bible says that they uh they gathered the the Manna in the morning said it was like coriander seed and they they grounded in meals they beat it in Mortar they baked it in pans they made cakes out of it they made different things out of it they were trying to because the taste of it became so common to him they didn't really care for the taste it tastes like oil and so they complained about that and they tried making it in different ways to try to appease themselves you know and then finally they're like we're tired of this we're tired of eating Mana you know can you imagine saying we're tired of eating Angels food and they said we want flesh we want meat and so Moses comes before the Lord and he says look look at these people complaining and God says they want meat and you're like God's anger was kindled against them the Bible says because of them complaining you know and he said you want meat fine I'll give you meat but I'll not give it to you for a day I'll not give it to you for a week he said I'm going to give it to you until it comes out of your nostrils until it becomes a loathsome thing to you so God's anger was countered against him he said you wanted okay I'm going to give it to you but when I get after I give it to you you're going to have it so much you're going to get tired of that and and you know so you you're not complaining the effect it has on God and you know uh every the thing was with Israel it was like they never could look at God's blessings they were always looking at their troubles and every time they came to a trouble instead of looking at the past and seeing God's record for taking them and delivering them out of everything and every trouble they faced and giving them a resolution for everything they always complained about it instead and they came down to a place where they didn't have any water and so uh God they were complaining about it so God tells Moses to go down and smite The Rock and said and you know water coming from Iraq that would be the last place you would look for water but God told him Smite The Rock and he smote The Rock and out of a place that would be impossible to have water out comes water but you think that then when they come down again and you know if you here's the thing with God if he gives you a test and you don't pass it you're he's going to give it to you again and he's going to give it to you again and again and again and again until you pass it because friends look we're not going to get to Heaven by the skin of our teeth you know and you realize the children of Israel when you finally come down to it they never did pass the test because out of two and a half million there was only two Joshua and Caleb that ever ended up Crossing into the promised land they got outside of the will of God because of their carnal minds and their complaints it took them out of the Divine will of God and it caused them to wander around in the desert amen yes yes see the effect complaining has but why couldn't they look back and see well the last time we come down to a place we had no water God gave us water out of an impossible place but they came down to again where they didn't have any water and what they do they complained about it nobody said to Moses Moses god did it to us before us before could you ask him to do it again no they complained about it and so much so that Moses anger was kindled and he goes up there and he's and God had told him to speak to the Rock and instead he smites The Rock and he says must I fetch water from this rock for you bunch of rebels Moses was Moses had really in and tried his patience because you realize Moses came with the promise for God that he God was going to supply their needs you know God never promised to supply your wants but there's not nobody sitting here this morning that can't say God hasn't supplied some of your wants as well as your needs but God promised to supply their needs he promised them to drag them to a land flowing with milk and honey and when they finally came down to the time to cross over they couldn't believe and that was their problem the whole time that's why they were always complaining was because of their unbelief and friends when you find yourself in situations and instead of looking to God for deliverance you got to complain about it then what it is that's unbelief and we want to cast down all unbelief you know brother Adam said people are the same way today he said they complained because they say I preached too hard he said when what I'm trying to do is trying to get them straightened up so they can go to heaven and they're complaining about it and you know this this was a new message that they had coming out of Egypt and going into uh on their road to the promised land and uh uh they they witnessed Time After Time the miracles of god and yet they complained until they ended up dying by the thousands and you say well what happened to him they're eternally gone remember the the priests and Pharisees said to Jesus said uh our fathers ate man in the wilderness and drank water from a rock and Jesus said and they're everyone dead after seeing all the Miracles they saw and they still complained we go through times in our lives and there's not a one of us sitting here today that could say we've never complained but you know brother Branham said he said I read once he said where it said I complained about having no shoes until I saw a man that had no feet and he said if you look around there's always someone who's worse off than you you know recently and you know how I am when I preach I tell all kinds of things on myself and recently uh is actually June 19th uh I had a day of it and I had different things coming up and going on and uh it was nothing involved in the church it was just personal with me and my life and uh you know and uh I I uh looked at my bank account online when I looked at my bank account online there was a charge that had come in that I wasn't expecting and hadn't authorized and what it did it ran me into the red because I wasn't expecting it it was on a side uh it was on it happened on a Monday and my check don't go in till Tuesday and so uh you know I I called the it was a company that I get my CPAP supplies from and I called them up and I said I didn't authorize you to put no charge on my account and they said well you know we we just as soon as the insurance uh puts out what they uh uh will cover then we immediately charge your account for what's left over and I said well I don't want you to do that you've got to let me know you can't just be doing that and they said well not only that but you owe such and such another amount for the machine still well that was upsetting you know here I was you know uh something that happened here and now they're telling me I owed even more money and so my mind went to what in the world's wrong with my insurance what in the world's wrong with my health insurance and I asked him I said didn't they cover anything and they said yeah and they told me how much I said man that was less than 50 percent of it I said I feel like I got Auto Insurance on my body yeah you know and and I just friends I got into a bad way and then I've got a little French Bulldog and he took off on me that day and I I had to walk down to the road after I done took a shower to go get him and he wouldn't listen to me and I throw rocks at him to get him back up the hill because he wouldn't come to me and so I chased him back up the hill you know and I got back up the hill and and I'd text my wife and said bring the Jeep down we got to get this dog and so she had started down the hill and I was coming up the hill and so I just about got him to the porch and she started on down the hill because the car was facing down the hill to go to go on down and turn around and come back well he heard that and he took off again and so you know I thought man I got to go in and take another shower and the thing about it was for instance my grandson Michael was there with me and he was witnessing all this going on he was witnessing my carrying on and and the things I was saying and how I was acting and all this and and then when it come about Nightfall you know time to go to bed man I felt ashamed of myself and uh so I was apologizing to Michael and I told him I did wrong and I said don't do like that I did wrong I said I was wrong and I apologize for I told him I said I feel so ashamed of the way I acted have you been there and it got me to thinking you know how do we act in front of our children how do we act him how do we react to problems and troubles and I and it got me to going back in my mind and thinking and I thought about when I was a little boy and I thought about both my parents living in Cleveland Ohio and both of them working to try to make ends meet you know and one of them working day shift and one of them working night shift me coming home from school with the a key to the house and letting myself in and being there about an hour or so a little more maybe until my mom would get in from work because she worked days dad worked nights and and and so they they barely got to see one another you know except on the weekends and then on the weekends Dad one time Dad was working two jobs he was working a job during the week and then working at a gas station on the weekends and I I went in to work on the weekends with him and uh I passed out and maybe you young people had never heard of this before but I passed out Green Stamps and for so many you know back then they put the gas in for you checked your oil cleans your windshield and done all that for you you know and I stood there's a little boy and I packed the lunch right along with my daddy you know and I I stood there's a little boy and when they would get so much gas then I would count out so much Green Stamps and give them and you know the thing about going through and thinking about all this you know if my parents ever complained I never heard them I don't ever remember either one of them ever throwing a fit because they couldn't meet something financially or because something got hard and that made me feel even worse and and I thought you know here they had it you know and they had it and my dad you know growing up he grew up poor I think he grew up he had two pair of pants one to wear for for outside to play and one pair to wear to school and he had shoes in the wintertime and uh you know and to go to go to school and they only dad would tell me they only usually ate meat one time a week and that was on Sunday if they got it and that would be chicken and he never got the choice of chicken he always got whatever else the adults wasn't eating and so you know he always got dark meat and so after my dad got older he never would touch dark meat he he he always had to have a white meat because he said he never got it growing up you know and what they ate most of the time during the week was fried potatoes and pinto beans and cornbread and that's what they lived on you know and they were poor and there was times they didn't you know my grandfather was a drinker and uh so a lot of times he would spend most of the money before he got home and so they didn't have money for groceries and my grandmother and my dad were both serving the lord you know my my dad started preaching when he was 17 years old and they would get down and pray and one time they were getting down to pray didn't have any groceries in the house and all of a sudden while they were still on their knees a knock came at the door they went there was a man there at the door with some bags of groceries he said the Lord told me to bring these to you and you know I I talked to my grandmother about the hard times that she'd grew up in and and she come up during the time of the depression and that you know and and both sides of my grandparents come through the Great Depression and that and you know I look back at them and I never heard him complain about anything my my grandfather Brown my mom's dad he worked long hard hours in the coal mines and I never heard him complain about it and then I thought of all the things that me in my life that I've complained about we if something don't go just kind of the way we thought it should go what did we do a lot of times we complain about it you know I gave you the example of myself and my my ordeal with the with the health insurance and everything and I got to thank him as I read this book brother said somebody's always got it worse off than you and I thought well I've been into other countries where they don't have anything I've I've sat at their tables and ate in their houses where you could see out through the boards to see outside they didn't have no glass on them when is all they had was some some boards they'd made shutters out of to shut at night you know I I've been in churches where they had lanterns and uh and you know uh I thought about one of the first times I went to the Philippines and preached and brother Phil went with me and we got over there one Sunday morning he they were having me preach in one place I think in Manila and he was preaching in a different place and uh you know they uh Manila is a big city and uh they got so much traffic and things like that to go a few miles takes hours and so they got several churches around Manila and so he was preaching at another church and he was preaching down by the river and he told me why I was preaching a rat ran across the aisle of the church it was almost as big as a cat a river rat oh my God you know and the the people never bothered them they just kept on pulling and kept on worshiping you know and I thought about the churches that we have nice air conditioning nice heat you know and and and a lot of their churches there ain't no air conditioning they ain't even some of their churches there ain't even no fans you know and uh you know when usually when I go on a trip like that I don't never wear a tie because I'll sweat the thing out and uh so uh my brother and I have preached in places over there when we got done preaching we had to go back to our room and actually peel our clothes off it would just so soaked with sweat they just stuck to you because there wasn't no air and I thought about the nice comfortable pews we have and the nice comfortable churches we have and and the the atmosphere uh uh uh you know the natural atmosphere that we can have of having air conditioning and all this you know and and the luxuries we have here and we find things to complain about We complain about when our our car doesn't uh want to run just right and there's people in other countries that don't even have a car my mom and dad when they first came up to Cleveland Ohio they didn't have a car couldn't afford to have a car couldn't afford to ride the bus to get to work so they walked everywhere they went and I never growing up ever heard them complain I can remember times of us having it tight and tough financially but I never heard my mom and dad complain you know we just made sure we done the best we could with what we had you know and I was uh for the first 13 years of my life I was an only child so as a young child you know I was the only one in the home and uh so uh Dad tried to give me things like that what he wasn't able to have and uh you know and if he told me he was going to give me something he'd make me a promise I never asked him again about it because I knew he was going to keep his word that's how he ought to be with God we know God has promised to take care of our needs we know that God has promised to deliver us out of all of our troubles then we we ought to question him you know in in the books of Psalms let me turn down to it real quick in the in the Book of Psalms uh Psalm 77 if you want to turn there and read with me it says I cried into the Lord with my voice even into God with my voice and he gave ear unto me in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord that's what we need to do my sore ran in the night and ceased not and my soul refused to be confident I remembered the Lord and was troubled and I complained and my spirit was overwhelmed thou behold is mine eyes waking I am so troubled that I cannot speak I have considered the days of old and the years of ancient times and I call to remembrance my song in the night and I commune with my own heart and my spirit make diligent search will the Lord cast off forever will he be favorable no more is his Mercy clean Gone Forever doth his promise fell forevermore hath for God forgotten to be gracious hath he and anger shut up his Tender Mercies and I said in my infirmity but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most high I will remember the works of God surely I will remember thy wonders of old I will meditate all so on all thy works and talk of thy doings that's the thing Israel should have been doing they should have been meditating on the works and wonders of God that he had performed in their midst and how he had care of them they were poor they were destitute they had nothing but God took care of them God has never failed to take care of us David said I was once young but now I'm old but I've never seen the righteous forsaken nor is she begging bearhead God has always took care of our needs what have we got to complain about brother Branham talked about during the World War II he said we complained because we didn't have any sugar he said we complained because we had to boil our water twice for the coffee he said and we complained about it he says and there was young boys over across the seas dying and giving their lives for our Liberty and our freedom and we were complaining about not having a little something brother man says I think sometimes we complain too much Hallelujah one time you know core rose up and Nathan and they were complaining about Moses and saying you take too much on yourselves and said we're all holy and said how do you why should you lift yourself up above us brother Madam said they were complaining about God's provided way he said and God ended up killing him for it remember Moses said to him he said God is going to do a new thing today and he said he's going to open up the Earth and swallow you you know and all those is on the Lord's Side come over here and Cora and them stood there and withstood Moses and the Earth opened up and ate them and they were no more you think then the other people that remained would have said buddy we need to stop complaining but they didn't we need to start taking God at his word but they didn't we need to think about what they went through the times when we go through our troubles we need to think about all the times that God delivered us and have the faith that he will do it again song says he will do it again and again and again Hallelujah many times we just we get so self-consumed and we get tunnel vision and we get to looking at just what's going on right there and what just pleases our flesh friends I'm going to tell you something God didn't come to save your flesh he didn't come to baby and pamper your flesh he come to save your soul and and and and and and it's your soul that is the Eternal part of you this old flesh is what pulls you and tempts you to complain to cry about stuff if it doesn't go your way well you know uh they're just treating me such and such a way at work you've got work well I tell you this is just this working just so hard God's given you the strength to do it oh I tell you what they're just not paying me enough well there's nothing wrong with you know asking for a raise but the thing about it is Friends there's people around the world that don't get paid nothing right there's people around the world to get paid pennies next to what you get I remember going down to Honduras and preaching down there and I preached in a place where they had kicked him out of the church building they had so they didn't have a church building and we had to drive so far and then we had to walk up a mountain and we walked up the mountain and and and and the Brotherhood was with us you know he had a a generator that the church here had bought him and and and he packed that generator put a rug on his shoulder and packed that generator up the mountain to where these people lived so we could set up and have service because they didn't they had service outside in front of their home and they didn't have any life so we carried this stuff up there and some of the other brothers got up there and they strung some lights up and started that generator and got some lights and and brought out some places for the people to sit and there wasn't no cry rooms there wasn't no nurseries mama had to feed her child she just fed her child right there you know I I was preaching and I've raised my arm up and when I raised my arm out there was a bug that looked like it stretched from my wrist down to my elbow I just shook it off and went on preaching you know when I was sitting there studying before the service that had me out behind the house and I was sitting out behind this was in another place I was sitting out behind the house and there was chickens roosting in the tree that we were sitting under and uh one of the young girls from the the family one of the daughters comes out and she grabs one of the chickens and and takes it off and I didn't think nothing about it you know but what they would eat many times for their protein they ate the eggs from the chicken and I don't mean just for breakfast they ate it for other meals too and so but that night we had chicken they had took one of their chickens that produced for them and they had killed it for me you know how little that made me feel and I thought about the times I've complained about eating chicken and here they they didn't normally eat the chicken you know but they had killed it that that day for me while I was sitting out there studying to preach the service and uh you know and then you see the little children around and they you know you you're sitting at the table with the brothers and the little children sitting around and they're not eating you know and my dad that always bothered him and he always tried to give his food to the children so I want the children to eat first you know and uh and you know you try to you you try to give your food to somebody else but if you didn't eat it you might offend them because they had done this for you in honor of you so you needed to show you know that's one of the things with many people today they are not appreciative enough they don't appreciate what they've got they don't have any value of appreciation put upon the things that God has gave them [Applause] Philippians Paul says I have learned in whatsoever state I'm in there with to be content in Hebrews Paul says let your conversations be without covenants and be content with such things as you have brother Branham said if I would have taken all the money that's been offered to me he said I would be a well-off man today he said but I didn't do it he said I would rather not have anything and be in the will of God than to have he said one of the movie stars mansions in Hollywood he said I'd rather feel my heart in the presence of Christ that I feel now and have and then to have the riches of the world Jesus was born in this world he had a hard start he was born in a barn his first crib cradle was a Manger that's something that the animals ate out of his blanket you know his receiving blanket we call it was the swaddling cloth which was the the the swan caller the blanket light that went on the back of of the the ox you know to to absorb the the perspiration off of the ox while it worked that's what he was wrapped in there was no room in the end there was no room for him anywhere and then he grew up with the with the the the the the the accusation of being an illegitimate child he was persecuted for it he was whipped he was beaten for you and me by his stripes I am healed And We complain sometimes when something just gets a little rough he had to walk up calvary's way carrying his own cross until he stumbled under the weight of it and they had to get somebody else to step in and help him bear it the rest of the way we ought to gladly bear our cross we ought to counter the privilege friends look when you faced with the trouble you know what it actually is it's an opportunity for God to come and do something for you when you're faced with sickness in your life it's an opportunity for God to come and heal you I remember when I was first diagnosed with diabetes and you know it really upset me and I got really depressed about it and I got down about it and you know what I was thinking I was thinking of all the things I like to eat that I wasn't going to be able to eat and for a long time I I didn't try to take care of it you know I just I said well whatever if I check it it's going to be high so I'm just going to eat what I want to eat and enjoy what I want to enjoy and just go on that way but you know things in the health seem to get worse and finally I realized you know that you know brother random says people say God doesn't help them that don't help themselves he said that's wrong he said God helps them that can't help themselves but you know if there's something you can do I believe God expects you to do it and that was the Revelation I come to you know and I thought about something my dad had told me there was years ago back in 1997 dad and I would come we'd meet here at the church and we'd pray during the day and then I would go up and I was trying to to get the tape Library organized and all those things and I worked during the day and dad was working on things down in the office and and then but we'd meet here every day we'd pray you know and dad was praying and he told me about it later and he said he had diabetes you know and he was praying God heal me from this diabetes and he said while he was he prayed and he prayed many times about it he said while he was praying different pictures of images of food that he was eating that he shouldn't be eating started coming up into his mind and he said the Lord spoke to him said I've already healed you but you're not eaten right And We complain about having it and there's people around the world friends they don't even have the temptation of some of the foods that you have the temptation of them because it just ain't there pregnant brother Rowell Soriano had diabetes you know and one of the main Staples eaten over there is rice and I love rice but you know rice is a starch and rice will cause your blood sugar to go up so if you're eating rice every day and you got diabetes you need to change your diet the thing about it is you've got you know what I come to I had to change the way I thought be content with such things as we have be content with whatever state you find yourself in whatever the situation is knowing that God can take care of you and be content with that brother Branham was uh out hunting up in the mountains and he was walking you know and he was by himself and he was walking and uh you know in a a Rancher came along riding on a horse and saw brother Branham and offered him to get up on the horse and ride with him and so they were riding and he asked brother REM said he said what do you do and he said well I I've been a ranger and he said yeah he says uh and brother bear said I also I'm a preacher and the man said you look too intelligent for that he said and brother Graham said I'd like to think that my intelligence is what uh allows me to accept I got to preach and he said well let me ask you a question he said don't tell me you believe in the Virgin birth and brother Brahm said I sure do he said well I'm going to tell you something he said it is scientifically impossible for something like that to happen he said there's got to be a man and a woman there's got to be both present in order to have a baby he said that's scientifically impossible brother Graham said well I know it's true he said why because you read it in the Bible he said not only that he said because he lives in my heart he said well how do you know he lives in your heart he said because I could tell you what my life used to be and I can tell you how he changed it and how he's made me what I am today all right and and he said so you really believe that he says I believe it with all my heart he said they went on riding a little bit and he said he looked and the man kind of pulled his hat down you know uh over his eyes a little bit and he said I couldn't tell what he was doing and said then he turned his head sideways you know and and he said he looked up uh into the mountains and he said uh uh uh let me just find it here he said he said I lift up my heads into the Hills from which I come with my help and my Help Cometh From The Lord he said tears started rolling down his eyes and he said preacher you ain't been the first preacher up here he said and I've asked and talked to every one of them he says and I've been looking for one that really believed it and he gave his life to the Lord brother Branham you know what if he'd have thought oh man of all people in the world to pick me up of all people in the world to ask me for a ride and this guy's got to persecute me over what I believe and question me over it but he he didn't and he ended up leading the man to the Lord because he said I found a preacher that finally really believed this yeah sometimes we may have to stand a little persecution the trial of our faith is more precious than gold you know brother Branham said you know he said a mule is one of the most ignorant animals I've ever known he said I've worked with him he said they're one of the most ignorant animals there are he said you can't teach them nothing and he said that's what's the matter with some people today they're like a mule you can't teach them nothing and you know we I'm standing here this morning and I stood last Sunday and I'm preaching to Born Again Believers of God that have are human and in our flesh we have complained but I'll tell you sometimes we need to watch that that old uh nature and attitude of the mule don't we don't take it on yes brother Adam said the mule Will Wait its whole life just to kick you one last time before it dies he said you know what a mule is he said it's a hybrid he said it a mule didn't come from God that came man-made man put a mirror with the donkey and produced something that can't produce itself back he said he don't know who his dad in his and his mama is he said but a good old Thoroughbred he said he can trace back his ancestors and people I want you to know today you can trace back your ancestry all the way back to God Eternal at the beginning you don't even have a beginning you're Eternal if you have eternal life in you you never had a beginning this body had a beginning don't let this body rule you amen yes but you know what it is brother Brandon said sometimes we let the devil after all of God's promises we let the devil kick us around like a football you know the thing about it is Satan's been stripped of his rights he was stripped of his rights at Calvary Jesus took on him our sins all the sins that had been committed an all-future sin though all the sins ever of the world of all people that ever existed or ever would exist he took all that on him what a weight we think sometimes about how the devil brings back up into our mind some of how we lived the things we did and we and that bothers us think about Jesus he had all of that and it suffered so so much with it friends you know crucifixion is actually a a long drawn-out process of death they they put him up on a on a cross and what happens is you know their legs start to give out on them after a while of holding themselves up and as they do you know their arms are up and they begin to sink down and it begins to push down on their lungs and what it's doing is slowly suffocating them but it says that it would take days for somebody to die through crucifixion it took hours for Jesus because he had the weight of the world on him all the sins and for those sins he was sent to hell and when he went to hell he he come down to Hell and Friends he bust open the gates went up to the devil and said I'll have those keys now and he took the keys from the devil you know as I heard brother Dan Daisy often say he said the devil don't even get the keys to his own house and he took the keys from him he took the he took the power over of death that was over man the Bible says he led captivity captive here they were in a place that was it was a realm Called Paradise and it was where you know because they died under the blood of bulls and goats and so there wasn't uh an ultimate sacrifice for their sins so they couldn't go into the presence of God they had to go to this other realm and they weren't lost but they were in need of a savior and so when the Savior come he come and set them free from that brother Adam said when Jesus walked down through those corridors he said there stood up Abraham and he said Sarah remember him this is the one I've always talked about and the Bible said many of the Saints of old Rose from their graves and walked through the streets of Jerusalem amen he led captivity captured he set him free he took all the rights away from the Devil the devil don't got any rights over you quit letting him kick you around he said how do we let him kick us around when we were faced with the trouble when we're faced with the trial when we're faced with the situation then we let the devil come and plague us in our minds we let the devil tell us you're a loser we let the devil talk to us we need to stop letting him listening to the devil brother Adam said he chose the mind that's the Battleground and that's where he battles you he don't have any rights quit letting him kick you around brother random says in Colossians 3 and 5. it says and let the peace of God rule in your hearts the word rule there comes from a Greek word that means umpire let the peace of God unpire your heart you know what an Umpire is he's the one that calls the shots let the peace of God call the shots in your heart let the peace of God rule your emotions many of us are many of us we give over to our emotions we get caught up in our emotions and that's why sometimes we we throw anger tantrums and fits and and and we complain is because we get we get we become slaves to our emotions you can't live by your emotions emotions are all right until they're bad it's all right to be emotional in the house of God and have tears running down your eyes and worship than a God and or jumping or shouting or whatever you know but the thing about it is you need to carry that home with you too yeah and when you're faced with the problem listen Jesus said when you spoke evil of and your name is cast out as evil in other words lies been told on you he said you should rejoice in that day he actually just leap for joy in other words have a Hallelujah breakdown he said for so did their fathers of the prophets it's showing your identification friends we're not floating down the stream with the rest of the trash we're going up River and you've got to have the paddle of the Lord to get you upriver the minute you stop paddling that's the moment you start drifting that's the moment you start backsliding inward peace let that be your guide toward doing the will of God if there's something you're looking to do and you can't get peace about it don't do it let the peace of God rule in your heart don't don't let the devil rule your heart don't let your trials and your troubles your tribulations or your persecutions rule your heart let the peace of God rule your heart how can I have peace in the midst of the storm look I was traveling up Thursday night and I listened in on your service while I was driving good service I actually uh told my son who uh my youngest boys going through something and and yesterday I was talking to him and I texted him I said listen to the brother Samuel's service from Thursday I said I think it'll be a real help to you you know how he brought out about the the the the painting of that looked like a storm cloud and when you get up close to it it's actually angel's wings and where he gave that story an example at the end about when you're going through a storm just keep on going there's many people that'll stop and pull off to the side but just keep on going because you know what the storms of life are not eternal okay every situation has an end to it and the thing about it is is how can we uh what opinion do we have of ourselves once we've come through the storm how did we handle ourselves I tell you friends there's things I've come through that I don't ever want to go through again and I I was thinking of those things while I was going through it and I said Lord I want to pass this test because I don't want to face this again you know that you know God's tests are his Mercy to you when he gives you the same test over again that's his Mercy to you he's giving you the opportunity to pass it this time he gave he gave test after test after test to Israel friends that was his mercies he was giving them an opportunity to finally believe him [Music] and every time their unbelief ruled their hearts they couldn't have peace because they wouldn't trust in God how hard is it to trust in somebody that has met every need you've had amen friends look God so cares about your life he cares what you had for breakfast this morning he watches over you he cares about you and friends I'm going to tell you something he actually even allows us some of our wants in this life some of us drive the best cars we didn't have to have that one we could have took a lesser one but God provided the means for us to have it a little luxury you know to make to make trips like brother Samuel makes off the internet you can't depend on a point A to point B card you got to have something you can depend on I'll tell you what friends I remember times my dad going out and preaching and I'll tell you what some of the cars we had was a point A to point B car I remember one of the times dad went and preached over in uh brother McCormick's church and we were coming back we lived in in Saint Mary's at the time and we were coming back home we were traveling I think it was 30 was the route we were traveling on and it it gets there ain't no lights it gets dark and desolate and we and we got to traveling out there you know and the next thing you know we was in a 1971 Ford LTD and as we were traveling down the road all of a sudden the Lights Went Out did the headlights just went out and Dad pulled over to the side of the road and and then the car just quit and dad went up and he opened up the hood and you know my dad wasn't really a mechanic I remember him changing parts but Dad really wasn't a car mechanic and Dad opened up the hood and we were sitting there you know me and myself and my little brother and my grandmother and my aunt and Mom and Dad and we were sitting there in the car and we were sitting there praying and this farmer came along in his truck and he pulled up there and he came over and he had a flashlight we didn't even have a flashlight and he had a flashlight and he shined the flashlight in there and he said get in and try to start it once and my dad got in and the thing fired up and the lights came on dad got out and said I owe you something what can I pay he said I didn't do nothing but Shine the Light in there it was God that touched the car we got the car back home you know and and dad took it down to a mechanic that he always took our cars to and the mechanic says I don't know how in the world you ever got home he said your what was it called Mike did an alternator generator or something like that he said that thing was gone he said you were running on your battery and he said and your battery's dead I don't know how in the world you even got home it was the Lord you know and remembering back sitting in the back seat of that car me and my grandmother and and and my aunt you know she was just a little girl then and and my my brother just a little boy sitting up in the front seat between Mom and Dad I don't remember any complaints out of anybody I don't remember anybody saying well now what is it because it wasn't the first time but you know my dad would go and he would go to he would preach a message about faith and boy he could really tear it up and he preached a message about faith and my mom said every time he preached about faith I know we're getting ready to face something [Music] we're going to face it before we get home and have to use faith and it was faith that God is home it wasn't our complaining it wasn't our bellyaching we didn't complain about the car we was happy that it finally got us home I was a kid I didn't care how it got his home I was just glad to be back home I didn't know anything about uh well you know this alternator is going to cost a certain amount of things and it caused something else to go bad because it was driving it and and I don't even know I'm not a mechanic either I can't even remember the names of all that stuff but there was a little old box that was on the side of it I can remember and and whatever that thing was it went bad too and and uh it somehow was all in line with the electricity of the car and everything you know and uh and so you know but it was God how many remembers of Blizzard of 1977. we were living out in the country you know and there was drifts we had that old 71 Ford and there was drifts higher than the car they brought they brought the National Guard brought equipment out there to plow through the drifts you know and we were driving on the road going between the drifts you know and we were going out to get my grandmother and she lived out in the country out uh quite a distance from us and we my dad and I were going out there and we got out there in the drifts we all the way up to the roof for house we had to walk up the drift to the roof and then walk down them down to get to the door to get her out of there and we got her back to the house you know and and then the storm got worse and then it came worse and then you couldn't even get out on the roads and you know and they were offering people if they needed something you know there was men out there running around on snowmobiles that would bring them something to eat if they needed it or whatever you know and uh we had baked bread and we had uh baked goods and we had you know uh all these things that you know you don't you don't always get you know but we had to make do because you couldn't get out to the stores I was just a young boy I was having a good time buddy there wasn't no school we raised cattle had to walk out and and we didn't have running water to the cattle except for two legs and you know in the summertime we could run a garden hose out there but in the winter time you had to carry buckets of water out there to water the and I'll tell you what buddy they can drink it takes more than a couple of buckets to to you know quench their thirst and carrying water out there and and the storm got so bad you know mom went to help me carry the water out there and we had three buckets I was holding one on this side and she was holding one on that side and then we both grabbed a hole in the middle one in the middle because we couldn't even see the barn from the house because of the the drift and the wind blowing the the snow everywhere the visibility was none and we held on each of that bucket so we wouldn't get separated from one another and carried water out there to to them you know and fed them and took care of them and everything you know and friends I looked back on these times and I remember and as a child you know what I remember no complaining you know that's what your children need to remember they know to remember you trusting God through every time every trial everything your grandchildren friends friends look your grandchildren are affected by you they look at the way you react to things you know what they're doing they're learning they're you're teaching them by example Jesus was our example he didn't complain you're teaching your children by your example how to trust in God and accept what how God is doing something that was the problem with Israel they never wanted to accept how God was taking care of them it was never good enough for them God's supplying your needs friends look I'll tell you let it be good enough for you amen don't let money be the ruling factor in your life because we're going to an economy where it doesn't exist praise God for that there won't be no IRS in the millennium [Laughter] we're going to a time in the Millennium friends where it says that there'll be people coming up and and saying I need rain and as a son and child of God you believe to say I send you rain now what did they need rain for did they need rain to make an Abraham Lincoln or George Washington or Ben Franklin nope you're going to plant your own crops you're going to eat what you plant you're going to build your own house yes that's all part of the millennium we don't we don't live forever in a new city of Jerusalem until after the Millennium and the Earth is burned over and the heavens is burned over and there's a new heavens and a new Earth then the New Jerusalem comes and sits down on the Earth friends look God has prepared a place for us that where he is there we may be also and he's made it according to you what your desires and your wants and your likes are sure we've lost loved ones I've got a family in my church they years ago they lost a little girl when she was I think under the age of 10 they lost her to leukemia you know and then sometime later you know they lost their oldest boy at the age of 45. and you know I say this with with not in any degrading way or whatever but it brought them jock it with us or any other human to ask don't God love us just like you know in the Bible in Psalms where I read you he was questioning God has your mercies forsaken us forevermore and I remember I prayed for this brother and I said God you know the the the young man he had committed suicide and me and his father was the ones that discovered him and it was very traumatic I'll tell you what it sent me into a talespin that lasted for years I feel like I'm just now coming out of it and uh and getting to be myself again and you know he was really going through it and I prayed and I said God there was a time when my dad went beyond the curtain of time and got to see his father I said you let brother Branham during the time when he was grieving over his wife and his daughter you let him go beyond the curtain of time you let him see his wife and his daughter again I said God I'm asking you for this brother's sake let him see his son and that night his son came to him in a vision and his son came to him you know and he had been a little bit heavy set when he passed away but when he came to him he was all slimmed down like he had been when he was about 18 years old and he said he kept rubbing himself like he said look at me Daddy and and he said don't you know we loved you why'd you do what you done don't you know we loved you he said I know you love me but look at me Daddy I'm all right God let him seem so he would know he was all right you know at the funeral I preaching many people you know of course they they're under the stigma say if somebody commits suicide they're internally lost that's a Catholic Doctrine think about Samson Samson's standing between two pillars he said Lord as I take my life let me take the lives of all my enemies with me good yeah and brother Bradham said in the message he said a person could have the Holy Ghost and go totally insane but that's got nothing to do with their soul take their life but that's got nothing to do with their soul it's a mental sickness it's an illness just like diabetes high blood pressure or heart disease but it's in the mind think about it friends Satan chose the mind as his Battleground and you don't think about it a lot of times but there's natural physical things that that have to happen to keep you in your right mind there's there's receptors in your brain and there's transmitters and there's things that's got to fire off and and you've got to be able to produce endorphins and all these other things you know to keep you all right and here we are in our right Minds in a time when the world's going utterly insane in a time where men think and want to be women and women thinking they want to be men and some of them thinking well I don't know if I want to be either one I want you to call me them brother random said before the end time this world would go totally insane that's what they're doing that's what's happening down in Tennessee and Kentucky just here recent some judges passed a a a something to block a a law that was going into effect where they couldn't give minors and children uh uh uh puberty blockers and and and and and hormones and things and they put a block on that to allow them to be able to give this stuff to children they said they went all the way and just stopped short of saying that miners could have surgeries to alter what they was right that's just around the corner they're insane last night I was telling my brother about a a young woman you know down in Tennessee that she I forget now she's about 20 years old or whatever it was but when she was a minor you know her parents she grew up she was kind of like a tomboy and then her parents started encouraging her well then you need to be a boy you know and as a young teenager she had a mastectomy and done all these other things you know and then when she got to be about 19 20 years old she decided I really want to be a woman and she said I can't believe my parents was letting me make life changing decisions when I was a minor parents look brother Adam says it's not juvenile delinquency it's parent delinquency but now we're talking about the things that maybe he talked about at that time now we're talking about all this craziness in the world and yet in the midst of all this crazy you know you can talk to some of these people and friends I'll tell you what they just cannot see what you're telling them they're all about the LBGTQ or whatever in the world they have rights yeah that's what Sodom thought that's right and when they come down you know the Angels come down to deliver a lot out of Sodom remember the the men of the city came and were pounding on lot's door and said give us those men that came in unto you that we might know them you know what know them means in the Bible and not said no I can't do that he said look I've got two daughters their virgins take them do you realize his daughters were married what's that tell you they were married to homosexuals that's what Sodom was destroyed for that's the world we're living in if God doesn't judge this world for all this stuff friends he would have to raise up Sodom and apologize to him think about how much we've got to thank God for he didn't have to open my eyes he could have easily passed me by for the age I was living in was wretched and blind but I heard recognizing your day Hallelujah serving seeds in perfect faith the Rapture and the message of Grace Lord I Thank you in a time when people are are live or live blinded by the organizations that they're under and your eyes have been opened oh what we've got to thank God for thank you Lord what example do we want to be to our children how do we want our children to be as they grow how do we want them to face trials how do we want them to face correction by the Lord I'll tell you something friends my daddy believed in correction and he taught us correction but not only correction but how to take the correction and you know how he taught us to take the correction after he'd whip us he'd say can I come over here and put your arms around my neck and tell me you love me sometimes Jesus corrects you but he loves you and that's why he's correcting you that's why he's not friends look he's that's why he's not letting you go you think of all the people in the world that just live how they want to live and do the the terrible things that they do and it seems like they just go without having to answer for it but God stops you some of you even before you actually even came to the Lord think of the times back in your youth when you was going to do a certain thing or something you had in your mind and something you don't know what something stopped you what was that that was the hand of God over your life even before you gave your life to the Lord friends you didn't start belonging to the Lord when you gave your life to the Lord you belonged to the Lord already that's why you gave your life to the Lord [Applause] I know where I came from and it lets me know where I'm going because I'm going back to where I came from yes Lord amen there's a coming of time when these old bodies and frail that we live in and the and and the the diseases we put up with and the sicknesses that we deal with and the ailments in our bodies there's coming a time when we're going to put off this old flesh house These Bars of bone and doors of clay are going to burst wide open one of these days and we're going to have a new body one that doesn't have heart disease sugar diabetes or high blood pressure or or cancer or anything else right now we need the Divine Healing of almighty God because of the bodies we live in we ought to thank God that he's here to give us that how many times have we faced something God came down and actually healed us friends I I've witnessed in my own church a couple that came and and they came because the the the the wife you know she was diagnosed with cancer and and the cancer was going to take her you know and she came up for prayer and I prayed over you know then I went to the hospital when she was going in and and I prayed you know and they went in there and they come out and they said we can't find no cancer you think she'd have been thankful and actually surrendered her life completely to God but she did not she left the church and went right out and went right back to drugs and everything else people ungrateful for the things God does want we ought to be grateful you say well brother I suffer from this disease or that one or whatever and God hasn't healed me God hasn't delivered me but God's given you the grace to go through it do you ever think sometimes there's things you go through that that once you face it the right way it's actually to be able to help somebody else that's going through something similar my son talked to me on the phone my younger son talked to me on the phone I don't know how many you know but you know we adopted five children and and the youngest one recently uh back toward the end of May he came back he had been gone for three years he came back and he said you are my real mom and dad he said I was looking for love and didn't know what I had he apologized to us for the awful things he had said about us when he left and all these other things and and he surrendered his life to God he was over in North Carolina and he said that he was working over there he is he has to travel for his work sometimes and he was over there and he said and all of a sudden in the middle of the night he had a nightmare of hell and he said and he woke up from it and he said I couldn't do nothing but call out to God he said and God showed me and revealed to me about what real love was and what I'd had had and he'd come back and you know he's going through some trials he said I I'm I'm sowing what I'm reaping what I've sold I know that he said and and but I need some advice dad and so you know we talked a little bit you know I said I'd be praying for him you know and and and and and you know and I wish sometimes you wish there was more you could physically do but you know something friends there's nothing really greater you can do than to point them to the god that has always took care of everything you've ever needed there is nothing greater you can do than to get them to trust in God for whatever they're going through the thing about it is the Bible says he works all things to the good of them that love the Lord even the bad things of Life get turned around and work to come out for your good I'm going to close Proverbs 25 11 says a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver another translation of that is the right word at the right time is like Precious gold set in silver you remember the story of Hattie Wright brother Branham was telling about the squirrels that he spoke into existence and and this and the other and and she sat there and she said that's nothing but the truth and the angel of the Lord come down to brother Branham and said she said the right thing she said the right thing at the right time and he says you tell her that whatever she asks God will give her isn't that the thing that you want your children to the example you want to set for them during the times you end up instead of saying the wrong thing you said the right thing instead of acting the wrong way you acted the right way instead of giving them the example that Israel gave their children you know children friends growing up they'll either turn out to be just like you or or they'll turn out to be just the opposite you know my dad growing up said you know his dad was a drinker and everything else my dad never drank in his life well the end of that story is my grandfather finally gave his life to the Lord and he went on to be with the Lord so you know the end of the story was good but but what could he have lived his life like he said a wrong example a man told me one time he said he was complaining about the way that you know things were in his life and he was making excuses for how he reacted and things like that and he said I didn't have a daddy like you had I said my daddy didn't have a daddy like I had either but look what he done with it I look back at my parents life and friends I'm going to tell you what a Godly example I thank God for the parents he gave me you know I could have been born to anybody but God wanted me to be born to these people and he wanted me to come out the way I am and you know I don't feel bad about the way I am because that's the way God Made Me I only feel ashamed when I don't act right I I feel the same when I don't treat God right you know a lot of times we blame God for things it ain't God it's the devil don't blame God you know I told you about the young man that died at 45 you know some wanted some wanted to blame God you couldn't blame God he was the man that when I moved down there he wouldn't serve in the Lord and he was driving trucks long distance over the road you know being gone for weeks at a time and I went out and I when I first got down there I went out and I got me a little Rottweiler puppy you know and I really like that breed they just think but you know I I I really like them and I read all about them that's just how the kind of person I am I just got to know all about them and so I went over to his daddy's house and he was out there and we set out you know we were sitting on a picnic table and sitting out there and I I just talked to him about Rottweilers the whole time and after I left you know he told his daddy he said I ain't never met a preacher like that before he said not one time did he tell me you need to be in church said all he did was sit there and talk to me about dogs the whole time he said I never met a preacher like him he said I think I want to come to church and he came and he sat back there and when he came a message I was preaching was on marriage and divorce and I think that time you know and forgive me today I'm holding you longer but I think at that time I had to preach three hours and so he came up to the front afterwards you know and there was a lot of people came up to the front to be prayed for and when I saw him come to the front I just felt pulled to him and I went down there and waded through everybody that was standing there until I got back to him and laid my hands on him and he gave his life to the Lord the thing about it was friends he had went through something mentally some years before when he was 25. and you know and he he you know then was talking about taking his life but he wasn't ready to go and he was he he had mental illness there's nothing wrong with that it ain't no different than having diabetes there's nothing to be ashamed about it but I'll tell you this God can heal you just the same as he can heal you from anything else sure he's give doctors and knowledge and different things to try to help you but they can only go so far but here here some 20 years later he'd lose his life but he was ready to go I told him about the story of brother random talking about this this woman that he had went and prayed for you know and and said God healed her and then she told her husband she said I'm going home he said yep you're going to get out you're going to go home she said no that's not the home I'm talking about she said I'm going home and she died brother Bradham said he told God you owe me an answer you owe me an explanation he said you know what God did he said God let me sit and stew for about a month he said and then God told me he said go ask her mother about a time back when she was younger if she drowned brother Brandon went and asked her he said yeah she drowned but they revived her and the Lord told Brother Brown see she wasn't ready to go back then he said so I got her ready to go and then I took her God knows what you're going to face down the road Hallelujah my grandfather you know he gave his life to the Lord and he lived for seven months after giving his life to the Lord and the Lord took him home at the age of 54. young now you young people that you think that's old but I'm standing up here this morning I'm gonna tell you 54 is Young but there was things that happened on down the road within the church where we were at and things that came out that probably would have stumbled my grandfather if he would have lived to have seen it but God took him when he had him ready and then when my dad had the experience and testimony that he is giving you here of going beyond the curtain of time and seeing his daddy his daddy was there you know there's people that have loved ones and children and that they're lost friends I'll tell you what what you need to do is turn them over to God and say God you do whatever it takes it doesn't matter if it takes them from this life friends I'm going to tell you something spending uh the the you know life in Psalms 91 it says life's like a blade of grass job says it's like a flower it wilts it doesn't last very long having having them in this life for just a little bit of time and losing them for eternity what's that but having them for eternity thank God to save your soul if you got to bring them down to death I know I'll see them on the other side let's stand I'm sorry for holding you along you're probably used to it [Laughter] laughs Heavenly Father we thank you Lord to be here this morning we thank you for your word Lord ask God that this message that we've heard this morning Lord let it ever remain in our
