don't know sister soriano i think most of you do i remember brother rauel soriano and they had been coming here since 2000 so we met one another right when paul was born paul was only a few weeks a few weeks old and so it just was a it's always it's been a great blessing a great friendship and i can say this without any reservation this this assembly has benefited and has rose higher because of the ministry of brother roe el soriano and there is many many times that with the services that you know and i always i appreciate you know this i appreciate all of god's gifts and i just stand there you know and you just my i'm just amazed how god will just take and work through that gift and i'm glad that every gift is so unique and so different you know it's like putting the variety around your house what good does it do if all you have is all white flowers now if you have that don't get offended but i mean you know there's contrast there's variety there's highs and lows and when things bloom and i'm just grateful for all the gifts of god and so to also know that the ministry uh it would not have been what it was without sister soriano standing behind it and so we just it's it's a it's a real honor sister cerano that you would you would be here with us amen and we just are thankful to the lord for that and so we just want to certainly make make her feel welcome and also to

and minister to every need that's gathered here lord whether it be in the physical realm lord the spiritual realm we know that god that this glorious gospel you've sent to us lord not only brings healing to the soul but it brings healing to the spirit and the body as well and we're so thankful for that lord we ask that you just lord be with us now in these next few moments in the name of jesus christ amen amen we invite you to the scriptures to where we've been reading from here and in first john chapter 2 and we'll read there and then i've got some other places i want to go to quickly and just further setting the background here this morning first john chapter 2 verse 12 i write unto you little children because your sins are forgiven you for his name's sake i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i write unto you young men because ye have overcome the wicked one and i write unto you little children because ye have known the father and i have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i have written unto you young men because you are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated would you turn with me to john chapter 14 as well and as you're turning there to john 14 as we look into this passage of scripture i want you to notice that in what we have read here this morning i have written unto you fathers and in those three scriptures it would seem as though that john is repeating but is not repeating there's a purpose in this writing and it's not something that john is doing on his own but john is under the leadership of the holy spirit and when he's writing to that of the fathers the children to the young men to all that are there there's a purpose and how many know that their god in christ we have a purpose you know there's a lot of things that we can go through life and you can try to find out what your purpose is and the scripture will always declare there is one central purpose when paul writes through the inspiration of the holy spirit to titus he lets us know that our our purpose and calling was brought to light through the manifestation of jesus christ paul also writes in the book of romans that all things that come about in our life work together for the good to them that are called according to his purpose within the purpose of god because the purpose of god is that our lives would be dramatized by the holy spirit that we would be born again that's what the prophet would set forth by the scriptures that's the main purpose that we're here on earth to do but all of the other purposes father mother all of those things when you know you go into the adoption series and brother branham lays that out very clearly in the adoption series he says where you have served god's purpose as a housewife as a father as a mother as a doctor he goes through all of those parts because those parts are not just menial parts but a very significant part within the purpose of almighty god and so whatever when you look at even in your life and you know occupation whatever it is there's a purpose in your life from a young person middle age on and on and let me just say this to you so you to draw comfort from it and it also uh really uh stirs us that as long as we're here upon this earth god's purpose is still going forward in our lives there's no retirement from the purpose of god you know god doesn't hand out a golden buckeye card for you know the purpose of god you've served your years but what happens is this transitions that happens in our lives and those are things that we realize as long as we're here there's a purpose and a reason and that's why brother brahms said when god is finished and the purpose my purpose has been served here on earth that i'm ready to go home it's just like a person acting out in a drama once their part is done they they go off the stage but as long as they're out here and they're awaiting they are coming into their purpose now that purpose i'm thankful that even the purposes that are clear in our life father mother and those whatever even if the things that god has revealed with your occupation and the things that you do those things continually are unfolded by the holy spirit because all of it is in god we we don't find out well you know uh you know i'm a nurse and i found out i was a nurse because so and so no that was already packed within your life it was already there remember when god revealed to moses in the vision the tabernacle god said by the way i have already put in men like bezel the spirit of wisdom they are skilled to do these things you and i come to understand what the skills and things that god has placed within us no man you might say well i learned this trade from so and so the skill was already in you those things were already in you and to think how god could actually move and direct that within our life because he is jehovah jireh god that even what he's placed in your life it is god testifying i am jehovah jireh i have not put you here without there being provision isn't that a comfort in everything of our life now our sometimes our stress and our part of it is trying to figure out all of that but i'm glad we don't have to figure it out we just look to him we look to god we're praying and feeding on the word of god and look with an expectation for inspiration to come and to direct us i'm speaking by experience on there i have written unto you so there's there's a purpose that god has set forth there within our life and i want to read here out of john chapter 14 verse 4 and here hear the lord jesus speaking with the disciples and he says whether i go ye know and the way ye know and thomas said unto him lord we know not whether thou go us and how can we know the way so he's told them you know the way and thomas saying but how we don't know the way how what what is the way and notice jesus says i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me so the way was not a written code the way was a person now this person who is the way it was matching all that the word had prophesied so when the word so the way becomes known when the word itself becomes manifest in the light so the lord jesus is declaring to them i am that way you've known the way lord where's the way where's the no i am the way the truth and the life so person so truth uh doctrine is not it's not it's not uh or truth is not confined to doctrine truth is the person of jesus christ truth is not an anointing truth is the person of jesus christ it's not a teaching it's the person of jesus christ and because let me just say it in this way when we that person because you can't have a relationship with a doctrine that's right you can't have a relationship with the teaching but you can have a relationship with the person of jesus christ and when you have a relationship with him you are partakers of all that he is isn't that wonderful in the things that we don't know how to explain we have instant access to him not that the answer is going to come right away but to think about it you're not going through and making a call and saying i've got to find out about this and shhh sends you offshore to india and you're getting a call over that no you have direct connection direct connection by relationship with him i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth ye know him and have seen him philip said unto him lord show us the father and it sufficeth us jesus said unto him how have i been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father how sayest thou then show us the father believeth thou not that i am in the father and the father in me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very work's sake so jesus is letting it he's declaring it's not me that is doing this it is my father that dwelleth in me he's the one if you if you can't believe or grasp my words believe the works that you see to know that this is something that is greater than just human instrumentality so you know it's just like uh i think it was brother royale when he stood there when he first started the mystery expos and he went into was it a lutheran church at first they went into so they go in and one of the things that was spoken that they spoke to brother roell eventually here it just comes to me and they said we have been taught in seminary to debate your doctrines but they said one thing that we cannot debate and that's the life you can't debate the life you can try to you know just like when they want to try to come against this message you can't deny vindication from almighty god you can try to tear down the vessel you can try to do all those things but but i tell you that doesn't leave a very good outlook for you god vindicated his message and god vindicates it by his life and remember this is why over and over remember they would tell brother branham and they would say to him you don't have very good grammar oh boy you know this and that and so forth and brother brad said i may not know the book too well brother branham was not promoting not reading the word but he's letting it be known he says i don't know the maybe he said i don't know the book real well but he said i know the author and that's what's most important it's not getting us to an understanding of and please understand what i'm going to say it's not an understanding of the doctrines but you've got to meet jesus christ because when you meet him he's the one who breaks the bread to you personally he's the one who takes the word as it's coming in and as an inside teacher he's the one that alert and now there's been a quickening and alerting and you're beginning to hear his voice and remember that holy spirit begins to warm that seed on the inside nothing else will do that he's the one that begins to draw it out in quickening and bringing about a growth and a transformation in your life is that right and now let me just say this very clearly you can't know the lord jesus christ in a personal relationship if you remove the message of the hour because the message of the hour is the unfolding of jesus christ for who he really is down into the church of the living god that's what the stars are in the right hand is to reveal bypass seminaries bypass man's ideas bypass everything and to reveal his presence down into the church aren't you glad for that god has reserved those channels to reveal his presence to reveal his glory to reveal his person to reveal himself so we are not under the ideas of man and we're not saying that critically but we're saying it because it's life in this hour we there is a call let me say this to you there's a call in this hour i know there's not many christian bookstores left but you could go through i've been through them i've been through big ones their second few floors and on and on and on and you can look at the amount of books that are in there that deal with leadership you know why there's a cry for leadership and how that the spirit of god in this hour that he who is the way the truth and the life has come down to lead the church of the living god and i'm not just talking about out here in front but i'm talking about to bring the leadership so that it goes beyond the carnal mind it goes beyond the flesh goes beyond the baptism in the spirit and it goes to the quickening of the soul because leadership is not something in our flesh it's not in our spirit leadership is that on the inside of our lives when the spirit of truth is come he will lead and guide you into all truth so if the spirit you have cannot agree even with one truth you better check the spirit you have are you hearing me now because the word the bible said the holy ghost comes he said it's given in my name and i just say it in this way we're living in a moment at a time where there is no other clarity no other clarity anywhere else in the outside of the message of the hour and when i'm saying that of the message of the hour i am speaking of jesus christ because that's who this message is that's who this message come to reveal god did not hand it to a man and ask a man to clutter it up in seminary god had to have a vessel not even having a seventh grade education that would be able not to declare his own self but to declare jesus christ in this hour we have not been introduced to a man we have been introduced to jesus christ that's why when we read the bible we're not looking back and reading history where we can talk about a man who walked up and down the shores of galilee and one who wrote in the old fish you know we're created he's still the same god and he never hallelujah died paid the price and that same quickening power rose back up on that easter morning and he took that body and ascended on high and the holy spirit has come right back down into the church of the living god to continue what was done in the body of jesus now in the body of the bride [Applause] so his purpose was to show the father our purpose is to show the father hallelujah so i want to speak here just for a few moments on godly leadership that cultivates godliness godly leadership because to remember there's a lot of leadership a lot of voices vying for to lead us pop-up ads and everything else but godly leadership that cultivates godliness now in in genesis 18 verse 17 the bible said and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do now here's the revealing of the son of man here is here is abraham has now received a visitation once again remember he met melchizedek same god now here he's abraham receives a visitation here god has stepped down with two angels and abraham being in the presence of god abraham recognizes there's something spiritual about this man now here's what he does this is the thing abraham doesn't know all that's going on but you see he's had enough experiences with god and he is of god he is a friend of god that now when that comes there now abraham look what in we're not going to read those verses but i want you to notice what abraham does he entertains elohim he entertains and remember entertaining elohim here here stands the living god el shaddai veiled in a flesh veil are you with me yes sodom didn't receive that visitation can i say it in this way it would not have had the effect on sodom yes sir god god is not under a perhaps or a maybe this word when god sends his word to you it's not a mistake you haven't got somebody else's mail in your mailbox god has sent this message to you you might try to run from it you might try to put all the sorts of excuse but you can't run away from the foreknowledge of god the prodigal son went about his own way he thought he could find satisfaction out there but let me tell you something that didn't disturb god one bit because god's purpose can never be defeated [Applause] hallelujah but here's what abraham did he entertained elohim you see when he comes in these services it's important that you entertain him it's important that even after the service is over you entertain him make him feel welcome invite the word just allowing the word just opening up of your life it's important because if we do not entertain him the holy spirit will just he'll he'll leave as quick as he comes you understand what i'm saying i'm not talking about working you up into something i'm saying sometimes that where we're at listen as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man we're living in times of we can say busyness so this is busy and i've got this and and look i tell you what sometimes you look and film you're wondering as far as how we're timing where things fit in we're trying to fit things in let me just say it in this way this is where we have to have a real heart to heart with ourselves and say let's let's really evaluate this here am i really entertaining elohim because when you entertain him then the scripture is fulfilled of second corinthians 3 that in the presence of god we are changed from glory unto glory even as by the presence of the lord [Applause] right that's why let me say this spiritual growth is not dependent exclusively upon the pastor are you hearing me i don't i don't pour out miracle grow or any other minister they don't pour it on me when they're ministering but you see what the word does the word comes that we might entertain his presence and pray over what we're hearing if you look at it you'll begin to see you begin to see a part and i'm sure we could witness this you'll begin to see the messages you've listened to here and things you've been reading the bible you're like all of a sudden as the words being minister you're like i just read that or or something was said maybe not verbatim but it connects with something else you're hearing you say brother samuel what is that that's being in fellowship and entertaining elohim you'll recognizing him and continue to allow him to so saturate your life because he is the way for everything everything shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him what a responsibility for i know him o glory that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him let me just say this god is not resting his plan and purpose upon the shoulders of flesh god's plan and purpose it rests only upon his word note in this here god is letting it be known how can you know god's standing there and saying i know him what does god know god knows the dna god knows the gene god knows that abram is of him and god knows that what god knows is that though words itself and the enemy can come in and try to work on words but god knows the revelation that has come and the presence of god can never be defeated are you hearing me satan could come against that of the prodigal son he can war against words but there's one thing he couldn't get out of that prodigal son and that's the presence of the father he knew back home hallelujah hallelujah this is why it becomes surreal when the message of the hour when the presence of god comes across your pathway and god begins to deal with our heart and as you're sitting there longing wondering why you can never fit in here fit in there and while there was never a settling is because you were ordained to dwell in jesus christ and when the presence of god begins to break over your life there begins to be an unfolding of the reality that i was there i am one of those morning stars that shouted for glory before the foundation of the world because right now i am delighted in the salvation of the lord that god has come he has set me free he is working in my life he has brought a deliverance in my life and i belong to him so with abraham i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord remember the way of the lord is not just a teaching it's the person it's the person of jesus christ the presence of the lord now you think of it in this way the lord god revealing himself to abraham it would be brought forth responsibility and purpose if you remove the leadership of the holy spirit from abraham's life he's like any other man shifting by his own ideas leaning to his own understanding move from here move to there this one day is an absolute years change now this is an absolute we're living in a day like that where there used to be an absolute that god created male and female now over time what's happened now people's absolute that one time could hold to that now it's changed you know what it showed that was a false that was a false absolute in their life not that that was wrong you understand me now not that that was wrong but that it wasn't embedded in their life the way it needed to be because the real absolute is that of christ being in our life so not that of male and fe that is a true absolute and god regard restores that god makes that known by his presence but so it's we're not lifted we're not left to shift for ourselves aren't you glad for that i'm glad for clear direction and leadership in this hour i'm grateful for a godly leadership that cultivates godliness you see the voice it was the same voice that spoke to abraham and let abraham know that you are a hebrew meaning one who is from beyond god's the one that revealed that to abraham and abraham's life testified he was a hebrew there had never been a word brother random identifies because we can see he came out of the earth how d that abraham was a gentile right but hebrew is one from beyond and abraham never called himself that but when lot was in trouble they said go find abram one who is from beyond one who has a source of strength and power and dominion above this world glory be to god in the highest oh my it's that same voice that comes and confirms to our hearts so abraham with a personal revelation in his life of the presence of the lord he was setting forth the ways of the lord now i want you to think of this very clearly we can look and see christ in abraham's life is that right we know how the prophet would lay it so clearly in christ uh the mystery of god revealed he would say if you read the bible and you don't see christ in every verse go back and read it again because you've missed it because this is the this this bible is is that burden and desire and expression of one goal that god has had and that is that god might be one with his children then if all of his attributes all that he was would be expressed think of this his expression of his attributes are not are not only uh uh times of you know of salvation that's an attribute but he's also a healer times when we need healing whether in a physical body or our spirit he's a healer in other words there's not a situation or a need that can arise in your life that he doesn't already have the answer for and he is the answer he doesn't call us in a prescription and say go pick it up he says i am your medicine i am i am i am i am i am we can look and see christ in abraham's life in other words faith was visible christ was displayed let us break in here in genesis 22 verse 7 and isaac spake unto abraham his father now here is isaac and abraham going up remember god has called abraham and spoke to him offer up thine only son and isaac speaks to his father and says my father and he said here i am my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering now i want you just to zero in on this what do you see here first of all you see that there is an understanding we can't worship without a sacrifice now right here he's 16 17 18 years old may i say it in this way teeny bopper yours teenager years right but notice where this is at my father so not only does he have an understanding that worship requires a sacrifice he's there's an understanding the way of the lord has has been expressed but it's not just something that's been expressed he's aware of what's going on he's not asking what's this wood about what's this fire about what's this about so isaac is moving in a way he understands these parts so there's an understanding about his life you say brother samuel well yeah we understand that but no do we really understand that that worship is a sacrifice we worship through the sacrificial offering of the lord jesus christ and as our life has become a sacrifice we must become a sacrifice and when our lives have become a sacrifice then christ moves on the inside and then through our lives it's a continual sacrifice is it not so it's letting it be known here we worship by sacrifice oh glory we you know it's a training hey son you know not everybody's going to think like you do as far as maybe you're not going to agree with this brother so-and-so and sister so and so or or this or that or somebody might step on your toes but understand to worship requires a sacrifice and that can even be your feelings your ideas your thoughts your opinions hallelujah so these are things that he understands the other part there is relationship here relationship between a father and his son see we see christ being depicted here is that right packing the wood up the hill packing it up to calvary that portrayed there but but his relationship because remember what what god was in christ it restoring that relationship that was lost in the fall and that was a relationship where god was back in man in other words the favor oh my if i can say it and just kind of pull back into a gear that in the manner that isaac had had that that abraham had even the favor of isaac isaac did not say you peg you packed the wood i don't feel like it you know i work at mcdonald's now you know i work two hours a day you pack the wood you know you know i mean i take out the trash i take out the treasure mcdonald's i'm being you see i'm going somewhere not even in this service altogether but i'm getting somewhere with this the word is comes to be very practical in our life are you with me and not just left out here the revelation continues to unfold just as much as that revelation is opening like that of a roman candle within it the opening doesn't make it more obscure wow wow no it brings it when it opens it unfolds itself down into our lives in a practical manner is that right that's why brother branham could stand in the church age book and speak of how that christ could could deal with uh encouraging the right and discouraging the wrong and brother braham said we could all learn a lesson here for running our churches our homes and our families so no there's relationship and there's respect respect my pops my father oh brother samuel that's old school no no i'm talking bible don't use society's language on me don't try to use sodom's perversion on me i'm talking bible language somebody's got to stand in this hour i'm just going to be very frank with you i think it's one of the most disrespectful things to hear a young man or a young lady call their mom or dad by their own name god gave you that father and that mother and you address them with with respect that's a promise in the bible children obey your parents in the lord for that is the first commandment with promise of life because if you can't honor father and mother then who you're going to honor how can you honor god you can't honor god correctly are you hearing me that's why we look at relationships we'll get relationships when i tell that of young people look at relationships in the family look at relationships how they are because those relationships all of a sudden things just don't all of a sudden change and all of a sudden now this is a perfect relationship i do believe and we all believe that there is a paradox of the new birth don't we so let's not let's not put that aside but i i believe that there are things to be able to look at with relationship and respect and notice abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together my what a journey abraham is trusting his father are you hearing me so in other words even in this right here it is another part of it that isaac has been not just taught not just instructed not just a picture on the wall with the pillar of fire but isaac has been instructed the supernatural is in our home the supernatural is present god is not far off god is present and to recognize how many times you think that isaac was was told in his life isaac you're a product of the supernatural now it doesn't bypass that you've got to have your own experience isaac but i want you to know that your life is a product of the supernatural so it's these things are are present within that of the home now let's go to deuteronomy chapter 4 verse 7 and looking at this responsibility my for what nation notice as god is speaking here to israel for what nation is there so great who hath god so nigh unto them as the lord our god is in all things that we call upon him for i say thank you lord i'm so glad about that aren't you moses making them aware who that god is so knight to us of all the things that we're calling on him for and what nation verse eight is there so great that has statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which i set before you this day only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen unless they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life but teach them thy sons and thy son's sons see a purpose that goes it's ongoing not just in that that of our immediate family those of you that are grandparents those of us if god terrors that will be grandparents this there is there is a responsibility that we have before us teach them thy sons and thy sons now notice how moses directs their focus and he wants this right here is that's very important verse 10 especially the day that thou stood us before the lord thy god in horeb when the lord said unto me gather me the people together and i will make them hear my words that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the earth that they may teach their children so the presence of god that for all of the teaching that is to be done it's not just we do this and we don't do that we there needs to be that instruction in righteousness can you say amen to that there needs to be that in other words god is letting him know you've been in the presence of god and that is what you're to be moved by motivated by that's what all teaching is based on is your relationship with almighty that there's something beyond words that's being communicated it's the presence of god i i just believe this with all my heart there's more scriptures i could read upon this but i believe with all of my heart that god's desire is as that same glory that was revealed and moses would come down and that glory with this countenance would shine that that same glory would descend upon the father that glory would descend upon the mother that glory would descend upon the children in other words the glory did not stay back in a visitation of a supernatural cloud but what took place there has come all the way down into the home and he can't get there without channels so it's not by chance that here we are standing in this moment but the glory of god has come upon us and with that glory is a responsibility and the responsibility is is for us to get out of the way for us to yield our lives to god and for us to be purposeful in the things that we do may i say it in this way bringing our children to church is not enough it's important but it's not enough it must be descended into the home the glory was meant to be descended in the home just as much as this glory was to be descended there when you go even into the workplace it is the glory of god that you're veiling in your life you know i'm not way out somewhere i'm preaching right in the scriptures here we're talking about the glory of god what was there where that when moses was veiled that eventually was to move behind badger skins and it would be the same glory and that same glory is what comes to you and i what is the glory of the lord it is the revealing of his presence the revealing of his person so he is like that precious ointment that we spoke of last week that moves down remember this is why brother branham would take in what house will you build me how many of you listen to that message what house will you build me okay about five of you okay what house will you build me my 30th 30 30 some minutes brother brown was not only dealing with where the message is at he's dealing with the local assembly he's dealing with homes and responsibilities because what he's seeing is he's seeing kids out on sunday riding on bicycles and it's burdened him to such a place that he's asked god lord that there be a place that the people can gather and actually hear the message it was a burden upon his heart i'm glad that god has answered that burden not just for there but i'm glad god answered it here aren't you i'm glad i have a place that i can i can go and and and hear the word of the lord and the presence of god moves down in our lives i'm very grateful for that so the message and brother bran would make this statement he says the message of the hour is not just to be the light and the flame of the world it's to be the flame in our hearts or we can't rightly present it so the message is not a doctrine the message is not a teaching the message is the person of jesus christ revealed to where you and him he and i will become one is that right so now thinking of with abraham where brother brahma is drawing this from and i just want to read a few places here and brother branham makes this statement he says in the hebrew series he says your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be now notice not our teaching that's important i'm not going there today but our attitude toward christ that makes an impression think what would think when abraham came into back into his home in abraham's home he had received an impression from god that impression upon his life that changed his life because remember the bible says in hebrews 11 that that that by faith sarah receives strength to conceive and you realize in the message believing god brother braham said i've never he says believed it was sarah's faith that created the miracle it was abraham's faith you say that's contradictory to scripture no it's not because the faith that you and i have we have our own individual faith is that right but the holy ghost is the faith of almighty god so it was the faith of elohim the faith of el shaddai that was moving in godly leadership into that of the home so abraham was only a channel that god could move through abraham could not change sarahs listen even as abraham was standing there in the home abraham could not change her thinking about herself but when abraham being there it invited elohim to come down and do what he could not do abraham said it's real to me it's personal to me but god i need you and let me say this lord that welcome mat out there of my tent is not for sodom that welcome matt is for your presence glory be to god in the highest hallelujah your attitude towards christ will make a great impression on what your children will be that's a powerful statement our attitude towards christ makes that impression your life that you live before your family will make an impression on what your children will be now no way is brother rand talking that that where everything that we do is perfect that you know when you go to your home my goodness you know the the angels just gather there and you know they're there you eat donuts with angels every morning and you know and you that's not what he's saying because a real christian life it is not and i'm not demeaning anything here but a real christian life is not about perfection in ourselves it's a love affair with jesus christ and let me say this we can fool a lot of people a lot of times but you can't fool everybody all the time whatever you love is gonna come out you can't hide it it will come out in your life and that's why it cannot be i who liveth it's got to be christ because he is the way the truth and the life your life that you live before your family and make an impression on what your children will be because the bible said he would visit the iniquity of the parents upon the children to the third and fourth generation now if iniquity is visited and it is right is that right then righteousness is also visited i i don't know about you but i believe we feel the same way i want to be part of where righteousness can flow that's what i want to be i want to be just a part where as a channel that righteousness can flow because knowing we need elohim we need el shaddai moving down in our homes and we always want to be in a place that he's welcome well why it's coming to me i'm just going to go ahead and preach when elohim was on his way down the road remember in the tent that morning brother branham tells us it is anything too hard for the lord he said they had had a scuffle in the tent that morning oh my lord abraham and sarah had a scuffle or his brother john lafontaine said how did he say that heated discussion a heated fellowship that's what he used to say he did fellowship now think of that here god is coming down the way that didn't stop god but that evidently evidently had to be that of grace that was given somebody had to say forgive me i'm sorry because remember it didn't keep the presence of god away brother and sister let me tell you something repentance is powerful don't hold on to anything in your life don't make excuses for it repent when you know it's wrong because what that does is open a channel for el shaddai to come down oh glory be to god it'll make an impression an effect upon someone think of this effect in second timothy chapter 1 verse 5 when i call to remembrance paul speaking to timothy when i call and remembers the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i am persuaded that in thee also paul is identifying this same faith that he saw now it wasn't just the faith of his grandmother uh lois and his mother eunice it was a faith that motivated their faith you understand what i'm saying in the church ages god commends one of the ages and says i have seen your faith and brother bram says notice god's not talking about his faith there he's talking about their faith you see we need our faith but we need our faith to be under the influence of his faith are you with me it lifts us from just uh having that of intellectual faith and and that faith within our life it lifts us in a godly faith we need that now what god was commending them was their actions their works and what was coming out of their life so now this faith i've seen it now let me just let me just skip over a part of that in that in that quote there are the message why brother brand picks it up again he says in that second paragraph your life will impress your children how many know the world is just dying to impress your children you know everybody that's fake on facebook now i'm not saying everybody's got facebook is fake because i know i'm speaking to an older congregation older generation you guys are the facebook people the younger ones are the snapchats see i had to kind of go in and study about this over weeks but everybody gets under pressure and trying to impress somebody they've got these influencers come on now amazon just two weeks ago had them out there in arizona paid them them people make they went influencing market went from 1.3 billion to 13.8 billion like that influencers some of the garbage they wear i wouldn't even put on my dog i mean the influence you see i understand what i'm trying to say everything is trying to come to bring an impression your life will impress your children have influenced your children by the example you set before them and i think it's a good thing that we put every effort did you see that every effort we can before our children as godly parents how many say help me lord because it takes sacrifice every effort there's things that we've got to override because we override if we don't they're only following our example they're only following that they have an image and that image is something that though the prophet is bringing it he's ministering it and they hear it ministered here but it's your life that has the greatest impact in other words it's your life that becomes the pictorial display of what the message is all about oh god help us to have the right kind of billboards right i don't want my life looking like one of these mcdonald hamburgers on the billboard and you get in there it looks like an elephant stomped on it it looks like lettuce nobody else even an earthworm wouldn't eat that lettuce well they might want to sue me now right i mean it don't even look right which we want a true representation because our lives are not just something that's a billboard it's a living example of jesus christ and let me tell you something he's the only one that can help our children he's the only one that can help our loved ones and we want for goodness sake we want to have the right influence that there's an impression of they'll shady i upon their lives it points them to jesus christ make an example be an example i don't think there's any greater example as godly parents than full obedience to the word of god there's a lot in this i'm not going to go down to try to bring everything and every little point down that'll come but notice everybody all right seat belts on okay i'm going to read something here now seat belts on out of the message elisha the prophet brother graham said how can you expect your children to go to sunday school and serve the lord when you yourself don't even go how can you expect your children to be something when you're nothing he said that's a little sassy but i don't mean it that way he said he had me to say it this is not premeditated i didn't mean you wasn't nothing but i mean when you know that you make no profession how can you expect your children to be righteous when you're putting such an example before them how can you do that you're the best example that they have i tell you if that ought to let it sink down to the fifth rib you don't have to be a theologian mama daddy god has not called you and ordered you that you have to be able to sit there and go write down the message and this quote and but god has ordained you to be a gospel that's living and in action faith is built in your life mama when something rises there in the home you say let's pray what's it doing it's a training that you know what something comes up let's pray let's talk to the lord about this let's go to god in prayer let's pray about this it's making known the way of the lord it's an example about this hallelujah so it's it's it's a right example you're the best example that they have they're going to look to you and they won't look for no one else is a big statement because your nature is in them and we can say in that well help them jesus oh i can see i can see me in my voice but sam you got browning dna browning dna and ain't no better than anybody else's dna sanchez dna whatever your last name is you can tack it on it ain't better than nobody else's dna scientists aren't hitting you up for a blood sample to try to replicate your dna you and i are still all of us are filled with junk and we need the grace of god the overcoming power to lift us in overcoming grace if there's anything good that's come out of our life it's because of the grace of god don't ever elevate a man your nature is in them so you know what that means as a priest you're able to understand them you're able to pray for them and intercede for them know how to minister to them know what reaches them even when it comes to discipline not what you think reaches them not going to go there no we don't want parenting.com magazines all right we don't want space space track theology come on friends we see what you know why all that is is because they got away from the word of god when you get away from the word you go into confusion your nature is in them so who better who better could help them hopefully you're a pastor but remember you understand them you know the struggles in your own life that you go through come on somebody that's why you're able to look as you're praying and working with them as as a priest that is there you understand their struggles that's how you're able to pray for them in a way of intercession because you know their makeup [Music] [Laughter] i won't tell you which one but when i go to talk to my boys there's times that i can talk to them and and especially i can look and say as i'm talking and that grin breaks out across the face i said yeah i know you know how i know because you're like me [Laughter] and the same way that the holy ghost has given me grace he didn't rip it out of my life but he just sat down in the seat of authority god said like nehemiah i'm not changing the fish gate from the sheet gate through it no no no we're just going to put them under the right order we're going to put the locks and gates and bars we're going to set back down in our rightful position we've been brought out of babylon and we're setting back now in position of authority so your nature is in them able to to really to intercede and to minister on their behalf you remember when the they would apply the blood in the in in in in the home there in the passover and they would apply that blood i have the scripture but i'm not going to read it but they were to strike it so the blood taking the lamb killing the lamb and then applying the blood so the plying of the blood it went up on the doorpost and the lintel brother branham was so careful to point out to you and i in the message he said i want you to notice that the blood was not put on on that of the bottom it was put above because we're never to walk over the blood we're always to have the blood above us so that we're looking up to christ glory be to god he said brother samuel what does that mean so that in our life it's christ that's lifted in glory in power in our lives to where we're not treating the word of god as that's not necessary that's not important brother ram was a little bit too much this way oh that's brother samuel's thoughts that's brother samuel's thinking and that's what listen friends i would encourage you if you feel like that something is my thinking come sit down with me because i don't want to preach my thinking i don't want my thoughts going on here because my thoughts do not have life in them but it's to have christ exalted and it's not just it's not just and i just i'm going to say it very frankly it's not just enough to have the picture on the wall or to have it in a bookshelf but he's got to be exalted in our actions not just we associate around the message or we believe the message we believe the message no it's got to be that the message is flesh inside of us there's a fervency inside of our lives brother samuel that's old-fashioned that's old-fashioned religion let me tell you it was good for peter it was good for paul it was good for all of them a good old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost you can't be set on fire and then sit still the fire of god is leadership that comes to lead you not just to come upon you and pull back off of you come upon you pull back off of you you don't want just a baptism of the holy ghost you want the person of jesus christ he is the way so it needs is to be exalted in other words our home is under the order and the leadership of the lamb of god he is our safety he is our life he's our shepherd he's our deliverer he's our healing he's our counselor he's our advocate he is our life everything every decision revolves around him the way our home i'm just speaking from my heart here the things that in our home where i have looked to set that order and from in this church is from the message of the hour and the bible are you hearing me not from so and so not from this i want it because there's safety in the lamb of god i don't want to see how close i can get to the world i don't want to reason with something i want to order that now let me just let me just say this brother samuel have you been perfect i've not been perfect but you can take every one of these and if you want to take them in the back room and you want to ask them and say has your daddy ever made mistakes and they can tell you yes and ask them when i've had to come to him and say forgive me i was wrong for either bringing this in or this being said because you know what i want them to know what's right i'm not interested in samuel browning being glorified in their eyes i want jesus christ to be set in their eyes so it's setting the right and this isn't this isn't deep things it isn't setting the writing remember it's not teaching in that of just word if you'll notice how the holy spirit has said this this morning the most important teaching and what makes them the words come back is that of the presence of god that makes an impression upon that life can i just speak very plainly this is why in this hour it's so important for lives mama daddy and different ones it's important you know where you belong it's important you know what church you belong it's not belonging to a church but to have a revelation who your pastor is because if you move every time you're offended guess what your children will follow that pattern because what you've showed them is is that when you disagree with somebody if it's at work quite if you don't agree with the pastor go somewhere else now look if anybody is led to go anywhere else i say god bless you i've never tried to keep anybody here those of you that are here you know that even those that i prayed about when you've had jobs i'm not i'm not god knows who's supposed to be here that's not from me you've never none of you've ever heard had this nor anybody outside i've never i can take this to record never told anybody to come here to church because why i'm not your revelation jesus christ has to reveal that to you because there's time because he himself is the one that holds the mystery of your life i don't he's the one that is going to speak to you personally for your home for every part of your life i don't know that he knows even how your nature how things are set forth and look as a pastor i also begin to know that as well how different ones are natured remember how remember how brother branham billy balls and they're watching you know brother brandon how brother brahma is handling different things because we're all sheep is that right oh i just love the lord don't you god is so mindful of all of all of our needs and i say it in this way this is why we want to set the right example we have to be purposeful very purposeful very intentional on the things even that what we're doing on how that we're pressing forth in our life let me just i'll close on this all through the scriptures you find how paul would give admonition follow me as i follow christ be followers of me together right so it wasn't following paul alone but that leadership was from christ moving through paul coming into the body and paul could say even to the galatians he says that jesus christ in galatians 3 1 has been set evidently before your eyes in other words he's been made manifest in this scripture paul was to say in philippians 4 9 those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you i just heard it you've learned it but you've also seen it in action how many know you know the phrase what is the phrase a picture's worth a thousand words pictures help don't they that's why i like picture books that's why i taught elementary school i like pictures but you know brother ram tells an example of yet so you had three boys i believe and these boys grew up and they became sailors in the navy the father and mother couldn't figure it out because nobody had been in the armed forces no marines no navy nobody they couldn't figure out was going on so there was an investigation conducted and they asked these they asked these young men what was this why did you why did you turn out to be navy men and they directed the investigation back to their bedroom at night they would all be tucked in the bed and in their bedroom in front of them when they would lay down there was a picture of a vessel on a sea it was something that they saw over and over and over again and that in itself made such an impression on those men young men from boys to young men that they became sailors and of course brother branham takes that and jumps on he says if a picture of that would make someone want to become a sailor what ought the display of jesus christ too that's why i say god let that light flow and be displayed through our lives friends this is where we we look in the word and i because the holy spirit knows how to bring this down personally even to each of our lives i've tried to be very intentional just to hit in the high places here today but it's something for all of us when you think of brother brahms saying every effort we put forth make an example be an example it's something for us to stand in the light of the word and say the example that i'm living here right now is this the example i want my children to follow right because whatever example and patterns and let's just be honest there's some patterns that we need to say god those are not patterns from you and like david handed solomon the patterns to the temple by the spirit you say lord let the patterns be set right because we're not perfect but oh how we need the grace of god in our lives we need god's grace that every pattern itself that everything it would point to jesus christ we need god's grace to repent we need god's grace to lead us we need godly leadership that cultivates purposeful that cultivates godliness see this is where all of it as it comes down let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you are the author of your word lord i know that even as we look in services and moments like this lord as you've been just taking us lord in some of these pathways lord we we lord desire to just lord reflect and look lord and examine our own lives lord god i pray you'll help us lord help us lord even in realizing that the action lord our faithfulness or lack of faithfulness all of that is interpreted to our children it's interpreted to others around us no matter what we say it's our actions that make the greatest impression lord may the impression that others see like those boys may it be jesus christ a life that is oh god on fire for you and lord that on fire for you doesn't mean that we're setting down every moment of the day with our bible open because we know lord that dear god there's not even that time that's not what lord that you're expressing but god where there's an obedience to the word of god there's a faithfulness lord there's lord are looking to you for your direction and openness and an invitation that god that you can move within our homes move lord in lives move lord in situations lord god may lord we be counted oh god as those lord that are faithful lord i i could say lord i could speak i believe for every every person everyone here lord we just don't want to be associated or around this word lord we want this word oh god to so live through our lives and our hearts realizing lord we can understand all the mysteries we can understand all these things but it's a life that's to be lived it's simplicity lord you're gonna i thank lord over the years where i've lord been privileged to see different soldiers of the cross lord many that were lord older than myself all their scriptures lord they couldn't remember where was chapter it was in or so forth there wasn't lord there maybe the quote where they could remember where brother branham said this but lord it was a part of their life it just it was lived out through their life there was no question who is the love of their life you've seen it on display and you hear it even in their voice that there's a passion there's a love for the lord oh god i i'm just so thankful that it's not about our knowledge it's about the relationship of jesus christ lord i'm asking this morning if there's one that doesn't know you in that way may they be lord just so simple yielded and sensitive to say lord i just want you to make yourself known to me or to continue to make yourself known to me lord that's all of our hearts desire oh god lord in every action that we do lord i think of it lord what a testimony may our lives lord i pray be that of the impression lord upon the lives not only of our own children of our loved ones but god realizing that there are others right here in the assembly there's people in our families lord that we are witnessing to there's loved ones and lord it isn't it isn't the words it's the impression of jesus christ lord help us o god that he would be the right impression lord we love you and we thank you
