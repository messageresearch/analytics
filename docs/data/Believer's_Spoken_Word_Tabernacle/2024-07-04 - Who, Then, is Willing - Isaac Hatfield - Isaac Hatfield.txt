oh what a time will that be hallelujah amen we're just thankful to be here once again we just appreciate brother Samuel giving us the opportunity and just certainly praying that they all get back

baby's still not feeling well so um Bethany couldn't be here again tonight but we're just uh praying that everything clears up there amen if you have your Bibles thank you musicians we'll turn to the book of 1 Chronicles chapter 29 anden try to get straight to the word so we don't keep you long tonight anden how many love the Lord amen amen 1 Chronicles 29 we'll start in the first verse and read down through the ninth verse say Amen when you got it amen furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation Solomon my son whom alone God ha chosen is yet young and tender and the work is great for the palace is not for man but for the Lord God now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold and the silver for things of silver and the brass for things of brass the iron for things of iron and wood for things of wood onx stones and stones to be set glistering stones and of diverse colors and all manner of precious stones and marble stones in abundance whever because I have set my affection to the house of my God I have of mine own proper good of gold and silver which I have given to the house of my God over and above all that I prepared for the Holy House even 3,000 talents of gold of the gold of ofer and 7,000 talents of refined silver to Overlay the walls of the houses with all the gold for things of gold and the silver for things of silver and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers and who then is willing to consecrate his service this day onto the Lord then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds with the rulers of the king's work offered willingly and gave for the service of the house of God of gold 5,000 talents and 10,000 drams and a silver 10,000 talents and a brass 18,000 Talent and 100,000 talents of iron and they with whom precious stones were found gave them to The Treasure of the house of the Lord by the hand of jeel the ganite then the people rejoiced for that they offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the Lord and David the king also rejoiced with great joy amen if we could just bow our heads for a word of prayer whatever need you have on your heart tonight just lift it up before the Lord I believe he's more than able father we come into your presence once again tonight Lord and we just lay everything at your feet father Lord every every ambition Lord every Lord everything of our own selves Lord every weight of the of the week father Lord we just want to lay it aside for a moment Lord and concentrate on you for Lord I believe you're greater Lord than anything that we're going through so we seek your face tonight Lord that that you would come on the scene once again and speak to the hearts of your children Lord Lord we lord as Lord your servant Lord we want to get out of the way father Lord that you might speak through our lips but father I pray Lord that everyone in the audience tonight would just step aside Lord that they might receive what you have for them Lord Jesus we commit this service in your hands we offer it to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may have your seats tonight if we just take a thought out of that as a text for a few moments we want to preach on who then is willing who then is willing and and as they're dedicating this Temple for Solomon um Solomon they're beginning to build this Temple and they make a place in the dedication of the temple for the people to offer willingly uh uh things of gold and things that they might offer towards the building of the Tabernacle so so there was a place given in in in this ceremony that people could make a willing offering and that wasn't just for the this Tabernacle but in the book of Exodus in the Tabernacle that was being built in the days of Moses it was also given the same the same uh uh window of opportunity in Exodus 35 it says take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord whosoever is of a willing heart let him bring it an offering of the Lord gold and silver and brass and so there was given an opportunity for the people to give and and it wasn't a demand but it was a just that whosoever is of a willing whosoever spirit makes them willing come and give an offering unto the Lord and and the Bible teaches us that he that he he that uh SWS sparingly shall reap sparingly and he that SWS bountifully shall reap bountifully and and the Bible says every man according as he purposeth in his heart so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity for God loveth a cheerful Giver am me and I believe that's why we're here tonight brother Aaron not because that we have to be here not I I I I trust that none of us have come here grudgingly or or just of necessity or just to fulfill a duty and and if you did then I'm glad that you're here but there there there can come from your heart a love for the Lord and that that'll get you into the house of God and it it may not always be easy sometimes it may take a lot of effort but there's something in your heart that when you could make an excuse to stay home yet you don't do it and you come to the house of God because there's something in your heart that's willing and hungers to be in the presence of God and even Brandon in the beginning of his ministry he he he he he was so against money in a way that even he wouldn't take up an offering many times in the meetings but he come to the place where he realized that this was something that God ordained that this was actually a part of worship to give the people an opportunity to make an offering willingly from their heart amen and and so they ask the question who then is willing who is ready who who is eager who is prepared to do something for the Lord and and as Christians the first thing I think we want to do when we're trying to find uh uh uh make a plan or make a decision uh we want to find out is the Lord willing amen and that's was instructed to us in scripture in the Book of James was was that life is but a vapor you know uh when we close out a service we might say Lord will and we'll see you on Sunday morning because we don't know what tomorrow holds we don't know what the the next day holds uh uh it's so fickle and we just you never know and even brother Brandon as he would plan meetings would would be careful to set a schedule uh out because he he didn't know that the angel of the Lord might direct him to go a certain way or or lead him to a different place and so he would say that if if the Lord's willing we'll do this and and we'll do that and and if it would happen that we couldn't do it then we'll just trust that the Lord wasn't willing for it to happen amen is that right as Believers that that we don't get all tore up when something doesn't go the way we thought it would because we have confidence that God's hand is leading our lives that he's in control of the universe that he's in control of Our Lives that all things work together for good amen to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose amen when God closes the door we don't get all tore up we say thank you Lord that you're in control of my life and you know what's better for me than I know and your thoughts are higher than my thoughts and your ways are higher than my ways and so I'll Trust You Lord Brother Brandon would even say that that uh I think it was it was pretty amazing he said if I knew that I was wrong and God had chose me to be wrong I would want to stay wrong because that I want to do his will I love him till I want his will to be done he said now that's a big statement but I hope you get it in the spirit I said it I want to do his will and he find out that his NOS are better than his yeses amen if he says no that that would be better than a yes if that was his will because that would that would be what his intention was for your life amen so we want his will but but we're thankful that brother Brandon would teach us that even if you ever get in his permissive will that God has a permissive will that he can even allow that to work out for his perfect will in your life and that we don't have to worry if we ever make a mistake if we ever do something wrong God is able to work it together for our good amen and allow his will to be accomplished in our life but but but you might have to pay for it it may be difficult like like when brother Brandon was in South Africa I think it's one of the best examples that he got mixed up with a bunch of preachers over there and and the Lord had given them a vision of what to do and I believe it was to stay in Johannesburg but but here these other preachers were wanting to follow a certain itenerary and and brother Brandon was all tore up about it and he said well you know God does have a permissive will and and those preachers jumped on that and said yeah ask him about that go ask the Lord about that permissive will and so brother brandom tore up but they decided to go that way and he said all right but we're in his permissive will and they they ran into all kinds of trouble and brother Brandon actually contracted in amoeba and was sick uh because it was the permissive will and and probably God blessed in those meetings probably there was healings that took place but I'm thankful that God has a perfect will and I don't believe that God just permitted us to gather together tonight but I believe God has ordained us to be here I believe it's God's will for us to be in the house of the Lord tonight I I believe God's ordained it I believe he's he he he's pre-planned it amen and and it's his desire amen I believe on on a on a Thursday night to come and dwell with his people and pour out his spirit in our midst oh but we want to know H how to find God's will Amen brother Paul I I think especially as young people and you come to those Crossroads of life you're wondering how do I find God's will for my life how do I know that I'm I'm in God's Will and brother BR said I thank that that one of the best ways to find out God's will is through prayer me and he said that him and his own personal life as a prophet God dealt with him through visions and so many times he would wait on a vision but he would say uh uh uh but but the one of the best ways that he knew to find God's will was through prayer he said just get neutral before the Lord and just and just let yourself be neutral and whatever you're seeking the Lord about you just commit it to the Lord in prayer and then you know that whichever way you begin to lean and you just begin to lean that way and you just trust it to the Lord and whatever way you begin to lean you trust that that's his will you know that you've done the best you can and that you're operating in the will of God and so you move forward and you say Lord I'm in your will and then he said you would check your motives and objectives and and as long as you don't have any selfish motives or or objectives because brother Brandon would say that even if it is the will of God and you have a selfish motive he said that's just the same as it not being his will so you but but if you ever get it all lined up then brother you know it's God's will you know you're operating in his will and you can move forward with confidence because that's the first thing we want to do tonight am mean coming into a meeting like this we want to know brother what what is God's will for my life what is God's will for this meeting and you want to find God's Will and so you begin to say Lord what what is your will and brother brandom in in the prayer lines many times people would come through and he would say have you prayed up do you believe it's God's will to heal you and they would say yes then okay there's nothing left to do but cast that thing off of you because he brother Brandon would begin to teach us something he said if you ever positionally Place yourselves in the will of God then it's over and me if you could ever that's a quote in great warrior David he said if we can positionally place ourselves in his will it's over because uh there was a couple one time that came to brother brandham and Billy Paul was uh told Brother brandham there's a couple here they've got a baby with a crippled leg and they're wanting you to pray for it and they believe that if you pray for it brother Shane that the baby would get healed and so they brought the baby to brother brandom and they said brother brandom we believe that if you pray for our baby that that once you do it's going to be healed and brother Brandon said do you require a vision and they said no we don't and so he laid his hands on the baby and prayed for it and they went their way and brother Brandon went his way and the next day they come back and said brother Brandon something's wrong the baby's leg hasn't come down yet something's wrong maybe you should see a vision and brother BR said there ain't nothing wrong the only thing that's the matter is your faith amen there's nothing wrong with God there's nothing wrong with his word and so the mother spoke out only one thing brother brandom do you believe it's God's will for my baby to be healed and he said yes I believe it's God's Will and a few days later they wrote back the baby is healed its leg is normal because if you can ever play Place yourselves in God's will it'll bring a perseverance in your life amen that if God ever promised something and you ever decide and you ever God ever reveals to you that it's his will to do something then there's not enough devils in hell to stop you there's not enough critics to stop you there's not enough tormenting spirits to stop you because you know and you're persuaded that you are in the will of God Amen that that's that's what we want to do tonight is find out if if it's his will and and brother brandham gave us another way that we might know his will and he said not everyone that saith unto me uh this is scripture now in the Book of Matthew Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and brother brandom said his will is his word amen so he's given us ways to find his will he's given us prayer and he's given us his word Amen brother brand preached a sermon trying to do God's service without being in his will and and he said if you want to do God a service correctly there's five must that you must do to know that you're doing God a service correctly he said it must be according to his word it must be according to his time and his program it must be by the person he has chose to give it and to do it and it must come first to the prophets anden he's showing us that there is a way that you can do God a service correctly and know that you're in the will of God Amen in the book of First John it said this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him and brother Bram said now we ask what is the will of God he said there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God can you say amen and then he goes to Lamentations 3:37 and says who is he that saith and it cometh to pass when the Lord commandeth it not and he says there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name but the Bible said asking it shall be given unto you seeking it you shall find knocking it shall be opened unto you said if you abide in me and my word abide in you then you can ask what you will and it shall be given unto you if you say how do how do I know that I'm praying according to his will but if it's in his word and his word word is his will for your life and and so you know as a Believer if it if it's a promise given to this age and it's in the word then you have a right to ask uh for for any promise am mean you have a right to claim any Redemptive blessing and it shall be given unto you amen I don't know about you but I'd say there's probably some needs in here tonight and probably every one of us have burdens on our heart and you come before the Lord and you can come boldly Before the Throne of of God and ask believing that you shall have it because it's according to his word oh and his will is his word brother Brandon he preached a whole message called inspiration and me and if it's been a while since you've listened to it I I I recommend going and listen to it and and and he's preaching this message and and he's using this scripture ask the father anything in my name and I'll do it he said it isn't our faith in our prayer then it's just our faith in doing what he said do ask the father in my name and you shall have it it'll be given whatsoever you ask the father in my name you shall have he said just makes us wonderful to think that that our kind heavenly father in his kindness has G us this privilege of having what we would want or desire as long as it's in his will of course and we know when it's his will if it's according to his word here he was talking about this shunamite woman that was was making a place in her home for Elijah to come by and he was telling us that it was inspiration that led her to do that but but but it wasn't just enough that inspiration would come but she followed that inspiration amen amen and that's what we want to do is be obedient when you have inspiration strike am me brother said the thing is we don't want to be fanatics but if it's according to the word then you should respond to that inspiration amen if inspiration would sweep through this building tonight and inspire you to give more yourself to the Lord or inspire you to have a closer walk with the Lord amen then we just believe that the devil would never inspire you to do that but that's inspiration coming from the Throne of God because if it's according to the word it's inspiration and if it's true inspiration it'll be according to the word amen but there was a a shunamite woman who would follow that inspiration and make a place for the prophet and there would come a time that I I believe I believe it's the shunamite woman he's is telling the story about how there would come a time where she would have to lay her baby in that place that it might be healed an inspiration L her to do that amen but but but she was willing Amen to follow the inspiration of the Lord oh and we know that sons of God are led by the spirit of God and and and anything that's clean and righteous that that God would lead you to do it's according to his word amen and so when God leads you Amen to a to go and pray for somebody or or God leads you to to maybe read a certain scripture and you do it and it's a direct answer maybe just something that you had in your heart amen have you ever had that happen amen God lead you to pray for somebody and they let you know later that that that that you prayed exactly what they were going through or or different things where God sends inspiration amen and we know it's his will because it's according to his word oh you might be laughed at you might you might be considered fanatic IAL amen but but but it it would be uh uh it would um be um right of us it would it would be behooving of us as Believers to follow the channel of inspiration that God sends down amen because there's T times brother Paul where where you have something in your heart you know God's leading you to do something and you can't hardly get away from it you might try you might try to reason it away but you can't get away from it and then you know that it must be God leading you to do something man but then there's other times where where where you maybe desire to do something and you want to reason that it's okay but there's something really in your heart that's telling you that it's not okay and you can reason it in your head as much as you want to that this is the will of God but yet there's something in your heart saying checking you saying that ain't right that that that just isn't quite right amen so if you have a question about something then you should watch that because it may be that that's not the right thing that may be that that's not God's will for you anden because we're we're here all as Believers this evening we're not coming in here tonight wondering if it's God's will for our sisters to cut their hair we're not coming in here tonight wondering if it's God's will for our brothers to dress decent and have a good attitude and and do the right thing we're not wondering that because we already have been given a word which tells us that those things are wrong am mean we don't question those things any longer because we know they're wrong amen God has sent us a prophet in this hour are you thankful that we might know the will of God for our lives that we might have God's perfect will for our lives that we don't have to question anymore amen if we've been baptized right we have the answer we have God's will we don't have to question uh uh maybe if our church is in order because God sent us a prophet and and showed us the proper order and so we don't have to question these things uh we don't have to question If a woman should wear gar pertaining to a man we already have an answer and so we know God's will for our lives and we walk in that will and mean we have scripture after scripture we know it's his will it's not his will for any of his his sheep to be sick it's not brother the Bible said that God is not willing that any should perish am me we know he's not willing because he put it in his word and we know that he said in the Bible bless the Lord oh my soul forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities and health all thy diseases brother brandom said he is here to heal tonight why would he heal some and leave others go see it's not God's will for any of you to go unhealed it's not God's will for any of you to go unsaved and mean that struck me when I read that quote the other day he is here to heal tonight ammen how many believe that he is here to heal tonight amen how many believe that he is here to save tonight amen because many times if we're not careful we'll come to the house of God and it'll become common to us if we're not careful it'll just become tradition to us that we're just here to because it's Thursday night but here brother brandom saying he is here to heal tonight anden we know he's here brother Aaron because he said wherever two or three are gathered in in my name there I will be in the midst of them but I don't believe he come to church tonight just to sit on a Pew in the corner I believe he come with a purpose and intention that every promise in his word belongs to us that we have a right this night anden I don't believe in just uh I don't believe that we should come on Thursday nights just to have a protracted meeting and mean or just to sit on the Pew I believe we should come expecting that the angel of the Lord accompanies the message and he is here in the building tonight to meet every need of his believing children amen and I believe he has a purpose I believe he's come with an intention I believe that all things are possible to them that believe I believe that that that he's the same God that was in the meetings with brother Brandon has stepped into this building tonight and is more than able to speak lip to ear with the situation that you're going through he's more than able right now to send an Angel by the way of your loved one and begin to brood over their heart amen I believe that it's more than the preacher that stands behind the desk if you could recognize that there is an unseen God who is in the midst of of his children and he cares about you he cares about what you're going through he cares about the burdens on your heart amen and he's here with a purpose to to to meet every promise that he said amen and you have a right amen if God has ever healed somebody and God has ever delivered somebody you have a right as a believing child to come upon the same basis and believe that God will do the same for you because he's the same yesterday today and forever oh brother br and when he was here he encountered many critics and different things and and one thing that he ran into was people would say that they belied that it was God's will for them to suffer or that it was God's will for for them to be blind and brother brandom said how could that be then Christ defeated his own purpose when he came on the earth and healed so many that he came in contact with he said God wouldn't run his program like that amen that that he would that it would be his will for you to suffer and he would come and heal his believing children and me and he began to he began to expose this thing and show that that it was a lack of faith among the people amen and one brother Brandon preached a message a trial and me and he would have different ones come up and and he he he would have he called it Mr unbelief would come up and he would say well my symptoms are just as bad as ever and and he would have Mr skeptic come up and say well I never had results so God is unjust and here would come Mr impatient and say it's been 25 years and I've tested it and it's not true amen but but but but here they were instead of just admitting that they didn't have enough Faith to believe the word of God they would say that that that the that God is onjust or his word is untrue when the problem wasn't the word it was their faith and here brother Brandon saying it would be easier maybe for somebody to say that it's God's will for them to suffer than to just say that that they didn't have enough Faith amen and but but what it is the devil sometimes may try to put you in a trap and make you think that you're that it's God's will for you to suffer amen but but but but brother BR here was showing us that it's not God's will it's God's will to heal it's God's will to save many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord shall deliver them out of them all and mean there he was in Finland and there that dead boy was raised and here brother bandam says first do you find the will of God then do it and he said but say it ain't God's will in every he said it is God's will we done seen it done I've seen it done about five different times and I know it's true because the Bible said heal the sick cleanse the lepers raise the Dead cast out Devils freely have received freely gived and so we just believe that it's God's Will and mean we just believe that that that it's God's will for us to be here tonight am because he said uh to assemble the more e even the more so as you see the day approaching and me we believe it's God's will for the preacher to stand here because he commissioned us to go and preach the gospel amen so we believe we're operating in God's will tonight we believe it's God's will to heal the sick we believe it's God's will in this meeting Amen to set the captive free and loose the bound heart we believe it's God's will because he's already given us his word and me I believe that we can know God's will for our lives take the devil back to God's blueprint and say no devil it is not God's will for me to suffer it's your will and I'm tired of operating in your will devil but I want to come back to the will of God come back to the promises of God come back to God's absolute amen and let that devil die and say Satan you are finished amen I believe that it's God's will for me to live in Victory tonight I believe it's God's will for me to have my joy back I believe it's God's will for me to have my peace back I believe it's God's will for me to have my children I believe it's God's will for the love of God to wash away all the all the malice in my heart against my brother and my sister I believe it's God's will for me to walk free from condemnation because he said there's no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen I believe it's God's will that if you repent and be baptized for the remission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he said I've not given you the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind and me you don't have to live in torment anyone any longer thinking that it's God's will for you to live under a spirit of fear his word says I've not given you the spirit of fear but I've given you the spirit of love and perfect love will cast out all fear amen come back to the will of God oh it's a lying vanity man that would try to trap you brother brandom said today we're living why do we worry why do we wonder this is in why Christ speak 59 why do you wait speak and go forward don't cry out say oh Lord is it your will to heal today he said sure it's your will thus sayith the lord it's his will he said can I receive the Holy Ghost today is the days of Miracles past certainly the days of Miracles is here forever the holy spirit is here he said does men speak with tongues today the Bible said so these signs shall follow them that believe and here he is going through saying don't cry speak the word oh he said if there's sin in your life another quote here get it out he said if there's condemnation get it out if there's doubt get it out until you can see perfectly that it's God's will it's God's plan and you're included in that then say sickness in the name of Jesus Christ get away from me and remember you might not feel any better for a week oh that's an important thing to remember but as soon as you said that word something happened Oh Glory God has to keep his word that sickness shakes and begins to turn loose he will go if you'll just believe it and don't doubt and mean and and I'm just uh crazy enough to believe that if God put it in his word then it must be his will amen there stood Joshua and Caleb on the edge of the promised land amen but God had already promised them that it was theirs it may have took hundreds of years to get there but there they were and they knew that it was God's will for them to take it because he had already given them the promise that their seed would possess the land Hallelujah and as the Seed of Abraham tonight amen if all the others say there's too many Giants in the land I say but it's God's will for me to possess it it's God's will for me to possess every inch of this land I don't care about that Giants it's God's will it's God's will for me to destroy every Giant and take back what God has given me and me I don't believe we have to knck down to the devil and let him Rob us of our joy I believe there can come a shamgar anointing on your life that says this is my land this is my family and I'm tired of the devil robbing me of what God has promised to me oh Hallelujah I said it's the will of God Amen and and now now we know that sometimes God allows things we know that sometimes God allows sickness amen and so don't don't don't think that we don't believe that because God may allow somebody to get in a hospital bed to to to to bring them back to the Lord and mean and me he's the Good Shepherd he knows better than we do and me you know he allowed that boy to be blind that the works of God might be made manifest in him but but I don't believe it was God's will for him to stay blind I believe God allowed it for season but I believe he was he was fixing to bring a testimony to his life and me God may allow babies to go to go to heaven at a young age but but maybe they would have grown up and not serve the Lord I mean he knows better than we do his ways are higher than our ways and so sometimes he allows things but I don't believe it's his will for you to to stay you know every son that cometh to God must be tested and tried and mean Paul had to go through afflictions and God allowed things but I believe amen that it's God's will for his children to be to be healed I believe it's God's will for his children to be delivered he may allow things he may let you go through trials but I believe he doesn't desire you to stay in that condition forever but I believe he's only using it to work according to his purpose for your life amen but what the devil I believe many times will try to do is try to get you to stay in that condition thinking that it's God's will but and many times what he'll try to do is get you to look at the other person amen that that you say well so and so got this sickness and they died but what's that got to do with you amen the Christian walk is between you and the Lorden and maybe God's will for somebody else is different maybe maybe then God's will not that his word changes but but maybe God would have somebody to go through a certain thing but but but but but come back to his word amen and the Christian walk is between you and the Lord if this whole church were to Fall Away brother Shane that has nothing to do with you amen because it's God I believe it's God's will for me to stand fast I believe it's God's will for me to to make a Rapture amen so if the whole church falls away I don't believe that changes God's will for my life I believe I understand that it's his will for me to walk in perfect Liberty amen and he'll try to get you and say well I I danced in the spirit with this person and now theyve fallen away but but but but don't ever let that channel of memory don't ever let the devil use that channel say oh so and so trusted God and they failed but what's that got to do with you I mean you're his believing child you're you're the one that's coming upon the basis of his word and how many times would brother brandom say if I prayed for 10,000 today and they all died and mean that wouldn't hinder his faith but he would come back the next day praying just the same because God put it in his word it's his will amen that that that that that the many afflictions oh that his children would be set free he said I'm the Lord who Health all thy diseases oh it's the devil amen many times it try to get you to think that it's not for you you see because I believe we're all believers and so we know that God's A Healer we know that God's a deliverer but I'll try to come and whisper in ear that it's not for you and all of a sudden you start dropping down under a heaven burden oh it's not for me here brother brandom says it makes it hard he said if you're unbelieving it's the spirit of the devil anointing that person pulling right down like that with this belief he said and I can feel that and tell it but he said it makes it hard but if a person is really believing they're pulling in the spirit of God he said cuz it's the word of God we all know that and if the devil can just put a question mark across there he's got you but when you erase that question mark and say it that's every bit true and it's for me then you're pulling from God Amen Satan will try to put a question mark in your mind make you maybe wonder if it's God's will for you to be healed if it's God's will for you to be delivered in this service but what do you do you say it's every bit true and it's for me amen why don't you just say that tonight it's every bit true and it's for me amen and you may not feel a difference right away but you just keep saying it anden if you have to say it all service if you have to say it when you get home in bed tonight you just keep saying it until that cloud leaves your life and you really believe it that it's for you it's for me amen that every promise is for me that the Holy Ghost is for me amen if God put it in his word then I believe it's for me amen it's every bit true amen and it's for me amen because it's his word amen and then the devil will try to come by brother Brian and say okay it's for you you but but but it'll probably be way down the road sometime amen what a lie of the devil amen but today is the day of salvation the Bible said now is the accepted time now is the day of salvation behold now are we the sons of God Amen when now who we what are we the sons of God hallelujah now we are the sons of God because if you can ever positionally Place yourself in his will then it's over amen so what do you do you position yourself I am a Son of God I have a right to every redemp of blessing it's his will for me to live an overcoming life it's his will for me to live an adopted life and now I'm a Son of God and you don't have to let the devil kick you around like a football oh and every day is up and down and in and out and mean you can come back to a stability and say no devil you don't have control over me anymore I'm a Son of God amen amen many times people fail to see the hour they're living in amen but many times God is doing things all around us and and and if we would just recognize it amen then we wouldn't have to look back to a day gone by and say I wish I could have lived in that day I believe if we could really recognize the presence of God in this hour then we wouldn't look back to another day I believe we would live in the moment that he is the same God yesterday today and forever and he is still the same God he's just as much God as he was in brother bram's life just as much God as he was in Paul's life and I believe oh if we could recognized his presence we'd realize what a privileged people we were to be living in this hour where we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh but it's Satan Satan would try to rob you when God has given us a whole bookful of divine promises and Satan there trying to convince you that that that that you don't that you don't deserve it or that that that you you're not good enough for it or that it doesn't belong to you but I believe that you belong in your position sister Addy I believe that God has positioned a bride in Heavenly places I believe God has a positioned a bride that's joint HS in the kingdom and I believe you belong there you belong in that position and there Comes A Time in your life where you may have strayed from your position but I believe you can come back to your position in the will of God I believe you can come back brother to what you were always meant to be and mean I believe I was a Son of God before the foundation of the world I don't believe I just became a son I believe I always was a son oh and I may have strayed for a moment but there come a time in my life where the Lord begin to lead me back to my position that I could recognize that I am a Son of God and I always was an eagle I never belonged in that chicken cage I never belonged in that chicken yard amen come back to your position in the heavenlies with the Lord Jesus come back to where you soar above all of those anxieties and all of those depressions come back to your position Amen brother Brandon would say that a halfway life is one of the most miserable places a Christian can live amen and if you're miserable tonight you can identify that maybe you've only given yourself partly to the Lorden but I don't believe you belong there I believe it's just a present condition you find yourself in but come back to your position of an overcoming life oh where the joy of the Lord floods your heart day in and day out we're serving the lord becomes the most glorious thing to you oh brother I I I I I I enjoy sports and I really do but it's nothing like serving the lord it's nothing like feeling the presence of the Lord it's nothing like that sweeping anointing that wipes away all your fears and all your worries there is a liberty that you can come back to your position oh do you hear Mother Eagle calling you oh she's flying over saying you're my son you're my daughter and you don't belong there you always belonged in the heavenlies oh you say I'm almost scared brother Isaac to really let loose and enjoy my salvation amen maybe you should be scared that maybe you should Reserve yourself if you're at if you're at your friend's house or if you're at somebody's house that you don't really know sometimes you you you don't help yourself the way you would at home amen but when you realize that you're home and this message is home and you can make yourself at home and mean you say I'm scared that the door is going to close in my face oh and God's going to lock me out one day but brother this is your home and mean we have the keys to the house this is it's not an accident that you wound up in this message it's not an accident that you find yourself seated in Heavenly places it was God's position for you before the foundation of the world and I believe it's God's will for me to enjoy my salvation I don't I believe it's God's will for us to come to church tonight with our heads hung down weary and weighted down and depressed I believe it's God's will for you to be happy I believe it's God's will to lift up your head lift up the feeble knees and praise the Lord who's the god of every impossible situation oh I believe he wrote in his word to praise him let everything that have breath praise the Lord and me say is it God's will for me to worship him in the midst of trial he put it in his word word let everything that have breath praise the Lord Praise Him in the dance praise him on the stringed instruments praise the Lord oh and brother we know that works is Faith expressed you see uh Paul talked about how be justified by faith and there in James talked about being justified by works but sometimes your Works express your faith because God sees your faith but everyone around you might not see your faith so that works expresses that Faith so that your neighbor might see your faith anden and sometimes you come to the house of God and it's not an expression of your feelings sometimes it's an expression of your faith because you may not feel like coming and me you're tired you're weary but you come to the house of God as an expression that I'm a Son of God and this is where I belong amen and sometimes I believe that your praise isn't an expression of your feelings but your worship at times may just be an expression of your faith that even when you don't feel it am mean you Worship the Lord amen even when you don't understand everything oh you say Lord you're worthy of it all Lord you're worthy of all the glory and all the honor Lord you're in control oh come back to your position amen you see when you're at home you make yourself at home and as an eagle of God this message is Eagle food this is your food I mean this isn't my this isn't my neighbor's food this is my food and I have a right to enjoy my food I have a right to feed on this message I have a right to believe that God is going to reveal himself to me you say I feel like a trespasser brother Isaac this is your position this this is your home this is your food am mean so that's why you should hunt for your position because if you can ever make your calling an election sure you you shall never fall is that what the scripture taught us and so hunt for your position amen but when you ever realize what your position is then you realize Satan's position because if you realize that your position is in Christ and every devil is under his feet then you realize Satan's position is under your feet Oh Glory depression is under your feet anxiety is under your feet amen worry is under your feet and you can positionally place yourself in the will of God and then it's over anden it's finished it's settled oh and then Hold Your Position praise the Lord amen what we're trying to do is bring out that God is willing amen but brother brandom said as we turn a corner here for a few moments I'm trusting to God that this will be a mighty and a great meeting and I believe it will it can be God is willing for it to be if we're willing to make an effort for it to be we must put our shoulders together and we must put not only our shoulders together but our hearts together we must worship and pray and call our neighbors and get the sick and The Afflicted out here and talk among each other have prayer meetings around in our neighborhood and get everyone here we can and another message expectations he said a meeting can only be whatever the people will make it now God is willing if we are willing can you say Amen but we have our part to play each indiv idual has our part to play I can no more make a Revival out of it or a meeting than nothing and no one individual amen are you listening or no just two or three of you it'll take all of us together working together through the Lord Jesus Christ to see something accomplished here in this city while we're gathered together for the kingdom of God's sake amen so I mean you're needed tonight amen you say if you want the Lord to pour out amen and mean when they were all in the upper room I believe they were all gathered together in one mind one Accord and I believe God was willing but I believe there was 120 Apostles and disciples that were willing as well and brother brand said God is willing when we are ready he said I believe that God is willing and wanting to take his people and show himself if he can only get a man or a woman a boy or a girl to lay down their own thoughts and become a prisoner to him and believe him amen amen God is willing now he saying are you willing who then is willing amen this work is for the Lord this is not for some man this is the work of God this is the kingdom of God and and when Elijah was out there on the mountain amen God had some crows I believe it was bringing food to him and supplying what he had need of is that right brother Aaron uh brother Brian amen but but but but Elijah didn't just get that and say I wonder what this is all about and lay it to the side and say I don't care what those crows bring I'm not going to eat it but Elijah said oh praise God that's pretty good and he just enjoyed it and then brother Brandon would say people criticizing uh worship and and people criticizing the joy of the believer and and brother Brandon would begin to compare it to that and say I don't understand maybe where it comes from but all I know that God sends it and I just enjoy it amen so you see he cares to send it but but you got to care to receive it and there Elijah cared enough to receive it amen but there's a people amen who say if God cares to send it then I care enough to receive it amen he said behold I sent unto you Elijah the prophet amen but if God cared enough to send Elijah he had a bride that was identified in that word you that said I will care enough to receive my message I will care enough if God sends a message I care enough to receive it amen if God's willing to send a sweeping anointing through this building tonight I believe he's got some believing of children that say God if you're willing to send it I'm willing to receive it Lord if you're willing to send my victory tonight I'm willing to receive it am mean you see brother Brandon was in the meeting he said my sister came up to me he said he said bill I was so happy while you were preaching that I felt like I could raise up and jump through the wall and brother friend said raise up and jump and she said but when you went to doing that she said the people began shouting and then I just felt like I was a little old nothing brother bam said that's the devil that's Satan when he come in to do that I said you should have raised up anyhow we are priest to God making spiritual sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving praise to his name amen God cared enough to send that by her way but there she was thinking well I'm just a little old nothing or or I don't know and may be worried about responding anden but God sent it for a purpose and I believe he's here in this meeting for a purpose but there's a people to respond am me we're not Fanatics we're responding to the word we're responding to his will anden if God sends an anointing we care enough to receive it we care enough to step out it and say Lord You're the Healer you're the deliverer Lord I receive it like Mary you say it's nothing uh uh be it unto me according to your word like hady right said it's nothing but the truth and mean when that inspiration struck you they responded and mean it's when inspiration strikes your heart and mean there comes a response out from your being oh that says Amen to the word of God oh and you may not see the answer right away am mean you might sometimes break out in a service uh the anointing is so strong amen you may dance all over this building and you think my surely the Lord has visited me and then Monday hit hits and you think my I was just being an emotional uh wreck but but but but rebuke that thing amen when God sends it and you receive it hold on to it until the answer comes oh like Abraham it may have took 25 years but when inspiration strikes oh stay right there oh that inspiration will take us through oh God is true to his word amen if there's a deep calling in your heart there's a deep to respond amen somebody that'll let him be Lord you see the door handle to the door when he said behold I stand at the door and knock the handle was on the inside amen but there's a people amen that will let him in amen I believe that later seeing age amen he was standing on the outside but I believe there's a bride who has leted him in and they have not just let him into the house house but they've let him into every closet and they've let him be the Lord total lordship total preeminence Hallelujah like the Bible says let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus a people a a prisoner people who will let the mind of Christ come in and push out every other thought every other reasoning every other idea amen because it it's he has already done his part is that right amen and and when he said uh brother brand I was just listening to today brother brand was preaching about I believe it was the message lamb and Dove and he was preaching about how those Pentecostal women would let their daughters get out there and mow the yard and things like that and so you see uh you see it took a letting I mean it took somebody to let it now if that's in the negative how somebody could let down the bars how a mother or father could let down the bars and let s creep in and and how it started with somebody that was just willing to let it happen and sin creeped in and took over and would lead them far away from the word of God what about in the positive where there's a bride who's willing to let God be God oh like on Mount carel when Elijah was there put the sacrifice together according to the vision of the Lord but when that fire fell and consumed the sacrifice brother BR tell tells us about how that 7,000 rang out let God be God you see that whole Mountain saw that he was God that whole Mountain was a witness to the power of God but there was a 7,000 that said let God be God am me a people that are willing to lay down their own desires lay down their own will and let God be God oh it's a prisoner people you see uh you see um brother uh brand would tell us about how Jesus already had a conference in the Garden of Gethsemane and there he already made his decision amen he said you're going to have to suffer you're going to have to wear a crown of thorns you're going to have to pay the price you're going to have to go through uh uh some great things but he made his decision there that he would do it amen for a people for a bride but but now the decision is on us Amen brother brandom said he said there he made the decisions made what is it not my will but thine be done and now he said what's your answer to his p and you know what's your answer will you serve the Lord what's your decision he said what's your answer to his ply come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden and I will give you rest amen are you willing oh to throw away that old yoke of bondage and take on the Yoke that is is easy the burdens that are light oh and and place yourself in his will because he can't heal you against your will and he can't save you against your will is that right anden so brother BR said in a message a prisoner that I I don't care if my organization turns me out I'm still going to stay with that word I'm going to do it my will is God's Will and God's will is my will I'm going to be a prisoner to Jesus Christ Christ it's God in you willing his will amen it's a uniting of Wills amen that that that uh uh that we you know brother Brandon would say that there in South Africa right there was a bunch of preachers who were willing to take the permissive will but there was a prophet who said I don't like to operate in his permissive will but I like to operate in his perfect will amen oh are you thankful amen there there's a bunch of people maybe still today that that are perfectly happy to operate in the permissive will amen and God can send a message amen and they can just maybe pick and choose and whatever God permits them to do they're happy to walk in what God permits but there is a bride I believe who desires the perfect will of God and I believe brother Paul we have his perfect word I believe that there's the people who are willing to walk in his perfect will amen no matter how hard it is no matter what you have to give up to do it oh you may lose friends you may have to forsake houses and lands and families but there's something in you saying Lord I want to be your prisoner I want to walk in your perfect will amen not my will but thine be done you see that's the problem so many times is self-will amen but but aren't you thankful that God knew what you would choose you see there he was uh Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane right we'll go back there there he was he was already the lamb slain before the foundation of the world but in that Garden he said he said Lord if you be willing let this cup pass up from me but then he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done he say I I had have a lot of plans for my life brother Isaac but nevertheless say I've got a lot I've got my future already planned out but nevertheless say I believe it's God's will for me to to do this and to do that because maybe I'd make a little bit more money or be it'd be easier but nevertheless amen there because he was the lamb he he was the lamb being led to the slaughter amen and there's the nature of a lamb Amen to give up its rights Amen brother Brandon preached the message lamb and Dove he said it's my right but there he would say but are you willing to give up your rights Amen to be a lamb you say oh I've got a right brother Isaac to be angry at this brother they did me wrong they absolutely did me wrong but are you willing to give up your rights amen for the sake of the Gospel are you willing to give he said I've got a right they have and you may have a right to be mad you might really have a right to hold a grudge against that brother or sister and your natural rights but are you willing to give up your rights and humble yourselves and say I'm sorry Lord that I've let bitterness creep into my heart and but I'm going to lay aside my churchianity I'm going to lay aside my own self-will and say Lord I'm sorry I'm sorry for what I've done I'm sorry Lord that uh brother I'm sorry if I offended you sister I'm sorry amen it's a dying out to your rights to come back to the will of God Amen you say Lord if I'm do if there's anything I've held in my heart that's hindering you from moving Lord forgive me I'm sorry I'm willing to say that I've been wrong amen do don't we all come to those points amen don't we all amen maybe if you're like me it's daily or multiple times a day you come to that point Lord I'm so sorry I made a mistake but if Paul had to Die daily and Paul was a prisoner what about a bride amen we may have to Die daily but for the sake of the will of God we're willing to say we're sorry we're willing to say to our brother we're willing to say to our sister brother Brandon tells about a sister and man he's talking about I believe she was in a car accident and they said do you want to sue for damages and say my no damn there's already been enough damage I want repair oh it's pretty pretty pretty pretty good analogy amen because there had already been enough damage so what was the point to sue for damages she said we need some repair and maybe that's sometimes the way we come to in our Christian walk and mean you get a little bit fired up about something and you say I've got a right to sue for damages they've actually they've absolutely done me wrong and they were liable it was their fault mean but hasn't there been enough damage amen but wouldn't it be better that there would come some repair oh oh help Lord let us die out to our self will and we want repair we want this thing to move forward we want the Lord to have his way in our meetings we want brother Samuel to be able to get up on Sunday morning and not have to fight through a bunch of a bunch of grudges and a bunch of problems Oh Glory aren't we willing am mean aren't we willing to stand the chastisement AR we willing say Lord Wash Me Lord take it all away oh Lord have your way Lord I'm your bride Lord have your way and you lay it down on the altar Lord all of my rights I bring them to you Lord everything that I have Lord I really feel in my carnal nature a certain way but Lord right now I give it to you and I'm willing Lord to turn the other cheek I'm willing Lord to get on my knees and pray for my brother and my sister I feel right now like calling somebody and gossiping about them but Lord just for a moment I'm going to get on my knees and see if I feel a little bit differently when I get up well Glory we come to have church tonight amen it it may take death oh but isn't it worth it to be in the will of the Lord amen you see Samson one time he got himself into some trouble he got mixed up with the wrong thing amen but he was ready raised up to destroy those Philistines and he come to the place where he was willing to die oh to get back to get back to the blessings of God he was willing to die Amen to get back you may have got mixed up in the wrong thing and feel like you're so far from the will of God me but just like Samson maybe you come to that place you feel like you're at the end of your road you say Lord I'm willing to die to get back oh I'm willing to die Lord I've had enough but Lord I believe you raised me up to kill this thing I believe you've raised me up to overcome this devil and Lord I don't believe I'm so far gone that I can't get back to your will but Lord I just want to say I'm sorry Lord I just want to say forgive me amen as the musicians come Lord I'm willing Lord this work is for you you we're not we're not see we're not here tonight working for some man this is the work of the Lord amen and sometimes if you get your focus right you start looking at the carinal amen it gets a little bit easier maybe to hold on to that funny feeling but if you ever just say Lord remind me what this is all about Lord bring to my remebrance who I'm working for yeah I I'm not working just for my brother we're working together but we're working for the this is for the Lord amen who then is willing amen who then is willing to consecrate his service amen amen I believe there's a bride that says Lord I'm willing Lord I'm willing to lay it all down you see he he'll take second place he'll take third place and mean that's what makes him Lord he'll take fourth place but I believe he deserves first place and how many times amen even in in my own life I haven't always put him in first place but say Lord forgive me Lord I I I want to put you back where you belong in my prayer Life In My Worship and coming to the house of God lord I want to put you back where you belong Lord I want to be in my position but Lord I want you in your position amen maybe every head bowed every eye closed Lord I want to be in my position as an overcomer I want to be in my position and Lord I want you to be in your position I want you to have first place in this church I want you to have first place in my life you see I don't have much to offer him brother Isaac but you see there was a time where a widow woman came to an offering plate and and the Bible says many that were Rich cast in much but there came a certain poor Widow and she threw in only two mites which make a farthing in the Bible would say that he called onto him his disciples and said unto them verily I say unto you this poor Widow hath cast more in than all they which have cast into the treasury for all they did cast in of their abundance but she of her want did cast in all that she had even all her living you say I don't have much brother Isaac but you know something no matter how little you have if you give it all you've given more than the majority of people will ever give because many casting of their abundance but there's a little bride I believe that no matter how much little she feels like she has she just gives it all and and you see brother Brandon would explained to us that God seen what was down the road for that widow woman he didn't stop her he knew there was a home prepared for her in glory and me and he even compared her to Haddy Wright who was given some money into an offering one time I believe for it was for a church fund and brother Brandon was going to pay her back but the Lord stopped him and and showed that there was a blessing laying for her down the road she was going to get her children and you say it hurts to forsake all it hurts to give up everything oh but Eye Has Not Seen ear hasn't even heard what God has in store amen I believe that if you forsake Hall like Rebecca and mean I believe she followed inspiration one time and and she went to be with Isaac she watered his camels and mean what led her to do that there was an angel that had gone before and prepared her heart I believe and and she she she she followed the inspiration amen and and what if she wouldn't have followed it she would have maybe stayed in that same condition her whole life but now she knew what it was like to be Isaac's bride anden say well I got to give up so much to serve the Lord but what about what you gain and mean I believe if you really give yourself to this message it'll take you places you never imagined you could go amen take you places in the in the power of God you never even imagined give you joy and peace you never even imagined in one day oh and ation will strike anden and our bodies will be changed and it'll take you into a a future home into a marriage supper me brother brandom said amen that that he said the time has come know him in the power of his resurrection know that my inspiration that's been leading me am me class to fanatic and whatever more it's brought me to the line it's brought me to the paying off place he said mothers you old grey hooded mothers and daddies here don't worry You're the Inspiration that's LED you to Christ you come through many dangers toils and snares don't worry some morning it'll pay off it'll pay off Jesus will come we'd be caught up with him in the air oh Heavenly Father Lord we feel your presence in this place Lord we lord we feel as if you've been speaking tonight to some need father and maybe it's just to one individual Lord I don't know

you Lord we may have an idea of how the service would go and may have an idea of what time we would get out but Lord if you're dealing with the heart then Lord we say we're willing to give room for you father Lord I pray Lord that each one of us Lord wouldn't hold anything back but say Lord we're willing to give it all father maybe there's somebody here tonight that's held something against somebody else in their heart Lord May there come a letting go tonight father and let God have his way Lord maybe sometimes we just think that we're not worthy and father Lord that you don't Lord that we don't deserve it but Lord may we take you out of the box we've put you in Lord and just come back to your word and that's your will for our lives and say Lord Lord if you said I can have it then I'll stop using my excuses I'll stop feeling like I'm not worthy enough Lord if you promised it I'm willing to lay aside my insecurities and say Lord I receive it Lord tonight in your presence if there's one that's Desiring the Holy Ghost father may they just open up tonight and say Lord I'm willing and Lord I believe if they're willing to do that I believe you're more willing to give it to them than even they are to receive it Lord I believe you're more willing than even we are to restore Joy tonight to restore peace oh father I pray that it would be so may it maybe inspiration would be striking a heart right now oh to rededicate themselves to you father we don't believe it's so much the the place that they're at but I believe it's the willingness of the heart but just in this moment if inspiration is striking you to come to this altar amen it's open amen if inspiration striking you just to lift your hands in your chair whatever inspiration would be leading to you you to do why don't you just respond to that inspiration amen not not not trying to pull you or pressure you just believing that if that that that if you're willing I believe God is more than willing to meet you where you're at tonight amen I believe God is more than willing and wherever inspiration would lead you amen just say Lord I'm willing H just have a willing heart oh Jesus we love you Lord amen Lord maybe this this this has Lord maybe shaved off some of our own will tonight but Lord we want you to shave it off father we want you to shave off Lord Isaac Hatfield's the worst enemy I have and Lord I pray that you shave away everything that's contrary to your word Lord till it would be not I that live but only Christ that lives in me Lord if there's any of my nature Lord I I lift my hand before you lord lord I I desire a deeper walk with you I desire to be closer with you Lord here we are willing Lord here we are willing father Lord I lift my hand before you Lord take it from me Father take away Lord this old this old carnalities father Lord every every Grudge Lord everything Lord take it from us I pray dear God lord we want to die out to your will for our lives for Lord I believe Lord that Lord you have Greater Heights for me Lord I believe there's deeper depths and higher Heights to walk in Lord I don't believe that you're a cruel father that would lead us to to die out just to punish us but Lord I believe that you're standing right right there willing to pour out more of yourself in US Lord You're just waiting maybe just waiting for us just to give it up let go that you might come in Lord do with us what we never even thought possible so Lord we just commit Our Lives into your service now oh in the precious name of Jesus Christ we commit this meeting into your hands thank you for coming by Lord thank you for your presence thank you for your anointing father Lord we just feel it so sweet right now Lord we feel it just so precious Lord and we just thank you for it Lord Lord we thank you for coming by amen maybe inspiration is leading you right now just to thank them maybe you've been worried about a situation for so long and you've been so worried about it till you've been losing sleep but maybe inspiration right now would be sweeping over you just to start thanking them for it why don't you just start praying prising him for it why don't you just start thanking him for the finished work amen if you positioned yourself in his will then it's over you don't have to keep worrying about it take your hands off and let God worry about it he's the he's the master of this winds he's the maker of the rain he's in the ship with you oh you don't have to fret he's an everpresent help in the time of trouble amen father we rebuke every spirit of fear and worry that would try to plague the minds of your children father I pray we come back to your will come back to a peaceful mind Lord that when we lay down at night we wouldn't lay awake Lord that we wouldn't
