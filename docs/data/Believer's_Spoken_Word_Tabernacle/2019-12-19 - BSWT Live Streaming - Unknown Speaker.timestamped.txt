[34:32] want to turn our hearts and our
[34:33] attention to the word of the Lord Amen
[34:36] so if we could let's just bow our hearts
[34:38] just ask the Lord to just further move
[34:42] in among us on his word Lord Jesus as we
[34:48] come before you lord as part of a
[34:51] service now Lord you you're such a
[34:56] perfect gentleman
[34:58] you always give us the opportunity to
[35:01] worship you First Lord to sing praises
[35:06] Lord beyond everything of this life and
[35:11] things that more that they went through
[35:13] or go through Lord as we come here and
[35:17] we gather together it's just something
[35:20] about it Lord to be able to get together
[35:22] with believers of life precious faith
[35:26] elixir fire Lord that are coming
[35:28] together Lord as we begin to see Lord we
[35:33] read about in the scriptures where Paul
[35:35] and Silas the Bible says about midnight
[35:37] they begin to sing praises or do we know
[35:41] we don't know if they Sun the Frug was
[35:44] the first song or if it was the second
[35:46] song we don't know even what stanza it
[35:49] was we don't know maybe whether it was
[35:51] ten minutes of singing a minute of
[35:53] saying we don't know but one thing that
[35:54] we do know is that their heart moved to
[35:57] a place Lord where their faith Lord was
[36:00] resting in that word and you came right
[36:03] there where they were gathered and you
[36:07] removed the hindrances Lord God for the
[36:12] purpose that you had called them for and
[36:14] we know that if they had not been there
[36:17] in that Philippians in that jail Lord
[36:20] one of your elected children Oh God they
[36:23] would they would not have heard your
[36:26] word
[36:27] but lord I think of how your prophet
[36:29] would say in this time when that of the
[36:33] Philippian jailer would ask the question
[36:36] concerning his house and your prophet
[36:39] would instruct us he said what Paul said
[36:42] believe that I am God's prophet and
[36:45] representing the Lord Jesus Christ and
[36:48] believe on him and die in my house shall
[36:51] be saved
[36:52] Lord we are aware oh god of this reality
[36:57] and we thank you Lord and we ask the
[37:01] Lord that you would just move in now
[37:02] among us Lord move in Lord by way of
[37:05] your spirit take your word and speak to
[37:08] our hearts Lord you know every situation
[37:13] you know every need and you're the
[37:16] answer Lord we give ourselves to you
[37:20] father the Lord for every request upon
[37:23] every heart Lord you are the satisfier
[37:28] you're the answer we ask it now Lord in
[37:32] the name of Jesus Christ for the glory
[37:34] of let's turn to Exodus 15 I want to go
[37:44] a little bit further here tonight in
[37:46] this part we've been looking at just try
[37:49] to go a little bit here in the word of
[37:52] the Lord to see how the Lord will take
[37:54] us
[37:57] in verse 22 of Exodus 15 the Bible says
[38:02] so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea
[38:05] and they went out into the wilderness of
[38:08] Shur and they went three days in the
[38:11] wilderness and found no water and when
[38:15] they came to Marlin they could not drink
[38:18] of the waters of Marah for they were
[38:20] bitter therefore the name of it was
[38:23] called Martin and the people murmured
[38:27] against Moses saying what shall we drink
[38:32] and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord
[38:36] showed him a tree and when he had cast
[38:39] into the waters the waters were made
[38:42] sweet there he made for them a statute
[38:47] and an ordinance and there he proven and
[38:52] said if thou wilt diligently I want you
[38:54] to watch this here and he said if thou
[38:56] wilt diligently hearken to the voice of
[39:00] the LORD thy God and will do that which
[39:04] is right in his sight and will give ear
[39:07] to His commandments and keep all his
[39:09] statutes I will put none of these
[39:12] diseases upon thee which I have brought
[39:15] upon the Egyptians for I am the Lord
[39:17] that healeth
[39:22] we want to look here tonight starting to
[39:25] this on the healing power in the word of
[39:28] God amen may God bless you as you're
[39:31] being seated
[39:37] you know when we look here and we read
[39:40] in the scriptures we find here where
[39:45] Israel had come to a place that many of
[39:49] us we come to there's many different
[39:52] ways that trials and tests come to our
[39:56] life there is trials and tests that come
[39:59] sometimes from losing a loved one
[40:02] sometimes there's tests and trials that
[40:04] comes in our lives from things that we
[40:08] maybe are going through where we from
[40:12] things from work and things with family
[40:14] things within situations that would be
[40:17] like that then we also have situations
[40:19] where Peter would describe it as well
[40:21] where tests and trials will come our way
[40:24] where we're called different names or
[40:26] misunderstood or all those things and
[40:28] many of the times that if we're honest
[40:31] real honest about it there's many of the
[40:33] times that we pray within ourselves Lord
[40:35] let this pass let this move from me let
[40:38] this let this go away because there's
[40:40] nothing within the test or trial to our
[40:43] flesh man or even our spirit man that is
[40:47] comfortable or welcoming but yet we
[40:49] realize that these tests and trials they
[40:52] are not accidents but they are
[40:54] predetermined pre-planned moments of God
[40:57] that God has permitted to come our way
[40:59] in order to shape us and to mold us for
[41:03] the purpose that he's working in our
[41:05] life and that he's called us to one
[41:07] thing about it the brother branham would
[41:09] tell us over and over when it comes to
[41:10] tests and trials in the church age book
[41:12] is how that God is not the author of
[41:15] confusion that God is the author of
[41:18] purpose and no wonder Peter would write
[41:20] by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[41:22] when a trial would come and he would say
[41:25] think it not strange concerning the
[41:27] fiery trial which is to try you as
[41:29] though some strim some strange thing has
[41:31] happened and we can be honest here
[41:34] tonight many of us have experienced this
[41:36] like what they experienced coming out of
[41:38] a mighty victory crossing the Red Sea
[41:40] and as soon as they come out of this
[41:42] victory here
[41:43] they are led three days in the wind if
[41:46] from that place of the Red Sea and
[41:47] they're led right to bitter water
[41:50] it would seem like in a place that you
[41:53] know that my if you come out of a
[41:54] victory you've come out of a wonderful
[41:56] set of meetings or a wonderful service
[41:58] or maybe you've had wonderful group of
[42:01] months that are strung together and then
[42:03] all of a sudden you walk upon some
[42:05] bitter waters but remember that the
[42:07] bitter waters when trials and tests come
[42:09] they're not to make us bitter but
[42:11] they're actually come to make us better
[42:13] many times that you know and I know
[42:16] there's people that we know that we work
[42:18] with and whether they're Christians are
[42:20] not but when there's situations
[42:21] sometimes that's come their way
[42:23] sometimes you realize that there is
[42:25] something about them there's not any
[42:27] sweetness at all but there's actually a
[42:29] bitterness you find people that when
[42:32] they have a disagreement with this
[42:33] person or this person and they look at
[42:36] it as though it's that person instead of
[42:38] recognizing that that there is a molding
[42:41] and a shaping and that we all have needs
[42:43] in our lives really as believers when we
[42:45] look at that and there is is something
[42:47] maybe between of this person and that
[42:50] person and to realize that God will
[42:52] permit these things to actually temper
[42:55] our lives and mold us and shape us
[42:57] because this life it's not about our
[43:00] comfort in this life brother Brandon
[43:02] would say like this and the message I
[43:03] know he said we pray for comfort and he
[43:06] says God gives us the best comfort that
[43:08] we can have tests and trials he said
[43:11] that's the greatest comfort that we can
[43:13] have on this side of the river
[43:15] he said because when we get on the other
[43:17] side is when we will actually receive
[43:19] our comfort and our rest truly as a
[43:22] born-again child of God we do have rest
[43:25] and comfort in our soul even when we're
[43:27] looking at a situation and we don't know
[43:29] how that the situation is going to turn
[43:32] out we don't know even when we're
[43:34] praying about many things we don't have
[43:36] unless God would reveal it personally we
[43:38] don't know the outcome or the pathway
[43:40] and how things themselves will come to
[43:42] pass but when we do pray we know that we
[43:45] are praying according to the will of God
[43:47] and we are looking for the Lord to move
[43:49] on the behalf of our need and through it
[43:51] all God will show his love and his care
[43:55] and his power to our lives but the brown
[43:58] would say it like this many times God
[44:00] loves to get us into a place to where he
[44:03] can
[44:03] show his love and his power to us and I
[44:07] want to take this example here tonight
[44:09] on the the healing power in the Word of
[44:12] God and and to look at this and when we
[44:15] reading here in Exodus 15 they come upon
[44:18] a situation and it is a situation they
[44:22] don't know what to do and Moses begins
[44:25] to cry out to God and God shows him a
[44:28] tree a little tree that is present and
[44:32] when Moses had cast that tree into the
[44:34] waters the waters changed from being
[44:37] bitter to actually be coming to a place
[44:40] of refreshing and drinkable it was not
[44:43] something that God did or bypass that of
[44:46] his prophet but here God shows his
[44:49] prophet that in the midst of this
[44:51] situation I have not abandoned you
[44:54] I have not forsaken you as a matter of
[44:56] fact I am right here in the midst of
[44:59] this test or this trial right with you
[45:02] the thing that had to happen it was very
[45:04] much like that of I believe it was
[45:06] Elijah and Gaza remember gaze and was
[45:09] looking at the circumstances that he saw
[45:11] and he thought how in the world are we
[45:13] going to make it out of this situation
[45:15] but Elijah what did he do he asked God
[45:18] opened this young man's eyes that he
[45:22] might see you know Elijah himself there
[45:24] was a lot of things he could have said
[45:26] to Gaza but there was something about it
[45:29] that Elijah had had favor with God to
[45:32] where God Himself would move in a way to
[45:34] open this young man's eyes to where he
[45:37] would be able to see what was there
[45:40] present among them you know brother
[45:42] Graham said Elijah didn't even see those
[45:44] angels he said and Elijah was standing
[45:47] on the Word of God that said the angels
[45:49] of God are encamped around him that fear
[45:51] him and love him I believe that with all
[45:53] my heart but that's the kind of stop and
[45:56] the ruggedness that God brings out in
[45:59] the life of a believer that will grow I
[46:01] see it
[46:01] or whether I feel it God said it and
[46:04] what God said he meant what he said any
[46:07] sup what he said and he's pressing to
[46:09] perform that word and so like that
[46:12] situation brother Graham said God never
[46:14] brought the Angels down
[46:16] he said the angels were always there and
[46:19] and when in we recognize that the same
[46:22] way with the word in this hour it was
[46:25] always here he said God was always here
[46:27] but now he changes the scene of his
[46:29] servant and with Moses he opened Moses
[46:33] eyes to the tree that was there I would
[46:35] say for every one of us whether you're
[46:37] in a trial going through a trial or
[46:39] you're out of one every time we are
[46:42] thankful for the mercy of God to open
[46:44] our eyes that we might see that tree
[46:48] that is standing there in the midst and
[46:50] if we can just move to that place
[46:52] because as a believer when God opens our
[46:55] eyes there is an attraction in the heart
[46:58] of the believer the believer is
[47:00] attracted to Christ and Christ is the
[47:03] word and when that is unfolded in that
[47:05] moment that believer quickly takes a
[47:08] hold of that word and immediately when
[47:10] the word of God is taken brother there
[47:13] is a sweetener that comes into that lot
[47:15] that'll take care of the bitter waters
[47:18] it sweetens it to where that the trial
[47:20] itself that was filled with bitterness
[47:23] you are able to stand as a child of God
[47:26] and rejoice not in the trial but rejoice
[47:29] in the God who is present in the midst
[47:32] of the trial oh my it changes our
[47:35] eyesight from that of just in this
[47:38] natural to be able to live towards those
[47:40] things that are eternal and here within
[47:43] that you know brother Branham would take
[47:46] us here and I tell you within this hour
[47:48] you realize that the scriptures as we
[47:50] are reading the scriptures in this hour
[47:52] we are not reading the scriptures under
[47:55] the inspiration of a man's thought
[47:57] pattern but here is the inspiration of
[48:00] God's thought that is poured out upon
[48:02] the word in this hour brother many
[48:05] people have had the Bible but you know
[48:07] to read the Bible is
[48:09] but to read it and to actually read it
[48:12] under the inspiration of Almighty God
[48:15] brother it opens up a pathway for us to
[48:18] be able to walk in it actually brings
[48:21] the word from print to light to a person
[48:24] it makes it a living reality where you
[48:27] and I can look back into this and see it
[48:29] present for our life and see us in the
[48:32] word that is not the inspiration of them
[48:35] that's the inspiration of God that is
[48:38] coming this generation and it's come for
[48:41] you and I hallelujah for you and I to be
[48:45] able to look but even in the midst
[48:47] generation when the telling apart and we
[48:51] see this falling apart this crumbling
[48:53] and this crumbling but yet in the midst
[48:56] of the inspiration we have found the
[48:59] tree in the midst of this generation
[49:01] that Christ coming into our lives it has
[49:05] brought us sweetening where the world is
[49:08] filled with hatred and that body and
[49:10] trucebreakers it's perilous times but in
[49:13] the midst of this path he is hiding us
[49:16] in his pavilion in the secret of his
[49:20] Tabernacle no one there David can say
[49:23] now will I sing praises of joy why we
[49:28] have found him hallelujah Oh mom don't
[49:35] you love the Lord where the brem said
[49:39] like this and the message Christ
