[27:13] here this morning and so thankful for
[27:15] the grace of God that has come to us and
[27:20] if we could we want to just look here
[27:23] right into the scriptures and I'm just
[27:25] gonna read one verse of scripture and
[27:28] then we'll just ask the blessing of the
[27:31] Lord upon the word and that's out of
[27:33] Ephesians 6 verse 17 I want to just draw
[27:36] from that scripture and take the helmet
[27:40] of salvation and the sword of the Spirit
[27:45] which is the word of God
[27:49] and we want to just deal with that a
[27:51] little bit more here this morning the
[27:55] sword of the Spirit which is the word of
[27:59] God let's just bow our heads and our
[28:02] hearts before him
[28:03] Heavenly Father Lord as we are just so
[28:09] thankful Oh God for your great mercy
[28:13] we're thankful that Lord that Calvary is
[28:18] not just something Lord of a historical
[28:22] event but God there is victory that was
[28:27] released that day on Calvary and when
[28:31] that that day becomes a reality Lord in
[28:36] our hearts Oh God then the joy bells
[28:40] ring Lord what Liberty sounds within our
[28:45] hearts and Lord we're thankful God Lord
[28:49] to be partakers of your divine nature
[28:52] Lord and we just asked this morning that
[28:55] Lord that your presence would just come
[28:58] among us Lord visiting every home and
[29:02] every heart in a very personal way I
[29:05] pray that God that you would just just
[29:08] take control now Lord minister to our
[29:11] hearts Lord as the songs of Zion have
[29:14] been sung oh God we just ask that you'll
[29:18] come and not if there be anything any
[29:20] spirit or anything that would be
[29:23] contrary we ask God may the Holy Spirit
[29:26] just drive that out oh God
[29:29] because the Lord in reality the person
[29:32] or individuals Lord they wouldn't want
[29:35] to be that way so we ask God if there be
[29:38] anything that's contrary Lord to your
[29:40] nature to your word Lord we ask that God
[29:43] that the Holy Spirit Lord would just
[29:46] soul drive that out Oh God that the word
[29:49] might find its mark and its place God in
[29:52] every heart in every life Lord we just
[29:55] ask that God your blessing Lord just
[29:59] visiting every heart in every home Lord
[30:02] where they are gathered
[30:03] Lauren Lord as we look into your word
[30:06] now we ask these things Lord all in the
[30:09] precious name of Jesus Christ for the
[30:12] glory of Almighty God amen and amen amen
[30:16] god bless yous are being seated
[30:19] I want to continue to look at this with
[30:29] the sword of the Spirit and we're
[30:34] looking at our our armor our warfare and
[30:39] what belongs to us as the children of
[30:43] God and Paul is speaking to the Ephesian
[30:49] believers admonishing their hearts and
[30:53] their lives to be strengthened with the
[30:57] power of his might we know that it must
[31:01] be God's strength inside of us that is a
[31:05] promise all the way in through the
[31:07] scriptures that it must be God's
[31:09] strength and when we say God's strength
[31:12] we know that even within that it's that
[31:16] God is just working within our hearts
[31:20] and our lives as we are yielded to him
[31:23] and when we we come into this place as
[31:27] Paul remember taking inspiration from
[31:30] looking at the soldier of which he was
[31:34] he was chained to there when he was
[31:37] there in Rome awaiting his trial and he
[31:40] would be able to examine the different
[31:42] parts of this armor and he would be able
[31:45] to take inspiration from there now that
[31:49] in itself we understand the inspiration
[31:53] that's given it comes into a
[31:54] supernatural part for you and I because
[31:58] though a person can look at us and say
[32:01] you don't look no different than anybody
[32:02] else
[32:03] but yet remember David had on an armor
[32:06] but yet it didn't look like he had on
[32:09] armor he didn't have on armor like Saul
[32:12] had but he did have armor and David
[32:15] David's armor was actually greater than
[32:17] the armor that saw had and the armor
[32:20] that David had was the Word of God that
[32:23] had been anointed in his life and that's
[32:27] what the real armor of God is is when
[32:30] the word has been
[32:33] wrapped up in our lives and has been
[32:35] expressed that's the full armor of God
[32:38] so there's a full issue and with this in
[32:42] mind when we think of that of the sword
[32:46] of the Spirit and I just keep moving
[32:47] with him these these points and being
[32:50] deliberate in it and when this sword by
[32:54] was thereupon that Roman soldier when
[32:56] they would look at that sword that sword
[32:59] Paul maybe Paul asking you know the the
[33:03] man was the sword and maybe talking
[33:05] about it I don't know but at any rate
[33:06] the sword itself that was upon the side
[33:10] of that soldier was it was what they
[33:12] called the gladium it was 24 inches long
[33:15] and the end the change that had come
[33:18] about is that it was sharp on both sides
[33:20] so we would cut coming and going and
[33:24] this sword when it was given to that
[33:27] Roman soldier it was noted it was a
[33:32] symbol of his full citizenship
[33:37] so these things that I'm just saying it
[33:41] in this manner that there are things of
[33:44] what God has done that we must take
[33:48] account of in our lives and you never
[33:52] get away from the simplicity of the
[33:56] working of what Christ has done in our
[34:00] lives what he has done is the strength
[34:05] that gives the you and I the strength to
[34:09] stand in this moment it is that courage
[34:13] you see it's something it's a work
[34:15] that's not a work of man Solomon would
[34:19] say under inspiration in the book of
[34:21] khaleesies whatsoever thing thou do us
[34:24] is perfect when God does something it's
[34:27] perfect this is why the confidence in
[34:30] the word it brings us to what is the
[34:34] real new birth the baptism of the Holy
[34:39] Ghost being born again all one in the
[34:41] same it brings us to the real reality of
[34:45] what it is and showing us so that our
[34:48] confidence it is not placed in emotions
[34:51] or experiences but whatever experience
[34:55] it comes into the word and we see the
[34:58] word present in our life that's where
[35:02] our courage is drawn from because you
[35:06] can have an emotion you can have an
[35:08] experience you can have a feeling and
[35:10] the very next day or this day you don't
[35:12] feel like it and we all remember Bill
[35:14] Duran talked about in his early even in
[35:17] his walk early walk was God and he had
[35:19] to recognize feeling does not mean
[35:23] anything he said for if we walk by
[35:26] feelings he said the devil can beat us
[35:29] around the stump every day but he said
[35:32] where I had to come to rest is you rest
[35:34] in the word see this is the goal of what
[35:38] the message of the hour has come to do
[35:41] it is that original message to establish
[35:45] us in the
[35:47] atonement by the baptism of the holy
[35:50] ghost so then we're then we recognize by
[35:55] the seal of the Living God
[35:57] in our hearts we recognize our full
[36:01] citizenship full authority so this is
[36:06] where the scripture how it comes in as
[36:10] we were looking here last week in the
[36:14] book of Galatians chapter 5 and verse 6
[36:18] faith worketh by love
[36:24] that's how faith is operative now
[36:28] remember the scripture said though I
[36:31] have faith to move all mountains and I
[36:34] have not charity it's nothing so let me
[36:38] just say to you like this it shows there
[36:40] is a dividing line where a person can
[36:43] have great faith and yet be missing what
[36:48] is necessary are you with me they can
[36:53] have great faith this is the thing
[36:54] sometimes then in our minds we trying to
[36:57] figure out this person the miracles
[37:00] performed or they prayed for this person
[37:02] or this and then you see after some
[37:04] period of time
[37:05] here they are shipwrecked or they walk
[37:08] away from the truth and in your mind a
[37:11] mind cut tries to comprehend how was
[37:14] that done remember it was faith jesus
[37:17] said many will come to me in that day
[37:19] and they will say did not I cast out
[37:23] Devils in thy name is alright but Jesus
[37:26] will show the dividing line I never knew
[37:29] you you workers of iniquity you see what
[37:34] it did it built a false confidence in
[37:37] something that was not true
[37:40] you see this is why when the scripture
[37:43] said God is love
[37:47] remember the Holy Ghost and God are not
[37:50] two separate people it is the same
[37:52] person this is where that the baptism of
[37:56] the Holy Ghost is the love of God oh I
[38:01] tell you it's hard I just feel like just
[38:04] moving here but you see this is where
[38:06] our as the Prophet would put it our try
[38:09] up for capstone it comes down upon our
[38:12] lives that we were always sheep we were
[38:15] always sons and daughters of God now we
[38:18] come to the realization by the Holy
[38:21] Ghost because he gives the Holy Ghost
[38:24] and the spirit it comes upon sons and
[38:28] daughters who did it come upon that a
[38:30] pentecost sons and daughters of god who
[38:33] did it fall upon chlorin sons and
[38:35] daughters of god who did it come upon on
[38:37] the river Jordan it came upon the Lord
[38:40] Jesus this was the tabernacle that was
[38:43] that was ordained of God to bring
[38:45] Redemption is that right you see the
[38:48] Holy Ghost is a claiming work but the
[38:51] claim is revealed in our hearts that the
[38:55] claim that God has made and it becomes
[38:57] revealed as the seal of the Living God
[39:00] that I belong to him Oh glory hallelujah
[39:07] you see it becomes an absolute which is
[39:10] an end of all strife this is where the
[39:15] dividing line faith worketh by love so
[39:19] this the dividing line is not just about
[39:22] as we said faith to move mountains
[39:23] miracles and say and listen miracles are
[39:26] a part of the real word you're in signs
[39:29] and wonders said they shall follow them
[39:31] that believe you understand what I'm
[39:33] talking about but this right here faith
[39:35] worketh by love we're talking about
[39:38] inheriting and taking the promises that
[39:42] belonged to us as believers we're not
[39:45] talking about just coming to church and
[39:48] my you know we see this miracle let me
[39:50] see that miracle I had prayed for this
[39:52] winner this was done or that was done
[39:54] but it must be faith that is taking
[39:59] promises
[40:00] this hour and the only way you can take
[40:02] promises for this hour it must be a
[40:05] faith that is governed by the love of
[40:08] God hallelujah glory be to God and now
[40:14] think of this this is where in this hour
[40:18] it's going to take a greater faith than
[40:22] what has been previously who can produce
[40:26] that man can produce that this is let me
[40:30] just say that this is God's
[40:32] responsibility are you with me it's
[40:36] God's responsibility to bring forth what
[40:41] is needed to move our faith into that of
[40:46] rapturing faith that is the
[40:50] responsibility of our husband of our
[40:53] bridegroom and I'm gonna I'm saying that
[40:57] like this he is performing his word in
[41:02] our lives this word this anointed word
[41:07] it is it listen I love to feel the
[41:11] presence of God but brother this
[41:13] anointed word it's doing more than a
[41:15] feeling it's driving away doubt and
[41:20] unbelief it is driving back the clouds
[41:24] upon our minds and upon our eyes this
[41:27] word that's why there is a prevailing
[41:30] power in this word that you know there's
[41:33] something in you that is greater
[41:39] hallelujah I feel like preaching a
[41:43] little bit
[41:46] this is where our confidence our
[41:51] confidence is in his love for us that's
[41:59] how promises are taken now it's not a
[42:03] confidence of just looking out there and
[42:06] say well he came down and he died on
[42:09] Calvary that's an expression of love you
[42:11] realized before you can ever love
[42:13] somebody else and really move into that
[42:15] there's got to be an expression of love
[42:18] or vice versa you express right the
[42:21] Bible said he that have friends truth
[42:23] himself friendly right even an
[42:25] expression of love you begin to pursue
[42:28] your wife maybe she started to pursue
[42:30] you who knows but you understand it was
[42:32] an expression are you with me now this
[42:35] is what Paul is trying to in the book of
[42:38] Romans and John is anointed by the
[42:41] Spirit of God to point out in the book
[42:43] of John that we are to understand the
[42:46] manifestation of God's love but remember
[42:48] God's love his manifestation he did not
[42:51] come here haphazardly he came here for
[42:54] redemption redemption is not an
[42:58] afterthought redemption is a reality
[43:00] from a forethought amen redemption to
[43:05] claim to buy back what rightfully
[43:07] belongs to one glory be to God so this
[43:12] is where that our our love see faith and
[43:16] love as brother Brandon would put it in
[43:18] perfect faith they are kinfolks they go
[43:22] together and to recognize listen this
[43:26] there this is a real real solid ground
[43:30] that you can stand on you can look has
[43:33] the Prophet says look what you were and
[43:37] look what you are he said then if you
[43:42] can see that then you got confidence he
[43:46] seen something in you
[43:49] and it's confidence what his covenants
[43:53] trust what is trust it is faith what are
[43:56] we resting it in his love and his love
[44:00] is conveyed from Calvary revealed by the
[44:04] spirit of the atonement that you are
[44:07] chosen and beloved of Almighty God that
[44:10] is the work of the atonement in the life
[44:14] in the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[44:18] what an evidence to stand on that's an
[44:21] evidence in your life then you know
[44:23] we're not just looking somewhere let me
[44:25] just say this morning if you the first
[44:28] thing you do must have and understand is
[44:31] he did die for your sin debt you've got
[44:35] to believe that first you've got to
[44:36] start somewhere
[44:38] you've got to start somewhere now listen
[44:41] to me you can stand right there on that
[44:43] word and you can start even with that
[44:46] word and say I'm saved oh my Oh glory be
[44:53] to God I feel so good I feel like just
[44:56] running well glory be to God in the
[45:00] highest this is ground for you to stand
[45:03] on but you know what you was but look
[45:07] what you are now and you say what does
[45:11] that have to do with the sword of the
[45:12] Spirit the sword of the Spirit must be
[45:15] handled with the strong hand of faith
[45:18] and there's only one thing that can
[45:20] bring real genuine faith and that is the
[45:23] love of God and God revealing his word
[45:26] by his Spirit that you are included and
[45:29] you are always a part of me brother and
[45:31] you see the effect it's not just a
[45:34] message that is passed through you it's
[45:37] a message that has taken a hold upon
[45:39] your life it has changed you the love of
[45:45] the world has passed away what are you
[45:49] saying I'm saying get out the gladium
[45:51] you're a full citizen
[45:57] whoo hallelujah you see God wants to
[46:05] make these things so clear and real his
[46:09] life he keeps reminding you and I he
[46:12] keeps showing you and I he keeps making
[46:15] it more and more real and just look at
[46:17] that that simplicity that what he has
[46:19] just spoken right here this morning that
[46:22] is enough for you to stand on it takes
[46:24] you it takes your attention away from
[46:28] your goodness and it brings it to the
[46:30] place it needs to be when Shamgar beat
[46:37] back the enemy with an ox code what did
[46:41] he do it based on that covenant he knew
[46:45] I'm a circumcised Jew hey man Shangri
[46:49] was not looking on was that good
[46:51] how good was I this week or how was like
[46:54] this or how was that that hinders faith
[46:56] come on now it hinders faith but faith
[47:00] is aware Paul dealt with the Galatian
[47:02] Church faith must rest in the sovereign
[47:05] complete work of Almighty God of what
[47:08] God has done in you what do you say
[47:13] sometimes you may not feel but you stand
[47:16] upon the word that you know the love of
[47:20] the world has passed from your life
[47:23] Luther sent me why don't you say I'm
[47:25] telling you quit looking at yourself
[47:28] you'll never get anywhere listen even in
[47:31] the initial beginnings where God is
[47:34] dealing with the life and they might
[47:36] feel so low and the devil just porn it
[47:39] on like you can never be you can never
[47:41] tell an you God will never tell you that
[47:43] that's a laugh and the pits of hell
[47:45] Satan is afraid if you start listening
[47:48] to the spirit and start yielding he will
[47:51] be driven out of your life because
[47:53] brother this word pacts authority
[47:56] whether it's believed in the heart the
[47:59] devil he begins to turn loose why faith
[48:02] causes him to turn loose
[48:06] what would you do I would receive his
[48:09] love that's what I do I just say man
[48:12] lord help down my unbelief
[48:15] I'd say Lord clean me up Lord God I'd
[48:17] accept I'd say Lord I receive your grace
[48:21] that's what I do and in doing that you
[48:25] black the devil's eye
[48:33] notice this here in the book of Solomon
[48:37] see this is where let me just work with
[48:39] this thought here a little bit this is
[48:42] where this this reality comes as it
[48:46] moves into our heart it's settled on
[48:49] that solid ground of who we are in Jesus
[48:53] Christ Song of Solomon 6 8 there are
[48:57] threescore queens and four score
[48:59] concubines and virgins without number my
[49:03] dove my undefiled is but one she is the
[49:08] only one of her mother did you hear what
[49:10] he called you my dove
[49:15] who's that doubt the death is the Holy
[49:18] Spirit come on now it's that which
[49:21] brings forth to manifest the feminine
[49:24] form that was hidden in mystery in the
[49:27] groom and he calls her my dove which
[49:30] what is dove it is that of the Spirit of
[49:33] God the life of Jesus Christ now
[49:35] revealed in a mini membered body
[49:38] revealed in your life what's he looking
[49:40] at my dove you certainly can't call this
[49:44] his dove he's calling the reflection of
[49:49] his life his image that has come forth
[49:52] from your womb my dove my undefiled is
[50:00] from one
[50:01] my first birth and your first birth
[50:04] cannot claim being undefined that's not
[50:06] what the blood of Jesus Christ does the
[50:08] blood of Jesus Christ don't kill up
[50:10] don't don't you know clean up our first
[50:12] birth no I don't the blood of Jesus
[50:14] Christ comes in and it annihilates or
[50:17] removes that old man that's why the
[50:21] scripture would tell us over and over
[50:23] Paul would write up in Colossians and
[50:24] Romans and refer to it that old man he
[50:27] would refer to Allah he's got addy he's
[50:29] got to die you can't clean that guy up
[50:32] it's like putting the pig inside of a
[50:34] house putting the bow tie on and
[50:35] cleaning him up and he'll look out the
[50:37] door and he'll wait for one chance to
[50:39] get out in that mud hole why because he
[50:41] still got the nature of the pig on the
[50:43] inside but if you can ever ignite the
[50:46] nature of a lamb on the inside of that
[50:48] Pig brother you don't have to worry
[50:50] about him wallowing in the mud no more
[50:52] on the outside this still looks like the
[50:54] same old temple but brother there's been
[50:56] a new nature set on the inside you'll
[50:59] look at him and say looks just like the
[51:00] rest of the pigs well why is he actin
[51:02] different it's because of the character
[51:04] of life that's on the inside of him and
[51:07] he's only responding and hapten glory be
[51:10] to God to the character of the life
[51:13] that's on the inside of him my undefiled
[51:16] is what one she is the only one of her
[51:19] mother she is the choice one of her that
[51:22] bear her but daughter's saw her and
[51:25] blessed her yeah the Queen's and the
[51:28] combines they praised her who is
[51:31] she
[51:31] verse 10 that look at forth as the
[51:34] morning fair as the moon clear as the
[51:37] Sun and terrible as an army with banners
[51:45] then they read another scripture that it
[51:47] is spoke of her just like that in the
[51:49] same same scripture chapter thou art
[51:53] beautiful oh my love has tearsa
[51:57] comely as Jerusalem terrible as an army
[52:02] with banners so to see the beauty of the
[52:08] love of God revealed in the feminine
[52:12] form my dove my undefiled one and to see
[52:16] that beauty what delicateness what grace
[52:19] but yet when it comes to stand for all
[52:23] that her husband is all that her lover
[52:27] is she will stand and then the approach
[52:31] is she's terrible as an army with
[52:34] banners terrible meaning awesome
[52:38] dreadful what she knows who she belongs
[52:41] to
[52:42] she's acting with a genuine courage that
[52:45] she knows that it is not Ivan liver but
[52:48] Christ that liveth in me my love my dove
[52:51] my undefiled one all my love you see she
[52:55] is taking in of what he's saying you
[52:57] know friends it will make no difference
[52:59] it'll do no good by just hearing the
[53:02] word you've got to receive it you might
[53:04] look at it and say we're both saying I
[53:06] just can't seem to see that for my life
[53:08] but it isn't about whether you see that
[53:11] right now for your life but it is to
[53:13] accept what he is saying about you let's
[53:17] get it on the right track it's not your
[53:19] eyes and then God's going according to
[53:21] your eyes but it is God's eyes that are
[53:24] set forth upon us that we might be able
[53:27] to see ourselves as God sees us
[53:30] and it all starts out sometimes it
[53:32] starts out with the simplicity of us
[53:34] receiving and confessing even what we
[53:37] don't even feel or even that we don't
[53:40] even believe clear down into the depths
[53:42] yet
[53:44] but remember simple simple statement I
[53:47] know but brother Bantam told us he says
[53:50] your confession your positive confession
[53:53] will make will bring your body into
[53:56] subjection it'll drop from here down
[54:01] here that's what we want
[54:04] Solomon Song of Solomon to verse four he
[54:07] brought me to the banqueting table
[54:09] notice he brought me here to the lying
[54:12] house now this this chapter it's written
[54:14] about love that that part of love and
[54:17] where that he is the bridegroom is
[54:19] bringing her into this place to be able
[54:22] to make himself known to her and she
[54:25] herself would make him make herself
[54:27] known to him notice he hath brought me
[54:29] to his banqueting table his the wine
[54:32] house the place where the wine is
[54:34] offered up and truly in this our brother
[54:37] we have been brought to the banqueting
[54:39] house we have been brought to that of
[54:41] the time of a wine that has actually
[54:44] been given out they could not say this
[54:46] in the days of Luther they could not say
[54:48] it in the days of Wesley they couldn't
[54:50] even say this in the days of Azusa
[54:52] Street but brother it's a time right now
[54:55] where there is a word that has come
[54:57] about an evening time light to produce
[55:00] evening time results there is a bride on
[55:04] earth not she will be the bride
[55:06] there is the bride right now on this
[55:09] earth and she is clothed she is
[55:12] concealed beneath the blood of Jesus
[55:15] Christ he has brought me to his
[55:18] banqueting house her glory and his
[55:22] banner over me was love Oh glory be to
[55:27] God and no wonder we need more wine no
[55:32] wonder we need more wine what does it do
[55:33] it what what do they you know they'll
[55:35] tell people well you know if you just
[55:36] take a little bit of wine it'll help you
[55:38] relax how they tell people those things
[55:40] and maybe you know it actually does with
[55:42] on somebody's body but all how much
[55:45] greater in the natural when we talk
[55:46] about real stimulation brother in charge
[55:49] taking hold in our life it causes you to
[55:51] love people you can't even understand it
[55:53] you can today they're totally different
[55:55] from you temperaments makeups or
[55:57] whatever more
[55:57] but there's something that just gets
[55:59] ahold of you you just love everybody and
[56:01] you realize the more and more that you
[56:03] will stay at the banqueting house
[56:05] staying in the presence of God brother
[56:07] this is what Jude said keep yourself in
[56:10] the love of God oh my and his banner his
[56:15] standard how but he has brought me here
[56:17] he's been loved how has God brought you
[56:20] how is he brought me to that of the new
[56:22] birth for where we are now
[56:23] even as adopted sons and daughters of
[56:25] God how has he done it did he do it out
[56:27] of you know hammering us did he do it
[56:30] out of judgment no his word comes to
[56:32] correctors but we perceive the word in
[56:34] that is love it's love letting us know
[56:37] hey there's a hold on your life but you
[56:40] don't have to submit to that hold any
[56:41] longer what is it it's the love of God
[56:44] that is sounding within the heart that
[56:46] lets us know that we can be free what's
[56:49] happening love is drawing us to him and
[56:53] the bride says stay me with flagons
[56:56] comfort me with apples for I am sick or
[57:01] overcome of love now let's look here at
[57:07] an example in the scripture and we have
[57:10] you just just look at the example of
[57:13] Queen Esther for just a few moments here
[57:16] this morning we find that here when
[57:19] Esther we know the situation that had
[57:21] come up were Queen Vashti she refused to
[57:25] come at the king's call he wanted her to
[57:30] come at an appointed time but she said
[57:32] I'm not going up there
[57:33] you're not going to show me off in front
[57:36] of all of the rest of those people up
[57:38] there you see she still had her own will
[57:42] but here comes the time for that of
[57:46] Esther you see this is where the reality
[57:48] of the word has it as brought four
[57:50] children down through the ages think
[57:52] about the bride being made up down
[57:54] through the ages it's been the body of
[57:56] Jesus Christ every time that the word
[57:58] has went forth it is that before the
[58:00] overcomers in that age to where their
[58:03] will has absolutely been overcome or
[58:06] they have submitted their
[58:07] to the will of God and they have
[58:09] reflected that portion of the word that
[58:13] of the body that was in that day in that
[58:15] time and now we come to a place to where
[58:18] this scripture here that was wrote that
[58:20] of Esther we realize this is a time it
[58:23] speaks of this time that we're in
[58:25] because remember in the Book of
[58:28] Revelations it says I stand on the door
[58:30] and knock and remember he speaks of how
[58:34] that the actual spirit of this age is
[58:36] one that says I am rich i'm increased
[58:39] with goods i have need of nothing but
[58:42] yet the Spirit of God would point back
[58:45] and say but you're naked now they might
[58:47] have been fully physically clothed but
[58:50] you see that ain't the clothing you go
[58:51] buy it you know a person might be so
[58:54] clothed let me just put it on down they
[58:56] might be clothed with quotes they've
[58:58] clothed with scriptures but it's being
[59:00] covered by the blood you're still under
[59:03] the judgment you must come under the
[59:06] blood the token must be applied this is
[59:10] the hour that we can see for Esther
[59:13] where the church themselves has put him
[59:16] out they have rejected him from being
[59:19] the same they do not want to be
[59:21] displayed they do not want the display
[59:23] of his divine power and nature will they
[59:26] want his blessings they want his
[59:28] miracles they want all those Saints but
[59:30] they don't want him because in order to
[59:31] have him he comes in and takes rulership
[59:34] over that life but remember he'll never
[59:37] do it forcefully it must always be
[59:40] willingly and here is Esther coming on
[59:44] the scene now we recognize that within
[59:47] this here that hair as Esther comes into
[59:51] this time she comes to her appointed
[59:53] meeting there before the King and the
[59:56] Bible tells us here in verse 15 that
[59:59] when you know she asked her it says the
[1:00:02] daughter of I beheld the uncle of
[1:00:03] Mordecai who had taken her for his
[1:00:06] daughter was come to go in unto the king
[1:00:09] she required nothing but what Haggai the
[1:00:12] Kings Chamberlain the keeper of the
[1:00:14] women appointed so a note in right away
[1:00:17] you see it's not she's not taking what
[1:00:19] she feels the King would
[1:00:21] like she's not saying well he'll like
[1:00:23] this if I if I do this or if I do that
[1:00:25] you see she's listened to me now
[1:00:27] she's in herself it's not trying to
[1:00:31] present things that would please him she
[1:00:34] is wanting to walk in there with the
[1:00:37] word covering her life because it will
[1:00:40] be that word reflected in her life that
[1:00:43] will please the king it's what he
[1:00:45] already has in his palace all glory
[1:00:48] being a God God has already provided in
[1:00:51] his word that's why the Prophet could
[1:00:54] say in marriage of the lamb in 1962 he
[1:00:57] said we have the material on the earth
[1:01:00] now to make the bride ready we have that
[1:01:03] material what is it that genuine holy
[1:01:06] goes the word coming to prepare her
[1:01:10] you see God did not add a new Bible the
[1:01:13] seven seals the opening of the seven
[1:01:16] seals on the back side of the book it
[1:01:19] was not another book it was not
[1:01:21] something that was contrary but John was
[1:01:24] instructed by the Spirit of God writing
[1:01:27] not John but seal it up and when those
[1:01:30] seven thunders would begin to sound
[1:01:33] brother it would be the seven thunders
[1:01:35] sounding the literal voice of Almighty
[1:01:38] God in Revelation that would turn the
[1:01:41] very hearts of the children back to the
[1:01:44] Apostolic fathers hallelujah glory be to
[1:01:51] God what was it it was already here Oh
[1:01:59] blessed be his name
[1:02:02] so after look at this
[1:02:05] Esther obtained favor in the sight of
[1:02:08] all them that looked upon her she was
[1:02:11] taken under king a haze raised in his
[1:02:14] house royal in the tenth month which is
[1:02:17] to Beth in the seventh year of his reign
[1:02:21] she goes in she goes into him
[1:02:25] revelations Tim seven are you with me
[1:02:28] she's taken there into the presence of
[1:02:31] the King you must become one with this
[1:02:34] word
[1:02:35] and the king look at this the King loved
[1:02:38] Esther above all the women oh let me
[1:02:41] preach on this a minute he didn't say
[1:02:43] the King didn't love the other women he
[1:02:46] didn't say that those other women went
[1:02:48] back out into the rest of the provinces
[1:02:50] no they came to him he loved them but
[1:02:53] they went to the house of the concubines
[1:02:56] they never went back out into the world
[1:02:58] well I'll tell you you're talking about
[1:03:00] saving grace
[1:03:01] there are many that will be saved if
[1:03:06] there had not been a decree for that a
[1:03:09] decree that had been made letters that
[1:03:12] had been made if there wasn't a gospel
[1:03:15] to go forth because of the flow there
[1:03:17] would have been many there would have
[1:03:18] been no house of a concubines but
[1:03:20] remember the rest of these women they
[1:03:23] were virgins now foolish but they were
[1:03:25] did not they were placed into the house
[1:03:28] of the concubines but there was
[1:03:31] something about Esther that he loved her
[1:03:34] more than the rest of the women you can
[1:03:37] see why the real election of God it's
[1:03:40] called loving his own children that came
[1:03:43] out of the loins of his mind of his word
[1:03:46] God loves them above those that are
[1:03:49] saved he loves them because why they are
[1:03:53] of his own self and the King loved
[1:03:57] Esther above all the women now watch
[1:04:00] this and she obtained Grace and favor in
[1:04:07] his sight more than all the virgins
[1:04:13] now here's what he did she now
[1:04:18] could see this no doubt it would be
[1:04:21] something that would be witnessed in
[1:04:24] their conversations something about it
[1:04:27] that is so inclining to her but he wants
[1:04:31] to make it personal to her right now
[1:04:34] he wants his love to be made personal so
[1:04:38] here's what he did his love is now
[1:04:41] displayed so that he set the royal crown
[1:04:45] upon her head and made her Queen instead
[1:04:50] of Ashton so she actually has a crowning
[1:04:55] ornament of his love she is queen she is
[1:05:00] Queen because of his love that one now
[1:05:03] he has seen reflected in her she had a
[1:05:06] meekness about her life meekness meaning
[1:05:09] that it was not concerned or consumed
[1:05:11] with self
[1:05:12] she had a meekness about her remember
[1:05:14] that of the Bible says that a meek and
[1:05:16] quiet spirit is a high precious price in
[1:05:19] the side of Almighty God so here he or
[1:05:23] she has obtained favor and grace and
[1:05:25] force so that she might know this how
[1:05:28] would she know it because many women
[1:05:31] have went into his house and come out
[1:05:33] now you might say well you know he ain't
[1:05:35] sending her back to the house of the
[1:05:37] concubines but what is it that separates
[1:05:40] her from the rest that went into the
[1:05:42] house of the concubines what separates
[1:05:45] it it's because of the love that he has
[1:05:48] bestowed upon her and he has placed the
[1:05:51] crown upon her head all you see this is
[1:05:55] why listen to me now this is why that
[1:05:59] the revelation of Jesus Christ it is a
[1:06:02] very personal thing let me just kind of
[1:06:07] drop this in here just a little bit
[1:06:08] though the message goes forth remember
[1:06:11] the message was letters that went to all
[1:06:14] the provinces the message went to all of
[1:06:16] them now many many gathered that men
[1:06:19] there are many virgins that came now
[1:06:21] remember this the message itself it goes
[1:06:23] forth to all but the message is received
[1:06:27] individually behold I stand at the door
[1:06:29] and knock
[1:06:30] he's talking to an individual is that
[1:06:33] right he's put outside of the church but
[1:06:36] now notice be call goes to an individual
[1:06:39] let let he him that hath an ear that
[1:06:42] whosoever will hear my voice and open
[1:06:46] notice individual it is though a message
[1:06:49] that goes forth to all but it is
[1:06:52] actually received by individuals brother
[1:06:56] man would put it like this he said the
[1:06:58] message is received individually by only
[1:07:01] a certain qualified group in a certain
[1:07:04] way each individual of that group is one
[1:07:09] who has the ability to hear what the
[1:07:12] Spirit is saying by the way of the
[1:07:14] messengers those who here are not
[1:07:17] getting their own private revelation nor
[1:07:19] is a group getting their collective
[1:07:22] revelation but each person is hearing
[1:07:24] and receiving what the messenger has
[1:07:28] already received from God so let's just
[1:07:31] bring it simple here we come let's just
[1:07:33] say to our little church right here here
[1:07:35] we come into this church and a person
[1:07:38] can come and sit right here right under
[1:07:40] the preaching of the word proclaiming
[1:07:42] the message of the hour and the Spirit
[1:07:44] of God is breaking forth and he's
[1:07:46] revealing his word and his presence but
[1:07:49] remember what God is doing for the group
[1:07:52] he must be pressing for your life
[1:07:54] individually this is not just this is
[1:07:57] not a group revelation you see that's
[1:08:01] that's organizational ISM that's
[1:08:02] denominationalism we're walking by
[1:08:05] somebody else's previous thought that's
[1:08:07] how organizations thoughts
[1:08:08] it starts remember what light that
[1:08:10] Luther received he received that
[1:08:12] personally but there were many who came
[1:08:14] in behind him they never met that same
[1:08:17] God in the same way that Luther had met
[1:08:19] him and what does it become it becomes
[1:08:22] an organization it becomes a group
[1:08:24] revelation but remember a group
[1:08:27] revelation will never keep the wrath off
[1:08:29] of you you've got to be under the blood
[1:08:31] personally in your life this is why it
[1:08:35] takes the endowment of the Spirit of God
[1:08:37] to be able to open our ear
[1:08:40] and let me just tell you something the
[1:08:42] devil would like nothing more for you to
[1:08:44] look at and say my to seem like nothing
[1:08:46] makes sense I don't seem like I
[1:08:48] understand this let me just tell you
[1:08:50] something right now before God got ahold
[1:08:52] of my life I didn't understand it either
[1:08:54] I knew it was the truth but I didn't
[1:08:56] understand it but brother when he begin
[1:08:58] to open my eyes these are things they
[1:09:00] are not confusing to me this message
[1:09:03] regardless of what the unbelievers have
[1:09:05] said they wanted to make it as though it
[1:09:07] don't make sense the problem is their
[1:09:09] eyes were never anointed their hearts
[1:09:12] were never fully turned back and
[1:09:14] restored that's why they couldn't see it
[1:09:17] is doesn't matter how much a person
[1:09:18] studies it all has to do with the
[1:09:21] openness and the willingness and the
[1:09:23] Spirit of God to sovereignly
[1:09:24] revealed this word so it's not something
[1:09:27] there of just a group this is why it is
[1:09:30] personal vindication in the days in the
[1:09:36] days of lot in the days of Abraham
[1:09:40] it was personal vindication God coming
[1:09:43] down personally and how did God come
[1:09:46] down personally he appeared in flesh
[1:09:51] it's the way the same God has appeared
[1:09:54] in these last days let me just say
[1:09:55] something though the prophet has left
[1:09:57] the scene the mighty angel never left
[1:09:59] that same one remember it wasn't the
[1:10:02] Prophet that brought the mighty angel it
[1:10:05] was the mighty angel that was already
[1:10:06] come on now the Prince of God was
[1:10:08] already here now we find that dissent in
[1:10:11] Revelations 10 but what is it to make
[1:10:13] know that same one is here to lead us
[1:10:16] and to direct us into every promise that
[1:10:20] has been given to us and ministered to
[1:10:23] us in this hour so he's right here he's
[1:10:27] to be in our flesh this is what we were
[1:10:29] talking about earlier that personal
[1:10:31] vindication of the life of Christ being
[1:10:34] inside of our life his presence in our
[1:10:38] lives as an individual it was not it's
[1:10:40] not a membership it's not being around
[1:10:42] something I hope everybody's hearing me
[1:10:45] even out there on the internet that's
[1:10:47] why I'm preaching to all of us here
[1:10:49] it's
[1:10:49] about a group membership well I go to
[1:10:51] believer spoken word Tabernacle let me
[1:10:53] tell you something if you're not under
[1:10:55] the blood of Jesus Christ in the meeting
[1:10:58] you've never been sealed by the baptism
[1:11:01] of the Holy Ghost you are under the
[1:11:03] wrath of Almighty God I don't care who
[1:11:06] you are I don't care who you related to
[1:11:08] you are under the judgment of Almighty
[1:11:10] God it's got to be personal personal
[1:11:19] vindication or glory this is personal
[1:11:24] vindication
[1:11:25] when you go to cash the check you don't
[1:11:27] have a family family family driver's
[1:11:31] license you got a personal ID when you
[1:11:35] go to have that ID made they don't ask
[1:11:37] can you have them okay we want to run in
[1:11:39] your family today we want to take a
[1:11:41] family picture no sir but you are part
[1:11:45] of a family but you've got to have your
[1:11:46] own personal identification this is
[1:11:50] where it's not a group it's a personal
[1:11:53] vindication of a pregnant out of God
[1:11:56] filled with the Holy Ghost well you're
[1:12:00] so surrendered and his life is pulsating
[1:12:02] through you
[1:12:07] this is where it takes to use that sword
[1:12:16] but I'm not I've overcome smoking
[1:12:17] there's a lot more thank God for it but
[1:12:19] there's a lot more than smoking
[1:12:23] Booth's and I overcome adultery is a lot
[1:12:25] more than just adultery thank God for
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:27] there's a light mom that goes over come
[1:12:30] let us a nice be a pothead thank God
[1:12:33] that you've overcome but there's a lot
[1:12:35] more I'm not just talking about a life
[1:12:38] well I used to you know I used to do
[1:12:40] this I don't do that no more I'm asking
[1:12:42] you the question is Christ alive in you
[1:12:51] remove saying I'll just be a cook for
[1:12:53] them we don't need a cook for the army
[1:12:55] we need people with swords in their
[1:12:57] hands they men the Holy Ghost provides
[1:13:01] every meal we've got need of and brother
[1:13:05] there's a whole supply wagon full of
[1:13:07] them
[1:13:09] hallelujah
[1:13:10] I want you to think of this Mordecai
[1:13:13] Mordecai here's what Haman is going to
[1:13:17] do
[1:13:18] he begins to weep
[1:13:21] the hearing they hear him in the rest of
[1:13:23] the Jews you know what Esther does
[1:13:24] Esther sins out verse four she sent
[1:13:29] Mordecai a change of raiment to take
[1:13:33] away his sell off but he received it not
[1:13:41] hallelujah you see this is why it's not
[1:13:44] the church telling him what to do
[1:13:46] he's the one leading the church Mordecai
[1:13:50] was a messenger personally to Esther and
[1:13:54] Esther would have been one to say hey
[1:13:57] man yo this disturbance you're causing
[1:13:59] in the kingdom here take this change of
[1:14:02] raiment but Mordecai says I will not be
[1:14:07] falsely comforted cappucci comfort she
[1:14:11] Oh Sian I will not be falsely comforted
[1:14:15] there's only one thing that can comfort
[1:14:18] the believer and that is the comforter
[1:14:21] himself the garment of the Holy Ghost of
[1:14:24] his word taken hold terrible God what if
[1:14:30] Monica had not stood this way this would
[1:14:34] read much differently but Monica said
[1:14:37] now I'll not receive a church garment Oh
[1:14:45] glory
[1:14:48] so her Chamberlain comes back and he
[1:14:53] begins to tell Esther what's going on
[1:14:55] this decree that Haman has made out of
[1:14:59] envy out of bitterness out of hatred for
[1:15:01] Mordecai
[1:15:05] he has appointed that there would be a
[1:15:08] destruction and everyone who had raised
[1:15:10] their hand to destroy the Jews there
[1:15:13] would be silver coming to their coughing
[1:15:24] I would say something but some of you
[1:15:26] might take it the wrong way
[1:15:28] Haman was trying to put out a stimulus
[1:15:31] bill
[1:15:32] don't go line and don't go lining things
[1:15:34] up you understand what I mean what is it
[1:15:36] people can be bought off with money come
[1:15:40] on friends though nations and the
[1:15:42] kingdoms of this world have been bought
[1:15:44] off with her riches that's why when her
[1:15:49] destruction cometh in an hour
[1:15:51] the Bible says they will wail and lament
[1:15:55] and mourn why she hath made us rich
[1:16:00] oh my but notice what is mentioned to
[1:16:09] Esther declared to her in verse 8 and
[1:16:13] charged her
[1:16:14] I'll just declare it but charge her you
[1:16:17] see what this word does it Commission's
[1:16:20] it Commission's that she should go in
[1:16:24] unto the King to make supplication unto
[1:16:28] him to make requests before him for her
[1:16:31] people you know what this word is doing
[1:16:33] it's calling her out of her comfort zone
[1:16:37] Esther has got comfortable being the
[1:16:40] queen
[1:16:42] she'd been hearing message after message
[1:16:45] of hope praise God I'm the queen oh
[1:16:47] praise God I'm the queen but you have
[1:16:50] not been anointed Queen just to be clean
[1:16:53] you are here for a purpose so now it
[1:17:00] changes to declare and charge her gone
[1:17:07] are the days of just coming and just
[1:17:09] rejoicing around God sent a message oh
[1:17:12] my in this wonderful in this wonderful
[1:17:15] this is a time to move and to act upon
[1:17:19] the word personally I believe that I
[1:17:26] believe listen to me
[1:17:27] believers forward Tabernacle I believe
[1:17:29] with all my heart it's one of these
[1:17:31] things right now but even as this has
[1:17:33] come and we've had to separate for a
[1:17:35] while
[1:17:36] your victory should
[1:17:37] B died to weather whooping Sedna I've
[1:17:40] been able to come to church for a month
[1:17:41] but Jesus had left you you ought to be
[1:17:45] just as victorious cuz it's not like
[1:17:48] you're being kept out of church but you
[1:17:51] can be just as victorious in the
[1:17:53] presence of Almighty God if it's
[1:17:56] anything less you've got a church
[1:17:58] experience and you need a real baptism
[1:18:03] of the Holy Ghost what are you doing I'm
[1:18:08] charging you repent and be baptized in
[1:18:12] the name of Jesus Christ receive ye the
[1:18:15] Holy Ghost you see how personal
[1:18:20] vindication this is the Bible says for
[1:18:22] the rapture two will be in the same bed
[1:18:25] one will be taken the other will be left
[1:18:29] it brings it that close in the same
[1:18:32] house can be in the same bedroom put it
[1:18:36] in the same bed it's that close why
[1:18:41] because the Holy Ghost that's how real
[1:18:43] he is when he falls in a congregation he
[1:18:47] falls to deal with hearts so if he's
[1:18:50] dealing with your heart remember Jesus
[1:18:52] don't play games Jesus don't play games
[1:18:56] he comes to tap you on your shoulder
[1:18:58] he's letting you know he's letting you
[1:19:00] know he's talking to you you see the
[1:19:02] Holy Ghost
[1:19:03] he's not just something that comes out
[1:19:04] listen friends the Holy Ghost can fall
[1:19:06] in an assembly and people can look at
[1:19:08] anything
[1:19:09] wow wow that's wonderful did God be with
[1:19:11] in the yard no it was just wonderful
[1:19:13] my the music today mother this today you
[1:19:15] missed it it ought to bring genuine
[1:19:19] reflection in your life whoo
[1:19:22] I'm preaching I don't know anybody I
[1:19:24] want to come back to church now but I'm
[1:19:26] telling you it I'll bring genuine
[1:19:27] reflection in your life we do not come
[1:19:31] to the house of God just to feel good
[1:19:33] that is not what the outpouring of the
[1:19:36] Holy Ghost is about that you might feel
[1:19:39] good that is selfishness the Holy Ghost
[1:19:44] is to come to bring a reflection that
[1:19:47] our lives would be turned over to him
[1:19:49] just
[1:19:50] or take over more of Samuel take over
[1:19:53] more of my life that you might be
[1:19:56] reflected in my life I think of how I
[1:20:01] read just yesterday night when the
[1:20:04] Prophet said Lord as we have worshipped
[1:20:07] you in song
[1:20:08] he said now we come to worship you as
[1:20:12] the sword of the word will move through
[1:20:15] us and in us so here Esther she calls
[1:20:30] for a time of solidness fasting she
[1:20:35] tells Mordecai go gather the rest that
[1:20:37] had used together I want you to tell him
[1:20:39] to fast
[1:20:39] I want you to fast and me and my maids
[1:20:42] are going too fast too and on the third
[1:20:48] day we're gonna come we're gonna go in
[1:20:49] before him I'm gonna go in before him
[1:20:52] well glory be to God because you see he
[1:20:56] has told her listen to me now let me
[1:20:59] just back up just a moment here Mordecai
[1:21:02] listen to you just I want you to catch
[1:21:04] this here if I've got to stop somewhere
[1:21:06] in here that's fine I want you to catch
[1:21:09] this here
[1:21:11] this is how God deals with our lives she
[1:21:15] lets Mordechai know if I go in there and
[1:21:18] I've not been invited to come in we're
[1:21:22] talking about where the King sets on his
[1:21:24] royal throne if I go in there and I've
[1:21:29] not been summons to go in there he
[1:21:34] whoever goes in there is not summoned
[1:21:37] they die
[1:21:39] remember the sons of Aaron went in there
[1:21:43] with strange fire and they died is that
[1:21:48] right and God told Moses tell Aaron that
[1:21:52] he should not come at all times there's
[1:21:56] an appointed time and one time the veil
[1:22:00] was closed up but in Christ the veil has
[1:22:04] been rent in tow and the mercy seat is
[1:22:07] in plain view at one time it was death
[1:22:10] to go in but now it's death to stay out
[1:22:14] the message is telling her get into the
[1:22:18] hidden place get in there to the inner
[1:22:22] courts notice she's reasoning with her
[1:22:25] if I go in there he's not bidding me to
[1:22:27] come in there if I do that well what
[1:22:29] could happen to me
[1:22:34] Esther like many of us she still needs
[1:22:37] to be continually delivered of Esther
[1:22:45] so they told Mordecai looking at this
[1:22:48] dialogue it's going on so Mordecai this
[1:22:54] is what he tells her think not verse 13
[1:22:57] that you're going to escape in the
[1:22:59] king's house
[1:23:01] I don't care Esther if you're sitting in
[1:23:03] the king's house you're sitting under a
[1:23:05] king's message preach with me now
[1:23:07] I don't care where you're setting up if
[1:23:10] you don't act right now you're ain't
[1:23:14] gonna be saved you understand what I'm
[1:23:18] saying
[1:23:19] it isn't just will please God I've been
[1:23:22] born into this thing and I've been
[1:23:23] around this thing you know what I think
[1:23:25] the doctrines are right that ain't and
[1:23:27] that ain't it that ain't it they're
[1:23:30] taught to debate these doctrines in
[1:23:32] seminaries but there's one thing that
[1:23:35] the devil can't debate and that's the
[1:23:37] life that's the life he can't debate
[1:23:41] that and here's what it tells her if you
[1:23:46] hold your peace
[1:23:49] if you don't speak the word you got to
[1:23:54] speak the word come on Esther you're
[1:23:57] full citizenship speak the ladder you
[1:24:00] see what is this message doing his
[1:24:02] telling Esther speak Esther as the first
[1:24:08] image was smitten and Michelangelo sent
[1:24:12] speak so is the word come in this hour
[1:24:18] when a bride she is the identified
[1:24:22] masterpiece of cloth we have been struck
[1:24:25] by the Spirit of God and it tells you an
[1:24:28] hour speak Esther speak Esther speak
[1:24:32] Esther what is it the sword of the
[1:24:35] Spirit speakest her speak Esther there
[1:24:39] holds your peace
[1:24:44] but mother but Esther go like this
[1:24:48] Esther yeah what what's that well that's
[1:24:52] part of surrender okay and go like this
[1:24:57] well what is that you feel oh well
[1:25:00] that's that's that that's the royal
[1:25:02] crown he put on my hand
[1:25:05] that's your confidence he has set his
[1:25:09] love on you when looking at yourself
[1:25:14] whether you're worthy or not well if I
[1:25:16] can do this
[1:25:17] but if I can do that Esther you're
[1:25:19] looking at the wrong thing
[1:25:22] see wonder what she was dealing with his
[1:25:25] fears she was dealing with fears what
[1:25:28] was the message of Mordecai doing
[1:25:30] casting out fear
[1:25:32] but how letting her know who she was he
[1:25:36] was casting out fear about letting her
[1:25:38] know of her election for if thou
[1:25:46] altogether holdest thy peace at this
[1:25:50] time then shall there enlargement and
[1:25:55] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:25:59] another place oh you know what I love
[1:26:01] about this Mordecai is letting her know
[1:26:04] if you ain't going believe it God will
[1:26:06] raise up some stones to believe this if
[1:26:09] your ain't going to receive it I want
[1:26:11] you to slam this Esther I don't wanna
[1:26:12] hurt your feelings but if you ain't
[1:26:14] gonna rise up and stand in this time God
[1:26:18] will have somebody because God's made a
[1:26:20] promise of his word and God is not going
[1:26:22] to go back on his word God is going to
[1:26:25] fulfill his word he will fulfill it
[1:26:27] through believers
[1:26:30] what's he letting her know it's not
[1:26:32] about you it's God proving his word it's
[1:26:38] God fulfilling his word he just wants to
[1:26:44] borrow you you don't do it somebody else
[1:26:52] is I mean you say it to you if you don't
[1:26:56] take promises somebody else's if you
[1:26:59] don't take your place somebody else will
[1:27:02] take it but saying I thought nobody
[1:27:05] could take my place if your place is
[1:27:08] ordained in Jesus Christ I say in the
[1:27:10] name of Jesus Christ rise and take your
[1:27:14] inheritance
[1:27:15] [Applause]
[1:27:17] Alleluia and amen brother Sandra it's
[1:27:23] you and Jesus
[1:27:24] it's your inheritance Joshua is to
[1:27:29] divide the land the inheritance in the
[1:27:31] land you arise that's what this message
[1:27:36] come to do this message never come to
[1:27:39] make a social event a social club oh we
[1:27:43] have such a lovely church we have such a
[1:27:45] lovely that's not what this message can
[1:27:47] to do that is seeds of organizational
[1:27:51] ISM this message comes to brain a real
[1:27:54] genuine birth of the Holy Ghost it
[1:28:04] charges you take your position I don't
[1:28:10] know if it's for me the Bible says it is
[1:28:13] for all and as many as are far off as
[1:28:17] many as the Lord our God shall call my
[1:28:24] family brother Samuel don't hold your
[1:28:27] peace Esther my children don't hold your
[1:28:31] peace Esther my loved ones don't hold
[1:28:36] your peace
[1:28:45] speak the word remember your commission
[1:28:58] who know who knows whether thou art come
[1:29:02] to the kingdom for such a time as this
[1:29:11] so here's where Esther comes
[1:29:18] said you are fast I'm gonna be fasting
[1:29:23] on the third day I'm going in
[1:29:32] let me read this scripture and I'm more
[1:29:34] close here verse 16 go gather together
[1:29:42] all the Jews that are present in Shushan
[1:29:49] and fast II for me and neither eat nor
[1:29:55] drink three days nor night
[1:29:59] you see there's a cloud of many
[1:30:02] witnesses there's a gathering that's
[1:30:09] going on the rest of the shushing the
[1:30:14] rest in Shushan don't know what's going
[1:30:16] on this message does not have an effect
[1:30:19] upon the rest of Shushan but it's having
[1:30:23] an effect upon the Jews God for the bill
[1:30:28] is from the land of their nativity
[1:30:30] though they were their internship they
[1:30:33] were Jews they were citizens from
[1:30:38] another Kingdom glory be to God gather
[1:30:44] yourselves together and fast and pray
[1:30:49] for me
[1:30:54] no wonder Paul would open up every one
[1:30:57] of the letters Thessalonians Ephesians
[1:30:59] Philippians Colossians what would Paul
[1:31:02] open with within the first chapter and
[1:31:04] many of those prayer that you might be
[1:31:08] filled with all understanding and
[1:31:13] strengthened with his might it was an
[1:31:16] intercessory prayer according to the
[1:31:19] will of God
[1:31:22] I also in Don maidens will fast likewise
[1:31:28] and so will I go in unto the king which
[1:31:33] is not according to the law you see what
[1:31:36] she's doing
[1:31:37] grace is lifting her
[1:31:40] above the law she's now walking in
[1:31:44] disobedience she's going to come in
[1:31:46] humility but what has happened grace
[1:31:49] what's been minister to her grace grace
[1:31:52] grace shoutings of grace
[1:31:57] I wonder how many days brother Richard
[1:31:59] was she had to go
[1:32:03] but the Gomez I wonder how many times
[1:32:06] when she got down and prayed that she
[1:32:08] was praying she was she could feel that
[1:32:13] crowning of his love you see you and me
[1:32:18] we don't have a natural clown on our
[1:32:21] head but he has crowned our soul he has
[1:32:25] sealed us with the Spirit of God and how
[1:32:28] do we come we present our token when we
[1:32:33] come into his presence we present the
[1:32:35] token it's not a worthy nespresso
[1:32:39] because of my worthiness
[1:32:42] it's the token for the son what are you
[1:32:50] saying I'm saying damned and day out how
[1:32:53] do you stand and speak the word because
[1:32:56] you have the crowning seal upon your
[1:33:00] life he has set his love upon you you
[1:33:06] have been sealed unto the day of
[1:33:09] redemption nothing can break that seal
[1:33:14] Satan can come in please at it the
[1:33:17] Prophet said he can punch at it he said
[1:33:20] but you know you've passed from death
[1:33:23] unto life the things you once loved you
[1:33:27] love no more he said in this word is
[1:33:31] everything to you
[1:33:32] Jesus Christ is everything to you or a
[1:33:37] bit of God what is that the token life
[1:33:42] you see the outworking of this token
[1:33:44] life in Esther it's drawing Esther to
[1:33:47] think beyond herself say how close this
[1:33:51] is the thinking of herself it wasn't
[1:33:53] like she was thinking of well you know
[1:33:54] I'm better than somebody on this on that
[1:33:56] you know that can come along but it
[1:33:57] wasn't that her she was pulling her
[1:34:00] beyond the thoughts the thoughts of her
[1:34:03] humanity she could see her humanity she
[1:34:07] was held in this humanity but the word
[1:34:10] was causing her
[1:34:12] look beyond their first birth to the
[1:34:14] supernatural birth girl repeater God in
[1:34:19] the highest
[1:34:21] that's the rapture right there that's
[1:34:24] what takes the rapture she been lifted
[1:34:31] in Greece and this is her statement and
[1:34:40] if I perish I perish what is it she came
[1:34:48] to an end of Esther she came to an end
[1:34:53] of Esther where did the lamb prevail in
[1:35:00] Gethsemane he prevailed and he took the
[1:35:06] book is that right here is Esther
[1:35:11] what's happening her faith is increasing
[1:35:14] her faith is growing well huh
[1:35:18] brittleness how's it grown growing she's
[1:35:21] being reminded it's me
[1:35:26] see she continued once where's her shots
[1:35:29] or would it be to God her shots is in
[1:35:33] his sovereign action upon her life and
[1:35:39] here she stands if I perish I perish if
[1:35:48] we could see Esther now oh she's
[1:35:52] beautiful as the morning clear as the
[1:35:58] Sun witness of the fullness of the moon
[1:36:04] but terrible as an army with banners
[1:36:10] she's under the standard of the full
[1:36:13] Word of God
[1:36:16] I say this morning no matter where
[1:36:18] you're at and who you are let that be
[1:36:22] the desire and take the charge of the
[1:36:27] Spirit of God upon your life if I perish
[1:36:32] I perish
[1:36:38] what do you mean give it all give it all
[1:36:48] don't hold your peace but take your
[1:36:53] position take what rightfully belongs to
[1:36:57] you
[1:36:57] take the sword out of the sheath if it's
[1:37:03] not been given if you're looking for it
[1:37:05] you still have a right to stand upon
[1:37:09] that promise and take this charge and
[1:37:11] encouragement of the Spirit of God and
[1:37:13] say Lord I want that portion that
[1:37:16] belongs to me you have an authority by
[1:37:20] the Word of God it has charged you and I
[1:37:24] for our position it calls us beyond it
[1:37:28] calls us beyond being a part of a group
[1:37:33] it calls us from being associated with
[1:37:36] the message into being United with
[1:37:39] Christ who is the message
[1:37:46] what mercy let's pray Lord Jesus right
[1:37:55] here this morning Lord o God with these
[1:38:01] words that you've spoke to our hearts
[1:38:05] just beginning Lord to look at these
[1:38:09] things Lord and more and more Lord just
[1:38:14] seen how that our lives Lord it must be
[1:38:19] rooted and grounded in love Norden it's
[1:38:26] clear Paul would give us such direction
[1:38:32] having faith to move mountains it's not
[1:38:35] enough an individual person could have
[1:38:40] all great faith
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:43] but it isn't Lord something of great
[1:38:47] faith
[1:38:51] as a matter of fact when you wrote of
[1:38:53] faith and one way you would you would
[1:38:57] speak and you would minister to that of
[1:39:00] the disciples and say oh ye of little
[1:39:02] faith but then you would Lord as you
[1:39:04] come right around and you'd let us know
[1:39:07] but that which moves mountains
[1:39:10] it begins with mustard seed faith faith
[1:39:16] that is the smallest of all faith that's
[1:39:21] what you said mustard seed it's the
[1:39:23] smallest of all herbs but it grows it
[1:39:29] will not mix with any other thing it
[1:39:33] won't highbreed it stays true Lord Jesus
[1:39:39] I pray this money right here Lord among
[1:39:43] the Assembly all of us together Lord
[1:39:46] connected Lord even by way of the
[1:39:48] Internet I pray Lord Jesus if there's
[1:39:51] one Lord that has not really experienced
[1:39:54] that of the love of God in their soul
[1:40:00] that Lord would lift them above all the
[1:40:03] things of the world maybe they've
[1:40:07] experienced a drawing a pool of the love
[1:40:11] of God may they continue to submit and
[1:40:14] surrender to you because Lord it must be
[1:40:19] the responding to your love or a
[1:40:25] yielding to you I ask Lord God that you
[1:40:28] would just continue to deal with that
[1:40:31] heart and that individual bring them
[1:40:34] Lord into that place to where like
[1:40:36] Esther was there willing to completely
[1:40:39] lay down their life
[1:40:45] or Jesus I pray this morning as we're
[1:40:51] gathered together here like Esther we
[1:40:58] are reminded of our humanity every day
[1:41:02] every moment the Lord
[1:41:09] your word it comes to lift us where our
[1:41:16] focus our dwelling our thoughts are not
[1:41:20] entertaining this humanity but where the
[1:41:24] word brings a discernment between our
[1:41:28] humanity and in between the real
[1:41:32] divinity of God on the inside
[1:41:36] Nord Jesus I pray this morning that you
[1:41:39] would help us help each and everyone
[1:41:41] that's listening or will listen to this
[1:41:43] Lord your dawn if they've got
[1:41:46] discouraged in their life for their walk
[1:41:49] if there's things that they're standing
[1:41:51] steal upon right now may I pray God by
[1:41:56] the Spirit of God
[1:41:57] may they Lord God receive a renewing by
[1:42:00] the Spirit of God Lord God where you
[1:42:03] will direct as it were their hands
[1:42:07] spiritually but they might be able with
[1:42:11] go God to move back into the place of
[1:42:14] the sacred sands of God's grace well
[1:42:18] Lord Jesus they met you face to face
[1:42:20] Lord
[1:42:23] to where they know within their hearts
[1:42:25] and their lives
[1:42:28] I have been changed maybe Lord God of
[1:42:33] taking a hold upon the love of God
[1:42:36] that's taken a hold upon their life may
[1:42:38] there be a renewing maybe they got a
[1:42:40] little cold Lord they drifted away from
[1:42:43] the fire of your love
[1:42:45] they've letting that love grown a little
[1:42:47] cold Lord like a husband and a wife can
[1:42:51] let that love grow cold
[1:42:52] [Music]
[1:42:54] embers sometimes embers are white-hot
