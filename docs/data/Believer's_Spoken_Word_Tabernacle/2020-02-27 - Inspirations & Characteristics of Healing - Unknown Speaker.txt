comfort them and give him strength I was able to listen to the message that brother Brandon spoke and I just so appreciated that to me he spoke my heart and a lot of the same those are year at the funeral we we went through some of the same points but in in some direction but you we understand that there's a little bit more of a Liberty even among believers to speak things that we can see within the scripture but what a comfort that God has given us through the word I I just I'm so thankful to the Lord and how God is so mindful of it to me when I looked at that and think of how that God would direct brother Brandon my what love and care amen I take you want to see the love and care of God God's love and care to direct and then that our so we just appreciate that with all their hearts and just when it reminds you of the memorial service there with brother for brother John LaFontaine tomorrow we've sent out the announcement back when it came out I think back at the end of January and then also sent it out I had it sent out again the first part of this week it starts at 4:00 p.m. there's details on the email and if you don't happen to have that and you want it to go just check with sister Roseanne she would no doubt be able to look that up for you and and have those details there where it's at and things and so we just want to just want to thank the Lord amen for for for the life of brother Johnny Fontane and so there's just so much that that could be said with that of brother John and we're just looking forward to that tomorrow we want to turn our attention into the word of the Lord this is this evening and just just want to go back into the word here and we've been dealing with healing and there's been a part of this that I've just been there's so many different well I don't want to say angles but yet there are and there are also so many different parts to it and the prayer that that I would have here is that God will just not only would speak so personally to our hearts to give us direction within his word and if there's anything that's out of place or out of line if there's any thinking that's not right well we want to be lined up with the word we certainly we are a people that are of the truth of God's Word and we we are to call to walk in liberty in this hour and we know what it means when the word comes and it brings liberty and even to where probably throughout this building we could testify of certain things beliefs that we have held and yet the word will come by the Spirit of God and we realize wait a minute that was my belief that wasn't the word and God just opens up a part on it you think wow man this is this is Liberty I'm grateful that God that the Spirit of God the promise where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty and we just thank God for that one thing I I like you know has it was placed I heard it place years ago one time it said if if there is something you have and you place it right besides you if God allows you to keep it then go on with it but if God takes it from you let him take it from you and that's what we won we know that God is in control so we want to just take the reading from the word here and there's so much within this scripture reading and I just encourage you don't let it become just a part of what we're reading on Thursday nights but there's so much that's within here and it speaks to our journey in Exodus 15 and verse 22 and and the scripture begins in this manner says so Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea and they went out into the wilderness of Shur and they went three days in the wilderness and found the water and when they came to Marah they could not drink of the waters of Marah for they were bitter therefore the name of it was called Marah and the people murmured against Moses saying what shall we drink and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which when he had cast it into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes and I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians how many say Lord I just want a willing heart that's the greatest defense against every disease is a willing heart amen for I am the Lord that healeth II let's just ask his blessing on the word Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for your mercy and grace tonight thank you Lord that you have made a way for us and thank you Lord that you have bidden us to come Lord there are no doubt needs that are gathered here tonight questions on hearts Lord and lives Lord that we're in need of direction Lord we ask that you would come and you would take your word Lord and by the leadership of the Holy Spirit through the word guide us and direct us Lord we just pray that you'll anoint a speaker and hear together and in all things receive glory Lord unto yourself we pray we ask it all in the name of Jesus Christ amen and then they god bless you as you're being seated I want to speak to you tonight and take a little a little part here on on on a thought of inspiration and characteristics of healing when we look at Moses here of what had taken place Moses was moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord in the in the present bitter situation he Moses did not know what to do he indeed was the prophet of God for that hour but here is where being the prophet of God for that hour and let me just say to you and I as believers in this hour is to be a vessel that is available to God is to always looking to him knowing that God is the answer for every situation is to know that there is nothing that that transpires or comes about that catches God unaware but God indeed he is the answer not just has it he is the answer and to think of how that when Moses would approach this if we can look at it in this way and the Lord would help us it would be very much like you and I in situations when we come and we face a situation we do not know how the situation is going to unfold but when we can look to the Lord and just when looking to the Lord it comes down to a simple word and that's the word trust it's to trust him in simple childlike faith you know the scriptures will tell us suffer not the little child the little children to come unto me Jesus would take another part in the scripture in Matthew 18 and said and said except you be converted and humble yourself as a little child you shall a know us in SC or enter into the kingdom of heaven we recognize that yet what a contrast we are to mature and and the maturity of a believer does never bring us to a place of of independence but a real maturing of a believer it brings us to a greater dependence we recognize our him more and more we recognize our enemy that we pack around with us and we distrust his thoughts we distrust those voices of and we're able by the help of the Lord to discern that voice and say wait a minute this did not come from the Lord because the Spirit of the Lord brings peace it gives direction it does not bring anxiety and tension but it brings peace and rest so we're able by the Spirit of God to discern the situations that come up and Moses being just like any of us when the situation were happened these waters were unbearable they could not drink from these waters if I can say it like this it was a situation that do you would realize they needed nourishment you know the body can go a long time without food but you cannot go without water you need water we can go a long time you know without that but we need water and this was an unbearable situation water being even that of a of a source of life and refreshment and to think of how it being unbearable and when a situation would become unbearable to look to the Lord and the mercy of the Lord moves down and takes a situation that looks so unbearable and God shows Moses there is a tree and to take this tree and cast that tree into the waters now I know we've looked at this a lot but I want you to catch Moses I don't believe in any way it was just something just casually it was just done but I believe the Spirit of God when he showed Moses a tree and everybody else could have been looking at that tree and they were not under the same channel of inspiration that Moses was under Moses came under the inspiration of God for that moment and for that moment he was directed by the Spirit of God for a people in an unbearable situation take this tree and into the waters and there the waters became sweet he was moved by divine inspiration we are made as people to be moved as believers to be moved upon by the Holy Ghost you see the Scriptures will will speak to us and it monitors us how God will give God alone will give inspiration we can receive a lot of things and somebody tells us this and somebody tells us this and somebody tells us this now listen it isn't that God cannot speak through other channels but there's one thing about it when God speaks there is peace that accompanies his word that's something you can take to the bank peace accompanies the will of God amen and we are thankful for God's grace within that hour you see the Bible would say to us in this manner in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 it would say continued Paul speaking to Timothy continued now in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learned them and that from a child thou Husson thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus all Scripture is given by inspiration of God how dare men take out portions of the word and say it's not inspired if they would just be truthful they would have to stand there and say I don't believe he does the same things it would be more tolerable for them to say that then it would be to say well this part of the words no longer inspired him it give behooves us to remember it is not us that made God but God made us it is not us that directs caught but it is God that directs us and God has given every bit of Scripture it is that of an is inspired by God and it's profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the manner God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works in the Bible that goes on to say in 2nd Peter chapter 1 verse 19 and Peter speaking of the fulfillment of the promise of the Lord Jesus we also have a more sure word of prophecy where until you do well that you take heed as unto a light that shine is in a dark place unto the day star and the day unto the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation that means it's not isolated if God did it once God will do it again hallelujah if he did it one time he'll do it again why cuz he is the same yesterday today and forever in Malachi 3 I am God and I changed not he is the same Amen so it's not of what he did back there in the Old Testament was only a type and a shadow of what he would do in the New Testament it is only a continual unfolding of the same God his characteristics his character never changes his attitude has never changed his attitude toward sin is the same tonight as it was before and his attitude toward deliverance is the same tonight as it was before his attitude toward healing is the same tonight as it was before for the prophecy I love this for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy men that word holy it was not that the men themselves were any better than anybody else that word holy means they were separated and set apart unto the Lord they were available and I believe that's the greatest compliment that we can have is that we would be available if God would choose to use us or how God would inspire us we want to be available and notice but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost so it was not remember these men were speaking things that would be against all science when Isaiah would speak behold a virgin shall conceive there was nothing on record and there was no possible way for that to take place scientifically but what it was is Isaiah being yielded to the Spirit of God he was lifted up out of his senses because if he would have remained in his senses in that or allowed his senses to affect him he'd have reasoned it right out but God in His mercy lifted Isaiah up and Isaiah would speak under the inspiration of the Spirit of God the same Spirit of God that would come and move upon Mary and speak to her that indeed that your womb I'm going to borrow your womb and that which would be conceived in you which you asked how can it be it will be conceived in you by the Holy Ghost it will be a work it will be my work the same Spirit of God that spoke there through Isaiah he announced the way that he would come and God the way the Spirit of Truth it will come it will always come through the channel of his word God can do anything he wants to do but if he'll just stay in the word he's got enough in the word and I'm content with that he'll never go outside of his word it didn't come by the will of man it wasn't men make that statement with Isaiah because it was not as a ax it was not these men who were wanting to I want to say something astounding I want to say something that's gonna all the people as a matter of fact much of their ministry would be upsetting to the people aside from revelations that would be given for the millennium future hold gathering of Israel and yet all through all that there was rebuking of sin that was present it was not something that those men would have chose and legislate to you like this there's a lot of things and pathways and directions and leadings that you and I would never choose we would not choose it in terms of even thinking it to be glorious but yet God receives glory through every situation through every leading through every sickness he receives glory and amid just go on and say in every death he receives glory here is Joe you're in the book of Job here is le hui' or Elihu however you want to pronounce it sometimes you know I've listened to brother Branham and I can't even hardly I can't order to say you your uring to him I say your I'm someone it's just easy for me to say it that way so we just say it that way you know but notice here is you know I who or le who however you want to say it it was that where he remember after all the men had spoke Bildad and he life has all the rest of those guys that were supposed to be comforters and they came accusing Joel all this stuff has happened to you cuz you're a secret sinner if you were more fervent believer this kind of stuff wouldn't be happening let me just tell you something those men right there you know what do you know the reason that they could see those things cuz that was the depth of their revelation they did not that was where their depth stopped right there they did not have and recognize the same depth of God's redemptive grace they didn't have that but it took in this in the time for a lihue to come in that measure and notice what is said in verse 6 he says and edited the son of brocco but boos not answered and said I am young and ye are very old wherefore I was afraid and does not show you my opinion I said days should speak and multitude of years should teach wisdom notice the humility hella who did not come in and say why don't you rest y'all just shut up and let me have my turn no humility let it speak God let God let the ages speak out and then he comes he's working in every age but God knows what he's doing you see he hadn't lost control he knows why didn't he send Elly who at first God knows what he's doing hallelujah just like in our lives and many times the beginning of a situation in our lives old Bildad shows up holy laughs ass shows up come on somebody it knocks on your door and wants to save this and say that and say that but thanks be to God there is a visitation from Ella though that can come to our hearts and let us know the real wisdom of God in every situation job was waiting on this I liked when Ella who came he said I am clay as thou our clay I am your request in the stead of God what was he representative it was representative of Jesus Christ look at the scripture but there is a spirit and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding did you catch that the almighty giveth them inspiration or the inspiration and Almighty giveth them understanding we don't have to work for it we don't have to say oh god I'm just gonna do this and I'm gonna work myself in it you remember you can't work yourself into faith faith is sovereignly given and faith will always find the source it'll always find the perfect will of God there can be a lot of hindrances but when faith finds the source and the perfect will of God faith don't know no hindrance it's something that you or me in our mind can't explain but it's something that's moving us deeper than our mind look at this great men are not always wise neither do the age you'd understand judgment therefore said I hearken to me I also will show non opinion so we we need and I believe this with all my heart that in every situation I believe that we need inspiration from God I believe that I believe we need inspiration when we're coming and we're dealing with our families I believe we need inspiration with the church I believe we need inspiration when it comes to taking direction in our lives whether it be on the job I believe we need inspiration when it comes to approaching healing and I believe there's only one source where inspiration will come and that's through the Word of God that's through the Word of God many times where we make our defeat is when we start looking to other resources but we need to look to the Lord it first starts out with committing committing our lives and the situation into the hands of God and if a person if you've not I just saved this for anybody's here or we'll hear it if you've not turned your life over to God if you've not turned your heart over to God how can you have faith to stand for healing all of this extra work T works together within the continuity of God's Word and I believe that every situation if we can just be sensitive as believers that the inspiration of the Almighty the breath of God this word inspiration that I just read here out of job 32 six that is the same word that in the beginning the Lord God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life it is God who breathes an inspiration it comes upon the Word of God it is inspiration that comes to guide and direct us in approaching the promises of God we must have the inspiration of the Holy Ghost amen the breath of God will give us understanding faith and peace to direct the issue I love the scripture in Psalm 68 62 verse 8 trust in him at all times look what it says ye people pour out your heart before him that word before means in his presence God is a refuge for us now this is where God he comes God will come in a service God will come maybe when you're reading in the scriptures and it God will come while you're listening to a message maybe it will be while you're listening to a song or there's something that has struck your heart from what you heard and you're just kind of ruminating on it you're thinking on it you're praying about it and about that time when you're getting ready on your job to drive the nail in or whatever it is inspiration strikes within that and you know as well as I do there is an accompaniment of the presence of God with the inspiration of God it is real it's tangible we looked at naman here the last time I spoke on a Thursday night with healing and remember naman came to Elijah by way of the little Israelite girl who was there serving as a servant in his household when naman heard about it naman was coming to approach and he thought that this is what will take place the man of God will come forth he'll put his hand upon the area in my life and that'll be it and yet when he came the man of God didn't even come out and greet him the man of God sent the messenger DeHaven said go tell him to dip seven times in the Jordan well that alone was already seemingly insulting but you see what naman had thought was going to take place remember he was Roth he was upset and as we were looking at that if it had been up to you and I probably any doctor's office they too kicked us out then it just said you know what you're not gonna take the the plan adios well you know and we're no longer gonna doctor you is that right now so when we see this here it was Mehmed he was wanting it to happen a certain way but you see God we and I cannot it's not by the will of man to determine the pathway that healing is going to come it is in the hands of God to inspire us or what pathway that he is going to lead us for healing for one thing is for certain I am the Lord that heals all that diseases he's never ever lost a case the very center the center of God's will the very center of the King James Bible is Psalms 103 the very center of the Bible Psalms 103 I bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me who forgiveth thee of all thine iniquities who healeth II of all that diseases it is the center of his will he is the same yesterday today and forever we want to know what his will is his will has declared that it is the center of his will how perfect is the will of God how's they'e 59:19 of scripture we're familiar with when the enemy shall come in like a water drop like a trickle like a little stream like a like a cool refreshing River no like a flood notice how it's described it like a flood it's encroaching and moving over its boundaries it's coming and encroaching and God sees the encroachment and that flood cannot come unless God permit it and just as God would give there the Sun and remember now the moon the moon is to stand guard in the absence of the Sun it is the moon that would control the tides to tell the TAT you've gone far enough it is the moon that would release it and say move up it is that working of the reflection of that light in the phases of the Moon or as the scripture says the ordinances of that moon so when we look at this when the enemy shall come in like a flood the Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against him the Spirit of the Lord takes it personally when the enemy wants to encroach upon the banks of your life he might catch your spirit he might touch your body but remember when that soul has been sealed he cannot touch that soul he can try to encroach but remember remember has the prophet told us when Satan takes after one of God's children he's got God on his hands he's got the Living God on his hands hallelujah here when he he touches you who is the apple of his eye he's watching over our lives and the Spirit of God raises a standard he makes his word more sure I wanted look at this here just for a moment these are some things that just some years ago just in fellas shipping and just was some with brethren and we were just just to me it was things that just rejoiced my heart and I want to just bring it in this in this light we find in Revelation chapter 4 how that the scripture would go on to say in verse 1 after these this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me and said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and they just said to it let me just say it like this in this manner you see John was available are you with me he was available where was John act he was not on a lazy boy he was not sitting in a living room he was not he was on the Isle of Patmos maybe he has just lifted his foot from a scorpion maybe he had just moved from that of a poison a poison serpent he was in a condition that was a bitter condition but in that place he was going to receive a revelation of Jesus Christ of his coming in the church and the folds of his coming clear down to the coming of the Gentile to grap sure and to the Jews and then returning again in Armageddon and there to the Millenium into the future all he wouldn't receive that and it would give John strength he was available for the word to speak to him let me just say to you like this Willets be honest you and I there's times we haven't been available but God's grace has come maybe through a song service or something's taking place because we were lacking Elijah we were not ready for the Spirit of God to move on us come on don't get feeling down look at God's grace for our life you see when God when God is going to do something there ain't nothing gonna stop him you can't stop God's will are you with me think of it where the Prophet would tell people laying there he said if you don't get up off that cot you're going to die what was that why would he make that statement it was to let them know it is not your time you have not come to the boundary of your time and that spurred spoken in due season it would inspire them to let him know reach up and take a hold of the promise of God's Word God's will cannot be defeated he don't alter his will his will is perfect John was available and because he was available he heard the response come up hither and as he listened look at this as he listened immediately I was in the spirit as he was just listening to the word well what what message should I listen to just put him one on and immediately I began to speak to me and immediately I was in the spirit glory glory glory and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne you see when you're really getting the spirit you don't see three gods you don't see three persons when you get in the spirit the Spirit of Truth who is the word you don't see multiple you see one and he that said was to look upon like Jasper and a-star sardine stone and there was a rainbow around about the throne in sight like unto an emerald you know what John was looking at John is looking at the same thing when you and I can look and see him revealed in the word he is the author and the finisher of our faith and around about the throne were four and 20 seats and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting clothed in white raiment and they had on their heads crowns of gold and out of the throne proceeded lightnings thunderings and voices I remember as brother Ram would tell us that's lives of holiness being lived here and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God same spirit because God is one is that right but it's God unfolding himself remember like that of the rainbow it's every one the characteristic you cannot tell me and say well I love I love rainbows you do yeah like I like red well red is not the only color of the rainbow neither is the attribute of grace the only the only attribute of God he's also a deliberate he's also a judge come on somebody every one of these are attributes of the same God aren't you glad that judgment broke upon the situation in our life to lift the curse that was on our life and remove it from us and put it back on the devil and bring deliverance and change us aren't you grateful for the attributes of God grace provided that and not all that was unfolded all of these things Oh glory be to God well we're trying to get somewhere verse 6 and before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal notice this was not flaming fire shooting out of this one this is the representation of the Church of the Living God where the clarity of the Holy Ghost is reflected perfectly through her life it's a perfect reflection bone of his bone flesh of his flesh you know and in the midst of the throne and around about the throne were four beasts full of eyes before him behind remember this is symbolic I'm going to touch on this now and whenever they were full of eyes before me and behind amen and the first beast was like a lion the second beast was like a calf and the third beast had a face of a man and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle and the four beasts look at this and the four beasts had each of them six wings about him and they were full of eyes within and they rest not day and night saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come and when those beasts give glory and honor and thanks to him that sat on the throne who liveth for ever and ever the four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne and they worship Him that livin liveth for ever and ever and cast their crowns crowns before the throne saying thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created notice when these poor and living creatures as it said in verse 9 when they begin to give glory and thanks it has an effect that is also felt clear into the heavens to where it radiates out and it brings glory and honor not to three separate people it brings glory and honor for thou art worthy when this inspiration strikes the life it brings glory and honor to the Lamb of God now brother Branham would pick this up in the revelation series and he would take this of your notice we will refer a little bit tonight possibly to Ezekiel very briefly tonight but you'll notice it's foreign living creatures and notice within it they are guards of the ark or of the mercy seat do you not have been a Benjamin do you have that one slide give me the slide that is that is there why read this to John Saul four of them he saw four living creatures now watch he said now they both seen the same vision he's talking about Ezekiel and he's talking about John he said now for remember four is an Earthling number four means it is an earthly number it means deliverance are you with me now you see when we look at deliverance there were three Hebrew children that went into the fiery furnace but when the fourth one coming he brought deliverance are you with me now Lazarus was in the grave three days but when he came the first one it brought deliverance inspiration came the Hebrew children not by the will of man the Hebrew children went in there not knowing we don't know if God's gonna deliver us I don't know how God's gonna heal me I don't know what pathway he's gonna take he might just take me on home and heal me on the other side either way I'm gonna be healed but there's one thing for sure I'm renouncing the gospel of Jesus Christ I ain't bowing down to no devil what God has said is true let every man's work be a lie and let God's Word be the truth they stood on that word and what happened here came the fourth man here came earthly deliverance probita God for he said he's God's a number of deliverance so it shows that these beings must have been something about the earth and remember for people who are new I've got some that are young even much younger in the faith and it's money and listen to me very closely as your pastor this is symbols the book of Revelation is symbols it takes one sent from God it's not the mind of the man interpreting it's the Spirit of God through the channel and office that he has chosen in his season of time it takes a prophet to reveal the symbols in the days of Daniel and the writing was on the wall all the wise men came and could not interpret that writing but remember that was one who said I remember in the days of the Pentecostal fathers I remember there is one who could interpret the writing and they call for him and here comes Daniel and Daniel interprets what is there not Daniel's mind Daniel was a prophet of God a vessel set aside that the inspiration of the old Mahdi could move down and interpret judgment is at hand the book of Revelation is a book of symbols for beasts it says they have four faces now let me just read a little bit out of the Book of Ezekiel there's much scripture we can go into here in the Book of Ezekiel hallelujah now look at this what knows some of the characteristics in ezekiel chapter 1 verse 12 then could you go to that for me please I know I've got you back there multitask and you're doing a wonderful job and they everyone went straight forward notice the characteristic here when they moved they went straight forward whether the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went now put that slide back up here now buddy you can talk to when we get home but I'll be in bed before you talk to me well I'm not going to him and it had special because you'll probably have it up here in a moment you just through keynote just just all right can you all see that okay enough when you look at this this is where this is a descriptive not as long as she wants you to see it's all symbol it's the same Holy Ghost but it's the characteristic he takes it's the characteristic in the situation it's the need for the hour so when it is that they were coming in a certain direction and obviously handed up there before they queue you and maybe have it in your mind if I'm standing right here and we're looking at that one right there that that second one over there we're standing over here you don't see all four faces when you're standing here all that you would see coming at you is the man anointing you see where you're standing the position that you're in if you're over here if I was over here facing this way what on what I would see is that uh on the other side would be the Ox you can see the horns all I would see is the Ox anointing coming at me what's in the center that is the Ark of the Covenant which what does that speak of its that is of wood wood speaks of humanity it is covered with deity when you look at that particular art it's got a crown on the top of it but remember they had to put blood on that crown and when the Holy Ghost has come into your heart and wrote upon the tablets of your heart it has taken that blood and applied it to your life and we are encompassed about with Christ if you're standing on this side all you see coming at you is the eagle anointing you see it's the position you're in for your day the position you're in but there it puts you in a place to receive the inspiration for the hour you see where your sandy it puts your brother Joey ready to receive the inspiration for the hour so when we look at this keep it up there out and keep it up there bin when we look at this here the Bible would say in Ezekiel 119 that when the living creatures wilt the Wills went by them we remember what were the wheels those that touch the earth will speak of what movement the Spirit of God moving right the Word of God moving there is a destination when they came out of Egypt it was to bring him out and bring him into the land of promise so notice now and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up whether soever verse 20 the spirit was to go they went thither was their spirit to go notice whether so ever these spirit was to go their spirit was to go you recognize that it is our faith God comes to inspire our faith our faith comes in there under the inspiration of his leadership and that's why brother Graham said if God he said if God can get my faith and get your faith lined up he said then God's faith will come down and step behind our faith together and back up the promise what grace to even get our faith in order I couldn't get my faith in order but we can if we look to him and say Lord if there's anything out of line we Lord if I said something wrong if I got a grudge somewhere the Lord I love that person really God gives us grace to do what get ourselves in line so the inspiration to come what is that that is his love and mercy somebody with me tonight her glory and the wheels were lifted up over against him for the spirit of the living creatures was in the Wills Wendy when those went these win so you're not just gonna go and you know hear this one going you know here coming to eagle and ninth-inning well the restroom and just gonna you know they're just going to sit there no it all moves together every direction God gives us in his word it might come contrary than the way were wanting it it may not come the way we're thinking about it but one thing about it if we're standing upon his word remember all of heaven is backing up and colorimeter God you might be like the little policeman that couldn't stop a runaway Pony but you have Authority you got the badge of believer but tokens showing I wish I could run but I got a preach and when these were to lift it up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against her for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheel now in the scripture here and I'm just gonna skip over this in the scripture jumping on down to verse 26 27 and 28 it speaks of the firmament above that of the four living creatures they looked and saw a man one who sat on the throne they saw one who was who with blow from the loins downward and the loins upward what is that speaking of it's speaking of the church that is clothed in the resurrection power of Jesus Christ amen they have come under the blood of Jesus Christ under the word for their day it is Christ being reflected in your life and in the life of Christ there were times it was the lion in the life of Christ there are times it was the ox and I'm not the same Holy Ghost remember what Jesus said John 5:19 it brings us back to this place it shows the maturity of the hour the Sun can do nothing but what he see the father doing that do it the son likewise brother Branham would quickly keep continue to point out to us over and over and over and over he said the prophets didn't do what they wanted to do he said Jesus didn't heal he said he was led by the spirit to do what the father showed him and that inspiration can't think about the people who were laying there the man who was impotent for 38 years if you and I have a condition for I don't know how many years it doesn't matter what it is but it's nothing too great for the Lord you know when I read that situation you know and it tells me it tells me there's nothing that's too insignificant for the Lord it tells me brother joy that God don't st. now you can live with it go ahead and live with it that ain't how God looks at it this man in order if 38 years brother Graham said he had a condition that wasn't gonna kill him but here God came down and he let his son write in the book of John as an eagle are you with me now in the book of Mark I think maybe I in the book of Mark here we have that you know the wisdom of man and seeing these things come about now this is where I want to just bring us into this place here tonight in the fifth seal brother Branham this quote is these things that just just always it's wrung out to my heart and been so dear to me brother Graham talks about each of these ages remember these four living creatures it's the same spirit of God that there is a characteristic that is to be made manifest among the people of God there have been seven Gentile church ages which you can read in the Book of Revelations where God has been calling and taking a people for his namesake it has always been the holy spirit that has been calling to the people but remember God just does not call people into a church he is summoning his people and gathering them into himself the word he will lead us to himself by the word and to think that that inspiration that would fall upon upon the ages throughout of how that God would begin there with that of the lion anointing they would come out of the Upper Room where the lion had roared and here they came out roaring they roared for those three ages and then it moved over into the next stage there and then it comes forth with that of the Ox were they loved not their lives unto death were they surrendered and they submitted their lives and then it moved from there into that of a man anointing God raising up a man by the name of Luther and begin the Reformation what's God doing he's building back his church not by might not by power but by my spear it says the Lord this mountain shall be removed and even worked under that man anointing and then it comes to the Eagle anointing that is broke upon this last day why would it be an eagle anointing at the last because the promise is the coming of the Lord it is the promise of rapture and that of an eagle and eagle swoops down and lays claim and it lifts up it takes out it lifts and takes unto its abode and that's what the Spirit of God is doing in this hour that's the culmination it's the rapture of xix that's upon the Church of the Living God [Applause] the brem said they were under the inspiration of the Spirit of God let me just read it to you he said how could they do anything else besides the power of God that had been released to them so now I'm going to set this up to represent something if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by is the spirit that works among them that's humility to let him work that's humility blow dam goes on to say he says now the church they responded to that anointing and they couldn't do nothing else but responded that anointing he talks about the line just for sake of time let me just skim over this for tonight the lion roared here they came out they they they they responded to that anointing they were made to respond to that anointing it's just like your phone if I dial your number you were hooked up to a network that's made to respond to that signal I could I could say I could take brother Drake's number and say I'm gonna call brother Shane I could call and say this is who I'm trying to call this is what I'm gonna call if brothers shamed us and have that number and he's not tapped into that you doesn't matter how much I say I want to contact him I'm not gonna be getting in contact with him what it shows is the Spirit of God is released by the word of God and there are those who are ordained to receive that anointing of the word in this hour you may have a problem seeing yourself in it but God ain't never changed what he sees about you you might need some divine assistance like we all have needed and we need but God is able to show you you can look at something and say it's truth but I don't know about me that inspiration is here in the building tonight to open your eyes that you might be able to see yourself in the back we can never by our own will see ourselves it takes a surrender of our little and the inspiration comes to lift us from this defeated state it comes to lift us into a realm that we've bumped into throughout our life and it lifts us into that place what does that the mercy of God you know what I'm talking about you try to run from and get away from it you can't you know what you're a danger this life [Music] gotta let you go so far sir four enough [Applause] you question whether I was interested in you you question whether I let you you question whether you was a part of this [Music] it's the mercy of Almighty God his inspiration comes to you and I owe the Lord Jesus when a king time for them to give their lives unto death he had the anointing marriage of church and state in the pergamus age a uniting of this then here we find right after in that time right after that here moves into the ox anointing were then now it moves from that of the lion and northing same Holy Ghost but it moves into that place well here they are they're taken and they have to give their lives they're giving their lives I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this tonight they could only respond to the anointing that was on let me just move ahead to this and this is where almost stopped tonight these four anointings it's the same Holy Spirit it's God inspiring our faith in Him empowering us to meet the challenge the waters of Marah that are before you God inspires us to meet the challenge now in every one even though under the characteristic in this hour we are under the eagle anointing but yet in our everyday walk every one of these characteristics are made manifest in our marriages every one of these characteristics are made manifest there's times to Aurora like the line there's time to sacrifice your idea there's times to raise and rise above it like an eagle there's times to use wisdom to know this is the right time to bring it up wrong time to bring it up it's time these we work under these anointings because they are in earthly deliverance every face let me just say like this every face is an aspect of the same Holy Spirit and his power of deliverance as we pray God responds to our faith by looking our way with a facet of his deliverance now if we had our choice we would take certain facets certain phases to look at us there'd be certain characteristics we want we would Satan probably many of us would say I always want the Eagle looking when I'm praying for healing I want to see the Eagle but God might show you the Ox God might show the lion but it's all God and they just say this without reading cults that I've read to you before all healing comes from God but the brand had a doctor said brother Bantam do you believe that you really get medicine heals brother brems says sure he said I believe God heals by medicine he said God heals by love God heals by music God heals by surgery God heals by he goes on and on he said but remember it all depends on what kind of healing you need he said after all it's everything it's God heals cuz I'm the Lord that he loved all that diseases are you with me so when the lion anointing would empower your faith he comes forth with a boldness and a great courage tenacious fight for healing or you never backing down you might say that's why I want to approach this God may not be anointing you as a lion in this one are you with me come on now we remember we're made not by the will of man but they came they were set aside and moved by the Holy Ghost remember it's the spirit that come into the Wills are you with me which wherever the spirit was to go their spirit went also see we are lambs to be led but the other the other banner is the Eagle and the Eagle anointing is a miracle let me just put it like this all healing and I want you to hear me clearly all healing is a miracle listen I know it's also had to go through surgery I'm getting to that anointing in a minute all healing comes by God it's no less faith than another matter of fact I can read out read you here problem coming weeks brother Bram said it he said if God come down and positively healed you right now he said you know he would actually take greater faith to take a promise and stand on it and look for it to come to pass than that but our mind says man it's a miracle it's aren't you glad God just comes and says doctor said hey brother name is sister name and let me friends I'm glad for me I don't know about you I'm glad for me but on my heart these things are just waiting and looking to it that it would be a help to us be an eagle anointing brother Joey it comes by and picks us up well one moment we're sick one moment were I mean there is no wait the saint of gradual the eagle anointing is my gradually becoming you know day by day step by step did you pick you up right away it's gone then we have the man anointing but it's still God how many are glad for Luther's message Wesley's message do you look at Luther's message and say well you know Luther's know Ava's God the man anointing is still God it's God healing through the intelligence of man woo Amen God uses surgeons and medicine with knowledge that came from him for his healing work so what are you saying well a person could say you know what I went up and I was prayed for for an ulcer and you know what hit left me another person can say how when and you know what had an ulcer and they operate on me I'm healed this person has no glory over this person it was God who gave me inspiration all healing comes from God and then the last one we don't like to maybe talk about it too much but the ox' anointing if the ox' anointing looks our way it's death surrendering giving life precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints God heals even in death I went up next to that little casket I stood right there right next to Liliana's casket I stood right there with my wife I looked at her on that bed when we went up there to pray on that Friday night I came home and told my wife I said I don't know if she's still in that body or not her she's already crossed to that other body I said I don't know I said I don't know how where where it's just at right there because I said they might be keeping that that body alive I said but you know brother Richard I think Rachel had sister Rachel I mentioned that we just had no longer walked out of the room she comes to for a moment says it's okay you say what was that all about well I'm not trying to interpret everything but if you've seen what she saw you'd say it's okay I couldn't act like this in a funeral home but I'm free to act like this now if you two saw what she saw [Applause] program said before that age of accountability he said that child cannot it's innocent he said it doesn't matter if it's the Andria's parents or whatever more behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world it was the blood of the Lamb that pay for that atonement brother Branham said as soon as that child passes out of this life it goes into the arms of the Lord Jesus he said the very moment it gets there it recognizes the cross of Calvary and what Calvary cared for it hallelujah she didn't want to come back to that body I'm telling you even though here she was seven years old right brother Richard she was seven years old but she had already crossed into a dimension that I've preached about him I've lived from the life of that dimension but she already had crossed there God's Word was not defeated it may not have been when we were looking for of a line anointing or an eagle anointing or a man Ananta but an oxen intent if she stood her testimony throughout it all she states those treatments day after day without bitterness or resentment I'm telling you I wasn't it was an anointing that was there I'm free to preach now she stepped from that body into a body somewhere between 18 and 25 years old and the presence of the Lord had come in the room I don't know if she opened her eyes I don't know what but she was enough to say it's okay if they knew what she was seeing they would say it's more than okay well does it tear the heart yes I think of brother Richard and sister Maria that's her grandbaby but you see as a believer we have a hope sure we're sorrowful surely more sure they're gonna need our prayer and our comfort but they've gotta hope they know it's not a mystery to them they that are alive and remain shall not hinder you got another one to come to you don't worry I don't got my glasses on but I can see both of you you got one to come to you another one don't worry you'll know and you won't need no iPhone with face let me see what you look when you're 18 years old you'll know the glory of God God rich in mercy even in death God heals I think I'm my daddy he got to a place moving him shuffling feet he's in pain couldn't hard to sleep he's sugar all over the board and he fought like crazy to keep those things in line wouldn't eat after certain times what's this what's that and all those things like that but you know what that morning he doesn't need no cane over there brother Carlos he went from shuffling to running [Applause] he had the aneurysm and the brain bleed on this side right here but you know what it was just the time and the inspiration moved upon him little Sammy did you all try to pray for him and you prayed that God would heal him we sure did the joy I prayed all the way to the Cleveland Hospital but in my heart there was a piece that I know if this is your Time Lord did that stop the waves and everything from coming it did not stop the waves of grief from coming it did not stop when there's a certain smell a certain sound when there's a certain thing it did not stop that but you know what it gives me grace to know I see you in the morning you love the Lord may God help us as we would look at these things through his word tonight amen healing it's simply healing taking place the Ox anointing it's healing in another dimension and whatever way that God responds he's the Lord that healeth all our diseases this I mean what should I do don't be anxious don't be anxious just look to the Lord Simon I don't know whether I'm to take this path or that don't be anxious what should I do I would just pray I'd stay in the word and I'd expect the spirit to move on my spirits because the spirit will move in the Wills to direct us let's pray father we love you tonight Lord we appreciate you one mercy that you had given to us Lord what I thought about Lord these things for quite some time lord Hallett's it's meant so much to me and didn't know women if I would bring it to the church or but it's helped me so much Lord and I've seen Lord how you're continuing to move in our hearts giving to a celebrity Lord but that's what the Spirit of the Lord where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Oh God it loosens us from pride it loosens us to a place that Lord a person is able to stand and testify of their healing no matter what facet of the anointing has come upon them whether it was eagle whether it was lying whether it was man or whether it was ox you had the same yesterday today and forever now father you know the needs Lord that are gathered here tonight no Lord the direction hearts would be seeking for your will Lord we've just looked in your word here tonight and you spoke so clearly to us that the Spirit there's the spirit of men and the inspiration of the almighty giveth us understanding it's not as Ella who would state it ain't about how old we are and ain't about how young male and ain't about how much we know it's about how we can be unit to you help us Lord we don't want to have that name in part and that name in part is about us we don't want that name in part Lord when it comes to week look for a promise and we're trying to tell you this is how you're going to fulfill it no no no no no you keep every one of your promises help us to just respond to the inspiration of the Holy Ghost if it's just snatch us away in Eagle give us to give us the courage and tenacity tenacity to stand with boldness like a lion if it's for long and Lord God buy medicines surgery doctors they anointing a man God that Lord which we don't like to talk about but that of the ox father we ask for your grace every one of us right here tonight there's not a mortal that don't want to live if there's one here tonight or would be listening in under the sound of my voice that they feel like there's no reason to live Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you I rebuke you under the authority of the Spirit of God him who has come to give us life and give us life more abundantly in the name of Jesus Christ Lord if there's one here that doesn't have life if there's still the things of the world in their life may they Lord look to you and say God take the world out
