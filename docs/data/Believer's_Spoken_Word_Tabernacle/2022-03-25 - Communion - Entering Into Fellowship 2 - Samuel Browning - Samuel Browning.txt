it's love it gets sweeter as the days go by oh my oh my what inspiration must have struck the songwriter oh my who knows what he was thinking of at the moment but it had to be thinking back over his life and over the tests and over the trials and even like it shows that picture in the footprints of the sands of times it said i see two foot i t two sets of uh footprints but sometimes i only see one set he said oh in that time that's when i was carrying you oh glory be to god in the highest amen don't you just love him tonight oh my we are certainly a blessed people in this hour amen let's just go to the lord in prayer if you'd like to stand with us before we turn to the word of god and just uh as you just continue to keep uh sister linda in prayer as well god will just continue to move and strengthen her i don't know if they put it out or not but they had to do a trach on her the other day and because they've been going back and forth with that breathing tube and then you have all of that trying to get uh you know strength as far as sustenance and things in her when we were there on friday before they did this with the trick this was already in the plans to do it so they could get her up and start doing the therapy even more and worry with some of those other hindrances sometimes we don't know the pathways god's going to take you know we pray for certain we pray and we're looking um and when we were there she had very good color and she was very strong and then i hear the reports yesterday and because the way that as i spoke to you before the way i've been praying is god will just strengthen her in her spirit and in her mind and well of the testimony and what i received even of the other day she's got her spunk and so i'm glad to hear that amen you know and i i spoke to you the other day when we were there and i said and linda i said brother bannon made it this clear he said you get it before you a vision of a perfectly whole person and he said you make step by step by step until you become that person i said so that that person in front of you is well because the lord jesus christ has already done the work you just keep walking step by step i said every little thing that therapy and everything that they're asking to be done you know we just believe that we believe that sometimes there's things that comes our way and it's it's setbacks that could it could knock us in our spirit and in our mind for a loop we don't go into anything with those kind of expectations you don't go into any surgery focused on the fine print if you do you'll call up and say uh i just do without that's why it's fine print you know what you're focused on but i'm glad we've got another report i'm glad we got another report that's a report that we're locked into here tonight so we want to just just lift her up in prayer as well and so there's other other requests even within that of ukraine many of the ones they've there's no brothers and sisters in maripo many of the other places you know they've just dispersed into other areas and one of the things you know that brother barry had heard a statement that he had made regarding and he said you just don't know in these times that god couldn't be spreading them to reach that last one in europe you don't know you see in the book of acts persecution came and it caused spreading if that persecution had not come then they wouldn't have spread and the gospel had not been spread god knows what he's doing and it's it's certainly the things is not comfortable to our flesh it's not comfortable in any of those things at all so we want to hold those brothers and sisters up in prayer and that god will just continue to strengthen them as well amen some of them that are still in that donbass region i think of donostek some of the believers that are there well when russia has come in there they're wanting they've up to age to where now they're recruiting to take the men that are there and turn them against their own country in battle so you've got brothers and sisters there all the way up to age 65 and so we're just praying that you know they won't have to enter into that place and that part of it and you realize where we're where we're at brother bannon made it so clear i just say it in this way putin seems like he's strong but he's afraid but the brandon brother ram told us he said his fear on either side fear on either side and so you see it's fear that's dominating these things and what's driving it but in a tremendous that in an hour that we live in when there is fear and there is tensions everywhere that the bride of jesus christ we can dwell in perfect love and it it cast out fear it didn't say that sometimes fear might not try to encroach but we've got a strength within us just like the dove has that oil within her she don't have to take a bath she's got an oil that keeps her clean and perfect love it cast out all fear amen we thank god for that so let's just go to the lord in a word of prayer heavenly father lord there's many needs lord i know that was wrote down there's unspoken requests right here among your children even those that would be streaming lord of this service and father we take every one of these requests lord because in your sight they lord there's not one that's greater than the other you're mindful of every need if you would tell us in your word of how that the very hairs of our head are numbered and that you know lord when a when a bird would fall you know every detail your prophet would tell us you knew how much tallow that a flea would make it shows god you are the omniscient one oh god you are mindful of every need lord of your children as they've gathered here lord and just separated themselves from the toils of this life and these days lord we lord lift up lord every need and lord our sister linda oh god that you'll just continue lord to move for her lord you would just continue to strengthen every fiber of her body oh god and father lord just a complete work lord just raising her up completely lord jesus we pray oh god let let the strength and oh god the mercies of god just move into that hospital room lord i pray that god that when lord a thought of discouragement would come lord may quickly oh god the presence of god just move right in there lord may it be that image of god that's right before our lord that's in her heart oh god of a perfectly whole person lord jesus oh granted lord we pray father lord for our brothers and sisters lord that father gathering there lord from ukraine in the different places lord god we ask lord that you'll just continue to strengthen them lord and just encourage them lord just continue lord to guide and direct their footsteps lord for truly lord you are jehovah jireh lord you're the one that's directing and guiding them lord and we just thank you for your mercies we're thankful lord in this place and this time that we live that lord we're in the place of safety your god a place of refuge lord a place that we can let off the pressure lord a place of god where perfect love has the right of way to lord in our lives oh god what a wonderful lord a wonderful place to be lord in you father lord we love you if there's one that doesn't know you that way lord may god you move in your tenderness and sweetness to that heart lord and just let them know of your great care lord and may their heart be so turned o god to open and receive that care o god that you have provided lord for them lord we pray we ask these things for the glory of god in jesus name amen amen amen let's turn in our bibles to first john chapter one and i certainly love you lord tonight so good to see you and tonight just trust the lord will just just come by our way and just speak to us in a very personal way tonight i want to read here in in first john chapter 1 and verse 1 and i have a few scriptures here to read john writes it in this way that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us notice notice verse 3 that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ and these things right we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin amen may god bless the reading of the word as you're being seated if if we can just looking in the scripture here and we've been dealing with on prayer what prayer really is prayer is a is a real time of communion god would make a way that you and i can come back into that place that not only to speak to him but to hear from him and as we've been looking at it that there's many when we look in the scriptures the as jesus would say ask the father anything in my name and i'll do it and you know people i know people that though not walking in the light of the truth but when they can pray and pray for different needs and there'll be things that take transpire take place god will answer them and that's that's just the mercy of god but you see this when we talk about communion this is where god is disclosing his heart brother branham would speak of it in this way in christ the mystery and he would say how that god is not uh he said though though he said it's to all to anybody he said it's to all but he says it's only the elect that's going to respond and he said it's just like he said the that he said for that young lady that you're going to marry and he brings that type in because that's the real type of communion and fellowship and relationship he said is that you begin to disclose to her secrets of your heart and brother brown says that's where he said god he said he's not letting flirters know what's going on he said he's speaking his love secrets to his bride that's a channel of comm of communion between god and his bride just like it would be between a husband and a wife things that's just exclusive and let me just say it in this way that should be exclusive between a husband and wife and i i would you know i would say it in this way that there are things that are just there that is exclusive to that household that well we could go on on that but i'm not going to dwell on that but we're such a such a thing that could be applied in other words let me say it in this way that not everybody knows your business is that okay to say it that way there's a special inside of that of that house it's not that things are done wrong it's that when as we look at it with christ and his bride that christ has such a way of how that he has moved in our life to our faults our failures our mistakes he never discloses to no one else it is personal between he and i is that right and there is a communion of how that he deals with our life my life how he deals personally with our lives with one another there's a fellowship that we have and john would would speak of it in this way the desire notice this fellowship that god had of what was there in the beginning there in the garden of eden notice how that this fellowship in the restoring of it john writes of it in john 1 1 of how the word that was with god the word was god how that same word came down and became flesh now through the through and by the shed blood the the opening of the weight now that same life that now comes upon the worshiper and brings you and i into that place of a restored fellowship and notice the burning the desire as it's expressed in first john 1 3 that that which we've seen and heard declare we unto you that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ in other words john here is the heart of god the heart of christ that's long that's being expressed for fellowship it's an invitation to come into fellowship you see this fellowship does not come in a manner of of of borders or just to say it's got to be here and if it's not here that's that's not how this fellowship works this fellowship what john is saying is the fellowship we're expressing to you is the fellowship that we have with the father and with his son jesus christ so here's a fellowship that he's expressing a way that has been opened up and here when we look in in 1st john chapter 1 verse 8 just continuing there in our text it says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins that's that's a big one right there if we confess our sins in other words come completely clean with god because god already knows what's there before us and if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness so this confession leads to it brings about a forgiveness that's his faithfulness god's faithfulness is not when the sin is confessed to dwell upon oh how bad this says and now no as soon as it's confessed then forgiveness he's faithful to forgive and it leads into reconciliation cleanse us from all unrighteousness in other words deal with the very root of the problem that was there in the beginning aren't you glad for that if we confess our sins if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us so when we we look at this i when i look at those three scriptures there that is it's very uh imperative that in every generation that every generation has a fresh chance at the word of god no matter the the the knowledge that we can have of the word and i can speak for young people on up no matters we're setting underneath a gospel of truth and of power but it still has to come to a realization that i'm a sinner no matter if mommy and daddy holy ghost field but you have to have your own experience with god it doesn't matter even coming to a church doesn't even matter when we say well i believe brother branham's a prophet we first have to be able to really see has the words dealing with our life that i need a personal experience with jesus christ because if not we're just changing out theology we trade in baptist theology for message theology and that's why brother branham could say when he spoke to the young people he would say say to them in one of the messages on leadership he said we just don't want to come and learn the message we want to have a personal experience with jesus christ so when we look at it it's to be a life this message that god has sent to you and i is to be an expression of our life and that's what john was writing this fellowship that we're declaring there is an expression of god's own life working out through our life it's the same fellowship that they noticed in the book of acts that peter and john had when they took notice they're ignorant they're unlearned but they've been with jesus you see what stood out was they've been with jesus what was the effect they had fellowship with the lord jesus they had come in by the new birth to a full fellowship remember they walked with him while he was here upon the earth they sat around the campfire with him but they did not have the fellowship that he desired to restore back to them but that fellowship are you hearing me tonight that fellowship that they had around the campfire that word being made known and visibly before them that testimony that they could see and say that what moses spoke of by the spirit of god we found him when peter could say in that in that manner where else can we go thou alone has the words of eternal life those were necessary moments of fellowship to stir their hearts into the fellowship that god had intended for them which would come after the offering up of the sacrifice the resurrection and now through the outpouring of the holy ghost you say brother samuel what are you saying i'm saying that's just like family altar that's just like our homes that's just like right here it's necessary there being a fellowship with jesus christ it's true we cannot give our children the new birth i can't give you the new birth you can't give we can't go vice versa but if we can come into that place there's such a fellowship we can stand like john and say the fellowship that we have we're declaring that fellowship with you and we're letting you know it's for you too hallelujah it's necessary it's very necessary so to think what a power of this fellowship when we talk about this fellowship we're talking about the holy spirit taking up residency in our lives where that life has been changed and that that channel of communication now is fully open that god is speaking to a son and daughter of god that has been brought into expression by his own life you see when we look at that of the lord jesus the way into the holiest of holies when you think of the tabernacle there in the wilderness was which was an expression of you and i living in a three-room house and god's ultimate desire was that that fellowship would be restored but it wouldn't be restored in the first court of our flesh it wouldn't be restored in our spirit realm but it was to be restored in that of the most sacred place in that of the soul on the inside that's where he told moses i will meet thee there and commune with you there and yet we realize every one of these other parts that go along with that of the tabernacle that you and i when we see it in this hour god came down he came down and lived in a three-room house expressed exactly what man had lost in the fall he was the expression he paid the price and there was a communion that he had with the father that he could say i thank thee that thou hearest me always it was a communion that he could he was he was looking he was in tune with what the spirit wanted to be done at that time the spirit would call to him quicken to him different things that needed to happen in that junction of time you see that was god expressing this is the fellowship that we're to have and we have a pleasure to have with god friends your eye it's not us finding our way it's the spirit of god that has come and sought us out it's called quickening to us the things that even we're to be praying about it's god's desire can't you see even in that i believe we can it's god's desire and longing for fellowship that god would reveal and make himself known so that you and i could begin to seek for those things to come to pass in our life you see this this way that's been opened into this kind of glory it opened the way through the shedding of the veil there you know at calvary it opened the way so that man could come back into a real pentecostal fellowship into a place of the presence of god where the power of god will cleanse that man or that woman from all unrighteousness to where they become new creatures in christ jesus where all backwardness and shameness is taken away from that life like paul could say be not ashamed of me nor the testimony of jesus christ paul could say i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ you see paul was expressing that there was nothing that he had to be ashamed of but it was the greatest greatest privilege paul had been identified with great men like camilla and the rest of them but paul could look at this those men could not do for paul what the lord jesus did the lord jesus brought paul into a fellowship paul knew the word but that was not the fellowship that god was calling him to he was calling him to where the word would not be out here but that word would be on the inside of his life it would be god wrapped up in that veil a fellowship where god could speak to him personally where god speaks to you and i personally and that's why that in the in the time when we consider and we look at it of how that the bible speaks of how that the bride of jesus christ is to be bringing forth children children that are crying have a father god doesn't have grandchildren right god has only children only sons when you find how god would reveal himself in the old testament uh just an example when you take that of of isaac and you recognize that though when god would speak to isaac or even to jacob let me just take jacob for a man or he can talk about it with isaac as well and notice he would speak to jacob and he says i am the god of your father abraham he never said i'm the god of your grandfather and the god of your father abraham god reveals himself personally to every generation to every one of his children in a personal way that's why the recording in the book of hebrews is where it speaks of the writing of the book and it declares that the gathering of the brethren it's the church of the firstborn so god only has sons he doesn't have any grandchildren whatsoever but when we look at this entering into the fellowship i tell you we as we said we recognize without the mercy of god your eye would not be able to find our way i think our brother billy paul said it he said before god sent his prophet he said farmers didn't even know how to cross a fence i know that's pretty simple but you understand what i'm saying when we look at it god revealed and opened up the way for you and i in this hour then we can come into a full relationship with jesus christ you see here we come into the place hebrews chapter 10 let's just move right back into here in hebrews 10 verse 19 it says having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus this is god's desire this what i will read here in these verses is the effect of fellowship being restored having boldness therefore brethren to enter into the holiest by the blood of jesus by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having a high priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water because here god moves down to remove or to deal with what is between or hindering fellowship because because without without us coming through the blood or as we're coming to that place there is sin that is between us and god as the prophet would call it a chasm and that sin has to be dealt with and god has already made a way through him by the blood of jesus that that sin has been dealt with that's where when we can come to that place to confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us and cleanse us from all unrighteousness that we might have be able to come before him with a true heart because you can't commune with anybody you're on edge with you can't you avoid them are you hearing me see this is god's working you and i could not do this even when we look in the old testament when god made a way of where he would take that of an innocent an innocent one there in the fall in the beginning and he would throw them you know the the clothing the garments of that innocent one back in there and they would stand there clothed in those bloody garments in the presence of almighty god that's the only way they could stand in his presence and here as the as as paul is writing by the spirit of god that our hearts have been sprinkled from or as brother braham says shook away from a conscience he's dealt with the sin problem evil and darkness has been shook out of it and our bodies have been washed with pure water through water baptism in the name of jesus christ and we can walk freely and boldly up to god knowing this that the evil that i once loved has passed away knowing that the life that i once lived is now ceased not because i did it because something come in me and did it itself oh glory be to god by grace he saved me i believed him he gave me the holy spirit and the things that i once hated i now love the sacrifice it used to be hard for me to go to church now i love to go to hear the people sing shout and testify i used to hate it i love it now something has changed me then i have a new and living way oh my this is an expression the new and living way is an expression through our lives something has anchored here i know when i went down into the water and they baptized me in the name of jesus christ and i have received his life gone made a way god's preparation for fellowship it's just like if you were going to have someone to your house well you don't invite somebody to your house and expect them to bring the dishes and the food and come over and you know clean it and set everything else up and cook it i don't think you do that no you you make preparations right you everything is taken care of to make sure that the guest will be able to come in and there'll be a meal that's provided in that in the natural of what you and i could do out of a desire to have fellowship with brother and sister family families what have you how much greater that god before the foundation of the world before adam dust or molecule god already provided in the mind of god the way that it would be unfolded for you and i to come back into fellowship with him and he knew we would desire to come back into fellowship with him as a matter of fact when job when job you know in the writing there is the realization that the morning stars shouted for joy what were what were the mornings start shouting about that's speaking of you and i when we could see our salvation through the lamb of god there was a shouting that went on oh i mean think about it that was the focus but now when we look at how god has made a way that that that you and i can come in to that fellowship back with god once again god provided the way god made a way god gave the sacrifice you see god knew you and i would desire that because we are a part of him and he desired fellowship as adam in the beginning he's spoken you know here gave names to all of the animals but there was still something that god could see within him you don't read it in the scripture it's not an utterance it's a silence but god sees the silence and in there he sees there's a longing for fellowship hallelujah so god addresses what nothing else can be seen no one else sees it or knows it but god sees that desire what was it it was something that even adam could not explain but he was desiring a fellowship with one of his kind that's what god that portrayals air is exactly what god had in mind that god had a desire to have fellowship with one of his kind in other words somebody someone he can speak to that won't look at him and say that's not necessary but he wants somebody he can speak to and have communion with and welcome his words and will take it to their heart where his desire it pulsates within them god placed that desire in you and me god knew that we would want the holy ghost because there's a desire within you and i that calls out for life it calls out for fellowship remember as we were looking at last week and i just want to move through this into certain places of how in numbers 19 where they were to take a red heifer and they were too that red heifer could not have have been yoked with anything it could never have had a yoke on it i was speaking of christ it was speaking of the word of god that never to be yoked up with a denomination never to be yoked up with an idea of man it's christ that's above it all right so this is there this this opening of where there would be no spot in it no blemish in it and then they were to take of of the blood of this red heifer and the bible tells us of how they would sprinkle that blood seven times before the tabernacle of the congregation and how that they would take of the ashes of where they would they would they were there after the offering they would burn that that red heifer and they would take those ashes and they would be kept up to for for uh waters of separation to where would be placed in a vessel where running water and it could be sprinkled upon the unclean it could be sprinkled on one that maybe had fallen out of fellowship it could be sprinkled on them has waters of separation that was the beginning to enter into fellowship now think of this in this manner that was to be that what had been done there was the ashes were gathered and they were to be kept up in verse 9 of numbers 19 just to reference that they were to keep this up for the congregation of the children of israel for a water of separation let me say this it wasn't for everybody this was for god god gave this this is for that of the congregation of israel and the prophet would place it down so clearly he said notice this is what god has given of the bread of life is for his bride his believing children knowing that he would take the waters of separation in order to bring you an eye back into fellowship under the blood hallelujah and those seven stripes it spoke of seven ages it spoke of a time of those gentile ages even though it was given there but it would speak in this time where you and i are out and there would be seven ages because every age when we remember as we read last week and you read in revelations one the seven churches the seven spirits the seven stars are the seven messengers it's the same holy spirit it's the same holy spirit coming and delivering the message to each generation to come under the blood amen it's no other message where everywhere even in the beginning in the ephesian age where the church had already fallen entering into that age but remember the message was to call them uh separate them away from the traditions of man because satan started out right there in that first age or writing into it to substitute the reality of jesus christ in the heart and life of the people satan doesn't care how religious that we are but if he can keep that relationship where there is no fellowship between god and his people to where it is no longer god dwelling in the heart of the people then he's got to defeat it because it isn't the word out here that backs the devil up he's not listening to our voice but it's the voice of the word on the inside of us that backs him up and so god in simplicity would sin this is why god sends a message i want you just to phone in here just a moment just some things really pressing on my heart because when god sends a message it's not like the rest it's not a blending in with the world when god sends a message think how the world looks at it the world looks at it with harshness well we don't have to do that we don't have to do that that's unnecessary but if they can only hear that the voice yes it's correction but it's a voice to break the whole of delusion and that voice that that is there holding them in bondage and keeping them back from a relationship with jesus christ it's the mercy of god to every age god's sending his word let me say this even to every young person and every person gathered here it's the mercy of god that comes right to your doorstep and lets you know that there is a need for a real relationship and it's him that's asking you i want a relationship i'm standing at the door i'm knocking open up and i'll come in i'm not going to force my way in but i'll come in and we'll have communion that's god's desire it's a mercy of god so these waters were waters of separation that's why with the sprinkling of those waters if waters say come join a church that ain't the waters of separation if waters say you believe brother braham is a prophet that's not the waters of separation are you hearing me listen the devil knows brother brandon was a prophet he experienced many times the mighty god coming down and through that vessel being cast out our lives no question with him right but that in itself is not it's not an evidence but so we look the waters themselves what are the waters when you see it water's a separation so it's not waters that come to allow us to remain in the condition that we're in it's waters that come to bring a separation or draw us into fellowship with god and in order to come into fellowship with god we've got to be washed the waters of separation must come forth and it brings conviction in our life oh my this is why when we when we examine this here that in order to enter into this place of fellowship and i think i referred to this one in closing last week brother rahm's talking about this place of fellowship of relationship of communion in the holiest of wholeness before you can enter this place there's a blood veil hanging there for the cleansing and you must recognize that blood as an innocent substitute see that's very important is to recognize that blood as an innocent substitute it's not it's not something that a church has done or a man can do for you but to recognize the blood of an innocent one you see what it is it's taking the eyes of the worshipper off of himself the waters of separation it brings conviction it it it brings a cleansing it brings a separation as that man would enter in he's separating there it's separating him from his sin there's a even in his mind his thinking becomes different he begins to feed upon the word of god let me just say this to you just trying to just go in a very not to move in a fast manner but many times lives come into a place where the waters of separation has dealt with that life but you have to continue to allow the waters of separation to wash you this is where you feed on the word of god you draw strength you have to feed your experience you can say brother samuel i i've got to come clear all the way in there but remember fellowship itself is the holy spirit drawing you bringing you to the place to where you look at and you see the blood that's gone before you one has made a way that you and i you can come into this place and we feed upon that word so many times you know don't don't look for feelings upon things just just feed on the word take the word into your life put on a message over the same i don't understand that well that's no reason to turn it off you're not going to understand it the more you turn it off but give yourself to it give yourself to it read in the scriptures pray this is part of entering into fellowship if you can't do that now why would you want to go into fellowship with him because fellowship and communion with him this is where you're in that place like jacob's son where the angels of god are ascending and descending you're in a place of communion of fellowship with him this is why even right here lives and we're pointing to to the full fellowship and we stop right there we stop but you got to keep going gonna keep going through the preaching so through the preaching of the word that veil of blood is brought down it's made personal see it's not a historical gospel it's a living god that comes present right here among us to deal with our lives to where it's not something pointing back in history but a living god who comes down right there in the midst of our life and the bible says that the spirit of man is as the candle of the lord where god begins to go down and it begins to just now it's a searching all through the spirit of man it's god searching there the light of the word bringing discernment it's not you and i guessing of things but it's god who is coming to expose the hold of darkness light exposes that that we might walk into the light if we'll walk in the light as he's in the light then we have fellowship one with another and let me just say this that's why we continually even after entering into fellowship there is a burning in our lives to stay in that place of fellowship in other words where we're open we're available we're in contact with god where he can speak to us where there's nothing between he or i there's no funny feelings at all no condemnation at all but where there is an openness and that's why the waters of separation the preaching of the word as it goes forth it's god's desire that you and i would stay in that place of fellowship and communion with him because you see when that veil of blood is brought down then all the things of early earthly possessions brother brown said all the fang dangle ideas and your dancing and more on living and all the things that you thought up of your own self and all these things that you do i go to church i do this i do that i don't eat meat and all these things you lay it aside when the blood veil is brought before you and then he says coming forth from your heart is pledge me in plunge me into the blood and say lord wash me and cleanse me i'm not just reading quotes tonight this is direction lord wash me and cleanse me you see he's not gonna do we must invite him lord wash me and cleanse me well i have this in my life there's power in the blood the innocent one has suffered for the guilty he's made a way that you and i can grow free as a matter of fact we're already free we have to come to that realization i've been made free what are you saying johnny crow look down and realize that the string is no longer on your leg quit walking back and forth across that fence post he who the son has set free is free indeed [Applause] wash me and cleanse me then the holy spirit inside of this blood cell where the fellowship is it'll draw you through the blood of cleansing into the lord jesus by the holy spirit so in mark 8 38 the scripture said whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father and the holy angels he made a way for you and i there had to be there's no other place of fellowship than under the blood now once you think of this there's no other place of fellowship than under the blood i'm laying some groundwork for some things coming on sundays there's no other place for fellowship we're not talking about the chemical we're talking about the life that was inside of the blood the blood was shed on the day of atonement which would coincide there every 50 years there would be a concern a coinciding there of the jubilee there would be one that would blow the horn or the shofar and when they would blow that it was an announcement though others weren't there they didn't see the blood they didn't see it taking place but the sounding let them know the blood has been shed and this is personal for you what is it the blood had a voice within it that lets you know you're free you can go free you don't have to stay in bondage no more you're free i'll tell you jesus christ is the high priest riding through his children writing through his church proclaiming liberty amen this is why think of how when god would send a message notice whoever is ashamed of me and my words me and my words because he is the word he is the word notice he said you're ashamed of me i'll be ashamed of you there the word brings conviction deals with our life and it's drawing us into fellowship if we heed to it that's why there's no without the shedding of blood the bible says there's no remission of sins that's why we had to go back we must go back to god's plan back to the bible because there's just no other way that we can come to god that's the only grounds and yet when you consider the scriptures here many different ones come out of different backgrounds and we hear the blood talked about is that right if you went on sunday perhaps sat in a pentecostal church said in a baptist church they would talk about the blood but it shows they're not getting under the blood because when you get under the blood the life of the blood testifies there is fellowship are you hearing me they're not getting under the blood but there they are there is a ministering that's going on this listen to me now this is why when god has to send a message it's to get us back into the plan of his word that message has come not to elate our heads that message has come to reveal the pathway back home it's come to reveal this is the way back under the blood this is the way back to fellowship oh my psalm 16 11 thou wilt show me the path of life and in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are pleasures forevermore so everywhere that we know there had to be that shedding of the blood on calvary and the pathway david prophesying here thou wilt show me the path of life and in that presence is fullness of joy notice david never came to that place david had a lot of joy but he had joy according to what god had made known through the law but fullness of joy is that joy that jesus christ delivered to the church of the living god and he said the joy that i give you the world can give it to you and the world can't take it away it's a fullness of joy at his right hand in resting in his power in his strength there are pleasures forevermore this path let me just kind of just take a few moments and just kind of drag my feet here on this each of the seven ages have their dip in the spirit of god their stripe of blood remember the seven stripes of blood every age there's seven gentile ages they all came under in their age under the fellowship of the lord jesus through the blood that was revealed to them are you hearing me this is upon my bond this rock i will build my church now yet in this hour that you and i are living in this is the hour where it would be the fullness of the holy spirit visiting the church as we've been just declaring over and over in that of the son of man it's where christ himself comes in his fullness and notice what did he do he made himself known through the ministry of malachi 4 for the purpose that we would recognize it's him that's our bridegroom not brother branham but christ is our bridegroom and that there's a uniting with him to where the two are no longer twain but they're one the marriage of the lamb has come hallelujah is where god has entered in to his temple this is an hour of that fullness that's what separates this message because it's an hour of an ending of gentile dispensations it's a time where sons of god the bible says the earth is groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of god this is the hour to where sons and daughters of god come fully under the blood of jesus christ to where there's no liens against us are you hearing me you see no other age could take the rapture but god in this age sent a message and that message was come under the blood that message is the true sayings of god it deals with our life to bring us to a place to where we are free from the holds of this world satan had a lien on the church before he could say you can't go in the rapture because you got my baptism a lot of other liens there were liens leans doctrines of devils that were there things that weren't straightened out but in this hour god himself he is the abstract he is the breach [Applause] he's the one that stands there and ties us back in to a full life as a son and daughter of god that's what the holy ghost does coming under the blood this is evening time ephesians 5. let me read this quickly for the husband is the head of the wife even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto christ so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything speaking of surrendering of surrendering husbands love your wives even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now think back to that red heifer think back to that offering up brother aaron to where we could enter in to fellowship god provided god provided for himself a sacrifice god provided so that you and i could come back in brother carlos to a full fellowship he gave himself no other blood could do it every other blood was polluted good beings stood down through time but everyone those bloods was sexual born blood but this had to be a virgin born blood why a blood that was free from that of man but it was the creative blood of almighty god where god himself wrapped himself in the blood cell created a blood cell that he might come down and pay the price and through the shedding of the blood make a way that we can come back in to full fellowship with him he gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it only he can do this a church can't do it a church will make you look like a church come on now go along with their beliefs but the word of god we're not it's not that that's not how it's supposed to be the word of god is alone what cleanses us and sanctifies us not the latter but the person of the word himself is what sanctifies and cleanses us with the washing of water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish only under the blood is this produced this is a result of the word let me just kind of just just just coast a few moments here this is the result of the word itself becoming blood for you and i that the word itself might become blood in order to wash you and i in what was in that blood it was the life that was within the blood and that life goes forth to bring cleansing in our life so when the holy spirit as he comes and he's dealing with our life that is the blood of jesus christ coming personally to our lives it's an announcement the blood has been shed and you are included in it it's calling us into fellowship you see it's the word that separates us from our unbelief it's nothing else but the word of god and i want you to think of this brother rabbit says it like this and things that ought to be and i'm coming down here he says think of it in my father's house i'll go and prepare a place for you that take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house there you are take you out of this old earthly pest house this old earthly pesticide he's gone to prepare a place a perfect place where no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exists no death exists let me say that same perfection that we're going to it's reflected when the new birth has come because in the soul there's no evil it's a perfect cleansing this is what that perfection does when it says in his word be there for perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect god provides what was needed that perfection and there's no other perfection but his own life to bring you an eye completely under the blood ram says it like this it's a perfect place calling you to that perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and he quotes that scripture be you therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect it's a perfect kingdom so it must be a perfect people come because you have to stand and be married to a perfect son of god and you must be a perfect bride he's not talking about being perfect in ourselves because remember we could lick our spots and they just stand out more that's all he's talking about it's accepting what he's provided he said so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from our sins the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word the blood the word of god bleeding to wash the bride in now she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place where is the first place in the mind of god see how perfect this blood is this blood just doesn't clean us out but this blood moves us to a place to where there's a complete death and the life quickens that seed and there's a new creation in christ jesus it raises up a new creation in the under the perfection and in the perfection of his life to where our desires are stayed on him are we perfect no we're not perfect but we have a water of separation where we are washed washing with the waters of the word not washed washing with waters of the word because there's a washing that's going on remember once your soul's been washed your soul don't have to be washed again right jesus when he came to peter and he spoke there and peter's like oh no lord you're not going to do that no no no not for me you're not going to wash my feet jesus said if i don't wash you you don't have no part with me see he's applying it to the to the spiritual part if i don't wash you you're not a part of me so there has to come a washing and he says that man need not wash save his hands and feet only once your soul has been washed by the blood of the lamb then there's a washing there you can wash your doings and your goings things that you come in contact are mistakes and so forth there is a washing of water by the word that we can stay in fellowship with him oh my oh brother samuel aren't you afraid that'll produce a loose life not at all that's the gospel that's the gospel that's a liberty that belongs to us as sons and daughters of god brother branham gave a strict strict message and believeth thou this he says don't you try to perfect this you'll never do it but you give must get that this perfected on the inside and when that perfected perfection has come then you've got authority to bring this outer man in subjection to the word and the brother bram goes on to say it'll be a constant war a constant battle but greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world i want you to think of this how in this time that we're living in the announcement could come brother branham would look at that of the third pool the little room and that isn't something speaking out here we're gonna go right here coming into the very soul of man because man is god's place of rest see this message would go clear to the very depths in our life bring us fully under the blood like it was back on the day of pentecost that's the restoring back that's the that's the omega bride being restored back to the alpha bright think of this announcement when thou prayest enter into the closet you know what that says there's an entrance ministered unto you there's a place where it's ministered unto you where you can enter into that secret place with god you're not stumbling and staggering around you you you don't have a waters of separation preached to you it says that's okay to cut your hair it's okay to do this it's okay to do that because that's not a waters of separation that just produces church members but there's a water of separation that brings conviction deals with the life to really do what bring us under the blood and fellowship with god think of this that god would have think of the purpose of this message that god has sent to us every age god would speak to one person he that hath an ear let him hear god would speak to one person then from that person then from that messenger he would go out to others that would come that would come under that light that would come under the headship of that word are you hearing me tells us their people it was seen every age he said some he said that they come around it he said but then he says they'll put their own interpretation to it and they go off into sin but it's to say what's been said you see you see because we're not talking about the mind of a man this is not the mind of william brown grunt took a seven a man who didn't even complete seventh grade and i'm not saying you gotta have a high school diploma to be smart that's not what i'm saying are you hearing me because i don't believe that i don't believe you gotta have to be a smart person but notice god showed you and i that it was not something of the intellect of man that he was coming to god took a vessel that will surrender that he could speak his life through and it would be manifested night after night after night on the platform just stay with me just just a minute here because it's coming on down to an example because when god would give that then that same light would go forth what was it it was a message of calling the children of god to come under the blood when paul could speak of timothy and he could say i have no other one like-minded meaning equal in soul he would be with those who would that were message than revelation had so struck in their heart to call the people under the blood notice then that speaks where god would reveal himself to one person keep the ashes of the red heifer of the red heifer up in a clean place and it must be a clean man god man can't cleanse himself but god cleanses us by his word and god sets a man aside the bible says that holy that the prophets of all holy men of god that were set aside and moved upon by the holy ghost it's god who called them aside they didn't even know what they were saying they were set aside to be a spokesman for god let me say this to you here god would have a vessel a life that that waters of separation that the mystery of god as we were speaking on last week could be kept in a clean heart why because it's calling us to cleanliness to a cleansing under the blood of jesus christ so god not a message that's attached to a denomination not a message that's attached to an idea not a message that man has his thumb over and man says well brother brown said this here brother man no but in a clean place a clean place so that it reduces what cleanliness it produces the life of jesus christ i'm thankful for that because that clean place notice among a clean congregation where the washing of water by the word it brings forth liberty but we know where we stand we're washed in it we're not wondering we've come under the blood we're not walking in darkness we're not walking under the ideas of man but we are in fellowship with almighty god we have met him we have come in contact with him we've been united with jesus christ the relationship with him where he speaks lip to ear to you and i in the bible oh oh if i could put this together no it ain't about all of that right there remember we just lay in the word and he unfolds these things but god sends his word to call us into full fellowship with him aren't you glad for that and i just say that's that's that's the invitation that for every life i'm finished i just stop that's the call for every every life every heart is to come fully under the blood that's the call that's the it's open the way is open it's been made clear before us you see we're not just we're not talking we're not just talking about the blood but he who created that blood cell is right here among us because of life under the blood it reflects it's a life under the blood where all things are settled where there's rest and peace in him and it's a reflection of his own oh my god life bare our hands i say tonight if if any did not come to that place don't take anything for granted but just fully fully fully just deliver yourself over into his hands just let god just just come in just such a special way you say brother samuel this was a thursday night well god doesn't make any difference between thursday night or sundays i'll tell you in the preparation of things i don't there's no difference in the preparation that he directs me for thursday night than he does for sunday he's the same god he's very he's very personal and god is so mindful of every single need let's just approach him in prayer before i pray brother branham is speaking to a group of people he says lord here's boys and girls men and women that are standing with humble hearts in confession confession and their wanting to enter into this glory and find peace eternal they're standing as testimonies tonight and you said he that will witness me before men i'll witness before my father and for the holy angels you're ashamed of me and my gospel i'll be ashamed of you at that day before my father and his holy angels men and men and women boys and girls he said that has laid aside their shameness they've come in the bedroom of fellowship and relationship and they're pleading for the shekinah glory to fall upon their souls to change them make them new creatures i say tonight is every head and every heart is bound if there's one here maybe even by a way of the internet and you haven't come into that place with god what a what a moment what a time to really give your life to god thank you you're not coming and staggering and wondering where am i going what am i approaching but there's a living god that's right there right before you not just say it in this manner he's made a way for you he's made a way brother samuel you don't understand i look at all the things in my life no you're looking at the wrong thing look at the blood of the innocent one that was shed for you that's where you focus because you can never make yourself worthy he is the worthy one he's the one who makes us worthy [Music] oh i wonder tonight you just say lord fill my life lord i want that relationship i want that fellowship with you that's what my desire is almighty god amen god bless you amen god bless you [Music] throughout this in this building i think of this time that we have we've come here tonight there's hearts right here among us that where we've crossed into that place of fellowship with god but there's just a longing within our hearts a desire we want to please him and that word as it comes forth to wash us there's a washing that goes on there's a cleansing that takes place it's god moving right down in our midst and maybe things that we could overlook that god would say i let's let's take care of this may as you rub shoulders with the world sometimes you rub shoulders with the world and the things of it and not that you've even done anything but you just feel you just feel so out of place there's a washing of water by the word it doesn't mean that you're a sinner once you've already crossed behind that veil what your desire is to stay in fellowship with him but there's a washing of water by the word that washes you it keeps you clean i just say lord i want to stand in this word i want this word to wash me i want to stand like david search me lord try me if there's any any evil way in me lord perch it out say brother samuel i'm talking about washing of water by the word that goes down if there's something that's out of place in our life maybe it's an attitude maybe it's a grudge maybe whatever we want to stand under the washing of water by the word and let the word just come and just cleanse us granted lord tonight many say lord in my family in my home i want to be that life that's a clean vessel that's set aside right here for this in this assembly my own life i want my own life to be a clean vessel lord that's set aside that can be a help to somebody else along the way oh my there can be a life that reflects out to my home to my family that's my desire but samuel don't you believe that that's already there within your life oh no i do believe that but i want everything to be a clear open channel [Music] a clear channel because as paul could say i die daily every day there's a repenting going on a cleansing of washing we want to be a channel that's available father or do you see the needs lord you see the hands the hearts behind them father i'm asking o god that you administer lord to those lord that their desire would be lord for that full fellowship with you lord god granted i pray lord is there
