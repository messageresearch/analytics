[35:24] night and I appreciate the warm welcome
[35:26] acceptive Spirit want to say God bless
[35:28] you we had some special meetings in our
[35:32] area they're back home over Bible
[35:33] believers had four day meetings still
[35:36] going on so we were fellowshiping with
[35:38] different ones of the Saints over there
[35:40] in that area and different ones said to
[35:42] greet the church and send their own Amen
[35:45] it's wonderful to be part of a body so
[35:48] we want to say God bless you we just
[35:50] appreciate you appreciate brother
[35:52] browning and Trust the Lord will bless
[35:53] him where he's at I believe in North
[35:56] Carolina right which is a meeting so man
[35:59] we know God will use him has used in God
[36:04] bless you this morning let's go right to
[36:05] the word in this wonderful 8th chapter
[36:08] of Romans
[36:23] Romans 8 and we're gonna take the 11th
[36:25] verse down to the 19th verse we just
[36:29] asked for the leadership of Lord this
[36:31] morning
[36:34] the Bible says but if the spirit of him
[36:36] that raised up Christ from the dead
[36:38] dwell in you then he that raised up
[36:41] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[36:42] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[36:46] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[36:49] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[36:51] after the flesh for if you live after
[36:53] the flesh you shall die but if you
[36:55] through the spirit do mortify the deeds
[36:57] of the body you shall live for as many
[37:01] as are led by the Spirit of God they are
[37:04] the sons of God for you have not
[37:07] received the spirit of bondage again to
[37:09] fear but you have received the spirit of
[37:11] adoption whereby we cry Abba Father amen
[37:14] amen that's what the Holy Ghost is given
[37:17] for to be a sign in our hearts a witness
[37:20] a man a voice on the inside testifying
[37:22] who we are where we have come from who
[37:25] we belong to what kind of a life is in
[37:27] us and if we are children then we are
[37:29] heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with
[37:32] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[37:35] that we may be also glorified together
[37:38] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[37:40] present time are not worthy to be
[37:42] compared with the glory which shall be
[37:44] revealed in us for the earnest
[37:46] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[37:49] the manifestation of the sons of God
[37:52] amen creation is groaning for you my
[37:55] friends my brother my sister creation is
[37:57] groaning for you let's just pray
[38:00] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[38:01] word Lord and and for the life that's in
[38:04] this word Lord if it was just a dead
[38:06] letter to us we wouldn't waste our time
[38:08] with it father but over and over and
[38:10] over again by your supernatural power
[38:12] father by the reality of your presence
[38:15] Lord by the clarity of your voice you
[38:17] have opened this word to us Lord and
[38:19] proved it to be the same yesterday today
[38:21] and forever and so Lord we're believing
[38:24] in you Lord we are your children your
[38:26] Holy Ghost on the inside bearing witness
[38:27] of who we are who our Father is Lord and
[38:30] so we want to exalt you this morning
[38:32] father above everything Lord even our
[38:35] own opinions our own preconceptions Lord
[38:37] any baggage that we might have carried
[38:39] into this place Lord every burden every
[38:41] hindrance Lord may be laid down at your
[38:43] altar I pray this morning and Lord we
[38:45] want to surrender ourselves to you
[38:47] and as we sang father give ourselves
[38:49] completely unto you father give
[38:51] ourselves away Lord that you could use a
[38:53] slore to be glorified in us I pray Lord
[38:56] this morning you would start with me
[38:58] father may it be the cry in every heart
[39:00] Lord start here
[39:01] speak to me father speak to my situation
[39:04] in my need and Lord just bring an
[39:06] encouragement if it's what I need Lord
[39:08] bring a rebuke if it's what I need but
[39:09] Lord whatever happens may it be your
[39:12] will father and your way that's our
[39:14] desire Lord as your believing children
[39:16] this morning we dedicate ourselves to
[39:18] you father and may faith rise in our
[39:20] hearts Lord that to omnipotence would
[39:22] meet in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen
[39:25] god bless you as you're seated and and
[39:29] just bear with me for a few moments
[39:31] there's a little bit to unpack here on
[39:33] this but I just want to take my time
[39:34] here at the beginning and explain to you
[39:37] kind of where I'm coming from and I've
[39:40] been been speaking to some young people
[39:42] recently and I and I just had a little
[39:44] thought in my heart on on bloodlines
[39:47] on the power of a bloodline you know and
[39:49] and you know that all nature every
[39:52] creature every everything on the earth
[39:54] has a certain life that's in it has a
[39:56] certain nature certain genetics a
[39:59] certain makeup you know that and certain
[40:02] characteristics that are passed down by
[40:03] blood and so that's something that the
[40:06] Prophet spends a lot of time on talking
[40:07] about the life of the blood the power of
[40:09] the blood and and you know I don't think
[40:12] that's just an accident that that was
[40:15] part of nature and part of creation but
[40:17] I believe that it's something that's
[40:19] very it's very core to the nature of God
[40:22] to the desire of God it was something
[40:24] that was important enough to God that it
[40:26] was one of the first laws that he ever
[40:28] established over the earth when he said
[40:31] let every seed bring forth of its own
[40:33] kind amen amen and that's why a cat will
[40:36] never have puppies and a dog will never
[40:37] have kittens it's a law right it's a
[40:40] it's something that has been put into
[40:42] nature and and so everything whatever
[40:44] kind of a life is that's in it if it
[40:46] reproduces itself if it ever brings
[40:48] something forth it will always bring
[40:50] forth of the same life amen so a dog
[40:52] will give birth to a dog and a horse
[40:54] will give birth to a horse and deity
[40:56] will give birth to deity amen amen
[40:59] and so God is interest
[41:00] and it's important to God to keep the
[41:03] bloodlines pure that's why I hey wait
[41:04] you have many things around the
[41:05] Christian faith that revolve around
[41:07] sexual purity and and keeping those
[41:10] things sacred it's not for it's not some
[41:12] man trying to control you but it's
[41:14] something that God has in his mind that
[41:16] he's trying to bring forth amen and so
[41:18] there's a great question there's a great
[41:20] concept or a great issue in Christianity
[41:23] that revolves around this and that
[41:25] question is what kind of a life is in
[41:28] you not what kind of a church identity
[41:30] you have or a social affiliation or or
[41:33] who your pastor is or what your family
[41:35] name is or any of those things but but
[41:38] what Christianity is asking what the
[41:39] Word of God is asking what God a man is
[41:42] trying to manifest in your life is what
[41:44] kind of a life is on the inside of you
[41:46] amen amen what kind of life is in you
[41:48] and we know that anyone who's born into
[41:50] this fallen world
[41:51] amen no matter what kind of a background
[41:53] they're from or what kind of a person
[41:54] they are all have sinned and fallen
[41:57] short of the glory of God we are born in
[41:59] sin shaped in iniquity amen and so we
[42:01] have nothing in this flesh that can lay
[42:03] claim to anything beyond a beast nature
[42:05] that has fallen it's corrupt it is
[42:07] susceptible to sin amen but but thanks
[42:09] be to God has made a way amen
[42:12] that we could escape the law of this
[42:14] flesh and the law of this sin and that
[42:16] he has placed something on the inside of
[42:19] a Christian heart amen that that speaks
[42:22] of higher things it's a it's a call in
[42:24] our heart that says we came from
[42:26] something higher than the dust of this
[42:27] earth and it's corruption oh my
[42:29] hallelujah but but see we're living in a
[42:32] sinful flesh amen and that's where all
[42:35] the problems are and we know that it
[42:37] that so we find that it's not about a
[42:39] lifestyle or a culture or a law or rules
[42:42] and regulations it's about a life it's
[42:44] about a nature amen
[42:46] it's not just the actions of a sinner
[42:48] that are corrupt but it's the fallen
[42:50] nature on the inside that's what makes a
[42:52] sinner amen brother Bram said when you
[42:54] sin it's because you're an unbeliever
[42:56] that you do that because if you gamble
[42:59] he said.you you lie you steal those
[43:00] things are not sin amen but it's the
[43:03] results of sin it's the attributes of
[43:05] sin it's the characteristics of that
[43:07] life and that's because brother brown
[43:09] said that in you
[43:10] Wells a different spirit amen so what we
[43:13] need friends Amen it's not a it's not a
[43:15] Reformation it's not not not rehab Amen
[43:19] churches are not a place where we turn
[43:20] over a new leaf and amen and we tried to
[43:23] bring a five-step plan to to salvation
[43:26] and perfection you know but but a church
[43:29] is a place where we come to get our
[43:31] nature changed amen to to supernaturally
[43:35] amen take the laws of this flesh amen
[43:39] and submit them to the Spirit of God and
[43:40] it brings a nature change amen and
[43:43] that's the problem with religion and
[43:45] religious spirits and church
[43:47] affiliations many times because because
[43:49] what about grants a said religion is a
[43:51] covering is that right amen and one
[43:54] thing I've learned in my young life is
[43:55] that religion can hide a lot you can
[43:57] hide a lot of sin and a and a lot of
[44:00] hypocrisy and a lot of terrible things
[44:02] go on in this world hidden behind a veil
[44:04] of religion Amen and you can hide behind
[44:07] it and find your comfort behind it but
[44:09] there's nothing about a veil of religion
[44:11] that can do anything for you unless the
[44:13] life behind the name that you put out on
[44:15] the front of your church amen the life
[44:17] behind the name that we seeing in the
[44:19] name that we read about the life behind
[44:21] the name is what makes the demons
[44:23] tremble and it's got to live in you amen
[44:26] Oh hallelujah that's why we stand in
[44:28] defense of the Pentecostal experience
[44:31] amen even though the word Pentecost has
[44:33] become a dirty word around this message
[44:35] amen but I still believe in an
[44:38] experience Amen according to acts 2:38
[44:41] that is to everyone amen
[44:43] it began without an ending it's to all
[44:45] times to all places to all peoples
[44:48] that's a direct quote
[44:48] Amen the Pentecostal blessings must
[44:51] remain upon the church because it is the
[44:53] Pentecost see it's not an emotion it's
[44:55] not clinging to an emotional experience
[44:57] it's not a work up or a culture Amen or
[45:01] or a fanaticism Amen or something about
[45:04] shouting or dancing or screaming but it
[45:06] is the life amen
[45:08] the light behind that Pentecostal
[45:10] experience the change of that nature on
[45:13] the inside is what is essential it is
[45:16] necessary Amen it is inescapable amen
[45:20] Oh hallelujah rather Bram said
[45:22] he's rebuking the church in this quote
[45:24] he says if you had to say you were
[45:26] Pentecostal it would dampen your spirit
[45:28] amen
[45:28] unfortunately that describes a lot of
[45:30] message churches I've been to and but he
[45:32] said that kind of spirit ought to be
[45:34] dampened amen
[45:36] you say it kills the spirit any spirit
[45:39] that could be killed by the name of
[45:40] Pentecost ought to be killed hallelujah
[45:44] that's right Pentecost is not an
[45:46] organization Pentecost is an experience
[45:49] that comes through all the born-again
[45:51] children hallelujah
[45:53] I believe that the true Church of God
[45:55] has always gathered under the reproach
[45:57] of the Pentecostal experience amen
[45:59] hallelujah that's all oh my it's never
[46:02] been the elite of this world or the
[46:04] dignified but Christianity is a religion
[46:06] for slaves and low lives and lowborn
[46:10] people amen they call them holy rollers
[46:12] and fanatics amen and emotional but
[46:15] under the reproach of that name is where
[46:18] God changes the fallen nature of this
[46:21] world into the substance of sons and
[46:23] daughters of God hallelujah even the
[46:26] Pentecostal organization today they've
[46:28] tried to wriggle out from under that
[46:29] mockery amen under the under the
[46:32] reproach of that and they've turned they
[46:34] turned the real experience of God into
[46:36] fanaticism and foolishness and it's a
[46:39] far cry from the book of Acts but there
[46:41] is a true church on the face of the
[46:43] earth amen Pentecost is more than a name
[46:45] more than an organization but it's a
[46:47] reality of a life on the inside that has
[46:50] changed in from creatures of this world
[46:52] to deity and flesh amen the real
[46:58] Pentecostal born-again amen and that's
[47:00] what it will take to overcome Laodicea
[47:02] that's what it'll take for the bride to
[47:04] take her position is the kind of power
[47:06] Amen that Peter had that that Paul had
[47:09] the life that makes the demons tremble
[47:12] amen oh my we begin to when you begin to
[47:16] study that early church and brother
[47:18] Brown said that spirits never die and
[47:20] you can take the spirit that's in you
[47:21] and you can compare it to what God did
[47:23] in Jesus day amen and you find your
[47:26] identification in their spirit amen and
[47:29] if we are nothing more as message
[47:31] believers than a bunch of quote quoters
[47:33] and a bunch of holy livers
[47:35] and a bunch of dress writers amen and a
[47:37] bunch of tradition keepers amen then we
[47:40] are nothing more than a bunch of
[47:41] Pharisees hallelujah but the true church
[47:43] of chav of God will always be found
[47:46] under the zeal and the power and the
[47:49] reality of the Pentecostal experience
[47:52] hallelujah under that reproach glory to
[47:55] God I will continue brother sister to
[47:57] preach and promote the baptism of the
[47:59] Holy Ghost until the coming of the Lord
[48:01] I know there's false teachers that want
[48:03] to put it back amen in some bygone day
[48:06] but it is still the prescription today
[48:08] it is the only thing that can take this
[48:10] fall in human nature
[48:12] amen and transform it into the kingdom
[48:14] of God it cannot be rehabilitated it
[48:16] cannot be learned it cannot be educated
[48:19] it's got to be killed a menace stripped
[48:21] away it's got to die daily so that the
[48:24] power of God the life of God on the
[48:26] inside can come forth a man hallelujah
[48:29] oh my the Holy Ghost produces manifested
[48:35] sons of God amen dead religion is only
[48:38] ever going to produce a bunch of
[48:39] Pharisees hey man there's a lot of
[48:42] people on this world that have
[48:43] bitterness against religion Amen they're
[48:45] there they're mad about religion mad at
[48:48] Christians and you can't even blame them
[48:49] amen because we're hiding a bunch of
[48:51] fallen nature behind our religious veil
[48:53] amen and it is no substitute for a new
[48:56] birth you must be born again
[48:58] hey man Oh hallelujah brother branham
[49:01] used the reves the type of Balaam and
[49:03] and Moses the false church and the true
[49:06] church amen and we find out that there's
[49:08] many people that can preach the Bible
[49:10] right they've got the right doctrine
[49:11] they've got the right understanding but
[49:13] they're missing that life amen and it's
[49:15] so close a man till it would deceive the
[49:17] very elect hallelujah and they had a
[49:19] Christ period that's deceptive it's not
[49:22] a pope on a throne Amen it's not some
[49:24] fanaticism it is a spirit that will come
[49:26] into a message Church and tell you
[49:28] because you're sitting in the right pew
[49:30] and hearing the right preaching and
[49:31] quoting the right quotes that
[49:33] everything's okay with you amen
[49:34] and you don't need a real experience you
[49:36] don't need to go to an altar a man that
[49:38] that's a for a bygone day Oh far from it
[49:40] brother Bob said we find that Moab was
[49:43] an it was an illegitimate Amen but it
[49:45] was just as fundamental as Israel was
[49:48] but Israel who had the true bloodline
[49:52] amen and my title this morning is it's
[49:55] in your blood it's in your blood
[49:58] but Israel who had the true bloodline
[50:00] had signs and wonders following them
[50:02] they had divine healing they had the
[50:04] shout of the King in the camp they had a
[50:06] smitten rock for their salvation
[50:08] they had a heavenly father feeding them
[50:10] from above they were having a glorious
[50:12] time amen and that's why many times you
[50:15] go to a Holy Ghost meeting and you hear
[50:17] people just whooping and hollering and
[50:20] carrying on and you wonder what it's
[50:21] what what's going on and you wonder what
[50:23] the reason is it's because it's because
[50:26] there's something in their blood amen
[50:28] there's something in that bloodline of
[50:30] legitimacy amen it's a reality to them
[50:33] it's not some old tradition or some
[50:35] dusty old doctrine or something that
[50:37] makes us a slightly better Church than
[50:38] the Pentecostals amen but it's a life on
[50:41] the inside and oh it's glorious hey man
[50:43] if we don't go by emotion but we have a
[50:46] lot of emotion Amen because we have so
[50:48] much reality and we have so much
[50:50] revelation amen oh I can't understand
[50:53] how somebody could know what we know and
[50:55] see what we see and just sit there with
[50:58] nothing in their heart to respond amen
[51:00] when every word of God that comes off
[51:02] the page just blows me up on the inside
[51:05] I cannot contain it friends amen there
[51:08] is something glorious about it amen
[51:11] because there's something on the inside
[51:13] of me that bears witness that I belong
[51:15] to this bloodline that this thread of
[51:17] redemption a man is running through my
[51:19] veins spiritually amen and I'm a part of
[51:22] it
[51:22] hallelujah oh brother Graham said they
[51:25] got the same altar the same God but one
[51:27] was wrong and one was right and the way
[51:29] that you tell which one is right and
[51:31] which one was wrong brother sister amen
[51:33] it's not about fundamentals it's not
[51:35] about preaching the right things
[51:36] teaching the right things because
[51:37] brother Bram said when it came
[51:38] fundamentally to the word both of them
[51:40] were right but one his motives were
[51:43] wrong he was trying to cut his his
[51:47] brother off from the line of promise
[51:50] that God had given him that's how you
[51:52] always tell the true church from the
[51:55] false vine is because you'll never take
[51:57] a true believer
[51:58] and take away the promise of God he'll
[52:01] never he'll never surrender he'll never
[52:03] compromise he'll never know never budge
[52:05] on one thing that God has given him amen
[52:08] and today
[52:09] the promise is still true that there's a
[52:11] Holy Ghost that is promised to you and
[52:14] your children and as many as our fathers
[52:16] God shall call it is still the truth
[52:18] brother sister I don't care how many
[52:20] preachers try to take it from you try to
[52:23] stamp it out try to quench the fire amen
[52:26] it is for the believer and every true
[52:28] believer will not compromise with that
[52:30] religious formal starchy spirit amen
[52:35] but we want the supernatural amen we
[52:38] want that pillar of fire that made the
[52:40] difference between Israel amoeba Oh a
[52:43] real God who heals and speaks and saves
[52:46] and delivers amen hallelujah oh another
[52:51] thing the prophet of Balaam was
[52:52] fundamental but the prophet Moses was
[52:54] identified by the characteristic of God
[52:56] not by doctrine but by characteristics
[52:59] by a nature hey man there was the pillar
[53:02] of fire supernatural light hanging over
[53:04] them there were great healings in their
[53:06] camp a supernatural God showing
[53:09] supernatural signs and they were staying
[53:11] exactly what the word a promise that God
[53:13] gave Abraham
[53:14] omi I exhort you brother sister this
[53:17] morning don't budge on God's promise
[53:19] amen
[53:20] don't get complacent don't get lazy and
[53:22] this layout of seeing confusion amen but
[53:24] hold fast
[53:25] amen to that to the power of this
[53:28] message Amen at all and believe in that
[53:31] pillar of fire believe that it comes to
[53:34] church on Sunday morning
[53:37] amen and he touch his broken hearts
[53:39] hallelujah he's the same yesterday today
[53:41] and forever his word never changed but
[53:44] people change churches change
[53:45] expectations change but God is just as
[53:48] powerful to save now as he ever was Oh
[53:51] glory to God amen hallelujah you're too
[53:54] late to tell me that God doesn't move
[53:56] anymore in Holy Ghost meetings hey man I
[53:59] heard the man
[54:00] say unfortunately oh why do people send
[54:02] their youth down a youth camps you know
[54:04] and get them all emotional and worked up
[54:06] and that doesn't do anything for them
[54:08] you're too late to tell me that wait a
[54:10] minute it was a Holy Ghost meeting at a
[54:12] youth camp where God called me to preach
[54:14] it was a holy goal few youths meeting a
[54:16] man where God filled me with the Holy
[54:19] Ghost
[54:19] it was the Holy Ghost meeting when he
[54:21] delivered me from fear it was a Holy
[54:23] Ghost meeting when he's touched my life
[54:25] time after time after time that is able
[54:31] to change your life hallelujah to
[54:34] reality anybody who's ever experienced
[54:37] you can't take it away from them you
[54:39] can't talk them out of it nobody ever
[54:40] talked to me do it in the first place
[54:42] but it's the reality of a genuine
[54:44] experience with God something you can
[54:47] hold to something that will hold you
[54:48] when you can't hold yourself absolutely
[54:51] I know what I'm talking about this
[54:52] morning don't ever let anyone take away
[54:54] the promise from you the Holy Ghost what
[54:57] is it what is the Holy Ghost given for
[54:59] the Bible says that we are given all
[55:01] these great and precious promises we're
[55:03] supposed to cling to amen and of being
[55:06] these promises we have been made
[55:08] partakers of the divine nature of the
[55:13] divine nature so a born-again Son of God
[55:16] not just an emotional church member not
[55:19] just a screamer or a shouter or a dancer
[55:22] but they have been born into a bloodline
[55:25] amen amen
[55:26] that comes with attributes of a nature
[55:28] that is not of the earth but it is the
[55:31] nature of our Father in heaven
[55:33] hallelujah we are the sons and daughters
[55:35] of God the offspring of Jehovah
[55:38] partakers of the divine nature and that
[55:41] promises to you if you can believe it
[55:43] oh and that old sinful nature has
[55:46] perished forever if you've been born
[55:49] again that old guy that you were born
[55:51] with and you've drug him around and he's
[55:53] been a problem for you and tormented you
[55:56] a man he died hallelujah Amen hole can
[56:02] you just imagine friends maybe you got a
[56:04] temper maybe that maybe you got certain
[56:06] attributes in your flesh and you know
[56:07] how bro grams spoke of that cycle
[56:09] generation after generation how those
[56:11] things are handed down through the
[56:12] bloodline maybe you got a temper and you
[56:14] thought it was just you but come to find
[56:16] out your daddy had a temper and your
[56:18] granddaddy was a murderer and and all
[56:20] the way up the bloodline of back
[56:22] generation after generation of Rage and
[56:24] murder and temper and anger until it hit
[56:28] you brother sister hey man until it
[56:31] struck that Holy Ghost and and there's
[56:33] enough power in the baptism of the Holy
[56:36] Ghost that those things which have been
[56:38] soaked that law of the of the human
[56:41] bloodline that has been strong enough to
[56:42] hold true all the way back to Adam down
[56:45] to you but what the Holy Ghost is broken
[56:49] broke the cycle that's the power of the
[56:53] blood amen when you get this blood
[56:56] transfusion amen it forces out all human
[57:00] nature all human weakness all those
[57:03] things pass away and spiritually you've
[57:05] been grafted in to the lineage of God
[57:08] amen and the things Amen that the things
[57:12] that used to rule you rule you no more
[57:14] because you're no longer associated even
[57:16] with that name or that life Amen I know
[57:19] this flesh will rear its ugly head
[57:21] that's not what we're talking about
[57:22] today amen we're talking about your soul
[57:24] amen belongs to God there is a life on
[57:28] the inside that is more powerful friends
[57:31] amen more powerful than the law of this
[57:33] flesh glory to God even though it
[57:36] torments us but it cannot rule us Satan
[57:39] cannot have us we're not subject to it
[57:43] and the reason we don't have the victory
[57:45] many times is because we don't realize
[57:47] it and believe it not because it's not
[57:49] true but because we don't realize who we
[57:51] are Amen hallelujah the blood the bulls
[57:55] and goats could never atone for you
[57:56] could never break the power of that
[57:59] bloodline what do we have a kinsman
[58:00] three men a kinsman redeemer and the
[58:03] blood of that kinsman had a power in it
[58:06] oh my to to prove that you are his
[58:09] family to prove it he was the firstborn
[58:11] among many brethren amen hallelujah and
[58:15] there was the beginning of a new
[58:16] creation in God hallelujah amen oh you
[58:22] just think of that old name that you
[58:25] were born with
[58:26] hey man it's some of you young people
[58:27] carrying shame and carrying guilt and
[58:31] under such a burdened day today feeling
[58:34] bad about yourself and and feeling weak
[58:36] and feeling overcome and not realizing
[58:39] when God baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[58:41] that that old name and that old nature
[58:44] passed away forever and you're no longer
[58:47] known by that name and God doesn't see
[58:50] you by that name but you are known by
[58:52] the name of Jesus Christ because when
[58:54] you are born again you are married to
[58:57] Christ and call by his name and so when
[59:00] the devil comes around with a delivery
[59:02] of guilt or the delivery of sickness or
[59:05] delivery of bondage you can say return
[59:08] to sender hey that guy doesn't live here
[59:10] anymore
[59:12] but the person that's living here is
[59:14] known by a new name lorry to God we are
[59:17] identified in Christ Road Ram said not
[59:22] even sin is imputed to a genuine
[59:24] believer oh my one of these days we
[59:28] ought to believe this one of these days
[59:30] we got to get around to taking God at
[59:32] His Word when a prophet said Amen that
[59:35] he that born of God does not commit sin
[59:37] the worshiper once purged has no more
[59:40] conscience of sin see you don't desire
[59:42] it Amen now to the world you might be a
[59:45] sinner but to God you're not we need the
[1:00:03] Holy Ghost we need the moving of the
[1:00:05] Spirit amen because that's what God is
[1:00:08] looking at not you or I are mistakes or
[1:00:11] our failures or all the things that were
[1:00:13] attached to that old name that thing's
[1:00:15] dead to God amen and you're living in
[1:00:18] Christ crucified in Christ and now it's
[1:00:20] not you doing the works but Christ
[1:00:23] liveth in you glory to God Oh Church Oh
[1:00:27] bride know your position amen I believe
[1:00:30] that that what that's what's holding
[1:00:32] everything back brother band said when
[1:00:34] the bride realizes who she is then the
[1:00:37] rapture can go and we're just about
[1:00:39] there brother sister the only thing
[1:00:41] lacking is for you and I to wake up and
[1:00:43] then realize who we are realize what the
[1:00:46] word is spoken about us and believe God
[1:00:48] for his word amen
[1:00:51] he has not called you sinful he has not
[1:00:53] called you weak he has not called you
[1:00:55] the disgraceful or ashamed but he has
[1:00:58] called you wholly accepted beloved Amen
[1:01:02] you are the bride of Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:05] you are in Christ brother Graham said
[1:01:07] when Jesus went to the cross he went
[1:01:09] there with you in him amen if there ever
[1:01:11] was a Eve inside of Adam then there was
[1:01:14] a bride inside of Jesus Christ and when
[1:01:16] he died you're so identified with him by
[1:01:19] the new birth that when he died
[1:01:20] died with him a manner when he rose you
[1:01:23] rose with him in victory and the power
[1:01:25] of sin was broken in him for you and for
[1:01:28] me and for everything that we have need
[1:01:30] of glory to God God had never separated
[1:01:34] the bride from the groom yet so when God
[1:01:36] looked down upon the body of Christ he
[1:01:38] saw both male and female and it was all
[1:01:41] redeemed in that one body a man you see
[1:01:45] they are one the same word brethren said
[1:01:48] the same word that speaks of the groom
[1:01:52] speaks of the bride
[1:01:54] can you imagine friends you are so one
[1:01:57] with Christ that the very word of this
[1:02:00] Bible that speaks of Jesus Christ speaks
[1:02:02] also of you you have a right to it you
[1:02:07] are an instrument of it it speaks of you
[1:02:10] Alleluia the true Church of Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] the bride he said her righteousness is
[1:02:15] his righteousness her attributes are his
[1:02:18] glorious attributes her identity is
[1:02:20] found in him what he is she is to
[1:02:23] reflect what he has she is to manifest
[1:02:26] there is no fault in her but she is all
[1:02:31] glorious within and without from
[1:02:34] beginning to end she is the work of her
[1:02:36] Lord and all his works are perfect
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:42] hallelujah in fact in her is summed up
[1:02:45] and manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:02:47] purpose of God amen this is not
[1:02:50] something brother sister that's out of
[1:02:52] reach this is not some presumptuous
[1:02:54] thing I know to the denominations it's a
[1:02:56] bunch of heresy amen it was just like
[1:02:58] when Jesus said I and my father are one
[1:03:00] they couldn't take it
[1:03:01] amen but the bride the true believer
[1:03:03] amen has a little bit of ambition about
[1:03:05] her to believe what God said about her
[1:03:07] hey man I know it seems so high but it's
[1:03:09] not high because it's the very purpose
[1:03:11] and the very wisdom and the very desire
[1:03:13] of God's heart from the beginning before
[1:03:16] there was a world God in his hearts
[1:03:17] uttered words and and I would took a
[1:03:20] prophet to look in the back of God's
[1:03:21] mind and realize the
[1:03:23] we are dealing with a God who has
[1:03:25] desired a family of his own and there is
[1:03:27] no power there is no hell there is no
[1:03:30] brain that will keep him from acclaiming
[1:03:35] there will be a bride and she will
[1:03:38] manifest the very attributes of God it
[1:03:41] must come to pass for it is his will
[1:03:44] Oh hallelujah brother Graham said Oh God
[1:03:48] if the world could only see that that
[1:03:50] God and man are one hallelujah amen oh
[1:03:55] when and when when he came down from
[1:03:57] heaven said this is my beloved son and
[1:03:59] brother Brown said heaven and earth
[1:04:01] embraced God a man husband kiss but
[1:04:04] everything that was in Christ he has
[1:04:06] poured into the bride Alleluia
[1:04:09] oh my and we are in the embrace of a
[1:04:12] loving groom Amen who has who has who
[1:04:16] has attributed to us every word that was
[1:04:18] spoken of him amen hello all that God
[1:04:22] was he poured into Christ and all Christ
[1:04:24] was he poured into the church God and
[1:04:26] man together that was to be the super
[1:04:29] sign of the last days when the entire
[1:04:32] Bible was to be fulfilled in the last
[1:04:34] days hallelujah in the days of the
[1:04:37] bodies of the seventh angel the mystery
[1:04:39] of God the desire of God the purpose of
[1:04:43] God shall be revealed

[1:04:51] everywhere that speaks of great speech
[1:04:53] of you hallelujah with a glory
[1:04:57] hallelujah the same word spoke of the
[1:05:00] groom speaks of the bride we have the
[1:05:02] attributes of Christ amen or whether you
[1:05:06] believe it or not it's true amen whether
[1:05:08] you feel like you can accept it or not
[1:05:09] it's true it is the desire of God the
[1:05:12] purpose of God amen it's for you to
[1:05:15] accept don't listen to the devil and all
[1:05:18] the doubts that he's feeding you amen
[1:05:20] you are the children of God these things
[1:05:22] are not beyond you it's in your blood
[1:05:24] it's in your blood it's in the lights
[1:05:27] it's on the inside it's all in the Holy
[1:05:29] Ghost has nothing to do with you or your
[1:05:31] ability or who you think you are but
[1:05:33] it's where you came from
[1:05:34] it's who your daddy is Rory to God
[1:05:37] [Applause]
[1:05:49] oh yeah I want to share a little story
[1:05:55] with you it might not mean to you what
[1:05:57] it means to me but to me it was powerful
[1:05:59] you know you know I was talking to my
[1:06:01] dad one day and I got a good dad I hope
[1:06:03] you got a good day but I got one of
[1:06:05] those dads where you think man if I
[1:06:07] could ever be half the man he is I'll be
[1:06:09] happy but it just seems impossible he's
[1:06:12] such a he's such a fine man you know and
[1:06:14] I admire him so much and one day I'm
[1:06:16] talking to my dad and you know I was
[1:06:18] feeling is just so bad about myself over
[1:06:20] some things just something not sinful
[1:06:22] things but just things in my nature and
[1:06:24] things of my character that bothered me
[1:06:26] you know just procrastination and
[1:06:28] trouble focusing you know those little
[1:06:31] things that just bother you and I'm just
[1:06:33] complaining my dad and I almost didn't
[1:06:35] tell him you know because I you know I
[1:06:37] look up to him so much I wanted to be
[1:06:38] proud of me I almost didn't say anything
[1:06:40] but I said dad you know I'm feeling this
[1:06:42] way I'm feeling that way I'm always
[1:06:43] dealing with this I think and you know
[1:06:47] what he said to me
[1:06:48] and like I said it might not mean to you
[1:06:51] what it means to me
[1:06:52] he said son I've always felt the same
[1:06:55] way
[1:06:56] [Applause]
[1:06:58] amen it's something kind of woke up on
[1:07:01] the inside and I said you know this
[1:07:02] didn't who I am that didn't come from
[1:07:04] nowhere it didn't come from no place but
[1:07:07] I came from somebody any men and if
[1:07:09] there's attributes in him that I admire
[1:07:11] a man then I got to believe that I can
[1:07:13] be like him because I'm my daddy son
[1:07:20] oh my that's why i speaking not robbery
[1:07:23] to call myself married to Christ
[1:07:26] hey because I know where it came from
[1:07:28] and the voice on the inside tells me
[1:07:31] whose son I am so I have to believe that
[1:07:34] if I let these attributes have their way
[1:07:36] amen
[1:07:38] it will result in a manifested son glory
[1:07:41] to God oh don't you love him amen and
[1:07:45] you find that these characteristics they
[1:07:47] don't come by working harder and trying
[1:07:49] more and striving in a greater way amen
[1:07:52] but you know when you well you're the
[1:07:54] most yourself when you are at peace when
[1:07:57] you begin to rest you know whenever I'm
[1:07:59] concentrating or thinking about
[1:08:01] something I'm little off lost in space
[1:08:03] somewhere lost in thought wow I start
[1:08:05] biting my nails and you guys do that you
[1:08:09] start biting your nails well and
[1:08:11] somebody say just stop doing that I
[1:08:13] would why don't you just quit biting
[1:08:15] your nails and but I don't realize I'm
[1:08:17] doing it I can't stop because you know
[1:08:20] it's when I shut off my mind when I shut
[1:08:24] off my thoughts and when I just go to
[1:08:26] rest and who I am there's a nature on
[1:08:29] the inside that just gets the Viton amen
[1:08:31] and I believe when a son or daughter of
[1:08:33] God begins to stop worrying stop
[1:08:35] fretting stop trying so hard stop trying
[1:08:39] to make themselves something they aren't
[1:08:40] and just rest on that Holy Ghost nature
[1:08:42] on the inside I believe if we would list
[1:08:44] more we could manifest more Amen I
[1:08:47] believe we just relaxed in his presence
[1:08:48] more those attributes would be
[1:08:50] manifested in a greater way I know it's
[1:08:52] simple friends but it's the truth
[1:08:53] we tried too hard we worked too hard
[1:08:56] we've got to trust in the life that's in
[1:08:58] us hallelujah amen everything that
[1:09:02] speaks of the groom speaks of the bride
[1:09:04] just think of the power of that friends
[1:09:07] that everything them in the Bible every
[1:09:10] precious saying every word of power that
[1:09:12] was spoken of Christ amen by a prophets
[1:09:15] message it's been given to you it's
[1:09:18] attributed to you you're of the same
[1:09:20] life amen so why don't we just talk
[1:09:22] about his attributes for a little while
[1:09:24] why don't we just fellowship it around
[1:09:26] you know one of the attributes of Christ
[1:09:28] is he
[1:09:29] holy amen amen just to think what a holy
[1:09:33] God that we serve and I believe a true
[1:09:35] holy life is not from trying to follow a
[1:09:37] tradition but it's from a revelation of
[1:09:40] how holy he is and that he has chosen to
[1:09:43] be present in us amen and that makes you
[1:09:45] a holy temple not because of the of the
[1:09:47] substance of this earth but because of a
[1:09:49] holy God on the inside he's so holy a
[1:09:52] man you know that he's holy you felt his
[1:09:54] presence and come before his throne many
[1:09:56] times in such a way where it's beyond
[1:09:59] the worship beyond the praise you get to
[1:10:01] where brother Branham said when he came
[1:10:02] into the presence of the Lord he said it
[1:10:04] and never gift he said it's happened
[1:10:05] since I was a little boy and I've never
[1:10:06] gotten used to it amen oh and that holy
[1:10:09] presence prophets fainted Amen they
[1:10:12] passed how they shriveled in fear in the
[1:10:15] holy presence of God amen but by a
[1:10:17] message we come to find out that that
[1:10:19] attribute of holiness is an attribute of
[1:10:22] this bride it's a powerful holiness for
[1:10:24] he hath made him to be sin for us who
[1:10:27] knew no sin that we might be made the
[1:10:30] righteousness of God in him amen
[1:10:34] accepted friends he became sin that we
[1:10:38] might become his righteousness and so we
[1:10:40] are not a filthy people we have nothing
[1:10:42] to be ashamed of we are as holy as he is
[1:10:45] holy Road ran said you are the pure
[1:10:48] virtuous sinless bride of a son of the
[1:10:51] Living God every man and woman that's
[1:10:54] born of the Spirit of God and washed in
[1:10:55] his blood and believes every word of God
[1:10:57] stands as though you never did it in the
[1:11:00] first place
[1:11:00] this is not forgiveness this is
[1:11:03] justification this is redemption this is
[1:11:06] a total restoration hallelujah you are
[1:11:09] not attributed to your sin and your past
[1:11:12] and your mistakes and your failures you
[1:11:14] are attributed to the holiness of God
[1:11:16] not because you deserve it because you
[1:11:19] are identified in here
[1:11:22] oh we got to take hold of it a man we
[1:11:25] don't see that sinless perfection in the
[1:11:27] flesh like he had but it come to find
[1:11:29] out that the sinless perfection that was
[1:11:31] in him is identified in us by the
[1:11:34] baptism of the Holy Ghost we are all by
[1:11:37] being a son or daughter of God we are
[1:11:38] justified never did it in the first
[1:11:40] place we are holy as he is holy without
[1:11:43] spot without wrinkle that's not for the
[1:11:46] future time that's not for that's not
[1:11:48] for heaven that well now we are in
[1:11:50] heavenly places and the way of God looks
[1:11:53] at you now is not through the filter of
[1:11:55] your faults or your sins or one spot
[1:11:58] Amen but you are unblemished in His
[1:12:01] sight and he has called you accepted in
[1:12:03] the beloved I know you didn't feel that
[1:12:06] way when you showed up to church this
[1:12:07] morning but it was true then it was true
[1:12:10] when you were down it was true why you
[1:12:11] were discouraged you were beating
[1:12:13] yourself up and the whole time what I'm
[1:12:15] telling you was true it will never stop
[1:12:18] being true a man any more than you could
[1:12:20] stop being your father's son or your
[1:12:22] father's daughter but because of who you
[1:12:24] are and where you come from and the life
[1:12:26] that's on the inside of you God can only
[1:12:28] see you as perfect hallelujah part of
[1:12:33] him a part of my savior a part of his
[1:12:36] word you know with another attribute of
[1:12:38] Christ he is eternal
[1:12:41] he is eternal remember everything that's
[1:12:44] spoken of him spoken of you and he is
[1:12:46] eternal he never had a beginning he
[1:12:49] never had an end the Bible said Jesus

[1:12:53] forever oh the Bible says this
[1:12:57] Melchizedek without father without
[1:13:00] mother I'm talking about you now without
[1:13:02] descent having neither beginning of days
[1:13:05] nor end of life but made like unto the
[1:13:08] Son of God and a bite of a priest
[1:13:10] continually hallelujah amen that's what
[1:13:14] a prophet came to tell you he came to
[1:13:16] preach who is this Melchizedek and show
[1:13:18] you that in an eternal God was an
[1:13:20] eternal seed that never had a beginning

[1:13:28] there was a moon stars were a molecule
[1:13:31] you are sons and daughters of God for
[1:13:35] you are only the physical manifestation
[1:13:38] of the attributes that were in God at
[1:13:40] the beginning before there was a devil
[1:13:44] before there was sin before there was
[1:13:47] weakness before there was pain there was
[1:13:50] a bride there were sons and daughters of
[1:13:52] God shouting for joy waiting to be
[1:13:55] manifested amen I don't mean to presume
[1:13:58] this morning but I was just imagining

[1:15:41] are no more we shall be glorified in him
[1:15:44] we shall be part of him we always were
[1:15:46] part of him Amen come to find out by
[1:15:48] this message I'm not the son of Brian
[1:15:50] Lucille Eriksen but I come from a long
[1:15:52] line of God and you come from the same
[1:15:54] lineage Alleluia
[1:15:56] that's where we come from that's where
[1:15:58] we're going that's who we are
[1:16:00] we got certain attributes certain
[1:16:02] characteristics that are not of this
[1:16:04] earth they are not of this natural world
[1:16:06] but another attribute of Christ he is
[1:16:08] supernatural and if he is supernatural
[1:16:11] so are his brethren amen saw his
[1:16:14] joint-heirs if he is supernatural you
[1:16:16] are supernatural amen hallelujah I know
[1:16:19] we make these things rare and uncommon
[1:16:21] but that's on us amen but but the thing
[1:16:24] is and come to find out it's in our
[1:16:25] blood to be supernatural to see the
[1:16:27] supernatural Bible said the thing that
[1:16:30] Jesus did all the things which aren't
[1:16:33] even written if they should be written
[1:16:34] the world itself could not contain the
[1:16:36] books that would be written behind Jesus
[1:16:39] Christ and he's the one who said you
[1:16:41] would do the greater works hallelujah
[1:16:44] amen you get quiet like you're wondering
[1:16:47] about it amen but you can wonder all you
[1:16:50] want to it's true and then it's the
[1:16:52] truth amen it's what the that's what a
[1:16:55] prophet taught us amen it's what a
[1:16:57] message came to reveal to us amen and we
[1:16:59] make these things on common we make them
[1:17:01] unattainable but I'll tell you what a
[1:17:03] prophet said he said if you've got the
[1:17:04] Holy Spirit what is the qualification
[1:17:06] what is the what is the the restriction
[1:17:09] he said if you have the Holy Spirit then
[1:17:12] you are a candidate for Association
[1:17:14] with the unseen world and the
[1:17:16] supernatural amen you don't have to be a
[1:17:18] prophet you don't have to be a
[1:17:19] soothsayer Amen you don't have to be a
[1:17:21] minister but if you have the Holy Spirit
[1:17:24] amen
[1:17:24] if you've been born again into this
[1:17:26] bloodline then you are a candidate for
[1:17:28] the unseen world and the supernatural
[1:17:30] because it has nothing to do with the
[1:17:32] natural amen but it has to do with a
[1:17:34] supernatural life that's in you hey man
[1:17:36] he said no wonder people can't believe
[1:17:38] in those things they've never come into
[1:17:39] contact they have nothing to believe
[1:17:41] with but that doesn't describe you amen
[1:17:44] you've got Christ the believer in you
[1:17:45] amen and you've got all the faith that
[1:17:47] you need to overcome the devil amen
[1:17:49] people say well I wish I had more faith
[1:17:51] I wish I had stronger faith if I had
[1:17:53] strong faith if I had faith and you know
[1:17:55] I could really do something for the Lord
[1:17:56] amen but just the act of saying that
[1:17:59] proves that you're believing somebody
[1:18:00] amen the problem is you're putting your
[1:18:02] faith in the devil and the very faith
[1:18:04] you're putting in the devil to speak
[1:18:06] words of doubt is all the faith you need
[1:18:08] you just got to put it in the in the in
[1:18:10] the Word of God amen and that faith will
[1:18:13] become omnipotent hallelujah
[1:18:16] it will change your circumstances when
[1:18:18] you begin to believe God's Word for you
[1:18:20] you are supernatural people hallelujah
[1:18:24] brother Graham said there's got to come
[1:18:25] a church again where the barriers will
[1:18:27] be broke and the Holy Ghost level right
[1:18:29] away amongst the people and when you do
[1:18:32] you will see the same signs and wonders
[1:18:35] that happen back there in them days say
[1:18:37] men a man when a prophet said that it
[1:18:39] was enough for me not to put the gifts
[1:18:42] back on the shelf not to put signs and
[1:18:44] wonders back in another day I believe
[1:18:45] the gifts are for the bride hallelujah
[1:18:48] amen and the but the problem is I know
[1:18:51] the reason we not seeing it is exactly
[1:18:54] what he just said we've got to let the
[1:18:56] Holy Ghost have the right away not our
[1:18:58] church order not our opinion not our
[1:19:01] idea our comfort zone but let the Holy
[1:19:03] Ghost lead the church and if we
[1:19:05] surrender to that life and that power
[1:19:07] then we would see the supernatural we
[1:19:10] would expect the supernatural it would
[1:19:12] become more common amongst us if we
[1:19:14] would if we would take our eyes off
[1:19:15] everything else
[1:19:16] amen and just look to Jesus look to his
[1:19:19] word hallelujah let the Holy Ghost have
[1:19:22] the
[1:19:22] by the way I cannot understand why
[1:19:24] people educated by this message would
[1:19:27] want to stomp out the moving of the
[1:19:28] spirit and somebody get a little excited
[1:19:30] and you try to tamp him down say now

[1:19:40] away in the church he wants to have the
[1:19:43] preeminence and when a preeminent God
[1:19:45] becomes preeminent in his bride Amen
[1:19:48] then the government will come down upon
[1:19:50] his shoulders and we would see the
[1:19:52] supernatural works same signs same
[1:19:56] wonders same same supernatural the same
[1:20:00] sensation that's a direct quote
[1:20:04] hallelujah wasn't it supernatural when
[1:20:07] he changed your nature if you out of oh
[1:20:09] my anybody who's ever had a nature
[1:20:10] change ought to believe in a miracle a
[1:20:12] minute to think about how it never
[1:20:14] ceases to amaze me how God can take
[1:20:16] somebody amen and Alcoholics Anonymous

[1:20:27] years and he's one drink away from sin

[1:20:37] the world from it and turn it into a son
[1:20:39] or daughter of God what a miracle amen

[1:35:26] looking for him amen young man young
[1:35:29] women you're no different than any of
[1:35:32] those apostles when Jesus came their way
[1:35:34] and they didn't think anything special
[1:35:36] about themselves they didn't think there
[1:35:37] were anything exceptional anything great
[1:35:39] amen but when he came said follow me
[1:35:42] there must have been something about it
[1:35:45] when they took a step amen
[1:35:47] into that discipleship took a step into
[1:35:50] the footsteps of Christ it must have
[1:35:52] felt right it must have just there must
[1:35:55] have been something on the inside just
[1:35:56] echoing saying this is where I belong
[1:35:58] this is you know there's something about
[1:36:00] what brother Nathan is preaching it so
[1:36:02] it's so it's too marvelous to imagine
[1:36:05] that that the words that are spoken of
[1:36:07] Christ would speak of me but something
[1:36:09] feels right something feels correct
[1:36:12] something my heart's bearing witness
[1:36:13] that's nothing less than the then the
[1:36:16] spirit of son same in the spirit of
[1:36:17] adoption within you crying out for your
[1:36:19] father saying Lord I'm nothing I have no
[1:36:23] ability I have nothing to offer but I
[1:36:24] believe your word Lord and let that life
[1:36:27] on the inside oh let's make it our
[1:36:28] prayer Lord let that life on the inside
[1:36:31] come forth Oh God and may it
[1:36:34] ride all human nature all human ability
[1:36:36] all human fear and worry and attributes
[1:36:39] Lord and let the attributes of Christ
[1:36:41] that you've ordained before the
[1:36:43] foundation of the world be revealed in
[1:36:45] this vessel Lord I feel almost too
[1:36:48] humble to ask for it Lord but but yet
[1:36:51] your word has promised it you have
[1:36:53] desired it it has been your purpose and
[1:36:55] your wisdom before the foundation of the
[1:36:56] world Lord let us walk in it let us walk
[1:37:00] in the reality of who we are granted
[1:37:04] Lord Jesus I'm not on any ego trip I'm
[1:37:11] nothing on my own I make mistakes and
[1:37:18] often slip I'm only flesh and bone but
[1:37:24] I'll prove someday
