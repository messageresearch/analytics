you move Lord I pray for those that are gathered here tonight Lord that maybe they aren't feeling well in their body more than someway I ask God that you'll touch him as you touch each and every heart Lord spiritual you know our needs tonight not they would be drawn to you I pray Jesus precious amen amen it's good to be in the house of the Lord so thank the Lord for His mercy tonight I want to go in the scriptures if we could let's start with Exodus 15 once again I only want to just read two verses of Scripture from there verse 25 and verse 26 and then we'll let you have your seats in exodus verse 25 there it says and he cried unto the Lord and the Lord showed him a tree which he had cast into the waters the waters were made sweet and there he made for them a statue and an ordinance and there he proved them and said if thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God and will do that which is right in his sight and will give ear to His commandments and keep all his statutes I will put none of these diseases upon thee which I have brought upon the Egyptians I am the lord that he V amen thank god bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated I'd like to look a little bit more tonight on that thought the Lord that he Lavie when we look at this and for some time months quite almost about a year ago and just you know looking at these things and many times that we we minister upon healing it's always present within every part in every aspect of the gospel and yet sometimes we we understand that how God in ministering to our needs and where we're at God would speak so specifically to help you and I and even in our approach of things brother Branham would would mention it when we look at many of the messages on healing that brother Branham would minister some of them you know you'll find were and will minister for maybe 24 minutes and then it goes on and on from there on messages that were just specific within healing and we know that within healing there's no way that you can actually deal with healing or minister or preach divine healing without actually administering and dealing with sin because sickness itself is is a substance of death and death itself has set in remember in the very beginning when God had given the word to the first family and first couple in Eden he said the day you eat thereof that day you shall die yet we realized when they when they when they had eaten and taken of that of the tree of knowledge of good and evil we recognized that that was another being that was their spiritual being that was Satan who was present there and death itself had set in before it ever death made its effect known in the body death set in in the soul when Eve herself when she took in that of a lie against God's Word and it moved there from her mind and sweat down there into her soul and then the actual act followed and within we find the pronouncing of the judgment upon that to where that death itself death already come to that of the soul there had been a separating from the presence of Almighty God and then we find that how that death itself would set in so much to where that God would say that that you know the ground is cursed and he would God would speak that you know from dust I'll came and dust thou shalt return and I don't want to speak on death tonight but yet to the believer we realize that even within time and how time goes and sometimes you know you've seen loved ones or you've seen different ones that have have suffered and I think of how that you know I remember even when a you know brother Paul we had been eunuch a ting and even from where brother Paul of Fontaine's were where that he was looking at even upon his dad him brother Paul made this statement he said you know he said there's enough prayer that's growing up he said there is enough faith that is set forth that if it is the will of God to raise him up here in this life you'll be raised up but they're better requests and I believe it's the desire from our heart for everyone loved ones and different ones that when you see someone suffering no one likes to see anybody suffer and yet so I remember you know brother Paul's request I thought about it with with my own daddy that you know as much as he could have remain here in this life but I look even in my own daddy he was already suffering they said if you keep him here you'll be a vegetable there would be nothing that that could be done and you know one thing about it is in this lifetime we certainly miss that being able to greet somebody call him up talk to him or hear from him again but as a believer Paul would let us know that our sorrow is not as others but he says our sorrow ensure we are sorrowful we are sad but we realized that they have went ahead to the shore to the home that we soon are to be going to and whether we go by the way of the grave or or whether by way of the rapture it's a glorious reality to know that where our destiny is is laid within God it gives us a real rest it gives us a real peace in the Lord and when we look at this this reality that that is here you know brother Branham would talk about death he said you know death will back your back you into a corner here God get you out death will back you into a corner there God gets you out death will back you into a corner here Carl gets you out he said but eventually said death remember he said death can only pull you into the presence of Almighty God so even with what you know the last the last hole in the last straw though he could say like that that the enemy has but yet within it all his kingdom and everything has already been conquered by the mighty Conqueror amen there there is no defeat to that of a believer it's all victory and so when when we we look at these things we we realized that this was a part of the journey that Israel was on and there was that value that I believe when God would allow this situation to come about remember God he is speaking here that he said he allowed us to come about for a statute for an ordinance and to prove them you see God is wanting to give them a witness that of a statute that here as he goes on to say if you will hearken diligently to my voice that means carefully in antutu to look in upon that and to do what is right in my sight you see now look God is asking them that they would carefully and diligently take in of the word and in their heart their motives and objectives would be set right because remember that God looks on the heart what many of man and others can see and look at remember man sees the work of the faith that is resting in our heart and so all of that is covered in that verse of verse 26 of where that our hearts would be given to the Word of God what value there is to the Word of God what they forth in Eden now God is letting him know I have brought you out of the house of bondage and I am not brought you just to come to this wilderness and this is a place but I have a place prepared for you that I'm taking you to so along this journey there are things that will come up along the way to remind you that this is not your final resting place things will remind you that this is not your home things will remind you if you happen to get off a track a little bit I will release and allow the enemy to touch your body to line you back up in my will and we realize that all sickness that comes it is not all the chastening of the Lord we we understand that as believers that when sickness comes that there is times where sickness comes and there is nothing wrong with a walk and the life of a believer they're not out of step but they're right in step and but yet we understand this as believers that Satan cannot touch our life until he first gets permission from Almighty God I'll tell you what I'm grateful to be under the protection of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm glad that before the enemy can do anything he first has to get permission of the chief shepherd that's standing at the door and God will give him limitations that he can go to we see that within job remember he touched job's family he touched their of the family and he was certain I'll make him curse you to you to your face but then we find out that job didn't curse God as a matter of fact when the reports came in Joel chapter one job begin to worship the Lord it wasn't because of the circumstances but if he entered into worship the Lord and I that you can take what you want to think but I believe that Joel was a him might have been sorrowful no doubt with his spirit within his body but one thing job was thankful for got a revelation had come to his life and there had been a lamb that had been offered that though token the word had been applied to that home and that his children that they knew the Lord and the word joke had saved I can rest my my spirit is sorrowful but this one thing that I know I know that I shall meet him so even in the midst of our sorrow and despair there is still worship to Almighty God from the heart of the believer that's the loyalty of the heart that brother Branham talks about and three kinds of believers he said it's the loyalty of the heart that beats the material until it's ready to go into the mold God is so mindful of our needs he can't how that Satan you know would common he he's permitted to afflict our body while we're here on this journey but notice God would let them know there is the value for obedience to the Word of God where they walked away from obedience to the Word of God God lets them know right here in this that there are situations that's going to arise that are so bitter there are things that will take place and you know with healing here we could go and a lot of avenues not only physical healing but that even many times were it can be even in our emotions that we have been hurt or we have been injured brother Ram talked about in his own life but to realize that within it all God wouldn't let him see the value of obedience to the word so much so that he would let him know sickness will come but this one thing that I will say to you he said that with your obedience to the word I will put none of the diseases of Egypt upon you now I want you to think of the mercy of God when you read in Deuteronomy 28 also Deuteronomy 7 you'll realize that there are things that God placed within their diseases that was brought upon the Egypt such as leprosy leprosy would be that of where one who had rose up against the word we see the example with Uzziah Jews I rose up and he challenged the position and authority of the priesthood he was smitten with leprosy right there we recognized that even were Miriam herself you know she couldn't understand how could you know Moses be saying that and we should marry among you know and and not have any mixture and yet he marries one a Midian but yet God would let it know you cannot question even things that you yourself do not understand do not question and when she questioned leprosy she was smitten with leprosy remember what God had said it would have been better that your father spit in your face then you to speak against my prophet is that right so we find here leprosy came but notice the mercy of God the mercy of God it reached out to Miriam she had to remain outside of the camp but the mercy of God would bring healing to her body her life and bring her back into the camp think about that now when we look at this when we see these or conditions or diseases that God would bring upon people who have been disobedient to the Word of God and God would allow that he talked about the madness and other things like that think about those lepers in the days of the Lord Jesus think about those in the days of Elijah they had to have a promise to hang on to you see within everything you know it's like you and I you know even though we look at that diseases have come upon this earth and many times those diseases lack in Egypt our vials that have been poured out of temporary judgments like brother Brown will talk about the flu he said the influenza was a vial that was poured out when England rejected the gospel yet how many of us have ever had the flu but we have not had the flu because we rejected the gospel we have come in contact with the flu because we live in this pest house are you listening so we find that there are situations and things that will arise that from our hearts that we know that our hearts is following him in in line with the word of God we also know that with God and listen to me close these the burden of my heart with this in many different things to share this tonight because many times the way that the enemy will work when sickness comes and it's not just among young converts or new believers he worked sometimes of UNEP on the older believers and he work and want to bring something as though that there is something between you and God let me just tell you something you can take to the bank and cash it and go ahead and buy something and that is if there is anything between you and God God don't play games while don't hide nothing from you if there's something where the chastening is coming in your life it ain't guess God Himself will reveal it the mercy of God will reveal it so that that area can be lined up it won't be left up to you or me trying to drum up charges come on somebody so when we look at that that's one of the first things that we that we would look at in God's Word and to know that that to be the truth I wonder if you turn with me to Romans chapter 8 verse 10 you know it's return here to Romans 8 verse 10 Paul what's up Paul would write of this if and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the Spirit is life because of righteousness in if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that these sufferings notice plural the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us hallelujah hallelujah I just saw I need to keep going here for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who had subjected the same in hope remember God could not make us sin he placed us on free moral agency is that right so not willingly were we subjected to this but there because of the choice that was made verse 21 sent because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body now remember how Paul laid this out we've not received the spirit of bondage bondage is fear fear is slavish I have to do this if I don't do this I don't know if I'd be accepted at that that's slavish fear but we have received the spirit of adoption adoption is that of placement where we in ourselves come in to the right place or position or as brother Brennan would put it like that he says of where your name was wrote there he says here in your old book but he says your name has been transferred into that of the marriage bla book of that of the Lamb's Book of Life he didn't write your name in the Lamb's Book of Life it already was there and he was there there was a seed within you laying in representation to your name being in that part of the word and it's connected with the theophany that's on the other side the only thing that had to happen is the quickening power of God would come upon our hearts when there was oh my there was a desire to be delivered we were down in Egypt's bondage remember they went every day they made bricks every day but he got to a point God kept allowing the process of time to come home to where eventually their prayers changed it changed to a place to where the Bible says God had respect to their prayers because they begin to no longer pray make my life better they begin to pray Lord let the promise come to pass I want to get out of Egypt Lord I'm tired of living in this pondage under a taskmasters cast verse driving me to do things I don't to do I want to be delivered they were calling for a promise of God that belong to them and God heard their prayer and there just happened to be a man by the name of Moses it just happened to be you know no God had him there for a purpose because before they could ever be let out of Egypt God had to deliver Moses of Moses that's the first Exodus is to deliver Moses of Moses just like when he delivered Jacob Oh Jacob he let Israel out his arise they got to a spot in their prayer that they got tired of being in bondage and so notice has here within the life moving into our life it comes that of the spirit of adoption where the spirit of that land the spirit of Almighty God amen our Heavenly Father it moves down as he is searching for you and I moving on our heart you realize that before you and I could ever cry out and say father save me it was because there was already something there that could be stirred up by God to cry out save me hallelujah and the Spirit of God would move down like it did upon the prodigal son and said save me father and the same Holy Ghost that would send that unction there and move upon her life and that part on the inside would raise up and begin to respond remember when God is moving he has a leadership for our lives he does not move upon our lives to leave us in limbo he comes to lead us and God had a message that was for them that they might be into the Liberty that the soul was crying out for the wilderness was not their destination they were just passing through and God took him away that he wanted to take them but here they were they had been free from Egypt I want you to think of this for a moment they had been freed from the taskmasters but then how God led them the way that he led them he had come to the Red Sea but God has a purpose within it all because the enemy is going to try to take their life he's going to try to overtake them but God makes a way that through that of the Red Sea when it would be open that when Pharaoh would try to pass through that Red Sea he wouldn't be able to make it I don't care how strong they were I don't care thoroughbred their horses were they couldn't make it to room that of the Red Sea which is a type of that of the blood of Jesus Christ brother Branham would reach back and even pull it as a type of a shadow of Pentecost he said where when they were driven by under those taskmasters here but on the other side they had joy they had Liberty hey man is the same way that even as we look at the Red Sea the Red Sea is also a type of our deliverance that here we pass from this life into that life that of the rapture and even the tribulation Saints 144,000 it is all a reality of the victory where everyone has come through the blood even those in the tribulation that don't know his name but they come to know his name are you with me so we find that how that within this this great time of coming across there they were free they were free of that of Egypt and they were walking in this wilderness but yet there was a land that they were called to you realize that this what we just read in Romans a it is just the same parallel of the journey that Israel was on to think of it how that it would be written here in Romans 8 but here you and I are the body is dead Paul would write and call it the mortal body he would speak that there was a life within you and I before it was a life that was in direct contrast to the Word of God but God rich in His mercy would move down and God would change that nature he would kill that old man on the inside but he would leave us here in this body this body has Paul calling it a body of death a body at Ages a body that's susceptible to sicknesses all kinds of weaknesses and things but yet God in His mercy would move down in place within our hearts the spirit of adoption and the spirit of adoption in our hearts lets us know that I'm only here in the possession not my inheritance this is my possession not my inheritance but in the meantime while I'm looking for my inheritance I will take the earnest money of the downpayment and manifest the victory in this mortal body if I didn't have to preach I believe that run but the band said it like this and I read this one to you the last time we were together out of God of this evil age he said now go he's asking God that you would heal the sick and afflicted and he says now Lord I believe the second paragraph I have there now Lord but for the greatest of all healing if you heal their physical body from cancer TB pneumonia is something they'll get sick again no doubt if they live very long for their body you still under sin the curse but let the real divine healing the healing of soul which makes a new creature passes from death unto life and then waiting in this old Tabernacle for the redemption of the body after the soul has been redeemed I like that
