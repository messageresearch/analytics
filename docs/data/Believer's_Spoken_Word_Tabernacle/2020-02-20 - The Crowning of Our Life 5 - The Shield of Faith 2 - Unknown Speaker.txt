thank the church for those at the from Ileana we just want to say that you know just as you guys refer there's many many people even different religions everybody in the frame we were just hoping that the Lord were with healing and really what happened was they went to Cincinnati five times for trial clinical trials each time and they went the Boston one time they they were getting some treatment from the Cleveland Clinic here at the end but this last Wednesday they went to Cleveland Clinic I mean they went through Cincinnati and he went down there Wednesday they came back Thursday they were very very soberly on it and gave me with the bed my son called me at 12:30 big guy and by then the head her breathing she's doing seizures so then I took my guy home and and they took her to the main campus at that Friday morning the same day I went back to the Cleveland Clinic for doing ok that rusty very peaceful they were still doing tests so by the time I got home and maybe later we found out he had a massive stroke he was bleeding in the brain and the only thing they could do for her was upgrade on her brain and put a trait through and they went against it by then I already knew a little bit I told Samuel I wasn't for that either but they decided to do so then they called us all back up there Friday for three days it was very let's say very very far samuel was able to come up Friday and sit a small prayer there [Music] and the presence of the Lord came and we had some real hard time but we all said but sometimes my son would bring up videos of her and we laughed we you know we do it really happy thinking about the way she was and everything probably the saddest part that I've ever seen him behind seems sad things said here's Jamie was in the bed with her Jamie's in bed with her Jasper on one side Jamie at once this was Friday mostly Friday and they were just talking to her crying and he was just very sad very sad to see the love of a father in love and there's nothing that you could do one thing about those three days she has always done morphine's was always comfortable he had a few days breathing but at the end when she passed away Rachel the other side they were both in bed with her at the end passed away real quietly they were able to give her a bath when she was all said and done always really really good just continue to keep them in for Saturday and Sunday one thing that while this process was going on Maria would talk to me I asked her about these being apart she would always say that Jesus was dinner and one six days before they went to Cincinnati before she passed away I went over there and I felt her a little bit we're gonna pray and I prayed with her and then I said in the name of Jesus Christ and she goes amen and she smiled so I looked at her and I said she could hardly talk she could hardly talk just very weak I looked at her and I said I just love it when you say Amen and I love when you spot so you know we just got to keep them in prayer because he was just so hard it's heartbreaking to see what they went through and one more time father we just want to thank you for all that you've done we know that by grace and it's

this work we do so Stan help me sit down [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] it's word Amen aren't you grateful for every experience that the Lord has given you brought you through amen all those experiences come together and then our faith would be built God is preparing us all along in the stage of our journey it's one thing for somebody to tell you something but it's another thing when you experience it and God has made it in such a way that the word itself is meant to be applied in our lives aren't you glad he gives us grace how to apply it in our lives and our hearts and I'm just so thankful for that we want to just say tonight we just appreciate brother richard sharing that and we just asked you to just keep us in prayer or willing brother brandon sena cola will be here on sunday standing in on sunday here for us and my wife and i will be there at the funeral for Liliana or willing to speak there for a little bit in that funeral and I just asking you that you would just keep the whole the family continue to keep the family in prayer and also the Lord will just guide and direct us and the words to be said because we can there's a lot of words words that can be said but yet we we want the the Spirit of God to come present there and because that's something that it where a person might forget words that are spoken but when he comes it's all together it's his presence amen and he'll lead and direct right into the word so we just we just ask for your prayers that God will just continue to be with the family through this time so since brother Brandon will be here on Sunday I just thought that I'd go ahead and preach Sunday's message no a just we just got started on Sunday this past Sunday so I just felt in my heart just to go ahead so it wasn't so broke up for us I want to go ahead and just bring this just feeling on my heart to go ahead and continue on with that tonight I trust the Lord will just guide and direct us here tonight he knows what our needs are and we know that God is is always he's right on time so as we look in the word if you want to go ahead and turn with me to second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 3 we'll begin there also remember a brother Richard you might have mentioned this I couldn't hear it real clear until they turned it up back there for me but to remember the viewing for Liliana that will be on this coming Saturday from 2:00 to 7:00 and we have sent out by email we sent out the link or the actual obituary and one thing I just want to mention to you that there's some of you right now and I don't know who you are but you you have it you need to update your email and so I need you to fill that out if your email is out of date or you need to check on it you need to check on that with sister Rosanna so that we make sure that we're getting you the communication that needs to be got and we try to do that and for those who have Facebook I don't myself but we try to also put certain things out there that are related to the church maybe announcements and things like that as well so if you wouldn't mind just kind of looking over maybe just a you can ask sister Rosanna what would email do you have on file for me and then we can go from there and get that all straightened out so let's look here in second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 Paul says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God so when God has given us that of his armor we have with within and on us those weapons but yet those weapons are meant to be used under his leadership that's our strength amen for our weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds look at this verse verse 5 casting down imaginations and then incredible that's been put into our hands they shall cast out Devils Satan was cast out of heaven are you with me when he comes around you are to cast him out he brings the fault he brings up cast him out you have a forty to cast him out Andrea notice the placement and verse five casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus as we Lord would just come into this moment of the service nor do we want to say that we're just so thankful Oh God thank you for Lord your loving-kindness Lord thank you Lord for your mercy and your grace upon our lives Lord we thank you Lord how that you work with us Lord how you deal with our hearts Lord and father how oh God you strengthen us Lord through this journey Lord God and father as a Lord we take these few moments Lord to look into the Word of God Lord we ask that you would just common take control tonight Lord you know what our needs are tonight you know what needs to be said the way that it would need to be said Oh God for every request that's gathered your Lord for the thoughts nor the intents everything God that's on the heart lord I just pray that God that you Lord that you would come and speak personally may your presence Lord Oh God just move Lord God through your word Lord and just touch hearts and lives and God I pray that Lord if there be any hole the enemy Lord Oh God let it be Lord removed here tonight Lord may faith just rise Oh God in that word to know what you have done for us Lord everyone right here in this building Lord and everyone that would be listening Lord even under the sound of my voice God to recognize the Lord what you've already done may our faith Lord just release that now Lord Oh God we just ask that you help us Lord speak to our hearts personally we pray in Jesus name Amen may God bless you as you're being seated I look at this this thought and we have been looking at the the armor of God the weapons of our of our warfare Paul would mention as we look at this that the the the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but they are mighty through God you remember how Paul will mention even in the scripture in the book of Romans Paul will mention and in the book of Colossians and he would deal with even in our lives of how that through the spirit we are to mortify the deeds of the body it would do no good for us of our own strength but through the strength of Almighty God he gives to us the grace by the quickening power to bring our lives in subjection to the Word of God because truly when God has touched a heart and God has dealt with a life the greatest desire that we would have within our hearts is to please the Lord it moves from from a place of just you know wanting to Lord I want to give my I want to surrender and it never moves from a place of just surrendering we want to continue to give to the Lord but then we recognize that within our lives that has God has touched our lives in our hearts that in win-win who has he's moved in our lives we did not enter a picnic and I know we've heard these words many times before there are truly times in our life where we have reprieve we have rest we have times that the rest will come it says that in the book of Acts when there would be rest and there would be times of trials and temptations and things would come and to the church even when we look at the Lord Jesus he would come through a time of testing of trial but then at the end of it when that season was over the Bible said the angels came and ministered unto him so God knows exactly what you and I what we have need of and to think of it that has God has given to us this armor and if I can be just as you know pointed and saying it God will never come down and use the shield of faith that he's given me he'll never use it for me but he requires me to use this shield of faith that he has given me all rebid of this armor is that which God has issued to you and I that we would that we would use it and that's why he gave it to us we are not we're not here to parade around but it's here we are in a battle we are in a war and God prepares us as he's prepared every generation God has prepared us in this hour for the battle that that we are in even right now and you know the scripture would would go on to say here in the book of Ephesians picking up in that of the shield of faith and it would say above all taking on taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and as we were looking at that a little bit and starting in on that on Sunday that the above all it deals with a putting upon or a putting between our lives ourselves and the opposing enemy it is in our hands to take up that shield and brother Ana would say it like this he said that's the shield that knocks off the darts you see the reality even though God has given to us the helmet of salvation the breastplate of righteousness all of the other armament but yet the shield of faith is what will Quinn the fiery darts of the enemy the shield of faith was not just a shield that was given for when there would be battles within sword that was a part of it but Paul noticed the inspiration of the Spirit of God was not drawn to say take up the shield whereby you shall be able to remove every glance of the enemy sword there is a part within it but Paul would see of how that that shield of faith would be used to absolutely quench every not just some but every pirate part of the enemy yeah the reality that we we look at this where David would express this and I think as we were looking at some of this here on on Sunday God has given us this armor and it's like David would say in one place of the scripture he teaches my fingers to fight David would say in another place he teaches my hands to war and I'll say it like this we need training and brother Brandon would put it out in the contest and all the way down putting on the home of God taking on the home of God greatest battle ever fought on and on that the training that is a must and a need is where that a man or a woman would be come in dude with the power of the Holy Ghost not just something that becomes upon our flesh or upon our mind in our spirit but that which goes down and becomes a living reality in our life and there's a change on the inside where then the word becomes seeded in power in our life and this is the training that because once that training has come no matter what you and I can face we have already overcome because we have the overcomer within us we might fail but yet we have the overcomer within us he will guide us he can direct us on how to use the sword and I you know just to maybe to speak of this a little bit there's things that God has even had to teach us on how to use the sword instead of when we're witnessing cutting people's heads off we take the sword and are trying to point them instead of slicing are you with me God teaches us how to use this armor because when we receive it we need we need to know how to use it how to be effective with this armor and I I believe that's what everyone of us as Christians want to be we want to be we want to be better Christians and I and I think of how you know the scripture in first chronicles 12 8 when it would speak of the gadites and then they were separated the Bible says themselves unto David into the whole to the wilderness men of might and men of war fit for the battle these guys came ready to fight they came ready to fight God prepares us for the fight now notice how one of the descriptions that is is is mentioned here they could handle shield and buckler whose faces were like the faces of lions and were as Swift as the rose upon the mountains you know it's one thing to be able to handle the buckler meaning shield or spear it's one thing to be able to handle the sword one thing to be able to handle you know that of a spear but it's another thing to be able to handle the shield you can handle the sword but it listen all of these parts work together if we're not handling the shield correctly it's a good possibility that we are not handling the sword correctly all of these parts are linked together are you with me so this was the testimony that they could handle shield and buckler brother branham would pick it up in Satan's Eden and he would talk about the hour that we are we are living in and he would speak of the desire that would be upon his heart to bring something to the people that would enlighten us for the promise of God for this age now he said I'm not reaching back to what somebody else for some other age but to enlighten us in the promise for this hour this hour that we're living in it is an hour that is just as deceptive if not more so then going back to that of the Garden of Eden and remember what the deception was Satan never came to Eve with something he never walked up to her with the bottle of Jack Daniels he came and attacked her with a word and so this is exactly where Satan he launches his attack is attack in trying to launch it through the word and let's just be real here tonight there is not one of us and that includes preachers as well that is able to withstand the attack of the enemy in our mind or in our body there is only one thing that can outdo the enemy and that's the Holy Ghost there might be things that we cannot understand or see and they're saying sometimes that you can have a little bit of a question of things that you can look at and think well what's the direction on this or what's this but you know within it all it is the Holy Spirit that we are resting and we are resting in the Word of God if we're not resting in him then we become skittish I don't want to be deceived I don't want to be and we're not to live in fear God has never made us to live in fear that is contrary to the rest of Almighty God and we are to rest in him glory be to God amen now notice brother Branham would go on and say we want to enlighten you to know to make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can now David would write of this in Psalms 11 verse 1 and remember much of where you find in the Book of Psalms remember David is a man when we read in many of the Psalms is a man that is regarded as a fugitive within Israel he's already been anointed king of israel he's already come under a prophet's word saul was still there before the people and remember the evil spirit that comes upon saul is a spirit that wants to try to kill David is that right he tried to do everything he could kill David's influence and on and on he tried to do all of those tactics but you see what God had done it was not a man it was God's doing and you find that through the Book of Psalms you find David in a midst of a time where he is looking to the Lord in the defense of his life some of it a majority of it is where that he is in Saul is pursuing him there are times when Absalon when that uprising comes but within it all within the Book of Psalms I'm sure you find this as a Bible reader you can find how that David he approaches the battle and how things would come at him and how they have is the same way that the enemy will approach you and I notice what David would say here in verse one in the Lord in the Lord put I my trust how say ye to my soul flee as a bird to your Mountain for lo the wicked bend their bow and they make ready their arrow upon the string that they made prively shoot at the upright and heart that word privately means calamity did the Satan's desire is to shoot calamities that word probably means plume to shoot crew to shoot darkness once the sea at once the soul has been sealed that cannot touch our soul our Saul has never had a gloomy day in its life I'm talking about since we've been sealed by the Spirit of God that seal cannot once the seal is there it cannot be broken but Satan will try to fire and he'll try to shoot and all of those other parts in our life of flesh and all spirit and notice or David says look what David's response is if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do what's David talking about David's David's answer to the question that you are telling me flee to the mountains as a bird but David is letting them know I'm trusting in the Lord now David is not ignorant there are times that you and I have to run but remember we are not running in fear are you with me there are times where where there is a need to run and to move back and to run you know into the presence of the Lord there's times in situations where you need to get yourself out of that situation that's part of the shield of faith some three powerful words in the book of Genesis 39 when when Pharaoh's when Potiphar's wife was pressing upon Joseph she pressed upon him every day you know Joseph he didn't have a choice he had to work that shift in that factory right then are you with me now he had to work on that floor but notice it was a spirit that was upon her that was pressing upon him but there's three powerful words that when she said to reach and put her hand upon him the Bible says he got him out who got him out Joseph got his self out he took off and ran from the situation he was not running as a coward he was running according to the ledge I cannot stay in this situation that's a shield of faith Oh mah could only be to God think of it Joseph did not have to Joseph ones tender say well I'm gonna stand here and prove that how overcome he was proving overcoming come on somebody it was overcoming he got him out and noticed this David knew where he was standing and we we were we were coming into this on Sunday and dealing with how that those fiery darts for the Rams sometimes when it comes to sickness he were to recall them poisonous darts and he talks about how he says there are some young men here in a service he said there's two young men and and he said they're got a lot of service left in them for you Lord I'm there two soldiers Christians who believe you and the enemy has shot a dart and that poison dart has struck somewhere into their body and they've come back retreated back to the hospital of God's grace for reconciliation for healing that they might approach the front again with the shield up going to the battle they'd come to join the forces of prayer with us Lord and we go to meet the enemy can you give me that third slide there Brian of that whole thing where you look at this look at this at this very part right here this was something they would do they would take all of those shields and when here they were getting ready to approach a battle or a city they would actually every one of them would take their shield and they would march in position and they would put their shield together so that there was no arrow that could be able to touch that whole group brother there's times of standing like this we stand together in unity and we are putting our shield of faith together are you with me putting our shield of faith together to stand there and to approach and say we're not giving up any ground this ground belongs to us are you with me tonight it doesn't matter what sickness comes our way we stand there upon God's giving ground that has been made real to us and the law that healeth all bad diseases hallelujah we stand upon that word like we've been preaching on healing we stand upon that word when it comes to deliverance for our homes he stand upon that word when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost we don't pull apart we put our shields together and we march all to take every promise that God has given to us and this is exactly what brother Branham is talking about in this meeting there are two young men that he says they have been struck with poisonous darts remember brother man tells us he said the Satan's arrows they went over the shield and they connected hmm that they might approach the front again you know you don't get wounded by sitting in the mess hall you know I'm talking about brother Carlos you don't get wounded by sitting around telling battle stories of somebody else's battle come on somebody you don't get you don't get you don't get wounded because you're just around where it's going on or around all the tents and I went and visited this soldier and yet you know I've seen a vengeance soldier so-and-so an apostille soldier so-and-so and he told me about do you want their testimony or do you want your own come on now you they can't fight I can't fight your battles you can't find my battles but the only way you get wounded is when you're on the frontline and fighting and there'll be times when we get wounded but thanks be to God there is a hospital of God's grace and as the Prophet said an ambulance God's ambulance of angels that are able to pack us to healing oh I'm glad for that tonight Amen warriors in the battle now notice we were looking at this on here how the scripture would talk about the shield of faith being able to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy of the wicked one and that word quench it deals with putting out or extinguishing a fire and I gave you some of these points on Sunday here toward the latter part of the message but but you've seen there with the shields that brother Brian had posted up there for us that particular shield is the one that Paul would see by that by that of one of the Roman soldiers and Paul would under inspiration he would would take that and begin to look at that shield of faith it was a shield that was four foot long two foot wide it weighed about 22 pounds and remembered when they would carry this shield it was one that would actually block in the front it was made of wood that was pressed together and then it had a leather part upon the front of it but the edges of it were of brass and metal so if a sword came it was able to deflect that sword when it would come on the edge but the wood but the warriors when they were the soldiers would take these shields and they would take them and they would put them in water and soak them overnight and the shields themselves would soak up the water so when it came time now for the battle to take place the next day when all the fiery darts whatever were launched at them they had within that shield the substance that was needed to be able to quench the fiery darts and I'm telling you right now this is why we need our refilling of the Holy Ghost we need refilling after revealing after refilling give us this day our daily bread that's why this is what Jude would write up in the book of Jude he would say building up your most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost it's admonition on our life listen you can know all the word but prayer is very very important it's a way so let's let's look at this just for a moment on these these darts that would come in here and you find that this of the D tactics that would advance and how that we looked at that the other night Yahtzee I've got my arrow here when we would look at that and you realize that every one of these the arrows themselves of fiery darts they would take the shaft and they were actually made out of cane and in that that shaft of cane II would be hollow they would put combustible flammable liquid in there alcohol or different things that they would put in there on the end of it they would wrap the tip of it in in tow and pitch and light it on fire when the arrow would go forth flying through the air one of the things just looking at the arrow if a win-win he would come flying because at the beginning of a battle you would have arrows flying from every side that was all part of the tactic because when arrows are coming from all sides think of this when you have flaming it looks like comments almost better going forth the way that the riders describe it the way that these things would look it and a person's looking all around the whole part within it was to induce panic confusion fear that all those thoughts would arise why because the because then the soldier he gets his focus on the fiery dart instead of looking at he's been prepared to take care of their fiery darts hey man so to think when that when that would go forth as soon as it would hit on the shield or the soldier this would disengage and all of that flammable liquid would just go out and where the flammable liquid goes you know how gasoline is wherever the liquid goes the fire will follow so sometimes it would fall upon the flesh other times it would fall and get down to the spirit are you with me now you see the reality is that when you and I when God has done a work even within our lives let me said like this even when God is doing a work in a life this is why brother bana would pray of just reading in the message presuming he would ask for those who just gave their hearts to God he said God let a great determination of grace come upon their lives to where that they will go on to be sanctified by the Word of God give them a great determination to go on let me just tell you something right now even when God is dealing with your life and you might be if I say like this on the first rung of the ladder you're not defenseless God has given you his word you can stand on that word and every promise it belongs to you you have to fight for it but it belongs to you glory be to God this shield that would be given remember brother Mannis said like this he said as soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost he said the devil's got every gun trained on you your your face went on a wanted poster in hell but don't get scared because you got greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world come on somebody the enemies against you listen the reality brother Brad would put it so simple he said you were just slouching and slapping along before he said but now you got dressed up got cleaned up you got a uniform on he said the devil's got every gun trained on you every temptation that can be thrown at you he's coming with that all but you have greater is He that is in you than he that's in the world that's why I could say take the shield and when the dots come back them off and move on simple words but powerful back them off and move on then fall you keep going [Music] hallelujah the devil tells you you're strange calls fiery darts cuts fella shot at you he's a liar don't you pay no attention to quench em and move on there's Brown to be taken I remember when God just got a hold my life probably loved you heard brother Donnie say this and I remember you know sitting on the platform at times I'm just just a young boy you know almost you know 25 or whatever years ago and he would say he said the devil he says the one that'll talk you in to rob at the bank and then turn around and have you called 911 he said he's the one that a fire of thought in your mind and turn around and say how could you think there's such a thing come on now we're talking about an enemy you know why oh my I wish I'm then I gotta stay on the shield of faith his whole thing he wants to try to bring condemnation because he knows the power of that word when a believer will take that word and speak that word I'm telling you brother you may not see the mountain tall but a crumble a grain of sand does everything he can to try to silence that voice greater is He that's in you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul your soul is no longer flammable it's got fire burning in there already it's like the burning bush it's a fire burning within yet the bush is not consumed there all right but there's still two other parts of you and me that's flammable this is why we've got this choice we've got a choice victory is not automatic that's true you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy but it is not automatic it's warfare here we require and it requires us to live from the realm of our soul to live from that victory of Calvary that's been brought into our soul and we've been brought in that's why requires every day that's why the devil fights every day he wants to fight you in your daily walk he fights you in your prayer time because this is our strength I don't care how much mysteries a person knows if your prayer life is not up to par you're a target and just put it as plain as simple as can be you've got to stay in fellowship brother Branham would even tell us like this he said the key to the mysteries is prayer oh my so we want to stay in that strength notice let's look at a few scriptures here and first Corinthians 10:13 there hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man but God is faithful who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able but will with the temptation also make a way of escape that you may be able to bear it you see the question is do you want a way of escape there is a way of escape God is faithful he will with the temptation make a way of us of escape our strength is turning the battle to the gate to the Word of God this is why Paul would write to you and I in Romans 6 verse 12 let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the lusts thereof don't let it linger like we read here in the scripture bring it in subjection this is where the strength the strength our strength as a believer our strength it comes from the Lord when when our lives are not where it needs to be we don't have the strength we ought to have come on now we talked about white dog and black dog we readers and there's a need which one wins which one when he feeds the most come on now you see it's all it's recognizing you know brother Adam would even deal with with with these things in himself where he would recognize fiery darts that had been able to connect even in his spirit to where he himself would identify in earlier parts of the message and throughout of how he said I've become negative I've become critical I've got negative thoughts in my heart but you know what he would say at that moment I'm determined to blast my heart out he recognized he became critical but what was that it was not bad of what we know the inner man becoming critical but noticing the things that were being said things that were being done then it become critical you know listen friends these are things that when brother Branham was talking about it it needs it for anybody to be critical of are you with me when a person becomes critical it's a sure sign fiery darts have connected and that flammable liquid is going all over the place come on now when your fellowship is criticism it ain't fellowship it ain't invitin angels it's inviting Devils we are not to be critical people are you with me hallelujah that was free think about I want you to think of this the enemy would fight the Prophet in this area of his life an area of his life that would require such humility and yet that very area is the area that Satan would target and fire siren dark after firing up why because he was a cold he was purposed by God to be the prophet of this age they covered he experienced these things but he had to overcome them in order to be a vessel that could bring the word of the Lord to you and I it just didn't happen he had to battle and to fight what a testimony in his to us that not therefore sin reign in your mortal body sometimes we get to looking at the thoughts and we were thinking way out here was sin but remember it's dealing with even in things that come in things we hear thoughts and other things words that are being spoken are you with me new dawn would slant like this and by faith Moses he said no Lord we would ask you that you would forgive us of any mistake any sin of trespass or omission omission is omitting going over what should be done and neglecting it transgression that if any evil thought has pierced our soul by the fiery darts of the devil that you would drive away this evil of thine and of that people we would ask you Lord that you would send the Holy Spirit to take hold of the word at this time as we yield ourselves as instruments that you would speak through us and hear through us thy word and may we in return receive it as from thee and leave this place today feeling that we have been readjusted to the cause of Christ that we might be better fit for the service of tonight tomorrow because of your visitation and they say lord help me to be readjusted when I need to be readjusted help me Lord let me be readjusted hey listen some of y'all let you go and let people crack your backs and everything else what do you do I'm all out of whack I need to get readjusted I need to get lined up there's times we need a good spiritual Cryer contractor we need to have some things cracked back into place that have gotten out of place maybe our feelings or our thoughts or our attitudes have got a little bit out of place and it's not exactly wearing needs to be but God knows exactly how to tell us them say earlier down here and move your arm up here put your leg over your head this way and let's do it this way and let's and all of a sudden pop then you say oh I never did get to feel that but I just take people's words they always tried to crack me and said I can't do it notice Galatians 5:16 this I save him now watch this this I say then walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh this word walk means to live or to regulate one's life notice Galatians 5:17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit it's not the human spirit this is the Holy Spirit the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the things that you would it's moved to a place to where when the Holy Ghost has come there is a battle a warfare that sets forth on the inside where now there is a desire you have a power you have authority on the inside and you recognize that opposing force you know the enemy can come to you when you're on your way to receiving the Holy Ghost and he can come to you and you can stand there and say well you know I don't have the strength I know I'm still feeling in this here in my life but you do not have to become a puppet for the devil you can take God's Word and say I'm going to stand on God's Word on this promise Lord if there's something out of line in my life that's hindering me from receiving your word because they're sharing no problem with you if there's any problem it's right here Lord so I need your Lord to bring an adjustment Lord in my life to where the world itself can actually be able to come to pass in my life so there's an actual opposition that is between in that love in a believer but the band would call it a constant war that takes place but remember greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world 1st John chapter 2 verse steam for all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life it is not of the Father but it is of the world these are the three gates of temptation that every temptation that comes to you and I comes right through one of these three gates the brother brand would take this up in the healing of Jairus daughter and the brother brand would talk about in this quote to me it's just a beautiful how that it's how that it's laid out so clearly on the battle that you and I would be in he said now notice he said Satan he does not tempt down in here talking about the soul he tempts out here in the flesh he said you know for example you're going down the street tomorrow and you're walking along singing Christian songs and somebody says you know he or she is just a hypocrite talking about you there's nothing now the first thing he says your flesh picks that up in the year and it suggests to the mind let's see what it suggests get even with them listen I'm a sealed believer yes a sealed believer but remember the enemy these parts out here are still flammable when you got the Holy Ghost you never got a glorified body we never got our feet off any are you with me but we did receive the victory that leads us to that are you with me Oh glory be to God think of this get even with him time it gets back here he says it says back here vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord I will repay so Satan tempts out here he doesn't get down here because this is immortal it's the flesh that he tends he said now for example a young man going down the street a young Christian boy a young lady coming and morally dressed the eye picks it up and the flesh suggests to the mind evil then it gets to the mind it goes to the soul the nature is good he said then he said when the soul he said the spirit there will say whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery in his horn already the young man turns his head and walks away that's down here is where it's got to be down in the heart are you with me that's where it's got to be down there within the heart man you know one of the biggest things that is so highly combustible about our life is self-confidence that is I mean that right there is really highly flammable it has those little signs on it highly flammable I can do this I can no it's I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me are you with me I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me so to think how that self-confidence itself would be such a combustible part notice in the life of the Lord Jesus when you look in the life of the Lord Jesus think of this here he is upon this earth we've looked at this in many different times and you've heard it many different times and you look at it through the prophets message but here comes the Lord Jesus here he comes up out of the River Jordan he's received the Holy Ghost the word has been quickened to him he's received a revelation of God for his day and he goes forth and the Bible says the spirit led him into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil you see when God doesn't work he ain't afraid God said I ain't afraid of this work I can lift this work go it can actually be tested and proven that this is the real deal that's what God allows our faith to be tested sometimes our faith is so tested to a place where you look and say I feel like I'm at a breaking point but remember it's not altogether your strength it is his strength that strengthens our faith and when we come through the test or the trial we come forth better he was tempted you agree with it Jesus was not going through an act he was tempted so here he is walking in a body of flesh having a spirit and down on the inside his soul and he moves up into this temptation and remember the enemy is going to try him as he's tried everyone who has lived before he's going to come with the same tactics the same techniques that he came against II which we just read the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh and the pride of life the first tactic that he comes to if Jesus is in such a weakened state he's hungered he has not had any food for 40 days and think of it here he is in a time where brother man will put it like this on the hebrew series he said when a man gets hungry he'll do about anything so notice Jesus came to such a place I like how brother Graham said it he said Jesus brought the kingdom of God solo to where it can be you and I can look and see of just how that the weakness Christian can take the Word of God and stand on the word and defeat the enemy Jesus was in a weakened state here came Satan Satan was refreshed and ready he was refer Satan was refreshed and ready I mean you know maybe Satan you know it just just got up here the 40th day I'll wait to that time he's ready to go he's refreshed and ready here was Jesus in a weakened state it just goes to show that a weak Christian can whip a refreshed devil [Applause] Jesus brought the kingdom of God solo to where you don't have to feel strong you don't have to be a strong Christian but the weakest Christian can take that work and stand on that word with the shield of hate you know back the devil up he came to pit him there in his habitat in his hunger in his weakness but then even after that Satan wants to tempt him in the pride of life right lust of the eyes so here he overcome and I'm not moving kind of quickly but he overcome every one of those temptations that came at him he was tempted you know the Bible says in the book of Hebrews chapter 2 and then going over to Hebrews 4 that he was tempted in all points such as we are that word in him that he suffered he underwent a sensible experience to think how God so subjected himself and came down this was not just like a guy who's one nerd won your vote and he puts on a hardhat and walks through a factory no sir that is not the same way this is where God Himself did not just come down and put on a hardhat he came down and subjected himself to absolutely understand what it's all about when the fiery darts would come in upon the flesh and the pool would come or when it would explode and how did the shield of faith would be able to quench every Dart of the enemy he would be able to experience the Bible says he'll undergo a sensible experience he would know how it felt when it's pulled by wrong are you with me this was our Lord Jesus and he overcame by what the word not by any of his divine powers he never overcame by any of his supernatural powers he overcame by the word this is where David would talk about he has given me the shield of his salvation he has given me his truth as my shield and buckler these are things that David would speak and exhort to us on now when we look at this let me just try to narrow this down here just just a few moments many times where we're looking at we're looking at the battle as though that it's out here Satan can come as we were reading with all the suggestions and everything that he can try to come at us but remember what what he's trying to hit is combustible material so as to understand the battle is right here this is the battle right here it's not how fair if the battle is right here it's - its to walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh to quench the fiery darts of the enemy now notice this I want you think of this we just refer to this of the Lord Jesus he was tempted on through the scripture if the body if the flesh was God then you got God being tempted and God can be tempted are you with me but God was in Christ come on now is that right and Jesus even as brother branham would tell us he says Jesus Jesus himself was tempted by women tempted with drinking tempted with all those things they were fired at him and he experienced all those temptations every test every trial listen he experienced words being said about him his whole life think about it everywhere he would win there was a black mark upon his life where people had said well you know his mother you know she wasn't pregnant you know by a drunken soldier all of these things were out there now notice Jesus could have become focused on trying to put all of that out he couldn't put it out out there but he can put it out right here are you with me too many times we're trying to put it out in somebody else's mouth it ain't their mouth it's right here hmm this is why David would say let me just skip down to a place in Psalms 57 4 here is David when he escaping from Saul he said in my soul is among lions and I lie even among them that are set on fire even the sons of men whose teeth are Spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword what's his response to it be valid salted Oh God I'm not dragging down his holiness be Val exalted what he is that that's rather well above the heavens let that glory be above all the earth how many times brother branham would tell us simple advice but he would tell us he said if you're going to fight the battle God can't find it sometimes you're tempted to try to fight the battle prove your points and everything else help me preach now but that's only a trap of the enemy what that is it's this it's combustible I've got to say this I've gotta lay this and I've got to do this and I've got to do that fiery darts man that flesh and that spirit is all inflamed didn't they realized why would they say that why would they do this one is that that is arrows that have been fired Psalm 64 three who wet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter words don't ask you to raise your hand but nobody likes to receive bitter words you know we don't like to be misunderstood oh brother Samuel then don't bother me you're lying you can try to pretend like you don't bother you but it bothers you but you see listen the bothersome part is because steel right here in our life there is those parts that are combustible remember that does not mean we're defeated we are not defeated we are not walking around and say well I wonder where the devil's next punch is coming from we're not looking for his next punch we've got promises to take we've got a rapture to take I'm not worried about his punches I know that God will prepare every footstep and everything that I have need of it's just don't let me get in the way this was why brother Branham would say and we would you know no wonder it be like the congregation reason they would laugh when brother Brent would say it and you say they would laugh it was kind of like while I try myself on Sunday being a real young Christian Lord of Mercy I've never experienced a battle like that and you know the enemy come in at you like that but you know you wait a little bit and then the enemy he wants to try to make his approach that'll scare us that this cares God prepares you for it but brother Graham would stand right in the message perfect faith talk about words think about brother Brian what he's come through he's come through things where people say brother brems coming to town put your hair up pin it up we don't want to talk about here you know I'm doing this program you know he's always got this going on you know brother Brian he's a prophet of God long as the anointing is on it but don't pay no attention to his doctrine all these same things and you know what that wasn't even the heart brother Branham he had he had God's heart within this his heart was to help God's people where the enemy had lessened and the enemy had stripped down and wanted to take away from the real effect of Calvary to just a church membership but God put a revelation in the prophets heart to scream out in this generation to get our eyes off of organization and also Creed's of man and get our eyes to Jesus because it's in Jesus we can recognize I must and I need help I need deliverance there is a blood that can loosen me he had to overcome all of that sometimes you know for me maybe I'm maybe I'm odd maybe you do too I look at much of this right here where brother Branham was preaching about and you started hearing things and you realize there's certain statements brother Ram will make and you begin to pick up battles he's been in he don't even have to come out and say it but you recognize it from in your own you start recognizing certain battles he's been in that God has brought him through in that encouragement this is always encouragement for me always Paul's copy putting my notes keep on walking notice he says think of it he says in his own life when words would come he looks out and sees people that's drew drove a real long distance and they stayed over for the night service he said you know I get spells I myself get spells he said I get to a spot sometimes what gets me is when I get those spells when I get all overworked and Satan comes telling me why nobody cares for you you really haven't got a friend in the world hey you see we would look at the anything you gotta be kidding me brother brems got to hide from people he's got to hide and duck away but you see the effect being overworked these are insights he's sharing with us being overworked many times think about how many things brother bran would tell us over and over I said I'm standing at the pulpit right now having to take the opposite of what Satan is trying to tell me right now he would stand there battling with spirits service after service and then right here the enemy when he gets overworked he gets a little weak and the enemy comes to him and says nobody cares about you let me bring it down to your home he really don't appreciate what you do when's the last time he thanked you for it preach brother sin when's the last time that he complimented your meal when's the last time he told you thank you then they're getting on the husband what's the last time that she said she loves you you know she's so busy with everything else that's going on she don't even seem to have time for you and then that little bit of a jealousy wants to rise up you can sit here and look like angels but I know the truth and all of a sudden you start copping a little thing it's a little different when in turn we need the shield of faith the shield of faith to say wait a minute it is not God that would be propelling me in this way and even if there were things that were wrong that ain't going to accomplish nothing Lord Jesus well here we are Thursday night oh my he said now remember I'm not immune to the temptation I've got to overcome that now watch how he overcomes it but when I look back and I see these people that's traveled from a long distance this is what he does by the jury he says I put it right back in Satan's face and I say what about that that's what we need to do what about that nobody loves you what about that catch you got the other day well nobody loves me nobody greets me they cannot chase you down as you're running to your car hello somebody nobody seems to care about me at church you know and here you are you don't stick around to shake hands with nobody simple Scripture but powerful he that showeth himself friendly has friends so you need to put that right back in the devil's quiver he said that helps me overcome now let me come back to her point and just coming down here James says in James 1:13 let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed where does it remain where does it reside right here lust let me just say this to you lusts do not let lust just be a term well that is where a man is looking upon a woman or a woman looking to a man lust is a forbidden desire come on now you and I are forbidden to get angry come on now you're forbidden to hold grudges come you're forbidden to have that of corrupt communication going out of your mouth come on now all of these things apply now tuned to recognize this is where the guarding this is where the protecting and this is where it requires faith to direct the Word of God this is why in 1st John 5:4 for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith now I want to read this quote to you here LeBron was talking about the six sins he's talking about all of our the five senses and the sixth sense in the beginning they're a paragraph 190 he says made this super sense may the sense of faith that belongs to the believer because he have to have it in order to believe God Lord give us more of it and they say more of the Lord I want more of their faith o purge the Lord and tries fill us with thy goodness and with our power let us walk all the days of our life by the sixth sense by the sense of faith that's only given by Jesus Christ that what we pray for may we believe that we receive it and have no doubt in her heart and you promised that it would come to pass he said now he goes on you know he goes on to sing the song faith in the Father faith in the son faith and the Holy Ghost these three are one demons will tremble sinners awake faith in Jehovah will anything shake he makes a comment then he goes on the sings that again now in paragraph 193 says o my precious faith precious glorious faith God give me faith remember it's a shield of faith by faith Abraham by faith Isaac by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain him being yet dead testify o how we need faith I love him I want more faith my desire in this life and for this new year coming is more faith in God God take away any doubt that's in my mind if there should ever arise one Satan fights at me he fights at you he tries to shoot his arrows but may I have the shield of faith always before me to his stand the wiles of the devil - back to knock off his fiery darts they want more faith notice and second thought that Thessalonians I'm closing I just a few more scripts we want more faith right many times we're asking the Lord I want more I want more faith now watch how faith while faith is accompanied with this this real kind of faith that we need for battle your faith notice he's talking to the church your faith groweth exceedingly and the charity that's love of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth so that we ourselves glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that she endure the Bible tells us in first Kron 4 Corinthians 13 - that though I have all faith to talk and move remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing over and over you find the underlying theme of this armor is the love of God because that's the armor of God that is the Holy Ghost that is the Word of God that's what keeps that shield well-oiled that's what keeps it saturated if the love of God you look at we're talking about the love of God we're talking about falling and continue to be in love with the Lord when you start when you find yourself getting irritable and short with one another it's time say Lord I need a refilling I need a refilling why because that revealing it'll work out towards other things that are coming in our life but listen don't get down on yourself just go to him who's able to gradually feel like you devil you kept me away where you tried to sidetrack me here and get it out here as though oh this person saying this and this person saying this the truth of the matter it's right here in my mortal member if I can take this and reign over this they can keep on saying what they want to say Jesus went to Calvary when criticism was all around him brother Branham said he made a choice not to pay any attention to the criticism and keep his eyes on Calvary I believe if he did it I believe he's acquit just to do it don't get focused on your failures greater is He that is in you it's what do you want to do about it do you want to turn the battle into the gate do you want to say Lord we don't ever try to perfect this you can't perfect this but it's to recognize when it rises up and say oh wait a minute here this is not about this and this and this those are all distractions but right here we need help we need help these are not things we can just talk about these are things that require dying when we're in the midst of battle and our fighting see the way that the mind the carnal mind would think of it it's looking at battle many times we're out here you know swinging the sword but remember the strength of the sword being swung the strength of the shield being up than that of the belt being tightened it all comes back to our individual walk with God Galatians 5:6 for in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love the shield of faith I want more faith increase my faith Lord help me Lord to die in those areas where I'm tested and let Lord let my life be so filled with the love of God you know friends it isn't it isn't so much what we're saying oh I want to really I really want to want to have the right attitude or the right direction toward this person or this individual that's the right way to start are you with me that's the right way to start is to be in that manner because that's that's that's inclining in that direction but to say Lord fill me fill me with more of the love of God if we just focus on being for feel more of the love of God the love of God will take care of every area it'll fortify us and give us strength when bitter words are flying when things are said and we're misunderstood we're tempted to want to prove our point tempted to want to prove our point our side of it that's a trap there's time sometimes just for things to be said but always remember the battle it's not out there it's this right here that's combustible it's this right here but don't let sin reign in your mortal body keep up the shield of faith if you're weary just say Lord renew me let him renew you the love of God Oh am i I believe that with all my heart that that's that's our desire believe that's what we need is a refilling of the Holy Ghost I believe that with all my heart a refilling of the Holy Ghost it takes care of family problems a refilling of the Holy Ghost takes care of disagreements you know why because the water level got low and there starts to be a fence between you preach brother same but the love of God comes pouring in the water level starts rising Lord I want to be a conduit I don't want to be part of the Beavers dam I want to be a conduit that the water can flow let's pray father throughout this building here tonight Lord you know every need in every heart Lord I pray may there not be one Lord that would be here tonight Lord that they would feel within themselves defenseless but I pray Lord that they would take you at your word and what you have spoke personally to their hearts Lord if there's one here tonight Lord your God that maybe in some area of their life Lord maybe they've failed Lord in some area maybe the enemy Lord has been so battling them Lord in their mind and they're trying to find some kind of ground to stand on Lord they got taken by surprise father I pray tonight knowing that we have an advocate Jesus Christ the righteous I pray tonight Lord God that you would move move for that heart tonight Lord may they reach out in faith and take hold Lord God on the promise or those whose hearts that they need to be renewed or God what a fresh refilling of the Holy Spirit or maybe in their shield their shield has become so dry it's no longer saturated they've been fighting in the battle the Lord God throughout the heat of the day it starts to dry out lord I pray but now Lord is we have an access they have an access as a believer Lord God to be able to come tonight Lord into your presence Lord if there's things that need to be made right they can make a ride right in your presence right here tonight Lord hearts Lord God and be filled with the Holy Spirit to mag Lord and dear God you can refill Lord God every heart tonight Lord or Jesus we pray Lord tonight that God as you've spoke to our hearts Lord in this battle this engagement this war that we're in the Lord what we hear through it all we
