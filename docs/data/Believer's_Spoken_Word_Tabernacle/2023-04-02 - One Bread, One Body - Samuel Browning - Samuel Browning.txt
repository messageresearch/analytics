strong points do you have an hour but uh I always feel like I'm forgetting something I don't know if I don't know if all the technology and everything has led to all those things or not but I just always feel that way so amen as we get ready to look into the word of the Lord here this morning um let's just let's just bow our hearts once again and let's just ask the Lord just to bless this this time that we have together that he would just take control and this part further part of the service and we each have needs and we we really need him to come in a special way and that's our desire let's just pray one for another and ask let's just invite him just to have his way here Heavenly Father Lord what a privilege it is Lord that we can call you and to know you as our father Lord and oh God it's Lord more than a title to us it's a reality Lord that burns in our hearts Lord that you Lord are our father and we are your children oh God born of your spirit and of the word Lord and oh God we just Lord bow Lord not only our heads but Lord our hearts Lord and humility and just asked this morning that you would just Lord have your way in the remaining part of this service Lord you know each and every need and Lord of the things that Lord that we could study and we could look and be impressed by your spirit but there is a desire that you have Lord for this moment and I ask that you would help us Lord that together that we might be able to step aside Lord oh God is your children Lord each and every one there's cares there's burdens of life there's questions Lord there's needs and oh God may you look upon us Lord this morning Lord and just come and Minister Lord break the bread of life to us Lord and may the Holy Spirit just move Lord in such a an intimate and Lord sweet way Lord for every life and every heart o God we just love you and we thank you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's read First Corinthians chapter 10. and verse 16. amen did you get it First Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 16. the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread I want to read that verse again for we being many are one bread and one body for we are all partakers of that one bread and may the Lord bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated I'd just like to speak for a few moments this morning on one bread and one body and I know this is a later this evening or this afternoon we'll have communion service but the thought in itself is where we have worked and I just paused there from what we have been dealing with and come back into this thought of how that God working in the body of Jesus Christ because it's God working in US individually but we are not on an island all to ourselves we are we are a part of the body of Jesus Christ and so when we see this here in the scripture I want to go if we look into Luke chapter 22 and verse 14. and the Bible because Paul is referring to this and what we just read of what all of it what what it was speaking of and it says when the hour was come he sat down and The Twelve Apostles with him and he said unto them with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not eat any more thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God and he took the cup and gave thanks and said take this and divide it among yourselves for I say unto you I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come and he took bread and gave thanks and break it and gave unto them saying this is my body which is given for you this due in remembrance of me likewise also the cup after supper saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood which is shed for you so recognizing when the Lord Jesus would say I have desired to eat this Passover with you here is arriving at a moment to where now it's going to move from just a type to the annotype being fulfilled where Israel had kept the Passover as God had given them but that Passover was speaking and was announcing that there was truly going to come a perfect Lamb of God one in whom where the animal life that life could never come back upon the worshiper but God made provision and he said there in Egypt after all the signs were given there came what was what was the most important was is that there would come a deliverance and the only way that Deliverance could come was that the blood of an innocent one would be applied so they would have to take a lamb it would be personal and they would slay the lamb they would they would Mark the the lentil and the doorpost and remember as we look at it it they never were to put the blood on the threshold because you're never to walk over the blood but we're always to walk under the blood and I think it's something that we look at in our lives that if when Jesus talks about the sheep and he says I'm the door of the sheep holding he that cometh through the door cometh come by me and then when he goes in and out he shall find Pastor I I believe it's the desire of every believer's heart that we understand we have to live in this world we walk in this world but I don't want to go anywhere that I can't go under the blood if I can't go out if I can't go under the blood then I don't want to be there because if Jesus is not welcome then I don't want to be there and we understand what that would mean I understand we get on the jobs and things like that and know that in many of those jobs and things that the Lord Jesus himself he's not welcome but it's quite a difference than going to other places in the world that you realize Jesus wouldn't go to those places and so when we look at this and examine of one body and one bread or one bread and one body and I want to read that once again in First Corinthians chapter 10 if you'll go back up to that for a moment it says the cup of blessing which we bless is it not the communion of the blood of Christ and the bread which we break is it not the communion of the body of Christ for we being many are one bread and one body for we are partakers of that one bread now in John chapter 6 when Jesus is standing there and remember there has been many that have followed him for the Miracles and the signs and the Wonders and and it's it's really got their attention but then when the Declaration came and they asked the question what must we do that we might work the works of God they're looking at what they know to be works of God and Jesus brings it in the Simplicity that the true work of God is that you would believe on him whom the father hath sent that's the true work I tell you let me just say it like this when you talk about the miraculous you talk about the supernatural there's no greater Miracle than being able to recognize him and to believe him and to receive him there's many miracles that's true but there's no greater Miracle than that and then that in our own lives to experience the Redemptive grace of God that changes us where all things are passed away and behold all things have become new that's the greatest Miracle there is that's what it's all about all of the other signs all the other wonders are to declare that he is here so it wasn't they were chasing after Loaves and miracles they were chasing after signs but all of that was done that it would get the attention to recognize there is a God who is present that has come down to meet your needs I want you to think of this here for a moment Jesus could say I am that bread that has come down out of Heaven I am that bread so we're not just speaking of and we understand of a natural bread we're not speaking of even as Jesus and they could say our fathers ate man in the wilderness but Jesus said they're everyone dead but here this was what was promised that Manna was all in type but this bread was speaking of that reality of what is to come and what would move down right here Among Us in this moment Hallelujah you okay brother Joey let's pray for our brother I just I've I've looked past it let's just pray for him by your heads please Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I lay my hands O God upon my brother Lord according to the commission of your word Lord I pray that God that you'll bring Lord to release the Lord in his body right now Satan in the name of Jesus Christ I adjure you to take your hands off and I rebuke you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ granted Lord I pray in Jesus precious name that healing Lord in virtue Lord would move Lord through his body right now for the glory of almighty God in Jesus precious name Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah glory be to God I am that bread and he said except you would eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you that stumbled many is that right because let me say this to you they had they had previous scripture they could go to and say hey wait a minute we're not we're not even supposed to eat certain things let alone the blood but you see now come what that was pointing to was that there would come a true reality where a person would be able to become a partaker not of an animal blood but of the blood of Jesus Christ which is what God's own life that's what would come to the believer and the believer would be a partaker of the bread of almighty God which is the word so let me just say this we cannot it's not just to be a partaker of the spirit but it's also when we're a partaker of the spirit we are also a partaker of the bread and if we're a partaker of the bread we're a partaker of the spirit because they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is that right that's why we as Believers recognize our we're not walking under uh oh I felt the presence of God but our lives we're looking and there's a reality something in us that when I don't feel his presence there is something that is burning within my heart I know it's not I who is living but it's Christ who's living in me I'm not the same person that I used to be I've Been Changed he is my life he is My All In All that's the difference we're not just yes we enjoy God's presence but it's to have his presence here in the midst of Our Lives because everyone through the scriptures that's ever partaken of that bread just like the little woman at the well we don't even know her name but when that word was being made manifest that the others called in that day Beelzebub you couldn't put a finger on their life but they rejected him and they knew what was taking place they did could not denounce it they had to admit in their private meetings there was one who let the cat out of the bag by the name of Nicodemus we know thou art a teacher sent from God but they were unwilling and unable to Humble themselves to The Living Word of God they were unwilling to do that and yet that's what they needed that was the whole purpose that's what the law that's when everything was pointing to there was a coming Messiah there is one who was coming that would pay the ultimate price that would bring the real promises that God made to Abraham when he stood before his kid doing flesh that same God would make them a reality in their lives so that's the real the real uh reality when remember when Melchizedek met Abraham in Genesis 14 after the battle was over what did Melchizedek give him that Melchizedek it's none other than God is that right Paul picks that up he who never had beginning of days nor ending of life nor father mother there's only one that could be and that's God but it was God revealing himself as the king and high priest it was God revealing himself and when Abraham had overcome the victory what did he give Abraham Bread and Wine he gave what was needed this is that of the meal the sustenance of the Overcomers let me tell you something you'll never be able to overcome in this hour without feeding on the word of almighty God it'll take more than a church life it'll take more than just being associated with a few people it's going to take a real true uniting with the Holy Spirit by the new birth nothing else will do this is where the Lord Jesus when he had even prayed and he was Desiring of this that when we see that the True Church of the Living God is made up of the word of God and the spirit of God operating in her and through her we are one bread and one body remember Jesus prayed in John 17 and we've looked at this here in some Services how he prayed that they may be one and he wasn't speaking of that we just get a group of people together but there's a Oneness that's being called for a Oneness that man fell from in the beginning you see it's God's desire to be one with his children when God moved there in the beginning it is God revealing himself not that he has a family but it is that God is a family he's dwelling with his children when he went here he brought forth Adam and then here's Eve it's God dwelling with his children they had perfect Fellowship perfect love there was perfect understanding here they were walking in that place that God had ordained them to walk and what was most important is they had God's own life in them yeah but what separated that is sin came in there's many attributes of sin drinking smoking lusting and on and on dressing and everything those are all attributes are you hearing me you can cut out the drinking but you still got to get to the unbelief that's only an attribute looks like somebody that continues to have a symptom in their life and then the doctor only wants to give you a pill that'll actually only address the symptom instead of really getting down to some heart-to-heart talk and say hey there's some things got to change in your life the gospel never came to numb us to symptoms it came to address the real problem we were born in sin shaped in iniquity it taken a blood to be shed for the remission of our sins that the life in that blood then could come to you and I and seek you and I out it's God's desire to take and together his children back to himself this was the prayer that they may be one now how is this going to be Jesus said the glory that you've given me that Glory that I had with thee That Glory that now as that Glory has come down and it has brought that expression it has quickened that word in my life that same remember when he was baptized in the River Jordan right he was always the word he was born the word but now when he walks up out of the river charted it now is the word made flesh you say well how couldn't it have been the word made flesh before because it takes the quickening power to come upon the word to make the word live and it is the fire that declares it's not water it's gasoline that's there are you hearing me now amen this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell and so now that Oneness to Glory thou has given me I have given them that they might be one even as Thou Art In Me and I in them that they would be one now the thing that's the prayer of the Lord Jesus that we that it would come to that reality within every heart and then God working with that Harmony working in every life every member and within the body of Jesus Christ to wear there is a harmony with one another because that's the only that's the only grounds of Fellowship you you understand I think we understand these are common words to us grounds of Fellowship in other words this is the only way to really have fellowship with God is that Christ himself would be in you now it's like this when you invite it just heard it this morning when you invite him in to your life and say Lord I'm a sinner you know that's one great reality that's that's a starting point right there if you don't recognize yourself a sinner you're in trouble well I went to Sunday school you're still a sinner and you still need repentance and it's not a man to lead you in that it's where a conviction strikes your heart and the conviction moves in your heart and says hey what must I do to be saved it's working in Repentance and to think of how that the grounds of Fellowship even when the Holy Spirit comes into a life let him lead you now I'm talking about when he comes in as your savior let him lead you let him work in your life let him go in every room in your life if there are things in your life that are not right and not pleasing to him let him remedy that in your life let him fully come in Samuel what are you saying I'm saying don't just let him on the mat and then allow the enemy to discourage you as though nothing happened if you let him in under justification let him be a sanctifier let him go through every room say Lord go through every room even once you're going through the attic in my life every area Lord in My Life Cleanse it out Lord because I want this to be a place that you are welcome I just don't want you to visit me once in a while I want you to dwell in my life [Music] Hallelujah now when we see that that's the grounds for Fellowship and to think of how that here we are in this life that we live in it's very much like in Genesis 1 we're in Genesis 1 the Bible said God made man in his own image and in his own likeness and here man was a spirit man now when the Bible says this it says God created male and female so here in the beginning here in in that of the spirit the spirit itself when God made in the beginning then from that he places now Adam or places that into a body of Flesh and then once it's in that body of Flesh once here is Adam dwelling there in that body of Flesh then what does God do God puts Adam to sleep and he opens up his side and he takes from Adam he takes a rib and it begins to multiply cell on top of Sal on top of cell then he takes from the original spirit from that same Spirit God doesn't make another spirit it's the same spirit and he takes from there and he places he separates masculine from feminine and God places that Spirit right into that byproduct or that body of Flesh let me just read it to you how the prophet put it there in paragraph 20 of Oneness he says don't you see the picture we in flesh are different I don't think that takes a rocket scientist to look around this room we're different is that right we're like a bright byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit now this is what's important in spirit we are sons and daughters and not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become sons and daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined in wedlock to the Eternal see how God planned it that we should should be not a different but him not some other being of some other tribe but a real Union and offspring of the almighty done by a holy Union the body comes from mother and father but the spirit come from God God's separating himself as Adam was separated now watch this on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire separating itself and setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together then with that group of people together what does it do now notice with that group of people together not just a group of people together but with that group of people together are you hearing me with that group of people together it brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus coming together he took bread and broke it for you and I he paid the price for you and I his blood was shed for the remission of our sin but as that bread was broken and here it's broke there and it's given out in many pieces what was it you and I were always a part of the bread of the word Hallelujah but we could not assemble ourselves who can bring pieces of bread and bring it back together to where it doesn't look fragmented they're all put together you know if you took bread and broke it up you can't join it back together but we're not talking about a natural bread we're talking about the word we're talking about the body of Jesus Christ we're talking about the supernatural of almighty God that's dwelling and drawing upon pieces of the bread he's drawing on that piece of the bread that seed a promise in your life what is it it's a holy spirit that was in the blood cell what's he doing he is drawing on that part in you that is really him [Music] We Are One bread one party and the Mystery of the Holy Spirit working Among Us is you don't see Fred you don't see the fragmented parts and places but you're seeing the unity of the body of Jesus Christ let me just try to develop this just a moment here in Ephesians 5 23. for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body he gave his life for the body are there others outside of the Lamb's Book that benefit from him giving coming to redeem yes will there be others saved yes but remember that every message to every age is sent with the elect in mind there'll be others that are benefited and are blessed is that right but you see that's why that God even as this works in the hearts of the believer Jesus said no man can come unto me he didn't say no man could be drug unto me pushed unto me pulled unto me no man can come unto me except it was given by my father so what are you saying brother Samuel the assembling of the body of Jesus Christ of the bread is not a work of man yeah the word command produces organization and it displays itself because organization is not under the headship of the holy spirit that unites the people with the word and unites him with the Creed unites him with a dogma and what does it do you see the fragmented bitterness that organization produces that's why in our heart and in our life it is imperative that our walk stay fresh and clean and sweet before God that we do not want to have an organizational life the Samuel Watson organizational life well the prophet said it's simple and is your life worthy of the Gospel a life that fails to walk daily with God Hallelujah I need him I need him I need more of him and not just that I need I want more of him I want more of him less of me all right Colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence Ephesians 4 4 there is one body everybody say that with me there is one body and one Spirit even as ye are called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God and Father of all who is above all through all and in you all First Corinthians 12 verse 12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body oh I love this whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bounder-free God is not looking at nationalities God is not looking at if you were a good person or a bad person all right the Holy Spirit has come to seek and save that which was lost [Music] let me tell you something if we were good then Calvary wasn't needed but the Bible said there is not one who is good no not one we needed the Sovereign Grace of God our righteousness alone would never do it as a matter of fact our righteousness to obtain God's favor he said it's filthy rags when we rest on that instead of resting on I'm doing it to please you Lord that's the difference when God comes in alive we do righteously not out of fear we do righteously because it's a desire within us to please him [Music] Hallelujah Glory Be The God for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body notice baptize not hand shook in it I know these are simple things but it's not name on a book you don't read that is right that's not Bible that's not the gospel a person's name on a book or let me just bring it an affiliation around the message is not enough he did not make a way and send back the Holy Ghost so that you and I could just be affiliated with a pretty good group of people he sent this message to declare to you you were included in my thoughts before the foundation of the world I scared my blood for you and I've sent back the Holy Ghost to draw you you wouldn't even know how to find him I wouldn't know how to find him but he came and he found you and I and let me tell you this morning you might say I'm as lost and lost can be you're not too lost that Jesus can't find you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] God scattered the people across the Earth let me just read this so I don't have to necessarily preach it out of the message Oneness brother Brown said what did he tell Adam and Eve he said go on and multiply and replenish the Earth he scattered the human race all over the Earth so he could deal with them individually until he could bring them back together so the purpose of scattering is so that God might come individually to every life to every heart and then when God comes individually to a life then the work he does there it draws us into the body of Jesus Christ so it's not us making ourselves a part of something it's not us trying to do that listen to me now I believe there's a start in a life it might start with simply you know keeping the scissors off your hair it might start with the men stop acting like sissies and you know everything it can start there has to be a start somewhere but what I'm saying is this don't rely upon that do that because of Grace that has come to you that you realize the word of God teaches better than that are you with me it's not well this is what my church teaches no it's what the Bible says it's not the church that is said let the woman dress in all modesty it's the scripture that said that and the word modest in the scripture first Timothy means free flowing garment in other words anything that takes out all the mystery is an abomination well I don't wear pants but if you wear dresses that take out all the mystery it's still an abomination and you listen I almost got to preach on men anymore you know unless you see these skinny britches they wearing everything else come on listen we are not to pattern after the world [Music] if you pattern after world Listen where is the source of inspiration that has come everything that we do should be decently orderly and Holiness unto the Lord mama he separated so he could deal with this individual deal with us individually now in paragraph 110 brother Graham said God don't deal with the person in a group right right you know that's why sometimes that God's got allow disturbances to come so the family's not walking just as a family upon a family religion well I come to church here because my family come no God wants to meet you individually because you're not saved because your family comes here you're only saved when you know Jesus Christ passionately is that right it doesn't matter how long somebody said around the message they could sit around the message for 50 years and never have met Jesus Christ amen he's a reality it's more than a church life oh friends God's not against us he's for us how miserable it is to live beneath the Privileges now God don't deal with the person in a group he don't deal with you in an organization he deals with you and as an individual sometimes God has to get uh separated not just sometimes he does sometimes you wonder and say well you know it's like how God begins to deal with our lives and what's he doing is a separation that's going on then he might make himself known more when God brought a separation with Abraham first of all he got out of the land where he was not fully but it got closer right then he came in the land and God showed him what he had been talking about but he still had a lot with him but it wasn't until God finally moved by grace that Abraham recognized there's got to be a separation here what God called for all along but now he's separated then God made himself known to Abraham in a greater way remember what Jesus said and he said in his word now let me just let me finish this here he says he deals with you as an individual individually we are baptized with the Holy Ghost collectively we are baptized into the body when we are baptized with the Holy Ghost individually each one baptized with the Holy Ghost God dealing with each one that was his purpose when he scattered them across the Earth so he could deal with them individually and that's where when Jesus could say that I have not come to bring peace on Earth I come to bring a sword and the sword is the word it is the Living Word of God that moves down and it deals with our life and it is that word if we can receive it oh it's tough when God calls for separation it's not something that's just oh that's easy it's it's tough there's a wrestling but think about it it's life we are being called from death into life the sword has come to cut away everything from our lives but if we walk away from what the word is saying then we are declaring and saying Lord this is too much I I can't separate from all this I'm not able to do it but if you'll just yield to him you know your yielding is a separation and it allows the sword of the Lord to go to work in your life and cut everything away that's what that's what my desire that word that word is still cutting there's still a separation that's going on so it's an individual work that goes on in our life and it must be that it must be nothing less than Christ in us the hope of glory this is what Paul would say in Colossians 1 27 to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus that's why the Gospel of Jesus Christ The Living Word is sent to be preached it is the good news it is the Declaration as it's recorded in the book of Isaiah how beautiful are the feet of them who bring Tidings Glad Tidings of peace and one of those glad patings of Peace our god reigns but no matter what it is that you're setting in your life let me announce to you this morning our god reigns he's greater than that in your life he's greater than that sin he's greater than that way he's greater our god reigns [Applause] Hallelujah and that call it moves it draws upon our heart let me tell you something you are a blessed people to fill the pool the call and to yield to his voice so there's nothing else that God accepts outside of Christ and you remember down in Egypt they had to take the lamb slay it and they had to put the blood is that right without the blood it didn't matter how how much Israel like they were when the death angel came by it only recognized the blood and the blood was a sign death has already come to this home there's been one that has died in the stead of another oh Hallelujah that's what the sign the token sign the Seal of the Holy Ghost in our life it shows there is one who has died from me there is one who has come from me and I am his subject redeemed saved although the howling Winds of Darkness are all around but I am saved in God's Pavilion in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion He Shall Set me upon a rock now shall mine head be lifted out above my enemies and I will sing the Praises and sacrifices of Joy why because he has done this for me Hallelujah Glory it's God's own life personally coming and moving and vindicating in our lives moving it's God vindicating his word it's not that's why it's not just it's not just the Holy Spirit around our life the Holy Spirit comes remember the Sun the rain what does the Sun and rain come to do it doesn't come for the weeds do the weeds benefit from it yes the weeds grow just like the wheat but the sun and the rain has come to bring what quickening and life to the seed that was there let me tell you you're not a terror you're not a weed preach with me now you know you can you're not getting that from God there is a hunger in your heart listen the Bible said blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness who put that in you God put that in you Sunday school never put it in you a pastor never put it in you God put that in you what was it that was a part of the bread that was in the mind of God from the foundation of the world and he was broken apart he was separated from God he died as a sinner [Music] my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he forsook I'm quoting now he forsook his sonship that he might take Sinners and make Sons out of them [Music] [Applause] he who knew no sin became my sin that we might not become be made creation the righteousness of God in Christ sir Brianna go to paragraph 484 in Christ the mystery please his presence in the individual with a personal Vindication of himself expressing himself The Living Word that's promised for the day expressing itself through you a Vindication of the great revelation of God look only in an individual never in a group an individual not in a group his identification is with an individual he says you get that do we get that not a group it's an individual it's not me and Mama no it's got to be you and Jesus not me Daddy and Mama know it's got to be you and Jesus well me and my family it's got to be you and Jesus [Applause] well me and my wife know it's got to be you and Jesus not with the Methodist not with the Baptist not with the Presbyterian not the Lutheran not the Pinnacle you see when they take and say this we're all to come together in a great Oneness and we see the economical Council of churches oh we're just all one they don't agree on nothing the only thing that there's an agreement amongst them is the three chord of that water baptism in the name a father Son and Holy Ghost which is the same name that the witches call out come on you know I'm preaching the truth because listen he is not he is he manifests his titles but it is the same almighty God that has become flesh there is one Lord one faith [Applause] everybody if you know like brother Branham says if they would this let their mind loose a little bit to think God ain't a schizophrenic oh yeah yeah well you know we believe it's one God and three persons what it's one God manifesting himself in three offices I'm the son of James and Pat Browning when I go up and hang and hug my mama I don't say hey honey hi sweetheart no that's in the office of husband to my wife but when I go to my boys I don't go over to them and say hey Honey Sweetie Pie I go over them and say hey buddy all of my buddy hey buddy but you know what that's a different office am I a different person no I'm the same person all the time I'm just being revealed or revealing in the offices that were already in me yeah Hallelujah now notice this individuality it's a scripture notice it must be an individual walk I'll take one and leave one I'll separate them remember Luke 20 Luke 17 and Matthew and and Matthew there there'll be two in the field talking about the Rapture there'll be two in the field I'll take one and leave one there'll be two in bed I'll take one and leave one hello somebody so it's not a group catching away it's individuals that have been caught away already have already been joined to Jesus Christ in a real relationship and that's what he's coming after it's not about my location it's not about who I'm associated with it's about who are you United with is he the Lord of your life it's not a group it's a personal Vindication of a pregnant child of God filled with the Holy Ghost so surrendered to God that he don't care about anything else you say a pregnated child of God yeah because the Holy Spirit just don't fall upon upon upon the children of God and just leaves but the Holy Spirit comes it is God's own life that's coming to the betting ground and let me tell you the betting ground we didn't Supply it because if we supplied it we would have something to say about our Resurrection but God has supplied the seed God supplied the bed and grain remember there the Bible talks about a sorrow went forth to sow and there was four types of ground but there was some good ground and the prophet in this hour identified the good ground as the pre-prepared ground that was prepared by God that it's not you and I recognizing God but it is that part on the inside of us and I hope you understand what I'm saying when it's not you and I it's not the outer man that's recognizing God it's the inner man that's being awakened by the presence of almighty God and the Holy Spirit living its life because when a life is pregnated what do you have to do when that life has been pregnated you cater to the life that's on the inside right that's why the Doritos with chocolate milk and the pickles and the honey go get me some you know Ritz crackers with this on them and you know go do this and go do that and you know I want this kind of ask him all right I want this you know I got a taste for this I got what are you doing you're catering to the life that's on the inside all right you might check brother Samuel we know our kids we don't have kids we're all growing out of the house and I still got to do that yeah you're right about that one but there's a life that's on the inside and what you're doing is there's a that life is what's calling for certain nutrients do you realize that it's you you in your life that which is in you that is actually calling out to God and God directing the officers in the body of Jesus Christ to minister the nutrients that you and I have need of it's not us going after nutrients it's God that's supplying the manna that we have need of that's why we're not just coming to church and we just roll into church and praise God I made it to church we're coming here I have a need from you Lord daily give me this day my daily bread Lord you Lord God and the Holy Spirit with its life pulsating through US showing itself and the people to the world and let me just try to bring this down here not going to get to where we looking at but I'll get to a place a good stopping point here here Paul deals with Ephesians 3 and 8. and now here has this assembling of this body together of this bride together remember all came out of Egypt many came out of Egypt but there was also a mixed multitude that came up right and remember God would have wiped everything out but there was elect in there and the life of the promise God's own life that was in Moses called out for the people who was that that was God it shows that the Word of Promise in our lives is in a toner are you with me it atones it covereth the multitude are you hearing me now this is the Life of Christ working in the body for what for the greater for for the body for for the cause for the purpose if God would have wiped them all out remember what Moses told him who was it how could a man have have a greater idea than God it couldn't be it wasn't Moses had a better idea than God it was God in Moses Christ in Moses expressing back the promise of the word because he's not a man that he should lie God God don't have to repent are you with me all his words are true in amen and here God said it you don't bring them in then the rest of them are going to say you brought them out but you weren't able to take them in you weren't able to keep your word is that right what happened God can't cross his own word you got a need that's why you put the word right there before God lord there's a need right here in my life put the word before him he'll come down and honor his word young person put the word before him Lord this is a promise you made to me I didn't ask you if you felt worthy I'm asking you does the word mean something to you and if the word means something to you say Lord this is a promise you made to me and there's a craving for this promise in my life now God's spared now there were those who were in the initial instigating of it and they were removed right you see that each time but then here you still have the mixed multitude but there was a Joshua and a Caleb the whole time I'm asking you what was it was it a group that took the land it was individuals individuals had to decide that they wanted that they this is what did Caleb say Caleb kindly came to a place when he got over there he said hey all the rest of this inheritance been divided out isn't it amazing that calebs was not given first you know why because it's speaking of you and I in this hour give me my mountain Faith patience virtue give me my mountain give me my Mountain where the streams of Grace flow down to the bottom give me my Mountain the mountain that the word promise a full stature of Jesus Christ give me my mountain why because the bride coming into a full completion reflects that City oh glory be to God Hallelujah this is why Paul could write and he could say verse 9 of Ephesians 3. to make all men see what is the fellowship of this mystery well brother Brandon stops right there and he says will all men see it no no no to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God I love that I love that what is the Church of the Living God it's the manaphone the variegated the variety the manifold wisdom of God what is the wisdom of God it's his life it's a revelation of himself see God when this manifold wisdom here we are from all different walks of life remember for by one Spirit are we baptized into one body by one Spirit have we all been made to drink do all kinds of different nationalities different backgrounds dear all all of our temperaments our makeups some people like things quiet some things like noisy some it all different things but it comes down to when a life has been joined in a union with God then through that it is part of the body of Jesus Christ then it is that of the manifold of the wisdom of God it's God reflecting his life through a many membered body you realize a real diamond when they'd known to know what a real diamond is they look to the heart of it and if there's that fire that's there on the inside it's it's really a certain color of a matter that's there on the inside but what comes out of that that real diamond it reflects into many different colors and that's how God is in his body not a fragmented people not a divided people but a people that are one not by a church not by being Under One Roof not by just associating with the same Pastor or we believe the problem we believe God sent a prophet or it's it's something that's personal to you we may have come with our parents we may have been around it for a period of time but it had to come a time when it becomes personal to you to where that you meet Jesus Christ in a person where there's a a moving within your heart then it becomes Christ in your life and this is why brother Brahma says and I close here he says it's Christ and Christ the mystery it's Christ expressing himself in the individual whether he's intellectual or whether he don't even know his ABCs what matters is that it's Christ in you doesn't matter if you sweet you and I see everything alike that's not what matters what matters is Christ in US that's what's important are you hearing me Christ in you the hope of glory are you with me that's what matters is that we've been born again of the spirit of God that brings us there into one bread one body we've got one purpose then we've got one heart we've got one mind there's one desire I want to see him glorified I want to seem glorified in my life I want to seem glorified in your life I want to seem glorified in the life of his body oh the testimonies we hear and you hear this so the Lord did this to me or the Lord did this for me or the Lord moved here oh praise God God God Drew This Heart praise God it's God working in his body oh my I say glory be to God this right here paragraph 240 Brianna the new birth is Christ a revelation that's what it is it's a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth not listen friends not just the message is the truth you've got to know what's truth and give yourself to it remember what we've been looking at on principles of Deliverance sell all thou the rest of the pearls for the pearl of great price you're willing to let go of everything else because we have found him hallelujah oh my right now what are you going to do I love this what are you going to do when you get all that group together I love this where the revelation is perfectly in harmony I really would like to start preaching here but I can't notice where the Revelation is perfectly in harmony when we when the Revelation is perfectly in Harmony in US and we giving ourselves to him in us than what he's able to do exceedingly abundantly where brother Samuel my opinions but when we see and allow the Revelation to work perfectly we begin to realize my opinions can either hinder or I can let them be put behind me for what reason for the body of Jesus Christ because it's about the body it's the body it's about the body I'm a part of that body you're part of that body part of that bread one bread one body he was broken that we might be United he was separated that we could be joined together not by our intellects because even if you and I sat down enough long enough we'll we'll probably see things that we will see we may disagree a little bit on something but there's something greater than our intellects right here the Bible never said in Acts 4 that they were joined together in their heads it said they were of one mind and one heart and the Bible said one soul it was God moving in his church and everything that was done was for the benefit of the body to me oh I know there's a song we don't sing in here but probably some of you heard it oh the beautiful body of Jesus Christ rising from Death unto life Oh what a beautiful body the body of Jesus Christ that which he has shed his blood and redeemed he has drawn us to himself he has cleansed Our Lives and imparted his life to us that's why he means so much to you are you hearing me that's why he means so much to you you want to know where you stand what's your desire in your heart what's your desire in your heart you say my desire David said one thing have I desired and that's the only thing I do hear everything else every decision is based on will it help that desire or will it hinder it one thing have I desired and that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life Hallelujah he is my desire he is my life if my mind or my my thoughts are anything it gets sidetracked there is Grace that comes to us and he ministers to our heart and says hey hey that which you feel is a little bit out of Step a little bit of missing there in your life what is it it's me come walk with me Heavenly Father Lord here we stand this morning one bread one body Lord we as you've made it so clear so real to us Lord right here in these moments it's not because the Lord that we are acquainted with this message it's not because we come here to church it's not because of the family that we are in but God it's because we have become a part of you and Lord I pray I know you come Lord and you make things so simple for us your desire is that there would be a relationship and Lord that relationship in our life god with the indwelling of your own presence Lord and Father Here We Stand Lord as Paul would describe the church the manifold wisdom of God Lord we're all in our own makeup our temperaments our Lord and nationalities on and on we could go with different families there's so many differences in that John Saul a bride of many kindreds nations and tongues but what he saw was the bride she had on as Lord Brother Branham would describe it the Garb that of the clothing that would signify that of that of that nation that she's come out of Lord Kindred in tongue but it is the bride it is you that God has sent your word like you sent letters through all the provinces there together Lord all of those virgin women into the palace Lord to shushan Lord and Esther came in there many came but God it was Esther that in the moment of that time she submitted herself to the king's Chamberlain whatsoever he said regarding her life she had a choice what she wanted to wear to go before the king but she deferred her choice and she took the council of the king's Chamberlain Lord we defer our choice to the Holy Spirit you know you know just what we have need of It's You Lord that's dressing the bride and getting this bride ready it's you Lord it's not us taking our own ways our own ideas but it's you working in a very personal way Lord you said in your word that no man can come to me except it be given to him and I will draw him Lord I pray this morning Lord with that drawing power of the Holy Spirit May the lives and hearts Lord this morning if there's one that fills that drawing and says Lord I want to go deeper Lord I want Lord I Want More Of You Lord just in every area and every part of my life I want to go deeper Lord father even through this congregation this morning Lord there's a desire that moves within the heart of the believer I want to go deeper Lord I pray that you would just just give us the grace that Lord that revelation to work perfectly in harmony it's a continual dying to ourselves Lord it's an individual walk and we're part of a body as well Lord when they took the land when they crossed over they defeated Jericho as a unit and when they lost in AI they they failed in that battle all of Israel failed but it was because of one individual that let down but God you came and you dealt and you moved in a very special way because your word will not return to your Void may we Lord take it as the prophet placed it so clearly to us that our walk with you not only Lord God is individually but also recognizing the body that we are a part of help us Lord I pray God as one bread one body Lord that manifold wisdom of God on display in our lives granted Lord I pray May Our Lives be lived to the glory of almighty God granted Lord there's healing in the body there's Deliverance Lord in the body oh God their salvation Lord there's liberty Lord granted Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ amen you love him amen hallelujah amen let's stand if you would hallelujah amen praise the Lord that paid my way oh my God [Music] down from the cross my sins were gone my sin

pieces off your life in order to reveal who you really are so every piece and everything he deals with your life what I do Let It Go because that peace is not the image that he's trying to bring forth in your life just let the sword of the word move through you and say Lord let me just reflect that image that you had in your mind maybe it's in that stage in your life right now where you're not
