And quicken that Jean seed in your heart to life. Oh my, what a day. Amen. And and it's just good to be in the house of the Lord. What a tremendous atmosphere of worship this evening. I thank you musicians. Thank you, brother Paul, for the music and just so enjoyed that worship and always do. Amen. And it's just good to be with you. Amen. We appreciate brother Samuel very much for the confidence, the opportunity to be here and we just pray the Lord bless him. Amen. Where he's at tonight and we just sure appreciate your pastor very much and feels just feels just like home away from home and so many familiar faces and brother Dave back there, brother Brian, all the friends and family. We just appreciate all of you so very much. Amen. If you have your Bibles, we'll turn straight to the word tonight in the book of Exodus, chapter 32. Let's pray the Lord give us grace. And may have a little bit of a some reading. So, we just pray that Lord will just pick it up and use it in some way. Amen. And we'll start in the verse 24 and uh we'll we'll back around here a little bit after we read this. But it says, "And I said unto them, whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me that I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. And when Moses saw that the people were naked, for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies." Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said,"Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come unto me." And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together unto him. And he said unto them, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor." And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about 3,000 men. For Moses had said, "Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, even every man upon his son and upon his brother, that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day." And it came to pass on the tomorrow that Moses said unto the people, "Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up unto the Lord, pervententure. I shall make an atonement for your sin." And Moses returned unto the Lord and said this, "Oh, this people have sinned a great sin and have made them gods of gold. Yet now if thou wilt forgive their sin, and if not blot me, I pray thee out of thy book which thou hast written." And the Lord said unto Moses, "Whosoever hast sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee, behold, mine angel shall go before thee. Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them." And the Lord plagued the people because they made the calf which Aaron made. Amen. If we could bow our heads for a word of prayer. If you have a need tonight, just make it known unto the Lord. Amen. I believe he's a God that hears and answers. Heavenly Father, we approach your throne tonight, Lord Jesus, humbly, Father, yet boldly, Lord Jesus, because you went to Calvary, Father, and you shed a blood for our sins, Lord, that we might come back into fellowship with you, Lord Jesus. And Lord, it gives us a boldness in your our heart tonight, Father, that under that blood, we can approach you and ask, Father, and tell you how much we love you, Father, and tell tell you how much we appreciate you, Lord. And and tell you how thankful we are for all that you've done for us, Lord, and all that you're doing and all that you're going to do. and ask, Father, that you would just be the same yesterday, today, and forever once again in our needs, Lord Jesus. That you just minister once again to our hearts, Father. Lord, that you just come into the midst of your children once again. I pray and we'll be sure to give you the glory and honor in Jesus name. Amen. And amen. And you may have your seats tonight in the house of the Lord. And we just we just we're just trying not to hold you long tonight. I know it's a midweek and we just like to speak for a few moments out of that text on who is on the Lord's side. Amen. Who is on the Lord's side? And just a background for a few moments of of where we're at, the children of Israel. Of course, when when the Lord met Moses in a burning bush on Mount Horeb, he had promised them that when [snorts] they were brought out of Exodus that they would return to this mountain and serve God upon this mountain and and so uh uh he brought them out of Egypt. He carried them through the Red Sea and fed them mana, gave them water to drink and and as he promised, they returned to this mount. And now Mount Si and Mount Horeb would be the same mountain. And in the book of Psalms 106, it even says they made a calf in Horeb using that same name there. So showing that they returned to that same mountain and that he promised them that they would return and worship. And in Exodus 19, they came onto that mountain. And brother Brandham said that was where they made the greatest mistake they would ever make was in Exodus 19 when they began to the to the the that God that had brought him out of Egypt by grace. Grace had provided them a prophet. Grace had provided them Amen. mana. Grace had provided them spiritual leadership and all these things. But yet they wanted a law. They wanted something that they could do themselves. They wanted something of their own, something that they could follow. Amen. something of of of maybe uh rules and regulations. And when they rejected grace for law, brother Bram said how that was the greatest mistake that they made there right there in Exodus 19 and and in in some time I'd like to speak or or take some thoughts upon a mountain of grace showing that how that there they had went at Mount Si they had went from grace to law. Amen. But there was coming a day, of course, where our savior would come on Mount Calvary and begin to flip the script back from law onto a people could receive a grace to save their sins and to pardon them. And amen, that it wouldn't be based upon our our rules and regulations, but upon the blood that he shed at Mount Calvary. [snorts] Amen. But for that time, it became a throne of judgment. Because in Exodus 19 it would say how there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud so that all that was in the camp trembled. And and brother Brandon would tie that together with Revelations 4, how John was caught up and a door was open. And it said immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne and out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices. Sounds familiar, doesn't it? Amen. Showing how Moses, brother Brand would say, how he was caught up in the spirit and how he saw the same thing that John saw. And he said in Revelations 4, that throne was after the rapture had taken place. It was no longer a throne of mercy, but it was a throne of judgment. Amen. And and when Moses was up in that mount, it was no longer a mercy, but it was becoming a throne of judgment. And Moses would be caught up in the spirit and lightnings and thunderings would take place and he would begin to see a vision, amen, of how to build the tabernacle in the wilderness and how to do all these things. And if you notice, amen, he built the tabernacle just like the pattern he saw of the throne of God in heaven. He just like the four beasts would be seated around the throne in heaven. Moses would build a temple, amen, with those four those four sides with the eagle, the man, the ox, and a and and all of those creatures just like he saw in heaven. And I I I thought it was so wonderful because he was commanded to build on earth exactly after the pattern he saw in heaven. I thought my amen to see how God shows things in heaven before he does them on earth. Brother Brandon would teach that how how how before God would ever do any major event on earth, he would show it in the heavens. And a and we can see how John saw, amen, that there would be a lamb that would be slain before the foundation of the world. But one day that lamb came and was slain here on earth and how there would be someone that could come and take the book and and and in the 1963 when brother Brandon was standing there, he said, "Let him come forth." Amen. But it was patterned in heaven before it ever happened on earth. And I I I I I just think it's a wonderful thing. Maybe it's a little side note from where we're going tonight, but to think my all the wonderful things that have happened in heaven. How Job shouted. Amen. How there was sons of God shouting before the foundation of the world. And here we are tonight. Amen. Shouting and praising and worshiping. Amen. And serving a living God. Amen. Sure, there was angels that fell in heaven. Amen. But there was some angels that never fell. Amen. Which is telling me that tonight, Amen. Sure, there's some spirits that have fell, amen, out of heaven. But there's some angel spirits and sons and daughters of God tonight that never fell in heaven. Oh, I say it's in earth as it was in heaven. Amen. God has set forth a pattern and we're living it out. Amen. Tonight as a pattern of what's taking place in heaven. And I'm thankful that we've seen the back of the book. Amen. We've seen the pattern. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know, I mean, we know where we're at. And and it was so wonderful to me to see how Moses was seeing what John saw, what Paul saw in that vision. And he begin to build the temple, build that throne in the temple there in the wilderness after what he saw up in the mount. And while he was up there in the mount for 40 days, he was getting the commandments from God. And and one of those commandments was, "Thou shalt have no other gods before me. And thou shalt not make any graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in the heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them. Now serve them. For I, the Lord thy God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me." [snorts] A and it would say in Exodus 22, he that sacrificeth unto any god save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed. And and while Moses was in the mountain, he there was a there was a constant theme of don't bow down to these other gods. And but yet when he begins to come off the mountain, what does he see, brother Aaron? Except he hears the noise in the camp and and all these things are going on. And Joshua says, "There's the sound of war in the camp." And and Moses would say, "It don't sound like war. It sounds like singing and dancing and all these things." And he would come to find that they had convinced Aaron to build them a golden calf. Amen. A a calf in the image of maybe an Egyptian god or maybe in the image of some god of Baal or or or some other some other god that was not the the Jehovah God that had brought them out of Egypt and brought them through the Red Sea and they begin to worship. Moses was only gone for a few days. Amen. But they begin to cast away, Amen, the voice of Moses and begin to worship other gods. Amen. A and melted all their jewelry and put it into that into that great casting. Uh and it would it would spit out a cow. And they would say, "We throw this gold in and this calf appeared. This calf just appeared. We just we just threw this gold. We took off." And all of a sudden, this calf appeared. and they begin to worship it. Amen. And in and the book of Psalms would said that they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass and they forgot God their savior which had done great things in Egypt, wondrous works in the land of Ham and terrible things by the Red Sea. Therefore he said that that he would destroy them had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them. Amen. They had turned the glory that they had once served in the similitude of an ox that eateth grass. And brother Brandon would preach onto us Christianity versus idolatry and say how people would would have a desire to be forgiven of their sins and to and to contact a deity. And so they would make an image believing that that deity could condescend into that image and they could speak and that image could speak back and they could be forgiven of their sins and they could be set free and they could actually hear. I forget what he said now but I think they would speak at times into some sort of shell or something and their own voice would echo back to them and they would say that they were hearing from another deity, the god of the sea or something like that. And so, Brother Brandon would say it was exactly the antitype of Christianity because Christianity is when you prostrate yourself before a living God. And that God comes into you and makes you an idol. Makes you a living image. Amen. He comes into you and he speaks through your lips and he operates through your hands and he operates through your feet. And they had that in a prophet named Moses. They said, "We don't want to hear from God anymore, so we'll hear through his prophet." And God used the prophets, amen, but when his prophet was up on the mountain, they would say, "Let's build us an idol." Amen. That we might worship that instead. And and what a horrible thing it was. Even so much that later on in scripture, Amen. Dan and Ephraim would serve idols. Amen. Which God hated. and they would actually be blotted out of the book that when it come over to the age of the millennium that those 10 tribes, Amen, would be substituted with Levi and Joseph instead of Dan and Ephraim because they served idolatry. Amen. Brother Bran would say how it began in Babylon and it'll end in Babylon. It's idolatry. But in the midst of that, Moses stood up and said, "Who is on the Lord's side?" I mean, who will stand for me and God? Brother Brandham said, "In the days when sin was in the camp, when Balam taught the people to sin, [gasps] Moses said, "Who will stand for me and God and Levi pulled his sword said we will stand for you?" And they took that sword and cut every sin out of the camp and God made the rest of them pay tithes to them and they became the priesthood. And he said, "So is it today God is looking for somebody who will take the sword of the word. Some people is afraid to say those things." He said, "Don't be afraid. God before you, who can be against you? It's time that the church stood in its place again and cut sin. Jesus will come Sunday and there will be a rapture. Those who stand for him now, he will stand for them then. You love him. Oh, how I love him. I think my what about a prophet's cry that would say, you know, we've come this far. We've journeyed this far and here you are worshiping idols. and how a prophet, no doubt very disappointed and frustrated, would cry out, "Who is on the Lord's side? Is there anybody that's on the Lord's side? Is there anybody, Amen, that is tired of this idol worship and we should have left that in Egypt? We come out of all of that and here you are worshiping idols again. Is there anybody that is on the Lord's side?" I I think how Elijah got in a similar position when he was fighting against that Jezebel religion and he would say, "I'm the only one left and they're seeking to kill my life. It's only me." Amen. I'm the only one left standing. A and to think about how our prophet and and when it come up to this day and he was standing against those denominational spirits and a a and they crowded around the first pool and the second pool. But when he tried to bring the opening of the word unto them, they would walk away and and go back into their idols and go back into their denominations. And amen, no wonder the cry of a prophet would cry out, "Who is on the Lord's side?" Is there anybody left, Amen, that is willing, Amen, to stand for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God, there was always an elect, amen, in each age to respond to the cry to stand for the word. And the Bible says that that the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And there fell of the people that day about 3,000 men. Amen. There when Moses made the cry, there were some sons of Levi that responded to that cry. Amen. And they said, "We will follow your mo words, Moses. We will stand for that which you have spoken." And and brother Brandon would teach us. Someone asked them a question about the 144,000 and the bride and things and questions and answers number one, 1954. And he begins to answer them, beginning to separate the difference between the bride and the 144,000. And he begins to show how you have to look back to see the types and how the types would point to Calvary and things. And he just begins to answer them and bring it out. And in that questions and answers, he would begin to say, "Hallelujah. If you can see what that temple was, that Levites was the bride." It says, "Now when sin is awakening on every hand, the Levites is pulling their swords. The Holy Ghostborn bride is standing out saying Jesus Christ in the positive is Jesus Christ in the negative." Just the same. Sin is still sin. It's wrong to do these things. That's right. They're standing there with the sword. God says, "Come you now, the bless blessed of my father, that is the bride." And he said, "How those Levites stood for the word and they went into the temple and the others would serve them." Amen. Just like this bride will reign with him on the throne. Amen. In the 144,000 and the others will come and serve the bride. And he begin to show you have to look at the types to see where you're at to see who you are in this day because those were only pointing to this day. Amen. And to show, Amen. that those that are on the Lord's side would stand in each age. And just like in the days of an Elijah when he would cry out, God would tell him, "No, you're not alone. There's 7,000 others that are not going to bow their knee to that bell Jezebel religion, but they're going to stand for the word. Oh my. A and and brother Brandon would begin to speak an indictment. Amen. Now we're bringing it up to our day. The Levites are the bride. Is that right? And he says, I say it on this tape and for this audience. I say this under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost who is on the Lord's side. Let him come under this word. God will surely bring this wicked Christ denying Christ rejecting generation into judgment for blasphemy the crucifixion of his identified word they are coming to the judgment I indicted it who is on the Lord's side said Moses let him come unto me when the pillar of fire hanging there as an evidence who is on the Lord's side let him take up the word deny his creed and follow Jesus Christ daily and I'll meet you in [snorts] the morning amen Brother Brandon begins to indict this generation of denominations that had rejected Jesus Christ. Amen. Just like, Amen, they had done. Amen. In in his first coming and he begins to make a call, who is on the Lord's side? Let him come under this word. Amen. Because there was a lot of people that maybe, Amen, were friendly to brother Brandon, but not willing to come under the word. Not real, not willing to really come under the message. Amen. Amen. And that's what brother Brandham taught us. He said, "Don't just say, "I believe it." Don't just talk about the token, but get under the token. Get under the message and let it become headship over your life and stand for the word. Amen. Amen. That's why we are under a Nazerite vow today. Just like Moses told him after he was vindicated with a pillar of fire, he would say, "Don't you add or take away from the words that I spoken unto you." And brother Brandon would say, "So say I unto you. Don't you add or take away from what those tapes say." Amen. But you just say what's on those tapes. Amen. You just stand for this word. Amen. Just put your life under this word. Amen. And you'll be blessed. Oh my. Who's on the Who is willing to stand the reproach? Because Brother Bram said, "God's anointed word has always bore an approach." &gt;&gt; A reproach. Amen. But it says, "Blessed are ye when men shall hate you and shall separate you from their company and reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the son of man's sake." Cuz you see, there'd be many spirits that would try to come against amen that prophet's message. Amen. That's why, Amen, Moses. Amen. There was many spirits in that day. Amen. But but we see the types. Amen. And just like there was sin in the camp in that day, we see that there would be sin in the camp today. But just like there was a Levite to stand then, there will be an overcomer to stand in this day. Amen. With the message of the hour. And if you can ever see your type in the scripture, I mean, it'll liberate you to know, I mean, who you are and and where you're where you came from and and what you're going to play out in scripture if you can ever see who you are. And so we see that spirits never die. Amen. The same spirits that were alive in that Exodus are alive in this Exodus and they never die. And so we can look back in scripture and see the things that they would have to stand against in that day and know that we're going to have to stand against those same things to this day. Is that right? And and brother Bram said, "In the days when sin was in the camp, when Balam taught the people to sin, Moses said, "Who will stand for me and God?" Amen. And and so we see there was a Balum in that day. Amen. And there was a What was the difference between Balam and Moses? Amen. Balam was just as fundamental as Moses was. Thank you, brother. Balam was just as fundamental as Moses was. It says that he built seven altars just like Moses did. Amen. But it says he was a formal worshipper. He was formal just like Cain was. And brother Brandham actually called him the second Cain. Amen. Because it was I mean spirits never die. And the same spirit that was on Cain had come on Balum. And and he knew Amen. what was right. Amen. But he hated those people that were anointed. And so he refused. Amen. But he was under a different headship than Moses was. Though he was a prophet, but he was following the orders of Baal. I mean, that would say, "Go down and curse him. Go down and put a curse upon him." But being a prophet, when he got under the anointing, it would only speak the truth. And so, he couldn't curse what God had blessed. Amen. And I'm so thankful, Amen, that even the devil, Amen, cannot curse what God has blessed. Amen. If God has put a blessing over your life, Amen. Satan doesn't have enough power to curse it. Amen. But time after time, Bailac would get frustrated because Balam would go forth and only prophesy blessings over those children of Israel. Amen. But he he knew better than to even go down there because the Lord had told him, "Don't go." And the angel had stood in the way to stop him. But Balam was jealous and stubborn and went down there anyway. [laughter] Amen. Brother Brandham would tell us, "If you want to see another Balam, look at Nicodemus." Amen. Because he would say, "Thou art the Christ." And we know you're a man sent from God. Amen. They knew better, but they didn't have, [laughter] Amen, it in them to stand for the word in that day. They knew better. Amen. But they couldn't separate the difference. Amen. between the wheat, in between the shuck, because they couldn't have enough eyesab to see that that was the living word in their midst enough to take a stand for it. Amen. But they would they would come against it and crucify it and and jealous of it and hate it just like Cain did, [laughter] just like Balam did. Amen. But but what was the difference between Balam and Moses was Moses was identified by God. Moses was a scriptural prophet and being a scriptural prophet, he would only stay with the word. Amen. As you would hear brother Brandham say, is not a prophet a divine interpreter of the word. Amen. But Balum, brother Brandham would say that the prophecy of Balum was correct, but his teaching was altogether wrong. And it was the teaching of Balum, Amen, that would begin to corrupt the minds of the people in that day. Amen. And what Balam's teachings were, Amen. Amen. We'll boil it down to the core thought was that we are all the same. Amen. And and we are all the same. And even in the book of Revelations to the Pergamus age, it would say, I have a few things against thee because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balum. And in second Peter 2, it would talk about those that have forsaken the right way and are gone astray following the way of Balum. Amen. showing that that Balum teaching, Amen, would be a wicked and adulterous thing that would lead them into a trap. Amen. Saying we are we are all the same. Let us unite. We're all the same. Amen. We all believe that there's a God. We all believe this and that. We're all the same. Amen. But they couldn't see the difference. Amen. And it would go as far Amen. Amen. Just bear with me. We'll Amen. We're just laying the foundation here. But it would go as far as onto the feast of Bior where Balam would say, "Well, if I can't curse them, then I'll get them to commit adultery that God will have to judge them for their sins." And they begin to send out invitations saying, "Come to this feast and then come and celebrate." And those Israelites had been to feast before. So they thought, "It would be okay. What's really wrong? After all, it's fellowship. We're supposed to get along with one another. Amen. It's just a It's just a feast. Amen. But he said, "Oh my." Brother Brandham would say it wasn't so simple. It wasn't so innocent when those Moab women would begin to get out and dance in front of them and those Israelite men would begin to commit fornication with the daughters of Moab. Amen. And brother Brandon would say it was the same spirit how Constantine would want to build his kingdom so he would have a nine council. And brother Brand would say those true believers were there, but they had no business going to that meeting. And when they and they ended up leaving, but he said they had no business being there in the first place. Amen. Because Constantine was trying to get everybody to come under the same teaching. Amen. And it may not have been natural fornication, but it was spiritual fornication. And brother Brandon would say that fornication is the same spirit. Amen. as organized religion because they come under the guise, amen, of unity and fellowship. Amen. But the Bible says, "How can two walk together except they be agreed?" Amen. And when those children of Israel were going through the wilderness on their journey, they were going to pass by Esau's mountain in Moab's land. And brother Brandon would say, "But don't you stop there because that's not your inheritance." Amen. They would could I mean, they could say, "Whoa." I mean, we've tasted of denominations. It's not so bad. But brother Brandham said, "No." Amen. Your inheritance is Jacob's mountain and it lays beyond the river. Amen. Don't stop. Don't fuss with them. Don't argue with them. Don't turn to the right or the left. But just keep walking with Moses because he's taken you somewhere greater. Amen. Than Esau's mountain. Oh, I said don't join up with them. Amen. If they were predestined to go across the river, they would have joined. Amen. But that was not their inheritance. So you can't make all the Lutheran see it. And you can't make all the Baptists see it. Amen. But you which have eyes to see, you which have ears to hear, you which have something in your heart, a deep calling to the deep. Amen. That's what caused you to go past the denominational churches and led you amen into Jordan's land into the land of inheritance into the message of the hour because there was something in you that wasn't satisfied with taking sides. Amen. With just a creed or a dogma, amen, or just a watered down just seeing religion but said, "As for me in my house, there is an inheritance beyond the river. I've taken sides with the message of the hour and it's carrying me farther than the denominations would ever take me. Oh, you could walk with them far enough. But there'll come a day where the eagle had to leave the chicken yard and say, "The message is calling me farther. The message is calling me higher. And I have stake my claim." Amen. [snorts] With that pillar of fire, wherever it leads, that's where I'll go. Amen. I'm not going to put my tent pegs down. Amen. Where that pillar of fire goes, brother Ben, we're moving with it. &gt;&gt; Oh, we're not going to put a period on it. That's why brother Brandham, Amen, he was not a Bum, but he was a Moses and he couldn't take sides with those denominations. He would say, I I'll take sides with all of them. Amen. I I but but he wasn't taking sides with him under the headship, Amen. [snorts] of Rome. But he was taking sides with them, Amen. that if they could come under the headship of the word, then we can have fellowship. Amen. [snorts] Because if two can't be agreed, how can they walk together? Amen. That's why we don't have to go to the same church to walk together. Amen. We don't have to be under a pope to walk together. Amen. But if you'll just get under the message of the hour, Amen. We can have fellowship everything under the blood. Amen. We can have fellowship. Amen. Amen. That's why it's a dangerous thing. Amen. when the devil tries to sew seeds of fellowship. Amen. That are trying to lead you away from the word of the hour. Oh, because that feast of Belpor and Moses would cry out slay every one of them. And then one Israelite brought a Moab woman back with them to the camp and they began to walt in the camp with his Moabitete woman. And there was a Levite by the name of Phineas. I don't know how to pronounce it, but he grabbed a spear and went into the tent and thrust him through and stayed the wrath of God from that camp. Oh, thank God. There was a Levite. [laughter] Amen. That wasn't willing to put up with all of that nonsense and idolatry, but said that will not come into this camp. Amen. This is a camp for the Lord. Amen. We're under a pillar of fire in this camp. Oh, and brother Brandon would say there's another Balum system rising up together. Amen. Amen. But Amen. But brother Brandon would not yoke himself to any of that. &gt;&gt; But he would take sides with Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's why you got to be careful what you take sides with. &gt;&gt; Because brother Brandon would say, "Amen, [snorts] that you are not of them. You are not. They're denominational people, which is all right. Nothing against them. There's plenty of fine Christians out among them. But you oughten to associate yourself in that unbelieving groups." Now, there's a spirit out there that doesn't like that at all. Amen. It's all about love and fellowship and and and everyone bring them all together. But brother Ram said, "We are not the same." Amen. You are a separated people holy onto the Lord. And there's a group out there, amen, that deny the power thereof. And brother Brandham said, "You're not to take sides with them." Amen. But in the message, I will restore. He said, "When the Holy Ghost comes down, I won't moan and groan and take sides against it, I'll agree with it and frolic with it and live with it and speak with it and sing with it and shout with it and die with it. Hallelujah." Because we've taken sides with Jesus. That's why we're in agreement with the spirit of God moving in the church because it's Jesus. Amen. Did not that spirit speak to those disciples on the water, it is I be not afraid. Amen. And when that same supernatural God would come and manifest itself in the ministry of William Brandham and people would call it amen be elabub or some sort of spook, but we don't fear it because we know it's Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh, and brother Bram said, I know they got erratics and everything, but I'll take my way with them. I'll put my choice down there. If I have to take sides, I'll be right there. Ah, I like the way he says that. If I have to take sides, because brother Steven Caressle one time, maybe he did it here, I don't know. I mean, but he's famous back where we're at for saying the power side. I mean, he said, "If I have to take sides, I'll take the power side." [laughter] I mean, and the way he said it, you know, Brother Steven here, there's only I mean, one brother Stephen, he would say, "Well, whoops. accidentally got healed of cancer. Whoops. You accidentally got delivered. [laughter] Amen. Because on the power side, Amen. There's power for deliverance. There's power for the Holy Ghost to move. There's power for healing to take place. Amen. But brother Brandon would tell you how education and culture will put you on the devil's side. But I don't want to be on the devil's side. I want to be on the power side. Oh my. Because because you can't get wildfire from a painted fire. That's why many devils, Amen, would try to get a church to follow the painted fire path. Amen. Because it's safe. You can't get wildfire. It can't get out of order. Amen. But brother Brand would say, I've rather have a little wildfire than no fire at all. Amen. So, I'll take sides with Jesus. I'll take sides with the moving of the spirit. I'll take sides. I mean, if it ever gets a little wild, and I'd say that we haven't seen much wildfire around here, I think it's genuine fire, but if it would ever get out of order, there's a God that can bring it back into order. And but just like that little young eagle that's learning to fly, Brother Brandon would say, "Mother Eagle is watching over that eagle. And if it ever gets topsyturvy, Mother Eagle can take it and set it back into balance." Amen. But if it's a painted fire, Amen. There's no power in it. Oh, so we don't want to take sides with that, but we want to take sides with Jesus. Amen. So, you got to be careful. A what you take sides with. Amen. Because brother Brand would talk about how those spirits would try to get in the church and and and begin to inject their poison ideas into the church and and get people to take sides with this and that and say this is not right and that's not right. And that spirit would try to seow discord among the brethren. And and and the Bible says that there's six things that God hates. And one of those is seowing discord among brethren. It would say how they would begin to rise up and begin to criticize this and criticize that and and try to get one to take sides against it. And brother Brandham said most of the time it's the very person that's making the stir that is not right to begin with. Amen. Talking out a turn. And he said it's not becoming to a Christian starting a little fuss here and starting a little fuss there. And then and then and in the message enticing spirits he deals with it very heavy. Amen. And he begins to come down to say amen. Amen. That you could become like Isaiah and say woe is me for I am a man of unclean lips. And he begins to really deal with that spirit of sewing discord among brethren. And I like what he says here because brother Bram said, "I don't want to listen to that old spirit anymore. It's the thing that's kept me down all my life from having real love and freedom of Christ." Amen. Brother Brandon begins to identify that that spirit of gossip and discord and things. Amen. Be careful to take sides with it because if you're not careful, it will actually hold you down. And that's why when a preacher gets up and preaches against the spirit, I mean, he's not doing it just to sometimes sometimes our righteous indignation gets up. [laughter] Amen. Don't get me wrong. And I'm sure you all feel it, too. I mean, when you see the devil trying to destroy a a young person or something, your righteous indignation gets up. But but what we see here is that Brother Brandham's saying it's the thing that's kept you down all your life. Amen. From having real love and freedom. Amen. That's why we preach against these things is because I mean we see sons and daughters of God and then get bound down by spirits of confusion or spirits of pornography or spirits of gossip or this or that. And we want to see the children of God free. Amen. Amen. Say be careful what you take sides with. Amen. You shouldn't give an ear to those things, but you should take sides with Jesus. That's what we're here to do tonight is take sides with Jesus to sow seow the word into hearts. Seow love into hearts. Amen. So, Amen. encouragement into hearts. Amen. Not discord into hearts. Amen. For God hates that. Amen. But we find, Amen. There was another spirit in the land and it was the spirit of Dayan and Kora. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you know, you know, brother Brandon teaches about that. Amen. And brother Bram said, Moses said, "All is on the Lord's side. Come with me." That's right. See, and he just opened up the earth and swallowed them up. See, because Dayan and Kora would say unto Moses, "You take too much upon you. All the congregation is holy." And and in the multitude of counsel there is safety. Brother Brandham said, 'Well, sure, but that scripture is referring to war, not to ministry, [laughter] not to the church. Is that God doesn't deal with groups. God deals with individuals and he works through a prophet. Amen. But but Dayan couldn't swallow that. He didn't want that one man leadership. And and they [snorts] would try to raise up Amen. and try to impersonate a prophet. Amen. Just like Janice and Jambers would try to impersonate, but but they didn't realize that Moses had thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I'm showing this now to show types because when brother Brandon was here, he ran into the same thing. And he and when he was in South Africa, he said, "It's not the Lord's will that we go to that town. We're supposed to go to this town." And those preachers over there said, "I mean, does God only speak to you, Brother Brandham?" Amen. We're supposed to go. I think we're supposed to go. Does God only speak to you? And brother Bram said, "Oh, Kora said the same thing right before the earth swallowed them up." Amen. But here's what we're going to get to. Amen. Tonight, brother Bram said, "Thank God all Israel never fell for Kora." Some stayed by Moses, the anointed prophet, with the word of God. Same it is same as it is today with many of God's elected by his word. and by his spirit. Oh my. Amen. There was spirits that they had to stand against in that Exodus. Amen. So, if we want to background it when Moses made a call, who was on the Lord's side? I mean, it wasn't just I mean, I I sure I'll take sides with the Lord. That that might that sounds pretty cool. They were having to stand against a lot of spirits to make that stand. And some of those things, Amen. Amen. Bpor and some of those things didn't happen till after Exodus 32. Amen. But but but but just to show the things that were opposing them in that Exodus. And sometimes Amen. those spirits maybe they haven't come to notoriety yet or to to fullness yet, but they're still at work. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the true believer and says, "I'll take I'll take my stand with the Lord." Amen. That's Amen. Because the brother Brandon said there was three groups. Amen. There was Balam, Dayan, and Kora anointed by a supernatural Satan. But there was Moses, Joshua, and Caleb anointed by a supernatural God. Oh my. Amen. And brother Brandham told us that Caleb was that believer. Amen. That followed that pillar of fire that was led by that Holy Ghost. Amen. Caleb is my type. Amen. Sure there's a Balum brother Ben. Sure there's a Dayan. Sure there's a Kora. Amen. But that's not my type. Amen. But Caleb is my type. Amen. Caleb is the believer of this day. Amen. That says, Amen. I'm going to take sides with the message. Amen. Just like Joshua said, I won't turn to the right or to the left. This book of the law shall not depart out of my mouth, but I will bear the reproach of the word of Moses. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, what he did to somebody else that was true to the cause and what he did to somebody else that was untrue for the cause, he said, then you read your name in it. If you'd have been there, what stand would you have took? And remember, you got the privilege today to take the same kind of stand. I mean, he said, "I wish I was there to stand for Moses in that day." I mean, you don't have to wait any longer. He said, "You have the privilege to take the same kind of stand today when brother Brandham would cry out who was on the Lord's side. Let him come under this word. You don't have to look back thousands of years to some Bible story." Amen. But the same question has fallen across your ears in this age. Who is on the Lord's side? Let him come under the message of the hour. Let him put his family under the message of the hour. Let him live according to the message of the hour and take up the word and deny his creed and follow Jesus Christ daily. I mean, this is the choosing time, friends, to say, "Who is on the Lord's side?" I mean, brother Brand would say, "Oh, you can't stand neutral." I mean, you've got to choose one side to the other. You can't serve God and mammon. Amen. So if you're going to have to make a choice, then I want to say like Joshua, if he would ask, "Choose you this day who you will serve." I say, "Ask for me in my house. We're going to serve the Lord." &gt;&gt; And now he would say, "Now, now are you sure you want to serve the Lord now? Get you witnesses if you want to serve the Lord." Amen. Then put away your strange gods. Amen. Oh, I like how the scripture says it. He says, "Choose you this day whom you will serve, whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the Amorites in whose land ye dwell. But as for me in my house, we will serve the Lord." Amen. He would say, "Amen. Do you want to serve the gods of your fathers who believe the word and were carried through the flood? Or do you want to believe the gods of the Amorites and whose land you're dwelling right now? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's almost comical. Amen. But but yet so many fell for it. [gasps] But he would say, "Do you want to serve the gods of your fathers or the gods of the Amorites?" Amen. And yeah, those Amorites, if you want to serve your gods, their gods, they just got kicked out of their own land. And those that took my word are possessing their land. Amen. Do you want to serve their gods or do you want to serve the one and true living God? Amen. Do you want to serve the God who owns the cattle on a thousand heels? Or do you want to serve the God who's going to have to give up the whole earth? Amen. To the believers, for the meek shall inherit the earth. Amen. Do you want to serve the God who wants you to be healed? Who wants you to be saved? Who wants you to be delivered? Or do you want to serve the God who is cancer, who is demonic power, who is bondage? [laughter] Oh my. Do you want to serve the God? Amen. Who is the message? And who's calling out a bride? Or do you want to serve the God, Amen, who's trying to come against this message and is headed, Amen, for hell's fire. Amen. You know, they had so many gods in that day. They they would serve Bal who is the god of fertility and say my I I if if we offend our God if we don't worship our God. Amen. Then then then all our crops are going to die. Amen. Then we're not going to be able to be fertile any longer. Amen. But I like what the scripture says in Deuteronomy 7 about those that would keep the commandments and hearken onto the sayings of the Lord. He said, "He will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee, and bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, and thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, and increase thy kind, and the flocks of thy sheep, and the land which you swear unto thy fathers to give thee. Thou shalt be blessed above all people, and there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your cattle." Oh my friends, ex you can either pack around your 1,000 7,000 gods. You need one for your fertility. You need one for your rain. You need one for this, one for that, one for this, one for that. Or you can serve the one and true living God and he'll bless you and he'll bless your womb and he'll bless your family and he'll bless your children and he'll bless your reign. Amen. And he'll bless you with with great benefits. Amen. I say, "As for me in my house, we will serve the Lord." Oh, as Elijah would crawl out, why halt ye between two opinions? If Belle be God, then serve him. But if but God be God, then serve the one and true living God. Oh, that's how I feel. If the message is right, we should give our all to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. If it's not right, Amen. then go serve the living God. But if this message is right, Amen. And then we should serve it with all of our hearts. Oh, brother Brandon would say, "Where is the gods of Balum? Where is your critic that says the Holy Spirit is not right? Come forth and do the same thing." Say, "Where is the gods of these denominations?" Let them come forth and do the same thing. Amen. But if this God be true, Amen. then follow him. Amen. And if it is true, and if you are on the Lord's side, then he would say, "Now, Levites, draw your sword and put it by your side and start to clean out the camp." Amen. It's time to clean out the house. Isn't that what Jesus did when he came on earth? He began to braid together a whip and go into the temple and say, "You have made the house of God a den of thieves." And he began to flip over the tables and drive them out of the land because they had no place in the house of God. And they had turned it into a den of thieves. Amen. But the when the word was manifested in the midst of those idols, it begin to braid whips and knock it out and say, "Get out of my father's house. You have no right here." Amen. Don't take your idols into my father's house. This is the house of worship. This is a house with a certain glory. Amen. Should have preeminence, not a house, amen, to make an extra dime. Oh my. When those spirits try to come in and bring their pyramid schemes and try to Amen. try to pull, Amen. Amen. People to make money. Oh my. It's about every other week you read on the news about another denominational pastor that's going to jail. Amen. For for some sort of Amen. fault or failure because of money or women or this or that. Amen. But God is saying, "Is there any Levites?" Amen. That'll clean up the camp and stand for this. Amen. That is right. And call black and white white. Oh, brother Brandon would preach the invasion of the United States. And he would say, "Help us to stand and pull the sword quickly and fight for God as Moses and the Levites did down there when sin was in the camp." Oh, there's an invasion on and Satan has invaded this country and he's invaded the pulpits and he's tried to invade the homes and he's tried to invade real motherhood and real fatherhood and he's tried to invade the young people. Amen. But I say as for me in my house, Amen. We're not going to put up, Amen, with Satan's attack. But we have a sword. And as long as I have a sword in my hand, I say, "Satan, this is our land." Amen. We were given this land to possess it. And I know it's full of giants. Amen. But God has promised my father Abraham. Amen. That this is my land. And so I'm not going to bow down to any giant, but I'm going to destroy it. Oh, but the Bible says, "My angel is going to go before you and bring you in to the Amorites and Hittites and Perizzites and Canaanites and Hivites and Jebusites, and I will cut them off. Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works, but shall utterly destroy them and quite break down their images." Brother Brandham said about that scripture that we're babying a whole lot of things we ought to be destroying. [laughter] is said, "We're petting a whole lot of things that we ought to be destroying." And they would say, "Oh, that little Jebusite. It's so cute." [laughter] He said, "I'll grow up to be just like its daddy." Amen. He said, "You ought to utterly destroy it." Amen. Because this is our land to possess. He said, "You shouldn't pet that sickness. You shouldn't pet that complex. You should shouldn't pet this or that, but you should destroy it." Amen. because we're going to our land. We've got a destination, friends. And while we're passing through the land of Leodysia, you're going to encounter some idols of uh of fashion and entertainment and and some idols of lukewarmness and dead religion and this and that. Amen. But we are not to bow down to it. We are to possess it. Oh, praise God. I I thank God for some real Amen. sons and daughters of God that are an example, amen, of what we should live like because I believe we need some examples. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because Caleb would stand up and say, "We're more than able to take the land." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And he was an example unto the rest of the children of Israel. Amen. That we are more than able to take the land. A and Paul would write unto Timothy, Timothy, let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example. Amen. in word and conversation and in spirit and purity and and there's a lot of negative examples. The scripture would say how Sodom and Gomorrah as an example and was set forth as an example in the book of Jude giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh and set forth for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire. I mean those that disbelieved the word in the first Exodus and didn't go all the way into the land, the Bible say how don't follow after that same example of unbelief. Amen. So if there can be an example in the negative, brother Paul, I believe there can be an example in the positive. And the Bible says how Jesus Christ was made our example. Amen. About how it says, Amen. He did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. When he was reviled, he reviled not again. When he suffered, he threatened not, but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. Amen. And I believe the Bible teaches us that our aged woman should ought to be an example onto our young woman, how to serve in the house, how to love their husbands, and how our elders should be an example onto our sons, how to how to carry themselves with the right spirit and the right attitude. Now the problem is is when Amen. is when the the elders don't set the right example and and then the young people suffer and then it begins to pass down. Amen. But I thank God that you have a church here with some wonderful elders. Amen. A wonderful sister Brown, wonderful deacons. Amen. Amen. That are setting an example. Amen. For what a true son or daughter of God can actually look like. Amen. Because brother Brandham said, "This world is looking for a display of gallant soldiers of the cross, real heroes that will stand for God." And right. And I think it's a pitiful thing. Amen. When the young people have to be an example for the elders, Amen. Because Amen. Because Amen. A mama, amen, doesn't respect her husband or a mama doesn't Amen. show any respect. Amen. And doesn't honor the head of her house. And then the daughter grows up and does the same thing. And you wonder why. Amen. Because that was the only example they saw. Amen. But thank God for some real mothers. Thank God for some real sons and daughters of God. Amen. Is that you tonight? Amen. Some real sons and daughters of God that will stand for the truth. Amen. Amen. Because the whole earth is groaning for the manifestation of sons of God. Amen. Sons of God, amen, to to stand and manifest. Amen. Christ in this hour waiting for the manifestation of sons of God. Amen. Just like those sons of Levi would stand in that day, they're sons and daughters of God in this day that'll say, "I'll stand for what's right." &gt;&gt; Amen. And and what I'm trying to get to you is that we have an opportunity to do it. And we we want to seize our opportunity. Amen. We want to seize our opportunity. Amen. To stand for the greatest message that's ever hit the face of this earth. Amen. What do we want to be known for? Amen. What do we want to be known for when we leave this earth? Amen. Do we want to be known just for a just a halfway? Or do we want to be known for somebody that gave their all to the message of the hour? I say, "Help me, Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. As we begin to turn a corner to draw it down here to a close, I think about David's mighty man [sighs] &gt;&gt; that would stand for him in that hour and say, "If the king has a desire, &gt;&gt; amen, then his least desire is my command." &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon would talk about how we ministers today see this word is preached, to see that it's done. And it's becoming to us a man in these hour that we're living in. Great men in the earth today. Oh God, they're out there. Let them see it and grab the sword. No matter what the opposition of God before you, who can be against you? We don't care jeopardizing our social living. We don't care jeopardizing this, that, or the other. We want to get the water of life back. Amen. Have you ever got to that place in your life where you just say, "I don't care anymore what the world thinks about me. I don't care anymore." Amen. Amen. I'm just I I'm just being real tonight. Amen. Sometimes you feel like at least I've been there, Lord. I feel like I should have said something. I feel like I'm not a good witness. I feel like I should have done more for you. I feel like I get so worried maybe about saying the wrong thing or this or that. But sometimes you just get to that point and say, "I I don't I don't care anymore, Lord. I just want to stand for you. I I don't care if they laugh at me. I don't care if they make fun of me. I I don't care anymore, Lord. If there's only one person that's welcome in the room, I want it to be you. Lord, I I don't care anymore about if I if it makes someone else uncomfortable. Lord, I want to make you welcome. I want to worship you. I want to make you welcome. Amen. Brother Andrew Glover preached on it one time. I think someone told him, he said, "You see that person walking down the street and dressed, Amen, like you know, maybe they in their pajamas or this or that." And he said, "Those are called don't care no mores." [laughter] Amen. because they just don't care anymore. Amen. So they'll walk out and dressed however they want to. Amen. Because they've just come to a spot they don't care what everyone thinks apparently. Amen. And he began to type that to the spiritual that you can come to that place where you become a don't care no more. Amen. Don't care what the world thinks no more. Don't care what your schoolmates think anymore. Don't care what your co-workers think anymore. Amen. But something begins to rise up in your heart. Say Lord. Amen. If you're sitting in the room with dirty feet, I'm not going to let you stay here with dirty feet, but I'm going to wash your feet with my praise. I'm going to water you, Lord. Simon the Pharisee and all of his friends are trying to dirty your reputation. Amen. But this might be my only opportunity in your presence. AND I'VE GOT A NEED. I'VE GOT A SINS in my life. So Lord, I don't care what Simon thinks. I don't care, Amen, what the people of my past life think. Lord, if you are here with dirty feet, I'm going to get out my hair and I'm going to wash your feet and I'm going to wipe it with my glory. Amen. Because Jesus reputation is made in the presence of sinners. Amen. That'll recognize them and worship them and say, "I don't care anymore. I've got a need. I've got a need." And Jesus would cry back out, "Your sins which were many are all forgiven you." Amen. Because somebody took sides with Jesus. Amen. And he would speak of that blind man. Amen. They were trying to dirty Jesus' name saying, "Who sinned? You or your parents?" Amen. That you were born blind. And say, "Neither, but that the works of God be made manifest. And I may not be able to explain to you how he did it." Amen. But all I know is my eyes. which were once closed are now open. One thing I know, where once I was blind, now I can see. Amen. If they want to dirty the reputation of this message, Amen. I say you're going to have to Amen. Get out of the way for one voice. Amen. Because this is one voice that says one thing I know. Where once I was lost, now I am saved. Where once I was bound, now I'm delivered. Well, once I was in a cloud of confusion, now I'm walking in the clarity of the vindicated word. Amen. Because of this message. Amen. I'll take sides with the message of the hour &gt;&gt; because it becometh you to fulfill all righteousness. It's becoming of you to take a stand. Amen. That's what brother Brandon would preach. It becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. And he would preach about how Abraham stood and about how Elijah stood and about how all these characters in the Bible stood. &gt;&gt; Oh, Abraham stood when the devil was trying to destroy. And God had told him, "Go take your son and and take him up on the mountain and sacrifice him." And Moses or Abraham was obedient because it becometh him to fulfill our righteousness. Amen. But we serve a God that can stay the hand. Amen. Because you're obedient to his word. When it looks like judgment is just about to strike your daughter or your son. Amen. But you are fulfilling all righteousness. We serve a God that can stay the hand. Say, "It don't look good, Brother Isaac. It looks like it looks like judgment's about to strike. It looks like this is about to happen. just keep standing for righteousness and we serve a God that can stay the hand of what looks like it's going to destroy [gasps] &gt;&gt; because you know when brother Brandon preached that message he was standing in the pulpit and he walks up and says it's always a pleasure to come to the house of God brother Paul but this might be one of the hardest times my mother's laying dying in the hospital and in the middle of a sermon they bring him a note said don't look good. It looks like she may be gone. But [snorts] then he would say, "But it becometh me now to fulfill all righteousness." And he stood there and preached the message to me and to you. Amen. Because in the midst of opposition, it was becoming to him to take a stand. He said, "The devil's tried to push me out of this pulpit the whole service." Amen. But it becometh me to fulfill all righteousness. But you know what happened when brother Brandham stood for the Lord? He came back and preached the comforter that evening and he said, "Amen, she don't know it, but Jesus was keeping her alive while I was preaching." Amen. Because when you stand for Jesus, Amen, he will stand for you. Amen. It becometh us to fulfill our righteousness and take sides with Jesus. But let me tell you this, if you take sides with him and he is right there to take sides with you, oh my Because [snorts] when the children of Israel took a stood stand for him and did not bow, amen to that to that idol. Amen. Nebuchadnezzar would say, "All right, then you got to go into the fiery furnace." But they took a stand. Amen. A a and right at the last hour, they said, "I see a fourth man in the fire, one like unto the son of God." And you know what it says in the book of Daniel? Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god." And he said, "Therefore, I make a decree. every people, nation, language would speak anything a miss against the God of Shadrach, Meach, and Abedneo shall be cut to pieces, and their houses shall be made a dungghill because there's no other god that can deliver after this sort. Then the king promoted Shadrach, Mach, and Abedneo in the province of Babylon. Brother Brandon said, "If you stand for the word, it always pays out wonderful." You know, the same thing happened for Daniel when he wouldn't bow and there's a decree. You cannot pray to any other deity except the king. But Daniel kneel down and prayed three times a day just like always. And they said, "You made the decree, king. He's got to go in the lion's den." And they cast him in the lion's den. Amen. But the pillar fire was in there with him. Stay in the mouth of those lions. And when he came back up out of that den, the king made another decree and said, "How how I make a decree that in every dominion of my kingdom, men tremble in fear before the God of Daniel, for he is the living God, steadfast forever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. He deliverth and rescueth, and he workketh signs and wonders in heaven and earth. Who hath delivered Daniel from the power of the lions? And Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius. &gt;&gt; Oh, you say sometimes it feels like it's just much easier to bow, amen, to the pressures. But I say it's much easier to stand &gt;&gt; because it always pays off when you stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. With the musicians come tonight. When brother Bram said, "I'm so glad that I'm on the winning side. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that I follow the lamb because it said the lamb overcame them for he was king of kings and lord of lords." And he said farther down, "I trust that you'll make the decision that you'll follow the lamb." You know, and brother Aaron, when a basketball team wins a national championship or football team, all of that team, even the ones that sat on the bench, they get that they get that championship ring. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they might not have played a second and they might not be able to dribble their way out of a paper bag, but because of whose side they were on, amen, they all get to celebrate in the championship. Amen. And I begin to think about that today, I think, or yesterday. I my because Satan might try to offer you, well, if you just go to this team, you'll get you'll get more playing time and you'll get this or that. Amen. But but but Michael Jordan's not on that team. And sure, you might get to play more, but you'll just have loss after loss after loss. Amen. That Amen. Are you get what I'm saying tonight? Amen. It matters whose side you're on. And when you take sides with Jesus, you're on the winning side. And brother Brandham said, Amen. Brother Brandham said that here he has for when the scripture says in the book of Revelations, these things, these things saith the amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, "Now we can see why the devil hates the book of Genesis and Revelation. He hates the truth. He knows the truth will prevail. He knows what his end will be, how he fights that. But we are on the winning side. We I mean the believers of his word only are on the amen side. Amen. You say, "Brother Isaac, will will I be popular?" No, you might not be, but you'll be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'd rather be blessed of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Than ever blessed with anything this world has to offer. &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says, "Consecrate yourselves today to the Lord, every man upon his son and his brother, that ye may bestow upon you a blessing this day." He said in in the book of Exodus 23, "They shall not if thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works, but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and quite break down their images. and ye shall serve the Lord thy God, and he shall bless thy bread and thy water, and take sickness away from the midst of thee. Brother Brandon would teach us that that iniquity would be passed down to the third and fourth generation. I mean, but he would say, "If that's true for iniquity, it's also true for blessings." &gt;&gt; I mean, and you think, "My stand doesn't matter, brother Isaac. What what difference will it make if I stand?" Well, when Abraham stood and paid tithe to Melzdc, the Bible says that Levi paid tithes to Melzdc and the loins of Abraham with his great our great greatgrandfather. And brother Bram said that the example that you set and the the decisions that you make will affect your children and your children's children and down the line because it's not just iniquity that's passed down. It's blessings. And there when those Levites stood for the word, they had paid tithes to MelzDC and the loins of Abraham. But now when they took that stand for the word, they went into the temple. Amen. And all the all the other people would have to bring tithes onto them and take care of them while they would serve the Lord as priests in the temple. Amen. Because you look at the blessing on those that have stood for the word. Amen. You say, "Well, well, well, I come from a family of of broken pieces." says, "Well, you can be the first one in your family to take the stand." And your spiritual fathers have took a stand. Maybe your natural lineage hasn't, but your spiritual lineage has took a stand. And and and and I want it to be very very clear and very very strong that if you stand for him, he'll stand for you. &gt;&gt; Anything that you forsake for this gospel, Amen. The Bible says how you how he will repay you a thousandfold. Brother Brandon would say, "Everything that you've forsaken for this gospel, you've left houses and fathers and mothers and lands." He said, "He will repay you a thousandfold." &gt;&gt; Amen. And I like that because one time Hadtie Wright put her voice with this message and said that's nothing but the truth. And you know what brother Bram said? He said the blessings has never left that house. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said it's it's not the same home anymore. A mean because somebody was willing to take their stand with this word. Amen. And look at the blessings that affected their home, affected their children. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you stand on your feet with me tonight. Amen. If we could just bow our heads in a word of prayer as we just close. Forgive me for holding you here. But but in the Bible, there was a valley one time called the valley of I where Joshua was fighting a battle and they suffered a great defeat. And they begin to search out why is this that I've suffered this defeat and they found Achen had robbed the camp of a wedge of gold and this and that. And and brother Wayne brought this out one time. It's so powerful because you can look at that scripture as judgment or you can look at it as opportunity because when they would stone Achen in the valley of Acor and go back to the valley of I and fight those armies again, they would win a great astounding victory. I mean, because it wasn't that, well, I just I've made a mistake, Brother Isaac. I how can I be a Levite? How can I take a stand for this message? I I've just comes to my mind now, you know, Peter before he had the Holy Ghost denied him three times. Amen. But when they took care of the sin in the camp, [music] then they could rise again and suffer victory after victory after victory. Samson committed sins with Delilah. Amen. But when he was ready to forsake everything and die out, he'd say, "Just once more, Lord. I'm ready to take my stand. I've made some mistakes. I've committed some sins, but Lord, I'm ready to say just once more, Lord. I want to stand for you that you might stand for me." Amen. If that's you tonight, if we bow our heads and close our eyes, if I know it's chopped up tonight, forgive me. just trying to bring it out. But maybe you'd like to take a stand for him. Like brother Brandham tells about that evangelist Daniel Curry. I mean that went before that throne and thought surely he would make it in. And we say, "Hey man, your name's not on the book. We're going to have to take it to the white throne." And before that white throne, every little white lie, every little thing that he had told was a great big lie. And he was guilty. And just when he thought that he was going to be condemned to judgment, a voice spoke out and said, "Wait a minute. Daniel Curry stood for me when he was on earth. I want to stand for him now. Put his sins on my charge." &gt;&gt; Oh. And when Daniel Curry stood for Jesus, &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus stood for Daniel Curry. Amen. And that's what we're trying to say tonight. If you take a stand for this message, it may be difficult. Amen. You may have to bear reproach and suffer and be persecuted and laughed at, but if you stand for him, he'll stand for you. Heavenly Father, we commit this congregation into your hands, Lord. Forgive me, I pray for my humanity, Father. And but Lord, I just just [music] on my heart, Father, my what a privilege it is to be able to stand for you in this hour, Father. We don't. Lord, sometimes it rebukes us. But Father, I thank you that it rebukes us, Lord. I Lord, I personally I want to thank you, Lord, for a word that doesn't let us stay where we're at, but it molds us and shapes us into your image, Father. I want to thank you, Lord. Even just reading some of these quotes the other night, Father, I Lord, I was so convicted, my Lord, because I feel like I've failed you so many times. I I feel like there's times when I haven't stood for you like I should. I Lord, I haven't uh at work, Lord. I I should be a better witness. I should do this and I should do that. And I say, Lord, help me to be a better witness. Father, Lord, I Lord, if I have to fail, Lord, let me fail, but let me rise and try again. Lord, if I'm if I need to make some mistakes, Lord, I'd rather wear out than rust out, as the prophet would said. But Lord, I want to be found standing for you. Father, Lord, forgive me for all the times, Lord, I failed you. But Father, I do know this thing, Lord Jesus, that by your grace, we've put our life under this message of the hour. Lord, it's our headship. Father, we've taken sides with you and everything else contrary is wrong. And I pray that you bless your children tonight. May you bless this assembly as they stand for you, Lord. I believe you'll stand for them, Father. &gt;&gt; In your precious name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead, brother Paul.

Let the worshippers [music] arrive. Oh hallelujah. Yes. [music] Oh, let your sons and your daughters. Oh, let them [music] sing a new song. I'm surrendering my all, [music] my all.
