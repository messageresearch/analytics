richly bless you tonight if you have your Bibles we'd like to go to the word of the Lord amen appreciate the music tonight amen it's always a blessing amen the music goes right out in front of the word battle amen we will turn to the Bible the book of Zechariah the 14th chapter amen we turn there tonight and Zechariah Chapter 14 be reading the seventh verse Zechariah 14 and 7. it's a very familiar scripture to the message of the hour amen it's a very powerful scripture it is one of the promises of what God would do in the end time in our age in Zechariah 14 and 7 but it shall be one day we shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be right we ask the Lord to bless his word tonight you may be seated I want to speak to you just a little bit tonight upon focusing on the Vindicated word focusing on the Vindicated word amen I I think and believe tonight that there's a lot of promises in the Bible and I thank God for his promises amen I remember when I was just coming into the into the message of the hour and I started learning some of the Bible scriptures that spoke of end time and this was one of them that always was very astounding to me was in Zechariah 14 that it shall be not day or night but she'll come to pass at the evening time that it shall be light it was always astounding to me that it would be light in the evening time that and and I thought isn't it something uh for years I I looked at that word light and I thought a lot about it what does that really mean it shall we lied in the evening time but you know as we as we went through the years and began to study the the scripture I found that this scripture could be maybe written uh we could say it like this that in the evening time scripture will be fulfilled uh it it shall be lie but what that's speaking of is that scriptures will be fulfilled and when scripture is fulfilled it becomes a lie to the age of the people that's living in that generation and that light would be the light of the Vindication of the word of God in other words it becomes a surety or of a truth that becomes unquestionable and I believe sometimes we need to uh if we if we maybe could refocus ourselves or our lives that there has to be a center point for our Focus there has to be something that we are keep in our view that stabilizes us that keeps our strength it keeps us reminded who we are it refreshes us in our lives and it produces the faith we need to be able to surpass the situations that we find ourselves in you know in the message of the Feast of the trumpets brother Ben will tell us this he'll tell us that you know unless we're constantly in the word to know what he see you know people is going to miss this end time thing they're going to miss what God is doing in the end time do you know that the people on the Earth and the days of our Lord Jesus many of them missed him amen and do you know it was not even prophesied to be a secret in his first coming but in his second coming he made a promise that it would be as a thief and a night that it would be a secret and so people today are going to miss they're going to miss the Vindication or the word they're going to miss that and the prophet said now how would they know unless they would stay constantly in the word and then he goes over to the Book of Daniel and he said but the wise shall know and the foolish and the unwise wouldn't know he said they shall know their God and how he shall appear in the last days to bring these people back to the word so the bride will know her husband her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen it wasn't reformers Luther Wesley the Pentecostals scripture says it wasn't but it will come that is the promise for this age we are living in the age that his coming will be in see she will must be identified a woman must be identified in her husband and Christ's bride has to be identified with him for these two are one and he is the word not the denomination the word and we are to be Children of the light and the light is the word which is made light for this age now how do we know light except it comes from the word all right the word made flesh is the light of the age the word made flesh is the light of the aces what is the light this the word made flesh that is the light of the age in the rising of the sun brother random will say who is the son of man for in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if all the teaching we have and the confirmation of the word of God word by word Signs by wonders we see today in the Book of Luke and and he said Luke 17 30 and Malachi 4 and different scriptures were acquainted with that the word again is waived over the people that Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and is giving us life and it is giving us life amen I think it's very powerful when you start looking at sermon titles sometimes and brother animal speak one here and he'll call it there is a man here that can turn on the light there is a man here that can turn on the light see in the evening time it shall be light and then he announces there is a man here that can turn on the light see see only God can make his word live amen anybody can impersonate anything they can do anything they want but only God can make his word live he can manifest his own word and brother man said see then there's a man here that can turn on the light there's a man here that can vindicate the word in its season there's a man here that can do that there's no reason to fear because God has made a promise that he would do it in this season there's a man here to turn on the light he says so life is only by the word of God made manifest life comes only by the word of God manifest see as long as it's in the book like this it can still be questioned see as long as the word is just in the Bible it can still be questioned but when it's made manifest he said then you see the pride product of what is spoke of being manifest then the light is on the word see that's what brings it see when it comes to pass that's the life in light light bringing life see the light brings life so that's the same thing it is in the word the word of God and when life strikes it the light strikes it it's the word in life see every age has been that way how we appreciate these great things and how that word being Vindicated is the light of the spoken word of God now brother man was telling us something very clearly as long as it's in the Bible it can be questioned but when the words manifested it becomes a light and it becomes unquestionable can I say it like this it becomes an infallible evidence that this is God dealing with you see the kind of God that we serve he don't ask you to serve him without you knowing what you're serving amen we are not worshiping at the altar of an unknown God such as with all found in that land God is not just saying to you just worship you know those people say to you just worship just worship but amen but what what do you want me to worship amen there's there's different ways of worshiping the Bible said that you can worship and worship God in vain amen making the traditions of the word of God and and taking the effect out of the word amen but I find out that when God makes something manifested then that produces a place of worship to the Church of the Living God when God manifestes his word he's interpreting the scripture to you and that is the Gate of the worship of almighty God so if God's going to require you to worship he's got to make known at what Gates you're going to worship he's got to invite you to the place of worship where you know without a shadow of a doubt that you're giving worship to almighty God this is the season but the Bible said that the elect would be deceived if it were possible but see God is going to take this elect seed into a place of infallibility where their worship will be received by God and Satan will not be stealing the worship of this Bride for her worship goes directly unto God in this season but it's not because that we were somehow that we were a special ideal or we we somehow did something wonderful but God by his grace manifested himself so plainly that not even a fool would airfare in if he would just believe the Simplicity of what God has done in the season then we're living in look what he does when God begins to manifest he takes the question out of it amen he gives us the answer he he takes the question away from what does this mean what does this scripture mean he when he manifestes it now we have the perfect interpretation of the perfect word which produces the the Vindication of the word of God do you see what it'll do it'll give you a product amen I amazing when you hear Brother Branham say that it's come to a place now he said to disbelieve this word would be a sin that God is so thoroughly Vindicated it that it would now become a sin to disbelieve that this is God manifesting this and this age do you recognize that there is no life outside of the message of the hour the prophet of God said there is no life that can come outside of light light produces life and there can be no life outside of light natural or spiritual there must be and only light can come by the word of God God's word is a light when it's manifested see otherwise it's just a seed laying here then there's got to come a lie for there to be life in the sea in other words your carriers of a Siege you have a genetics of God inside you but the potential that you have is locked into you until God sends a light upon the church that would open up the potential that's why that the Baptist could never bring you to a bride the Pentecost can never bring you to a bride you he would take a greater light in this season because this is harvest season we're not living in the stock of the Hurst we're living when the seed and the husk are separating and that takes a harvest Sun that takes an evening light it takes the maturity of the word of God coming into this season I know it's strong amen this message is a strong message and I know there's some people so don't preach the message so strong they don't they don't want the strength of the message amen but it's the strength of the message amen that stimulates the faith of the bride of Christ that brings her out from under the shuttle listen as long as we're in the shock then we have something that is harnessing the potential of what God designs you to be you have been designed to have the potential of almighty God Sons and Daughters this is the season of adoption this is the season of the full glorification of the name of almighty God church I'll tell you what that name is tonight amen that name is in the bride of Christ she is now known as Miss Jesus Christ come on Amen and that name is a representation of the manifestation of the word of God then the bride is the place of manifestation in this hour it's got to be manifesting that word you see then that light begins to come over the church now I know I know people say to me all the time so you know they think maybe I'm a little strong on predestination maybe I am but I believe that it's one of the final birth Pains of the great bride Revival I think whenever you finally grasp the sovereignty of God through predestination that it'll take you over every hump it'll take you over every battle in your life when you recognize that Satan cannot change in time what God has done into eternity then you're ready to recognize God took a picture of me in my perfection amen and that is the positive positive and this is the negative and you'll never change the positive by the negative amen only thing will happen is it'll make a development of your life coming to the Perfection of the word of God Amen it'd be something if I took a picture of you right and I took the picture outside and I draw the mustache or took all your hair off or something like that and showed somebody that picture amen and they looked at the picture well that's something that I did to the picture but I didn't do it to him amen do you see what it is that that he remains the same person and and God has the real you he has the picture of the real you up in heaven and this is only the negative of what God has already done and Satan can marry can mingle he can hurt he can do whatever he wants to do but God is already determined the Church of the Living God where she is and what she's doing amen I just want to maybe say this I think it's beautiful when you start recognizing that Satan is already a defeated that this battle is already won amen we are not fighting they meant to determine whether or not we're Pride we're not determined Amen to fight whether or not we're going to be saved or lost come on church amen that has already been a determination amen that's outside of our ability amen I can stand here with the scripture all night he said you have not chosen me but I have chosen you Amen to Bear forth much fruit in its season amen that if he done the chosen brother bam said when did he do it according to Ephesians the first chapter he said he chose you in him before the foundation of the world and then again it is written in the Book of Romans the eighth chapter had as many as he's called he's Justified and many as he's Justified he's already glorified is that right amen has he already glorified this bride then right now we are already glorified in the presence of almighty God I love how brother Brandon and said it he said let the devil have all the temper tantrum he wants to have this body has already been glorified and there's nothing the devil can do about it I thank God tonight that there's a bloodline that Satan cannot cross amen that God is already identified with the Church of the Living God what an hour to serve the Lord what an hour to live it's an hour of light do you see that Siege you're a seed amen that seed that's in your heart amen comes from God that comes from God that soul that you have brother Brown said he is a gene of God Amen now that's pretty powerful so as much as my son or my daughter is a product of my life you are a product of the life of almighty God I know you're a human being and we we talk about that a little bit too much I think sometimes we ought to change our focus and take it off of humanity and put it upon deity because you're more than just a human amen there is a deity part of the Church of the Living God I think it's time to adjust our focus and see that we are the word of the age that we're living in identified by the message of the hour brother what a time to live amen what a time to live do you see this message is it is a light it man it's a Vindicated word it is a light and when it strikes the seed there's something going to come to life and it doesn't matter the conditions or the situations when the light strikes it there's a power in the seed it will manifest it will come forth and there's nothing that can keep it from coming forth it doesn't matter the situation because God has the ability in the seed already to make it manifest brother Adam uses this to make a point he actually says that one time there was a seed that was found back there in the pyramids hey man he said in one place he called it the Garners of Joseph he said they found that seed back there he said they found it stuck away and here it is thousands of years later they brought that seed out from the from the Garners and they put it in the ground put a little water on it and when the light Struck it he meant it had life in it and it come and manifest whatever God had spoke in the beginning do you see then amen that God Amen no matter how old that seed is amen the prophet will tell you that you were sealed in the womb of God's mind before the foundation in the world didn't he say it didn't he say you were in him before the foundation of the world but in this season of time amen God opened up the Garners of Joseph and took out one of his seed words and he put it in a little ground he put it in the ground that we're sitting right here tonight he placed that seed in you and then he sent the light of the resurrection of the Son of God and that seed lived it's millions of years old amen it was in the mind of God before he formed the world but it's alive tonight it's alive with life tonight this is not a dead church we are not a formal church we are not a Creed seeking church we are the body of Jesus Christ borne by the blood by the power of the Holy Ghost a light that is shined upon the church he manifies the devil I'll be fighting that light too if I was the devil I'd be trying to put this light out too I'd be trying to say this message ain't no good and has no power because that devil knows that when this bride recognizes who she is and the potential of that seed that's on the inside of her he has already lost the battle she is an invincible Army uh church I I sometimes want to ask the people of God Amen if we ain't the people then I pray you tell me who is if this ain't the season then I pray you tell me what season we're looking for there ain't nobody in the Earth today that won't say we're at the end time ever ever Baptist ever Presbyterian everybody you talk to we are at the end time we are at the end time amen that the bombs could drop tomorrow well listen if the Rapture could happen in the morning then you tell me when the bride's going to be manifesting before the Rapture amen could it be going on right now and Satan is trying to distract you with covet and mask or no mask or vaccine and no vaccine he's trying to get your attention off of the manifestation of the word of God because if the bride looks away she looks away from the promises of God she goes into the waves of the storms just like Peter did that night but if you keep your eyes on Jesus there ain't nothing that'll seek you there ain't nothing that'll hold you down there's a focus tonight and then this bride focuses on that word then the potential of her Focus will drop down into her soul brother amen somebody said well brother Wayne I don't think I'm good ground I believe you are I believe some brought 20 and some brought 60. but there was some brought 100 fold and there's some lots and there's some Abrahams and brother man said it'd take a hundred lots to make one Abraham but I think we got some Abraham seed here tonight I think we got an abrahamic Covenant over the Church of the Living God seeds that have failed in good ground didn't Jesus say that didn't he say his word would come into good ground come on now brother Brown said good ground he said that's pre-prepared ground hey man Rapture book faith is Works expressed both of them or works is Faith Express wife I'm sorry amen both of those sermons he taught us that the good ground Jesus spoke of was the church is that right now it gets confusing don't it because one time I'm calling you a ground and the word a seed and another time I call you a seed in the word light amen but if you read Matthew 13 this this helped me years ago in Matthew the 13th chapter there's two Parables laying there remember Jesus tells the parable of the word falling on the ground as a seed it's a good seed but the ground determined the growth of the seed some fell in rocks some fell in rolling this something you know something but some fell in good ground and brother man said see that good seed is the word that good ground is the believer but then in the next chapter or in the next part of the third that's the next page in my Bible but in Matthew 13 then Jesus tells a story a man of two Sowers sowing in the earth and this time the Earth is the Earth but the seed is the children of God so when one Parable you received in another Parable you're the Earth amen but in every Parable you belong to God Amen you're the good ground you're the good seed the bride of Christ the potential amen and this is what has come in this age light has come on this to make that manifest oh I love it when I see that God has come in this age for judgment he's coming this age for judgment everybody runs backwards from judgment but the Bible doesn't say Jesus come to condemn he said he come to judge amen that's a powerful thing when you catch that Revelation he never come to condemn you he come to judge you amen and this judgment he puts on your life to give you Grace is not a fixed court it's the truth amen it's the truth it's the Vindicated truth of God I'll put it I'll put it in a in a Simplicity the way I understand these things amen is when the sun begins to shine and It Shines on a field that's planted the sunshine don't change the seed the sun sign judges the seed that's laying there it makes it manifest whether it's wheat or corn a cuckaburra whatever's laying in the field the sun makes it manifest and this is the rising of the Sun and this is God's word shining on the bride of Christ and something in your heart begin to believe then that means you're not an empty Rock Amen you're not an empty piece of salt as the seed laid in you that comes from the foundation of the world Amen and that seed laying there has been waiting for this message for this season for this time brother Branham actually speaks about how Christ was the first one to raise Amen in the in the New Testament he was the first one that slept he said but in the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church there will have to be a Sheaf waved again in the last days a waving of the sheath you all know what that means it means they planted a field when the seed come to maturity there was a first portion of maturity that come in a field and they picked that sheath and they would take the Harvest what they'd do is harvest the wheat and they'd take it back barley wheat whatever it was and then they would wave it in front of the priest and that sheath being waved amen was the sign that that the seed was in its process in other words we put a seed in the ground and now it's come back to seed again the process has been fulfilled and it would be acceptable when that when that sheath was accepted the whole field got accepted is that right now we know that sheath was Christ is that right but it's Christ in this age so Christ had to have a body amen amen we're not we're not talking about deifying a man William Branham but we're talking about a seed coming to maturity amen as an answer to the mystery of godliness adoption is not a figment of imagination adoption is a reality and we're living in the season where men who are not virgin born but sin born will come to adoption by the blood of Jesus Christ in this age oh if you'll change your focus and realize this church you're never going to be an angel you were never meant to be an angel you were a son to begin with and this is the age how can I say it like this this is when attributes are going to be manifested if we say it like that it's a little easier to take some time how many believes you're an attribute you're an attribute of God so then this is the season of attributes being manifested is that right amen now what is an attribute from a man it's a son so this is the season of the manifestation of the sons of God Amen then Romans 8 is not hard anymore Romans 8 being the season of the manifestation so he's talking about you the attributes of God are manifesting in this season and the whole earth is groaning waiting for the manifestation of sons and when William Branham was standing on the earth there was the first son to maturity for this broad age and when God accepted him when God accepted him as a part of this bright season he opened up an age to the Church of the Living God and here we stand tonight we are no longer in a Pentecostal age we have moved from the shuck to the Sea we've come into the age of the manifestation of the seed life of almighty God Amen the light is shining adoption time Holy Ghost Field Time the fullness of the word time we are not worshiping unto the banners of Pentecost amen the life that was in Pentecost is now in this message and we have not lost anything that Pentecost had we've only took what they had and now it's come to potential don't tell me that God that we've lost something don't tell me this bride don't have everything Pentecost has brother we got everything they had plus a little amen what what's it about it's an age of restoration is it not this is not God taking this is God adding until the church comes to a full restoration of the word of God I believe that's the season we're living in now amen I know amen I believe it's the season we're in now amen to think of this that this first one that comes to maturity amen now the beautiful thing is is when it comes to maturity amen that it means there's a field full there's more common there's more preachers in the field come on Church there's more Believers in the field there's more Sons and Daughters of God that have come into the field I don't I don't know how to explain it other than just simple for me but when when Albert Einstein come along he was a gift wasn't he Albert Einstein's mind was a gift God sinning of the earth I believe it falls under Daniel the 12th chapter knowledge shall increase in the Earth somebody has to manifest that has to come into a human being and God gave a mind like Albert Einstein inspiration dropped upon him and he put from the Tree of Life and More Death come from it remember that amen but he opened up an age an atomic age one man by inspiration opened up an age that everybody's now following and and simple people in elementary he's reading about it amen they're they're powering ships by they're doing War by they're doing medicine bites amen it's because of the atomic age and here we have a prophet who is the first member of that bride to come to maturity and the field is now full and the LIE is a harvest light and the Reapers that have come is working in a field that is right for Harvest it's the season to preach this message it's a season to believe this message it's a season to ripen hey man come on now come on it's a seasoned Church lay in the presence of the Sun for the ripening of the word of God is that right how many times brother Graham say it separate from the shuttle lay in the sun lay in the sun lay in the sun because it's the season to get under the message of the hour it's the sunlight and it's bringing the potential of the church to its fullness that's where we're sitting here tonight underneath that light I know I I know people ask me all the time about that Harvest rain it meant because it's harvest season you know so we use the word ladder rain and it scares people to death former latter rain so most people has latter rain somewhere's way out in the future we got to go through a tribulation you know God get beat up and persecuted there's got to be a boycott all these things has got to happen this and that well you know brother bam kind of presented that in early 50s but by the time he come to Feast the trumpets of 1964 he made a corner in his ministry amen and told the church that we wouldn't go through a tribulation or a persecution as the early church but the next thing that's going to happen in the church is a change of our bodies that we are laying under the light of the change of our bodies that's what's about to happen amen inside the seed that's making you live right you inside the seed that's making you think right believe right act right inside the sea that took you out of the bar that took you out of the Baptist that took you out and also lays the potential to step from one dimension to another to change from a marker to an immortal if you keep laying in the light amen it won't be long in your gray hair it's going to start turning black your body is going to go back to what it was to begin with amen we are not looking for a lot of rain the Bible says the former and the latter will fall together we are living under the latter rain power it's rapturing Faith time it's Holy Ghost time I know I know there's a lot of people not living under it but it ain't that God didn't pour it out now y'all ask ask the simple question what does the latter rain do it matures hey man what's this evening light doing it's maturing evening light a lot of rain it's the same thing it's rapturing Faith it's harvest time it's adoption time amen the first time brother man said come forth for a bright age not atomic age of right age that's got to come some bride to have a bright age somebody's got to reach maturity somebody's got to come to it no wonder William Branham improving his word announced that we have come to the marriage of the Lamb we're not going to be married we're already married that we're not living in a flirting age we're not living in a dating age this is not amen and engagement season this is the marriage of the Lamb when the bride has become a mature woman and took on the name and manifestation of the word of God what a season to focus on his word what a season amen what a season to give it amen for the first time will come a bright age for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism will be a message that the full maturity listen to that the message will be a full maturity the word has turned again into its power and is being waived over the People by the same signs and wonders as he did back there now listen this he was the Fulfillment of that word he was the manifestation of that word and so is it today God's word has been fulfilled at that hour that's the light God manifesting himself that's the light Jesus said I am the light of the world do you know that Jesus is the light the word manifested is Jesus that's who he is today he's his word manifested in Isaiah 45 amen it's said like it's in the 22nd verse look unto me all you be saved and all ye the ends of the Earth brother takes this scripture and preaches look look away to Jesus and look unto me all of those are bases upon not looking at the Corporal body of Jesus but looking at the works of God in the season that has been Vindicated you see the works has expressed God in the age that you're living in Jesus said don't believe me believe the works for they testify of who I am is that right then search the scriptures and in them you say you have eternal life and they are those that testify of me see what testified of God in the days of Pentecost it was a Reformation of gifts amen it was a testimony that was Jesus working on those people that was Jesus manifesting in those people and that same Jesus has manifested today but not just in gifts but in the fullness of his own word he says look unto me and be saved all ye ends of the Earth look unto me amen now brother man preaches a message Look Away to Jesus now he's not talking about looking away to his Corporal body he's talking about looking away from the world and looking on the manifestation of the Season you're living in in other words look Jesus Is Right Here among us tonight if you know where to look if you know how to look for him you'll see him right here tonight you'll see him right here in this building he's here in this building I can promise you that his word promises you that but you've got to know how to look for him to find him come on now hey man I I can take you to several examples but I'll give you one quick one there's a man sitting on the porch at 75 years old remember brother man come up want to go squirrel hunting amen and the man got to talking to him he said you preachers barking up the wrong tree he said I've been living here 75 years and I've looked in the creek looked in the woods been on the hill I ain't see no Jesus here nowhere within 15 minutes brother Branham showed him Jesus in that tree within 15 minutes he taught the man how to see the father amen you can see the father in the universe you can see him in his people you can see him in his word you see what it is he taught us how to look for him amen and if a man ever sees Jesus he'll never be the same again oh yes sir if you just look at your pastor like a man Samuel Browning you're going to look and you're gonna you'll have all kinds of thoughts and feelings but if you ever look and see a gift of God if you ever look and see Jesus using that man then it'll be a different man it'll be a different you it'll be a different feeling amen because you have seen Jesus do you know the Bible tells us that if you would look unto him and be saved brother Brown says it like this he said the ends of the Earth then the Earth has ended before right days of Noah didn't the Bible say in the days of Noah the Earth perished with water so the Earth ended right at the end of the Earth what happened a junction of time brother Brown said Enoch was there Noah was there Angels were there he said it was a season 56 uh Junction time you're gonna listen to it he uses the word omnipotent and miraculous a bunch in that season he said in the junction of time angels will appear he said and the omnipotent will speak and the miraculous will take place in that season see because amen there wasn't God didn't walk down among them in the days of Noah he gave them a revelation and they were looking at that Revelation at the ends because Noah's message was Christ or the salvation of that age that was how they were being saved in that season was a message now think about this amen look unto me and be saved what about what about Rahab her her Seasons come to an end her Jericho come to an end amen but God gave her something to look at he gave her a message from Joshua Joshua himself didn't even go there she received two men preaching an end-time message that God had changed the commission from Moses to Joshua and she believed them amen she'd never seen one Miracle she had only heard but she believed what she heard I think it's powerful amen sometimes you just got to believe God that's right do you see what she did she looked and it brought salvation to her now now in the Book of Numbers the Bible tells us that it would fire his serpents in the days of Moses when the people were murmuring and complaining when they got their eyes off of God look what happened they got disgusted with angels food can you imagine men have fallen out of the heavens having drank water from the rock having eat Quail meat that just was given to you supernaturally provisions and the next thing you know this provision amen they begin to murmur and complain against God's provision of heavenly man isn't it something amen but it was testifying the humanity of man it was testifying Humanity carnality if you stay in a desert long enough you're going to have troubles amen humanity is going to get at you amen if you start drying up problems start coming your way amen Little Blessings will come but you'll start letting the humanity get you now I'm going to tell you something I thought was amazing was the Bible said amen that when they begin to complain and murmur against God God sent fiery serpents among them right and they begin to bite them if you may ever think about this that it was a serpent that bit them amen that it was a serpent that was biting them amen now now I want you to think about this just a minute you ain't got to go very far to find a serpent hey man do you recognize that this old this old Flesh on the outside of you amen ain't redeemed yet do you know Paul said that this is the evil one amen that's why he said he's always with you brother Brian said it's time to separate from taste see feel smell here the evil one that's on the outside do you see this flesh is a hybrid thing it's an unredeemed thing and it's dying constantly is that right and it'll bite you if you quit looking at the cross if you quit looking at the things of God this thing starts rising up amen do you know Jesus said it he said I have power to lay down my life or I have power to pick it up again brother Brown said what that means is as a Son of God either you can lay that sin down and leave it in your past or he said you can resurrect that thing come on now sometimes people are suffering with things they're being bit by the lust of the flesh now the passions of the flesh it's abiding effect upon the serpent it's not you see it's the dirt it's the dirt of the earth amen amen not that when you when you see this I think it's amazing because God gave a remedy there in numbers he had Moses build a serpent and put it on a pole now he made that serpent out of brass and that's significant brother Brown said it was not significantly made in other words he said it might have just been the brass helmet he said of some of some Egyptian he said it was just brass because brass represents Divine judgment he said the stick was something just they picked up it was no importance at all but it represented a dead stick of course dead sticks do you recognize you're a human and you're off of the tree of life amen and that's death look at what this look this stick amen represented amen that curse it is he that dies on the tree now look this was representing the cross in this in this brass serpent see what did it mean who knows what caused the fall to begin with it was a serpent was it not and when God judged that serpent it was a Divine judgment and he gave the woman seed to go on the cross to kill the effects of the serpent and when Moses brought up the brass serpent in the wilderness it was a representation that the sin has already been judged and who will ever look at God's judgment on sin will be delivered from the effects and the power of sin look how they was delivered they wasn't delivered by prayer meetings come on they wasn't delivered amen by good situations or attendance of church or the offering they gave they were delivered by focusing their life on the Revelation that God had judged sin brother when they looked at it they could live now in case you think amen that God raised up the brass Serpent and all the serpents lost their power amen he left the fiery serpents in the field and put an atonement up to counteract the effects is that right then there were people out there dying for serpent bites and when people dying from The Works of the flesh at the same very hour there was other people who were feeling a victory over the bite of the serpent because they were focusing their lives on the Revelation that God had judged The Serpent and through this atonement I will receive my Deliverance do you recognize that God in this season has given you something to look at he's given you the word of God in this season you see what the word is in this season it is a commandment to you or a sign to you sin has already been judged baby now we're living after the cross friends we're living after the cross you know the Bible said if Moses be lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so the son of man be lifted up do you know the Bible said if he be lifted up he would draw all men unto him if we would lift him up tonight he would draw men to him amen what is it if we would lift up the word of God in this season and the power of that word amen that it would bring it now the problem is there's so many distractions problem is there's so much trouble there's so many distractions Satan is doing everything he can to distract the church amen and and the thing is that I believe that we need to refocus our Visions we need to refocus our minds we need to refocus our life you know I do a little bit of hunting now and then so when brother Brown says things on tape I get it and he says you know he says he said one day me and Billy Paul was standing we was looking out in the field and he said it was an antelope out there and he handed me a pair of glasses he said here Dad look through these and it was supposed to magnify what they were seeing he said but when I look through those glasses there was ten of them out there amen when you look through those glasses there were 10 of them out there he said but I knew in my mind there was only one he said so what I've done is I focused the glass until it matched what I knew to be the truth oh come on now do you see amen you can take ideas and doctrines of man and look through those at something and it'll change what you know it is you can know it is a certain thing you can know it's absolutely truth but somebody say well what about this how about this some and then they do you you see Focus can let me just put it like this they can take one God in the Bible and make him three to you if you look through their theology they can take things that are exactly clear in the vision but if you take their glasses it will distort what you know is really there so what you have to do is you have to focus the vision to match what you know to be the truth is remember when Moses is looking at the children of Israel when they're in Egypt amen now through Pharaoh's eyes they were slaves through Pharaoh's Focus look at what they were but when Moses started looking at them through a promise of Abraham they changed from slaves to Children Of Promise they changed from mud daubers to the Sons and Daughters of Abraham who were on the brink of Deliverance now if you're looking at the church Through The Eyes of pharaoh Through The Eyes of Egypt amen you see a bunch of miserable Fanatics you see people that looks like they're throwing their lives away but if you ever take the word of God and begin to focus down on the season you're living in you'll see some something different than you've ever saw you'll see the real truth the real children of God now here's the thing some people do not have the potential of focus some people's eyes are fixed and they don't have that little knob where they can focus it amen it's fixed a certain way and that's the only way they can see things but as the bride of Christ God put a focus button in you that if you will take the promised word and begin to look at it it will automatically adjust your vision to the promise that God has given in this season I'll tell you what a powerful thing that God adjusts you when you begin to look I I have several things brother M said about it but we'll just move on a little bit amen but I'll say this that when the focus of the word that's what will change you more than anything that you know of when you begin to focus in this word do you know that the thing to do in this season is the word itself amen is what's going to present to us rapturing faith the Vindicated word is what brings rapturing Faith it's what gives us identification of the presence of God do you know how to identify as presence brother Graham said you recognize his presence when the promised word for the age is manifested not the promised word of Moses or another age but the promised word of this age then you can recognize the presence of God when you start looking at the Vindicated word something must strike you he's here he's here in this place he's here in this room he's here in our hearts he is here Jesus promised to meet us in this place he promised to meet us in this Vindicated word then God is here tonight in this church you know if your eyes would come open just for a moment if your focus would change from the room from the situation from the problems of your life and you just for a moment begin to focus on a reality that Jesus is in this building right now it will change you it will change the way you're feeling right in this very moment if you could catch the Revelation that this place is full of the angels of God the Chariots of Fire are flying back and forth through this room the power of God is rolling down through here there's ways of the Waters of Revival that's pouring out of immortality splashing in to humanity tonight wave us your way to the power of God is falling in this room amen and if our spiritual conscience could just begin to focus on it Lord You're Here Lord your power is here you're here in reality then we begin to worship and we begin to worship something begins to release and the release of our marks begin to build a faith and Revival in our lives look what it is amen this message itself this message itself brings something for us to focus amen it'll bring rapturing Faith you know brother Mann tells us this he tells us in the message Look Away to Jesus I think it's a powerful Point Look Away to Jesus brother bam actually tells us of five manifestations of the third pull five manifestations of the third pull and he waves them in front of the people you know brother Ram was not a braggadocious man he wasn't one to brag so if he told us something he knew it would have a certain effect on the church he told us for the effect that it would have on the seed that's in your life do you see as long as it's in the Bible amen it can be questioned but when it becomes a reality it becomes a light to the hearer of that word look at look at the story he goes in the woods in Mark 11. remember and he creates a squirrel by Mark 11 if you say unto this mountain now you could ask for years what does it mean if you say unto this mountain what does that mean but when brother Adam was in the woods what it meant was that God had creative power that could be spoken through the lips of a man or a woman and when he spoke that word it was the light of Mark 11 the 23rd chapter 24th chapter right now he takes that and goes back to Hattie Wright's house and he brings that light over how do you write and while that light is shining on her there is something in her heart that agrees with that word and what he then it brought her up into her potential while she's hearing that message of how God created that amen there is a potential in her if you say unto this mountain be thou moved this shall be as you have said brother man said it's the first time that the third Pope ever was acted on human being he said when Hattie heard that remember she said it's nothing but the truth and when she said that's nothing but the truth brother Brian said it opened something up he said a greater anointing came on me than when I spoke the squirrel into existence it was an increase of anointing when the light struck the bright seed it was a union a man between the bride and the manifested word and it made an explosion in that life do you know some tonight church amen this message of the hour is not powerful until he gets into a Believer but when it comes into a believer's life it has the power to manifest itself in such a way that it'll shake the boots off of the devil amen I tell you what it is it's a manifesting power it'll take and change your life it'll change everything around you Satan ain't scared he's scared of us just shouting he ain't scared of a little emotion but what he's scared of is the stimulation of this Revelation that breaks in the heart of a believer in this season because it's power it's manifesting power hour how's caddy right about that power when her sons fell under that what about the tumor on sister meeting when the spoken word the tumor left her what about the resurrection of the little fish there's things to learn and all these if you focus just a little while when God resurrects a little fish by the spoken word well the man said look at how many people could he use that spoken word look at how many situations could have used it he said that God used it on a little fish he said to tell you that nothing is too little there ain't nothing too insignificant that God don't know about it that this word will not affect it'll affect everything in your life your fish and trips your hunting trips amen how you live how you talk how you walk what you do it's the light of the age manifesting on the Church of the Living God Amen I'll tell you what it'll do it'll change and I know people say well you can only have third pull if it happens in church but that's not true amen most of these manifestations did not happen in church because it's representing a life of an individual that lives every day for God look at brother Branham in the Woods fishing here he is in the woods in in hunting when the storm comes on the mountain and he speaks the word of God Amen and the storm has to go back where it came from because the word was spoken now listen amen if the devil can distract you from that then whatever storms you're experiencing that's just what you're stuck with but if you can focus on that story a little while amen then you start to believe something you start to believe that storms can change you start to believe that God can use the spoken word and change situations and I'm just one believer here tonight that believes amen that a man or a woman could be going through the greatest storms of their life but by the power of the spoken word they can drive back that storm and tell the sun to shine in the middle of their troubles I believe that amen that when this bride begins to focus on this word amen that things begin to change situations begin to change the way you feel about your everyday life begins to change if you just keep looking things will change amen I know I know I can sit here tonight and tell you we're in Revival we're in Revival and you may be the coolest you've ever been in your life you may not see nothing I'm talking about remember I'm prophesying I'm telling you by the word the bride's Revival we are in the middle of it whether it's affecting you or not is one thing but whether it's happening is another and brother let me tell you thus saith the Lord the move is on for the bride of Christ amen you might be missing it you might be sitting on the sidelines of it and somebody through theology has told you it's coming someday or this is going to happen or this is going to happen and it's changed the focus of what you're seeing but if you'll just keep looking at the promise after a while you will begin to adjust and see that this is a season like no other season the world is falling apart and the bride is standing stronger than it ever has here we are on a Saturday night and believe him and the power of God is in the church because it is the season of it it is the Revival of it I know I can tell you it's here amen but listen you got to keep looking because if you know it's here amen if you know it's here you keep looking till you get it yourself you'll keep looking if you're sure what you're hearing and saying it's here amen I'll use this example brother Adam used it he said oh Elijah remember Elijah went up on the mountain and sat down after fighting with Jezebel he said that he was so weary and tired and old that he put his head on his knees he said in his weariness and he just sat there with his head on his knees he said but he had prophesied rain he had set rain's going to come he said your rain's going to come he prophesied it was going to be there but gehaza was with him and heard the prophecy and he said to gehaza go look a Hazel go look and gehazi comes back and he says I didn't see nothing amen and Elijah said I'm telling you rain is coming and he went back he said I didn't see nothing and you know what Elijah wouldn't let him do Elijah would not let him stop looking until his Focus caught what God was doing in that very hour and when he finally saw it finally saw it he'd come running back he said I seen the cloud the size of a man's hand he didn't see a thunderstorm he didn't feel the rain but when Elijah saw a cloud the size of a man's head he said that's the rain I've been looking for good church think about it many amen it was a Vindication that his prophecy was true and he kept looking until he saw God in the moving of the word and when he saw it brother Braham said his sure revived his old heart he said he jumped up from where he was sitting he said and he must have been renewed because he outrun the Chariots onto the house of Jezreel and when he come running down the hill he come running in the middle of a cloudless day in the middle of a bright sunny sky and he's screaming get out the rain barrels get out the rain barrels I hear the sound of the abundance of rain he was announcing Rain by out oh come on Church we've had a cloud appear out here on Sunset we had a cloud come down in the evening time it shall be light and in Sunset mountains and in the evening time come the light of the son of man and when I see it I see both former in light of rain I hear the abundance of the revelation of the word of God and the season that I'm living in listen that word has struck this earth now it matters amen how it strikes you matters how it strikes you now I don't want to take an English class here tonight but there's two words always confuse me affect effect y'all know what a the the one that spells with a a fact and some of you is very educated I know a fact for a hillbilly was it was hard for me to get it but finally my my son sent me down said dad here's the difference affect is a tidal wave Hits California that happened he said effect is whether or not it destroyed your home he said it's struck that's a fact a fact but has it affected your house so I said oh I like that because I know a message has affected this Earth I know the message of the hour has came amen but brother it has affected my life has been an effect in my home there's been an effect in our churches as it affected our ministry this is the abundance of rain that God has promised in this season let me tell you some people I don't know some of y'all built like I am a good friend of mine brother mental Freedia they told me he said brother Wayne he said I do enjoy your preaching he said you're an emotional preacher he said but you don't preach emotion thank you I said that's absolutely the truth I enjoy emotion I enjoy the services when they get loud and shy but I Don't Preach emotion I'm not I'm not a preacher that preaches emotion I preach the word and the word ought to bring an emotion the word should stimulate something on the inside of you come on Church we've been taught by a message that what happened on the day of Pentecost was not an outpouring of emotion it was an outpouring of the promises of God and when the word came in there Jay ran oh Apostle Peter stood up and said this is that that Joel prophesied should come I'll pour out my spirit saith the Lord well I'll tell you what if you've heard about a bride's Revival I'm telling you this is that you've always wondered what that is this is that it's the thing that will make you survive the darkest of all ages it's the thing that'll make you survive the coldness of laodicea and all this all this covet nonsense amen but there's a bride who has still got lies in her are still a shout in her a still a rejoicing in her because her focus is on the word of God you know hey man I tell you what amen I I I I just love it when you start looking at these things Amen brother man said he accepted it that's why that's what ex that's what made Elijah that's what made Elijah excited when he accepted the cloud as the rain when you accept the message as Zechariah 14 that's when stimulating power comes amen when you accept the message as Revelations 10 as when you accepted his surprise Revival amen then it will affect you in such a stimulating power you can say this is that that job prophesied amen you can look and say this day this scripture is fulfilled in our midst then we know God has spoken then we know there's a land somewhere beyond this land come on Church your people here tonight that you've had so many evidences and Witnesses of that other land now you all know that brother Brown said wine is stimulating power right and according to acts the Bible said of refreshing shall come from the presence of God which is a bride's Revival a refilling to the Holy Ghost the Dynamics in the church that is supposed to come in the last day and when you realize that this message is fulfilling that it will bring a stimulating power into you the way it did in the upper room when those men recognize this is the promise of the hour and it's manifesting in my life look now what they did they left there with an Evidence of the promises of God didn't they not everybody entered the land but they entered that land and you know that brother bam types that back there when the children of Israel it was at kadus barnia and he said there was there was 12 of them went over he said and 10 of them come back with a negative report amen they were looking at the promises of Abraham 400 years past they have been delivered under a mosaic prophecy they had been seeing the pillar of fire they'd had the Red Sea open they had to eat of the Manna they had tasted of the water and they were looking at the lands of promise but there were some Giants in there and they lost their focus of the promises and they started looking at Giants and they came back with a testimony we are a bunch of grasshoppers well let me tell you they wasn't grasshoppers they were the Seed of Abraham they were the promised children of almighty God and if they wouldn't have lost focus of that brother they were giant slayers my goodness I I told the church the other night I'm about to I'm about to preach a message entitled Giants and milk and honey milk milk honey and Giants it was all in that land you know what brother man said them Giants were he said it's when you go and say God has healed me he said you've got to face Giants of knowing somebody else claimed the same thing and they died he said the land is Flowing with evidence of milk and honey there's plenty of people that have claimed their healing and lived there's plenty of people that has been healed but if you focus on the giant amen then you will become incapable of possessing the land somebody claimed they had the Holy Ghost and they backslid if that's your focus then you're going to sit and look at the evidences of all the Sons and Daughters of God that are true you see then you focus on the Giants amen but there were two of them Joshua and Caleb and they come back with some milk and honey and remember when they brought that milk and honey back amen what they did was they focused on the evidence of the land Amen Let me give you a quote brother Adam said this Vindicated word is the evidence this Vindicated word is the evidence of that other land amen and if you focus on the Giants and not the evidence amen then you lose your position with God and you lose who you are and you become a layout to sin and you're right you're no match for the devil but as the son of Abraham amen we are more than able to take this land and every promise of God that has been given to us we're more than able I was listened to the message the other day brother man we've got to preaching about this milk and honey I think it's powerful he said this whole milk and honey he said they said I'll tell you what it was he said that'd make a good Pentecostal cocktail that's pretty good quote isn't it it'll make a Pentecostal cocktail so what are you talking about brother Wayne I'm talking about that they would stimulate themselves with the power of taking that other Land by drinking of the milk and honey by taking of the evidence it would bring a cocktail in them that would make them believe hey man can I come put it in natural terms when people drink cocktails they go in the world they drink a cocktail they get six foot tall and bulletproof we call it amen in other words they become invincible and then they'll fight anybody say anything become bold become careless because of what they're drinking on and brother Brown said see the milk and honey that they brought back is a Pentecostal cocktail if you want to get drunk and and you want to express yourself in God just drink of the word of God until the blessings of God flows out in you [Applause] brother brother tonight I believe that the Church of the Living God ought to have plenty to drink I don't think we ought to just be a little Saturday night a social Drinker I believe we ought to just get slapped drunk in the Holy Ghost hey man somebody told me here a while back they said brother Wayne amen amen they said something about me and all the enjoyment of the church and things I said I tell you what I am I'm actually an addict I am a Jesus junkie that's what I am I'm a Jesus junkie you know the Bible said amen that in the days of Paul they were addicted to the ministry did you ever read that they were addicted to the word of God in other words brother William said we don't get our entertainment at picture shows we don't get our entertainment at the dance halls we get our entertainment when we come to the house of God and we drink a Pentecostal cocktail and the power of God falls in the room amen I tell you devils are slain hey can I say something to y'all tonight I believe we're more than able to do this I believe we're able to take this land I believe we're able to slay Giants I believe we're able to rise above every devil I believe we can have church in the middle of our trials we can oh I'll believe it now what am I talking about I'm talking about getting drunk It's a preacher I don't think we ought to get drunk but the man said we should amen not on the natural wine but on the new wine is that what he said y'all remember it he said same tape he he actually said this he said you know he said the other day they went down there he said it got real cold he said and there was an old drunk passed out out there in the street he said they picked him up the next morning he said they thought for sure probably had hypothermia they took him back down to the Salvation Army he said they cleaned him up and gave him bad put clothes on him brother Brown said they asked said well ain't you going to take him to the hospital somebody said oh no we no need to take that man to the hospital they said well it was it was blow freezing out there last night surely got hypothermia they said no no he had so much whiskey in his blood he said you could never freeze that man to death his his blood was full amen of intoxicating power and brother man said it like this he said I believe the church ought to get drunk enough until their blood gets full amen of that new wine is that right until the coldness of laodicea can't affect you I believe we ought to get drunk on the spirit of God and can we lose the cares of our life I'm on church this is your Revival this is your time this is for your refreshment and enjoyment what a season what an hour Amen to partake of the Vindicated word in the age you're living in if we would just look it would be changed tonight one look at it unveiled and you'll be changed it'll change you said well the way I looked at it 20 years ago but do you notice the way Paul says it he said beholding him Amen in other words continually just take a look and keep looking just keep your eyes on it and Satan will lose his power just keep looking lose its power just keep looking you'll see it it's there it's here tonight it's here tonight amen amen if you just stand with me tonight as your musicians come I believe Lord look away well look away and thank God there's something to look at tonight how many of you heard brother man said he said Satan point out every old hypocrite in church every failure Satan pointed out so either you're going to live with strength are you going to live defeated and the difference is is what you're going to look at what you're going to look at if you look and live then you got to look you got to look toward that word and when you see that word you'll see the serpent on the pole you'll see your sins already been judged you see the power of the blood you'll see it you'll see what the blood did for you so how in the world brother Brown creating squirrels how is that going to help me see William Branham can't create squirrels God had to do that so what he was showing you by that was that the blood is so powerful that was able to dismiss a man's sin to the extent that he could create by the word but if God did that for one man is he a respecter of person has he changed then whatever God did he will do he remains the same yesterday today and forever I don't know about you all tonight but I'd like to adjust my focus just just adjust it thank God you got the potential to do it if you get to looking at the failures and looking at the world looking at the problems looking at the if that's where you're looking then the discouragement will swallow your victory it'll take all the victory out of your life but if you look at the word then Victory will swallow the discouragement if you can look tonight you see he's got his hands lifted in Victory for you tonight he's got his hands lifted the serpents on the pole life has been given to the church it's in your potential tonight let's just buy our hearts together gracious Lord father we thank you tonight for this assembly for this group of people Lord we thank you for the anointing that's coming to the building Lord for the blessing of your word Lord a very receptive Church Lord very well taught in this word [Music] and father tonight I believe that we're just here to encourage them to adjust their focus Lord look away to you Lord to that great manifested word father we're focusing tonight on you and we ask tonight Lord as we focus on you to let it let it come into our life with the strength that it let the change in anointing Lord maybe some come in here tonight they're discouraged Lord situations in their lives and problems are rising but father tonight your Prophet said that a bird could be caught with the mouth of a serpent if it would paralyze it where it couldn't fly but oh if that bird could just look away it would break the spell now I pray tonight you break the spell Lord the enemy is contacted the senses of a Believer got him looking the wrong way I I pray tonight for your mercy God help us to adjust help us to take our focus and put it on this word now father we we lift our hands tonight together as a people and we ask you Lord give us give us a little that wine Lord let us drink a little to our our cares of life would just leave us let us just think of you and drink of you oh God now father we commit this meeting to thine hands we ask your blessing father in Jesus [Music] is in his heaven to me [Music] your prayers [Music] is heaven in me [Music] me who is like you Lord in all the Earth matches love and beauty and this word [Music] nothing in this world will satisfy Jesus you're the cop that won't run dry your prayers Presence is Heaven to me [Music] the Lord your prayers his heaven to me [Music] Treasure of my heart and of my soul in my weakness you are you are merciful [Music] Redeemer of my past and present wrong s you're the holder of my future Days to Come your presence in his Heaven to Me Lord your prayers his Heaven to Me brother Samuel [Music] and all my days on Earth I will await the moment that I see you face to face nothing in this world will satisfy foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] to me [Music] your presence in his Heaven to Me please your prayers his head heaven to me Lord your presence is heaven to me [Music] how many appreciate the word of the Lord tonight amen amen we've come we've come to be admonished come to be strengthened and edified in the word of God and how brother Brandon would put it so clearly that real spiritual edification is the holy ghost coming into the church and taking that word and is the word itself is going forth It's the word that really brings true edification everything else outside of that is it's nothing it'll it'll leave so quickly but the word is what brings real growth and real building in our lives you know some of the things and you you think about it how the Holy Spirit took it here tonight in such a way I say it like this I don't have many other ways to say things sometimes but to me God made it so simple that you could put in your lunchbox and you take it with you because that's what this message is all about it's about reproducing deity in flesh because that pre-prepared ground that's that seed that's the womb that's the place that brother Ram says is the temple that's made without hands that you and I couldn't even receive God says God releases the faith to you and I and then it's God's faith in us receiving himself into his place in our lives what more can you and I what can we say but it's the grace of God the things that God would make so clear to us in this time the powers brother Wayne was saying that I would just matter of fact I was over here earlier today right standing right down in the middle of the aisle and those are the very words that I echoed right out in prayer is God the power of this revelation of election operating in our hearts and lives it's it's liberating when the word of God comes into our lives it liberates you you know you can a person can sense that an individual we can sense in this atmosphere it's a liberty and there should be Liberty in the house of God but that same Liberty of the presence of God that we feel here it's a liberty where it if you have something you're able to take it and lay it down that's what the Liberty in the house of God brings then you can walk on into that Liberty and have that Liberty every moment of your life that's what this message has come to do amen I I'll tell you I I just thank God I I just say Amen to it I believe that with all my heart I know it to be the truth I'm a witness of it how many are witnesses I'm a witness of this I'm not looking for the path of Glory back into sonship to come this message is the revealed path back into sonship amen it is this word that has taken us Beyond the Veil into the place of adoption this is where we're standing tonight in this hour it becomes more and more clear the further up the road we get it becomes more clear the things that brother Brandon would bring out and say right from the scripture that if you weren't the word in the beginning you can never be the word now but because you were the word in the beginning then in the presence of every other king because there's a lot of powers right now there's a king of Sodom King a lady you'll see all other kings but Abraham never released any honor to any of them other kings but he caught Melchizedek in the midst of all those other kings he released all honor to Melchizedek the surrendering of his life the paying of tribute the tithe the surrendering of all and that was represented that was prophecy that was a shadow of you and I right now where we would stand in this hour and to recognize its Melchizedek who's in our midst king of Peace king of righteousness I tell you what a privilege we what a privileged people but you see how how the Holy Spirit brought it here tonight in such a way that that's Satan's objective is to try to get the focus broken I tell you I personally believe it like this I believe all this stuff with covet and everything else I believe it was something subtly that came in and brought an attack to break the focus away from where it needs to be if if anybody could just take it in the right way and to recognize it's Satan trying to take the focus away from the Church of the Living God trying to infringe upon god-given rights that belong to us as the children of God but it's not just that Satan can come in through family he wants remember he rides in innocently on a white horse things come in very innocently with the objective to know if he can take our Focus away then he affects the power and the victory in our life I don't know about you but I believe I'm speaking for all of us I don't want to just be a surface level Christian there's no satisfaction in that I I don't I'm not satisfied with that you know how it is when there's been a time maybe something's come up in your life and and there's been things come up and I I just say I just need to get alone and talk to him you say brother Sammy you can pray without ceasing I know that but there's times where I say I just need to hear from him let me tell you let me tell you about something that just happened last weekend you know I was there in in Washington DC and the brother dropped me off at the hotel we had had fellowship and I I got to you know I was having having a little bit of problems with my leg and things my knee and things had come up from some things from the week and I called my wife I said I know I need to take a little bit of Motrin and you say brother Samuel did you pray I did I was listening to a message I claimed my healing so I went over and I thought well there's a place out here out front they told me I could go order some food from I said well I need to go I'm gonna go order a little something there and so I can take it and take my vitamins and everything else so I went there well I sat down there and you know you have to go order and I'm sitting right here at the counter and a fella looks over at me and he says hey you just passing through I said uh no I said yeah I said in one way I am I said he said well what are you here for I said well I'm here for for a meeting tomorrow oh he said you know I could tell he was already Lord what do I do here do I was telling me Lord do you want me to say anything or any and he and he found out he said oh you're a preacher he said well he said I'm just lost as lost can be I'm just a lost soul I said you don't have to stay that way I said that's your choice if you stay that way well [Music] little by little different things and that man got so I didn't say nothing purposely to rile him up but he got so riled up and started swearing at me I said sir I did not mean to offend you I said but what I am telling you is this world will be judged by the word of God I said I'm sorry for every misrepresentation that you've ever had come your way but I am telling you that this world and you will be judged by this word [Music] I walked out of there you know how it is you get in this situation your spirit's all I thought I wasn't talking about the man but I thought you devil I began to think in my mind should I have come over here and got anything to eat or not I really I mean I began to think about that because I said I know what I have what I'm to minister in the morning but I just my mind I'm just telling you this by the grace of God I just said in my mind I got over there the room and I don't like eating by myself but you know that's what happened that night so I got in the room you know sometimes we sat down and I thought well I'm just going to open up my app from a local news right here I write down I said no I'm not doing that my spirit is all troubled what you do I put on a message there were already messages I want to list you I just put on a message started started eating let me tell you something I put on message after message that night it's just such a piece came right in that room it just settled it you recognize it was the enemy's advancement I didn't mean to take time with that but I'm just trying to tell you how subtle we know that that Satan will try to break our Focus but the resource that we have in this hour don't don't go anywhere else you have we have it on our phones we have it we can go and begin to listen to the message of the hour and the very thing that God spoke in the beginning of this thing constantly in that word that's where Satan wants to try to affect us you say there's some things that don't make sense to me if you lay in the presence of the sun eventually what you absorb now becomes light it becomes understanding in you God begins to connect the dots he's not left it to you and I to connect it but if we can just stay focused in that word and say God if I if I've got out of Step a little bit you know all it takes is a half step to get right back in step it takes a half step get right back in step I'm thankful to hear the voice of God and aren't you glad to have a focus in this hour little things little things subtly can come in family on and on and on things that are harmless but it's meant to try to take our Focus away from him in reality we all know there's nothing we can do in our own strength to address the storm or the situation but if we can just rest in him then he'll give us the strength not only to Wade through that storm but to speak to that story we'll have authority instead of the storm controlling us We Now by deity yielding to him he's now controlling the storm yield to him greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world amen you believe that tonight well I'll tell you his his presence is here [Music] he's here [Music] and let's just bow our heads Lord Jesus [Music] sometimes the Lord I don't feel like thank you is enough but Lord please see beyond the words and I know you do into my heart to the Heart Lord of your children it's gathered here tonight different ones that would would love to be here tonight Lord and not able to be here I pray God help us Lord I believe that's what you've done tonight you've come to minister it's such Simplicity to our hearts to just focus I thought that was so powerful tonight Lord how that Elijah would not allow gehaza to rest but he kept sending him back Lord God I'd say the Lord as long as we have life and we are standing here God in this earth Lord that that same Holy Spirit that's crying out Lord that no matter of every obstacle and every unbelief that would come but there is a reality Lord that we can speak out and we can say and to know go look again God we're thankful Lord that you continue to reveal and make yourself known Lord to lives and hearts and to Lord encourage Hearts to just look away to you Lord [Music] how powerful it is how true that just one time lord just to see you one time it changes it changes our life what I'm a witness and I know I'm speaking tonight to other witnesses as well Lord God how we thank you Lord for your mercy Lord in this hour help us Lord help each and every one Lord those Lord that would even be tuning in streaming Lord from their homes God help us Lord I pray may we know God our lives every step be evaluated Lord by the word of God may we just Lord knowing that As We Lay in that word we don't have on our own to discern good from evil but Lord as Paul told the Believers that the eating of strong meat and to eat it that you might have your senses exercise to discern good and evil God I thank you Father for a word in this hour of the Lord that is the standard lord inside of the hearts of the believer Lord a word Lord to meet the challenge of the enemy in this hour Lord God you have supplied all that we have need of Lord all that we must do is drink drink and push out Lord granted Lord we don't want to be social drinkers we want to be drunks on the Holy Ghost oh God granted Lord Jesus granted Lord God Lord Jesus how we thank you Lord thank you Lord Jesus may you refresh our brother tonight Lord oh God should you tarry Lord even as we look Lord toward the morning Lord I believe right now God that even as a life Lord and a Heart Lord just looking to you no matter if they're sitting there in their living room Lord streaming or they're right here just looking to you I believe that God would ever promise that you've stirred Lord in their heart to look to I believe dear God that the effect of that word Lord God can go to work right now Lord for the angel of the Lord is not restricted Lord in time or barriers Lord God or in walls of a building Lord God but father you will go Lord God to manifest your word just as you passed through the neighborhood Lord there in Indiana Lord that day you're the same Angel of the Lord to pass through Lord the neighborhoods Lord and to fulfill your word and your promise Lord granted Lord we pray

you've got an adjuster that's there you can reach right up and you can adjust that and you begin to see things the right way thank God for his grace on that many times we've been in the Blind and Zachary is usually the one that's using the binoculars for me because I get all fogged up on my glasses but I'll tell him you go ahead and look and he usually can pick the stuff out but you know how it is you just gotta adjust that just a little bit and it takes things from being blurry that you can actually see it it magnifies it I'm grateful to God in this hour that there's a focus button on our lives aren't you glad sometimes things look so blurry but Jesus just comes right around there's a man that can turn on the lighting Right Touch This to this and just just bring it in Focus right here a little bit oh I'm so glad about that I just love him don't you I just appreciate him tonight he's so good I could never get enough of him I can't get enough of him I can't get enough of him
