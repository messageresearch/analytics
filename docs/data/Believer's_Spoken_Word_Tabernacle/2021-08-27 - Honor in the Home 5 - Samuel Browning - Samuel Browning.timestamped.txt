[37:30] if you would would you turn with me to
[37:33] first corinthians 13.
[37:51] okay now i should be
[37:53] i'm on
[37:54] okay
[37:58] all right
[37:59] it should be is it okay is it coming
[38:02] through
[38:03] okay
[38:05] all right let's just let's go here to
[38:09] first corinthians 13 let's just jump
[38:11] straight to
[38:12] verse four
[38:18] charity suffereth long
[38:20] and is kind
[38:22] charity envieth not
[38:25] charity vaunteth not itself
[38:28] it is not puffed up
[38:30] and doth not behave itself unseemly
[38:34] seeketh not our own it's not easily
[38:36] provoked
[38:38] and thinketh
[38:39] no evil
[38:41] amen may god bless you bless the reading
[38:43] of the word as you're being seated
[38:46] as we just keep drawing from this as the
[38:49] lord would just inspire to our hearts
[38:52] there's many things when you look in the
[38:54] very first few scriptures and what is
[38:57] wrote there in verses one through three
[39:01] if
[39:02] if that is all that was
[39:04] required or the expectations
[39:08] for serving the lord well
[39:10] there probably would be many people who
[39:12] would go along with that from verses one
[39:14] two and three because
[39:16] those are things that a person you could
[39:18] see my people would be complimentary
[39:20] this person they sacrificed their life
[39:24] this person prayed for someone and they
[39:26] were healed
[39:27] this person spoke in tongues and god god
[39:30] uttered out
[39:32] you know
[39:33] just a tongue of angel and here it was
[39:35] interpreted my look at it that come to
[39:37] pass but we recognize that a christian
[39:40] walk
[39:41] all of these things are necessary to a
[39:43] christian walk it should be it will be a
[39:46] life of sacrifice
[39:48] but the sacrifice itself while paul was
[39:50] drawing this that it's not about self
[39:53] because you realize that a lot of times
[39:55] even within sacrifice sacrifice can be
[39:58] drawn but and it was it can be made
[40:00] known and it draws attention to self but
[40:03] real true sacrifice that's governed by
[40:05] love it never draws attention to self
[40:09] and that's one thing that paul is is
[40:11] dealing with here that this this charity
[40:14] the love of god
[40:16] is not a
[40:17] self-serving love
[40:20] it's a love that seeks the very
[40:23] the very best what is what is uh on
[40:27] behalf of the other person or the other
[40:30] individuals it's not about self
[40:32] and the reality is that when you and i
[40:35] come here into this earth here we come
[40:37] by the first birth the first birth
[40:40] is a very selfish
[40:43] birth
[40:44] it's always about self
[40:46] and we find ourselves even after the new
[40:49] birth has come it gives us and equips us
[40:52] with a power
[40:54] to rule over
[40:56] that first nature
[40:58] it gives us a strength and it's
[40:59] something that every day of our life
[41:02] that
[41:02] we have to bring that we have to bring
[41:05] that other part of our lives in
[41:07] subjection
[41:08] brother bran would say it like this in
[41:09] one place there when he's asked to
[41:11] explain romans 7 and he would speak of
[41:14] how that once that wheat life is entered
[41:17] into our life and it brings about a
[41:20] change in our life it's not a change
[41:23] of something that we are trying to do
[41:25] but now there's a new life that's set
[41:28] down in us and it's a desire for god's
[41:31] life to be brought forth in our life but
[41:34] yet we are still housed about with that
[41:36] old cockerborough nature and we've got
[41:38] to bring it subject all the time and our
[41:41] strength it comes from the lord
[41:44] this is why each and every day of our
[41:46] life we can never even of the things
[41:48] that we've been looking into in the word
[41:51] of god
[41:52] these are not things that are just when
[41:54] we can look at it in one way and say
[41:56] well it's an automatic in the life
[41:58] that's lived out of us and that is true
[42:01] there's a desire that is in our hearts
[42:03] to please god it's a desire to live for
[42:06] god and there are times in our life when
[42:09] there are things that are called for by
[42:11] the word of god and it rubs our first
[42:13] man in the wrong way it challenges us in
[42:17] a certain place and it brings us to a
[42:19] place to realize this is something in an
[42:22] area that i need to die more in my life
[42:25] lord i need your grace and your strength
[42:27] and my life
[42:29] just thinking of it the other day i was
[42:30] in prayer and began to rehearse
[42:33] different things of how brother branham
[42:35] would put it to me it's just so
[42:37] beautifully placed in the message three
[42:39] kinds of believers and brother adam you
[42:41] know he would talk about the tests and
[42:43] trials of life and he says i i don't
[42:45] pray that god would take the test and
[42:48] trials from me but i ask him for grace
[42:51] to go through him and when you think
[42:53] about that as brother brown would work
[42:55] with that in that message that the tests
[42:57] and trials that come our way
[42:59] they are they are predestinated from the
[43:02] hand of god to actually bring about a
[43:04] trying a molding a shaping it's for our
[43:09] good these are not things that has just
[43:12] happened to us but god has permitted it
[43:14] it's to mold us and shape us it brings
[43:17] us to a place of a dying more to
[43:20] ourselves it brings us to a greater
[43:22] realization there's a greater one on the
[43:26] inside that is greater than all of my
[43:29] feelings greater than all of my thoughts
[43:31] it's an anchor that holds within the
[43:35] veil
[43:36] and that's a place that we can draw from
[43:38] in our lives that when situations arise
[43:41] we we should never as believers shirk
[43:44] away from it but we should go to god in
[43:47] prayer and ask god and say lord give me
[43:50] the grace that i need in this situation
[43:52] or the outlook that i need lord help me
[43:55] to be in a place that what needs to be
[43:58] molded in my life can be molded in my
[44:00] life right now even of our feelings
[44:03] regarding certain things maybe an
[44:05] offense has come the bible said offenses
[44:09] will come and we need the strength of
[44:12] god in our life to take it to the lord
[44:14] in prayer not just say well it don't
[44:16] affect me we've got to be honest and
[44:18] real god will always respect honesty and
[44:22] that honesty is to say lord i am
[44:25] offended but god your grace is greater
[44:28] and lord that you would come and remedy
[44:31] that offense that wound in my spirit
[44:35] that charity could have the place in my
[44:37] life
[44:39] see this is why the bible says give no
[44:41] place to the devil
[44:43] paul would write let not therefore sin
[44:46] reign in your mortal body that said we
[44:49] don't want to allow a place of anything
[44:52] a thought a feeling of those things to
[44:54] come about sometimes it takes a period
[44:57] of time of praying about these things
[44:59] and putting it before god in prayer
[45:02] and i i believe that when we look at
[45:04] this in the scripture just little tokens
[45:07] how god would bring out to us even in
[45:10] these moments that you see the very
[45:12] first thing that we started with there
[45:14] in verse 4 charity suffereth long all of
[45:18] those other things in verse 1 verse 2
[45:21] verse 3
[45:22] all of those things are great things but
[45:24] if they're not governed by charity then
[45:27] it's not even reckoned up in the
[45:29] presence of god
[45:31] there's got to be a greater substance
[45:33] there than every bit of of signs and
[45:37] things that are all out here there's got
[45:39] to be something on the inside to where
[45:41] it comes down as the scripture said
[45:44] charity suffereth long there's a case
[45:46] that i can say not one of us here would
[45:49] raise our hand and say you know i want
[45:51] to be long-spirited because we realize
[45:54] that in order to be long-spirited it's
[45:56] going to be situations arise that
[45:58] require that
[46:01] in order for chant you see these
[46:02] scriptures we just read here are not
[46:04] scriptures that are expressed on the
[46:06] mountaintop they're expressed in the
[46:08] valley
[46:09] are you with me suffering long well they
[46:11] don't need to suffer long if everything
[46:13] everybody's agreeing with you
[46:14] everything's going just right they're
[46:16] petting you the right way there ain't no
[46:17] need to suffer because there ain't any
[46:19] suffering but it's when certain things
[46:21] come along our way that are we actually
[46:23] able to have let charity have its course
[46:26] in our life and let charity suffer
[46:29] throne because charity when charity
[46:31] suffereth long charity itself is not
[46:35] something that's waiting for the next
[46:36] opportunity to say ha ha i've been doing
[46:39] this hey i've been i've been i've been
[46:41] taking all this look what i've been
[46:42] doing i've been doing that's not charity
[46:45] that's us
[46:48] but charity suffereth long it doesn't
[46:51] build up records
[46:53] it's kind notice it it doesn't envy it
[46:57] doesn't vaunt itself and it's not puffed
[46:59] up it does not behave itself unseemly
[47:03] this is a this is a big statement we've
[47:05] been looking at it does not behave
[47:08] itself unseemly even in those times
[47:11] that it things that you and i could feel
[47:14] like this would be merited and we've got
[47:17] rights you realize as americans we've
[47:19] got rights and we've got privileges but
[47:22] the privileges of sons and daughters of
[47:25] god the privileges of god it trumps
[47:28] every american right there's a lot of
[47:31] american rights we appreciate we're
[47:33] thankful for but when it comes to
[47:36] certain things because there's american
[47:38] rights that say well you know a person
[47:40] can live as a homosexual and everything
[47:42] else and really there's laws against it
[47:44] in the book in every local city but you
[47:46] see they look past all of those things
[47:49] but to realize there's a greater
[47:51] privilege that we have and that's the
[47:53] privilege of god we don't look at well i
[47:56] can live sinful we look at the privilege
[47:58] that i get to live a christian life i
[48:02] i'll forfeit every american privilege
[48:05] for that privilege to have my god-given
[48:08] privileges to serve god
[48:12] so charity itself must be
[48:15] what is there to direct our lives it's
[48:18] charity that moving within our lives
[48:21] that how that we see it it it brings
[48:24] about a real honor and that's what we've
[48:26] been dealing with here out of verse 5
[48:29] that rather than acting unbecomingly but
[48:32] but rather acting with honor and you
[48:35] know the scriptures as we're dealing
[48:37] with this here of honor in the home
[48:41] and you know every one of us when we
[48:43] look at it here
[48:44] it's just like in a local assembly
[48:47] we get around one another long enough
[48:49] and we're going to see one another some
[48:51] faults and mistakes
[48:54] is that right
[48:55] we're going to know well this the wrong
[48:57] key or this is wrong or that we get
[49:00] around one another this is where it
[49:02] takes a lot of love
[49:04] it don't take a lot of love to go from
[49:06] here to there to there
[49:08] but it takes a lot of love to as you're
[49:10] staying right here with a group of
[49:12] believers in fellowship to be able to
[49:15] overlook one another's mistakes because
[49:18] we all
[49:20] have them
[49:22] we all have faults nobody has angels
[49:24] wings on now
[49:25] we all have our own faults and our own
[49:28] mistakes and we all need the grace of
[49:31] god
[49:32] that it would work as a relationship as
[49:35] a local body are you hearing me
[49:37] it's the same way with a husband and
[49:39] wife you know
[49:41] you know after you're married well now
[49:43] you're seeing where those curls come
[49:45] from those curls come from laboring and
[49:48] putting in the curlers and the hair so
[49:50] that when you showed up the curlers were
[49:52] already there
[49:54] or the curls were there you know
[49:56] everything now you know you're beholding
[49:58] all of these things you know to where
[50:00] that when he got you know uh when you
[50:03] seen him if he still had hair at least
[50:05] it was combed you know teeth was brushed
[50:07] and everything else was was good to go i
[50:10] mean his clothes look pressed and neat
[50:12] and as far as you knew he hung up his
[50:14] towel after taking a shower
[50:18] come on now oh my we're already getting
[50:19] quiet i mean you didn't see all those
[50:21] faults and all those things that are
[50:23] there you know and things laying in the
[50:25] floor you didn't see all of that you
[50:26] weren't even thinking about that
[50:29] you were thinking about that person are
[50:32] you hearing me tonight that's who you
[50:34] fell in love with
[50:36] they had the mistakes they had their
[50:38] faults all along
[50:41] oh my god did not choose you and i
[50:44] because we were mistake-free we were
[50:46] fault-free
[50:49] he never chose us because of that but i
[50:51] think our brother branham would turn and
[50:53] i don't know who the brother is but he
[50:54] said thank brother mike how that god
[50:56] would look clear from there in eternity
[50:59] and god would choose you and i and
[51:01] knowing all of our mistakes knowing all
[51:04] of our shortcomings but yet god chose us
[51:07] because our mistakes and our faults are
[51:10] not who we really are
[51:13] but we are who we are by the grace of
[51:16] god it's his choosing he chose himself
[51:23] and that's where we rest with him
[51:26] is coming back to that principle because
[51:29] when we you know in reality as a husband
[51:32] and wife and i just moved back and forth
[51:34] we did not choose one another because we
[51:37] fit one another's descriptives so
[51:39] perfectly
[51:41] are you hearing me it wasn't because
[51:43] well every t was dotted and every eye
[51:46] was doubted but there was something
[51:48] there was something that was unseen it
[51:51] was an unseen force it was love that
[51:55] drove you to relinquish other friends it
[51:58] was love that brought you to a place to
[52:01] ask her to marry you and it was love
[52:04] that brought you to a place to accept
[52:06] that that that a proposal from that man
[52:10] are you with me
[52:11] it wasn't it wasn't somebody having a
[52:13] gun in your back
[52:16] it was love that did that
[52:20] so love itself now let me just say that
[52:22] i'm saying it being very purposeful in
[52:24] this right here as he's bringing this to
[52:26] me that's something that can that we
[52:29] always have to be mindful of and say god
[52:32] don't let that love escape or leak out
[52:35] of my life and if it does we got to be
[52:38] honest with god and say lord i need a
[52:40] refilling of the love of god
[52:44] brother and sister i'm telling you we
[52:45] can never get too much of the holy ghost
[52:49] you can never even the things that we're
[52:51] bringing right here the teaching as it
[52:53] goes back and forth from spiritual into
[52:56] natural let me just tell you something
[52:58] you can never get anything out of the
[53:00] word of god just in your own measure
[53:03] like it comes when the holy spirit can
[53:06] actually move and energize our hearts in
[53:09] a union with that word he's the life
[53:12] giver of the word
[53:15] are you hearing me tonight there's a
[53:17] love of god that must move down within
[53:19] our life love you know how it is love
[53:22] causes people to do strange things
[53:25] are you hearing me
[53:27] level calls people you know a young lady
[53:29] can be in love and she's so caught up in
[53:31] thinking about him she'll put ice cream
[53:33] in the microwave and it goes in the
[53:36] freezer
[53:37] now you look at that and say how could
[53:38] that be because she's so caught up even
[53:41] though she's doing these things in her
[53:43] natural home but she's so caught up with
[53:46] thoughts about him and he's caught up
[53:49] with thoughts about her
[53:53] then then you begin to talk to him about
[53:55] the toils of the road
[53:57] they begin to look at tests or trials or
[53:59] things that's coming up there's a joy
[54:02] that's there
[54:05] my
[54:07] here in in ephesians 5 let me just read
[54:10] here from this a little bit and pull a
[54:12] little bit more
[54:14] in ephesians 5 and we've been reading
[54:16] through this and i want to i want to
[54:17] come back into this in verse 21
[54:20] submitting yourselves one to another in
[54:23] the fear of god
[54:24] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[54:27] husbands as unto the lord
[54:30] for the husband is the head of the wife
[54:33] even as christ is the head of the church
[54:36] and he's the savior of the body
[54:39] therefore as the church is subject unto
[54:42] christ so let the wives be to their own
[54:45] husbands in everything
[54:48] husbands love your wives even as christ
[54:51] also loved the church
[54:53] and gave himself for it
[54:57] now i want you to think god
[54:59] never left it to the church to purify
[55:03] themselves
[55:04] [Music]
[55:06] god never left it up to you and i
[55:08] because there's no way you and i could
[55:10] do this
[55:12] but he gave himself
[55:15] he didn't give a letter he didn't give a
[55:17] doctrine he gave himself
[55:20] because there's nothing can replace him
[55:25] are you hearing me
[55:26] brothers let me tell you something
[55:28] there's nothing that in reality within
[55:31] that home and in that marriage there's
[55:33] nothing can replace that position and
[55:36] that desire that god has for you and for
[55:40] that little wife he's given you
[55:43] nothing you say well shouldn't it be
[55:45] that of the lord yes the lord has first
[55:47] place because the husband is under that
[55:49] but nothing nothing can replace that god
[55:54] has placed you there as the leader of
[55:57] that home to be the one who is available
[56:00] to god to receive the guidance and
[56:04] leadership for that home for that for
[56:06] the direction within that on god never
[56:09] put that responsibility to that of the
[56:11] woman god entrusted that responsibility
[56:14] to the man
[56:17] that's the responsibility that is that
[56:19] is had so notice that within this that
[56:23] he gave himself
[56:24] it's him that has alone has that to have
[56:27] the rightful place in our lives to where
[56:30] everything revolves around our life i
[56:32] want you to think of this
[56:34] the real signification of the wife of
[56:37] the lord jesus christ
[56:39] is is that he has sought her out by his
[56:43] word by revealing himself and she it's
[56:47] revealed within her as she submits to
[56:51] his voice and his leading and becomes
[56:54] united with him so that her life
[56:57] expresses him
[56:59] this is why the church world is not the
[57:02] life of the lord jesus
[57:04] they'll go to a certain degree but they
[57:07] won't take all the word
[57:09] they'll take certain things but they
[57:10] want their own doctrines that's why god
[57:14] will not marry anyone who will not come
[57:17] fully to his word that's why the bible
[57:20] said in acts 5 acts 5 48 i believe it is
[57:23] that he giveth the holy ghost to them
[57:25] that obey him
[57:29] not their tenants of belief
[57:32] not their scroll on the back wall
[57:34] but obey him
[57:37] you know not too long ago uh i'm gonna
[57:40] i'm just gonna be careful where i say
[57:42] where i where i was but i was in a uh a
[57:44] denominational church and i you know
[57:47] you hear about a lot of times the
[57:48] tenants and i've read different things
[57:50] as well but you know i turned around and
[57:52] i was going out and i looked on that
[57:55] back wall and there was a banner of
[57:57] everything that they believed
[57:59] and it was a long banner and i took a
[58:01] picture of it
[58:02] it was a long banner of everything they
[58:04] believed so in order to be a part of
[58:07] their system you've got to believe what
[58:10] they believe
[58:13] but where did those beliefs come from
[58:16] now man can probe into it according to
[58:19] the light he has but when further light
[58:22] and truth is come
[58:25] we must walk on with the truth
[58:28] is that right this is why
[58:30] the bible would say that we're not to
[58:32] give heed to the doctrines of devils
[58:36] is that right
[58:37] how brother branham so so so uh
[58:40] specifically states that that
[58:42] trinitarian doctrine came straight from
[58:44] the pits of hell
[58:47] that's his words and it's exactly where
[58:49] it come because it comes satan wants to
[58:52] tamper with the word to try to get at
[58:55] the real relationship
[58:57] of god coming present in christ to be
[59:01] united with his people
[59:05] and i looked at that and that's one of
[59:06] the things that you'll see that
[59:08] separates for that of a wife i mean
[59:11] which one of you as a brother
[59:13] would have married your wife or would
[59:15] marry her if she says i'll go along with
[59:17] this but i ain't going along with that
[59:20] that's a futile mission
[59:23] oneness doesn't come after marriage it
[59:26] further develops but there's got to be
[59:29] oneness before marriage is that right
[59:33] this is why even when you look at how
[59:35] god brought all of them out of egypt
[59:37] there and he took him into the promised
[59:39] land or he he has them in the wilderness
[59:41] it was a proving time it was a time to
[59:44] see notice did god not know what was in
[59:47] their heart
[59:48] god knew what was in their heart but god
[59:51] said this time has been allotted to know
[59:54] what was in your heart
[59:56] the time let me tell you something the
[59:58] time did not do away with what was in
[1:00:01] their heart neither did time put into
[1:00:04] caleb's heart what was already there but
[1:00:07] time only manifested what was there all
[1:00:12] along
[1:00:14] and sometimes there are things that time
[1:00:17] itself has to manifest
[1:00:20] are you hearing me
[1:00:21] time has to manifest there's things
[1:00:23] sometimes we can look at something a
[1:00:25] certain way feel about it or think about
[1:00:28] it but thanks be to god we can put it in
[1:00:30] the hands of god and know for sure if
[1:00:33] we're trusting in the lord the bible
[1:00:35] speaks of how that god himself will lead
[1:00:38] and guide us into all truth and we can
[1:00:41] look to god for that you see these
[1:00:43] things as it came about there within
[1:00:46] israel it only manifests what was
[1:00:48] already in their heart the whole time
[1:00:51] and you know but then as caleb and them
[1:00:53] they came on in to the promised land it
[1:00:56] was manifesting the whole time that they
[1:00:59] were a part of that word through and
[1:01:02] through as a matter of fact when it came
[1:01:05] time for caleb to take his mountain he
[1:01:08] said he rehearsed what took place on
[1:01:10] that side of jordan he said i brought
[1:01:13] word again to moses according to as it
[1:01:17] was in my heart
[1:01:19] it was not just a word he had heard with
[1:01:21] his ears or a word that he had heard
[1:01:24] proclaimed or preached over him but that
[1:01:26] word had found a mark in caleb's heart
[1:01:30] and that was there in his heart the
[1:01:33] whole time and here was a uniting and
[1:01:37] manifesting even as god would declare
[1:01:39] that caleb my servant caleb he hath
[1:01:42] another spirit he hath followed me
[1:01:45] fully
[1:01:47] so there's a difference here when we
[1:01:49] when we look at that he gave himself how
[1:01:52] that the lord jesus gave himself and i
[1:01:54] want to say it like this
[1:01:56] he gave himself as our sacrifice
[1:02:01] but i want to work with this a little
[1:02:02] bit here and how god will just deal with
[1:02:05] this tonight but he didn't do it
[1:02:07] grudgingly
[1:02:10] this is a paradox how that a life can be
[1:02:13] lived in sacrifice and it's not
[1:02:16] grudgingly amen
[1:02:18] this is where peter would talk about
[1:02:21] even having hospitality to one another
[1:02:24] without grudging
[1:02:26] in other words you know up here and
[1:02:27] they're like oh welcome down here like
[1:02:29] oh no
[1:02:33] okay
[1:02:34] this is where all of those things as it
[1:02:36] puts in by love serve one another so how
[1:02:40] that love itself is is to
[1:02:43] be the prevailing one and how that
[1:02:45] christ himself
[1:02:47] is to be
[1:02:48] our life to where our life is wrapped
[1:02:51] around him this is our desire is to
[1:02:54] please him
[1:02:55] is that right this he's our life that's
[1:02:58] what paul said he is our life so to
[1:03:00] think his love as it says husbands love
[1:03:03] your wives even as christ also loved the
[1:03:06] church and gave himself for it out of
[1:03:09] his love for you and i
[1:03:11] he he renders out of his love it renders
[1:03:16] a respect
[1:03:19] it renders an honor
[1:03:23] this is something
[1:03:25] this this choosing of god it renders a
[1:03:28] respect it renders an honor to us now
[1:03:31] let me parallel that even to that in the
[1:03:33] natural you see it's something to wear
[1:03:36] he has sought out our rest
[1:03:39] he has sought for the place that we
[1:03:42] might have rest where we might come to a
[1:03:44] place of contentment of satisfaction
[1:03:47] that we might dwell and he
[1:03:50] the lord himself
[1:03:52] he does not like anything that upsets
[1:03:55] our rest
[1:04:00] whether it's a thought whether it's an
[1:04:02] accusation
[1:04:04] whether it's a trouble
[1:04:05] he doesn't like anything he stands there
[1:04:07] like nehemiah when they would come
[1:04:09] around the gates and they wanted to sell
[1:04:11] things on the sabbath day the time of
[1:04:14] rest
[1:04:14] and nehemiah told them you're not only
[1:04:16] not coming in here but you better quit
[1:04:18] showing up outside of these gates and
[1:04:20] these walls or i'm going to take care of
[1:04:21] you
[1:04:22] is that right because you're not going
[1:04:24] to trouble my people on their rest
[1:04:28] god himself because you sing why because
[1:04:31] where there is rest it speaks of
[1:04:33] contentment it speaks of satisfaction
[1:04:35] when there is rest there is joy there is
[1:04:38] delight there is service there is there
[1:04:41] is just a moving within our hearts it
[1:04:44] comes from a rest
[1:04:46] god uses us when we're at rest
[1:04:52] i mean you know as a minister
[1:04:55] that the things that even as i'd stand
[1:04:57] here i could we could god could get no
[1:04:59] god doesn't force his way down
[1:05:02] god could get nowhere unless there's a
[1:05:04] resting in him
[1:05:06] where he comes down and takes control
[1:05:09] within a service where he comes down
[1:05:12] there's got to be a rest which rest is
[1:05:15] based on that of trust and that of love
[1:05:18] he works to bring rest in our lives
[1:05:22] he doesn't disturb our rest he works to
[1:05:25] ensure
[1:05:26] rest
[1:05:28] because where there's rest there's
[1:05:29] growth
[1:05:32] is that right
[1:05:33] so he ministers he provides all that we
[1:05:35] have need of you see even in our life as
[1:05:38] we journey here god knows everything
[1:05:40] that we have need of in this life and in
[1:05:43] this journey and he's got every bit of
[1:05:45] it covered just like when we left egypt
[1:05:48] he's got everything covered they didn't
[1:05:49] have to find a clothing store they
[1:05:52] didn't have to find a shoe store they
[1:05:54] didn't even have to find a grocery store
[1:05:56] god said i
[1:05:58] am all that you have need of
[1:06:02] i've got everything covered so that you
[1:06:04] don't have to focus on all those other
[1:06:06] things all you have to do is follow the
[1:06:09] pillar of fire and i'll provide every
[1:06:13] thing that you got in need of
[1:06:15] when you need healing
[1:06:16] i am your healing
[1:06:20] he's there to protect our lives he's
[1:06:23] there to conceal our lives
[1:06:26] god does not disclose our faults
[1:06:32] as a matter of fact in in his presence
[1:06:35] and to think how that he works he works
[1:06:38] within our lives to to to not only to
[1:06:42] provide and protect but he works to
[1:06:44] conceal our faults he sets there as an
[1:06:48] advocate for you and i
[1:06:51] he sets there as our perpetuation to
[1:06:55] bring cleansing to our life
[1:06:58] his interest is not our faults or our
[1:07:02] failures he wants to conceal them
[1:07:06] now think about that in terms of of a
[1:07:08] natural husband the desire because
[1:07:11] remember we are his workmanship
[1:07:16] he conceals that he covers our
[1:07:19] weaknesses he knows our weaknesses
[1:07:22] if god right now came down in this
[1:07:24] assembly and said it started going down
[1:07:26] name by name i'd probably be preaching
[1:07:28] to empty pews and pretty soon i'd be out
[1:07:30] the door because god would lay out all
[1:07:32] of our infirmity he knows our weaknesses
[1:07:35] and we all have infirmities
[1:07:38] but he covers them
[1:07:41] he doesn't make excuses for him but he
[1:07:43] covers them he ministers to you and i he
[1:07:46] gives strength to you and i to where you
[1:07:48] and i can even come to him and we can
[1:07:51] can go to him as our high priest and say
[1:07:53] lord i need help i need strength lord
[1:07:56] i'm getting a little lacks in this he's
[1:07:59] not there to condemn us he's there to
[1:08:02] cover our infirmities
[1:08:05] and that powerful because there's many
[1:08:08] things in our life that there's things
[1:08:10] that you no longer have to deal with
[1:08:13] it's areas that are not weak there's
[1:08:15] areas of strength but then there's areas
[1:08:17] that you find yourself contending with
[1:08:20] over and over and over again and the
[1:08:23] devil wants to beat you up and say well
[1:08:26] you'll never get beyond this or you'll
[1:08:28] never get beyond this he wants to hammer
[1:08:30] you maybe about your prayer life or or
[1:08:32] this or that but god when we can go to
[1:08:35] god in prayer god is not there to hammer
[1:08:38] us over that but god said that's an area
[1:08:41] that you'll trust in me you'll rest in
[1:08:43] me i'll minister to you just exactly
[1:08:47] what you have need of god doesn't want
[1:08:49] us to be independent from him he wants
[1:08:53] us to be dependent on him
[1:08:58] my goodness
[1:09:00] always entertaining
[1:09:02] he entertains the best opinion
[1:09:04] now that don't mean that he don't call
[1:09:06] things out there's times he'll call
[1:09:08] things out but he'll move right down in
[1:09:10] the into a service and god knows how to
[1:09:12] speak to our lives in such a way that it
[1:09:15] causes us to reach
[1:09:17] higher
[1:09:18] and as he's bringing those things out he
[1:09:20] at the same time we know he's
[1:09:23] discouraging us in the wrong things
[1:09:26] hallelujah
[1:09:28] oh my how many say lord help me in that
[1:09:32] amen you know he he endeavors within
[1:09:35] that now you see within this as we were
[1:09:38] looking at
[1:09:39] in the scripture of ephesians 5 and i'm
[1:09:41] going to have to move here
[1:09:44] but there all through the scripture we
[1:09:46] find as we were looking at this where it
[1:09:48] would speak
[1:09:49] wives submit yourselves to the husband
[1:09:52] wives being in subjection to your
[1:09:54] husband
[1:09:55] and you'll find that all through this
[1:09:57] scripture here that
[1:09:59] how be it that that is a single duty of
[1:10:02] the wife but the single duty of the
[1:10:05] husband is to love him
[1:10:08] so what brings about the subjection love
[1:10:13] without the expression of love it
[1:10:16] doesn't come into full subjection
[1:10:20] because subjection is the result not
[1:10:23] only of love expressed but love received
[1:10:27] and now that same love is being
[1:10:29] reciprocated
[1:10:31] back to the one who expressed it
[1:10:34] so
[1:10:35] things sometimes as i think as house it
[1:10:38] would say
[1:10:39] that even when we look at that part of
[1:10:41] subjection that if that in itself would
[1:10:45] seem hard would seem difficult
[1:10:48] what makes a difference
[1:10:50] what made the difference for you from me
[1:10:54] let me think about our lives i mean
[1:10:56] let's just just face it here we are
[1:10:58] growing up in a message church i know
[1:11:00] not to do this don't do this don't do
[1:11:02] that we don't do this we do this we
[1:11:04] don't do that we do this we don't
[1:11:07] but that still didn't take care of the
[1:11:09] first master
[1:11:11] see i was born under that first master
[1:11:14] and so there's other things that i was
[1:11:16] doing doing out of fear well this is
[1:11:18] what i'm supposed to do and this is what
[1:11:20] but i really wasn't doing it in the
[1:11:22] right way so it really wasn't
[1:11:25] submission
[1:11:27] but what changes it is when god by his
[1:11:31] love began to knock on my heart
[1:11:35] that became personal
[1:11:38] not just somebody in here with a
[1:11:40] somebody with a green dress has got a
[1:11:42] headache nope he comes right down to
[1:11:44] your life and begins to knock on your
[1:11:47] door
[1:11:49] and says hey i've been noticing you
[1:11:52] i'm a little interested in you
[1:11:56] i like to get acquainted with you
[1:11:59] he singles you out and starts getting
[1:12:01] personal with you that's what the love
[1:12:03] of god does it starts getting personal
[1:12:06] with our life it starts changing the way
[1:12:08] you look at things you're no longer
[1:12:10] looking at like gotta do this and i
[1:12:12] gotta do that he begins to change in
[1:12:14] your life what's happening the love
[1:12:16] that's being projected it's now coming
[1:12:20] into your life and the things of the
[1:12:22] world the holds of the world the
[1:12:24] indifference of the world the bitterness
[1:12:27] of the world is being dismantled
[1:12:29] by the love of god
[1:12:32] amen that's a dying out that takes place
[1:12:35] so it's a spirit of love
[1:12:37] that christ-like love on the part of the
[1:12:39] husband that makes the duty easy
[1:12:42] you know i think of how
[1:12:45] you know when we look at
[1:12:47] many of these things and many of these
[1:12:48] parts
[1:12:50] brother adam let me just refer to this
[1:12:52] quote i don't have that up there but i
[1:12:54] have it here i just want to read it
[1:12:57] it's out of the message
[1:12:59] our restore
[1:13:01] saith the lord
[1:13:03] but says if you want to get close to god
[1:13:05] how many want to get close to god
[1:13:08] just get close to love
[1:13:11] it's simple isn't it
[1:13:13] just love god with all your heart with
[1:13:16] all your soul with all your mind with
[1:13:17] all your strength just wrap yourself in
[1:13:20] a bundle of love
[1:13:22] watch that man that you didn't like
[1:13:25] like you
[1:13:27] do you ever get around anybody you've
[1:13:28] seen nice people he said you couldn't
[1:13:30] hardly stand to be around them wow nice
[1:13:32] people but you couldn't stand to be
[1:13:34] around them
[1:13:36] now that's right he says i've seen
[1:13:37] people maybe that you know you just love
[1:13:39] to be in their presence
[1:13:41] haven't you seen people like that
[1:13:43] do you realize that you're sons of god
[1:13:47] the atmosphere and the air that you live
[1:13:49] in you create a situation around you
[1:13:53] that either draws or pushes away
[1:13:58] that's a powerful statement but it's
[1:14:00] reality
[1:14:01] as sons and daughters of god you know a
[1:14:03] lot of times with men you know
[1:14:06] lord how brother branham spoke to that
[1:14:08] storm sometimes we got some storms that
[1:14:10] are a lot worse
[1:14:12] than anything any app on your phone
[1:14:16] alert
[1:14:17] air quality
[1:14:21] storm detected
[1:14:24] come on the holy ghost is a greater
[1:14:25] detector than any system out there it
[1:14:28] can detect there's a storm brewing
[1:14:33] pressure's building in the home there's
[1:14:35] a storm brewing
[1:14:37] there's a front coming in
[1:14:43] oh jesus
[1:14:44] but to think of the blessedness this is
[1:14:47] the simplicity of it that god gives us a
[1:14:50] grace that as a son and daughter of god
[1:14:52] to realize
[1:14:53] we
[1:14:54] have the authority
[1:14:56] to change that atmosphere to change that
[1:14:59] situation sometimes it takes changing
[1:15:02] our thoughts
[1:15:05] brother branham was thinking a certain
[1:15:06] way certain thoughts were crossing his
[1:15:08] mind regarding that man who was coming
[1:15:10] on the platform the maniac brother brown
[1:15:12] said it like this i chose to think
[1:15:15] different thoughts
[1:15:18] that was powerful god didn't give him
[1:15:20] different thoughts he chose to think
[1:15:22] different thoughts he recognized the
[1:15:24] battle there was a storm that was
[1:15:26] brewing and what was approaching and he
[1:15:29] began to have thoughts no doubt this man
[1:15:31] don't mean that this man's a good man no
[1:15:33] doubt this man right here he's you know
[1:15:35] he's a husband he's a father remember
[1:15:37] brother brown begins to enter in and
[1:15:39] that entering in goes beyond the
[1:15:41] situation that he's confronted with yes
[1:15:45] brother sister this is not just stories
[1:15:48] these are not i don't look at those
[1:15:49] things i look at that as application
[1:15:52] that shows me the quality of this life
[1:15:56] that god has brought to us in this hour
[1:15:59] if he did it through the messenger how
[1:16:01] much more will he do it through the
[1:16:03] bride
[1:16:06] is that right to people who can say god
[1:16:09] i can look to you lord that an
[1:16:11] atmosphere would be changed
[1:16:16] oh my the air that you live in to create
[1:16:20] a situation around you will either draw
[1:16:23] or push away
[1:16:25] so when we we look at this with love and
[1:16:29] i begin to just think upon that that
[1:16:30] moment and that of sacrifice and a lot
[1:16:33] of times with sacrifice when we look at
[1:16:35] that
[1:16:36] in the in the terms as we're saying
[1:16:38] moments ago
[1:16:40] sometimes we look at things of
[1:16:42] well it's things that maybe that would
[1:16:44] seem awful hard for us to do
[1:16:47] and there is things sacrificing is not
[1:16:49] something that's easy
[1:16:51] i mean if you give somebody the old
[1:16:52] raggedy shirt that you don't like
[1:16:53] wearing well you ain't made much of
[1:16:54] sacrifice
[1:16:56] is that right here i wanted you to have
[1:16:58] well you don't even wear the thing any
[1:17:00] much of a sacrifice
[1:17:03] so sacrifice it cost us something
[1:17:06] yes amen
[1:17:08] it cost us something
[1:17:10] it cost
[1:17:12] it cost in order for us to be united
[1:17:15] with god it cost him
[1:17:20] i want you to think of this because
[1:17:22] sometimes you know we think about this
[1:17:25] with love and think about serving let me
[1:17:27] draw you just to just a few moments here
[1:17:29] into this of genesis 29 20. here's
[1:17:32] talking about jacob i remember remember
[1:17:35] the story where jacob goes down and you
[1:17:37] know he falls in love with rachel and
[1:17:40] laban who does the same kind of stuff
[1:17:42] jacob does they're both shysters and
[1:17:44] laban says
[1:17:46] you can have her work seven years
[1:17:49] he works seven years
[1:17:52] realizes after the wedding night next
[1:17:55] morning it's leah
[1:17:58] oh
[1:17:59] seven years
[1:18:02] you know i just think poor leah you know
[1:18:10] but jacob
[1:18:13] wasn't going to leave without rachel
[1:18:18] and so
[1:18:20] he told him
[1:18:22] and when you see the bargain you know
[1:18:23] that laban made laban said seven more
[1:18:25] years
[1:18:34] notice what the bible says in verse 20
[1:18:37] jacob served seven years for rachel
[1:18:41] and they seemed unto him
[1:18:45] but a few days
[1:18:46] for the love
[1:18:48] he had to her
[1:18:50] what made the serving different
[1:18:52] love
[1:18:55] it was love that made it different what
[1:18:58] makes it different for you serving god
[1:19:01] the love of god makes all the difference
[1:19:03] in the world
[1:19:05] it's not something that i have to do
[1:19:07] it's the privilege
[1:19:09] it's the privilege to do it the
[1:19:11] privilege to minister to his name when
[1:19:13] he says something in his word it's a
[1:19:16] privilege to line ourselves with the
[1:19:18] word by yielding ourselves to him it's
[1:19:21] love that makes the difference
[1:19:26] is that right
[1:19:27] so love itself was entirely what was
[1:19:30] different so
[1:19:32] you know
[1:19:33] sometimes you know you think about it
[1:19:35] i've said this to you know others and i
[1:19:38] can appreciate when they can say i'm not
[1:19:40] there yet i'm not ready to depart you
[1:19:41] know for marriage or this or that and i
[1:19:43] can i can respect that because they're
[1:19:45] looking at oh my all the requirements
[1:19:47] and all the responsibility it is a
[1:19:49] responsibility but what makes a
[1:19:51] difference is when you fall in love
[1:19:54] when you fall in love you don't look at
[1:19:56] everything of oh i have to do this or i
[1:19:58] have to do that or i have to do this no
[1:20:01] love
[1:20:02] is what drives you to it
[1:20:07] there's an objective in verse 26 look
[1:20:09] what his love does let me pick up verse
[1:20:11] 25 and then come down to 26. husbands
[1:20:14] love your wives even as christ also
[1:20:16] loved the church and gave himself for it
[1:20:20] that he might sanctify
[1:20:23] and cleanse it with the washing of water
[1:20:26] by the word
[1:20:28] notice that he might present it to
[1:20:31] himself a glorious church
[1:20:34] not having spot wrinkle or any such
[1:20:37] thing but that it should be holy
[1:20:40] and without blemish
[1:20:43] so she
[1:20:45] the bride
[1:20:46] is a reflection of him
[1:20:50] all that he has sown and placed within
[1:20:54] us
[1:20:54] as the bride of jesus christ that what
[1:20:56] we have received it's reflected back to
[1:20:59] him
[1:21:00] every his love and his care
[1:21:04] that which is given to you and i
[1:21:06] ministered to you and i it now reflects
[1:21:09] itself back to him
[1:21:12] so that we love him because he first
[1:21:15] loved us
[1:21:17] how that god ministers to our life and
[1:21:20] providing for all that we have need of
[1:21:22] this is why
[1:21:24] that god intended and i'm going to be
[1:21:26] very specific here god intended that a
[1:21:28] man would be the head the initiator and
[1:21:32] the leader of all things desirable
[1:21:35] proper and respectful that the very
[1:21:38] beauty of the wife would reflect the
[1:21:41] adornment of such love and carefulness
[1:21:46] god intended that
[1:21:49] that's god's order
[1:21:51] the world today
[1:21:53] its systems
[1:21:55] even some of the leading movements that
[1:21:57] were on the scene last year still around
[1:21:59] and about
[1:22:00] when i copied all i went into their site
[1:22:02] and copied their pretense and their
[1:22:04] objective is to break the family
[1:22:08] are you hearing me these very things
[1:22:11] that are out there these systems
[1:22:14] it's not the people
[1:22:16] it's demons
[1:22:19] they're anointed by darkness
[1:22:24] nobody in the right mind would have an
[1:22:27] objective statement to break the family
[1:22:31] unit
[1:22:35] we can trace right down in here in
[1:22:37] history every time man has come that way
[1:22:40] when it's coming to into communities in
[1:22:42] the 1960s it actually came in it from
[1:22:45] that uprising it brought divorce rates
[1:22:48] to all-time highs
[1:22:51] are you hearing me i'm not making things
[1:22:53] up i'm telling you when man starts
[1:22:55] tampering with things
[1:23:01] but god has a way
[1:23:03] god's intended that not only that man
[1:23:05] would be an initiator a leader but then
[1:23:08] that the children themselves a young
[1:23:10] girl she can look at that and know this
[1:23:13] is the kind of man that i need to marry
[1:23:17] the young man can look at that husband
[1:23:20] and say that's the kind of leader i want
[1:23:22] to be how he's leading this home the
[1:23:24] effect and the influence that comes
[1:23:27] forth in this home
[1:23:30] i tell you this is these are these are
[1:23:32] things that are big responsibilities
[1:23:35] the more and more than i stand i
[1:23:38] recognize more and more the
[1:23:39] responsibility
[1:23:42] nothing comes with autopilot
[1:23:47] nothing comes with autopilot god comes
[1:23:49] to guide and direct our lives
[1:23:53] look at let's look at this just for a
[1:23:55] few moments here here within this part
[1:23:59] within the scriptures here of how god
[1:24:01] would lay down his life in john 10 16
[1:24:04] as the father knoweth me
[1:24:06] even so i know the father and i laid
[1:24:09] down
[1:24:10] my life for the sheep
[1:24:14] he's laid down
[1:24:15] his life what what drove him to this his
[1:24:18] love
[1:24:21] romans 5 8
[1:24:24] but god commended
[1:24:25] his love toward us in that
[1:24:30] while we were yet
[1:24:33] sinners
[1:24:35] christ died for us
[1:24:38] we weren't worthy of it we weren't oh
[1:24:41] they're doing everything that's what no
[1:24:43] this love is not a love based on
[1:24:46] worthiness
[1:24:50] this is the love of god
[1:24:55] first john 3 16 hereby perceive we
[1:24:59] notice these words perceive
[1:25:02] we the love of god because he laid down
[1:25:05] his life for us
[1:25:08] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:25:10] the brethren see it's an example
[1:25:13] when that light this is why paul would
[1:25:15] write in thessalonians
[1:25:17] beloved you need not any man teach you
[1:25:21] to love you are taught of god to love
[1:25:24] but what god has done in your life
[1:25:27] now it comes out in its express first
[1:25:30] john 4 9
[1:25:32] in this was
[1:25:33] manifested
[1:25:35] the love of god
[1:25:37] toward us because that god sent his only
[1:25:39] begotten son into the world that we
[1:25:41] might live through him
[1:25:43] here in his love not that we loved god
[1:25:46] but that he loved us and sent his son to
[1:25:49] be the propitiation for our
[1:25:52] sins
[1:25:54] look at this in first john 4 17 through
[1:25:57] 19
[1:25:59] hearing is our love made
[1:26:01] perfect
[1:26:03] that we may have boldness that's
[1:26:04] confidence
[1:26:06] in the day of judgment because as he is
[1:26:08] so are we in this world and there is no
[1:26:12] fear in love you see it's it's not a
[1:26:14] fear has torment this is what it goes on
[1:26:17] to say
[1:26:18] but perfect love casts out fear
[1:26:22] fear is a horrible thing
[1:26:25] fear can try to come around and grip you
[1:26:29] i mean if outside in the world today
[1:26:32] fear is so thick
[1:26:34] but that's part of prophecy
[1:26:36] the bible said men's hearts would be
[1:26:39] failing for fear
[1:26:41] is that right
[1:26:43] and there's all sorts of what would a
[1:26:45] sphere come from uncertainty it comes
[1:26:47] from everything that's around but notice
[1:26:50] as he says there is no fear in love
[1:26:53] love is rooted
[1:26:55] in that
[1:26:56] fear fear or love is rooted there in god
[1:27:00] and now what does it bring about a
[1:27:02] confidence
[1:27:05] it's a confidence
[1:27:07] in him
[1:27:08] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[1:27:11] love this is dealing with the slavish
[1:27:13] fear this is not talking about a fear
[1:27:15] that if you get a doctor's report and
[1:27:17] all of a sudden fear comes up and oh my
[1:27:19] goodness what's that going to be so
[1:27:21] those are things that let me just say
[1:27:22] this to you that's a reminder you're
[1:27:24] still in this mortal body
[1:27:27] is that right
[1:27:28] it's a reminder even of things that goes
[1:27:31] around and you know here you are you
[1:27:33] know you're at work and oh my i was just
[1:27:36] around this person yesterday and what
[1:27:37] happened it's a reminder you're still in
[1:27:40] this mortal body but there is a god who
[1:27:43] is present with grace to cast out all
[1:27:47] fear
[1:27:51] we're not above but this is talking
[1:27:54] about a slavish where it's a fear of a
[1:27:57] dread of an uncertainty of a well i
[1:28:00] don't know but this the love of god
[1:28:03] brings a certainty in our life that
[1:28:05] though we don't understand everything
[1:28:07] else that's going on around us but we
[1:28:09] know in whom we have believed
[1:28:12] and that's what we're resting that's
[1:28:13] where our confidence within we don't
[1:28:15] have to know everything i don't have to
[1:28:17] figure this out
[1:28:18] faith is not god's told me everything
[1:28:20] that's going to happen and man i can
[1:28:22] rest in that faith is not sight
[1:28:27] faith is god said it and i believe it
[1:28:33] we love him
[1:28:35] because
[1:28:36] he first
[1:28:38] loved us
[1:28:40] think about what he did as he came down
[1:28:44] and he gave of his life as we were
[1:28:46] looking
[1:28:48] and he began
[1:28:50] to move upon our life and our life was
[1:28:53] washed
[1:28:54] with the water of the word
[1:28:58] what does his word do
[1:29:02] i'll tell you his word brings about a
[1:29:04] change in our life
[1:29:07] how many know what i'm talking about
[1:29:10] it continues
[1:29:12] it continues
[1:29:14] to eat away or to remove
[1:29:16] even
[1:29:17] thoughts that we have about our own self
[1:29:21] are you hearing me
[1:29:22] i feel insufficient here i feel his love
[1:29:26] it works to do what bring a cleansing
[1:29:29] remove those things within our life
[1:29:32] i believe we have access
[1:29:35] and as husbands
[1:29:37] as wives to an access to where the love
[1:29:40] of god because we all have faults we all
[1:29:42] have failures
[1:29:44] but there is an access we have within
[1:29:46] our lives that can actually bring about
[1:29:50] a strength
[1:29:51] in one another
[1:29:54] a confidence
[1:29:55] in one another a rest in one another i
[1:29:59] believe that with all my heart
[1:30:02] i know that to be the truth
[1:30:05] look at this in first in second
[1:30:07] corinthians chapter 5 verse 14
[1:30:10] for the love of christ
[1:30:13] constrainteth us
[1:30:15] because we thus judge that if one died
[1:30:17] for all then we're all dead and that he
[1:30:20] died for all that they which lived
[1:30:23] should not live unto themselves but unto
[1:30:26] him
[1:30:27] which died for them
[1:30:29] and rose again
[1:30:32] so we're not living to ourselves
[1:30:35] we lift for him
[1:30:38] it's our delight
[1:30:40] to live for him
[1:30:43] it's our delight to see
[1:30:46] that his program
[1:30:48] is advanced
[1:30:51] it's our delight to see him move and
[1:30:54] touch lives and touch heart and maybe
[1:30:57] it's something that we here we are we're
[1:30:59] just reaching out to someone being
[1:31:01] friendly being nice and here it is it's
[1:31:05] that life and has an effect upon them
[1:31:08] and here it's god moving to reach their
[1:31:12] soul
[1:31:14] we rejoice in that and say lord
[1:31:16] i'm thankful
[1:31:18] that i could be used
[1:31:20] for the advancement of your kingdom
[1:31:23] because it's him it's him that we want
[1:31:25] to see
[1:31:26] now brother branham he brings us down
[1:31:28] and i'm coming down here
[1:31:30] in the message token brother brown in
[1:31:32] the message token he preaches in
[1:31:34] jeffersonville there's many statements
[1:31:35] that brother branham will make regarding
[1:31:37] the home regarding the application of
[1:31:39] the token regarding this of how this
[1:31:42] life it comes down
[1:31:44] into the home
[1:31:47] and he says it like this he says
[1:31:50] uh
[1:31:51] you that's listening to this on tape you
[1:31:54] women men listen a minute if you ever
[1:31:56] believe me you believe me now it's time
[1:31:58] to quit fussing with one another
[1:32:01] and believe the message of the bible
[1:32:03] believe jesus christ
[1:32:05] and love and honor and respect
[1:32:09] one another
[1:32:11] man respect your wives
[1:32:13] you respect your homes
[1:32:16] bring your home together because
[1:32:17] remember this lamb
[1:32:20] was for the home
[1:32:22] not just one but for the whole home too
[1:32:25] had to be brought everything had to be
[1:32:27] brought in we should love
[1:32:30] one another love each other and
[1:32:32] believers should separate themselves
[1:32:34] from the world
[1:32:36] that's an effect of this
[1:32:39] of this lamb
[1:32:41] of this message
[1:32:43] you see it it has within it as we give
[1:32:45] ourselves
[1:32:47] to the word of god it it it changes it
[1:32:50] brings about the effectual working of
[1:32:53] the life of jesus christ let me just say
[1:32:55] this to you
[1:32:57] if this message
[1:32:58] only produces correct doctrine it's
[1:33:01] missing the mark
[1:33:04] and i hope you understand what i'm
[1:33:05] saying
[1:33:06] the bible never said that he would send
[1:33:08] elijah to turn our heads
[1:33:11] knowledge puffeth up but charity edified
[1:33:14] he came to deal with our hearts
[1:33:18] our hearts were in the wrong direction
[1:33:20] in the wrong thing notice what god came
[1:33:23] to get a hold of our hearts
[1:33:26] because when he gets a hold of our
[1:33:28] hearts then we'll see things differently
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:33] is that right
[1:33:35] he came to deal with the hearts it's
[1:33:37] it's the love of god
[1:33:39] that's what this message is it come to
[1:33:42] display the very heart of almighty god
[1:33:46] where man's doctrine where man
[1:33:48] denominations would not allow the love
[1:33:51] of god to have free course they
[1:33:53] shut it off from the people but god
[1:33:56] called you and i out and to express
[1:34:00] his heart to you and i and change us
[1:34:07] this is why we're not church members
[1:34:11] we are believers
[1:34:15] we're in love with the lord jesus christ
[1:34:19] hallelujah
[1:34:21] this is where
[1:34:23] this responsibility here
[1:34:26] moves down here let me just have just a
[1:34:28] few more moments i want to just get to
[1:34:30] this point in verse 28 so what men to
[1:34:33] love their wives as their own bodies
[1:34:36] he that loveth his wife
[1:34:38] loveth
[1:34:39] himself
[1:34:42] think of this how god in the beginning
[1:34:45] as we looked at it
[1:34:47] god in the beginning where he created
[1:34:50] maryland fema remember spirit
[1:34:53] and then he places
[1:34:55] adam here
[1:34:57] into the flesh body that he created
[1:35:00] and god lays him to sleep he opens up
[1:35:03] the side
[1:35:04] he takes out that part
[1:35:06] of a rib
[1:35:08] a part that was right over his heart
[1:35:11] and god begins to multiply sell on top
[1:35:14] of sale on top of sound he didn't reach
[1:35:16] over and get another piece of dirt he
[1:35:18] began to multiply
[1:35:20] from what was already present
[1:35:23] and then god goes in
[1:35:25] and in that surgery he separates
[1:35:29] masculine and feminine spirit
[1:35:32] and he places that feminine part which
[1:35:34] is the dainty part the left part he
[1:35:37] separates that from the burly manly part
[1:35:40] of the masculine and then god when he
[1:35:43] awakens
[1:35:44] adam
[1:35:46] adam looks and beholds and he says she's
[1:35:49] born of my bone flesh and my flesh she
[1:35:52] shall be called woman
[1:35:54] for she was taken out of man
[1:35:58] and god begins to go in and the
[1:36:00] rehearsal is of how that a man
[1:36:03] would leave father and mother
[1:36:06] and cleave to his own wife you see god
[1:36:08] even god was letting you know even that
[1:36:10] time there's going to come a fall
[1:36:14] even in those verses of scripture but to
[1:36:16] think of how that god how that he says
[1:36:19] they shall be one flesh how are they one
[1:36:22] flesh when you can see the female here
[1:36:25] and the male here it's because of the
[1:36:28] uniting of the spirits
[1:36:33] that unites together as one flesh
[1:36:37] with one purpose
[1:36:39] one objective
[1:36:40] one
[1:36:41] one motive everything is surrounded in a
[1:36:45] true oneness
[1:36:46] that's the same way it is
[1:36:48] with a real believer
[1:36:50] that's the real prayer that the lord
[1:36:52] jesus prayed for in john 17
[1:36:54] that they might be one
[1:36:57] even as thou art in me
[1:37:00] that that same original life would dwell
[1:37:03] within us
[1:37:04] and here we would be united with him
[1:37:08] that our desire
[1:37:10] is to please him
[1:37:12] his desire his love his care his
[1:37:14] standard over our life
[1:37:16] his love
[1:37:18] his care i want to just leave you with
[1:37:21] these points
[1:37:24] the real point
[1:37:26] so what men to love their wives as their
[1:37:28] own bodies
[1:37:29] is that a husband should have the same
[1:37:31] care
[1:37:33] for the comfort of his wife
[1:37:36] as he has for himself
[1:37:39] the same care
[1:37:41] just like as a husband wants to be
[1:37:42] comfortable
[1:37:44] and i'm talking something in the natural
[1:37:46] but it should have the same care
[1:37:49] for his wife
[1:37:51] why
[1:37:52] because they're one
[1:37:55] so ought men
[1:37:57] to love their own wives
[1:37:59] as their own bodies
[1:38:01] he should regard her
[1:38:03] as one
[1:38:04] with himself to think of it in that way
[1:38:07] to think of it that way
[1:38:09] as he protects his own body
[1:38:12] i mean
[1:38:13] you know sometimes i get i get cold i
[1:38:15] come out of my office at home and i walk
[1:38:16] through another part of the house and
[1:38:17] because my office is a little warmer
[1:38:20] whoo i come out i put on a jacket
[1:38:22] i say i'm going to go outside and walk
[1:38:24] around for a little bit and get a little
[1:38:25] you know and it isn't that the house is
[1:38:27] freezing cold we don't keep it on you
[1:38:29] know
[1:38:30] freezer status or nothing like that but
[1:38:32] you understand what i'm saying it's time
[1:38:33] what do i do i don't i just go get a
[1:38:36] jacket i know what i have need of
[1:38:41] so how much more
[1:38:43] it's just like in the care
[1:38:45] how i would take of my own body when i'm
[1:38:48] cold
[1:38:49] or i get thirsty
[1:38:50] i go make myself a glass of
[1:38:52] you know lemon water or whatever you
[1:38:54] call a coffee go make another cup of
[1:38:56] coffee because i'm thirsty or i'm
[1:38:58] craving something i'm wanting something
[1:39:00] what's happening my body's telling me
[1:39:02] that
[1:39:03] right i mean there's nothing that comes
[1:39:04] out of my body hey samuel i'm cold
[1:39:08] if i start talking to myself like that
[1:39:09] i'll be committed
[1:39:12] right but there's things that i'm
[1:39:14] alerted to this is a need go get a
[1:39:17] jacket go get something to drink go get
[1:39:19] something to eat that's the kind of
[1:39:21] oneness
[1:39:22] between a husband and a wife
[1:39:25] to be that sensitive
[1:39:27] to catch those needs
[1:39:30] but something's not right well
[1:39:34] if there's something brewing don't wait
[1:39:36] for the lightning to strike
[1:39:41] are you with me
[1:39:43] if you know something if you see and
[1:39:44] it's not just about when lightning
[1:39:46] strikes but it's the care
[1:39:48] it's the taking care let's stand
[1:39:50] understand we'll just stop here
[1:39:59] when we're sick or we're suffering
[1:40:02] what do we try to do when we're sick or
[1:40:04] we're suffering i mean when you when
[1:40:05] you're sick
[1:40:07] hey man i'm
[1:40:09] i'm not feeling well
[1:40:10] i need to go take a nap
[1:40:12] i need to go to bed early
[1:40:14] i need to take something that
[1:40:16] helped me just to relax i uh you know so
[1:40:19] i'm not coughing all the time
[1:40:21] what we're trying to do we're trying to
[1:40:22] restore health
[1:40:24] that's the same way it is so ought men
[1:40:26] to love their wives as their own bodies
[1:40:29] there are sometimes where there's things
[1:40:30] that need to be restored
[1:40:33] sometimes things get a little weak or a
[1:40:34] little down hey all throughout this
[1:40:36] assembly
[1:40:38] think of it how many times have we been
[1:40:40] down or we've been weak
[1:40:41] how many times we've been discouraged
[1:40:45] but god knowing
[1:40:47] our time of need
[1:40:49] god will come and minister right to our
[1:40:51] need
[1:40:52] he might come in your prayer closet he
[1:40:54] might come in your time of devotion he
[1:40:56] might come right here right over the
[1:40:58] pulpit but god comes and he sees he
[1:41:00] takes account
[1:41:02] of our needs
[1:41:05] the bible says the eyes are roaming to
[1:41:08] and fro throughout the earth
[1:41:11] now you know god is not like
[1:41:14] us as husbands where we
[1:41:16] you know by the time you
[1:41:18] you know you get to brother gomez and
[1:41:21] brother chris
[1:41:22] carlos all these
[1:41:24] i don't call them older brothers but you
[1:41:26] know
[1:41:27] these these brothers have doctor's
[1:41:28] degrees
[1:41:30] they already know like brother dave he
[1:41:31] could know sister shirley what she's
[1:41:33] thinking
[1:41:34] he can know certain things and to get
[1:41:36] this right now because she's probably
[1:41:38] going to get cold or he already knows
[1:41:40] that
[1:41:41] but you see what's happened is there's
[1:41:43] things that's been learned
[1:41:45] over time
[1:41:50] it's how it is about our lives we never
[1:41:52] stop learning
[1:41:55] on how that we can please god
[1:42:00] we never come to that place say god help
[1:42:02] me
[1:42:03] help me
[1:42:05] as we learn to care and god ministers to
[1:42:08] restore our
[1:42:09] our strength
[1:42:11] ministers to us when we've
[1:42:14] we got a little cold
[1:42:16] he draws near
[1:42:18] to do what warm us a little bit
[1:42:22] but we got cold in our prayer life cold
[1:42:24] our walk with god
[1:42:26] but he'll draw near he knows they need a
[1:42:28] little warming
[1:42:30] so he'll come by his presence
[1:42:33] and he'll warm us
[1:42:35] not that we deserve it
[1:42:37] but he sees our need
[1:42:40] and god's got confidence is he
