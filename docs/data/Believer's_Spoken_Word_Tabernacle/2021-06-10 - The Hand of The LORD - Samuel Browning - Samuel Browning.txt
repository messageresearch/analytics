word lord you know our needs lord we just commit ourselves lord in this congregation into your hands father we ask it all in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen god bless you tonight we just invite you to the word of the lord what if you'll go with me to second second kings chapter 3 verse 14. it's a little different than what we speaking on here on thursday night and even what i had planned to speak of but he had other plans we're always open to that amen so let's look at this in second kings chapter 3 verse 14. and elisha said as the lord of hosts liveth for whom i stand surely were it not that i regard the presence of jehoshaphat the king of judah i would not look toward thee nor see them but now bring me a minstrel came to pass when the minstrel played that the hand of the lord came upon him he said thus saith the lord make this valley full of ditches for thus saith the lord you shall not see wind neither shall you see rain yet the valley shall be filled with water that ye may drink both ye your cattle and your beasts this is but a light thing in the sight of the lord he will deliver the moabites also into your hand you shall smite every fence city every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop all wells of water and mar every good piece of land with stones amen may god bless you bless the reading of the word as you're being seated i'd like to just speak here just a few moments this evening on the hand of the lord and when we look at it here in the scripture in this particular setting in this background we look at something that as it as it was there was a wrongful alliance that had taken place jehoshaphat and you think of what was what was going on in the time of israel there had already come a division within the land of israel and here it was that there was an alliance that was made and jehoshaphat you you would look at this and many times it's so it can be some sometimes so easy for us to look at it and say jehoshaphat you did this before this happened before with ahab but you see it goes to show that it's not god is not asking you or i neither can we rely upon our own ability we can't even rely on looking back upon our own memories and upon different things but yet here it shows the very need for the discernment of the spirit of god you see what what jehoshaphat was looking at was the same thing that he had looked at before it looked as though that this would be the right thing to do it seemed like that this was right on it just it just felt right and you remember how that even that jehoshaphat himself he says the same thing regarding this particular thing as he did when it came down to that of ahab and he said i am as thou art my horses are your horses my people are your people and yet with what jehoshaphat was saying he was failing to examine it by the word of god because there was already god cannot bless what he's cursed you see god god has a standard and god won't compromise it and so here you find that you know jehoshaphat is sitting in a place very similar to what it was when he was standing there with ahab that time and remember with ahab it was it was actually the mercy of god that moved upon jehoshaphat in that moment when all of the hundreds of prophets of of baal were prophesying and telling ahab go on up the lord is with thee and yet it did not matter the multitude and how many that were saying it but here jehoshaphat there was a pulsation in his heart in that moment that asked is there not another one a prophet of the lord that we might inquire by him now to me that said a lot to all the hundreds that were saying go on up the lord is with you but there was something that was there within jehoshaphat and i want to just liken that to the pulsation of the holy spirit within a believer's life that there's something that moves you and i in a time that you may not realize or understand exactly what's going on but you stand there and brother brown called it the holy spirit he said it was like a little buzzer that's in your heart and he told us he said pay attention to that little buzzer he said because he spoke of a man that at one time he had a dog and that man had mined you know and got a lot of gold and all of a sudden that dog began to bark he said because there was actually robbers and thieves that were out there in the bushes but that man did not have the sense to be able to discern that but he had a dog and the dog was there to alert him and he kept telling him shut up tomorrow i'm going to be rich shut up tomorrow i'm going to be rich you see he wanted to drowned out the the voice that was letting him know there is danger lurking in the bushes and eventually the man just shot that dog and what ended up happening you know the rest of the story those of you who'd heard in the message here the robbers came right on in they took the spoil they killed the man and it all was all because he failed to pay attention to the simple little warnings of the dog you see god has placed that even within an individual you see many times like you look at with science science so you know we know within our own body that you have that of you know adrenaline and different things will kick in you'll even take take of things of how that you know there's a part within our our adrenals and different things like that to where it's it's it's it's a fear or fight or flight and those things will take place and yet there's a protection that is within that in the natural you know there's been around sometimes where there's things that you know it's just you need to get out of there is that right and yet within that in the natural how much greater in the spiritual that god would speak and would warn his children and would deal with hearts and lives and and to think of it that in the midst of this time that jehoshaphat like he did before he almost got killed in that battle but i believe with all of my heart it was because jehoshaphat was able to humble himself and in the midst of it all and say is there not one more the request for hearing one more is what spared jehoshaphat he went on into that battle but god recognized and honored the humility that he would humble himself to the voice of god even though he was in a wrongful alliance but god stepped on the scene and delivered jehoshaphat then we find in this particular setting in this situation that is here we find within this alliance here here here comes a place it was it was unadvised it was jehoshaphat never got spiritual counsel to unite himself there with jordan he never got that from god whatsoever you see this is the very part that even what's happened down through the ages that when the church itself or even an individual gets tangled up it's because they fail to heed to the word of almighty god you see sometimes our feelings can feel so real but our feelings are not to be what we go by sometimes our thoughts on things and everything else around us and oh i see this sign and i see this sign but there is nothing that is the absolute outside of the word of god that's why with every feeling that's why with every dream that's why with every vision it must come back to the word and if the word doesn't stand behind it then we cast down our feelings no matter how right they feel no matter how anything is we cast it down because the word is what is to have the ultimate preeminence in our lives so we find that within this of where here that jehoshaphat they come into this place that how they have journeyed and now they're asking you know they're asking for that there would be one jehoshaphat says is there not one is there not a prophet of the lord that we might inquire by his hand you see there was a need they had gone off without even asking god oh my god i tell you brother sister we'll always get in trouble when we go without asking god that's true we've got our five senses in our flesh we've got the five senses in our spirit but never are we to take any one of those above the word of god if it speaks with the word then we will say amen but when it is against the word we will deny that this is why here we stand in this hour the greatest battle ever fought and how that there are tests and things that can come our way and you see the enemy the whole thing the tests the trials every temptation that comes our way it is a test whether or not we are going to stand on the word of almighty god or if the enemy can pull us this way or he can pull us this way any way that he can pull us in any way wrongful alliances sometimes it's wrongful thoughts it's wrongful thinking it's wrongful action it is an alliance because before we can ever act out in a certain way we've actually had to receive a thought maybe it's a thought that the enemy is shot in and all of a sudden you've been taking it in taking it in then another thought comes and the complex begins to be built out in your life and here actions start coming out this way action's this way what is it it's a wrongful alliance the bible says cast down imagination bring every thought in subjection to the obedience of christ here they are out there journeying seven days and they come into a place and there's no water my goodness when god let israel out of egypt god had the water provided amen israel you see what god leads you to do god does not ask you then to provide and make a way but whatever god's will is it's god who makes a way is that right and you find that they're out there without any water you know what water's a type of don't you a water water is a type of the holy ghost you see any time but a church or an individual they get away from that word they get away from the word of god and i'm not just talking about the letter because the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life because the word itself you can't separate the word from god because god is the word you can't separate the word from the holy ghost because the holy ghost is the word of promise made real in that hour to the believer and in the believer and through the believer so it is the word itself that is wrapped up in the life of the believer god has promised water in this generation god has promised water for the believer god himself provides for us just exactly what we need of i tell you i don't believe tonight anybody in here wants some old dried up formal thing i don't believe nobody desires that we desire the real refreshing of the spirit of the living god in our lives we do not want our lives going out in their own way but yet god in his mercy if we should start to go in an area or a channel where we should not immediately we find the spirit of god pulling back and it's as though that lord where are you lord where are you now we know there's times of testing but yet bearing that for a life of a believer it is something about it that when you get away from the presence of god it doesn't matter if it's a day it doesn't matter if things have piled into your life maybe through the activities of the day or the cares or or things that's upon your life it's something about it to a believer it bothers you when you know you've not been in the presence of god because why it's in his presence there is fullness of joy amen it's in his presence there is life it's in his presence there's power there's authority there's joy glory be to god and i look at this here tonight and i think of how even in the midst of the time of how when this situation arises how that the king of israel at that time this listen let me tell you something they knew brother brown puts it like this they had all the writings of the prophets they knew all the songs they knew all the commandments but they needed something greater to address the real problem are you with me there was a problem that was there and you look at how that the king of israel will stand there in the midst of that time how how how alive here with withdrawal with with joram or jerome however you would say it as he stands there and he says well god's brought us all together here to kill us all what an unscriptural person an unscriptural man doesn't even know where he's standing at there should never be any that would venture without authority when you venture without authority you're presuming that god doesn't work by guesses and i hope so and maybe that ain't how god works god works according to his word his word is sure god is sure and god brings a sure experience god brings a sure reality and a heart so that you and i can stand there in the midst of opposition in the midst of every situation and say i know in whom i have believed and i'm persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against today but here you know you would think that it would have more of an understanding with that but you see when you look at this here they call within the midst of it they're calling for a prophet of god they want one who has contact with god now let's look at this for a moment elisha was one this is what he's known as one who poured water on the hands of elijah you see there was an honor there was a respect and how think of this reputation when the request is made for a prophet of god that we might inquire of the lord here stood elisha he was he was a channel that god would use within that time and that hour and here's what his reputation this is what he's known there's a lot of reputations that a person could have but what greater reputation could a person have like that of elisha to say i have poured hands or water on the hands of elijah he was known you see he was associated not just around elijah but he was one that poured water on the hands of elijah elisha was known not as one who was just around the message or around the church but elisha remember he received a double portion of the spirit before elijah went off the scene the burden of the elijah ministry was to prepare a way that the spirit of god might come back on the church of the living god and how that god operated and worked through elijah's life and elisha responded to that working and received of a double portion of the spirit of almighty god i tell you one thing you realize for sure is here when when when elisha stands there before him you know he comes up and he lets him know he says i wouldn't even be here but the only reason i'm going to stand here is because jehoshaphat's here you see he was recognizing this is a statement that's being made god himself did not come on the scene because the king of israel was there because the king of israel it wasn't going to change him even to see the miraculous it wouldn't turn him around this is why many can see the miraculous and god moving and god speak into hearts it won't move them that continue to be the same way still given the idolatry all of their own thoughts all of their own thinking worshiping their own ideas but it's something about a child of god you see when god comes down god's coming down because his attributes are here and god comes down to fellowship with his attributes it's you and i that have need of god and god looks down beyond beyond everything and says they've got a need of me i must come down and minister to their need it's wonderful of the time that we have fellowship with god and you realize you and i can never have fellowship with god outside of the blood that has made a way and the spirit of god that has come back upon our lives to quicken that seed on the inside and bring forth the son and daughter of god that brings us in to fellowship with almighty god then it's god's fellowshipping with his attributes sons and daughters of almighty god but there's times that sometimes the attributes they need god to come on the scene there's a situation that maybe they're in a situation that's perplexing their life but god does not come down because of our flesh god does not come down because of our spirit although we may need ministering to in our flesh healing in our flesh we might need healing even in our spirit but god comes down to minister to the attribute because when the attribute is able to actually catch a hold of the living god it will bring strength in our spirit it will bring strength in our body because other than that we would give it go right through us we never catch it but god comes down in respect of his word glory be to god if it wasn't for that that of the king of judah i wouldn't even look at you it's some pretty tough words isn't it one thing you take from that god don't waste time come on now god said you know what i hear i keep pouring in pouring in let me tell you something even when you look at brother d mister carrie when he was up to remember he kept saying oh i'm looking for a revival to shake chicago a revival to shake chicago and brother brian will come right and stand on the platform and turn around and look there uh i mean not ne demas but brother joseph matson jose forgive me he would turn right around and look at him and said now brother joseph what you've been praying for a revival to hit the city he said it has hit the city he said that god never promised to shake everything he never promised to shake the cannon fodder he promised to come and deal with his children now what a precious thing it is tonight if the word is dealt with your heart if the word is moved upon your life if the word has drawn you brother you have got true riches that's greater than anything of this world the rest can look at it it'll go on by but there's something about it it has meaning to your life glory be to god and here's to jehoshaphat look into elisha and elisha makes a request here i appreciate this honesty of elisha he said bring me now a minstrel bring me a minstrel he was all out of sorts he was an ordained channel of god are you with me he was a channel that god would speak through reveal himself through but he needed to get his spirit and the atmosphere right amen you see this is where as we we see this on the minstrel coming that minstrel when that minstrel played i don't believe they got somebody out of a bar room i believe with all my heart that there was a minstrel there that was in tune with god and it began to play there you know skillfully begin to play it it was not their ability that brought this atmosphere changed but they begin to play there upon that upon that stringed instrument you know devils hate stringed instruments devils hate stringed instruments now when you find this of how think of it even when the evil spirits was upon saul david played upon the heart and that evil spirit it was lifted from saul is that right this is why at times even in your life sometimes you can feel so tied up and tied up and there's things going on with you know the best thing you can do is put on some good gospel music is to actually begin to put on some music because you may not even feel like singing it might start out with just instrumental but you see there's a way that's why even when you look before there was ever a battle the music always went before the battle or before the ark that's why it's so important to being in the house of god getting our spirit right praying and just praying over the service and just entering right into the song service and and really entering in and say lord jesus i'm looking forward to you tonight the words that are actually being sung begin to worship him begin to thank him oh you may not have a need in your body tonight but there's a song that's being sung on healing you can worship him because you know him as a healer you know what he's done in your life and you'll find that through that experience in your life it'll invite the presence of god right down in the service right down in a meeting because a preacher does not pack it in his ipad or his briefcase the meeting is not packed that way there is a two part that is working right here if there's not a pull upon the gift of god if the spirit of god is not moving there freely within the hearts of the people that kneading will be as stiff and stale and starchy oh but when there is a flow of the spirit of almighty god brother and sister it's unlimited to what god can do within a meeting like that [Applause] bring me a minstrel oh my and the bible says when it came to pass when the minstrel began to play that the hand of the lord came upon him he began to get in harmony let me just say it to you and i in this age we were out of harmony our lives were out of harmony we were looking at a music sheet but we were out of harmony but god himself who wrote the music sheet who knows where every note has been divinely placed and which how many counts that it's to hold and and where it's to be and the melody god himself knows what he has laid out within the music sheet of his word you know it's something about it when god begins to fulfill his word and glory begins to come down you'll find that even as you read over in revelations 5 the bible says they sung a new song the bible would speak of when victory would strike there the 144 thousand they will not only sing the song of moses from back there when they cross the red sea but they will have the unfolding of calvary and the true atonement and they will sing the song of the lamb brethren it's something about it singing in songs it means something to a believer and it expresses victory [Applause] hallelujah here is standing in this in this moment they needed to get into the spirit of god there had to be an atmosphere that's changed and god in this hour let me just say it to you like this god came down once again in this hour amen so because there was a beat that was to be played there were steps that were to be made in the promises of god and it was a need that the church of the living god would return fully to the same inspiration of the holy ghost that was poured out on the day of pentecost so god himself comes down in the fullness of his power and what does he do it's not asking you and i to get into harmony it's god moving in our lives and it becomes now god moving in us bringing us in harmony with him but we must get in the spirit first let me just say let me just drop a few things here you see when the scripture says regarding there in revelations 1 where john said i was in the spirit on the lord's day you know when you when you consider this and thinking about this minstrel there's a need that's present and it was absolute necessity necessary that elisha be able to enter into the spirit of god before visions can happen before deliverance can come before healing comes it must come in to the spirit of god before the holy ghost can come it must enter in get into the spirit of almighty god you see this is why through the preaching of the word of god is to bring us into an atmosphere the preacher doesn't create that atmosphere it's not altogether the congregation that creates that atmosphere it's the word like it did in genesis 1 it's the word that sets the atmosphere for life because it is the word itself that has life in it and that word oh glory be to god that word begins to come forth and you might be sent in an atmosphere of doubt and discouragement and everything's around your life but how you sit there and you're listening to the word and all of a sudden from within you begin to say amen to the word what's happening darkness is being drove back it's being pushed back why because the word has life within it what you could not see before now the word pushes back the darkness it keeps on pushing it back [Applause] they entered into the spirit of god you see every word every promise of god in him is a and a man and every word of god is true every word of god is sure is that right and so we recognize in the scripture just as brother graham said the revelations that john received on the isle of patmos he must first be in the spirit and he said just as he was in the spirit to receive those revelations then we must be in the same spirit to receive them and become that revelation you see every word of god is inspired is that right that the prophets did not speak according to their own minds but they spake as they were moved upon by the holy ghost so it was not the man who was speaking but it was the man that was set aside and god as they would yield to him they would begin to speak according to the living oracles of almighty god they would speak things that was contrary to their own understanding they would say things that they didn't know how it was going to come to pass and neither do you need to be able to know how it's going to come to pass when the spirit of god pulsates in your heart speak that word take that claim take it upon your lips there through your heart and speak it out and let god bring it to pass so every word of god healing and no matter what it is the baptism of the holy ghost it has to be first get in the spirit of the author who wrote it when it says repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost enter into the spirit of god and then you are under an expectation for the spirit of god to come down into your life according to the word you see what entering the spirit does it brings expectations and they're real let me just give you this example here brother brown would say speak to it like this of getting in the spirit i i believe this can really really help you when we look at this brother ramble say he said the first step is pray and ask god for revelation if you find that there's things that you look at in your life and i don't understand about this or the first step is pray and ask god for revelation just speak personally to it just like you would come up here tonight and if i told you hey go put my bag in my car now most of you know what my car is now there might be a different car that i would have out there and if you were looking for the same other car and you walked out there and you would say oh my goodness uh well where is this car at well i mean it'd be foolish for you to keep walking all over the parking lot you have me right here you can come right in and say brother samuel i will put your bag in your car which car do you have and then all i got to do is tell you the car the color i'll give you what you need and when you walk out of there you can walk there with an authority because now not only do you know to put it in the car but now you know what the car is and you can walk right there and nothing there can stand in your way if that's that simple in the natural how much more for god god don't want you walking out here and say well lord what do you want here but ask him say god reveal yourself to me because there is power in revelation brother the spirit of god is the one who gives revelation and when that word is being revealed there step right into it that's getting in the spirit brother man would stand like this for healing in our body and he would express he said you know he's saying like this i'm just going to refer to it he said we have all read it countless times you know the promises on healing we've read it countless times but did not get in the spirit when reading it did we ask god for his spirit to teach us the real truth of it if we did we'd call the elders confess our sins be anointed and prayed for and that would be that let me just say this confessing your sins god don't hide nothing from you sometimes i've witnessed fat over the years of pastoring and even before that you'd have somebody say well i don't know if there's something wrong in my life i've been praying god don't play peekaboo god don't hide something back and say aha i got something against you guess what it is no god's desire is that there be nothing between you and him more than you desire that are you with me and if there's something that's there the spirit of god hey look the bible says that in healing the word healing means restore and when you look at it you'll never find god dealing in condemnation he all the spirit of god deals with conviction that's what the spirit of god will do and when conviction it's always conviction because of the sacrifice and it points you away back are you with me because god's interested in the promises being made manifest and applied to our lives oh my you ought to just say boo devil get out of here amen you see this is god's desire within it and the enemy like to keep it all scrupled up you know within it well maybe you don't have as good of faith you got to call the elders of the church that's the word of god if i needed reinforcement that is the word i'm not going to sit there in pride and say well i'm just going to speak it out maybe i need some divine assistance it ain't the faith of brother brian it ain't the faith of brother bill it would be the faith of jesus christ that was operating in their life that it would unite together to drive back that enemy and drive him off our ground come on brother and sister we are the army of the living god it's time to stop letting the devil isolate us and try to beat us down with things if we need help from somebody then let us reach out the bible said confess your faults one to another and pray that you be healed this is the word of the living god hallelujah glory be to god in the highest oh my it might not happen immediately but in his spirit it's over there's no other court of appeal i mean we see this in in the world i mean you take the world they enter right in they enter into the weekend spirit even i mean thursday night many of them started entering into thursday night they've entered into their weekend already right here they'll be talking tomorrow morning of all the of all the stuff that they've had in them from from tonight they've got their pre-weekend celebration how about you and i yeah come on church how about you and i you see it's they'll enter right into that and begin to get right into that this is exactly what the world will do the world will enter right into ball games i've seen people tell me well i'm not that emotional get them outside of church you can hardly shut them up but yet they won't say man i praise god inside a church don't tell me about your makeup come on somebody this is the most glorious time in reality if there's anything you ought to be talking about and talking to the lord and say thank you lord it's right here in the sanctuary of the living god it ought to be a time that we're thanking god for who he is what he's done and what he's doing we should enter right in to the spirit of the living god bring me a minstrel [Music] hallelujah now you see the hand of the lord let's look at this just for a few moments the hand of the lord here it comes in a situation because there's a need that's among them they don't know what to do they're without water and they're gonna die their cattle's gonna die everything is going to perish unless they get water so now it comes to dealing with what it is that's hindering me they they start out in this way but now what it what is it that's hindering you see one of the ways that when you look at it before the hand of the lord ever come there is no there is no prophecy or or word of deliverance for that situation but you see for that need in that situation god comes present and god does something that only he can do oh my you see god he will always come where there are hearts that are willing to cry out in times of need the king of israel wasn't asking for a prophet of the lord but jehoshaphat was asking for it jehoshaphat wasn't too big to to recognize i'm in over my head and i need help from almighty god you know what this sends a message to you and i when you and i come into those kind of places and unlawful alliances and things maybe trying to straighten things out on your own or take care of this it cannot be with just flesh and blood it fails that's why god would speak to israel when they would want to fall back on egypt their chariots and their horses if if another nation was coming against them but there is nothing can succeed when it trusts in the arm of flesh but when it can trust and lay our trust in the arm of almighty god brother that's where safety is that's where stability is that's where peace is that's where the glory is that's where the joy of the lord is a vision without the hand of the lord there is no vision like with ezekiel you'll find in the scriptures without me reading of places here tonight to refer to how that the hand of the lord would come upon ezekiel and pick him up and would carry him and and he would see hear the wheel in the middle of the wheel when the hand of the lord would come upon him it would pick him up as he says in one place by the lock of my hair and he would begin to show him in the visions of god regarding jerusalem he would begin to reveal to him by the hand of the lord visions of wire that israel had gone astray and while they were in captivity so the hand of the lord is not always about glory and power but the hand of the lord also moves to bring and break strongholds to move upon hearts and lives and things where a person can say what's going on but the spirit of god can come by way of a vision of his word and begin to lift up and and make known hey here's a pathway or or this is where things have gone astray or or this is how to get back on track i'm grateful for the hand of almighty god let me tell you something brother random himself when you think of standing there and here he he had the vision god gave him the vision of the of that little finished boy that would be that would be raised up when he had been killed on the side of the road there in an accident and how that brother brown remember when he said he went there and as he was going there and he looked you know they stop and and they see us a situation and brother brown goes back now when he even sees that little boy brother graham said he looked at him he said something kind of just kind of moving within him like something about it i seem like i my you know i should know that little boy and he brother was just you know tore up for the situation and he turned and went to walk back to the car that he was riding in with brother moore in them and he said i felt a hand upon my shoulder and he said there wasn't nobody that was there around me said but the hand that was upon my hole my shoulder was that of a strength and so brother branham turned around and he began to think where have i seen that little boy before and then he sees the trees he sees the layout of the mountains and all of a sudden things begin to come together right there in that time that he realizes this is what god has spoke in a vision over in the homeland but there would be a little boy raised up and he told us go get your bible it's rolled in the flower leaf of the bible and brother adam would stand there like this he said i felt him draw near he said it wasn't now all the devils out of torment couldn't have stopped the vision from coming to pass why the hand of the lord came upon him [Applause] [Music] amen this is it don't miss it this is it don't miss it the hand of the lord came upon his life hallelujah oh think about it friends if not for the hand of almighty god you and i would miss it how many times brother branham's sitting there in the service and he said oh god they're going to miss it lord give me their name and all of a sudden their name is called out your healing sister or brother you're healed receive it in the name of the lord jesus christ what was it the hand of the lord that was present upon the prophet that same hand of the lord was moved and stretched out to minister to the need of his children that were right there you see god in every age when you think of it when john would see here in revelations 1 the bible speaks of how john returned to see the voice that spoke to him it had meaning to his life in john sees one likened to the son of man walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks he sees feet with you know with brass and out of his mouth a sharp two-edged sword hair as white as wool all of these symbols that speak of the authority of the word of god of the lord jesus christ and it would be revealed the vision that would be revealed the testimony of jesus christ would not be a vision of possum of this might be possible but it would be a vision to where he would take the very life out of john when he would see him and he would fall down at his feet but the bible says he stretched his right hand and laid it upon me and said fear not i tell you when john saw that vision it might have taken everything out of him think about it when the reality of the living god what did it do to your life when the revelation of jesus christ struck your heart brother it did away with that old life it brought a new life on the inside amen it was the right hand of almighty god his rack and his power and authority brother you just didn't have rights but you had the authority and the power of god to begin to live out the rights as a son and daughter of god why he put his hand upon me now in order for that hand to come upon our life god's desire for his his hand which his hand is the fulfillment of his word when you read in the scripture of how that he would speak regarding them in egypt that god that pharaoh would not let them go not by a mighty hand it could not be a mighty army that would release them that would only be temporary there would be another army that would rise up and bring them back into captivity but god let them know it will not be by a mighty hand by by that the mighty hand of natural but it will be but the stretch out arm of jehovah you know what that speaks of in the word the hand of the lord the mighty hand of god the right hand of god the arm of the lord his arm is stretched out it speaks of god condescending and coming personally with his power to bring strength to bring life to bring deliverance to bring vision to bring glory to bring healing that's what it speaks of through his word [Applause] hallelujah he's not an impersonal god [Applause] he ain't forgot about your trouble he ain't forgot about you he's not an onlooker he's governing right now in the affairs of men he knows right where he's at he never left you he's right there with you he's been right there with you the whole time when you felt down when you felt gloomy david said he knows my uprising and my down city he already knew all about it and god with his hand is right there to touch our lives it was his right hand that parted the sea his right arm here has him moved to parker the sea it was his outstretched arm that covered the sea back over and pharaoh and all of his army drowned there that day amen this is god making himself known the same way that god did there god has a promise and he cannot fail god promised there'll be a bride i'll present to my spell self without spot wrinkle or blemish she is a trophy of my grace she's a vessel of my mercy amen and i will bring her forth not barely making it but she will come forth crowned in my resurrection glory and power will not be one devil be able to stick its head up but it'll be already put underfoot and manifest in the bride of jesus christ sometimes you look at situations when they come your way and you wonder why did this come my way because god needs to manifest overcoming power through your life and let the devil know that i am still the same jehovah i've got people on earth who believe me amen and will still let me and invite me to be me hallelujah in the right hand there's seven stars are you with right me is power and authority the church in every age after the message would go forth calling them to what to the life not calling them to a church somewhere but calling them to life but they would go astray brother said you would think he said when you would read it as he walks in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and there is a ministry of ephesians 4 he said but yet you'll find he said that the church would go astray but god has made a promise he has seven stars in his right hand seven messengers to each one of those ages and what god would do within that age is god brother brahm says it like this i love it he said god would bring himself on the scene through the ministry of those stars it would be god bringing himself and the life yielded to god they would be yielded to god maybe they at first were part of an organization but god would begin to reveal his word and because they were tied to christ there was a pulsation when the right hand of god would be laid upon their life they would renounce organization they would walk away from it and walk with god and withstand the devil why because the hand of the lord was upon their life hallelujah god would bring himself on the scene he would unfold his power and his authority and let me just say it to you like this that didn't leave when the messenger left amen if all we've been left is books and tapes we're in trouble if all we got is quotes we're in trouble the devil don't care how right you are in your doctrine but as long as you miss that life let me tell you something the life is a living organism it lives it expresses itself its pulsation there are manifestations of the truth of almighty god in the church of the living god amen hallelujah that's god's promise he said he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water amen he said that he that will believe on me the works that i do shall you do also amen lord be to god that word being revealed brother and sister the word being revealed oh my the spirit of the living god moving in our life oh my no matter where that you might be sitting at but to think how the hand of the lord would move down upon your life and be with your heart so much so that there are questions that you could have but you could stand there and say there ain't no way brother samuel he didn't know that or brother andrew whoever it wasn't stood there they didn't know that but god knew that and even if a man knew your need it would take more than the intellect of a man or the fine words of a man a man could not put words together he might be able to move you here or move you there but it takes the spirit of god to place your faith in god no wonder the scripture says in first peter 5 i'm coming down it would say you younger submit yourselves unto the elder all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time humble ourselves under the mighty hand of god the mighty god moving right here in our midst yes listen friends to talk about what god did back in 1965 will do you no good today but if you talk about it in a way that you say i know what god did back there it was only announcing that there were more in the field that were coming forth there's more sons and daughters of god that come into maturity let me just announce to hell we're not coming there we've arrived doom devils are on the run come on now amen brother bran was saying another place be careful satan amen there's a people on earth that know who they are they know where they're standing they that know their god shall do great exploits why the hand of the lord has come we were in desperate trouble our lives were all clogged up with organization and everything else you might have been raised right in the message but still clogged up with unbelief but here the spirit of god would move down and say dig this valley full of ditches get everything out of your life that's contrary to the word it might have been things that the enemies wanted to tell you about you what should i do kick it out just get rid of it just throw it right out of your life if it's something that says you'll never have victory throw that thing right out of your life what do i do dig that valley full of ditches keep digging the things that god keeps moving upon your heart keep digging under the hand of almighty god glory be to god don't be discouraged amen you've got a word from the lord amen dig that valley full of ditches open up those channels open up the hell that the life of god might flow down i like how the bible says there would not be it would not be the sound of rain it would not be wind they weren't going to hear anything but you know what it was the same god that walked the same grounds that provided for them when they were thirsty before brother drake that same rock was right there supernaturally the water of life entered what they had dug out the spirit of god never dug it out for him elisha never came and dug it out for him but the hand of the lord gave him authority there was a need in their life and no matter what the enemy has said you've got authority to throw it out hallelujah to dig it out maybe it's a place in your life you say i want more of the spirit of god to flow through i don't want a narrow passage i want him to have liberty i want it to flow through my life what do i do to get out why do i dig it out just get right in the spirit and say yes lord be it unto me according to thy word glory be to god what happens there's a surge that begins to move what are you doing you're opening up and making way for the water of god to flow down into your life amen this is how it comes with every life and every heart there must be a consecration to the voice of almighty god when god's hand it comes upon that life it's god moving to open up vision and through that vision now as things begin to come back in order the power of god will begin to flow deliverance begins to move healing begins to flow all because of the hand of the lord you take the hand of the lord from the church of the living god and she's in trouble that's right but i want to remind you the hand of the lord is what came upon elijah and caused him to outrun the chariot of ahab are you with me amen it's the same hand of the lord that when there was a drought that god had called for through elijah when it came time for rain to come back upon the land elijah said to his servant go look over the sea he went the first time and looked he said i don't see nothing elijah said go again came back i don't see nothing go again he came back i don't see nothing go again finally on the seventh time he saw a cloud and when he saw that cloud that cloud was in the shape of a man's hand let me tell you something it's not a coincidence that out there on sunset mountain amen that the cloud of the lord in this hour would come down as the hand of the lord as the authority of almighty god come into the church of the living god that would let the church of the living god know there are channels to be cleared out we couldn't clear them out with seminary experiences we can't clear them out just with knowledge of quotes it takes the authority and power of almighty god takes the hand of the lord hallelujah i say tonight let's dig this valley full of ditches hallelujah amen maybe you've got a request in your life a need in your life tonight i'll tell you i would count this as a real special opportunity i know i don't need to tell you this but there wasn't totally minded i thought for example i knew exactly where we were going tonight but this morning the spirit of god just said here this is the direction i want you to go i want you to move in this direction so you know when that comes in that way and begin to pray about in the spirit of god just moving down i know that there is a vision to break upon the lives of the people there is deliverance there is healing there is an outpouring of the holy ghost god does not do anything in vain but god does it with the reason and direction in our life you believe that amen to say god amen let every every every avenue lord let me dig out the ditches lord that the spirit of god could flow through in my life amen if there's things that's wrong make it right dig it out if there's unbelief throw it out of your life if there's habits there from out of your life get rid of them hey man you don't have to beg and plead there's authority that's present dig it out of your life amen amen let's go to god in prayer heavenly father lord jesus as we stand here tonight lord oh god in your great presence

you provided for yourself lord you brought yourself on the scene [Music] men could try to stab it and probe that truth but comparing bible verse to bible verse was not enough we were in need of the truth himself to come on the scene he who is the way the truth and the life he is the word to bring a word experience in our life that our life then becomes the living word of god expressed where it becomes the absolute in our life oh god i pray lord jesus right here this this evening lord there's young people that need a real touch from you there's hearts and lives god and we just invite you

yield to him just step right into it it's like the water that would be troubled at the pool of bethesda when the angel of the lord would come down upon the water and trouble it that same angel the

touch anything it would spread even further so then uh when sam was praying and then when he finished i looked up there the blisters were gone i also i went to the doctor and he said i went to a doctor and had cancer and i saw him uh today he said it's not as bad as i thought it was going to be worse than what he said it was but he said no i said stage one he said wiggy said he used to have 42 treatments so we got it down to five he said it could be minimally invasive and you'll be fine not that much discomfort he said took six six scores he's in one of them at 70 he said but he's not
