[38:09] importance of understanding serpent seed
[38:11] and I want to continue with that thought
[38:20] Genesis chapter 3 verse 14.
[38:24] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[38:27] because thou has done this Thou Art
[38:29] cursed above all cattle and above every
[38:32] beast of the field and upon thy belly
[38:34] shalt thou go and thus shalt thou eat
[38:37] all the days of thy life
[38:39] and I will put enmity between Thee the
[38:41] woman between thy seed and her seed
[38:44] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[38:48] shalt bruise his heel
[38:50] may be seated
[38:52] if you can just hold on to your Bibles
[38:54] for a moment there's a couple of
[38:56] scriptures I want to go to here but
[39:00] the reason I read this for a text to
[39:03] start out is because you can see that
[39:07] God mentions the serpent having a seed
[39:11] so to me that's the very first thing
[39:14] for understanding the serpent Siege is
[39:16] that God mentioned it had a seed
[39:20] so the uh phrase of serpent seed is not
[39:25] just something that's been concocted by
[39:27] a man
[39:29] it's right here in the scripture
[39:31] and so if it's in the scriptures then
[39:34] there's a truth to it
[39:36] amen
[39:38] now if it had been fruit in the garden
[39:41] that caused the fog then God would have
[39:43] been cursed in the tree like he did the
[39:45] Fig Tree and through Jesus Christ when
[39:48] it didn't yield for figs when it was
[39:51] supposed to
[39:52] but he didn't curse the tree he didn't
[39:55] curse fruit
[39:56] you didn't curse those things he cursed
[39:58] the serpent
[40:01] and said that it had a seed but he also
[40:04] said the woman would have a seed now I
[40:06] want to turn to Genesis chapter 4. and I
[40:10] want to look at the character of Cain
[40:13] because we want to see who's Kane's
[40:16] Daddy
[40:17] and we want to
[40:20] see what seed he is of because we've
[40:24] said here by the scripture there's two
[40:26] seeds
[40:27] so which seed was cane of
[40:30] and we can see this by his character
[40:32] verse 3.
[40:34] through nine
[40:36] in the process of time it came to pass
[40:38] that came brought of the fruit of the
[40:40] ground and offering unto the Lord and
[40:42] Abel he also brought up the first knees
[40:44] of his flock and of the fat thereof and
[40:47] the Lord had respect unto ab1 to his
[40:50] offering then decaying into his offering
[40:52] he had not respect and Cain was very
[40:55] Roth and his countenance fell and the
[40:58] Lord said unto the Cain why thou Roth
[40:59] why is that countenance Fallen
[41:02] if thou doest well shalt thou not be
[41:05] accepted
[41:06] and if thou doest not well sin lieth at
[41:08] the door and unto thee shall be his
[41:11] desire and thou shalt rule over him
[41:14] and Cain talked with Abel his brother
[41:16] and it came to pass when they were in
[41:19] the field that Cain rose up against Abel
[41:21] his brother and slew him
[41:23] and the Lord said unto Cain where is
[41:26] Abel thy brother and he said I know not
[41:29] am I My Brother's Keeper
[41:32] now
[41:33] this is showing the character of Cain
[41:37] was a murderer
[41:45] I've done some studying on
[41:48] different uh
[41:51] what you want to call them disorders
[41:53] within people and things
[41:55] and one of the things that that I found
[41:58] to
[41:59] be equal across the board
[42:01] is that people don't just turn 50 and
[42:05] all of a sudden become a murderer
[42:08] people don't just turn 50 and all of a
[42:10] sudden become a child molester
[42:12] there's seeds that were back there
[42:14] already in their character already in
[42:16] their person
[42:18] and Cain
[42:21] was a murderer and that's why I killed
[42:23] his brother
[42:27] he turned out in character like his
[42:30] father a bringer of death a murderer
[42:33] his utter Defiance of God when faced by
[42:37] the Almighty
[42:39] in Genesis
[42:40] four and five
[42:44] and six
[42:46] 9 and 13 14.
[42:49] show him to be absolutely unhuman like
[42:51] in characteristics
[42:54] seeming even to surpass any account we
[42:57] have in the scriptures concerning a
[42:59] confrontation of Satan by God
[43:03] turn with me to verse John chapter 3.
[43:19] first John chapter 3 verse 12.
[43:24] and it says not as king
[43:26] who was of that Wicked one
[43:29] and slew his brother
[43:31] and War for slew he him because his own
[43:34] Works were evil and his brothers
[43:36] righteous
[43:38] so it said Cain was of the wicked one
[43:42] now turns me to Luke
[43:44] chapter 3.
[43:48] verse 38.
[43:59] it says which was the son of Enos which
[44:02] was the son of Seth which was the son of
[44:05] Adam which was the son of God
[44:09] so
[44:10] who's Cain's father it was the Wicked
[44:13] one
[44:15] and Abraham is called the son of God
[44:17] so he can't beat Cain's father
[44:20] because it was the Wicked one that was
[44:21] his father to me it's so clearly in the
[44:25] scriptures
[44:26] that you'd have to not believe the Bible
[44:29] to not believe servancy
[44:33] now if it hadn't been opened to somebody
[44:36] I don't look down on them
[44:39] but I take all opportunity I can to try
[44:43] to slip these things in there
[44:47] um
[44:48] I guess everyone maybe has their
[44:50] different ways of of testifying to
[44:53] people and trying to reach people
[44:55] mine is a little more subtle I don't
[44:58] Hammer them right in the face
[45:01] I uh I I try to watch for doors to open
[45:04] and slip things in and try to slip some
[45:07] questions to them
[45:09] to get them to think
[45:13] in Genesis 3 Adam called his wife's name
[45:17] Eve he said because she was the mother
[45:19] of all living
[45:20] nowhere in the scriptures does it ever
[45:22] say that Adam was the father of all
[45:24] living
[45:29] so I think by this we can see
[45:32] where the serpent seed started
[45:35] who's father
[45:38] who was the father of Cain now if you
[45:41] turns me to
[45:43] Romans chapter 9.
[45:46] and I want to take a look at the
[45:48] election
[45:50] Romans chapter 9 verse 10. through 14.
[45:54] not only this but when Rebecca also had
[45:58] conceived by one even by Our Father
[46:00] Isaac for the children being not yet
[46:03] born neither having done any good or
[46:05] evil that the purpose of God according
[46:08] to election might stand not of works but
[46:10] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[46:13] the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it
[46:16] is written Jacob have I loved but Esau
[46:19] have I hated
[46:20] that's referring to Malachi chapter 1
[46:23] verses 2 and 3.
[46:25] what shalt thou say then is there
[46:28] unrighteousness with God
[46:30] in Malachi he says the people question
[46:35] God worry and has thou loved us
[46:40] God's love is elective
[46:47] the proof of his love
[46:50] is not that you don't face trials
[46:52] or not that you don't face suffering but
[46:55] the proof of his love is that he elected
[46:58] you
[46:59] he called you
[47:03] now why did he do that
[47:06] Because of Who You Are
[47:11] you're the children of God
[47:13] you're
[47:16] from the lineage of Adam
[47:19] not from the lineage of the serpent
[47:25] ER
[47:28] he chose you to Salvation
[47:31] and that's proof of his love
[47:35] I like that song it says he didn't have
[47:38] to open my eyes
[47:41] he could have easily passed me by
[47:44] for the age I was living in was wretched
[47:46] poor and blind
[47:48] but then I heard recognizing your day
[47:52] serpent seed
[47:57] [Music]
[48:00] Hallelujah
[48:05] foreknowledge
[48:07] that's how
[48:09] that God elects
[48:15] um
[48:20] and the Adam and his seat after him
[48:22] brother Brown says now if he's infinite
[48:24] by his foreknowledge he knew who would
[48:27] come to him and who would not come to
[48:29] him
[48:30] he knew who would be saved and who would
[48:31] not be saved
[48:33] that certainly would clear up Romans 8
[48:36] and 9 for you if there's any question
[48:39] about whether he calls his children by
[48:42] election or not for Paul's speaking of
[48:45] Esau and Jacob before either child was
[48:47] born not even knowing what was right
[48:51] from or wrong God said I love Jacob and
[48:55] I hate Esau before either child even had
[48:59] a way to make a choice
[49:01] but God knew from the beginning what
[49:03] Esau was
[49:05] he knew what Jacob was
[49:07] and God knowed in the beginning what you
[49:10] were and what you are not
[49:13] so therefore he cannot
[49:15] be nothing but what you we cannot be
[49:18] nothing but what he made us
[49:21] if we could be like somebody else let's
[49:23] just be what God made us that's all we
[49:26] can do
[49:29] and the faith of Abraham he says
[49:32] predestination is a hard word
[49:34] among the congregation of people because
[49:36] predestination really foreknowledge is a
[49:39] better word and predestination looks
[49:41] back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge
[49:44] looks on to Destiny now
[49:47] the reason I chose this topic of the
[49:51] importance of understanding serpent seed
[49:53] is that
[49:55] without understanding that you can't
[49:57] understand predestination
[50:01] and there are there are people
[50:04] within different religions that don't
[50:06] believe in predestination
[50:09] even though it's in the Bible
[50:13] it said he predestinated us
[50:18] but they stumble at it because they say
[50:22] how could God do that because everyone
[50:24] has should have a choice for God to be
[50:27] just everyone does have a choice
[50:32] but God being infinite knows what they
[50:36] will choose
[50:41] thank you
[50:42] and knowing what they would choose those
[50:45] that he knew would choose him
[50:49] he makes a way of redemption for them
[50:55] and because he knows then he can
[50:59] already your destination has already
[51:02] been determined
[51:05] I
[51:08] I'll be coming back up here this next
[51:10] coming month for a little while
[51:12] and toward the end of the month I plan
[51:15] to to bring my wife Mina up so she can
[51:19] be here to see her mom and then she can
[51:21] help me drive back home when we go back
[51:23] home
[51:24] but I I went online and I bought her a
[51:27] ticket because I knew she was going to
[51:29] come
[51:32] so I bought her a ticket
[51:36] now
[51:38] heard her destination is Cleveland Ohio
[51:44] and God your ticket has already been
[51:47] bought
[51:49] when you were sealed by the Holy Ghost
[51:52] of promise that right there shows your
[51:56] tickets already been bought and your
[51:58] destination has already been set
[52:03] we can begin to look up on the board of
[52:05] the signs of time and see when our
[52:09] departure is coming
[52:16] for knowledge he looks to Destiny
[52:20] let God be an infinite in the beginning
[52:22] knew the end from the beginning
[52:24] therefore he knew what people would do
[52:27] so he could foretell what would take
[52:30] place for he knew what would be
[52:33] therefore before Esau and Jacob Peter
[52:36] was born God said Esau have I hated
[52:38] Jacob have I loved because he foreknew
[52:42] what they could be
[52:44] he never made Esau the way that he was
[52:48] he wasn't willing that Esau would be
[52:50] that way
[52:51] but Esau by choice
[52:54] was that way
[52:56] and God knew
[52:59] would take that that he would take that
[53:03] weight so that's how he knows us today
[53:05] he knows your heart
[53:07] you might be able to fool your neighbor
[53:09] you might be able to fool your pastor
[53:11] but you'll never be able to fool God
[53:13] because he knows your heart
[53:17] therefore he by election he chose
[53:19] Abraham for he knew what Abraham would
[53:23] do
[53:24] you remember when he called him out
[53:25] there and he said he'd not keep a thing
[53:28] secret from him
[53:30] and when he was going down to destroy
[53:31] Sodom in the morning he says for I know
[53:34] that Abraham will teach his children I
[53:36] know it God himself I know that Abraham
[53:39] will send this message down from one to
[53:42] the other generation
[53:44] but God
[53:46] for knowing that and knowing that
[53:48] Abraham would do it then he told Abraham
[53:51] the beginning that he would save him and
[53:53] save his seat after him and would give
[53:56] him an unconditional Covenant that he
[53:58] made with Abraham not because Abraham
[54:00] was good
[54:02] but because God was good
[54:05] hallelujah it's called because you and I
[54:08] were good because we're not and we
[54:11] weren't it's because God is good
[54:21] now brother Branham in this message
[54:23] South African testimony he speaks he
[54:26] speaks about his ministry and there was
[54:28] a reason I wanted to
[54:29] include this quote
[54:32] uh it's right here toward the end of it
[54:35] but brother random says here's what I am
[54:37] to you
[54:38] by Sovereign Grace before there was a
[54:41] world God knew I would be here and have
[54:44] this ministry
[54:46] how many believes that sure he does
[54:49] then it was sent to you people
[54:53] I'm glad to see you Full Gospel people
[54:55] believe in election because that's where
[54:58] the whole thing lies is in election
[55:00] that's right in election God chose that
[55:03] nothing we could do God has done
[55:08] well then me to you
[55:11] is a sign of the Lord Jesus Christ so
[55:15] he's saying him his ministry to the
[55:18] people
[55:19] is a sign of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:22] like a pastor or any other Pastor when
[55:27] they preach the gospel see them anointed
[55:30] by the Holy Spirit that's a sign to you
[55:34] so God ain't left us without a sign
[55:37] when you see the anointed preaching of
[55:40] your pastor that is a sign to you
[55:52] amen God knew before the foundation of
[55:55] the world that we'd have this service
[55:58] on this day
[56:00] and he knew who would be here
[56:03] they knew who wouldn't be here
[56:06] he knew who would have already went on
[56:09] to Glory by this time
[56:17] and Jeremiah 1 and 5.
[56:20] the Lord says before I form thee in the
[56:23] belly I knew thee before thou camest out
[56:27] of the womb I Sanctified thee and I
[56:30] ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations
[56:34] so this is before
[56:38] that he was ever formed in his mother's
[56:40] womb
[56:41] not just before he was born
[56:43] but before he was ever even formed in
[56:46] his mother's womb
[56:48] God knew him
[56:52] you can say the same about yourself
[56:56] before you ever formed in the womb of
[56:59] your mother God knew you why because he
[57:04] knew you in himself
[57:07] you are the manifested thoughts of God
[57:10] for this day and age
[57:20] John the Baptist 712 years before he was
[57:23] born he was the voice of one crying in
[57:26] the wilderness said Isaiah is that true
[57:30] understand 712 years before he was born
[57:34] Isaiah said it's the voice of one crying
[57:37] in the wilderness
[57:42] Jeremiah God told Jeremiah before you
[57:44] were ever formed in your mother's womb I
[57:46] knew you and Sanctified you and ordained
[57:48] you to be a prophet over the Nations
[57:52] before he was ever formed from his
[57:55] mother's womb Moses and many others
[57:59] foreign by God
[58:02] by the foreknowledge of God
[58:05] and that's the only way I can expect any
[58:07] to understand being to the people who
[58:11] come and see it here
[58:13] now the Bible says Jesus says no man can
[58:18] come to me except the father draws him
[58:20] first
[58:28] so man don't seek God brother Branham
[58:31] says
[58:32] God calls Man by election for knowledge
[58:34] of God
[58:36] like when Jesus Christ when he was born
[58:39] he was the son of God he couldn't help
[58:42] because he was the son of God he was for
[58:45] ordained the Son of God before the world
[58:47] began
[58:48] he was the son of God and he was the
[58:52] woman's seed from the Garden of Eden
[58:55] that was to be to bruise the Serpent's
[58:59] head
[59:00] and he had nothing to do with it it was
[59:02] already planned out
[59:06] so if God had before the foundation
[59:09] weren't already planned out Redemption
[59:12] had already planned out how Jesus his
[59:15] son would come
[59:18] then God has already planned out how you
[59:22] would come to me
[59:28] you have the color of eyes you have
[59:30] because God created you to have that
[59:33] color of eyes
[59:41] say why would God care about the color
[59:43] of eyes
[59:45] I recall
[59:47] I believe it was a little blind girl
[59:49] come up before brother Branham she
[59:51] didn't have no eyes
[59:54] brother Brandon prayed for her that God
[59:56] would give her eyes
[59:59] and then before she went to walk away he
[1:00:01] said I forgot to ask you what color do
[1:00:03] you want
[1:00:11] what a creator
[1:00:14] what a creative
[1:00:16] Hallelujah
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:20] he created you to be what you are
[1:00:24] Hallelujah and you know what is the
[1:00:27] Glorious thing about it
[1:00:29] is it's got nothing to do with you
[1:00:33] God knows what you're going to choose
[1:00:35] and then God chooses you
[1:00:38] but then us in our human nature that
[1:00:41] Fallen nature
[1:00:43] it doesn't matter nothing about that
[1:00:45] nature that nature is going to die
[1:00:48] and you're going to receive a new nature
[1:00:51] but it doesn't matter how you in that
[1:00:55] worldly nature would try to get away
[1:00:57] from God you won't be able to do it
[1:01:00] why because he has four ordained you
[1:01:06] why because he knows that over top of
[1:01:09] everything that tries to stop you in the
[1:01:11] end you will choose him
[1:01:15] [Applause]
[1:01:29] you got saved because God chose you
[1:01:32] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:01:34] saved
[1:01:35] that's the scripture teaching
[1:01:37] now you see we begin to find out it's
[1:01:41] not us it's him he chose us
[1:01:45] now listen to this is in Jehovah Jireh
[1:01:49] can you see healing is yours
[1:01:52] salvation is yours it's a free gift of
[1:01:54] God that God gave you and called you and
[1:01:58] chose you before the foundation of the
[1:02:00] world he chose you
[1:02:03] you're his Heir why he watches over you
[1:02:07] day and night trying to get to you to do
[1:02:12] something for you
[1:02:15] he watches over his day and night
[1:02:18] why just wanting to do something for us
[1:02:27] you say well brother Branham I've made
[1:02:29] mistakes last week or last month
[1:02:32] I don't care how many mistakes you make
[1:02:35] we've all sinned and come short of the
[1:02:36] glory
[1:02:38] if you're now listen to this if you're a
[1:02:40] child of Abraham you're ready to
[1:02:42] recognize that as Sin
[1:02:46] and come back to God again and God's
[1:02:49] mercy still hangs to you
[1:02:54] Hallelujah
[1:02:58] I don't know about you but that makes me
[1:03:00] happy
[1:03:03] because
[1:03:05] I am a man that's full of mistakes
[1:03:09] so it makes me happy to know that God's
[1:03:12] Mercy is still there for me
[1:03:17] for all you perfect ones will God bless
[1:03:20] you
[1:03:27] together
[1:03:29] turns me to Matthew chapter 10 verse 2
[1:03:33] through 4.
[1:03:55] now the names of the 12 apostles
[1:03:58] are these the first Simon who is called
[1:04:02] Peter and Andrew is brother and James
[1:04:04] the son of Zebedee and John his brother
[1:04:07] Philip and Bartholomew Thomas and
[1:04:10] Matthew
[1:04:11] the Publican James the son of
[1:04:15] I don't know how to pronounce that
[1:04:18] and labius whose surname was Thaddeus
[1:04:24] Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot
[1:04:27] who also betrayed him so Judas was one
[1:04:31] of the twelve
[1:04:36] and Jesus says that the father gave
[1:04:40] Judas to him
[1:04:48] now how is that
[1:04:53] well Cain was given into the hands of
[1:04:57] Adam
[1:05:01] Cain was without excuse
[1:05:05] he was raised by the same parents that
[1:05:08] raised Abel
[1:05:14] hmm
[1:05:16] Judas
[1:05:18] had opportunity
[1:05:20] he had choice
[1:05:31] received Church by the word world where
[1:05:34] the REM says
[1:05:37] they were in the upper chamber all with
[1:05:39] one Accord and all the world had drained
[1:05:41] out of them and they were emptied up and
[1:05:43] the Holy Ghost came
[1:05:46] today they say come join the church put
[1:05:48] your name on a book and bow down and say
[1:05:49] I confess Christ as the son of God
[1:05:54] the devil does the same thing certainly
[1:05:58] the devil was baptized when Judas was
[1:06:00] baptized
[1:06:01] the devil went out and preached the
[1:06:03] gospel when Judas went out and preached
[1:06:05] the gospel
[1:06:07] but the devil didn't get the Holy Ghost
[1:06:13] so Judas was right with them
[1:06:16] up until the end
[1:06:19] and he was absent from the upper room
[1:06:23] why because he had already made his
[1:06:25] choice prior to that
[1:06:32] in Jude one in four it says for there
[1:06:36] are certain men crept and unawares who
[1:06:38] were before of old ordained to this
[1:06:41] condemnation
[1:06:42] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[1:06:45] into lavishness
[1:06:47] and denying the only Lord God in our
[1:06:50] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:53] so God knowing what they would be
[1:06:56] could foreordain them to condemnation
[1:07:03] these men of old
[1:07:06] foreign
[1:07:08] to condemnation
[1:07:13] is that right man for ordained too old
[1:07:16] to this condemnation like Pharaoh in
[1:07:19] Egypt
[1:07:20] Judas Iscariot born the son of perdition
[1:07:25] in second Peter 3 and 7 it says but the
[1:07:29] heavens and earth which are now by the
[1:07:31] same word are kept in store reserved
[1:07:35] unto fire against the day of judgment
[1:07:37] and Perdition of ungodly men
[1:07:40] so there's something reserved for those
[1:07:42] that don't choose God
[1:07:48] doesn't send anyone to hell
[1:07:51] they go there by choice
[1:07:54] everyone has a choice
[1:07:59] there are people who don't understand
[1:08:02] predestination they say how could you
[1:08:04] have a choice and God predestinates some
[1:08:07] people to be lost
[1:08:12] God knows what they'll choose
[1:08:15] he knows they'll choose to stay lost
[1:08:22] he knows what they'll choose over top of
[1:08:24] him
[1:08:25] God knows people will choose religion
[1:08:30] look Cain's lineage became religious
[1:08:33] they built cities they built churches
[1:08:37] Cain was religious
[1:08:40] God knows that there will be people who
[1:08:42] will choose religion over top of him
[1:08:46] over top of his word
[1:08:56] Jesus said while I was with them in the
[1:08:59] world I kept them
[1:09:01] in thy name those that thou gave us me I
[1:09:04] kept and none of them is lost but the
[1:09:07] Son of Perdition that the scripture
[1:09:10] might be fulfilled
[1:09:14] the Bible tells us that God raised up
[1:09:16] pharaoh and hardened Pharaoh's heart
[1:09:20] God knew what choices Pharaoh would make
[1:09:23] so God used pharaoh to bring about his
[1:09:27] fulfillment of his word
[1:09:30] he had told Abraham your children will
[1:09:34] go into will be in bondage 400 years and
[1:09:37] then I will bring them out by a mighty
[1:09:40] hand
[1:09:42] and God allowed Pharaoh's heart to
[1:09:46] become hardened
[1:09:48] just like
[1:09:49] when
[1:09:51] Ahab and Jehoshaphat sat there
[1:09:56] and
[1:09:59] God said looking down what can we do to
[1:10:03] bring about the Fulfillment of the words
[1:10:06] of Elijah
[1:10:10] and it says that a lying Spirit came up
[1:10:13] out of hell
[1:10:15] and said I'll go down and be a lying
[1:10:19] Spirit within the mouse of His prophets
[1:10:25] and God allowed it
[1:10:34] God raised up Judas Iscariot he was born
[1:10:37] here the Son of Perdition
[1:10:39] God told Esau on Jacob before they were
[1:10:42] ever born
[1:10:44] told his mother all about what was going
[1:10:47] to take place one he'd hate and the
[1:10:49] other he would had love is that true so
[1:10:53] it's God who does all things in all
[1:10:56] things you have nothing to do with it
[1:10:59] and if God called you
[1:11:01] the love of God is ringing in your heart
[1:11:04] and all that he has called will come to
[1:11:07] him
[1:11:08] none of will be lost God's promise he
[1:11:12] said none of them would be lost
[1:11:15] all the fathers give me will come to me
[1:11:17] and none of them is lost but Judas
[1:11:19] Iscariot
[1:11:21] that the scriptures might be fulfilled
[1:11:24] and I'll raise them up at the last day
[1:11:27] again earnestly continue for the faith
[1:11:29] he says
[1:11:31] here was the son of God come down from
[1:11:34] the ivory palaces of God made flesh and
[1:11:37] dwelt Among Us and here's Judas the Son
[1:11:40] of Perdition he come from hell and
[1:11:44] returning back to hell
[1:11:46] here's God in flesh come from Heaven
[1:11:48] returning back to heaven
[1:11:55] if you ask me God's more than just
[1:11:59] when he would allow someone who come
[1:12:01] from Hell still to have a choice
[1:12:05] but he had to because he allowed in the
[1:12:08] beginning he allowed Lucifer to have a
[1:12:11] choice
[1:12:15] he allowed the angels to have a choice
[1:12:19] and there was angels that chose to
[1:12:21] follow Lucifer
[1:12:23] and those that chose to stay with
[1:12:25] Michael
[1:12:39] thank you
[1:12:42] the faith of Abraham he said you see
[1:12:45] Cain
[1:12:46] who was inspired by his daddy Satan
[1:12:49] which we know was in
[1:12:52] he was inspired by Satan he was the
[1:12:54] first murderer the first liar and he
[1:12:57] killed his brother
[1:12:58] Judas Iscariot in a pre-figure exactly
[1:13:02] as Judas killed Jesus At The Cross Cain
[1:13:05] killed Abel at the cross of sacrifice
[1:13:07] perfectly
[1:13:09] so here he's showing the connection
[1:13:13] between Cain and Judas that are of the
[1:13:16] same seed
[1:13:21] it would be so close
[1:13:24] that it would deceive the very elective
[1:13:26] possible
[1:13:29] the serpent seed got in among the twelve
[1:13:34] and stayed right with them
[1:13:36] right up
[1:13:38] until before them going to the upper
[1:13:40] room
[1:13:43] thank you
[1:13:47] Hallelujah
[1:13:49] Romans 8 29 30.
[1:13:55] for whom he did for no
[1:13:58] he also did predestinate
[1:14:01] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:14:04] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:14:06] many brother moreover whom he did
[1:14:09] predestinate them he also called
[1:14:12] and whom he called damn he also
[1:14:14] Justified
[1:14:15] in whom he justified them he also
[1:14:18] glorified
[1:14:22] this is already a finished work
[1:14:31] we look many times at ourselves
[1:14:35] a mental picture of ourselves our life
[1:14:38] and there's times we look at it and say
[1:14:41] and we don't say oh I'm I believe I'm in
[1:14:44] the image of God by what I'm seeing
[1:14:47] many times we can become discouraged
[1:14:49] Satan is accuser of the brother points
[1:14:52] at every fault failure and mistake
[1:14:58] but this says we will be conformed to
[1:15:01] the image of his son
[1:15:04] it's not something that you've got to do
[1:15:07] it's something he's doing
[1:15:15] in whom he did predestinate he then he
[1:15:18] called who he called he justified who he
[1:15:20] justified them he glorified
[1:15:24] Hallelujah
[1:15:26] turn me to Ephesians chapter 1 verses 3
[1:15:30] through 14.
[1:15:35] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:15:38] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[1:15:40] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:15:43] places in Christ according as he had
[1:15:45] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:15:47] of the world that we should be holy
[1:15:49] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:15:53] predestinate us unto adoption of
[1:15:55] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:15:58] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:16:00] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:16:03] grace wherein he hath made us accepted
[1:16:06] in the Beloved
[1:16:08] in whom we have Redemption through the
[1:16:11] blood
[1:16:15] the Forgiveness of sins according to the
[1:16:17] riches of his grace
[1:16:19] we're in Heath abound toward us in all
[1:16:22] wisdom and prudence
[1:16:24] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:16:26] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:16:28] which he have purposed in himself
[1:16:31] that in the dispensation of the fullness
[1:16:33] of times he might gather together in one
[1:16:36] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:16:39] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:16:41] him
[1:16:42] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:16:44] inheritance being predestinated
[1:16:46] according to the purpose of him who
[1:16:48] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:16:50] his will
[1:16:52] that we should be to the praise of his
[1:16:54] glory who first trusted in Christ in
[1:16:58] whom he also trusted after that you
[1:17:00] heard the word of Truth The Gospel of
[1:17:03] your salvation heard the word of Truth
[1:17:05] we
[1:17:09] were ordained to hear the word of Truth
[1:17:13] in this last day
[1:17:17] in the midst of all criticism
[1:17:22] of this message
[1:17:24] in the midst of all the people that come
[1:17:28] in amongst us and have left
[1:17:30] and have decided to try to find fault
[1:17:34] and to criticize here's what I say they
[1:17:38] were not ordained to see it
[1:17:41] just as Judas is scary it was not
[1:17:44] ordained to get the Holy Ghost
[1:17:47] they were not ordained to be sealed by
[1:17:50] the Holy Spirit of promise
[1:17:57] Jesus said things at times intentionally
[1:18:03] to make people stumble
[1:18:08] except you eat the Flesh of the son of
[1:18:10] man and drink his blood you have no life
[1:18:12] in you
[1:18:14] and he never explained it
[1:18:20] and can you imagine carnal Minds
[1:18:25] eating his flesh and drinking his blood
[1:18:28] what in the world this is a Madman
[1:18:35] and he didn't explain it
[1:18:38] and the Bible says many left him over
[1:18:40] that scene
[1:18:41] that's right
[1:18:43] and then when they left he turned to his
[1:18:46] disciples said will you go also
[1:18:52] Peter always ready to speak up
[1:18:57] he said Lord where can we go
[1:18:59] thou alone has the words of life
[1:19:05] somebody could have poked Peter and said
[1:19:08] Peter what did he mean by that Peter
[1:19:10] said I have no idea
[1:19:18] when he said
[1:19:20] if you tear this Temple down I'll raise
[1:19:22] it up again in three days
[1:19:24] the disciples were looking around at
[1:19:26] that Temple just like everybody else
[1:19:29] well I don't know if he says he can do
[1:19:31] it I believe it
[1:19:35] they didn't understand it wasn't until
[1:19:37] later these understandings come to them
[1:19:39] when did it come to them to understand
[1:19:40] what he meant by he would raise it up
[1:19:42] again in three days when he raised from
[1:19:45] the dead and appeared to them
[1:19:48] [Applause]
[1:19:55] you say how I got questions brother how
[1:19:58] am I going to know this message to write
[1:19:59] or not
[1:20:00] we'll wait around to the Rapture time
[1:20:05] see who leaves and who stays
[1:20:12] me
[1:20:13] I'm going to believe because I'm leaving
[1:20:17] [Applause]
[1:20:20] I like that song This Old House I'm
[1:20:22] living in it's needing repair
[1:20:25] and I gotta leave it on my mind
[1:20:30] because he's already prepared another
[1:20:32] house for me it was not made with hands
[1:20:36] I'm telling friends
[1:20:39] there is so many things in this Bible
[1:20:42] that just causes the real True Believer
[1:20:45] to rejoice when they hear it
[1:20:59] verse 13 in whom ye also trusted after
[1:21:02] that you heard the word of Truth The
[1:21:04] Gospel of your salvation in whom also
[1:21:06] after that you believed you were sealed
[1:21:09] with the Holy Spirit of Promise which is
[1:21:11] the earnest of our inheritance
[1:21:16] how do you know how do we know that
[1:21:19] we're going to inherit because he gave
[1:21:21] us the earnest the down payment the
[1:21:24] ceiling of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:28] I'm going to tell you something friends
[1:21:30] God always vindicates his word
[1:21:37] and that is important
[1:21:39] to recognize when God does vindicate
[1:21:42] something
[1:21:48] which is the earnest of our inheritance
[1:21:49] until the Redemption of the purchased
[1:21:51] possession unto the praise of his glory
[1:21:54] I tell you what I'm waiting for the
[1:21:56] Redemption of the purchased possession
[1:21:59] my soul's already in the redeemed state
[1:22:06] but my body isn't
[1:22:09] it and I'm looking
[1:22:11] for that new body
[1:22:16] I'm looking forward to having
[1:22:19] lay off this spirit and have an A
[1:22:21] theophany
[1:22:24] I don't like this human spirit
[1:22:30] oh he gave us a new spirit just like the
[1:22:33] Bible says because Madam said if he
[1:22:36] hadn't you wouldn't be able to get along
[1:22:37] with yourself
[1:22:40] the scripture says he would give us a
[1:22:42] new spirit and he has but it still has
[1:22:45] memory and conscience and reasoning and
[1:22:48] Imagination
[1:22:51] it still has those things
[1:22:53] and that is the area where the devil
[1:22:56] attacks you at
[1:23:02] this word did not come to us by
[1:23:06] reasoning
[1:23:09] neither has the end time message came to
[1:23:11] us through reasoning
[1:23:14] so you're not going to understand it by
[1:23:16] reasoning
[1:23:25] we were talking the other day
[1:23:30] and we were talking about science
[1:23:34] to science they recognize your brain as
[1:23:36] being you
[1:23:39] because it's the control center of the
[1:23:42] body
[1:23:43] so when the brain dies
[1:23:45] they look at that as you dying
[1:23:49] but we know there's a soul
[1:23:54] and that soul is what is you
[1:24:02] now this body of course needs all these
[1:24:04] different other things to function as a
[1:24:07] body here on Earth but who you are is
[1:24:10] that soul
[1:24:12] so when the body is dead the brain is
[1:24:16] dead where are you the soul is gone
[1:24:25] here almost a month ago my mom and I my
[1:24:29] brother
[1:24:30] stood by my dad's bedside
[1:24:33] and they told us the part of his brain
[1:24:35] that causes heart to beat the causes his
[1:24:38] his uh lungs to function and to breathe
[1:24:41] and said that part's gone
[1:24:50] and they said
[1:24:52] when we unplug these machines from him
[1:24:55] everything's going to stop
[1:25:02] we stood there
[1:25:04] they walked out and give us time we
[1:25:06] stood there
[1:25:09] and we
[1:25:11] talked among ourselves
[1:25:13] and said
[1:25:15] he's already gone
[1:25:20] there ain't no sense to keeping the
[1:25:21] machine on him he's already gone
[1:25:24] we can't bring him back
[1:25:28] I I wouldn't have wanted to bring him
[1:25:30] back he wouldn't have wanted to come
[1:25:31] back
[1:25:45] the adoption message brother random says
[1:25:47] what is the Holy Ghost
[1:25:51] now then I'll read the rest of it
[1:25:53] real fast if you'll bear with me much
[1:25:56] where was we at the other night brother
[1:26:00] Mike where they were all happy oh
[1:26:03] everything was peace that was perfect
[1:26:05] love now every time you come this way
[1:26:08] you drop down a little
[1:26:11] drop every time you make a step you come
[1:26:14] inches closer
[1:26:16] when it gets down to the Earth
[1:26:20] he's talking about from the holy ghost
[1:26:22] coming down this way he said you got a
[1:26:24] shadow of the shadow of the shadow of
[1:26:27] Shadows
[1:26:28] now that's how much Holy Ghost you got
[1:26:30] in you
[1:26:33] but you thirst for something
[1:26:37] or I would not
[1:26:41] oh would not people like old people how
[1:26:45] would I like to go back and be 15 again
[1:26:48] or 20.
[1:26:50] well I'd give anything what good would
[1:26:52] it do me
[1:26:54] I might be 15 and yet die tonight it's
[1:26:57] uncertain
[1:26:58] what if he was 15 tonight how do you
[1:27:01] know whether your mother would be living
[1:27:03] when you get home or not
[1:27:05] how do you know you're going to get home
[1:27:07] how do you know you're going to be
[1:27:09] living tomorrow if you're 12 years old
[1:27:11] perfect health
[1:27:13] you may be killed in an accident drop
[1:27:15] dead anything might happen to you
[1:27:17] uncertain there's nothing here certain
[1:27:21] but you long for that what is it
[1:27:24] it's that up there making you long for
[1:27:28] it it's that up there making you long
[1:27:31] for it
[1:27:32] what are we longing for
[1:27:35] we're longing to be changed
[1:27:38] we're longing to meet Jesus
[1:27:41] that's what all this is about
[1:27:55] redemption's one of the oldest things in
[1:27:57] the Bible did you know the Plan of
[1:27:58] Redemption was laid out before the world
[1:28:00] was ever formed think of it
[1:28:02] God foreseen and making a way of
[1:28:05] redemption before he even made the world
[1:28:08] where the Bible plainly says that Christ
[1:28:10] was predestinated for ordained and was
[1:28:13] the Lamb of God slain before the
[1:28:15] foundation of the world is that right
[1:28:17] why before the world was made God had a
[1:28:20] Plan of Redemption
[1:28:23] says in Israel and the church says
[1:28:25] you are saved by grace
[1:28:28] election God's foreknowledge
[1:28:32] predestination
[1:28:33] for ordination
[1:28:36] Paul tells the church in Ephesus that
[1:28:39] God predestinated us in Christ before
[1:28:42] the foundation of the world think of it
[1:28:45] predestinated us in Christ before the
[1:28:47] foundation of world
[1:28:49] what are we worried about then
[1:28:55] get away from worry
[1:28:58] we're just the happiest creatures you
[1:29:00] could ever sing
[1:29:02] my how can you believe that and keep
[1:29:05] from being happy
[1:29:10] we should be happy
[1:29:13] get away from worry see Satan wants you
[1:29:16] to worry well everybody around me boys
[1:29:18] just really having a good time and
[1:29:19] they're all going I wonder if I'm going
[1:29:21] to make it
[1:29:25] right well just let me give you this
[1:29:27] encouragement you're not the only one
[1:29:29] that Satan comes and tells that to
[1:29:35] you you see Satan's a god
[1:29:37] a problem
[1:29:38] he doesn't know who belongs to him or
[1:29:40] not
[1:29:44] he doesn't know who's God's children
[1:29:47] because he don't know who his own
[1:29:49] children are
[1:29:52] Satan doesn't know what people will
[1:29:54] choose he doesn't have foreknowledge
[1:30:00] Satan is
[1:30:04] he is reactive
[1:30:08] he reacts
[1:30:11] to What You Do by what he puts in your
[1:30:15] path
[1:30:23] you could not scientifically dissect an
[1:30:26] individual and find that seed of God
[1:30:32] because it's an invisible seed
[1:30:35] just like God's invisible
[1:30:39] but God became visible through the
[1:30:42] expression of his word in Jesus Christ
[1:30:48] you are the visible manifestation or
[1:30:52] expression of his seed
[1:31:01] God as God made himself visible through
[1:31:03] Jesus Christ so he makes his seed that
[1:31:06] is in you become visible through an
[1:31:09] expression in your life that you are the
[1:31:13] children of God
[1:31:18] God knew what Esau would do
[1:31:22] he knew what Jacob would do God didn't
[1:31:25] push them and he didn't beg them
[1:31:30] either one of them they had a choice
[1:31:36] God doesn't come down and beg his seed
[1:31:38] to conform to his word
[1:31:40] they just conformed to his word because
[1:31:43] they are his seed
[1:31:46] because you are the seed of God
[1:31:50] you see what these services are about
[1:31:53] I'm not trying to actually prove to you
[1:31:56] serpent seed I believe I'm speaking to
[1:31:58] people who already believe it
[1:32:01] but by taking that I'm trying to show
[1:32:03] you predestination and what it is
[1:32:07] and to also show you who you are
[1:32:11] what seed line you're of
[1:32:17] because you see there's two seed lines
[1:32:21] and that's where Satan attacks you many
[1:32:23] times
[1:32:25] trying to tell you you you're not from
[1:32:28] the sea lion of God
[1:32:30] but the expression in your life the
[1:32:33] manifestation of you proves what you are
[1:32:41] not your mistakes
[1:32:45] but remember brother Branham said it
[1:32:48] because God chose you it shows you who
[1:32:52] you are
[1:32:53] why because he knew who you are what you
[1:32:58] would be
[1:32:59] what you would choose God knows his own
[1:33:03] children
[1:33:06] and they know his voice
[1:33:11] and a stranger they will not follow
[1:33:16] there's a lot of strangers out there
[1:33:18] that have got a lot of negative things
[1:33:20] to say
[1:33:21] but I don't care to hear or hear them
[1:33:24] in the days of Jesus there was a lot of
[1:33:27] folks that had negative things to say
[1:33:29] about Jesus but Peter and James and John
[1:33:33] didn't care to hear what they had to say
[1:33:36] [Applause]
[1:33:48] thank you
[1:33:50] not not everybody around him believed
[1:33:53] that he was the son of God
[1:34:06] sends the word across your path
[1:34:10] and you respond to it because you are
[1:34:12] his seed
[1:34:23] just like that story about the eagle
[1:34:27] in the chicken yard
[1:34:29] legally
[1:34:32] and that mother Eagle went flying over
[1:34:35] began to scream
[1:34:40] how many's ever been around chickens
[1:34:46] they scratch and scratch and scratch and
[1:34:48] scratch you know for food
[1:34:50] they pick and they and they make you
[1:34:52] know uh little noises
[1:34:57] but have you ever heard a chicken scream
[1:35:02] nope
[1:35:05] that's not a sound they make
[1:35:09] and so a little eaglet
[1:35:11] he was there
[1:35:13] it sounds he was making
[1:35:15] wasn't matching up with the sounds that
[1:35:17] were around him
[1:35:22] there was something that he couldn't put
[1:35:24] his
[1:35:25] put his foot on why he was different
[1:35:31] but when that eagle flew over and
[1:35:33] screamed
[1:35:37] then he responded back
[1:35:40] why because he was an eagle
[1:35:43] and when he heard the scream of that
[1:35:45] mother Eagle it's something to him
[1:35:47] responded back and he screamed
[1:35:54] the chickens ran for safety
[1:36:05] you know chickens got their
[1:36:08] eyes you know on the sides of their head
[1:36:10] something flies over there
[1:36:17] and they'll scatter
[1:36:19] but not that little eaglet
[1:36:22] there was something in him that
[1:36:23] identified with that
[1:36:25] and when we heard this message there was
[1:36:29] something in us that identified with it
[1:36:34] when we heard the truth of this hour
[1:36:38] now you might have heard
[1:36:40] maybe some other religion before this
[1:36:46] but somehow you just couldn't fit in
[1:36:51] there was something different
[1:36:53] you long for more than what the rest
[1:36:56] were satisfied with
[1:37:00] he wanted something more than that
[1:37:05] Hallelujah
[1:37:13] Duncan say I know what my sons and
[1:37:17] daughters will do how they'll Act
[1:37:19] what kind of men and women they'll be
[1:37:22] because they are my children
[1:37:32] for knowledge before man fell
[1:37:36] what we just read before man fell God
[1:37:39] had already made a way of redemption
[1:37:42] God is not in modern terms God is not
[1:37:47] reactive he's proactive
[1:37:52] amen
[1:37:55] we got nothing to be worried about
[1:37:58] am I going to make the Rapture certainly
