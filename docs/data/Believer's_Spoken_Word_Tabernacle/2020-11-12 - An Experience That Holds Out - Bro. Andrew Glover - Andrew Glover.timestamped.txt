[27:24] direction you take the message of the
[27:25] hour away from us you take discernment
[27:27] away
[27:28] right because the message of the hour is
[27:30] not books and tapes it's the person of
[27:32] Jesus Christ
[27:33] revealed and that's what brings
[27:35] discernment in this hour of where we are
[27:38] who we are where we're going it gives
[27:40] focus and gives direction to us in this

[34:34] John 4 and: 15 how many's familiar here
[34:37] with this story you know this Jesus has
[34:39] just come through and he's met the woman
[34:41] here at the well and in St John the 4th

[34:49] that I thirst not neither come hither to
[34:52] draw and Jesus saith unto her go call
[34:55] thy husband and come hither

[35:00] no husband and Jesus said unto her thou
[35:03] Hast well said I have no husband for
[35:05] thou has had five husbands and he whom
[35:07] thou now Hast is not thy husband in thou
[35:10] sest thou truly and the woman Sith unto

[35:15] prophet now I love this I perceive that
[35:19] thou art a prophet for our fathers
[35:21] worshiped in this mountain and you say
[35:22] that in Jerusalem is a place where men
[35:25] ought to worship and Jesus saith to
[35:28] Heroman believe me the hour cometh when
[35:31] you shall neither in this mountain nor
[35:32] yet at Jerusalem worship the father for
[35:35] ye worship but you know not what we know
[35:37] that we worship for salvation is of the
[35:39] Jews but the hour cometh I love how the
[35:42] Bible will say the hour cometh but then
[35:44] he'll say the hour cometh but now is
[35:47] amen when the true worshippers how many
[35:49] true worshippers do we have here tonight
[35:51] when the true worshippers shall worship
[35:53] the father in spirit and in truth for
[35:56] the father seeketh such to worship him
[35:59] for God is a spirit and they that
[36:01] worship Him must somebody say must must
[36:04] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[36:08] and the woman saith unto him now notice
[36:10] here what she says I know how many how
[36:13] many knows him tonight she says I know
[36:16] that the Messiah cometh which is called
[36:19] Christ and when he has come he will tell
[36:21] us all things and Jesus sath unto her I
[36:24] am he I that speak unto thee am he and
[36:28] upon this came his disciples and
[36:29] marveled that talked with the woman he
[36:31] talked with the woman yet no man said
[36:33] what seekest thou or why talkest thou
[36:35] with her and the woman then left her
[36:37] water pot and went her way into the City
[36:40] and saith unto the men come see a man
[36:43] which told me all things I ever did is
[36:46] not this the Christ then they went out
[36:48] of the city and came unto him and one
[36:51] other place 1 Corinthians the 12th
[36:53] chapter just one verse there 1
[36:56] Corinthians the 12th chapter
[36:58] and I want to read the third verse how
[37:00] many tonight here still believes the
[37:01] Holy Ghost is fallen in this age he
[37:03] still filling lives amen 1 Corinthians
[37:06] 12 and ver3 Paul here writing says
[37:09] wherefore I give unto you to understand
[37:11] that no man speaking now notice how he's
[37:14] speaking by the spirit of God calleth
[37:17] Jesus a curse so you can't have the Holy
[37:19] Ghost and then curse the word it's not
[37:21] possible but Paul then turns and says
[37:24] and no man can say that Jesus is the
[37:27] Lord but by the Holy Ghost can I say it
[37:30] this way no man can say the message is
[37:32] the truth but by the Holy Ghost we ask
[37:35] the Lord this evening to bless the
[37:37] reading of his word as you may have your
[37:39] seats with us this afternoon I want to
[37:41] by the help of the Lord to speak to you
[37:43] here for a few moments and if the Lord
[37:44] would help me maybe just to title this
[37:46] tonight a very as I said a very simple
[37:49] thought but just to speak to you on an
[37:51] experience that holds out an experience
[37:54] that holds out and I we just had a youth
[37:56] service there at home on Friday night at
[37:58] our church and I was ministering there
[38:00] and been praying and seeking something
[38:01] from the Lord for that service and God
[38:04] began to deal with my heart on the word
[38:05] experience just how that everyone needs
[38:08] an experience and I think that many
[38:10] times uh we preach to our young people
[38:12] you need an experience we tell our
[38:14] children we tell it over and over at
[38:15] youth camps and different meetings you
[38:17] need an experience and and that is very
[38:19] true every every every young person
[38:21] needs an experience in the Holy Ghost
[38:23] but uh the more I begin to read and
[38:25] begin to study and begin to think on
[38:27] this we've got a lot of young people
[38:29] hearing that they need an experience but
[38:31] we've got a lot of adults that don't
[38:32] even have an experience and I I think
[38:34] it's a sad thing to see so many people
[38:36] falling away I think it's sad to see
[38:39] people throwing in the towel I think
[38:40] it's devastating to see people just
[38:42] giving up and amen just growing weary
[38:44] and they're all simply walking away from
[38:46] the message of the hour and I'll tell
[38:48] you it's not because they don't know the
[38:50] quote it's not because they haven't been
[38:51] in meetings it's not because they've not
[38:53] been in church but it's simply because
[38:55] they've never met the God of this
[38:57] message they've never had amen an
[38:59] experience with Jesus Christ it all gos
[39:02] down to they never had an experience now
[39:04] the prophet says this at cadis Baria
[39:06] what we need today is a good old time St
[39:09] Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost
[39:12] back into the church again there's so
[39:13] much of this wishy-washy amen carrying
[39:16] on in the name of Christianity taken
[39:18] away he said so much denomination so
[39:20] much theology so much education he said
[39:23] people don't walk anyhow as crippled as
[39:25] the church is here it is as crippled as
[39:27] the church is education's not your
[39:29] crutch he said your faith is your crutch
[39:32] amen that's right education will never
[39:35] do it denomination will never do it he
[39:37] said there'll never be an organization
[39:40] ever substitute The Upper Room
[39:43] experience amen there'll never be a
[39:45] school that'll ever take the place of
[39:47] Pentecost it can't be amen not by power
[39:49] not by might but by my spirit sayith the
[39:52] Lord that's what we need today is back
[39:54] to the Bible experience amen Christians
[39:57] are born again that are washed in the
[39:59] blood of the Lamb that are made white
[40:01] and they are regenerated twice born what
[40:04] the world needs today is a Revival
[40:06] oldtime Revival the kind that St Paul
[40:09] had in about .66 now I don't think the
[40:12] prophet of God was wasting his breath to
[40:14] describe amen what the Apostle Paul had
[40:16] I don't think he was wasting his time
[40:18] Amen to say we need to go back to that
[40:20] and I think the reason why amen that he
[40:22] was preaching so hard to get back to
[40:24] that amen is because that was the only
[40:26] thing that it will keep you in the hour
[40:29] in which you're living let me just say
[40:30] this an education amen of this message
[40:33] will not sustain you the education amen
[40:35] of just knowing that God sent a prophet
[40:37] is not going to sustain you amen but an
[40:40] experience amen amen to come into the
[40:42] presence of the Living God Amen and not
[40:45] just meet him because your mama told you
[40:47] about him not just meet him amen because
[40:49] the preacher preaches about him but to
[40:51] really meet him amen and know him for
[40:53] yourself and I think tonight what it's
[40:56] time to do is it's time to take
[40:58] inventory of our own experience the
[40:59] prophet says this if he sends the thing
[41:02] it's up to the people to receive it or
[41:04] to reject it and each one as individual
[41:06] he says not because of your church
[41:08] standing but as an individual it doesn't
[41:10] lay within whether your church accepts
[41:12] it amen it's whether you accept it then
[41:14] to think tonight amen that you could be
[41:16] here tonight and you could be Desiring a
[41:18] Revival you could be Desiring something
[41:20] from God and the entire church not even
[41:23] be involved in the entire church not
[41:24] even want it amen do you realize you
[41:26] could be here tonight needing something
[41:28] from God and everybody in this building
[41:31] be doubting it and don't believe it can
[41:32] happen amen but if you've got the faith
[41:35] that it'll happen amen God will bypass
[41:37] every unbeliever he will bypass every
[41:40] skeptic he will bypass every critic he
[41:42] will go around every devil trying to
[41:44] stop you amen from receiving what God
[41:47] has got for you he'll go around that
[41:49] because this is not a church experience
[41:51] amen this is an individual experience
[41:54] and to say tonight amen we've got to
[41:56] move Beyond well the church is in
[41:57] Revival then I'll be in Revival well
[41:59] well my favorite preacher is in Revival
[42:01] so I'll be in Revival we got a movie on
[42:04] that tonight church and it's got to come
[42:06] that if nobody in this church is in
[42:08] Revival you're in Revival if nobody is
[42:10] praising God Amen you're praising God if
[42:13] nobody is rejoicing amen you are
[42:15] rejoicing amen because this is not amen
[42:18] a group amen this is an individual amen
[42:21] that has accepted what God has
[42:23] s amen salvation is not a group effort
[42:27] salvation is a personal work it is a
[42:29] personal faith the prophet says it is a
[42:31] personal faith amen I love this it's a
[42:34] personal faith in the Lord Jesus no
[42:36] matter if father don't believe if Mother
[42:38] don't believe it's what you believe see
[42:40] and notice when they did receive it then
[42:42] great signs and wonders in Jubilee broke
[42:45] out but when they rejected it then dark
[42:47] gross darkness and grossness came upon
[42:49] the people and the people of this last
[42:51] day can't you see why gross darkness is
[42:53] falling on this country amen the gospel
[42:56] of Christ has been rejected he said you
[42:59] don't want to believe that but it's a
[43:00] noted fact it's the truth it's too bad
[43:03] but it's the truth and I think that if
[43:04] that be the case that each one of us
[43:07] should take inventory of our own
[43:09] experience and our own standings with
[43:12] God and see how we stand in his side
[43:15] amen then we don't come to church amen
[43:17] to see how we stand in the pastor's side
[43:19] amen we don't come to church to see how
[43:21] we stand amen amen in the Deacon S but
[43:23] we come to church for one purpose amen
[43:26] and that is to see how am I standing in
[43:28] the sight of God Amen because his
[43:31] opinion is the only opinion that matters
[43:34] amen his thoughts are the only thoughts
[43:36] that matters amen is in the presence of
[43:38] God Amen now you think of this word
[43:40] experience the Bible says amen that that
[43:42] that there's got to be a baptism of the
[43:44] Holy Ghost and you've got to have an
[43:46] experience amen with more than the Bible
[43:48] amen with more than a book with more
[43:50] than a taper even a picture you've got
[43:52] to have an experience with the Holy
[43:55] Ghost now when you look at this word
[43:58] experience the word experience means
[44:00] practical contact they meant with obser
[44:03] with an observation of facts or event it
[44:06] is an event or An Occurrence that leaves
[44:08] an impression on someone amen an
[44:11] encounter or undergo an event An
[44:13] Occurrence it means to feel an emotion
[44:16] amen now let me say the way a prophet
[44:17] said anything without emotion is dead
[44:20] amen you need to bury it if you cannot
[44:22] feel it amen then it's dead and I'll
[44:24] tell you what the prophet said he said
[44:26] then the greatest power in the world
[44:28] what is the greatest power in the world
[44:30] he says I find this it's the greatest
[44:32] power not the atomic bomb but a believer
[44:35] in contact with his maker or can I say a
[44:38] Believer amen who has had an experience
[44:41] amen with the God that he is claiming to
[44:43] serve it changes the whole attitude it
[44:46] changes his mental it changes his habit
[44:50] it changes his body it changes his
[44:52] nature it changes everything amen then
[44:56] we've all come to a place that we've
[44:57] said how is this going to change amen
[44:59] how are we going to work this out and a
[45:01] prophet comes along and says just get an
[45:03] experience amen amen you say well my
[45:05] child's got a bad attitude I've got the
[45:08] remedy tonight it's not Dr Dobson it's
[45:10] an experience of the Holy Ghost well my
[45:13] son's got a rebellious Spirit on him
[45:15] I've got the answer amen he needs an
[45:17] experience with the Holy Ghost well
[45:19] brother Andrew I don't get nothing out
[45:20] of church I've got your answer tonight
[45:22] you need an experience with the Holy
[45:24] Ghost well brother Andrew I can't stay
[45:26] awake and Church you need an experience
[45:28] with the Holy Ghost brother Andrew I've
[45:30] heard these quotes So they B me to death
[45:32] what you need is an experience with the
[45:34] Holy Ghost until the same fire amen that
[45:37] fill the upper room amen comes into your
[45:40] hearts and fills your fibers and fills
[45:42] your being with reality not religion
[45:45] amen reality I'll just go ahead and
[45:47] preach here for a minute we don't need
[45:49] religion we need
[45:52] reality we need something that'll change
[45:54] us amen Religion Don't Change us
[45:57] religion binds us amen religion doesn't
[45:59] break free amen religion puts more
[46:01] pressure Upon Us amen but there's one
[46:03] thing amen that'll break you free out of
[46:06] whatever you're in and that is the
[46:07] reality of knowing Jesus Christ amen I
[46:11] love the book of Hebrews don't you amen
[46:13] I love to go read there in the book of
[46:14] Hebrews chapter 11 how that there are so
[46:16] many Heroes of Faith amen there's a man
[46:19] there named Abraham there's a name a man
[46:21] named Moses there's a man amen named
[46:24] Samson there's a there's a woman there
[46:26] named Ruth there's a woman named Rahab
[46:28] there's a man named Enoch there's all
[46:30] kinds of names in there amen but do you
[46:32] realize how they all got there amen they
[46:34] got there because they everyone had an
[46:37] experience amen now let me say it was
[46:40] not any kind of experience it was an
[46:42] enduring experience the Bible says in
[46:45] Hebrews 11:27 by faith he forsook Egypt
[46:48] amen not fearing the Wrath of the king
[46:51] for he endured somebody shout endured
[46:54] amen he endured I seeing him who is
[46:57] invisible amen then before Abraham amen
[47:00] could have went through anything before
[47:02] Moses could have went through anything
[47:04] they had to meet the invisible God Amen
[47:07] and by seeing the invisible God Amen it
[47:09] released the power to them that no
[47:11] matter what came in the visible Rim they
[47:14] had done tapped in The Invisible rim and
[47:16] they were not drawing from the visible
[47:19] they were drawing from the invisible
[47:21] then that's why Sarah's womb could be
[47:23] dead and her milk veins dried up amen
[47:25] but Abraham stand and say we're going to
[47:28] have a child amen that's why Moses amen
[47:31] could be offered the pedestal Amen to be
[47:33] under the king Pharaoh amen but he could
[47:35] stand there and deny the riches of Egypt
[47:37] and suffer the reproach for Christ
[47:39] because he was looking in the invisible
[47:42] real see what happened amen when they
[47:44] met the invisible God they received an
[47:46] experience and it was not a temporary
[47:49] experience it was an enduring experience
[47:51] and I say tonight that same God Amen
[47:54] that met Moses and met Abraham as come
[47:57] down in this building tonight and for
[47:59] the first time Amen in 2,000 years I can
[48:02] announce to you that the Mighty God the
[48:05] invisible God has been unveiled and you
[48:08] can see him face to face
[48:12] tonight oh brother when you see him then
[48:15] it don't matter if you see cancer you've
[48:17] done seen him when you see him you can
[48:20] see depression but that don't shake you
[48:22] because you've done seen him oh I want
[48:26] to see him amen the look upon his face
[48:29] oh I want to see him amen not just to a
[48:32] book I want to see him in
[48:34] reality when that word endure there is
[48:37] used it means to be steadfast it means
[48:40] how that Abraham the prophet said after
[48:42] he endured amen is seeing him who was
[48:44] invisible how after he met God and had
[48:47] an
[48:49] experience of talking face to face with
[48:52] God he could call those things which
[48:55] were not as though they were for he had
[48:57] an experience he had talked to God face
[49:00] to face and that's what we need is a
[49:03] personal experience with the Living God
[49:06] an experience you say brother it's
[49:08] really hard serving God Amen can I tell
[49:11] you what'll make it easier an experience
[49:13] Amen brother Ander it's hard amen living

[49:27] shouting I get so mad because they're
[49:29] taking up my time and I want to go home
[49:31] no you just need an experience amen
[49:34] because if a man ever gets an experience
[49:36] of alcohol amen nobody has to beg him
[49:39] Amen to drink but he's got a taste of it
[49:42] and he wants more of it and I say
[49:44] tonight you take a man woman boy and
[49:46] girl and get them in the presence of the
[49:48] Living God for five minutes and let them
[49:51] get a taste amen of more than just a

[49:55] and fighting and AR but let him get a
[49:57] taste amen of the ever of the ever

[50:41] amen the prop said this way the need of
[50:43] today is an experience with God that's
[50:46] what the church needs tonight is just
[50:48] stop studying so much Theology and get
[50:51] down to the altar amen there's the first
[50:54] problem is we took the altar out of the
[50:56] church and we put a bunch of psychology
[50:58] in his place we took the altars out of
[51:00] the church and we decorated like Cain
[51:03] amen but a prophet should clean the
[51:04] altar off it wasn't made for for for
[51:07] pumpkins it wasn't made for watermelons
[51:10] it wasn't made for apples it was made
[51:12] for humans Amen to lay their will and
[51:15] let the all consuming fire of the Holy
[51:17] Ghost come down upon that Altar and
[51:20] consume it until their thoughts are gone
[51:22] till their motives are gone till their
[51:24] agendas are gone and God has complete
[51:27] control of that individual by an
[51:29] experience amen pray amen Get Down The
[51:32] Altar and pray until a personal

[51:41] prayer meeting and four people shows up
[51:43] but you announce all day meeting and
[51:45] dinner on the ground and you got to put
[51:46] chairs out you know why because we've
[51:48] lost our experience amen we're more
[51:51] consumed amen with getting together and
[51:53] talking and joking amen but come on

[52:43] dness and gives a new vision where there
[52:48] is no vision the people perish where
[52:52] there is no Direction where there is no
[52:54] leadership where there is no future goal
[52:57] where there is nothing that the people
[52:59] can put their eyes on and say I'll fight
[53:01] till I get it I'll work till I get it
[53:03] amen where there's none of that and the
[53:05] people settle down and they become a
[53:07] bunch of hot bed plants amen but I

[54:56] prophecies the Bible says Jesus himself
[54:59] this people's heart is wax gross their
[55:02] ears are dull of hearing their eyes they
[55:04] have closed lest at any time they should
[55:06] see with their eyes and they should hear
[55:08] with their ears and should understand
[55:09] with their heart and should be converted
[55:12] and I should heal them amen the prophet

[1:12:57] a young 9-year-old boy I gave my heart
[1:12:59] to the Lord Jesus Christ I was baptized
[1:13:02] in water in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:13:04] Christ but there was something more I
[1:13:06] wanted than just to stand before the
[1:13:08] church and be baptized in water I wanted
[1:13:11] the Holy Ghost amen can I preach I know
[1:13:14] this is simple amen but I wanted the
[1:13:16] Holy Ghost I wanted it so bad I prayed

[1:13:37] he said don't you let nothing stop you
[1:13:39] until you get it you know what I wanted

[1:13:45] heard what other people said the Holy
[1:13:47] Ghost could do for you amen I could tell
[1:13:49] what it did for them amen but I wanted
[1:13:51] to be able to stand up and say if it did

[1:14:07] never been in a fast prayer line just
[1:14:09] always went up for prayer so I had in my
[1:14:12] mind when you go up you stop the
[1:14:15] preacher and you tell him what you want
[1:14:17] you say and brother Tim prudy was at the
[1:14:18] head of that prayer line that night so
[1:14:20] in my mind I got lyed to go in the
[1:14:21] prayer line and I was going to stop
[1:14:23] there and I was going to say brother Tim
[1:14:25] I want the Holy Ghost I've been baptized
[1:14:27] I want to receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:14:29] but before I can even open my mouth I
[1:14:31] never will forget it amen I sit in my
[1:14:33] office at the day stud this and it just
[1:14:35] came back to me as clear as I was
[1:14:36] sitting there looking at the wall amen I
[1:14:38] never forget it before I could even say
[1:14:40] I want the Holy Ghost brother Tim took
[1:14:42] his hand amen and he reached up he says
[1:14:45] we're the long and short of
[1:14:46] it but but he reached up there and he
[1:14:49] laid his hand on me and I never forget
[1:14:51] these words he said God give him the
[1:14:53] Holy Ghost I didn't tell him what I
[1:14:56] wanted I didn't tell him I wanted it so
[1:14:58] bad that I was wanting the Holy Ghost
[1:15:00] more than I wanted the next meal I was
[1:15:02] wanting the Holy Ghost more than
[1:15:03] anything but but God knew what I wanted
[1:15:06] amen and God had a witness there amen
[1:15:08] that knew the god that met me met him
[1:15:11] and if he give him the Holy Ghost he
[1:15:13] could give me the Holy Ghost and brother
[1:15:14] Brian when he laid his hands on me he
[1:15:16] said God give him the Holy Ghost brother
[1:15:19] I don't remember nothing for about 2 and
[1:15:20] 1/2 hours amen about 2 and 1/ half hours
[1:15:23] later I woke up over in the prayer room
[1:15:25] when I looked down there was snot there
[1:15:27] was a puddle of tears I was a wreck amen
[1:15:29] I was ringing wet amen but you know what
[1:15:32] I got up and when I got up Sister
[1:15:34] Browning I had something more than I had
[1:15:36] when I went down and I say tonight amen
[1:15:39] when I met God there little did I know I
[1:15:41] would stand before Giants and they would
[1:15:43] say the the Holy Ghost don't move no
[1:15:45] more and we need Psychology I little did
[1:15:48] I know I would stand amen before
[1:15:50] preachers and they would say you can't
[1:15:52] preach the seventh seal you can't preach
[1:15:54] the third pole the third pull is not the
[1:15:56] power of the Holy Ghost back in the
[1:15:57] church amen but I met God Amen and what
[1:16:00] they said didn't matter amen because I
[1:16:03] knew amen the god I met have called me
[1:16:05] to preach it and I say tonight church
[1:16:08] that same God is in this building
[1:16:12] tonight you know what I didn't get an
[1:16:14] experience sister Browning that I had to
[1:16:16] hold amen I got an experience that's
[1:16:19] been holding
[1:16:21] me H can we let our hair down and preach
[1:16:24] for a minute I got an experience that's
[1:16:27] held me it held me through hurts it held
[1:16:29] me through disappointments it held me
[1:16:31] through family troubles it help me amen
[1:16:34] through kids making fun of you in public
[1:16:36] school the god I met made me a promise
[1:16:39] I'll never leave you I'll never forsake
[1:16:42] you the battle is not yours it belongs
[1:16:45] to the
[1:16:48] Lord
[1:16:49] hallelujah I got more than just an
[1:16:51] experience I got a word experience amen
[1:16:55] and you know what it made me a witness
[1:16:57] amen made me a witness you said brother
[1:17:00] what are you talking about I'm talking
[1:17:02] about a witness not not not just a
[1:17:04] church witness an eye witness right a
[1:17:08] ear witness and then the Bible says I
[1:17:10] have heard of thee by the hearing of the
[1:17:12] a but now mine eyes seeth thee amen
[1:17:16] hallelujah Witnesses therefore no man
[1:17:19] can exactly witness to the resurrection
[1:17:21] of Christ only by the Holy Ghost see
[1:17:24] here's what's hurting this more than
[1:17:25] ever is people who are professing to be
[1:17:28] Christians and not living like it the
[1:17:31] thing is see they're not a correct
[1:17:33] witness they cannot witness until they
[1:17:35] have an experience amen when Jesus said
[1:17:38] out his disciples he said you got to
[1:17:40] have the correct experience because in
[1:17:42] their Journey amen am I holding too long
[1:17:45] in their Journey they were going to meet
[1:17:47] things they were going to they were
[1:17:48] going to have days when if they didn't
[1:17:50] have an experience they would Blow Away
[1:17:52] With The Wind that was blowing against
[1:17:54] them they were going to have times amen
[1:17:56] when they would come up against
[1:17:57] something and they were not going to
[1:17:58] know how to get over it they were not
[1:18:00] going to know how to get around it or
[1:18:01] get under it amen but the god they met
[1:18:04] amen was going to come down again and
[1:18:06] renew their memory refresh their memory
[1:18:08] of the experience that he gave them
[1:18:09] years ago and they would stand there and
[1:18:12] say God if when everything was against
[1:18:14] me you could take me a sinner and you
[1:18:17] could turn my life around you could set
[1:18:19] my feet on straight streets you could
[1:18:21] put me on Hallelujah Avenue if you could
[1:18:24] do that then what is this mountain to
[1:18:28] you see why are you still sitting here
[1:18:30] tonight with a testimony is because you
[1:18:33] had an experience anybody ever faced the
[1:18:36] mountain anybody ever faced a wall how
[1:18:38] am I going to get over it amen but you
[1:18:40] had an experience see you was a
[1:18:43] Christian but the power was not you were
[1:18:45] just claiming to be a Christian the
[1:18:47] power was you had the Holy Ghost see the
[1:18:50] Bible says wherefore I give you an
[1:18:52] understand that no man speaking by the
[1:18:54] spirit of God Called Jesus a cursed yeah
[1:18:57] and no man can say that Jesus is the
[1:19:00] Lord but by the Holy Ghost no man can
[1:19:05] say Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy
[1:19:08] Ghost and brother every time a man that
[1:19:10] professes to be a Christian sometime or
[1:19:13] other you've got to show what you're
[1:19:16] made out of see it's not enough just to
[1:19:18] stand up and say I'm a Christian but
[1:19:20] there's going to come a time you're
[1:19:22] going to have to stand there and so it's
[1:19:24] not a bunch of talk I actually have what
[1:19:27] I'm saying I am Hallelujah the prophet
[1:19:30] gives us this illustration he said Tommy
[1:19:33] Osburn saw that Maniac there in those
[1:19:35] meetings said he saw him come up there
[1:19:36] and challenge the Holy Ghost said he
[1:19:38] fell across my feet brother said Tommy
[1:19:41] come to me said brother Brandon what can
[1:19:43] I do I said now Tommy don't profess
[1:19:45] anything that you can't back up the
[1:19:48] devil's going to call your hand on it
[1:19:49] yes he will and he will do it right away
[1:19:51] I said then if you can't back it up you
[1:19:54] know what come it'll be a reproach so
[1:19:56] just be sure that you make your
[1:19:58] statement another place he says oh my be
[1:20:01] sure that down in your heart that God
[1:20:03] has separated you from the things of the
[1:20:06] world this is an experience and made you
[1:20:08] a new creature then go tell people
[1:20:11] you're a Christian he said you think I
[1:20:13] think today we bury too many people
[1:20:15] alive he said you bury them after
[1:20:17] they're dead is that right yes sir
[1:20:19] listen brother a man that's dead won't
[1:20:21] argue with you that's right amen I got
[1:20:23] to keep on hurrying am amen a man that's
[1:20:25] dead won't argue with you you can say
[1:20:27] anything to him you can want to you can
[1:20:29] call him all kinds of names he won't say
[1:20:30] a word why he's dead am then we find
[1:20:33] that there are people today with two
[1:20:34] different kinds of experiences amen the
[1:20:37] Bible amen the prophet shows us that
[1:20:39] there is a natural experience right amen
[1:20:42] but then there is a spiritual experience
[1:20:44] which is a supernatural experience now a
[1:20:48] natural experience is not
[1:20:51] enough it will not hold
[1:20:55] out it will not hold you see we have too
[1:20:59] many people amen that just have got a
[1:21:01] natural experience you say beler what is
[1:21:03] a natural experience a natural
[1:21:05] experience is a church experience right
[1:21:08] right now the Bible says in Luke 5:37 no
[1:21:11] man put the new wine into Old bottles
[1:21:13] else the new wine will burst the bottles
[1:21:15] and be spilled and the bottles Shall
[1:21:17] Perish brother said see I see now what
[1:21:19] Jesus meant the way you take the baptism
[1:21:22] of the Holy Ghost and put it in an old
[1:21:24] dry formal
[1:21:28] cide it'll blow up as sure as the world
[1:21:33] it'll just it'll just blow up you you
[1:21:35] just can't have it like that you try to
[1:21:37] take the baptism of the Holy Ghost with
[1:21:39] an old experience of some long drawn out
[1:21:43] Church experience it'll blow up as sure
[1:21:46] as the world he said but you take new
[1:21:48] wine amen and new bottles he said the
[1:21:51] new bottles has still the or the the new
[1:21:53] bottles still has the all in the Skins
[1:21:56] but it's flexible that's the way God's
[1:21:58] Church must be for Revival it must be
[1:22:01] flexible right amen amen if I could
[1:22:04] tonight can I give you an example of a
[1:22:06] church experience can I give you one the
[1:22:08] Rich Young Ruler the problem of God said
[1:22:11] this now the young man knew there was
[1:22:13] something that he was lacking though we
[1:22:15] said he's thoroughly understand amen
[1:22:17] though we amen he must have had a good
[1:22:19] father he had a good father he had a
[1:22:21] good mother and a church experience
[1:22:24] brother brother Brown he had three
[1:22:25] things amen that were good things but
[1:22:27] that waser enough
[1:22:29] right he belonged to the church because
[1:22:32] Jesus asked him keep the Commandments on
[1:22:34] the father mother do God kills commit
[1:22:35] adultery all these morals the church
[1:22:37] teaches amen but yet one thing thou
[1:22:39] lackest yet being a member of a
[1:22:42] religious body he he was a member of a
[1:22:45] Rel he was fulfilling the scripture
[1:22:47] forsake not the assembling of your he
[1:22:49] was doing that he was a part of a
[1:22:51] religious body but yet the young man was
[1:22:53] sensible enough to know he lacked
[1:22:56] eternal
[1:22:58] life he lacked amen knowing Christ in a
[1:23:02] personal experience amen can I can I can
[1:23:04] I take a few minutes here and we'll
[1:23:06] close amen a personal experience must be
[1:23:09] a supernatural
[1:23:12] experience can you say Amen it must be
[1:23:15] somebody say must it's essential it must
[1:23:18] be a supernatural experience it must be
[1:23:22] more than shaking a preacher's hand it
[1:23:25] must be more than a trip to Youth Camp
[1:23:27] it must be more than your favorite
[1:23:29] preacher coming through and getting you
[1:23:31] all excited it must be more than just
[1:23:34] saying mom is a Sunday school teacher
[1:23:36] and daddy is a deacon and Samuel
[1:23:38] Browning is my pastor and I'm best
[1:23:40] friends with a oh no church it's got to
[1:23:43] be something amen that is so real to
[1:23:47] you I don't think we need this kind of
[1:23:49] preacher well let me just tell you what
[1:23:50] I think I think we need more of it I
[1:23:53] think we need more people amen coming to
[1:23:55] know God in the power of his
[1:23:57] resurrection well brother Andrew I don't
[1:23:59] know if anything's going to hold me I'll
[1:24:00] just share this with you today I was
[1:24:02] traveling up the road today and brother
[1:24:03] Homer Longoria called amen anybody knows
[1:24:05] Homer he's a
[1:24:07] nut I told Brother Homer one time I said
[1:24:09] I think sometimes I come down here to
[1:24:11] preach but actually I leave here blessed
[1:24:13] more than the church does he said what
[1:24:14] do you mean I said cuz I come here with
[1:24:15] a heavy spirit amen but I'm around you
[1:24:17] about two minutes and it's all
[1:24:19] gone but he he called me there and he
[1:24:22] began talking he was say he was say
[1:24:23] brother that what what do you think
[1:24:25] about this we we just begin talking
[1:24:26] about things you know amen he's talking
[1:24:28] about he said but then what about people
[1:24:29] now amen leaving the message and going
[1:24:31] after some gift he said brother Andrew
[1:24:34] what do you think about that and I said
[1:24:35] brother Homer I think it's because
[1:24:36] theyve never had an experience amen
[1:24:38] because if you ever meet The Giver amen
[1:24:40] then there ain't a gift real enough to
[1:24:41] take you away from what the giver was
[1:24:43] sent to
[1:24:45] vindicate I said it I meant it I stand
[1:24:48] behind it and I represent it amen if you
[1:24:50] ever meet The Giver amen a gift will not
[1:24:53] take you away from personal experience
[1:24:56] with a giver he said brother I've seen
[1:24:57] so much I said brother Homer it it it it
[1:25:00] burdens my heart to see all the things
[1:25:02] going on he said brother Andrew what
[1:25:03] about me he said I've been in there 50
[1:25:05] years he said but you know what I still
[1:25:07] believe this message I thought is't that
[1:25:09] a testimony here's a man he said it used
[1:25:11] to be he said one had a he said in
[1:25:13] Paul's day he said one had a song one
[1:25:16] had a gift one had a tongue one had a
[1:25:18] prophecy he said Andrew I done come
[1:25:20] through that he said now one's got a
[1:25:22] tent one's got a thunder one's got a t
[1:25:24] Ministry one's got to this one I said
[1:25:26] brother Homer what kept you he said
[1:25:28] because I knew when I heard that
[1:25:31] message he said I knew when I heard that
[1:25:34] message I heard a certain sound and I
[1:25:37] tell you what kept him is because he
[1:25:39] meant more than just in a sensation he
[1:25:41] met more than just an emotion amen but
[1:25:44] he met the god that William Brandon was
[1:25:46] sent to introduce the church too and I
[1:25:49] say tonight friends amen young people
[1:25:51] listen to me I pray this thing is over
[1:25:53] today I pray we take a Rapture but I am
[1:25:56] so convinced if God carries his coming
[1:25:58] 50 more years there is going to be a
[1:26:00] group of people that still going to be
[1:26:02] preaching this
[1:26:07] message how can you say that because
[1:26:10] there's a people here that knows him the
[1:26:13] Bible said that I Paul says I may know
[1:26:14] somebody say no no I may know him in the
[1:26:19] power of his resurrection there is a
[1:26:22] people here today that knows
[1:26:26] him and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:26:29] and they have been made conformable unto
[1:26:32] his death amen have we have we been
[1:26:34] using that word a little bit no oh no to
[1:26:37] know to know something look at what this
[1:26:40] word no means it means to perceive it
[1:26:42] means to understand now now there was
[1:26:44] two groups of people there was the
[1:26:46] Greeks and then there was the Jews now
[1:26:48] notice here to the Greeks this meant to
[1:26:51] know facts amen but the facts may or may
[1:26:54] not affect one's conduct so in other
[1:26:56] words they could know the message but
[1:26:58] they still had a television in their
[1:27:00] house testing one two testing one two
[1:27:04] it's still
[1:27:05] working what can we preach amen well
[1:27:08] well they know the message but they
[1:27:10] ain't overcome amen they know the quotes
[1:27:13] but they still they still can't agree
[1:27:14] with the prophets teaching on
[1:27:15] predestination oh but they know the
[1:27:17] message amen won't you just tell the
[1:27:19] truth you don't know it right
[1:27:22] amen amen true because to the Jews true
[1:27:26] knowledge always manifested itself in
[1:27:30] one's conduct see one did not know
[1:27:33] something until the fact had a practical
[1:27:36] outworking in his life amen can I tell
[1:27:39] you why somebody asked me one time they
[1:27:41] said brother Ander why do you preach
[1:27:42] amen so strong about the third pull I
[1:27:44] said because as a 15year old boy I heard
[1:27:47] a prophet say in the sures inst time he
[1:27:50] said is this that seventh seal is this
[1:27:52] that seventh Angels message he said is
[1:27:55] this that third pull he said that will
[1:27:57] draw and bring the power of God back in
[1:28:00] the church he said you draw your own
[1:28:02] conclusion then I heard him say that and
[1:28:05] you know what it told me if I said it
[1:28:07] wasn't then it were going to be a
[1:28:08] powerless day but if I said it was the
[1:28:10] power it was going to bring a power back
[1:28:12] in my life and today because I'm sitting
[1:28:15] under an open book I've Got The Power of
[1:28:18] the Holy Ghost living on the inside of
[1:28:20] me come on church I think it's time we
[1:28:23] come to a place that if nobody heard you
[1:28:25] open your mouth they knew you believe
[1:28:27] this
[1:28:31] message if nobody knew you went to this
[1:28:34] crazy Church on the side of the road
[1:28:36] that follows a dead man if nobody knew
[1:28:38] that they knew something was different
[1:28:41] about
[1:28:42] you why because what's being preached is
[1:28:45] coming into your soul and it's having a
[1:28:47] practical outworking in your
[1:28:51] life amen I got to close here I'll
[1:28:54] preach all night but my Prophet said
[1:28:56] Moses you know was called a man of God a
[1:28:58] prophet while he was being called being
[1:28:59] a prophet he had to have a supernatural
[1:29:01] exp spirit amen so no man has a right to
[1:29:05] call himself thus until he's talked face
[1:29:08] to face with God
[1:29:10] right on the back side of the desert
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:17] hallelujah bless him
[1:29:20] Lord
[1:29:22] somewhere where he met
[1:29:24] God
[1:29:26] himself yes direct quote and all the
[1:29:31] atheist in the
[1:29:34] world could not explain it away from
[1:29:38] him he was there right he know it
[1:29:42] happened every Christian should have an
[1:29:45] experience before they say anything
[1:29:47] about being a Christian your
[1:29:49] own
[1:29:51] experience brother Briant Moses had such
[1:29:54] an experience that had when he got down
[1:29:56] off that mountain every atheist in the
[1:29:58] world at that time could have been lined
[1:29:59] up there the chief of them
[1:30:02] all oh God I just caught that fresh the
[1:30:06] chief of them all and they would still
[1:30:08] not talk Moses out of what just happened
[1:30:10] up there on that mountain brother they
[1:30:12] could stand there and say Moses you're
[1:30:13] crazy he'd say well I'm crazy believer
[1:30:16] they'd say Moses there's no way that a
[1:30:18] bush could be on fire and not be
[1:30:19] consumed he said you can't say that
[1:30:21] because you weren't there but I was
[1:30:22] there I saw it amen
[1:30:26] GL I was there I saw it they could say
[1:30:29] Moses there's no way you could take a a
[1:30:31] stick and throw it down and it become a
[1:30:33] serpent and pick it up and it become a
[1:30:35] rod again he said well you can say it
[1:30:37] didn't happen but I saw it right amen
[1:30:40] are you hearing me am then today is
[1:30:42] there another group of people in the
[1:30:44] land who has been up on the mountain
[1:30:46] with Jesus they've been up to the
[1:30:48] burning bush and they met God for
[1:30:50] themselves and when somebody says
[1:30:52] William bam wasn't a prophet you can say
[1:30:54] you can say that but I was there I saw
[1:30:57] [Applause]
[1:30:59] it oh they can say that the Seven Seals
[1:31:03] have not been open but you can stand
[1:31:05] there and say let me tell you something
[1:31:07] the reason I know the Seven Seals are
[1:31:09] open is because the word is working
[1:31:12] mightily in the vessel that heard the
[1:31:15] opening of those Seven Seals brother
[1:31:17] Andrew how can you stand and say sunset
[1:31:19] Mountain was Revelation 101 fulfilled
[1:31:22] because I heard a prophet say it and
[1:31:24] because I am a believer not by head
[1:31:27] knowledge not by education but by an
[1:31:32] [Music]
[1:31:33] [Applause]
[1:31:36] experience and I close with
[1:31:39] this your
[1:31:42] own
[1:31:45] experience somebody just say that with
[1:31:47] me your own your own experience
[1:31:50] experience now just say own own own
[1:31:54] little word ain't it just a little bitty
[1:31:57] word right but you know what that word
[1:31:59] own means it's used with the possessive
[1:32:02] right to emphasize that someone or
[1:32:06] something belongs or relates to the
[1:32:09] person or thing mention right oh
[1:32:12] God to have something as one's own to
[1:32:17] possess it then what did Brother I'm say
[1:32:19] you've got to own your own experience
[1:32:22] you've got to have your own experience
[1:32:26] and your experience has to own
[1:32:29] you you've got to possess an experience
[1:32:33] and your experience oh God are you
[1:32:35] hearing me Church your experience has
[1:32:37] got to possess you amen the Bible says
[1:32:40] in Song of Solomon 63 I am my beloveds
[1:32:43] and my beloveds is mine he Feth among
[1:32:46] the lies but we don't come here this

[1:32:49] historical Affair which is all true but
[1:32:51] we come here this morning with a
[1:32:52] testimony I I know
[1:32:55] Hallelujah I know that Jesus Christ is
[1:32:59] the Son of God I know it Beyond any
[1:33:01] shout of it doubt I know that he raised
[1:33:03] from the dead and he lives within me

[1:33:22] own him I possess him oh church if he is
[1:33:27] yours then you know what you'll call him
[1:33:29] you'll call him Lord oh you know Jesus
[1:33:32] said in one case he asked a question I
[1:33:34] like to say tonight this Jesus said why
[1:33:36] why do you call me Lord what is it what
[1:33:38] does it it's because the denominational
[1:33:40] tradition stands between them and the
[1:33:42] word and anything stands between you and
[1:33:44] God is an idol it takes the place of God
[1:33:47] why I call you lord lord means
[1:33:50] ownership yesen Lord means
[1:33:54] ownership amen our Lord owns the
[1:33:57] property and if God owns
[1:34:00] me if I am his and he turned me around
[1:34:04] one day when I was on the wrong road and
[1:34:07] called me for a purpose what am I to do
[1:34:09] but to fulfill his desire like he did
[1:34:14] Peter amen can I can I leave you this
[1:34:16] one with this one gold nugget when when
[1:34:18] the Lord showed this to me about turn my
[1:34:20] office upside down it ain't hard to do
[1:34:21] it's on bricks amen Jeremiah 1 five says
[1:34:24] before I form thee in thy belly oh yeah
[1:34:29] what word does he use I knew thee before
[1:34:34] I formed thee in thy belly I knew Thee I
[1:34:37] am my beloved and he is
[1:34:41] mine the Lord is mine I am his before I
[1:34:47] form thee in thy belly I knew thee and
[1:34:50] before thou camest forth out of the womb
[1:34:52] I sanctify thee and I ordain thee a
[1:34:55] prophet of the Nations oh brother what's
[1:34:57] he saying he knew you before you were
[1:35:00] born therefore he knew you would know
[1:35:05] him that'll hit you about 12:00 tomorrow

[1:35:11] death to at work to death you know what
[1:35:13] before you was born amen I'm done right

[1:35:23] before you broke the womb and breathed
[1:35:25] one breath he knew you and by knowing
[1:35:27] you he placed a seat in you you know
[1:35:29] what that seat did that seat owned you
[1:35:31] it claims you for this age that when
[1:35:33] Jesus Christ would be reintroduced to
[1:35:36] the church again there would be a people
[1:35:38] in the earth that would know their God
[1:35:41] and would be strong and do great
[1:35:43] exploits can I get a witness here

[2:06:16] daddy would he set me down and I was
[2:06:18] just a
[2:06:20] teenager and um
[2:06:22] nothing wrong with that being a teenager
[2:06:24] but I never forget dad he sat me down
[2:06:26] and he said son he said you believe this
[2:06:28] message I said yeah Dad I believe it's
[2:06:30] the truth and he looks look Point Blank
[2:06:32] at me he said no you don't he said
[2:06:35] because if you did you'd live
[2:06:38] it but you know no matter how much that
[2:06:41] I I went through all of
[2:06:43] that there's no doubt you know sitting
[2:06:45] in this room here or standing in the
[2:06:47] room tonight or maybe listening by way
[2:06:48] of internet or will hear this service
[2:06:53] it be had to become something more than
[2:06:56] my
[2:06:58] efforts it had to become God on the
[2:07:03] inside and you meet him that's that's
[2:07:05] the whole that's that's the theme what
[2:07:08] brother Andrew preached tonight I think
[2:07:09] is brother brandham you know if we ever
[2:07:12] get away from this you got away from the
[2:07:13] colonel brother BR calls it the colonel
[2:07:16] that's every service whether John 3 is
[2:07:19] read or not whether the phrase is
[2:07:21] mentioned you must be born again that's
[2:07:23] what every message is
[2:07:25] about I I I I know for the truth you
[2:07:28] could preach marriage and divorce and
[2:07:30] people are born again because it's the
[2:07:32] word of God it's Discerning Christ in
[2:07:36] our midst that word it it strikes our
[2:07:39] hearts a living experience of a living
[2:07:42] God and it it lifts it's such a such a
[2:07:45] precious reality I think of how brother
[2:07:47] brandham when they they told Brother
[2:07:49] brandham as he stood there in sh port in
[2:07:51] night
[2:07:52] 1965 he talked about the message the
[2:07:54] lamb and the dove that brother Bram had
[2:07:55] preached he said brother Bram I guess
[2:07:57] with your schedule and the way things
[2:07:59] are you don't get to preach messages
[2:08:01] like that no more and brother BR says if
[2:08:03] I ever get away from that message of the
[2:08:06] lamb and the dove he said then I've
[2:08:08] gotten away from my
[2:08:10] message because that's what it's come to
[2:08:12] do the dove of the Holy Spirit has come
[2:08:16] to lead the Lambs of God it's come to
[2:08:21] lead us and bring us life this is what
[2:08:24] real life really is this is what real
[2:08:26] Joy is I used to wonder why you know my
[2:08:30] my parents wow my goodness you know
[2:08:32] they're missing out on fun or how how do
[2:08:34] they see this as fun but once you come
[2:08:36] behind the veil with an
[2:08:38] experience then this this is what fun is
[2:08:41] this is what real Joy is it's not just
[2:08:43] Joy when I'm here it's Joy when I'm
[2:08:45] sitting out there in the blind in the
[2:08:47] woods it's Joy when I when I'm walking
[2:08:49] and down the road it's joy in my prayer
[2:08:51] closet it's joy to serve the Lord it's
[2:08:54] an anchor that holds us I tell you I I
[2:08:57] feel like that what God has brought to
[2:08:59] us is just it's absolutely fitting it's
[2:09:02] necessary it's needful my prayer is is
[2:09:05] May there not be one that would go away
[2:09:08] from here tonight by way of the internet
[2:09:10] or those that will I pray if somebody
[2:09:12] hasn't listened to it or streaming I
[2:09:13] pray God will wake them up I pray God
[2:09:16] will stir them take peace from them
[2:09:17] cause them to get up and say I need to
[2:09:19] listen to that Thursday night message I
[2:09:21] can't can't sleep anyhow and I pray that
[2:09:23] whoever doesn't those that don't have an
[2:09:25] experience that they'll receive an
[2:09:27] experience to know it's for you it don't
[2:09:30] matter what age you are the experience
[2:09:33] itself is the passing from Death unto
[2:09:37] life brother B says he whispers he
[2:09:40] speaks into your heart when he says
[2:09:42] brother BR said when he says your mind
[2:09:44] he said you'll know if he spoke to you
[2:09:46] watch how your life is after that you
[2:09:49] see he lays claim on our life ownership
