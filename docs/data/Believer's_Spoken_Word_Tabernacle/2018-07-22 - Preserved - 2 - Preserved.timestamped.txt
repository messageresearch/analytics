[36:09] bless each and every one of you I mean
[36:11] good to have Caroline and sister Anita
[36:14] back gone way too long you all don't
[36:23] have to have a visa for Costa Rica do
[36:24] you we're gonna put one in well let's
[36:38] look into the word verse 25 if we could
[36:52] as he say it's also in Hosea I will call
[36:57] them my people which were not my people
[37:00] and her beloved which was not beloved
[37:05] and it shall come to pass that in the
[37:07] place where it was said unto them ye are
[37:10] not my people there shall they be called
[37:13] the children of the Living God
[37:17] Isaiah's also can cry at concerning
[37:20] Israel though the number of the children
[37:23] of Israel be as the sand of the sea a
[37:26] remnant shall be saved for he will
[37:31] finish the work and cut it short in
[37:34] righteousness because a short work will
[37:37] the Lord make upon the earth and as
[37:40] Isaiah said before except the Lord of
[37:43] Sabaoth had left us a seed we had been
[37:47] as sodom and been made like unto
[37:50] Gomorrha Amen may God bless the reading
[37:55] of his word bless you for being seated
[38:05] I want to the Lord will help us just
[38:10] continuing on this thought we began just
[38:14] looking at last week and that's on the
[38:19] thought of preserved and I went through
[38:24] and kind of gave a little bit of a
[38:26] background on this from last week where
[38:30] the thought and you know I I don't
[38:32] usually do that but just in the terms of
[38:37] where we had had been upon our vacation
[38:41] we had went to Gettysburg and around the
[38:44] nose and we in though in that area and
[38:46] it spent multiple days there just
[38:50] touring different museums that are their
[38:53] battlefields many historical sites and
[38:58] yet when I was there before going there
[39:03] the thought that just kept moving on my
[39:05] heart and sometimes you know myself I
[39:09] don't know when God would have me to
[39:11] bring something I the inspiration comes
[39:13] many times I write things down sometimes
[39:16] there's things that I've studied and
[39:17] just continued to had to for years and
[39:20] then all of a sudden the Holy Spirit
[39:22] will say now is the time and so we we
[39:25] always want to be led of him you know
[39:27] brother venom tells us in multiple
[39:29] places in the scripture or in the
[39:31] message and I think of one place but
[39:34] there's many places but Feast of the
[39:36] trumpets and he speaks of how that when
[39:39] he was intending to come back to to
[39:43] Jeffersonville and to minister on those
[39:46] seven trumpets those seven last vials
[39:49] and the Holy Spirit pressing upon his
[39:51] heart and you recall it was something
[39:55] where he talked about how himself his
[39:56] stomach was upset in the condition and
[39:59] and he said that the Lord spoke to him
[40:02] and said you these have already been
[40:03] preached supernaturally under those six
[40:07] seals and when we we look at that you he
[40:12] brother bream goes on to say he said
[40:14] what many would call Jew
[40:16] of a Nile he said but yet he said what
[40:18] we look at is the leading of the Holy
[40:21] Spirit that's something that truly is a
[40:25] mystery to the world and it is a mystery
[40:29] for one who does not know the Lord in
[40:33] that way that God he does lead us that's
[40:36] his promise that the Spirit the sons of
[40:38] God are led by the Spirit of God and I
[40:42] believe that that same God that's one
[40:44] thing that I believe that when God has
[40:46] brought the message to us it brings
[40:50] Christ back to the center of all things
[40:53] in our lives and the word that it is
[40:56] Christ who is the leader of the Church
[40:59] of the Living God I believe that with
[41:01] all my heart it brings to the reality of
[41:04] our need and our dependency upon him and
[41:07] I begin to think of those that term
[41:10] preserved and just looking at what it
[41:13] means to be preserved and how is it that
[41:16] God how is it that God preserves his
[41:19] outworking in the fulfillment of his
[41:22] message because when I look around that
[41:26] battlefield I look around in those
[41:27] places and they are all marked with
[41:31] memorials and inscriptions and you can
[41:34] go to other places and yet those things
[41:38] you can read up you can read them you
[41:40] can look at them and truly there are
[41:43] things that are wrote there that are
[41:45] preserved there are monuments and
[41:47] different things they erect upon certain
[41:49] sites but yet when we look at the the
[41:52] preservation of what God would desire
[41:55] for our lives it's not that we would be
[41:58] a lifeless Idol or image but that we
[42:03] would be a living image of the Living
[42:06] God and this is only something this is
[42:10] God's working that he desires that it
[42:13] would be his image that would be
[42:15] reflected through our lives and I think
[42:19] of it you know when we look back upon
[42:21] this the thought that we have been
[42:24] dealing with here on preserved and I
[42:26] took you I'm just going to review just a
[42:28] few moments before we move on
[42:30] just a little further we come into a
[42:32] place that you know for many and I think
[42:35] within schools and III really wouldn't
[42:37] know right now if it's still where it's
[42:40] at with in history books even within
[42:42] schools I really don't know I can't tell
[42:44] you what what depth or what is pointed
[42:48] out in there but as I mentioned to you
[42:50] last week that when the battle itself
[42:54] and everything had commenced there was a
[42:56] man by the name of David wills who was
[42:59] given the the appointment to set up the
[43:03] itinerary and and the creation of a
[43:06] cemetery for all of those who had fallen
[43:08] in the Civil War he was a lawyer he was
[43:11] a prominent man there in Gettysburg and
[43:13] here in setting that up and bringing the
[43:17] the complete layout of the dedication of
[43:20] that Cemetery for lives that had fallen
[43:22] from the north and the south they they
[43:25] call upon a man that in in in all
[43:27] honesty I've never heard of this man
[43:29] before I never read of the man's name I
[43:33] really I would not even known his name
[43:35] I don't even recall anything that was
[43:38] ever mentioned that I can remember in
[43:40] school or anything of what he had to say
[43:42] but yet here this man is known as Edward
[43:46] Everett and he was a very prominent
[43:48] figure within that time and he was a
[43:51] great orator one who could speak and
[43:55] people anticipated that he would speak
[43:57] at least two hours in the dedication of
[44:00] this Cemetery and the last little thing
[44:03] that they had had mentioned when they
[44:06] were setting up the program was that
[44:08] they wanted President Lincoln to be able
[44:12] to come and make a few appropriate
[44:16] remarks now you think of this man this
[44:20] man Edward Edward he he took and he gave
[44:25] an oration or speech that was well over
[44:28] two hours and he was just putting this
[44:32] with this and this battle of antiquity
[44:35] with this and with that and President
[44:37] Lincoln he gets up and he has
[44:41] what we know is the Gettysburg Address
[44:43] and he speaks just a little over two
[44:46] minutes they could not even get a
[44:49] picture of him speaking because they
[44:52] couldn't get the shutter open in time
[44:54] from the time he walked up there to the
[44:56] time that he finished delivering the
[44:58] speech it was entirely over and it was
[45:02] finished and yet this is why I draw back
[45:06] to this point that we were I was looking
[45:09] at is that no one really remembers
[45:12] outside of history buffs if you can say
[45:14] it knowing about the other man but
[45:17] nobody remembers or recalls that part
[45:19] what everything when you think of the
[45:21] term Gettysburg or anything you'll think
[45:24] of maybe the Gettysburg Address and you
[45:26] know that you know you know well there's
[45:28] a that's a battle and I hope you know
[45:30] you know you would know it was in a
[45:32] Civil War and not think what was that
[45:34] the Vietnam War or you know and and and
[45:37] things like that and I know we we would
[45:39] laugh at that and that sounds funny but
[45:41] in reality there's so many that even
[45:44] here that walk upon this land that don't
[45:47] know the first thing about this nation
[45:51] that's the truth they don't know the
[45:53] first thing about and I'm talking about
[45:55] people that was even born here and
[45:57] whatever more but I'm I thing what I was
[46:00] drawn to is how that would the
[46:02] inspiration is how that Abraham Lincoln
[46:05] when he he started in this address he he
[46:11] makes mention in his very opening
[46:13] statements that four score and seven
[46:16] years ago our fathers brought forth on
[46:19] this continent a new nation conceived in
[46:22] Liberty and dedicated to the proposition
[46:24] that all men are created equal I want
[46:30] you to notice this is something I was
[46:32] just drawn to is how that what had taken
[46:35] place and what was going on within the
[46:38] nation at that time as we were alluding
[46:41] to that last week he went back to the
[46:44] founding fathers and he went back to not
[46:48] just to the founding fathers but he
[46:51] refers back to inspiration
[46:55] that they themselves when they wrote not
[46:58] the Constitution these words all men are
[47:01] created equal is what was wrote in the
[47:03] Declaration of Independence
[47:05] there's amendment now those things that
[47:07] are within the Constitution but what I
[47:10] want you to see is that hehe went back
[47:12] to the inspiration and that's that's
[47:16] very important he just did not refer
[47:19] these are not just words was going on
[47:22] within that time where the Civil War
[47:24] itself evolved you have that you know we
[47:28] know there was an issue there are issues
[47:30] that were very much at the forefront and
[47:32] yet this is the thing I refer to these
[47:35] places and I want to pick this up here
[47:37] in just a little bit but when President
[47:40] Lincoln he's ending this this whole
[47:42] thought on the Gettysburg Address the
[47:44] last few statements is that this nation
[47:47] under God shall have a new birth of
[47:50] freedom and that government of the
[47:53] people by the people for the people
[47:55] shall not perish from the earth and I
[47:58] think that's a very good thought but yet
[48:01] we you and I we recognized as we looked
[48:04] at it last week brother Branham is in
[48:06] prayer and he's speaking of 1956 and I
[48:10] was 55 I believe I was quoting from and
[48:12] he was thinking God for being able to
[48:15] live within this nation and his prayer
[48:17] was his Lord we thank you for the right
[48:21] to be able to read these scriptures read
[48:24] this Bible in that of freedom of
[48:26] religion and he says long may this be
[48:29] preserved and I will definitely assert
[48:34] clearly that if we can I believe that we
[48:37] can agree that every nation that has
[48:40] ever been under the face of this earth
[48:43] that has ever rose and then has ever
[48:46] fallen it's rising was because of God's
[48:49] sovereignty either in that it was a tool
[48:53] to bring judgment or it was that of a
[48:57] nation where God would allow the rising
[49:00] in order for his word as his word would
[49:03] move through there but then
[49:05] when those men we're after those who
[49:09] were original we could say of founding
[49:12] fathers once they would pass off of the
[49:14] scene and then you had many on down
[49:16] through the time that drifted from the
[49:19] original inspiration then you find where
[49:22] corruption begins to set in and
[49:25] corruption itself you know even within
[49:28] the body when you have a wound or you
[49:30] have a something you have to take care
[49:33] of that you you got to take care of it
[49:36] if you don't corruption can set in and I
[49:39] think of just a young man that I knew
[49:41] some years ago he had had an accident
[49:44] just had a scrape on his leg as a matter
[49:47] of fact around his knee a young boy you
[49:50] cannot pick at this because if you pick
[49:52] at this cab what you're gonna do is
[49:54] bring an infection and you know develop
[49:56] into mersa which then you may end up
[49:59] losing your leg so there's appropriate
[50:02] way even for healing and how corruption
[50:05] corruption does not something that comes
[50:07] in all of a sudden it's something that
[50:10] little by little by little it wants to
[50:14] overtake and so when I they have taken
[50:18] this very speech this very thought that
[50:23] was given and I don't believe I just
[50:25] personally don't believe that President
[50:28] Lincoln was standing there on a stump
[50:29] speech that's my opinion but I believe
[50:33] when I look at it and he right there as
[50:36] I stood in that room that night that he
[50:38] slept in and where isn't the inspiration
[50:41] dropped for this I believe it was a
[50:43] capturing of what took place at that
[50:46] time and then to think it's been such
[50:49] pain taking steps taken in order to
[50:52] preserve the original documents men have
[50:57] research erosion of these documents or
[51:00] decay but they want to see them preserve
[51:03] and we know that there are preservation
[51:06] different places where they are and once
[51:08] such I'm Lincoln his self and yet you
[51:11] can look at that document and you can
[51:13] say that's the original document that
[51:15] it's really preserved
[51:17] but yet my question then arises is is
[51:21] that really true preservation is that
[51:27] what true preservation really is of that
[51:30] Gettysburg Address because there is at
[51:34] it if we look at it the document itself
[51:38] can be preserved by glass where people
[51:41] can walk by how many people maybe today
[51:43] I don't know if it's all I don't know if
[51:45] the Library of Congress is open on a
[51:46] Sunday I don't know that but how many
[51:48] people let's just say yesterday how many
[51:51] people have walked by that document
[51:54] within just the last day or the last
[51:57] week and they've looked at a preserved
[52:00] document of the Gettysburg Address but
[52:04] yet I would ask this that unless and I
[52:07] would say this that unless the meaning
[52:09] of the words expressed in that address
[52:13] or that writing are preserved in the
[52:16] hearts of the people it's not a true
[52:20] preservation we only have the only thing
[52:24] we have then is a historical document a
[52:28] memorial of a historical speech given at
[52:32] a historical event by historical figure
[52:35] or president whereby we have no
[52:37] connection
[52:39] we have no and we have no no true
[52:42] understanding of its meaning to our life
[52:44] in other words what he was expressing
[52:46] there of what the trueness of what the
[52:50] inspiration that the father the founding
[52:53] fathers were speaking of of America so a
[52:56] person can look upon that and yet truly
[52:59] does not know what it means to be an
[53:01] American they can read it listen we
[53:07] could have tapes of him giving this
[53:10] address
[53:10] that's not preservation you could have
[53:15] his voice recorded and here Lincoln's
[53:18] voice but yet it's not true preservation
[53:21] you realize that we you know brother
[53:25] Bram said they said if we they could
[53:26] come to that technology they can pick up
[53:29] the very words of the Lord Jesus that
[53:31] was spoke years ago he said because
[53:33] those words continue on do you realize
[53:36] that we could have even if we had the
[53:39] cassette tapes or whatever you want to
[53:41] say mp3s or whatever more of the Lord
[53:43] Jesus Christ speaking it still is not
[53:46] the true preservation you could have all
[53:51] of that and yet it not be preserved it's
[53:53] just like this Bible to have yet all of
[53:57] the words but yet if these words are not
[54:01] inscripted upon the heart and life of
[54:04] the believer then it's not preserved now
[54:09] we understand there's no man Canon
[54:12] script these words on our heart no sir
[54:15] it takes a work of God himself this is
[54:20] where that Peter would draw the
[54:22] inspiration James would also speak of
[54:26] receiving the engrafted word in meekness
[54:29] Peter would speak it up and say to be
[54:32] born of the incorruptible Word of God
[54:35] it's to where that word now it has it
[54:38] has a preeminence within our heart it
[54:41] wouldn't matter what would happen as I
[54:44] said there
[54:45] sweet they could take this and they
[54:47] could do whatever that they wanted to do
[54:49] with it but listen when God's time is
[54:52] finished and that word itself it has
[54:55] been wrote upon our hearts do you might
[54:57] destroy this but you'll never get this
[55:00] out of here you can put them in boiling
[55:05] oil you can't separate them from the
[55:08] love of God they tried to get it out of
[55:12] John they tried to get it out of men and
[55:15] women down through the ages that pledge
[55:17] their allegiance to the Lamb of God to
[55:20] all of those William Tyndale and
[55:22] different ones who gave their life they
[55:25] tried to get it out but you might be
[55:27] able to take it out of their hand but
[55:28] you cannot take it out of their hearts
[55:31] that's true preservation that kind of
[55:37] preservation closes men and women to
[55:40] stand in the face of adversity
[55:44] hallelujah glory be to God so then the
[55:50] question last few moments that we were
[55:54] there that last day I stood there I was
[55:59] actually there standing by myself Paul
[56:01] had went down a little bit further and
[56:03] my wife and my mom and Zachary and Ben
[56:06] had went to another part there of that
[56:08] National Cemetery you know when I walked
[56:11] in they have a place where you could
[56:16] take a picture they've got Lincoln's you
[56:19] know his face and bust or what happened
[56:21] right there and you can take a picture
[56:23] in front of this place and and I began
[56:25] reading on this plaque and they said
[56:28] this is where Lincoln gave the
[56:31] Gettysburg Address so I you know me just
[56:34] simple just take anything so it was must
[56:36] have been right here was it right here
[56:38] that he gave it and so I just looking
[56:41] and I'm thinking well there's some
[56:43] incredible places maybe he was standing
[56:45] right there and so after coming around a
[56:50] little bit and Here I am standing and
[56:51] this park ranger is giving this
[56:55] Horatian they're in the cemetery you
[57:00] know I I just listened I stopped and
[57:02] listened and you know he's speaking in
[57:05] many parts and I asked oh I didn't ask
[57:08] but here he he he mentions at the end he
[57:11] said you know one of the pressing
[57:12] questions that's always before the
[57:14] people is where did Lincoln stand when
[57:18] he gave the address and he says you know
[57:22] and he's point syria's we're standing in
[57:24] the National Cemetery and you know the
[57:25] the fence of evergreen cemetery which is
[57:28] where he gave the speech act is that is
[57:31] it was right in there and the young man
[57:33] pointed out and he said what it is he
[57:35] said it's somewhere he said between this
[57:37] Monument and that row of trees to the
[57:39] south which is about a 20 yard space he
[57:42] said somewhere along in there
[57:44] he said he stood and gave that speech
[57:47] now this is what struck my horn as I
[57:49] stood there I said oh god it wouldn't
[57:55] matter if you had the spot marks with an
[57:57] axe
[57:57] show me where Lincoln stood because you
[58:01] could be standing where he stood and yet
[58:03] not standing where he stood that says
[58:07] that's what struck my heart you could
[58:09] stand where he stood and yet you're not
[58:10] standing where he stood because you can
[58:12] stand right there and say I'm right here
[58:14] where he gave the Gettysburg Address but
[58:16] yet you're not standing in the thought
[58:18] and inspiration that he gave it in so
[58:22] it's not we think you know you know
[58:24] those are wonderful things memorials
[58:27] but there are our Testaments in our
[58:31] lives now move to the spiritual side of
[58:33] it there are Testaments there are things
[58:35] were in lies where people can stand
[58:38] we're great men of God have stood listen
[58:42] friends even in the visitation that God
[58:44] has brought with the messenger in this
[58:46] hour you can stand where he stood and
[58:48] yet not stand where he stood for you
[58:51] with me the Pharisee stood were Moses
[58:55] stood but they didn't stand where he
[58:56] stood
[59:02] they didn't they had the head of
[59:04] preservation they they believe this is a
[59:07] spot don't touch this spot that but
[59:09] that's not preservation preservation is
[59:13] to recognize what was done here and to
[59:18] see it that there is a continuation
[59:24] because if it doesn't continue then all
[59:27] we have is a historical marker how many
[59:33] times brother Brannon over and over he
[59:35] tells us I don't want a big memorial
[59:37] built to me when I'm gone is that true
[59:42] that's what's what's was prayer over and
[59:44] over throughout the message said but I
[59:45] want him to know one thing
[59:46] that Jesus Christ is alive I want that
[59:51] to be the effect he said it over and
[59:55] over you know he says not for one moment
[59:57] do I bring a message that people would
[59:59] follow me but that there would be a true
[1:00:02] uniting between the believer and the
[1:00:05] Lord Jesus Christ because you see he
[1:00:09] realized people could follow him but yet
[1:00:12] not follow him they could stand where he
[1:00:17] stood and yet not stand where he stood
[1:00:19] oh my this is very this is very
[1:00:23] pertinent to our lives my heart was just
[1:00:26] so moved within within thinking of this
[1:00:29] here because when we look at the
[1:00:31] continuity of how that God's desire when
[1:00:36] God would send a revival to the earth
[1:00:40] and and a revival let me just say it
[1:00:42] very clearly a revival is not an
[1:00:45] emotional gathering it's not an
[1:00:48] emotional work of it's not a feel-good
[1:00:52] session a revival is a cleaning out of
[1:00:57] trash and if it's got to clean out trash
[1:01:00] it takes the pure reality and substance
[1:01:05] of God that's able to identify what
[1:01:08] trash and be able to cut it away and it
[1:01:12] rises from our heart in repentance it
[1:01:15] washes from in our hearts to the very
[1:01:18] shores of our lips and says Lord forgive
[1:01:21] me Lord a revival is where that life is
[1:01:26] brought present how many times here we
[1:01:31] see the pattern down through the ages
[1:01:35] where the Prophet would even speak to
[1:01:37] how that he says people don't usually
[1:01:40] heed God's warning but he says after
[1:01:44] that revival fire has been built upon
[1:01:47] the sacred word I want you listen to
[1:01:49] these words build upon the sacred word
[1:01:51] it's so wonderful and the manifestation
[1:01:54] of the Spirit is so blessed that a
[1:01:57] little fear creeps in and a whisper in
[1:02:00] the heart says how can we protect this
[1:02:03] truth we have what can we do to see this
[1:02:07] revival goes on well you can put it in a
[1:02:12] case you can create a museum out of it
[1:02:16] but that will preserve it I mean listen
[1:02:20] I think you know when I've been out in
[1:02:23] the different places and I've come
[1:02:25] across things when you know brother ray
[1:02:26] you took me out there to that place of
[1:02:28] where Charles Finney was buried and we
[1:02:30] stood around there and gave thanks for
[1:02:32] his life I thank God for his life and
[1:02:35] and I realize I'm walking over some of
[1:02:37] the ground perhaps that Charles Finney
[1:02:39] walked over but I when I when I looked
[1:02:42] at it I realized it was not with the
[1:02:44] intent of a museum and just to have an
[1:02:46] inscription of his name or a museum does
[1:02:49] not mean that what he stood for has been
[1:02:51] preserved but its sacredness of a
[1:02:58] revival and listen it's very clear a
[1:03:00] revival my true revival is built on the
[1:03:03] sacred word it's got to come back to the
[1:03:07] original document are you with me it
[1:03:11] wasn't the Constitution France it was a
[1:03:13] declaration of independence it was
[1:03:15] declaring live
[1:03:17] tea that's why there's got to be a ring
[1:03:22] and a declare of Liberty and Jubilee
[1:03:26] from your heart and then when that is
[1:03:27] declared
[1:03:28] then comes the Constitution where the
[1:03:31] Holy Spirit comes down and begins to
[1:03:33] write upon the tablets of your heart
[1:03:36] [Applause]
[1:03:38] hallelujah and our conduct is just like
[1:03:41] where the Prophet will give that story
[1:03:43] of the young man they didn't understand
[1:03:45] why is he acting different what are you
[1:03:49] doing are you treating him any different
[1:03:51] no his treatment was the same but what
[1:03:54] was different about him than the others
[1:03:56] the difference was he knew who he was he
[1:04:01] knew what belonged to him though eyes
[1:04:03] there was nothing that where someone
[1:04:05] could say prove you're a king son he
[1:04:08] could not as far as be able to bring his
[1:04:10] father physically there but it was there
[1:04:13] within his heart what was in his genes
[1:04:16] what's in his heart
[1:04:17] and it moved him even though he was
[1:04:20] distance and miles away what his father
[1:04:23] was and ears was preserved in his heart
[1:04:28] and he knew who he was it's built upon
[1:04:34] the sacred Word of God but then and how
[1:04:38] God manifests the spirit but then how
[1:04:41] that a little fear will prevent how
[1:04:44] we're going to keep this how are we
[1:04:45] going to preserve this as I said to you
[1:04:50] last week it's God who sins the
[1:04:56] messenger it's God who sins the message
[1:05:01] and the God who did the sending is the
[1:05:05] God who does the backing up and the God
[1:05:08] who does the backing up is the God who
[1:05:11] sees that it continues on not in the way
[1:05:14] that where it would be looked at listen
[1:05:17] friends in reality if brother Branham
[1:05:19] was still here today we probably
[1:05:21] wouldn't be here we'd all be gathered
[1:05:23] down in Jeffersonville but you see God's
[1:05:26] continuity is not always a call
[1:05:29] to man's thinking of it man wants to
[1:05:32] relish in the past but recognize what
[1:05:35] God did there it was a reality and it
[1:05:39] was God being manifest to us in this
[1:05:42] generation that our lives might be
[1:05:45] overtaken by the leadership of the Holy
[1:05:47] Ghost and the Christ might have the
[1:05:50] preeminence in our lives because I tell
[1:05:55] you without the Holy Ghost and without
[1:05:58] being born again this message is not
[1:06:01] preserved in your life and you are not
[1:06:04] preserved by it it's got to be the
[1:06:07] author of the word who gave the word the
[1:06:11] inspiration come down and you come one
[1:06:15] with him then it's preserved then the
[1:06:19] message is not just something that's
[1:06:20] talked about but you yourself are the
[1:06:23] very manifestation of this message fear
[1:06:31] creeps in fear God does not maintain his
[1:06:35] word by fear the fear of the Lord is
[1:06:38] clean is that true
[1:06:41] there is fear reverential fear but not
[1:06:43] fear like this Butler Bram says when
[1:06:46] that happens that's when the antichrist
[1:06:47] spirit comes in and whispers look you
[1:06:50] have the truth now see that it doesn't
[1:06:53] get lost organize and set up your creed
[1:06:55] of what you believe put it all in a
[1:06:57] church manual
[1:06:59] I asked you when they wrote the
[1:07:03] Gettysburg Address it's sealed away in
[1:07:05] the Library of Congress but I ask you
[1:07:08] has it been preserved they set it up you
[1:07:13] don't don't don't dance worth it don't
[1:07:14] don't no no yeah I tell you what I'd be
[1:07:17] Dara Singh you would be Dara Singh to
[1:07:19] even try to make one step towards that
[1:07:24] but yet it's not preserved that's not
[1:07:28] how its preserved you could have it all
[1:07:31] set up and it comes down into a manual
[1:07:33] that's not what the working of the Holy
[1:07:35] Ghost is about that's not the leading of
[1:07:39] the Lord to where where lives are just
[1:07:41] well it's just looking at print no it's
[1:07:44] got to take inspiration of the Holy
[1:07:47] Ghost
[1:07:51] Alleluia this is not a movement of man
[1:07:56] this is a move of God if it's a move of
[1:08:02] man it will cease every doctrine that
[1:08:07] has originated within the thoughts of
[1:08:09] man if it hasn't run aground
[1:08:11] it will run aground because he cannot
[1:08:14] endure but that original inspiration of
[1:08:19] the Holy Ghost
[1:08:20] the one one man's taken off the scene
[1:08:23] another is taken home or whatever but
[1:08:26] that same inspiration will go on because
[1:08:30] it is God behind it God preserving his
[1:08:35] word and God don't want his word
[1:08:38] preserved to where it's something where
[1:08:41] we got to come to a glass to look at it
[1:08:44] but we are to be his display case where
[1:08:48] his word is on display in our lives not
[1:08:51] just what we could quote but what our
[1:08:54] life pulls out those are lifes amen to
[1:08:58] the Word of God how can we put it in a
[1:09:03] church manual I'll tell you right now
[1:09:04] there is inerrant listen there are
[1:09:06] people and I know there's been many
[1:09:08] versions of the Bible there's been
[1:09:10] versions just like when every messages
[1:09:12] went
[1:09:13] there ends up being multiple versions
[1:09:14] come on because there's men that are not
[1:09:18] taught by the same Holy Ghost who
[1:09:19] brought it through that messenger are
[1:09:21] you with me
[1:09:22] they're not taught by that light it is
[1:09:24] where a light it runs the ground but it
[1:09:27] doesn't continue on but look at this
[1:09:29] a person could have this and I say you
[1:09:31] know that the King James Version of the
[1:09:33] Bible they can have all of the words and
[1:09:36] you would sit there and they were
[1:09:38] defending you I'm a King James only
[1:09:40] you're not going to take one word out of
[1:09:42] here but when you begin to move down
[1:09:44] through the pages of the word then you
[1:09:47] begin to bring them across do you
[1:09:49] believe that he's the same today do you
[1:09:51] believe that he still feels what the
[1:09:54] Holy Ghost do you believe in a genuine
[1:09:57] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:09:59] do you believe better than a woman
[1:10:01] should be in subjection and a man ought
[1:10:03] to be in subjection under God do you
[1:10:05] believe those things well huh I don't
[1:10:07] know about that but yet they would not
[1:10:09] allow you to take one word out of this
[1:10:11] right here but let me tell you something
[1:10:13] when they have failed to give their
[1:10:15] heart to it there has already been word
[1:10:18] taken from them although they think they
[1:10:20] have it so preserved you can have this
[1:10:24] locked up and tight lock and key and yet
[1:10:27] it not preserved there's only one thing
[1:10:29] that preserves the working of the Word
[1:10:32] of God and that's the security of the
[1:10:34] seal of the Holy Ghost hallelujah and
[1:10:39] that seal lets me know this is
[1:10:43] authenticated by the author himself this
[1:10:48] is an official document and it lets it
[1:10:51] be know there are thoroughbred papers
[1:10:54] that are lay within this lot true
[1:10:57] genuine see and my spirit has brought it
[1:11:00] to life my seal says they are mine
[1:11:06] you'll have to be sprayed like hotbed
[1:11:08] plants promise positions and everything
[1:11:12] else but ruggedness of Gaillard men
[1:11:15] gallant soldiers of Almighty God to see
[1:11:19] without that revelation and
[1:11:21] understanding what a David say in the
[1:11:23] Book of Psalms
[1:11:24] I think it's Psalm 73 he said our
[1:11:28] fathers understood not the miracles they
[1:11:33] and they they benefited from they ate
[1:11:37] from the manna they aid they drape from
[1:11:38] the rock they ate the quail they pay
[1:11:40] they experience the heel there in the
[1:11:45] brazen serpent all of those things on
[1:11:48] and on we can go but yet they did not
[1:11:51] understand what it was all about but yet
[1:11:57] they received a call to come out but you
[1:12:00] see Redemption is two parts you have to
[1:12:04] come out and you've got to go in
[1:12:07] are you listening you see you got to
[1:12:12] know to know what it's all about and
[1:12:14] he's the only one that can do that and
[1:12:16] when we look at this here of how that
[1:12:18] this Antichrist spirit he had already
[1:12:21] entered and I'm not going to dwell on
[1:12:22] that so much here this morning but the
[1:12:24] Antichrist spirit John picks it up of
[1:12:27] how that this Antichrist spirit had
[1:12:29] already entered in you see Satan can't
[1:12:32] he can't get past the Holy Ghost brother
[1:12:38] Graham said in the first seal he said
[1:12:40] that Antichrist is a sharp smart shrewd
[1:12:43] fellow he said hey nobody can outdo him
[1:12:46] but the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost can
[1:12:50] outdo him aren't you glad that the Holy
[1:12:53] Ghost that even when the enemy would
[1:12:55] want to make you feel like you've got a
[1:12:56] right to feel this way and all those
[1:12:58] things but yet he cannot I'll do the
[1:13:00] Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit can call
[1:13:03] it out and say but you're a son of God
[1:13:05] you're a daughter of God and you rise up
[1:13:07] and say get behind me Satan I might have
[1:13:10] a right to feel this way or this I might
[1:13:12] have a right but my rights
[1:13:14] I thought fit that his rights might be
[1:13:16] advanced hallelujah so that that
[1:13:23] advancement of that Antichrist spirit
[1:13:26] John makes it very clear where he says
[1:13:31] that it denies what is that Antichrist
[1:13:34] spirit every spirit that confesseth that
[1:13:37] Jesus
[1:13:38] Christ is come in the flesh is of God
[1:13:41] every spirit that confesseth he has come
[1:13:44] is of God and let me just say it like
[1:13:47] this that's not just looking back 2000
[1:13:49] years ago his coming made way for his
[1:13:56] sacrifice and the sacrifice itself made
[1:14:00] way for the resurrection and the
[1:14:04] resurrection made way for the ascension
[1:14:06] and the Ascension made way for the
[1:14:10] coming of the Holy Ghost that same
[1:14:16] spirit that was in that body he tore
[1:14:19] apart that of the contract he took the
[1:14:22] body up there and he sent the Holy goes
[1:14:24] back the Holy Ghost coming was his
[1:14:26] coming
[1:14:27] not his literal corporal coming it was
[1:14:31] the coming of his presence the coming of
[1:14:33] the Spirit of God back down into the
[1:14:36] hearts of the people of the elect of
[1:14:39] this earth and Satan sought to assail
[1:14:44] against this kingdom but you cannot move
[1:14:46] the kingdom of God no no well what's
[1:14:51] that person had been born of the Spirit
[1:14:53] of God then they begin to see the
[1:14:56] program of God then they began to see or
[1:14:59] understand the kingdom of God
[1:15:02] it's an unfolding of God's program in
[1:15:06] our lives why we've got the original
[1:15:09] inspiration see we're not just looking
[1:15:12] at and we're not looking at a book and
[1:15:13] saying oh I shouldn't do this oh no I
[1:15:14] shouldn't do that you know what listen
[1:15:16] this can make good moral people men said
[1:15:19] to you like this do you realize why
[1:15:21] public schools was first brought in
[1:15:25] the creation of public schools was so
[1:15:28] that young people kids might be able to
[1:15:32] read the scriptures the first thing that
[1:15:36] they were taught that's the whole thing
[1:15:37] that's a bill that's not me making that
[1:15:38] up
[1:15:38] you can search that out that's the phone
[1:15:41] that's the purpose of it but look at
[1:15:44] where it's got to now entirely contrary
[1:15:49] to what the inspiration that was given
[1:15:52] as a matter of fact many times in those
[1:15:55] institutions it's taken and it goes
[1:15:58] completely opposite of what the original
[1:16:02] inspiration was this is why we needed
[1:16:07] the Holy Ghost in this hour thank God
[1:16:10] for eyes that have come in this hour
[1:16:12] thank God that where Satan's cover has
[1:16:16] been taken off that trail of the serpent
[1:16:20] has been exposed
[1:16:23] Alleluia I'm telling who exposed it the
[1:16:26] mighty God himself come down amen and
[1:16:31] took the cover off of Satan hallelujah
[1:16:36] that Antichrist spirit is always
[1:16:39] opposing his coming he is working let me
[1:16:44] move on here here it speaks of even how
[1:16:46] that where Paul would would mention that
[1:16:49] mystery of iniquity in 2nd Thessalonians
[1:16:51] 2:7 the mystery of iniquity doth already
[1:16:53] work Paulo aren't you worried no he's
[1:16:58] got it all in control you see Paul like
[1:17:02] if you go back and you know you read in
[1:17:05] in in the first part I believe it's acts
[1:17:07] 4 after they were filled with the Holy
[1:17:09] Ghost here they came together after the
[1:17:12] persecution and when they prayed they
[1:17:14] said Lord look God Almighty
[1:17:17] thou art / heavens and earth you know if
[1:17:22] they recognize that though this
[1:17:24] persecution and what has a rose there is
[1:17:27] nothing can stem the
[1:17:30] heíd of god's program until his program
[1:17:33] is accomplished and this is what Paul by
[1:17:36] inspiration is picking up only he who
[1:17:39] now letteth will let until he be taken
[1:17:42] out of the way who is the who is who is
[1:17:46] allowing who is permitting the Holy
[1:17:48] Spirit is allowing but until he the Holy
[1:17:53] Spirit where in the bright form be taken
[1:17:56] out of the way you see this is the
[1:18:00] mystery his coming is a going there
[1:18:08] looking for him to step out on clouds
[1:18:10] but they recognize they fail to
[1:18:13] recognize his coming in by the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit for his word is what makes us a
[1:18:22] part of the second coming so as each one
[1:18:26] down through the age have been sealed
[1:18:28] away under that message coming to
[1:18:31] fruition in their life to full maturity
[1:18:33] then has it moves into this time his
[1:18:38] coming is a going it's a secret sudden
[1:18:44] going away now think of this here
[1:18:48] my-my-my think of this here let me just
[1:18:52] try to move through this brother branham
[1:18:57] talks about how the message investments
[1:18:59] he talks about men like John Smith
[1:19:01] Calvin Knox Finney moody he says after
[1:19:04] their death they organized and they got
[1:19:07] a bunch of the good college graduates
[1:19:09] around there they put their own
[1:19:11] interpretation to it making an
[1:19:13] organization there where they died right
[1:19:15] there Sammy they shouldn't have put
[1:19:18] their own interpretation to it I agree I
[1:19:21] agree but why did they why did they do
[1:19:24] that when the Holy Spirit is not welcome
[1:19:29] then you don't have the author the
[1:19:33] inspiration of him who gave it so you
[1:19:37] are left to your own reasonings and to
[1:19:39] your own intellect it comes down to what
[1:19:43] it says in the book of
[1:19:44] judges because they knew not God in all
[1:19:47] these works then they themselves every
[1:19:50] man did what was right in his own right
[1:19:56] there they died right there right there
[1:19:59] when the interpretation was off right
[1:20:02] there death sets in life travels by way
[1:20:08] of the word death also travels by word
[1:20:14] life and death that's where Joshua here
[1:20:17] he is standing before them they had not
[1:20:20] taken all of the land but notice where
[1:20:22] he brings them to I set before you this
[1:20:24] day life and death choose you this day
[1:20:29] we're living in the town choose you this
[1:20:32] day it's between life and death so it's
[1:20:39] not men schooled by men that's not God's
[1:20:44] mind at all that God has an ordained
[1:20:47] school you'll never get a certificate or
[1:20:51] a paper well where's it at will he meet
[1:20:59] you the same place he's met everyone
[1:21:03] hears it all the mountain sometimes is
[1:21:06] it in a valley sometimes is it in a
[1:21:09] plane sometimes he'll meet you right
[1:21:12] there in your heart it might be on a
[1:21:18] mountain it might be beside a rock you
[1:21:20] you understand that's what God it's not
[1:21:22] there's not so much the place it is the
[1:21:25] place where God meets you in your heart
[1:21:28] and conviction is brought right there
[1:21:32] there's a training that God brings by
[1:21:35] his spirit now brother Matt makes this
[1:21:37] statement here he says from the Roman
[1:21:40] Catholic Church the first Roman Catholic
[1:21:42] Church before it become a Roman Church
[1:21:44] it was a Catholic Church at Pentecost
[1:21:47] some nearly three hundred years later at
[1:21:50] nazia Rome it changed from the Apostolic
[1:21:54] Catholic Church
[1:21:56] to the Roman Catholic Church that
[1:22:00] injected men's ideas the little Roman
[1:22:03] pagan superstitions into the scripture
[1:22:06] and since then she has never done
[1:22:08] nothing but lay there dead with members
[1:22:15] now our text that we open without a
[1:22:18] Romans 9 Paul is referring back to what
[1:22:24] was spoken by the Holy Spirit by the
[1:22:27] mouth of Isaiah in Chapter 1 of Isaiah
[1:22:34] you're not fine let me say this you'll
[1:22:38] not find what would be perceived at that
[1:22:41] time a more holier nation a group of
[1:22:46] people who had the prophets visit them
[1:22:51] but yet Isaiah cries by the Spirit of
[1:22:56] God he says what has happened to
[1:22:59] Jerusalem how have you become a harlot
[1:23:03] have you become like Sodom and like
[1:23:06] Amara no he wasn't that they were not
[1:23:10] conducting the feasts they weren't
[1:23:14] conducting the feast right at the right
[1:23:17] time everything they were by the letter
[1:23:23] but you see the Spirit of God called out
[1:23:26] among them and said but you're not
[1:23:29] preserving
[1:23:31] the real reality you're bringing me
[1:23:35] offerings you're doing this but it's a
[1:23:37] stink in my nostril and if it was not as
[1:23:41] Isaiah goes forth if there wasn't that
[1:23:44] there was a seed a promise that God
[1:23:47] would visit Israel and God would bring a
[1:23:50] restoration if there wasn't a promise of
[1:23:53] that he would like them all out you say
[1:23:55] Jerusalem a people whereby the God
[1:23:58] delivered a people whereby that God said
[1:24:01] if you want separate from every other
[1:24:03] nation you'll be under me a peculiar
[1:24:05] treasure but remember God will always
[1:24:08] abandon that which no longer serves his
[1:24:12] purpose and he front brought this down
[1:24:18] to think about it friends in this hour
[1:24:21] the hour that you and I live in had
[1:24:25] there not been a promise that was
[1:24:28] reserved for our lives in this hour of
[1:24:31] which we were tied to that promise
[1:24:34] identified in that promise but God comes
[1:24:37] and he makes that promise alive and real
[1:24:40] to this generation upon multitudes of
[1:24:43] people it has had no effect but upon
[1:24:48] your life it was something that though
[1:24:50] you could not describe that it fit your
[1:24:53] life like a glove it it was actually the
[1:24:56] unfolding of the mystery of your life
[1:25:01] whereby Jerusalem in the natural
[1:25:04] rejected Melchizedek but mechanic came
[1:25:07] to Abraham as the evening light and they
[1:25:12] let Abraham know thou art Abram of the
[1:25:15] Most High God glory be to God confirming
[1:25:23] Abram to his elect seed you are of this
[1:25:27] city hallelujah
[1:25:31] it changed it changed
[1:25:39] you look at the second Timothy 3 and I'm
[1:25:41] not going to read through this we're
[1:25:47] living there in the last days perilous
[1:25:51] times shall come let me just say this to
[1:25:56] you I've mentioned this before by his
[1:25:58] inspiration the next words in verse 2
[1:26:00] does not say men will become shooters
[1:26:03] with guns that those are heinous things
[1:26:06] but this is what I look at what all of
[1:26:09] these things all of these things where
[1:26:11] do we see it for men shall be lovers of
[1:26:13] their own selves that's the root of it
[1:26:19] men are lovers of their own selves I
[1:26:23] said to you before you'd be pressed to
[1:26:26] find a dictionary in previous years now
[1:26:29] the term selfie is in the dictionary
[1:26:33] don't go into something oh yeah don't
[1:26:37] take a selfie or whatever more if you
[1:26:39] are worshiping yourself and posting all
[1:26:41] sorts of pictures of yourself and
[1:26:43] everything else then I say yes you need
[1:26:46] to repent of that it does not mean
[1:26:50] you're looking down this does not mean
[1:26:51] or I look down on myself I'm walking in
[1:26:54] such humility I'm such an ugly person
[1:26:56] that ain't humility that's called
[1:26:57] condemnation don't let the devil fill
[1:26:59] you fool you that's pride just as much
[1:27:01] as on the other line it's just as much
[1:27:03] pride humility is not thinking less of
[1:27:05] yourself it's thinking of yourself less
[1:27:10] lovers of themselves it's all about that
[1:27:15] about me about my me my me man
[1:27:19] you see what this is I'm not gonna do it
[1:27:21] dwell within it this comes into the
[1:27:22] inspiration within this our people's
[1:27:24] rights I'm not going to continue to
[1:27:27] dwell on that one this morning we're
[1:27:30] living in this time we're living in
[1:27:31] manifestations of seeds that have been
[1:27:34] sown and coming to fruition
[1:27:41] how that God would go forth and think of
[1:27:43] this how the these men when the word
[1:27:47] would become open and God would come by
[1:27:50] his mercy and open the word to that
[1:27:54] generation a seal being open God opening
[1:27:59] his word because as the Prophet put it
[1:28:03] like this he says Zion Zion you know as
[1:28:06] the church the Church of the Living God
[1:28:08] he said they get all settled down in
[1:28:10] Zion then God will send a word to stir
[1:28:18] him up because why is it they get all
[1:28:22] settled down there and brother man will
[1:28:24] use this this statement he said there's
[1:28:26] fossils and it's their thoughts we've
[1:28:28] got it all made we've got it all made we
[1:28:36] don't have it all made we need him we
[1:28:42] need him every day we need him every
[1:28:45] moment we need him every hour where do
[1:28:51] we go by the way of the grave or evil to
[1:28:53] the moment as the changing of our bodies
[1:28:56] we need the RAM we need the Rev Jehovah
[1:29:02] Jireh what the ages have looked for
[1:29:07] they've come to this place but how
[1:29:09] Abraham walked there and fake showing
[1:29:13] the maturity of the faith that would
[1:29:15] come to the Abrahamic seed walking where
[1:29:19] to this place he said this is where he
[1:29:21] would meet me and we will come and
[1:29:24] worship here and we will return again
[1:29:29] it's hard not to continue on those
[1:29:32] points hallelujah and he good
[1:29:41] we get it all made to get all settled
[1:29:44] down and then God will send a word I'm
[1:29:46] glad that God doesn't allow us to get
[1:29:48] settled down listen friends let me just
[1:29:51] be very very very frank with you the
[1:29:54] Bible is true God knows that we are but
[1:29:56] flesh but that's not an excuse but this
[1:29:59] is where the Holy Spirit will come right
[1:30:01] down and he'll deal right in our lives
[1:30:03] Oh Lord why how did I get settled down
[1:30:07] what the main thing is is that he comes
[1:30:09] and he stirs you up and let me tell you
[1:30:12] something don't you put one confidence
[1:30:14] in your flesh well I've got it made I'm
[1:30:18] moving forward I listen to a message
[1:30:20] every day this week I read my Bible read
[1:30:22] those are all wonderful those are all
[1:30:24] things to where God is able to move but
[1:30:26] listen have no confidence in your
[1:30:29] efforts have confidence in God that's
[1:30:35] where our confidence is I believe in
[1:30:37] laying in this word you oughta lay in
[1:30:39] this word if you can realize what God
[1:30:41] has sent to us in this generation you
[1:30:44] ought to give your all to him these are
[1:30:51] all examples more that we could go in
[1:30:52] through we have no continuing City I
[1:30:54] stood out there in the house it was a
[1:31:00] house of Charles Finney out there in
[1:31:01] Oberlin it was with them it was after we
[1:31:04] were out there that time with brother
[1:31:05] Timothy is xiong and I took him out the
[1:31:06] next day and they didn't give us a full
[1:31:10] tour a matter of fact it was actually
[1:31:12] closed at that day but the man opened it
[1:31:14] and it began to talk to us and said well
[1:31:17] he said I'll make an exception here as a
[1:31:18] brother he said from from here he said
[1:31:20] in Africa he said I'll make an exception
[1:31:22] and he said we'll uh I'll talk a little
[1:31:25] bit and take you through different parts
[1:31:26] and the things that he spoke about at
[1:31:28] that time it just it from that from that
[1:31:30] moment it spoke of how that you look at
[1:31:33] even the town of Oberlin itself you know
[1:31:35] it was a settlement that was I I can't
[1:31:39] go through the list but it was just
[1:31:41] completely against any attributes of sin
[1:31:45] no tobacco no no no nothing it goes down
[1:31:49] through a whole list
[1:31:50] there was nothing allowed in there like
[1:31:52] that
[1:31:54] charles finney harry becomes a leader of
[1:31:58] that college but I ask you when you look
[1:32:02] at it now and considering this is now
[1:32:04] when we're talking now okay when I was a
[1:32:08] little boy
[1:32:08] Oberlin was known as a place where the
[1:32:12] gays went
[1:32:14] homosexuals and everything else it was
[1:32:16] you could drag down Overland see him
[1:32:18] holding hands I'm not talking about just
[1:32:21] last year until my when I was the age of
[1:32:24] some of the young young people here and
[1:32:26] trows Finney
[1:32:27] stood there you see even though they've
[1:32:31] got monuments of him
[1:32:33] they've got places where he spoke they
[1:32:36] can have all kinds of copies of what he
[1:32:38] said but it's not preserved it's only a
[1:32:43] memorial of which those that would be
[1:32:46] around have no connection yet if you
[1:32:50] would ask them we are Overland we are
[1:32:52] Overland College sounds like Jeremiah
[1:32:55] chapter 7 where the Spirit of God deals
[1:32:59] with Israel and over in just that one
[1:33:02] verse I believe it's verse three of
[1:33:03] verse five over and over he says the
[1:33:05] people say the temple of God the temple
[1:33:07] of God the temple of God the temple of
[1:33:09] God and yet they could look at the
[1:33:13] temple of God and yet it was not
[1:33:14] preserved their lives the Spirit of God
[1:33:19] was pointing out by Jeremiah look at
[1:33:20] your life your life is not reflective
[1:33:23] but yet what you're holding to is the
[1:33:25] temple of God the temple of God the
[1:33:27] temple of God there is an absolute need
[1:33:35] for the token on display it's not enough
[1:33:41] to say the message of the hour the
[1:33:43] message of the hour the message of the
[1:33:45] hour but it must be that of Christ
[1:33:50] Himself making it real within your heart
[1:33:55] and your life that I am the reason this
[1:33:58] message came this light came that I
[1:34:03] might see in
[1:34:04] find my way he came with me in mind it
[1:34:10] didn't come to make where we had to end
[1:34:13] up making a a great settlement no it
[1:34:17] came to bring unity between God and His
[1:34:20] people because there is a promise of a
[1:34:23] rapture and the head must be united with
[1:34:29] the body many other examples that we
[1:34:33] could give that shows that the true
[1:34:35] reality that every Kingdom must give way
[1:34:40] the RAM you know he referred over and
[1:34:42] over you'll speak about how it was
[1:34:47] mentioned by one of the Lords in England
[1:34:50] of how the democracy is all sales and no
[1:34:54] anchor now this is where in the very
[1:34:58] beginning where he's looking at what
[1:35:01] this is being established and he says
[1:35:04] it's all sales in no inker now you find
[1:35:08] brother Ram begins to go through all of
[1:35:11] this and I won't continue to read but it
[1:35:15] is very clear that every nation and
[1:35:20] every Kingdom not myself has failed
[1:35:27] brother memo said in one place he says
[1:35:30] churches has failed human beings have
[1:35:33] failed kings have failed kingdoms have
[1:35:35] fell because you see our hope is not in
[1:35:43] this nation oh one day they're going to
[1:35:52] elect a man and this man is going to
[1:35:55] make this place great again
[1:36:08] my point without dwelling on this this
[1:36:10] morning we are people that would be
[1:36:15] under that inspiration of God that we
[1:36:18] are not to be caught up in the things of
[1:36:21] this earth let me say it clear as the
[1:36:25] Prophet said it and I stand right where
[1:36:27] he stood as well he said I'm neither
[1:36:29] Republican or Democrat I'm a Christian
[1:36:36] very simple very straight why you say
[1:36:40] why would it be blue Samuel you're
[1:36:42] saying we're not to be involved in
[1:36:43] politics I'm gonna tell you if your life
[1:36:46] is so intertwined with that you are sure
[1:36:49] to miss the rapture because your focus
[1:36:52] is on trying to turn things around let
[1:36:55] me tell you something don't you look for
[1:36:57] the government to institute things to
[1:37:00] protect your children you have been
[1:37:02] given access to the baptism of the holy
[1:37:05] ghost a true message of this hour with
[1:37:09] the visitation of the Living God and
[1:37:12] that's what you want to see instituted
[1:37:14] in your homes and in your lives God's
[1:37:21] not going to rapture the documents of
[1:37:23] the Library of Congress but he's come to
[1:37:26] rapture his word that has been made
[1:37:29] flesh for the sin you it's an evil it's
[1:37:33] a wicked day but God's promise is true
[1:37:36] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[1:37:38] Spirit of God who raised a standard
[1:37:40] against it and he's done that and that
[1:37:44] standard is not a doctrine that standard
[1:37:47] is the living person of Jesus Christ
[1:37:56] we're not rallying around a historical
[1:37:59] marker we're not looking back to say oh
[1:38:03] well if Martin Luther could just come
[1:38:05] and was they could only come if William
[1:38:08] Seymore could only come here brother
[1:38:10] Branham could only come no those men
[1:38:14] were all sent by God and the God who
[1:38:18] sent them declared himself
[1:38:21] them calling the people to that word and
[1:38:24] those who caught what was going on and
[1:38:27] submitted to it Oh glory
[1:38:30] our lives are walking memorials of God's
[1:38:33] grace you might never see certain things
[1:38:37] you might never see Spring Street you
[1:38:40] might never see 8th and pen but you are
[1:38:43] the reason God visited in this
[1:38:46] generation yo the real memorial when the
[1:38:52] god when the rapture comes the brand of
[1:38:55] Tabernacle will remain there but the
[1:38:58] tabernacle of the Living God dwelling
[1:39:02] there in the hearts of man that's what
[1:39:04] will be raptured character will be taken
[1:39:07] back with him by people that's preserved
[1:39:10] in him oh my I think God for him for
[1:39:24] historical markers but I believe we need
[1:39:26] to understand the inspiration this is a
[1:39:29] continuity of God's program can have a
[1:39:34] humor moments the brem said it like this
[1:39:41] he said you saw about the days of the
[1:39:44] Joan of Arc Issus the message the Great
[1:39:47] coming revival the outpouring of the
[1:39:50] Holy Spirit
[1:39:51] he said they needed a revolution
[1:39:54] revolution married to straighten things
[1:39:57] up then after they had a revolutionary
[1:39:59] they ought to had a counter
[1:40:01] revolutionary to straighten up things
[1:40:03] that they had he said we was fighting
[1:40:06] recently just for democracy dictatorship
[1:40:08] were democracy he's talking about
[1:40:10] Vietnam
[1:40:11] well democracy Warner democracy is right
[1:40:15] I believe in democracy and I and and and
[1:40:18] and and if I didn't believe in it I
[1:40:20] wouldn't live here but I live here and I
[1:40:23] love it
[1:40:25] I think democracy's right but what we
[1:40:29] need today is an old-fashioned revival
[1:40:32] in the White House to straighten up some
[1:40:35] of the things that's called democracy -
[1:40:39] now I'm getting down to a point that all
[1:40:42] men were created equal this statement is
[1:40:46] made in 1954 what's what he says the
[1:40:49] next statement we need a counter
[1:40:52] revolutionary we need a counter war now
[1:40:55] among ourselves straighten out this
[1:40:58] thing and stop some of this ungodliness
[1:41:01] men walking on the street drunk give him
[1:41:04] enough whiskey to make him drunk then
[1:41:06] arrest him because he is drunk do you
[1:41:09] think that's right that's absolutely
[1:41:11] wrong what is it missing the original
[1:41:16] inspiration all men were created equal I
[1:41:21] believe that every one of us it ought to
[1:41:23] be something that rings in your heart no
[1:41:25] matter background as far as color and
[1:41:27] nationality but all sin is not equal
[1:41:31] this is not the legalization of sin come
[1:41:36] on somebody this is where they veer off
[1:41:39] the inspiration and they want to grant
[1:41:44] equality under the terms of Rights but
[1:41:49] it's okay for a man to want to marry a
[1:41:51] man a woman a woman and to live like
[1:41:54] that that is not the inspiration of the
[1:41:57] founding fathers that is not the
[1:42:02] inspiration but what has done that
[1:42:04] schools have changed it let me tell you
[1:42:07] something even in the deciding votes on
[1:42:10] those things some years ago when they
[1:42:12] passed that same-sex marriage there in
[1:42:14] the Supreme Court that won all Democrats
[1:42:19] there's conservative judges that were
[1:42:21] right on there that sided right with it
[1:42:23] you know what that shows friends that's
[1:42:25] why it comes back to it it ought to be a
[1:42:27] ring of declaration in your heart that
[1:42:29] here we have no continuing City I am a
[1:42:31] pilgrim and a stranger because there's
[1:42:34] nothing that can stand every nation
[1:42:37] can be shaken this shall be shaken it'll
[1:42:43] fall it'll crumble I don't care how
[1:42:45] stalwart that a person might be
[1:42:47] then they'll under these spirits this is
[1:42:49] not humanity on humanity we are not
[1:42:53] fighting human battles these are demonic
[1:42:55] forces but these demon spirits that are
[1:42:59] present and are influencing and have the
[1:43:01] right away from the government on down
[1:43:03] there is a match for them you and I are
[1:43:06] not a match
[1:43:07] but the Holy Ghost is more than a match
[1:43:11] that's a mighty angel that descendant in
[1:43:14] Revelations 10 yes the same one here
[1:43:18] he's watching over his bride he got one
[1:43:24] foot on the land one foot on the sea
[1:43:28] there ain't gonna be one thing that'll
[1:43:31] rise until I get my people the book has
[1:43:36] been opened the opening of that book the
[1:43:39] inspiration has returned the inspiration
[1:43:43] to come upon the original writing of the
[1:43:46] book amen this is a time of gross
[1:43:50] darkness and people don't know right
[1:43:56] from wrong remember when the Lord Jesus
[1:44:01] come they had Moses writings they had
[1:44:10] Moses writings if you were to make any
[1:44:12] move towards those writings they might
[1:44:13] kill you but yet when he who the
[1:44:17] writings was of come they wanted to kill
[1:44:20] him so I ask you were they preserving
[1:44:24] the writings the letter but the letter
[1:44:29] killeth the spirit giveth life he told
[1:44:34] them searched the preserved documents
[1:44:38] searched the scriptures in them you
[1:44:41] think you have eternal life
[1:44:45] he told him he said you you think I'm
[1:44:48] accusing you but I ain't Moses is
[1:44:51] accusing you he said you don't believe
[1:44:54] his writings oh my we preserve the law
[1:44:58] he said you don't believe him because
[1:45:00] you don't believe my words you see what
[1:45:05] they could not recognize is the
[1:45:07] continuity of God they knew listen they
[1:45:13] knew the history of Moses if you no
[1:45:19] doubt would ask them they could have
[1:45:21] took you on a tour of Moses Moses was
[1:45:23] right here when Moses stood right here
[1:45:24] what they tell us he stood right here he
[1:45:26] said this Moses was right here when
[1:45:28] Moses threw down the but the
[1:45:30] commandments all of those things it was
[1:45:34] all preserved but yet when what was in
[1:45:39] the writings began to be expressed oh no
[1:45:46] no this man takes away from Moses this
[1:45:51] man's a blasphemer in that amazing the
[1:45:54] writings and the words were one in the
[1:45:57] same but yet this man was accused as a
[1:46:02] blasphemer and yet all Jesus was doing
[1:46:04] is saying what he said but he's accused
[1:46:09] as a blasphemer you see it's a lack of
[1:46:12] understanding
[1:46:15] think of this now when we consider those
[1:46:18] words of that Gettysburg Address you
[1:46:24] know I didn't ask him but I stood there
[1:46:27] when that I was thinking on that what
[1:46:30] began to come to my heart was is that
[1:46:32] you might know all these things about
[1:46:35] Lincoln and there's some men and
[1:46:38] friends.i that I've had that I talked
[1:46:40] with that I mean they knew about Lincoln
[1:46:44] matter of fact they had the the guys
[1:46:47] come into the classroom that were using
[1:46:49] all over the nation that looked just
[1:46:50] like E and would recite these guy means
[1:46:52] I'm telling you if you didn't know any
[1:46:53] better you think Lincoln and resurrected
[1:46:56] I'm dead serious right next door to me
[1:46:59] and they would come in and recite and
[1:47:01] whatever more and I thought my goodness
[1:47:02] I begin to think back on that but what
[1:47:05] it was is that even though Lincoln could
[1:47:08] come back to that the founding fathers
[1:47:10] themselves remember they left a chair
[1:47:14] open at the table for the Lord they pray
[1:47:22] do you realize that members of Congress
[1:47:25] every year got a brand new Bible and
[1:47:28] what they did they went through that
[1:47:30] Bible and they wrote within the pages
[1:47:34] they wrote on the corners they wrote all
[1:47:37] through it and then they would give that
[1:47:40] Bible to their children then on January
[1:47:43] 1st they would get a new Bible and they
[1:47:45] would start all over again I'd venture
[1:47:49] to say that those who only know two
[1:47:50] Corinthians have not read the Bible you
[1:47:55] with me how that many quotes look look
[1:47:59] how many quotes of things were men want
[1:48:01] to get things past and they'll quote
[1:48:04] things out of the scripture how many
[1:48:08] quotes were how many things were quoted
[1:48:10] out of the scripture in regards to the
[1:48:12] health care that was passed well there's
[1:48:14] a multitude but they're all out of
[1:48:16] context every one of them is out of the
[1:48:20] original inspiration I'm not here
[1:48:22] friends as I said before this is not a
[1:48:23] political stump speech I'm showing
[1:48:25] looking at this in the in the spiritual
[1:48:27] what was struck my heart is that they
[1:48:29] didn't recognize the one who inspired
[1:48:32] Lincoln where the Prophet to talk about
[1:48:34] George Washington and Abraham Lincoln he
[1:48:37] said these are men who trusted God he
[1:48:41] said they were men who he said your
[1:48:43] character is molded by the things you
[1:48:46] read hello parents the things you read
[1:48:52] brother Samuel they're just children
[1:48:54] they're just kids you better be mindful
[1:48:56] of what they're reading I don't care if
[1:48:58] it come out of school there's many
[1:49:00] committees I said right on at school and
[1:49:02] they would laugh me to scorn because I
[1:49:04] told him I will not permit that book in
[1:49:07] my classroom they could have fined me
[1:49:08] but
[1:49:09] I told him I said the content that is
[1:49:11] suggested in it and the curse words
[1:49:13] that's in it and you try to tell me
[1:49:15] everybody cusses I said I don't cuss my
[1:49:18] family doesn't cuss that is not right
[1:49:27] you better be mindful we need to be
[1:49:30] mindful all of us need to be mindful God
[1:49:34] has given us her brother Samuel I read a
[1:49:36] daily devotional from where why do you
[1:49:43] need more to read God has given us his
[1:49:46] word and that daily devotional what
[1:49:53] inspiration is could even be behind that
[1:49:57] you ought to look at many of them many
[1:50:00] of the daily devotions and inspirations
[1:50:01] on the Christian bookstore shelves it's
[1:50:04] not men and listen even if it was men
[1:50:06] it's got to come by the original
[1:50:07] inspiration but it's women whoa whoa oh
[1:50:13] no one's with the scratching right now
[1:50:16] we're just scratching you see it's
[1:50:19] getting it's getting down into it God he
[1:50:21] has an order but now these thoughts of
[1:50:25] all men are created equal
[1:50:30] there's only one thing that will give
[1:50:32] that gives the woman her right place
[1:50:35] that's the Lord Jesus Christ we as the
[1:50:42] Church of the Living God are looked upon
[1:50:45] as a woman is that right look what the
[1:50:47] greatness of God did he came down and
[1:50:50] gave himself his life for us
[1:50:55] he didn't come down and say you give me
[1:50:57] your heart right now you give me no no
[1:50:59] no he gave his life and he deals with
[1:51:02] your heart that he might win his
[1:51:05] rightful place in our hearts that's the
[1:51:11] kingdom of God
[1:51:13] that's his kingdom they don't know that
[1:51:18] influence that was upon Lincoln's life
[1:51:20] reading
[1:51:24] all of the foxes Book of Martyrs and all
[1:51:27] those things they don't realize that
[1:51:29] stand with me
[1:51:42] remember as we said before here stood
[1:51:44] the Pharisees
[1:51:51] they hold the law but when the Lord
[1:51:53] Jesus came they themselves the Lord
[1:51:58] Jesus told him he said you don't even
[1:52:00] know you don't know what it means you
[1:52:03] don't even understand the law you don't
[1:52:08] you're not in tune with the original
[1:52:09] inspiration you don't know what love and
[1:52:12] mercy you don't know that this is the
[1:52:14] heart of it for centuries you know for
[1:52:25] centuries they've argued about words
[1:52:31] does this word have a certain meaning
[1:52:33] does this word have a certain meaning
[1:52:35] and yet it's not it's not about that I I
[1:52:41] when God will that lets me to look up a
[1:52:43] meaning I look it up but what it is is
[1:52:48] that the Holy Spirit that he would come
[1:52:51] and reveal his word he is the one that
[1:53:00] comes to bring conviction in our hearts
[1:53:04] in our lives what Lincoln mentioned at
[1:53:08] the end of that speech after that battle
[1:53:11] and yet the war wasn't finished but he
[1:53:13] says that from here would come a new
[1:53:15] birth of freedom and as we said last
[1:53:19] week the only truth freedom there really
[1:53:22] is is the new birth of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:28] that's when you have truly been made
[1:53:32] free indeed by the son himself I wonder
[1:53:40] if Lincoln or different ones I wonder if
[1:53:47] they walked into the halls of the
[1:53:50] government Congress
[1:53:54] or other places I wonder if they'd
[1:53:55] recognize it here many times where the
[1:54:01] brand talks about John Wesley Luthor he
[1:54:08] speaks of them and he says if they were
[1:54:13] to come back he said and they would see
[1:54:16] and know what was going on he said they
[1:54:19] would turn over in their graves so he's
[1:54:23] saying that standing here speaking this
[1:54:26] word the city has to come on down even
[1:54:30] to where we're at even into our lives
[1:54:37] there's no Kingdom no Kingdom can stand
[1:54:44] outside of the kingdom of God and that
[1:54:48] begins in the heart of man it begins
[1:54:55] there he writes this is too loud brother
[1:54:57] is is this dead or something I don't
[1:55:00] know I just just turn it down a little
[1:55:02] bit please there is just that Kingdom to
[1:55:07] begin with in our hearts it leads us
[1:55:14] into the change that we're looking for
[1:55:18] it's a witness in our life we don't have
[1:55:21] no continuing City
[1:55:29] you see without there being a change in
[1:55:31] our hearts it's it's like there can be
[1:55:32] an administration listen to me one
[1:55:35] administration can come be a lot of
[1:55:40] things done under this administration
[1:55:42] but another administration enters those
[1:55:45] are the things that are done in
[1:55:46] countermeasures but if that
[1:55:51] administration of the Messiah the Holy
[1:55:55] Ghost the person of Jesus Christ it
[1:56:00] enters into your life then no matter how
[1:56:04] much time changes no matter how many
[1:56:09] other things you wrote no matter how
[1:56:11] your health may deteriorate everything
[1:56:15] else may roll erode and give way
[1:56:18] but that kingdom that has been
[1:56:21] established in your heart by the Holy
[1:56:23] Ghost
[1:56:24] there is nothing can take that away
[1:56:29] nothing this is where his kingdom begins
[1:56:35] and remember his kingdom the kingdom of
[1:56:38] God does not come with observation he
[1:56:44] moves in and he takes over but he's a
[1:56:49] gentleman he rides in deals with our
[1:56:55] life in our heart maybe you're here this
[1:56:57] morning and you have not surrendered
[1:56:58] your heart to him fully you say I
[1:57:03] struggle with this right struggle with
[1:57:05] that I I don't know how be able to do
[1:57:06] this or I don't know how be able to live
[1:57:08] this focus on him you're focusing on the
[1:57:12] wrong thing of what you can do or what
[1:57:14] you can't do that's the wrong focus you
[1:57:16] have to focus on the king himself
[1:57:18] because when the king himself moves into
[1:57:22] your life the attributes of the kingdom
[1:57:25] they come forth it moves out in your
[1:57:30] life the dying what he what he does is
[1:57:34] he takes your life to what it is you're
[1:57:37] longing to be there's no way you can
[1:57:39] have that longing you
[1:57:41] he didn't place it there you couldn't
[1:57:43] have that desire unless he already had
[1:57:45] placed that desire there but he's the
[1:57:47] only one that can make that desire come
[1:57:48] from just a desire to a reality you're
[1:57:55] loving this morning oh lord I want to
[1:57:59] give you my all I want to give you my
[1:58:03] all this preserved it's his keeping
[1:58:06] power it's his life
[1:58:10] it's him guiding it's him directing said
[1:58:15] this to you last week and I can't get
[1:58:18] away from it where we stand right here
[1:58:22] I'm not talking about these grounds
[1:58:25] although there were many sacrificed for
[1:58:29] these grounds even that we stand on but
[1:58:32] I look what we even what we enjoy and
[1:58:36] I'm not just in the natural but what we
[1:58:40] enjoy with what God has given to us this
[1:58:44] morning
[1:58:47] that we could rejoice with in this word
[1:58:55] it's been because of lives that have
[1:59:00] been yielded to his voice I'm not just
[1:59:07] talking about Ministers I'm talking
[1:59:10] about sons and daughters of God I'm
[1:59:14] talking about dads until my mama's I'm
[1:59:16] tell my grandma's and Grandma grandpas
[1:59:19] I'm told my lives that's been dedicated
[1:59:22] for the purpose of the kingdom of God
[1:59:25] that has lived this life faithfully
[1:59:28] their life their life has been lived as
[1:59:33] stepping-stones
[1:59:34] of God's grace as the Prophet said it
[1:59:38] when he stood there in that prayer
[1:59:40] breakfast out there in Phoenix and he
[1:59:43] looked around he's seen the older
[1:59:45] Minister setting there he said I think
[1:59:49] God he said for every one of them see
[1:59:53] her brother Samuel maybe there's many of
[1:59:55] them at that time they weren't seeing
[1:59:57] the light but they've seen the light
[1:59:58] that they were ordained to see and they
[2:00:01] walked faithfully in it let me tell you
[2:00:02] something
[2:00:03] we'll have a greater account if we don't
[2:00:05] walk fully in the light that God has
[2:00:07] given to us they they lived their life
[2:00:12] they ran their part of the race that
[2:00:14] baton was handed to them and they were
[2:00:16] in it faithfully they took it and they
[2:00:18] ran it this gospel was moved on this
[2:00:21] this message where you and I stand it
[2:00:23] just didn't it didn't stop and hop from
[2:00:25] 1965 to 2018 there are lives that were
[2:00:28] yielded under the training of the Holy
[2:00:31] Ghost
[2:00:34] but back no not many years a lot of
[2:00:37] bumps in the road and a lot of things
[2:00:39] but you know what God is faithful the
[2:00:43] preserving of his outworking is him he
[2:00:47] sends the messenger it is his message
[2:00:50] and he is the one that fulfills it
[2:00:54] because as the prophet pointed us over
[2:00:57] and over he said the true messenger the
[2:01:00] true prophet of the out not that he
[2:01:02] wasn't a true prophet he's pointing us
[2:01:04] to the prophet he said is the Holy Ghost
[2:01:07] he's the working you see this is not a
[2:01:10] stopping leveling off it's a
[2:01:12] continuation what was spoken as Paul
[2:01:16] himself could say a dispensation of the
[2:01:19] gospel has been given to me for you that
[2:01:23] you might fulfill
[2:01:28] I say when we look back
[2:01:33] we count those lives that's going on
[2:01:35] before I ask each of us I ask us to
[2:01:39] really think deeply here this morning
[2:01:41] what is our lives paving a way for what
[2:01:50] is our lives paving the way for it I
[2:01:55] want to be found paving away for his
[2:01:59] coming
[2:02:01] that's why I want to be found the brand
[2:02:05] was very clear it wasn't laying a
[2:02:08] platform for another man to come on to
[2:02:10] see another man that would rise up in
[2:02:13] all the people and wrought rally around
[2:02:15] no no no and this is God's already sent
[2:02:17] his messenger and the messenger calls us
[2:02:20] to rally around Jesus Christ you with me
[2:02:27] so he laid a platform for who who was
[2:02:29] the platform laid for the platform was
[2:02:32] laid for the Lord Jesus Christ that he
[2:02:37] might work in his body
[2:02:40] I say Lord
[2:02:45] I don't know how many years I don't know
[2:02:46] how much time say brother Sam you're a
[2:02:49] young man thank you
[2:02:52] I still don't have a promise of tomorrow
[2:02:54] and neither do you but every moment
[2:02:57] every day let our lives be a heist you
[2:03:00] think of your homes think of your
[2:03:01] families think of the coming of the Lord
[2:03:05] if there is another generation I'm not
[2:03:08] saying there is but are you but if there
[2:03:11] is a tomorrow may our lives people way
[2:03:23] Oh Lord Jesus
[2:03:29] we stand here Oh God a sacred ground
[2:03:33] Lord holy
[2:03:36] Lord Jesus were your presence where you
[2:03:40] had come and you would speak to our life
[2:03:42] this ground is just like any other
[2:03:45] ground but Lord as it was there spoken
[2:03:50] you made yourself known upon that holy
[2:03:53] mountain or God as your prophet drew our
[2:03:56] attention that he said it was and then
[2:03:58] the mountain was holy it was a holy God
[2:04:01] upon that mountain Oh Lord God I pray
[2:04:06] for each life in every heart Lord O God
[2:04:11] I pray that the words that I've been
[2:04:15] expressed this morning the Lord maybe
[2:04:18] find their way Lord in our hearts I pray
[2:04:24] God if there would be any heart or any
[2:04:26] life Lord that living below that
[2:04:29] standard of where that you have called
[2:04:30] and ordained for them to live Lord I
[2:04:32] pray God this morning that they would
[2:04:36] yield Lord to your hand Lord and from
[2:04:40] their heart they would Lord make that
[2:04:42] prayer say Lord take me O God to where
[2:04:45] the longing of my heart Lord is and that
[2:04:48] is to be by your side Oh God Lord Jesus
[2:04:54] how we see it so clear how many
[2:04:58] historical documents how many words how
[2:05:01] many monuments how many memorials Lord
[2:05:06] all around us through Oh God
[2:05:15] we want to be Lord that living memorial
[2:05:19] life a living image Lord where your word
[2:05:23] is preserved in our hearts then no
[2:05:29] matter where Lord God no matter where we
[2:05:33] are we thank you Lord that life within
[2:05:37] us Lord it's not I live but Christ that
[2:05:42] liveth in me as you said the works that
[2:05:45] I do shall you do also and greater works
[2:05:49] than these shall you do for I go unto my
[2:05:52] father all Lord Jesus grant the needs I
[2:05:59] pray of your children this morning Lord
[2:06:03] inspiration the Lord that has been given
[2:06:07] Lord that same Holy Spirit Lord here
[2:06:12] this morning Lord God to rule our hearts
[2:06:14] Lord to you Lord these things Lord from
[2:06:19] our heart Lord sometimes things seems so
[2:06:21] harsh and sometimes can seem rude and
[2:06:24] cutting but Oh God
[2:06:26] the heart behind it Lord God is the
[2:06:29] desire or God that our lives Lord would
[2:06:32] walk free and clear let us not be
[2:06:34] overcome Lord with a drunkenness lord of
[2:06:37] this age in this life Lord but may we
[2:06:40] walk Oh God
[2:06:43] intoxicated with your presence
[2:06:48] inspiration of the Holy Spirit Lord
[2:06:51] knowing that these things that we see
[2:06:54] and we hear taking place around us or
[2:06:58] God we've been given direction to lift
[2:07:01] up our head for our Redemption draweth
[2:07:03] nigh Oh God our eyes it's fixed upon you
[2:07:10] Lord Jesus Lord God we see everything
[2:07:15] the Lord everything Lord around us
[2:07:19] crumbling crumbling well god there's
[2:07:24] they've reached for band-aids and gods
[2:07:27] and all sorts of teeth to try to put
[2:07:29] things together but God there's nothing
[2:07:33] can put it back together but there's got
[2:07:37] to come a complete renovation as your
[2:07:41] prophet declared it Lord when he stood
[2:07:44] there Lord and he said if there's one
[2:07:45] funeral that I want to preach it's a
[2:07:48] funeral to this world that that new
[2:07:53] heavens and earth would come forth it
[2:07:57] shall be a millennium Alleluia a time
[2:08:01] immemorial Lord thousand years honeymoon
[2:08:06] a gathering Lord God of your children
[2:08:10] Lord rapture Lord God we will sit down
[2:08:17] at the wedding supper
[2:08:22] veterans will set across from veterans
[2:08:29] soldiers Oh God and you will come by and
[2:08:39] you will wipe the tears from my eyes
[2:08:44] I can't say Lord that I can explain it
[2:08:47] because I can't how that we will have
[2:08:49] memories of your works here in this
[2:08:54] earth but yet you will not leave us in
[2:08:58] sorrow and sadness
[2:09:06] part of our I don't understand it Lord
[2:09:09] but I just believe it how that our
[2:09:11] memory those things will be so
[2:09:14] illuminated and so changed in that time
[2:09:16] we will not have the same memory that we
[2:09:19] have now we'll remember Lord you're
[2:09:22] working but we will not remember
[2:09:30] any Lord that hasn't made it the Lord
[2:09:35] our focus in this hour because you know
[2:09:42] them that are yours no matter what the
[2:09:45] situation might look like no matter how
[2:09:48] bleak Lord Lord God you are still God no
[2:09:56] matter Lord Jesus if they win astray you
[2:09:58] are still God and Lord Jesus we hold
[2:10:04] that token Lord with unwavering faith
[2:10:07] our confidence Lord God is in you Lord
[2:10:10] Jesus but the same warlord had brought
[2:10:13] that same experience a transformation in
[2:10:16] our life you're the same God to do it
[2:10:21] Lord God in the lives of our loved one's
[2:10:25] children Lord
[2:10:31] we got a good question your heart went
[2:10:33] let's you just make it known to the Lord
[2:10:34] maybe there's a loved one maybe there's
[2:10:36] someone it's on your heart right now
[2:10:39] what God we lift him in prayer we all
[2:10:44] have loved ones we have different ones
[2:10:45] thought friends different ones Lord that
[2:10:48] we've worked with or went to school with
