========================================

get my finger in it you know or a different thing but all of that together goes to make that cake there's experiences in every one of our life there's some experiences where we made the wrong decision but yet by god's grace if we can say lord teach me lord god does not come and put us down but he'll come and he'll instruct us to now what the enemy thought oh my i'll just enshroud their life but instead it becomes a teaching and a principle and serves as discernment i believe we're here to learn from those things brother branham would stand in the life story over and over again and he would say i trust he said that you're able to take my mistakes as stepping stones of god's grace for your life and brethren would take us into joshua and moses and he would say joshua learned from moses mistakes he never sent a bunch of men but he only sent two see it's a growing maturity is growing it's learning it comes to a place to where it's no longer the same maybe the same mistakes that are being made we're never going to be perfect but we begin to recognize when things arise and we can recognize our weakness because our weakness it isn't ever going to be to a good that weakness is gone in your life but where you rule over it you keep it covered with the blood of jesus christ and that weakness part of it you have nothing to prove to the enemy except submit yourself unto god the bible said submit yourself unto god and then resist the devil and he will flee from you now well we just keep going here i don't know where all that but we just keep going now let's look here in this of ephesians 5 verse 21 and i want to continue to look at this honor in the home and we'll just see how the lord will help us here tonight in ephesians 5 21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god and i want you to keep that word submitting here for just a little bit submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of god notice in the fear of god it's not even dealing with whether the person is worthy or not are you catching me in the fear of god so where is our submission based in the fear of god [Music] you see this is why brother branham would say if you can't respect the man you respect the office that he holds you see bill abrams says now he goes he quotes the scripture the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom now that don't mean that you're afraid of him that means you are giving him respects and reverence he's talking about god and when you respect god you fear god so brother brahms tying this together respect and fear because this is when fear is spoken of remember the fear of the lord is clean it's clean it's not a slavish or a tormenting thing that's not the fear of god the fear of god is a reverence and a respect so notice you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to do it so that fear or that reverence is driven by love you love him therefore you have no desire to do wrong that's been removed from from your life your desire is to please him it's just like when if you if your day has become so busy with things and sometimes your best laid plans your day can become so busy with things and before you know it you think where did the day go what i had planned to do this and plan to do this and you know sometimes how the day will go and and you and you look within that and you think lord i i haven't even really had the time to really to speak to you and be just like you've just walked by and maybe you've just ignored him and not that you've done it intentionally but you come back into those places and look when we come back into those places don't let the devil beat you up on that just come back into it and recognize say you know what paul said pray without ceasing i know target may not be well for some of you target may not be the ideal place to pray in walmart and whatever more but you can pray wherever you're at you can pray wherever you're at pray without ceasing it just had things as things just coming on your heart meditation is part of prayer it's part of keeping and just meditating and and you know as you meditate on him he draws an eye his presence begins to come and just to draw nice so so don't allow the enemy to just isolate and make prayer some stale formal traditional thing no prayer it's just like you can talk to your spouse it don't matter if you're on the patio don't matter if you're in in the living room it don't matter if you're in the kitchen it don't matter if you're in the garage are you with me at times that my wife has come out and talked to me and i've been out there in the landscaping and i have dirt all over i've got grease all over my hands and i'll tease and say honey give me a hug and i've got grease all over my hands but it don't matter she can she'll come and talk to me out there sometimes i'll tell her hey i want you can i get you a chair out here and here's the shade let's just sit right here just talk to me well i'm out here but you see it doesn't matter where you're at you can always talk to the lord he loves to hear from you he loves to hear your voice in the song of solomon chapter 2 verse 14 he says my dove for sweet is thy voice he loves to hear from you and i as his children so don't let the enemy beat you up on that just allow god said god teach me let me make every point in value of my day amen oh my as long as brother bram says i fear my mother i fear my wife i fear my church i fear all of god's servants unless i should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way i fear the people i fear the people of the city unless i should do something wrong that would cause them to think that i wasn't a christian notice where the what this fear or respect is about it's not about him it's about others i i fear my wife i fear the church i respect take the word respect the fear is too much take the word respect that's what this word fear means he respects him so much that i don't want to do anything that would cause them to stumble i don't want to do anything that would cause them to think that i'm not a christian i want to but let's take the contrast to this rather i want to respect them in such a way that i want the desires that they would see jesus christ and that god would help me to be sensitive to know where there's a need going on where something needs maybe to a word of encouragement or something that maybe is being done and just say you know what this stops right here because why it's troubling it might be troubling that person or that individual or troubling a situation is that right i mean paul spoke of these things even when he we and we covered this sometime where paul was talking about member he says is if meat makes my brother to offend then i will not eat meat as long as the world stands who is that about that was about the other brother you see once once the love of god has come into our life it delivers us from the selfishness of the first birth but we've got to battle every day are you with me we've got a battle every day that's why we have to take up our cross daily and crucify the flesh because new life has come in now there is a war now there's a contrast now there there is opposition but greater is he that's in you and to remember he that is in us has already overcome that thing amen so brother baby says you before you can have respect you've got to have fear and god he demands it he demands respect god does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect so in ephesians 5 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord now notice how the pattern is going submitting the very first verse we read submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of the lord respect right no doubt through this room here there are there is some that we could say you know what i had respect my respect the boss for the office they hold but as far as the person there's nothing wrong with that but to have the respect remember when paul we we taught on the servants and masters and paul said do as doing it unto the lord paul said if you want help saying i don't know from this person if i can't paul said then put it like this put the face of jesus on him and i'm doing this as unto the lord my brother brother samuel i i got such a wonderful thought of the face of jesus put the hoffman's head in front and look why submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the lord so who who is it it's not because this man is such a great man and yet no doubt in your eyes he's a great man but you do it as unto the lord because there's going to be times you may not think he's so great right welcome home they're going to be times you you don't agree with his decision hey look at abraham and sarah abraham and sarah it wasn't er look brother brand what did brother man call abraham and sarah the sweethearts of the romeo bible juliet had nothing on abraham and sarah but brother brown would call them the sweethearts of the bible and brother brown would also tell us that even within the parts of it to where serie sorry i had there was a part about it that she needed deliverance only god could bring that deliverance from the scary eye abraham knowing the word he couldn't say sorry i let's get that i out of sarai but remember abram had to also get the breath of god on his life so the breath of god in his life would take care of the eye in her life oh my how can we glory in ourselves you can't glory in ourselves it's god that does the word it's god that doesn't work in our marriages in our homes it's not you and i taking something and saying well this is the word and glory to god i'm gonna bring it to pass you can't do that it's when the word is made known to us god makes known his word that we might submit to that word and say be it unto me lord according to that word and if we'll give ourselves to the word the authority and the transforming power is in the word to be released to bring the word to past in our life so it moves from thought to print to flesh and you and i step back and say wow lord what grace and god steps back and says behold it is good because it's him it's him so abraham even when you look at that with abraham and sarah sweethearts of the bible and brother brahm would tell us right there uh in in genesis 18 when uh the visitation of of of almighty god was coming down to take upon his he took upon flesh but not under the anointing of redeemer but god would come down and they were going to receive a visitation from god uh in such a way it was going to bring such a an impact and a change in sarah's life oh my man i tell you what you see what invited that abraham yielding to god abraham himself can't you see the responsibility as a husband as a man to be yielded to almighty god to invite the presence of god into the home into the marriage because a man can't change this a man can do that this is god god's the one when the bible says marriage is honorable it's the oldest institution in the bible and there's only one who truly knows how to bring about all the realities and all the blessings and all the glory and all the joy and that's him who instituted it in the beginning is that right and here they're having this you know brother brahman tells you know they're i like how brother john lafontaine and i said heated fellowship in the tent you know heated fellowship it's amazing sometimes how we use words to kind of sweeten it over we just disagree but within that there was a visitation coming on the road and there they received the visitation even though they were sweethearts of the bible they still dealt with this parts within the humanity but god gave grace through it all then when you can see even in those parts sarah didn't go off in her own thing there are things that sarah said or sarah spoke or remember even when sarah when she's still under syria she pressed her way and said take hagar you know she's going to tell abraham this is how the will of god is going to be accomplished every time that happens it always ends out in an ishmaelite you see that's the same way it is the a church without the leadership of the holy spirit what does it produce ishmael light is that right resistant and wild against the word are you with me but that's why that's why it can be a man standing in preaching the word and still if it's not the holy spirit anointed in that man's life and that man himself has met god on the sacred sands of god's grace then that's still a dominating female spirit because it's not it's not god's correct way of leading his church god yes he has man there to leave but it's not the man that's really leading the church it's the holy spirit delivering the word and the word is what is leading you and i it's the word that is feeding you and i it's the same pillar fire that moses got all of his leadership from that same pillar of fire has returned to the church of the living god and we're not strangers no more we are thoroughly acquainted as adopted sons and daughters of god that the presence of almighty god is right here in our midst and right in our homes right in our lives we have access to the holy of holies [Applause] wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the lord let me just i want to read this definition and i am i'm keeping track of time up here but notice this this word submit it's the word hupatasa and i want you to notice and what i'm going to read don't read ahead of me now what i'm going to read nowhere is submission the result of force are you hearing me it's nowhere the result of force here's the word it means to arrange under to subordinate to subject put in subjection here's the that part to subject one's self obey that's really the heart of it to subject oneself obey to submit to one's control to yield to one's admonition or advice to obey to be subject now go to the next part so the first part deals with military coming under a leadership but in non-military can you go down to that line in non-military use it was a voluntary attitude somebody say voluntary attitude thanks for volunteering a voluntary attitude of giving in you how does the new birth come first starts with the right mental attitude is that right when god spoke to mary he first had to get her mind lined up with the word brother says in spoken words original seed it doesn't pass the mind but the mind opens up and receives the word and it's the word not our thoughts the word that has life in it and as we open up and receive the word it's the word that has life and the word comes down into the womb but what does it start with the right mental attitude so all to get in the right mental attitude and i think we can we know even as across the board here as families and things like that that's sometimes before it has to be before you can anything at all it's got to get things in the right mental attitude is that right sometimes over and over it isn't like whoo you know we were married we said i do and i do and i do and i do and i do and i read off all of my promises and i'll always be the first to admit that i'm the one who's wrong and how are they always pray guarding give them grace to live the vows that they've made because you're going to need grace is that right you're going to need grace to live out those vows so it isn't just something that just well right here it said i do i do there's a commitment there's an old all of those things that that are made but it takes the grace of god within it that even at times to come to a place over and over and over again of a right mental attitude i know i know i i know as we talk right here there's sometimes when you come into situations and you're no different than me and sometimes we come into a situation you think my how how are you going to get out of this how are we going to get through this no maybe none of the rest of you build bridges maybe you just do the kind and say ah the bridge will be there when we get there if not we'll just go through the water then some of us are like ordering home depot on those hey bring the wood we're going to build the bridge here we're going to do this and you you don't talk about building bridge we've got it we've got i got to figure all this out i got to put all this in line you know and god will use that when it's surrendered to him you see god doesn't knock those things it's knocking it out of our life but god teaches us to yield those things in our life god needs those different things just as much as he needs those who just say don't worry about it when any time when we get there it'll be there we'll walk right over god we need those times so a voluntary attitude of giving in and cooperating and assuming responsibility and carrying a birth so nowhere nowhere nowhere is this of force nowhere nowhere is this nowhere is this a scripture that is used to demean or to try to put someone and say you're to be in subjection that is the wrong spirit because the right spirit brings this out amen we're not here tonight because under threat we're here tonight because we love him we've not been threatened or if you don't come here we're gonna take your name off whatever it's on we're gonna you're here because you love him here you hear sometimes and here you are some of you no doubt you know like my son you you know you haven't eaten or eaten or have you properly say it or here you are tired you're thinking man i'm trying to press through everything i can do to do that but you're not here because you're under a force or a threat it's one thing to be encouraged to come to the house of god because of the benefits sometimes it's as the scripture said forget not his benefits sometimes we need to be reminded of his benefits it's part of the benefit package god has a way it's just how god does it when believers come together and he speaks to our heart and our lives are edified in his presence but we're not here because we are made to come here we're here because we love him that's what it's all about now let me just let me just have i i'm watching it here you probably think how are you watching it don't worry i got two things in front of me here i know when this goes red i know what that means but it seems like i'm disobeying it right now let me just let let me cover this here and we'll try to try we'll tie it up here brother batman the fat tyrant church age i want to read this quote bill graham says now a woman is not meant to have an iron disposition let me just let me just just speak on this a little bit because when we look at this statement here there can be things no doubt that you have experienced or a person could experience in their life that would cause certain things from wounds to scars to form now once you remember a scar is a sign of healing are you with me it's a sign healing has come but sometimes the memories of different things sometimes it's a memory of something that you know maybe as a woman that maybe seen all that seen all her life was men who were who were not reputable at all are you hearing me not in other words has not seen a real true image of what a real true man is and there's things that maybe has taken place that has shaped and put certain things in a certain place that god did not desire it to be but here's the here's the good thing the holy spirit working by the love of god can begin to take in that life as that life can can recognize that and say lord mold me and shape me lord jesus because let me just say this to you let me say this very clearly there's not one female and yes when you're born you're either male or female there's not one female that enters in to this world from birth with an iron disposition sometimes the things that we end up we deal with is previous moldings sometimes the things that even we deal with even after god has done such a deep work in our life is sometimes we're still emptying out of wrong teaching are you with me i'm talking about things that get into that spirit realm in the conscience where people a person can't let this go because if they don't do this and if i don't do this i'm not a real christian and yet it doesn't line up with the word at all you understand what i'm saying you could take different ones man if if they don't if they don't they don't speak in tongues every service oh they're defeated if i don't do this every i'm defeated you see it becomes something to try to feed their victory victory is not fed in that way that's not victory victory is in knowing that my redeemer liveth and he's living inside of my life he's changed my life and with that victory in my life there is nothing nothing can separate me from the love of christ that's real victory that's a real victory day in our life so brotherhood says see according to the holy scripture she is according to the holy scripture see here's the standard now is to be submissive to the mountain look at the word submissive think what we just read that is commanded of her see the word the word issues a command and a command and a demand is not the same thing it's not the same thing it is god's direction for our life woman who is truly female that's a big statement all female will be of that disposition not a doormat so this comes back to that's a natural attribute within within even the smallest the baby the little girl all of that that's naturally within there nobody had to take those as mothers and those of you that are grandmothers now and you know your grandchildren are innocent and everything they do uh you know how it is nobody had to put that in you and say hey come on you're to be a mom you're to be a mom you're gonna be a mom you're to be a mom you're it was within you there's things begin to stir that out even as you had your baby doll or maybe you had you know a little puppy around the house when and don't go trying to put quotes on me on that one you had you know you're just trying to mother something around as a little there's an attribute that was within you and in god's own choosing his season and his time his will that attribute is released by god for the glory of god that in all things god himself might be glorified it's god who arranges all that together and even in lies oh glory even in lives that the enemy wanted to shatter the enemy wanted to break down of things we find in the scripture we find things in the scripture you can take the woman at the well you could say ruth the morbidity you can even take in the script even in the message or brother random the spirit of god countless numbers of times when there were sisters and women of god that had experienced things in their life but god in his grace would come down and loosen the hole that was there in that subconscious realm it would break the whole that was hindering them from expressing what was really a desire to express in their life and god is never defeated let's say he's never defeated there's no challenge too big for god there's no complex too big for god there's no past situation too big for god there's no previous molding too big for god that god says whoa this is too big for me but god's got confidence in the life working in the sea it will produce because why that dna as a son and daughter of god is greater than your family tree hallelujah it's the tree of life the man tree that we've been born of not a doormat not a doormat is that up there okay thank you such a patch he said yeah that's there god bless you sister fancy i love that not a doormat see submission is not a force deal amen submission is actually the glory from a husband that has submitted himself and now that same glory is reflected in the wife and through the wife that's honor not a doormat no real male boy these are some good words right now no real male no real female don't post that huh no real male makes a female a doormat is that right no no no she would never because you see when god when god opened up the side of adam when he was going to take a bride he never went down here and opened his foot right he didn't open his foot because he's not to be walked on but god came right here and he opened up and he took the part closest to his heart because it would be that that that coming that that moving together that that impression it fits that mold perfectly you look back and look at things and i've told my wife and i've talked about this many times i said i am so glad for the leadership of the holy spirit because i said god knows exactly how to influence us how to direct us how to bring things about because to me there is nobody else for me for my wife outside of the lord i mean i mean she she knows how to deal with me she knows how to say you're hungry come on let's get some deeds come on you're hungry it's time to break the fast let's go so you know she knows how to to work within those things she knows how to to minister and to care god put us together in that way the same way god put you together i'm saying this now because even at that time when we stood here in 1998 on this platform right now there is no way in the world that i recognize that to the fullness at that moment no way but as time goes on as as things i tell you the love just grows deeper and deeper and deep and you recognize oh my this is the sovereignty of god it was god it wasn't me choosing and saying well i'm gonna take her away it was god influencing my life god influencing her life and if god thought if she thought i was handsome god did a good job of influencing her because even at that time i had see-through hair not a doormat no real male makes a female a doormat let's just close here but she will want to be under authority and not rule over the mail for he is the head of the house but sammy what what are we seeing here responsibility because she must have authority to submit to leadership provides a place of rest a place of submission a place of confidence she will want to be under authority don't we want to be under the authority of the lord amen sometimes as his word comes and it cuts sometimes he has to he doesn't always come and tell us yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes lord i want this and i want that yes yes yes yes yes yes okay that credit card's max here take this one yes yes yes yes yes yes god doesn't do that and i'm not just i'm not i'm not making light of shopping because sometimes there's men that's just as bad but it's not all yes sometimes god he god loves us so much he'll tell us no he'll tell us no now let's just be honest brother doug our flesh rejoices more in the yeses than it does the nose but brother aaron the longer we serve him we begin to recognize when he says no that's just as much love isn't that right brother dave it's just as much love when he says no as when he says yes i don't need to know why he said no i don't need to know that i didn't know if he said no is something that he sees it may not even be something that's sinful he can just see that will not be for my good god is always interested in our best interest that's his love that's his care for our lives so when i look at this i see such a great responsibility that's laid before us as husbands and to live and to have have that that display because what's real authority what's real authority as a son of god not rules but it's the word it's the image of that word that life living out in our lives and remember don't don't compare yourself to one another just yield and let that word image and be certain that that word image is reflecting through your life and if there's anything that's hindering that reflection die to it die to it that the word can be reflected because what is the wife really as she's submitting as when she submits to the husband as unto the lord i think what greater thing can be but to see the lord and yet there can be times that a person doesn't see the lord whatsoever and then this is where the other part comes in that as bill braham says in the message respects if you can't respect the person you respect the office that they hold that's why the scripture says submitting yourselves unto one another in the fear of the lord you love him amen and i'm just i'll just stop here we'll pick this up lord willing next week and keep on we just got a little ways and i know i took some time to speak to you beforehand but i'll just i'm just going to be honest with you as your pastor over the years i can tell you how i've prayed and i've never stopped praying i've continued to ask god lord make me a better husband make me a better father make me a better pastor make me a better brother to my brothers and my sisters better servant when i say make me help me show me what's lacking help me teach me because there's growth and i can say i can say this i say this before you there's a lot of things that god and i don't say this it's not elevating me it's things that what god has shown me oh i that's why many times i look back on certain things and i try to speak of these things even as a council and things like that because i know the grace that's come to me that god has helped me and things that is just so blessed our home but what if i had been a person to say i don't need anybody to teach me where would our home be today where would our home be where would this church be today but when a man is born of the holy spirit he receives the inside teacher and one of the sure evidences is he can be taught by the word he can be corrected he can be he can he because his what's the desire he delights in the word always desiring when he can see the word is put here to put ourselves under that word lord forgive me see that's the part that corresponds as the bride of jesus christ in our lives to come under the authority of that word it's not god demanding it but his love it it unfolds that word and in the tremendous how god will come around and bring correction and it comes with such love this is why paul said speaking the truth in love that we grow up into him in all things we need the truth spoken but we need it spoken in love is that right because it's god's grace because it at the end of the day when we as we're uh looking into the word all musicians brother brian come as we're looking into the word and when conviction strikes our heart i want to move into that word brother drake when there's things that i don't see that's exactly right and i can say oh god i'm falling short there lord help me lord jesus help me the lord i want to grow in that particular area i want to i want to move on lord with you i don't want to make excuses for things but when that word shows up things in my life you know what that's god telling me samuel there's a greater liberty for you there's greater liberty for you so there's not one of us that's here tonight that's perfect in ourselves but tonight this is our confession i'm not what i used to be not what i want to be i've maybe got that all mixed up i'm not what i want to be not what i ought to be but i thank god i'm not what i used to be what's happened something someone has got a hold of your life and has changed you what did that the love of god to where your desire is to please him he can deal with your heart in a prayer closet he can deal with your heart anywhere right here you can deal with your life and there's a desire to please him that's discerning the love of god let's just pray could we heavenly father we love you tonight lord i pray that god these words lord that you've spoken to our hearts just a few moments lord of teaching oh god i pray that father that you'll just just move lord in our hearts you know each and every need you know us lord your god we want to be better christians lord we want to be better husbands better fathers lord the sisters lord say i want to be a better wife a better mother oh god i pray that lord you'll always come or you're invited lord come teach us lord show us lord more and more and more lord help us lord i pray god to have a heart that's tender surrendered and submissive to you lord jesus we love you we know we're we're not here tonight out of force we're not here out of force we're here by love divine it's love love that has drawn us love that reached out brought conviction to our lives lord that as everything begins to move in motion and repentance and walking into water the baptism and it's the love of god moving in our life lord is your prophet said it's so simple he said the more that we love as we've fallen in love how the world loses its hold that's the reality lord with every child of god here tonight lord born of the holy spirit having the seal of the living god in their life it's because lord that we've fallen in love with you it was not our love it was your love we love him because he first loved us so lord it's not us loving you with our own love that would fail that's unacceptable but it's loving you with your own love that has been received and brought about a change in our life where the holds of the world have been dismantled and now coming right back out of our life is a reflection of that same love so what you are beholding is a work of your redemptive love in our life oh god [Music] thank you lord jesus thank you for loving me lord thank you for loving me lord thank you for loving my brothers and sisters lord thank you precious lord jesus thank you father we love you lord this is our desire lord to be under the authority of this word we love you lord father bless your children tonight lord as we yield ourselves to the word that we've even heard here tonight and we say like mary be it unto me lord according to that word teach
