[35:32] I want to read verses 14-
[35:56] 18 as Moses lifted up the serpent in the
[35:59] wilderness even so must the son of man
[36:01] be lifted up that whosoever believeth in
[36:04] him should not perish but have eternal
[36:06] life for God so loved the world that he
[36:09] gave his only begotten son that
[36:11] whosoever believeth in him should not
[36:14] perish but have everlasting life for God
[36:17] sent not his son into the world to
[36:18] condemn the world but that the world
[36:21] through him might be saved he that
[36:23] believeth on him is not condemned but he
[36:26] that believeth not is condemned already
[36:28] because he ha not believed in the name
[36:31] of the only begotten Son of God you may
[36:34] be
[36:42] seated what I'd like to speak on tonight
[36:45] I uh I know
[36:48] it's would probably be just review for
[36:51] many of you here
[36:53] tonight and hopefully that uh it will be
[36:57] a help to the young people and that it
[37:01] maybe be a help to you maybe even in
[37:03] your
[37:04] witnessing what I want to speak on
[37:06] tonight and I'll just probably just get
[37:09] an introduction of this and we have to
[37:11] finish it up on Sunday but is the
[37:14] importance of understanding serpent
[37:17] seed the importance of understanding
[37:19] serpent
[37:22] seed turn with me if you would to
[37:24] Numbers chapter 21
[37:39] now what we read from
[37:42] John that
[37:44] was the
[37:46] Fulfillment of him bruising the
[37:48] Serpent's
[37:51] head but now I want to read something
[37:54] here from numbers ch 21: 4-9
[38:00] and they journeyed from Mount or by the
[38:03] way of the Red Sea to Compass the land
[38:05] of Edom and the soul of the people were
[38:08] much discouraged because of the
[38:11] way and the people spake against God and
[38:13] against Moses wherefore have he brought
[38:16] us up out of Egypt to die in the
[38:19] wilderness for there is no bread neither
[38:22] is there any water and our soul Loth
[38:24] this light
[38:26] bread and and the Lord sent fiery
[38:28] serpents among the people and they bit
[38:30] the people and much of the people of
[38:32] Israel died therefore the people came to
[38:35] Moses said we have sinned for we have
[38:37] spoke against the Lord and against thee
[38:40] pray unto the Lord that he take away the
[38:42] serpents from us Moses prayed for the
[38:45] people and the Lord said unto Moses make
[38:47] thee a fiery serpent set it upon a pole
[38:50] and it shall come to pass that everyone
[38:52] that is bitten when he lookth upon it
[38:54] shall live and Moses made a serpent of
[38:57] brass and put it on a pole and it came
[38:59] to pass that if a serpent had bitten any
[39:01] man when he beheld The Serpent of brass
[39:04] he
[39:05] lived
[39:08] now it's
[39:11] strange brother B said you might wonder
[39:14] as children of the Gospel how could the
[39:16] serpent represent
[39:18] Christ in this particular part of the
[39:22] scriptures but on the on this journey
[39:25] they had
[39:28] spoken against
[39:30] Moses and they were brother B said they
[39:32] were chatting against Moses and they
[39:36] sinned and God sent these fiery serpents
[39:39] in and and if you notice they asked
[39:43] Moses to pray that God remove him but
[39:45] God didn't remove the
[39:46] serpents but instead he commanded Moses
[39:49] to make a serpent of brass and put it
[39:52] upon a pole that all that got bitten
[39:54] could look at that and when they looked
[39:57] they
[39:59] live why would a snake represent Christ
[40:02] brother Bram said well because the snake
[40:05] the serpent itself represented sin
[40:08] already
[40:10] judged God judged the snake in the
[40:12] Garden of Eden he give him his judgment
[40:15] there took his legs off him made him
[40:18] down from a human form and put him on a
[40:22] level see the snake the serpent to begin
[40:26] with was was not a
[40:28] reptile the Bible said he was a beast
[40:31] the most subtle of all the beasts of the
[40:33] field he walked like a man in everything
[40:35] the most subtle but the curse cursed him
[40:39] and taken away his subtleness or his
[40:41] Beauty and throwed him on the ground and
[40:44] put him on his belly to
[40:45] crawl so the serpent that was on the
[40:48] brass pole represented sin already
[40:53] judged the pole represented the cross
[41:00] so it represented sin already judged by
[41:03] the
[41:06] cross questions and answers brother bam
[41:08] said the woman's
[41:10] seed which was Christ Mary brought forth
[41:13] Christ and the serpent seed which was
[41:15] Cain come down to Judas es scariot there
[41:20] was both Jesus and Judas incarnated
[41:22] right there God and the devil on the
[41:25] cross of Calvary there was four people
[41:28] diing there was a thief on each side of
[41:30] Jesus and Judas hung himself on a
[41:32] sycamore tree which is a cross curse is
[41:35] he that hangeth on a tree there was one
[41:38] Thief that said if thou be the Son of
[41:40] God take us down the other said Lord we
[41:44] do justly we we getting punished but you
[41:48] done nothing remember me when you come
[41:50] into your kingdom and Jesus said today
[41:53] shalt thou be with me in Paradise there
[41:56] was Jesus the the gospel preacher
[41:58] preaching on the cross there was Satan
[42:01] going back to Hell taking with him the
[42:03] seed of the serpent the
[42:05] unbeliever there was God going back to
[42:09] Heaven taking with him the repented
[42:11] sinner the seed of the woman it was not
[42:15] the seed of the devil it was the seed of
[42:17] the serpent the serpent had a seed the
[42:20] Bible said it had a seed and it still
[42:23] exists today the seed of the serpent so
[42:26] much
[42:29] now I'm not going to go so much
[42:33] into uh explaining serpent seed but just
[42:38] for a
[42:40] moment we know that in the garden it
[42:43] wasn't
[42:45] apples we know that we know that the
[42:47] serpent was the closest thing to
[42:50] man and we know that uh that the Bible
[42:55] says that Adam knew his wife and she
[42:56] bear son and called his name Cain then
[42:59] she bear another son and called his name
[43:02] Abel and we know that Adam called her
[43:06] Eve after this because he said she was
[43:09] the mother of all living but it never
[43:12] did say that Adam was the father of all
[43:14] living there's no scripture that ever
[43:16] says that and so I believe it's in uh
[43:21] the 3r chapter 20th verse something like
[43:24] that it's where it says she was the
[43:26] mother mother of all living and if there
[43:31] if there is a significance to that
[43:33] scripture being said that way God
[43:35] doesn't make any mistakes right and
[43:38] there's no mistakes in the Bible and
[43:41] there's no contradictions in the
[43:43] Bible so why would he express it in that
[43:47] way and say Eve was the mother of all
[43:52] living if it wasn't to say Adam was not
[43:56] right
[43:58] right and we know
[44:01] that the serpent had a relationship with
[44:05] Eve and then that morning and later
[44:09] brother R said that evening then Adam
[44:12] was with her and then she had two
[44:17] sons brother mam says all life comes
[44:20] from
[44:21] God the the very Miracle of
[44:25] Life comes from God
[44:28] but Eve broke the word that wasn't the
[44:30] way that God meant for it to come he
[44:32] meant for it to come by Spoken Word but
[44:35] he put man on free moral agency to make
[44:38] a choice God couldn't make man and cause
[44:41] man to fall but we know he had
[44:44] attributes in him to be a savior and in
[44:47] order to be a savior there had there was
[44:49] a need something had to need to be
[44:53] saved and so God put man on free moral
[44:56] agent agency and it was man that made
[44:59] the choice that he
[45:01] made Adam
[45:04] actually was a typ in Christ in that he
[45:08] went to save his bride had not Adam done
[45:11] what he did then Eve would have lost her
[45:15] life but Adam went to save his
[45:19] bride and so
[45:24] then Adam was not cursed Eve was not
[45:27] curse but God cursed The
[45:29] Serpent and said upon thy belly shalt
[45:32] thou go the scripture itself testifies
[45:36] that prior to this he didn't go about on
[45:39] his belly because if he had have then
[45:41] why would God have said I'm going to
[45:44] curse you and make you go on your belly
[45:46] if he was already that way he wasn't
[45:49] walked upright like a man he was a beast
[45:52] not a not a
[45:55] reptile and and
[46:00] so
[46:02] Satan Satan could not
[46:05] come and have a child by
[46:09] Eve but Satan could come and enter
[46:12] animal life which was the
[46:15] Beast The Serpent and then by
[46:19] that the serpent then would have a son
[46:24] and that son was influenc Ed of the
[46:30] devil the serpent didn't have a
[46:33] soul but when Cain was born because it
[46:38] mixed the Serpent's Seed with the blood
[46:42] of the woman then Cain came forth having
[46:45] a
[46:46] soul if Cain didn't have a soul then God
[46:49] wouldn't have said to him if thou doest
[46:51] well wilt thou not also be accepted
[46:54] brother Ram said in other words he said
[46:56] if you worship like your brother I'll
[46:58] accept
[47:01] you God didn't just put that out there
[47:04] and not really mean
[47:05] it God meant
[47:07] it now by for knowledge he knew what
[47:11] Cain would
[47:16] choose but he gave Cain
[47:21] opportunity Cain had just as much
[47:24] opportunity as Abel had
[47:27] right but see the Bible says by faith
[47:32] Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[47:34] than that of Cain what was missing with
[47:39] Cain brother brandom said that God slew
[47:45] a lamb he took animal life because it
[47:48] was animal life that brought about the
[47:53] fault and so God slew animal life to
[47:57] cover up his
[47:59] children but Cain brought
[48:03] fruit the original belief that it was an
[48:07] apple or some type of
[48:12] fruit brother Bram says in one place it
[48:14] was because Adam and Eve told the boys
[48:18] that but by Revelation Abel it was
[48:22] revealed to Abel what it
[48:25] was Hallelujah and you say but it
[48:27] doesn't seem like it's fair if it wasn't
[48:29] revealed to Cain it was revealed to Cain
[48:33] after Abel did what he did and God said
[48:35] if you do it that way I'll accept
[48:39] [Applause]
[48:41] you but Cain being beast
[48:47] like he reviled against
[48:51] God in such a way even more than Satan
[48:55] had yeah
[48:59] and turned around and slew his
[49:02] brother thinking well I'll tell you what
[49:05] you're going to accept it my way because
[49:07] I'm going to do away with Abel the only
[49:10] one you'll have left is me in my
[49:15] way and then when God came and you know
[49:19] told him your brother's blood crith from
[49:22] the
[49:22] ground and he questioned Cain about what
[49:27] he had done right and then when God put
[49:31] forth a sentence on him remember Cain
[49:33] said this punishment is too
[49:37] hard I find that quite outstanding to
[49:40] think on that that after he killed his
[49:44] brother and now he's to become an
[49:49] outcast and be
[49:52] marked then him to say oh that's just
[49:55] too much punishment I mean after all all
[49:57] I did was kill my
[50:04] brother that spirit's still alive
[50:16] today future home brother Venom said see
[50:19] they can't find the species between
[50:21] chimpanzee and man each one of them is
[50:24] evolved up from the birth and up to the
[50:28] monkeys and so forth up to the
[50:30] chimpanzee then there's a
[50:32] loss it was the serpent not a snake
[50:36] every form is lost from him because he
[50:39] was
[50:40] cursed God didn't curse Adam he might
[50:43] have done the same thing but he cursed
[50:45] the Earth the thorns and the thistles he
[50:48] didn't curse Eve but said to Adam would
[50:51] be her ruler and from now on she ain't
[50:53] to try any preaching or anything Adam is
[50:56] a ruler all the days of your life and
[50:59] sorrow you'll bring forth life into the
[51:01] Earth but he said I'll put enmity
[51:03] between your seed now she didn't have a
[51:06] seed she never did have so she had to
[51:09] receive a seed from some way God gave
[51:13] her a seed but not by sexual intercourse
[51:16] but by creation Now what what is he
[51:18] speaking of here when God gave the woman
[51:21] seed was when he came to Mary and said
[51:25] you'll be overshadowed of the Holy Ghost
[51:27] and you'll conceive and bring forth a
[51:29] son and you'll call his name
[51:33] Jesus that's when she received the seed
[51:37] he said can't you blind people
[51:39] see that the serpent seed Satan got
[51:43] there before Adam that was the seed but
[51:46] she received the seed what was it God
[51:49] himself he was the beginning of the
[51:53] creation
[51:55] now remember when
[51:58] Moses when God was giving him a sign
[52:00] when he was at the burning bush and he's
[52:03] getting ready to go back God sending him
[52:05] back to Egypt and he has a a Shepherd
[52:08] staff in his
[52:10] hand and God gives him a sign tells him
[52:13] to throw the staff down when he does it
[52:16] becomes a serpent and then when he told
[52:18] him reach down and pick it up again when
[52:20] he picked it up again it became a staff
[52:22] again right
[52:32] Moses I guess would have said I've seen
[52:35] strange sights today so when he seen the
[52:37] stick turn to a snake now what was the
[52:43] stick it wasn't an ordinary stick
[52:46] anymore it was the Judgment Rod of
[52:49] almighty
[52:50] God what did it symbolize the
[52:54] cross how would it symbolize the cross
[52:57] because it was on the natural it was
[53:01] wood on the spiritual it was a serpent
[53:05] and how could the serpent represent
[53:07] Jesus the serpent as it was a rep was
[53:11] not a reptile it represented sin already
[53:15] judged as as it was a snake for Satan
[53:19] had sin in the serpent in the Garden of
[53:22] even which was not a reptile he was a
[53:25] missing link but between men and animal
[53:28] he stood there as walked upright was the
[53:32] most subtle of all the beasts not
[53:34] reptiles of the beast of the field and
[53:37] when he had was cursed his legs went off
[53:40] him and on his belly he went and that
[53:42] showed he was already judged when he
[53:44] became a
[53:46] reptile and then Christ
[53:49] was the their sin and the serpent
[53:52] already
[53:54] judged the lamb slain from the
[53:56] foundation of the world you see it now
[53:59] he picks up the stick and the
[54:01] Supernatural on the stick was a serpent
[54:04] Supernatural it was a serpent in his
[54:06] hand natural it was a stick in his hand
[54:10] the cross plus Christ the Judgment here
[54:14] he goes down to Egypt as I've said many
[54:16] times a Onan
[54:19] Invasion so here the staff represented
[54:23] the cross and when it turned into to a
[54:27] snake it represented
[54:29] judgment that sin had already been
[54:33] judged and
[54:35] so
[54:38] when they got down to Egypt and Moses
[54:41] put had Aon put the stick down and he
[54:44] did and became a serpent then Janes and
[54:46] jambre came out they said well uh
[54:49] Pharaoh cist just no more than a parlor
[54:52] chck and so janny's and jam came out and
[54:54] they throw down their staffs and it they
[54:57] became serpents but notice the serpent
[55:01] from Moses staff swallowed the other two
[55:05] serpents and when he picked it up again
[55:07] it become a staff and it wasn't any
[55:09] bigger than it was when it started
[55:16] out it was
[55:19] judgment the staff represented judgment
[55:23] to pharaoh
[55:30] now we know the Bible
[55:32] says that Jes that God said let the
[55:35] Earth bring forth grass and let every
[55:38] seed bring forth of its kind and said
[55:41] the cattle let it bring forth of its
[55:43] kind let the foul the air bring forth of
[55:46] its kind let the Beast of the field
[55:49] bring forth of their kind so every seed
[55:52] was to bring forth of its kind and then
[55:56] once that God spoke that then he said
[55:59] let us create man and he created and
[56:02] said let us create man in our image and
[56:06] he created man in the image of God and
[56:09] the Bible says male and female created
[56:11] he
[56:15] them
[56:18] now the
[56:21] seed that was swn in the
[56:24] garden by the serpent
[56:28] fathered
[56:30] children and from there came a line or a
[56:35] lineage from The
[56:37] Serpent and notice in the lineage of
[56:41] Adam Cain's never
[56:43] mentioned he's not mentioned in the Old
[56:45] Testament he's not mentioned in the New
[56:47] Testament in the lineage it says that
[56:50] Seth was the son of Adam who was the son
[56:54] of God and and it it shows that Enoch
[56:58] was the seventh from Adam and when you
[57:01] count that up it doesn't leave any room
[57:04] for
[57:05] Cain so Cain was never counted in the
[57:08] lineage of Adam or in the lineage of God
[57:11] so it mean that he was in the lineage of
[57:13] The
[57:16] Serpent and so then he could father more
[57:22] children that would be Children of the
[57:25] serpent
[57:28] and these children of the
[57:30] serpent never
[57:33] had in them the love of God that's right
[57:39] religious yes amen build religions make
[57:43] religions build churches do all these
[57:46] things but to actually have the true
[57:48] love of God the Bible says how can you
[57:51] say you love me and keep not my
[57:53] Commandments
[57:55] [Applause]
[57:57] if you love me keep my
[58:03] Commandments Now read with me if you
[58:05] would in Matthew chap 23 verse
[58:12] 27-35 Jesus speaking here
[58:26] says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees
[58:30] Hypocrites for ye are like unto Whited
[58:34] sers which indeed appear beautiful
[58:36] outward but are within full of dead
[58:38] men's bones and all
[58:41] uncleanliness even so ye also outwardly
[58:44] appear righteous unto men but within you
[58:46] are full of hypocrisy and
[58:49] iniquity wo unto you scribes and
[58:51] Pharisees
[58:53] Hypocrites because you build the tombs
[58:55] of the prophets and garnish the
[58:56] suppliers of the righteous and say if we
[58:59] had been in the days of our fathers we
[59:01] would not have been partakers with them
[59:04] in the blood of the prophets wherefore
[59:06] ye be Witnesses unto yourself that ye
[59:08] are the children of them which killed
[59:11] the
[59:12] prophets fill ye up then the measure of
[59:15] your fathers ye serpents ye Generation
[59:19] of Vipers how can you escape the
[59:21] damnation of Hell Jesus didn't pull any
[59:24] punches
[59:28] this is many times I say this and I
[59:31] don't really mean to make light but this
[59:33] is sweet
[59:37] Jesus you would say I just want to hear
[59:40] about sweet Jesus this is sweet
[59:47] Jesus wherefore behold I send unto you
[59:50] prophets and wise men and scribes and
[59:52] some of them ye shall kill and crucify
[59:56] and some of them shall you scorge in
[59:57] your synagogues and persecute them from
[1:00:00] City to city that upon you may come all
[1:00:04] the righteous blood shed upon the Earth
[1:00:07] from the blood of the righteous Abel
[1:00:09] unto the blood of Zacharias son of bakus
[1:00:13] whom you slew between the temple and the
[1:00:15] altar now he's speaking of something
[1:00:17] that happened in 2 Chronicles if you if
[1:00:20] you want to write it down if you want to
[1:00:22] see it later 2 chonicles 24: 20 through
[1:00:27] 22 here was a man of God and he was
[1:00:31] speaking to the people and the King
[1:00:35] commanded them to kill him and they
[1:00:38] stoned him right there by the temple and
[1:00:42] that's what Jesus is speaking of that
[1:00:45] very act and he's saying you are the
[1:00:48] children of them that did
[1:00:53] that now
[1:00:56] Cain was the first
[1:00:59] murderer why because his father was
[1:01:04] Satan through the
[1:01:08] serpent and so he fulfilled up the
[1:01:10] measure of his father who was a liar the
[1:01:14] Bible says from the
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:19] beginning and these that Jesus was
[1:01:22] talking to here he's saying you're of
[1:01:25] your father
[1:01:27] fathers and he even right out called him
[1:01:33] serpents and to show they already judged
[1:01:36] then he called them
[1:01:40] viers and he told them there's nothing
[1:01:42] going to save you from hell that's right
[1:01:46] why because of their own
[1:01:51] works and they were the children of
[1:01:54] their fathers who were not the children
[1:01:57] of Adam but were the children of the
[1:02:00] serpent the children of
[1:02:05] Kain
[1:02:07] now the seeds got inter
[1:02:10] mixed the seed of God and the seed of
[1:02:13] the serpent got intermixed in
[1:02:18] Men in
[1:02:20] mankind and he asked how did the serpent
[1:02:23] seed get across the flood
[1:02:28] came across in the wife of one of the bo
[1:02:31] the
[1:02:37] boys there is a name in can's lineage I
[1:02:41] looked up the
[1:02:42] meanings uh there's about seven names I
[1:02:45] read down through the meanings of the
[1:02:47] descendants of Cain and it finally comes
[1:02:49] down to one that says and his name means
[1:02:52] who is of God who is of God
[1:02:56] by then it have become to a place
[1:02:58] because people asked brother Ram said
[1:03:00] who did Cain marry he said he married
[1:03:03] one of his
[1:03:06] sisters now to marry one of his sisters
[1:03:09] it would actually been his half sister
[1:03:10] who would have been the daughter of
[1:03:13] Adam who was a Son of
[1:03:16] God so she would have been a daughter of
[1:03:22] God
[1:03:23] see and it became to were then that
[1:03:28] didn't know who was
[1:03:30] who and Satan not being like God Satan
[1:03:35] doesn't know who belongs to
[1:03:43] him but as he sees you accepting the
[1:03:47] word hallelujah and he begin to take
[1:03:49] affecting you he begins to recognize
[1:03:52] that you are of God
[1:03:55] but that doesn't stop him that makes him
[1:03:57] want to pour it on all the
[1:04:01] more he hates
[1:04:07] you I'll show you this
[1:04:11] further Stephen when he was being stoned
[1:04:14] remember Stephen he he called him stiff
[1:04:17] necked and uncircumcised of heart you
[1:04:20] you always resist the Holy
[1:04:22] Ghost and then he said which of the F of
[1:04:26] the prophets did not your fathers
[1:04:30] persecute Jesus says then in Luke I love
[1:04:34] this
[1:04:35] scripture blessed are ye when men shall
[1:04:38] hate
[1:04:40] you I love this
[1:04:43] scripture blessed are ye when men shall
[1:04:46] hate you when ye shall when they shall
[1:04:50] separate you from their company and
[1:04:52] shall reproach you and cast your name
[1:04:54] out as evil for the son of man's sake
[1:04:58] Rejoice ye in that day leap for Joy for
[1:05:03] behold your word is reward is great in
[1:05:06] heaven for in like manner did their
[1:05:09] fathers unto the
[1:05:11] prophets what is this showing you your
[1:05:17] identification when men Hate You cast
[1:05:20] your name out as evil when they
[1:05:23] persecute you when they set you from
[1:05:26] their company when they reproach you
[1:05:28] what is it it's showing you are of the
[1:05:34] prophets it's showing your
[1:05:37] lineage he said you should Rejoice jump
[1:05:41] with joy hallah why because it shows who
[1:05:44] you are look every scripture must be
[1:05:50] fulfilled and if he said there was going
[1:05:52] to be some that would hate the Believers
[1:05:56] would hate his children and would bring
[1:05:59] reproach to him then somebody's got to
[1:06:01] fulfill
[1:06:02] that somebody's got to be the one that's
[1:06:06] hating you some somebody's got to
[1:06:08] fulfill that part I don't want to
[1:06:10] fulfill that part that's why I jump for
[1:06:13] joy when I see the part that I am
[1:06:16] fulfilling I'm the one that's being
[1:06:18] hated I'm the one that's being
[1:06:19] reproached I'm the one they're
[1:06:21] separating Company from
[1:06:27] there's some folks in Dixon it wouldn't
[1:06:29] darken the doors of the church where I'm
[1:06:33] at I would never s under that
[1:06:36] man praise God
[1:06:56] now I want to touch a little bit
[1:07:01] into
[1:07:02] predestination
[1:07:04] but uh like I
[1:07:08] said we'll prob to finish this up on
[1:07:13] Sunday and believest thou this brother
[1:07:16] bam said now Jesus when he was born I
[1:07:18] believe all gifts are for ordained the
[1:07:21] forn knowledge of God I believe there's
[1:07:23] nothing that you work yourself up to or
[1:07:26] anything that one person can give to
[1:07:28] another and therefore I believe that all
[1:07:31] gifts were for ordained of God to come
[1:07:33] into the world for instance Jesus
[1:07:36] himself he was for ordained of God to
[1:07:39] come into the world do you believe that
[1:07:41] he was the woman's seed that was to
[1:07:44] bruise the Serpent's
[1:07:46] head his head was
[1:07:48] Bru his head was to bruise the
[1:07:52] heel I believe that Moses was for
[1:07:55] ordained of God do you believe that when
[1:07:58] he was born he was a proper child he was
[1:08:01] raised up in Pharaoh's palace with his
[1:08:03] foot on the throne to become heir of
[1:08:06] even Pharaoh's son to fall heir to the
[1:08:08] throne but he was ordained of God if
[1:08:12] he'd have been an ordinary man he'd have
[1:08:16] went ahead and took those great
[1:08:18] honors but he was ordained of God for
[1:08:22] another
[1:08:24] purpose the Bible says by
[1:08:27] faith that
[1:08:29] Moses refused to be called the son of
[1:08:33] pharaoh Hallelujah why there was
[1:08:36] something in
[1:08:38] Moses it was right there available and
[1:08:40] if he have been an ordinary man brother
[1:08:42] random said he would have took it but he
[1:08:45] wasn't an ordinary man he was a man
[1:08:48] called of
[1:08:51] God when you're called of God and I'm
[1:08:54] not in this I'm not talking about a
[1:08:56] calling for a gift every one of you God
[1:08:59] called
[1:08:59] [Music]
[1:09:02] you when you're called of God you can't
[1:09:05] escape that
[1:09:07] call you can't do nothing but there's
[1:09:10] something in you that just brings you to
[1:09:15] it now Satan will come along and he'll
[1:09:18] try to confuse your mind to make you
[1:09:20] think that's right that you're not one
[1:09:22] of them
[1:09:24] yeah so folks I've talked to who left
[1:09:26] the message then came back they never
[1:09:29] they felt like they never really left
[1:09:30] the message they just went they came
[1:09:33] back
[1:09:34] slid but they never questioned whether
[1:09:36] the message was right or
[1:09:38] not but Satan got him to question
[1:09:40] whether they were right or not whether
[1:09:44] they was one of them or not what seed
[1:09:47] were they of but to show you were not of
[1:09:51] the seed of the serpent watch what
[1:09:53] brought you back
[1:09:56] what brought you back was that seat of
[1:09:58] God that was inside that
[1:10:01] Soul Satan thought he had you but he
[1:10:05] couldn't hold you why there was
[1:10:07] something within you that was screaming
[1:10:09] out it wouldn't let you
[1:10:13] rest why you were a child of God not a
[1:10:17] child of the
[1:10:24] serpent praise the Lord authority of the
[1:10:27] word he says how many beliefs gifts and
[1:10:29] callings are without
[1:10:30] repentance the Bible said so Jesus
[1:10:33] Christ was a Son of God from the very
[1:10:35] beginning from the Garden of Eden he was
[1:10:38] the woman's seed is that right that was
[1:10:40] to bruise the Serpent's head Moses when
[1:10:43] he was born he was a proper child God
[1:10:45] had him brought there Moses had nothing
[1:10:48] to do with it is that right God told
[1:10:51] Jeremiah said before you ever formed in
[1:10:53] your mother's womb I knew you and
[1:10:55] Sanctified you and ordained you a
[1:10:57] prophet over the Nations how could he
[1:11:01] help
[1:11:03] it what are he saying here Jeremiah
[1:11:06] couldn't help but fulfill up what God
[1:11:08] had called him to why because God
[1:11:11] ordained for him to be
[1:11:13] that and he goes on to say gifts and
[1:11:16] callings are repentance you're the way
[1:11:20] that you are because God made you that
[1:11:23] way Hallelujah
[1:11:26] you're the way you are because God made
[1:11:29] you that way what makes you hunger and
[1:11:32] thirst after the
[1:11:34] truth why are you not satisfied with
[1:11:36] joining the church putting your name on
[1:11:39] a book and saying well I'm a church
[1:11:41] member why doesn't it satisfy you why
[1:11:45] are you not satisfied with just having
[1:11:48] uh a a form of
[1:11:52] godliness why because God didn't make
[1:11:56] you for that you were made to serve him
[1:12:00] in the truth of the
[1:12:05] hour what caused you to believe cuz God
[1:12:08] made you that
[1:12:11] way you're his children that's why
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:20] [Music]
[1:12:29] in the
[1:12:30] natural that's the way all of us are in
[1:12:32] the
[1:12:33] spiritual we do what we do because of
[1:12:36] who our father is
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:55] before Jeremiah come to Earth the great
[1:12:57] Prophet Jeremiah God said before you
[1:12:59] were even formed your mother's womb I
[1:13:01] knew you and called you and Sanctified
[1:13:03] you and ordained you a prophet over the
[1:13:05] Nations it ain't just what somebody does
[1:13:09] it's what God
[1:13:11] does hallelujah it's not what we do or
[1:13:16] what we can do it's what he's already
[1:13:20] done he overcame for his children
[1:13:31] it's all together by Grace it's not by
[1:13:33] desire it's by
[1:13:35] Grace God called Abraham out of the
[1:13:38] whole world of people why because
[1:13:41] Abraham was better no sir it's Grace
[1:13:45] God's chosen election and call you are
[1:13:48] what you are because the grace of God
[1:13:51] has made you what you
[1:13:53] are Hallelujah
[1:13:57] who taking thought can add one cubit to
[1:14:01] his stature is that right it's by
[1:14:05] Grace here he says in my angel I go
[1:14:08] before thee he says you can't help
[1:14:09] because you have blue
[1:14:12] eyes who taking the thought could add
[1:14:15] one cubit to his stature if God wants
[1:14:18] you to be a certain thing he brings you
[1:14:20] to this earth to be that and you will be
[1:14:23] that
[1:14:26] hallelujah hallelujah take that
[1:14:29] devil
[1:14:31] Hallelujah God wants you to be a certain
[1:14:34] way he brings you on this Earth and
[1:14:36] you're going to be what he made you to
[1:14:39] be he made me to worship Him He made me
[1:14:43] to serve him he made me to believe the
[1:14:46] truth he made me to become one with
[1:14:50] him Hallelujah
[1:15:11] Israel and the church he said I'll put
[1:15:13] enmity between thy seed and the serpent
[1:15:16] seed he'll bruise the head and his head
[1:15:19] will bruise your
[1:15:20] heel now I will when God says he'll do
[1:15:24] anything you can look for it to be
[1:15:26] done when man says he'll do anything I
[1:15:29] don't know about that but God told
[1:15:32] Abraham I will save you and your seed
[1:15:35] after you not only Abraham but all of
[1:15:38] Abraham's seed
[1:15:43] unconditional I'll save you
[1:15:46] unconditional oh I'm so
[1:15:49] glad I'm so glad that it doesn't it
[1:15:53] doesn't depend on your natural heritage
[1:15:57] that has nothing to do with
[1:16:00] it the Bible tells us that I believe in
[1:16:03] the Book of Romans where it speaks about
[1:16:05] Esau and Jacob it didn't matter what
[1:16:07] your natural heritage is what matters is
[1:16:10] what your spiritual Heritage
[1:16:12] is that's what causes you to serve
[1:16:18] God says if you excuse me I believe I'll
[1:16:21] shout a
[1:16:23] little oh look you just don't know
[1:16:26] realize people what it means maybe some
[1:16:28] of you has never thought deep enough to
[1:16:31] get into it God has already glorified
[1:16:35] his
[1:16:36] church those who he justified he also
[1:16:41] glorified in the church in Christ if
[1:16:43] you're justified in Christ you're
[1:16:45] glorified in Christ already as far as
[1:16:48] God's
[1:16:50] concern Glory Hallelujah listen to this
[1:16:53] Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even
[1:16:56] as your father in Heaven is perfect how
[1:16:59] could you ever be
[1:17:01] perfect but in the sight of Christ
[1:17:03] tonight every born again Christian is
[1:17:07] perfect I'm just as perfect in God as
[1:17:10] Christ
[1:17:12] was
[1:17:13] [Music]
[1:17:15] Hallelujah you are
[1:17:17] to
[1:17:19] every other believer for it's not my
[1:17:22] Holiness it's his holiness
[1:17:26] God can't accept mine I have none but I
[1:17:29] come in Christ by faith and by Christ
[1:17:33] I'm in him and perfect in the sight of
[1:17:37] God by one Spirit we're all baptized
[1:17:40] into one body and become members of this
[1:17:42] body Romans
[1:17:44] 81 there is therefore now no
[1:17:47] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[1:17:49] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:17:51] the
[1:17:52] spirit and a man that's in Christ Christ
[1:17:55] Jesus walks after spiritual things to
[1:17:58] the world its carnal mind its
[1:18:01] foolishness but to them that believe
[1:18:04] it's everlasting
[1:18:06] life there you are how marvelous then
[1:18:10] what can harm you you're in Christ and
[1:18:14] just as sure as God raised Jesus from
[1:18:16] the dead will come in Christ amen yes
[1:18:19] we've got to God's done promised it for
[1:18:23] just as sure as the body goes up I'm in
[1:18:27] that body I have to go up with
[1:18:32] it
[1:18:37] Hallelujah you
[1:18:39] say you believe in eternal security then
[1:18:42] brother randam in one way I
[1:18:45] do I believe the church is eternally
[1:18:47] secure the church is cuz God already
[1:18:51] said it would appear before him without
[1:18:53] spot or wrinkle
[1:18:57] now the next thing if you're in the
[1:18:59] church then you're secure if you're in
[1:19:02] the
[1:19:03] church now he's not talking about an
[1:19:06] organization he's not talking about some
[1:19:10] building he's not talking about if you
[1:19:13] go to brother Donnie's or if you go to
[1:19:15] brother Samuel's or if you go to brother
[1:19:18] bisc because there's three kinds of
[1:19:21] Believers everywhere you go he's not
[1:19:23] talking about if you go go there but
[1:19:25] he's talking if you're in the
[1:19:28] church the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:32] Christ in the body that spiritual
[1:19:37] body he that comes to me I will in know
[1:19:40] Wise cast out and listen here's the
[1:19:44] man's word about it Jesus Christ St John
[1:19:47] chapter 5 verse
[1:19:50] 24 whosoever he that heareth my words
[1:19:53] and believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:19:56] pre present tense everlasting life
[1:20:01] that's not just from one meeting to
[1:20:03] another everlasting life and shall not
[1:20:07] come into the Judgment or the
[1:20:08] condemnation never be cast away but hath
[1:20:13] passed tense passed from Death unto life
[1:20:18] St John 5:24 Jesus said so I am the
[1:20:21] bread of life that come from God out of
[1:20:23] Heaven your father man in the wilderness
[1:20:26] and are dead but he that eats my flesh
[1:20:28] and drinks my blood hath everlasting
[1:20:30] life and I'll raise him up at the last
[1:20:33] days that's what he
[1:20:38] said
[1:20:50] Hallelujah Bible
[1:20:52] says Moses was a proper child
[1:20:56] brother Braham said it wasn't because he
[1:20:57] was
[1:20:59] Moses but it was not because of
[1:21:02] something he had
[1:21:04] done but it was because God chose him
[1:21:07] before he was ever even
[1:21:16] born I like how brother brandom
[1:21:19] says he says talking about the bells and
[1:21:23] how they will bring him to make him to
[1:21:26] have a certain ring to
[1:21:28] them and then brother Brandon begins to
[1:21:31] speak about you and he
[1:21:32] says God put this man with this
[1:21:37] woman and then this man with this woman
[1:21:40] this man with this woman this man with
[1:21:41] this woman he said to get all the way
[1:21:43] down to
[1:21:45] you so that you would be a certain way
[1:21:48] here on
[1:21:51] Earth so what you are here on Earth you
[1:21:53] are that because because that's what God
[1:21:55] meant for you to
[1:22:00] be not this Fallen State condition where
[1:22:03] we grow
[1:22:05] older but God meant even for the
[1:22:08] personality that you have he wanted it
[1:22:11] to be that
[1:22:16] way brother brandham when he went
[1:22:19] squirrel hunting he didn't just shoot
[1:22:22] the squirrel he had to hit it in the eye
[1:22:23] every time
[1:22:25] why he had to be exact every
[1:22:29] time he was that way in the
[1:22:35] spiritual sometimes you come across
[1:22:38] people you say Well they're stubborn let
[1:22:41] God get a hold of
[1:22:43] that when God gets a hold of that you'll
[1:22:45] see they won't move off of God's word
[1:22:48] for no
[1:22:49] man or not no one
[1:22:55] God wanted you to be a certain way
[1:23:00] spiritually and he had you as brother
[1:23:02] Bram said in the back part of his
[1:23:05] mind an attribute that was going to come
[1:23:08] forth but he also had that he wanted you
[1:23:12] to have blue eyes or brown eyes or green
[1:23:14] eyes or hazel eyes
[1:23:17] or he wanted you to have a certain color
[1:23:20] hair he wanted you to be a certain way
[1:23:22] why because these were all
[1:23:25] representations of his
[1:23:28] thoughts you were in the mind of
[1:23:31] God and God chose you before your great
[1:23:36] great grandfather and great great
[1:23:38] grandmother ever came together God chose
[1:23:44] you just like he chose Jeremiah before
[1:23:47] he was ever formed in his mother's belly
[1:23:50] he I love how he says that he didn't say
[1:23:52] once you were conceived and formed in
[1:23:54] the belly then I chose you he said
[1:23:56] before
[1:23:59] that before even that I chose you and I
[1:24:03] called you and I Sanctified you and I
[1:24:06] ordained you to be a
[1:24:09] prophet before that God called
[1:24:13] you before that he ordained
[1:24:19] you I hope I hope I'm getting my point
[1:24:22] across to why it's so important to have
[1:24:25] a revelation of serpent
[1:24:29] seed because it's important for you to
[1:24:32] know who you
[1:24:45] are now there's many that pretend to be
[1:24:49] in there there's many that's Waring
[1:24:52] themselves and trying to live right and
[1:24:54] trying to press in I don't know about
[1:24:57] that but if they are in there it's just
[1:25:00] as easy to live a Christian Life as it
[1:25:01] is to live any life because you're in
[1:25:04] Christ nothing else but just so full of
[1:25:08] the Holy Spirit lead you and guide you
[1:25:10] and direct you and why sure you'll make
[1:25:14] mistakes and fall but you can't stay
[1:25:17] down because no more than you could make
[1:25:20] a stock of corn a sycamore tree
[1:25:25] what's he
[1:25:28] saying you might fall he says make
[1:25:32] mistakes but you won't that you won't

[1:27:22] word we are we part of that word a part
[1:27:25] of that life a lot of obstacles a lot of
[1:27:27] things but that's where that prevailing
[1:27:31] power of his life that's raising that
[1:27:34] seed and even when he's drawing that
[1:27:36] seed there's a lot of things that can be
[1:27:38] over that seed you think of how the
[1:27:40] prophet said with he said you take the

[1:27:51] light you can't do away with it
[1:27:54] it doesn't matter how dark everything is
[1:27:59] yet when God has spoken his word is
[1:28:01] light and that light when it goes forth
[1:28:04] it raises and calls every one of his
[1:28:06] children that's our identity that's what
[1:28:09] gives meaning and purpose to our lives
[1:28:13] we're just here we we work we do all
[1:28:15] those other things everything that we do
[1:28:17] is temporary but our purpose here is to
[1:28:20] serve him that's our purpose God has
[1:28:24] ordained we are co-workers within this
[1:28:27] message that God has called you believe
[1:28:30] that brother Bram took a group of
[1:28:32] ministers and he sets them around in
[1:28:34] 1962 and and Brethren he said and he

[1:28:45] that's for every one of us it wasn't
[1:28:47] just Noah building the ark ham Shem and
[1:28:50] japheth were there as well it was a
[1:28:53] household and God has commissioned us we
[1:28:56] are
[1:28:57] born by the grace of God ordained in
[1:29:00] this house to
[1:29:02] labor to reflect Jesus Christ moving to
[1:29:06] the coming of the Lord greater is he
