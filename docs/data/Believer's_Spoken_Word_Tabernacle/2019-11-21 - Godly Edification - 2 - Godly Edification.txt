we pray now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen if you want to turn in your Bibles to first Corinthians chapter 14 and as you're as you're turning there I want to just to make also an announcement I'd like right after service to meet on Sunday on Sunday after service all who are currently or who have run the slides that's these overheads the audio or the video in the booth I'd like to meet with all those that has done that right after service on Sunday morning I just want to have a quick meeting and go over some things that that I have to talk about concerning that and things we've put in place so those and our Lord willing should have an email sister Rosa and to send out tomorrow morning as well also with brother edy Cardona that may be also another email I need to get out in the morning I've got a touch base with his son Richard's already been doing some of the legwork force here and I'm going to appreciate that we we don't know exactly we want to be able to have something for brother edge so some sort of a service so I'm just trying to work on that and then we'll let you know all the details more willing tomorrow morning so everybody okay amen well let's we'll read one verse of scripture then we'll let you have your seats in 1st Corinthians 14 and 26 how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you half an assault half a doctrine half a tone half a revelation half an interpretation let all things be done unto edifying and may God bless you as you're being seated bless His Word I want to look back on to this thought here just a little bit I actually thought they were just gonna go on but the Lord just seemed like it just wouldn't let me go on and earlier the other morning I just just was pressed in this direction and knowing there was still something here that we're looking at Paul he's taken this time in first Corinthians 14:2 to express to the church because they had the gifts operating there within the the Church of Corinth and and I think that that's something that as brother Branham would bring us in the scriptures and show us that every local body there the nine spiritual gifts are to be a part of that local body and to recognize that with within it when we when we see it it's things that God has said in the church and it's all for the edifying of the body and I don't want to get ahead of myself here but when you look at how that that that Paul would would write in place this here you'll see in different times in the scriptures and for that first Corinthians 14 where Paul is telling them when you come together and you'll say it a couple different times and when you recognize that when we we see it it's just like this there we know that the Bible tells us to forsake not to assemble ourselves together and to recognize that when we when we come together that we are expecting that God will make himself known in our midst we we don't know what he's going to do but we always know he'll always come according to his word and when we come here and we gather we're not here just to see well let's see what's going to happen as believers we recognize that when we're coming here we're coming to hear from God we've got needs in our life there are there are our we need to be spoken we need we need God to speak to us we need we need God to move on the scene not just for us but there's such a variety of needs that could be among us for healing deliverance for the baptism of the Holy Ghost there's so many different diversity of needs when we come together and I'm glad that it's not in our hands too as to that we would be the ones meeting those needs but God is the one who is who is the one to meet those needs but Paul is is just he's making known to them to the congregation to the people here that let all things be done unto edifying on a set like this there's really there's really nothing wrong with somebody coming and they have a soul there's nothing wrong with somebody that they have something upon their heart but yet Paul is letting it be known that when he's dealing with this Paul he is telling them because Paul seems something spiritually here that this is what the people are resting upon they're actually resting their faith and their walk with God that they've got a song or they've got a doctrine instead of letting it be resting in Jesus Christ now let me just say it to you like this if a person is resting within that and then they don't have that within a service and that's where their rest is that they feel as though they ain't even been to church and you know how it is sometimes if a person you know they're you know a person may feel like that they got to be the one that's doing the preaching or they got to be the one doing the singing and if they didn't do it and there's little things in the service if it's not done well then I didn't come to church but the reality is is that God in every service there's no service that we ever want to get in a pre-programmed format as to how God is going to work because the reality is you can never put God in a box if you ever go to try to put in lines and putting God in a box God you will just move right on out but God will always show up and to remember everything that is done is for the edification of the body of Jesus Christ and so every gift does say it like this every gift that God has is for the body it isn't for the person who has it it's for the body even a person a person who has a gift to sing it isn't for them it's for the body a person who has a gift to preach it isn't for them it's for the body and to recognize that this was in it there's a lot to be said here but there is in everything and don't just don't misunderstand me and don't take this lightly every one brother man would say it over and over as a matter of fact he you say like this he says that every person in the local church has an individual ministry so a person you might look and say well I don't think that I cover in one of the nine spiritual gifts but remember if you are born of the Spirit of God baptized into the body of Jesus Christ every member is subject to one of the nine spiritual gifts and in God as brother Ram will tell us he said God can use this person tonight and he says mummy says the Spirit of God will move he said and never used that person again however we do see where you know brother Branham will teach us that and show us that but then there teams tend tends to be tendencies where you can see different ones who will speak in tongues like brother man will call out junior Jackson he'll call out brother Neville in different ones and I believe with all my heart that with all of us we want to be in such a place to be available when God wants to use us you want to be in a place to where you don't have to say Lord I would but we we want to be in a place to where that God can use us because when we're in a place in fellowship with God we are sensitive to his leading we're sensitive to his voice in a matter of fact we lose sight of self and we're very keen upon what God's desire is and so when I look at this brother man with jealousy said every church every person in that church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the body to edify the body of Jesus Christ so no ministry is to be on an island by itself as those that my you know it sticks out no edge to go and blend with the rest of the body and I think of that mother so much we can run with this on an individual ministry but you know many of the times when we look at things and I've looked at this over over the years of how that many times when we we talk about the gifts being among us many times the only gift many times that is actually seen that will can be witness many times in the congregation is that of tongues and that of interpretation but the gift of wisdom listen brother sister the gift of wisdom is not limited to being in the house of God the gift of wisdom can move the Holy Spirit move upon a lie and you might be fellowshipping with a brother sister or you feel burdened upon your heart to get together with this one and say I don't know what it is don't try to figure it out just be sensitive to the Lord pray about it and you watch how God the wisdom of God can come right down into that time and it can be something that happens through a car maybe it's through you sitting down with them and God can minister right to them and give them the encouragement that they need how is that through a gift of wisdom even that the gift of healing remember brother man I'm talking about the woman who walked in and she saw this she was drawn to that little baby and and was just pressed upon her go pray for that go pray for that baby she said no there you know in herself no brother branham will take care of that you know when he prays for she could not get away from that unction and she went and obeyed that and brother Branham tells us he said and when when the baby came up on the platform he tells the person he says your baby was already healed when that sister back there prayed for it God heard her prayer you know to me I believe God let that be for you and I to confirm it to show us that he's God of the whole temp and then that to me is the Ministry of Malachi 4 is to identify the presence of Jesus Christ that is among us that desires to to make himself known and to work among his people there's so much with it but I believe it with all my heart and the see how that you know this where was she prayed and God heard that prayer this was a bird look at this nobody would have known that you and I wouldn't have known that to even know that account if it hadn't been called out and recorded on tape nobody in the congregation would have known about that let me just say it to you like this there's a lot of things that God can use us and God can do with us and there's times that God wants to use us and then sometimes as he uses he'll step back and test us and say what are you gonna say about it why are you gonna guilt and sometimes God wants us to testify on some of those things and then there's other times where there's things that you it's just like you know that are said and God doesn't want it said it all my goodness that requires a lot of wisdom to know what needs to be said and what because we never want to draw attention to ourselves we want all the focus to be upon the Lord Jesus Christ you say what do you mean and what I mean is that I want somebody's face resting in the Lord Jesus Christ not resting in the fact that oh it's brother Sam they're gonna be here this weekend oh if brother Samuel is not gonna be here you know I need to be pray for it is not my prayer it is your faith in the finished work out Calvary Amen I don't want somebody resting in me I want you resting in Jesus Christ amen because to tell you the truth gadi God doesn't have to have just my hands God can use the hands of your wife God can use the hands of your husband are you isn't me my my my now when we when we look at this God Paulus is telling them when you all come together he's dealing with the godly edification that it's about the body the gift is not something for you to profit from but rather used to bless his name to bless his body the gift and I'll say it like this the gift is not it's not something to wear the gift has to used at that time remember this is where Pentacles got it wrong they thought in order to have that they had Church somebody had to speak in tongues and they failed to recognize that it wasn't about that that those gifts are given that for God to speak directly to his church and when that is based on beneath it's like this when you're making your food in your kitchen now talk to the sisters but everybody everybody can relate to it because the brothers appreciate this you know you don't use the spatula for everything you do you use the spatula when you are maybe mixing up you know brownies or the cake batter as husbands we use it to lick it out of the bowl do you know then you have other utensils you have a whisk you'll use sometimes you have made me you know the the fork you're used to beat the eggs up you based on what the need is is what determines what tool that you use so it is God who takes the the Arsenal of his tools and he uses them that it would edify the Church of the Living God if somebody is sick in their body and and maybe he'll God will move down and here comes a gift of healing where to pray the burden like I decided that little woman you know we don't even know her name it's not necessary she was moved by the Holy Ghost to pray for that little baby and God can take that gear and it moves for that situation for that need at that time same way with wisdom same way with tongues same way with interpretation we recognized that it's not something that God would have us to be anxious about it's like when it comes to you know even to to singing it isn't that you know and that that that a person who is gifted with in singing that every service that they have to sing I think it's a blessing when they have yielded to God and God will lay songs on their heart it's very important let me just tell you special singing is very important I think we're in a heart when it says well I've got to sing that's something that's wrong but in a heart and I believe what we have here we have hearts that say you know Lord whenever that you want to use me you know whatever the burden is the need because God has a way through singing that God can communicate even his word through singing we know brother Branham tells us that and shows us that even how God can even communicate his word even through singing so many different examples in the Bible even how brother Branham when he would come into the church and he's sitting back in his office he said I'm all tore up he said I was all tore up he said but I set back there he said and I listened to that song service and it made me ready to be able to come out here that's why I believe it's all my heart it's important to be in the house of God not just to hear the word of God it's important to be here for the song service I know sometimes it runs a little different on Thursday but brother and sister I believe we can buckle down on Sundays and we can really work to make sure that we are here and the church said Amen so we want to be available and stay available you know when we women look at it here you know the word of edify is where it works to promote one another's growth in Christian wisdom and piety and happiness and holiness and affection and now Paul let me go on here in the scripture here because I need to get somewhere in verse 27 If any man speak in an unknown tongue let it be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to God now one thing I want you to notice that you know here the Holy Spirit moves through the Prophet in this hour and he teaches us that when the Holy Ghost is moving that there is also a godly restraint and a stewardship that is placed even in our hands wherein he said that you know brother ben shows us that a person said hold on just couldn't keep it in no dad said oh yes you can see it lets us know see here's what it does you see what the whole thing is it lets us know as sons and daughters who we are in position we are not the Bible listen to me now the Bible says quench not the Spirit despise not prophesying it shows when Paul dealt with that in these'll vessel and Aika that there was obviously some things that could have caused people in the Thessalonica Church to actually want to just camp down and say no sir we're gonna have none of that let me just say this anywhere that the gifts are and they ought to be in the in every local body it cannot be held in the manner I'm gonna hold sub so tight so nothing I know nothing of the wrong nothing will happen at all you say what is that to be trust God who gave the word the same God who gave the word and if somebody gets a little bit out of order hey the Holy Ghost is present to be able to help that person because we want to believe that their desire is really to edify the body maybe they just needed a little help you with me sometimes these are things you know that where it's it's mentioned I think you know I listen to on Sundays message and I I just love brother Alexander you know the way he said I couldn't help but I just started laughing you know I said that's exactly true he says some people are so interested in putting stuff in order they name got when that may be like words that I'm saying there but you understand there's two things you know that I I know I've said it to because I've been through it I've been through it over the years where people are so tight with church order and they're so tight with everything else and you know I've been down that path I'm not running down that path again I've been down there I've been down there where people are so tight on things and you in over 45 minutes and so-and-so prayed and when they prayed they they they when they prayed this long I mean are we watching watches or what when and what are we here for you know I mean it comes down to a place to where then I think that people are basing rapturing faith upon how things seem to be just exactly right that's not rapturing faith how things are orderly it's like the pipes in your house you want the pipes clean so the water can flow that's what order order does not camp down or crack or quench whatsoever they've got to be controlling it all in order let me stay on this and then the reality is we don't need to control it we need to let God control us amen so think of this that by course huh you know yeah Paul blows he says let let him verse 28 sorry if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to God let the prophets speak two or three and let the other judge if anything be revealed to another that sentence by the first hold his peace for ye look at verse 31 for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted I've said this I've said this and mentioned this and many of you know this but I witnessed even as a as a young boy I witnessed even as a young man how God would would move and work right here within the assembly and many of you you you know as as pillars in this assembly of leaving we were getting ready to make them move over here into this building there it was something that as far as if it looked at the natural site and the reasonings of man it seems scary how in the world are we going to do that but you see God it's just the Lord just taking control within it and I never forget you know yeah there was opposition there was people that became fearful of it but I'll never forget the one midweek service where the Spirit of the Lord moved down and brother bill here here the Lord just in the Lord used him to speak to us as a church at that time on a midweek service and it spoke to us at that time and and I believe it said it like this and I recall it that I have ordained my servant James Browning to lead you over there through this transaction to this place I'm telling you right now there was not a question in the building there of what God that that was God that had spoke there that night it was something that resonated in the hearts of people I'm looking at different ones right now that you stood on the banknote I'm looking at different ones of you you and your husband stirring on the baton or you know brother Louie went on home to be with the Lord but brother Louie was one of the first one by the lily Miranda he said we'll be there at the bank different ones right through the assembly said we'll guarantee this note but it was bigger payments than we had ever did before but God by His mercy in seven years everything was paid off for a little group there in no way in the world I reasoning could have wrapped around that but as I'll tell you what it was it was moving in season and intact it moved right into the hearts of you his people and you recognized hey this is our building oh my but what I'm saying is that look within that there was not a place that we could find per se in the scripture that spoke to us regarding that particular thing but seek God it's just like when we're praying for something and somebody might be praying about do I move here or do I move there or maybe not even praying at all but the Spirit of God will move down and say what's tomorrow on your job this and this could be there I believe he's still the same God I believe God cares about everything tail in our life and I still believe that God is glorified in our midst he works the same way do I have let me to say like this do I have to have that every service no but I've gotta have God I've gotta have God every service Jesus Christ must be present but however he wants to work I want him to work hallelujah I never forget you know the times of different ones were going through situations and the Spirit of God moved down and spoke you know even right here within the services now I hope you understand what I'm getting to is that there were needs this was not people just showing up and say well you know God has used me in the past to speak in tongues so we're coming to church tonight and and I believe I'm gonna speak in tongues and I it is not that way at all it is based on what is a need and that's the same way it is listen that's the same way when it comes down from ministry I'm not preaching what I want to preach I'm preaching what God has laid upon my heart even this subject right here and God has really opened it and expanded it out but way back I think it was even in September when a lot of these things we were looking at it but when I come back even from the Philippines I said God does this what you want for right now because I realized that God is able to move and minister to the needs just as he has need of it but this is what he wanted this is what we had needeth I afraid God just helped us that we can grow within this of godly edification Paul would say like this in verse 33 for God is not the author of confusion but of peace as in all churches of the saints now I'm just going to just you know just look at a few things let me just drop a few points here that the the use and of everyone of this of the gifts brother Graham would tell us over and over in different place in the message it's to edify it's to melt together the body of Jesus Christ is not to bring divisions over and over he would say that and I love how brother Brown would say says God's got some to preach the gospel some to teach the gospel some to play music some to be deacons speak with tongues interpret tongs pray for the sick prophets all of those are said in the church to edify it and bring the church together and everything it goes together is to make us love him more brother Brent tells he said seeing visions he said well seeing visions is as natural to me as you getting hungry you just get hungry he said visions just come to me that way then brother Ram goes in to talk about how people are born he said to be singers and is the same quote they born to be singers he talks about how that he was actually going to you know play by piano four four four four Becky and he and his sister meet he walked up there and they were you know gonna try to strike a few chords he said here comes this little eight-year-old boy no brother Brandon when he describes that I'm glad he describes it this way he said here he come he said you know without any shoes on his feet his hairs all messed up and looks all raggedy he don't even look put together he's about that little boy looked at him said what's he trying to do but then said I was just trying to pick out a few chords he said that little boy took ahold that piano he said he started playing songs he said he played silent night he said then he ran over to the star-spangled banner' and I want you to notice by looks he didn't look like he'd have that kind of a gift you know God has a way of just you know he loves to display his majesty God will take things remember like they told about Paul they said all dollars Madi and speech and you know contemptible you know and looks I mean look at him he looks real weak Paul let him know that it is not the man's stature it is the Word of God that Pat's power and here brother Graham tells you said that little boy said he was just a mass he said he was just a master at playing that piano he was born a musician it was a gift to know how to do it there was something in him that just told him how to do it and brother branham he would go on and in another place here he would deal with he says of these nine spiritual gifts and he says now if we'll just it will just let the Holy Spirit have his way they perfectly operate if you just won't get excited and try to just take what you think yourself now I don't think anybody's getting excited here but I think what we need to do is we need to make ourselves available and we're making ourselves even more available to where God how that you if you want to use me you know even testifying it is edifying to the body everything remember what I've said many of these things things that take place in an individual ministry you know there is people that even that I think right now I can't I won't call the individual out but the person that very many times and some of the times that here it is I'll end up getting a card in the mail and I'm not telling you all to send cards but this person they will send me and it has been that way over the years they'll send me and sometimes there's a letter tucked inside of there and the way things are wrote but I can tell you right now it's every time it's precisely right on time and the things that will be mentioned and and just you know just in that time just encouragement and edification you say what do you do with those well well in my office at home I have got four baskets and I'd keep every one of those cards and things that have come in not just from that person but from others as well I get a little down I reach back and I pulled that out and I say aha devil let me just set this up on my desk you can go ahead and read it now I'll get this one that is no different brother branham walking down when he got a little down brother Bram said he would walk down in his den and he would look at his hunting trophies and people probably thought he was looking at his hunting trophies and admired him for the rest of that's not what he was doing he said when he looked back on that hunting trophy sometimes he might see a trinket over here that somebody sent him and he says it takes him back to a time of how God had used him it would encourage him amen oh my boy this is just down where the rubber meets the road in it nothing fancy about this is just straight-out baloney baloney sandwiches tonight but they operate perfectly you know and brother Graham said this is where many times he said people make mistakes people sometimes they get all influenced and kind of heat up a little by the Holy Ghost and but he said it's wonderful to be stimulated but just wait on the Lord he said God God will use us he'll use all that he said just be satisfied you know you're his look what he says he if he wants to use you he'll sure do it he knows where you're at God don't God don't need to say you to have a forward address he knows where you're at now I want you to think of this here in tonight there's three distinct parts and I want to hone in on this part of it there's really three distinct parts with this how can you make a V how can you be make make yourself available to be used or to receive anything from God like this if you stay in it so you Paul all the way through this chapter even when you become together if when you come together if you come together when all of that is dealing will come together how can in the other point how can you be used unless you're in a place spiritually to be used see this is where it comes down to stewardship anything remember Satan is going to be out to try to stifle it always got to be mindful that that don't mean looking around fearful it just means just let your life be refreshed in the love of God Jude would say it in Jude one you know building ourselves up you know most holy faith praying in the Holy Ghost keeping yourselves in the love of God the other thing is is that when we look at this and we think of the whole body now think of this here we come together Thursday nights Sunday nights but us coming together here and how God is will even move right here it's very much that we have to be mindful of what even is done outside of church is that many of the times you know brother Graham said they'd read about st. Martin and you see how the Holy Ghost was moving he said but many people what they fail to look at was st. Martin is how much time he spent in prayer this is these are things that when we look at it I want to just kind of take a little bit of a direction here with this right now in out of Romans 15 Warren and I want to examine in another part of edifying that must be it must be in order for that way even when we come together for there to be edifying and however God is going and however the Lord would use us in Romans 15 1 Paul said we then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves now we know it's not my strong he's talking about fully converted filled with the Holy Ghost let every one of us please his neighbor for his good not not for your good for your neighbors good to edification for even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me hmm so when I when I I'm just just looking at this and moving down through here if we could just I want you two to skip ahead those who run the slide skip ahead to Roman's 14 and you look at this in Romans 14 it's referring now Paul this is what Paul is referring back to for a moment 15 and Paul is dealing with this in verse 17 about the eating meat and and so forth and how that that would seem to be you know a troubling among the the congregation you know because of many of those things were offered to idols and things like that and you know sometimes you had those with the real weak conscience and it could really bother so verse 17 for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost for he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men now this is something where a person is making a decision even inwardly even in regards to how will this affect the body and nobody else in the body knows about it maybe your wife or your husband knows about it but nobody else knows about this decision but yet you look at the situation and you make a choice even though you have Liberty but you realize I'm gonna serve Christ in this right here because I don't want to offend anybody you're with me verse 19 let us therefore follow after that means seek after the things which make for peace and things wherewith one may edify another we want to seek for peace we want to seek for whatever would edify one another not what edifies us because remember that is never of God self edification is never of God that's what Paul is even dealing with in our opening text in first Corinthians 14 26 that was dealing with something of self edification it's not self it's God who uses his gifts so things let's follow after the things which make for beats and things are with one may edify another now Paul comes into this with a meet in verse 24 meat for me you know for the sake of eating meat destroying not the work of God all things indeed are pure but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence now remember some were remember what Paul is dealing with is some they realized that these this meat that they were eating had actually been from an animal that had been offered to an idol to a to a true to another God and so to them in their mind they're looking at it if I eat this because remember when you would bring an offering you also ate of that offering so to them and their mind they're looking at this a person that could be weak in their mind and let me just say it to you like this we are not to look down upon people who would be weak in their mind but you trust by God's grace and through real edification that they grow in the Lord is that right amen so you know it's not like somebody coming in here you know when somebody says whatever the sudden you know I'd come to church here you know but you all have drums you might want to find another church but saying I would come here but you know you all have you know uh you know streaming you might want to find another church then but said no what if they're weak no sometimes there's things we have to really discern out he understand we're looking at some things here and Paul is bringing together here it is good verse 28 verse 21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor anything we're we're we're by thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak I realize this is what Paul and I really want this if you I really want you to zero in on these things right here if there's anything you really even zeroing in even more Paul right here in this remember he is edifying the body edify is to promote Christian wisdom is to build up things that we become we move in by wisdom in these things he is instructing them how to handle things that the body be not hurt that a part of the body would be not hurt because when we come to the house of God looking if there are things that are being done outside how in the world are we gonna have unity inside is that right now you look at this right here Paul didn't have Facebook to deal with we knew Paul didn't have Twitter accounts to deal with we do but it was the same spirit there's just all different kinds of avenues so here you know there when we look at it we the thing with our responsibility Paul is bringing to us a responsibility within our lives but we would live such a life that would edify the body and would not bring divisions oh my let me just let me let me go on here just a little bit there's some things here let me go on in 1st Corinthians 10 verse 23 all things are lawful for me but all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but all things edify not well being whatever Nepal blowing back to me this with the me whatever sold in the shambles that eat asking no question for conscience sake for the earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof pause let him know if you buy meat out of the shambles don't ask where it come from from the besides of its cat or dog girl don't ask where it come from just take it and eat it what for conscience sake pose let them know this is even in your life how to live in victory if any of them that believe not bid you to a feast and ye be disposed to go whatsoever set before you eat asking no question for conscience sake but if any man say unto you this is offered in sacrifice unto idols eat not for his sake that showed it and for his conscience sake for the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof conscience I say not thine own but of the other for why is my liberty judge of another man's cost enough Paul's asking the question what he's wanting him to think for I by grace be a partaker why am i evil spoke enough for that for which I give things whether they're for you eat or drink or whatsoever you do do all to the glory of God give none offence neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the Church of God even as I please all men in all things not seeking mine own profit but the profit of many that they may be saved Paul is teaching the thoughtfulness about the body this is not compromised but you see sometimes listen to me now sometimes the simple edifying is not advertising your liberties there's things I'll tell you that it doesn't matter where you go there's things that still and things that could bother somebody there's things listen to me now I'm getting real personal now there's things that you can post on the internet things that you can put out there and you might say well I've got liberties I've got this and I've got that already you're in a defense you need to think about everything you do you are a representation of the kingdom of God you are a representation of your family you are representation of everything that stands for you are representation of what this message is all about you don't want to be a wrong advertisement of what it's all about there's some things that just you know to say it you say brother Sammy do you get on it I don't get on it at all but I know enough when the Holy Ghost pushes and presses on my heart to know that there are things that don't need to be said there are things that don't need to be mentioned there's a lot of times that there are words and things that are divisive that bring divisions there that calls hindrances here it's true everything except there's got to be an edifying but sometimes they edify is what we in ourselves so you know what somebody may not understand this come on somebody not trying to dig up quotes I'm not I'm gonna put all these quotes out there you're in the wrong spirit God don't want you dividing the word of faith book he wants you living out the word and there might be things that are entirely fine but don't post it we're interested in people being helped not questions arising we know what questions and people's minds arising of what setting here we don't want that we want Jesus Christ when he comes in our midst he has the right alone we have to be mindful of it you see many times we're looking for I want to see the power of God I want to see the power of God and said you and God said I want to see the power of God take control of your fingers the power of God take over your motives the power of God it takes over in humility that says I'm not going to post this preach brother said this is write down where the rubber meets the road is not a time to air at the Flaminius st. right up front it is not a place to air grievances well I've got to get this off my chest how about taking it to the Lord in prayer if you're offended don't go to somebody else and spread and spew your poison to somebody else take it to the Lord in prayer I'm not just preaching to you I'm preaching to you who's on the internet too he's putting everybody is coming right down to a couch near you everybody that's how serious this is edifying that is that that that that in order that the whole egos can work freely and let me just say that is right upfront there's enough of working to keep sin out of the church I don't need people advertising it you said I thought you said are things that were permissible there's some things that undoubtedly do not need to be on the internet who Lord Jesus we don't want to stumble people good good and this yeah I mean there's some pictures you have family pictures you know what they belong in your family album not on the internet come on somebody it's understanding about these things really you know people say well you're not everybody ought to be fine with Christmas now everybody ought to be this but not everybody is hello somebody we're brother Samuel they just need to be mature in the Lord I'll just read scriptures that where within these things we have to be mindful I hope this is clear just to see just as it's coming just as it's I'm just trusting in him I'm not trusting in myself because I need we need him to make it clear but we don't want people to stumble I don't want somebody to stumble amen I'm because to me what God has given us in this hour this glorious revelation this message that brings about a living reality of the Lord Jesus Christ it brings us from off the pages and brings it right down real in our life it's a life changing word that brings sons and daughters of God in the full maturity back into their sonship amen it's circumcise us places us back into the company why it is a promise that God has made in this hour we don't want any leaven we want the crew the Christ of God we want the Lord Jesus Christ to have full preeminence in our life and I'll say it like this if there's pictures and whatever more that you've got that you know oh those deftly shouldn't be posted they might even be things that you leave a one in your family album old Jesus they might be things where you need to think about how you're dressing things you're doing you might need to just say Lord I want to dispose of this but dispose of anything in me that is not edifying you because everything we do brother Brandon brought us down into this and I'm closing brother Brent brings us down and reminds us in the adoption series and he tells us he says you must remember he says your walk with God he said how he said you must be in harmony with God and harmony with one another and he dealt with that and he took us into Eichen how aiken got into things and aiken troubled the body and they just say it to you like this we're not here to have a pity party for the devil if there's something where the devil has pulled any wool over any eyes we are here as sons and daughters of God to say get out of here you don't have no place here are you with I believe that that we need that we really need this this should be a real edification I'm not saying we don't have it but I just say as the Lord just bringing it to my heart I I just felt pressed to come back into this here this week and let me just close here Ephesians 4:29 we'll just close on this one let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth corrupt a meaning it's kinkers okay it's Pinker but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister grace unto the hearers brother Brian would tell us like this he says in Christ the mystery when he gave look he took time in the beginning of Christ a mystery and I thought you know I've said this many times over but I look at the things that were said such counsel in the beginning of that message Christ as the mystery of God revealed and such counsel he gave us as a body of believers for what reason that Christ the mystery may be clearly displayed in our lives it's not the big foxes that spoil the vines it's the little foxes that spoil the vines but bream says love one another any love one another anyhow talk nice about one another he said say nice things about one other he said and then the Holy Spirit is pleased I want to talk about making things up I'm not talking I'm making things up that ain't you that I mean you just that's lying to that's a real good faith no God don't want you to lie that's not edification that's falsehood but there's there there's things that that that you know that when we when we look at it that there's things that we can say to be able to minister grace to one another and to edify things that we can say the brand wouldn't even say it like this he said when you know he said maybe he said there's a little something between this brother and this brother he said don't say anything that would side or stir this brother up against man he said but on the contrary he said say something about this brother drops some things about this brother he said that will provoke this other one provoke unto love and good works but say I'm just saying but what you're saying is the word and the word has power within it amen when I talk about making things up but we're talking about edifying edifying let let no corrupt communication and we you and I we all know hey we've learned this from when we was in kindergarten and preschool if you ain't got nothing good to say something you got a visual image already don't say nothing at all right the Bible says Alya live peaceably with all men as much as lieth within you Amen help me Jesus a bad let's pray Lord God Lord were well Lord it's just we're glad to have been here tonight Lord the instruction that you would give us and you would speak to us and you would teach us Lord your desire within our hearts our lives is that in all things and Lord that you would be edified your body would be edified lord help us every one of us realizing a stewardship that everybody has Lord someone here they may never sing a special they may never even get up to testify but Lord they are fervent prayer warrior it's something that maybe is not seen or all-together noticed but father we know the effects of it Lord I pray God even here tonight for for them and for every person in here Lord may it be Lord from every heart that we're we are yield and Lord to where that your body can be edified to realize the Lord that and I believe we realize it the Lord you would help us to be more sensitive that's why you bring these things to us you stir up our pure minds you may help us to be sensitive with it Lord to be to think a little bit more Lord for those Lord that maybe they have Lord there there there there social media that they share things with family Lord then truly it be alright things that they do Lord with their job but God I pray that you would help each and every one to realize even in those channels even in all of those Lord even in our fellowship let it be or that everything is done to edification not about ourselves but thinking about others how would this be perceived how could this be follow Lord there's a lot of different liberties I've thought about it many times there's certain things even Lord of myself just for just that may be the limited place is Lord at times that I've went to preach and Lord sometimes you just can no you just haven't it can be a little sensitive with things Lord I don't want to do anything that would offend somebody if I know something that would Lord would offend them maybe there's something about it Lord with a song or what everyone I don't want to offend nobody I want to edify the body of Jesus Christ I don't want anything to be a hindrance and I believe God that's the heart that that beats here tonight that every life Lord as a son and daughter of God they want to do that which is pleasing to you nor to be able to edify the body of Jesus Christ to be a vessel that is set aside that's used of you Lord for your glory God I pray tonight Lord forgive us Lord in areas Lord that where we've let down God as your grace comes to minister may it Lord the searching within the hearts man not cease but may it continue to move forward may this become Lord that which is ever before us now to realize that in everything that we do may it be Lord - they had a fine of the body for your glory Lord bless your children tonight blessing Lord may you watch over and Lord refresh them tonight Lord even these things that they take Lord and can be talked Lord in devotions talked over Lord at the dinner table Lord can be looked at Lord and and really just to reflect and pray about Lord are lovest to you when we come together all the Lord it's something special Lord you said you'd be in our midst and Lord we see it we see its service after service of Lord and Lord we want you to know that we thank you Lord we realize that this is not something that we just come into church and turn it on no its life lives that's lived outside of church and I pray that God if there's any that's here tonight that's not living up to the standard of the word where they ought to be I pray they feel so ashamed in their heart that God that they would repent that they would Lord ask God for your mercy and say lord help me to be the kind of a Christian that Lord is a representation and would actually point to what this real this message is all about that somebody could look at me and they would know granite Lord we pray [Music] we love your Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
