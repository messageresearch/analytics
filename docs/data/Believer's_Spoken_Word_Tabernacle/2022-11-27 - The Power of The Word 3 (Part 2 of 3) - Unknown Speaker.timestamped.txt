[0:00] wow but it would not just be that of the
[0:03] Lord Jesus this was God announcing it's
[0:07] now God is going to come to his Temple
[0:11] and talking about his his his chosen
[0:15] vessels well Peter would speak to you
[0:18] and I Lively stones
[0:20] that have been cut out in our different
[0:23] making and you know what the stones are
[0:25] all different we're all different in our
[0:27] makeup we're all different in the way
[0:29] that even we look at things that shows
[0:31] our our how we are positioned as the
[0:34] body of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit
[0:37] never came to do away with our angle of
[0:40] perception the Holy Spirit Come to blend
[0:43] together in a paradox the body of Jesus
[0:46] Christ that is yoked together for one
[0:50] purpose that's the mystery of it all
[0:52] that it's God's Oneness working through
[0:55] different vessels
[0:57] and that's still something I'll just say
[0:59] from me that's still something that I
[1:01] come more and more into the realization
[1:03] of you say brother Sammy what do you say
[1:05] then you're not going to think like me
[1:07] and I'm not going to think like you but
[1:09] oh let his thoughts be my thoughts
[1:12] right because I'm not here to change in
[1:14] I'm not here to change your thoughts
[1:16] you're not here to change my thoughts
[1:17] you see that's what debating that's what
[1:19] all this Strife comes about God's not
[1:22] interested in you sing it my way or me
[1:24] saying no no he himself is the one to be
[1:27] glorified
[1:28] Hallelujah not let us build another Camp
[1:31] let us build another Doctrine let us
[1:34] build more fences the day's offenses are
[1:37] over
[1:38] [Applause]
[1:41] there are you hearing me now defenses
[1:43] are still there if you allow them but if
[1:45] you allow the Holy Spirit to move in
[1:47] your life the spirit of God will raise
[1:50] above every fence to where the fence is
[1:53] no longer in view God doesn't tear
[1:55] fences down the Holy Spirit comes in to
[1:58] raise the standard above the fence
[2:01] oh glory be to God
[2:05] so while notice let us let us make here
[2:07] three Tabernacles one for thee one for
[2:10] Moses one for Elijah God said no no no
[2:12] we're not going to come that way we're
[2:13] you got to come and see it my way no no
[2:15] no no no no no no no no more of that
[2:17] well he's fake
[2:19] Behold a bright Cloud
[2:21] overshadowed them and then somehow God's
[2:24] going to answer the question he's not
[2:26] going to debate him God comes and
[2:28] vindicates his word
[2:30] God's not going to debate no Peter Peter
[2:32] you got it wrong no God God is able and
[2:35] this is the same way he does for you and
[2:36] I God comes and our thoughts are changed
[2:40] as he vindicates his word
[2:45] a bright Cloud overshadowed him and
[2:47] behold a voice out of that cloud
[2:52] Glory which said this is what the voice
[2:56] that came out of the cloud said this is
[2:58] my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[3:02] hear ye him
[3:05] yeah God was declaring he was indeed
[3:10] tabernacled and this is the final
[3:12] Authority
[3:15] this then was taking place was the
[3:18] adoption ceremony
[3:20] this in Matthew 17
[3:23] was prophecy of where the bride stands
[3:27] in this hour to where the body would
[3:30] come to completion and would come under
[3:32] the adoption of the very person of Jesus
[3:36] Christ moving into the body of Believers
[3:40] and God declaring hear ye him because we
[3:45] have no other message to preach the
[3:47] spirit and the bride are saying the same
[3:50] thing who is this saying the same thing
[3:52] the spirit the prophet and the bride are
[3:55] all saying the same thing
[3:59] glory be to God so now this real Mount
[4:04] Transfiguration experience this is where
[4:07] Jesus was glorified before the disciples
[4:10] notice the chapter before is where out
[4:14] of Peter that representation that was in
[4:17] there the whole time
[4:20] spoke out and declared Thou Art the
[4:23] Christ the son of the Living God
[4:26] the chapter before
[4:28] so now in the word revelation has come
[4:32] this is the truth
[4:34] this is the way walk you in it this is
[4:38] the path to life
[4:41] now comes Matthew 17 to where now God is
[4:46] declaring them this is the final
[4:49] Authority on the word
[4:52] you see this is why in this age God
[4:57] would reveal himself in his message that
[5:00] he is the amen
[5:03] the amen is the final word the amen is
[5:06] the Soviet the amen is thee that which
[5:09] cannot be argued that which cannot be
[5:11] disputed he is the amen oh my don't you
[5:16] see how wonderful it is that when you as
[5:19] it says on Isaiah will bless yourself in
[5:22] the god of Truth which is the god of the
[5:25] amen what a blessing it is when the word
[5:29] comes your way and you surrender to that
[5:31] word what are you receiving you are
[5:33] receiving the a man of God as the word
[5:37] is coming into your life it is the so be
[5:41] it and nothing can argue or withstand
[5:45] that word and when the baptism of the
[5:47] Holy Ghost has come that seal of the
[5:50] Living God it is the amen upon your life
[5:53] it is God a Manning his own word
[5:58] [Applause]
[6:00] many scriptures we can run with that but
[6:03] we stay here right here this morning
[6:05] because it was the revelation of Matthew
[6:08] 16 that led to the glorification in
[6:12] Matthew 17 in that body of Believers so
[6:16] so we say it in this way
[6:20] this is why brother Brandon would refer
[6:22] to this Mount Transfiguration experience
[6:24] I want to just drop these in here he's
[6:26] asking the Lord here in uh this day the
[6:29] scripture is fulfilled he says we ask
[6:31] you to hide us tonight behind the word
[6:33] blind us to the things of the world and
[6:36] let us see Jesus
[6:38] May there be a mount Transfiguration
[6:41] experience Among Us that we see no man
[6:45] save Jesus only that's my heart's desire
[6:49] man then we see no man but Jesus only
[6:53] to the bride that's who we want to see
[6:55] that's who we long to see that's why we
[6:57] come to the house of God we've not come
[6:59] to see a man we've not come to see a
[7:01] vessel we come to see Jesus Christ
[7:05] and if you can receive it in this way
[7:07] that the word itself as we come to the
[7:10] house of God that's why brother Ram says
[7:12] coming to church doesn't save you it
[7:14] keeps you in Fellowship because that
[7:17] Fellowship is to be between you and God
[7:19] under the blood and so the ministering
[7:22] of the word it's God's love for you and
[7:25] I that if things sometimes could kind of
[7:28] creep and things could go this way and
[7:30] I'm not all together talking about Sin
[7:32] but God's desire is to keep us sensitive
[7:35] that when we are even outside of these
[7:39] walls we realize we are receiving from
[7:43] God
[7:46] true
[7:48] that's right
[7:49] amen yes
[7:51] that's our position
[7:54] that's our Authority as Sons and
[7:56] Daughters of God
[7:59] oh sometimes how we allow the enemy to
[8:03] sell us too short
[8:08] now notice in the Easter seal I'm just
[8:11] laying these in here this is where I'm
[8:13] going
[8:14] it says notice when they looked around
[8:16] speaking in Matthew 17.
[8:18] with all this power upon them they saw
[8:23] Jesus only
[8:25] with all this power this inspiration
[8:28] upon him this is what they saw you see
[8:31] this is the purpose of the Holy Ghost
[8:35] Jesus said when the spirit of Truth is
[8:39] come
[8:40] he will lead and guide you into all
[8:43] truth he will take the things that I
[8:46] have spoken and reveal them unto you
[8:50] he will not bear witness of himself
[8:53] meaning that the spirit of God will
[8:55] never highlight the vessel that he's
[8:58] speaking through but he will continue to
[9:01] exalt the Lord Jesus Christ because in
[9:05] that word is the finishing work of
[9:08] everything you say finishing brother
[9:10] Samuel but you don't know my need but
[9:12] the reality is you're already loosed by
[9:16] the blood of Jesus Christ for what's
[9:19] needed is the reality of freedom
[9:25] you're already loose you're already
[9:27] healed
[9:28] see that's why the preaching of the word
[9:30] is to bring our faith up into a finished
[9:33] work that's why the preaching of the
[9:35] word is to Cast Away evil spirits
[9:37] hindering spirits that we can walk and
[9:40] really receive what God has for us
[9:43] when they looked around with all this
[9:45] power upon them they saw Jesus only and
[9:48] the real True Believer don't care
[9:50] whether he's backing up denomination or
[9:52] nothing he's not looking for their
[9:54] backing he only wants
[9:57] one thing
[9:58] for you to see that glorified Christ
[10:02] a real true Mount Transfiguration
[10:05] experience how many say granted Lord
[10:08] a real true Maps Transfiguration
[10:11] experience all only
[10:13] glorifies Jesus Christ
[10:17] it didn't glorify Moses
[10:20] it didn't glorify Elijah it didn't
[10:23] glorify themselves it don't glorify
[10:25] nothing else but they seem the glorified
[10:28] Christ and any True Believer that's
[10:31] what's in his heart is to glorify Jesus
[10:34] Christ that's what he's trying to get
[10:36] the people to see
[10:37] [Applause]
[10:38] that's all of our desire right
[10:42] oh not not to say if you come join our
[10:45] groups you come do this or that oh no
[10:47] don't do that see God's word which is
[10:50] Christ magnified and the promise the
[10:55] promise fulfilled of this day in this
[10:58] great Resurrection this is what gives us
[11:01] joy to know that we are with him a flesh
[11:04] of his flesh and bone of him Bones what
[11:07] a joy that's the only thing that a real
[11:11] believer cares about
[11:13] foreign
[11:15] is that he would be glorified
[11:19] because him being glorified in our lives
[11:24] through the new birth through that
[11:26] Revelation working in our lives where
[11:29] that change has come what does it do it
[11:31] glorifies the work of Calvary and the
[11:36] resurrection
[11:38] it glorifies the Lord Jesus Christ
[11:42] it takes away all the works and all the
[11:45] isms and all the ideas of man and it
[11:48] exalts Jesus Christ
[11:50] that's God's desire he said if I be
[11:53] lifted up I will draw all men unto me
[11:58] now back in our scripture here of Romans
[12:02] 12 verse 2 hear the admonition be not
[12:05] conformed to this world
[12:09] I think of it there is pressure that's
[12:11] all around we could spend a multitude of
[12:14] time that's on that phrase there's
[12:16] pressure all around that desires to
[12:20] cause us to conform
[12:21] right yep
[12:24] true if I can say it and so much and I
[12:27] don't want to get caught in this here
[12:28] because we could just spend a lot of
[12:30] time there are so many things that comes
[12:33] even via messages
[12:37] music
[12:40] right television
[12:43] right all those things that come all the
[12:46] way through there
[12:50] well we got quiet
[12:53] okay this is why
[12:57] we understand Satan's desire you know
[12:59] Satan has a Doctrine he wants to get
[13:01] across
[13:04] Satan Satan his his angels are ministers
[13:07] of Life they're not just preachers but
[13:10] there's a doctrine that Satan is
[13:11] preaching as well
[13:15] his desire is to seduce to tear down to
[13:18] get things all tangled up and to become
[13:20] pressurized and now you know you're
[13:22] right we can say oh I'll tell you I'll
[13:25] never succumb to that I'll never really
[13:27] because when I look at these things
[13:29] still brother Brown tells us the
[13:31] pressure that you and I in this age that
[13:34] we are under is that of a soft Easy
[13:36] Living
[13:38] striving to get to a spot to where oh
[13:41] man I can finally relax instead of
[13:43] realizing that it's not of us just so
[13:47] exerting ourselves to a point of failure
[13:50] but it is placing God first in
[13:54] everything I tell you if we would ask
[13:57] him and ask his leadership ask his
[14:00] counsel instead of presuming many things
[14:03] we'd be in a lot better shape because
[14:05] after all the number one purpose that we
[14:07] are here for is to serve God
[14:11] and to serve God is the Tabernacle deity
[14:16] that's our number one purpose if if
[14:18] outside of that and remember
[14:20] Satan's desire is to send all these
[14:23] other things in to try to get out of us
[14:26] what God desires to place in US
[14:31] you remember Christ the mystery brother
[14:32] Brian said you let your job you let your
[14:34] wife you let your this you let your you
[14:35] let you let you let you let all these
[14:37] other things
[14:39] get it out
[14:42] see God instills into you and I even as
[14:46] the word will come in a service like
[14:48] this
[14:49] and sometimes we just walk out instead
[14:52] of praying about it
[14:55] instead of asking God
[14:57] be it unto me Lord
[14:59] according to Thy Word
[15:02] because the whole law you remember where
[15:04] we started
[15:05] in Jarred in the Kingdom the whole law
[15:07] of the kingdom is governed by ask
[15:11] and you shall receive
[15:13] right but for the same thing he's
[15:14] showing me these things he took him out
[15:16] to the field and said look he upon the
[15:18] field it's white for Harvest pray you to
[15:19] the Lord of harvest that he will send
[15:21] laborers into the vineyard
[15:23] sometimes what it is God Is Not slack
[15:26] fulfilling and doing his part
[15:28] but the slackness comes down
[15:31] in our part
[15:33] will be something we're going to get
[15:34] caught there but it is difficult
[15:38] but be you transformed
[15:41] by the renewing
[15:43] of your mind
[15:45] this is how we are transformed is by the
[15:49] renewing of your mind
[15:52] and Titus 3 verse 3 for we ourselves
[15:54] also were sometimes foolish disobedient
[15:57] deceived serving divers lusts and
[16:00] Pleasures living in Malice and in be
[16:02] hateful and hating one another
[16:04] but after that the kindness and love of
[16:06] God our savior toward man appeared not
[16:09] by works of righteousness which we have
[16:12] done we believe in works of
[16:13] righteousness right
[16:15] I mean when God deals with your heart
[16:17] you start you start you move into the
[16:19] works of righteousness but this this is
[16:23] not come by our works of righteousness
[16:26] so it because in other words it would be
[16:29] us exalting our own efforts
[16:33] right
[16:34] Works themselves is what is to follow
[16:37] faith
[16:39] our faith then becomes demonstrated or
[16:43] manifested by works
[16:46] amen notice not by works of
[16:48] righteousness which we have done but
[16:51] according to his Mercy he saved us
[16:56] oh my aren't you glad for the mercy of
[16:58] God
[16:59] bye now notice here it is by the washing
[17:03] of regeneration and renewing of the Holy
[17:07] Ghost which he shed on us abundantly
[17:12] through Jesus Christ Our Savior that
[17:15] being justified by his grace we should
[17:18] be made heirs according to the hope of
[17:21] eternal life so he saved us by the
[17:24] washing of regeneration
[17:27] and renewing of the holy spirit it's the
[17:30] it's the same it's the same working it's
[17:33] God through the washing of regeneration
[17:36] it's the Holy Spirit coming out that
[17:38] does what as the holy spirit is being
[17:41] poured out it's there to wash us it's
[17:44] there to come upon that seed in order
[17:47] that the seed May rot and die oh my I
[17:51] just got to preach when he's here like
[17:52] this you realize that when the word is
[17:55] coming in that way that sometimes
[17:58] there's a showdown where people can come
[18:00] in their life and say I don't know about
[18:02] that I don't know if I can give that up
[18:04] and or I've tried this sir I've tried
[18:06] that but what should I do just stand in
[18:09] the washing of Water by the word because
[18:11] the word itself if you'll just submit to
[18:14] it it'll rot away every thought that is
[18:19] against the word
[18:21] the word has the power to break it down
[18:25] it has the power to wash away every
[18:29] thought that is against the word of God
[18:31] just submit to it though you know many
[18:33] times as I said it was standing people
[18:35] say oh no you don't have to do that I
[18:37] don't need to do that I don't but let
[18:38] the word because we are Washed by the
[18:41] Water of the word and that word became
[18:45] blood
[18:47] that he might wash us
[18:52] we're not here under a theological point
[18:55] this morning
[18:58] we're here to be washed with the
[19:02] bleeding word of almighty God
[19:05] has provided the blood that we might be
[19:10] washed from the filth of our life he has
[19:14] provided his blood which the blood of
[19:17] Christ is the spirit of God that has
[19:20] been released I wasn't there when the
[19:23] blood was shed I was in him but the
[19:26] spirit of God Is What comes forth the
[19:29] life that was within that blood cell
[19:31] that life that created blood cell that
[19:34] created that body the blood that brought
[19:36] Mary in condition that same life is now
[19:40] moving throughout the Earth it's
[19:42] sounding the Jubilee trumpet it lets you
[19:45] and I know the atonement has been made
[19:48] you were included in the atonement what
[19:52] do I have to do throw it down
[19:55] throw down sin
[19:58] throw down unbelief
[20:00] throw it down
[20:09] I'll tell you what this washing of
[20:10] regeneration does
[20:12] it takes your mind
[20:14] that you can look at yourself and say
[20:16] how could this be me how could you just
[20:18] stay in this water
[20:19] you hear me Ruth you stay in this field
[20:23] you understand what I'm talking about
[20:25] you stay in the field that Boaz is
[20:28] appearing in
[20:30] and every handful that he drops pick it
[20:34] up because every handful is a handful of
[20:37] purpose you need that all but I want the
[20:40] full thing just abide in the purpose
[20:43] because he is the full thing
[20:46] one handful after another leads to that
[20:55] blue Samuel what should I be captivated
[20:57] with him
[21:00] him
[21:01] him
[21:03] that's what she was captivated with and
[21:06] she still didn't know the full reality
[21:07] when she went back and told Naomi but
[21:09] then Naomi being a type of the Old
[21:11] Testament and Naomi what could she do
[21:12] she could point out this is him that was
[21:16] prophesied this is him that was spoken
[21:19] of and whatsoever he says unto you do it
[21:24] you see the New Testament never did away
[21:26] with the authority of the Old Testament
[21:28] or you hear him in the house it didn't
[21:30] do away with the law it just establishes
[21:33] the law in the place in the heart of the
[21:36] believer where it is intended to be
[21:39] glory be to God in the highest oh my
[21:41] washing
[21:43] oh well the devil tells me why you don't
[21:46] why are you listening to him
[21:49] I'll tell you right now you wouldn't
[21:51] listen to a liar you know you work with
[21:52] something
[21:54] I'm being frank but we talk about this
[21:57] we quote more what the devil says
[21:59] instead of what God's saying
[22:01] well the devil's telling me that what
[22:03] are you doing quoting a liar
[22:06] man
[22:08] he's a liar
[22:11] don't even give him any room in your
[22:14] mind or your spirit
[22:17] take what God has said
[22:20] amen washing of Water by regeneration
[22:24] it's a word that's breaking down you it
[22:27] broke down me it breaks what does it do
[22:30] it breaks down the old Shell
[22:35] that that germ of life on the inside
[22:38] can come forth
[22:43] hmm
[22:45] this is why Jesus could say in Matthew
[22:48] 19 28
[22:49] that ye which have followed me in the
[22:53] Regeneration in the whole of the new
[22:56] birth you have followed me notice who
[22:58] has been followed we follow him
[23:03] are you hearing me we follow him
[23:05] following him just as he told them you
[23:08] will be placed upon 12 Thrones judging
[23:10] the 12 tribes of Israel right if you
[23:14] follow me
[23:15] now think about that following him in
[23:18] that of the new birth the Regeneration
[23:21] lifts you above the world
[23:24] it places you in a place of judgment to
[23:29] discern between right and wrong
[23:32] it places you in a place of authority
[23:35] you couldn't do that I couldn't do that
[23:37] he shall set me upon a rock
[23:42] he hath hid me
[23:46] right
[23:47] this was why brother Brandon would go on
[23:49] to say he said you let the holy spirit
[23:50] this out of power transformation you let
[23:52] the Holy Spirit come upon any person
[23:54] that's truly got something down there a
[23:57] healing comes from the inside
[24:01] my I wish I could really preach on that
[24:03] that let that healing come from the
[24:06] spirit that's in you
[24:09] you realize there's healing going on
[24:12] even in your mortal body yes
[24:14] you realize even right here over the
[24:16] years now I'm talking to hearts and
[24:18] lives that have been sealed Away by the
[24:21] spirit of God you know there's healing
[24:22] taking place
[24:24] you say brother Samuel healing yeah God
[24:27] by the washing of Water by the word he's
[24:31] tearing down complexes
[24:34] he's tearing down things that happen to
[24:37] you as a young person he's tearing it
[24:40] down
[24:42] what's happening healing is coming from
[24:44] the inside
[24:48] ain't one that's on the inside of you is
[24:50] the same one that'll make the Desert
[24:52] Blossom like a rose it's the same God
[24:54] that moves in every facet of your life
[24:57] oh my he's the same God that where there
[25:00] is barrenness he's the same God that'll
[25:03] cause water to come flowing through our
[25:07] lives
[25:08] it's healing taking place
[25:11] oh God I wish I could preach on that
[25:14] notice if it's a genuine Spirit
[25:17] anointing the genuine seed it can't do
[25:21] nothing but bear a DOT a son and
[25:23] daughter of God but the genuine Spirit
[25:25] he can come upon a Cocker Barrel seed
[25:27] and the rain can fall upon a Cocker
[25:29] Barrel it'll make it live just the same
[25:31] as it falls upon a wheat and makes it
[25:33] live
[25:34] oh well brother Sammy you know I and
[25:36] then I I might just be a Cocker bro
[25:38] there you go quoting that liar again
[25:42] the same devil that wanted to interpret
[25:44] it to you
[25:45] you say brother Samuel what's the
[25:47] difference I'll tell you what the
[25:48] difference is what's the desire in your
[25:51] heart
[25:52] because a kookaburra don't see the need
[25:55] for a change the Kookaburra is fine
[25:58] being a kookaburra as long as it can
[26:00] have an anointing once in a while but a
[26:03] genuine wheat seed on the inside has a
[26:05] desire for Jesus Christ to be glorified
[26:09] it's a desire to see his word fulfill in
[26:12] our life
[26:13] come on the word is still a discerner
[26:18] oh my this is why Jesus could say in
[26:22] John 6 when his disciples were murmuring
[26:24] you know and they were saying you know
[26:27] and he asked him he said does this
[26:29] offend you
[26:30] and you know everything he said except
[26:32] you eat the Flesh of the son of man and
[26:34] drink his blood you have to be a
[26:35] partaker of the word remember when
[26:38] Melchizedek made Abraham he gave him
[26:40] Bread and Wine
[26:42] you got to be a partaker of the Flesh
[26:45] and the blood
[26:47] are you hearing me now
[26:49] yeah you see you got to have both you
[26:51] can't just have one of the other there's
[26:52] got to be both that's what true
[26:53] worshipers are
[26:54] right it's a party he gave to us what is
[26:58] necessary
[26:59] that's what he gave to them on the day
[27:00] of Pentecost was Flesh and Blood his
[27:03] word and his life now notice it is the
[27:07] spirit Jesus said it's a spirit that
[27:09] quickens I want you to say I don't put
[27:10] these up there I just want you to listen
[27:11] to these it is the spirit that
[27:14] quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing
[27:20] setting the service and maybe listen to
[27:22] a tape or something you might feel like
[27:24] man I don't feel like I've got nothing
[27:27] that's your flesh
[27:29] I said that's your flesh
[27:32] your flesh come on now it can talk
[27:34] because you're sitting right here well
[27:35] you know and you ain't getting nothing
[27:36] you know you ain't getting nowhere you
[27:38] ain't a mountain to nothing God will
[27:40] never tell you that
[27:42] amen God will never do that you can't
[27:44] show me one place in the scripture that
[27:46] God ever said that
[27:48] as a matter of fact God never
[27:49] discouraged the ten spies from going
[27:51] into the land
[27:52] it was their own unbelief in the love of
[27:56] God
[27:58] are you hearing me now
[28:00] so here the flesh profit is nothing
[28:04] well just as examples come we'll give it
[28:06] brother Brandon tells us in fundamental
[28:08] Foundation of Faith one of the many
[28:09] places he said wow the white Moody was
[28:12] even preaching let alone in his own
[28:14] meetings but he gives an example he said
[28:16] even Dwight Moody won and even Martin
[28:19] Luther he said that they didn't preach
[28:21] Divine Healing he said but showing while
[28:23] they preached the word he said there
[28:26] were lives that were healed while the
[28:29] word was being preached right he said
[28:32] I've sent my word to heal my people
[28:36] hold glory and lives can set them
[28:39] remember brother Brown said here was a
[28:41] woman who was sitting here and here the
[28:43] spirit of God will call her out and say
[28:44] sister you did not think you had enough
[28:46] Faith to be healed he said but you've
[28:48] already been healed see her thoughts
[28:51] about her own faith were wrong God's
[28:53] thoughts were right
[28:56] oh God help us
[28:59] [Applause]
[29:00] God help us God help us to get rid of
[29:03] our own stinking thinking like brother
[29:04] John LaFontaine would call it get end of
[29:06] our own thoughts
[29:08] and receive the thoughts of God
[29:14] the flesh profited nothing the words
[29:16] notice the words that I speak unto you
[29:19] they are spirit and they are life
[29:25] oh my and notice he said but the Bible
[29:28] said there were some who believe not
[29:29] think of it setting under the ministry
[29:31] of the Lord Jesus here in the Messiah
[29:33] and yet there were those who did not
[29:35] believe why they were not ordained
[29:39] are you with me this is why Jesus said
[29:42] no man in that same scripture no man can
[29:44] come unto me except thou except that
[29:46] we're given unto him and my father let
[29:48] me tell you something if you have a draw
[29:49] to the word you are blessed
[29:53] for the same now how can you say that
[29:54] because the scripture said blessed are
[29:56] they who do hunger and first after
[29:58] righteousness for you shall be filled
[30:01] how can you be filled if you don't have
[30:03] a hunger
[30:04] and how could you have a hunger and not
[30:05] be blessed when God spoke to Mary he
[30:08] said blessed art thou among women
[30:11] before she ever received the Angel's
[30:14] message the angel came to announce to
[30:17] her you are blessed among women
[30:22] are you hearing me Church the word comes
[30:25] not to throw you down the word comes to
[30:28] lift up a son and daughter of God that
[30:30] you realize I am coming to the table of
[30:33] the Lord not as a beggar not as a
[30:35] servant not as one who is unworthy I am
[30:38] coming through the call of the blood
[30:40] that voice of the blood of a worthy one
[30:43] who has made me Worthy
[30:45] [Applause]
[30:48] glory be to God
[30:50] what's he doing breaking down traditions
[30:52] of well I got to do this so long I got
[30:54] to do that so long I thought God
[30:56] delivered you out of those roads Hail
[30:58] Marys
[31:00] I thought God delivered you out of them
[31:03] prayer beads
[31:04] oh no
[31:06] I thought God delivered you out of that
[31:08] Pentecostalism
[31:11] I said God did that
[31:13] oh I see what it is now what it is
[31:16] healing has got to come from the inside
[31:19] [Applause]
[31:21] oh my don't you love him
[31:25] but from that time the Bible said
[31:27] many of them said adios
[31:30] from that time the Bible said many walk
[31:33] no more with him
[31:36] when they got down real tight
[31:39] they said can't go this this is this is
[31:42] too much
[31:43] but them said it like this and say
[31:45] message power transformation he said oh
[31:47] he said it just seemed like you know
[31:49] long time ago when Church Life when the
[31:52] prophet had something to say thus saith
[31:53] the Lord the people would move and they
[31:55] stained right with it they moved but now
[31:57] he said it's kind of like I don't like
[31:59] that guy vote him out and oh he said
[32:01] they don't have no understanding no more
[32:02] the people just don't move by the spirit
[32:05] of God anymore
[32:08] God's word is his Spirit oh I love this
[32:11] let's just hone in right here God's word
[32:14] is his spirit and his word comes to his
[32:17] prophet and the prophet is supposed is
[32:20] the word the word is supposed to
[32:22] transform you
[32:24] from what the things of the world are
[32:27] into the image of Sons and Daughters of
[32:31] God
[32:32] so God's word is a spirit and that word
[32:36] is to transform us from the things of
[32:40] the world and into the image of Sons and
[32:43] Daughters of God and I said the word can
[32:45] only come through these prophets as they
[32:47] spoke it had to be compared with a word
[32:49] and showed that it was the word then if
[32:51] you can accept that word it'll transform
[32:56] you
[32:58] if you can accept that word it'll
[33:00] transform you from a son or daughter of
[33:03] the world uh daughter of the world to a
[33:06] son and daughter of God now he said how
[33:08] many in here has had that experience how
[33:10] many years had that experience
[33:13] he said we've had that experience
[33:14] because it was spoke now I want you to
[33:17] hone in here because it was spoke what
[33:20] was spoke the word of God it was
[33:23] believed and the word came forth and
[33:27] fell into the bed of the heart and there
[33:30] it growed right out of it see he said
[33:33] transforming yourself his holy spirit
[33:37] transforms the seed word into his
[33:40] likeness if a pear tree brings forth a
[33:43] pair apple tree and apple things like
[33:45] that his word will bring forth Sons and
[33:47] Daughters of God that's what it's
[33:50] supposed to do
[33:52] so the word of God is is not come forth
[33:55] to give separate Tabernacles the word of
[33:58] God has not come forth to highlight any
[34:01] man highlight any church but the word of
[34:03] God has come forth to highlight Jesus
[34:07] Christ to exalt him and to bring him
[34:12] into the place where he desires in the
[34:16] heart of his children
[34:19] [Music]
[34:22] the same same quote he said one day when
[34:25] the world lay in darkness and Chaos so
[34:27] like like it was in Genesis 1.
[34:30] again notice it was in that same
[34:32] condition again the spirit of God moved
[34:36] upon in the predestinated seed a
[34:39] predestinated seed the predestinated it
[34:41] was transformed it took Isaiah 9 6.
[34:46] Behold a virgin shall conceive
[34:49] so now that light the only way that
[34:53] light could come life could come that
[34:56] would bring a transformation is God had
[35:01] to come in a way that it would pay the
[35:05] price that that life could come back
[35:08] upon the worshiper and bring us back
[35:12] into Fellowship under the blood back
[35:15] into that position back into that place
[35:17] to where our lives are tabernacling
[35:20] deity now the Bible says in John 1 1 in
[35:24] the beginning was the word and the Word
[35:26] was with God and the Word was God the
[35:28] same was in the beginning with God all
[35:30] things were made by him and without him
[35:33] was not anything made that was made in
[35:35] him was life and the life was the light
[35:40] of men
[35:41] in verse 14 and the Word was made flesh
[35:45] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[35:47] glory the glory as the only begotten of
[35:50] the father full of grace and truth so it
[35:52] comes from thought to word to flesh
[35:57] that's the pathway that the word travels
[36:00] to become flesh
[36:03] from thought to word to flesh now we
[36:07] understand that you know as we have the
[36:10] Bible and we thank God you know for the
[36:12] lives that the burden became upon the
[36:14] hearts of men like Tyndale and all the
[36:16] rest of them God put that burden there
[36:18] that you and I could have it
[36:20] is that right God knew what we would
[36:23] need in this hour this is why when when
[36:26] the seals themselves have been opened
[36:28] and it's him coming down and it's him
[36:31] that is standing in the midst of his
[36:34] church
[36:35] it is him that is standing in the midst
[36:38] of his bride that's what that seventh
[36:41] seal is
[36:42] it's the coming of the Lord you know
[36:45] there's folds of his coming it's him
[36:48] coming back in to his church
[36:51] that's the quickening power that's the
[36:53] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost
[36:55] he's the one who's in our midst
[36:59] the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ
[37:03] not a Doctrine not another Tabernacle
[37:06] it's him who's in our midst
[37:08] [Music]
[37:10] that's why when brother Brown preaches
[37:12] the seventh seal what's he saved the
[37:15] whole time he is
