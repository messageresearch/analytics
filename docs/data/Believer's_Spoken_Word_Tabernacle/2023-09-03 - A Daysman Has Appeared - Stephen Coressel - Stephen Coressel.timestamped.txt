[33:50] to meet us this morning Lord Jesus to
[33:53] speak to our hearts o God now Lord Jesus
[33:56] as our Prophet taught us we come to the
[33:57] most important part of the service we
[33:59] pray God that you would take the words
[34:01] this morning Lord and just speak to each
[34:03] Heart Lord God Lord God if my thoughts
[34:06] in the study that I've done would mean
[34:08] nothing then I pray you would you would
[34:10] push that aside oh God and just speak
[34:13] what we all have need of Lord for I have
[34:16] came as well Lord God to hear from you
[34:18] Lord Jesus
[34:19] may you just speak to our hearts o God
[34:21] Minister unto us Lord you promised by
[34:24] the foolishness of preaching you will
[34:27] save them that believe
[34:29] and here we are a bunch of Believers
[34:31] Lord God and we're seeking you o God
[34:34] show us your mercy and your grace this
[34:36] morning we pray in Jesus Christ's
[34:38] precious name the church said together
[34:40] amen God bless you you may be seen
[34:46] and uh
[34:49] this morning we want to preach a message
[34:51] called a day's man has appeared a day's
[34:55] man has appeared and as I read this
[34:59] scripture you might have noticed job did
[35:02] not paint a pretty nice picture when he
[35:05] was speaking here
[35:07] right and the reason why is because Joe
[35:09] blessed facing the fact of his sins
[35:11] facing the fact of his life condition
[35:14] and what he could possibly do as far as
[35:17] himself to get him out of this situation
[35:20] he was facing the reality of it and what
[35:22] was the reality no matter how much he
[35:24] would wash himself he'd still be dirty
[35:27] right if if I'm going to sin anyways why
[35:30] am I laboring when I'm going to fail
[35:32] anyways and see every man woman and
[35:35] child has to come to that point to
[35:38] realize that no matter how hard they try
[35:41] you can't just get yourself into heaven
[35:44] no matter how hard you try there's no
[35:46] sinlessness for you you can't work it up
[35:49] I think I said this last time I was here
[35:50] if you had so much Holiness could you
[35:53] Garner so much Holiness in your life
[35:56] that when you added to God he became
[35:58] more holy
[36:00] of course not amen so see he was facing
[36:04] that reality that no matter how hard I
[36:06] try there's no chance I have whatsoever
[36:11] but if you notice at the end he gets a
[36:13] revelation
[36:14] because even though he might not be able
[36:17] to do it there is a way of Escape for
[36:20] him glory to God in Hallelujah because
[36:22] he said in verse 32 for he is not a man
[36:25] as I am that I should answer him now we
[36:28] should come together in judgment neither
[36:30] is there any days ma'am betwixt us that
[36:33] might lay his hand upon us both so he's
[36:36] showing the answer here I tell you what
[36:38] God knows how to do it sometimes
[36:40] because when you're struggling and
[36:41] you're trying to figure out God's going
[36:43] to bring the answer amen and he was
[36:46] struggling but God inspired him to say
[36:49] something here amen he was inspired he
[36:53] found he was going look I ain't got a
[36:55] chance but if I can only fight a daze
[36:57] man
[36:58] if I go if I somebody could lay their
[37:00] head upon me and God
[37:03] do you know what he's saying here in
[37:05] verse 33 if there was a day's man then
[37:08] then that means there would be a chance
[37:10] for him Hallelujah
[37:12] glory to God now you say brother Stephen
[37:15] you keep saying days man days man what's
[37:17] the days man I agree it's I don't know
[37:19] what it means either until I looked it
[37:21] up
[37:22] and the days man literally means
[37:25] mediator
[37:27] an agitator a lawyer a man
[37:31] that's what it means a mediator right
[37:33] man and what's a mediator a go-between
[37:36] amen it's somebody Hallelujah that can
[37:40] lay a hand upon you and God and bring
[37:42] you together amen
[37:46] glory to God
[37:48] First Timothy 2 5 for there is one God
[37:50] and one mediator between God and man the
[37:54] man Christ Jesus
[37:56] Catholicism I don't know if you know
[37:58] this because Austin likes to change this
[38:00] scripture and say there's a meteor
[38:02] between God and man so see then they
[38:04] then their Pope becomes the mediator
[38:06] between the mediator and you that's not
[38:08] what it said amen
[38:10] there's one mediator between God and man
[38:13] and that's the man Christ Jesus there's
[38:16] no preacher there's no church that you
[38:19] take that place for you
[38:21] [Applause]
[38:23] Hallelujah
[38:25] and notices what job is saying here he
[38:28] is going through some trials job is
[38:31] and he's seen these tries and go I ain't
[38:34] got a chance if I can only find a days
[38:37] man
[38:38] if I can only find a law here that would
[38:41] stand for me then I can make it then
[38:44] amen
[38:45] what about the ram said brother man said
[38:47] the judge became your attorney
[38:49] Hallelujah I'll tell you something if
[38:51] the judge is your attorney how do you
[38:52] lose
[38:57] if the guy representing you
[39:00] is the guy doing the judging
[39:03] how in the world can you lose that
[39:09] oh you sit there and you talk like job
[39:11] though don't you sometimes
[39:13] oh wow woe is me I can't do it
[39:16] amen he had a reason to cry about it
[39:19] amen he was looking for a days man but
[39:22] I'm here to tell you a days man has
[39:24] appeared amen
[39:26] you do have somebody who's stands for
[39:29] you amen
[39:32] and it's Jesus Christ
[39:38] now listen I had to do an audible and
[39:40] had him do a quote for me real quick
[39:42] there's a quote in the token
[39:45] 640308 paragraph 121.
[39:48] I want to read this real quick because I
[39:50] want to show you you are represented and
[39:53] you have to have evidence of this
[39:55] representation which is the token
[39:58] I'm talking about brother Benson I'm
[39:59] talking about the identification of the
[40:01] token Jesus Christ raise and is now
[40:05] identifying himself to re-vindicate his
[40:08] promised word of this day and the church
[40:11] said amen okay so you do have somebody
[40:15] representing you
[40:17] amen you do have a way of Escape it's
[40:21] just not through the way of working it
[40:23] up all the time you know what I mean
[40:24] like getting into your mind I'm going to
[40:26] tell you something friends I think a lot
[40:28] of our mind battles is our fault yeah
[40:30] can I just be real with you amen a lot
[40:33] of our mind battles is just our fault
[40:34] sometimes yeah amen I mean think about
[40:37] it it's look at it like this let's say
[40:40] you were sitting there at home and all
[40:41] of a sudden you get a call that you have
[40:43] a bill five thousand dollars
[40:46] and you go oh no
[40:48] right do you know why you do that oh no
[40:51] because they're eight five thousand
[40:53] dollars in the bank is there
[40:57] and that's why you're going oh no hey
[41:02] man but let's look at the story a little
[41:03] differently let's say in the bank you
[41:05] had a million dollars
[41:07] and then the bill came and said you owe
[41:09] five thousand dollars well what in the
[41:11] world that's okay
[41:12] I got the money in the bank
[41:15] I have plenty to pay the bill off amen
[41:18] oh aren't you glad for that friends hey
[41:21] man do you see where I'm going amen you
[41:24] might have a huge bill to pay but
[41:26] somebody came and paid a price for you
[41:28] amen
[41:29] so if he already paid the price what are
[41:31] you nervous about then hallelujah
[41:35] they already paid the bill
[41:37] when he died on the cross he said it is
[41:40] finished you know what that literally
[41:42] means means paid in full
[41:46] he didn't just abolish sin just by
[41:49] using an eraser amen he paid the debt
[41:51] there was a debt for sin Jesus came and
[41:54] paid the debt
[41:57] so quit walking up like you got to pay
[41:59] more debt you have a mediator Hallelujah
[42:05] who can condemn you of sin
[42:07] it is Christ that justifies
[42:10] huh
[42:12] are you bigger than God all of a sudden
[42:15] think about it like this can your sins
[42:17] be so big that it beats God's will
[42:20] no you're sitting there all tough
[42:23] yeah God don't you know I need to be
[42:25] punished
[42:27] I prayed that before in case you wonder
[42:29] I remember a lot when I was a young
[42:31] Christian I did some pretty stupid stuff
[42:34] and uh I was praying one day I said Lord
[42:36] I need to be punished
[42:38] I said God bring the bring the hammer of
[42:41] judgment on me
[42:42] I should get in trouble for this Lord
[42:45] and he spoke to me he said no
[42:48] and I'm like God I was wrong
[42:51] I need to be punished
[42:53] no he spoke to Martin he always said he
[42:56] said if I did punish you you have more
[42:59] faith in the punishment than me
[43:02] and I went whoa
[43:05] that's pretty heavy amen see a lot of
[43:09] times amen we're sitting here wallowing
[43:12] on our Despair and worrying can I say
[43:15] something here depression okay it's a
[43:17] real thing amen and anxiety and so forth
[43:20] I'm not dying to deny it but you realize
[43:22] being depressed makes no sense as a
[43:24] Christian
[43:26] I mean think about it objectively God's
[43:29] on your side
[43:31] if God's your helper well how can you
[43:33] lose you can't lose amen there's a
[43:36] mediator ain't a dance man has appeared
[43:39] in these last days and you need to step
[43:41] up and believe it amen foreign
[43:45] you ain't guilty Hallelujah
[43:49] you know what Jesus said Remember When
[43:51] Jesus and the disciples were going to
[43:53] pick up uh eat the corn and so forth and
[43:55] the Pharisees came around and said um
[43:57] you're doing that which is unlawful in
[43:59] the Sabbath day
[44:00] he said did you not read when David ate
[44:02] the shoe bread which was unlawful he
[44:04] said but if you would have understand
[44:06] what I meant that I would not have
[44:08] sacrificed but Mercy then you would not
[44:10] have condemned the Guiltless what you
[44:14] are Guiltless this morning
[44:19] amen give me some homework go listen to
[44:21] partying again maybe some of you need to
[44:22] go hear it again
[44:24] you know what brother man said about
[44:25] pardon when you're pardoned amen that
[44:27] means you never did to begin with
[44:30] means you have no guilt
[44:33] that's how saved you are
[44:36] you have a mediator you have a dazed man
[44:38] God saved you from the sins
[44:43] [Music]
[44:45] we gotta stop walking around so defeated
[44:48] I mean just just sometimes I wonder if
[44:51] sometimes our prayers God just wants to
[44:53] pull his hair out sometimes
[44:56] you know what the Bible says the Bible
[44:58] says I do not frustrate the grace of God
[45:01] for if righteousness came by the law
[45:03] then Christ died in vain
[45:05] now you've all been frustrated before I
[45:07] know you have
[45:08] [Laughter]
[45:11] I remember when the kids were younger
[45:12] and and one day I went upstairs and uh
[45:15] there was a bunch of cram marks on the
[45:16] side of the wall
[45:17] kids found a bunch of crayons to start
[45:19] walking up mama goes up there she got
[45:21] frustrated that night
[45:23] you know why because Mama's got to wipe
[45:25] off all that crayons
[45:28] laughs
[45:30] during the kiss you know what I'm
[45:31] talking right then did she
[45:33] can you frustrate the grace of God
[45:38] what would you need to do to frustrate
[45:40] God's grace
[45:41] you know what it is is when you stop
[45:43] believing it
[45:46] right when you stop believing in it
[45:48] Leave the Past Dead
[45:52] leave your sins dead do you know all
[45:54] your sins that they're dead in the blood
[45:56] of Christ
[45:57] they've been divorced and you're
[45:59] separated from you know gray digging's a
[46:02] crime right
[46:04] if you go out to this graveyard today
[46:06] and you go start digging you're going to
[46:07] get arrested
[46:10] I think God sent this Angel today to
[46:12] rest some people in here
[46:15] quit grave digging so much quit bringing
[46:17] up the past
[46:20] quit grave digging and start believing
[46:22] what God Said Amen you do have a gays
[46:25] man
[46:27] which we're gonna get to now but boy oh
[46:29] my goodness praise the Lord you love the
[46:31] Lord
[46:33] I want to talk about another character
[46:35] in the Bible
[46:36] that went through this similar with job
[46:38] you may not it's it was amazing how God
[46:41] connected this to me but there was a
[46:43] there was a little old lady
[46:45] who used to walk in the city of Jericho
[46:48] and her name was Rahab
[46:50] and I love this story so much I hope you
[46:52] don't mind a little dramatization this
[46:53] morning amen because I think about these
[46:56] characters a lot of times when I read
[46:58] the Bible a lot of times when I look at
[47:00] these characters I try to put myself in
[47:02] their shoes for a second
[47:04] and you think about Rahab for a second
[47:07] and you know why she would even want to
[47:10] ask the things that we're going to read
[47:11] about in a second why would she even
[47:12] come up to these conclusions
[47:14] because she would be walking through the
[47:16] same town everybody else in that City
[47:18] walk through they I saw some estimates
[47:20] there was anywhere between a thousand
[47:21] and five thousand people in this town at
[47:23] the time
[47:24] and that may sound small in our day but
[47:26] in their day having a big town they call
[47:28] Jericho the longest standing city in the
[47:31] world
[47:32] it's the oldest city in the world they
[47:33] say and and she would have she would
[47:36] have been walking in Jericho she saw the
[47:38] same walls everybody else saw
[47:41] she worked there right and she probably
[47:44] had some bad times in her life
[47:46] who knows what happened to her
[47:48] you know brother bam says she probably
[47:50] had some family problems he and brother
[47:51] baby would say poor little Rahab
[47:54] probably had some family trolls some bad
[47:55] luck on her life and that's why she
[47:57] ended up being a harlot it was the only
[47:58] way she could pay the bills
[48:00] amen matter of fact they say that the
[48:02] house she in was probably also a Tavern
[48:05] of some fourth amen some place where
[48:07] people could spend the night or
[48:08] something
[48:09] so she was running an establishment and
[48:12] maybe one morning she was walking to the
[48:13] you know during that day when you want
[48:15] to go get groceries you had to go down
[48:16] to the market and you had to go every
[48:18] day because there was no such thing as
[48:19] preservatives
[48:21] maybe they ought to go back to that
[48:22] let's just say be real hey man we're not
[48:24] gonna do no listen I'm going to eat some
[48:26] I'm gonna eat some bad food this
[48:27] afternoon so I better not say anything
[48:28] amen but my point is this is that every
[48:31] day you would have to go to the market
[48:33] every day to get food
[48:35] and think about a Rahab walking through
[48:37] here and she would start hearing the
[48:40] rumors about this ragtag group of people
[48:43] coming from the south yeah
[48:45] and hearing all these things that they
[48:47] did
[48:48] right and maybe she was talking with
[48:49] someone you know how you know how women
[48:51] folks knew at the store sometimes
[48:53] maybe she was talking to some of the
[48:54] other sisters or ladies
[48:57] and they're talking about what they hear
[48:58] and they're hearing about this nation
[49:00] down there who split the Red Sea
[49:03] maybe some of us say ah you know that's
[49:06] all just fables or myths still but
[49:09] something and Rahab told her there was
[49:11] something more to it
[49:13] you see what I'm saying there was just
[49:15] something there amen something that you
[49:18] can't explain something that you can't
[49:20] quite put under a microscope and find it
[49:22] and see oh that's why she's thinking
[49:24] like that
[49:25] can you see yourself a little bit amen
[49:27] [Laughter]
[49:29] something's true about what I just heard
[49:33] did you hear how they took out Xi'an and
[49:35] OG and so forth and these kingdoms this
[49:38] this bunch of slaves from Egypt
[49:41] oh they knew how to do was build prick
[49:45] and yet they're taking out Nations and
[49:48] they're here and they're coming to
[49:49] Jericho
[49:52] and maybe she's hearing these stories
[49:54] these stories are affecting her
[49:56] differently than everybody else
[49:58] Hallelujah
[50:00] hey man like when you hear about
[50:01] squirrels come into existence and then
[50:04] some people say that might have been
[50:05] imagination but something told you
[50:08] there's something to this here
[50:13] when you hear a man called to South
[50:15] Africa amen oh he was just another
[50:16] Pentecostal preacher but something was
[50:19] different about him to you
[50:23] there are something different about this
[50:24] message oh yeah
[50:26] it wasn't just another Pentecostal
[50:28] preacher another healing another Oral
[50:31] Roberts or Billy Graham there's
[50:32] something different about this
[50:34] what was the difference it was the word
[50:36] that's the difference
[50:37] the same thing in Rahab here that's the
[50:40] difference there was something in her
[50:42] what was that something it was her
[50:44] representation she was from somewhere
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:51] glory to God
[50:53] it ain't Rocket Science Church you know
[50:56] there's something different amen it
[50:58] ain't just a bunch of fireworks there's
[51:00] something in your heart that recognizes
[51:03] it
[51:05] what's the Bible says our spirit with
[51:08] his Spirit witnesses that we're the sons
[51:11] of God
[51:12] [Applause]
[51:15] don't deny that that's something real
[51:21] yeah just like Rahab here
[51:22] just a small little country girl City
[51:25] girl rather
[51:26] trying to work you know bad times and so
[51:28] forth
[51:29] but she's hearing these testimonies
[51:32] and she's going is there a chance for me
[51:36] you know what brother Bram said I got
[51:38] the quote but we're just going to preach
[51:39] I hope you don't mind
[51:42] thought she said oh if I could just have
[51:45] mercy
[51:46] oh if I just had a chance
[51:48] she didn't want to be in the condition
[51:50] she was in life was hard to her I'm
[51:53] gonna preach now okay you think about
[51:54] those people out there amen you go I
[51:57] can't believe you can call in that sin
[51:58] of course they're calling this in that's
[52:00] all the world gives them
[52:03] right some poor little lady out there
[52:05] who ended up having two kids or
[52:07] something like that through prostitution
[52:08] and stuff like that be careful what you
[52:10] say about her
[52:12] she might be a rehab
[52:14] oh great
[52:17] cool preach it brother Stephen I think I
[52:19] will
[52:22] listen Okay well we're just home folk
[52:24] now aren't we hey man I just I feel
[52:26] important don't get too messy that's
[52:28] right and you know exactly what I mean
[52:32] we sometimes create Cloisters and then
[52:34] we forget what we're called to do
[52:38] yes we're here to bring Salvation how
[52:41] are they going to hear about the message
[52:42] if you don't say nothing
[52:44] [Applause]
[52:46] you gotta pipe up you gotta say it
[52:49] sometime you might be there
[52:51] to be a Rahab and come out of it amen
[52:56] listen because one time Rahab was
[52:59] walking thinking about these things
[53:00] going I wish I could get out of this
[53:04] and all of a sudden maybe she goes into
[53:06] her back into her Tavern if you will and
[53:08] there was two gentlemen standing at the
[53:10] counter
[53:12] hey man so she rushes try to take care
[53:15] of him and so forth
[53:16] and one thing led to another and I don't
[53:19] know maybe they were trying to hide
[53:21] their clothes and maybe their clothes
[53:23] were a little different being from Egypt
[53:26] I mean I have no idea maybe they had a
[53:28] little star of David well David wasn't
[53:30] alive yet was he but

[54:11] message with them Hallelujah

[54:54] Bible before what's different now

[55:01] amen listen the world might have changed
[55:04] God did it
[55:06] he said when he was gonna bring the word
[55:08] when the Lord God has spoken who came
[55:11] but prophesied
[55:12] [Applause]
[55:13] he will do nothing until he first
[55:16] reveals it to his servants the prophets
[55:18] he's never changed it oh yeah the world
[55:21] changed it just want to call you a bunch
[55:22] of man followers Mormons over and he
[55:24] says whatever amen just trying to make
[55:27] any name just to try to get you off a
[55:28] little bit let him call you a man of
[55:30] worshiper who cares you know where you
[55:31] stand

[55:37] worship brother Brown
[55:37] [Applause]
[55:43] can I just because somebody calls you
[55:46] something don't mean you are
[55:49] [Applause]
[55:50] well that was free just so you know amen
[55:56] rehab
[55:58] her started listening to these tapes
[56:00] that night
[56:02] and something was transforming inside of
[56:04] her
[56:05] something was working inside of you can
[56:07] you can you say Amen do you know how we
[56:09] know something was working on rehab
[56:10] because the same message did something
[56:12] to you
[56:14] you can't explain it can you you can't
[56:16] sit here and go well that's because of
[56:18] this you know brother Ram said that he
[56:19] even knew who your grandfather
[56:20] grandfather grandfather was and he lined
[56:23] all those people up to mayor who they're
[56:24] married have kids just for you to show
[56:25] up right
[56:27] good God was thinking about you before
[56:31] you were even born
[56:34] so if God was thinking about you then
[56:36] what makes you think he stopped all of a
[56:38] sudden
[56:39] come on Amen God's our Ally
[56:44] he's working with us
[56:47] and though Rahab was through some hard
[56:49] times
[56:50] she had a rough life no wonder she could
[56:52] speak like job did there in job 9.
[56:56] where her life was rough too
[56:58] hey man but she was looking for her days
[57:00] man
[57:02] she was looking for something that could
[57:05] represent her get her out of the
[57:06] situation she was in
[57:09] that and all of a sudden we know the
[57:11] story
[57:12] guard started showing up at the house
[57:15] Rahab was so determined to do kindness
[57:18] to these two guys to honor God's message
[57:21] and his Messengers are you hearing me
[57:24] God was she was so willing to honor it
[57:27] she hit him up in the uh in the roof
[57:30] until the guards hey they went out of
[57:32] town
[57:35] ain't that something I want you to think
[57:37] about this for a second Rahab lied to
[57:39] those guards
[57:40] you ever thought about that for a second
[57:43] Ray obliged
[57:45] they they asked him where did those guys
[57:47] go and she said that away when they were
[57:51] up on the roof
[57:54] do you see what I'm saying I want you to
[57:57] get this point very clear okay God is
[58:00] stronger than sin
[58:02] the church might have condemned Rahab
[58:04] for doing something like that but God
[58:06] did it
[58:08] as a matter of fact the Bible says in
[58:11] Hebrews 11 31 by faith the Harlot Rahab
[58:15] perished not with them that believe not
[58:17] when she had received the spies with
[58:19] peace
[58:20] really the God God has even mentioned it
[58:25] God even mentioned matter of fact it's
[58:27] amazing where you find Rahab in the
[58:28] Bible amen these guys uh in James 2 24.
[58:33] you see now you see that now how by
[58:35] works and man is Justified and not by
[58:37] faith only likewise also was not Rahab
[58:40] the Harlot justified by works when she
[58:42] had received the messengers and that set
[58:44] them out another way
[58:47] she did this by faith
[58:50] she was believing in something amen that
[58:54] God didn't reckon it to her or we don't
[58:56] know I mean I can't say her and just
[58:58] explain to you every little thing why
[59:00] you know even though Rahab lied here why
[59:02] did God look over it but God is greater
[59:04] amen than sin
[59:06] [Applause]
[59:08] God's the boss can he say Amen
[59:13] and God's looking at Rahab here
[59:17] and saying she's she's showing kindness
[59:20] to the message
[59:22] and she did something she was justified
[59:24] by her words she did something here to
[59:27] help them
[59:29] hiding him on a roof sending those guys
[59:31] that way right
[59:33] yeah but she wasn't done yet
[59:36] she wasn't done yet see that kindness
[59:38] wasn't just good enough can I say
[59:41] something kindness ain't just gonna make
[59:42] it for you
[59:44] just because you do a good work don't
[59:46] mean you're gonna make it
[59:48] and listen Rahab knew that too
[59:51] because in Joshua 2 9 watch us here
[59:53] Joshua 2 9 watches here and she said
[59:56] unto the man I know that the Lord hath
[59:58] given you the land and that your Terror
[1:00:00] has fallen upon us and all the
[1:00:02] inhabitants the land faint because of
[1:00:04] you for we have heard how the Lord dried
[1:00:06] up the water of the Red Sea for you when
[1:00:08] you came out of Egypt when you did unto
[1:00:10] the two kings of the Emirates that were
[1:00:12] on the other side of a Jordan Xi'an whom
[1:00:14] you utterly destroyed and as soon as we
[1:00:17] heard these things
[1:00:19] our hearts didn't melt neither there
[1:00:22] remain any more courage and man because
[1:00:24] of you for the Lord your God he is God
[1:00:26] in heaven above and the Earth beneath
[1:00:29] now do you notice she's saying these
[1:00:31] testimonies and she don't start this is
[1:00:33] a quote now brother man says she don't
[1:00:34] start going oh can I just see Joshua
[1:00:37] then
[1:00:38] I need to see some more miracles first
[1:00:41] I need to see some more things happen no
[1:00:44] when she heard the testimony of these
[1:00:46] two spies in a message it was good
[1:00:49] enough for her
[1:00:50] [Applause]
[1:00:52] hey man it was good enough for her she
[1:00:55] said I've seen it and I believe it
[1:00:58] I see what the message says I see what
[1:01:00] the messenger said and I'm accepting it
[1:01:03] she's the only one in town to do it
[1:01:06] she was the minority if you will
[1:01:10] you might be the only one in your family
[1:01:12] who's doing it
[1:01:15] amen
[1:01:17] now watch Rahab has this revelation
[1:01:20] but the Revelation needs to produce
[1:01:23] something
[1:01:25] you can know all the Mysteries
[1:01:28] and if you don't have love you and go
[1:01:29] make it right that's what Paul said
[1:01:32] amen you can have a bunch of Revelation
[1:01:33] you can know all about the message
[1:01:35] brother bam said you can know all about
[1:01:37] the token
[1:01:38] until it's applied is when it starts
[1:01:40] having an effect in your life and Rahab
[1:01:43] knew this
[1:01:44] somehow she knew this that's why it's so
[1:01:47] amazing about this story she was a
[1:01:49] gentile in this time and God positioned
[1:01:52] her there one predestinated seat in all
[1:01:55] the city of Jericho
[1:02:00] and watch what she says here when she's
[1:02:02] talking about in verse 12.
[1:02:05] now therefore I pray you're swearing to
[1:02:07] me by the Lord since I have showed you
[1:02:09] kindness that you will also show
[1:02:11] kindness unto my father's health and
[1:02:13] give me a true token
[1:02:17] think about this for a second
[1:02:19] why does she want a token so bad
[1:02:23] why does she want a token so bad you
[1:02:25] know why she wants a token so bad
[1:02:26] because the words inside of her
[1:02:29] we've been seeing it non-stop that Rahab
[1:02:31] had the word inside of her the whole
[1:02:33] time
[1:02:33] and the word knows what it needs Glory
[1:02:37] the word recognizes it in its heart and
[1:02:40] say listen this kindness ain't good
[1:02:42] enough Glory just this Revelation ain't
[1:02:45] good enough I need something to
[1:02:46] represent me I need a token what do I
[1:02:49] need I need a dazed man to appear
[1:02:53] and look these two spies had nothing
[1:02:57] from Joshua
[1:02:59] Joshua never told him about a token or
[1:03:02] anything but rahab's Faith was so real
[1:03:05] it was the word her faith reached out
[1:03:09] through the message and pulled to her a
[1:03:13] token
[1:03:15] she needed it so bad
[1:03:18] that she said I need a true token
[1:03:22] and she pulled it right out of the
[1:03:24] message oh glory to God and what did God
[1:03:26] send you on these last days amen he sent
[1:03:29] you a message and he told you that
[1:03:32] Tolkien is Jesus Christ the baptism of
[1:03:34] the Holy Ghost
[1:03:35] [Applause]
[1:03:37] and if you're lacking a token today
[1:03:39] don't worry a day's man has appeared you
[1:03:42] can reach out in faith and take it unto
[1:03:44] yourself
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:51] listen
[1:03:52] you ain't gonna make it without the Holy
[1:03:55] Ghost
[1:04:00] well brother Raymond said anybody who's
[1:04:02] not under that token perished in Jericho
[1:04:04] right
[1:04:05] right which we're going to find out here
[1:04:06] in a second
[1:04:08] listen Rahab
[1:04:10] God's provided it to you
[1:04:13] you just got to pull it to yourself
[1:04:17] Rahab didn't have a promise whatsoever
[1:04:21] that's right no
[1:04:22] those two Messengers didn't have a word
[1:04:24] from Joshua but her faith was so real
[1:04:28] her faith was so real it created a token
[1:04:31] to her
[1:04:33] now watch what this token is we know
[1:04:34] what it is right
[1:04:36] he he she ended up sending those two
[1:04:38] spies out the window remember she lived
[1:04:40] in the walls too right remember that's
[1:04:42] gonna be important leader
[1:04:44] she lived in those walls
[1:04:46] and she could put out a Scarlet thread
[1:04:48] who carries Scarlet thread with him
[1:04:51] must have been a rope or something you
[1:04:53] know what I mean something to hold their
[1:04:54] weights to bring them down
[1:04:56] who has red rope
[1:04:58] but she did that day
[1:05:00] god listen the the token was already
[1:05:03] there before she knew it was a token
[1:05:05] right
[1:05:07] before it became a token it already
[1:05:09] existed God already had the bases for
[1:05:12] the Holy Ghost here the whole time
[1:05:14] but then God sent a message to reveal it
[1:05:16] to you that that same spiritual wage
[1:05:19] raised up Christ from the dead dwells in
[1:05:22] you it will also Quicken your mortal
[1:05:24] body
[1:05:28] and those preachers those take boys if
[1:05:30] you will start going down that Scarlet
[1:05:32] thread
[1:05:33] and they said this same Scarlet thread
[1:05:36] that you're saving us with
[1:05:39] the same thread that saved them was
[1:05:41] going to save Rahab can I say this oh
[1:05:44] we're gonna we're gonna go real deep you
[1:05:45] want to come with me amen any real
[1:05:47] preacher preaches it just like that too
[1:05:49] amen there's not a different salvation
[1:05:52] for preachers than for the people
[1:05:55] see what I'm saying the same salvation
[1:05:57] the same thread that saved those two
[1:05:59] spies was the same thread that saved her
[1:06:01] whole household it was the same token
[1:06:05] it's the same baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:06:08] there's no big eyes and little use in
[1:06:11] the house of God Amen We're All in This
[1:06:13] Together amen it's the same word amen
[1:06:16] that saves us all
[1:06:20] isn't this just amazing Rahab I mean
[1:06:22] she's a gentile she's not even a Jew
[1:06:24] herself
[1:06:26] she's acting just like any other Gentile
[1:06:28] though
[1:06:29] hello
[1:06:33] hello the world I have been nice to you
[1:06:35] has it
[1:06:37] the world's trying to destroy you too
[1:06:40] trying to hurt you and destroy you kill
[1:06:42] you the Bible says Satan goes as a
[1:06:44] roaring lion seeking him he may devour
[1:06:47] the Royal hasn't been nice to you
[1:06:49] and you needed a token
[1:06:52] you needed a mediator you needed a day's
[1:06:55] man to show up right right amen and if
[1:06:58] Rahab could do it with no promise
[1:07:01] how much more you with a promise
[1:07:05] amen
[1:07:07] so think about it Rahab gets this
[1:07:09] promise this is all she has is the word
[1:07:11] of those two preachers
[1:07:13] can I say listen God honored her faith
[1:07:17] in what those two preachers said
[1:07:20] you hear me church sometimes we like to
[1:07:22] you know oh you're just you're just a
[1:07:24] man I know I'm just a man but if God
[1:07:26] speaks you know God will honor you if
[1:07:28] you believe it
[1:07:30] do you okay we're gonna do a little side
[1:07:32] test if you don't mind about that dude
[1:07:33] yeah I called the Rabbit Trail remember
[1:07:35] that okay we're gonna do a little Rabbit
[1:07:37] Trail do you know how powerful that is
[1:07:39] God honors what his preacher says
[1:07:42] Moses one time amen was told by God to
[1:07:46] go speak to the Rock and water would
[1:07:47] come out
[1:07:49] and remember remember he smoked the Rock
[1:07:51] first but he was supposed to speak to
[1:07:53] the Rock next
[1:07:54] but he got so upset one morning that
[1:07:57] Moses the prophet said shall I get water
[1:07:58] out for you for a bunch of Sluggers took
[1:08:01] a stick and smoked the rock twice
[1:08:04] brother Graham said he broke the entire
[1:08:06] plan of God
[1:08:08] why because Christ was only supposed to
[1:08:09] die once then you speak to the Rock
[1:08:11] when he smoked the rock twice he was
[1:08:13] typing a second crucifixion and that's
[1:08:15] not what God was going to do
[1:08:17] so he broke the entire plan of God As a
[1:08:20] matter of fact this is the incident
[1:08:22] which keeps him out of the Promised Land
[1:08:26] he gets so much in trouble
[1:08:29] that he's not even allowed on the
[1:08:30] promised land now
[1:08:31] because of what he did here
[1:08:34] so he so look Moses didn't do what God
[1:08:38] told him to do
[1:08:39] but what came out of The Rock when you
[1:08:40] smoke it
[1:08:42] water still came out
[1:08:44] right and it still took care of those
[1:08:45] two million people who are believing the
[1:08:47] message of the hour
[1:08:49] God still honored those people's faith
[1:08:52] in the prophet Moses
[1:08:54] God still honored it even though he
[1:08:57] messed up
[1:08:58] even though he messed up God honored
[1:09:01] their faith in the message
[1:09:04] oh they say brother brother Brandon made
[1:09:06] a bunch of mistakes maybe he did maybe
[1:09:08] he didn't I'm not here to be the referee
[1:09:10] of it
[1:09:12] oh that was Freak Free amen people like
[1:09:15] to outprofit the prophet sometime as if
[1:09:17] they can referee what God decided
[1:09:19] true amen oh you said oh brother Brandon

[1:12:24] or not
[1:12:25] you know what it means when you're
[1:12:26] leaning that means if it would fall
[1:12:29] you'd fall with it
[1:12:30] that's when you know you're leaning
[1:12:34] lean not to thy own understanding
[1:12:39] get back into this word get back into
[1:12:41] this message you're not crazy for
[1:12:44] believing God's in a prophet
[1:12:47] it's the word of God Made Real for your
[1:12:49] day
[1:12:51] [Applause]
[1:12:56] you know why I'm a message believer
[1:12:59] I got a whole sermon on this just so you
[1:13:01] know but you're going to get the cliff
[1:13:02] notes
[1:13:05] do you know I'm a message believer
[1:13:08] it's not because of those pictures
[1:13:12] it's not because of those pictures
[1:13:14] you know why I'm a message believer
[1:13:16] because the word may flesh for my day
[1:13:19] it was the scripture Made Alive yeah
[1:13:21] let's take those two pictures for a
[1:13:23] second we got a picture of a pillar of
[1:13:25] fire we got a picture of a seven angel
[1:13:27] cloud
[1:13:31] I believe because
[1:13:33] you're scriptural
[1:13:34] how do you know brother Stephen when the
[1:13:36] children of Israel were being led
[1:13:37] through the Wilderness at night they
[1:13:39] were led by a pillar of fire and that
[1:13:41] day a pillar of cloud
[1:13:44] in 1950 brother bam taught us the
[1:13:46] laodicea church age was going completely
[1:13:48] black all the light was being stepped
[1:13:51] out through denominationalism but in
[1:13:53] 1950 at a debate about healing God made
[1:13:56] sure his Prophet was up there and in the
[1:13:59] darkness he made a light amen
[1:14:03] doing what leaving his church at Night
[1:14:06] by a pillar of Fire
[1:14:09] I took a picture of a pillar fire right
[1:14:12] 13 years later God goes to that same
[1:14:16] prophet and puts him on Sunset Mountain
[1:14:17] amen and he saw the little birds the big
[1:14:20] birds and then he saw angels fly
[1:14:23] and just at that time they took a
[1:14:25] picture and brother right I'm still in
[1:14:27] the seals were open it was the rising of
[1:14:30] the Sun so when the sun was being Rose
[1:14:32] the day was breaking forth and what
[1:14:35] happened God put a pillar of cloud in
[1:14:37] the sky
[1:14:41] I'm not a message believer just because
[1:14:43] God took two Supernatural photos
[1:14:46] that's right I am a message believer
[1:14:47] because those Supernatural photos had to
[1:14:50] have been the same God in the Bible
[1:14:53] he doesn't change
[1:14:55] at night he let him buy a pillow fire
[1:14:57] and that day he let him buy a pillar of
[1:14:59] cloud and those were the two exact
[1:15:00] photos he took for the Bride of Jesus
[1:15:02] Christ in these last days to lead her
[1:15:05] down the right path
[1:15:06] and what was the path the message of the
[1:15:09] hour what that may have preached amen
[1:15:12] was going to lead us into a Rapture and
[1:15:14] when he went beyond the court of time we
[1:15:17] all said we're resting on that
[1:15:19] [Applause]
[1:15:23] and that's why I'm a message believer
[1:15:28] that's why
[1:15:30] just like Rahab here
[1:15:33] Rahab didn't have to see all the
[1:15:35] Miracles
[1:15:36] something in her witnessed what she was
[1:15:39] hearing was the truth
[1:15:42] something in her that she couldn't
[1:15:43] explain
[1:15:44] listen she was she she worked around a
[1:15:47] bunch of people
[1:15:48] no doubt those people looked at Jericho
[1:15:50] go say we don't got to worry about those
[1:15:52] bunch of slaves down there
[1:15:54] how do they gonna tear down this wall
[1:15:57] it's too big there ain't no way they can
[1:15:59] do it oh I'll tell you what God likes a
[1:16:00] challenge sometimes
[1:16:01] [Applause]
[1:16:03] God likes a challenge sometimes amen
[1:16:06] because we know what happens in a few
[1:16:08] chapters later
[1:16:09] Joshua calls or I'm sorry God called for
[1:16:13] the captain of his salvation decided
[1:16:16] that it is time to go to war with
[1:16:18] Jericho
[1:16:21] part of the reason why he has to go to
[1:16:22] war right is because of the
[1:16:24] predestinated seat in there
[1:16:27] and that predestinated seed was trapped
[1:16:30] in that wall
[1:16:31] oh you ever been there before I've been
[1:16:33] trapped in walls before too
[1:16:35] I've been trapped in my delusions and my
[1:16:38] and my you know you know you know those
[1:16:40] mind battles you get where you cross ten
[1:16:41] Bridges and you haven't been down there
[1:16:43] yet but you you went this and this and
[1:16:46] this and now you're depressed because of
[1:16:47] this over here you're not even there
[1:16:50] right it hasn't even happened and you're
[1:16:52] depressed about something that is that
[1:16:54] might happen over there
[1:16:57] you know oh you sit there and you'll
[1:17:00] just go uh Lord you know I'm gonna mess
[1:17:01] up tomorrow
[1:17:03] you know if I do I'm gonna mess up
[1:17:04] tomorrow you're already you're already
[1:17:06] getting depressed about your sins you
[1:17:07] haven't done yet
[1:17:11] but that's what the devil likes to do it
[1:17:12] so Tom Right make up walls
[1:17:15] tries to bring up walls
[1:17:18] and so God said you know what I'm tired
[1:17:20] of these walls hoping holding my
[1:17:21] predestinated seed I tell you what I
[1:17:24] thank God he does this amen he doesn't
[1:17:26] even base it necessarily on you
[1:17:28] sometimes does he because if you had
[1:17:29] your way sometimes you'd be like me
[1:17:31] trying to get yourself in trouble
[1:17:33] Hey man trying to bring the judgments of
[1:17:35] God upon yourself God don't play those
[1:17:36] games amen he's got a bigger picture in
[1:17:39] mind amen he wants a relationship with
[1:17:41] you and he wants you closer to him just
[1:17:44] stop trusting so much in yourself and
[1:17:46] start trusting in what God Said
[1:17:49] Hallelujah
[1:17:51] think how crazy Ray have with that rope
[1:17:53] out of her window
[1:17:55] people making fun of her fort she's like
[1:17:57] who cares
[1:17:58] oh can I preach now who cares what those
[1:18:00] people say about your token
[1:18:03] but as if you know sometimes we believe
[1:18:05] more in people what they say about our
[1:18:06] token that people actually got it
[1:18:11] so what if they make fun of you like
[1:18:13] they know what they're talking about
[1:18:15] oh can I I give you I'll give you a
[1:18:17] story one time I worked at the elevator
[1:18:20] I worked at an elevator one time and uh
[1:18:23] they knew I was a Christian and because
[1:18:24] I let him know and so forth
[1:18:27] became up Stephen we heard we heard
[1:18:29] something a story in the Bible
[1:18:31] oh did you I was first shocked they even
[1:18:33] read the thing you know
[1:18:34] I was I worked at elevator so these were
[1:18:37] Farmer Boys you know country boys or
[1:18:38] whatever
[1:18:40] they said we heard there's polygamy in
[1:18:42] the Bible
[1:18:43] see when we heard there's polygamy in
[1:18:45] the Bible
[1:18:46] Stephen you believe in polygamy
[1:18:48] I mean there's polygamy in the Bible
[1:18:50] Stephen so I stopped her I said
[1:18:53] really
[1:18:55] there's polygamy in the Bible
[1:18:58] I said where
[1:18:59] they go well we don't know I said then
[1:19:01] shut up you know like get out of here

[1:19:08] you see what I'm saying they need they
[1:19:10] didn't read it they even know they just
[1:19:12] had somebody tell them about it and try
[1:19:13] to throw me under the bus I'm gonna let
[1:19:15] them throw me on the bus I know where I
[1:19:17] stand
[1:19:18] I know what I have believed
[1:19:22] that's what you need to do is
[1:19:26] you so you stuck in those walls this
[1:19:28] morning don't worry God's gonna send a
[1:19:30] Joshua to get you out
[1:19:34] God commissioned Joshua to get you out
[1:19:36] of some walls
[1:19:37] and what did he do amen he brought a
[1:19:41] bunch of Men of War but he didn't take a
[1:19:43] single hammer to that wall did he know
[1:19:45] what he did they started blowing some
[1:19:47] trumpets amen
[1:19:49] I'll tell you what sometimes we do it
[1:19:50] the wrong way sometimes you know what I
[1:19:52] mean sometimes when we got walls we try
[1:19:54] to take a hammer in our children try to
[1:19:55] bring down the wall
[1:19:56] hey man if we would just believe on God
[1:19:59] and saw praising what he said you might
[1:20:00] get a little farther right man
[1:20:02] I think I said this last time it's not
[1:20:04] called thinking word it's called spoken
[1:20:06] word
[1:20:07] so quit thinking about what God Said and
[1:20:09] put it on your lips and say it and start
[1:20:11] trumpeting it forth amen are you healed
[1:20:13] yes sir I'm Healed by your stripes I'm
[1:20:15] Healed
[1:20:16] I don't feel any better so what his word
[1:20:19] said I'm Healed
[1:20:20] I don't care about these walls amen he
[1:20:23] said I'm Healed
[1:20:24] Glory the car Hallelujah
[1:20:27] I don't care how high these walls are
[1:20:29] amen if he said I'm Healed it doesn't
[1:20:31] matter if it's cancer uh leukemia and so
[1:20:34] forth God said I'm Healed
[1:20:38] and start trumpeting it forth
[1:20:41] now watch this here

[1:20:57] going around the city and so forth as
[1:20:58] God commissioned them to do Watch what
[1:21:00] it says here I think it's so amazing
[1:21:02] Joshua 6 verse 11. so the Ark of the
[1:21:04] Lord come past the city going about it
[1:21:06] once and they came into the camp
[1:21:08] enlarged to the camp
[1:21:11] Now isn't that something they're here to
[1:21:13] take out those walls
[1:21:15] and God tells them go around once then
[1:21:19] don't go around again
[1:21:20] so they take the ark they take the
[1:21:22] trumpets they take the men of War go
[1:21:24] around once
[1:21:25] and then they go in the camp
[1:21:28] I mean there's 23 more hours left in the
[1:21:30] day

[1:23:08] Christian experience is rest

[1:23:13] Brandon brother Bram said he woke up his
[1:23:14] wife to tell her that
[1:23:16] he was so surprised by that Revelation
[1:23:19] he couldn't even hold it in he had to
[1:23:20] wake up his wife in the middle of the
[1:23:22] night and tell her about it

[1:23:43] token amen and no she's okay
[1:23:47] thank you
[1:23:49] Lord see that maybe that's what we need
[1:23:50] to do this morning right go look at your
[1:23:53] token for a second you got the holy
[1:23:55] ghost or not you say brother Stephen I
[1:23:57] don't know I would figure that out right
[1:23:58] now
[1:24:00] I wouldn't even wait till I'm done
[1:24:01] talking this morning
[1:24:03] to figure out whether you got the holy
[1:24:04] ghost or not you say brother Stephen
[1:24:06] it's got to be a little hard is it
[1:24:08] really that hard do you do the word
[1:24:11] amen can I say this I think I said this
[1:24:14] last time my goodness here we are amen
[1:24:15] God can talk
[1:24:17] so I can talk to you
[1:24:19] if you got a question of whether you got
[1:24:21] the holy ghost or not figure it out oh I
[1:24:24] don't know here we are church I hope you
[1:24:25] want to come with me any man you say
[1:24:27] brother Stephen I have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:28] for 35 years I'm so happy to hear that
[1:24:30] have you had it for 35 in one day
[1:24:34] what does the Bible say make your
[1:24:35] calling an election sure brother Ram
[1:24:37] said all who are not under the token
[1:24:40] perished
[1:24:43] brother brand was so shook up by that he
[1:24:44] said in when he first preached the token
[1:24:46] he said I got loved ones in here
[1:24:49] I got family in here and he said if
[1:24:51] they're not under the token they don't
[1:24:53] make it
[1:24:55] you hear me Church
[1:24:57] Rahab had enough sense in her to know
[1:25:00] she needed a true token
[1:25:02] she needed a true token and she laid it
[1:25:05] out that window loud and proud
[1:25:11] remember when those children of Israel
[1:25:13] walked by what did Joshua always see
[1:25:15] when they walked around the first what
[1:25:17] do you see oh saw the token up in the
[1:25:19] window
[1:25:20] he knew Rahab was over there there's the
[1:25:23] token
[1:25:25] they would go around the city one time
[1:25:27] for six days
[1:25:29] what an invasion
[1:25:32] what a what a time to take out Jericho
[1:25:35] hey man oh I tell you what sometimes we
[1:25:38] we come up with our minds on how to take
[1:25:40] out our problems amen just lean on him
[1:25:42] he's going to make you do things that
[1:25:44] sound foolish sometimes
[1:25:46] don't worry about that so much worry
[1:25:48] about whether it's God's word or not
[1:25:50] hey man
[1:25:52] and then on the seventh day what do they
[1:25:54] do they go around seven times don't they
[1:25:56] right we got a lot of types in that like
[1:25:58] for instance I think it's each time was
[1:26:00] one seal being opened right
[1:26:02] but then on the seventh seal on the
[1:26:04] seventh day what happened all seals were
[1:26:06] revealed amen and God went back and
[1:26:09] revealed them all in the last Church age
[1:26:11] if you will amen One Church AIDS two
[1:26:14] Church AIDS we're on the seven Church
[1:26:15] age what did that seven Church age
[1:26:16] mentioned to do it revealed the seven
[1:26:18] Church ages
[1:26:21] and when they went around seven times
[1:26:24] Joshua tells them here in um
[1:26:29] there it is Joshua 6 verse 16. and it
[1:26:32] came to pass at the seventh time when
[1:26:34] the priest blew with the trumpets Joshua
[1:26:36] said on the people shout for the Lord
[1:26:39] has given you the land you serious I
[1:26:41] ain't making anything up am I sometimes
[1:26:42] you gotta pipe up
[1:26:45] sometimes you got to shout say the word
[1:26:47] yourself amen
[1:26:50] watch what Joshua says here remember
[1:26:51] Joshua's Jehovah's salvation in verse 17
[1:26:54] and the city shall be accursed even it
[1:26:57] and all that are there into the Lord
[1:26:58] only Rahab
[1:27:01] the heart that shall live and all that
[1:27:04] are with her in her house because she
[1:27:07] hid the message Hallelujah she hid the
[1:27:11] message that we set
[1:27:16] isn't that something yeah and they just
[1:27:19] random while we call this the message
[1:27:20] amen we got some rahabs in here right
[1:27:23] man who have hid the message yes the
[1:27:27] walls are coming down this world will be
[1:27:29] destroyed only the bride shall live
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:35] that'll get you
[1:27:36] isn't this amazing Joshua never met
[1:27:39] Rahab
[1:27:40] up to this point
[1:27:42] but Joshua knew her name before she knew
[1:27:45] met him
[1:27:47] oh ain't that something God knew you
[1:27:48] before you met him
[1:27:51] amen and the walls came down didn't they
[1:27:57] you know they even done the historical
[1:27:59] things you know what happened to those
[1:28:00] walls I saw I read some stuff on the
[1:28:02] internet of the archeology the walls
[1:28:05] didn't just crumble in they crumbled out
[1:28:07] do you know why because when the walls
[1:28:09] crumbled out it made a little ramp for
[1:28:11] them to walk in
[1:28:14] God literally invited them into the city
[1:28:16] to take over
[1:28:19] see I think sometimes can I preach we
[1:28:21] working too much
[1:28:24] they didn't even have to make a ramp to
[1:28:25] get in the city God made a form already
[1:28:26] too
[1:28:27] [Applause]
[1:28:28] they didn't have to worry about taking
[1:28:30] hammers to Chisel the wall down
[1:28:31] they just did what God Said worshiped
[1:28:34] God in the word and God took care of the
[1:28:38] rest
[1:28:40] even for Rahab here hallelujah
[1:28:43] even for Rahab she pulled a token what
[1:28:47] she needed out of them and that token
[1:28:49] was so powerful that when the judgments
[1:28:52] of God came it held up her wall
[1:28:57] amen
[1:29:00] Joshua 6 24.
[1:29:02] and they burnt the city with fire and
[1:29:04] all the other end only the silver and
[1:29:07] the gold and the vessels of Braxton of
[1:29:09] iron they put into the treasury of the
[1:29:10] house of the Lord and Joshua saved Rahab
[1:29:13] the Heartland alive
[1:29:15] and her father's household and all that
[1:29:18] she had and she dwelleth in Israel even
[1:29:20] unto this day why because she was better
[1:29:22] than everybody else because she hid the
[1:29:25] message
[1:29:26] which Joshua sent to spy how Jericho
[1:29:32] got a Rahab in here
[1:29:34] amen
[1:29:37] if she was able to pull out that token
[1:29:39] to save her household
[1:29:41] how much more with you with the promise
[1:29:44] as I invite the musicians up let me read
[1:29:46] this quote to you Billy Graham said in
[1:29:48] the token
[1:29:49] that very first quote yep that one right
[1:29:51] there
[1:29:54] no it's not that one I'm sorry it's
[1:29:55] 640208 paragraph 98.
[1:30:00] they might have thought the big thing
[1:30:02] they lived in that big system that was
[1:30:05] going to save them talking about Jericho
[1:30:07] thinking Jericho was going to save them
[1:30:09] but we found out everything that didn't
[1:30:11] show that token perished in that City
[1:30:14] so will it be at the coming of the son
[1:30:16] of man
[1:30:17] he has done said so
[1:30:20] there must have been some of them tape
[1:30:22] boys or somebody slipping to that place
[1:30:24] down there and play some tapes to them
[1:30:28] I'm one of those little I'm one of that
[1:30:30] Rahab some of those tapes I listen can I
[1:30:33] be real with you I still remember the
[1:30:34] first tape I listened to
[1:30:37] it was the 62 Super sign 0618 super sign
[1:30:41] and I remember I was driving my little
[1:30:43] Ford Focus driving to the driving to
[1:30:45] work at a metal Factory
[1:30:47] my brother Ram starts going down a
[1:30:49] little testimony you don't mind if I
[1:30:51] share it with you it's one of my
[1:30:52] favorite testimonies about that baby who
[1:30:54] got raised in Mexico
[1:30:57] and the papers interview them the next
[1:31:00] day
[1:31:01] do you believe our Saints could raise
[1:31:03] the dead too and he said you can't be a
[1:31:05] saint unless you're dead
[1:31:06] so how can a dead Saint raise up a dead
[1:31:09] baby if they're dead
[1:31:11] so the man asked brother banham what do
[1:31:13] you think of the Catholic church and he
[1:31:15] goes I'm sorry you asked me that
[1:31:18] do I have to answer you
[1:31:21] said like to hear he said it's the
[1:31:22] highest form of spiritualism there is
[1:31:25] true that man said what do you mean he
[1:31:26] said well you all these gods and
[1:31:27] goddesses that you worship he said
[1:31:29] they're dead he's not why Mr Branham
[1:31:32] Christ is oh you worship Christ and he
[1:31:34] died he said but he raised again on the
[1:31:37] third day
[1:31:38] and he's alive now amen
[1:31:43] ain't that awesome well guess what the
[1:31:46] the uh the one month old message
[1:31:48] believer thought it was awesome too
[1:31:49] because I was driving in my Ford Focus
[1:31:52] when I heard that and I just started
[1:31:54] having a shot with fit and said glory to
[1:31:56] God I'm all over the road that night
[1:32:01] sometimes God's gonna make you do some
[1:32:03] funny things but you know what I didn't

[1:32:21] Branham in the tape and I don't remember
[1:32:23] what he said but he said something so

[1:32:27] cab there I started speaking in tongues

[1:32:35] really did I was here and then all of a
[1:32:37] sudden I was at the stop sign stopped I
