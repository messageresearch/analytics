heal them and Lord we are speaking tonight to the young people and we have a thought and Lord that thought I believe comes from your word but we ask you to take it and may it find good fertile ground in their hearts where it would bear fruit in their lives and many years from now they would look back and see and say you know what that was a stake I drove and I made a decision there to serve the Lord each one of of us Lord may we be one step closer to you and your coming and being ready for your coming when we exit the doors tonight we place all these our words our thoughts our mind our body our hands and our feet eyes and ears mouth tongue into your hands tonight we love you Lord and we'll try to do our best for you we ask you to come Lord and walk up and down the aisles hug each one as it we're up next to you we love you Lord in Jesus name amen so you may be seated so we um have a little subject tonight that we're going to speak on and I'd like to talk about yolks and uh I asked Aon this morning if he knew what a snare was and he pointed to the drum back here and I said that's true but not totally true so Aaron what is a yoke something in an egg I knew you were going to say that so this is true it is part of a this is the lovely part of the English language uh it is part of the egg that it's the dippy part that you stick your toast in yes but that's not what I'm going to talk about tonight um so we're going to talk about about a yoke and what a yoke is it's not an egg and what the purpose of it is and who you want to be yolked with and who you do not want to be yoked with so you can see it's not on the breakfast egg theme here so if I pick micaah to come on up here because I believe in audience participant patient and so Mah can you come on up and so and and you you'll forgive me um I had I had I had I'm sure I had you and I had you and I had you all in my cabin this year so I'm gon to I'm going to ask you to come on up too I think you knocked your tooth out didn't you did you get your tooth fixed this is no this is true life this is life stand up and smile I mean I'm serious turn around smile yeah so no joking this is what happens at Camp right Zachary yeah we're in our cabin Zachary's there with me it's a great partner you can sit back down thanks for thanks for smiling so was it right front tooth wasn't it yeah right front tooth so you know obviously it's big tooth you know mom's not there and he comes I go where is the tooth he goes oh I put it in my bag I said no no no get it out we'll get it in milk and we'll you know we'll we'll try to get it back in and so uh thankfully sister Dorothy M Dorothy um mcclard is a dental uh hygienist and she helped us and you I don't think that day they did anything but they did help the pain because this thing was broke off not just a chip this thing whole thing was gone I mean the whole tooth was gone so it's great to see and you have yeah you know I don't know how you you don't need your teeth for Christmas so it's good it's good yeah it's great to see you have both front teeth yeah oh ask kids you know you have your teeth what happened to your teeth did you lose them yeah well go look for them you know but okay help me out your name again onean okay onean micaah so behind you is a yoke so you can uncover this here and and where do I get this stuff well this is at my parents house and I I modified it a little bit so get that on so this is a this Aon is a yoke so yeah so so hold it out here I'm not going to wear this thing you guys are so this is is an object lesson you don't want to forget if you're young and looking for a spouse so who would that be in the audience nobody's getting married in the next 10 years that's nice and the parents in the back said amen especially the dads that are paying for these things okay hold it this way hold it this way so this is a yoke here so we got a yoke so there is a purpose to this yoke right so uh you put your head in there and and you and one you put your head in there okay you got to so so the the next scripture we're going to look at here this could be uncomfortable eh after a little bit so what's the purpose of this yoke what's the purpose of the Yoke first what's wrong with the Yoke here the what stand up straight m what's the problem with this yoke un uneven it's it's it would be uneven well let's turn to another scripture so go to 2 Corinthians 6:14 very good who said uneven good very good excellent yeah so here we got these guys aren't even right so so we could pick another boy to come up here would we want a bigger boy or a little boy depends who we get rid of you would want a bigger guy no definitely get rid of me get rid of you is your neck hurt yeah no you're just like this is you don't like being up here you're probably going to be a preacher cuz that makes two of us now yes it does so if we got two we we we want to be let's go to go to your scripture we got it up there be ye not say it with me be ye not okay what does unequally mean what ises unequally mean uh do we put a cat with a dog in a yoke hello do we put a giraffe with a donkey think of something else do you put a horse and an ox in a yoke what normally goes in here two animals of the same type going in the same for the same we're done that's the short version that's the short version so like I said this morning if you want to fall asleep Juan now's your chance buddy catch up on the sleep you got the short version be ye not say it again be I I love memorization because the great thing about the Lord is he will bring those things to your remembrance when you have a problem okay there's a girl in front of you she looks nice but she's not your type cuz she's not a Believer and you are or you're a Believer and he's not and that say it with me be ye not yok together with unbeliever for what fellow ship hath righteousness with and what communion hath light with Darkness so we got two here that aren't equally yolked so Zach come on up here are you closer to closer to Juan or Micaiah come on up here come on we got a we got a yeah 5 tall you're 5'8 how tall are you Mah six foot we well let's try it put it put them in here we'll see what happens Juan you get to sit down there you go buddy thank you for your help yeah can you get down can you get can you get by you Zach step over this way guys okay so we got him here together just to give you this this doesn't cost a thing this one so Jesus laid in a Manger did he not in a barn because there was no place for him in the and he was wrapped in Aaron what's swaddling cloths it's okay I'll give you a break on this one this a free question so on the back of Zach and on the back of ox Zach and on the back of ox micaah there would be a a cloth here because it would rub micaiah's neck and get sweaty and hot and stink and manure and that's what the Lord was W was wrapped in he was wrapped in swaddling cloths so that we could be wrapped in the Robes of his righteousness is't that nice in that kindness is that Amazing Grace do you know Grace I know it I know him I know them yeah so we got we got a we pretty close you're pretty close here you can let it rest down there I think a little bit Yeah rest down there a little bit yep I truly got this from my parents' basement so but my dad helped me rig this up so we got them yoked up here so they're

what's your favorite candy Caleb M&M so if I put this M&M's over here and Zach you said we got a couple choices here Snickers Skittles kitkats which one Skittles Skittles okay so if I put these skit kit these Skittles over here skit cats put those over there and I say you're going to go to the what you want and you go to what you want [Laughter] go without knocking over the piano I think Caleb's gonna win Zach you go with him so who gave up Zach gave up I I'll hand it to you so you don't fall off the platform okay so and they're going to go over this but but can you walk there by yourself so can two walk together unless they be so they got to agree hey we're going to go get your candy then we're going to get my candy it's kind of like a marriage they have one goal and one destination in mind when you're yoked up with somebody you're going to go the way they're going to go you don't have a choice if they're bigger than you so if I'm yoked up with Juan I'm going to go wherever Juan wants to go if I'm w yoked up with Jeremy I'm going wherever he wants now Zachary that's a different story I could take him where I wanted to cuz I'm stronger I think so I was thinking about this yoke put the first quote up there just brother Brandon he'll come so many when you start doing searches on things and you'll see yoke and unequally yolked and so many different quotes that he'll bring out this one here he says this is about Jehoshaphat actually that's not the correct one that's from this morning but I'll I'll just start reading it and it and another thing as soon as Jehoshaphat ordinarily now would have been prayed over the subject would have thought about it first and said God what must I do but being yolked up with the unbelievers he took the unbelievers way and that's the way many Spirit-filled Christians after Revival fall because they yok themselves up up amongst people that said well I go to church we're as good as the rest of them and you lose your experience stay right on the road no matter what the rest of them does you know where you belong you know where who who you belong to stay right under the power of the pray of prayer all the time don't let them call you off to something something something else in amusements and so forth saying there's no harm in this if there's a question don't do it and stay away from it the next next slide I I was going by an Amish farm may want to dim it a little bit so this boy is controlling I think I counted six big horses that are yolked together they're pulling as a team to plow this field but one little boy is is controlling all these horses so do you know how much one horse can pull in a yoke 8,000 PBS so that's one horse a big horse how many how much can two horses pull now us that are higher level homeschool Mathers would say 8,000 * 2 would be but that's not true they can pull 24,000 so it says bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ so if you see somebody struggling they're in a yoke you you help them because you can pull twice no you can pull three times the load that they can so if in other words don't kick them when they're down boys your brother am so if you're in this yoke together Caleb and Zach one of you wants to play fortnite and the other one doesn't if you're yolked with that person chances are you're going to do whatever the stronger person is spiritually if you're Yol to your job this is where it hits the back a little bit more than the front you won't be a church on Sunday you might not be a church Sunday night you might not be a church Wednesday night or whatever night you have church if you're yolked to your job because your job is stronger than you are and it's going to pull you around if you're yolked to sports that's going to be where you're going to go whoever is the strongest will win so let's read this verse again can you pull that one up there 2 Corinthians 6:14 be ye not unequally yolked together with so we're talking about marriage I know nobody in here is going to get married only the people that are already married are going to stay married but the rest of you aren't going to get married this is going back years but they sang a song Never Say I do because if you do you're through and that was John leontine John Paul wrote that and we we sang it on a hill every one of those guys is married but if you let's just you're yolked with an unbelieving spouse it's a constant struggle and a constant fight because she or he doesn't want to do the things that you do as a Believer because you're yoked with an unbeliever so it says be ye not unequally yolked together with so brother brandham makes a statement on be certain of God he says and no believer so why are you telling me this John I'm only 16 1315 because in a short years you're going to be faced with this question and if I address it now then I can say I told you so no no but but if I address it now I feel like I'm pretty I mean I at least gave a warning so he said no believer should ever marry an unbeliever under no circumstances should always marry Believers and if you would memorize any quote as a young girl or a young boy this is it she doesn't want to go to church or he doesn't want to go to church a constant struggle he wants to have devotions she doesn't a constant struggle she doesn't love the Lord you do or he doesn't love the Lord and you do they don't have the same absolute we do so the things that you'd like to Institute in the home according to the message of the hour to make it line up with every word because you want to as the head of the house isn't going to fly because there's a constant struggle they'll get saved after we get married this is where you shake your head like this okay because it doesn't work that way two questions I asked my boys my boys yeah the my boys two questions asked the boys that married my two daughters and so you know you can ask your dad girls or boys you can ask your dad mom ask both but there are some good things that you should be doing so that your and your parents should be helping you to avoid traps of the devil so the first one I ask the boys is were you ever married before or were you engaged now this is just home talk yeah but I said even girls I said even before you talk to a boy I don't mean saying hi or you know that's a nice outfit or that I'm not talking about that but what I'm talking about seriously talking to a boy or talking to a girl I said just come talk to me first because then you can tell me if you really want to even talk to this boy and it'll look like I'm saying no or you can say yes and then I'll ask him these two questions and the first question was have you ever been married before or engaged and and then the second time thing question I asked him was can you tell me when you were saved and when you were filled with the Holy Ghost because no man should ever be married or women girls should be married until they they receive the Holy Ghost because that's going to guide them into all truth it's going to help them prevent problems when they're yolked together because nobody has problems in their marriage I know and you're like this is way above our heads John nobody has problems in our marriage but if they're unequally yolked you are bound for problems but as long as you have an absolute and the same goal and the same purpose you're going to head to the same direction and then the same destination so this next quote brother Bram says here this is a making the valley full of dishes I love this because he's talking to you Aaron at the bottom of the quote he says now this was during the time of Israel's backsliding they'd gotten away from God and Judah had a king now the king of Israel was Ahab who had succeeded his father who had married out of the Jewish people married just like today when a Christian boy marries a sinner girl or a sinner girl a Christian boy that starts something right then see don't you get married unless you're equally yolked together with Believers equally yolked so when you read the scripture now you're going to see these two boys up here standing but if I was more Brave I would have a girl up here standing but I didn't want to do that because I don't want to be unequally yoked or yolked together yet are you with me don't get married unless you're equally yolked together with belie Believers you know to keep trouble down see now when God made men and women in the beginning he made their Spirits then then someone there's someone for you it's hard to believe I know there's someone for you just wait see all right so there is someone for you each person in here there's someone for you brother vam says on another quote he says choosing of bride said you have to plan and he said you have to look and he said you have to pray and I would say it should be all in order here plan you know you can deny it and say you're not planning and say you're not looking but you better be praying so the devil's given us giving you a yoke has a yoke of bondage that he wants to put on you so he wants to yoke you up with something right so how's your back doing you okay you okay Caleb you're doing fine makai's doing okay yeah okay you owe him later so there's hooks on here for a purpose so the devil's not happy just to have you yolked with an unbeliever and yolked with the you got it there Zach you got it okay so but what he wants to do he wants to start waiting you down so step out there a little further keep the Yol equal guys so I got these rocks these are good Pennsylvania sandstone rocks let us lay aside the weight that so easily doth beset us okay step out here a little bit you got that Zach man you are not going to forgive me step out yep grab it like that that's probably good good Caleb you can grab yours like that too and helps sh your back okay step out here a little bit step out here a little further so we got some weight on there now how long you think you can do this hope short sermon man hope he doesn't have a button in there I want you to turn to a scripture Matthew 11:28 so I'm going to give you I'm going to let the cat out of the bag here there are two yolks okay this is Matthew 11:28 come unto me all ye that are that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you take whose yoke would that be take my yoke sh am be the Lord's he said take my whose yoke do you guys have on you got weights here sin that's besetting you be hard to race hard to pull hard to get to a destination but they got they're in a yoke but he said take my yoke upon you so he's asking us to swap yolks he's asking you to get out of the devil's yoke and get into the Lord's yoke take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly and heart and you shall find rest in your souls for my yoke is shakina and uh what's your friend's name there yeah what's her name Faith Faith come on up here Faith come on up here we go yeah I'm I'm sorry this is this is we're informal I know this is like okay so there you go girls put that on okay your yoke together get it on there okay so he says my yoke is and my burden is so these girls they wanted the Lord's yoke praise God yeah so Faith you yeah you can keep it it's brand new brand new nobody's ever worn it before put it on there I actually want one you want you want one okay so so there you go so is you how's that Yol there you got on oh it's nice it's pretty good yeah yeah yeah this is not for church brother John was handing out these so people could sleep no no no no no no we weren't no we weren't there we go so we got we got his yoke on and he said my yoke is easy and my burden is or do you want the devil's yoke how are you guys feeling over there pretty good pretty good you got the raw end of the deal maybe okay so we'll give you some we'll give you ones too Zach you can put it on there as you've been standing up here this whole service you better get something out of this there you go you got to unsnap it on the bottom so is there two yolks yeah yeah there you go Caleb there you go next plane ride when you go to see [Laughter] her who are you yoked up with go to the next one next quote there for me brother Brian why if you become a real child of God while the old things has passed away you're yolked up and it's oh such a pleasure to pack the Yoke of Christ with him know that you're yolked together as citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven your joint HS with him in heaven it's easy so she kind of you know she has a little splash place in my heart I'll just be honest with you I got you know kids will this is I don't know what to do with some of this money I got I got just money like a dollar I got a tithe here I'm serious I still have this shakina from 7:14 2019 shakaya McLaren an offering and I kept it in my Bible I'll look at that every now and then you know but uh you know when you're having a problem it's awful nice to know you got a friend and you can look over there at Faith you say faith how are you doing and faith can look at you and say how are you doing because you're yolked together but the beautiful part is that faith not in that other yoke over there it's the Lord Jesus and he says take my yoke upon you for my my yoke is easy and my burden is light it's brother bam says as a citizen you're Yol together so that's you and the Lord he's a friend that Stith closer than a and he's right there next to you Zach when you got a problem at school when you got a problem at home you look to the left and he's there you look to the right and he's there with you you're pulling in the same direction because you swapped you made a decision to swap yolks amen you might say Lord I have a lot of anxiety he looks over goes hey I'm with you we got this I got a lot of depression I'm worried about you know what I I thought about it hurting myself I'm right here with you don't worry I'm with you we got this we're going to Glory so and you guys can sit down too I'll let you sit down oh you don't want to Zach can you get it down let me take the weight off let me take this weight off because this will make it easier right if we take if we get rid of this weight at the altar hold on we get rid of this we get rid of this weight and I say Isa you want you guys want to swap yolks see what those girls had that easy Yol yeah go ahead take it off he don't drop it my goodness okay yep just lay it right down there that's good don't forget your these are those are yours and you you put this yolk on now we're going to swap yolks so we would put that on we're not going to Zach you just lay just put your shoulders in there yeah too much work so they they decide to swap yolks looks a little easier take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there leave them there leave them there take your burdens to the Lord and leave them there if you trust in never doubt he will always bring you out take your burdens to the Lord and and get yolked up with him you guys can sit down take this light Yol yep thanks for helping [Applause] me can you skip ahead to the brother Brian it's the second last quote so going back to where who you're yolked with and I said it to Aaron this morning just actually go back one more I'm sorry brother Bram says here you are today who you are what you are because several years ago you Cho chose to be to be what you are now and what you choose now will determine what you'll be five years from today so I will say to kids when I'm doing well child checks I'll say what do you want to be they're 16 Aaron how how old are you 15 now you're 20 I'm sorry what's your name right here in front M Zoe that's a great name that's my oldest daughter's name it's great God's life so what what how old are you 17 you're 22 now that's how quick it'll happen one how old are you 11 you're now 16 you're driving is your mom and dad in here they are okay he has the same name as you so five years is going to go by like that but if you show me who you're yolked with now I'll show you where you'll be in five years and five years is going to be here really quick one you'll be getting your license your mom and dad will be saying praying every night may may he wear his seat belt I hope he's going the right places but you know what he's yolked up with the Lord so the Lord's always with him so he's as safe here as Hudson is Hudson here so we're I just another side note we're in uh out at Bryce Canyon I think it was Bryce Canyon was chice Canyon and and I don't like heights jerem me I don't I would never be a guide up in the mountains or anything like that a Grand Canyon it's okay to look at from a distance but I said to Hudson we were coming home from that and there's like thousand foot drop off and it's kind of scary for me and I said to Hudson I said were you scared Hudson and all he goes no he said I'm as safe here as I would be in my bed at home he's seven yeah he's seven he said because it's appointed on the man wants to die he's well taught but you know if you're yolked with the Lord you won't be leaving early you'll be leaving at your appointed time so your parents don't have anything to worry about why you are today because of the friends you're going to make today and who you're going to decide to be yolked up with is going to show your destination will be 5 years from now so I'll say to kids show me your friends and I'll show you your future because who you decide to be yolked with will show where you'll be five years from now so this quote goes on and what you choose now he says five years from today you may be a missionary Aaron five years from today you may be a renowned Christian or five years from today you may be in hell because you made the wrong decision 5 years from today you may be cleaning spatoon in a barroom five years from today you may be a prostitute on the street or you may be a man or a woman that's a credit to any society because of your choice for Christ five years from today you may be in glory we say all that wouldn't happen but it could so quickly happen gone in the Rapture because you made your choice today but you've got to choose so you've got to choose which yoke you want if you're yolked with Christ I know where I'm going he's right beside you every step of the way he is gonna guide you you know there is a lead horse and a lead Ox in a team you want him leading you you want him guiding you there's one more quote brother the brandham talks about being yolked and this one's so good he's talking to the brandham Tabernacle and he's talking about being prisoners we talked about traps this morning I want to be a prisoner of the Lord I don't want to be trapped by the devil he says here oh tonight if we as the brandham Tabernacle could only become prisoners to our own selfish being to our own ambition that we could completely surrender ourselves and be yoke to who yok to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest of the world does we're yolked with feathers of love we are prisoners my feet is so yok to Christ it won't dance because he's leading you and you're yolked with him my eyes is so yolked to Christ till I when I see these modern stripes on the street it turns my head my my heart is so yolked in love to him till I can't have love for this world anymore my will is so yolked to him till I don't even know now what my ambitions are know now what my ambitions are just wherever you lead I'll follow Lord I'll be a prisoner that's my desire let's just bow our heads maybe you're here tonight and you realize that you're yolked up with the wrong person there's two yolks to choose the Devils or the Lords and only you know who you're yolked with is your burden light he said my yoke is easy and my burden is light and you want to swap yolks tonight you feel you're not yoked up with the right person and you want to swap yolks because you know that your destination 5 years from now would not be a good one and you want to raise your hand and you want to sayl I want to swap yolks I want to be yolked up with you for I know I want you as my friend that sticks closer than a brother I want to be in the Yoke with you I want you to guide me I want you to take me to Glory with you and you want to raise your hand you might be yoked up with the Lord but you're carrying some burdens you want to leave up here at the altar you want to leave those heavy weights so you can can run a better race just lay him [Music] down you know it's an act to defy gravity to raise your hand but brother brandom said many times it would mean the difference in your Eternal destination so if you want to raise your hand that you want to stay yolked with him you raise your hand my eyes are closed Heavenly Father we love you we want you to lead us and guide us Lord we want to take your yoke upon us for your yoke is easy and your burdens light Lord we don't want to be unequally yolked with unbelievers we want to be yolked equally with you for we know if we have a problem Lord in our life School home anxiety a sickness Lord we can look to the right and you're there right in that yoke with us pulling we look to the left and you're there oh what a comfort what a hope Lord we know we're safe as long as you're in that yoke with us if we stumble Lord you'll hold us up if we're pulling a load and it feels too heavy we can say Lord we need your help help us pull cuz you can with you on our side Lord we're winners so we ask you to come and each hand that's raised Lord both my hands are up I truly want you to stay in the yoke with me Lord I want to lay aside every weight and sin that does so easily to beset me run with patience the race that's before me Lord each one of us here tonight Lord we're here not on a Sunday night just to see each other or what we're wearing or what we're doing Lord and see our friends that would be good Lord but we're here to get closer to you we want to meet you someday in person Lord and that's our goal so we pray that each young person here Lord that they would make a choice that would be the right choice for 5 years will be here just in a moment and they want to serve you Lord with their whole heart so each person Lord that has their hand up or that's under the sound of my voice that they would make the choices that would keep you in the Yoke with them Lord Lord we're asking you to lead us and to guide us Lord we're going to get lost like brother brandham did on Hurricane Mountain there Lord he was in that death walk walk just going in a circle and he felt a hand on his shoulder and then he he heard a voice that said I'm a very present help in time of trouble so Lord we we want you not just when we're in trouble we want you all the time and if we do anything to grieve you away may we know it in an instant and say we're sorry and ask for you to come back lord we love you we appreciate you you're so kind to us thank you for the people's kind kindness to me each child here Lord each adult each one Lord we love you if there's anything we can do for you with our hands or our feet or our mouth our eyes our tongue we'll be willing and able agents for you we love you father thank you for your kindness to us again your Amazing Grace in Jesus name [Music] amen [Music] never let me [Music] go I laid all down [Music] again oh just to hear

Yoke with you it's a wonderful thing when you're down or even when you're not down it's to know it's a great to know you're in step with him if you watch teams or you see oxen they're pulling in unison all in the same step not one horse gets out of line and they just keep pulling and keep going for a goal but they're all yolked together one goes down other pick him up keep carrying him one of those eight horses that little boy had control of if one of those Stu humbled wouldn't make a difference cuz everybody else was carrying him so you remember that the person next to you boys your mom and dad pray for them pray for each other and we love you thank you brother Samuel for your kindness to us and thank you all for coming out it's been a good night to be with the Lord isn't it I'm so glad I'm yoked with him I'm so glad he's my friend you know saved by grace you know saved by grace Save By Grace We Know It song Save By Grace Save By Grace this is one of my favorite songs lately

the Lord my my my tell you what you'll never read these scriptures the same way you know like how when you're in a in a dictionary I know those are for those of you that's younger they were actually books that had pages in them there wasn't an app and when you come to a certain word sometimes that word could have such an abstract meaning that it would say see and then we give you a picture well now in your Bible You'll Think of Zach and Micaiah You'll Think of Juan and mAh and the these visuals are are etched in but most importantly is is that what God has done for your life right here tonight and you know when the Lord brings it all the way down you you realize that no matter where you would be setting at tonight all it takes is one choice Satan doesn't have any more power than you allow him to have when David went out there to face Goliath the very first thing that Satan did is the tactic he uses with everyone if I can use a phrase that we all many would understand he tried to Rattle his cage get in his head you're nothing but a youth who are you to come and challenge me but you see the size of David size-wise he was no match for Goliath but it's who was on the inside of David it's Who David was standing for and he was standing with David all Goliath saw was a was a little guy but what he couldn't see was the invisible God whom David was yolked [Music] with that's what makes the difference that's what makes the difference is who you're yolked with cuz then you can say I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me amen he he Christ is the Difference Maker amen amen don't you love him my my my my oh I was guilty of the charges doomed in disgrace oh but my Jesus with special love say Me by his grace oh will he pleaded and he pleaded he pleaded my

Zachary Wallace if you just come and dismiss us in a word of prayer I me say it's been good to be in in the house of the Lord amen the things that the Lord has done right here tonight right here in this service I'd say if anybody if you need prayer would be happy to stay and to pray with you it's not a burden it's a blessing for us and I say that what it starts just as the Lord brought it through brother John always know this I think that last quote that was given it's so important of the impact of our choices that we make today see even by putting off you're making a choice even something right now that where God deals with your heart just let it be settled in your heart say Lord I give it to you Lord you raised your hand the Holy Spirit was calling out you see what God first touches and what he deals with is your heart when the heart agrees with the word then it releases the power of God to bring to pass what you've received and it comes to pass God's word cannot fail it
