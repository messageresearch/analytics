[40:40] chapter 9 we want to just read a few
[40:47] verses of Scripture and then we'll let
[40:48] you have your seats in verse 1 of Romans
[40:54] 9
[41:01] all said I say the truth in Christ I lie
[41:04] not my conscience also bearing me
[41:08] witness in the Holy Ghost that I have
[41:11] great heaviness and continual sorrow in
[41:14] my form where I could wish that myself
[41:18] were accursed from Christ for my
[41:20] brethren my kinsmen according to the
[41:23] flesh who are Israelites to whom pertain
[41:27] it the adoption and the glory and the
[41:30] covenants and the giving of the law and
[41:33] the service of God and the promises
[41:37] whose are the fathers and of whom as
[41:42] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[41:45] over all God bless forever amen
[41:50] may the Lord bless as you're being
[41:52] seated and we'll just continue to read
[41:54] in verse 6 there Paul goes on not as
[42:02] though the Word of God have taken none
[42:06] effect but they are not all Israel which
[42:09] are of Israel neither because they are
[42:14] the seed of Abraham are they all
[42:16] children but an Isaac shall thy seed be
[42:19] called that is they which are the
[42:22] children of the flesh these are not the
[42:25] children of God but the children of the
[42:28] promise are counted for the seed but
[42:32] this is the word of promise at this time
[42:34] I will come and Sara shall have a son
[42:36] and not only this but when Rebekah also
[42:40] had conceived by one even by our Father
[42:43] Isaac for the children being not yet
[42:46] born neither having done any good or
[42:49] evil that the purpose of God according
[42:54] to election might stand not of works but
[42:58] of him that calleth it was said unto her
[43:02] the elder shall serve the younger
[43:05] as it is written Jacob have I loved but
[43:10] Esau have I hated
[43:14] we want to continue look at that fall
[43:16] here tonight the blessing belongs to the
[43:22] Blessed and we want to just look at this
[43:26] in the unfolding and the opening of the
[43:28] scripture but I would like to started
[43:32] looking at the scripture in means of
[43:37] this that we know that God deals with
[43:42] every generation God deals with every
[43:46] heart God's not obligated to give one
[43:49] person more than one opportunity
[43:52] he's only obligated to give one
[43:55] opportunity so God will move through and
[44:03] by his word to give direction give
[44:07] leadership to his children that are
[44:12] within the time and the day that we are
[44:15] living a lot of times it would seem like
[44:19] when we are looking at things that it
[44:23] would seem as though that we have
[44:25] forever what we don't as a matter of
[44:29] fact it's very imperative for our lives
[44:32] that we move when God is moving David
[44:38] when he had let it be known of the Lord
[44:40] that God let him know when he should go
[44:45] out to battle and that's when he would
[44:46] hear the rustle and the mulberry leaves
[44:49] we know that that rustling was not a
[44:53] natural wind but that was the angels of
[44:56] God that were going before David so
[45:00] David would know it was a sound that
[45:03] would come through and move the natural
[45:05] leaves in the branches but it was not a
[45:08] sound that was emanated from natural
[45:11] means it was a sound that was emanated
[45:14] from the angels of God and how that they
[45:17] were moving to go before him it's very
[45:19] important that we move when God is
[45:22] desiring for us to move
[45:25] you think about it that was here within
[45:28] the scriptures that we're looking at it
[45:30] and God is making known that of election
[45:33] of this between Jacob and Esau so let's
[45:38] just break in here tonight upon this
[45:40] knowing many of the things that we can
[45:43] look at and we can read by way of
[45:44] Scripture even and where we're reading
[45:46] in Romans nine we know somewhat by the
[45:48] outcome but yet we know everything that
[45:50] God has laid out in Scripture is not a
[45:53] past happening but it is prophetic that
[45:57] continues to repeat itself all the way
[45:59] down through time even that of what took
[46:02] place even in the garden with Abel and
[46:05] Cain it continues to repeat itself all
[46:07] the way down to the very consummating of
[46:10] time when we look here in the scriptures
[46:12] we break in on a place in verse 19 of
[46:16] Genesis 25 and it says these are the
[46:19] generations of Isaac Abraham's son
[46:22] Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac was 40
[46:26] years old when he took Rebekah to wife
[46:28] the daughter of the fuel does say the
[46:31] Sirian of panorama the sister of Laban
[46:34] the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord
[46:37] for his wife because she was barren and
[46:39] the Lord was entreated of him and
[46:42] Rebecca his wife conceived and the
[46:46] children struggled together within her
[46:48] and she said if it be so why am i thus
[46:52] and she went to inquire of the Lord and
[46:54] the Lord said unto her two nations are
[46:58] in thy womb and two manner of people
[47:01] shall be separated from thy bowels and
[47:04] the one people shall be stronger than
[47:06] the other people and the elders shall
[47:09] serve the younger and when her days to
[47:12] be delivered were fulfilled behold there
[47:15] were twins in her womb now when we look
[47:20] at this in the scripture it doesn't take
[47:22] much to understand that there's probably
[47:26] we could agree that among us here
[47:28] tonight there is no one else
[47:30] that'll be my twin there's no one else
[47:33] in this building here that you would be
[47:35] setting and say that could
[47:37] be your twin so a twin is not somebody
[47:40] who just merely would resemble or half
[47:43] well you know the kind of got eyes like
[47:44] brother Samuel maybe knows but there
[47:46] must be such a place to where the
[47:48] scripture would identify that it's twins
[47:50] it must have very similar features very
[47:54] similar characteristics very all of
[47:57] these things that would be to the place
[47:58] to where you could look and say these
[48:01] are twins but yet all the way on the
[48:03] outside it could be it would be twins
[48:05] but see what God looks at is down below
[48:08] because God God sees is what part is
[48:12] that corresponding part that is actually
[48:14] truly of him in the election so here
[48:18] when we're looking at this in the
[48:19] scripture how that Rebekah has asked of
[48:22] the Lord why is this struggle going on
[48:24] within me why is this struggle taking
[48:26] place and how that God makes known to
[48:29] Rebekah
[48:29] he makes known to her personally that
[48:32] what is taking place there are actually
[48:33] two manners of people there are actually
[48:36] two nations that are within the womb
[48:38] that it will be separated from that vows
[48:40] verse verse 25 goes on to say and the
[48:43] first came out read all over like a
[48:46] hairy garment and they called his name
[48:48] Esau and after that came his brother out
[48:51] and his hand took hold on Esau's hill
[48:54] and his name was called Jacob and Isaac
[48:57] was threescore years old when she bare
[49:00] him or bare them sorry and the boys grew
[49:03] and he saw was a cunning hunter a man of
[49:06] the field and Jacob was a plain man
[49:09] dwelling in tents I want you to watch
[49:12] this verse here and Isaac loved Esau
[49:16] because he did eat of his venison but
[49:20] Rebekah loved Jacob my lord Isaac loved
[49:27] Esau but Rebekah loved Jacob now you
[49:33] remember that within this Rebekah has
[49:36] spiritual insight to what has been
[49:39] taking place within her wounds she's
[49:42] actually had it spoken directly to her
[49:44] by the Lord it's not something that
[49:46] Rebekah is going to wonder when she's
[49:48] seeing a Esau this way and Jacob this
[49:51] way
[49:51] she's already heard in the message of
[49:54] power transformation that in the last
[49:56] days it will be twins that will come
[49:58] forth from the same movement same church
[50:01] but will be different fathers are you
[50:04] with me so our twin is not something
[50:06] that's out there our twin is right
[50:08] around where we're at are you lift me
[50:11] now because when we're looking at this
[50:13] we come to begin to see that as Isaac
[50:16] himself loved Esau and I would dare I
[50:19] would definitely say that probably
[50:20] within each and every one of us when you
[50:22] look at how that Isaac could look upon
[50:25] Esau he saw himself how brother Ram will
[50:28] tell us many different times how Esau
[50:30] was a much better man morally than what
[50:33] Jacob was Esau would have been the
[50:35] person that if you would have looked at
[50:37] you would have said he saw my water what
[50:39] a really a fantastic person what a
[50:42] upright person morally but you begin to
[50:45] realize how that the scripture will talk
[50:47] about Jacob in that how that it will
[50:49] always describe Jacob to be a deceiver
[50:51] and a supplanter but that was according
[50:53] to his first birth because down beneath
[50:56] that there was a real true seed of God
[50:58] but yet what you would see an assault
[51:01] sparked according to how the Prophet
[51:02] would tell us in the message he said
[51:04] what you would see on Esau up here but
[51:07] yet he said God was able to look down to
[51:08] the heart of Esau and see a deceiver
[51:12] down there on the inside so it's what
[51:15] what it is on the inside will come out
[51:18] nobody can hide that it will actually
[51:20] manifest whatever the seed is on the
[51:23] inside the germ itself will manifest if
[51:26] you understand it in then we understand
[51:28] in the right life the rain nor the Sun
[51:30] that cometh down upon the earth it does
[51:32] not take a tomato seed and make it an
[51:35] orange see neither does it make it an or
[51:37] untick an orange seed and make it a
[51:38] lemon see the only thing that does is
[51:41] release the germ that's always there
[51:43] that's the same thing with the
[51:44] quickening power of God the quickening
[51:46] power of God does not take you and turn
[51:48] you from a pig to a sheep it releases
[51:51] who you always were it reveals that you
[51:54] are always a sheep of God
[51:56] it changes the nature that is true but
[51:59] it releases who you were now you and I
[52:02] without the Spirit of God no matter
[52:04] how much of an inclination and a desire
[52:06] to serve God we can never be able to
[52:09] please God in the right way and serve
[52:11] Him in the right measure unless he
[52:13] himself will come and release us so that
[52:17] we're not serving him according to our
[52:19] own dictates but we are serving him
[52:21] according to his life moving within us
[52:24] so it's not our sacrifice it is the
[52:27] sacrifice he has provided and were
[52:30] identified in that by having the life of
[52:32] the sacrifice in us so if you look at
[52:35] Isaac and we could say that Isaac
[52:37] himself being a type of the father the
[52:39] written word and you would look at Esau
[52:41] Esau was one who was able to abide by
[52:44] the written principles of the word Esau
[52:47] was one who was able to take principles
[52:49] in the word whether it be finances
[52:51] marriage on and on and on and Esau was
[52:53] actually able to move and operate within
[52:56] certain principles and you know what God
[52:59] if we can look at it in this slide
[53:01] there's one not one of us who would say
[53:04] no I don't want somebody who works
[53:05] beside me at the job that will just go
[53:07] by the principles of the word I'd rather
[53:09] have a drunkard I'd rather have this I'd
[53:11] rather have that but we would rather
[53:13] have someone that at least we could talk
[53:15] about the scriptures with someone that
[53:17] if it's no more than just salvation we
[53:19] would enjoy that instead of hearing what
[53:21] somebody did this past weekend we still
[53:23] know that it takes the same grace of God
[53:25] to save that person as it does that
[53:27] other person as far as to open their
[53:29] eyes but when you look at it in terms of
[53:32] how that within Esau Esau was a man that
[53:35] if we can look at it in this measure he
[53:38] had such natural determination the man
[53:41] had such resolute self will he had the
[53:44] ability no doubt to make in a way in one
[53:46] sense of the word his body to obey the
[53:49] word but yet it's not that kind of
[53:51] obedience that God is looking for
[53:53] because if it's still in the heart
[53:55] you're still a sinner it's got to be
[53:57] where you're free from the inside where
[54:00] it's not something that I can't do this
[54:02] I better not do that because if I do
[54:04] this how the Lord will get me and I left
[54:06] if I could just do this but when you're
[54:08] free you're free it's not about what you
[54:11] can't do it so I can't do this but it's
[54:13] a what God has set you free and
[54:16] now it's about what you want to do so
[54:19] when we're looking within these here how
[54:21] that Esau within himself it was much
[54:24] like when you look at it Isaac loved
[54:26] Esau now think of this Isaac loved Esau
[54:29] being that of the natural man but that
[54:32] should not stumble us because the Lord
[54:34] Jesus loved the rich young ruler is that
[54:37] right why did he love the rich young
[54:39] ruler he saw that this young man had
[54:42] such potential within his life he had
[54:45] the ability not because that he was born
[54:47] of the Spirit of God but he had the
[54:49] ability by even natural determination
[54:52] and self-will if you think about how the
[54:54] Prophet tells us in blasphemous names
[54:56] when he talks about the virtues that are
[54:58] a part of our mountain and he talks
[55:00] about those virtues and he says there
[55:02] are people in the natural that can have
[55:04] these virtues he said but that is not
[55:06] the virtues that we're talking about
[55:08] we're talking about the virtues that are
[55:11] birthed in you by the Spirit of God as
[55:14] you continue to grow and the maturing of
[55:16] those virtues moving out of your life by
[55:18] God's own workmanship so when we're
[55:21] looking at these things there are a lot
[55:23] of things and you know when we look at
[55:25] it even among your going to book stores
[55:27] there are bookstores of self-help books
[55:29] books that are done one that are set
[55:31] around for those having great self-will
[55:34] and being able to somehow conjure up a
[55:37] way that would be pleasing to God but
[55:39] you and I know better that there is
[55:41] nothing that we can do that would be
[55:43] pleasing to the Lord within our own self
[55:46] is that right but God Himself knowing
[55:50] that he provides the way that we might
[55:53] be acceptable in his sight so when you
[55:56] see that how that the rich young ruler
[55:58] mahi could you know he could keep all
[56:00] the commandments and the Lord Jesus if
[56:02] he could have called him a liar if he
[56:04] was a liar but he won the liar there
[56:07] right he said I've kept all the
[56:09] commandments from my youth and Jesus
[56:11] admired him but he said one thing thou
[56:15] lackest go sell what you have and give
[56:18] to the poor but Jesus we know was not
[56:21] talking about starting the first
[56:23] Salvation Army or goodwill industries or
[56:25] whatever more but we
[56:26] recognize that what the Lord Jesus was
[56:28] looking at that there was still
[56:30] something that he had that was actually
[56:33] hindering him from receiving what he
[56:36] said he wanted you see Christianity and
[56:39] that of the gospel is truly a free gift
[56:42] but it does not come without a price it
[56:45] does not come without a death we're not
[56:48] just looking at Calvary and what the
[56:51] Lord Jesus done as though it is a
[56:53] covering of sorts but we recognize it is
[56:56] the very provision that has been made
[56:59] for you and I that we can enter into
[57:01] that blood cell by his own life we are
[57:05] baptized in that blood cell to where
[57:08] it's no longer God seeing us he sees the
[57:11] blood that's what the Holy Ghost does a
[57:17] man but here this this rich young ruler
[57:21] he handles all these abilities but he
[57:24] did not have the ability to submit
[57:27] himself he comes in the presence of
[57:30] eternal life but he lacks the ability to
[57:33] surrender kept all the commandments I'd
[57:37] say he's a lovable person wouldn't you
[57:39] come on friends Isaac loved Esau Jesus
[57:44] loved the rich young ruler so you see it
[57:49] doesn't matter even with Isaac loving
[57:51] Esau
[57:51] that couldn't change Esau's destiny even
[57:56] Jesus leaven the rich young ruler that
[57:58] can't change his destiny you see that's
[58:02] why when we look at these things when we
[58:04] keep the word and the things that are
[58:06] said we keep it in light of the word
[58:08] that's why we just don't take the
[58:10] statement where brother random is told
[58:12] all that ever loved you and you love
[58:14] you'll be there with you and thinking of
[58:16] that in terms of just natural terms that
[58:18] well we love brother Branham so we're
[58:21] going to be there rather I don't love
[58:22] this let me tell you something no doubt
[58:24] if you walk down the streets of
[58:25] Jeffersonville there were many people
[58:27] that loved brother Branham when wasn't
[58:30] talking about a natural flesh man we're
[58:33] talking about the spiritual revealed
[58:36] truth
[58:37] we're talking about when he said to
[58:39] receive a profit in the name of a profit
[58:42] the identification of Jesus Christ a man
[58:47] is to fall in love with Jesus Christ
[58:50] routine your friends there can be a lot
[58:52] of people that loved other random and
[58:54] there'll be many left behind in
[58:55] tribulation because this message is not
[58:58] about loving brother Branham in his
[58:59] flesh this message is to fall in love
[59:03] with Jesus Christ and it'll fall in love
[59:05] with Jesus Christ you have the right
[59:07] respect and the right admiration for all
[59:10] of God's people hallelujah here Isaac
[59:20] loved Esau but Jesus Jesus loved the
[59:25] rich young ruler but I want you to look
[59:28] at Rebecca
[59:29] you see it's revealed to Rebecca what's
[59:35] taken place name n notice in verse 29 of
[59:39] Genesis 25 and Jacob Saad pottage and he
[59:44] saw came from the field and he was faint
[59:47] and he saw said to Jacob feed me I pray
[59:51] thee with that same red potage for I am
[59:54] faint therefore was his name called Edom
[59:57] and Jacob said sell me this day that
[1:00:01] birthright and Esau said Behold I'm at
[1:00:05] the point to die and what profit shall
[1:00:08] this birthright do to me and Jacob said
[1:00:12] swear to me this day and he swearing to
[1:00:15] him and he sold his birthright unto
[1:00:17] Jacob then Jacob gave Esau bread and
[1:00:20] pottage of lentils and he did eat and
[1:00:23] drink and rose up and went his way and
[1:00:25] thus Esau despised his birthright the
[1:00:31] blessing itself belonged to he saw there
[1:00:36] was right in his myth he knew about the
[1:00:39] birthright but he could not see the
[1:00:44] value of it he did not value it for what
[1:00:47] it meant they men that very
[1:00:51] right was a plan to passing on of the
[1:00:54] blessing that God had given to Abraham
[1:00:57] amen that blessing was not just mere
[1:01:00] words that blessing was life it was that
[1:01:03] same blessing that Paul speaks in
[1:01:06] Galatians 3 the blessing of Abraham that
[1:01:09] we know to be the Spirit of God moving
[1:01:13] upon that life I want you to think of
[1:01:17] this just for a moment
[1:01:20] God knew even that was in Isaac that the
[1:01:24] birthright was to go to Isaac I'm
[1:01:27] talking about now not not not not not
[1:01:30] here within the scripture when we're
[1:01:32] looking at Jacob and Esau and I want you
[1:01:34] to notice here was Abraham that had to
[1:01:37] take Isaac and the blessing went forth
[1:01:41] over Isaac there was a patriarch of that
[1:01:45] home let's Pelt that blessing now let's
[1:01:49] attach this now the blessing itself
[1:01:51] although that it was reserved as Isaac
[1:01:54] but there had to be that word that
[1:01:57] blessing had to become a word that was
[1:02:01] spoken when Isaac was ready to receive
[1:02:04] it he many was God showing a pipe
[1:02:08] boundary every time it would be the
[1:02:11] patriarch himself coming to pronounce
[1:02:14] the blessing upon his children when it
[1:02:17] was time for them to be born of his
[1:02:19] spirit to receive the blessing of the
[1:02:22] Lord the patriarch was on the scene Amen
[1:02:27] is the same in this as we're looking in
[1:02:30] this case the blessing belongs to the
[1:02:34] bless and when we look at it here in the
[1:02:38] scriptures as we're looking at it now
[1:02:40] and you see how that Isaac loved Esau
[1:02:43] and Rebekah loved Jacob you know it
[1:02:49] would seem like that if anything it
[1:02:52] might seem like it should be the other
[1:02:53] way around but you know Isaac or Esau
[1:02:58] was a good letter Christian come on
[1:03:02] somebody but you see
[1:03:04] letter killeth what is important is to
[1:03:09] have the spirit that gave the letter
[1:03:12] then the spirit will express and live
[1:03:15] the letter through you amen now notice
[1:03:19] within it how that the scriptures go on
[1:03:22] in Genesis 27 verse 1 it said it came to
[1:03:26] pass that when heizak was old and his
[1:03:29] eyes were dim so that he could not see
[1:03:31] he called Esau his eldest son and said
[1:03:36] unto Him my son and he sent unto him
[1:03:38] behold Here I am so Isaac at this time
[1:03:42] when it comes time for the blessing his
[1:03:45] eyes have grown dim remember there's got
[1:03:48] to be some eyes to see where the
[1:03:50] blessing gets to come on somebody
[1:03:52] there's gotta be some eyes on the scene
[1:03:55] that know where the blessing is to get
[1:03:59] to what is Isaac the written word they
[1:04:05] man the word itself but notice how that
[1:04:08] there's got to be spiritual discernment
[1:04:11] to catch when it's time for that word to
[1:04:14] be brought for name n Rebekah don't move
[1:04:19] out ahead of time but the Bible says
[1:04:21] that when Isaac's eyes had got them you
[1:04:23] know let me tell you God is right on
[1:04:25] time running late he ain't early he's
[1:04:33] right on time
[1:04:38] amen right on time here where Isaac's
[1:04:42] eyes were need to become dim but how did
[1:04:46] he Isaac communicating here with Esau he
[1:04:50] said behold now I am old I know not the
[1:04:53] day of my death
[1:04:54] now therefore take I pray thee that
[1:04:57] weapons Rock quiver and I bow and go out
[1:05:01] to the field and take me some venison
[1:05:03] and make me savory meat such as I love
[1:05:06] and bring it to me that I may eat that
[1:05:10] my soul may bless thee before I die now
[1:05:15] you know here is Isaac
[1:05:18] giving direction to Esau of what I want
[1:05:23] you to do that you might receive the
[1:05:25] blessing let me say this clearly we
[1:05:28] understand this that God did not have to
[1:05:31] send a new Bible that's not what God has
[1:05:35] done in this hour but he has made this
[1:05:38] Bible become a new book and as a matter
[1:05:43] of fact down through the ages when God
[1:05:46] has spoke it's been God identifying
[1:05:49] himself in the promise of his word that
[1:05:53] he is given and he identifies himself to
[1:05:56] be the same yesterday today and forever
[1:05:59] amen he had dinner Faiz himself he don't
[1:06:02] have to convince his children that he's
[1:06:05] still the same it's just a part of the
[1:06:07] DNA of who they are with his presence
[1:06:10] Woo's opponent there's a response that
[1:06:12] begins to move inside of him it begins
[1:06:15] to draw him why because they are up his
[1:06:18] loins and when his presence begins to
[1:06:21] move in the media his presence will not
[1:06:23] move apart from his word his presence
[1:06:27] moves with his word are you with me
[1:06:31] jesus said except you are born of the
[1:06:34] water and the spirit
[1:06:37] it takes both to bring a birth the water
[1:06:41] born of the word and the Spirit of God
[1:06:44] making that word alive and real in the
[1:06:48] hearts of the believer
[1:06:49] it becomes what you have been longing
[1:06:53] for and the reason that you've longed
[1:06:55] for it the reason that nothing else
[1:06:58] could satisfy is because God Himself
[1:07:00] placed that desire within you that you
[1:07:03] would desire and you would thirst after
[1:07:06] righteousness and that's why you are
[1:07:08] blessed
[1:07:09] whosoever along event first have the
[1:07:12] righteousness but praise be to God
[1:07:14] you're not just blessed but you are to
[1:07:17] receive the blessing the blessing
[1:07:21] belonging to the blessed God had already
[1:07:27] laid this out concerning Jacob and Esau
[1:07:32] Rebecca I already know it the Holy Ghost
[1:07:34] already knows are you with me yes sir it
[1:07:39] already knows you see it's got to come
[1:07:42] to where the word that God has given a
[1:07:45] person can look into the word and and
[1:07:47] they can look here within certain parts
[1:07:50] of the scripture and they can look at it
[1:07:52] but yet it takes the Holy Spirit coming
[1:07:55] by way of the promise of his word to be
[1:07:58] able to make that word alive and real
[1:08:00] you say what are you talking about by
[1:08:02] the Sanyo I'm talking about from where
[1:08:04] it raises off the printed page to where
[1:08:07] it's not just letter but it becomes a
[1:08:09] habitation it not just a habitation but
[1:08:13] there is an entranceway there that you
[1:08:15] can walk in and become a part of this
[1:08:18] word where it's no longer just a letter
[1:08:20] but it takes on flesh
[1:08:23] [Applause]
[1:08:28] so here esau receives direction from the
[1:08:31] written word being baptized and so forth
[1:08:36] but for Jacob Jacob just doesn't receive
[1:08:41] direction from the written word he
[1:08:44] receives what the Spirit is revealing
[1:08:47] the written word to him what is that
[1:08:51] leadership Esau taking direction by what
[1:08:54] he can read what he knows do this do
[1:08:57] that but here is Jacob now here's Jacob
[1:08:59] Jacob's not even around when this is
[1:09:01] being said Jacob doesn't know but
[1:09:04] Rebekah knows whether it be to God in
[1:09:08] verse 5 that says Henry Becca heard when
[1:09:12] I was expect to Esau his son and he saw
[1:09:15] went to the field to hunt for visit for
[1:09:17] venison and to bring it and Rebekah
[1:09:20] spake unto Jacob her son notice this her
[1:09:24] son who is Rebekah son Jacob will reveal
[1:09:29] God you see friends we just don't want
[1:09:31] to be sons of a written word come on now
[1:09:35] we want to be sentence of the holy
[1:09:38] spirit amen
[1:09:40] sons of God born of his spirit
[1:09:44] not just sons of the flesh come on
[1:09:46] somebody crashes the mystery brother mem
[1:09:48] said many theologians can take this
[1:09:50] Bible and tie you into places why he
[1:09:53] sickos they have known him in the flesh
[1:09:55] right what is that they are fleshly
[1:10:00] Christians but those are not the
[1:10:02] Christians of the promise listen friends
[1:10:04] when you look around and you see people
[1:10:06] on the world and they say I'm a
[1:10:08] Christian don't look at them and say in
[1:10:10] in one sense of the word no you're not
[1:10:12] they might be truly looking to the Lord
[1:10:14] Jesus Christ for all that they know and
[1:10:16] they're looking to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:18] as their Savior but listen to this
[1:10:20] they're not a Christian to the depth of
[1:10:22] the election that God has made known to
[1:10:25] you is that right
[1:10:26] in the message identification 1964 the
[1:10:29] Prophet said that God's thoughts are the
[1:10:32] Christian of today what's he talking
[1:10:34] about the elect then he picks it up
[1:10:36] recognizing your day and it's message
[1:10:37] brother and sister more riding pass pray
[1:10:40] fast very fast pray God's going to send
[1:10:42] a moving revival he said what it is they
[1:10:44] had died by being Christians they feel
[1:10:46] the pull of the hour but by not being
[1:10:49] part of the Bride they don't recognize
[1:10:51] what's taking place are there Christians
[1:10:54] yes even to where that the Prophet could
[1:10:57] say within this when he talks in Hebrews
[1:11:00] chapter 7 part 1 he said you know that
[1:11:02] what himself was a Hebrew surely was
[1:11:06] over there here he was lot himself was a
[1:11:09] Hebrew but you'll never hear in the
[1:11:11] scripture where he will come out and say
[1:11:13] lot the Hebrew but yet he was Hebrew but
[1:11:16] Abraham was that of the depth of
[1:11:19] election the true Hebrew of God you can
[1:11:23] see it's the depth that's why many can
[1:11:25] look at this word and they can rejoice
[1:11:27] over promises but you and I can hear
[1:11:30] this word and it's because our name is
[1:11:32] written in the Lamb's section in that
[1:11:35] which is about Christ
[1:11:37] it's Christ the Lamb declaring himself
[1:11:39] and you and I are a part of that thought
[1:11:45] now does that mean that we go around and
[1:11:48] say whoa cause everybody's Christians
[1:11:49] everybody's going to the rapture no
[1:11:50] that's for the elect
[1:11:53] listen frames the real true baptism of
[1:11:56] the Holy Ghost by way of the new birth
[1:11:57] is for the elect and a lot of times the
[1:12:02] things are said and things are passed
[1:12:04] off as being the new birth but the new
[1:12:06] birth itself can only come through and
[1:12:08] by the word and by the spirit and the
[1:12:10] prints of God bringing a change to where
[1:12:12] the person will reflect Jesus Christ in
[1:12:14] this hour notice it goes on in verse 6
[1:12:20] so what Rebekah heard she spoke unto
[1:12:23] Jacob her son saying behold I heard thy
[1:12:27] father speak unto Esau thy brother
[1:12:29] saying bring me venison and make me
[1:12:32] savory meat that I may eat and bless
[1:12:35] thee before the Lord before my death now
[1:12:38] therefore my son obey my voice according
[1:12:41] to that which I command thee look at
[1:12:44] this
[1:12:44] obey my voice you know what Rebekah
[1:12:47] wretches this is the time she catches
[1:12:51] the seasons and the times she recognizes
[1:12:55] this is the time where the blessing is
[1:12:57] going to be handed out she catches that
[1:13:00] now Esau has already went on he's going
[1:13:03] to get what the written word what Isaac
[1:13:05] has told him to go get but Rebekah huh
[1:13:07] amen a type of the spiritual woman a
[1:13:10] type of the spiritual bride a type of
[1:13:12] the Spirit of God catches what the very
[1:13:15] desire is for the hour are you listening
[1:13:18] it's just like when Esther was called in
[1:13:20] from out in the byways and all the rest
[1:13:22] of the women they received love letters
[1:13:24] justification they came to the Shushan
[1:13:26] palace and as they're there they begin
[1:13:28] to go through the days of purification
[1:13:31] sanctification they're purifying them
[1:13:34] removing all of the stench of the world
[1:13:36] and then they're placing into them the
[1:13:38] great Epocrates of different oils that
[1:13:41] will actually saturate and move into the
[1:13:43] pores so that it would be an aroma when
[1:13:46] they walk in to the night with the king
[1:13:48] but remember every one of them is giving
[1:13:50] an opportunity to decide what they want
[1:13:53] to go in before the king with but Esther
[1:13:56] deferred her choice amen showing she was
[1:14:00] part of retention after Esther she said
[1:14:04] Haga what do you say what does the king
[1:14:07] want and
[1:14:08] and hey God made known to her what the
[1:14:10] King wanted and she went in before the
[1:14:13] king and the King delighted in her she
[1:14:19] knew Rebecca knew this is the time he
[1:14:24] saws busy about all of his business but
[1:14:27] she knew this is the time now notice in
[1:14:30] the scripture here and I want to leave
[1:14:31] this in in John 16 verse 12 notice how
[1:14:34] the Lord Jesus would speak concerning
[1:14:36] that of the Holy Ghost he said I have
[1:14:40] yet many things to say unto you but you
[1:14:43] cannot bear them now so he had many
[1:14:48] things to say unto them but he said
[1:14:51] you're not able to handle this right now
[1:14:56] so the Lord Jesus is mindful that this
[1:14:59] was not the time the things that need to
[1:15:03] be given or even expounded upon this is
[1:15:06] not the time but remember it's him I
[1:15:10] have yet many things to say unto you but
[1:15:12] you cannot bear them now so who is going
[1:15:15] to say it and when will it be said he
[1:15:17] will say it in his time howbeit when he
[1:15:21] the spirit of truth is come he will
[1:15:24] guide you into all truth for he shall
[1:15:27] not speak of himself but whatsoever he
[1:15:29] shall hear that shall he speak and he
[1:15:32] will show you things to come he shall
[1:15:35] glorify me for he shall receive of mine
[1:15:38] and shall show it unto you all things
[1:15:40] that the father has are mine therefore
[1:15:42] said I that he shall take of mine and
[1:15:45] shall show it unto you
[1:15:48] the Lord Jesus is declaring there's not
[1:15:52] an end to his ministry there's not an
[1:15:55] end to him speaking come on somebody you
[1:16:00] see he continued speaking after his
[1:16:02] death of the Bible said he went and
[1:16:04] preached in hell they men he came on
[1:16:09] back up and after a resurrection here he
[1:16:12] is walking among his disciples and he is
[1:16:15] speaking to them things pertaining to
[1:16:18] the kingdom of God then he is received
[1:16:20] upon hi and then he did then he releases
[1:16:23] back into the church his own life and
[1:16:26] his own lot his spirit coming down can
[1:16:29] you find Peter begin to stand up on the
[1:16:32] day of pinnacles and begin to identify
[1:16:34] the season and the time that were living
[1:16:37] it and he identifies the time by the
[1:16:40] prophecy in the word they man the
[1:16:44] children of God we're not ignorant to
[1:16:46] what's going on around us we can see the
[1:16:50] identity of where we are by the word
[1:16:54] amen the Jacob bunch look for the
[1:16:57] identity by the scriptural signs where
[1:17:00] are we at in the word Peter begins to
[1:17:03] turn that key who was that speaking on
[1:17:07] the day of Pentecost Christ hey man he
[1:17:11] calls them to the fulfillment of the
[1:17:13] prophecy come on somebody Peter what
[1:17:16] stand up there that day in reading them
[1:17:18] a text the Bible was not even written at
[1:17:20] that time it was the same Spirit of God
[1:17:24] who was had been moved upon Cornelius
[1:17:27] his heart and Cornelius said I was told
[1:17:30] to sin for a man down there by the name
[1:17:33] of Peter you know the story well notice
[1:17:36] if Courtney listen to me now
[1:17:37] if Cornelius is a seed of God do you
[1:17:39] believe he was then why didn't God just
[1:17:42] give him the Holy Ghost right there why
[1:17:48] didn't God just do it there must come
[1:17:50] through and by the word what word the
[1:17:55] word that is fulfilled the present word
[1:18:00] and notice when he comes into the house
[1:18:03] of Cornelius Cornelius says he says were
[1:18:06] all here he said we're gathered he said
[1:18:09] we're ready to hear words from thee and
[1:18:11] to obey words of what life who was it
[1:18:16] that was speaking Christ I have many
[1:18:19] things yet to say unto you who was it
[1:18:23] that was speaking after the Lord Jesus
[1:18:25] even had went through the communion
[1:18:27] supper even when the Lord Jesus had
[1:18:30] spoke in John 6 and said except to eat
[1:18:32] the flesh of the Son of Man and
[1:18:34] his blood he did not expand on it he did
[1:18:37] not explain it but it was years later
[1:18:40] under the ministry of paul what he said
[1:18:43] I have yet many things for saying to you
[1:18:46] the same Lord Jesus took the world that
[1:18:49] had been given and he expounded on that
[1:18:52] word - who - his believing children
[1:18:54] that's the same thing that the angel of
[1:18:56] the Lord has been doing his doing and
[1:18:59] will continue to do it's the same Holy
[1:19:02] Ghost that gave this message that is
[1:19:04] expounded upon the things that he has
[1:19:07] spoken why were you and I grow repeated
[1:19:13] God that's why the Scriptures could say
[1:19:15] and Paul could sort of permanently
[1:19:16] declare it in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 3
[1:19:18] how he spoke in the in days pass into
[1:19:22] the father's through the prophets but in
[1:19:24] this last days through his son it's the
[1:19:27] same Lord Jesus speaking the same one
[1:19:31] doing the speaking but this is where it
[1:19:39] comes you must have ears to hear what
[1:19:42] the Spirit is saying not eyes to read
[1:19:47] what the Spirit has moved upon others -
[1:19:49] right not even fingers to put it on and
[1:19:55] push play but you must have ears to hear
[1:20:01] where we can't create that that that
[1:20:03] doesn't happen in this church where all
[1:20:05] of a sudden you said here at 10 years
[1:20:07] five years and all of a sudden you're
[1:20:08] endowed with the ability to hear know
[1:20:10] your experiences are not schooled into
[1:20:12] you your experiences are predestinated
[1:20:16] by God we're not schooling people into
[1:20:20] the truth we're not teaching - we're all
[1:20:22] of a sudden they begin to say wow I'll
[1:20:24] tell you what that just makes sense
[1:20:25] that's a knowledge of the truth that's
[1:20:28] not a union I'll pay your friends many
[1:20:31] of the problems right now there's been a
[1:20:33] lot of divorces but not a lot of deaths
[1:20:36] been divorces separating maybe walk in a
[1:20:40] separated life but not a death a divorce
[1:20:43] you can hang them up for the occasion
[1:20:45] come on somebody
[1:20:47] laughter his divorce and he's doubt
[1:20:49] there is no racing of that men again and
[1:20:51] then you can truly be married to Jesus
[1:20:54] Christ the virtuous son of the Living
[1:20:57] God yes sir notice here he is the Lord
[1:21:04] Jesus Christ speaking is the same the
[1:21:07] same Lord in Hebrews chapter 2 verse 11
[1:21:09] for both he but Saint the bath and they
[1:21:12] who are sanctified are all of one for
[1:21:14] which calls he is not ashamed to call
[1:21:16] them brethren saying I will declare thy
[1:21:18] name unto my brethren in the midst of
[1:21:21] the church will I sing praise I will
[1:21:26] declare thy name unto my brother thy
[1:21:33] name his life his character his nature
[1:21:38] who will I will personally declare it to
[1:21:42] who to my brother
[1:21:45] notice in the seven churches 1954 we're
[1:21:49] referring to revelations chapter 1 he
[1:21:52] said now notice here in the midst of the
[1:21:55] seven golden candlesticks one like the
[1:21:58] Son of man what one like him who was
[1:22:01] this his bride one like him watch how it
[1:22:05] was clothed with the garment down to the
[1:22:08] foot the holiness of Jesus Christ
[1:22:10] covering her has washed her from her own
[1:22:13] sins with his own blood Girt about the
[1:22:16] paps not a man a woman with a golden
[1:22:21] girdle the gospel that held the power
[1:22:23] and glory of God over the body of Christ
[1:22:27] I want you to watch this very carefully
[1:22:29] here because we know that we know that
[1:22:32] there is the spirit of how that
[1:22:34] everything would run so close to where
[1:22:36] it would be as though that it would make
[1:22:38] and in in the church themselves says
[1:22:40] well we have the power to give life and
[1:22:42] we have the power you know to forgive
[1:22:44] and we have the power to do this but the
[1:22:46] church in and of its own accord does not
[1:22:49] have any ability to bring any birth the
[1:22:52] church does not have the power to
[1:22:54] forgive sin there's only one who can
[1:22:57] forgive sin and that is the Lord Jesus
[1:22:59] Christ
[1:23:00] only one that can feel you with the Holy
[1:23:02] Ghost and that's the Holy Ghost Himself
[1:23:05] the Lord our church cannot do it listen
[1:23:07] to him and how a perfect can I'll do it
[1:23:09] I just heard brother MC here just the
[1:23:11] other day hearing recognizing a cue in
[1:23:13] the word he said you come up here when
[1:23:15] the Spirit of God is moving I can't feel
[1:23:17] you but he is the one who can do it in
[1:23:20] the message birth pains 1965 he said I
[1:23:23] wish that I can do it for people but I
[1:23:25] can't why because you know that that is
[1:23:30] the answer so to think of this here of
[1:23:34] how that it must be him because if you
[1:23:38] look in the scriptures when it speaks
[1:23:39] speaks of in the time of job he talks of
[1:23:43] he that's born of a woman is a few days
[1:23:45] old and full of trouble let me tell you
[1:23:47] something he that's got just a church
[1:23:48] life is a few days old and full of
[1:23:50] trouble come on he's just born just to
[1:23:53] the flesh of this message is a few days
[1:23:55] old and full of trouble come on friends
[1:23:57] I'm talking about being born of the
[1:23:59] Spirit of God when I look and talk about
[1:24:01] the term message I do not talk about
[1:24:03] written words I'm looking at the message
[1:24:06] is Christ
[1:24:07] it is the very one who's been sealed
[1:24:09] within the word and steps forth we're
[1:24:12] not children of the flesh we are
[1:24:14] children of the promise by the Holy
[1:24:17] Ghost glory be to God when the Prophet
[1:24:23] went beyond the curtain of paths he said
[1:24:24] are these all branham's no who are they
[1:24:28] they're your people people those who
[1:24:32] come under that revelation of Jesus
[1:24:35] Christ
[1:24:36] any man those who are born of the Spirit
[1:24:40] of God so we look at this here even in
[1:24:43] the scripture because it says whosoever
[1:24:45] is born of a woman is a few days old and
[1:24:47] full of trouble so recognize that the
[1:24:49] church apart from Christ himself in the
[1:24:52] midst of that church walking in the
[1:24:54] midst of the seven golden candlesticks
[1:24:56] apart from Christ there is no true
[1:24:59] impartation of life but because he's in
[1:25:04] the midst he's the way he's the truth
[1:25:08] he's the life in the Garden of Eden
[1:25:11] there were two trees set forth for birth
[1:25:13] purposes
[1:25:14] is that right tree of life then you have
[1:25:17] the woman tree - those two trees right
[1:25:20] there I know three of knowledge of good
[1:25:21] and evil but I'm talking about the two
[1:25:23] set forth for birth the Tree of Life and
[1:25:25] that's in the woman tree you isn't it
[1:25:27] out but here within it rule is it that
[1:25:30] really brings the birth to the children
[1:25:32] of God
[1:25:33] it's the Tree of Life if we're born just
[1:25:35] to the woman it dies it fizzles it's
[1:25:38] just like our first birth
[1:25:39] it grows any there's no way you can hold
[1:25:41] but when we are born of the Spirit of
[1:25:44] God it's an anchor that holds within our
[1:25:47] lives as a matter of fact that's why
[1:25:49] Paul could say picking up from thinking
[1:25:52] about over him in the Book of
[1:25:53] Revelations 21 where John saw that New
[1:25:57] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:26:00] heaven has a bride adorned for her
[1:26:02] husband there right and Paul begins to
[1:26:05] declare in the book of Galatians that I
[1:26:08] headquarters that where we are born of
[1:26:11] is that mujra New Jerusalem which is
[1:26:13] from above she is a mother of us all
[1:26:17] come on somebody
[1:26:19] amen Mel Olivia so here we find that
[1:26:24] that true real spiritual bride but Jesus
[1:26:27] Christ
[1:26:27] she is the life of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:31] hey man there's all kinds of birth
[1:26:34] that's coming forward there's churches
[1:26:36] giving birth just some types of things
[1:26:38] that's coming forward but the real
[1:26:40] spiritual pride of Jesus Christ is
[1:26:43] bringing for children that are solid
[1:26:46] upon the water is the Spirit of God
[1:26:48] that's moving in her mist because she
[1:26:51] can't birth them it takes him the
[1:26:54] Shepherd to birth the Lambs Amen
[1:26:59] hallelujah when he comes on the scene he
[1:27:03] has everything that is needed to release
[1:27:05] the victory to release the birth to
[1:27:08] release the blessing whoa he came not
[1:27:13] only to bring a blessing he came to be
[1:27:16] the blessing
[1:27:19] hallelujah this is where the scripture
[1:27:22] it is it is given to us it stands over
[1:27:26] and over even in the prophets ministry
[1:27:29] it's not just a scripture that's given
[1:27:31] out just as a cliche never let us never
[1:27:34] take things that way when he says that
[1:27:36] right now we ought to be a harmony
[1:27:38] between the bride and Christ such a
[1:27:41] harmony of John 5:19 that whatsoever the
[1:27:44] son see at the father doing that do it
[1:27:47] the fun like life amen and the father
[1:27:51] loveth the son and he shows him things
[1:27:55] let me tell you about the Holy Ghost it
[1:28:00] would not be possible without the Spirit
[1:28:04] of God given eyesight revealing the word
[1:28:07] to us we go right over it I hope this
[1:28:12] don't bother you but there's a lot of
[1:28:15] things when you look at how God is
[1:28:17] laying in his word service after service
[1:28:20] day after day as you're giving yourself
[1:28:23] what's God doing he's laying all his
[1:28:27] word in you see it's like a house if
[1:28:32] your house you want electricity you got
[1:28:35] to put wiring in it I don't care how
[1:28:39] much electricity they can bring to your
[1:28:40] box if you don't got the right wiring in
[1:28:43] your house I don't care how much is on
[1:28:44] tap you're not going to benefit from it
[1:28:48] being on tap you only benefit when it
[1:28:50] gets in your house and the Word of God
[1:28:53] when the word is coming forth there's a
[1:28:56] lot of wiring that goes on oh yes sir we
[1:28:59] believe that the Holy Spirit had come
[1:29:00] down and moved right through the wife we
[1:29:02] want him to do that but there's some
[1:29:04] times where he's got to come and
[1:29:06] straighten wires out where they're
[1:29:07] shorts that come about there's grounds
[1:29:10] that come about and he has to come and
[1:29:12] deal with those things why that the
[1:29:13] current might flow I'll tell you I got
[1:29:17] to thinking about it today how that
[1:29:19] Thomas Edison you know he would trying
[1:29:21] to find that filament that was needed
[1:29:22] for the ball he tried all sorts of
[1:29:25] things he tried all kinds of material
[1:29:27] eventually he got that of a horsehair he
[1:29:30] I can't remember the alloy or the metal
[1:29:32] he dipped it in but he dipped it in
[1:29:34] there he put that in there and that
[1:29:36] electric that was invisible it was able
[1:29:39] to harness that electric and light up
[1:29:41] the room it was an ordinary horsehair
[1:29:44] but it had the alloy on it that was able
[1:29:46] to handle the electricity and bring what
[1:29:49] was invisible to life let me tell you
[1:29:51] inside of a real child of God there lays
[1:29:54] the necessary filaments that are desired
[1:29:57] for this hour in this age and the Spirit
[1:30:00] of God moving opponent as you're
[1:30:02] immersed into the alloy of God's
[1:30:04] precious metal it begins to light up the
[1:30:07] way that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:30:09] yesterday today forever ye are the light
[1:30:12] of the world
[1:30:18] look how Rebecca says in verse 9 of
[1:30:21] Genesis 27
[1:30:22] she tells Jacob go now to the flock and
[1:30:30] fetch me from thence two good kids of
[1:30:35] the goats and I will make them savoury
[1:30:38] meat for thy father such as he loveth he
[1:30:42] saw had to go way out in the field and
[1:30:43] get what he had but Rebekah says what
[1:30:46] you need is already provided but you got
[1:30:48] to go get it
[1:30:50] Rebekah let him know what is here under
[1:30:54] your nose go get why because Rebekah has
[1:30:58] heard what Isaac is saying and Rebekah
[1:31:01] what she has read she shall not speak of
[1:31:03] herself she revealing to Jacob this is
[1:31:06] what you need to do but remember it's
[1:31:09] not that of the woman tree its Christ
[1:31:11] himself in the midst of his bride
[1:31:14] hallelujah it is Christ revealing
[1:31:17] himself Saint Jesus in brought forth a
[1:31:20] man he tells her he let he let see she
[1:31:24] loves Jacob no and he said she says and
[1:31:27] thou shalt bring it to thy father and he
[1:31:29] that he may eat that he may bless thee
[1:31:31] before his death
[1:31:33] now when you you know you think of it
[1:31:36] like with Jacob you know Jacob here he
[1:31:38] is he's we read in the scriptures in
[1:31:41] John 9 it
[1:31:43] for Dean rock his predestinate is the
[1:31:48] Bible just said that the purpose might
[1:31:49] stand according to election but it ain't
[1:31:52] just something that he's just gonna walk
[1:31:54] right into it's the same thing that took
[1:31:58] place in Genesis 1 God speaks the Spirit
[1:32:04] of God begins to move and do what give
[1:32:06] direction to Jacob what it's God's
[1:32:11] promised that I will show into these a
[1:32:13] path of life it's calling Jacob into
[1:32:17] this place you know it might seem like
[1:32:20] that you know when we look at things
[1:32:21] within that of even the election
[1:32:24] sometimes it's just like that it doesn't
[1:32:27] mean that it's not going to come without
[1:32:29] labor right just like we looked at that
[1:32:34] in one one Thursday some months ago the
[1:32:36] gift is a free gift they're right not of
[1:32:39] works lest any man should boast it's a
[1:32:41] free gift but yet that same free gift is
[1:32:44] the same free gift that Paul says in
[1:32:46] Hebrews for labor to enter into it's the
[1:32:50] same thing that Jesus could say labor
[1:32:52] not for meat that perishes but labor for
[1:32:54] that which endureth unto eternal life so
[1:32:58] what is the labor is the labor
[1:32:59] self-effort in works
[1:33:01] no the labor is yielding hearing what
[1:33:04] the Spirit is saying and yielding in
[1:33:06] obedience to it
[1:33:08] that's the laboring not waiting on
[1:33:10] something to come to you you move to it
[1:33:13] come on somebody remember who I knew I
[1:33:15] don't think talking about here in the
[1:33:17] beginning the service it's time to move
[1:33:19] when it's time to move it's not just
[1:33:26] something that is worked up and just
[1:33:28] well you know this this might be the
[1:33:29] time and no it's not a work up it's God
[1:33:32] himself come sovereignly coming and
[1:33:34] making known this is the time all of
[1:33:38] this time think about this here is Esau
[1:33:40] out there hunting for the game and all
[1:33:43] the same time Jacob is being led on what
[1:33:48] to do he's already bought the birthright
[1:33:52] is that right
[1:33:53] but yet he still is not
[1:33:56] receive of the blessing pronounced on
[1:33:59] him so here Rebecca continues to talk to
[1:34:03] him and you know Rebecca says repent and
[1:34:06] be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:34:08] for the remission of your sins oh no
[1:34:11] that was Peter on the day of Pentecost
[1:34:13] but you see it's the same leadership of
[1:34:16] the Holy Spirit come into the Jacob
[1:34:19] Bunch
[1:34:20] are you with me in hell and Jacob said
[1:34:23] to Rebekah his mother behold Esau my
[1:34:26] brother is a hairy man and I'm a smooth
[1:34:29] man
[1:34:29] my father peradventure will feel me and
[1:34:32] I shall seem to him as a deceiver and I
[1:34:34] shall bring a curse upon me and not a
[1:34:36] blessing and his mother said unto him
[1:34:39] upon me be thy curse my son only obey my
[1:34:43] voice
[1:34:44] and go fetch me them notice a prayer a
[1:34:48] surety the Holy Ghost brings full
[1:34:53] assurance that the atonement is
[1:34:56] effectual your curse beyond me that's
[1:35:04] what the Holy Ghost when it moves on the
[1:35:06] heart he'll let you know I came down
[1:35:08] from glory for you I went to Calvary for
[1:35:12] you I'd die for you I shed my blood for
[1:35:15] you I rose for him I came back for you
[1:35:21] your curse beyond me hallelujah only
[1:35:30] obey my voice and go fetch me then and
[1:35:34] he went and fetched and brought them to
[1:35:38] his mother and his mother made savory
[1:35:41] meat such as his father loved and
[1:35:44] Rebekah took goodly raiment of her
[1:35:47] eldest son Esau which were with her in
[1:35:51] the house and put up up on Jacob her
[1:35:54] younger son and she put the skins of the
[1:35:57] kids of the goats upon his hands and
[1:36:00] upon the smooth of his neck and she gave
[1:36:04] the savoury meat and the bread which she
[1:36:07] had prepared
[1:36:09] into the hand of her son Jacob Rebecca
[1:36:17] knew what Isaac liked she knew the right
[1:36:22] balance of the spices why because
[1:36:28] Rebecca was acquainted with the shekel
[1:36:30] of the sanctuary she knew she had the
[1:36:33] right measuring tool she knew just how
[1:36:37] much of this instance how much of this
[1:36:39] spice how much of this she knew just how
[1:36:42] much was needed and then she'd hear he
[1:36:47] brings it to her and she prepares it and
[1:36:50] puts it back in his hands and says now
[1:36:54] you go in before him Jacob didn't look
[1:36:57] at her and say I won't wear that what
[1:37:00] all while we're goat skins for what I he
[1:37:03] didn't care
[1:37:04] it didn't matter to Jacob what he had to
[1:37:07] do to get the birthright
[1:37:11] it didn't matter he didn't matter
[1:37:14] his flesh or his left might have been
[1:37:16] trouble but notice what is working the
[1:37:18] timing of the Lord is moving on his life
[1:37:21] to where he's not caring about wearing
[1:37:24] something goats goat hair all over him
[1:37:26] upon the smooth of his neck he's not
[1:37:28] worried about that at all because it's
[1:37:30] the timing that he's moving in at that
[1:37:32] time the Spirit of God is upon him
[1:37:36] calling him to the place of life can I
[1:37:41] go just a few more places
[1:37:43] watch this here in the scripture how
[1:37:46] then when you look at it in verse 18 he
[1:37:48] came unto his father and said My father
[1:37:50] he said Here I am who art thou my son
[1:37:53] and Jacob said unto his father I am Esau
[1:37:57] by first morning I have done according
[1:38:00] as thou badest me arise I pray thee sit
[1:38:03] and eat of my venison that thy soul may
[1:38:07] bless me and Isaac said unto his son how
[1:38:11] is it that thou has found it so quickly
[1:38:13] my son all of this he said because the
[1:38:16] LORD thy God brought it to me
[1:38:20] amen what is Jacob realizing I wouldn't
[1:38:24] pass it will pass me right back you
[1:38:27] wanna pass right by me
[1:38:29] but Rebecca my mother said hey son this
[1:38:32] is your day this is your time this is
[1:38:35] your message this is your hour this is a
[1:38:39] time of blessing the Lord thy God have
[1:38:42] brought it to me right in the presence
[1:38:46] of God here is Jacob is saying the LORD
[1:38:50] thy God and brought it to me and Isaac
[1:38:57] said unto Jacob come near I pray thee
[1:38:59] that I may feel thee my side whether
[1:39:02] thou be my very son Esau or not and
[1:39:05] Jacob went near unto Isaac his father
[1:39:06] and he felled him and said the voice
[1:39:09] his Jacob's voice but the hands are the
[1:39:14] hands of his so he went into the
[1:39:19] presence of God he saw here
[1:39:22] but Jacob down here Helena in the
[1:39:27] presence of God here was all that of the
[1:39:29] Esau first birth but down only inside
[1:39:32] was taken that which was truly the first
[1:39:35] born of God
[1:39:37] all my brothers sister his placement in
[1:39:40] life was against him every pain was
[1:39:43] against him in this life but he no
[1:39:45] matter what everything in life is
[1:39:47] against you it matters is God for you if
[1:39:51] God is for you who can be against you
[1:39:56] the Lord God have brought it to me and
[1:40:03] he discerned him not because his hands
[1:40:07] were here he has his brother Esau his
[1:40:10] hands so he blessed him so he really
[1:40:15] wasn't blessing Esau he was blessing
[1:40:18] Jacob the blessing of the Lord belongs
[1:40:28] lest let's just stop here tonight
[1:40:36] was it easy
[1:40:38] no even up to this point of what was
[1:40:42] stopped tonight how God goes on to speak
[1:40:46] for Isaac Jacob to think of how that God
[1:40:53] even in the midst of this time is
[1:40:55] uttering through the very lips of Isaac
[1:40:58] the very blessing upon Jacob let me read
[1:41:06] verse 27 he came near him and kissed him
[1:41:09] he smelled the smell of his raiment and
[1:41:12] blessed him and said see the smell of my
[1:41:14] son is as the smell of a field which the
[1:41:16] Lord had blessed therefore God give thee
[1:41:19] of the dew of heaven and the fatness of
[1:41:22] the earth and plenty of corn and wine
[1:41:26] let people serve the ination bow down to
[1:41:29] thee the Lord over thy brother let thy
[1:41:32] mother sons bow to thee cursed be
[1:41:35] everyone that curseth thee and blessed
[1:41:38] be he that blessed thee these are the
[1:41:42] same words that the Lord uh turd to
[1:41:44] Abram when he was down in the earth
[1:41:46] Caddy's I believe with all of my heart
[1:41:49] this was not just Isaac speaking but the
[1:41:52] spirit of a God had moved down at this
[1:41:54] time he borrowed Isaac's mouth but he
[1:41:56] was the same Lord God who was he
[1:41:58] speaking to is in that it wasn't
[1:42:03] something that was handed to Jacob it
[1:42:05] wasn't something that came easy but
[1:42:09] because Jacob was a part of it here he
[1:42:12] is he's able to be moved are they're
[1:42:15] fierce and trepidations I just read to
[1:42:17] you there was what if I go in there and
[1:42:19] he's he begins to feel me I'm not like
[1:42:21] he saw and instead of being blessed I'll
[1:42:23] be cursed but remember when you're being
[1:42:27] bitten by the Spirit of God it's the
[1:42:30] greatest time in the world to come but
[1:42:33] come in the clothing of his word his
[1:42:36] presence inviting you in I think of it
[1:42:40] tonight
[1:42:41] I think like when we look at their that
[1:42:44] little - the pool the Bible calls it the
[1:42:47] pool that was there by the Sheep the
[1:42:50] Sheep gate and it talks about how that
[1:42:52] at a certain season the water was
[1:42:55] troubled at a certain season but all of
[1:42:58] them were gathered around there waiting
[1:43:00] for the angel to come down in trouble
[1:43:03] the water here was that man who was
[1:43:06] laying there been laying there for years
[1:43:11] they pulled the festive here comes down
[1:43:15] the Lord Jesus he comes down and he
[1:43:18] begins to talk to that man you know it's
[1:43:22] like how brother bantam tells us he said
[1:43:23] many times he said we get compassion
[1:43:26] confused with sympathy he said our human
[1:43:29] sympathy would have healed everybody and
[1:43:31] felt sorry for everybody he said but
[1:43:33] that compassion was drawn to the one
[1:43:35] that it was sent for and here when he
[1:43:40] asked this gentleman this question this
[1:43:42] man he asked him a question this
[1:43:47] condition or as far as why that you know
[1:43:50] he's not able and notice what this what
[1:43:53] this man says he said when it is
[1:43:55] troubled I have no man who can carry me
[1:44:00] there he knew he needed someone with
[1:44:04] more strength than he had that's why he
[1:44:08] was still laying there by that pool
[1:44:10] trusting season after season he was
[1:44:13] going to get well season after season he
[1:44:17] was going to get no glassing or my he
[1:44:20] waited there for years but he waited
[1:44:22] there because he knew that was a place
[1:44:25] the blessing was going to come and the
[1:44:29] Lord God lifted him not by his physical
[1:44:33] arms but he lifted him by his word take
[1:44:39] up that bed and walk and the man
[1:44:41] immediately arose and took up his bed
[1:44:44] let me tell you he was lighting on the
[1:44:46] waters to be troubled but the one who
[1:44:49] had sent the angel was the one who was
[1:44:51] present he was that
[1:44:53] travel the water he was there it was the
[1:44:57] season for him to move into the water of
[1:45:00] the word I'll tell your brother and
[1:45:04] sister tonight is the season to move in
[1:45:06] tonight is the season tonight is the
[1:45:10] night to be born of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:11] tonight is the night to repent
[1:45:14] tonight is immaculee aside every weight
[1:45:16] and every sin that does Elisaveta
[1:45:18] tonight is the night to receive your
[1:45:21] healing tonight is the night to receive
[1:45:23] your deliverance the waters troubled
[1:45:28] amen by the man Christ Jesus traveled to
[1:45:33] do I release the virtue that you need so
[1:45:39] then how you came in
[1:45:41] you leave different you might have been
[1:45:44] on a better depression a better oh me oh
[1:45:47] my
[1:45:48] but God Himself is letting you know that
[1:45:51] you don't have to stay on that bed he's
[1:45:54] lifting you by way of your word of his
[1:45:57] word what do I have to do you have to
[1:45:59] say tonight is my night this is my
[1:46:03] season this is the season of The Lord's
[1:46:05] visitation to my heart what do I do

[1:46:34] different voice that's a voice that's
[1:46:36] contrary to the voice of God don't pay

[1:57:23] and reality of this message could pass
[1:57:27] right on by the more Jesus were thanks
[1:57:34] we're thankful one I realize oh my god
[1:57:39] this message it's you it's sent to make
[1:57:47] known to us who we are the message Lord
[1:57:52] we know it's not the letters of the
[1:57:55] message is the person of Christ moving
[1:58:01] Lord in the South drawing us to yourself

[1:58:13] requests of each and every one of your
[1:58:15] children

[1:58:27] no I think of that in the scripture God
[1:58:37] promised said unto Jacob that the dew of
[1:58:42] heaven your portion there's times that
[1:58:49] no doubt we all like rain there right we
[1:58:55] all agree and we had some rain here this
[1:58:58] past week I thank the Lord for it but
[1:59:02] there's also do now Badu itself you
[1:59:09] never hear the dew fall you never even
[1:59:14] hear the do when it's going back up in
[1:59:15] here it's a secret coming and a secret
[1:59:20] going are you with me
[1:59:22] brother Ram tells us he said of this
[1:59:24] upon this earth he said this day there's
[1:59:27] been millions of gallons of water that
[1:59:29] has went right back up and nobody heard
[1:59:32] it wasn't it was water
[1:59:36] it was dude but because it didn't come
[1:59:39] with a great khali bush and the rain
[1:59:42] pounding down you can kind of look at
[1:59:46] and say well it just do let me tell you
[1:59:49] something that dude is a promise just as
[1:59:56] much as we need the rains we need to do
[2:00:03] aren't you thinking
[2:00:05] don't ever despise the dude
[2:00:08] we rejoice we think God for the rain and
[2:00:11] let us also rejoice him to do because
[2:00:14] when God blackened his presence in unity
[2:00:17] you spoke of the dew of her mother you
[2:00:23] do is a very precious thing inside just
[2:00:30] like in your life you realize Madhu
[2:00:32] tells the story of your material
[2:00:36] you don't hear it you don't necessarily
[2:00:40] even see the effects of the do state
[2:00:47] what's it doing it's mature
[2:00:55] aren't you glad that you have ears to
[2:00:58] hear nice you're glad that the Holy
[2:01:01] Spirit and speech team but you're glad
[2:01:04] to lead you
[2:01:05] God you aren't you thankful that the
[2:01:08] message is not just words aren't you
[2:01:10] grateful that the scripture is not just
[2:01:12] words but it's alive its life its life
[2:01:17] yes meaning its leadership to our lives
[2:01:23] you know it's times when you've had to
[2:01:28] put things together I've had to put
[2:01:29] things together there's some times
[2:01:31] they've given me things with manuals
[2:01:32] sometimes I do I'll go ahead and read
[2:01:35] I'll look through the manuals sometimes
[2:01:36] I cannot really not for the life me I
[2:01:38] cannot understand sometimes the manual I
[2:01:40] look at and think they surely left out
[2:01:43] one step they surely left something out
[2:01:45] what that where is it at what I'm
[2:01:50] grateful for is we're not left with a
[2:01:53] manual
[2:01:55] but the chief mechanic the author
[2:01:59] himself knows just how every piece
[2:02:05] Gilles together no doubt that mechanic
[2:02:09] looking over that open hood that not
[2:02:11] know now he was frustrated don't know
[2:02:14] what I'm talking about whether you're
[2:02:15] honest or not no doubt he got
[2:02:18] frustrating was trying his best to make
[2:02:20] those things work but here this chief
[2:02:21] mechanic comes up and they don't look
[2:02:24] like a chief mechanic in this guy's eyes
[2:02:28] but what lets it be known that this
[2:02:30] guy's a chief mechanic what he says
[2:02:34] happens try to move this move this move
[2:02:40] this and move this what does it do it
[2:02:42] brings the engine to the right condition
[2:02:47] so it didn't matter what he was dressed
[2:02:49] in understand what he was dressed in is
