seated just for a moment when just say we just appreciate the Lord so much I didn't want to keep you standing very long we'll go right into the word here in just a moment when we Lord willing when whenever we finish here this morning then we'll have a little bit better of a time when the worship and testimony service for this evening and just certainly looking forward to that I just really believe with all my heart I I feel that it to be of the Lord you know if you don't it's important to testify of what God has done in your life and nobody can tell it like you can other people get excited about your testimony but no one can tell it like you can and remember that it's a benefit and it's a blessing for the entire body of Jesus Christ don't ever underestimate any testimony and what God has done because the reality is it's what he has done and we need to I believe that we need to give him honor and glory we need to bring peace offerings we need to bring offerings of Thanksgiving as I said in the email we don't want to be like the lepers nine of them that went their own way and they just they David they just you know came they got their healing and then they just left but there was one who went on it gripped him and he turned back around and he came back and he said thank you thank you he came back to worship him and I believe that was on my heart that we have much to be thankful for I'd like to start to speak on that a little this morning and we're just I want to say you know words itself cannot express from my heart what it means when the meetings that are had and then to see the vision and the burden and I I'd just be very honest with you I never seen anything going and becoming a yearly thing that's not what I've ER I and I didn't even envision that it was just the Lord dropped you remember the first meetings were brother cadre digs that was just what God dropped on my heart for that time but since that time I just have felt just such a such a burden and an urgency and I'll just say it to you like this there's no way that it could be possible and done if it were not for each and every one of you there's different ones that are behind the scene different brothers and sisters as is expressed there in the email many of you who sacrificed and you gave maybe you didn't cook but you gave and then others of you who cooked and then two different brothers and sisters who were setting up right out there so that when we came out of the service on Saturday that all of that would be possible for us to go into and names itself would just fail to even be able to call I tried to gather all the different names and I just wasn't able to do that but I know different ones that had did that and I'll say it to you like this right here there's no way that it could have been done without your support for the vision and the burden that God has given there's no way it could be done and you know something when things itself when God dropped something on my heart you know even as times in the past I would ask questions even when we did the marriage banquets and I would get together those who were putting that together and I just asked them how do you feel do you feel you have the strength you feel you have that to continue with in this because it's not anything that I can do I can't bring it I can't bring it all together and I but I want to say that's why we're a body and how beautiful is the body of Jesus Christ because every little thing that that has been done it's not been absent in the sight of Almighty God and we're just we're thankful and I'll say it like this even beyond even with all of that that has been prepared in the natural how much went into these services all your prayers the fasting say brother Sam no it would have happened anyway no it wouldn't it wouldn't brother Tim Humes did not bring these services in his briefcase you'll see a little bit this morning if it was not for hearts that were desiring to see God move God would have never moved but I believe that God you see these are things that we we battle even within our humanity you come out of we come out of the week of services and those three services it was necessary to have a focus of what God would do but remember what God has done you take that spiritual traction and let it propel you onward into the heights of Almighty God sure you're probably now some of you even by the time Thursday rolled around you started feeling the effects in your physical body of where you were standing in eternity you see our bodies were not built for this that's why our bodies that's another reason we're going to be changed you know why we're here in these physical bodies we get tired and you know after you've come down out of the services like that and you know sometimes by the time you know you start you start coming in on Wednesday and Thursday finally and you think my why do I just fill you know you're gonna know you were tired but why do I feel like I do well your body here we word dwelling even though in this building but we moved out of this address we were out of this address we were sitting in heavenly places and what we received in heavenly places it is in effect upon our lives I say God is so good he is so good I I don't even feel like I've got word I got to going around and maybe I told you this already but I got to going around the house like a lot of times in the or you know in the early morning and looking just at the plants and I like to look and see if my blossoms and things like that and I was going around I just got to thinking about the goodness of God what God has done and I think I had a spell coming around that backyard now that really ain't anything new for me but boy it was good to have a fresh experience oh my whether I was looking for blossoms on my roses but there was something that it's so blossomed in my heart I was just oh my taint I lost my I was losing myself and all of a sudden I come around the patio and I see my neighbor's standing on the other side I thought he's not gonna understand this what what language is he saying but God is so good I think God has taught I've said it like this God has taught us so much within these services and I believe that we're constantly as believers growing and we're learning spiritually God has taken these things where we always talk about you get what you what you expect but you see God has brought that to a level of expectation we we see that we recognize you realize that that you have control over these services and what I mean by that is is you're praying you're calling out to God Lord come and meet us here Lord there's a need within my life whatever that need is maybe it's a need for somebody's not even gathered here but you realize you are that point of contact you are one who can stand in for them where lot was down there in Sodom but Abraham was an intercessor when the judgement was upon all the wise men and he in in in in Babylon Daniel was one who could stand there and say don't be hasty let's go to God and let's ask for the mercies God amen God has us here Esther for such a time as this hallelujah did you look at the bottom of your shoes this week do you see Haman's name on there we better get preaching or we won't go anywhere I'm just happy aren't you I'm just so thankful to the Lord I I'll tell you what it's it's tremendous what a refilling of the Holy Ghost will do for you you know I'll tell you it just really God is so good he's so good well we just love you this morning and I just trust that the Lord will help us as we look into the word and I don't think there's anything else I'm forgetting here I want to welcome Darrell Louis's brother Danny's brother and his wife and God bless you this morning amen like to welcome Eddie back there that and I was calling you Eddie the cabinet maker but that's why I know you by the trade so glad to have you here amen [Applause] Samuel wonderful name sister Caroline's brother brother monocles one of his sons brother Samuel God bless you good to have you here with us of course it's brother Ray's brother-in-law but we understand that Samuel understand but we just we're happy in the Lord aren't we you know and well let's just go into the word I can talk to you from now to evening but let's go into the word if we could god bless you thank you for the musicians and I that's when something I did forget the musicians they are here for each one of those services and playing and playing and then in that you know in that service the latter service here the last service I tell you what they just kept playing they kept playing Amen how many of you appreciate musicians that are yielded to the Lord amen I appreciate that with all my heart amen well let's look here Psalms 118 verse 1 I'm going to read just a couple verses out of Psalms 118 and and then we'll let you have your seats here Psalms 118 verse 1 should have been in the Dropbox it's okay it's no problem at all we got our Bibles psalms 118 verse 1 o give thanks unto the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever now let's go to verse 19 open to me the gates of righteousness and I will go into them and I will praise the Lord this gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter I will praise thee for thou has heard me and art become my salvation the stone which the builders refused is become the headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes this is the day which the LORD hath made we will rejoice and be glad in it save now I beseech thee O Lord o lord I beseech thee sin now prosperity blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord God is the Lord which hath showed us light bind the sacrifice with cords even unto the horns of the altar thou art my god and I will praise thee thou art my god I will exalt thee can you read verse 29 with me let's go all give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth for ever amen licious bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we are truly standing this morning Lord on holy ground God your presence Lord hear Lord to move among us Lord and to speak to our hearts and and do only that Lord which you are able to do and spresso bring your word Lord Father may it find place in our hearts o God and we just ask that you'll take control Lord and the service receiving all honor glory to yourself now in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless you as you're being seated turn with me one more place in the scripture in Luke 15 turn with me to Luke 15 and we just want to I just want to pick pick up here in Luke 15 on verse 20 and to read just a few verses here scripture and he arose and came to his father when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto him father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and AM no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry now notice the direction who's giving these directions the father the father said bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found and they begin to be merry now let's go here this is where I want to kind of draw from here a little bit this morning verse 25 now his elder son was in the field and as he came and drew nigh to the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant nah he's got a problem with music and dancing he caught us what does this mean and that's what I'd like to try to speak this morning a little bit what mean is this what meaneth this I'm not talking about something 2,000 years ago but I'm talking about the effects of what took place 2,000 years ago being manifested in our lives in our myths I'm not even talking about something clear back in 1963 or 1965 I'm talking about what God has done in our midst in our lives this day even that of last week and this week what meaneth this and with going along with that I would like to say also if I can have a little bit of room brother Brian on the title this is the Lord's doing you see every image you say it like this every spiritual happening that takes place every spiritual happening it hidden it is to be interpreted by the scripture when you you consider when God sent Moses down to Egypt he revealed himself to Moses by the promise through the promise and now that promise was working itself in Moses life and it would then be that to think when the people were down there in in Egypt now remember they were down there for 400 over 400 years but the Bible tells us that God began to hear the cries of the people now it wasn't that they hadn't been praying I believe they probably were praying but you know their prayers where you know maybe Lord give me a better task Master Lord lord help me and give me strength today so I can make the bricks but all of a sudden the prayers with the time the Bible says in the process of time all of a sudden their prayers became different the prayers began got to a place where I'm tired of being down here in Egypt you see that had to be a longing reach in their heart that would be a longing that would match in God's heart and that would take God moving on their heart as it did God moving on Moses heart you know program tells us God works on both ends at the same time he had to condition the people to receive the word that was coming forth what am I saying the people had to get hungry enough when they got hungry enough then God said now it's time for me to move you see God creates those conditions and I I don't want to leave that out but I want to emphasize that it takes the Holy Ghost moving upon our lives for and for those conditions to be brought forth out of our life if we are and I believe this the people of the promise then has the people of the promise then it is there for God to condition our hearts in our lives to be ready to receive from him as he would make his work known to us it's it's very it's very fitting you see you and I cannot take credit for it and say well you know it was all me I did something you know you can't take credit for anything and let me tell you if you try to do that God will remind you quickly that it's not you doing it even for you let me just say it like this for you for me and God they even give the inspiration that he gave and the focus for the services and the inspiration to pray it was same holy ghost that did that that one brother Samuel it wasn't you it was God moving on our hearts Amen it was God working it was God working there with brother Tim and all of those parts together and you can see when everything just works together to find the mind of the Lord and seeking for God God will come on the scene God will move so every spiritual happening is interpreted by Scripture and I want to say this if we could turn to Ephesians chapter 1 this morning as we would turn to Ephesians 1 you find here and I want to make this statement very clear that Ephesians as we were reading there before Ephesians parallels Joshua you see they have been called out of the land of Egypt but when they were called out then here they are in the wilderness and they they themselves are the ones who made the decision to stay in the wilderness they rejected let me just say it clearly they rejected the power of God that's what they rejected they made that decision because they knew they knew that they looked at themselves and they knew we can't do it ourselves but look what Joshua what Caleb said the Bible said he stilled the people sometimes we need to be steeled that God can speak to us and Caleb he made that declaration that he says if God be with us then the inhabitants they'd be bred for us amen they've God be with us he Calif was not looking at the opposition he was looking at God it had to be God that would bring them into the land it would have to be God that would acquit them they were not an army of themselves they were not a trained army but God didn't want him to be a trained army they only want him to be a people that was surrendered as a treasure in his hand that God could take simple people that would be considered offscouring and weakness but God said if you yield to me I'll make my power and my glory to be they know through your life and that's where caleb was standing did all the stand he stood right there day after day brother joy he stood right there on that promise over and over and over he stood there oh my you think about when the Bible tells us you read in the book of Deuteronomy the Bible says in the 38th year they begin to now move and get ready to come into the land as they got ready to come in the land you know God had it to where there was a couple kings that God said you go ask this king of Bashan or AAG of Bashan I don't know if maybe I have it backwards or whatever but you get the point when you look at this how did God asked and said ask him if you can pass through the land but you see the Bible says God stirred up that King that that king came out after Israel but here's a new generation that's been rose up you see what God's gonna do he's got to manifest his power to build faith in the new generation they have heard all of his testimonies they have seen his eyes they have gathered manna day after day but they need to see the Lord mighty in battle they need to see his power revisited upon the Church of the Living God again to bring back that same face whether we're not saved because we know it we're saved because there's a faith on the inside that when this fails there is a faith that moves us another King came out as well that King was smitten before them two kings are you with me to King's were smitten and then there would come the crossing on the third God was building their faith that's what the word of the Lord does it builds our faith in him I could say it like this this is why God does not want you focused on yourself he wants you focused on him that's why he moves upon your heart and here you repent you couldn't do that unless God first calls you that's a work of the power of God you would keep on going your own way but that's a work of the power of Almighty God that you would even turn right there then God comes along now he can do it all at once but I mean then I'm just laying this out then God comes along and he cleans out the old habits out of your life all the things that would have a hold upon your life what does he do he's manifesting his power he's manifesting remember the scripture that brother Tim read I think it's 1st Corinthians 1 verse 30 of how that he hath made him to be Redemption sanctification all of those things to us see it's building our faith not in ourselves well I gotta lay this down and I gotta stop this and I got to do this no we look to him he is our sanctification we ask for that power in that blood to be released Lord cleanse me Lord Jesus well if it it's preparation to cross into the promised land so Ephesians parallels Joshua because while they were in the wilderness they could not be recognized the potential the reality all of the mystery that was wound up in their life could not be made manifest it could not be displayed in the wilderness now let's read here in Ephesians 1 verse 3 I think I'm gonna have to get some cheaters here pretty soon you know even you start reading a medicine bottle and you got to take these things off I got a new set waiting on me on the other side [Applause] verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ brother when this is read this is not something forthcoming but what is happening now it's because it has already been decreed and declared it Christ before the foundation of the world and once you come into this place then the reality of where you were and who you are becomes real by the manifestation of his life and living itself through you spiritual blessings amen verse 4 according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love he chose us to be that way then you know what it's up to him to bring us to that reality having predestinated us unto the adoption that word adoption you hold that that's your placement or your position adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of His grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved oh no no no no no no no no I did get that out of your vocabulary he did because what is being manifest now in your life in my life is what God already knew and declared I'm just trying to stand still here when those patriarch mothers those when they were giving birth there to the sons of Jacob to that of Israel when those mothers were giving birth they called out the name when birth was coming and that name within it held a place and a position in the land though there were generations that came and some of them died in the wilderness but you cannot stop nor hinder the Word of God from coming to pass God knew who he had in his mind when he spoke this let me tell you something as much as Moses stood with the Spirit of Christ in him and interceded for Israel when at times God said I'll destroy him why because sin will bring the wrath of Almighty God but there must be one that will stand in the breach for you and I until that reality in our life becomes fully expressed and when that becomes expressed in us brother the intercessor is not somewhere out there but the Spirit of intercessor is within us that ties us into the mercy seat into our high priest god it's so good any well let's keep reading and whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of His grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself how could we know it if God didn't show it hmm that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance see Jesus did not give me an inheritance whoo hello somebody he did not give me an inheritance he brought me to it you know I'm quoting he did not give me an inheritance he brought me to my inheritance he's like somebody left you something there has to be somebody to make you aware of what belongs to you what somebody left you amen you were ordained to receive life glory he brought me to it that's how bringing us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself that ye should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in price in whom also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that you believe not when you believed not when you believed after you believed amen you've got to first believe the Bible said man believeth on to salvation and we don't wait on them we don't believe in that old Baptist doctrine selling people short of a real true experience with God it's not about what the Bible said the Devils believe in tremble right it takes God coming and bringing what that belief to a little thing holy faith in our life but you first have to believe and how can you know what to believe unless you know and hear what to believe right the Bible said in the book of Romans chapter 1 I believe it is how shall they hear see there gotta be a word that goes out that would cause somebody to hear and you know what not everybody is gonna white you know the Bible says blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for righteousness for you shall be filled do you know you're blessed they meant to even hunger and thirst for righteousness but don't just we want more and more but don't just stop if you haven't been filled just don't stop with the hunger and thirst say God satisfy the hunger satisfy the first and you know what once you give that brother you become addicted yes sir you'll become addicted to the Holy Ghost you'll become addicted to the word you'll become addicted to Jesus Christ I gotta add more and more and more of him you know what happens you're in love and the Bible says love is blind god help us to stay in the love of God to where we are blind to the failures and faults and mistakes of one another help us to be so in love with Jesus Christ we're so blinded by the blood so all we can see is there's help for you I'll pray for you God is good he is faithful his mercy endures forever [Applause] woo that's the kind of love is blind I believe in glory be to God oh my in whom also after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance under the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory and I can't preach all those scriptures today but I'm gonna try but I'm not I'm not I know better the Bible tells us in Galatians 4 when we look in Galatians 4 here once again Paul is setting it clearly in this chapter here in Galatians 4 he talks about the error when he opens in verse 1 he said now the air as long as he's a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law now look at this in verse 5 you see Paul Paul is bringing this down let me just say it this clearly you did not become a son or daughter when you were born again you always were you did not become a sheep when you were born again but I'll tell you this right now there will not be any that are not born again going in the rapture that means every sheep will be there there will not be one son or daughter where God looks around and says who ain't here there's a rope missing no he's got every thing accounted for he didn't make too little theophanies or too many theophanies he already made out to Lilith when people go to have a wedding they don't just you know say hey give me 500 invitations and then they just start sending them randomly they sit down and consider who they're inviting let me just be very clear to you you're not invited to the wedding you are the wedding you're not a guest of the wedding but you are called to be united with him right here in this life in your shoe pile in your tent with inside the bride's body we are united with Jesus Christ right here in our life there is a you now with Jesus Christ we go to the wedding supper revelations 19 you know the marriage of the lamb has come so while Paul is letting him know that even though he's an error he's already a son or a daughter but he cannot be recognized as a son or daughter he's still a servant but it's up to God only God can take that of what is an heir a son a potential and God bring it to a reality you with me only God can do that only God can bring a transformation within a life only God can do that men can do that a church can do that it takes the blood of Jesus Christ amen that's why I pray O God even evermore so Lord let me just so clearly Lord preaching that before the people standing with it I believe I have but it's just something that grips my heart friends I've always tried to point that our faith must rest in the Lord Jesus Christ it's not a church that saves us it's not being acquainted with the message that saves us it's to be under the blood that's the only place of fellowship that's the only place of safety that's the only place where sons and daughters come into manifestation so Paul was letting him know that Wow prior to this coming you see notice it took listen to me now it took a coming a coming that could actually release the sons and daughters of God it took a coming to release it when they put him on the cross and notice here the hand amia coming the Lord had to come he had to come and pay the price of redemption in paradise they were looking for his coming are you with me how were they looking for it by the blood of the Lamb that they had offered by revelation they were looking for his coming brother when he came there in hail he came down there he took our sins in the lowest parts of hell and how long he was in the lowest parts I don't know how many hours how many moments I don't know but he went there for you and I he had to unload the sin debt and we when he begin to ascend he came and knocked on the door paradise different ones that had saw him in their day they saw his day in their day base caught the visitation in their day hallelujah here he comes now and he makes himself known what happens where they could not get out of paradise he is coming releases them out of paradise and to think of this right now now after he's been offered out and the sacrifice has been made and now as they would have sinned he has sins on high what does he do he sends back the Holy Ghost not a first person third person he said if I go in I will come again I will come to you what was in declaring bears are coming bears are coming of the Holy Ghost there's a coming of the Lord to your life there must be a coming of the Lord and brother in liberate you it delivers you from every hole I've since changed [Applause] yeah when he knocked on the door Ezekiel said that's the one I saw the will in the middle of the wheel sheriff says finally honey on it this is the one this is the one we gave the fatted calf to he said yeah yeah yeah yeah I know him he also fed me Brian bread and wine yeah yeah yeah yeah boy you talk about an excitement what does all this mean but it's the same way when he came knocking on your door that's why I've been different all my life that's why I couldn't fit into churches that's why I couldn't fit in the program that's why something was different there was a loan there was a craving for reality this is the one who got a hold on my life when I felt the burden lifted this is the one who cleaned me up and now he has come to fill you up and lift you up in his coming whoo Joey what minha fits this is the Lord's doing verse 5 here's what he came to do to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons he came to redeem he paid the price of redemption your redemption is it's buying back what belongs to you he came to buy back what belong to him that what we might receive the adoption the placement the positioning as sons and daughters of God how do we receive that positioning when we already are sons and daughters of God the lie Oh God itself moving in your life translate you supernatural transportation he it translates you from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son that's why it wasn't you that received the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost received you hallelujah glory what meaneth this and because you are sons already were because you are sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father I think it'd be good go ahead and pull up verse seven sister tabby I think it'd be good if we read this one together you ready let's go wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ and Sammy we just said now in the son you're a manifested son now he's manifesting one day in your life all the time you just had to get in him whoo glory is the thick of molasses in it better not go to talking about that I'm one son but this coming across Jordan think about it God didn't bring them up to the Jordan when the Jordan was at it you know just a little standstill God brought him up to the Jordan better bill when the banks were flooded he brought him in the time of April resurrection season he brought him here into this time you know God knew what he was doing because as soon as they got over there on the other side oh oh I gotta go ahead and say it soon as they got over to the other side they was already some old corn that was gonna be waiting on him there was gonna be a change of diet that would come hello now they had been eating the heavenly manna that had been fallen but now when they got to the other side they were eating of what itself had went in the ground had been raised up and now had become bread and substance for them what was that resurrection power eating of the old corn of the land the mature things of things that belong to sons and daughters of God hallelujah so coming across that Jordan you can't come a car they couldn't come across anywhere they couldn't tell Joshua Joshua you know what we're not this right here it this ain't fitting it's a mess we're gonna go on downstream but we'll meet you over there we're going to go on downstream we want to go to where you know it's not this is too deep this place is too deep well how do you expect your sins to get buried now let me just also put this in here wouldn't matter if it's a millimeter I hope I got the right measurement of the blood of Jesus Christ it's enough to take care of every demon out of hell it's a right yes or not but you see God was letting it be no there's only one way into the Promised Land you gotta come in by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there is no other passage there is no other name whereby men might be safe there's only one way across amen one way repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it is the name of Almighty God being placed upon you as sons and daughters of God where he recognizes you this is my son this is my daughter you might say I'm a housewife you got Authority you got Authority once Satan 101 or 1 arise his tongue you got Authority sister he hath made us kings and priests unto our God amen we are royal priesthood sickness rises in the home you got a right to stand right there with the authority of the Holy Ghost he's backing you up you might say I don't feel nothing it ain't about what you feel you're standing there as a son or daughter of God upon the promise of God and you call what belongs to you ask the Father anything in my name and I'll do it that's why Jesus said I don't have time to read these scriptures here but he said it you can have it so you can look at it later John 14:26 and he ascends the comforter in it the father will send it in my name yes sir it's got to be recognized it's a living God that came down he came down and become one of us that he might impart his life to you and I home aha we were ordained ordained to receive life and it takes a sovereign act of the transforming power of God to place us into the body of Jesus Christ the word we understand we need to have a home church but it was not to where you were placed in a home church come on now you know that's something that has to be and I'm gonna preach on that this morning but that son that has to be revealed to you personally brother Graham said I'm Church using a church home you don't choose it based on programs but he said there's two qualities you choose it on you choose it on the word and the working of the Holy Ghost those are the two things that you choose a church on I don't like how they do this and I don't like how to do this when it comes down to the word and the spirit that's where we make our decision and as I told you I think on Sunday you know I don't care and I hope you don't care either I don't care what people would thinking that people think anything you know what y'all don't act like me and I don't act like you I want you to I want you to be free and the Holy Ghost you know I preach the people that may not they may not shout but they'll sit there and cry and they got a big old smile on their face home I mean it's like they got a big old pot of honey sitting on their lap brother they're enjoying let me tell you something that pulling on the gift of God as much as the other person that gets real excitable in that way you say what do you say we want to be under the influence and the effects of the Holy Ghost amen we want to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth and remember now like brother Jack Duff said when he was here he said if you haven't been tagged with the label heresy then you haven't even began to worship yet whoo but you know what I really don't care I don't I don't pay no attention to it why I'm enjoying him I don't get happy just when I come to church that's my family he's my life just want to be the God blessed be the name of the Lord this is why the Bible says like I gonna read this in 1st Corinthians 12:4 as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ I'm talking about the promised land now everybody with me I'm talking about the promised land now for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit amen the Holy Ghost is our Joshua amen he's the one who takes us across in the land hallelujah listen half I'm Joshua the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the fullness as he comes remember it had to be alerted in this hour and God had a messenger on the scene that just as much as Daniel in Daniel 9 I could look and understand by the books that it was time for deliverance to come brother band would stand there and Daniel seventy weeks he said I also understand that there is to be a Joshua here there is to also be a crossing into the promised land to all the promises of God brother let me tell you something we have crossed into the promises of Almighty God and brother the final capping of every promise is where he himself the capstone comes and lifts his bride enrapturing grace I understand but the books were were out it had to be this time for that position and that placing a manifestation of the sons of God you know what that is that's Brad ty it's a Talam when she has a mature woman let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife she hath made herself ready that Saint Jesus now living in our flesh beautiful scripture in Genesis 48 6 where Jacob is dedicating Joseph's boys and when he's dedicating boy you could preach this at a family altar Jacob took him and he said the angel of the Lord who redeemed me from all evil bless the lads the age of the Lord brother Jacob didn't have a meeting with the secretary he had a personal meeting with the angel of the Lord Jacob now notice I want you to think of this now Jacob got tired of being Jacob did you hear me he got tired of being Jacob he grew weary of his life he already had a blessing pronounced tougher and that's remember he ran he he ran off into the land he went just seen Laban and that's where he was instructed to go the blessing had already been prayed over his life he had been he had been told right the truth the truth had been laid out for him come on now come on mom and Daddy it had already been laid out the truth are you with me now now what's this but he had to get desperate for the life-giving flow to bring the effect into the Covenant when he got desperate the Lord began to draw him to the place where he first met the Lord when he came to Bethel he just thought he was in a place you know I mean I gotta rest here you see what Jacob thought I just gotta rest I'm tired God had him to come to Bethel it was not by chance that he went to that youth meeting I mean it wasn't by chance that he went to that serve I mean it wasn't by chance God has a place that he can make himself known to his children that I am the living cause this ain't a pipe dream I am still the same God I'm still the same yesterday today and forever I am as he told Jacob the God of Abraham by father not by grandfather he don't have grandchildren I'm the God of Abraham thy father [Applause] that's what even told Isaac and on and on and on and on wrong but you see he brings him back to Bethel water spiritual significance happens to Bethel this is a type 144,000 coming back here - but we won't breech that now Omaha just old lord have mercy y'all love me you love him that's first now you love me you're alright but the Lord Himself manifested himself to Jacob that I am the entrance to this house the house of God he were declaring a dwelling place called laying it down there in Bethel that would become known as Bethlehem the branch center the place where that of of God's own read the house of God's own bread remember it was now God would bring Jacob back to this place where God had made himself known to it you see God don't take him somewhere else Oh Lord he brings him back to the place where he had made himself known to him but remember Jacob had made a promise here he said you bring me back here and I will give the tithe of all my substance you know the time that God was wanting it wasn't just the honor of what Jacob would take a tenth of that of his earthly possessions and give there unto the Lord but you realize friends that when God would require of us to be taught fairs to show that of the honor do you realize that God Himself is a tax payer he takes a tithes of all the earth he gives of the riches of himself what was he asking for he was asking for the depths of Jacob he was asking for that which he knew lay there Israel and the Bible says was he wrestled with the angel of the Lord the Bible says he blessed him they're not just Bethel even though that's attacked but he blessed him they're the Holy Ghost finds its mark in the heart of the believer it takes that character that life that see that has been laying there dorm beneath all the evil or you with me beneath all the evil and he descends down beneath all the evil and the age of the Lord redeems that from all evil breaking every hold upon the life and as we said those patriarchs were born from Jacob they were to be divinely placed in the land you see like the prodigal when we were reading moments ago he was dead and sent in trespasses program tells us that the mama and the daddy were praying in their house day after day you read on down there and psalms 118 when you get home the Bible says I called him to him in my distress and he heard me but been said that mama and that daddy were praying there for that young man brother BAM said hear he said when he got to that place you know the Bible he got to a place he was he said if they too gave him husks what the pigs was he they too gave him some of that he to ate it he was that much in need do you know what before he got to that point he would never have been desperate enough he was the son and God let him keep going until what until finally he got to thinking about home home never changed are you hearing me Paul never changed who was changing he was home wasn't changing he was you might look at him might seem like you might stand right in your face and seemed like if the prayers are not being answered but let me tell you something the angel of the Lord was working there but I'm said the angel of the Lord came down in that Pigpen he met him there and he said the angel the Lord began to deal with this heart about going back home who is it that is Tron you and I the angel of the Lord who is it that is brought Israel back into our homeland the angel of the Lord prayers that were being offered up you might say this is an awful long fishing line but don't worry there's a hook on the other end well this and this and this you stand there on God's promise that in thy house shall be saved I wish I could preach that one this morning to that in the house shall be saved that same faith that you have and you have in your life of what God has done you take that same faith and you apply it when you pray for that wayward son or daughter of God brother the Holy Ghost is still in action to bring conviction to hearts and lives and bring them back home they might say I don't want to go to church you keep praying because maybe that's see that's all they've ever seen he's just Church now don't take that wrong I'm not putting anybody down I'm saying that when you come and sit here it's a mystery until you get lit up you think it's something that well the preachers making them do it well I'm gonna do this reverse I don't want you to do it for me you got to do it because you love the Lord I don't talk the way I talk dressed the way I dress after way I act because I'm afraid of somebody I do that because the love of God is shed abroad in my heart even when I don't feel like praying the love of God that shit'll brought in my heart but said boy you need contact with your Heavenly Father today but I don't feel like listening or reading but there's something on the inside that moves beyond this needs your daily bread he became miserable sometimes when they become miserable if they're close to you you might get a little miserable but they got to get miserable got to get tired of being who they are you accept the forgiveness of the Lord just bear with me a moment that's wonderful but you must you must be accepted and received in him by the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus himself was the word when he was born but the word had to be made flesh now you know how could we could I could run through a litany of quotes brother Bram said he walked into the water as a man but he came up as but God man said he walked in the water as a man but he came up Immanuel see as a twelve-year-old boy the word was laying in his life brother Ben tells us in Dallas Texas paradox 1964 when he as a bully he reasoned with the scribes in the temple he reasoned with them on the Scriptures they were astounded at his wisdom and brother Bram goes on to say the father didn't even do well in him at the time more than just a knowledge of the word you see the words got to be made flesh another man tells us I believe it's looking away to Jesus he said when he came to found of the water there the heavens were opened why were the heavens open because he walked in obedience to the Spirit in the message Easter seal brother Ram said the Holy Ghost sought him out in perfect obedience and he comes to the water to be washed there by the water to be washed by the Prophet he's getting ready to enter into this priestly journey come on somebody he's gonna enter into this now then the Holy Ghost is sending in the form of a death what's he doing he's coming to fill his temple come on now and through this through this through this Union now he'll come through this and there will then come forth an imparting of life to other sons and daughters of God the word had to be made flesh it had to be quickened that's the words that the Prophet used he said when he came up out of the water then then was the word made flesh you see the Holy Spirit in you he lives and it'll manifest a word life that's expressed I'm not talking about all you know you understand I'm not talking about all you know my we may just have to wind this down when God moves there in your life like that the Holy Spirit coming in in your life you then the scriptures that begins to move within our lives the works that I do shall you do also it was the works that were done that were interpreted by the word this is where brother man would would be very clear with us he said sometimes he said we people can't wait from one revival to the next and everything back and forth he said but we come here we come to confess and get into that blood of Jesus that cleanse us from all sin we should focus our self down to see that one true Living God standing here who made the promise the heavens and earth will pass away but his word cannot fail stay right there upon that then you're not tossed about with winds of doctrine carried it back from place to place from pillar to post you know where you stand because you've been zeroed in with God and you see your own life hitting the target just like the Apostles did you live the way they did you were baptized the way they were you see the same results that they see you see it operating in you hallelujah when the Lord Jesus came let me just let me just skip here just a little bit they just move on here when he raised here on that Easter morning he brought them together they were all scattered they didn't know what had taken place but he went and he gathered them himself he began to make known to them the promises that pertained to them he's building their faith in the word letting them see everything that was wrote of all these things that he should suffer as I suffered he's building their faith in the world he's got to give direction for their life he's not going to leave him back there in Luke 24 you see they cannot just look at the coming that has come there in the flesh but they have to now be brought and made ready for the coming in their flesh and now once he's gathered him by the promise then he can begin to make known to them there is a promise growing wait in Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen he's letting him know this is the promise here of what is written there in the word it was time for the sons of God to be born it was time they'll know who can bring a son of God to birth it has to be the same God Jehovah back there in the beginning a man he gave back to his sons back there come on now you see it takes two to make a birth it takes that of the written word confirmed by the Spirit of God we must be born of the water and of the spirit they men your birth the real new birth positions you in the body of Jesus Christ it places you in the Word of God amen you're not just looking over into the promises brother you're in the promises crew during the Gulf I'm ready for a picnic sorry these ain't picnic grounds these are battlegrounds hang gonna preach on that today but this banner grounds once you come in the land it's time to go whoop some Giants come on somebody it's time to take down all the pictures it's time to rip down all the other idolatry and everything that is sought to pollute the land it's time to take possession of the land it's time to tear down creeds and traditions and dogmas it's time to possess the land and for every city there's a battle plan you won't take AI like you took Jericho just like every experience in your life but what's necessary and important is the same God who met you for Jericho is the same God that will meet you for AI it don't matter if it's a lion it's a bear or galati's the same God and this is your land glory be to God if the Lord interpreted in you in a living form here you are in your life you know you may not be able to quote scripture and verse and whatever more that don't matter that don't matter but what's most important is is you've got the author of the word inside of you you know how powerful that is everybody else can be look around I got the Bible you say I got the author I got the author of the book living in me and the author of the book the Spirit of Truth leads and guides us into all truth so I don't have to just go to you know some borders books can I have a book signing can I have your autograph his name has been wrote on my heart the Holy Ghost the author himself of the word has come it's personal every day are you with me oh my think of this now he was pouring out he poured out his life when they came out of the upper room here they came out of there they came staggering out and there were people said in acts 212 they were looking at somewhere in doubt only third hour of the day I mean we use only get drunk like that around here draw our thee to God I want to ask you to raise your hand how many been drunk on the Holy Ghost before that's the kind of drunks I believe in Oh Samuel that a scripture it is in acts 2 and if you read your Bible in the beginning of the book of Esther when winning King Ahaz was called a feast the Bible said there was an abundance of wine there hmm don't tell me that glory be to God but you see this is a toxication even after you recover and can walk a straight line brother you might be able to walk in a straight line here but you see what you got the plumb line on the inside then you're already walking a straight line you've been inoculated intoxicated whether you're on a drunk until you leave this world that's a power of the Holy Ghost it gives you power even when you feel when you get the feeling gloomy you ask yourself how can I feel gloomy how can I feel down down and you might walk you're feeling down you feeling gloomy but there's something that rests within the bosom of your soul that's you know you with me and you've been you begin to revisit those grounds come on somebody revisit those grounds oh mile could preach here when when Jacob remember when Jacob left Bethel after his experience with God I'm talking about the second experience where he got lit up when Jacob left remember he went from Bethel and that's where he got in trouble hello now his daughter Deena and whatever more he got trouble and God never told him to leave Bethel and at the end of that chapter God said get back to Bethel get back to Bethel let me tell you something that's why brother Ram said you must always stay where the kingdom of God is when you're being fed spiritually day and night i buyed there in his presence a man or woman comes out of there and you know what they asked they said what meaneth yes that was the question what meaneth this Peter standing up they appended costs these are not drunk as usable better there was no shame in him there was no shame in him when they noticed before they had become one he had denied the Lord Jesus Christ but rather he came out on the day of Pentecost he had been United with the Lord Jesus Christ true oneness at table he won the shame he stood up and declared he testified what had happened in his life they said what mean offense he said this spiritual happening is interpreted by the scriptures in the book of Joel you know what he was declaring what was written is now living what mean the fist this is the Lord's doing God had come and capped off their life all the rest of the member when the Lord Jesus come you remember how it is when you read brother Doug you remember how it is when you read luck in this and Luke 15 in other places the Pharisees and the Sadducees they always had problems with the crowds that came to Jesus he's a friend of sinners and publicans but let me ask you why were they coming to him Linda just asked us Pharisees and Sadducees why aren't they coming to you you create an atmosphere about your life if you got an atmosphere we've received the message of yeah and everybody ought to be like us I don't want to be like you I don't want that kind of a spirit around me hey man I want the Holy Ghost amen I want the love of God that can look at a situation and I don't care they may have they may have tattoos everywhere they may have rings all the way up and down their nose that means nothing they meant God can move right down in that life and break that hold he triumphs over every principality he triumphed over every demon out of hell that was nothing could hold him [Applause] sometimes we get so religious and sanctimonious well I wouldn't have nobody in my church that would like this or like that well this ain't your church [Music] and this name brother Sanders Church this is Jesus Church and after all I can't help it I was just pointed to be an innkeeper all I know is there's others that have the same love of God in their heart and they walk up and down the roadways they go places and where the religious would look down and say who could do anything with that they say here we got a power oh lord have mercy we got to preach on this one they say we got a power you see the man who came he had a power he was riding on the priest wasn't riding on a power but here that man had a power that Samaritan had a power and he himself was able to take the man he knew how to minister and put him up here and he knew where to take him better let me tell you something I'm only the assistant brother Carlos I'm just the guy standing here and the chief physician says scalpel Oh scalpel Tom Oh toes that's all I do but you know what he's the one notice the Bible said he kept pouring in oil he kept pouring in oil he kept pouring in oil I'm telling you this Holy Ghost as it keeps coming it's being poured eeeh that water it's changing lives it's healing wounds it's mending divisions it's the important chord in the wounds being dressed by the Saints of fine power the sterilization of the blood of the Lamb he's able to dress those wounds [Music] yeah [Music] I'm dragging my breath Pharisees how in the world is he associated with sinners and publicans I believe sometimes that people don't even read the message they read let alone the Bible you know a lot of people don't you read the Bible no more all they do is quote Coco Coco Coco now I'm gonna be honest me the first question I've got is what about Jesus I've been saying that what about Jesus what about him in all this thank God for the messenger thank God for the message but let's remember who he came from let's remember he's the one that that Eleazar came to introduce us to and if we're actually feeding from feeding on the word how did you hear me feeding on the word not just listening to the word when they got close to that time when Isaac was descending in by the will of him that liveth and see it forever remember here it was Rebekah that she asked Eleazar who's this man how many men you think she saw a lot of men there was something different about this man she had been feeding on the message feeding in the word and she was united with the character of the where she could hear his voice she could recognize him she knows he didn't die in 1965 she hears his voice hey bossy the runway I hope I don't got no mechanical failures like him new Boeing's do we'll hand hit in their high place the Lord Jesus here he came he let him know this is mercy its mercy its mercy and he told them like this he said how he said you've missed the mercy of God you've missed it how many times he tell him that you've missed the mercy of God and he told him he said how can anybody put a new piece in an old garment then he went in and made the statement how can you put new wine in old bottles you've got to get new bottles new bottles and you know what them bottles are made out of animal skins I'm looking at animal skins come on somebody I'm looking at what was once living badgers dead badgers but behind the badger skin it's veiling the glory of God and when people look at you they don't understand what's happening what meaneth this this is the Lord's doing this is the Lord's doing the glory of God is manifest upon your life in your life through your eyes and God comes on the inside he takes that old bottle and he transforms it to a new bottle you know why it's got to be a new bottle cuz this wines got power in it it needs room for expansion it just gets to bubble in there all of a sudden there might be a day and all of a sudden it'll grow okay and then here comes another day and it's just fermenting brother he don't get weaker let's get stronger and here it goes on all the sudden what's happening it's life there's life in here and the new bottle only expresses the life that has come into it God didn't change coats he just changed the man you wear the same old coat but you're a new man on the inside amen what are you a son and daughter of God made manifest by the power of Almighty God we ain't got to stop if I don't put this up we've got to stop here I keep getting little nuggets keep flying off of there what means this the elder son asked the question he pulled his servant to the side what is all this music and dancing I'm not gonna get that today what is all this you know you want to turn around to them and say hey older brother ya sing this song with me if you're happy and you know the elder son was all was saying a tizzy he was all upset what in the world is all this music in this dance add those two words music and I'll just leave this with you it is the word that we use for symphony what is this Symphony that I hear dancing means there's some action and movement going on that matches the music what is all of this you know the elder son I've been here the whole time I've done this I've done that I've done this and you never one time never one time ever killed the fatted calf for me you know what his problem was self his whole service was about himself he was living in the presence of divine grace but he chose to work and work and work instead of receiving the grace of God that was staring him in the face the father turned to him and said son you're here always with me you're always with me but this by brother he was lost he's now found it was dead but he's alive again and I want you to notice the elder brother he never calls the younger brother the prodigal his brother but he says this your son he did not want to identify with the prodigal son at all the brand says like the modern church they don't want them then screaming hollering acts 2:38 holy ghosts tongue talking youngins around him they don't want the Word made flesh at all let me tell you we can have all of that that was just even expressed right there what brother I'm talking about you can have all of that but it ought to put you in the word but let me say this very clearly if it has put you in the word then you are subject to every and any of the nine spiritual gifts and you will be in subjection to every one of God's ministerial gifts hello under the leadership of the Holy Ghost so you cannot be in the word and not believe in him but when he puts you there brother you're in the land you're in the homeland you can look around all that belongs to you it all along I'll tell you this morning if you've not been there why don't you heat and just yield to the Lord don't try to live this life on your own let him cut everything away from you let him bring deliverance to your life and lift you into that place now don't don't get me wrong now when you're in when you've come into the land it don't mean you know I brother Brandon goes into it then the quote right there it don't mean you won't make mistakes but brother and sister mistakes are not willful sin you understand what I'm saying there's times where you have to understand the discernment between deliverance when God puts you into the land you're free he brings a circumcision in your life and you know what so you can walk in liberty walk as a son and daughter of God are you with me seem like we just took a little dip there for a moment you know listen you know in your heart when you've passed from death unto life you know nobody can take that from you because that's not a work of man that's a work of the Living God these are our promises these are our promises they meant to live in this land let's let stand stand Jesus he's every hit is bound I wonder if there be any with uplift at hand maybe in your heart since it through the word and as the Holy Spirit would speak out so what I come god bless you Lord Jesus father we are lured satisfied what your our strength your our life Lord truly Lord when we have been brought Lord into the land Lord Lord brought in by you Oh God it's a paradox Lord it's a miracle that's what it is Lord God with human tongue Lord it cannot be explained but Lord out of that spiritual happening it's interpreted by the word Lord when you were here walking upon this earth in the days of your flesh you spoke to them in that hour and you said if you cannot believe me they leave me for the very works sake for the works themselves testify of Who I am or Jesus it was a life the life that was on display Lord and in Our Lives your God when the blood has been applied it's your life that's on display it's what's reflected Lord in us and through us I pray Lord if there's one here this morning that doesn't know you maybe they're here Lord and they've never even accepted you Lord God as their Lord and Savior maybe they went to church Lord for many of their lives but they've never ever come to a place where they've repented Lord really been sorry for their sins but Lord God under your presence it brings conviction to a heart and they would have the question or eyes in their heart Lord what must I do to be saved Lord Jesus would never want to be negligent Lord because you are still calling two hearts I pray God that may lure that heart and life just be Lord as it's offered up to you god I pray the Lord that you would cleanse them Lord if they've never walked into the waters of baptism and been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they've never Lord God been identified in your burial maybe they've been identified with the church Lord but father they realize I need to be identified with Jesus Christ Lord may they this morning surrender themselves and then Lord making ready to receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord it's not a reward it's a gift the gift of the Holy Ghost not what we earn not what we merit no it's the gift of the Holy Ghost Lord God may they receive him or not pray may it be such a desperation that would strike Lord within their heart such a hunger Lord many parents Lord sitting here right now grandparents even Lord God different ones Lord had got friends co-workers different ones that Lord you've laid on their heart and they have them on their heart right now and Lord God as we come before the throne of grace I believe where we're standing Lord Lord God we offer prayer right now we ask Lord that the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord as you dealt with the prodigal when he was down there Lord God in that pig pen in his lowest part you dealt with him Lord and Lord God you begin to turn his heart toward home father I ask right now Lord God that as the Holy Spirit would go out Lord God and begin to deal Lord God with that heart Lord and turned that heart around Lord God to begin to think Lord God about you Lord to begin to think about home Lord God Oh father to begin to think about Lord father the presence of God services that they've said in maybe some Lord they don't Lord have never said Lord within a service maybe they haven't been privileged Lord God like some Lord God of our young people have been but I pray Heavenly Father that God may you go Lord and visit them Lord God and Lord calls the Lord God their hearts Lord to begin Lord to tender and turn to You Lord Jesus I pray Brannen Lord God may you move Lord for them when they could look at all their surroundings Lord they might look at all their problems and their difficulties they might look at everything around their life Lord I pray that God but main Lord God their hearts be lifted Lord that looks beyond Lord called the Pigpen where they're at Lord and it would actually begin to look back home Lord God Oh father granny Lord ask Lord for every backslider Lord for every son and daughter Lord God Oh father for the grandchildren Lord God we ask you Lord for our loved ones Lord God Oh father in the name of Jesus Christ Lord we send the Holy Ghost Lord God the age of the Lord that you'll deal with their hearts Lord God granted Lord God search them out Lord how pretty father and Lord might like Jacob may they get tired of being Jacob granting Lord I pray thee all Jesus Lord as we stand here Lord God as your children or than many that standing here we come out of services every time Lord as we come out of a service I always think of what your prophet talks about Lord he said a man of God gets done preaching on Sunday he said the devil is waiting to try to knock every ounce of confidence out of him on Monday morning everything that the Holy Ghost instilled into him Lord Jesus that's not just for me that's each and every one of your children it shows coming to the house of God Lord God as your presence comes through your word you instill confidence in us Lord and I pray Heavenly Father this is why when every service is said and done as Paul could say I'll never come to you with enticing words of man's wisdom that your faith would rest in man's words but that your faith would rest in the power of God Oh Lord Jesus how we thank you Lord for lives and hearts that you've changed thank you God for each and every one I thank you for how the Lord you're still working in our midst or God Lord there's still many others Lord God and father we're standing here Lord God for one another in prayer there's needs that we have Lord there's needs that Lord in the physical realm some Lord God for healing some others financial Lord Lord God there's a needs among us Lord and father we ask Lord right now in the name of Jesus Christ the Lord you were just ministered to those needs Lord God ministered to the lives of your children Lord for those that are sick Lord and suffering Lord in their body I pray that God that you would touch them Lord here this morning Lord Oh God visit their their heart their life right now Lord I pray O God for every requests Lord upon the hearts you see it you know it Lord we committed to you now Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen what meaneth this what meaneth this what happened what took place what meaneth this brother Joey what happened last week what happened the Lord came down and touch lives remember your life the spiritual happening in your life it's interpreted by the scriptures it's interpreted by the scriptures it's a life they'll be expressed right out in the scriptures and she continued moving in the word letting God work within your life everything that God has done Satan is always there to try to contest it Luke chapter 4 verse 1 and Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost was led into the wilderness to be tempted but what God does it's his work no man can take from it no man can add to it it's his work aren't you glad for that and you men now that you're in the land it's
