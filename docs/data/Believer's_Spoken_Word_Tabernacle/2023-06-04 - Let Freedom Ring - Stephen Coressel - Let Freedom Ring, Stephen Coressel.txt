magicians fail deacons fail we all fail but God don't fail amen and that's why we worship Him amen not only can he he cannot fail but he also promised to do it for you too amen so see we go we got a double portion of the Holy Ghost this morning I say the words of my pastor Ray we all got here we might as well have church this morning amen I feel great this morning amen the Lord's gonna do something wonderful for us amen amen if you have your Bibles amen we need to at least read one scripture amen so we must be pulling this morning because God changed my entire sermon back there so here we are amen so I say let's just have a good time in the Lord amen let's leave all the problems we got out the door let's not worry about what's happening amen for all we know we're going to be gone after this service and all that stuff you're worried about and all the stuff that you've been struggling with it's not going to Mean a Thing that stuff's not even worthy to be compared to the glory which shall be revealed in you so let's not worry about it this morning but let's just enter into the presence of God and say Jesus speak to me Jesus mold me if this is my last service Lord then get me ready for when you come amen amen who glory to God Amen John 8 John 8. verse 31. John 8 31. boy whoever played the piano today we might have to take you to ER because your fingers must be on fire this morning see I'm I'm a little partial my mom when I was when I was raised and growing up and things like that my mom played piano all the time and things like that so I've been around piano musicians my entire life so when I hear that gospel I call it the Pentecostal bump and things like that when I hear the gospel runs and so forth it just brings shivers down my spine and I jumped out of my seat when I heard the music being played this morning amen amen God is good amen it's okay to be happy to be a Christian amen they can be happy in ball games we can be happy here amen glory to God all right let's read the scripture amen I just feel like going amen John 8 verse 31 John 8 verse 31. the scripture reads then said Jesus through those Jews which believed on him if you continue my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed and we never in bondage to any man do you know that's how delusional they are they were in bondage to Rome at the time Rome owned them at the time remember they couldn't even crucify Jesus without Rome so see but they think oh we're free we're free let's see how sayest thou ye shall be made free they didn't know they were in bondage Jesus answered in verse 34 verily verily I say unto you whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin and the servant of the Bible That's not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed if our heads were a prayer most gracious kind Heavenly Father Lord we have just gathered together under the mighty name of Jesus Christ Lord and we're so thankful of this morning Lord for your presence God we thank you Lord for meeting us Lord you promise you would be here when two or three are gathered you promise to be here Lord and so father God we just ask you dear Jesus this morning you would take this time and speak to our hearts oh God lord if it was just a man talking with a bunch of people listening it'd be no different than a college course a a normal speech but Lord if you'd show up Lord God when you come down it becomes the Church of the Living God and so Lord Jesus we're just asking you Lord to speak to our hearts Lord may we all step aside this morning Lord and be able to enter into your presence Lord where where things of Eternity can happen we're trusting you and believing we commit this service into your faithful hands in the name of thy son our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ the bride say together amen God bless you you may be seated amen you love the Lord amen God surely is good amen I'm going to preach a message called Let Freedom Ring Let Freedom Ring and I kind of like I told you I kind of switched my sermon so they may not have this quote ready yet because I gave it to him about 10 minutes ago so but I want to start with this little statement brother Bram said and it's kind of a oh they did I tell you what I I didn't doubt you for a second Brian amen and just so you know you're not seeing double okay I'm Steven and that's Brian back there his mama told me last time I was here said boy you look awful lot like my son I said I'll take it as a compliment amen watch what brother bam said here in Smyrna Church age he said now comes our triumphal Capstone on the baptism with the Holy Ghost now this this quote is very common but it's very Bedrock to the message because what is a Capstone a Capstone is something that unifies amen when you when you have a pyramid you're going up you need the Capstone in order to bring it all together without the Capstone you would still be piecing it together but when you bring the Capstone now you come up to the the full revelation of it amen and so thank God that God LED brother by him to say this for us because now we have what the baptism of the Holy Ghost does for us see it's so important to understand when you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost I mean that's great in yahata but what did it do to you see it's very important to understand what happened to you when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and because then it makes life so much easier you think did I just receive the Holy Ghost just to do good things on this side did I just receive the Holy Ghost to be nicer to be kinder and so forth like that what did the Holy Ghost do to me amen so he goes now comes our triumphal Capstone on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he quotes Galatians 4 4-7 amen see it was already in the Bible amen Galatians 4 4 7. watch we're going to read it here real quick uh but when the fullness of time has come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons not Sons but adoption of sons amen and because you are Sons God sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart's crying Abba Father wherefore Thou Art no more servant but a son and of ascendant an heir of God through Christ remember you can't be an heir without inheritance amen if you are a son that means there's something you get then from it amen Oh Glory to God hallelujah sometimes we live under privileges this is what we're going to be talking about Let Freedom Ring sometimes we live under what we can actually gain from God listen you're not a son to be useless you know what I mean you're a son with inheritance that means you have rights amen glory to God in Hallelujah you know the president of the United States he has children and they get to fly Air Force One don't they I don't get to fly Air Force One it might be nice you know what I mean probably a nice plane in there it'd be kind of fun to ride that play but I can't why do that I didn't vote for those kids but see by association of the president being their father they get certain benefits they get certain rights and if God's your father that means you have certain benefits too [Applause] that's it listen it doesn't matter what you do you can't change that fact I got four daughters over there no matter how hard they try they will always be my child hold glory to God in Hallelujah no matter how hard you try sometimes to run if you were a Son of God God's Gonna Get You Still it is okay to lean on your free destination [Applause] now I know some people treat predestination like a rocking chair where they can do whatever they want let them do that you don't have to be like that but you're allowed to rely on it you're allowed to rely on being a son of God I mean think about it if God if you weren't supposed to do nothing with predestination why did God tell you about it to begin with God told you so it do something for you why you were always his son amen [Applause] glory to God who Hallelujah watch what brother bam says about Galatians 4 to 4-7 he says there it is Jesus Christ came forth died upon the cross and accomplished Redemption restoring the original owner by means of purchase or paying the price and thereby placed us as Sons that's in caps for some reason Amen brother bran put down caps you know why it's important for you to understand what the Holy Ghost did to you he placed us as Sons he did not make us Sons for we were already his sons and thereby to be placed as Sons Oh Glory to God do you understand see sometimes we think the Holy Ghost only started when you received him do you know the Holy Ghost has always been working in your life they that are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God when did God start leading you before you even knew it amen so think about like this if God was worried about your van and leading you then what makes you think God can't take you all the way now you can't even come to Christ without the Holy Ghost you could have even been led to where you at now without him doing all the leading and if he did it then he can do it tomorrow too [Applause] see why it's so important to understand what the Holy Ghost did to you it did not make you a son you were already a son but now you know you're a son and that's the difference brother Graham said in Christ the mystery God he said what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said it's the personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you okay it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not Jesus Christ but Jesus Christ [Applause] it was already here amen even the mystery was depend from Generations from past things but now as May manifest unto the Saints which is Christ in you the hope of glory see Christ has always been in you but what did the Holy Ghost come to do it didn't come to you to make you a son it came to free you as a son [Applause] so now you can be free amen from the bondage of Sin from the bondages of this world glory to God and Hallelujah see you can be free from depression amen you can be free from anxiety and I'm gonna tell you something the world's handing it out in truckloads amen but we're the Church of the Living God when we receive the Holy Ghost we are sons of God glory to God see see this is what I mean when I say we live under privileges amen you're free that's what the Holy Ghost actually came to do it didn't come to bring more bondage we're going to read that scripture in a second it didn't come to make your life worse let me just give you something real quick maybe for the young people and stuff like that okay don't ever ever be jealous of what this world has right the only thing the world can give you is death it's the only thing to have look at their hot they got more hospitals than they ever have more medical stuff and yet we're dying more people are dying from mental things now I mean they can't the only thing the world can give is death it's the only thing you can give us hey man don't ever be jealous of what they got it's death it's useless it's not even that great it really ain't right hey man it's not that great out there listen sin might be great for a season but sin comes with consequences your body was not made to sin I know I know your body was constructed in shape and iniquity but God never made for sin to be in your body why it death Works in it God is not a god of the Dead He's a god of the living you remembered that so the reason why your body dies is because of sin all sin is is death amen so see all that stuff out there don't ever be jealous of it hey man it won't do you any good flee from it and run from it as if your life depends on it well that was free amen he placed us as Sons he did not make us Sons for we were already his sons but he placed us as Sons for as long as we were in the world in the flesh we could not be recognized as Sons see that's what's actually important for you to have is for you to know you're a Son of God see God already knew Gary knew you were a son but now with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can find out yes I am a son right right do you know how much of a sudden you are amen you know how much of a Son of God you are you're just as sinless as he is I tell you what sometimes when I say that people people just have a hard time in their mind about it hey man do you know why you do it's because you look at this as the sun right is not the sun we're changing this amen when we get a body change we get rid of this so of course we don't look at this then this is going to get changed I'm not this I'm this what do you identify as see that's what God did God was freeing you from yourself Oh Glory to God brother bam said who's my worst hand to me myself yeah so God even took care of that too glory to God and Hallelujah [Applause] it's an unconditional Covenant it's an unconditional Covenant when God came to Abraham to make a promise to him that he was going to have a son right he split the animals he told him split the animals and so forth Abraham knew what he was doing remember brother Branham taught us it was a custom that you would split the animals and you both Warriors would walk through and then that was symbolizing if we broke this Covenant then we become like one of these animals then so Abraham knew what he was doing Abraham knew about God was doing and so he split the animals kept the buzzards off and so forth and it was about time for him to walk through and all of a sudden God put a deep sleep on him and he saw the burning light we know what it was it was the pillar of fire the same pillow fire we have a picture of don't you dare let these critics out here make you think anything else the reason why that picture in 1950 with the pillow fire is so profound was not just because it was a supernatural picture that they can't prove why the light was there but it's more than that it was scripture Made Alive in our day it was the Scripture it was the same Pillar of Fire that struck Paul now it was the same thing amen the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel that's why it's important it was the same Pillar of Fire that Abraham saw that night and a deep sleep fell on Abraham and the pillar of fire started walking through what did he say he said I have made thee a father of Mighty Nations God wanted Abraham so secure that he took Abraham out of the picture said he said Abraham I want you to make it so bad get out of my way I'm going to do it you see God did the same thing for you you said brother Stephen I really wish I could read that I'm so glad you asked it's actually in Romans 4. it's in Romans 4. listen I told you it's going to be an audible service today didn't I watch us Romans 4 oh wow we gotta read a little bit that's all right Romans 4 verse 16. watch this here Romans 4 16. thereof it is the faith that it might be by grace to the the to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that which is also the faith of Abraham who's the father of us all and it is written I have made thee a father of many nations that's what he went through right that was the promise he made it's an unconditional promise okay no so let's keep reading before him whom he believed even God who quickened the dead and called those things was not as though they were you what did he do he called those things which were not as though they were what are you doing well what are you doing you need to start piping up if you believe it say it [Applause] it ain't called thinking word it's called spoken word [Applause] you can sit here and hope all day until you make the confession how how long should I confess I would confess until it happened until glory to God he called those things which were not at though the world you know the world thought he was crazy well yeah a man hundred years old gonna have a kid going to be a father of many nations and have one son how is this going to happen he looked crazy you're going to look crazy when you start believing the word and stop believing this We Believe ourselves so much oh I tell you what I say you just die to yourself this morning and start believing what God did [Applause] God could change a hundred man year 100 year old man to have a kid what can he help you with your problems then all right when God brother Ben taught us when God is there there is Supernatural we spent so much time trying to figure things out yeah but you can't take Supernatural and stick it on our microscope quit looking for it with your hands believe what God can do don't worry about the explanations don't worry about that stuff so much amen just like Abraham here he called those things which were not as though they were so do it if it really is if you really believe it say it amen watch us verse 19. no I'm sorry verse 18. who against hope believed in Hope see he was crazy to the world against hope I mean there's no hope for this guy oh he's gonna do it even against that he believed in it still oh you see what I'm saying we always thought we want to go higher what does that really look like when you really want to go higher in God it's going to look contrary to your human mind the carnal mind is enmity against God so quit listening to this thing amen amen this thing ain't gonna help you at all this is what's going to help you right here I'll tell you what I might have to hit the altar this morning that burned me up a little bit amen spending so much time with this thing not with who we really are amen watches who against hope believe in hope that he might become the father of many nations amen according to that which was spoken so that's our seed be and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dad remember this is the father of Faith he's our father amen so this is how we Act amen who considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither the Genesis Arizona he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God brother Stephen what should I do when I believe so I praising him about it did he do it or not you see what I'm saying uh everyone wants to sometimes well I know you won't raise your hand so I'm not going to ask you to do it but sometimes we blame god without thinking we are sometimes we blame ourselves true we blame everything else but it only comes down to Faith you're telling me think about like this you know sometimes we put so much stock into what the devil can do God's stronger than devil and I know that sounds simple you're like of course you act like that then you know what I mean God's on your side God's your ally God's your friend God's the boss amen God can do it all he never can't just do anything he wants he has to ask God first amen give too much credit to the devil sometimes amen do you believe it or not giving Glory he says strong in faith giving glory to God what should I do then Stephen if I really believe it well praise him about it spend some time worshiping tell people we know the story of that brother who was blind and went through the prayer line and got prayed over then he ended up in the prayer line and he said I still blind his motorcycle still blind being prayed for to not be blind anymore he said he's what did that man say I'm still blind and brother bear said I thought you believed me what was the actual issue faith was it even the blindness the issue was the faith and what did the man said he said I do believe you but what do I do that he said go tell people about it then did it happen or not amen and he did it for two weeks you know we're reading the end of the story could you imagine being him in the middle of week one blind as a bat going glory to God good news remember he was a paper boy right here's the paper I can see that's supposed to be an example of how we ought to act you say brother Stephen I don't know if I'm allowed Let Freedom Ring you were free from sin and shame to be able to do that [Applause] glory to God verse 20 stagger not of the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was also able to perform [Applause] I think it's time for us to get a little more convinced than we were yesterday get convinced of God I think I said this last time I was here amen you know God can still talk God can still speak to you if you are really not convinced that getting his presence and go find out whether God could do it or not amen God is greater you know the Bible says he can do exceedingly abundantly above all you can possibly ask or think so anything you could ever come up with that would be the best thing for you God is still better than that I'm saying this so God can do it for you too amen the issue is not the promise the issue's not God the issue is right here what do you believe remember when he cursed the fig tree and the disciples came to look how fast his fig tree was cursed what did Jesus say he said have faith in God for you could say to the mountain be thou removed and no doubt in your heart but believable you have asked for and you shall receive what you've asked for foreign all things are possible to them that believe a-l-l- oh do you know what all means it means without exception oh I don't know what's going on today but I feel like just hitting that some more amen you know brother Brandon even struggled about that scripture say to the mountain he even struggled with it he was asking God about that scripture it's Mark 11. he was asking God and God brought the interpretation to him and he was inspired and what did God say your squirrel hunting aren't you he met God met him where he was at said you're squirrel hunting aren't you it's like yeah I am how many squirrels are going to be this is the interpretation of Mark Levin how many scores could it be they're going to be three okay that's great they're gonna be three okay where are they you see God had to pull it right out of him didn't he amen and we know the story right he found the three School membrane remember he only made two and he thought that was good enough and he started walking away and got him uh you said three [Laughter] glory to God in Hallelujah see God didn't do that just for brother Branham you know this is this message was given to us for us to learn by an example do you know why that was so important for God to show up to brother Brandon like that for you that he is going to tell you what does Mark 11 mean amen ask what you will that your joy may be filled you are free to do it that's the whole point amen you don't have to sit here and beg and hope and plead it is your right the Jesus said the kingdom of God suffered the violent and the violent take it by force why are you still sitting there it's your promise rise up and take it amen [Applause] I tell you what sometimes we spend so much time depressed about things we spent so much time about this stuff sometimes and I'm not saying it ain't real but do you realize depression and worry makes no sense for you to have I mean when you think logically if God's really in control of everything and God is your ally and your friend and he's taking care of everything what is the Bible is just perfect love cast out fear of course it's real of course worrying and depression is real I'm not saying it ain't real but also makes no sense why we do it right if you just think about it for a second and go wait a minute I'm a son of God what is there for me to fear I win you know what I mean we we win we're not on the losing side what does the Bible say the Bible says we are more than conquerors through Christ how are you more than a conqueror you look at the old stories of Wars you know you look at Napoleon Bonaparte and so forth and these these people who went to war Alexander the Great and so for like that when they would go to war they would go to that fight not knowing who would win oh sure they could have confidence in themselves and in their skills and in their armies but they didn't have an assurity but you're more than a conqueror why when you go to war you have assurance you have assurance that you win and that's why you're more than a conqueror right now why you've been freed to do it now we read a lot of this about Abraham here right and that sounds great for Abraham don't it but watch what Paul says here and I like we'll go back to verse 21 and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone huh it wasn't just written for Abraham all that stuff that happened to Abraham wasn't just for him so it was for somebody else well I wonder who it was then who else was this for but if for uh now to him that it was written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but for us also wait a minute Abraham went through all that stuff of an unconditional Covenant so forth for you why so you would understand that you have the same thing you have an unconditional Covenant with God you want unconditional means I know it sounds so simple I know you know what it means but when you're walking in your life why is it the first thing you forget unconditional means without conditions it means it happened you know you look you look at when God went to Adam he said if you don't eat off that tree when you went to Noah it was that if if all these other characters but when he went to Abraham he didn't say if he said I have you know Abraham Abraham wasn't necessarily doing everything right all the time now you remember uh one time he uh remember he saw the fires hit Sodom and Gomorrah remember he even pleaded for the people didn't he yes Lord if there be ten we found out there wasn't even 10 in that City there's really only one and you know God had enough thought for that one still isn't that oh I tell you what the mercy of God sometimes lot gets a bad rap sometimes you'll remember this when you're dealing with people out in the world okay because it's easy for us message folks listen I live around you quite a while okay it's easy for message folk to get a little high mind into their mind when you're looking at other people out here you look at a lot what did Brother Rams say about lot he said he was his denominational brother can you call somebody your denominational brother and God had enough thought of him to at least get him out of Sodom and Gomorrah Peter called him righteous and just oh is that something now remember he was Abraham was he Abraham was a silver dollar lot was a penny but God still had enough Grace for that penny aren't you thankful for that [Applause] I'd be able to see you know they might believe in three gods and so forth like that but they're following how much they got brother said leave them alone you don't know they might be a penny all right amen amen I think we get we get a little uh spoiled sometimes you look at brother bran when he preached how many messages do you preach in two I mean Jeffersonville maybe Arizona maybe a pair of green and that's about it you want to mean and yet you look at how he acted towards people that's how I want to act [Applause] you know what I mean yes yes we get sometimes we get too messy oh well gee I'll tell you what I'm might get in trouble this morning hope Sam I hope you can feel what I'm saying yeah is that sometimes we get so message you we forget about other people you know you know it's only by the grace of God you even had a chance to hear this right right so what about them how are they going to hear about it then don't don't forget amen about those lost souls out there that's the most important part amen and that was free this morning but we're just I don't I don't want listen sometimes we get so we we forget about other people out there why are you here for all right you know what I mean what are you here for are you here just to warm up you you know what I mean what does it mean when we say we work for God if you love God and you're working for him what does that look like what do you do well what is the what did uh John say when you love God's children you love him amen so when you help God's children you're actually helping God amen the Bible calls us co-laborers with him you can actually help God by helping somebody else know more about him then don't ever be ashamed of the message that we have don't ever be ashamed don't ever let the world make you feel bad about what you believe all right amen they're dying out there and you might have the words of life to save them don't ever be ashamed don't ever be scared to pipe up can I give you a little advice I hope you don't mind this okay when you witness to somebody you're not going to send them to Second hell amen they're already on the wrong road if they ain't saved by Jesus Christ they're already on their way to hell so how can you how can you shame them more into more hell you see what I'm saying you can take the truth you have eternal life in your hand and you can hand it to somebody else what did Peter say when he went to gay beautiful and saw that lame man he said such as I have I give make sure you got it first now but when you got it start using it amen Amen Let Freedom Ring amen give them the chance to be free too see this Freedom was not written just for Abraham this unconditional Covenant wasn't just written for Abraham it was for your sake as well for you to know that there's no conditions on this Covenant that you have with God Amen you're gonna make it when you trust and believe on him then of course you're going to make it God can't fail but when you start leaning on yourself and looking at yourself you go there ain't no chance for me to make it and it's like well of course there's no chance for you to make it you're trying to do it but when you lean on him lead not to thy own understanding when you lean on him stop living on this and leaning on this how can you miss it that [Applause] foreign Let Freedom Ring God sent you the Holy Ghost to free you from even those mind battles stop spending so much time in your head I know this is what happens to people I know what it is amen you get one little thought somebody looked at you weird you did something wrong and so forth and you just let it churn amen like you're turning butter and you're just looking pounding a pounding and what happens it gets thicker and thicker and harder to dig out if you would just thrown it out when it was milk it's easy to get rid of that are you just sitting there at the mail this is all free praise the Lord you thought you're gonna get something deep nope you're getting churning butter you're turning your problems making them bigger and bigger and more a mess amen and then you have to explode sometimes well why because you build it up it was just one little small little thing get rid of it you're free this morning amen glory to God in Hallelujah you're free this morning amen here let me read some scriptures to you watches John 1 verse 12 to 13 John 1 12-13 the scriptures but many as received him to them give you power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of the flesh nor the will the man but of God Amen go back to that verse 12 sister that verse 12 there watch this he that is or to them gave you power to become the sons of God that can be hard to understand based upon what we just said this morning that you weren't you didn't become a son when you received the Holy Ghost you were freed okay but that word power up there is a little different Greek word Greek actually has multiple words for power amen one of them is dunamis and what that means is literally a force amen it's a uh you know the nine spiritual gifts one of them is the worker of Miracles that were Miracles is dunamis power it's a force so it does something amen amen but that word power up there ain't doing a mess it's exosia and what does that word exocia mean it means freedom it means Liberty isn't this something that you look at America you know you look at them for thousands hey man well I'm gonna quote a movie okay you forgive me for this it's Ten Commandments okay well the ram said though you ought to watch Ten Commandments I got the quote just so you know okay but I'm just I would go in that movie he quotes it right God made man but man-made slaves okay the world has been nothing but controlled by Slaves by Emperors by rulers until this last day when a bunch of pilgrims showed up in America and created a constitution for freedom for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness and it just showed up in this last days why did this country just show up last day and its main listen I know it ain't the same as it was then but it was built upon that idea of freedom amen of Freedom man living in Freedom why in the last day God was going to send a message and he brought it out of that same country and what message did he bring freedom you're not bound anymore but God gave you the freedom to be a Son of God God Gave You Liberty to be a son of God amen you can't quit putting chains on you you know what I mean I know sometimes we we like to blame the devil and everything else but sometimes it's our fault why we put the chains on our neck hey man sometimes it's your fault why you're bondage you if you would just drop the chains you see brother Stephen though you don't know the sins I did I don't even need to know do you believe there's only one sin unbelief your sins ain't stronger than God who glory to God in Hallelujah your sins ain't that strong God's still stronger [Applause] quit throwing yourself in the jailhouse you know what I mean quit throwing yourself in prison sometimes you get yourself in prison you fall asleep like Peter did one day Peter ended up in jail and he fell asleep in jail Paul I tell you what we gotta stop falling asleep in jail you know why an angel showed up but Peter didn't see the angel why he was sleeping why aren't you glad for the grace of God [Applause] because even when you fall asleep in jail do you know what God's gonna do he's gonna send you an angel you don't even know it's happening Peter didn't know the angel was there until what the angel had him in the face smoked him and said get up Peter you ain't supposed to be in jail glory to God Amen you ain't supposed to be in jail either you start falling asleep in all your depression and anxiety and so forth God's gonna send an angel maybe God sent this Angel this morning Amen to smooth you on the cheek and say get up you're free in the blood of Jesus [Music] he gave you freedom to be a Son of God stand up and act like it then oh you love the Lord Let Freedom Ring you know what that means it's actually kind of interesting I don't know if you know this that phrase comes from a song um America the Beautiful I believe or or My Country Tis of the sweet land of liberty and so forth like that that freedom Reign Martin Luther later quotes it in this I Have a Dream speech and I like the there was a little commentary on it and I really liked how it's seti here what does that what Freedom Ring means and it says the phrase in using the meaning of the verb to ring to make or cause to make clear a vibrating sound metaphorically Freedom itself is not a sound but letting Freedom Marine means to exercise your freedom clearly and openly in this case by sending you for just cause in a non-violent way see when I say Let Freedom Ring it is not good enough for you to go oh I'm so glad to know I'm free and just let it sit in your lap if you want to be free then you got to stand up and accept it as a fact in your life no matter the circumstances said he said he said God has made you a master of all circumstances you say brother Stephen uh I got a lot of circumstances oh how do I master it's not that you control the circumstances that makes you a master it's that the circumstances can't do anything to you about what you believe [Applause] that no matter what the circumstances no matter what the situation amen I'm gonna lift up my hands we singing this morning in English hey man I'm gonna lift up my head I'm free I'm free from all this amen glory to God in Hallelujah trials to free you there's three Hebrew children who are going through a fiery furnace amen there are walking in Satan's eating they had an image of Daniel they would not bow down to amen kind of like what they've done in this message sometimes amen there is an image of gold that they refuse to worship why only Jesus receives My Worship [Music] amen and they bound them in circumstances amen they bound them but he could not keep them there amen and God sent him through a fiery trial remember they were walking the whole time all right we're sending you to the fiery furnace remember that fire was seven times hotter uh God knows how to do it right like seven Church ages amen the heat of seven Church ages what it did produce it produces Satan's Edith here we are aren't we seven churches and we're in here and Satan's eating and the whole time they're walking what are they doing they take one step no God take one step no God take no step no God you know they had to walk all the way over there God never showed up all right amen but it didn't change what they believed see what I'm saying they mastered the circumstance oh I tell you what I hope you hear the voice of God this morning Hallelujah I have never connected that this morning the whole time they were mastering they didn't look like it but they had a master the whole time no matter how bound it worked they didn't change what they believed of God the whole time [Applause] and finally they kept walking didn't they and they finally ended up in that fiery furnace and all sudden I wanted Nebuchadnezzar looked in a little bit I saw a flutter of a cloth or something whoa that's weird it's a fiery furnace how could there be a piece of cloth flying looking in there what elbow Dia guard hey what's going on here guard's like I'm just doing my job what are you talking about you know he's like well I thought we only threw three people in there glory to God in Hallelujah I thought we only threw three people in there he said we did is n't there oh Hallelujah right at the end in the fiery furnace was a horse man Can you feel it amen we all showed up this morning but there's one more man here this morning as Jesus Christ here amen there's a fourth man in the fiery furnace in your trial in your situation there is a floors man Hallelujah Hallelujah [Applause] and what's that fourth minute deal he said that three are bringing man Hallelujah [Applause] and in all those circumstances that fiery furnace all it could do to them will set them free oh Hallelujah oh you see what God wants to do in your life he wants to set you free this morning it is time to master the circumstance aren't you glad for that friends aren't you glad for that Fourth Man even when you're walking and sometimes you don't see him don't worry he's a little just a little ahead of you [Music] listen they were okay before the fire weren't they they were still alive God knew where they were going and God was already there before they showed up [Applause] God knows where you're going sometimes you may not see him here why because he's down the road a little bit because he knows where you got to go through and he's getting it ready for you oh you see that's why we don't need to be depressed anymore anxiety anymore that's why perfect love casts out all fear amen [Applause] glory to God if we just start leaning on him depending on him trusting in Him you will start to master all circumstances [Music] I say thank you Jesus Oh doesn't that just feel so wonderful see when you start mastering the circumstances when you start understanding like God is doing this morning for us don't you feel that burden lift off you a little bit [Applause] we sit here so much time and try to work out Christianity oh if I could just be a better Christian I'll get it if I'll just be a better person I can finally have the promise I hope this morning you start taking those chains off of you and just start trusting in Him and just believing what he said quit trying to figure everything out and just believe them just do it you know what I mean just do it brother Stephen it can't be that simple what if it was right remember the story Naaman when he went to get leprosy out of him yeah and they go and and and the prophet said go dip in the river seven times Naaman got mad about it why do we get mad about us could it really be that simple Damon's going could it really be that simple just dip in the river seven times and that guard had more sense than he did the soldier did and more sense he said if he asked you to do some big thing you would have done that right well you hear me church I hope you hear him if God would have told you how to do something think you do that what about this small little thing here what did Brother Brown say how do you get closer to God read your Bible and pray every day poor brother Stephen they can't be that simple what if it was could that get you closer to God could that make you more of a Christian that you keep thinking you need to reach man you see what I'm saying God asked you to do the little things you know sometimes we think the big things are just going to solve everything it's those little things it's the little foxes that spoil the vine oh my praise the Lord Jesus I'm here to tell you you're free this morning [Music] and then you need to start standing up and Let Freedom Ring here let me read a few more scriptures to you sure I just feel so good this morning don't you you see what she was saying when the burden just gets off you a little bit what did she what did Jesus said cast your care upon him oh he cares for you amen you know he said my yoke is easy and my burden is light it says he Jesus can't lie can he he can't lie so when you start feeling heavy that can't be him you see what I'm saying my yoke is easy what did Brothers say brother said people gotta fight their way into hell God has set it up in such a way now I know people take it too far and turn Grace in disgrace okay I know people are like that amen just don't be one of them it's still great you know what I mean you're only going to make it another man never called it rapturing law he never caught it rapturing uh a work he caught a rapturing faith and rapturing Grace that's what he called it you're not going to be you're not going to be Rapture because you worked yourself into the rapture I just read a quote today talking about brother babe use the term about uh men and women who are living wrong how are you going to call yourself a he called it enochist I thought it was the greatest thing I ever heard an enochist what does it mean to be an enochist I know there's a sermon in there hey man you might get the Prelude this morning amen I want to be an enochist too yeah amen and what is an enochus it's a man who just walks with God doesn't need to work anything up circumstances may come but he can still walk with God and he keeps on Walking with God and what God's gonna do one of these days he said he's gonna take that Highway and start putting up a little bit higher and you just keep on walking and you'll keep going higher and higher and higher until one day Hallelujah one day Enoch was walking with God and he was not for God took him amen I'll tell you what that's what I want to be I want to be enochist glory to God Amen just keep walking with God don't worry you'll make it amen Hallelujah oh praise the Lord Jesus thank you Lord God oh my God this Rapture is not going to be hard it's not going to be difficult amen we're gonna make it we are free as sons of God to make it how can you miss something that was made for you there's a scripture oh I don't know what it is about here but I just keep on talking and keep a talking who praise the Lord Jesus there's a scripture um and he saw the Sabbath day and he went you know that Sabbath day it needs people to worship it and that's why he made you to worship the Sabbath no he made you right he made his family and he looked at his family go they need a day of rest and that's why he made the Sabbath it wasn't that the Sabbath was made for man oh I'm sorry it wasn't that man was made for the Sabbath but it was the Sabbath made for man amen now look at the Rapture it wasn't like the Rapture was just existing somewhere and God needed somebody to do the Rapture no you're here you're here and God knew you'd be here and God knew there was going to be judgments come upon the Earth and he needed to get his children out of here so what'd he do he made a Rapture for you brother Branham said in the Rapture the Rapture is only for the bride [Applause] now see you got to start connecting are you the bride or not if you are the bride then you can replace the bride with you so who's the Rapture made for me that's why there's a Rapture that's why there's the first Thessalonians 4. that's why there's the First Corinthians 15. we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed you know why that's in the Bible me me because I'm here I am the interpretation of what he meant you know when you know what he said he said we shall not all sleep what he's got a mouse in his pocket you ever heard that before saying we got a mouse in your pocket no but there was somebody else there somebody else is going to be we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed amen so who's the we AK I am it's my promise amen I say left Freedom Ring you need to stand up and exercise your freedom in Jesus [Applause] Let Freedom Ring amen stand it is my rapture it is my promise it is it's for me you can't be raptured without me you better be able to say the same thing about yourself too now little joke me and Alex do I know you had Alex here Thursday Alex has been my buddy for a long time we even knew each other before we were saved and so me announcement buddies for a long time one time he called and Kerry picked up the phone and said no she was not here and uh Alex said well I know he didn't go no rapture I know he didn't go no Rapture why because I'm still here and he can't go in a Rapture without me and I can't go in a Rapture without him and I can't go into Rapture without you and you can't go in a Rapture without me Hallelujah what we shall not all Fleet but we shall be changed Hallelujah so rise up Brian you're a son of God steal your freedoms Master the circumstances and walk with God Amen [Applause] [Music] Hebrews 2 14. for as much then his children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil the devil is destroyed he's not being destroyed he's destroyed past tense it already happened it's already done stop giving him so much credit god reigns Supreme amen verse 15 and delivered them who through fear of death were all the lifetimes subject to bondage you're free amen First Corinthians 2 11-12 for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world you hear me when you got the Holy Ghost you were not filled with the spirit of the world amen but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us to us you see what I'm saying you have things that God gave you amen but they don't do no good until you start standing up and believing it hey man I'm not saying it's going to be easy all the time of course it's not going to be easy all the time your flesh is getting in the way but let the old man die amen let this guy just dead he's dead anyways Amen Let the old man die and let the new man live and what was the new man the new man is the word that new man inside of you is the word of God amen so this right here what about them teach us the Bible is a mirror amen so when you look at it it's going to reflect Who You Are
