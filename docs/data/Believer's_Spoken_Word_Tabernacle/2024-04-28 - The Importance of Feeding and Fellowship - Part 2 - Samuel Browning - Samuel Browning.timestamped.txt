[45:27] never um haven't met you know the

[45:41] us safe traveling mercies and as well as
[45:44] for the meetings that are there I know
[45:45] they're under great expectation and so I
[45:49] would just ask the Lord just that he
[45:51] would bless that let's look here in the
[45:53] scriptures um I want to begin reading at
[45:56] vers verse 8 um this as we start to look
[46:00] at it this is where the the first time
[46:03] as we said last week where Ruth would
[46:06] actually have a very personal encounter
[46:09] with Boaz she's in his field
[46:12] already um but she now is going to have
[46:16] a personal encounter as far as where
[46:18] he's going to speak to her then said
[46:21] Boaz unto Ruth hearest thou not my
[46:24] daughter go not to glean in another
[46:27] field neither go from thin but abide
[46:31] here fast by my
[46:32] maidens let thine eyes be on the field
[46:36] that they do reap and go Thou after them
[46:40] have not I charged the young men that
[46:43] they shall not touch thee and when thou
[46:46] art of thirst go into the vessels and
[46:48] drink of that which the young men have
[46:50] drawn then she fell on her face and
[46:53] bowed herself to the ground and said
[46:55] unto him why have I found Grace in thine
[46:59] eyes that thou should us take knowledge
[47:02] of me seeing I am a stranger what what
[47:06] humility is coming out of her heart and
[47:09] Boaz answered and said unto her it hath
[47:12] been fully showed me all that thou Hast
[47:15] done unto thy mother-in-law since the
[47:18] death of thine husband and how thou Hast
[47:21] left thy father and thy mother and the
[47:24] land of thy Nativity and art come to a
[47:27] people which thou knewest not hither
[47:30] toor the Lord recompense thy work now
[47:34] remember all of this that's been done
[47:36] that we just read that Boaz has taken
[47:38] knowledge of Ruth has not done this out
[47:42] of trying to earn
[47:45] merits remember as the prophet lays that
[47:48] out in the in the opening of the Holy
[47:49] Ghost series he said Ruth she was moved
[47:53] by that of a purpose of God that was
[47:55] moving her to make the decision she was
[47:58] making now Ruth had to make those
[47:59] decisions just like you and I have to
[48:01] make those decisions being a child of
[48:04] God an elect child of God a seed of God
[48:06] that doesn't remove making decisions
[48:08] that's what allows you to make the
[48:11] decisions you do as the influence of the
[48:13] Holy Spirit would come upon you to do so
[48:16] so only what's being worked out Boaz is
[48:18] taking notice of what has been already
[48:21] working out in Ruth's life then he says
[48:24] the Lord recompense thy Work and a full
[48:27] reward be given thee of the Lord God of
[48:29] Israel under whose wings Thou Art come
[48:32] to trust then she said let me find favor
[48:37] in thy sight my Lord or we can read it I
[48:41] believe I will find favor in thy sight
[48:45] for thou Hast comforted me now notice
[48:47] what real Comfort does real Comfort it
[48:49] isn't it brought her to a place it it's
[48:52] it how God is how it's Boaz is speaking
[48:54] to her hearest thou my daughter it's
[48:55] settling her it's giving her of a of a
[48:59] greater encouragement I shall I believe
[49:02] I shall find favor why for thou Hast
[49:05] comforted me for that thou Hast spoken
[49:09] friendly unto thine handmaid though I be
[49:13] not like one unto one of thine handmaids
[49:16] in verse
[49:17] 14 this is where we want to draw from
[49:19] again this morning and Boaz said unto
[49:22] her at mil time Come Thou hither and eat
[49:27] of the bread and dip thy morsel in the
[49:31] vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers
[49:34] now remember watch how her position she
[49:36] doesn't go and set in the middle of them
[49:38] or try to draw attention to herself she
[49:40] just in humility she sits down with the
[49:43] rest of them she is coming into places
[49:46] that she's being invited
[49:48] into remember when Jesus said when you
[49:50] come into a feast don't take the
[49:52] uppermost seat unless you're asked to
[49:54] step down but when you come in take take
[49:57] the lowest position then he that's
[49:59] governor of the feast will invite you
[50:01] into other places and that's the way it
[50:03] is with the Lord when we are serving the
[50:05] lord as God deals with our heart he
[50:07] invites us into justification invited
[50:10] into sanctification baptism of the Holy
[50:12] Ghost then the culminating as it works
[50:15] into the adoption so it's God always
[50:17] inviting us it's not us putting
[50:19] ourselves anywhere it's not us even
[50:21] meriting some someplace it's always just
[50:24] going where God has invited us I want to
[50:26] take up his invitation don't you brother
[50:28] BR would take a whole series on
[50:30] identification and preach and continue
[50:33] to use that same term invitation when we
[50:36] have an invitation for our character to
[50:38] be molded to his I I want to take that
[50:39] invitation don't you that's one
[50:41] invitation I want to
[50:44] RSVP and he reached her parched corn and
[50:49] she did eat and was sufficed and left
[50:53] let me read this quote to you before I
[50:54] let you be seated out of redeem demon
[50:56] Redemption this is a wonderful message
[50:58] if you haven't listened to it recently
[51:01] brother Bram says when it comes the
[51:04] midday and he said you get tired come
[51:07] over and sit down under the tree and
[51:09] take the morsel of bread and dip right
[51:12] in with the rest of them I like that
[51:16] that's Fellowship get around under the
[51:19] shade tree always says' don't you love
[51:21] to get under there and just dip right in
[51:25] with the rest of them amen may God bless
[51:28] you and bless the reading of the word as
[51:29] you're being
[51:31] seated pray the Lord will just help us
[51:33] this morning
[51:35] we want to just continue to look at this
[51:38] a point in this journey here within Ruth
[51:42] of the importance of feeding and
[51:46] fellowship and as I mentioned to you
[51:49] here last week to think of how that Ruth
[51:53] herself must have felt when here she is
[51:58] invited to eat at the table there with
[52:01] Boaz and the rest of the Reapers now
[52:03] Boaz really uh Ruth does not understand
[52:07] uh the magnitude of the situation she
[52:09] doesn't even she doesn't understand
[52:10] what's going on that's why brother Bram
[52:13] could say in things that are to be he
[52:14] says when you staggered to the altar in
[52:17] that mission that night he said you had
[52:19] no idea exactly what was taking place
[52:22] but it was God beginning to deal with
[52:24] your heart and then God God would lead
[52:27] you on from there and it becomes more
[52:29] real it's just like with every step you
[52:31] take with God you're always able to look
[52:34] back and see God's grace that has
[52:36] brought you to that place of submission
[52:38] but also to see in much of a greater
[52:41] measure the value of that decision or
[52:44] the value of the word coming in our
[52:46] lives Ruth and herself would this would
[52:48] be attributed very much in ways like
[52:51] that of a person who would come to know
[52:53] the Lord Jesus Christ as their lord and
[52:55] savior they would repent of their sins
[52:58] what a glorious reality that is I I
[53:00] remember when those burdens were lifted
[53:03] when there was a remitting of past sins
[53:06] and yet within it you know you can look
[53:09] at the word as Ruth herself is seeing
[53:12] this and my what a what a what a
[53:14] blessing this is that that I'm being
[53:15] that I'm being invited this way but she
[53:18] doesn't realize and doesn't know who
[53:21] this is she doesn't really see the
[53:23] magnitude of real of what it is as a
[53:26] Redeemer now many times this terminology
[53:28] is used very seemingly almost
[53:31] interchangeably and there's a part of it
[53:33] that is but it's it's used that way so
[53:35] much among the rest of the Christian
[53:37] World they'll use S salvation they'll
[53:39] use Redemption as almost interchangeable
[53:41] terms but yet it's not exactly
[53:43] interchangeable terms Redemption simply
[53:46] means to bring back what always belonged
[53:50] to that original owner and that's what
[53:52] Redemption is all about so we we
[53:55] understand that in order for that that
[53:56] Redemption it's more than just that
[53:58] moment at the altar it's more than just
[54:01] as we repent it's more than that but
[54:04] full Redemption full reconciliation is
[54:07] the same way that it was when the Bible
[54:09] says God was in Christ reconciling the
[54:12] world unto himself it's where deity
[54:15] itself the Holy Ghost comes on the
[54:17] inside of an individual and then they
[54:20] begin to experience the real effects of
[54:24] redemption that begins to move in their
[54:26] Life by way of the new birth where the
[54:28] desires of the world is gone and they
[54:31] are tied back into their representation
[54:34] Before the Throne of God and then is
[54:36] there that birth has come it's just like
[54:38] when you've come out of your womb or the
[54:40] womb of your mother just like myself I'm
[54:42] not the same size I was I don't look the
[54:44] same way but in order for that maturing
[54:46] to take place it doesn't happen inside
[54:49] of the womb it's got to be a birth and
[54:51] this is why that when we can see in in
[54:54] the way that the economy of God that we
[54:56] can see it in in that of a of through
[54:59] Galatians and brother Brandon would take
[55:00] countless messages on hear ye him and
[55:03] speaking to you and I in the hour in
[55:06] we're living in the time of the adoption
[55:08] of sons and to realize that the new
[55:10] birth is not the adoption but the new
[55:13] birth is that beginning in our life
[55:15] where we are born of the spirit of
[55:18] adoption that which will bring a
[55:20] maturing in our life as we yield to his
[55:24] molding his leading his Direction in our
[55:27] life and so to realize that you know
[55:30] within it all I I want to stay in a
[55:32] place to where I'm tender I want to God
[55:34] help me and and not not that it's about
[55:35] me but I I realize this old sticky
[55:37] carnal nature that I pack around with me
[55:40] I I know that I I know what it is to
[55:42] have to bring this man in subjection to
[55:44] the word and and get down and pray and
[55:47] and reach out and and die to myself I I
[55:49] know what that's like and I I don't
[55:50] believe I'm talking anything that's
[55:52] foreign to the rest of you but I want to
[55:54] live so I want to live close to him so
[55:56] when the things itself is beyond what my
[55:59] flesh or anything cuz my flesh cannot do
[56:02] it I want to live into such a place to
[56:04] where the spirit of God is able to so
[56:06] move into my life and help me in the
[56:09] moments when it's time for me to die
[56:12] more to Samuel that more of God can come
[56:15] into place because remember the adoption
[56:17] itself that in itself is not just
[56:19] something that's handed to us it was
[56:21] never handed to a son when he came oh oh
[56:24] well if I'm a Son of God and when he
[56:26] gets to a certain point no remember he
[56:28] had to be proven and God will allow
[56:31] situations to develop God will allow
[56:34] things to come our way remember Brother
[56:36] Brad will say it over and over and over
[56:38] through the message he said God will
[56:40] allow things to happen just to test our
[56:43] reaction to how we are going to react
[56:46] when certain things don't go our way or
[56:48] somebody said this this offended us or
[56:50] this didn't happen God will allow that
[56:53] and and what that what that is about
[56:55] that's about you and I dying it ain't
[56:57] about the other person it's not about
[56:59] fixing that other person so they're
[57:01] pleasing me and and not ruffling me no
[57:04] when we sense that ruffling that's just
[57:06] God letting us know son there's some
[57:08] more greenness to be baked out of your
[57:10] life that that that's a place to stay
[57:13] under the presence of God under the
[57:14] revealing of the word and what that will
[57:17] do is that'll take you from just a seed
[57:19] that's coming to birth till like it was
[57:21] prophesied regarding Gideon you will be
[57:24] a cake of Resurrection power that'll
[57:27] roll into the enemy's Camp that's what I
[57:29] want to be don't you brother B says I
[57:31] want to continue to have that greenness
[57:33] break out baked out of my life until I
[57:36] have become the bread on his table is
[57:39] that your desire that he would be a very
[57:41] partaker of the life that he's placed in
[57:44] your in in your life that's what real
[57:46] Thanksgiving remember the song We Sing
[57:48] and we know the scripture I think it's
[57:49] Psalms 100 I will enter into his gates
[57:52] with Thanksgiving in my heart that there
[57:54] is something where as Believers we come
[57:56] there were certain things to where a
[57:58] worshipper would come and actually eat
[58:00] there with the priest and it would be
[58:02] one of those as a Thanksgiving offering
[58:04] and they would eat in Thanksgiving of
[58:07] what of what God had blessed what God
[58:09] had provided for them and that's exactly
[58:12] what God promised to you and I at the
[58:14] end of this Gentile age he said that he
[58:16] would stand he's standing on the outside
[58:18] he's knocking on the door whosoever will
[58:21] open that door I will come in and suck
[58:24] with him what a what a beautiful reality
[58:26] that there is a Thanksgiving when God
[58:28] has really done something in your life
[58:31] then your life itself it is something
[58:34] where you have become a tabernacle that
[58:37] deity is dwelling in and what do you
[58:39] have Feast of Tabernacles you have God
[58:42] dwelling in temporary booths you have a
[58:45] feast going on on the inside in your
[58:49] life there is a Thanksgiving and and
[58:51] you're thankful to the Lord for
[58:53] everything that's taking place in your
[58:55] life that you see him doing that's
[58:57] something to really Rejoice about is't
[58:59] it amen now when I think of this with
[59:02] Ruth you know there's no doubt about it
[59:04] how she must have felt to when you know
[59:07] all of this the invitation was given and
[59:09] to know that it was not anything of her
[59:12] merits and there's no doubt that maybe
[59:14] something would have touched her heart
[59:16] to say oh I wonder if there's something
[59:18] else that that I could do is there
[59:20] something something more that I could do
[59:23] that would be natural you and I would
[59:25] have that same thing I remember when I
[59:26] first started to serve the Lord and some
[59:28] of the rest of you can relate to that
[59:30] too I remember when God be to deal with
[59:32] my heart in sanctification and how you
[59:34] know it set your mind in order for
[59:36] thinking on Holiness and and you're
[59:38] wanting to be it's just like it's almost
[59:40] like a hyper sensitivity to want to be
[59:43] right and you're asking is you know you
[59:45] think this sideburns all right you think
[59:47] this and there's just certain things
[59:48] about it because it's just so moving in
[59:50] your heart you don't want anything like
[59:53] that of the world what is that that's
[59:54] the spirit of God moving Upon Our Hearts
[59:57] setting our mind in order for Holiness
[1:00:00] and you know what that never leaves you
[1:00:02] as a Believer because then it moves the
[1:00:04] same spirit of God that moves upon your
[1:00:07] heart in that way then it moves to set
[1:00:10] down to where the very desires that was
[1:00:13] there that you're looking at and saying
[1:00:15] oh I I shouldn't do this because the
[1:00:16] word says this and you're you're
[1:00:18] honoring it you you you it's a loving to
[1:00:20] the Lord but it's not to the depth of
[1:00:22] love that God desires to do by the
[1:00:24] baptism of the Holy GH goes but it is a
[1:00:27] start and you're giving yourself to the
[1:00:29] Lord but eventually the things that you
[1:00:31] found yourself saying we I I I I can't
[1:00:35] do this and and and you know this
[1:00:36] shouldn't be done eventually it moves to
[1:00:39] such a higher level and really what it
[1:00:41] is is you've been raised into your
[1:00:44] rightful position and you're not just
[1:00:46] looking at this world down here but
[1:00:48] you're actually looking down on it
[1:00:50] because Christ himself has raised you
[1:00:54] above the love of the world and the
[1:00:56] things of the world I'm telling you
[1:00:58] friends the things that we can look at
[1:01:00] in the word of God we can see very
[1:01:02] clearly if the love of the world is
[1:01:05] still there in our hearts we've not yet
[1:01:07] arrived but let me encourage you keep
[1:01:11] pressing because the same God that has
[1:01:13] brought you this far will see you the
[1:01:18] rest of the way
[1:01:20] huah hallelujah hallelujah we're on a
[1:01:23] journey we're on a mission we're not
[1:01:25] leaving H
[1:01:28] behind are you hearing me yes sir so we
[1:01:33] understand that because even within our
[1:01:34] lives there's a there's a continuing on
[1:01:37] and a moving in the purpose of God and
[1:01:40] she was she was you know the spirit of
[1:01:42] God was drawing her and she was yielding
[1:01:45] and well you know as you begin to see uh
[1:01:47] with this scripture that we read here at
[1:01:50] meal time he had he spoke to her Come
[1:01:52] Thou hither now remember that moaz was
[1:01:55] not want to send down a delegation to
[1:01:58] Ruth and say Ruth it's meal time
[1:02:00] remember what Boaz said you you need to
[1:02:03] come on down we are going to carry you
[1:02:05] down there you don't just just get on
[1:02:07] this you know this place and we've got
[1:02:08] Bears that'll bear you down there no she
[1:02:11] was going to have to display her own
[1:02:14] obedience to the word of God God allows
[1:02:18] situations to come about in order for
[1:02:21] Faith to be displayed remember James
[1:02:23] could say well I have all Faith but
[1:02:25] James said if your faith doesn't have
[1:02:27] works then it's dead Faith itself it
[1:02:30] actually walks and operates not only
[1:02:33] from our heart but then it puts our feet
[1:02:35] in motion is that right so God could now
[1:02:39] Boaz could have done that Boaz could
[1:02:40] have said Ruth I'll tell you I feel so
[1:02:42] bad for you and how things have come and
[1:02:44] you and Naomi and you know but God
[1:02:46] listen friends when God deals with our
[1:02:48] life he doesn't come with a pity
[1:02:51] party are you hearing me now I know in
[1:02:53] this age it's almost like in this age
[1:02:56] it's almost like it's an age of pity me
[1:02:58] but that's a spirit that's not you
[1:02:59] that's a spirit of this age that's a
[1:03:02] spirit of entitlement are you hearing me
[1:03:05] what an amazing grace of God that God's
[1:03:07] going to take a people in
[1:03:09] Rapture Hallelujah because why not
[1:03:12] because I'm entitled but because I've
[1:03:14] been elected by the grace of God and God
[1:03:17] has moved upon my heart and his grace
[1:03:20] has come to you and I and give us Grace
[1:03:23] to override our own Rebellion
[1:03:27] that will be simply the grace of God
[1:03:29] Abraham did not provide that Ram up
[1:03:32] there God provided that Ram God let him
[1:03:35] go clear to the last
[1:03:39] moment did God not know what was in
[1:03:41] Abraham's heart did he not know he knew
[1:03:44] it but the Bible says in verse one of
[1:03:46] Genesis 22 then the Lord did tempt or
[1:03:50] aay Abraham the word a say is like when
[1:03:53] they drill down deep in the Earth for
[1:03:55] four samples and they bring it out and
[1:03:57] you can see the different layers and God
[1:04:00] knew it was laying there the whole time
[1:04:02] but God wanted to show in the end time
[1:04:06] the display that would be made Not only
[1:04:08] was that a reflection of Calvary but it
[1:04:10] also was a reflection of what God would
[1:04:14] do in the end time because what was
[1:04:16] offered up in Genesis 15 it came into
[1:04:20] manifestation again in Genesis 22 so the
[1:04:24] same Ram that has brought your salvation
[1:04:27] has brought your deliverance has brought
[1:04:29] you has brought everything that same Ram
[1:04:32] will provide a change of this Mortal
[1:04:35] body from one dimension into the next
[1:04:38] Dimension the same almighty God God
[1:04:41] speaking of an end time
[1:04:44] worken but through obedience God could
[1:04:46] have let Abraham Abraham I know I know
[1:04:48] no you don't have to go through all this
[1:04:50] can you imagine what he went
[1:04:52] through what he felt
[1:04:56] and here brother Braham dramatized that
[1:04:58] of how he wouldn't even let the alarm
[1:04:59] clock he wasn't going to hit the snooze
[1:05:01] button that morning because he didn't
[1:05:01] want to wake Sarah
[1:05:03] up he slipped on out and then when he
[1:05:07] got to that place to where that knife
[1:05:09] was pulled back ready and the angel of
[1:05:12] the Lord stopped him that's in the
[1:05:14] scripture God let him come clear to that
[1:05:17] very Place why to display that faith
[1:05:21] that says I'm going to take God at his
[1:05:24] word I don't know how it's going to work
[1:05:26] I don't know how God has not showed me
[1:05:28] this is how it's going to take place but
[1:05:30] I trust God completely and that's
[1:05:33] exactly where God calls the believer to
[1:05:36] in this hour when we can come to a place
[1:05:39] to where I don't have to know then
[1:05:41] what's going to happen next and happen
[1:05:43] next and happen next but to trust him
[1:05:45] that he said I'll never leave you nor
[1:05:48] forsake you but I trust him and I take
[1:05:51] him at his word he said he would heal me
[1:05:54] when I'm sick in my body how it's going
[1:05:56] to be that's not my business to figure
[1:06:00] it out my business is to take him at his
[1:06:03] word how is God going to sa my loved
[1:06:06] ones that's not my business to figure
[1:06:08] that out it's my business to take him at
[1:06:11] his
[1:06:14] wordl oh my and Me time Ruth come
[1:06:19] hither God is allowing even throughout
[1:06:21] all this chapter as if God gives us
[1:06:24] Grace to look at in coming Services
[1:06:26] you'll see God is allowing her character
[1:06:29] God allowing things to be tested even as
[1:06:32] if we go into Ruth chapter 3 God is
[1:06:34] allowing things to be displayed just
[1:06:38] like when God sent this message to you
[1:06:40] and I in this hour and to think how when
[1:06:42] God would send this message God would
[1:06:44] send a prophet with a word and knowing
[1:06:47] that it would be
[1:06:49] rejected it would be rejected they were
[1:06:51] not rejecting necessarily brother
[1:06:53] brandham they were rejecting the word
[1:06:57] they were rejecting the spirit of God
[1:06:59] that's the same thing Steven charged
[1:07:01] them with there that day when they got
[1:07:03] ready to Stone him he called them
[1:07:05] religious men he said but you do always
[1:07:07] resist the Holy Ghost even as your
[1:07:10] fathers I tell you friends that's why
[1:07:12] it's got to be more than just knowing
[1:07:14] the letter knowing the written word
[1:07:16] you've got to know the person of Jesus
[1:07:19] Christ this message is not about books
[1:07:22] and tapes and pictures this message is
[1:07:25] about Jesus Christ Living in your
[1:07:30] life that's the real
[1:07:33] gospel that's why the prophet could
[1:07:35] through a Litany of quotes say that he
[1:07:37] said the Bible itself is not altogether
[1:07:40] the gospel because the gospel is the
[1:07:43] Living Word of God this word was meant
[1:07:46] to
[1:07:49] live and it takes the same spirit of God
[1:07:52] who gave it to breathe upon that
[1:07:58] word it's like the valley of dry bones
[1:08:01] but come hither Ruth come
[1:08:04] hither now I would say that there
[1:08:08] probably was times that Ruth because it
[1:08:12] went on for
[1:08:13] days maybe the first time after this is
[1:08:17] spoken to man the first time she was
[1:08:20] like
[1:08:21] man man my goodness what favor Lord you
[1:08:25] given me but I wonder as the days went
[1:08:28] on aches from gleaning because Boaz
[1:08:31] didn't come and glean for her he wasn't
[1:08:34] going to he wasn't Boaz was not going to
[1:08:36] maintain her personal walk for her she
[1:08:41] was going to have to do that so even
[1:08:44] with this right here I wonder if there
[1:08:47] were times that where Ruth said man I
[1:08:50] don't feel like
[1:08:51] it I'm just I'm just going to take a
[1:08:54] break right here I'm I'll sit right
[1:08:57] here now you know I'm preaching down
[1:09:00] where we're
[1:09:01] at because we still walk in this flesh
[1:09:04] let me just tell you you could look
[1:09:05] around this room right here you could
[1:09:07] pick out veterans and everything else
[1:09:09] that's been serving the lord different
[1:09:11] ones that let me tell you something
[1:09:11] right now if I asked you to write on a
[1:09:13] piece of paper those that you could
[1:09:14] count on to be here every service would
[1:09:16] you be on that
[1:09:18] list would you be oh don't look at me
[1:09:21] straight like that I'm asking you the
[1:09:23] question we we look so many times on
[1:09:26] other things but what I'm trying to get
[1:09:27] you to see is friends it's not about
[1:09:30] attendance just coming physically but
[1:09:32] I'm trying to get you to see what do you
[1:09:34] think the battles is even for those who
[1:09:37] come here on a service after service
[1:09:41] basis some of them satting right here
[1:09:43] and got tests later on that night some
[1:09:45] people sitting here they got pressures
[1:09:47] going on the job they got illnesses in
[1:09:49] their body they have things going we
[1:09:51] don't come to the house of God because
[1:09:53] it's convenient and if feels good and
[1:09:56] it's the easy thing to
[1:10:00] do there are religions of
[1:10:03] convenience some of them even you only
[1:10:05] got to hit a
[1:10:07] button now
[1:10:10] streaming streaming is a wonderful thing
[1:10:13] but it will never take the place of
[1:10:15] fulfilling Hebrews 10 right
[1:10:19] never do I believe yeah I know there's
[1:10:21] there's situations even sometimes of
[1:10:23] individuals that stream here but but
[1:10:25] listen You'll never ever you can ask any
[1:10:28] that I would find out about you could
[1:10:29] ask them if I don't encourage them to
[1:10:32] get with a fellowship of
[1:10:34] Believers that's true it's important my
[1:10:37] brother and sister I understand
[1:10:39] sometimes there can be circumstances and
[1:10:42] things that's come about but let me tell
[1:10:43] you something it's more than just about
[1:10:46] us feeding on the word of God is not
[1:10:48] just about you and you alone you have
[1:10:51] your own personal walk with God but God
[1:10:54] has called us to come and set together
[1:10:57] as a flock a flock that he has purchased
[1:11:01] with his own
[1:11:04] blood
[1:11:06] Hallelujah so yeah brother Samy do well
[1:11:09] I mean know have streaming do I believe
[1:11:11] it yeah I believe in streaming but I
[1:11:12] don't believe in streaming takes the
[1:11:14] place of having a local church that you
[1:11:18] assemble with I couldn't and be a Bible
[1:11:20] believer that's right
[1:11:25] I couldn't I couldn't do that and be a
[1:11:26] message believer that's so good I I to
[1:11:29] me my desire is listen my desire is not
[1:11:32] I don't care whether I'm the one
[1:11:33] standing here preaching or not I love to
[1:11:35] come together with God's children I love
[1:11:37] to come together when I'm sitting
[1:11:39] sometimes maybe in another meeting and
[1:11:41] I've got one or two services but I love
[1:11:43] to set there in glean from the ministry
[1:11:45] and the rest of the body that is there
[1:11:48] the spirit of God do you realize that
[1:11:50] the spirit of God while we're here is
[1:11:52] not just a one-way track he is moving
[1:11:55] throughout this assembly let me tell you
[1:11:58] something what will determine if he
[1:11:59] moves on you is your attitude whether or
[1:12:02] not what kind of attitude you have it'll
[1:12:05] just skip right over and it'll keep
[1:12:07] moving but you know what whether I'm in
[1:12:09] need or not somebody else is in need God
[1:12:11] help me to be sensitive that the spirit
[1:12:13] of God will have a conduit to flow
[1:12:16] through me to the next for what so that
[1:12:18] a chain of faith can be
[1:12:22] built what should I do Ruth come
[1:12:25] at me
[1:12:31] time and this is what I want you to do
[1:12:33] eat of the bread the bread is what staff
[1:12:36] of life I want you to eat of it I don't

[1:12:52] delicious my the you know the steam
[1:12:54] rolling off oh in that no God didn't
[1:12:56] call us together to talk about the
[1:12:58] message are you hearing me sometimes
[1:13:01] friends listen this is where it becomes
[1:13:03] very very crucial to our lives sometimes
[1:13:05] there's things listen I think it ought
[1:13:07] to be when we leave the house of God
[1:13:08] there's things that God has spoken so
[1:13:10] personally to each and every one of us
[1:13:12] in a certain degree but listen friends
[1:13:14] don't just get caught up in the moment
[1:13:16] don't get caught up in Emotion but you
[1:13:18] make sure that you're feeding from God
[1:13:21] and there's things being taken down into
[1:13:23] your soul not just wow that that was a
[1:13:25] great service why was it a great service
[1:13:28] why why was it a great service well
[1:13:31] because of this because of that no no
[1:13:33] it's got to be a great service because
[1:13:35] you had a meeting with God wonderful
[1:13:38] things I love to see God deal with lives
[1:13:40] work with lives bring conviction I love
[1:13:42] to see God filled with the spirit of God
[1:13:44] but every service it's about a Divine
[1:13:47] appointment between you and God and with
[1:13:49] the rest of the body remember the sons
[1:13:52] of God were to come and present thems
[1:13:55] three times out of the Year and that
[1:13:58] three times out of the year in the feast
[1:14:00] it would represent that of Son of God
[1:14:03] Son of Man son of David in every
[1:14:05] dispensation in every Church Age The
[1:14:08] Sons and Daughters of God have been
[1:14:10] assembled by the voice of almighty God
[1:14:13] this is why the scripture said he that
[1:14:16] hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what
[1:14:18] the spirit saith unto the churches
[1:14:21] you've not been assembled by man amen
[1:14:25] you've been assembled because you have
[1:14:27] been blessed and ordained and chosen to
[1:14:30] hear the voice of the just
[1:14:34] one you've been
[1:14:38] ordained
[1:14:46] hallu Hallelujah
[1:14:56] and I want you to dip dip your
[1:14:59] morsel in the vinegar now I don't know
[1:15:02] about you now if this offends you this
[1:15:04] ain't nothing spiritual on this part
[1:15:06] that I'm going to say but if it offends
[1:15:07] you you forgive me but I don't like
[1:15:10] sharing salsa bowls when I go to Mexican
[1:15:12] restaurants oh no you get your
[1:15:16] own why cuz I've seen double
[1:15:20] Dippers I I told you it ain't nothing
[1:15:23] spiritual but you see there is certain
[1:15:25] times and certain things that we are we
[1:15:29] are coming together this was not where
[1:15:32] Boaz had individual bowls handed out
[1:15:35] here so you can just be to yourself here
[1:15:38] so you can just be to yourself but to
[1:15:40] dip the bread Hallelujah as you reach
[1:15:43] break it off and dip it there in that
[1:15:47] soof man I can almost taste that herbs
[1:15:50] and stuff now Lord have mercy I'm
[1:15:53] thinking of certain restaurants writing
[1:15:54] Lord help me
[1:15:55] and you break that off and you dip it in
[1:15:57] there and you just try to get them herbs
[1:15:58] off of there onto that olive oil that's
[1:16:00] there and that vinegar and that in there
[1:16:02] my you eat that see you're you're you're
[1:16:05] eating off it's together it's Community
[1:16:08] Bowl it's a time when we're coming
[1:16:10] together to Feast on the word of
[1:16:14] God I want you to think of this the
[1:16:17] scripture tells us in Hebrews chapter 10
[1:16:20] remember brother B would admonish us
[1:16:22] that when a person has first given their
[1:16:24] life to to the Lord I read you many
[1:16:25] quotes on that last week of even when a
[1:16:27] life has has come to the Lord find a
[1:16:30] good church home but he wasn't just
[1:16:31] saying find a place that's called a
[1:16:33] church he said find a good Full Gospel
[1:16:35] Church that'll lead you on to the
[1:16:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost that believes
[1:16:40] in the spirit of God coming in and doing
[1:16:42] a work that believes in the Full Gospel
[1:16:44] pray over that brother R would tell us
[1:16:46] later in choosing of a bride pray over
[1:16:48] that church and so we notice that within
[1:16:50] this uh you know let me just say it like
[1:16:53] this I I really don't think in many
[1:16:54] times there's things where people do
[1:16:56] pray I think sometimes we just go by our
[1:17:00] feelings oh I just feel this and I feel
[1:17:02] that and that's why you have to look and
[1:17:04] say oh where where are you at now where
[1:17:07] are you at now oh oh you're oh you're
[1:17:09] over here oh that's where you are I
[1:17:11] remember my mom one time she didn't mean
[1:17:13] it I'm going to tell on her she didn't
[1:17:15] mean it but you know uh this there was a
[1:17:17] you know a noted individual that you
[1:17:19] know and that you never knew where she
[1:17:21] was going to be I mean she be at this
[1:17:22] church for a while and this church for a
[1:17:23] while and this church for a while listen
[1:17:25] friends I know sometimes there are
[1:17:26] certain circumstances let me just tell
[1:17:27] you what I got confidence in and what my
[1:17:29] prayer is is God let every child of God
[1:17:32] cuz I know I'm praying according to the
[1:17:33] will of God that they'll find their
[1:17:35] position in the
[1:17:38] body are you hearing me but you know she
[1:17:41] I walked up to the person she said and
[1:17:43] you know he didn't walk up to her that
[1:17:44] person came Oh Sister brownie so good to
[1:17:46] see you God bless you and it came out of
[1:17:49] my mom's mou so so where you what what
[1:17:51] church you at
[1:17:53] now and my mom said I wish I could have
[1:17:56] grabbed it and put it back in cuz my
[1:17:57] mom's not that kind of a person I'm not
[1:17:59] bragging her up she just my mom if
[1:18:00] there's anybody that can be ever so
[1:18:02] political in the way that they can
[1:18:04] strategically say things she's very very
[1:18:06] very very astute at that but after she
[1:18:08] said that she said I wish I could have
[1:18:10] grabbed those words she said I thought
[1:18:12] my Lord but you see that's what it was
[1:18:14] what was it it was the testimony that
[1:18:16] had already been lived out now you
[1:18:19] realize why God brings us together
[1:18:21] because we're going to rub one
[1:18:23] another right let me tell you what a
[1:18:25] Shepherd is for a Shepherd is not just
[1:18:28] for feeding the flock although you're
[1:18:30] not feeding off of me you're feeding off
[1:18:32] of him a Shepherd is to be in tune with
[1:18:34] god brother Ram said because he's
[1:18:36] feeding in the shepherd's place he
[1:18:38] should never leave that word but feed
[1:18:41] the sheep food what's sheep food sheep
[1:18:44] food is that food that is in season
[1:18:46] where the Dew has fallen and those
[1:18:49] particular plants have come up along
[1:18:51] those hillsides of Judea it is where the
[1:18:54] nutrients of the word is need is there
[1:18:57] for to change you and I from Glory unto
[1:19:00] glory in that moment God knows just what
[1:19:03] we need like I told you last week in
[1:19:05] Psalms 23 I listen this is just me I I
[1:19:08] think I can be free like this when
[1:19:09] brother Ram said we always used to think
[1:19:11] you know that heaven was someplace we
[1:19:13] were floating around you know on clouds
[1:19:15] and harps and everything else he said
[1:19:16] but since the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:19:18] we have found out that's not how it is
[1:19:21] at all it's not the ending here it's
[1:19:23] just that here we stay from here over
[1:19:25] there well that's the same way it was
[1:19:27] for me with Psalms 23 when it speaks of
[1:19:29] he leadth me in G Green Pastures you
[1:19:32] just think that my goodness because you
[1:19:33] think of the richness of the word you
[1:19:35] think of my there's nothing lacking with
[1:19:38] the word of God that's true that's true
[1:19:41] there is absolutely nothing lacking with
[1:19:44] the word of God but remember the Bible
[1:19:46] said there would come a famine in the
[1:19:48] last days in a famine not for bread and
[1:19:51] water but for the hearing of the word of
[1:19:53] God and the prophet would lay that in
[1:19:56] and step around in spiritual food and do
[1:19:59] season and say that's the spiritual
[1:20:01] drought that's on right now notice where
[1:20:04] the famine was at in the hearing of the
[1:20:07] word of God not only is the word to be
[1:20:10] heard but God give us Grace to hear what
[1:20:12] he's saying to
[1:20:14] usall are you hearing me so it's not
[1:20:18] just leading around and you know here we
[1:20:19] are like sheeps you know when we walk
[1:20:23] our bellies just rolling around walk
[1:20:26] from this pasture boy I'll tell you
[1:20:28] there's so much grass in here my good
[1:20:31] I'll just lay down no that that's not
[1:20:33] what Psalms 23
[1:20:35] is but when you Zone in on it and look
[1:20:37] at it as it is David would speak of it
[1:20:41] there's certain trails that are LED
[1:20:43] around those Mountain sides as they're
[1:20:44] leading them up into that table land but
[1:20:47] that table land like I told you last
[1:20:49] week is a place it's going to require a
[1:20:51] journey to get
[1:20:53] there but the Shepherd has gone before
[1:20:55] to clear out the
[1:20:57] obstacles out of the streams but he's
[1:20:59] not going to take away the hardness of
[1:21:01] sometimes a foot slips and and sometimes
[1:21:03] you hear a a lion roar sometimes you
[1:21:06] he's not going to take that away he's
[1:21:08] there to go with you all the way Amen in
[1:21:10] other words he's got a place prepared to
[1:21:12] take us to is that right and he's also
[1:21:15] provided like he said behold I've sent
[1:21:17] my angel to keep thee in the way and
[1:21:19] bring thee into the place that I
[1:21:20] prepared for thee God's God bringing us
[1:21:22] to that place but we realize a lot of
[1:21:25] this right here if it was like that can
[1:21:26] you imagine how that would be I mean
[1:21:28] here you are going from pasture to
[1:21:30] pasture and it's just nothing but lush
[1:21:32] green grass we would be so lazy more
[1:21:35] than we are now y that's good we would
[1:21:37] just be laying down and eating a little
[1:21:39] bit and burping and everything that
[1:21:41] that's not how it
[1:21:43] is you say hi brother samel where do you
[1:21:45] get that in scripture the Bible said ask
[1:21:48] and it shall be given to you knock and
[1:21:50] it shall be open seek and you shall find
[1:21:53] those Prin Les are always all the way
[1:21:56] through the word of God that's why God
[1:21:59] when he made a promise to restore Israel
[1:22:01] in Jeremiah 29 he said when you will
[1:22:04] begin to seek me with all your heart
[1:22:07] then I will be found of you how do you
[1:22:10] find god with a fully surrendered heart
[1:22:15] that's how you find
[1:22:16] God so God has has it set up that way
[1:22:19] that it's not just going to be me
[1:22:21] sitting here and looking around and
[1:22:23] saying hm M that looks awful good oh
[1:22:27] it's Prime too it two days so I I don't
[1:22:30] have to go out don't have to go out
[1:22:32] he'll just they'll drop it at my
[1:22:34] doorstep and Lord if you give me Grace
[1:22:36] to walk to the front door to open it I
[1:22:39] will try to put forth and exert there's
[1:22:41] enough
[1:22:42] energy sometimes I know there's certain
[1:22:44] blessings that certain things within
[1:22:46] that but you understand what I'm saying
[1:22:47] God's not doing that to us spiritually
[1:22:49] friend you with me you see sometimes the
[1:22:52] things like that that we look at and
[1:22:53] think oh that don't have no effect on me
[1:22:55] that don't you realize how it can get to
[1:22:57] such a place we're used to things we
[1:22:59] don't have to even go out to the store
[1:23:00] anymore it's things just dropped right
[1:23:03] in our lap and if it's not dropped in
[1:23:05] our lap well I went to service and my it
[1:23:07] didn't seem like the last service maybe
[1:23:09] God wants you to pray a little bit more
[1:23:11] and take those things and say God what
[1:23:14] you spoke to My Heart Lord Make It Real
[1:23:16] in my
[1:23:18] life but sometimes we want Prime
[1:23:22] drop as I told you last week and if God
[1:23:25] lets me tear terries and allows me to
[1:23:27] bring it I'll show you God never
[1:23:29] intended every single service to be a
[1:23:30] camp meeting service we need camp
[1:23:33] meetings we need Revival I've got quotes
[1:23:35] laying in front of me here we need them
[1:23:38] but God never intended us to live on
[1:23:40] Mountain Top Mountain Top Mountain Top
[1:23:42] Mountain Top Mountain Top and listen
[1:23:44] friends I'm afraid sometimes that that's
[1:23:46] too many are leaving on mountaintop
[1:23:49] experiences waiting for the next fix
[1:23:51] waiting for the next day when God really
[1:23:54] wants wants to establish his church when
[1:23:56] God sends a move of God when a Revival
[1:23:59] comes it's to do a work that'll keep you
[1:24:02] in the valley that you live in the
[1:24:04] valley like you live on the
[1:24:08] mountain but once again we're living in
[1:24:10] an age of just drop the package right
[1:24:13] here let me see who makes this
[1:24:17] revival yeah I'll take that one right
[1:24:19] there yeah we'll drop it from right here
[1:24:25] brother BR that's why he could say in
[1:24:26] the church ages he said I'm afraid he
[1:24:28] said too many have not recognized the
[1:24:31] effect of this last day
[1:24:35] Spirit where people would begin to get
[1:24:37] cold let down on the things of God
[1:24:41] because somehow we can get in our mind
[1:24:44] this comfort of well I'm in the message
[1:24:47] but let me just tell you the prophet
[1:24:49] said when you say you've got the Holy
[1:24:51] Ghost every gun out of hell is trained
[1:24:54] on you
[1:24:56] right he's not training it on on The
[1:24:58] ecumenical World sure there's certain
[1:25:00] things that there different ones could
[1:25:01] be experienced or one more but listen
[1:25:03] you know where Satan's fighting at same
[1:25:05] way he's fighting Israel like he's doing
[1:25:06] he'd like to wipe Israel off the map
[1:25:09] because he knows he cannot destroy God's
[1:25:11] word but Israel can't get her visitation
[1:25:14] until the bride has been taken home to
[1:25:16] Glory so where is Satan fighting the
[1:25:19] hardest psalms 27 the enemy who who came
[1:25:23] against me to consumed me stumbled yay
[1:25:26] stumbled and he
[1:25:28] fell Satan is against the revealed work
[1:25:32] of almighty god listen don't take it
[1:25:35] personal when you have well my boss said
[1:25:38] this or my so and so said that don't
[1:25:39] take it
[1:25:40] personal they can't help that there a
[1:25:42] spirit that's upon them but you need to
[1:25:45] recognize and be sure there's a
[1:25:47] different Spirit on the inside of you
[1:25:49] and it's not because of something that
[1:25:51] I've done but it's something that you
[1:25:53] can realize there's something deeper
[1:25:55] going on here a spiritual warfare listen
[1:25:58] brother Bram never did one thing to that
[1:26:00] maniac to caus that maniac to come up
[1:26:02] there you with me come me bringing down
[1:26:04] in our terms boots and leather brother
[1:26:06] brand wasn't showing up to work late
[1:26:08] brother brand was sitting around on a
[1:26:09] job brother BR W walking around from
[1:26:11] machine to sheine and doing everything
[1:26:12] else and you know talk to this and talk
[1:26:14] to that talk to this and all of a sudden
[1:26:15] the bus boss comes up and says we're
[1:26:17] going to have to discipline
[1:26:19] you glory to God I'm suffering for the
[1:26:21] gospel no you're not suffering for the
[1:26:23] gospel you're suffering because you've
[1:26:25] not submitted yourselves to the
[1:26:27] ordinance of men that is so
[1:26:30] good are you hearing me that's part of
[1:26:33] the fear of the
[1:26:34] Lord right that's part of all those
[1:26:37] things sometimes we wonder where why in
[1:26:39] the blessings of God why I'm this oh I'm
[1:26:41] being persecuted and it really has
[1:26:42] nothing to do with anything else but our
[1:26:44] own
[1:26:45] actions woo how did we get here if y'all
[1:26:48] seen where I'm at right here you know I
[1:26:50] ain't moved at all hardly really I ain't
[1:26:53] he moved
[1:26:55] but God
[1:26:57] knows God knows brother Bram did not do
[1:27:00] that that's why we check our own lives
[1:27:03] we check our own lives oh I tell you I
[1:27:06] would never have yelled at that boss I
[1:27:08] would never have done that but if you
[1:27:10] know I just got under his Spirit Well
[1:27:12] you still got to
[1:27:14] repent if you did something was wrong
[1:27:16] don't be blaming it on somebody else
[1:27:19] repent of it oh well if I my mom said
[1:27:22] you know I got under that influence
[1:27:24] don't you have a greater power on the
[1:27:26] inside of you don't there something on
[1:27:28] the inside that'll bring conviction and
[1:27:29] say though I might have been around in a
[1:27:31] wrong influence maybe you're standing
[1:27:33] around with a group of people and you
[1:27:35] joined in with things about the boss or
[1:27:37] with others you can't step back and say
[1:27:40] well that was just those guys and I got
[1:27:42] under their Spirit you've got to take
[1:27:44] responsibility for your own life and
[1:27:47] your own walk with almighty God you see
[1:27:50] what happened if you keep blaming other
[1:27:52] people it'll continue like it has all
[1:27:54] the way down through your life where
[1:27:56] you're looking for somebody else to
[1:27:58] blame what's going
[1:27:59] on Lord have
[1:28:02] mercy y'all probably be glad that I'm
[1:28:05] taking off aren't
[1:28:07] you don't worry we'll sail
[1:28:11] back verse 23 of Hebrews
[1:28:14] 10 let us hold
[1:28:17] fast the profession of our faith without
[1:28:21] wavering for he is faithful
[1:28:25] that promised now notice let us hold
[1:28:28] fast he's faithful but let us hold fast
[1:28:32] the profession of our faith without
[1:28:36] wavering I have believed God has given
[1:28:39] me Grace to believe let us hold fast the
[1:28:43] profession of our faith now you know
[1:28:46] this as Bible readers you can go through
[1:28:48] this of the New Testament you'll find it
[1:28:50] over even in the seven Church ages God
[1:28:52] at different times will talk about how
[1:28:53] they have received his faith it'll talk
[1:28:56] about how God has gifted a man a Measure
[1:28:58] of Faith is that right then you'll find
[1:29:00] where it also God will come back around
[1:29:02] and brother Bram say notice here in this
[1:29:03] verse to the church age he's not talking
[1:29:05] about his faith now he's talking about
[1:29:07] their faith thou Hast been faithful thou
[1:29:11] has been faithful he's not faithful to
[1:29:14] forget thy labor of love that's well you
[1:29:18] say well how would that come about it's
[1:29:20] got to be his faith well his faith
[1:29:22] moving upon our life and moving in our
[1:29:24] life it causes us should our desire
[1:29:26] should be Lord help me to yield to what
[1:29:29] is the invisible becomes
[1:29:31] visible right it it it becomes visible
[1:29:34] through our lives and you know what he
[1:29:36] who gave us the strength gave us the
[1:29:37] grace turns around at the end and
[1:29:39] rewards us for doing what for simply
[1:29:41] submitting and yielding and saying here
[1:29:43] Lord I'll be a billboard for you right I
[1:29:46] I I'll be an example for you I'll be
[1:29:47] like a screen for you to
[1:29:50] display and let us consider one
[1:29:55] another to
[1:29:57] provoke unto love and to good works now
[1:30:02] there might be some of the good
[1:30:03] provokers but you got to be provoking on
[1:30:04] the right
[1:30:06] thing that word provoke means to
[1:30:10] incite in love that doesn't mean you
[1:30:13] know where the the minister or others
[1:30:14] around us sometimes are sitting around
[1:30:16] and you know they're just you know it's
[1:30:17] like those bubbles they have out nowaday
[1:30:18] or they've had them out since I before I
[1:30:20] was little you pull out the stick you
[1:30:21] know and you get them all over he a
[1:30:23] little boor a little girl and you know
[1:30:25] finally you get so bored with blowing
[1:30:26] out through this right here you end up
[1:30:28] you want a bigger one and and you go on
[1:30:30] and on but you realize that with in
[1:30:32] these very things here that sometimes
[1:30:34] where God will operate and move these
[1:30:36] things to incite things is not just God
[1:30:40] moving and just blowing upon us but
[1:30:43] sometimes God's got to correct us he's
[1:30:45] got to speak to us and let us know hey
[1:30:48] hey hey hey hey I'm your
[1:30:50] father I I'm I'm the king you're my son
[1:30:53] remember like the remember like the
[1:30:55] slave that was in the field asked him
[1:30:57] what is it that you do for this guy I
[1:30:59] see him conduct himself in such a
[1:31:00] different manner what is it you got you
[1:31:02] give him a Temperpedic mattress nope
[1:31:04] nope he sleeps on the same makeb believe
[1:31:06] mattress that has Springs and everything
[1:31:08] else as everybody else do you give him a
[1:31:10] better meal nope he eats in the mess
[1:31:12] hall with everybody else oh do you give
[1:31:13] him preferential treatment in line nope
[1:31:15] he he does it all the time matter of
[1:31:16] fact there's times where I've seen him
[1:31:18] lay down his tray and clean up a mess on
[1:31:19] the floor and keep on with his tray and
[1:31:21] keep on going oh boy good what is it
[1:31:25] that you do different oh no it's not
[1:31:27] what I do it's what he's
[1:31:31] realized it's what he's recognized so
[1:31:35] you see what he's doing this young man
[1:31:38] is not about him no it's about who his
[1:31:42] father is so good and because he knows
[1:31:45] who his father is though his father is
[1:31:48] separated from him from Seas he is
[1:31:51] reflecting where his father is seated he
[1:31:55] is reflecting it down here in a bed of
[1:31:58] timej he's reflecting through his life
[1:32:02] that is so good now watch how this
[1:32:05] States here let us consider that means
[1:32:08] think of one another I realize friends
[1:32:11] we're living in a time and and please
[1:32:13] understand me we're living in a time
[1:32:14] right now we're doing good to
[1:32:17] remember when our bills are
[1:32:20] due am I the only one in here you just
[1:32:23] go over sometime s you look at things
[1:32:24] and thank God for online bill
[1:32:27] pay I mean it I mean it you know it it
[1:32:29] don't it sa cut down some times I can
[1:32:31] remember when I would sit down just for
[1:32:32] an hour making sure the PS and q's and
[1:32:34] everything else and making things out
[1:32:35] you know putting the stamps on and
[1:32:37] everything else but it still takes time
[1:32:39] and sometimes you know we get to a place
[1:32:41] and we're trying to do this and you know
[1:32:43] they here they set up Auto reminders I
[1:32:45] wonder every time when they do those
[1:32:46] things set up Auto reminders I remember
[1:32:48] I wonder if that ain't
[1:32:49] just reported to the labor agency you
[1:32:52] can request five more more minutes of
[1:32:54] their time yeah that's good come on
[1:32:57] we're living in a time where where like
[1:33:00] like that of pharaoh where the children
[1:33:02] of Israel are being asked to make bricks
[1:33:05] without straw don't take it personal it
[1:33:09] means your deliverance is
[1:33:12] near hallah it's not going to get easier
[1:33:15] it's going to get harder that's right
[1:33:18] you're going to have to press harder
[1:33:19] than you've ever pressed
[1:33:21] beforeall Hallelujah it's not going to
[1:33:24] get easier to come to the house of God
[1:33:26] listen many times are easier to read
[1:33:28] easier to pray easier to get in the
[1:33:30] message oh it'll get easier one day to
[1:33:32] really get in there with God it's not
[1:33:34] going to get easier there's no better
[1:33:37] time than right now today is the day of
[1:33:44] salvation here we're standing as Isaiah
[1:33:47] said and Paul identified on whom the
[1:33:50] ends of the world have come
[1:33:55] I'm telling you we're at the
[1:34:00] end I tell you the only reason that all
[1:34:02] those things has not turned loose yet is
[1:34:05] because there's still a bride member
[1:34:08] that has not come into
[1:34:12] position but while we're waiting on that
[1:34:15] one to come into position while we're
[1:34:17] waiting on
[1:34:19] them to to be sealed and come to
[1:34:23] adoption yes that's so good are you
[1:34:26] hearing me while we're waiting on seal
[1:34:28] to come to
[1:34:30] adoption in the
[1:34:32] meantime I'm here this is still going on
[1:34:35] then I need to keep
[1:34:37] growing there's more there's more of God
[1:34:39] for me there's more of God I want more
[1:34:42] of God I don't want more of this world I
[1:34:44] want more of
[1:34:45] God oh my my my my my my notice not
[1:34:50] forsaking the assembling of ourselves
[1:34:53] together
[1:34:54] as the manner of some is now they had
[1:34:58] this evidently in Paul's day too right I
[1:35:00] like how John wack life he he writes a
[1:35:03] lot about these things so you've had it
[1:35:04] down Through the Ages so it's not
[1:35:05] something that is just all of a sudden
[1:35:07] in this age that's come about but you
[1:35:10] realize it's been all the way down
[1:35:12] through the times that even this
[1:35:14] admonition not forsaking which this word
[1:35:16] forsaking means to abandon desert leave
[1:35:21] in Straits leave helpless to totally
[1:35:24] abandoned utterly forsaken now let's
[1:35:26] just say we were getting ready to have
[1:35:28] let's just say we're getting ready to
[1:35:29] have a
[1:35:30] landscaping time out
[1:35:32] here and
[1:35:34] everybody has been
[1:35:37] invited and here we
[1:35:40] are
[1:35:41] my you some of you might say brother
[1:35:43] Samy that's your thing but let's say
[1:35:46] here we are because we we we we we need
[1:35:48] to Green this up we need to it it it we
[1:35:51] we need to get some Shrubbery we need to
[1:35:53] get some things
[1:35:54] Hey listen the Tabernacle in the
[1:35:56] wilderness didn't look like no shabby
[1:35:57] little thing come on now Solomon's
[1:35:59] Temple want no shabby little thing you
[1:36:02] you you can't put that on me that's
[1:36:03] right because it's a
[1:36:06] scripture I believe God deserves our
[1:36:08] best CU he gave us his best or brother
[1:36:10] Samuel shrubs and all those things don't
[1:36:12] make a difference I'm not going to go
[1:36:13] there but let's just let me get back to
[1:36:15] my example let's say that we've all been
[1:36:17] exi invited here to do some landscaping
[1:36:20] and we're all going to come that's what
[1:36:21] that's what we're going to come together
[1:36:22] for and one of a sudden if let's say
[1:36:25] brother Joey you look at it and say they
[1:36:27] got enough Brothers there to do that
[1:36:29] they don't need me there well maybe
[1:36:31] you're not going to do the
[1:36:35] shoveling sister Rachel says they got
[1:36:37] other people there can make lemonade and
[1:36:39] run it to the brothers they don't need
[1:36:43] me then brother Dave Crest says well you
[1:36:46] know I I don't have the strength like I
[1:36:49] used to have they they won't need me
[1:36:50] they I mean what what what could I do
[1:36:52] maybe brother Dave's the one to sat in
[1:36:54] the lawn chair and say keep digging
[1:36:55] brother Samuel move it over this way
[1:36:57] just a little bit
[1:36:59] more that's so
[1:37:02] good but what if one by
[1:37:05] one it just starts off oh they don't oh
[1:37:08] they don't oh they don't pretty soon it
[1:37:10] might be down to just a couple man
[1:37:13] crew right you know
[1:37:15] why they don't need
[1:37:18] me we fail to recognize we're a part
[1:37:23] heart of a
[1:37:25] body think of in your home in your home
[1:37:29] what if your kids what if your husband
[1:37:32] whoever pays the bills what if they
[1:37:33] decided you know what this really a't
[1:37:35] important I just this month I don't feel
[1:37:37] like
[1:37:39] it we're getting down to Ground Zero
[1:37:41] aren't we but this I'm I'm reading to
[1:37:44] you the scripture you see that forsaking
[1:37:47] is about a
[1:37:48] Carefree not caring attitude
[1:37:53] stay with me here and don't don't turn
[1:37:55] off on
[1:37:58] me sometimes sometimes the reason those
[1:38:01] things happen and if you will allow the
[1:38:04] spirit of God to minister to you it's
[1:38:06] because we get ourselves tied up with so
[1:38:10] much of the
[1:38:13] world to where we're so tied down to
[1:38:16] where we can set in church but we can't
[1:38:19] even enter
[1:38:21] in let me tell you something
[1:38:24] some of you how God has delivered you
[1:38:26] from cigarettes and smoking and all
[1:38:27] other sorts of things but God also wants
[1:38:30] to deliver you from things traps things
[1:38:34] that maybe you've run to when you got a
[1:38:36] little down and you run some people run
[1:38:38] to there's so many different V various
[1:38:41] things that people will run to and
[1:38:42] sometimes it isn't that those things are
[1:38:44] sin but then it just starts to take over
[1:38:47] their
[1:38:48] life and remember Satan comes in
[1:38:52] innocently white horse Rider right just
[1:38:55] riding real
[1:38:56] slow real innocent you don't have no
[1:38:59] power he's just riding innocent he can
[1:39:01] only ride as far as you let him
[1:39:04] ride but remember James says no
[1:39:09] man no man is tempted other than by
[1:39:13] whatever desire is there and when that
[1:39:17] comes forth in the F full fruition you
[1:39:19] read that in the Book of James that's
[1:39:21] the four horse riders right there the
[1:39:22] progression that's right of sin because
[1:39:26] Satan wants to so entwine and entangle
[1:39:30] our lives this is why that quote I
[1:39:32] referred to you last week and let me
[1:39:35] just give me Grace to just tie this
[1:39:37] point
[1:39:38] up this is why when brother Brandon
[1:39:40] makes a statement I want you to
[1:39:42] understand this this is one point where
[1:39:44] you need to be able to stand right now
[1:39:46] there should not be a quote that could
[1:39:48] be read right here or a scripture that
[1:39:51] would cause you to draw back amen that
[1:39:54] is so good let me tell you there's some
[1:39:56] strong language the Bible is filled with
[1:39:57] strong language you know why that is
[1:39:59] it's to break
[1:40:02] veils it's to break veils the reason
[1:40:05] sometimes where where we can get into a
[1:40:07] fix and people can set in a certain way
[1:40:09] and getting a certain way it's because
[1:40:11] of a veil Spirit Veil and it has to be
[1:40:14] broken and it takes the spirit of God to
[1:40:16] break it but this is why brother Bram
[1:40:19] could say he said now listen he said to
[1:40:22] missw workk he said you can get by with
[1:40:24] that he said maybe to miss a day or two
[1:40:27] he said but don't miss going to the
[1:40:31] house of God now why is he saying that
[1:40:34] listen I I don't don't be pulling up
[1:40:35] your toes and your oh man we're going to
[1:40:37] talking about if you just think it's
[1:40:39] Church attendance you're missing
[1:40:41] it you're that I'm I'm not I'm not even
[1:40:43] talking that that's not what it is it's
[1:40:46] deeper than that we come here to feed on
[1:40:49] the things of God we come here that he
[1:40:52] might sh shepher us and direct us it
[1:40:55] don't stop when the benediction prayer
[1:40:57] is made you keep feeding in that
[1:41:01] Hillside cuz there's places he brings us
[1:41:04] to it stings in our life it'll take a
[1:41:06] week's worth of
[1:41:08] dying Hallelujah that's true it'll take
[1:41:11] a week's worth of it'll sting but you
[1:41:13] know what if you no don't look around
[1:41:15] just feed on where he's brought you if
[1:41:17] you feed on where he's brought you it's
[1:41:19] got power in it to give you virtue to
[1:41:21] overcome the things in your life that
[1:41:23] you're battling with that you're
[1:41:24] struggling with if it's unforgiveness
[1:41:26] whatever there is power in the
[1:41:29] word brother Samuel I go to the
[1:41:31] bookstore why waste your
[1:41:34] money God has sent an open book to you
[1:41:37] and
[1:41:39] [Music]
[1:41:40] I but in order to get that open book you
[1:41:44] have to go and take
[1:41:46] it it ain't going to be delivered to you
[1:41:49] go to the angel that standed on the land
[1:41:53] and see and
[1:41:55] take
[1:41:57] take now walk up and say may I please
[1:41:59] have it take it if you want it take it
[1:42:03] the promised land is before you take it
[1:42:06] if you want Deliverance take it if you
[1:42:08] want the Holy Ghost take it if you want
[1:42:10] healing take
[1:42:13] it these are the Redemptive blessings of
[1:42:16] the Lord that belong in the household of
[1:42:19] God to the sheep of the living Goden
[1:42:30] it's the value that's why brother
[1:42:32] Brandon when he had a quote I referred
[1:42:33] to when he talked about missing a day
[1:42:36] word listen listen listen if you don't
[1:42:39] take this in the right way you might you
[1:42:40] may not you may not see you may not see
[1:42:43] you might think oh well listen what you
[1:42:46] can't disagree with is the word of God
[1:42:49] you can't disagree with that you can't
[1:42:50] disagree with that quote
[1:42:53] now you can let Satan try to get in your
[1:42:54] mind well that was just Brother Sam if
[1:42:56] I'm reading you the word of God if I
[1:42:59] gave you $100 or somebody else gave you
[1:43:01] $100 don't you tell me you turn it
[1:43:04] down this is why the prophet said don't
[1:43:06] you pay any attention to the messenger
[1:43:08] you listen to his
[1:43:11] message are you hearing
[1:43:13] me thank God for his grace to Deliver Us
[1:43:16] from all this
[1:43:18] favoritism I got to have my favorite I
[1:43:20] got to have my favorite preacher got to
[1:43:21] have my favorite song got to have my
[1:43:22] favorite this we might like certain ones
[1:43:24] there might be certain things we're
[1:43:25] inclined to but we want him to be our
[1:43:28] favorite if there's one I want to hear
[1:43:30] from it's him it might be from a brother
[1:43:32] who stands right here don't sweat a bit
[1:43:34] he may not even move there may not be
[1:43:36] any inflection in his voice but you can
[1:43:38] hear the spirit of God speaking through
[1:43:41] him why cuz God has all sorts in the
[1:43:43] body cuz we need all
[1:43:47] sorts so I I say that I say that reading
[1:43:50] and that that part of that quote for
[1:43:52] this manner don't don't don't take it
[1:43:55] don't don't be offended with it I'm not
[1:43:57] trying to share a code I'm just trying
[1:43:58] to tell you how to approach that and say
[1:44:03] Lord there's things that I want I need
[1:44:05] to see what you've said through your
[1:44:08] messenger what you've said in your word
[1:44:10] there's a reason it's being
[1:44:12] said what's the
[1:44:14] value show me the value you know there's
[1:44:18] things right now our boys we're sitting
[1:44:21] there in the living room
[1:44:23] and I love it there times and how we're
[1:44:25] there together and coming there for
[1:44:27] devotion and we're sitting around and
[1:44:29] then other times when it's just they
[1:44:30] come and sit around and and then they'll
[1:44:33] start talking and then you just start
[1:44:35] hearing certain things you hear them
[1:44:37] start talking about certain things that
[1:44:39] they've
[1:44:39] heard you've worked with them you have
[1:44:43] certain projections you've put before
[1:44:45] them and you know just trying to drop
[1:44:47] little things and and things that they
[1:44:49] would be saying along the way I'll tell
[1:44:50] you to me when they come around and it
[1:44:53] isn't listen listen listen it isn't
[1:44:55] about me feeling like I was ride all
[1:45:01] along I tell you what my heart rejoices
[1:45:04] is I say God thank you that they're
[1:45:06] getting it yes because you know why I've
[1:45:09] told I've told him I've told many I said
[1:45:10] you know what you're further advanced
[1:45:12] than where I was at your age you are
[1:45:15] you're you're further Advanced there's
[1:45:17] certain things of where God in his grace
[1:45:18] not not not not because of me but that's
[1:45:20] where it met my heart listen listen of
[1:45:23] things that he might have been contested
[1:45:26] certain things I don't know about that
[1:45:28] Dad I don't know about that Dad now I'm
[1:45:30] not going to let all the family secrets
[1:45:32] now but I'm just going to tell you we're
[1:45:34] a real family like we're a real family
[1:45:38] God has a real family sorry to say we're
[1:45:41] not born like the prophet says and you
[1:45:43] must be born again 1961 he said you're
[1:45:45] not born born again he said one night
[1:45:47] and then a fully matured Son of God the
[1:45:49] next night brother B I'll tell you what
[1:45:50] he called that nonsense
[1:45:53] you grow into
[1:45:55] maturity and sometimes you're growing
[1:45:57] you're learning we learn through our
[1:45:58] lessons we learn through our mistakes it
[1:46:00] gets through certain phases of life when
[1:46:02] you can present things and say it's your
[1:46:03] decision no your decision but you need
[1:46:06] might look at it this way see it gets to
[1:46:08] that point now I never told them at 5
[1:46:11] years old it's your
[1:46:14] decision Daddy's presenting it before
[1:46:16] you no this is the way it is then it
[1:46:20] gets to a certain spot it's just like I
[1:46:22] think brother John Fon and what he told
[1:46:23] brother brother Isaac and this how I
[1:46:26] felt if you don't have these same
[1:46:28] convictions you can borrow mine cuz
[1:46:32] while you live in my house you're going
[1:46:34] to have these
[1:46:37] convictions because I am I am the Holy
[1:46:39] Ghost to you until you get old enough to
[1:46:41] receive it and I I've got a promise
[1:46:44] where a prophet said if we keep keep you
[1:46:45] under that of the atmosphere of the Holy
[1:46:47] Ghost then God will step in on the scene
[1:46:51] he said but you first got those adoles
[1:46:53] and
[1:46:54] years sorry I went like a
[1:46:56] bypass let me get back to the point
[1:47:00] ain't God
[1:47:01] good but God come God will bring it
[1:47:04] right back around and there's things
[1:47:05] that they start talking about and
[1:47:08] saying of things Dad I know where you
[1:47:11] were pretty strong on this
[1:47:13] and you you wouldn't let this have you
[1:47:16] wouldn't let us have a phone to this age
[1:47:17] and you wouldn't all
[1:47:20] those see let me just tell you something
[1:47:23] something I I got to go with it as it's
[1:47:26] coming if you could you could come up as
[1:47:28] a parent and ask me brother Samuel what
[1:47:30] time should I give my my my son or
[1:47:32] daughter a phone and you know what I'm
[1:47:33] going to tell you
[1:47:35] pray because I'm going to tell you it's
[1:47:37] an individual walk you listen God has
[1:47:40] entrusted you the stewardship of their
[1:47:43] life that's right and every child is
[1:47:48] different you didn't blanket like all of
[1:47:51] a sudden we're 16 years of age we get
[1:47:53] our driver's license I'm glad some of my
[1:47:56] friends at 16 didn't get
[1:47:59] it cuz I had some that did turn 16 I got
[1:48:03] in the car with them one time never got
[1:48:05] in the car
[1:48:08] again crazy they shouldn't have had
[1:48:11] them you know any video games where you
[1:48:13] get another
[1:48:16] lives but my point
[1:48:18] is as it comes back around and the value
[1:48:22] that all of a sudden you begin to see
[1:48:24] and each one of are you are you hearing
[1:48:26] me now as parents that's why it's
[1:48:28] important to pray don't say oh you know
[1:48:29] what oh oh brother Samuel gave so and so
[1:48:33] he he gave a zachar he he gave so and so
[1:48:35] he did it at this age you're to have
[1:48:37] your own walk with
[1:48:39] God God has put me here as an example
[1:48:42] that's true but what I'm what I
[1:48:44] encouraging you listen I'm not your
[1:48:47] absolute Jesus Christ is your
[1:48:50] absolute the word of God is your
[1:48:52] absolute the message of the hour is your
[1:48:54] absolute all of that it's the word of
[1:48:56] the Lord it ties Us
[1:48:59] in that's why listen you can come and I
[1:49:03] can give I can present questions to you
[1:49:05] to think up and pray on but you got to
[1:49:07] make that decision right you have to do
[1:49:10] that because listen that's where the
[1:49:12] Prophet said you show your faith is when
[1:49:14] you make
[1:49:17] decisions and if you don't have faith
[1:49:20] then don't make the decision keep
[1:49:22] waiting on God
[1:49:25] well they're I don't know why I'm on
[1:49:26] this track right
[1:49:28] now well brother Samuel they're
[1:49:30] pressuring me I've been
[1:49:32] there get around with the rest of the
[1:49:34] young people and I I I I feel you know I
[1:49:36] feel inferior you know they they know
[1:49:38] this or they know that that won't be the
[1:49:41] first time in your
[1:49:43] life that's right this ain't about you
[1:49:47] baby ain't about you
[1:49:54] oh
[1:49:57] man brother Samuel I does God give into
[1:50:00] everything we want when we want it oh
[1:50:04] this is why brother BR tell us in the
[1:50:05] church ages he said if we instantly got
[1:50:08] our request the very moment we prayed we
[1:50:11] would become more
[1:50:13] impatient than we
[1:50:17] are God's tempering us
[1:50:23] once again we just went on a
[1:50:25] bypass but the point and I trust that
[1:50:27] you've gathered even in this point it's
[1:50:30] why it's coming down to with these
[1:50:31] things that the Lord is looking having
[1:50:34] us to look at this scripture because
[1:50:36] it's value yes there's things that my
[1:50:39] dad told
[1:50:41] me I didn't see it when he told
[1:50:44] me but I hold it more
[1:50:48] value there's things like brother Ivon
[1:50:50] and other ministers at times and where
[1:50:53] we've just things that's been shared
[1:50:56] experience
[1:50:57] wisdom just listen just listen you get
[1:51:00] under oak trees you listen right I maybe
[1:51:03] can't relate because I've not been there
[1:51:05] but I want to hear right you say why why
[1:51:08] do you want to hear because I'm going to
[1:51:10] come through that same
[1:51:13] path and when I come through that path
[1:51:15] this is what I found is God reminds me
[1:51:19] you're not an oddball you're not alone
[1:51:22] amen amen Elijah got to feel in that way
[1:51:25] Lord I'm no better Lord than my
[1:51:29] father's right right he felt that way he
[1:51:32] felt what Jeremiah felt he felt or they
[1:51:34] you know he felt like or Jeremiah end up
[1:51:36] feeling what he felt like they felt what
[1:51:38] what they felt
[1:51:39] like value sometimes the things that you
[1:51:42] know how it is right now where your mom
[1:51:44] or dad or somebody else has told you
[1:51:46] something and you didn't see the value
[1:51:48] of it brother Drake when you were going
[1:51:49] through Plumbing school there's certain
[1:51:50] things that they instructed you brought
[1:51:52] in your
[1:51:53] um wisdom from the you worked in that
[1:51:54] water treatment didn't you he worked in
[1:51:56] that water treatment for years but he
[1:51:58] had to learn the whole thing with the
[1:51:59] branching of plumbing and all those
[1:52:01] things like he's seen no dad he's seen a
[1:52:02] lot of stuff was went but you know what
[1:52:04] he's had to learn to value with certain
[1:52:06] things that why certain older veteran
[1:52:08] plumbers have said boys watch out for
[1:52:11] this when when you text this right here
[1:52:14] watch this right here may not have
[1:52:16] understood it but you get to a certain
[1:52:18] spot then you realize oh I see the value
[1:52:21] now I know why you do this check first
[1:52:23] now I know why see that's as we walk
[1:52:25] with God we know even as we're known we
[1:52:29] begin to see the value of the things
[1:52:32] that we've done that's why the prophet
[1:52:34] said after you've given your life to the
[1:52:36] Lord and you've walked on you come back
[1:52:38] and you can see the value of when God
[1:52:40] Drew you to the
[1:52:42] altar so I'll tell you so good as we
[1:52:46] walk on with God there's things that
[1:52:47] even when we look at these principles
[1:52:50] you may not altogether see the full
[1:52:51] value on it's just you know about being
[1:52:53] in the house of God oh forsake not to S
[1:52:55] me together here's here scriptures about
[1:52:56] coming to church don't I've got more but
[1:52:59] I don't want you I've told you this last
[1:53:01] week how I felt on my heart for quite a
[1:53:04] while with Le this laying before
[1:53:06] me is don't look at this about coming
[1:53:10] and filling a Pew look at it and say God
[1:53:14] help me to see the
[1:53:18] value help me to see the value right do
[1:53:22] you love
[1:53:24] him let's
[1:53:27] pray Heavenly
[1:53:39] Father Lord this is something that for
[1:53:41] every one of our
[1:53:46] Lives seeing the value
[1:53:51] lord well obedience Lord is
[1:53:57] the the greatest thing that you ask
[1:54:01] for one time lord a man by the name of
[1:54:04] Saul we see it in other places of
[1:54:09] scripture we saw a lord where he he got
[1:54:12] to a
[1:54:13] place he intruded into another
[1:54:18] office because of a lack of patience
[1:54:24] Lord he would have received
[1:54:27] patience the Bible
[1:54:30] says POS possess you with patience
[1:54:33] possess you your
[1:54:35] souls Saul would have received patience
[1:54:38] if he would have just kept feeding and
[1:54:42] drawing from the word of
[1:54:45] God Samuel would have been
[1:54:47] there because you keep all of your
[1:54:50] appointments
[1:54:53] then we see how that Saul went on
[1:54:56] and when he was given charge of what to
[1:54:59] do regarding the
[1:55:02] amalekites as he began to come back to
[1:55:04] the
[1:55:06] camp
[1:55:07] Samuel could hear the
[1:55:11] bleeding sheep
[1:55:14] oxen and he would ask Saul what is that
[1:55:18] I
[1:55:19] hear Saul first
[1:55:22] saluted the prophet of God I have done
[1:55:26] what the Lord has commanded me to
[1:55:31] do but yet he really
[1:55:34] hadn't he thought he
[1:55:36] had he had done what he thought was best
[1:55:41] to
[1:55:43] do and when he was asked the question
[1:55:46] why why why do I hear this
[1:55:48] bleeding
[1:55:50] immediately showing the weakness of
[1:55:53] man he turned around and he blamed the
[1:55:57] people the people the people the
[1:56:02] people Lord
[1:56:06] Jesus the
[1:56:09] value of US Gathering
[1:56:13] Together around the revealed word of the
[1:56:15] [Music]
[1:56:17] Lord I don't want to take my own
[1:56:20] way I realize Lord
[1:56:23] that this is why many times that when we
[1:56:27] talk about this important part that the
[1:56:31] prophet will always bring together
[1:56:33] through the message and the scriptures
[1:56:35] as
[1:56:36] well we come to the house of God to feed
[1:56:39] on the word of God and
[1:56:43] fellowship with one
[1:56:48] another Lord I don't want my
[1:56:50] way I
[1:56:52] remember what my way what it led to in
[1:56:55] my life many scars many
[1:56:59] scars and Lord You've you gave me Grace
[1:57:03] Lord just like you've given many Lord
[1:57:06] God right through this
[1:57:07] assembly that Lord Jesus where you've
[1:57:09] drawn us to a place and there was a part
[1:57:12] in our life Lord to say yes
[1:57:15] Lord yes Lord if you have me Lord I want
[1:57:19] to serve
[1:57:20] you and then Lord how that you would
[1:57:23] take our lives and work with our
[1:57:26] lives and move in our hearts to where
[1:57:28] you would get our lives our hearts your
[1:57:33] Prophet would say it like this to where
[1:57:34] you can get that first nature to agree
[1:57:37] with the word of
[1:57:38] God then you come in and kill
[1:57:43] it and raise
[1:57:45] up raise up that new
[1:57:49] man quickly you come into that good
[1:57:55] ground then
[1:57:57] Lord we've been equipped to
[1:58:01] subdue our own will cuz we still have it
[1:58:04] we still have
[1:58:06] it but we're not under the Dominion of
[1:58:09] that first
[1:58:12] birth but Lord there's times like you
[1:58:15] would take us in some of the examples
[1:58:17] you gave here this
[1:58:18] morning no doubt Ruth got weary
[1:58:24] sometimes she got tired cuz it wasn't
[1:58:26] just the next day and out of a sudden
[1:58:28] the next day here it is the end of
[1:58:29] harvest no there was even a testing time
[1:58:33] that went clear through Harvest
[1:58:40] time but she would
[1:58:42] glean there's no doubt she would get
[1:58:44] weary
[1:58:48] tired Lord we understand that there's
[1:58:50] times when there's physical reasons and
[1:58:52] ailments and things Lord sometimes
[1:58:54] there's situations that come our way
[1:58:57] where we're not able to be gathered
[1:58:59] together oh how it just causes us to
[1:59:02] long for those times
[1:59:07] Lord but help us Lord those of us that
[1:59:11] maybe Lord would be standing Lord in
[1:59:14] good health as of now have our strength
[1:59:17] have the
[1:59:18] ability help us Lord God in seeing the
[1:59:24] value of coming to the house of God it's
[1:59:27] more than these four walls it's more
[1:59:30] than the pews it's more than the
[1:59:32] preacher it's more than the ministering
[1:59:34] it's more than being able to read out of
[1:59:36] the Bible and know the next verse that
[1:59:37] comes next or to finish a
[1:59:40] quote but lord it's being able as a lamb
[1:59:44] as a
[1:59:45] sheep to be
[1:59:47] led by the feeding of the
[1:59:50] word cuz you you know what we need Lord
[1:59:53] in our
[1:59:54] lives
[1:59:56] Lord I believe God throughout this
[1:59:58] congregation there's others that would
[1:59:59] join with
[2:00:01] me I don't want to see more of Samuel
[2:00:05] they could put their own name in
[2:00:07] it I want to see more of
[2:00:09] Jesus I want to see more of you
[2:00:12] [Music]
[2:00:15] Lord so Lord help us to
[2:00:18] recognize the more that we'll give into
[2:00:21] our own will
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:24] the more of us will be
[2:00:27] shown but the more that we can surrender
[2:00:29] to the will of God then the
[2:00:33] more God will display himself in and
[2:00:38] through our
[2:00:40] lives Lord even when it comes to things
[2:00:43] that maybe under the sound of my voice
[2:00:45] things that have been
[2:00:48] struggling areas Lord that might seem
[2:00:51] ever so difficult how could this ever be
[2:00:54] taken out of my life or maybe it's a
[2:00:56] sense Lord of
[2:00:58] security to feel a certain way to be
[2:01:02] looked upon a certain
[2:01:04] way but Lord God I I pray right
[2:01:08] now would you just move to that heart
[2:01:10] and let them
[2:01:12] see the value that you
[2:01:17] saw in their soul
[2:01:24] Hallelujah that you were
[2:01:27] willing to come
[2:01:29] down and
[2:01:31] become one of
[2:01:35] us that you were willing like the
[2:01:37] scripture said to
[2:01:42] endure the shame and the
[2:01:46] suffering and you did it the scripture
[2:01:49] says you did it for the joy that was set
[2:01:53] before
[2:01:56] you because Lord God you could see
[2:02:00] beyond that
[2:02:02] moment you did it that we might have joy
[2:02:05] this moment you did it that there might
[2:02:08] be Deliverance in the camp of the Living
[2:02:11] God you did it Lord that salvation might
[2:02:14] come Lord to hearts and lives you did it
[2:02:17] Lord that the Holy Ghost Lord could move
[2:02:20] down lord into lives and hearts Lord
[2:02:21] Lord and change us Lord from creatures
[2:02:24] of time creatures of Eternity you did it
[2:02:28] for the joy that was set before you
[2:02:31] because that moment was not a joyous
[2:02:37] moment it was
[2:02:40] Calvary and that day on Calvary you made
[2:02:44] a way glory be to God that every son and
[2:02:47] daughter of God could follow you
[2:02:52] to be delivered Lord God of that nature
[2:02:56] Lord God that would dwell in this old
[2:02:59] pous Lord God you made a way Lord God
[2:03:04] that we could be
[2:03:05] free delivered
[2:03:08] Lord and filled with your
[2:03:12] presence you made a way Lord that fear
[2:03:15] might be dismissed from our life you did
[2:03:17] it for the joy that was set before you
[2:03:21] no doubt Lord God I believe right there
[2:03:23] you look down the songwriter said when
[2:03:26] he was on the cross I was on his
[2:03:29] mind the last words Lord God that you
[2:03:33] said before going to Calvary the one
[2:03:36] request you
[2:03:38] made you asked for our
[2:03:43] fellowship granted father that where I
[2:03:47] am they may be aome
[2:03:53] Lord God granted Lord this morning
[2:03:56] Lord maybe right here Lord in this
[2:03:59] moment a soul a life would see the value
[2:04:02] of Calvary Lord God has heard it preach
[2:04:05] Lord God has felt your presence Lord has
[2:04:08] felt the spirit of God dealing with
[2:04:10] their life Lord speaking directly to
[2:04:12] their life as somebody that maybe would
[2:04:15] seem like is sitting around in a car
[2:04:17] watching them and taking down notes
[2:04:20] regarding their life but they real
[2:04:21] realize Lord God that there's one Lord
[2:04:24] God that it's not a man or a person
[2:04:26] who's watching their life it's almighty
[2:04:29] God that has watched over our life like
[2:04:31] Ruth that has come back into the field
[2:04:35] oh God grant it this morning
[2:04:39] Lord that Lord God Even In This Moment
[2:04:44] value could be
[2:04:47] recognized why that God has dealt with
[2:04:49] my life this way why has God called out
[2:04:52] maybe the way that I dress or the way
[2:04:54] that I've acted why has God called out
[2:04:57] against that not because he's against
[2:04:59] you but he wants to free you so that you
[2:05:04] can serve him fully you're not dependent
[2:05:08] upon what the world thinks do you fit in
[2:05:11] with the world are you in with the
[2:05:12] latest
[2:05:14] fashion friends I tell you in the name
[2:05:16] of the Lord you don't want to fit in
[2:05:17] with this world you don't want the
[2:05:19] Fashions of this world the Bible said
[2:05:21] the f passion thereof passeth
[2:05:24] away you want to Bear His Image you want
[2:05:28] to Bear the image of almighty God and
[2:05:31] that same one that moved and led the
[2:05:33] lamb to Calvary he's here this morning
[2:05:35] he's here to lead you to a full and
[2:05:37] complete deliverance he's here to lead
[2:05:39] you and to minister for whatever it is
[2:05:42] that you have need of that he's dealt
[2:05:43] with you personally you don't need me to
[2:05:45] call it out he could call that out but
[2:05:47] but listen God has dealt so personally
[2:05:49] with you since the day of Pentecost now
[2:05:52] God has come back to speak lip to ear to
[2:05:54] man the same God that led Abraham out of
[2:05:57] the earth of caldes where he can walk
[2:05:59] away from a family business the same God
[2:06:03] is speaking right to your heart this
[2:06:04] morning and will give you the strength
[2:06:07] if you'll yield to it the same word will
[2:06:09] lead you right out of Disobedience it'll
[2:06:12] lead you right into full victory that
[2:06:14] same word if you'll yield to it it'll
[2:06:16] take you to the baptism of the Holy
[2:06:18] Ghost it'll take you to your healing if
[2:06:21] you'll yield to it if you yield to it

[2:06:56] looked at within the
[2:06:57] scriptures but remember it's not great
[2:06:59] big things that we leave undone it's
[2:07:02] little
[2:07:03] foxes that spoil the vine in this day
[2:07:07] and
[2:07:08] age there is a despising of small
[2:07:13] things but I tell you God don't need
[2:07:16] great big things he never has used great
[2:07:18] big things God
[2:07:20] uses Little Things
[2:07:22] things he uses simple things God uses
[2:07:26] simple
[2:07:27] obedience obedience is better than

[2:07:54] trust you let the tape play all the way
[2:07:55] out you'll find it over and over on many
[2:07:57] of the tapes sometimes they had to cut

[2:08:02] somebody was taking it but if you can
[2:08:03] listen to many of the
[2:08:05] tapes you'll find it it wasn't that
[2:08:07] brother Ram had a long had to have such
[2:08:09] a long after service but it was always
[2:08:11] sensitive to how the spirit of God was

[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:41] you you know as sheep I wonder if we
[2:11:44] couldn't just
[2:11:48] stand so I've read and studied over the
[2:11:52] times just even as I've
[2:11:54] been going through this portion and
[2:11:58] going back through and studying and
[2:12:00] studying on Shepherds and sheep feeding
[2:12:05] Fellowship sheep it's one of the
[2:12:08] incredible things how God would liken us
[2:12:10] to
[2:12:12] sheep you know sheep is a very social
[2:12:15] animal it's very dependent
[2:12:19] animal but a shepherd it's sometimes the
[2:12:22] way he'll have to come
[2:12:23] through and not only by the feeding of
[2:12:26] the
[2:12:27] flock but as I've read and studied that
[2:12:30] the shepherd also has to watch out for
[2:12:34] struggles that can take place in the
[2:12:37] Sheep sometimes there's a as a as it's
[2:12:42] wrote and put out there by Shepherds
[2:12:44] there's a sometimes can be kind of like
[2:12:45] a hierarchial thing and how things are
[2:12:48] so kind of placed there and the shepherd
[2:12:50] is to watch because that can
[2:12:52] really bring ill effects in the
[2:12:57] herd now you might look at that and say
[2:12:59] well brother the Samuel that that
[2:13:01] shouldn't be but I can show you
[2:13:03] scripture after
[2:13:05] scripture of where Paul would admonish
[2:13:08] every one of the
[2:13:10] Epistles on
[2:13:12] how to live our lives not only out there
[2:13:18] but among one
[2:13:19] another even things things where Paul
[2:13:21] would use such words as
[2:13:24] endeavoring to keep the unity you know
[2:13:27] what that word endeavoring means being
[2:13:30] strategic with military
[2:13:34] Outpost you know what that means when
[2:13:36] they look at a big map
[2:13:38] military they say if I make this move
[2:13:41] right here this is what might
[2:13:43] happen if if I my we we need go we need
[2:13:47] to go right in on that and take but if I
[2:13:48] make this move right here this is what's
[2:13:50] going to happen
[2:13:53] so
[2:13:56] endeavoring are you hearing me now
[2:13:58] endeavoring is not about something
[2:14:01] outside
[2:14:02] endeavoring is about inwardly in
[2:14:06] us
[2:14:07] us endeavoring to keep the unity through
[2:14:11] the bond of
[2:14:12] peace now you see God won't do that for
[2:14:16] Ruth he won't do it for Ruth I'll I'll
[2:14:19] just do it for you no see there's things
[2:14:21] that God does for us you can't open the
[2:14:24] Red Sea he'll do that you can't heal
[2:14:27] your body he does that but then there's
[2:14:29] so many other things that God entrusts
[2:14:31] you and I with doing and says I want my
[2:14:36] faith to be displayed through the lives
[2:14:38] of my
[2:14:39] children yes just like he pulled back in
[2:14:42] the Hebrew children it was all that was
[2:14:45] all them they were standing on God's
[2:14:48] word but God allowed that Faith to be
[2:14:50] displayed
[2:14:52] so I think of this moment that we're in
[2:14:55] here the Sheep being even in that manner
[2:14:59] to where all those things would have to
[2:15:00] be watched out for I also want to take
[2:15:02] it in this I wonder if you wouldn't lay
[2:15:05] your hand
[2:15:06] upon husband and wife sitting next to
[2:15:08] one another maybe another brother sister
[2:15:10] to sister respectfully respectfully
[2:15:14] please and I want you to pray for
[2:15:17] that other sheep of God
[2:15:21] that other name that we believe is on
[2:15:23] the Lamb's Book of
[2:15:25] Life I don't know what what they might
[2:15:27] be going through but remember when we
[2:15:29] come together to assemble
[2:15:32] together sometimes there's
[2:15:36] discouragement and so when we come
[2:15:38] together it's not just me coming to see
[2:15:42] this brother or this sister but we
[2:15:45] should meet Jesus and one another that
[2:15:48] individual you've got your hand on right
[2:15:49] now might be going through the hardest
[2:15:51] time in their life there might be traps
[2:15:54] and ins snars and entanglement that you
[2:15:56] just can't say well you need to get out
[2:15:57] of this no they they need prayer right
[2:15:59] now they need encouragement there's a
[2:16:01] way that maybe they can't see their way
[2:16:03] out of it but God is a god rich in Mercy
[2:16:07] that in their mind maybe where it looks
[2:16:09] so I don't know how that's going to be
[2:16:13] but let's pray no matter what that need
[2:16:15] is if it's that if it's a trap whatever
[2:16:17] it is besetting sin whatever the need is
[2:16:20] you need need the Holy Ghost whatever it
[2:16:22] is let's believe God for all things
[2:16:28] Heavenly
[2:16:30] Father Lord as we have been joined
[2:16:34] together here this morning we have not
[2:16:36] been called together
[2:16:39] father by man but Lord our assembling
[2:16:43] together Lord has been by you you have
[2:16:46] led us Lord together Lord under the
[2:16:50] great canopy of your presence Lord the
[2:16:52] revealed word of this hour Lord oh God
[2:16:56] to come under Lord the blood where Lord
[2:16:58] Jesus we stand Lord where there's no big
[2:17:01] eyes and little 's Lord but we stand as
[2:17:04] Sons and Daughters of God Redeemed by
[2:17:08] the blood of the lamb in need of the
[2:17:10] mercy and the grace of God lord you see
[2:17:13] the needs Lord throughout this assembly
[2:17:16] this morning oh God among Lord the
[2:17:19] sheeps and Lambs Lord God that are
[2:17:21] gathered here Lord father you know the
[2:17:25] needs Lord you know father whether it's
[2:17:27] despair discouragement Lord Lord maybe
[2:17:30] ENT trapment Lord entanglement Lord and
[2:17:33] how the enemy Lord even in the midst of
[2:17:35] that Lord where Lord's been an entament
[2:17:37] Lord would like to wear them out in
[2:17:39] their mind Lord as though they don't
[2:17:41] belong to you but oh God when that
[2:17:44] desire on the inside they could not have
[2:17:47] the desire to be free Lord unless you
[2:17:49] put that desire in him Lord now I pray
[2:17:52] heavenly father as that thirst is there
[2:17:55] Lord and David said Lord that he longed
[2:17:57] to see the Living God in this dry place
[2:18:01] like he was in the sanctuary now I pray
[2:18:04] father that Lord as you have moved Lord
[2:18:07] in the sanctuary Lord of your presence
[2:18:09] of your word Lord may you breathe Lord
[2:18:12] God and move upon those dry places Lord
[2:18:15] as hearts Lord God are returning Lord
[2:18:18] and rekindling Lord and realizing the on
[2:18:21] the inside Lord you placed it there Lord
[2:18:24] may you breathe Lord God an
[2:18:25] encouragement Lord God to the
[2:18:27] discouraged Lord May Lord I pray God The

[2:18:43] might be Lord that everything all sin is
[2:18:46] confessed and under the blood Lord God
[2:18:48] to where our hearts Lord do not condemn
[2:18:51] us Lord and may the Winds of the holy
[2:18:53] spirit that would bring that change of
[2:18:55] heart bring that change of mind that
