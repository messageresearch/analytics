remind you just to keep those in prayer be very prayerful we're just expecting the lord to do great things amen we're just expecting that amen god is he's certainly mindful of our needs isn't he yeah he really is so we just want to just want to remember that in prayer let's just look to the lord right now before we read in the scriptures here heavenly father lord it's a real it's a real privilege lord oh god to serve you lord the lord how you come lord you've set us free lord lord i love how the scripture is wrote said he who the son is set free is made free is free indeed you didn't just set us free it was beyond that it's a new creation you made us free lord oh god by your quickening power drawing us to yourself and bringing about a real transformation in our life oh god how we thank you tonight lord dear lord jesus it's the greatest honor and greatest privilege to serve you lord i pray that lord jesus that as lord we've come here tonight lord we've come together in your presence we love seeing one another lord but father you're the one that all eyes are looking for lord lord it's you that we want to hear from tonight we pray that lord that in these next few moments that you would just give us grace lord we might be able to step aside both speaker and hearer your god be able to recognize you we want to invite you lord in this service lord dear god we believe that that invitation lord it goes before we even come together in this building lord it's where our hearts lord are just longing to have a meeting with you lord we know that lord that right there lord in our home and lord in in any place sometimes lord where maybe we've stepped aside lord in the yard or maybe on the job or in the car we've had a meeting with you but there's something special lord when we come together lord as you've directed us in your word your prophet made it so clear to us he said that it's a gathering of those licks of fire it's more of the godhead bodily gather together lord we believe that tonight lord jesus it's a desire in our heart to welcome you lord in the service lord jesus that you'll come in a very special way lord speak to our hearts o god may we speak o god according to the oracles of god i pray lord may the holy spirit just give unction lord may i pray god in our hearts lord you find hearts that are just open receiving oh god just to take it in and to believe it lord the greatest honor we could ever give you lord is to believe oh god grant it tonight lord may you find that among our hearts lord a life o god that gives honor to you lord we love you lord we just invite you here tonight take control now lord speak to our hearts we pray minister to each life in the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen first corinthians chapter 13 if you will amen let's let's read here in verse verse one i want to come back to that this is paul is dealing with with what real charity is and we know that as the scripture lets us know this is not this is not apart from god but this charity this we're speaking of this is god this is god's own life it's god's own expression and look how paul would place this here he says though i speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity and become a sounding brass or a tingling symbol though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i'm nothing though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing what paul's dealing with here there's got to be a real substance behind it all if there's not the real substance of love of everything even when you look at that very last verse of all of the great sacrifices that could be made yet if it is not charity that's abiding there motivating that life then all the sacrifices all of the great things mean nothing amen verse 4 charity suffereth law is kind it envieth not and it vaunteth not itself and it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly and that's where i'm going to stop here for tonight may god bless you bless the reading of his word as you're being seated you know there's times when we look here in the word of god and you we can read over these parts here as we god has just been taking us through this and so many times we can we can read over the word of god and yet when god begins to move through his word and begins to really bring discernment to our hearts and our lives this is a time that we really find a real reflection we find in our hearts that sometimes there's things that can be shown up in his presence that maybe at any other time there's things that we would just kind of go on past us i'd say that here tonight that anyone who's been serving the lord for any length of time at all that you find that the longer that you serve the lord you find how that there's times you're able to look back in your life and there's things that you didn't see back there but god knew they were there i'm not talking about sin of something hidden about running around the world i'm talking about things that were still there within our life of pride and everything else and it doesn't mean that all of a sudden once we begin to see all this and see that it doesn't mean that seeing it that it's always all gone it just is god's grace to you and i to realize that it's god letting us see that because he wants to operate more freely and more fully in our life and so it's remember everything how god reflects his life he doesn't do it by force in our life god does it by submission it's things to where god moves by his presence and that we would recognize his presence and then yielding our lives to him and obeying his word and simply believing because before you can obey it you first must believe it and obeying is a reflection of believing it which all comes back to a reflection of recognizing him and these are things that you can look back you know we can look in our life and i thank god for these moments because within it we can see then as we then look even at others and with uh among situations and our prayer becomes a little different we've been we begin to pray in a manner of understanding we begin to pray in a manner of where it's reaching out and say god just as you were merciful to me just as lord that there were things that that that i can look back on and say my i see this here god you're the same god for me you're the same god for my brother same god for my sister you're the same god and it it brings about a place you know to where god lets us know it's not a moment of getting down on ourselves but it's a moment of god's grace and reflection so that you and i can be able to yield more to him that more of his life can be reflected in our own lives and many times in the scripture you'll find things that you know brother branham will take things when he's writing like in the church ages and he's dealing with uh the part there out of the tyrann age and he's speaking of how it's worded there in the scripture uh thou hast not known the depths of satan and brother branson says theologians have just they said exhausted themselves trying to figure this out but he says they're silent on it he said but it's really quite simple if you just take the opposite from what the depths of satan is and begin to look at the depths of god once you see the depths of god which is this clear over here then you'll know the opposite of that is the depths of satan so many things that we can see that within it that there are times like in this verse that it does not behave itself unseemly so these are things we went from the very first verse here in verse 4 where it has its dealing with what is here inwardly but now how paul would write even in its display or the expression of this and i i tell you when we see this of of behavior it does not behave itself unseemly or meaning rudely or unbecomingly and i want to go back into a scripture here tonight in psalms 105 and as we're we're we're going to that scripture there just to think of this expression within our life and to see how that god himself god values that of honor that of reverence to where god would write in his word that he would speak to you and i not just to honor have honor among ourselves but to honor all men now god was never ever ever putting it out there that we're to honor sin or to honor wickedness but god did say honor men is that right honor the king whether you agree with him or not is that right it's it speaks of the honoring we can bring it on down honor your boss whether you agree with him or not it goes on and on through the scripture god loves and he delights in honor and in order to honor in order to honor it requires humility it's easy to be humble because you don't have to be when everybody agrees with you [Laughter] but it's when somebody doesn't agree with it or it's when somebody doesn't do something to you that's seemingly good but now how is now how is the behavior going to be translated i want to remind you of this very thing sometimes that we look at and i look at things here within the message and i know i'm not odd but i realize with this when i thank god brother ram will take in christ the mystery and i and i look at this how brother brown will take almost 35 40 some minutes here and he'll deal with even the behavior among the church of the living god he'll take time and deal with that then he speaks of the future home in 1964 he'll take the first part of that message not five minutes not ten minutes but a good chunk of it at the beginning and he'll speak of the character that's on display at the blue board at the motels at every place else and he'll speak of that character and that life that's on display just simply put in this manner this world is not our home we are delegates of that heavenly jerusalem we are not we are not of this world we're not to be caught up with this world we're not to act like this world but we are to reflect that world of our new birth that city where we're going hallelujah we've received the life of that land into us or we've been accepted into him there's a molding and a shaping in this life that makes us ready for that over there many of you right now are going about and you're getting your plants maybe or your tomato plants or or whatever you're doing there's probably not anybody here that's grown them from a seedling but you're gonna go to the store maybe you'll get your petunias or your or maybe you'll get your rose bush that you're wanting or or your hydrania but when you go get it you're going to have to bring it home you're not going to be able to live and leave it in that pot you're going to have to transplant it from that pot into a place in your flower bed or your garden or wherever more and that's exactly what the rapture is all about it's transplanting taking the character that has been molded and shaped in our life and then placed there in that other body that's exactly how brother brahms said in the future home he said the rapture it's a transplanting it's taking the character that's been reflected and molded and shaped and brother braham tells us we are molded and shaped until we're ready to go into that god knows what he's doing and all of this throughout when we consider this with with honor and how that as as we look at this in psalms 105 let me just get to it in psalms 105 verse 8 here david is esprit is expressing of how that they should glory the god of israel how they should sing glory to him and he said he hath remembered his covenant forever aren't you glad god remembers his word yes sir amen and he loves it when you remind him of his word that shows you believe it god loves it when you put his word right before god this is what you said in your word god this is what you promised he remembers his covenant and oh it thrills his heart when his children remember it and bring it back to him the word which he commanded to a thousand generations which covenant he made with abraham and his oath unto isaac and confirmed the same unto jacob for a law and to israel for an everlasting covenant saying unto thee will i give the land of canaan the lot of your inheritance when they were but a few men in number yea very few and strangers in it now here david is going back under inspiration when you we're just looking at abraham or we're looking at jacob he's not even altogether talking about the multitude that came out of egypt or those who of israel were in that multitude even though that they themselves were not even though it was a large group of people but it was not in comparison to a lot of other nations are you with me but notice here when they were but a few men in number ye very few and strangers in it when they went from one nation to another from one kingdom to another people he suffered no man to do them wrong yea he reproved kings for their saints saying touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm let me just say this to you when god as david is declaring this here remember as they would come through abraham here is abraham moving through the land here is jacob god their god has a word that's to be fulfilled let me say it like this as they even came out of israel what they were under was the anointing of the word in that hour they weren't following their own leadings and it wasn't that god said well these are my people and they're just off doing their own things and and oh somebody came against them and god said oh no you can't come against my children. that's not it at all they were under the word they were under the pillar of fire they were under the leadership of the holy spirit their identification was not their own they were identified by his presence when amalek came against him he was coming against god when edom came against him they were coming against god when pharaoh came against him he was coming against god god didn't look at it like you're picking on my kids god took it personal you're coming against me you know what that means when we stand there on god's word and believe god's word we're standing under that word submitting our lives where doubt is confessed unbelief is confessed sin has confessed let me tell you something it's not the enemy coming after you he's disrespecting the god that's anointing your life and then god takes that person that's not my anointed and do my prophets no harm god takes it personal this is why listen to me now this is why god values honor god values honor and how things and i can't get it tonight but even how things of authority will flow and follow god values that and god even in the valuing of this here under his word where there's a people that are marching under the word of the lord this is not their own anointing this is not their own imagination let me say this to you you're not here by your own imagination you're not here by your own devices you sign say there's a lot of things i don't understand but there's one thing about it you know god and you know god and his mercy of how god has dealt with your life where god has brought you to and you're walking in reverence in submission to god the difference between israel and all other nations was god you take god away from israel they're like all the rest of them you take god away from the church just like all the rest of them it's god that makes a difference there's one thing that makes a difference about your life and my life god you take god away from us we're just like any other mortal that's why we face some of the same problems we face some of the same challenges come on now we face some of the same sicknesses and through all of those things there's one thing that makes the difference god it's god hallelujah you see this is why when moses would write it like this moses as remember when here moses is is uh communing with the lord after everything and some things had taken place there in the wilderness and he's and he's asking the lord remember the request was to see him was to know who is it that you're going you said you would sin with us and remember then how that hear god speaking to moses and moses i'd want to just cut in on this where moses says if thy presence in verse 15 go not with me carry us not offense for wherein shall it be known here that i and thy people have found grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated i and thy people from all the people that are upon the face of the earth it's his presence that makes a difference hallelujah this is what the baptism of the holy ghost does it brings god's presence personal in your life amen it brings it personal in our lives no i'm with thee always you see in here in in the message respects brother adamus is speaking of things that and he's speaking to the tabernacle there and the peoples they're gathering of all the events that they are seeing taking place and he's admonishing the people there that in everything that we see going on that we give respects to it i can't get into a lot of other things here tonight but even in things where brethren says when i seen the holy spirit sometimes he said i've seen it he said a genuine anointing but sometimes people would get in the flesh he said but don't say nothing against that is that right and he takes us into this scripture here because as we're talking about behavior we're talking about honor we're talking about honor he takes us into the scripture in ecclesiastes 12 13 and i'm just quoting from this from the quote let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the full duty of god and brother graham takes it up like this he says see the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear god you cannot have respects until you have fear you've got to have fear of god we're living in a time it's been going on but we're living in an hour where there's no fear of god we're living in a time and brother and sister i'm just bringing this very very down here we're living in a time where it's not just out there those are spirits people don't even recognize it it's spirits that's behind them this is why you and i we must have the discernment of the holy spirit in our lives to be able to recognize when we look at one another we're not just looking at flesh and blood we are looking at a son or daughter of god hallelujah and you might say well you know god showed me that this one in the son or that one's a daughter i doubt that i doubt that very much because the devil don't even know that i know who that's for but it's free packaged on it with a ribbon and let me just say this to you that god did not even have that pointed out with judas none of the rest of the disciples knew about that and even though jesus knew of that he never behaved himself unseemly to judas are you with me it wasn't anything that could give it away hallelujah that's exactly help us lord jesus [Laughter] help us lord amen oh glory be to god i'm just trying to stay on this here be good you cannot have respects until you have fear you've got to have fear of god the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom now he said that don't mean you're afraid of him but that means that you are giving him respects and reverence and when you respect god you fear god remember the big difference this is not a slavish fear this is a reverence to him it's respecting him he says you fear that you might displease him in some way you fear lest you would do something wrong you wouldn't want to brother brahma says it like this i fear my mother now some of you his kids might just say hey that's exactly right it means something about respecting her not talking about how big of a switch she's got i fear my mother i fear my wife i fear my church i fear all of god's servants unless i should put a stumbling block somewhere in their way i fear the people i fear the people of the city unless i should do something wrong that would cause them to think that i wasn't a christian this is real honor charity does not behave itself unseemly it operates with a real reverence and fear because remember the scripture says if you cannot love them you seek how can you say you love god whom you've never seen and love itself love is a product of respect love brings respect is that right it brings fear it brings a reverence it brings things where it needs to be now notice this is as he goes on to say before you can have respect you've got to have fear god demands it god demands respect god does it he demands it and fear brings it now let's go in here to the scripture here just for a moment in revel in romans 12 verse 9. and i read this i read this to you starting out the last time but i want to set this just a little bit of a course here tonight let love be without dissimilation that means without hypocrisy we could say amen but this is where it has to be an amen when you don't feel loving when somebody's maybe wronged you or said something about you and you say oh i just brush it all off you're lying every one of us have a part about us nobody likes to have things said about you wrong thought about you wrong nobody likes that nobody said oh i'm just oozing out even with yourself being built up in the love of god it's where you have to lean on the inside man because there's two parts of you that has not been changed hallelujah this is why we have to draw from an inside man above all things put on sink into charity let love be without dissimilation now this this very part right here it might mean it's going to take some real time of prayer god i don't feel the way that i need to see god will work with people who's honest god don't mess around with people who are hypocrites oh i just love everybody but if there's things that's there just be honest god will come and help you he'll help you to move through that you're able to pray through that until you get the feeling the right way that don't make you not a christian that means you're standing there as a son of god and you're laying claim to the ground the body which is not your inheritance but your possession and i will not allow sin to reign in my mortal body i will not allow it to reign there that same word that uh brother jim used here last week kingdom basilio is the same word i just quoted let not therefore sin be healed kingdom reign in your mortal body we're of a different kingdom let love be without dissimilation look out look how he goes on to say this abor that which is evil wow i mean this didn't didn't it automatic switch y'all quiet please to that which is good these are things that will be done by a believer even when it comes to that of evil abhor it shun it turn away from it once again it's things sometimes that we have pictures painted out here and when god begins to show the evil we say oh that was evil oh lord you meant that was evil and god said yeah but you was thinking it was all right come on now but cleave to that which is good there's only one i know that's good and that's him be kindly affection one to another with brotherly love in honor preferring one another notice in honor preferring one another this this whole word on earth it deals with a deference which is a humble submission and a respect a reverence which is a deep respect for someone or something a regard to treat with deep respect i'm going to be honest with you those are things sometimes it's very challenging and you can say man if you want her i'll just say man for all of you it's challenging sometimes you understand it's little foxes that spoil the vine it is we're living in the hour of the manifestations of the son of god but we cannot be ignorant about the enemy and thinking god's just going to override it this is our responsibility the headstone above us his life reflecting down into our life it's in our hands that our lives stay as channels that are clear that he can operate through always remember one thing that my daddy told me he said son is when i first started even first started preaching and he said sonny said always live in this way he said take like a garden hose he said sometimes he said you know how what's happened he said is where it's hard to get that water out i said yeah i remember when there was kinks especially a lot of them old hoses we had man i mean you know you had something to be on 20 foot you're going to have kinks in those hoses and you'd wonder why isn't the water coming out the water's on he said son live your life so there's no kinks in the hose he said because it won't be anything wrong with the water supply there ain't nothing wrong with the nozzle on it it will be the kinks that you allow in the hose are you with me this is why the channels in our life that god directs you and i we are to be the branches he's divine nothing wrong with the vine the light is just as powerful in the vine but now how we need the grace of god in such a measure so that the life of the vine might pulsate through the branches is that right god never put the prophet on autopilot not at all he put things before him how are you going to handle this remember there's a great track test there's a great trial god didn't tell him what the test or the trial was coming up is that right but god let him know there's a test there's a trial that's coming it behoove of how that brother brown would conduct himself in many of those situations my goodness sometimes i think we're thinking glory to god i tell you what lord pack me away it's time it's time to go in the rapture but we've got a responsibility if we can't reign as sons and daughters of god here how are we going to do it over there but there's got to be the character it's not just power there's no problem with the power it's character that goes with it reverence and deference and i believe that's what we that's what we desire in our hearts that's why we're here tonight is that right you see this is where as we see this in brother branham as he would write of this and speak of this and preferring one another always prefer one another he said that's the life of christ to prefer your brother or your sister and that prefer in honor in respect not only what's deep seated but also a respect that's expressed so that's the life of christ to prefer your brother sister prefer means they're before you they're above you this is what this is what it's speaking of matter of fact let me pick up that scripture philippians 2 3 and then i'll move on let nothing be done through strife or vainglory that's us putting ourselves forward but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves better than esteem prefer this means to think better say god help us yes help us lord jesus if they were wrong brother brown says if they're wrong that's all right you'll never make them any better by kicking them around put an arm around them and pick them up i referred this made a comment sometimes when we're looking at honor sometimes there's things that we look at where honor is due or sometimes where it's very easy it's very easy for honor to be given respect sometimes it's very it can be challenging sometimes it's our just just our thinking about things could be very challenging our thoughts about what we see somebody doing or why they're not doing this let me give an example brother brown used brother brown made a statement where evidently there were after there were things that got set into the tabernacle one man wrote and said my you've got such a ministry like the ministry of elijah and here you are taking weeks off and going and setting next to a stream you should be ashamed of yourself so brother billy paul said daddy can i write him back no this isn't the message so he writes him back he said sir he said brother he said i want you to remember he says you said that his ministry compared to that of elijah he said i remind you that elijah set by a stream for a great period of time and brother brahm is dealing with dealing with situations of things that sometimes how things in our mind the way that we think sometimes that we can get our thoughts about something to where we're actually judging what somebody else is doing or they're not doing and immediately that sets in a place that we in our minds no longer lowly but we've set ourselves up in a place to they should be doing this they should be doing that or they should be right but the brand brings it on down he says but we are led by the spirit of god somehow that fits in there there's a lot more there's a lot more to say within that as it falls that many times this is where at times things comes in as our thoughts our thinking about things and i think if we can just recognize it that way that it's simply our thoughts are our thoughts and they're always subject and under the lord god what do you say lord look at this because there's sometimes in situations of things that we we can come in contact with where it's not easy for honor to be given and those are things even our brother branham would address us on that he says you respect you he would speak of how you respect the office that the person would hold you know sometimes maybe your boss you you can't respect the man but you respect the office i mean the guy might be a womanizer and everything else he might be a drunka you know an abuser and everything else your respect is not for his actions not his wickedness it's the office his wickedness does not give a license to dishonor him are you with me that's for another time but let me just stay with this here these are things that's very very important now brother brandon would talk about with reverence he speaks of how david he said notice david said the lord is always before me reverence we ought to honor one another respect one another's brother and sister that's a good sign of christianity from your heart love those who do not love you love the unlovable jesus said if you do favors for those who do favors for you well the repub the public not republicans the publicans do the same thing you must be kind to those who are unkind to you do good for those who would do evil to you you believe these are just good words yeah these are good words but when you got to live them it's it's like coming back up you swallow it back down oh it's wonderful in the mouth but it gets down here oh because why there's a life is pushing out it's a molding of a character as we're eating the book we're taking of that life it's molding there's a power that comes with that word as we're taking that word in we find our character being molded and shaped you don't always see it right away but a test or a trial comes up in your and then god will allow it to come up to show you you're not the same there's molding that's taking place in your life you're being changed from glory unto glory unto glory just let me just move to this point here tonight and and i want to just come to this place with this you look at david and this for some years and times it's just all this this whole part is spoke on at different times with david and saul and things but it's just been something so it means so personal to me i can see so many things within this this part of it to where we know the types of saul coming in and saw being the people's choice and saul being a type of where that organizational spirit entered in and they wanted to be like the world but then we find in a place to where now when god has come to a place where he's rejected saul spewed him out he's rejected him now it comes to a place that god said i've got one that i've i chose one to myself and he led samuel to that place and we know that he directed samuel with the anointing oil with the word of promise to anoint david under the sacrifice and here is it's a secret coming and here here we find this of here's david he's anointed king in israel there's so many parts you could preach every attribute of first corinthians 13 in david's life right here david doesn't run away from that meeting and say i've been anointed no what was done in secret he will reveal openly so here's a working that's taking place in david's life and the scripture would say it like this i i may not read all of this scripture i'm just going to refer to them tonight but it would speak of how that david himself here after he's anointed he comes there and you know there's a defeat there of goliath and after that there are very important words that we find throughout the scriptures it speaks in first samuel 18 5 that david went wet went out whither so ever saul sent him and behaved himself wisely david never said i don't have to do what you're telling me because i've been anointed king. he showed there was a reflection of the throne being reflected in his behavior are you with me he was being reflected he behaved himself as a wise virgin wisely one was filled with oil think about this things were told and saul got angry so got angry that sauce killed thousands david's is ten thousand saul got upset jealousy he's jealous we can go on and on an evil spirit comes upon saul think about this david has been playing for saul he's been playing the harp to do what to drive away that evil spirit to change to try to change that atmosphere that's around there but twice the bible says saul picked up the javelin and threw it at it once would have probably been enough for me because saul was a sharpshooter are you with me but twice the bible says if you refer to it first samuel 18 11 he threw it at it there was two different times look what david's doing david is continuing to present himself and honor saul why is he honoring saul because the lord hath anointed him he could have acted rudely unbecomingly he could have said why are you doing this to me see this just shows but what here's the thing what saul begins to go through and say verse 12 saul was afraid of david because the lord was with him and was departed from saul saul could see god was with david it wasn't just in killing goliath but many some of the times there was goliath on the battlefield but he also had to kill the goliath that wanted to raise up in his life to get back at saul come on there's a lot of goliath that's already been removed from your life my this went drinking winter makeup winter this winter that winter this went but now it comes to a time in the morning of character you say oh god and there's no desire to be that way to have that feeling there in your life but there's a molding and a shaping that's going on what's happening he's preparing you for the throne he's preparing you to rule and reign with him even as he overcame and is sat down with his father in history the bible goes on to say verse 14 and david behaved himself wisely in all his ways and the lord was with him he keeps on saying this in verse 30 david behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of saul so that his name was much set by most of you if not all of us know david he's a man that's on the run he's regarded as a fugitive saul's after him this is a man when he sets down he's got to watch his back he's got to watch the people he's talking to he's got to keep an eye out the whole time and here god arranges a situation in first samuel 24 and i'm not going to read it but saul comes to rest in a cave and he's seeking after david let me just say this to you if this events have been different i wonder if we'd read any more of david but you see listen to me now god had anointed david there's nothing listen to me now there's nothing that could keep david from getting to the throne i could really preach right here but all the molding that has to take place throughout until it's ready to rain all of that molding through there it's not going to be handed to david david's going to have to run for his life this is not a game he's running for his life he's dodging he's moving around but at the same time character is being molded what's coming out what god saw in him from the foundation of the world here's a man after my own heart put him under pressure and it'll come out hallelujah god didn't have confidence in the flesh of david it was a seed that was inside of david hallelujah and here in verse 4 the men of david said to him here saul asleep behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thy hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then david arose and cut off the skirt of saul's robe privately and it came to pass that david's heart smote him because he had cut off saul's skirt that's the kind of heart we want to have a heart that's tender brother brahm says i want to be so sensitive till i'll know the least little thing that grieves him david said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lord's anointed to stretch forth my hand against him seeing he's the anointed of the lord you know what david's doing in this verse he's giving honor to his men because he's leading them they need leadership they need leadership they're looking at going this way or going that way they need led and god through david honors those men at that time knowing their desire is to serve him and to serve david so god provides leadership that that can continue that's honor no wonder the bible would say husbands giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel is that right so david he stayed there i i don't have time to just go with all this but david stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to rise against saul but saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way and david also arose up afterward and went out of the cave and cried after saul saying my lord the king what honor a man that's been chasing you down a man that's tried every little way to lay traps for you here and there come on now he set this up and set that up and set this up had spies spying on you and yet the response is my lord the king david this was without the holy ghost how much more with the holy ghost hallelujah amen we're talking about a reflection of the throne david stooped with his face to the earth and bowed himself david submitted himself he goes on you know see david just speaks of it how's he shows him the skirt god the lord delivered you into my hand today but to show you i will not touch the lord's anointed you see david's honor was to the word this was a testimony of the king that god himself would set up his own son it would be an honor to the word above his own hunger and honor to the word above every test and temptation and everything that would come his way he would be tested in all points such as we are it would be a test but yet he would honor the word above his own feelings his own wants are you with me here is david let's say no i will not touch the lord's anointed it's the word david is honoring that's a contrast to saul saul has not honored the word when it what fits saul works for saul works this time it's all right if i've got to step in and be the priest i'll step in and be the priest and the prophet saul had no thoughts about crossing over and taking another position or moving into other areas of authority thought nothing of it why fear was removed from saul for him to even intrude in the office of a prophet and say well i'll just offer it up on my own god has an order and you cannot go outside of the order and god said well i'll just bless it god blesses the order of his word given by his spirit amen hallelujah when god came down to the tabernacle in the wilderness that was god saying this is my order come from vision to word now to manifestation same way in that the river jordan save away in this hour where god unites with his bride it's come under the order of the word and it welcomes his dwelling here's david so i i just there's i i'm just going to refer to this you know saul comes to place remember what he's witnessing he says you're more righteous than i bet if we ask david david you ever think you'd hear saul say that i don't know if he'd ever say it or not but david wasn't doing what he was doing to have saul say this to him what david did he did it as unto the lord he knew that even in the midst of pressure when things were being said and things were being done if i stand upon god's word he honored god's word and because he honored god's word he could honor a man that was in the wrong are you with me he could honor saul look at this you see in first samuel 24 20 here's what saul says after seeing this now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand nobody told me nobody told saul david didn't run headlines david didn't put it on his facebook david didn't put it on twitter david didn't it was something to be displayed it's a character to be displayed what more fitting for a kingly character than to be tested by another king than to have a king who's coming to hunt you down wanting to kill you wanting to do everything he can to take your life but it wasn't saul it was the spirit are you with me it was a spirit behind him david knew that david knew that think of this there was a reflection of royalty going on you remember when the news came some some fellas thought they were bringing some good news to david the malachite came to david and said saul and jonathan are gone he begins to speak to david remember he announces that saul was still struggling for life and he went and finished him off david said dumb dumb dumb david took that man and he told the rest of him kill him he said because i would not touch the lord's anointing and you didn't know better but you touched god's anointed your life shall not remain what reverence that david had for saul even to where he would call out for not just jonathan but saul as well they were swifter than eagles let all israel mourn david mourned this is why another part we're not even close to it this is why love does not rejoice in iniquity love rejoices in truth hallelujah then you had another one that came they come to it you know you see things that took place david would not condone animosity against saul's house even when joab came against abner david said that blood will not be upon me and when it came time for solomon to take the throne one of the things that david tells solomon don't you let his head stay on him why because joab will do what joab wants to do when it fits joanna when he wants to be compliant he'll be compliant are you with me he went right up the things that joy did you see what it shows is self-will can't make it into the kingdom self-will is to be surrendered and dissolved to the leading of the lord oh my think of this here comes remember they killed one of the sons of ishabeth the these it's funny how you know it's something that these these men missed the anointing of the hour they killed uh and i don't know if i got the name right is she'll beth or whatever it is but they they killed him and they come running to david we have taken away those of a son of your adversary of your enemy david said kill him because you've touched the lord's anointed david never stood there and said you know what saul got what was coming to him he should have never did what he did isn't it funny how when somebody does this wrong we just know we've got thus saith the lord and whoever they are they're wrong the wrath of god is upon them oh my i'm glad it wasn't upon me because there's no doubt there's been a many times i've been wrong then you have even of that of jonathan's son where david even asked chapters and chapters later is there any one of saul's household still left that i may honor him is there anyone left that i may honor him and there was one a son of jonathan remember how david had him bring him david said he'll always eat at my table you'll always eat here it's a behavior that's fit for the throne and we're going we're going in a rapture what's going to be raptured is character sometimes the things like this we can read about and then the times when we're going through it but just to remind just to remind you maybe strip your mind here going through it and feeling certain ways having certain feelings arise does not make you a sinner or an unbeliever or a make-believer there's a struggle but as a son and daughter of god it's an opportunity to prevail to allow god's word to prevail this is why in our lives oh god keep me close to you lord keep me close to you this is why there's a sure the baptism of the holy ghost in our life it's brought a change in our life that's absolutely right it changed our desire it changed our nature there's things that still how the enemy would want to come but there's a strength on the there's a strength on the inside there's a desire that wants to please the lord and because of that desire that wants to please the lord that fears him in all of these things this is why we stand and say god mold me and shape me lord jesus this feeling that i have or it's something that god makes known in your life don't pull back on it that's the time to surrender that's the time to say lord cleanse me lord lord remove that lord in my life lord i don't want that there you see this is why you're you're standing like david where david said i hate that which thou hatest oh god stand on the side of the word stand against the opposition of the enemy and stand there god is faithful to his word this is the desire that we have in our life what pulsates in our hearts is that his life would be reflected in us not just in here but out there no matter where we go it's that the testimony that's left behind if that's a christian there's something real about their life because whether we know it or not somebody's watching our life you've had it sometimes on the job you've had it in other situations you've had things that come your way where things you could act unbecomingly maybe you did act a little rudely but what did you do with that did you turn right back around did you tell your family i shouldn't have acted this way i shouldn't have went this way i shouldn't have said that or go to your boss you know what i said that in the wrong way forgive me i might disagree with you but you're still my boss this is we're talking about character that's going to the throne reflect it oh god listen friends don't don't get down on yourself that's not why god brought it take it in tonight and say lord be it unto me let him just brood over your life let him just move in your heart let him just change you because he brings us to our attention because he loves us and he remember what he told us at the beginning he wants to reflect his life deeper through our lives amen let's pray heavenly father lord jesus you know every heart lord you know every every life lord as we look upon these things lord your god just just skimming through that and seeing in a reflection of a life thereof david lord jesus i'm sure the scriptures doesn't record it but i'm sure david had a lot of thoughts that went through the scriptures don't re record it lord altogether how that david had struggling i wonder how many times in prayer that david had for saul how many times the where you come to a place to where david could move into a place lord of prayer to where lord he was interceding for saul he wasn't putting him down in your presence lord god he would be praying for him and through that lord well we read of the strength that he received from you [Music] no wonder lord how the prophet would be led by your spirit to take psalms 27 as the text for the rapture to give the setting we knew lord that say many that were on the scene many knew first thessalonians first corinthians 15 many of these promises if they would think about the rapture but your prophet when he would take that he would when he reads that text he said i'm doing this for a background lord of background is a setting where things lord would come up and come against us david david he declared from his life the lord is the strength of my life and lord as believers tonight your god i believe i'm one of them and i believe i'm speaking to believers tonight hearts that desire more than anything lord that your life would be reflected through us lord jesus we're not perfect but neither are we making excuses for anything lord we want to be molded we want to be shaped lord god i pray lord help us lord help us to die more to our pride help us to die more to our own feelings about things die more to our thoughts help us to recognize the lord and not get not get down or come under condemnation for dealing with things like that but may we recognize lord those are things lord how the enemy would come he would come against us but may we recognize this is an opportunity we're taking a stand against that because lord we love you we fear you lord we fear lord as brother brown could say i fear my mother fear my wife he went on and on and on and on help us lord tonight help us to grow lord truly lord if i were just to look at this by my own mortal strength i can say there's no way that i'm so glad it's not by my mortal strength lord i'm grateful lord god it's by your strength lord we know that but lord the life that's within us that paul says within us that desires that stands against that lord may lord is the children of god tonight may they recognize lord that that's part of the victory itself is recognizing that opposition recognizing lord that that's not part of who i am it's not part of my nature that's there's they're not comfortable with those feelings or thoughts or whatever when they come granny lord jesus may you move lord i pray for every life every heart help us lord continue to mold us and shape us lord until that moment in that day of the transplanting lord where the character that's been molded and shaped in this life will be placed there on the other side granted lord may our lives be real reflections of the throne lord help us lord i pray we love you in the precious name of the lord jesus christ oh let's just let's just let's just love on him let's just invite him let's just worship him these these moments look let the water let it just soak into our lives let it be a time a moment of consecration let it be a time say oh god i thank you for your word lord thank you lord for your [Music] word [Music] [Applause] [Music] sing [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] i [Music] his presence [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you know you think about it we've ministered on this before it's right here even in medical science and so forth how many when they'll talk about when they go to deal with a cancer patient that many of the times when they'll deal with one thing first thing they'll deal with is is there anything in their life a grudge unforgiveness or any of those things they said because if there's something like that that's there the medicine generally doesn't work then you find the things that you know you they find the things and this is just things you know years and years ago i brought out what brother branham remember he tells about worry causes cancer and goes through these things he talks about grudges i'm not saying that everybody that's had dementia or whatever more but find out how medical science goes into that they says a lot of times it's time to be very tied into where there's a grudge there's something that's been held there that's not been tended to let me just say this to you whether that's a hundred percent accurate or not i don't want no grudges i don't want nothing in my life [Music] but jesus i don't want to give no place to the enemy i don't want to give no excuse david could have gave a lot of excuses he could have done everything in the world against saul [Music] but i wonder how many times brother brian that david was off somewhere praying god this feeling lord i have lord what saul has done but through prayer he would press into a way to where he would feel sorry for saul he would get to a place to where he went no more complaining he said brother samuel how can you say that because his respect to saul kept going that shows that david got to a place before god because we can never stand in god's presence and accuse somebody else if we can accuse anybody then we're not in his presence but when we get in his presence we can't accuse anybody the braham says you'll find yourself praying for them and having an understanding for them i tell you this is deep with cream on top it's not deep because i'm preaching it that's deep because this requires a real wrestling it out it requires strength from god like you have the same way i'd love to have a switch i can just flip somebody says something the wrong way to that switch just flips boy autopilot no it don't happen that way but there is something that is automatic on the inside and that's charity and charity says you can override it you can override it oh i'm so grateful well when we consider where we're going where we're going what god has called us to we look everything around oh god it's not just where we're going but that his life might flow freely flow freely let's sing it one more time [Music] singing [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] sure lord jesus we just lord ask your blessing lord that you just go with us lord watch over our lives lord the word that you've delivered to our hearts oh god lord that it finds fertile ground lord we just want to yield to your voice we want to yield o god to you help us lord i pray mold us and make us lord o god how we love you lord i thank you father tonight for your grace your mercy upon our lives father go with us as we go our separate ways in the name of jesus christ singing surrender all right surrender i [Music] [Applause] take your eyes [Music] all to jesus [Music] let me [Music] [Applause] me [Music] [Music] save yourself [Music]
