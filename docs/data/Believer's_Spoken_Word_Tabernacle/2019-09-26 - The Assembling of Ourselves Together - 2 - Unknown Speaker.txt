so glad [Music] to drink that bitter homo he brave father let it pass for me he didn't call from my hands that torment me not for my call [Music] Oh [Music] Oh and forever my soul [Music] what love you know I just just heard by the random the other morning listen to it Ibrahim grace Covenant and this statement has always been one of those things that grabs ahold of your heart and just wants to wring it out but to realize when God displayed this covenant to Abraham and confirmed it God was displaying that he is the one that's determined to save man we're not here tonight by our determination we're here because he determined and there's something about it that his determination that he had when it takes residence in our lives and begins to draw us then we say like Paul it's not either liveth its Christ who liveth in me our determination is that of his life in us that he will achieve what he has promised amen what grace what grace they God help us to get out of the way that he can achieve what only he can do amen just so appreciate you in the Lord tonight and just want to turn our attention to the word if you'd like to stand with me appreciate all the music song leading tonight song is it I'll do each time it's always a refreshing for me when I'm in the back many times if they don't have my speaker up in the back I let them know I send them a little text and say get it turned up because I so appreciate the singing and the worship of the Saints have gone it just does my heart good to hear you out here worshiping because I know that there's times like with we're Paul and Silas it's of a test or trial you're in the midst of things that you don't feel like as far as fleshly worshipping but you're here to worship the Lord and you just kind of push beyond all of that if I could sense that how much more how much more the Lord Amen so we just we want to just turn our attentions to the word of the Lord tonight and just ask that God would just have his way back in Hebrews 10 I want to read go back to those verse of scripture so much within here within these verses of Scripture in Hebrews 10 in just verse 23 through verse 25 we'd like to read there in verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised and let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another so much the more as you see the Day approaching let's just bow our hearts before the Lord in a word of Prayer Lord Jesus we just want to say Lord we love you we just so appreciate you more your God I thank you Father for Lord every heart that was more than able to be here tonight what do you know that there's some Lord that no doubt there's situations with a job Lord and things Lord that have Lord in their body afflictions lord I just pray that God that you'll just minister Lord to each of our hearts Lord you know what we have need of Lord and father we believe your God that in you Lord we have all things freely given to us more so father tonight Lord we God have just come here to surrender of our hearts every one of us Lord that father you might be glorified in our midst that you might minister to every need Lord that is gathered here tonight may Lord every heart be encouraged Lord in the things of God and I pray that Lord that you'll just Lord take a hold if there is a heart that is not surrendered Lord may you be so lifted up tonight Lord O God that he would draw that heart Lord to you father in a real surrender Lord and and dedication Lord and may father with every one of our hearts Lord we be moved into a deeper dedication God a greater fervency Lord a greater carefulness Lord in our lives we love you and we just give ourselves to you now lord help us Lord God throughout the toils of the day Lord we Lord in our spirit and our mind Lord we could be weary but we're asking for strength for these few moments Lord that you would come and just speak to us and anoint us Lord to be able to hear your word and speak tonight we pray father granite may it travel beyond the years Lord and move down into the heart Lord God and father Lord too cause Lord to come to pass Lord what you have intended Lord to take place we pray we give ourselves to you now Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen god bless your being seated I certainly believe that every every word of God is important and I believe that where Paul led by the Spirit of God he's admonishing the the children of God sometimes there's things that we can begin to take for granted and I'll say in many instances it's not that we would do it on purpose but sometimes it's things that where we be get to a place of just the cares and become neglectful of things that are really really important and when I when I look at this we see that whether it be even in prayer and reading the Bible listening to the Word of God there's a lot of other things where the enemy can try to fill our time with a lot of other filler but you and I both know that yeah on God's table this is not a buffet with a bunch of filler that just tries to fill you up there's a lot of things with churches that they just want to fill people up as far as to make them fill in the part where they've done their religious duty but we recognize that that's not God's desire everything that God has he don't put any chemical in there to try to blow you up in one area of the word and deflate you in another area but God brings about well-rounded belief because that's what a Christian is every vitamin of the word we need it we need it for spiritual growth and so God is there to minister on our behalf into every need and when we look at this admonition that Paul would give to us as believers he would speak to us and admonish us to hold fast the profession of faith and then he would come around and say let us consider one another and I'll tell you in a challenge in the hour because these scriptures even become more real in the hour that we're living in because we know that we are living in the end time we are living in a time where the prophecies that have been prophesied are in the fulfillment right now we are seeing that day we see it approaching we realize we have arrived into this time that the Scriptures have spoke of within this hour there's not another messenger to come there's not another message to be given we have this is the last visitation to the Gentiles we're living in this time and God has kept every promise and you know to realize that within the midst of it that God would call to our hearts to let us consider one another to provoke one another unto love and to good works and I I think those are some big words considering that the spirit of this age is an age that is centered around self it's all about me and I've said this before and it's not a play on words but you know and but in years past you would have never found the term selfie in the dictionary but to think within this hour that it is a time to where they actually have a time and where selfie where people are so concerned with self image and presenting themselves in a likely manner and even to where that they will live under false narratives and pretenses and is such a pressure even that that would come with that but how that in a contrary that God would call for us to consider one another to provoke on to one another I'm to love and to good works and when to think that if God is called for this then God provides what is needed and I believe that it is the life within us because no matter how good that we could be as a person it takes that of eternal life that goes beyond and moves down there too because us in ourselves we come to an end but yet when the Holy Spirit is there the love of God it does for us what we and ourselves could never have done or dream possible we could never bring ourselves to the level of servitude that the love of God in our hearts can bring us to where the love of God can move upon our hearts that will actually cause us to forget our differences it will lift us into place to where we see the desire and the need for unity there's only one thing that can do that and that's the love of God and to see that within this Paul would go on to say not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together you know there's some things like we looked at it last week there's certain things that God will do for us and we we look at that even when it comes to you know the healing of our bodies we don't do that but God does that for us and to know that within this there are things that God has equipped us and called us to do and God will not do it for us God will not assemble us together we must assemble ourselves together you see there's certain things when you look at in the scriptures you'll find how faith is talked about you'll find the faith of God and then you'll find in the scriptures where Jesus rewards them upon their faith you give because you recognize that the faith of God it must move through alive but yet he will turn around and reward us based on our faith and you see our faith is that which is to be directed to the Living God in the Word of God that God might perform his word you know when we come here together it is our responsibility to be able to come together and to assemble ourselves together according to the word because he said where two or three are gathered together in my name there will I be in their midst also edu and I just coming here now let me just say this just us coming here is not going to invite him in our myths but it swear that we come here with a heart that I desire to hear from God and I'm not just here to hear remember I'm coming here to consider somebody else I'm not just showing up about me where it's about my needs and what can I get here tonight but I've come here tonight but I might be able to put my part in and make myself available that if God decides to use me then I want to be available that I can be a blessing to the body of which I am a part of so to think of it that this that's a part of it that is given to us and the Spirit of God itself bears record in us gathering together to think of how that God here was among the children of Israel to guide them in the pillar fire and then now when the pillar fire now becomes veiled within that the body the the that of the created body of the Lord Jesus Christ which God Himself made himself a body that he might come and redeem you and I back to himself and now in part that life that was actually we were intended to have from the beginning and to think how that he was God all along because when Paul sees him on the road to Damascus Paul asked him now remember Paul sees a light and it is alive that is greater than any of the heavenly objects the Sun it is a light that shines with great brilliance it is that same pillar of fire that moved there in Genesis 1 it's the same pillar fire that moved there in the burning bush it's the same Almighty God the angel of the Covenant that was with Israel and brought them in it was the same pillar of fire that stood there in the servant they're known as the captain of the Lord's host it's the same pillar of fire that's among the Church of the Living God and now that same pillar fire now coming back on the day of Pentecost and he begins to five himself he begins to break himself apart he is imparting his own life to his children it's called brother Ram would say it like this in one place of the message thirsting for life he said when we can get a vision of that he said it would just break your heart to think of the love of God of how that God was dividing himself among his children now to think of this that within it it's the same God now that was in the pillar fire manifested in a human body now separating himself among his people the Bible records in acts 2 but when they were gathered there together in one place and water corn oh my and when they got in that kind of a condition then the pillar fire came down according to the word and it did what they could not do but remember they had to assemble themselves together they had to get in one mind and one Accord before the Holy Ghost ever change you understand what I'm saying tonight many times we put things off and say well I need the Holy Ghost to get me in one Accord I need the Holy Ghost to get me in one mind but you see Satan is robbing us from the promises that belong to us to get in one mind and one Accord it's where we get our eyes off of ourselves and our eyes on the promise and when we got our eyes on the promise we are willing to sacrifice feelings and differences for what for the sake of the body of Jesus Christ Oh glory be to God and the pillar fire came down and it was like that the Bible says cloven tongues of fire appeared upon each of them amen you see God God knew exactly he's assembling his body that he has redeemed now brother bran would say like this he says we are not a divided people we've got to be in unity because each one of us is holding a part of God I want you to think of that we have been given a stewardship holding a part of God what will I do who is holding a part of God something to really think about in it oh my and we must come together and then the pillar fire is manifested in the wholeness in the fullness of it when his church sets together in heavenly places then the fullness of the power of God is in his church each one of us holding spiritual gifts and spiritual offices coming together brings that pillar of fire back again amen so within it how God saw how God divided himself it would be like if would take you know even I think where I live in it it was their way throughout the city itself before how things are set up like they have what they call a tract of land that they buy and when they buy that tract of land when they do that they go in there as a developer and they begin to set up certain Lots within there now what they begin to do is set up all these Lots within that subdivision because it has a whole division yet it's going to be broke into multiple parts and so God himself has never forgot about one of his children as a matter of fact the redemptive plan is all God working to assemble his body back to himself to where that he himself can be fully manifested in his body his redeemed body the bride of Jesus Christ so he's been assembling the redeemed attributes of God and there isn't you know less or or where oh we went out of the pillar of fire or we ran out of the Holy Ghost no sir it's JA briefing that is needed and God has not forgotten one he did not make more wedding garments that then were needed neither did he make the less he knows exactly what he's doing his program is not haphazard his program has been thought through from before the foundation of the world before the devil was even the devil he was God hallelujah when we sent in heavenly places baptized into the body of Jesus Christ and were prayed up with an expectation let me just read these four parts here in Mary's belief brother Bram said now his body's up there talking about on the meta toriel seat the throne of God his spirits down here his spirit God's Spirit that worked through that body his virgin born son in the fullness of God he works through you and I as portions of God that's why the Holy Spirit when it came on the day of Pentecost it broke all up that pillar fire and divided itself in licks of tongues and set up on each one we have to have one another the biggest thing that devil ever got on us was when we separated us from the love of God from one another and we love one another that's that's brotherly love he says now if you've got part of the Holy Ghost and I've got part of it and the next man's got part of us put us together there's three parts I'm three times as strong as I was with two brothers amen that's a scriptural principle all the way through the Scriptures amen and three times as strong as I was with two brothers oh my help me God to be a place when I come here to be one that can unite my faith with somebody else I don't know what the needs might be but but I'm here brother I'm here to help you take your Mountain I don't know what your need might be sister but I'm here to help you take your Mountain whether it be sickness in your body whether it be deliverance whether it be the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm here to help you that how you feel he said that's the way we stand now he says you know I'm a real Kentucky and together we stand divided we fall we must stand that way together Henderson what he said stand that way together stand what way recognizing what is in our heart the God the Christ in you desires to be united with the Christ in me it's like a puzzle piece it needs the other piece one piece is not the puzzle God set it up in the book of Acts that there would be a body ministry this is why this is why the Prophet would it Manas us in many different places in the scripture in in the message that would tell us if the if you don't feel in your heart where you can't wait till the church doors are open to where you can get in here and fellowship with brothers and sisters of like precious faith What did he say it's time you got to praying you see there's a check up tool because he would say in another place you long to go where other believers are gathered together because why is a part in you that loans to unite with the other parts of Christ in his body you see that's why that when when we want to let that man have the right away and not this guy amen so it is a part of the body coming together of which the Lord has provided for himself locally this is why Satan will try to cause divisions one of the first place to see works is to bring divisions within spirits because he knows if I can set up division in the spirit where things are catered to and things are you know moved upon then eventually it will lead to outward division come on friends you see it all starts within but within what happens it's cut off from the water supply because listen we are washed with the washing of water by the word I'm just trying to stay on track here you see this is why we listen to the message if listening to the message at home causes you to draw away from the rest of the body you're not being washed you're not getting what the message is all about you're hearing something and intellectually you are accumulating knowledge but you're not being watched because it's not a spirit of humility it is a spirit of vexation of self I hope you're with me now this is why a person say I pray every day boy I really did improve a lot and you want to withhold yourself from the body you're not making contact with God because you can't stand in the presence of God and hands remain with that lack of humility in your life come on somebody we're not to listen to the message as mere form you say I can't believe somebody would do that the Prophet said you can listen to it 24 hours a day but the spirit must be there to make it real and I'll tell you when the Holy Ghost makes the word real it brings you militate cause you recognize you're not the one who opened it up I just tell you so many times I'm walking and you know listening and Here I am in the car whoever how then I'm listening to the word I shake my head and bow my head how Christ the God and you know yeah I see it but what I see within it it brings a humanity that's the difference between listening and feeding I don't want you to be good listeners I want you to be fat as calves in the soil good feeders this is why brother random would say Shaitan won't let us stay one big sweet happy group it's his job to try to stir up stink you know why so there's parts of the word that are not favorable to this but it's got to be lived out hello somebody this is why the scripture exhorts us and once you think of this endeavor to keep the unity of the Spirit through the bonds of peace you know an endeavor means it's a military strategist and for the team what the bond of peace hello somebody sometimes those things that she does for the sake of unity yet you could say your plight and you'd be absolutely right come on you know what I'm done man but there's a part of it that you look beyond yourself and see the body you see the body you endeavor to keep the unity oh my now look at this in the book of Romans chapter 12 verse 3 Paul Center for I say through the grace given unto me that ever to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think help me Jesus Lord help help help Jill help us Jesus for everybody else and on the internet too if Paul is writing this he ain't writing it to unbelievers he's writing it because Paul knows even in himself he had to have a messenger of Satan to buffer him and keep him down if your revelations don't come with thorns they ain't revelations come on now when God moves within your life then all of a sudden here afflictions are coming why is that affliction it is to allow that which God has sown to come forth in our lives but here's how were to do it but to think soberly taking the right frame of mind according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith the measure of faith God has dealt that not we I didn't earn it I didn't merit it faint soberly God has dealt what I have God dealt it to me Paul goes on now and says in verse 4 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another now let's look at this in first Corinthians 12:12 with this this thought of it you see there is the body of Jesus Christ universal and then there are outposts brother random would call them outposts that are part of that great body like platoons that are in a regiment when we went there to Gettysburg last year I just stood there and I studied a lot of those things and I took pictures of those things on the wall and looked at it of how the different brigades and how that they were coming together and how that they were to be coordinated to work within the unity and harmony and I'm also very much was very much reminded of how that it was such a slim thin line where there was one particular man who was in charge day I think it's coming out of Devil's Rock that he came right out from there and he actually was gonna open it up and he did to where the Union would have been slaughtered by the Confederates because he thought he might just be able to do something but what he did he failed to stay within the orders that was given him man your posts stayed together with the rest that are on the front lines he almost cost the war I can't remember his name my father-in-law would probably remember and he's a walking history book but it comes right out of there and the man you know then within it it spoke to me in such a measure that literally maintain your position and always what God has said not what you think but stay where crowd has told you to stay their outposts that are part of that great body it's called a local body or an outpost now I want you to think of this as we read the scripture I want you to think of it universal and as well as local in verse 12 for as the body is one and hath many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body so also is Christ for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been they haven't been all made to drink into one spirit Jesus don't give out different cups but he asked him he said can you drink the cup that I had drink can you be baptized with that once I am baptized with they said yeh Lord he said surely you shall be you see what I like about this is because the Holy Ghost it's given for the Jew and the Gentile hey man it's given for the bond and the free you see all the way through here within the New Testament you see where it was poured out upon the Jews the door was also open to the Gentiles and it will return back to the Jews you see that there were those who were servants who received the Holy Ghost come on now there were those who were masters and on and on and on you know that received and were a part of the body of Jesus Christ you see when it comes down to the Holy Ghost don't look at nobody's social standing the Holy Ghost don't look back and say oh you've been too bad of a person oh you got a bad pass you know the Holy Ghost looks back to the past of what are you were in the mind of God and that's why the Holy Ghost sucks you out he then seek you up it he don't care what your family name was he can to bring the identification of what your real family name is that's what I'm talking about [Applause] girl repeater God and so within that listen to me the Holy Ghost don't make them differences either somebody with me now but it's this guy right here sometimes it might seem a little bit more fearful hey Paul had to deal with it James had to deal with it and you and I have to deal with it verse 14 for the body is not one member but many aren't you glad if the foot now watch this how how it unfolds I know we're familiar with it but let's just look at it if the foot shall say because I am NOT for hand I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I am NOT the eye I am NOT of the body is it therefore not of the body I want you to catch this God knew were each and every one of us he knew if I would be that if I would be the then fingernail and think for me singing there on the pinky or maybe I'm the one on the toe you know that's kind of always kind of lopsided on the side pinky toe or whatever you call it I don't know God knew God knew exactly where you and I would be placed within this body just like he knew with Israel he already knew where each of them would well in the promised land Jacob here known as Israel was able to call them forth and he was able to tell them what shall befall them in the latter days he would speak of the characteristics of their name and he would identify that their name would actually positionally place them in the land there of Israel are you with me their names would position them there was an allotted portion that was there for them but nobody could take that but it would be ministered to them in that designated time so you see sometimes the way that things can work is with this this very thing I want you to see this this very thing can be so settled instead and it's divisive because what it what it is if it's part of the body look because I'm not the hand I'm not of the body because I'm nothing I am NOT of the body listen to me now this is what the foot and the ear are saying are you with me they're not outside of the body this is what's inside of the body but they're not recognizing their position and the value of the body of Jesus Christ and the value that God has placed them in a local body instead they're looking at another member and saying because I'm not that member I'm not of the body we're not to look at one another we're to lift in the word and see the reflection of Christ in our lives you see sometimes what is been felt to be humility is not humility at all well I'm not very good and you know if I could do this you know you know maybe I would you know maybe I would give a you know a testimony if I was okay to speak in a microphone or maybe I you know I just can't play real well or I just can't don't withhold what God has entrusted to you but the brand takes a young man brother Brown walks to the platform and in front of everybody brother bream says young man they knows the young man I don't have the quote posted up here but big bream says young man he says you've been wanting to know what your position is in the body he said in what you can do he said I believe he said I can tell you if you want to know and he said I see you singing he said the way that you sing out here he says if you'll just yield to them I want you to catch something he was already singing but he wasn't yielding to it so because he went in yielding to it there was a little bit of constriction on the flow if the devil can try to point out all of those things well you're not worth again you're not this and you're not this and there would be all brother Sam you know there'd be a better person here and there'd be a better person here recognize where God has called you to be come on somebody and recognize God didn't call you because you were fitted for it he doesn't call those that are qualified he qualifies the call he doesn't call the equipped he equips the call didn't to send that you can such a you know it's just like deacons or trustees it's like every any one of us if you don't reveal to the Lord Foley you might get up and sing you might testify and yet not fully yielding but when you can fully yield you stand there and faith to know that this part in my life that God has ordained in my life it is set forth to whet Devils be a blessing to the body come on somebody don't have four oh my let me just preach let me preach yield what you are let it be brother man would teach us over and over let it be sanctified to his calling and purpose and at all times be available if the whole body look how paul interest is if the whole body were an eye where we're the hearing if the whole we're hearing where were the smelling can you imagine brother bond just a big glimmer a ssin of eyeballs you talk about a monster this is the body of Jesus Christ everybody is eyeballs everybody don't need to be eyes everybody don't need to be ears the ears are needed for certain things and God gave us what was needed two ears one mouth let me just say to you those are your ears you guard them they're not like two bins that you set out there for trash day where one collects trash and the other reflects recyclable gossip preach brother son our ears are not trash cans here's an aide to hear God's voice these lips and mouth were made to speak that which would edify the body [Applause] that was free but now God look at this man now God set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if they were all one member where were the body yeah no can you match have a bunch of arms it'd be the human octopus a bunch of legs come on somebody but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye I want you to watch this change what's this change in this verse and the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of you notice the change it went from because I'm not this now it changes because I am the eye I cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee neither can anybody that's a part of the body say what because we've received the eyes of God the prophet of God we have no need of the rest of the body liar we do have need of the entire body and the eyes are not outside of the body but the eyes are in the body that's why brother Brennan would say over and over and over he is manifesting himself in his church in these last days through the ministry that he has given to us never was divisive never was separation Estonia V well we could preach this thing nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you you see it still self this guy every day got to be crucified because one is looking at because I'm not this it's envy and then the other it comes around into another part I'm the eye I don't need no need of the hand remember what the hand represent both we're gonna preach to Helen yeah you know what the hand represents the hand represents the power of God they meant God operating through his people the Bible says in the book of Peter humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God is that right it was the hand of God that came upon Elijah when the minstrel played a lot of freebies coming out here one is envy and the other is pride and we all have to battle that thing well what's that thing called well whatever your first name is that's what it is mine is Samuel come on somebody laugh so if I can get now brother branham I can get william branham out of the way Jesus Christ can have a good time you see you are part of Christ by the Holy Ghost and so a mine we are part of each other then I need you I need the Christ in you and understand what I'm saying I need you to be you I don't need you to be somebody else you don't need me to be somebody else you need me just to yield and let God use according to what he is ordained for me oh my so to think of it verse twenty-two everybody okay if you're not we couldn't hear you verse 22 yay much more those members of the body once you look at these words which seem to be more feeble are necessary you know there's parts of the body you can't even see if they're right brother Dave there's parts of it you can't see my liver tonight but it's necessary there ain't no way brother bill my liver could take ahold of a hammer and use it it's too delicate but my hand can my liver might be that with Old Glory this is just good my liver might be behind the scenes you never see it brother Trevor you don't see my liver you don't see the lungs taking in there but you know there's something going on in the unseen what is it you can look at and say well I don't seem to have a vital part in taking this around but without belongs this can't do what it ought to do your part may not seem to be visible but you're on your knees praying and you're looking to God let me tell you the liver and the lungs and the heart is needed and a good EMRI of the world a good ultrasound will show it up whoo girl that Olivia hey man thank God for my kidneys brother I can't see my kidneys sometimes I felt things that felt like them thank God for them you know what they clean out a lot of the trash that gets in my body whoa whoa repeat of God thank God for brothers and sisters full of the Holy Ghost that sand there and say we're not gonna circulate toxins in the body this gossip stops right here we're not passing it through the rest of the body we don't need a mechanical dialysis machine we have got the cleansing power the Holy Ghost that's in the body of Jesus Christ [Applause] Bellary they're necessary let me tell you the services that we have is and because of brother Samuel I've got my part in it but it's you putting me in it's you putting in sister when you're on your way to work and you might think you know what I'm just going to pray right now for the service or somebody comes on your heart and you begin to pray for them let me tell you something what you're doing you're yielding to a Ministry of the Holy Ghost that's within the body to minister to his children I don't want to be an insulator of the Holy Ghost I don't want to be a conductor how do I know there's a good pass through on this electric running through here I see the lights I don't see brother Carlos I don't see them wires thank God I don't but I don't see them wife but I know they're doing that job every part is needful every part shanitha you think about it Michael you can't see my stomach but if my hands don't yield to the signals in my brain then this guy that's it's calling out you know it's calling out for nourishment you know why without nourishment this is not able to function like it ought to so I need to borrow the hand to grab a hold of the fork or the spoon and I need to eat it's a stomach the stomach ought to get its own food no God has made it so it's dependent upon one another well this that I mean the sales just you know the sales they're part of the body of Jesus Christ they ought to just get their own nutrients no they are dependent on the physical body taking in the nutrients into that and then the digestive system breaking it down and then it moving through all of those other systems respiratory system circulatory system nervous system it's necessary and one thing I'm glad about it gets where it needs to be sometimes my wife looks at me she said you just need to eat now don't the rest of you look at me like angels like that either you know exactly what I'm talking about she just you know put on here it's made to be mutually dependent upon others verse 23 and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow so we're mindful upon these we bestow more abundant honour and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but God hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor honor to that part which lacked you don't spend a hundred dollars on things to cover your face but just being close to $100 for shoes on your feet the faith it'll spend something to cover it but the other parts of our body we close are you with me you know what that means for the Brian sometimes that means we have to say not on clearance yet we got to put back for it come on now y'all know what I'm talking about you got kids you see they need shoes shoes are coming up or they they need jeans hello my holes and Swiss cheese in them and you look and you think man well we got to sit back for this right here we're gonna get get him some James what am I saying sometimes it takes a lot of investment on the uncomely parts this is why I love covered the multitude of sin this is why the body we do not delight in wrong come on somebody we do not delight in wrong we don't delight it's not about hiding sin but we we we desire you know it's like look remember Balak Balak looks and he pointed out all the highlander parts come on somebody we don't want that Balak anointing punting out all the honda parts who when Balaam they're the sacrifices were offered and the stand and the Spirit of God came upon Balaam one that he did not speak of all their Honda parts and let me tell you something they had uncomely heiner parts if anybody could have been criticized and shredded and pour down they could have but let me tell you something there was a covenant that they were under and God Himself god knows just how to stand up he ain't gonna let him get by with sin but neither is God gonna let somebody waddle up criticize him what feed on him but God said they're my children I sent a message down there I shed the blood I brought them out God said I ain't gonna let a loose tongue time down but I said my voice what wisdom you know what wisdom verse 25 that there should be no schism in the body what's that division but that the members should have the same care one for the other and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it brother BAM looked up on Oral Roberts place and said Lord yes you couldn't trust me he gave Oral Roberts a place like this yes you couldn't trust me with something like that but God said look up I'm your portion brother brandon got to criticizing I know it's ain't popular but it's truth I preached all the message not just the quotes that are favorable brother Brahim stands there this is in the India trip word made flesh also in the Holy Ghost series brother Bram talks about how he got to criticizing another man he was reading his book and then he got to seen with this man and some of the things on the sidelines let me just tell you though I'm not gonna call the man's name that he was criticizing but Humana looked at it and that man there were some things that could have been criticized but the holy ghost rebuked the Prophet and brother Bram says I realized I've got a selfish critical spirit on me that's when he identifies it as he goes on in the message Jubilee year and talks about it's all in the same realm in years and months see this is why I can follow a man like this God's already vindicated this is the truth I'm under the sail of the Holy Ghost in this word but I can look at that you don't bother me cuz you know why I see the same battles but there's one thing about it I see but profit was man enough to admit it and humble enough to Humble himself and say light cleanse me where he could even say I'm gonna blast my heart out divine wisdom put it all together this is where in this scripture how I'm coming down I was just gonna we're just gonna have to close here there's just no way in the world I can I can finish this out but divine wisdom has put this together so the members of the body are not to have that of schisms I want you to listen this it's not to be divided from each other and acting upon separate interest that's as the body universal and as a local body that's why it's in in a local body if a person starts acting in their own interest then they've got to make a decision either you keep moving with this platoon or you ask God if you need to be assigned to another one I'm just gonna preach straight because when you begin to act in your own interest you're not acting according to the Holy Ghost when you put your needs above the rest of the body that is not the Holy Ghost hallelujah but it ought to be where it is well affected to each other tenderly concerned for one another and feeling in the griefs and a communion as well as in one another's pleasures and joys sometimes where it's somebody's experiencing a joy and you're not experiencing a joy come on somebody this is where sacrifice comes in sacrifice that there would be no schism in the body that all members would be we're under that bond of love let me just say this to you when affection begins to decay those are the seeds of schism when Christians grow cold toward one another they become careless and unconcerned for each other well I'm not coming to church because the piano is too loud you're selfish well I'm not coming to church because don't withhold your puzzle-piece realize it's a peace that came from God and the greatest way you're gonna lie I'm gonna I'm gonna hold this piece and I'm just gonna hold this piece you're not going in the rapture by yourself you're gonna have to let go of the peace and let it come with the rest of the body and if you do that we'll see more of the picture don't lose that love where you grow cold and indifferent the dude says in Jude 1 keep yourselves in the love of God keep yourselves praying in the Holy Ghost let us make ourselves available unto God available now once you just - just to think of this here for a moment Paul goes on to say here I'm not gonna read these verses but let me just refer to him can I do that and just drop this point Paul goes on and he goes on to reiterate we are members in the body in particular he goes on to say are we all apostles are we all profits and God said some in the church and God said them in their have all gifts of healing do all speak with tongues interpret but in verse 31 at first Corinthians 12 I do want you to put that one up there but covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way Paul don't take away the gifts but he's shown and letting them be under the governance of love are all of us gifted the same way no even those of us that would have the same gift but yet we're not the same you couldn't go to somebody else I know if you're gonna be a pastor we're gonna have to be exactly like brother Samuel no God is not a cooker cookie cutter God you with me that's why God had there's such a diversity of gifts man I who I mean there's brothers that can just ten and just teach it take the PowerPoint and go right through and whip the devil I think lord have mercy how do they do that without sweaty begin understand I just have to do and in my simple way that God has given me and not try to do this and there might be times like I have used that in the past that I felt like that was what God wanted me to do for that service or services but I you know that that's really not my forte if I can say it that way I'm like a duck out of water and those types of things like that but God he made us all different God made as special singers even those who sing specials he made you different practice makes me nervous that's me I like singing about like seeing of everybody young with me I like singing with everybody the practice makes me nervous get it up like this or get it up like that let me give a mic and let's let her fly let's just see what Jesus does when he comes on the scene but you see if I try to do it the other way I'm not that he'll dick this is why Paul could say that the Church of the Living God is the manifold wisdom of God that means variegated with Brian when you picked out your landscaping you don't get a bunch of barberries and put them all around the house but you get barberries and you have yellow ones and then you have an accent of a blue spruce and then you have this little plum tree you have this of a yellow lily coming up at this time and it all accents one another and stands out just like my hand does not look like my eye my mouth does not look like my nose God hath put it all together it's the manifold wisdom of God you see every gift it works together to edify the body of Jesus Christ brother Brad would say it like this and I'm just going to close every person in the church and I want you to listen to me now if you can hone home right in on this every person so might say every person look at somebody say that's you just making sure you're awake and every person in the church has an individual ministry and that individual ministry goes together with the rest of the ministry to edify the body of Jesus Christ there's a little sister just to show you this in Romans 16 I love these little things in the scriptures how many heard Phoebe heard the name Phoebe it's Romans 16 verse 1 you know Paul would write he would write to many of the churches brother Brian and he would tell him and from Aquila and Priscilla Olson you know why people knew the character their lives and it was a comfort to it it'd be like Dave and Shirley it was a comfort to him look what he says concerning here I commend unto you Phoebe our sister which is a servant of the church which is in Sorrenti she stood out in that church as a servant that ye receive her in the lord has become a Saints and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you O Lord Paul's writing this about his sister for she have been a secured that means a helper of many and of myself also your Lord Paul you mean you've been helped by sister Phoebe oh you got understand I'm looking at the Christ that was in Phoebe that was able to minister to me let's just stop there tonight remember who is in you and who you are in your part may not seem visible but without it the body cannot function so coming together Lix a fire coming together amen let's pray how many just like a fresh dedication with this and Lord if I'm if I'm a fingernail let me just read etiquette myself Lord well wonder whatever I am let me just read edek ate myself to your Lord father Lord we ask this Lord tonight in the name of Jesus Christ for every need for every uplifted hand Lord to see their God the responsibility and the charge that's given to every one of us Lord may we Lord as we think soberly to recognize that you have set in the body just as you have ordained you have Phebe's in the body you've got Aquila and Priscilla the Lord God you've got every part that you've said in the body and every part of it is vital lord help us Lord to fulfill that of the scripture be considerate of one another be example nor to yield that great part of the mystery in our heart the pillar fire in our life with a letter let us just you the Lord God if there be any anything within us Lord any part that would hold back from uniting Lord God with one another maiden Lord Jesus we look to the blood of Jesus Christ nor look to strength which is able dear God to dissolve Lord O God it's you that we want to see glorified we've just Lord afresh tonight our hands by our hearts are lifted up to you we want to rededicate ourselves tonight Lord Lord God to be available to you sanctified at all times that you could use this Lord may we Lord God esteem who it is that called us and that part of the body that we're in Lord every part is vital every part is final I think brother banner pulled back the curtain and he pulled back that curtain he showed some livers and kidneys and lungs that had been on their face before God praying they weren't the ones out there that was the vessel that was preaching they weren't maybe the hands or the arm but they were behind pray Lord Jesus how that our Lord God we all can be in prayer we all can be in prayer a whole lot more Lord praying for one another praying for the body or Jesus help us Lord may we not Lord God despise or look down on but may we recognize the Lord that we are part of that body and the Holy Ghost moving within that body the finger is needed the little fingers needed the toe is needed every one of those toes is needed in order to stand balanced help us Lord we love you we appreciate you tonight in the name of Jesus Christ amen could be Stan let's just sing her sing a course here I'm so glad I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God I'm so glad [Music] [Applause] [Music]
