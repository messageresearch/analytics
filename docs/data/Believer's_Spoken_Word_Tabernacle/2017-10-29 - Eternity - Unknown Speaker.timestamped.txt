[42:16] feel comfortable this morning to go
[42:18] right into the word amen excited for
[42:20] what the Lord has for us this morning it
[42:22] turns with me to Psalms 139 if you would
[42:27] and I have a little thought of my heart
[42:29] this morning that's I've been on lately
[42:33] simple little thought on eternity Amen
[42:37] not that eternity is something simple
[42:38] Amen but but we just want to administer
[42:42] a few thoughts along the lines of
[42:44] eternity this morning eternal life
[42:47] Psalms 139 and I believe we'll just
[42:52] start the first verse here and this this
[42:54] Scripture is dealing with election amen
[42:58] I love this beautiful has searched me
[43:01] and known me thou knowest my down
[43:05] sitting and mine uprising
[43:06] now understand this my thought afar off
[43:09] thou Compass's my path and my lying down
[43:12] and art acquainted with all my ways for
[43:15] there is not a word in my tongue but lo
[43:17] o Lord thou knowest it all together
[43:20] thou has beset me behind him before and
[43:23] has laid thy hand upon
[43:24] me such knowledge is too wonderful for
[43:26] me it is high
[43:27] I cannot attain unto it but whither
[43:30] shall I go for my presence hallelujah
[43:32] from my spirit or whither shall I flee
[43:34] from thy presence if I send up into
[43:37] heaven thou art there if I make my bed
[43:39] in hell behold thou art there if I take
[43:43] the wings of the morning and dwell in
[43:44] the uttermost parts of the sea even
[43:45] there shall thy hand lead me and thy
[43:47] right hand shall hold me come down to
[43:50] the fifteenth verse my substance was not
[43:52] hid from thee when I was made in secret
[43:55] and curiously wrought in the lowest
[43:57] parts of the earth
[43:58] thine eyes did see my substance yet
[44:00] being unperfect and in thy book all my
[44:03] members were written which in
[44:05] continuance were fashioned when as yet
[44:08] there were none of them amen turn with
[44:11] me also to revelations 21 we've read a
[44:13] chapter on election I want to read one
[44:15] on predestination amen we want to read
[44:18] about a future home that's waiting for
[44:20] us revelations 21 one through seven and
[44:26] I saw a new heaven and a new earth for
[44:29] the first heaven and the first Earth
[44:31] were passed away and there was no more
[44:33] sea and I John saw the holy city New
[44:35] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[44:37] heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[44:39] her husband and I heard a great voice
[44:42] out of heaven saying behold the
[44:43] tabernacle of God is with men and he
[44:46] will dwell with them and they shall be
[44:49] his people and God himself shall be with
[44:52] them and be their God you know that in
[44:54] this chapter here is all the heart
[44:57] desire of God is revealed here amen
[44:59] from the very beginning the Prophet said
[45:01] he desired in love family of his own he
[45:04] desired fellowship with his children
[45:05] amen and now we find the mind of God in
[45:07] the plan of God the perfect will of God
[45:09] is to bring about this future home amen
[45:11] where he'll be our God and we'll be his
[45:13] children amen and God shall wipe away
[45:15] all tears from their eyes there shall be
[45:17] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[45:20] neither shall there be any more pain for
[45:21] the former things are passed away and he
[45:25] that sat upon the throne said behold I
[45:27] make all things new and he said unto me
[45:30] write for these words are true and
[45:31] faithful he said unto me it is done I am
[45:35] Alpha and Omega
[45:37] the beginning and the end amen I will
[45:41] give unto him that his thirsty of the
[45:43] fountain of the water of life freely he
[45:44] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[45:46] and I will be his God and he will be my
[45:49] son
[45:50] amen aren't you glad for that let's just
[45:52] pray Heavenly Father knowing that we're
[45:58] not feeding on a dead letter Lord or
[45:59] philosophies of men but Lord it's the
[46:01] body word of the son of man father
[46:04] that's still speaking in our myths Lord
[46:06] though the body of our prophet even the
[46:08] body of our Messiah Lord doesn't walk
[46:10] the earth with us today but the same
[46:11] word Lord
[46:12] a man is tabernacled itself in this
[46:14] little bride Lord raised up gifts and
[46:16] callings and anointings Lord to minister
[46:19] to us father so lord whatever we have on
[46:21] our heart this morning Lord whatever the
[46:23] need of the people would be father and
[46:25] me myself Lord the needs on my heart
[46:27] Lord the needs in our in our Assembly
[46:29] father Lord I'm raising them to You Lord
[46:31] trusting father that something could be
[46:33] said this morning Lord that your Holy
[46:35] Spirit would so have control over the
[46:37] service Lord that you would say exactly
[46:38] what you want to say father Lord and
[46:41] that your will would be done here in our
[46:42] midst father Lord and we sacrifice to
[46:45] you now everything that would hinder
[46:46] that Lord every idea every opinion every
[46:49] agenda Lord every funny feeling Lord
[46:51] every discomfort lord or whatever would
[46:54] be on our minds Lord we've surrendered
[46:55] that to you father asking your Holy
[46:57] Spirit to take control of this service
[46:59] as we dedicate it to you now in Jesus
[47:01] Christ's name Amen amen amen god bless
[47:05] you may be seated and then once again
[47:07] it's just good to be with you we bring
[47:08] you greetings from the assembly there
[47:10] and Bluffton and and and which my wife
[47:15] and our new little baby could have been
[47:17] with me this morning but I'm sad to
[47:19] report that they stayed home so amen
[47:22] I'll just have to do amen but if you
[47:27] didn't know God has blessed us with our
[47:28] first little baby a little baby girl and
[47:30] and we're just real thankful for that
[47:34] amen but we're on this subject of
[47:37] eternity amen and and we know the
[47:41] Prophet talked a lot about about eternal
[47:43] life the eternal life that we have as
[47:45] children of God and eternity we know
[47:47] means that never had a beginning and it
[47:49] had an end amen it's something beyond
[47:52] our understanding
[47:53] it's something we really can't grasp is
[47:55] this notion or this idea of eternity
[47:58] amen and yet I like to think about it a
[48:00] lot about what was back there before the
[48:05] foundation of the world because you know
[48:06] we get too caught up in the happenings
[48:09] of the world around us the condition of
[48:12] the world and we look at its politics
[48:13] and its Wars and its diplomacy and and
[48:16] and just the great histories being
[48:19] written around us even before our eyes
[48:20] prophecies being fulfilled and
[48:22] everything happening around us and to us
[48:25] it's such a grand thing in a such a
[48:27] grand order of this earth and amen so
[48:30] many machinations so many workings of
[48:32] this world and and and and it to us it's
[48:35] so significant because we're living in
[48:37] this time to us everything has such a
[48:39] great meaning and such a great
[48:40] importance a man but you know you could
[48:42] roll it all back before there was a
[48:45] human being on the face of the planet
[48:46] amen and you can roll it back even
[48:49] further before there was a world and
[48:50] before even there was a son amen before
[48:53] there was light or matter before
[48:55] existence before the very creation in
[48:57] the world he could roll it back and back
[48:58] and keep rolling it back eternity
[49:00] through eternity back to the very
[49:02] beginning amen amen before there was an
[49:05] atom there would be nothing there for
[49:06] you to find and yet God was there amen
[49:09] amen where did he come from we don't
[49:11] know amen how how could he be we don't
[49:14] know we can't understand that amen Oh
[49:16] what was he thinking about there brother
[49:18] sister by the grace of God we have an
[49:20] insight we know what he was thinking
[49:22] about because the love of God amen has
[49:26] made available to us a revelation Amen

[51:32] and it took farm amen how perfect is the
[51:35] word of God expressed all of creation

[51:53] everything into the right order into the
[51:54] right shape amen amen and that's what
[51:56] our lives is brother Graham said in
[51:58] Christ the mystery said the first thing
[52:00] was that God wanted to reveal himself to
[52:02] people and he couldn't do it as a great
[52:05] Hova God who covered all of space and
[52:08] time and eternity he could not he's too
[52:11] great to ever be revealed to people amen
[52:14] because it would be too mysterious John

[52:17] father at any time no man has seen the
[52:20] father at any time hallelujah amen no
[52:23] man escena he said how could that great
[52:24] being that never did begin and after you

[52:29] billions and trillions and trillions of
[52:31] years of light space and out on into the
[52:33] infinite into the eternity and a great
[52:36] creature that was all of that and he
[52:38] still is but what he wanted to do oh my
[52:41] he loved
[52:43] fatherhood for he was a father and the
[52:47] only way that he could express it was to
[52:49] become a son of man Holly just a think
[52:52] breath sister way back before all of
[52:53] matter exploded into existence and it
[52:55] scattered light out into space way back
[52:57] in the quietness of God's mind he was
[52:59] thinking about you
[53:00] he was thinking about his children he
[53:03] was thinking about you and his desire
[53:04] was to be a father to you to draw you to
[53:06] him self amen oh my he desired in love a
[53:10] family of his own amen in the church age
[53:12] his program said so when Adam was formed
[53:15] of the dust of the earth and his
[53:16] spiritual being was created by God then
[53:18] Adam became God's thought expressed and
[53:21] those eternal thoughts were now
[53:23] manifested and he said now down through
[53:25] the centuries we could go and we find a
[53:26] Moses we find a Jeremiah John the
[53:29] Baptist and each one of those was God's
[53:31] eternal thought expressed into its
[53:33] season amen every every bit of it every
[53:37] bit of Revelation that's been poured out
[53:39] through history was in God's mind in the
[53:41] beginning but piece by piece he is he
[53:43] has made it available to us he has
[53:47] become something we can understand he's
[53:49] become a being that we can touch and we
[53:51] can have fellowship with a man where
[53:53] once he was a mystery hallelujah a man
[53:55] once she was a great Godhead up there
[53:57] somewhere
[53:57] Amen out in some existence that we could
[54:01] not even comprehend in our mortal minds
[54:02] hallelujah but it was not his desire to
[54:04] be unavailable to his children
[54:07] anybody had a love for his family I'm in
[54:09] the closet self-deport himself in the
[54:11] history any poor prophet after prophet
[54:13] out and messenger after messenger to
[54:16] make himself known to you and I revealed
[54:19] himself to us what is that Sun man
[54:20] ministry it takes the mystery of God and
[54:23] it makes it plain to us it expresses the
[54:25] word then what is he Express to his
[54:30] bride is nothing but mercy Grace and
[54:32] love judgment but he has come and he's
[54:38] pitched his tent with us to have
[54:42] fellowship with us to be our friend and
[54:44] our Father and our Savior Oh glory to
[54:47] God no wonder no wonder John a man
[54:49] looking into the Old Testament no wonder
[54:51] he got so excited he said no man has
[54:53] seen the father at any time he's a
[54:55] mystery to us we can't understand him
[54:57] hallelujah but he said the word became
[54:59] flesh we're able to look upon him
[55:05] hallelujah where once he was a mystery
[55:07] now we could see clearly honey we could
[55:13] have fellowship with our Savior praise
[55:15] God
[55:16] Oh what condescension amen and brother I
[55:21] said that was Jesus he was the logos or
[55:24] the word amen the expression amen he was
[55:27] the perfect and complete thought
[55:29] expressed the fullness of a godhead in a
[55:32] body amen amen and and he became known
[55:36] as the word and that is what he is and
[55:38] forever will be now it says that he hath
[55:41] chosen us in him Jesus amen he's chosen
[55:46] us in him before the foundation of the
[55:49] world
[55:49] and he said that means that we were
[55:52] right there with him in the mind and
[55:54] thoughts of God before the foundation of
[55:56] the world and that gives an eternal
[56:00] quality to the elect and you can't get
[56:05] away from that hallelujah Amen you can't
[56:09] get away from that you ought to tell the
[56:11] devil that this morning
[56:13] then you want to notify the devil this
[56:14] morning you know Romans 9 it said that
[56:16] what's gone brother our messenger Paul
[56:19] he said what if God willing to show his
[56:21] wrath will choose out of the same clay
[56:23] he'd make one vessel to dishonor and
[56:25] another one to honor out of the same
[56:27] clay ain't been no merit to the clay but
[56:29] he chose a certain a certain portion of
[56:31] clay and he decided to make it a vest of
[56:33] the rack or a vessel of Mercy and it was
[56:35] his election decision Amen Appel said
[56:41] what what if what if God amen you know
[56:44] we would say that a little bit different
[56:45] in our modern English we would say so
[56:47] what how you know the devil likes to
[56:51] come sometime and say why do you why
[56:53] would you think God I would ever choose
[56:54] you

[57:20] how the Umbrella have said that stormy
[57:23] skies are no signs of god's disapproval
[57:25] Amen but he said that his proof or his
[57:28] love for us is because he told us he
[57:29] loved us
[57:30] amen and he proved it by election it was
[57:33] an elective love it was not based on
[57:35] your merit it was not based on your life
[57:37] it was not based on your successes
[57:45] hey man right in the church age book

[1:00:03] blackened and dark to those things and
[1:00:05] he said we all are our minds are
[1:00:07] blackened and dark but he said I just

[1:00:12] coincidence happening here we are sons
[1:00:16] and daughters of God in the beginning of

[1:08:01] written with ink you weren't written in
[1:08:02] a Sunday school or a seminar somewhere

[1:08:10] Spirit upon your fleshly tables of your
[1:08:12] heart you have been written you see
[1:08:15] expressed you were a thought in his mind
[1:08:17] but today you've been expressed or
[1:08:19] written epistle read of all men and
[1:08:20] brother Ram took that in the unveiling
[1:08:22] of God and it's so powerful he said I
[1:08:24] translate he said I turned it around
[1:08:25] this way I'll just paraphrase here I
[1:08:28] turn it around he said your epistles
[1:08:30] that have been written in other words
[1:08:31] hallelujah amen it's the manifested Word
[1:08:35] of God you're the manifest Word of God

[1:08:41] take away from the manifested Word of
[1:08:45] God don't you know brother sister that
[1:08:47] the devil would like to to add so many
[1:08:49] footnotes to the book of your life
[1:08:51] because he's been watching your mistakes
[1:08:53] and your failures and he's got all kinds
[1:08:55] of material he wants to add in there but
[1:08:57] because you're the spoken word of God
[1:08:59] because you're a seed child of God
[1:09:04] [Applause]

[1:09:21] quality that you can't get away from no
[1:09:23] matter what you do Hey many times we
[1:09:28] brother instantly backslide every day we
[1:09:31] get out that permissive will but he said
[1:09:33] something about the permissive will of
[1:09:34] God he said it always comes back to land
[1:09:54] for you but the perfect will of God will
[1:09:57] be done security oh my the manifested
[1:10:08] Word of God you can't add to it you
[1:10:10] can't take away from it in other words
[1:10:12] every elected child of God is just as
[1:10:15] infallible and divinely inspired as this
[1:10:19] Bible you are eternally inscribed on the
[1:10:26] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:10:28] only my father has given me amen no man
[1:10:32] shall pluck them out of my hand
[1:10:35] no weapon formed against you shall
[1:10:38] prosper Oh glory to God glory to God
[1:10:43] barely barely I say to you he that
[1:10:44] heareth my word and believeth on him
[1:10:47] that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:10:49] he hasn't Amen and he shall not come
[1:10:53] into condemnation but he's passed from
[1:10:55] death unto life
[1:10:59] what shall we say to these things it is
[1:11:02] God that justify hey man you shall not
[1:11:06] come into condemnation hallelujah
[1:11:10] why do you condemn yourself brother
[1:11:13] sister why do you allow the devil to
[1:11:15] whisper in your ear oh my I'd rather
[1:11:19] take the Word of God than any feeling
[1:11:21] any complex any fear or any uncertainty
[1:11:25] any frailty of this this body in this
[1:11:28] flesh I'm not looking at that I'm
[1:11:30] looking at the word man hey man now
[1:11:46] every word of God if you're the word of
[1:11:47] God then you have a purpose you have a
[1:11:50] purpose you are indispensable to the
[1:11:52] economy of God you are not insignificant
[1:11:54] rogram said you're not some coincidence
[1:11:56] you're not some mistake but every child
[1:11:58] of God is important vital because
[1:12:02] without if God would have lose one of
[1:12:04] his thoughts he would no longer be God
[1:12:06] his perfection would be would be
[1:12:08] transgressed but he's not going to lose
[1:12:10] the one of them hey man the Alette
[1:12:12] cannot be deceived
[1:12:14] she cannot fail God's church will be
[1:12:19] there just as sure as it can be sure
[1:12:21] just as Shores there's a world brother
[1:12:23] branham would say and he would say you
[1:12:25] know then you can take this earth you
[1:12:27] could take the dirt of this earth and
[1:12:28] science thinking they can take it and
[1:12:30] they can break it down into little
[1:12:38] pieces but not one little piece can be
[1:12:41] destroyed not one atom not one little
[1:12:46] iota of matter can be destroyed they can
[1:12:49] break it down they could burn this
[1:12:50] building and turn into actions scattered
[1:12:52] all over this world until I
[1:12:54] never be assembled again but you can't
[1:12:56] destroy one bit of it because it's the
[1:12:59] spoke how much more a child a seed the
[1:13:05] offspring of Jehovah cannot be destroyed
[1:13:08] she cannot piss away you could do a
[1:13:17] place like Saul where Saul was Beck's
[1:13:20] lived is such a point where he was
[1:13:21] consoling witches and he went to witch
[1:13:24] and he caught up the prophet Samuel
[1:13:37] that's the power of God's anointing he's
[1:13:40] choosing praise God hey man I believe in
[1:13:45] that kind of a grace I believe in it
[1:13:47] I need it hey man I'm resting on it
[1:13:51] praise God amen now every word of God
[1:13:54] has a purpose it has a part to play
[1:13:57] every joint of this body supplies amen
[1:14:00] amen
[1:14:01] it's a there's a dispensation for you
[1:14:03] now now God dispenses his word how many
[1:14:05] know that there's a dispensation brother
[1:14:07] Brad talked about there was a
[1:14:08] dispensation of Mosaic law and then a
[1:14:10] little bit more was dispensed amen and
[1:14:12] John the Baptist's and a little bit more
[1:14:14] was dispensed under Christ more was
[1:14:16] dispensed under church organization than
[1:14:18] the outpouring see dismiss the
[1:14:19] dispensation after distance' God's
[1:14:21] dispensing his work now but he's not
[1:14:23] just dispensing a message
[1:14:25] he's also dispensing his word in the
[1:14:27] form of a people to receive the message
[1:14:29] and live the message just as sure as God
[1:14:32] sent you Elijah the prophet god spoke
[1:14:36] you into this world to receive the
[1:14:37] message that Elijah was preaching amen
[1:14:40] he chose you to live it he chose you to
[1:14:42] fulfill it brother sister even now how
[1:14:44] can we say oh I can't live it brother
[1:14:46] sister I just I don't have enough faith
[1:14:48] I can't believe while you're believing
[1:14:51] what the devil's telling you
[1:15:05] [Applause]
[1:15:10] hey man brother I said when it comes to
[1:15:12] the gathering together at the end of the
[1:15:14] dispensation it'll be waiting for the
[1:15:17] manifestation of the sons of God in that
[1:15:19] desk and say what's this world groaning
[1:15:21] for for an adoption for a rapture for a
[1:15:24] bride to come to maturity a church to
[1:15:27] form God to form himself a temple and
[1:15:30] inhabit his people that's what the world
[1:15:32] is groaning for they're not groaning for
[1:15:34] a message they're not groaning for a
[1:15:36] tape now they're groaning for a little
[1:15:44] bit of faith for this rapture for this
[1:15:46] reed ench full redemption for this
[1:15:47] adoption every little bit of it lies on
[1:15:49] the on the message amen
[1:15:51] it lies in there but it wasn't meant to
[1:15:53] stay there because there's a people that
[1:15:55] have been dispensed into time seeds of
[1:15:59] God dispensed into bodies of time to
[1:16:01] receive this word and take a
[1:16:02] transformation oh yeah hey man something
[1:16:07] in my heart says that's me that's me I'm
[1:16:10] identified by that word hallelujah amen
[1:16:14] and it's waiting for the manifestation
[1:16:16] of the sons of God that he might gather
[1:16:17] all together all that has been brought
[1:16:19] into Christ he does the gathering he
[1:16:22] does the gathering oh my you know Isis
[1:16:24] fell shipping some brothers recently
[1:16:26] about adoption and how so many people
[1:16:28] have such a wrong picture about it about
[1:16:31] adoption because we're looking for a
[1:16:33] maturity we're looking for a character
[1:16:35] and many people get an attitude about it
[1:16:37] like well if I could just try harder if
[1:16:40] I could just be better somehow put more
[1:16:43] effort
[1:16:47] you know you know what I'm talking about
[1:16:49] if I could be dude if we could have more
[1:16:50] works that's the attitude that people
[1:16:52] have but brother we're not building this
[1:16:55] thing
[1:16:55] God's gathering it together God's doing
[1:17:00] the gallery
[1:17:01] hey man hallelujah we've been gathered

[1:17:11] spirit
[1:17:12] we are all baptized into one body now
[1:17:16] are we the sons of God amen
[1:17:19] which is the body of Christ and we've
[1:17:20] been made partakers of every gift and
[1:17:22] good thing that he's got amen we're the
[1:17:25] word that has been dispensed into this
[1:17:28] age to witness the fullness of time you
[1:17:33] are the first generation since Adam to
[1:17:35] witness that eternity and even now time
[1:17:39] is blending into eternity
[1:17:42] amen we're in a bride age and we're
[1:17:45] still in a body type called time but
[1:17:46] we're just on the threshold to be oh my
[1:17:51] what could this world offer to match
[1:17:55] that glory to be that eternal people to
[1:17:58] step across that threshold and say death
[1:18:01] where is your sting hallelujah oh my all
[1:18:08] creation has been groaning waiting for
[1:18:09] you brother sister waiting for this word

[1:18:14] but they're waiting for a people sons
[1:18:16] and daughters of God creation groans for
[1:18:18] you brother sister every earthquake
[1:18:20] every cataclysmic event every disaster

[1:18:30] you are
[1:18:33] possession of every promise amen because
[1:18:36] say what the word says about you has
[1:18:50] Authority amen adoption is not an
[1:18:55] achievement brother sister it's a
[1:18:56] gathering God building it up what's
[1:18:59] happening is the word is gathering
[1:19:00] itself together ain't meant way back in
[1:19:03] the beginning Amen God stepped out from
[1:19:05] time into eternity and stepped out into
[1:19:07] the form of glorified body and amen oh I
[1:19:10] stepped out in that fee of onic form and
[1:19:13] he began to break himself up and and he
[1:19:15] splits out fear amen that it would come
[1:19:28] forth and it would it would reveal the
[1:19:30] Word of God in a way that we couldn't
[1:19:32] experience it and understand it
[1:19:34] amen but now it's gathering itself back
[1:19:37] together dark illusions because all the
[1:19:42] light of God is coming together it's
[1:19:45] coming together so the God's bride can
[1:19:47] shine Amen as the body of Christ amen
[1:19:55] see he was the Alpha but the bride is
[1:19:58] the Omega but in his bride

[1:20:53] Christian Noah brother sister you were
[1:20:56] the seed that was planted you your life

[1:21:03] that brother sister see that eternal
[1:21:05] quality see that eternal city
[1:21:10] [Music]
[1:21:17] coming more into the image of the
[1:21:19] original seed a man he's reaping the
[1:21:23] fruit of his own life and his bride he's
[1:21:26] the Alpha she's the Omega s that same
[1:21:29] eternal life in a different form hey man
[1:21:33] a different mask
[1:21:34] it's an morph a a man whoa a man to
[1:21:39] think how at the beginning of time that
[1:21:41] logos came forth and to express the
[1:21:43] mystery of God's mind and by the end of
[1:21:46] the dispensation of time the logos has
[1:21:48] expressed itself on or earth in the form
[1:21:51] of that spoken word bride oh and now we
[1:21:55] see what God had in mind you know you
[1:21:59] can choose your friends but you can't
[1:22:01] choose your family you can't deny it you
[1:22:05] can't argue with it God is build himself
[1:22:07] a family and it's perfect approval the
[1:22:19] Bible says we are accepted in that
[1:22:21] beloved we are accepted enough you might
[1:22:24] be rejected in this world but in that
[1:22:25] beloved body of Christ you're accepted
[1:22:28] [Applause]
[1:22:32] under condemnation you're passed from
[1:22:34] death unto life Oh hallelujah there's an
[1:22:38] eternal quality in that eternal realm
[1:22:41] amen
[1:22:42] to him that overcometh will I grant to
[1:22:44] sit with me and my throne and I'll say
[1:22:47] Oh even as I overcame and I'm sat down
[1:22:49] with my father in Solem brother Bram
[1:22:50] said set with me in my throne not on my
[1:22:53] throne in my throne in other words not
[1:22:56] just some chair up in space but it's his
[1:22:58] domain he's caught us truth he said he's
[1:23:01] called us to rule him in his domain
[1:23:03] and he said now his domain amen it
[1:23:06] reaches just as far as the boundaries
[1:23:09] amen and this one is from eternity to
[1:23:12] eternity think of it we've been
[1:23:17] predestinated to join them in that
[1:23:18] eternity when we get through this
[1:23:21] testing place brother sister we're going
[1:23:23] to an eternal place that's beyond our
[1:23:25] power to comprehend Bob Paul said that
[1:23:28] the struggles are the the sufferings of
[1:23:31] this life are not worthy to be compared
[1:23:33] to the glory that's waiting for us hey
[1:23:36] man the trouble is is your finite minds
[1:23:39] amen they're trying to grasp an infinite
[1:23:42] God see this is not reality it's not
[1:23:46] reality there's a future home that's
[1:23:50] waiting for us a place that's more real
[1:23:53] than this the trouble is our mind say
[1:23:55] man oh you know there is a great man
[1:23:57] named Plato and he was a great
[1:23:58] intellectual father a Greek and in that
[1:24:01] time men had become so intelligent and
[1:24:04] and so learned and they were beginning
[1:24:06] to discover things about mathematics in
[1:24:08] the order of the universe and how
[1:24:09] perfect at its foundation this world is
[1:24:11] amen but you know you began to look
[1:24:13] around as a man Plato and look at the
[1:24:15] suffering look at the sickness look at
[1:24:18] the wars and the failures and weaknesses
[1:24:21] and heal okay he said this can't be
[1:24:23] right he said that there must be we must
[1:24:25] be living in some lower plane and there
[1:24:28] must be a place
[1:24:30] there must be a perfect place an ideal
[1:24:33] place amen
[1:24:35] uh beyond all this imperfection amen
[1:24:38] because we see that the universe has
[1:24:40] such an order has such a purpose even
[1:24:43] the intellectual man today knows that
[1:24:46] things aren't right man knows that he's
[1:24:50] fallen from some what drives a human
[1:24:52] being what drives a man to work and
[1:24:55] sweat and toil and try to carve out a
[1:24:57] legacy and and build and conquer what
[1:25:01] drives a man to do it he knows that he's
[1:25:03] supposed to rule he knows these father's
[1:25:06] from somewhere no he knows he's
[1:25:13] dispossessed hallelujah Amen that's and
[1:25:17] so he's grasping for some kind of
[1:25:19] immortality what would make a man want
[1:25:22] to be President I mean seriously you
[1:25:26] look at look at the pictures now when
[1:25:28] they start and they come out why would
[1:25:33] somebody want to go through that why
[1:25:35] would someone else talking about why
[1:25:36] would somebody want to do that you know
[1:25:37] why because that's the closest thing to
[1:25:40] immortality they will ever have 2,000
[1:25:45] years ago a man named Augustus Caesar
[1:25:47] rule over a third of this planet and it
[1:25:49] was under his direct rule amen and this
[1:25:53] morning you got up and you didn't think
[1:25:54] about him sat there on you ate your
[1:25:57] cereal and that great Caesar never
[1:26:00] crossed your mind
[1:26:04] no no never cross your mind this morning
[1:26:07] and in another thousand years nobody
[1:26:09] will ever remember he ever existed amen
[1:26:13] it's sobering when you begin to think
[1:26:15] about it the world has a saying that you
[1:26:17] die twice the first time is when your
[1:26:20] body goes in the grave and the second
[1:26:22] time is when the last person speaks your
[1:26:25] name here we have no continuing City but
[1:26:31] we're pilgrims and strangers seeking a
[1:26:33] city to come there's nothing here worth
[1:26:36] working for worth fighting for
[1:26:39] there's nothing there worth living for
[1:26:41] down in this realm but there's an
[1:26:43] eternal quality that causes us to look
[1:26:45] to another Oh My we're desiring it amen
[1:26:52] but but the thing is it just we just
[1:26:54] can't comprehend where we've fallen from
[1:26:56] but something is something is is pulling
[1:26:58] us in that direction
[1:26:59] but we can't understand that you see
[1:27:01] could I give you a better object lesson
[1:27:03] this morning yeah I just want you your
[1:27:04] mind now I want you to draw a line okay
[1:27:07] and just a line a horizontal line and
[1:27:10] it's going that way and it hits the wall
[1:27:11] and there
[1:27:12] and it goes through the wall and it just
[1:27:13] keeps going and going infinitely into
[1:27:16] eternity and it never ends and the same
[1:27:18] thing on this side it goes on and on and
[1:27:20] on and it never ends it just goes
[1:27:21] infinitely into eternity a line it
[1:27:24] doesn't have ends a line segment has
[1:27:26] ends but a line has no way that's a
[1:27:29] dimension it's a dimension we'll give it
[1:27:32] a name we'll call it X
[1:27:34] a man I blew my cover now you didn't
[1:27:38] think you're getting a math lesson this
[1:27:39] morning all right hang with me now
[1:27:41] you'll be all right
[1:27:42] a man that's the dimension and it goes
[1:27:43] on you know and I can go anywhere in
[1:27:45] this dimension I can measure from here
[1:27:46] to here I can I can measure from this
[1:27:48] point to this point I could take a
[1:27:50] dimension there but I can never measure
[1:27:52] the whole of it because it never has an
[1:27:54] end it's infinite it goes on for
[1:27:55] eternity what how how wonderful
[1:27:58] amen it it just stretches our mind even
[1:28:02] think of it these finite minds to think
[1:28:04] of that infinite line amen it goes on
[1:28:07] and on but now I want to add a second
[1:28:09] dimension a vertical dimension K becomes
[1:28:13] through this horizontal dimension and
[1:28:15] now that I've added a vertical dimension
[1:28:17] I could go anywhere on this infinite now
[1:28:32] see for every for all of this infinity
[1:28:35] there's a whole nother infinity and it
[1:28:38] just boggles the mind how much
[1:28:40] infinitely greater that second dimension
[1:28:42] is from from that first dimension and
[1:28:45] yet we can understand it now you see it
[1:28:48] goes on like a big sheet of paper but it
[1:28:50] has no edge it just goes on and on and
[1:28:52] on can you see it now you can you can
[1:28:55] kind of understand that because you're a

[1:28:59] some way of grasping those two
[1:29:01] dimensions but you know brother Brad
[1:29:05] said one time that God dwells in the
[1:29:07] seventh dimension
[1:29:09] [Music]

[1:29:19] is God than you and I often that

[1:31:01] reveal myself to him hey man and if I
[1:31:04] could just pull them out of that
[1:31:05] dimension he's walking the aisles but he
[1:32:48] projected himself into our dimension
[1:32:51] [Applause]
[1:32:55] himself and he made himself touchable to
[1:32:59] his children how wonderful in one day
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:03] the walls of this time of these three
[1:33:05] dimensions will break open and we'll

[1:33:09] and we shall know even as we are known
[1:33:12] we shall no brother sister we shall see
[1:33:15] him face to face you can't comprehend
[1:33:19] something in a higher dimension unless

[1:35:51] just a byway it's a little resting place
[1:35:53] we're just ambassadors coming through
[1:35:55] this misery think of that place
[1:36:04] amen and being an American being in Ohio
[1:36:08] in it don't even touch it that sense of
[1:36:11] belonging that sense of identity just

[1:36:15] Jerusalem which is above the mother of
[1:36:18] the free the mother of us all that's my
[1:36:20] city
[1:36:24] Oh Lord God amen you know I have some
[1:36:28] relatives that live in Israel another

[1:36:31] in Israel some of you know them probably
[1:36:33] from years back and they live over there
[1:36:35] and they've lived over there for a long
[1:36:36] time and they got under that

[1:37:06] amen the blood of Jesus Christ his
[1:37:09] children his teeth how much more we

[1:37:14] identity to know that we came from that
[1:37:17] place and we're going back Oh glory to
[1:37:20] God back into that eternity we got to
[1:37:23] get into that mindset here we don't
[1:37:25] belong down here nothing down here is
[1:37:27] permanent nothing down here is worth
[1:37:29] amen giving it our all for amen but that
[1:37:32] in Jerusalem which is above that

[1:38:02] now
[1:38:03] eternity is long enough to forget about
[1:38:05] it all those cares of life eternity is
[1:38:11] long enough to forget about you might
[1:38:12] have that question gnawing at your heart
[1:38:14] you're caught between two opinions just
[1:38:16] can't get settled eternity is long
[1:38:18] enough to find the answer now the louia
[1:38:22] eternity is long enough where if we
[1:38:24] could get in that eternal mindset we
[1:38:25] wouldn't have all these squabbles and
[1:38:27] fighting and we wouldn't have church
[1:38:28] splits and we wouldn't have brothers
[1:38:30] talking against brothers because we
[1:38:32] would understand that eternity is long
[1:38:33] enough to get over whatever little petty
[1:38:35] thing a man is has given us ought
[1:38:37] against our brother if we could break
[1:38:39] into that eternal mindset you'd look at
[1:38:41] these people around you you want to look
[1:38:42] at their flesh anymore you looking at
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:52] Greece me how people are so free to talk
[1:38:55] about one another talk bad about one
[1:38:57] another don't you know that that this
[1:38:59] assembly is the very blood of Jesus
[1:39:02] Christ

[1:39:08] but it's mercy so great that Oh
[1:39:11] hallelujah
[1:39:12] many times we ought to be destroyed for
[1:39:14] the way we treat one another thank God
[1:39:16] for His grace but if you could look
[1:39:19] beyond this temporary these temporary
[1:39:21] bottoms the bodies and brother have said
[1:39:24] you could get into such a place you said
[1:39:26] you'd get in that place he said you know
[1:39:27] your brother he's done something he said
[1:39:30] I'll have to paraphrase the quote now
[1:39:31] you brother might do something against
[1:39:33] he said he's done you wrong he's you've
[1:39:42] got the there's no question your
[1:39:44] brother's done you wrong he said don't

[1:39:49] eternity is long enough to get over it
[1:39:51] amen don't mention it he said don't
[1:39:54] landship I said what you do is you go to
[1:39:56] pray for that brother you again before

[1:40:00] said don't do it in such a way well I'm
[1:40:02] supposed to do this I was afraid no
[1:40:04] instead he said get into the presence of
[1:40:06] God and if you would just get into that
[1:40:17] eternal realm that eternal mind said he
[1:40:19] said then you would look at your brother
[1:40:21] and you begin to see how Satan's been
[1:40:23] working on him how how he's had this in
[1:40:25] his life to make him this away and

[1:41:00] grandfather's grandfather was escorted
[1:41:03] by angels so that he wouldn't come to a
[1:41:05] sudden end so that the seed line could
[1:41:08] not be broken his foreknowledge he knows
