[41:47] was standing out there and it was
[41:48] pouring the rain boy it felt good not to
[41:50] have rain coming down on my head

[42:14] Lord and we just want to say thank you
[42:17] to the musicians and we just want to
[42:20] approach the word tonight and as we
[42:24] prepare to approach the word tonight I
[42:26] know there's many different needs that
[42:28] we would have Upon Our Hearts and God's
[42:31] mindful of every need
[42:33] you know sometimes you might look at it
[42:35] and think that the text or what's being
[42:37] read that Lord I don't know how that's
[42:39] going to meet my need but just be
[42:41] mindful of this that you're the one who
[42:43] controls the gift
[42:45] it's not me it's God who controls you
[42:49] control it you pull God right down your
[42:52] direction and I believe we've got needs
[42:54] tonight and that's what we have a desire
[42:57] Amen to hear from god so let's just
[42:59] let's just look to him in a word of
[43:01] prayer before we read the word
[43:03] Heavenly Father
[43:05] how precious Lord and wonderful it is oh
[43:09] God for Brethren to dwell together in
[43:12] unity Lord as you would be describing it
[43:15] Lord of that precious ointment Lord that
[43:17] was poured out upon Aaron Lord and he
[43:20] would run down lord to the very Lord
[43:24] edges of His Garment o God clear to the
[43:28] feet clear to the ground Lord father we
[43:31] just Lord our so thankful God for your
[43:34] mercy Lord and how that you have
[43:37] directed Our Lives Lord guiding us Lord

[43:43] father we just ask that you'll just take
[43:45] control in the further part of the
[43:47] service tonight Lord It's a desire that
[43:50] Lord we would have and that's to see you
[43:52] and just to be closer to you Lord we
[43:56] just Lord commit ourselves to you Lord
[43:58] knowing that we're insufficient Lord for
[44:01] the task we're insufficient Lord but
[44:04] father you to our Lord our worthiness
[44:07] Lord and we ask that you would come Lord
[44:10] and just anoint us together as speaker
[44:12] in here and may you have your way here
[44:15] tonight Lord May every single need Lord
[44:18] be met every heart be settled Lord oh
[44:22] God every life Lord just being changed
[44:24] in lives being further changed Lord we
[44:27] just Lord look to you now and just all
[44:30] that you would sweep Among Us Lord that
[44:32] same quickening power Lord in the name
[44:35] of Jesus Christ amen
[44:38] amen let's look here one verse of
[44:40] scripture
[44:41] tonight and I want to read out of job
[44:45] 29.
[44:47] in verse 14.
[44:52] and in this chapter here job is
[44:55] referring to
[44:57] it's a testimony job's reflecting back
[45:00] on his
[45:01] walk and life previous to that of
[45:06] the test and the trial that he is in and
[45:10] there's a reflection of what job is
[45:12] reflecting on and he has a testimony how
[45:16] many of you know job had a testimony
[45:18] and he had a job had a clear conscience
[45:21] before God job was standing there and he
[45:23] knew there's nothing that God has asked
[45:25] me to do that I haven't done
[45:27] so he could have a clear conscience but
[45:30] he still didn't know what was taking
[45:32] place but I'm grateful that God allowed
[45:36] and gave all of this for you and I
[45:38] because sometimes you and I also hold
[45:40] that we don't understand sometimes
[45:42] exactly we don't know what's taking
[45:44] place sometimes and no matter you know
[45:46] we we hear how many times we hear we
[45:49] hear trials preached on we hear tests
[45:50] preach on and we're amen that's right
[45:52] and then all of a sudden here we find
[45:54] ourselves right in the trial or testing
[45:56] what's happening
[45:58] and it's a lot of times it's not just
[46:00] what's happening but we we almost have a
[46:03] oh no
[46:04] oh no I just was enjoying you know the
[46:07] little reprieve at the resort of no
[46:09] testings you know and now here we are
[46:11] back back in it but you know we we
[46:14] understand I believe that God brings us
[46:16] as Believers to realize that there is
[46:18] there's nothing that happens by chance
[46:21] and even with things what we would look
[46:23] at as little bumps in the road or this
[46:25] or that God God has permitted all those
[46:29] things and if within it all we can just
[46:31] look to him and say God whatever it is
[46:34] that you're Desiring to bring out of my
[46:36] life Lord let me just submit to you that
[46:41] it can come forth amen job 29 verse 14
[46:45] I put on
[46:47] righteousness so job if he's put on the
[46:51] word
[46:52] and it clothed me I like that and it
[46:55] clothed me it fit me perfectly I mean
[46:59] just the word of the Lord how it it just
[47:01] fit me like a glove it just fit
[47:02] perfectly
[47:04] my judgment was as a robe and a diadem
[47:09] may God bless you bless the reading of
[47:11] the word as you're being seated
[47:16] I think about
[47:17] try walk from the platform here last
[47:20] Thursday is just begin to drop and begin
[47:23] to put many of these some of the first
[47:25] Parts here down to it
[47:28] but I would think about where we're
[47:30] living in a time right now
[47:32] in the Fulfillment of scripture
[47:35] and we can see that even in Matthew 17
[47:37] when the Lord Jesus
[47:39] has taken the witnesses there up to
[47:42] mount Transfiguration
[47:45] and he is transfigured before them and
[47:47] there appears Moses and Elijah
[47:51] and we recognize there's many things
[47:53] that the prophet would take under the
[47:56] inspiration of the Holy Spirit to show
[47:58] us that that was not just a historical
[48:01] event but that was prophetic it was God
[48:03] giving a direction of the order that was
[48:06] going to come in the New Kingdom
[48:09] it was also God letting be known with
[48:11] here Moses and Elijah that there would
[48:15] be a last day Ministry with the spirit
[48:18] of Elijah upon it this this word itself
[48:21] would all together it would tie up the
[48:24] very Mysteries of the scripture that
[48:27] have laid here and just been scattered
[48:29] throughout the time and many have probed
[48:31] down but it would be necessary in this
[48:33] hour because through that word coming
[48:35] together and then being received into a
[48:40] people that are ordained in this hour to
[48:43] receive the word of God and that is
[48:46] where God has placed Us in the sea that
[48:48] through that word working in our life
[48:51] you know the working of the holy spirit
[48:53] in our life it speaks then we'll come to
[48:56] this place that the working of the
[48:57] Dynamics in our lives the Bride of Jesus
[49:00] Christ will literally draw them from the
[49:04] grave it's going to bring on the Rapture
[49:07] and so we find here when Moses and
[49:10] Elijah those that's went on and then
[49:12] those that's also will be caught up so
[49:14] here we are standing in this moment and
[49:16] a garment here in time of adoption and
[49:19] this is where God has brought us to in
[49:22] this hour as the Church of the Living
[49:24] God and I think of it when we look at
[49:27] that of the adoption and we think of the
[49:29] Garment and I want to just think of it
[49:31] in terms of even when the prodigal son
[49:33] had come home here he was he was greeted
[49:37] by his father his father saw him coming
[49:40] and went to greet him and he he kissed
[49:43] him he welcomed him and then he had he
[49:47] had them of the servants to go get the
[49:49] best robe that was in the house and and
[49:52] clothe him with the best robe now the
[49:54] best robe was the father's robe himself
[49:56] and to realize that all of that was a
[49:59] story of redemption that it would be of
[50:02] the same Holy Spirit the same life of
[50:04] God that would be be come upon us as
[50:07] prodigals of God those of us the lives
[50:10] that were away from God lives that he
[50:13] came to redeem he paid the price not
[50:15] maybe knowing that you were a son and
[50:17] daughter of God but he knew you he never
[50:20] lost sight of you he never knew in what
[50:22] bed of time you would be planning it let
[50:23] me just say this God even knew all the
[50:26] decisions and all the mistakes and
[50:28] everything else God knew all of the
[50:30] husks that we'd have to pick out of our
[50:32] teeth and the pig pen all the mud we'd
[50:34] have to wipe out God knew about all that
[50:36] but that didn't intimidate God because
[50:39] the power of redemption is to claim what
[50:42] was always his
[50:45] and God God is the one who performs the
[50:49] work of redemption not only the ACT
[50:51] where the price is paid and the bias but
[50:54] also to bring that cleansing and that
[50:57] that that change to where we are never
[51:00] will never be slaves any longer so that
[51:03] garment that's put upon us is that
[51:05] garment there of of like that of of the
[51:09] father's own garment his own garment we
[51:11] also hear in the scripture where it
[51:13] speaks of the wedding garment remember
[51:15] there were guests that were invited to a
[51:18] uh a wedding and they were invited and
[51:21] when they there was one who was there
[51:23] and the uh the one the bridegroom they
[51:26] they looked upon him and said hey friend
[51:28] what are you doing here friend that
[51:30] showed he was a church member uh they
[51:33] was acquainted with him but he did not
[51:34] have on the right garment and so this
[51:38] garment this wedding garment is none
[51:40] other than God's own life it's none
[51:44] other because you see what the token the
[51:46] Holy Spirit the reason as we are
[51:48] speaking of the coming of the holy
[51:50] spirit is because it's one thing for the
[51:53] sacrifice to have been offered up there
[51:56] at Calvary and it was and he rose on the
[51:59] third day and he ascended on high but he
[52:02] sent back the life his own life upon the
[52:06] church so that we're not just looking
[52:09] back at an event we are identified
[52:13] without of redemption by his own life
[52:17] coming and claiming and regenerating you
[52:21] and I as Sons and Daughters of God so we
[52:24] are identified by our Sacrifice by being
[52:28] in our sacrifice
[52:30] so when we think of this garment I'm
[52:32] getting somewhere as we look at this
[52:34] garment we also are aware that in
[52:37] Revelations 19 that this garment itself
[52:40] is that garment which is given or
[52:43] granted to that of the Bride of Jesus
[52:46] Christ in an hour that you and I are
[52:48] living in Revelations 19 speaks of no
[52:51] other hour but the hour that you and I
[52:54] are living in let us be glad and rejoice
[52:56] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[52:59] and his wife the bride she hath made
[53:03] herself ready and to her was granted not
[53:06] that she earned it not that she married
[53:09] it it was granted you see it's Grace
[53:11] that even comes and deals with our life
[53:14] Grace isn't overlooking our sins but
[53:17] Grace is dealing with our life and
[53:19] letting you know there's no sin no
[53:21] problem no situation too great or too
[53:24] big that the blood has not already taken
[53:27] care of
[53:29] that's a word of authority that God has
[53:32] sinned in this hour that's why it's not
[53:34] just reading a scripture it's the
[53:36] anointing and authority of the Lion of
[53:39] God that's roaring out that lets you and
[53:41] I know there is nothing too great that
[53:44] the blood hasn't already taken care of
[53:48] so it's the fine linen fine linen which
[53:52] is the righteousness of the saint that
[53:55] garment so I want to speak on that
[53:57] Garment of our sonship that Garment of
[54:02] our sonship job said I put on
[54:05] righteousness and it clothed me my
[54:08] judgment was as a robe and a diagram so
[54:12] notice it and I put it on and it clothed
[54:14] me but even in my in my judgment even in
[54:18] my judgment my discernment the way that
[54:21] I was approaching things was as a robe
[54:24] and a dad himself it was something that
[54:26] could actually be displayed or was
[54:29] displayed through his life and I believe
[54:31] that Garment of our sonship because as
[54:34] we look around the room tonight we we
[54:36] have you know in our in our dress and
[54:39] everything else but there is a garment
[54:41] that's greater and has a greater a
[54:44] greater price to it than Any Garment
[54:47] suit coat whatever it might be and that
[54:49] is the Garment of the Holy Spirit as a
[54:52] matter of fact you can't even put a
[54:54] price tag on it
[54:55] it's without money it's without price
[54:58] it's worth more as a matter of fact Paul
[55:01] would write of it this way and call it
[55:02] the unsearchable riches of God you can't
[55:07] put a price tag on it it's unsearchable
[55:11] that's how great the Holy Ghost is
[55:13] that's how great this Garment of our
[55:16] sonship is a garment that reveals Sons
[55:19] and Daughters of God and so in Galatians
[55:22] 3 27 for as many of you as have been
[55:27] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[55:31] now this baptized was not speaking about
[55:34] in water though we believe in that that
[55:38] comes along with repentance but this
[55:40] baptism is speaking of the Holy Spirit
[55:44] baptizing you and I into the body of
[55:47] Jesus Christ and I know you've heard
[55:49] this example a lot but it's the very
[55:51] word that's used here where you take
[55:53] cucumbers and they pass through the
[55:55] process to become pickles you can never
[55:58] now take a pickle and make it a cucumber
[56:01] it has been transformed and changed for
[56:05] eternally
[56:08] I mean a Pickle's not Eternal but you
[56:10] get what I'm saying
[56:11] right
[56:14] hope it ain't sweet pickles Seether I
[56:16] don't like them things I like deal
[56:18] but at any rate it's a pickles and and
[56:21] recognize that in our life times when
[56:23] that transformation has come that's what
[56:25] this is speaking of as you have been
[56:28] baptized into Christ have put on Christ
[56:33] so there is a garment in our life and
[56:36] this Garment of our sonship is the
[56:39] quickening power of God that has brought
[56:41] forth a new creation that is God's
[56:46] creative work it's not a man's work
[56:48] that's why the preaching of the word is
[56:51] so important and not just preaching but
[56:54] it's preaching under the inspiration by
[56:57] the ministering spirits that are sent
[56:59] forth to minister the spirit of the word
[57:02] to them who are The Heirs of salvation
[57:05] God has sent a word in this hour it's a
[57:09] word that's anointed it's full of Power
[57:11] full of glory and it's for you and I
[57:14] everything that we have need of God has
[57:17] come to bring it forth and to manifest
[57:19] it to reveal it and to bring it out of
[57:21] our lives
[57:23] so here we have been anointed and we
[57:26] have that same garment remember Elijah
[57:28] went on and when Elijah was going on
[57:31] Elisha asked for a double portion and
[57:34] Elijah Elijah threw the Garment back and
[57:37] it was with the same garment that Elisha
[57:40] smote the waters and said let the god of
[57:44] Elijah he called for the god of Elijah
[57:47] to come down why he had the mantle he
[57:51] had the Garment and it fit Elisha
[57:54] perfectly
[57:56] and it fit him perfectly because he was
[57:59] willing to let the word cut him down
[58:02] because God ain't going to tailor the
[58:04] Garment
[58:05] this Garment of sonship God ain't gonna
[58:08] tailor it it ain't oh I better not gain
[58:10] weight they have to let this out three
[58:12] inches and take it in three when I when
[58:14] I worked with suits there was things
[58:15] that you had to know I could look at a
[58:17] situation and say nope and we're not
[58:18] going to be able to do that with that
[58:19] suit coat and that will not look right
[58:21] or with them pants there is a rule that
[58:24] we operate by and so we know this
[58:26] garment we're talking about the Holy
[58:27] Ghost it ain't the Holy Ghost then all
[58:30] of a sudden God is tailoring the Holy
[58:31] Ghost to fit us no it is us that is
[58:34] tailored that is shaped that is brought
[58:37] forth and you know what it really is
[58:38] it's us getting rid of us it's a holy
[58:42] spirit helping us to get rid of the
[58:44] things that really don't matter
[58:48] it's the same way when the Lord Jesus he
[58:51] sent back the same Garment of the Holy
[58:53] Spirit upon the Church of the Living God
[58:56] now I'm gonna I'm gonna take this Avenue
[58:58] with her tonight as we look at this
[59:01] garment and I want to to look at it in
[59:04] this manner as we're talking about
[59:06] putting on this garment because when we
[59:08] are talking about as the Church of the
[59:11] Living God and thinking about that of a
[59:13] useful life and and being a channel that
[59:15] God can operate through we know that
[59:17] it's Satan's objective in all things he
[59:20] cannot stop the word of God from coming
[59:22] to pass but he is interested in trying
[59:25] to do all that he can to try to stop up
[59:28] and try to hinder the channels in our
[59:31] life let me say this to you if you have
[59:33] ever you've been born again by the
[59:35] spirit of God you can never ever ever be
[59:39] unborn again
[59:40] I know that's simple it didn't say
[59:42] sometimes your feelings may not get away
[59:44] but that's where you've got to realize
[59:46] at different times even when I don't
[59:48] feel like this and this and this my
[59:51] feelings have nothing to do with God's
[59:54] promise
[59:56] are you hearing me now I'm going to just
[59:58] kind of deal with that just a little bit
[1:00:00] here tonight and looking at how the Holy
[1:00:02] Spirit just pressing this on because
[1:00:04] Satan this is why thank god brother
[1:00:06] Branham I I Ponder these things as a
[1:00:08] pastor and I look at how brother Brandon
[1:00:10] would take in Christ the mystery and
[1:00:12] what which is actually a seven seal
[1:00:14] message and brother random one unfold
[1:00:16] that in that time and he would take 45
[1:00:18] minutes to an hour and deal with even
[1:00:21] how that we operate as a church body he
[1:00:24] would help us on my glorious message and
[1:00:26] I know we might look to say well I'll
[1:00:28] just skip over to that and wait till he
[1:00:30] reads his text but you realize the
[1:00:32] things that he deals with in the first
[1:00:33] part of that message if you skip over it
[1:00:36] then the rest will never operate the way
[1:00:38] it should
[1:00:40] is that right that's why brother random
[1:00:43] would take even through uh when even in
[1:00:45] that month of 63 he would he would spend
[1:00:48] extensive time and dealing with how but
[1:00:51] the church the local body of how they
[1:00:53] ought to operate and you'll find it over
[1:00:55] the course of years and there were times
[1:00:58] where the church would come into right
[1:00:59] there Branham Tabernacle come into a
[1:01:01] Consecration and brother random at that
[1:01:03] time would also give him a warning at
[1:01:05] that moment your sweet your consecration
[1:01:07] is solid right now but he says You must
[1:01:10] continue to keep consecrating yourself
[1:01:12] to God because Satan is going to come
[1:01:15] around he's going to try to make
[1:01:16] somebody they'll do something wrong
[1:01:18] contrary to what you think and he said
[1:01:20] but no don't go talking to nobody else
[1:01:22] about it you just take that person
[1:01:24] before God in prayer and he said because
[1:01:26] if somebody comes to you to tell you
[1:01:29] something about another member if you
[1:01:32] listen to it this is a direct quote out
[1:01:33] of super sense if you listen to it you
[1:01:36] Mar your experience you might say I
[1:01:40] didn't do it but you might not have been
[1:01:41] the one telling it but if you give your
[1:01:43] ears to it you Mar your own experience
[1:01:45] what do you do turn that off I'm not
[1:01:48] interested in that right here turn
[1:01:50] everything back around
[1:01:53] brother Samuel what are you saying I'm
[1:01:55] saying this right here I don't eat out
[1:01:57] of trash cans matter of fact I'm not
[1:01:59] real big on leftovers I like them better
[1:02:01] now than I probably ever did but I sure
[1:02:04] don't go to a trash can I don't ever
[1:02:07] want to go to a trash can I don't even
[1:02:09] think about it on Sundays as much as I
[1:02:11] like certain restaurants I don't want to
[1:02:13] go to their dumpster and find out what
[1:02:15] was thrown out what are you saying
[1:02:17] brother Samuel you're not a trash can so
[1:02:20] you don't need to be taken in other
[1:02:22] people's trash you say well that might
[1:02:24] be they might be speaking truth but it's
[1:02:27] their feelings within it and there's
[1:02:29] some truth that just does not need to be
[1:02:33] repeated
[1:02:34] preach on brother Samuel think a will
[1:02:37] I'm talking about a garment of our
[1:02:39] sonship
[1:02:42] my mama now here we talk about brother
[1:02:46] Randomness you know he's asked a
[1:02:48] question
[1:02:48] to please explain the mystery of the
[1:02:52] translation of the Bride because this
[1:02:53] gets down to Everyday living he's asked
[1:02:55] the question and brother Branham is
[1:02:57] talking about of how that before Abraham
[1:03:00] and Sarah could ever receive the
[1:03:03] promised son God had to change their
[1:03:06] bodies back young again yeah now that's
[1:03:08] not wrote in the scripture but yet it is
[1:03:11] wrote in there
[1:03:12] is that right because I I'm sorry I just
[1:03:15] can't believe and I don't mean defend
[1:03:17] nobody I don't want to offend nobody but
[1:03:18] I just can't believe that you know that
[1:03:20] that the Pharaoh was down there
[1:03:21] whistling after you know somebody who
[1:03:24] was on a cane I don't believe that I'm
[1:03:25] sorry God changed her back and I mean
[1:03:28] you know in Abraham's eyes she was
[1:03:31] always a knockout but I mean when God
[1:03:33] changed her back God's got a purpose in
[1:03:35] changing her back and that was for the
[1:03:38] purpose to bring forth the promised son
[1:03:42] and brother Banner would make this
[1:03:43] statement he said and so must these
[1:03:46] bodies be changed before we can receive
[1:03:50] the promised son that's why the Rapture
[1:03:53] it takes place and here we are in a
[1:03:56] period of time and here you know when
[1:03:58] the Rapture takes place and you're the
[1:04:00] dead in Christ shall rise and here we
[1:04:02] are changed there is a time here that we
[1:04:05] are gathered together and you know what
[1:04:07] we don't see him right away brother
[1:04:09] Branham puts it out so clear I love it
[1:04:11] he said because he wants all attention
[1:04:13] to be on him when he descends and he
[1:04:16] says we knows we would be looking around
[1:04:18] to see who missed it he said we're gonna
[1:04:21] you know how it is if you tell people on
[1:04:23] Sunday morning go around and shake hands
[1:04:25] with somebody else by the time some
[1:04:26] people sit down we're ready to pray the
[1:04:28] prayer benediction and go home
[1:04:31] yeah I said that to be kind of funny
[1:04:33] some of you catch it tomorrow but but at
[1:04:34] any rate
[1:04:36] saying
[1:04:42] come we're going to be getting
[1:04:43] acquainted with all the Overcomers and
[1:04:46] how we've been there but then when all
[1:04:48] those acquaintance you say how will he
[1:04:50] know I don't know but he's God he's got
[1:04:52] it all put together and he'll know at
[1:04:55] that time and then we shall rise to be
[1:04:58] with him and go to the marriage supper
[1:05:00] of the lamb but here there's got to be a
[1:05:03] change of the body before we can ever
[1:05:05] receive him because this body is sin now
[1:05:08] I want to go in and begin to continue to
[1:05:10] quote out of that and out of that part
[1:05:12] it questions the natural 64. and brother
[1:05:14] I'm talking about this body being sin
[1:05:16] and why it's got to be changed he said
[1:05:18] this first conscience controls this body
[1:05:21] with see taste filled smell and hear and
[1:05:25] it's just got us all scrupled up
[1:05:29] we reason and everything else and the
[1:05:33] church said
[1:05:36] woo
[1:05:39] I think it's a good way of putting he
[1:05:40] gives us all scrupled up
[1:05:43] we reason and everything else what is it
[1:05:45] that first conscience but that new body
[1:05:48] that that comes from this born again not
[1:05:53] the first conscience it'll pass away
[1:05:54] it's that inside something that lives
[1:05:58] everybody understand it say Amen
[1:06:02] so where does that new body come from it
[1:06:05] comes here it's coming from within where
[1:06:08] that Born Again experience it's coming
[1:06:11] you see because what remember when you
[1:06:13] and I when they return in the Rapture
[1:06:16] here will be them who have entered into
[1:06:18] the theophany will come back down and
[1:06:20] pick up a glorified body we will take
[1:06:23] our glorified bodies and meet our
[1:06:25] theophany because remember we were never
[1:06:28] ordained to be angels we were ordained
[1:06:31] to live in a three-room house and that
[1:06:34] soul that God has brought and changed in
[1:06:37] our life it will merge with that
[1:06:39] theophany that theophany with the
[1:06:41] glorified bodies that's why as they said
[1:06:43] over there when the prophet went beyond
[1:06:45] the curtain of time said here we don't
[1:06:47] eat drink or sleep
[1:06:50] right and that's why brother Brandon
[1:06:52] bringing it right down to the Future
[1:06:53] home Millennium and future home he would
[1:06:56] say what is eternal life what will it be
[1:06:58] it will be eternal life in a human body
[1:07:01] but a glorified condition
[1:07:04] not a human body that's just went back
[1:07:07] to being young again and has all the
[1:07:08] same complexes or all the same
[1:07:10] weaknesses no it's a change completely
[1:07:13] just as the change of the new birth does
[1:07:17] not leave one weakness in the creation
[1:07:19] on the inside or we battle the weakness
[1:07:22] out here but there is no weakness with a
[1:07:25] child of God that has been born again
[1:07:26] from our soul
[1:07:31] notice it's not this outside sea taste
[1:07:35] feel smell and hear
[1:07:36] it's subject to death and will die but
[1:07:41] the inside part of you down in here
[1:07:43] inside that is the person that cannot
[1:07:47] die and that's the person that the New
[1:07:50] Life Starts from from this new birth and
[1:07:55] it builds another person in the image of
[1:07:58] this person you are around that life so
[1:08:01] you see has it where does our growth
[1:08:03] come from our growth is not something
[1:08:05] that's coming from out here our growth
[1:08:07] is from that life that's on the inside
[1:08:09] it is building within us it's just like
[1:08:12] that a woman that is expecting and here
[1:08:14] she is she has a child what happens over
[1:08:17] those months it goes through the growth
[1:08:19] all the stages there's times eventually
[1:08:22] she starts feeling the kicking and the
[1:08:24] punching and everything else that's
[1:08:25] going on I don't mean Brian will help
[1:08:27] him bring back no bad memories on
[1:08:28] anybody but you understand there's that
[1:08:30] much going on there's Cravings that she
[1:08:32] has at certain times there's things you
[1:08:35] know that sometimes would seem so odd
[1:08:37] but there is a life on the inside that
[1:08:40] she is Speedy it really don't have to do
[1:08:42] anything about herself because some
[1:08:44] things she might crave and actually
[1:08:46] would eat that would go against what she
[1:08:49] in herself would naturally do or what
[1:08:52] she would eat what is controlling it the
[1:08:55] life on the inside so I ask you what is
[1:08:58] it that's directing the appetite it's
[1:09:00] from that on the inside when there is a
[1:09:03] new creation on the inside this is why
[1:09:06] friends that we don't have to say don't
[1:09:08] do this and don't do that this is why
[1:09:10] the holy spirit will call out against
[1:09:12] certain things why because if you keep
[1:09:15] on walking in those certain things and
[1:09:17] you keep on entertaining that then the
[1:09:19] Holy Spirit can never come fully into
[1:09:22] your life what is God doing when he
[1:09:24] calls out things on dress and this and
[1:09:26] that oh brother Samuel they're just
[1:09:28] harping on that no what God's calling
[1:09:30] out is letting us know there's some real
[1:09:32] simple basic ABC things little things
[1:09:36] that you're allowing to stand in your
[1:09:39] way from receiving the full Garment of
[1:09:43] sonship
[1:09:46] to me this garment's more and worth more
[1:09:47] than anything
[1:09:51] and I believe we're called to display it
[1:09:53] in this hour
[1:09:55] is that right so potentially notice
[1:09:58] Brethren would say potentially it's
[1:10:00] already here and he says see it's the
[1:10:03] word promise before the foundation of
[1:10:05] the world and around there this only
[1:10:08] reflects the negative he goes right back
[1:10:09] to that that body it only reflects the
[1:10:11] negative but that which comes from in
[1:10:13] here will reflect the positive the word
[1:10:15] and the same thing is the translation of
[1:10:18] the Bride will be the same thing the
[1:10:20] word that's in you the body will
[1:10:23] materialize around that word and that's
[1:10:26] the same thing it did by Sarah
[1:10:28] so this is what is that that we take
[1:10:30] with us we take character with us
[1:10:33] that's our soul that's the real you and
[1:10:35] I
[1:10:36] as a real child of God that's the real
[1:10:39] you and I that's on the inside I say oh
[1:10:41] God if this is listen friends if we can
[1:10:44] just stop right here it would settle
[1:10:46] everything else God let this be the
[1:10:48] Forefront of my life if we could just
[1:10:50] stop right there and say anything that
[1:10:52] arises anything that comes my way I'm
[1:10:55] not going to let it stop in my mind I'm
[1:10:58] not going to sit there and try to
[1:10:59] entertain it reasoning out what are you
[1:11:01] going to do I'm going to bring it to
[1:11:03] where the Judgment seat of Christ is
[1:11:05] where is the Judgment seat of Christ
[1:11:07] it's right there in the Throne of your
[1:11:10] heart listen on the day of Pentecost The
[1:11:13] Mercy Seat moved into the heart of the
[1:11:16] believer that's where God is dwelling
[1:11:18] that's where God Fellowship he told
[1:11:21] Moses I will commune with thee from
[1:11:23] above that of the mercy see where is God
[1:11:26] communing where is God fellowshipping
[1:11:28] with his children in that of the Soul
[1:11:31] [Music]
[1:11:33] that's why all kinds of thoughts can
[1:11:34] come your way and nothing but lies but
[1:11:37] when that cell has been anchored there
[1:11:39] ain't enough Devils out of hell that can
[1:11:41] ever get that Soul away from God why
[1:11:43] it's been changed for eternity
[1:11:47] you might get down you might get
[1:11:49] discouraged but I say oh God let
[1:11:52] everything that rises let it be brought
[1:11:54] to the Garment
[1:12:00] Hallelujah I shall say help me Jesus
[1:12:06] another one very familiar
[1:12:10] how can
[1:12:11] I take a Cocker ball and make a grain of
[1:12:14] wheat out of anybody everybody know what
[1:12:15] a cooker bro is
[1:12:18] somebody just look at me and what does
[1:12:19] it look mean like deer in the headline
[1:12:21] there
[1:12:22] is that like a
[1:12:27] laughs
[1:12:30] like somebody show me a little clip
[1:12:31] today of when they greet a southerner in
[1:12:33] a store in a southern area man somebody
[1:12:35] look back and say man it sure is a hot
[1:12:37] day in it well
[1:12:39] the guy looks at him and said
[1:12:41] are they going to finish it or not no in
[1:12:42] the satinum well yeah you're right it's
[1:12:44] a very hot day
[1:12:46] I don't mean be picking on the southern
[1:12:48] but you understand there's
[1:12:50] sometimes there's there's wisdom in
[1:12:52] saying little
[1:12:53] there's a lot to be said but just say it
[1:12:56] like this a Cocker Barrel
[1:12:58] that's that they meant it is sticky and
[1:13:00] it hurts I've had them on my on my on my
[1:13:03] uh my pants when I went hunting
[1:13:05] uh and you and trying to get them up I
[1:13:07] don't even want to touch them to get
[1:13:08] them off it hurts it sticks a washing
[1:13:11] machine don't get them off
[1:13:14] it's truth it sticks
[1:13:17] and you know why it's meant that way
[1:13:18] it's meant that way so when it is
[1:13:21] sticking it can be carried to another
[1:13:23] place and germinate and that seed drop
[1:13:28] think about it when things want to
[1:13:33] it causes
[1:13:35] you I just got to tell somebody I just
[1:13:37] got to post this be careful
[1:13:39] you might be posting a kuckerberg seed
[1:13:45] Mama well
[1:13:49] how can I how can I take a Cocker barrel
[1:13:52] and make a grain of wheat out of it how
[1:13:53] can that be it's impossible for me to do
[1:13:56] it the only way okay here we go it can
[1:13:59] be is because inside that Taco Bell has
[1:14:03] been transmitted from a Cocker Barrel a
[1:14:06] cockle ball to a germ called wheat life
[1:14:09] so you open up the Cocoa Brown it's got
[1:14:11] to become an operation take out that of
[1:14:13] that germ of Life of kookaburra put in
[1:14:15] wheat life and then you can close it
[1:14:17] back up when you bury that taco Barrel
[1:14:20] one will come forth is what's on the
[1:14:22] inside of it so on the outside it's
[1:14:25] Cracker Barrel but when there has been a
[1:14:27] transmission on the inside where the old
[1:14:30] cockle Barrel Nature's been taken out
[1:14:32] and wheat life is put in you can bury it
[1:14:35] and it will come forth a wheat life
[1:14:38] in the resurrection oh he said it'll
[1:14:41] produce a grain of wheat because there's
[1:14:43] been a life of wheat put in the cocoa
[1:14:44] bro and the life of the cocoa bro has
[1:14:46] been taken out but the nature
[1:14:49] of the kookaburl is still sticky
[1:14:54] inbound like being sticky
[1:14:57] I mean I like pancakes but I don't like
[1:14:59] being sticky
[1:15:01] I like syrup I like good maple syrup but
[1:15:03] I don't like being sticky
[1:15:05] sometimes I have a problem because the
[1:15:07] stickiness gets all over my Fork what do
[1:15:10] you do get a new one and wash my hands
[1:15:12] because I don't like stickiness
[1:15:16] somehow I I would love to be able to say
[1:15:19] you know here I come into a place you
[1:15:21] come into a place I'm sure we all would
[1:15:22] would love to be able to trade in the
[1:15:25] stickiness about that first nature
[1:15:28] but don't worry you know what that is
[1:15:30] there is a desire within you
[1:15:33] you hold the poem without
[1:15:37] that because there's already been new
[1:15:39] life that's come on the inside of you
[1:15:41] there is a desire to say God I don't
[1:15:44] want to live and dwell I don't even want
[1:15:47] to be operated by this pest house
[1:15:50] but give me the grace Lord by the wheat
[1:15:54] life on the inside to bring everything
[1:15:56] subject to the word of God
[1:15:59] but the nature of the kookaburl is still
[1:16:02] sticky and it
[1:16:04] will be
[1:16:06] until
[1:16:09] we go to the next Revival
[1:16:13] boy I'd like that version
[1:16:16] we'll be having one this weekend
[1:16:18] I think we should anyhow it will be
[1:16:20] until this new life has been fully
[1:16:23] developed out of the ground and raised
[1:16:25] up again now that statement does not
[1:16:28] mean that we live defeated
[1:16:31] you're not reading it right if you look
[1:16:33] at it that we live defeated what it's
[1:16:35] doing is it's just letting you know that
[1:16:37] your enemy you pack him with you
[1:16:40] but you don't have to succumb to him bow
[1:16:43] to him but it's sticky what does that
[1:16:46] mean there's going to be things
[1:16:47] sometimes you gotta pick off of your
[1:16:50] life well I don't know what needs to be
[1:16:52] picked up the Holy Ghost does if we'll
[1:16:54] invite the word of God into our life and
[1:16:57] say Lord come through my life is there
[1:17:00] some things that's got stuck in my mind
[1:17:02] things that's got stuck in my head
[1:17:04] things that's got stuck in my actions
[1:17:07] Lord I need a washing of Water by the
[1:17:11] word Lord God why it's recognizing our
[1:17:15] need of him
[1:17:18] oh my but now while it's on earth a
[1:17:22] Cocker Barrel is still sticky but it's
[1:17:24] got the nature on the inside of it as a
[1:17:26] wheat
[1:17:27] here's some real encouraging words you
[1:17:30] ready
[1:17:31] as long as you're in this life
[1:17:34] you're going to be sticky
[1:17:36] and have a carnal nature that's going to
[1:17:38] what's that say
[1:17:41] bother you
[1:17:44] it probably bother other people too but
[1:17:46] it'll bother you
[1:17:49] it'll bother you
[1:17:51] as long as you live but be inside of you
[1:17:54] notice how it keeps on bringing us bring
[1:17:56] back to the inside of you you're born
[1:17:59] again and when you're raised up you're
[1:18:01] in the likeness of Christ and all the
[1:18:04] sin has gone from you that's the thing
[1:18:08] no wonder Paul would write here in
[1:18:10] Ephesians 6 11
[1:18:12] put on the whole armor of God
[1:18:15] that you may be able to stand against
[1:18:16] The Wiles but the devil put on means to
[1:18:19] sink into a garment
[1:18:22] into a clothing
[1:18:23] Colossians 3 8 but now ye also put off
[1:18:27] all these anger wrath malice blasphemy
[1:18:31] filthy communication out of your mouth
[1:18:33] lie not one to another seeing that ye
[1:18:36] have put off the old man with his deeds
[1:18:41] and have put on the new man notice this
[1:18:45] garment you have put off the old man
[1:18:47] talking about that old nature the spirit
[1:18:50] of God has actually come and done a work
[1:18:53] in our life to where that the old man
[1:18:55] threw him by that death that divorce and
[1:18:59] that debt that old man is put away he's
[1:19:01] dead now we have put on the new man or
[1:19:04] sunk into that of the new man which is
[1:19:07] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[1:19:09] him that created him where there is
[1:19:12] neither Greek nor Jew circumcision nor
[1:19:15] uncircumcision Barbarian cynthian Bond
[1:19:18] nor free but Christ is all and in all in
[1:19:22] other words simply put the only thing
[1:19:24] that matters is Christ
[1:19:27] Nothing Else Matters what what degree or
[1:19:30] where we're at and everything all of our
[1:19:32] all of the talent that no matter what it
[1:19:34] comes down to is when that new man that
[1:19:37] new man it's all about Christ
[1:19:40] so then it's no longer about us you see
[1:19:42] the very moment that we start living out
[1:19:45] in the about us is the very moment we
[1:19:48] are not living by the Garment of our
[1:19:51] sonship and we do when we do not live by
[1:19:54] the Garment of the sonship and listen
[1:19:56] that's where you have to have that
[1:19:57] Authority in your life to bring
[1:19:59] everything subject to the word of God if
[1:20:01] not you'll be carried about tossed about
[1:20:03] with every wind and everything that
[1:20:06] comes your way but you've got to have a
[1:20:08] place to realize your Victory is not
[1:20:11] outside but your Victory is on the
[1:20:14] inside and it's feeding that man on the
[1:20:17] inside to do what it will bring forth
[1:20:19] out of you what is already there
[1:20:23] it ain't going to come from out there
[1:20:25] it's already in the seed
[1:20:28] oh I need more Temperance it ain't going
[1:20:30] to come from out there it's already in
[1:20:32] the seed oh I need more faith it's not
[1:20:34] going to come from out there it'll come
[1:20:36] from in the sea but it will take the
[1:20:39] quickening power of God moving in our
[1:20:41] life and US yielding to that that there
[1:20:43] might be a adding to our faith virtue
[1:20:45] adding virtue adding patience adding
[1:20:48] Temperance you see all of that is packed
[1:20:51] in the seed it's like when I go on a
[1:20:53] trip and I pack everything in my bag and
[1:20:56] put in such a way because I don't like
[1:20:57] carrying a lot of clothes with men a lot
[1:20:59] of bags and everything else so I I
[1:21:01] package try to pack it in such a way
[1:21:04] that when you know you get there
[1:21:05] sometimes when you get ready to leave
[1:21:07] you wonder how am I going to get
[1:21:10] everything in the bag that that I packed
[1:21:12] in there and especially if somebody
[1:21:14] brings you a little knick-knack or
[1:21:16] something like that I remember one time
[1:21:17] they brought me this nice basket when I
[1:21:19] was in Mexico the first time this past
[1:21:20] year and I thought where in the world am
[1:21:22] I going to put this thing out beautiful
[1:21:23] basket that the sister had weaved and
[1:21:25] made but I had to leave it sitting right
[1:21:27] there on a nightstand in their home I
[1:21:29] had to leave it sitting right there I
[1:21:31] couldn't bring it with me I had no room
[1:21:32] for it whatsoever what are you saying
[1:21:34] brother Samuel I'm telling you what the
[1:21:36] prophet told us where he said that when
[1:21:38] you have received the Holy Ghost
[1:21:40] everything you have need of is in you
[1:21:43] right then including the rapture
[1:21:47] it's in us already
[1:21:50] listen let me tell you something even if
[1:21:52] you're sitting here tonight without the
[1:21:54] Holy Ghost let me tell you what the Holy
[1:21:56] Ghost comes for to Quicken it's already
[1:21:58] in you all you got to do is turn and
[1:22:00] loose and say Lord let me sink into that
[1:22:03] garment there's already things you're
[1:22:05] dealing with my life let me just sink
[1:22:07] fully into the Garment of sonship Lord
[1:22:13] glory be to God but put on now notice
[1:22:16] this put on once again sink into
[1:22:19] therefore
[1:22:20] as the elect of god notice is when Paul
[1:22:24] is dealing with this it's a
[1:22:25] responsibility of our sonship
[1:22:27] put on therefore as the elect of God
[1:22:30] holy and beloved notice where this this
[1:22:35] is speaking of it's generating the
[1:22:37] purity
[1:22:39] the Purity there within a life in the
[1:22:41] Heart by the spirit of God now notice
[1:22:44] here's what we are to sink into
[1:22:47] bowels of Mercies
[1:22:49] now those of you I know as you know
[1:22:52] speaking to people that's in the medical
[1:22:53] field and water these bowels of mercies
[1:22:55] it deals with the spleen
[1:22:57] where there is a recycling of even
[1:23:00] damaged cells where there's recycling of
[1:23:03] things that is just not right but it
[1:23:06] must pass through there in other words
[1:23:07] what is Paul saying sink into this
[1:23:09] garment that when things aren't just
[1:23:12] right there is that which can be passed
[1:23:15] right through instead of it just getting
[1:23:16] thrown out but there is an access we
[1:23:19] have as Believers not just that we have
[1:23:22] but I've got a confidence that if
[1:23:24] there's something wrong I'm going to
[1:23:26] talk about it but what I'm going to do
[1:23:28] is pray for him because there's bows of
[1:23:31] Mercy in the house of God there is a
[1:23:34] place that where there's wrong wrongs
[1:23:36] can be made right there is a place where
[1:23:39] error can be corrected and Truth come
[1:23:41] forth what is it bowels of Mercies
[1:23:46] and kindness
[1:23:49] it's called just being kind
[1:23:54] humbleness of mine
[1:23:57] low opinion of self now that don't mean
[1:24:00] walking around always have to say it it
[1:24:03] don't mean walking around oh I ain't no
[1:24:04] good I know
[1:24:06] stop lying
[1:24:08] that ain't humility
[1:24:11] what that is that's called Pride
[1:24:15] it's not humility
[1:24:17] because humility is not about announcing
[1:24:21] all of this but humility is where you
[1:24:23] erect because sometimes things that
[1:24:25] they're said we really don't believe it
[1:24:28] we're just saying it because it's a good
[1:24:29] and right thing to say it just sounds
[1:24:31] good
[1:24:33] but you see that's where the Prophet
[1:24:35] told us in the seals he said we better
[1:24:36] quit saying one thing and thinking
[1:24:38] another
[1:24:39] right I said God let David let not only
[1:24:43] my words in my mouth but the meditation
[1:24:46] of my heart let it be lined up
[1:24:49] learning the humbleness of Matt you see
[1:24:51] humbleness of mine this comes into
[1:24:54] display even when there's something you
[1:24:56] don't agree with something that you
[1:24:58] don't think is right what kind of
[1:25:00] attitude do you take
[1:25:02] they should know better than that
[1:25:05] look how long they've been around and
[1:25:10] man
[1:25:13] not be able to get you a court and get
[1:25:14] you a TV show
[1:25:16] humbleness of mine come on friends you
[1:25:20] see it's easy to be humble when there's
[1:25:22] no humility required
[1:25:24] but it's when things do not set right
[1:25:26] and Jive just right with us what kind of
[1:25:29] an attitude do we take I'm talking about
[1:25:31] the Garment of our sonship
[1:25:33] our attitude this is why what is it that
[1:25:35] sticky part about us we've got to
[1:25:37] recognize it it'll bother us until the
[1:25:40] day that we are removed but remember I
[1:25:43] pray to God how can it really bother us
[1:25:46] unless we're really living in the
[1:25:48] presence of God I mean submitting
[1:25:50] ourselves to God in the right way if
[1:25:53] we're not if a person can actually be
[1:25:55] born again but they'll actually make
[1:25:58] excuses for stickiness in their life
[1:26:02] sometimes having scriptures and quotes
[1:26:04] to go along with it that just seem to
[1:26:06] get stuck
[1:26:08] these quotes always get stuck right here
[1:26:10] and these scriptures always get stuck
[1:26:12] right here
[1:26:13] oh God help us
[1:26:16] my goodness he is all this he only
[1:26:17] unpacking here humbleness of mine and
[1:26:20] meekness what's meekness you know the
[1:26:23] Bible tells us Moses was the meekest man
[1:26:24] in all the Earth how in the world
[1:26:27] the prophet told us that Moses had a
[1:26:29] temper
[1:26:31] come on he came right out of the prince
[1:26:33] of God and when he saw the people acting
[1:26:35] the way he did come on now you come out
[1:26:38] right of a good service and your
[1:26:39] children get you on a mess
[1:26:42] I come on friends or there might not be
[1:26:44] children might be something else come
[1:26:46] your way of Bill's in the mailbox or an
[1:26:48] email has come or something else come on
[1:26:49] we're not ignorant of Satan's devices
[1:26:51] that whole purpose is done to try to
[1:26:54] knock out the confidence that God's put
[1:26:56] in you and that stickiness flares up and
[1:26:58] then what does the devil do turn right
[1:27:00] around and say aha see I tell you at
[1:27:03] that very moment you want to come right
[1:27:04] back to the Garment of the sonship and
[1:27:07] say Lord forgive me Lord Jesus I am not
[1:27:10] going to live and allow this to Rob what
[1:27:13] you placed in my heart
[1:27:16] because God's given you confidence
[1:27:17] tonight
[1:27:19] service God's given you confidence
[1:27:22] Hallelujah meekness you know what
[1:27:25] meekness is to give place
[1:27:29] to get place
[1:27:32] sometimes you have to give place to
[1:27:34] things
[1:27:35] you know how it is
[1:27:37] there are certain things that even as it
[1:27:39] comes from me that's just me
[1:27:41] I can we can be getting ready to come
[1:27:43] into I wish everything well I wish I was
[1:27:45] completely always perfect in this
[1:27:47] because there's been some traps but
[1:27:49] everything that where what my desires to
[1:27:51] do I'm just you use it for example come
[1:27:53] into the house of God I do I want to
[1:27:55] avoid all kinds of conversations
[1:27:57] I'm not interested in conversations
[1:27:59] matter of fact I'm not interested in
[1:28:01] talking about this and talking about
[1:28:02] that and talking about this I'm not
[1:28:04] interested I could care less if you
[1:28:05] could talk to me about the most
[1:28:07] beautiful hydrangea there is I could
[1:28:08] care less at that moment there's only
[1:28:10] one thing I've got on my mind and that
[1:28:13] is the word of God
[1:28:15] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:28:17] because with that right there the very
[1:28:19] thing that the enemy can do he can try
[1:28:21] to throw something else and it causes
[1:28:23] the mind to be taken off because there's
[1:28:25] so many times that even as I'm on this
[1:28:28] is just me as I'm on my way to church
[1:28:29] and then even as I sit there and I'm
[1:28:31] meditating meditating in prayer that the
[1:28:33] holy spirit continues to unpack and
[1:28:36] unfold even the direction I can be
[1:28:38] sitting there studied and I just don't
[1:28:40] know Lord how are we going to start this
[1:28:42] thing out you know it's kind of like
[1:28:43] getting thing getting something going
[1:28:45] how we going to start it out I don't
[1:28:47] know how to get it started out and
[1:28:48] sometimes it's just that way but I think
[1:28:50] about in our lives if we could in
[1:28:52] ourselves understand that there are
[1:28:55] times there are moments what I'm talking
[1:28:56] about there can be conversations that
[1:28:58] would come up in our home now let's
[1:29:00] let's just be honest right now there's
[1:29:02] conversations that can come up that you
[1:29:04] know if you get in that conversation
[1:29:06] it's not a quick answer that
[1:29:08] conversation you're going to have to
[1:29:10] give this answer then you'll have to
[1:29:11] take your position then you have to take
[1:29:13] the position here and then you have to
[1:29:15] by the time you're done the jury is
[1:29:17] still sitting there
[1:29:19] right
[1:29:21] well glory to God I feel like going to
[1:29:23] church now
[1:29:25] did you see and that's the simple things
[1:29:27] of how Satan wants to try to come at us
[1:29:30] and there's certain times of meekness I
[1:29:32] just don't believe that when it comes to
[1:29:34] the house of God I say Lord I don't know
[1:29:36] what every trap is laid out before me
[1:29:38] but help me in those moments when a
[1:29:41] place is needed to be given let me give
[1:29:45] Place Lord
[1:29:47] y'all ever heard of the statement you
[1:29:49] got to decide what mountain you're going
[1:29:50] to die on
[1:29:52] those you know in the school system when
[1:29:54] you're teaching or whatever more you've
[1:29:56] got teachers that would die on
[1:29:57] everything they down and Hills there's
[1:30:00] registering kids up for everything in
[1:30:02] the world why
[1:30:04] you're just stressing yourself out
[1:30:08] figure out what mountain you're going to
[1:30:09] die on and die on it but don't die no
[1:30:11] ant hill
[1:30:13] are you with me we all know this it
[1:30:15] don't matter teacher or not factor of it
[1:30:17] no matter what it is there's things that
[1:30:18] come our way but listen I wish I wished
[1:30:21] that I could say and I'll just speak for
[1:30:23] the rest of you that my goodness were
[1:30:25] perfect and after this we'll never die
[1:30:28] on an ant hill no we probably will still
[1:30:30] die on some ant hills but God I want to
[1:30:33] receive Grace that you will teach me and
[1:30:36] help me Lord help me to live so close to
[1:30:39] you that when the Trap arises Lord that
[1:30:41] I don't be drawn into it Lord but just
[1:30:45] to let it pass
[1:30:50] and long
[1:30:52] suffering
[1:30:54] that means to be
[1:30:59] long suffering
[1:31:01] how long long
[1:31:03] how long's long long
[1:31:10] instead of the song higher housing
[1:31:12] longer longer
[1:31:15] verse 13. I want you to notice this
[1:31:18] verse
[1:31:20] forbearing one another
[1:31:25] um them ing words
[1:31:29] everybody knows what ing means that
[1:31:31] means ongoing
[1:31:34] for bearing one another
[1:31:36] bearing with one another
[1:31:41] this is part of the Garment of the
[1:31:42] sonship
[1:31:44] this is a garment that's displayed
[1:31:47] on the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:31:49] that's not so much out here but from in
[1:31:52] here notice when we give the men or man
[1:31:54] the right away Brethren preaches on that
[1:31:57] and look into the Unseen he'll talk
[1:31:59] about it in Victory Day He said so many
[1:32:01] times we robbed the Inner Man and don't
[1:32:04] give him the right away if we'll let the
[1:32:06] inner man have it because let me tell
[1:32:07] you something the real you is the Inner
[1:32:10] Man
[1:32:11] not this guy out here that's all sticky
[1:32:13] this guy ain't coming up in the
[1:32:15] resurrection it's that wheat life on the
[1:32:18] inside
[1:32:19] well brother Samuel why am I still
[1:32:21] bothered to remind you you've not
[1:32:24] arrived home yet
[1:32:26] why am I bothered because they keep you
[1:32:29] and I on our knees and humble before God
[1:32:31] and say Lord I need help
[1:32:35] amen
[1:32:38] forgiving oh there it goes again
[1:32:41] forgiving one another
[1:32:44] my mind that means ongoing
[1:32:48] wonder why Paul would write that
[1:32:52] wonder why well first of all one Paul
[1:32:55] he was a channel but it was a Holy
[1:32:57] Spirit you know why
[1:32:58] because we are
[1:33:02] a conglomeration of humanity
[1:33:06] listen every Church you have three kinds
[1:33:08] of Believers but let me just tell you
[1:33:09] this this scripture was not written for
[1:33:11] the unbeliever
[1:33:13] let me go ahead and say it it wasn't
[1:33:14] written for the make-believer you know
[1:33:16] why the only one that can fulfill this
[1:33:18] would be a believer because why they've
[1:33:21] got access to the Garment of sonship
[1:33:26] well it doesn't mean you understand when
[1:33:28] we talk about forbearing it doesn't mean
[1:33:29] that forbearing if it's easy no it
[1:33:32] requires dying but how do I die
[1:33:35] how do I yield yield to the Inner Man
[1:33:38] because where is my strength going to
[1:33:40] come from remember where is that new
[1:33:41] life where does it build from it builds
[1:33:44] from the inside so my strength is going
[1:33:46] to be from the inside where is my where
[1:33:49] is forgiveness where does forgiveness
[1:33:51] come from does forgiveness come from out
[1:33:53] here because I know so many times you
[1:33:55] know that it's thought of forgiveness is
[1:33:57] just well it's just saying sorry
[1:33:58] forgiveness isn't cheap
[1:34:00] forgiveness is real
[1:34:03] forgiveness has a cause forgiveness has
[1:34:05] a price is that right forgiveness is not
[1:34:08] just something that we just say sorry
[1:34:10] because remember the Lord Jesus I don't
[1:34:13] have time to read it tonight but you can
[1:34:14] read it in Matthew 18. he said that mean
[1:34:17] that when we failed to forgive someone
[1:34:20] from our heart
[1:34:24] we could say it from here
[1:34:26] but if it's not from here
[1:34:29] God looks on the heart
[1:34:31] God looks on the heart is that right so
[1:34:35] it's got to be something that is within
[1:34:37] here let me tell you the only way that
[1:34:39] that's going to be able to be dealt with
[1:34:41] is that of the Garment of the sonship
[1:34:44] listen friends I know there's people
[1:34:46] that you work with people in your family
[1:34:48] that don't even hear this preaching like
[1:34:50] this maybe not even read from the
[1:34:52] scriptures like this and they've had to
[1:34:54] forgive people I don't have a doubt that
[1:34:56] there's been people that's had to do
[1:34:58] that but let me say this to you you and
[1:35:00] I are called to a rapture we are called
[1:35:03] to a Divine appointment and all hell is
[1:35:07] against this Revelation it's against it
[1:35:10] and he can't stop the Revelation but
[1:35:13] what he wants to do is get at your life
[1:35:16] get at my life and try to hinder the
[1:35:19] flow
[1:35:20] that's why brother Branham could say and
[1:35:22] humble thyself he said don't ever take a
[1:35:25] complex of thinking against somebody
[1:35:27] when you think they are wrong or you see
[1:35:30] him do something wrong he said I'm
[1:35:32] telling you don't ever do that because
[1:35:34] this Tabernacle will lose its strength
[1:35:40] oh the prophet of God preaches here it
[1:35:42] don't matter
[1:35:43] if the people
[1:35:45] if the people
[1:35:47] see it isn't it isn't the pastor that
[1:35:49] passed packs the victory we are a body
[1:35:51] together
[1:35:53] we are a body together that's why
[1:35:55] individually in the Garment of our
[1:35:58] sonship this is where we are yielding
[1:36:00] sinking into and to say Lord help me to
[1:36:03] sink more into that garment
[1:36:08] well Amen to that brother Samuel so how
[1:36:11] many let's talk about that forgiveness
[1:36:12] for men how many times you reckon I need
[1:36:14] to forgive somebody
[1:36:20] well let's see what Google says no don't
[1:36:22] see what Google says
[1:36:30] Peter asked
[1:36:34] foreign
[1:36:36] Lord just tell me
[1:36:38] how many times I gonna have to forgive
[1:36:39] them
[1:36:41] he said 70 times 7. I wonder if Peter
[1:36:44] started thinking I wonder if it's a
[1:36:45] Christian bookstore with a chart that
[1:36:46] has
[1:36:47] see 70 times 7 490. I wonder if there's
[1:36:50] one that has a charts of 490. let me
[1:36:52] tell you that was a statement that was
[1:36:54] made for you and I to realize
[1:36:56] if you're that good at keeping offenses
[1:36:58] let me tell you what you need you need a
[1:37:00] good dose of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:03] you need a real good dose of the Holy
[1:37:04] Ghost you need to sink deeper in this
[1:37:06] garment
[1:37:07] come on Friends
[1:37:11] but this very word for giving this is
[1:37:14] what this word means to show oneself
[1:37:18] gracious
[1:37:19] benevolent to Pardon give freely bestow
[1:37:24] to forgive I know I know I know I know I
[1:37:28] know
[1:37:28] I know
[1:37:30] I've heard this said before too
[1:37:33] and I understand where we go with this
[1:37:35] oh brother Samuel I can forgive but to
[1:37:38] forget
[1:37:43] and you know what it is they've never
[1:37:46] forgiven
[1:37:47] now let me just tell you what forgive
[1:37:49] what forgetting means forgetting does
[1:37:52] not mean that you forget the offense
[1:37:54] that's not what forgetting is
[1:37:58] because there can be an offense that has
[1:38:00] come your way
[1:38:01] and you can maybe even hear the mention
[1:38:03] or see individual whatever more and
[1:38:06] there's certain that depends on what has
[1:38:07] been done or taken place it can actually
[1:38:09] cause something there to move you know
[1:38:11] your body will react to it in a certain
[1:38:13] way and it doesn't mean that you're
[1:38:14] actually even holding anything but you
[1:38:17] understand that forgiveness in itself
[1:38:19] when we look at it it's something that
[1:38:21] is going down to deal with the actual
[1:38:24] memory in other words we need to take
[1:38:26] out the malignancy and let it become a
[1:38:29] benign memory
[1:38:31] because malignancy will spread it's a
[1:38:34] cancer is that right
[1:38:36] it's things that will spread within a
[1:38:38] life what will a lack of forgiveness now
[1:38:42] I know well brother Samuel I can forgive
[1:38:44] but I cannot forget
[1:38:47] okay I got a lot of quotes on that one
[1:38:49] as well
[1:38:50] I also we have that where the Bible says
[1:38:52] that the Lord Jesus has put our sins in
[1:38:57] the sea of forgetfulness we have it in
[1:39:00] the scripture where God has said when I
[1:39:02] call you back I will remember it no more
[1:39:05] and with the quotes brother random says
[1:39:08] see we can forgive but I can't forgive I
[1:39:12] always remember it'll always be there
[1:39:14] that that I could remember and notice he
[1:39:18] said but he almighty God has access to
[1:39:22] the sea of forgetfulness and he doesn't
[1:39:25] remember it at all not only are we
[1:39:28] forgiven he forgot it
[1:39:31] it's been Justified so you say well then
[1:39:34] how does that relate to me with the
[1:39:36] Garment of sonship there is Grace that
[1:39:40] comes to you and I to be able to take
[1:39:43] the sting out of the memory to give us
[1:39:46] Grace so that we can go on and our lives
[1:39:49] the rest of our lives do not become
[1:39:52] shaped
[1:39:54] by past experiences
[1:39:58] that's God's grace
[1:40:01] that's why brother Randall could tell us
[1:40:03] and say
[1:40:04] he said you know they're founding out in
[1:40:06] medical science
[1:40:08] he said that the lack of forgiveness and
[1:40:11] holding grudges
[1:40:14] it causes cancer
[1:40:16] ulcers
[1:40:17] now the scripture tells us
[1:40:21] I'm just we're just moving all around
[1:40:23] but the scripture tells us
[1:40:27] I know it tells us beloved I wish above
[1:40:29] all things that thou mayest prosper and
[1:40:31] be in good health even as thy Soul does
[1:40:33] prosper and the church said
[1:40:36] that's God's desire so not just when I'm
[1:40:39] sick
[1:40:40] that I will receive Divine Healing but
[1:40:43] God's interested that we have good
[1:40:45] health that matches what is on the
[1:40:48] inside of our soul remember these bodies
[1:40:51] are still sin but it shows you and I
[1:40:53] that when we get to looking at things if
[1:40:55] the prophet could tell it like this and
[1:40:57] say that they have proved that those who
[1:40:59] hold grudges women who fuss do fight and
[1:41:02] argue they die it'll cause cancer fungus
[1:41:05] and everything else and ulcers will set
[1:41:07] in listen I got a lot of other
[1:41:08] scientific data sitting in front of me
[1:41:10] here right now you know that when I
[1:41:12] ministered on these things but do you
[1:41:14] realize that right here when the
[1:41:16] prophets referring to this this is
[1:41:17] before Medical Science itself is even
[1:41:19] discovering this do you realize before a
[1:41:23] cancer patient when they take them into
[1:41:24] an Institute to really go through the
[1:41:27] treatments you know what they try to do
[1:41:28] they try to calm down through that life
[1:41:30] and see is there any grudges in that
[1:41:33] life are they holding anything in their
[1:41:36] life against anybody this is not a
[1:41:38] preacher this is them in medical science
[1:41:40] they said because if there is anything
[1:41:43] in their life a grudge a lack of
[1:41:45] forgiveness the medicine won't work at
[1:41:48] all
[1:41:49] well that's scriptural
[1:41:52] in order for the Holy Ghost to come
[1:41:54] there's got to be a clear confession
[1:41:57] right in order for healing to come and
[1:41:59] last all sins got to be cleared out of
[1:42:01] the life it's got to be repented of
[1:42:04] God just makes Medical Science testify
[1:42:06] of his ways
[1:42:09] so you say by the same well that's out
[1:42:11] there for cancer well how is it when the
[1:42:13] word of God is coming forth I say like
[1:42:15] this friends let the Holy Ghost so come
[1:42:18] through our lives that God if there's
[1:42:20] anything that's unlike you if there's
[1:42:22] something in my life that's not lined up
[1:42:24] right if I'm holding a grudge if there's
[1:42:26] something that's there it's not worth it
[1:42:28] lord it's keeping you from being more
[1:42:31] effectual in me and through my life
[1:42:34] and it'll affect every other
[1:42:36] relationship in your life
[1:42:40] I don't have time to preach at all
[1:42:41] tonight but I just I I think we just I
[1:42:44] think the holy spirit is hit all
[1:42:47] right here tonight God has a way of
[1:42:49] doing it
[1:42:51] he has a way of doing I'm just glad to
[1:42:52] go with him
[1:43:01] here's a simple statement
[1:43:05] oh
[1:43:09] you've heard it a lot too resentments
[1:43:11] and grudges and there's all the
[1:43:12] scriptures I just didn't go through all
[1:43:14] them tonight but the principle was laid
[1:43:16] out can you say man
[1:43:19] where we're laying James talks about how
[1:43:21] close we are to the coming of the Lord
[1:43:22] be patient establish your hearts Grudge
[1:43:25] not against one another and that word
[1:43:27] Grudge right there it means a
[1:43:31] h
[1:43:32] so when we sing the song At The Mention
[1:43:34] Of Your Name
[1:43:38] that's what that's that's what that word
[1:43:39] Grudge means
[1:43:46] but friends I'm pointing you to the
[1:43:47] place of resource
[1:43:50] it's within you
[1:43:53] the same it seems like some things are
[1:43:55] sticking here well just sink deeper
[1:43:58] the same I'm having problems in this
[1:44:00] area in my life just sink deeper in the
[1:44:02] Garment say God take me deeper
[1:44:05] Lord take me deeper I want to go deeper
[1:44:07] I don't matter where you're at tonight
[1:44:09] whether justification sanctification
[1:44:11] Lord take me deeper baptism of the whole
[1:44:13] take me deeper Lord I want to go deeper
[1:44:16] I want to live by the Garment of the
[1:44:18] sunshine I don't want to lean on my own
[1:44:21] understanding it's always messing me up
[1:44:23] it gets me all scrupled up
[1:44:25] is that right
[1:44:27] this is why they would say resentment
[1:44:31] grudges bitterness it's like drinking
[1:44:33] poison
[1:44:34] and waiting for the other person
[1:44:41] and they're doing fine glory to God
[1:44:44] maybe I need to take a little bit more
[1:44:46] no no stop just put that down
[1:44:48] and what you need is a good drink of the
[1:44:51] Holy Ghost
[1:44:52] that's what you need because let me tell
[1:44:54] you what the Holy Ghost is it has within
[1:44:56] it forgiveness it has within it release
[1:44:58] and pardon
[1:45:00] because let me tell you how serious
[1:45:02] Grudge is let me just say this to you I
[1:45:05] think this statement is one that would
[1:45:08] need to be mentioned Brethren told us
[1:45:10] the people no matter
[1:45:12] what someone's done choose life
[1:45:17] he said if there's one ought in your
[1:45:19] heart against any person
[1:45:22] sinner or Saint you're in danger of
[1:45:27] Hellfire
[1:45:29] well what is ought
[1:45:31] well they've done wrong wanting to see
[1:45:34] that person destroyed is what you call
[1:45:36] malice
[1:45:38] and that ain't the love of God the love
[1:45:40] of God is corrective but the word
[1:45:43] correction in the scripture does not
[1:45:45] mean to destroy that word correction I
[1:45:48] know my Bible it means restoration
[1:45:52] are you hearing me that's what
[1:45:54] correction means
[1:45:56] that's a desire that we would have is
[1:45:59] that right
[1:46:01] oh
[1:46:03] I just say it like this
[1:46:06] like that remember that one servant that
[1:46:07] came and healed the king
[1:46:10] a hundred ten thousand talents was it
[1:46:14] called King have mercy on me please
[1:46:16] forgive me let my debt go Matthew
[1:46:18] chapter 11 my death Go Let It Go
[1:46:21] and the King had compassion on him
[1:46:24] he let him go
[1:46:25] so he went out
[1:46:28] and here he had a servant that on him a
[1:46:31] hundred Pence
[1:46:32] I mean we're talking about going from
[1:46:34] like a hundred thousand dollars to a
[1:46:37] five dollar bill
[1:46:39] and this guy went out of the went out of
[1:46:42] the presence of the king
[1:46:44] and he laid his hands on that guy give
[1:46:48] me my five dollars a lot of good five
[1:46:50] dollars gonna go do against your five
[1:46:52] hundred thousand dollar debt
[1:46:55] but you see what it was he acted the way
[1:46:57] he did because he was in debt
[1:47:02] you can only exercise true forgiveness
[1:47:04] as you know it
[1:47:07] I'm come on come on I'm writing the
[1:47:08] scripture when Paul wrote to Philemon
[1:47:10] remember his his slave that servant
[1:47:14] onisimus had fled away right he took
[1:47:16] some money he'd ran away and notice Paul
[1:47:19] writes back to Layman and said hey you
[1:47:22] owe me your own soul this is my son in
[1:47:25] the gospel he's more profitable to you
[1:47:28] now than he was when he left
[1:47:30] [Music]
[1:47:32] went back carrying a letter that had his
[1:47:35] pardon wrote all over it
[1:47:37] Hallelujah come right from the messenger
[1:47:39] of the age I've got a pardon I'm no
[1:47:41] longer guilty and there's no more
[1:47:42] condemnation on me ain't no shame on me
[1:47:44] I am free what is it I've been forgiven
[1:47:47] and he's running with a message and Paul
[1:47:49] lets from Lima know thou knowest thou
[1:47:52] always thou own soul even to me why a
[1:47:55] word had come that had brought that
[1:47:56] broke the chains off of Layman's life
[1:47:59] and that's what brother Brown could say
[1:48:01] I think it's the Christian attitude that
[1:48:03] if anybody asks forgiveness you forgive
[1:48:05] them
[1:48:07] that's real sonship
[1:48:10] this is the Garment that we want to
[1:48:13] display
[1:48:14] because you realize he goes on there to
[1:48:16] say
[1:48:17] in Matthew 18 it says
[1:48:21] when the wind here the king came and
[1:48:23] took that Wicked servant
[1:48:25] he threw him into prison
[1:48:27] but you know what the prison he was in
[1:48:29] it wasn't one of so much of bars it was
[1:48:32] torment
[1:48:34] he was tormented
[1:48:36] because
[1:48:37] he would not forgive
[1:48:40] servant
[1:48:44] but all he had to do was recognize
[1:48:48] it's a moment of forgiveness
[1:48:51] there's been a breakdown but I'm ready
[1:48:53] to come back in line and
[1:48:55] get everything settled get it all right
[1:48:57] under the blue we're brothers we're
[1:48:59] sisters
[1:49:00] like that song says you're my brother
[1:49:02] you're my sister so take me by the hand
[1:49:05] together we will stand
[1:49:10] I'll leave you with one last quote here
[1:49:12] as we finish this part up
[1:49:15] I love this statement
[1:49:20] forgiveness
[1:49:22] is to release a prisoner
[1:49:24] and to realize
[1:49:26] that the prisoner is you
[1:49:32] not the other person
[1:49:36] you're still held
[1:49:38] by the memory of the offense
[1:49:42] but Samuel what should I do well let me
[1:49:43] just tell you this right here I know
[1:49:45] I've closed everything up I've closed it
[1:49:47] all up
[1:49:49] let me just put it in terms so you and I
[1:49:51] understand it
[1:49:54] sometimes we get we when we're on the
[1:49:56] internet and searching for stuff and
[1:49:57] looking for things sometimes there's
[1:49:59] pop-ups that come up
[1:50:02] there's things that comes up right now
[1:50:04] what comes up
[1:50:07] if you go in an amazing here you go
[1:50:09] maybe you're looking at a pair of Crocs
[1:50:12] and all of a sudden then here you are
[1:50:14] you're going on there to look at I don't
[1:50:16] know vacation or wherever
[1:50:19] west side of Lorraine you're looking it
[1:50:22] up and all of a sudden here comes a
[1:50:23] pop-up Crocs
[1:50:26] why it's what you showed interest in
[1:50:29] before
[1:50:31] see everything on the internet is based
[1:50:33] on algorithms
[1:50:35] so it studies you and it tries to feed
[1:50:38] to you what you like we're both saying
[1:50:40] what does that how does that have to do
[1:50:42] with offenses and memory and forgiveness
[1:50:44] or it does have a little application in
[1:50:46] there because when you can allow the
[1:50:50] love of God to say Lord
[1:50:53] let me be so sunk into this garment
[1:50:58] it doesn't mean that pop-ups won't come
[1:51:00] it just means you don't pay any
[1:51:03] attention to them no more
[1:51:05] memories can come up of offenses but you
[1:51:09] know what
[1:51:11] don't bother me no more
[1:51:13] don't bother me no more it can pop up so
[1:51:16] just because it pops up don't mean it
[1:51:18] ain't been forgiven and you hadn't
[1:51:20] forgot about it what it is you can stand
[1:51:22] there and look at it said don't bother
[1:51:23] me no more
[1:51:29] of the sonship
[1:51:32] glory be to God musicians come
[1:51:35] oh don't you love him tonight
[1:51:38] amen aren't you thankful for God's grace
[1:51:40] tonight
[1:51:42] thankful for his Mercy Hallelujah I tell
[1:51:45] you we get to we get to exercising in
[1:51:48] that Garment of sonship we start feeling
[1:51:50] lighter
[1:51:51] my load feels lighter ain't that right
[1:51:53] brother Chris I start feeling a lighter
[1:51:55] you know why because it's that Garment
[1:51:57] of the sonship it's already been a
[1:51:59] rapturing condition that's coming here
[1:52:00] and and here we are when we get caught
[1:52:02] into that in Heavenly places and my we
[1:52:05] start fellowshipping around that because
[1:52:07] that's really who we fellowship with
[1:52:08] we're fellowshipping though you shake my
[1:52:10] hand but what it is that we have
[1:52:12] fellowship with one another is the
[1:52:15] attributes of almighty God our
[1:52:17] fellowshipping one with another we are
[1:52:20] Sons and Daughters of God
[1:52:23] oh we have been made more than
[1:52:26] conquerors I say Lord Jesus let me sink
[1:52:29] more into that garment Lord because this
[1:52:32] guy out here is sticky it gives you
[1:52:34] sticky and there's sometimes I do need I
[1:52:37] need some help sometimes in prayer maybe
[1:52:39] it's sometimes where there's around men
[1:52:40] maybe you know talking with my wife
[1:52:42] talking with another brother there are
[1:52:44] some times and God is there to help us
[1:52:46] not that I don't want to encourage
[1:52:48] somebody's stickiness
[1:52:49] are you hearing me I don't want to
[1:52:51] encourage somebody's stickiness but I my
[1:52:54] desire is let's try to let's try to get
[1:52:55] out of that stickiness because you know
[1:52:57] what it's sticky and it's prickly that's
[1:52:59] what that Coco bro is but oh my may God
[1:53:02] help us to sink in
[1:53:05] to that garment
[1:53:06] let me so sink into it Lord
[1:53:09] there's no doubt in my life there's some
[1:53:11] more tailoring that I need in my life
[1:53:13] I'm sure of that in my character like
[1:53:16] Elisha needed to be tailored out I know
[1:53:18] there's more of Samuel that needs to be
[1:53:19] tailored away you know it's kind of like
[1:53:21] getting in front of the mirror and here
[1:53:22] you go brother's with your suit with
[1:53:24] your suit coat on and you go like this
[1:53:25] and you go oh boy
[1:53:27] here we go right now may have to have a
[1:53:30] rubber band on this one to hold this
[1:53:31] thing together
[1:53:33] but what do you realize when you look in
[1:53:34] the mirror you need to lose some
[1:53:37] got to cut out certain things here and
[1:53:39] there and that's how it is when we look
[1:53:41] into the mirror of God's word
[1:53:43] when we look in the mirror of God's word
[1:53:45] and say Lord
[1:53:46] better in my life I want to sink more

[1:55:23] Lord God but may we
[1:55:26] bring every thought help us Lord to live
[1:55:28] live from that outer from that inner man
[1:55:32] when we live Lord from the outside
[1:55:35] or react we're pulled that way Lord
[1:55:39] the stickiness
[1:55:41] but I pray that God
[1:55:42] [Music]
[1:55:44] I think Lord is as we get in your
[1:55:46] presence
[1:55:48] kind of like this
[1:55:50] when we come out of Lord being in prayer
[1:55:52] we come out of a service come out of a
[1:55:55] Time Lord that just been meditating on
[1:55:57] you
[1:55:59] and then it's like when you have to walk
[1:56:01] out into another environment you feel
[1:56:02] like oh my goodness I don't even fit
[1:56:05] here
[1:56:06] this don't mind I I feel like such a
[1:56:09] stranger
[1:56:10] I feel so all alone
[1:56:13] maybe they come out of their cubicle
[1:56:14] maybe they come out of their space Maybe
[1:56:16] Lord where they've been walking Lord in
[1:56:18] the halls and worshiping you and been
[1:56:20] hearing Lord God when they walk into the
[1:56:22] break room or something like oh my
[1:56:25] I'm a stranger here
[1:56:28] and here Lord Jesus
[1:56:30] that's just how Lord that
[1:56:34] as we would just live just the
[1:56:35] Simplicity of living in your presence O

[1:56:38] entertaining you Lord
[1:56:41] fellowshipping with you
[1:56:44] that God as we spend more time
[1:56:48] with you and that I realize Lord
[1:56:51] working an eight-hour day sometimes Lord
[1:56:53] some work 12-hour day it doesn't mean
[1:56:55] Lord that they've got to take the rest
[1:56:57] of the 16 hours of the day they're the
[1:56:59] other 12 12 hours of the date no no
[1:57:01] it's the quality of the time it's making
[1:57:04] time for you Lord it don't even have to
[1:57:07] wait till after the job is over
[1:57:09] they can have fellowship with you Lord I
[1:57:12] believe God that you can come right by
[1:57:14] the side
[1:57:15] you can help them Lord if they'll just
[1:57:17] reach out to you and they'll say Lord I
[1:57:19] want to have Fellowship
[1:57:20] I really don't know Lord how to keep my
[1:57:22] mind all occupied on things I have to do
[1:57:24] and this and that but Lord
[1:57:26] I want to entertain you
[1:57:29] I want to have fellowship with you I
[1:57:31] want to walk these halls with you Jesus
[1:57:34] the Lord to wear that as we would
[1:57:37] help us
[1:57:39] to where the things around us would be
[1:57:41] like that Lord you would bother us
[1:57:44] the bothering the Lord is where we've
[1:57:45] lived in your presence to where when we
[1:57:47] can sense even a reaction wanting to
[1:57:50] come from our life Lord that would not
[1:57:52] be a reaction of the spirit of God it
[1:57:54] would even bother us of the thought but
[1:57:58] Lord help us
[1:58:00] help us to realize
[1:58:02] Temptations will come but temptation is
[1:58:05] not sin
