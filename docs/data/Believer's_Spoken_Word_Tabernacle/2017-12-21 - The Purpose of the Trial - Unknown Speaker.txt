Lord in our lives in our midst or we pray for we ask these things Lord in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ what's your loving Amen let's turn to first Peter chapter 4 verse 12 brother Joshua did you give that testimony in did you give you a testimony you didn't would you like to do that let's read the text and then I want you to come and give that with you verse 12 of first Peter chapter 4 beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in as much as you're partakers of Christ's sufferings that when his glory shall be revealed he may be glad also with exceeding joy if you be reproached for the name of Christ happy are ye for the spirit of glory and of God rested upon you on their part that was evil spoken up but on your part he is glorified but let none of you suffer as a murderer or as a thief or as an evildoer or as a busybody in other men's matters yet if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God may God bless you bless the reading of his word which microphone use this is what about this one right here this okay is this on it was on all right god bless you maybe you have a hard time understanding yes I do say is I had the issue with my scholarship at school but the problem was like but the squash peas given by a Department of humanities but I am in nursing program so when the schedule were given for the coming spring he came up like conflicting schedule from amenities and nursing so I had to choose either manatees in order to keep the scholarship so in fact I had to have both because the scholarship pays also for nursing so I the day last week I went to see the Department of humanities they said they can do anything so I am going to lose scholarship or I wish choose to leave nursing and stay with humanities and keep scholarship so it's why I didn't have like something to do about that and it was kind of impossible because you can't when the schedule is given you can't change at all at all so he's the rule when I came here we prayed on to the request and the following day I went to meet with the nursing department so the manager of the department allowed that I could change my clinical time in order to get the time freed on Friday so I can tell my humanities class the way he walked out so smoothly you I tell you the the words that that he texts me they're just the other just the other morning on Wednesday after everything I thought was really really something where he said that even what was the established rules God moved you see there's a lot of things and this is you know and I just was I just was praying and just thinking the Lord again just even later last night I just I just took time and I said God I want to thank you because I I know you to be a God of paradoxes and you know it's just something like that that you know it just it just refreshes you you just you see that because as far as all the rules were like brother the brother was explaining here all the rules all the rules said there's no way it can be done but you know that's what a paradox that's a paradise and I believe that that testimony was not just for brother Joshua but I believe that was for all of us I believe that I believe that it's for all of us no matter what it is that you're going through there might be established laws that are against it even the way that the doctors and or whatever it might be that you're facing but God is above all he's greater than all that it doesn't matter how bleak a circumstance looks God is above it all amen don't you just love him just so appreciate that I want to want to look here just a little bit more as we've been dealing with this on on Jacobs life and the pressure that Jacob has experienced in Jacob you know his his reaction is in response to it and you know as we were looking at that of how that God in the midst of it he had spoke to Jacob to come on back home come on back get back to I'm the God of Bethel so Jacob has as some direction within the midst of this time knowing that Jacob is not one who has there's not been a full conversion in his life but he has buddy has met God and he knows God to be there to be a real living God but yet Jacob still has to be changed within his life and but yet when we look at it and you see it how what I've just drawn to in my heart four months ago even and looking at this of how that in the midst of this time God allowed these things to happen to get Jacob back in position and how that God allowed things even with Israel in the natural as we have seen here within the past years how God has allowed things to happen to get Israel in position and I believe that with all my heart that we understand that the things that that God permits to come our way that it are that there are things that God Himself is truly giving that permission but God has a purpose in mind he's not the author of frustration he's not the author of confusion but God himself has a purpose in everything that he allows and permits to come our way and when we we look at this in the word as we would you know revisit this just a little bit and before moving forward here tonight when we we think of how that God would address the the church there in in Samoa and really addressing the entirety of that age God would let it be known that he's aware of what's going on and what things that they are experiencing the tribulation the poverty even that of the blasphemy those things that were continuing within that age but yet God himself would give unto them direction in the midst of that time and in verse 10 he would tell him fear none of those things which thou shalt suffering so God was not his was a nice purpose was not to remove the suffering but yet in the midst of it God was to give them the grace and the strength of what they needed in order to navigate and move through that suffering and to think of it of how God says it here fear none of those things and there's only one thing that can actually overcome fear and dismantle fear and cast it out and that's perfect love that's God's love being revealed and you know when we we look at this and we think about the trial you know even how that God would call our attention to these things as Peter would deal with it in our opening scripture here our conduct during the trial is very much connected to what our expectations are even in our walk as a believer and so sometimes you know expectations which is things that we formed or we thought and we think in our mind and you think of our brother Brennan would would would speak even to where he would say you know he said I think that we have made it as though a flowery bed of ease we've painted things up to where the converts are looking at things he said as though there's not gonna be any troubles there's not going to be any trials but neither when a person comes to Christ does God want you or me say and I'll tell you what you're gonna have that hard oh my it's gonna be bad and I'll tell you it's just gonna be horrible I don't want them kind of people around as a matter of fact that's not a word of etiqueta edification at all to understand I can understand as you can understand that there are tests there are trials just like many of you that are sending you tonight much older than myself and older in the faith you know there's things and experiences that you have come through but yet God Himself is faithful and he has ministered to you and through you in your life and there's really sitting here tonight is there any complaints about serving the Lord is there any regrets about serving the Lord is there any regrets of every test in every trial and any reproach there's no regrets and yet some of you if we could sit down and take individually one by one the testimonies the things that each of you the experiences that we've come through it is absolutely astonishing but remember it's not the highlighting of the flesh because the flesh itself faints the fleet's flesh gets weary but it is Christ himself in us that gives us the strength to press on even when our natural is what we see fail us but yet the spiritual eyes by His grace he is able to look beyond into that unseen realm sometimes when we look at things even when we think of troubles brother Graham tells us in the men in the Hebrew series he said God likes to bring his children into trouble God likes to bring his children into trouble so think of it God could have could have taken him a different route when coming into the promised land but God brought him right to the Red Sea to the natural mind it seems like this is a mistake but it was right in the pathway that God was going to move on the scene and display his delivering hand to his children now you look at it they've already been delivered out of Egypt by a mighty hand and you think about God redeeming them and delivering him in that way but yet God loves to make himself known to you and I and the way that God makes himself known to you and I is sometimes when it comes through circumstances that are entirely impossible through travels through things that will come our way and God will make himself known as a matter of fact I'm not gonna read it tonight but brother em says God will take things out of the nest and cause she said that nest to get into a place to where you're willing to show and step forward he said and it's in that time when he can begin to show you how great he is he said God will allow a depressing spirit to hit a church and he allowed that joy to depart why so that he might truly test us and show how great he really is God will permit those things to test us to show us how great he is but I don't want to dwell on that tonight but yet looking at this aspect and I really want to just deal tonight on that suffering with him because when you look at expectations as brother Branham was talking to us you know and and he talks about how he says you know in this in this time he said life itself everybody wants a life to be easy he said been life wasn't meant to be easy he said anything that has life is a struggle and think of it in this age this aids the objectives that are so set in this age among people and it's the spirit of the age brings the people can do nothing but respond to the spirit and that by God's grace without the grace and mercy of God we would be heavily under the same influence but by His grace we are armed with the Holy Spirit to be able by his grace to discern that spirit absolutely we need God's strength and his guidance so many times because the objective is if I can only get this if I can only do this if I can only do that I will be I'll have it made but yet it's everything is just truly just a facade there's nothing real within all of that it's a promise and people are expending themselves and and giving themselves for what for what for soft easy living and yet the soft easy living is not them not twirling for it but yet they're twirling is for an expectation that I shall have rest I'm glad had that the real rest of God is not something that we would have to buy our own works obtained but the remember laboring to enter into his rest is not our works its yielding to his voice and he brings us into that place of true rest that's a great blessing that's a great blessing God stands here and tells this this church fear none of those things which you shall suffer he already has already let him know they're gonna suffer the devil shall cast you some of you into prison that you may be tried and ye shall have tribulation ten days but be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee a crown of life now notice how that when you know the Prophet will take this in through this particular part in the Simonian age and it begins to deal with what our true expectations because you know true expectations a lot of times are there things that we can craft and form even in our imagination of what we think what is true and what's reality you know remember how that that Paul would allow it to be that we should not he said you should not think of us more highly than you ought to think even how that God would allow James to bring that around so that people were not thinking that prophets were just you know more than men and they never had problems they never had discouragements but yet God allowed James to write that part and point out those things that were there so what so our real expectation because you know when our expectations are not right it hinders our conduct when the person's expectations does not intend us not match the expectations what they've expected it's frustration and it affects the conduct in you you think of that of how that even when you look at you know in the scriptures and I was just thinking even you know this week earlier and this week looking over this again of how that even in the midst of the marriage ceremony there are vowels within there the vowels that are we and that married ceremony that the majority of those vowels are not vowels that everything is going to be easy and everything is gonna be peachy and everything's gonna be flowery but the reality of those vowels and those things that are laid bare it lets it know that there is going to be a molding and a growing together and are uniting not just through the times that are good but through the suffering there's going to be growing through misunderstanding there's gonna be growing through drought that's when love really shows itself are you with me because you see we're talking about a spiritual union with the Lord Jesus Christ when you think about it now you look around you know the church look around the assembly and you can look around in other places and you see a husband and wife and you see the reflection that is there you know of Christ and and and the bride within that within that marriage but to recognize that that Union and that marriage of what you see now was not something that was just given at the altar of all the pronouncing of or pronouncing of vows it is that that's not what gave that marriage what it is but the marriage itself in that thing which we see and cherish is because of the union that has taken place and through the molding and the shaping of hardships of testings of trials of wonderings of all of those things it makes that marriage somebody with me tonight my but you know I wonder where the happily ever after but you know I don't want to just so deal on that that's no doubt in another service but you know the scripture said unto death be faithful not on til there's no stopping point unto death death is only the vehicle to bring us into the Friends of God the one that we've walked with the one that we've loved the one that has cared for us in this journey we see him face to face death only brings us into that place of waiting and move from this dimension into that dimension from this address into that address from this pest house into that house not made with hands that's the grace of God death is the grace of God to us so to think of it of how that you know in these things of how that God he doesn't hold back persecution he doesn't hold back trauma I understand that there's things that when we look at it in the natural marry there's things that we could bring troubles our own self there's things that we can do and it would bring troubles and calls trouble I understand that that's the same way that Peter is dealing with right here in the scriptures there's things that people can actually bring on themselves in serving the Lord where it's not they're not suffering for the cause of Christ they're suffering for their own fanaticism I hope you understand what I'm saying you know when this one you look brother around says it like this and by faith Moses in 1958 he said I want you to notice how then Moses himself he saw that the you know the the afflictions but yet he was able to look and he was able to look past them afflictions and see that these were of people with promise program says I don't say that you're to seek after suffering he said but suffering comes along with it he said but you know it's not us going and making ourselves something and then suffering because we've made our self odd because that's not suffering on the count of Christ you understand what I'm saying you see with fanaticism when people become fanatics with things you know I know there are some things that was going on here not too long ago in another place north of here and you had men that were standing on the streets and saying all sorts of stuff to women coming by and they were saying things you know that well you know that this is what's said and everything they when people begin the news begin to tie that in to that of a message of brother Branham because that's what these individuals said they stood for but I'll tell you right now they don't stand for the same message I stand for because then that is not representative of the same character that has delivered this the character of Christ and I'll say it like this the things that they would receive they justly deserve for the fanaticism that they I hope you understand what I'm saying you see there is a right way and suffering for Christ but then there's a place and there's a part where people can actually through their own ways and the things that they would do making themselves off can bring suffering on their selves and it's not even suffering for the cause of Christ it's because of of that which is just them making themselves off we don't need to make ourselves nothing all we need to do is walk faithfully with him you understand what I'm saying so understanding God's love is very very essential because as we looked at it last week that you know the love of God as brother branham picks this up here he deals with how that God's love that Israel themselves thought God's love to be that of justa a parental love that meant no suffering that's what they thought so they're questioning question of God of the things that are taking place and God directs them to the proof of his love and the proof of his love is not that God is saying well this has happened to this nation and this has happened to this nation and look what I've done for you but God directs their love - I have chosen here I have chosen you that in itself is there is the full finality of the love of God because God's love does not mean that there's no suffering even when God will leads you and I in his will his will being in his will does not mean that there's no suffering as a matter of fact it is a great blessing and it proves itself what it is to know you're in God's will because you will be tested and tried that's why it's a blessing to know you are in God's will because then you are able to stand there when everything would come against you you're able to stand there and say I don't know the next move but I know where I'm standing here's where God would have me to stand right now [Applause] that's a blessing so when we think of it of halibut you know there's sometimes there's things in our life that just don't go our way there's things sometimes and you know when it looks at it when we would look put it all out in and we list the things of all the reasons why it should go away it might be ever so stacked in our favor but yet it doesn't go our way things don't happen it might seem sure the world I'm gonna get this jump promotion around and this is going to happen or that's gonna happen and it doesn't happen and yet in the midst of it those are things we can't understand we can't but we do know this we do know this then all things work together for the good to them that are called according to his purpose I may not understand you see all things work together I may not understand this right here but when this comes together with another part then the understanding can come here stands Joseph Joseph is standing there he doesn't know what's going on when he's down in Egypt well I'm down here you know I'm just waiting on a famine to come he doesn't know that but oh how when he stands there at the latter time as he reveals himself to his brethren he has received that understanding within that time he's received molding and shaping of God to trust God that God will bring to pass what God has shown him and by trusting the Lord there has been molding there has been shaping to where that Joseph is able to stand there and says I don't hate you I don't dislike you ha and they and they know hey he's just to do it but he what is it Joseph has received cleansing and washing in his life from trusting in the Lord and God moving like the Bible said that the word of the Lord tried him pay men and here Joseph is able to stand there at that time and said don't be angry with yourselves where he said God has sent me ahead see an understanding that he had already come to and that understanding had cleansed and removed that's the grace of God this is this is all of those things even to where brother Branham could tell us regarding Joseph's life in Paula prisoner where the brem says there was too much pride still there still must still that had to be worked out in his life those things yet being in the midst of that prison and those times it worked out what needed to be worked out I want you to think of this if he had not been in that position and then where he was down there within those prison within all those things we were never read of the furtherance of it now you see God could and I look at it if we take it in a parent away God could have done it in such a way and said well Joseph has he not revealed to Joseph already about the sheaves bowing down sure could he not have revealed to Joseph don't go with them today don't go with them today you know how they are don't go with them God could have done that but there had to be something about it that would actually allow Joseph to go ahead and go and you mean God would permit that God wouldn't give a warning out about that no if God had gave a warning it would have messed that type right up it would have messed up the fulfillment of what it was now listen him growing all that entrapment that wasn't against God's will that was only bringing Joseph into position if he would have remained in the land he never could have helped but because through the midst of it he was able to submit himself through suffering then through his suffering he was able to stand in that and be able to minister life to them so everything that God permits to come our way is with the purpose all the testings and all the times we don't always know the purpose and I'll tell you right now we don't know the purpose but what we do know is he's not the author of frustration or confusion we know that he is the author and within this God permits with a purpose and to think of how that brother Graham picks us up like this in a Simonian age he said how he says thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you he said that's what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering now to think of these words to develop to develop a christ-like character that comes through suffering to think of how that God would ask and require of us to develop how are things to vet to develop means to grow it means to mature is that right you look at certain certain things of development that that comes about within a child or within our lives then there is a certain measure of trust that's deposited in us right there's certain things that would come our way that it can be tested or come to where that it will show whether it's trustworthy or not whether the maturity is there or not so his desire is to develop a christ-like character and I also look at this word developed because develop is likened to that of a picture where that you have a picture that's being developed but a picture now I'm not talking about these digital kind but I'm talking about pictures you know and I was still in high school we had a room an actual photography class that you actually had in a big camera it was located in a room you had to go in a locked door and through another locked door it was in a big room and was a massive camera we had to film that was that sheets and you know the big sheets like that and we to go in there and take a picture and there's certain things that we had to do with projects in that class but after taking that then that picture itself we actually would have to hang that picture up we had to go through a process of dipping it in certain acids and we could only do it for a certain period of time we couldn't leave it too long in this time because there's certain parts of silver that will begin to override the image so we had to leave it in this particular solution it's called a bath this thing is called a bath and you would lower this film in there and you would watch the watch there okay now this time you take it up you put it in this one this is a certain rinse then you and after that you hang it up and then after hanging it up then you would move it into another bath all of those were processes filled with acids that would actually be able to call certain parts of that film to be developed and other parts to be retained to hold their shape and then other parts that would actually begin to highlight the color that was in there without those acids the picture that was taken would never be able to be developed and the picture that God has taken of us before the foundation of the world let me tell you this in order to take a picture there's got to be an image to take a picture of hey man your theophany was not just created but it was always there in the presence of Almighty and there is a picture that was taken of you and through that picture then with that see as you come into this earth is deposited in your life and then through that deposit in your life when you come into the quickening by the Spirit of Almighty God then begins the process of developing a christ-like character so the new birth is not christ-like character it only empowers you with the life that's needed to submit yourself for developing is that right because when we look at this brother Ram goes on to tell us now he says we all have trials is that right we are all tried and chastened as sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and it's not being tried hasn't got it it isn't of God slat the truth the church that's not suffering I know that it can be you know that their kaminnikov world and everything else can look at it well we're suffering you know they're the abortion and all these other things are going on and and you know what there is all there is suffering but yet the suffering that we're talking about is that suffering that is that is walking in the very life of Jesus Christ this is a suffering we're talking about it is a suffering look to where that even the political world can look at it and they can disagree and say well why don't you stand for this and why don't you stand for this but yet when it comes down to it and they look at not only the stand that you are not by the Word of God would have on such things but even the standard of holiness that you and I would hold by God's grace the world itself looks upon and what does it do by the promise that we hold in our life it actually causes a congealing of the darkness together because the light itself being reflected through our life it actually causes them to unite in those things even though they don't agree with one another they'll unite in principle against a real standard of Christ's own life yet claiming to have his life that's suffering that's suffering you see it's not just suffering for those as you walk around and you have somebody on the street a drunkard or a prostitute or whomever more and they thank you crazy but it's to walk around with people on that walk within religious circles and they walk within it and they call you crazy they look at you you've lost your mind but you see friends all they can see is they look at though you are doing this by your own strength they do not see and recognize that this is not something that I'm doing by my own strength this is a love affair this is a relationship I don't have to do this by God's grace he has revealed himself to me I desire to do those things if there's something in his word that I don't know but I should know I want to know so that I can submit my life to it so when we look at this of how that the suffering in Hebrews 12 verse 6 the Paul says for whom the Lord loveth he chasing it now I want you to just think of this word here for a moment because sometimes we look at the term chastening and we think of the word chastening is always getting a whuppin that's not what a chastening is all about there is times of chastening where there's correction and Paul brings it out the next time of scourging but you realize that chastening itself is also an admonishment will speak to us and guide us and speak of certain things that we are to avoid this now watch out for this God will chasten and direct our lives sometimes the chastening is not so much what is said here but we can actually receive chastening of the Lord by the experiences that God has allowed to come through their lives understand it comes through that direction and that guidance now think of this and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth so one whom he receiveth his one that he acknowledges as his own these are the ones he acknowledges as his own if ye endure chastening God dealeth with you as with sons for what son is he whom the father chase and if not but if you be without chastisement whereof all are partakers then are you bastards and not sons so if you endure chastening this is how God deals with you enduring the chastening all of them and mana schmitz everything the correction that comes our way the reproof that comes our way all of that that comes our way does our flesh rejoice in that no it does not I'll say a man for you your flesh does not rejoice in coming neither does mine coming and getting cuddle but the inner man is being set free it's not cutting the inner man its setting free the inner man it's giving you and I the inner man authority and say ha ha ah you caught at it right now it gives us strength and I'll tell you what we need correction we need that correction from the Lord but just as much as we need correction from the Lord we need admonition - I don't know about you but I don't want to just be corrected all the time don't take me wrong friends I I love I thank God for his correction but I believe that God has more than just correcting you and I I want correction when I need correction but I just don't want to be corrected for the same thing over and over I want to grow up if I've been corrected about something I want to grow help me to grow speak to me about things that will help me to grow teach me on how that I can grow because none of us come here saying praise God I'm ready for that same whoopin again none of us are so here if you be without chastisement so this is not to receive it to actually be a partaker of it so if we're not a partaker of it how are we not a part a kinnor of chastisement when we do not receive it and allow it to move and shape and mold in our lives and bring forth watch how he says this in simonia church age he said this special condition in sir Myrna must be applied to every age there is no age free from it there's no true believer free from a dishes of God this is the will of God it is needful we need the Lord to teach us the truth that we are to suffer and be like in doing it and brother branham refers to a scripture right there at first Corinthians 13 7 of how the charity it beareth all things believeth all things it hope of all things and it endureth all things don't send me what does that mean that charity just didn't say there it is this isn't going how I thought I should go this in the way that I think it should go the charity Bharath Bharath is that when it does not even understand but charity beareth all things charity also believeth all things everything that God has said no matter if I see it or I feel it right now but God has said he is faithful to perform and that's where we're hopeful for all things I hope you understand me tonight love itself does not have an expectation of evil love has an expectation of God love does not have an expectation of our doomed this is my in this is that's not love that's not the love of God that's our love but remember his love is an unconditional love they meant he is love with in our lives that even when we ourselves have no way or nothing to put a stock of Hope in but yet in the midst of it there is hope from our soul hope expectation I don't know about you but have you ever come into service you've been down you've been discouraged but you said God if I can just make it to the house of God I know if I can just get fair lord I believe I'll leave out of there different what is that hope it's hope you've got an expectation I don't know how but I know that God will give me strength and direction for this and endureth all things this is where the Lord Jesus would take the time and telling the disciples in Matthew 5:11 12 think of these things that he drops all along the way in his earthly ministry these these parts that are left here all along the way but have it no doubt they didn't capture this they didn't capture it for themselves because you know why they didn't see themselves or see him as having to suffer you see they did not identify him that he would have to suffer yet they fought that he was indeed to be the Redeemer but yet they didn't realize in order to redeem he'd have to suffer but then after after being made him face to face then these things God would make real to her God would have it where Peter think of how Peter how Peter would be so led by the Spirit of God be it to be so instrumental to see the very the very parts of there in the trial and those things of how that even when the Lord Jesus himself was being taken and Peter himself was able to be captivated at that moment even though he was running from it even though he was trying to do everything to prevent it but yet there was a measure of it but the Spirit of God after Peter was converted would bring back to his attentiveness to where that Peter could be able to write about the image of Christ not about what he looked like defeat but he would be able to portray the greatest victory of how that a character had rose and become perfected and was able to stand there in the midst of the greatest testing and trials upon this earth God would allow those things to come back to him think of this how the scripture says blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceeding glad for great is your reward in heaven for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you notice this when we take of suffering let's look at this a little bit in the life of the Lord Jesus because as he is the groom he is the Redeemer and we as the redeemed then he will not ask of us to go through something that he himself has not went through and that he himself having that perfect confidence in the display of this life that this life in itself within our lives is able to preserve us and not just preserve us but that we would have joy in the midst of our trials hebrews chapter 2 verse 10 for it became him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings now the life that was within him the Spirit of God was absolutely perfect but the very character had to be perfected see what God is setting forth here is this is what every son and daughter must come to is this perfection so it's not just being born of the Spirit of God that is essential that is number one that is what Redemption is all about but in that process of redemption there is a development to where that which God has birthed and brought forth there is a development and a growth just like it is within that of children coming forth we don't leave children just to their own selves we train them is that right teach a child in the way it should go Paul tells us that were to admonish them it means teaching the full counsel and all those things that they would experience and they would see and also the correction that's to come but to see all of that is a perfecting but how that God himself was able and willingly subjected himself to this suffering he didn't have to but by the way of his coming he subjected himself to this suffering what love Hebrews 5:8 though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered it was in disobedient but he learned he actually was taught came to an understanding of what it meant to be fully submissive that's powerful because you realize real obedience requires full submission it's a training it's a teaching that goes on in our life because sometimes our feelings are going in a different direction here he is at the very final moments there in the Garden of Gethsemane and he asked if it's possible let this cup pass from me what's it doing learning obedience by the things that he suffered he's been suffering all all but he's learning obedience this is not an act this is not an act when Jesus was tempted it wasn't an act it was real the Bible said he suffered that means to be vexed undergo a sensible experience in that he was tempted he was pulled but God was able God was able to come down and so live through that humanity that body that he had created bringing it forth in the virgin birth God was able to so live through that body to where he could feel what it felt like to be obedient he can feel the pool that would come upon the flesh and upon the spirit he's so lived that he could experience that you say why would he do it so that he could be able to minister as a faithful and merciful high priest and to be the right kind of an intercessor for you and me he didn't do it for himself he wanted to understand you and he didn't have to have a headache he didn't have to get sick but God would so subject himself to allow sickness to come to his body the Prophet picks that up to where that he had a headache and he groaned aloud suffering you see what would it have been if we could read here about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ our Redeemer and yet we would see no suffering we would see that everybody in the religious realms loved him we would see that whole when people asked him questions he was always willing to answer no he wasn't as a matter of fact he walked away from a lot of questions hey men he was escorted out of certain things he avoided certain things why it was the wisdom of God you understand that's why it's important to know how what we're pouring our energies into you can be pouring your energies into an empty bucket and it goes right out the bottom come on friends with me we don't have time to mess around with our energies in our time we've got to be country inches to work while it's day four the night cometh they men mindful that it's not just you know things here and there but yet there must be a purpose and God helped me and direct me Lord to where my time is used to your glory and being made perfect Wow coming to full maturity full completion the journey of his life he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him called of God and high priest after the order of Melchizedek look how Peter picks us up in 1st Peter chapter 2 verse 18 servants be subject to your masters with all fear and not only to the good and gentle but also to the froward masters would that be like bosses and for this is think worthy if a man for conscience toward God endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it when you'd be buffeted for your faults you shall take it patiently anybody in here buffeted for your faults I got both my hands up from all Lord I'm full of them and so are you now even when we're buffeted for our faults we can get a little edgy I say a man for them Lord nobody in here loves criticism nobody nobody says praise God brother George come on over brother and criticize me no sir if you feel out that he's coming over to criticize you you will run the opposite way your flesh our flesh will do that is that right so then even within this here what Peter is saying hey when you're being buffeted for your faults you're not suffering for Christ I'll tell you they came over and I got so upset at them I got so mad and I'll tell you what they made me they penalize me on my check I'm suffering for the glory god no you're not suffering for the glory of God you're suffering for your own ignorance come on somebody let's stop playing like like we're laying it as trophies on behalf of the Lord but if when you do well and suffer for it you take it patiently you mean this has to be taught this isn't just something that's just automatic yes but the teaching goes deeper than just the words but I'm so glad that God gives words so that we don't think it's strange God makes sense of what we cannot make sense of this is acceptable to God for even even hereunto were you called because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when he was reviled got on Facebook and made his point no came back to church and acted like everything was alright and greeted everybody with a hug and a kiss and when he got out of that service he went back to Facebook and pasted posted his hurt hello oh no brother said I never say nothing like that when your fingers say it it's your heart that's coming out whether you say it to a person's face or you say it on a blog or a post you're guilty before God I'm telling you right now gets a high accountability you know it'd be better for some folks because if they Benton they can't keep their fingers off of their and they can't keep their mouth closed it'd be better to delete your account he'd be better to get off there altogether and say God help me Lord God and the church said who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but this is the part he committed himself to him that judgeth righteously he could have many times there's a lot of things he could have said rot out each time you know and I know there's been tempted times that you're tempted to refute something and the Spirit of God will pull you back and say let it go but god I've got more I've got the right points my points are just rotting that's it let it go you realize that that's a suffering Lord I want your word to spin God says baloney looks like let it go what should I do committed unto Him who judges righteously say Lord let that all be dissolved in my heart I commit myself to you I accept that I accept that Lord cuz I don't want them I don't want to argue about anything sin right it's like the preaching of the word we're not here to preach the word to argue lord have mercy what kind of church would it be First Church of the arguments boy you all would be full of zeal you've been going home and houses would be argument one another kids would be arguing with one another come on somebody but it's not about arguing it's about the word coming you can correct us the word cannon Mohnish us the word moves in our life but to think of the Lord Jesus himself he learned obedience he learned what it was to submit himself in the midst of tests and trials commit himself to him who judges righteously who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by His stripes you were healed in plain language the Prophet says the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering he has left his church a measure of suffering that they - by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection and this is what James speaks of here let me let me just descend here my brother and count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations it's not that the temptation is joyous that's not what James are saying oh god I thank you for the sick no no no that that's not what we're talking about but to recognize when something has come and you have no explanation about it you can look back and say Lord I don't know and you begin to search your life Lourdes or something listen friends when you really search your life and your heart is open before God remember I've always told you this over the years God don't hold things back from god don't say guess guess that's not God's Way if there is something God will make it known to you if it's something that needs to be corrected or made right God will never leave you in limbo he doesn't want you to walk in confusion he doesn't want you to walk in fear and wondering that's why he would come to you and make himself known to you think of this counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience its endurance think of in your life right now there's things that when you first started serving the Lord that you look at things as you did then is that wow this is incredible now you look back on those things you think there was nothing there was nothing compared to what I'm dealing with right now but you know that along with every other test and trial prepared you and this moment prepares you for the next moment he's the author with a purpose in mind and this is what James says let patience see this son God won't do but we must let patience have a perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing can I read just a few more scriptures to you brother Bentham talks about this of how that why God why does he stand by and how God would permit the suffering to take place within our life and this is where in Romans 8 if children then heirs of God and heir then heirs heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us there is only one thing that we take with us and that's our carrot there's nothing else of this life but we do take our character and character as the Prophet goes on to this quote and you're familiar with this character is not a gift the holy ghost is a gift characters not a gift character is a victory it's his victory manifesting victory in us by his strenght we overcome when we don't understand that's where we trust that's where trust comes in we suffer with him he's right there I want you to think of this now think of this when God called Paul he spoke through anis there and anis went over there to him and began to speak to Paul of what God had made known to him he says you go tell him he's a chosen vessel unto me but I'm gonna show him that word show means teach him what great things he must suffer for my name's sake now I want you to think of this there in Jerusalem there was suffering that was going on there were things that were taking place but now God would take his messenger that would be one that would be the light that would take this gospel to the Gentiles and God would not only preach the real true gospel that delivering gospel to the Gentiles but God would have a man that would be able in his hand that God would reflect suffering God would reflect deliverance through Paul's life he could have just told him about it but he allowed it to be demonstrated and shown character we can't buy it you can't buy it the system of this of this life listen this is this comes down to where even in the little small space of time that we have with our children it's a small space of time for character development and is there everything that's fully developed within the 18 years no there's experiences that they will have to go through but the foundation and these things that are necessary that are laid in make ready for those things that are its character that's being developed because as he seated there in his father's from and we are to share that throne we cannot share that throne and reign with him unless we also suffer with him Paul's talking about a union Paul's talking about a marriage Paul's talking about these this suffering that that a person would go through this is where that Paul would talk about look not only that I would know him in the power of his resurrection that's essential as Paul said also in the Fellowship of his suffering and let me show you this scripture here if you look with me in 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 and I am closing here and I may know him in the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death so suffering who's dying in suffering us the outer man is perishing but the inward man is being renewed but I'll say this to you in every test and in every trial you know him not just in the Fellowship of his suffering but you also know him in the power of his resurrection 2nd Corinthians chapter 1 verse 3 let me just read these blessed be God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of mercies and the God of all comfort who comforts us in all our tribulation behind a lot didn't he then we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble experience is something that cannot be bought experience cannot be taught there's many things that I come to that my dad over the years even when I've just when I was just starting of things even just the pastor and my dad within the past my dad was never one let me teach you this is my dad was never like that my dad you came and he just submitted himself and moved right under that my dad was not one who walked around and went after the church was turned over here where he walked around as a I headed over and do this and don't do that that was not my dad that was not him at all I look at that right there I think My Lord Jesus he he could could he have done it he could have but he did not do that but instead when there are things that right at the very beginning of different things that he could tell me and you know what I could say I see that okay but I really didn't see it but you know what after years go by then you experience it you know what comes back to my mind what he said and when I realized that was experience it wasn't that it didn't do any good for him to tell me certain things it's just that now what he told me I realized as I go through certain things oh this is what he was talking about oh this is what he was saying no saying of the jig's did you go through that experience and get a master's degree no as a matter of fact I didn't get a certificate from kindergarten a lot of times didn't even past the preschool of a building the building blocks up but I was able to go through and say oh I see now Lord God gave me grace so next time yes sir who comfort us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted God for as the sufferings of Christ abound in us so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ well said our sufferings are just it's such great increase but so is the comfort of God so this is a testimony and whether we be afflicted it is for your consolation watch this watch this verse it is for your consolation and salvation which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer or whether we be comforted it is for your consolation and salvation there is it Paul laid down testimony human you get over to chapter 11 Paul lets them know all the different pearls all of this tribulation it was for to let them know for their consolation that the same God that brought them through and brought them out they could witness man they went through this but they could witness God brought him out not allowed that to be with the Hebrew children those things to be written for our encouragement they went through that they stood not knowing whether God would deliver not knowing what door even open but look how God brought him out look how God manifested himself to them that's written for us for us that portion in the word that God would let it be known that they came out of the fire without a smell of smoke on their clothing God let that be known for you and I that though you would go through the test and the trial yet I will preserve you and our hope of you is steadfast knowing that as ye are partakers of the suffering so shall you be also of the consolation for we would not brethren have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia that we were pressed out of measure above strength in so much that we decided even a life oh you're ruining my image Paul you're a prophet of God that didn't run it for the elected in that agent it won't run it for the elect now he despaired even his own life that means being in such a distress of straights but we had the sentence look at this but we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves God I'll take care of this I've got the sword no Paul said that was the sentence of death the sentence of death was right in us all we had to do was give in to that sentence but what was the sentence Paul to trust in ourselves Lord you can bring me through a noise bring me through a lock David said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock lead me to the rock that is higher than I David said in Psalms I think in my distress I cried unto the Lord and he heard me and the mountains were moved look how Paul brings this when we had that sentence of death in ourselves and we should not trust in ourselves but in God which raiseth the dead why is he talking about being raised from the dead right here why why would he speak of it because going through a suffering time and Paul was speaking of the great great perplexing moment of this time it was like death but the same God that raised him up in his soul is the same God that could raise him once again watch how he reads this here but in God which raises the dead who delivered us from so great a death did he not has he not delivered you and I from so greater death and just deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us this is the promise he restoreth my soul not only has my soul been raised into heavenly places but I'm so thankful that in the midst of times when we have everything that can come around us for insolence and sometimes your tests your trial and you know maybe a person could look at and say what ain't the same as mine ain't the same in mine but remember every one of this as the prophet teaches us it's laid out clearly in the scriptures that these are personal temptations these are seasons of testing and they are personal tailor-made but greater is He that is in you he that hath raised you up and delivered you from so great a death delivers you and will also deliver you in their wonderful in a wonderful amen let's stand ye also here's Paul speaking of this deliverance ye also helping together by prayer for us that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons thanks may be given by a mini on our behalf of Paul's requesting pray for us keep praying for us keep holding us up in prayer there goes God will he is faithful just one testimony tonight that was given here no doubt there's more testimonies that could be given and this situation just arose at the first part of this week is that right it just arose the first part of this week a situation that we looked at here that according to established laws according to everything else brother brother brother brother Joshua could have just said himself and just this is what the laws say this is just the way it's gonna go I'll just flow along with it but instead he requested prayer and said remember me in prayer I've got this situation but will you pray with me as far as how it looked the situation looks so bleak but yet as God not proved himself his love his care as I say that testimony is not just for our brother but that testimony is for this assembly it's for each and every one of us I'm glad God comes down and reminds us aren't you I'm glad of that because sometimes you know what we forget how God has visited us we forget the healing that has taken place not years ago just even in this past year I don't have to go and call out things back and back and back in here I'm told my just in this past year of things that God has done deliverances and things that God has brought just within this past year how how we ought to be so thankful it ought to give us encouragement and hope and let me say this to you as the song says what he's done for others with arms wide open your pardon you there is no secret what God can do don't you love him don't you just say lord I I want to just Lord more than ever I want to trust you lord help me Lord God help me Lord in everything though I can't see the end out of this but Lord God I trust you Lord to direct me and guide me through it Lord Lord Jesus let my testimony let my joy Lord let my life let even through the midst of it let it be a testimony let's pray maybe why don't--why you got right you're standing next to one another brother to brother brothers sister let's just pray for one another maybe you got to get out of your seat or you've got someone right near you let's pray with one another right now let's just go before the throne of God

deliver us Lord Jesus father you see Lord God right here Lord among us Lord God tonight Lord as we stand together Lord as a body of believers Lord father in so many different needs Lord I know that
